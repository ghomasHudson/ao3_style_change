. He was simply gorgeous.
‘You’re the hero, Potter. I’m nothing.’
Draco Malfoy’s face came into view, too close to his, too real. The grey eyes bore into his. He’d seen Malfoy so many times but never up this close. And never like this. His blond hair fell over one of his eyes, obscuring it. His lips were thin, slightly parted and red. They were wet - from sucking and rimming Harry. There was a hint of a pleased smirk there, but just a hint. Like he wasn’t too sure of himself just then. Fuck. Draco Malfoy was…
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s undressing behind me, his right hand still pinning me in place. I can’t believe this is happening. He wouldn’t- I don’t want this. His hands are now all over me, the whole weight of his body pressing me against the wall.
Harry breathed fast. His voice was a hoarse thread of desire.
‘I can’t tell him. I don’t think I would be able to bear the rejection.’
We stare at each other. Come to think about it, it’s something we’ve both been doing a lot. Staring and staring until one of us gets a reaction out of the other. Any kind of reaction. He has a week-old bruised lip and jaw to match my bruised chest and arms. He really did quite the job on me with those hexes. He’s
Like I’m confiding in Pansy or Blaise and not the man I’ve been sleeping with on and off for months. The man my best friends are certain I have feelings for. My only crush since forever.
‘I wish you could see what I’m seeing Harry… you’re a sight, spread like this for me,’ Malfoy said, his words hitching on Harry’s crease, making him insane. He’d never been this desperate to be fucked by anyone.
Unabashedly wrong for me in every way.
‘There’s
I lean back against the wall, protected by my
‘He almost comes from it only,’ Josh added, and indeed Harry looked like he was about to, his cock hard and untouched, leaking against the couch, his hips jerking helpless.
‘Go slow,’ he whispers into your ear.
He drinks, he watches me and I watch him back.
‘Put up some spells, do me here,’ I say instead. Like I just want to get it over with, when in fact I never want it to end. Like it always does. Like it always will.
Hermione smiles at me.
He cuts me off, like I knew he would.
‘Feel it,’ I say.
‘Of course there is,’ I say. I have this vision of a life where Potter is my boyfriend and this, right here, our hands, his closeness, Pansy talking to us about her flings, is normal. ‘Go enjoy your night,’ I tell her, my mind reeling.
‘That’s fucking absurd,’ I say, realising I’m pacing the room, although I don’t remember standing up. ‘You’re the one who warned me- you said it yourself, he doesn't care about anyone, he fucks them, then leaves them-’
They kissed. And then Draco said something he had never expected to say this early.
‘Well, how romantic. I’m sure he’ll be asking to have your babies soon.’
He grimaces, but there’s still a blush riding high on his cheeks.
I finally take my eyes off the tea and find him still looking at me.
Believe me, you don’t want to be on the other side of the look she’s just given me. And this is coming from someone who’s been eye to eye with Voldemort. She sets the money on the counter.
Instead, I nod.
He takes a step towards it and the light twinkles. Beckons to him. Strange behaviour for a light, he thinks. Even a magical one. He doesn’t want to have anything to do with it. But he’s going to have to approach it to leave the room. He takes another step, there’s another twinkle and then the light moves forward. It stops again.
‘Fuck, I…’ Harry sobbed, then cursed again, and his voice was rough around the edges, the sexiest thing Draco had heard in life. ‘I have this fantasy. About you.’
‘Fuck me,’ he murmured. He heard Malfoy suck in a hard breath. ‘Draco, please, fuck me open… I need… I need your cock...’ Malfoy’s mouth opened over his neck and he bit down, harshly, Harry crying out at the sudden pain, but his body giving in to it almost instantaneously.
Harry gagged on his three fingers, his eyes wet, while Josh shifted again behind him, angling his cock deeper, his hands seizing on Harry’s hips. Josh gave Draco a look of urgency.
‘Is that what you want?’ Potter’s eyes are wide. ‘Do you- I mean- if you want, I mean, we could try… the poly stuff?’
‘Of course there is,’ Malfoy says. I’m only aware of his hand there, so intimate, like we’re boyfriends. Like we’re
Oh fuck. That voice. That was a Dom’s voice through and through. He felt faint. There was something strict and pulsing underneath that calm. It made Harry want to draw it all out. He felt the first hint of the curling addiction building up inside him.
Draco moved his hand up, fingers tight around his shaft and groaned.
Parkinson is also there. They always start the night dancing together. She also looks different. Her hair is shorter, curling around her ear, and her laugh is easy. There’s a lot of sex in their dance. At first I thought they were together, but I was wrong. Parkinson leaves with a different woman every night. Tonight it’s probably that cute black girl now wrapped around her, a hand over Parkinson’s arse. As for Malfoy… he never leaves with anyone, but flirts with just about everyone.  Everything about him screams fuck you and fuck me at the same time. One is familiar; the other vast unknown territory; together, they keep me coming back for more. But I never make a move on him. I’m the only one that doesn’t.
Coming back to the club had been a mistake. Just how big a mistake was yet to be seen, although he’d already found what he’d been looking for.
‘I like the fact that you’re cold with almost everyone… but not with me.’ He says this in a rush, like he needs to get it out of his system.
‘Why won’t you talk to me?’
I’m actually surprised I managed to keep her away this long.
He’s wearing black eyeliner and it makes the grey in his eyes even more grey. They drift from my eyes, to my mouth, then slowly back up.
Draco came up to Harry, one hand on his cock, the other coming to rest on Harry’s hip.
‘You’re shaking, Draco,’ he lifts his hand and I step away from him. He silently accioes his wand. It enters the kitchen and he catches it in his hand, without even looking.
‘Forever,’ he says, and takes another sip of his tea.
It wants him to follow.
‘Oh, you mean you're not the Golden Boy turned playboy, fucking his way through every gay bar in London?’
‘You're only seeing Draco.’
All my want breaks the dam at the raw honesty of him. He kisses my piercing first, pulls it between his lips and runs his tongue over it. I swear this is the sweetest, sexiest thing a bloke has ever done to me, and I’m pretty sure there’s more of it coming.
I try to find an angle to look at my wand. To make sure it’s still there, that he didn’t take it- I can’t wandlessly
He sits down beside me. I almost jump from the closeness of it. He smells like flowers and dance.
‘So do you,’ he says in a heartbeat.
He had no clue what he was even begging for, but Malfoy’s tongue gave it to him. A cleaning spell tickled his hole, wandless magic, made discreetly, oh fuck, he was even harder now, Malfoy was really his type. The way he controlled a crop, a cane, a wand and blunt magic, and the way he handled Harry, the things he said, just right, just perfect, everything about him was a walking wet dream. Malfoy’s hands parted his arse cheeks and Harry’s hole clenched and unclenched under his stare.
‘If Josh wants. If you want. It will.’
‘You’re… Fuck.’
‘Right,’ your voice comes out hoarse.
‘Get comfortable,’ he said to Josh, taking a seat before Harry, leash in hand.
‘I thought you wanted to please me,’ Malfoy said, warm, expectant.
‘Tell me what you want.’
Harry forced his eyes open. He looked dazed, his body loose and his cock still hard. Draco recognized the look of a submissive who hoped to be rewarded.
He hoped. One thing he was sure of: he could come with just a word from the man behind him.
I feel a sense of sudden resolve settling over me. I grit my teeth.
His mother was sitting at his desk, in front of her were stacks of letters.  Letters in his handwriting.
And with that she had left him to try and figure out what exactly had just happened.  Through the entirety over the conversation she had managed to find out that Astoria and Draco lived apart and had been for quite a long time.  That Draco had been writing letters to Harry since just after the war had ended.  That their friendship was new but they had seen each other twice.
Decorating was a breeze, he did a couple with magic to see what they were supposed to look like, then did a few more, carefully undoing a couple of the perfect flourishes and things, knowing that he couldn't be spot on perfect, not the first week and not every week, and messing up in the finishing touches was easy.  And actually kind of fun.
there was a Vanishing Cabinet at Hogwarts where as they were supposed to be operating under they idea there 'must' be, not for sure....
Draco frowned, turning his head slightly as he regarded Harry uneasily.  “I’m sorry, I would have thought you’d find a little relief in a child of mine being wary of the Dark Arts.” He spoke stiffly, his spine seeming to straighten up a little more and make him taller and slightly haughty in his manner.
"And WIN?"  Harry scoffed, then laughed and shoved his hand into Draco's.  "Fine.  I bet that you won't.  And I'll even help you with your audition tape..."
Chocolate?
see Harry Potter."  She said icily near the end of the conversation, sweeping her bangs out of her eyes.  "People are always watching him.  If you want to ensure that your marriage still looks intact, and trust me Draco, you
“I could kill you.  That would stop you.” The words grated out of Harry who leaned even heavier against the blonde, forcing a groan from Draco that was followed with a breathy laugh.
“I probably am.”  Draco said, but it was succinct.  There was no gloating or sneering about it, he was just stating fact.  “My Aunt is by far the most psychopathic person I have ever met, and that includes the Dark Lord.... But she knows her stuff.”
"Have you put your eggs in shell and all?"
Draco was chuckling by the time Harry paused in his rambling, nudging the other boy again.  "Not too bitter, are you."
"Some secrets are very much worth keeping."
“He did.  And I just thought that since some of it involved me that I---”
"At least you can visit.  I'll even give you the password, everyone has been told rather pointedly that you belong and no one is to ask any questions."
He looked up when Neville didn't answer, meeting the other man's gaze and seeing him without a smile for the first time.
And they sat silently.  Sipping at hot chocolate that never went cold and the mugs never seemed to empty.  Harry eventually placed his on the table next to him, sighing as he leaned back in the chair and looked around the room again.  His eyes travelled slowly over the posters of the Bulgarian National, moving pictures of people Harry mostly didn't know though a few he recognized as other Slytherins.  And tucked into the corner of the mirror over the long dresser was an article from the Daily Prophet.  "The Chosen One?" flashed at him, interchanging with a photo of himself.
"Even compared to keeping Dumbledore alive." He said quietly, looking back to Draco's face seriously and steadily.  "We might be able to do both, and we can explore that.  I want to follow it because you're right.  But first and foremost I want to take care of what we started out to do.  You need to write a letter to your mother.  It needs to get to her and you need to know that she's safe.  Then we'll tackle the next step."
Draco’s arms came up, one folding over the back of Harry’s neck while his other hand plunged into his dark, messy hair.  He tilted his head up a bit to press back into the bruising kiss, his mouth opening just as Harry’s did.
Harry didn't answer, he didn't feel like arguing with Ron and getting that slightly pained and curious look from Hermione that was beginning to be the norm when Draco came up.
The meetings he'd been having with Dumbledore that year had taught him a lot.  Not just about Voldemort and his history and the truth behind what he was up against, but about the older man as well.  And just how much Dumbledore actually seemed to know about everything that was going on around him with the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself.  Harry honestly figured not all of what he was going to tell him would come as a surprise.  And he was right.
"Oh go on...  Ask.." Draco shook his head a bit as he laughed.  It was clear from Harry's expression he wanted to ask something personal about it but was trying his best to be polite.
While Ginny was the one who was bent over their children as they waited to board the train, Draco was the one who was on a knee in front of his and Astoria's son.
Draco raised his shoulders in a shrug that was much more nonchalant than he felt.  "I suppose."
“You shouldn't be in here.  Potter was QUITE angry that you were even at the door to bring me that bubble tea drink.  This has to be ten times worse.”
This time Draco knew what he wanted and needed to do next.
"You should just kill me now.  That would solve a lot of problems."
Draco was quiet for awhile as he thought, then he nodded his head, turning to look out the window.  “That’s fine with me.  But I would like you to send me an Owl afterwards to tell me what you talked about.  I’m sure he’ll have more questions for me and I want a level playing field.”
"It's just that over the summer, when he was at... Meetings in our house.  And he was giving Him updates and things.  He was telling him wrong information."
He added coffee grounds and water to the coffee maker, the activity getting close to routine at this point.  And something, he had to admit, that he liked.  The mindless ritual of preparing coffee, the scent of opening the bag of grounds first thing in the morning, the crackling gurgle of the maker as it got going.
"It's not good.  It's...  I don't know what it is.  Kingsley doesn't know what it is.  We're having to be really careful."
“Can I go now?” He asked Harry, tilting his head a bit with a smirk. “Or did you have something else to offer in exchange for information?”
"None of us are safe in these times, Harry.  Those of us that are threats to Voldemort are less safe, but it doesn't stop us from doing the things that are most important, does it?  You, yourself, know the threat on your life, but you haven't for a moment balked at the idea of helping Draco.  Why would you think I would be any different?"
"Is that why it always felt cold and smelled funny and everything stayed dim?"  Harry brought Draco back into the kitchen where Kreacher had left a feast on the table for them for lunch.
But he took hold of the door handle again.
"I can't take that."  Draco took a half step back even while everything in him screamed at him to grab the bottle.
"You met my family, hm?  Well... saw my family...  When was this?"  Tom moved around the room, running his fingertips along the edge of the windowsill, down the line between the wardrobe doors and then circled them around the short post at the corner of his bed.
"I know."  Harry said, just as shortly, pulling back and releasing Draco from where he had him against the tree.  "It doesn't make any sense."
"Why do you care?"  Draco asked quietly and hesitantly, like he was scared that Harry would reply that he didn't.
The phrase circled his head again and he reached out one hand to place on Draco's shoulder.  The pale boy flinched but didn't pull away.  "I don't care anymore.  What you've been up to.  What you've done.  I heard what you said."
"Right there.  Look hard."  Harry said, then moved behind the smaller boy, reaching up to turn his head a bit.  "There is ONE star there, but it's small.  It's harder to find through the telescope first, looking just like this will help you find it with the telescope."
"Dementors right in your Muggle neighbourhood?" Draco asked, then let out a low breath as Harry nodded.
Harry wanted to be angry that Draco had potentially led Voldemort straight to him, but honestly he really didn't care.  Not that much.  Not when they were both staring down the barrel of the same gun anyways.
“Always has to be a trial with him, doesn't it.  He can't just be forthright...”  Tom chuckled darkly, pushing a hand through his hair before turning his eyes over to Draco.  “Are you joining us or just staring?  I don't mind the staring, I just don't want to not include you in the conversation if you do wish to be part of it.”
But Harry had insisted.  Aside from some snide remarks at the start and continued disbelief that Draco would even have a chance at getting on the show, Harry HAD become a great deal of help and a wealth of information.  Both from his days spent doing everything the Muggle way at his Aunt and Uncles house, and the incredible instruction imparted to him from Mrs Weasley.
and therein lay the problem.
He rubbed the spot, now perplexed about what had caused the pain, then saw the galleon sitting on the floor in front of his chair.  It had an odd red sort of bubble, and while he knew if Hermione was there she would be screeching at him to not touch it, he still leaned down to pick it up.
Draco nodded, sighing softly.  He understood what Harry meant.  If he, himself, had had much choice in who he married or even IF he married, he wouldn't have gotten involved with Astoria, it would have been cruel.  But he also understood the pressure Harry was under with the whole world watching him.
"Socks..."  Draco said, his head tilting and his nose crinkling up a bit.  "Rather ugly socks at that..."
Normally he kept those deep waters as calm as possible.  He tried not to touch them, tried not to even shift them around so the silt lay at the very bottom undisturbed.
“Potter... Look...”  Draco started a few moments later, making a soft noise and pushing a hand through his hair again.
"Add that thing with your cousin to the list of stories I want to hear about sometime." Draco said and was happy when Harry smiled.  "But go on..."
“Because I don't, Potter.  There's not some big crazy reason.”
If Harry openly wanted to keep in touch, he certainly wasn't going to say no.
"Don't swear, it's so uncouth."  Harry muttered the words but he smiled as he said them, shifting his knees a bit to start moving with more of a rhythm, pulling back just a bit, then arching forward strongly, loving the feel of being so deep inside the blonde.
"And the gay thing."
“I absolutely shouldn't be telling you this but...”  Harry shrugged a bit, scratching the back of his head.  “They're both in hiding as well.  Maybe if we can get them up to using cell phones you could text with them.  Some contact with people you know, at least.  Familiarity.”
"NOW.  BOTH OF YOU."
"You've been lugging filthy portraits around with no gloves on for several hours.  Your hands were filthy..."
“I'll take you on a tour of the neighbourhood while I'm here now,” Harry continued as though Draco hadn't spoken.  “And tomorrow morning someone will teach you about how everything works in the kitchen and the light switches and all of that.”
“Uh huh.”  Harry nodded his head, a smirk starting to spread across his face.  “That ring.  The one Tom asked us about and got REALLY upset at the answer just at the end there...”  Unconsciously Harry raised his hand to rub against his scar, remembering they way it felt when he woke up after the dream visit.
"The way you talked to Snape.  That was...."
"For what?"  Harry asked, still smiling as he leaned against the wall, watching Draco carefully.  He'd known that the other boy wouldn't want to take it.  He'd known he was going to have to persuade him.
"Then that's time, effort and magic both of you wasted.  I don't need your help.  I don't need her making vows with you.  There is nothing to stop me doing exactly as is asked of me."
Robes, quills, rolls of parchment.  A few bottles of ink and countless pairs of socks got tossed haphazardly back into his trunk.
"May arm?"  Draco arched one eyebrow, trying to look like he didn't know why Harry would want to see his arm.  "It's an arm..."
-------
“Malfoy.” Harry said in return, surprised when the corners of Draco's lips tugged upwards slightly, making his own do the same for a moment before he forced them down into a frown.
real.  Just as real now as they had been when he'd written the letter.
Harry's voice came again, above his head now as the other man stood on the other side of the door.  A lot firmer than before, rather no nonsense.
Tom pushed back from Harry, but gave his thighs a squeeze that included the hard press of his sharp nails.  A feeling that gave Harry a bit of a jolt in the pit of his stomach that wasn't entirely unpleasant.
“What do you mean?”  Draco asked, tilting his head slightly.
Harry had hesitated, his eyes seemed locked on Draco's as Draco looked back at him, utterly lost and not at all interested in trying to fight with him to get the wands back, even though his own was with them.
The last thing he wanted, the very last thing in the world he wanted, was to have others in the Wizarding community looking on him with sympathy.  With pity.
That stopped Draco dead, his hands stilling from their constant fiddling with whatever they could find.  He stared at Neville in shock, shaking his head before his mind even really caught up to anything.
"Why not?"  Draco asked, leaning forward to smirk as he looked into the other boy's face.  "I'd much rather be dead, then Bargey and Muggle Lover could talk to each other for eternity and leave me out of it."
"And my family." Draco said quietly, letting out a long low breath.
Harry didn't come back the day that Draco had found out about his father.
tear it down.  No one wants to be the one to own the last place Voldemort called his Headquarters."
Draco sighed out a long breath, rubbing his eyes that felt gritty after a night of no sleep.  He looked out the window to confirm what he had been worried about.  The sun was now much too high for him to send Mimir back out again with a reply, which meant he'd have to leave Theodore waiting until later that night.
“I'm not crazy.”  Harry said, suddenly afraid of what he must have looked like to those around him lately.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
They waked in silence for awhile, but rather than the silence stretching and becoming uncomfortable, the longer they walked side by side without speaking, the more companionable it got.
Tom had been smiling more and more as Draco spoke, even chuckling as he explained how he'd learned about the subject at hand.  “You're more of a rebel than you've appeared to be in recent months, hm?”
"S'pose you have a point."  Ron said, picking up his fork again.  "And if anyone else bought it I bet people would whisper that they were bad and up to no good.  Just how people are.  But if you bought it and said it was to preserve history everyone would nod and understand and likely think you're even better of a bloke than they already do."
He started a letter, an earnest one and one probably more heartfelt than he really intended it to be, then halfway through he made a noise of frustration, crumpling it up and tossing it onto the floor.
“Bad enough to.. say... turn a hand black and dead?”  Harry spoke the words fairly quietly and slowly, his thoughts coming together as he flicked his eyes at Draco, raising his eyebrows a bit.
“It's certainly.. different...”  Harry said, which was actually completely true.
Draco had been listening avidly as Neville explained to him how it all worked, more than a little fascinated at the ideas.  Just as he had been taken with the television, the idea of these cell phone things sounded endlessly useful and intriguing.
He spoke to the owl as he went over to the book case to pick out a large but thin hardcover book.  Dropping that on the couch he went rummaging in his small desk for a quill, parchment and a bottle of ink.  Once he'd settled on the couch crosslegged, he put the book over his legs, then the parchment, ink and quill on top of the book as it acted like a table.
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
"Defence Against the Dark Arts."  Harry said, scooping up the ball of parchment on Draco's desk, tossing it into the air to catch it for himself.  "Potions, when I had Snape's old textbook."
Draco stood up, brushing off his pants and straightening the jacket he wore.  "Can I apparate from here?  Are there rules about it?"
Fictober is over!  But now I'm embarking on 50,000 words of Fic for all of November for NaNoWriMo!!  :D
"If you'd died who knows what He would have done to our world."  Draco said frowning at Harry, his fingers curling in the fabric against the other boy's side, giving it a slight tug.
Draco nodded silently, looking down again as his mind VERY easily brought that moment to the forefront.  Because he remembered, too.  It really had just been a moment and yet somehow time seemed to expand for that moment.  Harry had scooped up his wand, then looked up and met his eyes.  Draco just watched him, everything in him feeling crumbled to bits.  He didn't care that Harry had his wand.  He didn't care if anyone saw him looking at Harry the way he was.  Everything in him SCREAMED to beg the other boy to take him wherever they were going.  He didn't care what it was they were doing, didn't care if they dragged him halfway across the world then left him there so long as it was away from his house, away from the war, away from Voldemort and all the horrible, terrible things he kept having to do.
“You don't.  You don't need to.  For all intents and purposes, you are now a Muggle.”  Harry said, taking out his own wand and pointing it at Draco's hand.  “Either you give it to me on your own, or I disarm it from you and then it's
“I plan to go out as little as I can possibly get away with.”  Draco said, folding his arms over his chest and looking out the window next to them.  “It's what I have been doing up to now, I don't see any reason why I should have to change my lifestyle just because I'm living in the Muggle world for the time being.”
“I don't mean like the way Harry took you for a walk.  No quizzes, no teaching, no cafes.  Just a walk around the neighbourhood.”  Neville paused for a moment, practically mumbling the rest.  “If you say no then I have to go back to my post.  And as much as I'm happy to be here, standing in one place for hours at a time is incredibly boring.”
Once he finished, Dumbledore once again sat silently, his fingers knit together and pressed under his lower lip.  Looking at him now, rather than at his lap, Harry could tell he just needed to wait, that this silence was Dumbledore going over everything he'd just said.
"Where are you, Draco?"  He murmured to the air around him, holding the coin up to look again.  "Did you have this the whole time?"
"I hate you."  Draco muttered, leaning his back against the wall of the tub, seriously considering sliding down under the water and just staying there forever.
And there he was.  The man Harry both hoped he wouldn't see, and rather desperately hoped he would.
At first, Draco had been understandably weirded out by the whole thing.  Who wouldn't have been in his position?  And he had been very suspicious, wondering if this was a new angle Harry was taking to spy on him.  But after awhile he had to admit that it really didn't seem to be.  Harry was crafty and sly and a million other things that would make him a good actor to pretend he was being friendly when he wasn't, but he couldn't fake the little things.
All the same, he felt an odd squirm in the pit of his stomach.  Not just at the loss of the coin, which he acknowledged he was unhappy about, but something deeper.  That in the past three days more had happened 'magically' than had happened in the past few years combined.
"Sure you can.  I didn't even get it through truly honest means."
“I had a feeling you'd get it.  I figured I might as well put it to you the way anyone who didn't have your best interests in mind would do it.  Could you tell it was coming?”
Harry could read a million questions on Draco's face but all he did was squeeze his hand.  Tight.  Tight enough to still the tremble in Draco's fingers.
"Because I do.  Because Voldemort doesn't just affect my life, and the fight I know I'm heading towards with him isn't just for me."
Without thinking too much, which would have likely caused him to change his mind, Draco got up and went to change.  With fresh clothes, his hair combed and teeth brushed he went out, going down the stairs and out into the street.
“I just realized...” He worked hard to look surprised, and like he had just been shocked by the discovery.  “He told me the things he's done to try and fix it, and he's described how it was damaged physically.  That means there definitely is a Vanishing Cabinet at Hogwarts.  He couldn't have been going back and forth to Knockturn Alley to work on the one in the shop, could he?”
Hard enough that Draco jumped a bit in front of him and took a step back.  A slow smile spread across his face as he looked at Harry, his eyes brightening from grey to near silver.  “You did it..”
"It wasn't a dream, not really.  He was using the connection between us and.. magic, obviously, to manipulate things the way he wanted them to be."
Now it was evening and they had stayed up long past everyone else in the house, opting to discuss Harry's findings in more private surroundings.
"No this is what it looks like."  Draco said, getting to his feet and needlessly brushing off the legs of his trousers.  "At least this is what it looks like to anyone but me.  I wasn't allowed to decorate in a way anyone else could see."  He reached for his wand but then came up empty, his brow furrowing slightly."
“Well you thought it looked like fun..”  Draco said, the dark nasty smirk playing across his features.  “Give it a go and see while you tell me about this memory.”
Harry realized all at once that this really wasn't a dream.  Wasn't a replay of the memory he'd seen.  It was a test.  A very BIG test.   "I do recognize you.  I've stood in this room before.  Seen you before."
“It doesn’t matter.” Draco said, closing all his fingers around the comfortable and familiar contours of the wand he’d missed so much.  “You kept it.  I thought it was lost or destroyed in the last fight.  Or taken, since it was the wand that.. ended him.”
He knew he was dreaming, was well aware that he was asleep, and he wasn't surprised that Tom would choose now to come and see him, but....
Harry couldn’t help but smile.  McGonagall was a kind woman, but she never danced around a point.  If she had something to say, she said it.
When they eventually made it out and onto the street, Draco took the time to actually, really, look around.  Including giving his building a proper look.
“Did he...”  Harry said, raising his eyebrows as he kept his eyes on Draco.
He gave his head a shake to try and clear the memory, then turned to look when he heard footsteps.  Part of him was expecting someone else entirely.  Harry finally having played him properly, he'd send someone else to laugh at him rather than show up himself.
He then balled up the envelope and the parchment, tossing both into the fire, before he picked up the remote and started flicking through the channels.
Draco nodded, turning his eyes away a bit.  "He did, I hung back, I didn't want to fight it.  Cowardly..."
Story Summary-
Both he and Harry had agreed that he needed to do some things on his own in order to not only look more realistic, but to waste some time as well.  If he spent the whole of each challenge mucking around and just using his wand, there would be a lot of time he'd be on camera doing a bunch of nothing.  Which would look weird, to say the least.
"You're...  Bad with time."  Draco couldn't help but laugh, it fell out of him in a low chuckle as he shook his head, reaching to start balling up his attempt at a letter to the other man.
Harry had lost the ring.
Snape did step back then, his eyes flicking as they searched Draco's for any sort of weakness, finding none he seemed to try a different approach.  "I only intend to keep my promise to your mother.  She came to ME, seeking me out to make the unbreakable vow to help you."
Harry nodded, smoothing his hands against the desk.  “I wanted to talk to you before I talked to him.  I don’t want him to be afraid of me.  But I don’t know why he would be.”
“Thank you.” Draco said simply, meeting Harry’s eyes again, causing a flutter in the darker haired man’s chest at how their gazes locked so strongly.
-------
“Detention, Mr Malfoy.  Your essay well deserves it.”
“They mentioned it's the nicest and the biggest.  How could I not like it?”  He said, edging away from Harry, hoping that he was moving slow enough that it wasn't obvious he was purposefully trying to put some space between them.
He was stopped there in the hall, closely examining the sconce without thinking he should be doing something else when he heard someone say his name.  Looking up and down the hall he saw Draco coming towards him with an odd look on his face.
Harry spoke with force.  He meant it.  Draco had been a pain in the ass.  An egotistical asshole.  A total prejudiced jerk.  But he didn't deserve the threat on his life and his family if he didn't
Harry scrunched his nose up  a bit and sighed before he continued, leaning back and looking up at the ceiling.  “Then I'm learning that I somehow saved the whole wizarding world when I was a baby.  I don't remember a thing about it but I'm given all the credit.  That spell could have just as easily killed me, but it backfired...  In that situation, it made perfect sense for me to be like 'Yeah!  These people, these are the ones I'm fighting for.  Voldemort is bad, all these people are good.'”
"Harry..." Hermione started and then hesitated, rethinking what she was going to say before continuing.  "Do you think we should tell anyone about what happened?  About seeing Draco in Borgin & Burkes?"
Harry- No one said you can have internet.
"I talked to Snape."  Draco said, with a nod, looking down.  "I told him everything."
“That's Neville.  Neville Longbottom.”
“It's alright, Professor Snape.”  Harry said, nudging Draco lightly with his elbow.
"Making out in the Ministry hallway? I kind of agree."  Harry smirked, but the expression faded as he saw the frown on Draco's face deepen again.  "What did you mean?"
"Well you don't trust him."  Draco said, looking at Harry where he was lying on the bed.  The pillowy duvet half swallowing him.  He flopped back as well, lying next to Harry, staring up at the dark canopy above them.  He took out his wand and flicked it here and there, adding small pinpoints of light to the dark surface like stars.
He started watching the room, watching the hosts and the judges as well as the contestants.  He turned his mixer back on and slipped his wand out from where it was stuck in the front of his jeans under his apron.  He kept it down under the counter where it couldn't be seen as he moved to stand directly in front of the mixer.  When he thought it was safe enough he flicked his wand at the bowl, then shoved it back under his apron.  He watched as the lumpy, goopy and disgusting mixture in the bowl immediately smoothed out into a creamy and perfect batter.
Harry's face instantly darkened, his eyes narrowed a bit as he exhaled a long low breath through his nose.  “He did.”
"Clearly."  Harry said, his eyes staying on Draco.
"Mm hmm."  Harry nodded, already chewing on a chip from his box as he led the way down the street.  He swallowed and then continued.  "It's called Take Away."
He hesitated just for a moment before he crossed the room and locked the door, just as Harry had told him to.  And he did have to admit, he felt better after he had done it.
"Snape?  What about him?"
"I said we can't keep doing this.  You said it was nuts.  Those were ALSO things that got said."  Draco muttered, but his eyes moved from the other boy's shoulder to his face.  Harry was so close to him now, their bare skin only inches apart.
Frowning, he picked it up, not sure who would be texting him at this time of day.  He managed a faint smile when he saw Neville's name and unlocked his phone to read the text:
"Did he give you a time limit?"  Harry eventually asked quietly, his fingers tightening around Draco's almost protectively.  A bones deep reflex that he didn't even know existed in him, but now surged through him possessively and powerfully.
Draco made a non-committal noise as he tried to decipher the words coming out of the young man's mouth.  He knew the words, he had read them, he had managed a basic understanding but he still wasn't sure...
Then she went back inside to clean the study.
“Ah...  I need to buy a computer.  A laptop.”  Draco said, turning his head away as he spoke to look around.  “I haven't a clue what to get, though, to be honest.”
"You were actually trying to find the taps I used, weren't you.  You liked it THAT much?"
“Which brings me to my last duty.”  Harry said, his thinning lips now curving up at the corners and the glint in his eye turning into something else entirely.
"I forgot I wrote that to you.  But I didn't forget that I felt it..."
"How should I---"
"Well...  It's done now.  And the chances of anyone ever doubting that I've been given excessive detentions from Snape is pretty slim.  But if they do, he'll happily say it's true.  Has he said anything to you?"
“I heard that you’ve asked Draco Malfoy to come in and have a meeting with you shortly.” She said crisply, resting her hands on the back of the chair she’d been invited to sit in.  Either preferring to stand, or she wasn’t planning to stay long.
-----------------------
"Placate me...  Kiss me to make me feel better."
“I might need it for a really fast get away from the Castle.”  Draco said, with no hesitation what so ever.
Young Auror did not seem like a doughy push over.
“I don't know what 'apps' means so I don't know what you're banning me from using right now.  Just don't tell me and I won't protest.”  Draco said with a shrug.
“Unfortunately.”  Draco muttered the word and looked down, frowning as he lightly kicked at a dusty pillow on the floor.
Draco moaned, he couldn't help it.  The feeling of Harry's bare skin, slippery under water and hot as fire above it as he pressed into him was too much not to react to.
Draco watched the other man, who was not good at hiding his feelings, so he saw the annoyance, the brief hint of anger and then the reluctant acceptance pass over his features before he spoke again.  “Fine.  But you know they aren't going to get better unless you actually talk to someone about them.”
"So how did it go?"  Harry asked, flopping down onto the hotel bed next to Draco.
------------------------
"No!!"  Draco said, shocked.  He shook his head, smacking his hands on his legs.  "That's ridiculous!"
"So you got home.  Then what?"  Draco was leaning forward now, listening to what Harry was saying avidly.
He set it on the desk and pushed it across to Harry, nodding slightly.  "Just don't read it until you go home.  I don't want you to read it in front of me..."
"The house is secured against you leaving without me."  Harry said as he came back, leaning over to see Draco's face.
“I just feel bad it took me this long to give it back.” Harry said to the other man, rubbing the odd tingles out of his hand from the jinx that had been  directed at it.
“I got too caught up in the idea of all of you needing to navigate this world that I just... Fell into looking at everything as what you could learn and how you could assimilate.  It shouldn't be up to me if you or any of the others function and behave exactly like a Muggle would.  I should just be focusing on making sure that you have what you need when you need it.  It's just...”
Ron and Hermione had been the ones to come and retrieve him.  The guards that had forcibly removed him from the meeting room wouldn't let him leave alone.
"You must be so pleased."  Draco said eventually.  His voice thick but still bitter and sharp as he looked over at Harry, his eyes red and swollen, tears still trickling down his cheeks.  "Finally caught me, haven't you."
“Oh.. Actually yeah.”  Harry said, nodding and closing his book as well.  “Nothing much but he did say he thought maybe it wasn't working because the legs on it were broken at the front and the door didn't close all the way.  He repaired those first...”  He trailed off as he realized he was speaking definitively and that was basically admitting that he
“But what....”
"He's told me that he'll do it for me.  That I don't have to do it.  Or at least not do it all by myself.  He made an Unbreakable Vow to my mother.  That if I couldn't or failed to do this task, he would do it for me."
He sighed a low breath as he watched the numbers climb on the lit panel above his head, moving out of the way as people got off on the lower floors, leaving him alone to travel the last few before he got out at the top.
Draco said nothing, sitting perfectly still as Harry moved so close to him, the hand resting on his thigh seeming to seep heat into his skin over his clothes.  He just looked at Harry, their faces only a few inches apart at this point.
Kingsley had no recollection of signing off on the paperwork to release his father from Azkaban.  He thought he might have been imperiused which meant that whoever actually wanted his father released from Azkaban was not only a very dark wizard, they wanted his father for a very specific reason.
But then he remembers something else.  Something even better and far more likely to be of sure use.
"I want to know what Draco Malfoy was looking at."  Harry said, not even bothering to try and come up with a story.  He'd taken his wand out and was pointing it, loosely held, towards Borgin.  A threat but not a strong one.  At least not yet.
Hermione snorted in a very derisive way that made Harry laugh and then she laughed with him.  "sorry, reflex."  She said, rubbing her cheek.  "They'll never get out of Azkaban.  But if they were hiding things that must mean..."  She hesitated here, her eyes flicking to Harry's face and searching it before she continued slowly.  "Perhaps Draco really did die in the Battle."
He asked in return, his brow furrowing a bit.
“This is going to Theodore Nott.”  He said as he carefully tied the parchment to the owl's leg.  “He's scared of a lot of things and you may have a hard time getting the letter to him.  Just do the best you can.  Hang around for awhile if he doesn't wave you off entirely, see if he wants to write back.  If he does, only bring it back to me when it's dark, alright?”
"Is Malfoy Manor like that?"
-------
Chapter 4 Summary-  Harry has to get some help from a most unlikely and unsavoury (to him) source.  Nothing but the desperate need of the situation and of Draco himself would give him the drive needed to do this...
“You started to turn that around in Sixth Year..”  Draco said, knowing he was treading on dangerous ground to talk about...  But he was feeling particularly self destructive right then so he just threw caution into the wind.  “Someone mentioned you got a new wand.”
Draco scrunched his mouth to one side, then huffed out a breath of air.  He was annoyed now.  Annoyed with frayed nerves and way too much on his mind.  So it was a very unpleasant face that appeared to the two men on the other wise of the door when Draco wrenched it open.
“You think it was a Horcrux?”  Draco paused for a moment then chuckled.  “I suppose I can't see how anything else would make sense when you consider all of this together...”
------------------------
Harry was silent, which Draco was pleased with.  He watched people outside of the window walk past, trying to decide just how different this world LOOKED in comparison to the Wizarding world.  He was so engrossed in trying to spot little details that he almost didn't hear Harry speak again.
Draco was laughing as he spoke, which in turn made Harry laugh as well.  He shook his head at the blonde boy, running a hand through his own hair.
"I think it is, actually..."
Draco collapsed onto the floor, his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.  Harry didn't say anything, didn't even look around.  Just kneeled down next to Draco and stayed there.
Draco sat, on the edge of a chair across from Harry after shifting some papers from the seat to the one next to him. "What's going on..."
And thus the letter, which was never actually intended for Harry to read, was sailing through the skies towards him.
that I should be grateful they're reopening Lucius' case.  And that my testimony was 'duly noted' from the first trial.  As was Draco's.  So now Lucius is coming home.  From so many years in Azkaban...  Knowing that both Draco and myself basically handed him over without a second thought in that first trial.  Heard everything we said and he's had it with him for all these years in Azkaban to dwell on."
He didn’t need to add that last bit, it was an invitation to talk about anything else.  To write and converse about things not pertaining to Draco’s son.  He shouldn’t have said it, but he couldn’t help himself.
"Why?"  Harry couldn't keep the small note of hatred from his voice, he had no desire to do anything or communicate with Snape again.  Having to go to him once was more than enough.
“Pale.  It's fashionable to be pale.”  Draco said, his words still airy but he managed a weak smile at the other man, then half gestured towards the couch before he lurched towards it.
Harry- Yes.  You have established how you feel about me coming to see you but it makes no difference.
Chapter Summary - Harry is more than sick of being in the Gryffindor Common room.  More than sick of the people there.  Really sick of Ron and Hermione...  He'd been avoiding being there as much as possible, which put him in the right place at the right time to run into Draco.  It kind of sucks that Draco seems so wary of him... But maybe he could win him over...
------------------------
"Socks.  Right..."  Draco said,  looking at the other boy strangely.
Predictably she'd gotten kicked out.  And then Borgin put the closed sign in the window.
"Want to just come in?"  Draco asked when he arrived at the house entrance, tilting his head a bit in invitation.  "Hardly anyone is up now, we can talk privately."
Harry moved as well, sitting down next to Draco and coughing at the cloud of dust he'd sent whirling into the air.  “There aren't a lot of ways to get out of Hogwarts fast.  Not like this..  You can't apparate, you can't use the Floo Network, and even if you could it's monitored, I think.”
It took a little bit and a lot of blinking before his eyes adjusted and he took in Mimir, looking up at him in obvious exasperation (Owls have a way with showing emotion, he swore to that) as he held out his leg to him with a folded parchment tied to it.
His head ached, packed so full of those cobwebs he felt his skull might crack.  He waited for the cold to come, he wanted it, wanted to pass out and wake up again.  Start this day over.  Maybe it would be better.
"I wasn't.  I'm not.."  Harry sighed, glancing his lips more firmly to Draco's again, kissing him chastely but warmly.  "Let me come inside and we can talk about it.  We shouldn't stand here only half in the door."
Was that wrong?  No...  That responsibility weighed heavily on him and probably always would.  It had changed him, though he was changed long before that.  But the war itself, it changed him entirely.
Setting it down on the coffee table, he was just about to start poking at the buttons when he heard a scuffle outside.  Scuffles were not out of the ordinary.. not really.  People got angry, people shouted, people sang drunk in the street outside the building, but this time he was quite sure he heard his name.
"You never asked."
No...  That wasn't right...
He hadn't heard about Harry and Ginny.  But then, Astoria didn't keep him up to date on gossip anymore.  Both because he wasn't really one to enjoy it and because of the fact that she was, in fact, rarely present in his life either.
"That's the last of them.
Harry, however, didn't even flinch.  He reached over and put a hand over Draco's on the couch, letting out a soft breath.  “That's a pretty nasty thing to make you do.  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised given it's...  Well it's Voldemort.”
"What is it, Harry?" Dumbledore asked, raising his eyebrows slightly.
Executive he was, much like Dean had been.  Wearing such tailored suits, talking absolute drivel with his co-workers, caring about things that he never thought he'd care about.
But slowly he came out of it.
(Some events line up to the Canon book 6, and some don't as we start to deviate down a different path.)
Fuck.  Fuck fuck FUCK.  Draco clenched his jaw tight enough to make his teeth ache, realizing that Harry had totally and completely played him.  Even if he'd really meant the snake comment as an insult, all he'd really done was say he was a Slytherin.  And Draco had absolutely exploded at him and earned himself a nasty detention that had lasted well into the night.
Chapter Summary - Now that Harry has managed to find an excuse to disappear all the time, he and Draco meet again in the Room of Requirement to try and hammer out a plan to get communication to Narcissa.  A plan to keep her safe, and hopefully Draco as well....
"Well, you live and you learn.  And really...  I don't 'go out' places all that often as it is.  It's not like us getting together privately is going to put a crimp in my lifestyle."
Harry- It's... like... a place to get information and... Actually it's hard to describe.
There was a fourth person rushing over now.  Squinting Draco was pretty sure it was Neville which was oddly reassuring (not that he wanted to admit to that).  Within a very short amount of time of Neville joining the altercation everyone settled down again.  He was speaking to the Aurors, and then to the person they had been trying to detain.
"You can't ever have something just for yourself.  Are you REALLY like that or is just an act?" Draco asked,  his expression more curious and open than it ever was when faced with Harry Potter.
Draco muttered that he felt like HE should be the one getting paid for all the work he had to do just getting things out of the store.
“No he might.  Maybe.. I just...  I...  I haven't spoken to him.. since before the Battle at Hogwarts...”
“You asked about Horcruxes and then the memory got all foggy and we could just hear Slughorn yelling at you about how terrible it was to ask about Horcruxes and things like that.  That was it, though.”
He was met with silence after he spoke and he carefully turned his head to look up at Harry.  When he saw the other man's face he couldn't help but laugh.
So he agreed.  He signed whatever papers they shoved at him, agreed to pack whatever he wanted to bring to fill a two bedroom flat (furniture not required), and sent them on their way happy that they had gotten the job done.
“What would the point of that be?”  Harry tried to look confused, even though his brain was screaming joyously.
He had used it tonight, a risk so large that Harry was torn between being angry and being scared when he saw the pale glow of the small fox bound through the woods towards him.  He was on watch while Hermione slept.  Ron had left a week and a half ago.  Both of them were so tired of trying to talk and act like normal that bedtime had started coming sooner and sooner.  That was the only reason Harry was alone right then sitting outside.  In a less stressful situation, he would have had company.
"Anything I have to say about this I've said to Draco.  You and I have no need to talk to each other."
“What I mean is, I appreciate the work you've put into this.”
Six Weeks After the War
Harry hissed out softly in parseltongue, smiling almost lovingly at the snake that immediately relaxed, seeming to ripple against Draco's forearm and move it's head towards Harry's finger then instead of away from it.
Luckily the work was engrossing and he quickly lost himself in it,  forgetting that he wasn't alone as Harry was working silently across the floor from him.  He made it halfway through the assignment before he started to run into problems.  He moved the telescope around in the quadrant of sky he was supposed to be observing, unable to locate what he was looking for not matter how carefully he looked or slowly he moved across the small space of sky.
Harry smiled a bit and shrugged his shoulders, something about his eyes a little darker than normal.  "I feel oddly disconnected like this.  I wish I could be more involved again."
Draco gave Paul a tight smile, then got some help bringing his cake back to his bench, watching the rest of his competitors take their turns as well.
"Draco.." Harry tilted his head a bit as he looked at the other boy silently for a few moments.  "The thing is that...  So many people are sacrificing themselves for me.  So that I can face off against Voldemort.  I didn't ask for this life, I didn't sign up of volunteer for it.  But the heart of the thing is that if I had just died when Voldemort cursed me, none of this would be happening right now."
"Draco, please.  I'll do whatever you want here.  We can talk about it.  We can not talk about it.  I can forget all of it...  Just put it out of my mind.  It was years ago, tensions and stress and everything, I know that must have been part of it.  I don't have to take it seriously.."
"This is for Harry Potter and for Neville Longbottom."  A fourth year girl timidly held out small scrolls of paper to both of the named boys, then all but fled back up the walkway.
The fourth day he got a letter from Harry, short and to the point, asking him to come to Grimmauld Place.
“And through that you managed to learn to cook quite well?”  Draco pushed his hair out of his face, then picked up a piece of bacon to bite into.  “Your wife must be pleased to have a husband who cooks...”
Tom took a step forward, closing most of the distance between him and Harry, close enough that he could drop his voice down to a near whisper as he spoke again.  “What do you think about them?”
It took every ounce of strength Draco had not to roll his eyes at Paul as he seemed to relish taking the knife to cut down through the layers of his cake, immediately undoing the perfect work he'd done.
He reached across from his chair, over the table to slide his hand onto Draco's arm.  He didn't know what to say to the other boy and somehow reaching out to him felt natural.  It had right from the start of this whole debacle.  He slid his hand down to Draco's wrist, as far as he could reach without leaning himself right out over the table.  Draco's arm moved and at first Harry thought he was pulling away, but then long cool fingers found his own and entwined with them, squeezing them as he clearly tried to pull himself together again.
“Of all the stupid, idiotic, harebrained...”  Harry finished striding forward and held his hand out.  “Give it back.”
wanted to pick a fight with you...”
"I really don't know."
Tom finally broke his gaze from Draco to get to his feet, smoothing out his hair as he smiled at the two boys.  “I must go.  But we'll be in touch.”
He took the letter and set it on the table, tapping his fingers against it.  He almost didn't want to read it.  The final words from Harry that dissolved this communication and sent them back to their own lives, apart again...
"Ron!!"  Hermione threw her napkin at her husband, acting terribly offended even though both of them, and Harry a few moments later, were all laughing.
Poor Borgin...
“The Astronomy Tower, that night.  Your memory...  I knew you were looking at me.”
"It isn't about that, it's about Draco."  Harry managed to keep one hand loose at his side, though the other balled into a fist in anger.
A galleon.  He chuckled to himself, turning it over in his fingers, shaking his head.  Of course a Malfoy wouldn't leave any bit of money sitting to collect dust when it could be pocketed.  Even a single galleon.
"We haven't exactly been on terms where asking a question like that would be appropriate and not weird."
from it all.”
There's a hint about what was happening with the ring in an earlier chapter.  That's all I'll say about it's whereabouts. ;)
But she never seemed to have anything bad to say.  Never had a complaint.  He brought them both food.  Water.  In that dank dungeon, no light, no air...
“Whoa...”  He turned on the spot to look around him, only stopping when he realized Draco had stopped as well and was fidgeting worriedly next to him.  “Sorry.. It's just never ever looked like this for me.  Why is this what you need from it?”
He startled then, sitting up quickly and making Harry jump.  His cheeks flooded as he looked at the other man, swallowing thickly and then forcing out a chuckle as he reflexively raised his hands to his hair to smooth down.
They fell silent, but a comfortable sort of silent that was easy and companionable.
“No, I wouldn't have...”
“I did...”  Draco said, his voice tight as he looked back at Harry, hating how utterly casual the other man was acting.  Like they were cordial enough to stop in shops and have a chat and a catch up whenever they saw each other.
No matter where he was.
Much further away Draco gets another letter through his fireplace.  One he always thought he would be relieved to get, but now that it's in his hands, he just feels kind of sick...
Draco scowled, yanking his leg away when Harry tugged the pyjama cuff on Draco's closest leg.  He scowled harder when the dark haired boy laughed.
He'd wanted to take it and go straight to Malfoy Manor as soon as the sale was complete, but he was all too aware of that maybe looking a little too strange.  Too eager.  And he had to be careful about how he approached this purchase.
“Draco?”
"It's no trouble at all."  Draco said, nodding with a smile to Harry.  "I'll come back and help you with the rest of the house soon."
She excused herself, but not before straightening a curtain with her hand and cleaning smudges off his classroom door with her wand.  Leaving Harry to once again lapse off into deeper thoughts.   He really hadn’t wanted to contact Draco and ask him to come in.  Not really.  If he was completely honest he did want to see him again, but not in circumstances like this.  But that was only if he was honest with himself, and most of the time he didn’t allow himself the luxury of that particular honesty.
Draco struggled for a moment more then stopped.  Then sighed, then let his head tip down against the floor.  "I hate the both of you."
“To threaten you.”
"Hello Draco."  She said cooly, resting one elbow on the desk, touching a finger to her chin.  "I believe we need to talk."
He got his cakes back out again when it was time, managing through two more conversations with Noel and one with him and Sandi both.  He set to work trying to carefully alternate between using his wand and the rest of his knowledge to get his cake assembled.  The worst was the fondant.  There was no spell to smooth it all at once, he had to mime like he was doing it himself with the paddle thing all while the wrinkles and cuts and pieces shifted and moved and settled themselves magically.  It was a wonder he didn't get caught at that since a few people were near done and conversations had broken out around him.
"I told you what you wanted to know!"
And to think Draco had tried to say that Harry was the brilliant one....
He felt cold creeping up through him, starting in his hands and feet.  Sometimes it didn't get this bad.  Sometimes he could avoid this part of it, breathe through it, get enough air in that his system didn't shock like this.  Not this time, though, and he braced himself for the cold to overtake him entirely, waited for darkness to close him, that was at least an end to this.  He'd come to in awhile.  He could deal with the fall out, the 'after shocks' of a panic attack, later.
Imagine...  People, good people like Neville, standing around the street outside his building all day.  All night.  And for what?  His safety?  The nasty Auror the day before had been the one who was right.  He should be left to take his chances.  If someone was trying to hunt him down, he deserved to be found.
He moved, seeing Slughorn and followed Tom's instructions, creeping around until he was hidden completely from view of the other two, but he could see them.
"What??"  Harry asked, his brow creasing in confusion.
Draco stop talking then, furrowing his eyebrows a bit at the look Harry was giving him. "What?"
Draco chewed the inside of his lower lip, looking uncertain for a moment before the corners of his lips curled up a bit and he looked down again.  “You weren't the only one who felt completely at odds with the weird 'attraction', Harry.  I wouldn't have admitted it then for anything.  And I know you wouldn't have either.”
He bit at Harry's lower lip and was rewarded with a groan and a particularly hard grind against him, forcing out a moan and a gasp of his own, his head jerking back and thumping against the tree, their lips breaking with a slick heated noise.
He turned, looking around the massive echoing chamber filled with so many cast off, discarded things and things-that-needed-to-be-hidden.  “I don't know that I trust to talk REALLY openly in here for very long.  We don't know everything that's in here.  We don't know what walls have ears and such...”
“Shh...”  Harry cut the other boy off, tilting his head a bit as he heard soft footsteps, like someone was trying to sneak up on them.  Sticking his head out from the doorway he immediately spotted Snape who was far too close for comfort.  He made a decidedly nasty face at the older man, stepping out from the doorway and tugging Draco with him.  “Something you needed, Professor?”
All of them sealed and all with Harry's name on the front as though he really did expect to send them.
“Don't be.  I shouldn't have gotten married.  Harry was the same way.”
"I know, right?  They were my Uncle's.  He has no taste in clothing..."
Where was that?  WHAT was that?  There was never warmth when it was this bad, just the cold and the dark and the inevitable gasp when he woke again.
Draco spit the words out as he walked into the Prefects bathroom and found Harry in the massive swimming pool of a tub.  He forgot in that moment that he was completely naked as he glared at the dark haired boy.
He walked in, closing the door behind him and handing off his coat to the House Elf when she greeted him greeted him, asking for a cup of tea in his study when she had a moment.  He was deep in pondering what he could do for his own House Elf that could possibly make her look as blissfully happy as Kreacher did that day, but his thoughts were rudely interrupted when he stepped into the study and realized he wasn't alone.
Smoothing it out, he took in a breath of surprise.  His eyes whipped over the words several times, trying to make them make sense when they didn't...  Or rather, they made sense as they were written but the content of them was not anything Draco expected to read.  Not from Theodore or anyone, for that matter...
“Sorry.  I know about...”  Draco tilted his head a bit, clearly not wanting to say Sirius' name, and Harry was honestly quite grateful for that.  “She'll likely be one of the first to be killed if that makes you feel better.  Either because she gets sloppy thinking she's above everyone else, or she'll be murdered because she won't shut up about how close she is with the Dark Lord.”
“And I was always under the impression you really liked him.”
And he...  He couldn't see Harry.  Couldn't write to him, either.  There would be no more communication.  No more anything.
“I came over here for a reason...”  He shifted on his feet, then dug into his coat pocket, coming out with a loosely held fist that extended over to Harry.  He bobbed it slightly, inclining his head in a nod and a gesture that said 'take it'.  Harry held out his hand and Draco's opened over it, dropping a gold chain that was strung with a tiny golden snitch.
Draco's face fell and Harry felt like an asshole for making it happen when he had looked so happy and so hopeful for a few moments.
He remembered panicking when he saw Ron and Hermione dragged through the door.  His heart had plummeted to his feet when he saw they didn't have the messy haired, green eyed, lightning scarred third to their group.  But then he saw the other boy, looked at his swollen face and realized it was Harry.
Then he scrunched it into a ball with the envelope and hurled it into the fire.
Draco sighed as he signed his name, sitting for a moment as the ink dried.  He'd written dozens of these letters over the years.  The first one just days after the war ended.  He wanted to talk to Harry.  He felt like he absolutely NEEDED to and would burst if he didn't.  He actually fully intended to mail that first letter to him.
The next morning as Draco sat down at the table, empty aside from himself and the cup of coffee waiting for him, his owl soared through the window and landed lightly on the table.  One leg held out with another letter, Draco's name on it in Harry's writing.
But Harry was not going to be put off by that.
Harry smiled at that.  He couldn't help it, there was something so strange and delightful about speaking to 'Tom'.
Draco's door banged against the wall as it burst open, slamming shut again a few moments later.  He sighed, catching sight of Harry striding in out of the corner of his eye.
"I need to go deliver McGonagall's message."  Draco said abruptly, turning without another word to head up the stairs.  He was thoroughly rattled and needed to think about all of this.
"Yes..." Draco said quietly, rubbing a hand over his face.  "Yes he will."
Draco huffed, muttering under his breath as he went to the far side of the observation tower, flicking one of the telescopes as he tried to get himself settled and focused on the work at hand rather than the Boy Who Lived.
"Do I what?"  Draco looked up to Harry's face again curiously.
Harry smiled a little as Draco trailed off, reaching other to squeeze a hand against the side of his arm.  "Which made you worry more?  Adults have a way of doing that..."
“I wanted to pick a fight with you.”  Draco smirked a bit, looking down.  “I
Year 7-  This was their last chance, maybe their only chance.  When Draco finds Harry in the woods where he was camping with Hermione, they take what little time they have to be together.
--------
Harry raised both hands with a sharp sigh and went out the door.  “Lock this behind me!”  He called, his final parting words.
Harry and Draco practice an incredibly important skill.
It had been seven years since the war.  Seven years of peace...  At least, seven years of peace so long as Draco didn't try to go outside too much.  Some people still held grudges.  Even with his entire story out there for public consumption, some people still held tight to old convictions.
A covert trip to the Slytherin Dungeons to find Draco and persuade him to take the helpful item turns into a deep conversation.  A discussion of changing alignment.  And the return of a proposition made many years ago...
With a long, low shaky breath, Draco sat up again, shifting his chair forward and back to the desk.  He touched the letter Harry had sent him, just lightly with his fingers, then pulled another sheet of parchment forward.
"Oh shut UP, you deranged old BAT!"
"The bottom tier is a french toast inspired cake, the middle is two half layers of raspberry with cream between them and the top tied is a coffee cake flavour."
Eventually their mouths parted with a soft noise, Harry's hand shifting through the strands of Draco's hair, letting them spill slowly from between his fingers.  But his brows knit when he saw the look on Draco's face.  "What..?"
Harry said the words quietly and warmly as he looked at Draco who was still keeping his eyes down.  He reached across the couch cushion, sliding his hand over the back of Draco's lightly.  He didn't say anything but smiled when Draco's hand turned over and his long cool fingers slid between the spaces of his own.
They were convenient to each other then, and neither of them knew anyone else who had the same preferences as they did, which meant, at the time, it was each other or nothing.
"Not so easy when Snape isn't teaching it, huh?"  Harry said with a sneer so well executed that would have made Draco jealous if he hadn't done it at his back.
Draco rolled the piece of parchment into a tight scroll, holding it for a few moments so that when he set it down it loosened but didn't unfurl completely, then poked it with his wand and muttered a few words, glancing over his shoulder at Harry as the scroll dropped to the floor and skidded across it, stopping when it hit Harry's foot.  Once Harry leaned down to retrieve it Draco turned forward again.
Harry twitched his wand toward Draco again and released the bindings.  Draco groaned as he shifted to sit up, rolling his shoulders and his head with a sigh.  "You could have just secured the house against me without me knowing once I got here.  Then told me I had to stay."
"Then what?"
"It's no problem.  I'm more than a little concerned that things are missing from Malfoy Manor myself."  Hermione said, sitting back down behind her desk.  "No one should have been able to get in, and depending on what's been taken...  It could be bad news."
“Alright...  Well what do you want to use it for?”
Draco leaned over to tie the letter to the leg of his owl once it was sealed and Harry's name was on the front.
He still could be imperius'd though.
He stopped walking, tracing his fingers along the lines in his skin and smiled, realizing this was a nod, a pat on the shoulder almost, to say he wasn't alone.
“I don't know.”  Harry said, his eyes narrowing further as anger bubbled in his insides.  “Should we judge you by your parents?”
"Nothing right now.  Just more information than you have.  Right now you have a bunch of questions and suspicions but no means to answer them.  And if you get them answered you may have a better idea of what to do next."
“You know I wouldn't have if it wasn't absolutely necessary...  Silly chicken.  I wouldn't hand you off for no good reason.”  He stroked the owl's chest, so incredibly happy in that moment.
“That’s what they had you doing?”
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
"It's a link to Voldemort."  Harry said, stroking his finger against the snake's head, then pulling Draco's sleeve back down, not wanting to leave it on display like that for too long.  "I suppose it might be a little like my scar.  It doesn't hurt anymore but only because Voldemort found out how it works.  It's too bad..."
"There are many ways to send a message, but I think the path needing the least amount of magic will mean the least ability to trace anything.  An owl to send a message to Draco's mother is without a doubt the best way to go.  We shall get an owl, but Draco must not touch it.  He also must not touch the parchment we write the message on."
It was a few hours after Harry had unearthed the socks.  He'd waited until everyone was asleep in his dorm and chanced that the Slytherins stayed up later before making his way quickly and quietly down to the dungeons.
“Have Fenrir Greyback pay him a visit.”  Harry said, then laughed when Draco startled.  “I
Harry turned to go with him, following close behind Draco, close enough to he could whisper, close enough that he could slide his fingers against the inside of Draco's palm.
He gushed on about deciding he needed to start acting like he didn't care, and that he wanted to be friends with Malfoy.  That he'd needed to make it look as believably as possible otherwise he'd never get anywhere.  And oh he was just SO sorry and could she and Ron EVER forgive him...
"I like new experiences."  Draco said with a shrug, smiling a little more warmly and genuinely at Harry.  "I don't know that I'd ever have the opportunity to do something like this without someone like you with me."
“A lot more.”  Draco said, nodding a bit and letting out a low breath, turning his attention to the food Neville had put down.  “So.  Breakfast... Or..”  He leaned forward a bit, looking around Neville to see the clock.  “I suppose 'Brunch' would be more appropriate.”
Part of him thought he should be surprised like Dumbledore thought he should have been as well.  He thought maybe he should be surprised that Dumbledore was not intending to live past the end of the year.  But with it laid out the way it was in the letter he saw how everything that had happened so far that year added up to that.  That somewhere inside of himself, the pieces clicked in and he saw it perfectly and sensibly laid out.
Harry barely had time for another breath before Snape's hand closed in his robes and he hauled him inside, pushing him against the wall as he slammed the door shut.
-------------------------------------
“Well I appreciate the honesty.  I suppose.  But could you listen please, this is important..”  Harry exhaled a sharpish breath of air, clearly nearing his threshold for putting up with Draco's bullshit.
“No, Harry.. Of course not..”  Draco looked down then, at the map in Harry's hand, then at the floor again, then back up to the other boy's face.  He stayed silent thinking...  considering...  Then shifted, sliding back out of the windowsill.  “Come with me.”
ANYONE but Potter...
------------------------
“Yes.  And Scorpius’ as well?”  Harry turned to look at the train, his eyes landing on each of his children before straying to Draco’s pale blonde son.  “Strange to think they’ll be in the same year like we were.”
Harry tried to speak gently but with conviction, sliding forward a bit on the floor to put a hand over Draco's shoulder again.  The other boy jerked like he was trying to get away from Harry, but then relaxed a moment later.
"Sorry, I didn't think it was that important.  Not like you didn't know we would need a new teacher for Defence Against the Dark Arts.  We do every year."
Snape jerked his head towards the door, then turned on his heel to stalk towards it without another word.  With a sigh of exasperation, Draco followed.  He didn't know if this would be about being there with Harry, or about the task Voldemort had set him.  But either topic wasn't one Draco felt like getting into.
Harry
Harry, it seemed, was in somewhat of the same boat, although he and Ginny clearly didn't feel the requirement to appear together for the family.  Different families and different circumstances, though...
“Right...  But what do you want to do on the internet?”
“Harry...  Whatever it is you've been going through...  You can talk to me.”  She looked at him so earnestly, so clearly hopeful.
Again, that was twice he'd thought that.  'IF he'd wanted to get away'.  And he didn't.
Harry turned the scroll for Draco over his his hands, then carefully tucked it into the pocket of his jeans, looking back to Dumbledore with a nod.  "I will, sir.  And thank you."
“It's going to be awful.”  Harry said, almost before Draco had even finished saying 'but'.  “I know.  But we'll get what we need and then we can be even more free to plan and to talk.”
The low voice made Harry jump, turning to see Draco standing just behind him.
Chapter Summary -  Potter is sending him owls.  Potter is sending him incredibly RUDE owls.  But he's also inviting him out, just to talk...  And that doesn't sound so bad, actually.
Harry nodded with what Dumbledore said, understanding what he meant.  That Narcissa and Draco had to act like they were perfectly comfortable and even pleased at the prospect of winning back their favour with Voldemort because if it was thought they didn't want that, they would no longer be of any use.
Neville seemed to easily give him space and wasn't watching him closely or trying to teach him anything now.  They were just out for a walk, as he promised, which gave Draco a chance to look around the street.  Much like the building his flat was in, he had only sort of looked at the outside world when Harry had dragged him around.  He had memorized enough landmarks that he couldn't get lost, but he hadn't paid close attention to the big picture.
Harry's voice broke the silence and Draco thumped his head back against the door, his eyes actually pricking a bit as he chewed harder against his lower lip.
"Ugh..  They freak me out."  Draco said with a bit of a shudder.  "I liked it better when I couldn't see them."
Draco was quiet for a second, smiling after that moment of thought.  Warmed in a different way now as it was clear Harry had no intentions of getting riled up by whatever venom his mother spouted at him.  Or
Maybe he just needed to ask for a little help from the other side of the memory.
When they got back upstairs, the other Aurors had dispersed, but Beaming Young Auror had left him a note that he read with a smile.  Beaming Young Auror seemed to think him perfectly capable of understanding basic skills without being led around like a puppy.  His note was instructions and directions on something called the television, as well as where they had put away all his food.
Harry looked at the other man for a few moments caught between not understanding and anger, but as he did little snippets of memory filtered to him and he was sure right then that what Draco's eyes had wandered to, he was seeing the same now.  He remembered.  Tried hard to forget, but he remembered, he knew when Draco had taken it. He didn't really understand fully why he had, but now he knew when.
"Then enlighten me,
"It was pretty."  Harry eventually said still not looking at the other boy.
The older man wrote quickly and efficiently, as though he had wanted this opportunity and had thought about what he might say if given the chance.   In all it took about fifteen minutes for him to finish.  He rolled and tied the parchment but did not seal it, passing it to Harry with a smile that spoke of trust and good intentions.
“Harry's right.”  Hermione said with a nod.  “We have to at least assume that Borgin is making some attempt at fixing it.  I wonder if we could figure out just how easy they are to fix...”
“Well there's two options the way I see it.”  Harry said, raising his eyebrows slightly. “Either we find a way to get you out of having to kill him...” he paused, his fingers moving to pass through the strands of hair that covered the back of Draco's neck.  He leaned in just a little closer to speak more quietly, one side of his mouth quirking up very slightly.
--------------------------
It may have been close.  It may have been far.  It was always so hard to tell what was going on around him.
Harry paused as he was finishing cramming last minute bits and pieces into his trunk, wishing he'd listened to Mrs Weasley the night before to make sure he was done.
Harry said, his voice a little lower than before.  A tone that made a tingle slither up Draco's back for some reason as he raised his head to meet the dark haired man's eyes.
He stuttered when he spoke.  Uncertain in his uncertainty when he wouldn't name Harry for sure.
Neville smiled (as usual) when he spoke, glancing at Draco over his shoulder.  If he had noticed the change of clothes, he at least had the good grace not to mention it.
He was halfway to the door when he realized how foolish that was.  He was under the Ministry's protection and he was going to rush outside because some stranger was shouting about him while the Aurors were trying to contain him?  Harry would have had a field day reading him the riot act about that...
They both stayed silent as they redressed, then stood and looked at each other.  It wasn't awkward, they were both trying to delay the inevitable.
Neville arched one eyebrow, setting his mug down and chuckling.  “Being Pureblood doesn't mean you can't know things about Muggles.  I may not have known a thing about living as a Muggle while we were in school, but I learned afterwards.”
Scorpius was everything Draco and everything not.  He was just as blonde, just as silver eyed and just and perfectly put together, but his features were soft, he had a roundness to his face and a smile in his eyes that might have changed a lot of things if Draco had had the same when he held a hand out to Harry that first year.
-------
"Why would Draco confide in you?"  He asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.
“That's kind of it, isn't it?  I think this is the whole stupid drawn out point and information Dumbledore is trying to impart to me.”  Harry drummed his fingertips on the arm of the couch, his brows knitting together after a few moments.  “How many Horcruxes can a person make?  How ARE they made?”
"I'm still going.  And I'm going to have to act a lot more friendly if I expect to get away with seeming like nothing has changed."
"I suppose you're right."  Harry bobbed his head a couple of times slowly, his eyes turned down to look at Draco's hand on his knee.  "And now we're both.. Well I suppose you're still married but you're also not."
“I'm sorry.”  Harry eventually said, meeting Draco's eyes and very much looking sorry.  “You're... Absolutely right.”
The rest of the lunch was without any particular interest.  Slughorn was asking a lot of questions, clearly using them to decide who he was most interested in and who he had judged poorly and would not be included in future gatherings.
“Fit of some kind.”  Draco interrupted, waving a hand dismissively as he got up and sat down on the edge of the couch again.  “My blood sugar must be low or something, I didn't have dinner or breakfast.”
"I'm not."  Draco shook his head, smiling a bit.  "I know Astoria dates.  I don't spend a lot of time with Scorpius but he tells me about them.  On paper we're legally married but that's just a piece of paper."
"Sorry."  Harry said, his head pulling back only a fraction, his hand staying on Draco's leg.
Year 6 - April, 1997 - Before
“Not at all creepy.”  Draco said sarcastically, the snarky tone to his voice finally starting to return as he looked back at the dark haired man. “I know they are.  But how would you have felt, back before the wa-..”  Draco stopped, closing his eyes for a moment and exhaling a breath as he couldn't manage to choke out that single syllable.  Not right now, anyways. “...back when you were a target, if someone tucked you away in a flat somewhere, took your wand and assured you that OTHER people were looking out for your safety.”
"I'm starting to think that's all anyone can ever do."  Draco said quietly, looking at his hands in his lap.  "Trusting unlikely sources has actually done me a fair bit of good in this mess.  If I hadn't, I wouldn't be sitting here with you."
Draco felt odd accepting that gesture and thinking that it was real.  Better to stop the connection now.
“Who is it?  That you have to kill.”
"Until she was taking her leave.  Just before she left she said 'I trust you're keeping your nose out of my son's business, Mr. Potter.  It would serve you well to do so.'"
"No it wasn't, actually.  It was not what I expected you to smell like, but it wasn't awful.  Happy now?"
“Yes.  Electronics.  Like the television and the phone.  I was in the store to see them all and I want more of them.”
“Merlin.  Longbottom.  You scared me half to death.”
“He didn't tell me why, but he said he needed it for a fast get away.”  Harry frowned as he spoke, trying to look confused by it before turning to look at Hermione.  “But how could that give him a fast get away?  Aren't Vanishing Cabinets are just for like... You know.  Vanishing things?”  He waved his hands a bit, quirking one side of his mouth up and hoping he was doing a good job of the 'clueless boy' act that Hermione always seemed to feed off of.
He had to do.. well.. SOMEthing soon, or everyone would notice that he was just standing there like an idiot.  He had learned the basics of the Muggle baking.. machine things... before his audition tape.  Harry pointed out that he needed to because it was about the baking.  And as impressive as Muggles would find his 'special magic tricks' that made it look like he was conjuring food out of thin air, it wouldn't be enough to get him a spot.  He had to look like he was baking, even if he wasn't.
“Sure you could.” Draco said, his eyes dancing as they met Harry’s.  “I wish you would, actually.  Once again acting against me without true reason.”
"You smell sweet.  Like candy or cookies or something."
"Are you injured or half dead or sick?"  Harry's voice sounded closer now, sitting where they were.  He figured they were likely close to back to back with the door between them.
"Yeah but I don't know when they're coming for me.  I can't be in the middle of being attacked and be like 'oh sorry, could you wait a minute while I go dig out an ugly pair of socks and take some potion?'  Having 12 hours of good luck at some random time isn't going to help me.  YOU, though.  You have a ticking clock over your head.  You need this."
That made Tom smile a little.  Just enough that it actually reached his eyes, which was rare.
He shook his head at the look Draco gave him that seemed to imply he was being overdramatic.
Harry smiled, wiggling one arm up to smooth his palm over Draco’s cheek, looking into his abnormally happy face.  “I still don’t think your parents really....” He trailed off on his own that time, not wanting to say it, but also unable to help at least partially voicing his feelings about Draco’s parents and their allegiance and true beliefs.
"I am not, under any circumstance, sharing a bedroom with you, Potter."
"I don't think he really had friends." Harry said, knowing that both from what Dumbledore had said and the obvious way Tom had acted in the memories he'd seen.  "But we certainly would have wanted to be and tried to believe we were.  He seemed to have that effect on people..."
"Don't... stop..." He gasped out, long since past caring about appearances or pride or looking in control, not when Harry could do this to him.  Nothing else mattered right then, just the way he felt, the way Harry felt.
"How about...  'onyx as the same density as Longbottom and therefore never more than a few powdered granules should be used at once in a Fast-Night Cloaking spell?"
Harry moved his hand up, covering Draco's mouth with his palm.  He smiled at him after a couple of moments of silence passed, then spoke with his hand still over his mouth.
"We have a lot to catch up on."  Harry said in return, smiling back at the other man.  "There's been quite a few years between Hogwarts and now where we never saw each other aside from the train.  And there wasn't much information passed in the polite nods we gave each other."
“Ah, you have big mugs, thank Merlin..”  Neville said, the smile audible in his voice even before Draco turned to see him.
"He means it..." Harry said softly, ducking his head a bit to speak close to Draco's ear.  "Every word of it.  I sat right there in front of him while he wrote it.  He did it so fast...  Like he'd been thinking about what to say to you for ages and he finally had the chance."
That seemed to placate her and she returned to her book without further comment.  Time and experience meant Harry knew she wasn't done with the subject as a whole, she was probably just mulling things over.
When Draco's disappearance filtered to Harry, he caused more than one scene over it.  In Diagon Alley, at the Ministry, in front of his best friends...
------------------------------------
”  This time Draco's words weren't just sharp, they were venomous, all his patience for the do-gooder in front of him rapidly disappearing.
"But what does it do?"
They both picked up their sacks of trinkets and carted them back downstairs.  Draco got to watch as Harry gave them both to Kreacher and told him he could decorate the basement with any that he wanted.
Draco smiled back at Harry, giving him a wave before he turned on the spot and apparated back to Malfoy Manor.
“Do I need to?” McGonagall asked, raising his eyebrows at Harry, then smiling in tight satisfaction when he shook his head.  “I didn’t think so.  Contrary to what you might feel being back here, Potter, you are an adult and a teacher now.  I trust my teachers to do what they feel is right.”
"You're sure it's gone?"  Ron asked, looking up from where he had couch cushions on the floor of the Gryffindor common room, looking under them to see if Harry had lost the ring in the depths of the furniture.
"Thank you most kindly."  He said to the house, patting the doorframe as though it was a pet.  He didn't know if that was needed, but he felt it wouldn't hurt to treat the house with a little respect and care.
“Heavy conversation.” Draco said after a moment which made Harry laugh, not pushing the topic further since it was, it had to be a said, a little out of place.
--------------------------
"New Professor."  Harry said, then frowned as he looked at Ron and Hermione who were staring at him.  "What?"
The coin had never been his.  He had never been in Dumbledore's Army, whatever secrets it had, they wouldn't reveal to him, and it had never been a lucky charm.  Not really.
“I don't need any instruction on that.”  Draco said, nodding his head.  “I don't need to do it and show you I know how do I?”
"Yeah, Dumbledore expects me to so I better just to cover my trail.  But the bits about him personally?  That's just between you and me."
"Seems that way.  He showed me one of Slughorn's memories but it's been really tampered with.  It had Tom and some of his friends and Slughorn.  Tom stayed behind after everyone had left and asked Slughorn about Horcruxes.  Then the memory goes all wonky because Slughorn wanted to hide whatever he actually said to Tom.  In the messed up memory he basically tells him to get lost... Dumbledore wants me to get the real memory from Slughorn."
“This really is a dream.”  Draco said incredulously, moving to the front doors and laughing a bit in shock when he smoothed a hand where the door knob should have been.  “I guess we're staying in.”
"Some of it wouldn't matter much or be proof to Voldemort.  But if you can remember a few things to tell him... if you have SAFE opportunity to tell him.."  Harry leaned his head in a bit, taking the end of Draco's school tie and giving it a small tug for emphasis.  "Tell him that Dumbledore showed me the Gaunt house.  That I know his mother wore Salazar Slytherin's locket.  That the ring with the black stone, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on it, was once on Marvolo's hand, but now it's sitting in Dumbledore's office."  Harry paused for a moment, letting out a soft breath before continuing even more quietly.  "And tell him that in a box in his wardrobe he had a harmonica, a silver thimble, and a red yo-yo."
He nodded, fiddling with the quill he had been using to mark with before she came in.  He did know it was out of the ordinary.  And part of him knew this was something he could have handled over owl if he’d wanted to.  But he hadn’t wanted to.  He wanted to talk to Draco face to face.
"Thank you, Paul."  Draco said with an equally unenthused smile, shaking Paul's hand in return but letting go of it quickly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You're welcome."  Harry said, smiling at Draco.
“It sound like it...”  Draco chewed the inside of his lower lip, watching Harry and starting to smile when he saw the look on his face, unable to help laughing.  “Merlin...  You look thrilled...”
Prue pronounced every layer superb, she liked how the flavours worked together, thought it genius that the raspberry was in the middle and so refreshing and not too sweet between the french toast flavoured layer and the coffee cake.
Josh laughed. It told Draco everything he wanted to know. He turned and pulled at the leash without looking back. He felt Harry scrambling to his feet.
You go to Paris on a three-day case assignment. You come back with a mind to take a long bath and floo in sick for the rest of the week.
One minute goes by, two. It’s excruciating, but you won’t move unless he tells you to.
He looks at me like he wants this piece of information to sink in. But it already did. Months ago. It made me happy in a strange way. And now he all but confessed he’s only sleeping with me. Which I obviously know because I’m there every night, sleeping right next to him. But the fact that he just said it, that he wants to make sure I know he’s not seeing anyone else- that there’s
Harry loved to wait there while the men discussed him. The idea of men appraising him, deciding what they wanted to do to him, while he had minimum say in it, made him feel completely free.
‘Want your cock inside me… I want it so badly. Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, please…’
‘You Slytherins are fucking devious,’ he said. He rubbed his chin over Draco’s cheek.
to break.
The party is over.
Three hours and ten shots of Firewhisky later, I was taking my time alright. Namely, by sucking Harry Potter’s cock, in a rather dreary & dirty bathroom stall, with no thought to spare for Andrew, expensive diamond rings or the world at large.
‘Kiss me like you’ve been wanting to all this time,’ I say it against his mouth. I don’t tell him it’s what I’ve been wanting, too.
‘Yes. Please.’
‘I’m here, Harry…’
I don’t even let him finish. I’m on him, his back to the wall, my everything against his whole body. We’ve been this close only three times before.
His mouth fell open obediently. Draco let the tip of his cock slide inside, but Harry pulled back again, flushed and desperate.
And it’s all in there, so suddenly obvious I’m surprised I didn’t get it before.
He won’t, he’ll refuse, it’ll sound too intimate, and that’s not what this is.
‘And?’
‘Use your mouth, Harry,’ Draco said. ‘Heard it’s your best asset. So show me.’
Content warning: aftermath of rape; non-graphic mentions of rape.
‘I- I love it.’ I say. ‘I more than love it.’
Josh adjusted behind Harry and then snapped his hips forward, slow, hard. The movement jerked Draco out of his near-reverie. Harry’s lips brushed over Draco’s cock for a long, painful second. Harry
One year and one night of shared silence and dark is something powerful. That’s what you learn exactly one year and one night later.
‘You like this, don’t you?’
He turns you both around and your back is against the wall. He steps back, his lips red and moist from kissing you, his hair a bit disheveled. It’s like he’s accessing you, wondering if you might do, wondering how far you might want to go and you want to tell him -
Draco was there, so close. His eyes looked like rain. Harry had never known they were so beautiful. He’d never known there were so many gradients of grey in the world. He wanted them on him like that forever. Some unknown emotion was pressing on them, just under the surface. Draco was fighting himself on something. Fear and doubt engulfed Harry. Maybe he was just going to tell Harry this was a one time only thing. Like all the other ones. He’d never cared before.
‘If you drop me, I’ll hex you,’ I whisper against his throat. I nuzzle his neck. Gods, he smells like everything I love.
Draco didn’t like the idea that he might be losing the plot. It annoyed him beyond reason.
The feeling is exhilarating. I’m confined under him, no place to hide from his eyes, from his ever invading questions. I’d usually fight him over this. I’d struggle & distract him with my body, until he caved in & fucked me. But this time, I can’t. My hard cock is lodged against his. But it doesn’t matter, because my desperation has nothing to do with how hard I am. It has to do with him, with the admission he wants to force out of me.
‘For a Slytherin you really are clueless.’
You didn’t mean to. You really didn’t. But the sight of him like this makes you want to do things. Your hand is on his collar and you pull him closer, kissing him. You pull back just as fast. He gazes back at you, his lips wet, his expression a little dazed.
Josh brushed Harry’s hair back, then pushed up a chair and sat, leaving Draco standing alone before Harry.
I drain the rest of my Firewhisky, enjoying the burn down my throat. I set the glass on the counter. Ten drinks.
His mouth forms a very thin line of contempt.
. Malfoy looks at me, even his eyes smile. Then he turns to her.
Josh nodded, closed the door, then took out his wand and warded it.
. To be fair, he’s better than me. His technique is nearly perfect. He’s quick on his feet, when he wants to be. He fights strategically, but he can get creative under pressure. He knows how to read me. Sometimes it’s as if he knows what I’m going for, even before I do. He’s definitely better than anyone I ever dueled.
But Malfoy was all silent. His firm hands pressed on Harry’s arse cheeks. He parted them, harshly.
‘You’re so beautiful,’ he says, out of breath.
I feel like laughing, but it’s stuck in my throat.
I stare at her.
What he wanted to do next took form inside his head in perfect clarity. Harry watched him expectantly.
‘No one gets to touch me without you saying so,’ Harry paused. ‘Means I don’t have a say in it.’
‘Apparate us?’ He asks.
‘You’re already pleasing me, you have no idea just how much…’ Malfoy said. The bulge in his pants came in contact with Harry’s cock. He rutted against Harry, slow and purposeful, a gasp escaping his lips. One of Malfoy’s hands came up to cup Harry’s face, his lips too close to Harry’s. Just a tiny movement from one of them and they would be kissing.
He cuts you off.
‘She said I was a fucking jerk. And, you know, the usual life threat. She meant it, though. She cares for you.’
The silence stretches between you, alive and breathing.
‘I want to take you out to dinner. Is that something you’d be interested in doing also?’
I want to say no, tell him to fuck off, to quit his saviour ways.
He quickly covers his hand with the other.
But his hand wasn’t pleading. It was driving Draco nearly out of his goddamn mind, fingers skimming his bollocks through layers of fabric, his palm pressing over Draco’s hard shaft, then his fingers climbed up, closing around his length. Draco didn’t bother repressing a groan.
‘Not that it's any of your business, but you shouldn't believe everything you read in those magazines.’
Draco stood up, his cock hard still, but he ignored it. With a wave of his hand he accioed the leash back, hung it on the collar, and tugged Harry up, so that he was kneeling on the bed, trembling, Josh’s come easing out of his arse, dripping down his legs.
‘I was just leaving,’ he added.
‘I'm going to sit here and watch you,’ he said after a while. He twirled the wand in his hand. ‘That's what you like, isn't it? Me watching you?’
‘Please, Draco… make me yours… fuck me.’
‘You’re not-’ he swallowed. ‘You’re not going to... fuck me?’
Draco could feel the tip of his cock warm and wet. Leaking.
He once again became aware of the eyes of the men around them. He had completely forgotten about them. Some had chosen to watch Draco and Harry, instead of doing their thing.
Josh had been spanking him in the center of the room. Harry had been bent over Josh’s lap, arse up for everyone to watch. Harry loved the feel of Josh’s hand, sharp and firm on his arse, the sounds coming from other people around them, the steps on the floor made by polished shoes and boots. He knew they were being watched.
‘Did I please you?’ he asked, his voice barely a whisper. ‘Was I good enough for you?’
‘Let me do a warming spell. Please.’
He pulled Harry’s arms up again, gently, binding them to the cross, leaving the ankles free. There was a long pause in which Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes raking over him. He could barely even breathe.
‘You didn’t come.’ A crease showed-up on his forehead.
His voice works like an ignition, starting a chain of improbable events.
Please read the tags I added for this chapter. This bit might have kinks that are not for everyone's liking!
Harry’s jaw clenched, his eyes with a strange brightness to them.
You turn to leave, but something else catches your eye. Down the street, the light of the full moon catches on a familiar white strand of hair. He’s leaning against a wall, a cigarette dangling from his lips. For a terrible second you think he’s with someone else. But then his head turns and he sees you. He’s alone.
I guess that’s part of the reason I come to this place. It stops my favourite train of thought. All the ways I could be gone. All the ways I can end it.
Around me, conversations are exchanged, plates emptied of food, glasses of wine filled. I don’t know a single subject discussed and my stomach is empty of anything but wine. I’m on my fourth glass. If I keep going, the line between right and wrong will get blurry, opening up a space of possibility. I’m waiting for it to happen. My eyes are unmoving on the metal band of his ring, stark against his finger. I stare at it all through dinner. It feels like I’ve been staring at it all my life.
Tonight had been the same.
Her face tells me sitting in a bar with Harry Potter is perhaps the last thing she wants to do with her time.
‘You’re a sucker for this, aren’t you?’ Malfoy asked, and for the first time Harry heard his voice break, filled with arousal.
Like that would ever happen. I’m surprised to realise that I know why she’s here. There’s only one person of interest we share other than Hermione, and I’ve seen Hermione barely an hour ago.
‘Now close that pretty mouth of yours. You can open it again when he orders you to.’
‘I want you to hurt me… spank me… do whatever you want with me,’ he whispered.
He takes a slow drag, head tilting back. He exhales a little cloud of smoke.
‘Put your hand on my cock.’
‘Cause you’re like... an addiction to me.’
The words were clear enough. You gathered your clothes, got dressed and Disapparated right there. He didn’t even lift his eyes.
‘Do you like it?’ He asks, a tilt to his head. The bright sunlight coming in from the windows catches on the blue. Electric starlight.
You nod. Your hand trembles on the hilt of your wand.
‘You’re so goddamned beautiful.’
Those words worked like soft silk wrapping around his cock. Malfoy didn’t even need to go anywhere near it to make him lose it.
‘Can’t control yourself with cock in your mouth?’ Draco asked, the sharp tone in his voice making Harry open his eyes. He wasn’t defiant now. He had the glazed, lost look of perfect submission, as he nodded in answer, his mouth too filled with cock to do much else.
‘Good boy,’ Malfoy said and Harry’s knees felt weak.
Malfoy’s jaw tensed minutely, his smirk forming thin lines on his face. Harry wouldn’t have noticed any of this if he wasn’t completely enraptured by Draco.
I know the took FOREVER, but here it is! This is my last Drarry fic for the foreseeable future. I spent more than six months writing this chapter, so that I could give myself and you the very best of what I can write. I edited the first chapter - it's the same story, but it needed some fixing here and there, so if you want, go back and read it from the top.
I hate his honesty. But I hate myself more for letting myself slip every time. I close my eyes. It’s the only way I can pretend he’s not looking at me like he is now. Like he knows me inside & out.
You fall asleep again and you’re awaken by the sound of him paddling to your bathroom. It’s the simplicity of it, the weird familiarity of it that shakes you. You close your eyes. It’s right there, behind your eyelids. You allow it to wash over you. The second you say it in your head, you know it’s the truth.
And he certainly was going to take his sweet time, Harry thought. Malfoy wasn’t moving, but Harry was sure he was looking at him.
‘I don’t do relationships.’
‘It’s late, I should go.’
‘Don’t, Josh. Don’t heal… I don’t-’
‘I just needed- I needed to feel something. To make it stop.’
‘What can I say, Draco… You’re special,’ he says & for a second he’s the one to look away. It is not exactly a lie, but it is also so far from the truth I can practically put my finger on the space it opens up.
Draco was laying him down on one of the sofas, adjusting the cushions under him, the soft fabric brushing against his abused skin. It hurt in all the right ways, like Draco had done.
I evade his tentative kiss. His mouth ends up on my neck. He sucks on my skin, and I ignore the fact that I’ve told him over and over again to not leave marks on me. I’ll have to glamour it later.
‘You don’t have to say anything you don’t feel comfortable to,’ he said.
You wonder when you’ll be seeing him again.
The light does not move. It does not flicker, does not fade.
That seems to unfreeze me.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘No one has dates on Christmas Eve,’ he says. He’s smiling and he doesn’t know why.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I want you to watch me while I fuck you open. You’re not allowed to move or come. Or kiss me,’ Malfoy looked up at him. His smile was cruel and Harry revelled in it, his whole body coming awake again, like he’d been jolted back to life.
‘You are so beautiful, Harry… I loved everything.’
‘Morning.’ I say, or rather I try to.
Draco turned to Josh, sitting on the other couch.
‘We can go to Paris, or somewhere else. We both have money. You can get away from the press for a while- you can have some real holidays for the first time-’
‘What do you mean? Are you serious?’
He finishes his speech, quite out of breath. I open my mouth. Then close it. I seem to be doing that a lot. Everything he’s just said makes sense. It’s probably the same reason he chose this secluded table for us. I’ve been such a fool.
‘Make yourself comfortable,’ you say.
Our hands look good together.
‘Yeah. Definitely a game.’ He says.
‘Lots,’ Harry licked the tip of his cock. ‘All of them with you.’
‘I want to date you.’
‘I know you hate talking feelings,’ he says very fast. ‘And I’m not the best at words either. I don’t want you to feel like you have to spill every fucking thought you have about us. But… we can’t keep doing this without talking. Some.’
Here is the happy ending, my sweets. I spent the whole day writing this. Hope you like it. Take care.
You take on every case, you work extra hours, you file all your reports, you go on cases abroad and you try to get him out of your mind. You work yourself to exhaustion and go back to the sleeping potions, trying formula after new formula, until Hermione gets suspicious and drills you with so many questions you end up confessing everything. You don’t tell her you’re in love with him, but you’re pretty sure she gets there by herself. Not even Hermione can help you with this one.
He let one of his fingers trail down Harry’s neck. Even the barest of touches was like a jolt up his arm. Harry strangled a moan when Draco pulled his hand away.
Staring into the dark with someone is not the same as staring into it alone.
I feel my cheeks heating up with something like shame.
‘There’s nothing “just” about you having sex with
‘Yes. Yes. Fucking sappy too.’
Harry sobbed, and went down on Josh’s cock like it was the single most important thing in the world, his whole face changing into pure deliverance. Josh groaned loudly.
You’re not religious, but nothing else occurs to you.
Still I come back for more. Every time he breaks me, the pain tells me he’s real.
He also looks like himself again. He chuckles. Shakes his head.
He stands up.
She pins me down with a stare over the rim of her glass.
You’re already up in the tower when you hear his steps behind you. There’s so many things you need to say to him. One year and one night and one morning of things you need to tell him.
‘Go with it.’
@isleen_, thank you for all the brainstorming, your several readings, your support. You kept me writing and you kept me hopeful.
‘Are we leaving already?’
Harry smiled at him, sweet and hopeful.
‘You assume too much.’ I say pointedly.
Harry didn’t even try to stand up. He crawled over to Draco, kneeling between his parted thighs. Draco felt himself float on that thread of desire so insane, pulling them closer, so that he knew that when they finally did touch, after all this, it would be like crashing, like a tornado meets a volcano, like two powerful spells striking in midair.
‘No one knows how tired I am.’
I have all kinks when it comes to you, Draco
‘All of it, please,’ he whispered. Malfoy’s eyes were wide, but he moved, pressing into Harry even when he found resistance and then he was fully seated, his heavy bullocks nudged against Harry’s arse.
Draco reads it three times. The words start to lose their meaning. A thousand unsaid things go up his throat. A thousand days of wondering, pieces of a puzzle scattered on his mind.
He gives me a half-smile.
He looks at me and I have this perfect vision of the man I want to wake up to every fucking day of my life. I don’t know how to tell him that. At this thought, I realise the hungover potion just finished its job. I’m sober. And scared.
She turns to me so fast I nearly jump off my seat.
‘I want to be waiting for you every day, all ready,’ he said, slow and gentle and
Let me tell you about Draco Malfoy. He’s nothing like the boy I knew.
‘I’m not —’ he looks at his own hands, never at you. ‘I’m not like you.’
There was a heartbeat of silence. Malfoy’s breathing grazed his ear.
‘You want to sleep with me?’
Truth is… nobody cares what happens to the one who made all the wrong choices.
‘Draco is my best friend,’ she says, then stands up. I realise that this is the first time she’s saying something to me not out of spite or hate or even indifference. There is real care behind her words, even behind her usually unreadable eyes.
Harry was kneeling on the floor, his hands in position behind his back, his back straight and his neck proud, a tinge of red on his cheeks. The green eyes ignited the moment they caught sight of Draco. His lips were wet and red, the gag left his mouth wide, ready to be fucked. Draco entertained the wild thought of just coming up to him, unzip his trousers, push down his pants and shove his cock into that willing, wet hole. He’d fuck it raw and deep, until Harry was nothing but a deposit for his spunk.
Suddenly Harry was there, on him, pushing him back on the bed, and straddling him, his legs coming to wrap around Draco. He was sweaty and he smelled of sex and of broom polish and Summer and light things. Draco heard his own voice, hoarse, unrecognizable but still his.
He stares at you from across the room. It’s impossible to know what he’s thinking or what he’s going to do.
I can’t form any words, so he keeps walking over to me.
, like a prayer; the whole of him so perfectly
His arm comes around your waist.
‘You’re right,’ I whisper.
Our words mingle together and I’m laughing with him and then we’re kissing again and I’m sure this night is going to end with me fucking him slowly, or the other way around, I really don’t care. We’re moving, the beat drifts over us, his eyes are bright on me, then he lifts them up to look at the stars. I look at him.
It starts as an ache in your chest whenever he leaves, whenever something —
‘I’m going to hurt you so badly, you won’t be able to sit down properly for a month,’ Malfoy said. ‘And then I’m going to make you feel so good. You have no idea.’
Malfoy chuckled. It was deep and drawn out. Harry noticed a hint of arousal in it. His cock gave a jolt. He wanted to know if Malfoy was as hard as he was, but he dared not buck back against him, to make their bodies touch. He felt pinned in place without Malfoy needing to say or do anything.
‘You read that?’ He asks, a slight undertone of panic in his voice.
‘I thought you wanted to talk,’ he deadpans.
Tonight, it’s not the usual pub night. It’s Guernsey's birthday, some witch from Magical Sports. You must have exchanged the total of three words with her in your life, but that did not stop her from inviting you and the whole Ministry staff for drinks, including the Unspeakables, Hermione’s and Malfoy’s lot. True to their name, they don’t speak much (except for Hermione), don’t mingle (the idea of Malfoy mingling is a joke in itself), but yet here they are, three witches, two wizards, drinks in hand.
, but I hear the pleading in the way his body leans into mine, in the sudden catch of his breath, in the passing shadow of his eyes. It is only fitting that he once saved me from a wild Fiendfyre, so that he could burn me himself in one of his own creation.
‘Is it okay?’ He asks immediately.
It’s a desperate whisper. I have no idea what he’s begging me for. He brings his fingers to my face. His touch is no longer sexual, but something else. Something I can’t allow myself to feel for him. I bat his hand away, protection & cleaning spells fast on the tip of my tongue. I lift my hips up. I don’t want any lube, I want the burn & the ache. I sink down on his cock. It takes several tries, it’s messy, it hurts, but I don’t care for any of it. I want to feel him. I want my body to remember this.
Thank you also @Faylinn for your support in all my stories. Your delight in this one means a lot to me.
There were streaks of old scars, crisscrossing Harry’s chest. Probably from curses and hexes, quite different from the ones caused inside the club. Josh pulled on Harry’s hair and kissed him, open-mouthed, filthy. Harry leant against his Dom, his whole body giving up the fight, one of his hands finding the hem of Josh’s shirt. His fingers tangled in the fabric.
‘Too much?’ He asks, waltzing in.
Plaintive. So fucking sweet. Breaking around the edges in a whimper that Draco knew only meant Harry wanted more.
He makes a startled sound. His pupils blown wide. Endless green. I can feel his heartbeat under my fingers, over his neck. Frantic.
It started like that. Malfoy’s breath on his ear, his voice low, hot against his skin. Harry shivered, though he could feel the heat from Malfoy’s body just behind him, too close, but not touching him. Even if he could. For the rest of the night, he could do whatever the hell he wanted with Harry.
He opened his eyes. The lights had shifted and he was, thankfully, protected by shadows. The lights from the ceiling shined on Harry instead, on his skin covered with a sheen of sweat, light and darkness playing across his legs, his back, his stricken face. And he was still looking right at Draco, as if he could see him in the dark. His eyes didn’t leave much open for interpretation. They were wet, torn. So completely unguarded, open wounds exposed to the air. What they were saying was as clear as spoken word:
I’m aware of my heart beating loudly on my throat.
‘Stop it.’
‘I can't sleep.’
He looks at me, eyes defiant. He doesn’t raise his voice, in fact he says it so quietly it’s barely there, but his words slam into me.
Harry trailed kisses down his shaft. It was the most beautiful torture of his life and Draco wanted nothing more than for it to go on until he couldn’t keep it in anymore. He realised he was moaning freely, not caring that his hips jerked up with every movement of Harry’s mouth on his cock.
Harry swallowed.
‘I’m just saying that we’re gonna hurt each other. Everyone does. So I’m not going to promise that I won’t. But I’ll try my best. I want this.’
I almost feel sober at the sight of his door. It’s only for the barest moment, but there’s something so real about it, so right. The dark wood is hard evidence amidst this world turned to grey. I stagger for the door like a man who’s lost all sense of self-preservation. Yeah, the War changed me. Look at me.
‘For reasons I can’t fathom, men fall down on their knees for you. So pick up a replacement and stick with it, or don’t. If you’re not serious about Draco, just get the fuck away from him or this time I won’t need to hand you over to a lame excuse of a Dark Lord, I’ll finish you myself.’
‘Just that?’
Draco is vaguely aware that there’s a huge Christmas tree in the center, covered in lights. Draco has always loved Christmas lights. Right now, he hates them with a vengeance.
I laugh again because he’s right. He’s known for telling the truth even when it’s highly inconvenient, even when no one else wanted to hear it. And even though he always had the support of his friends, it occurs to me how lonely it must have been. To carry that truth. To speak it.
The word rolled slowly against his tongue. It tasted soft, right and commanding all at the same time. Harry closed his eyes, then opened them again and looked up at Josh with a silent plea. The three of them were standing so close together, it felt like Draco was being brought into their intimate circle. Or rather that the circle was only complete because he was there.
The silence felt electrified. Malfoy pressed closer, his bulge rubbing against Harry’s cock.
Some dinners he folds his napkin neatly on the table. I came to hate that gesture. I look up then, he nods once, his grey eyes like glass, empty of all feeling. He turns his back on me. I know those are the nights he’s expected home. The nights he can’t escape. Those are also the nights he breaks my heart all over again.
‘I wish that too.’ I say in a whisper.
‘Privacy, Draco. I didn’t want them messing with us. With you. Because, contrary to what you think, I do care about you. You’re not a hookup. You were never a hookup. I didn’t want them nosing around your life, harassing you or bothering you with invasive questions. I know about the crap they put you through after the War. No matter how much I hate it, anyone who dates me will have the press on them. I wanted us to be away from all of that bulshit, at least until we knew what we were doing.’
She does wear her sarcasm as well as her expensive designer clothes. I only know of one other person who wears it better, but I can’t bring myself to think about him right now. Or ever. His silence the last few weeks has made that abundantly clear.
Christmas Eve is just a day like any other. Except he’s grateful for the silence. Everyone's gone home to their families. The rasp of his quill on parchment is the only sound and he likes it that way. His thoughts go uninterrupted. The quiet stills him.
His hand reaches over the table, fingers inching closer to mine. I take my hand away.
Malfoy was waiting for an answer. It hit him just then that Malfoy could have done whatever he wanted with him - bound and blindfolded as he was - and never reveal his name. Josh had authorized it, Harry was Malfoy’s for the night. But still, he had revealed his identity. Harry could not explain why, but that turned him on even more.
Harry blinks. He looks so fucking sad I want to spit on his face just to make him have some sort of reaction.
He has a mind to repeat the stunt tonight. He turns me around, running his right hand over my chest and then dropping it down to my crotch. The fact that I’m not even hard doesn’t seem to bother him.
‘Oh but you do. Did you think I wouldn’t notice?’ Malfoy let out a dark, deep laugh. ‘Harry, I spent all my life noticing
‘Meet me outside.’ It comes out of my mouth like an order.
Draco felt like he was dreaming. A very vivid, torturing dream featuring Harry Potter on his knees, looking like sin. He shook his head, as if to shake the sight of Harry away, but he was still there, looking expectantly at him.
‘It won’t do if the guest of honor leaves when the best is yet to come, don’t you think?’ Josh asked in amusement.
I'm going to need to stop posting for a few days, so that I can finish writing the last chapters (I'm nearly all done! So, don't worry!), but I do need this time to be alone with the story and the characters, so that I can give you my best writing :) I didn't want to leave it at that horrifying note, so here is a new chapter. Thank you for reading and supporting this story. Take care*
The waitress brings me the tea. I pour it slowly, stirr my cup. I watch the vapor rising from it. And all the while I am aware of Harry Potter, staring at me like he’s seeing me for the first time. Maybe he is. I’m not wearing my club clothes either. I know exactly how I look with my Gucci white shirt, grey suspenders, a knitted charcoal coat from Hermès (a gift from Pansy). I spent an hour deciding what to wear. I wanted to look good, but also like he couldn’t hurt me even if he tried very hard. I think I managed.
But there’s more than that. Something eyes can’t see.
Not nearly. I want to suck you... hot dad :)
His voice stops your thinking. It splits the dark.
Pansy looks thoroughly unphased by my way too intense reaction.
As in all the times before, he doesn’t seem to notice me at all.
‘You really like it.’ He echoes, a dazed look on his grey eyes.
You watch him lick, suck and rub against you. You don’t dare to put your hands on his hair, even though you’re dying to.
‘Tell me the rest of it,’ he said, his cock slick and slippery under his hand.
There was a spanking leather bench close by, and Draco did not have to wonder much about Josh’s immediate plans. The lights flashed once over the beautiful line of Harry’s back. Draco thought he saw older bruises there, but it was too fast for him to be sure. His heart felt lodged in his throat, a sensation he wasn’t familiar with. He took a sip of the wine, willing the liquid to ease it down, to numb the feeling. No such luck. His eyes were fixed on the planes and curves of Harry’s body. He had the body of an Auror, of a reckless fighter. Hard, strong, marred in so many different ways, a testimony to the battles that had taken place there. But still there was a trace of fragility there… something so
‘Er- I told Mirna about you.’ He blurts out.
‘Was,’ I say. And it feels good to admit it out loud. ‘Past sentence.’ I add, for good measure.
‘With you.’
‘Are you ever going to call my wife by her given name?’
‘Yes, Draco. I’ll do that,’  Harry took another deep breath and felt himself falling right into it again, going down.
Life is a very strange thing.
I can’t help the way my voice cracks. His hand curls in a fist.
‘It’s okay, Pans. I just need to not see him again. I can’t be around him. I need to forget about him. Move on.’
There was a wire linking his body to Malfoy’s words. That was what it felt like, at least, when that question nearly had him shaking.
‘Did you just?...’ but Josh didn’t finish, shoving his cock deeper inside Harry’s mouth.
‘Fuck me,’ Harry said in a small whimper.
He takes a deep drag of his cigarette and glances at you briefly. He looks intangible and so real at the same time. There’s no reason at all for you to feel this comfortable around him. No matter what Hermione says, the truth is you don’t know him. Not really. You cross paths at the Ministry, on the usual pub night and on formal occasions like this and none of you does more than acknowledge the other with a nod. But in all those times, there’s something about his silence that comforts you. It makes you feel like you don’t have to pretend.
‘Because you’re so fucking pretty and so good,’ Draco completed, his throat raw, his words tasting wet on his tongue. ‘And I always take good care of pretty things I own, so I can use them again and again…’
‘Fix it. Or you’re going to wish you had stayed dead.’
Like it’s my fault. You should be here
We stop going to our spot. And the strangest thing happens: I no longer feel like smoking.
watching,’ Draco bit out.
‘You did so good, baby…’ he said, and his fingers brushed the wetness off Harry’s face. Harry only answered with a broken sigh, his eyes drifting shut.
, he says. The fact that your friends know doesn’t ease the pain, but instead makes it all the more real.
He grabs my hair harshly and sinks his cock in my mouth, no other preamble. I gag on it. His hands force my head down on him. He seems to be enjoying himself.
‘Fuck me, Harry.’
Andrew was good. Safe. My chance of a future, even if a rather boring one. The engagement ring he gave me was a thing of beauty. Single diamond in a golden band. A bold choice for him, let me tell you. Say what you will about Andrew, but he has great taste (he wanted me, after all). Only the best for you, he’d said, kneeling at my feet in his perfect Armani suit. He was also a reasonable man; quite understanding when I told him that I needed to think about it. You should take your time, dear. So I did. Take my time, I mean.
‘Fuck me, Malfoy…’
‘I’m going to watch.’
‘So.’
A moment’s hesitation. Draco’s hands moved to his blindfold and he took it off. Harry blinked, black spots smearing his vision. He closed his eyes shut, resting his head against the leather, waiting for it to pass. Beads of sweat and tears were trickling down his face freely and he felt too exposed without the blindfold. He blinked again, turning his head.
‘I… Merlin, I can’t do this.’ He gestures towards your couch. ‘Can I?’
‘But that’s the thing,’ He says, voice so quiet. His whole expression softens. ‘You don’t treat me like shit. At least you haven’t, not in years. And definitely not as long as we’ve been…’
‘Think you can come from me kissing you?’ he asked when their lips parted for a second.
I shrug.
But he’s still looking at me, worried.
‘And you’re getting hard again. Can’t have dinner like this, can you, Harry?’
‘Good. That’s good.’
Right now, this thing between us doesn’t have a name. It’s just a good thing.
‘Tell us exactly why Josh had to refuse those other cocks, so eager for your hole.’
Trust Potter to turn the world around again, in his usual uncalled for way.
Malfoy chuckled, his fingers light, treading over his hairs, then he twisted them and pain crashed over Harry. He was flushed against Malfoy and it was too good, the feel of Malfoy’s lean hard body behind him, of his cruel hands over him, pulling his hairs, twisting them, dragging his nails over his skin, doing whatever the hell they pleased…
And they were always intent on Draco somehow; he refused to think on what that could mean: was Potter really
I’ve got these dinners down to an art. I smile, I nod, I even talk in the right places, but all the time I’m only aware of him. When he speaks. When he stays silent. His legs crossed under the table. His cuffs brushing mine. I know he’s on his third glass. But once I stare at his hands, I slide further down the spiral. He’s the only one who can release me.
Draco didn’t know if he nodded or not, but Harry dropped to his knees on the floor. Draco parted his legs and watched Harry shuffling closer, hands smoothing over the fabric of Draco’s trousers.
Pansy sets her glass on the only empty, neat spot on the table. She looks at me and, shit, she really looks worried. I hate it when she looks worried.
He wasn't able to answer with words, but Draco reached behind his neck and tugged him closer. Harry sobbed, he was a mess, he didn’t expect Draco to ever want to kiss him now, while he was babbling, sweaty, tears streaming down his face. But Draco did.
sight.
Of course he catches up on me.
‘Is there a problem?’ Draco asked. ‘Perhaps you forgot how it’s done.’
He badly wanted to come. He fucking needed the release. And he had wanted to be fucked out of his mind. He had wanted so many things, so many...
Draco concentrates very hard on breathing. It’s the most difficult task he’s undertaken.
You land on your living room. You thought it better than Apparating directly to your room. You want to give him the option. You ask him if he wants anything. He just stares at you, like your question is absurd. You take your coat off and drop it off on a chair. He does the same.
‘Will I get to suck you this time?’
‘It’s better than I imagined,’ Harry said, his fingers curling around his shaft and pulling slowly. ‘Fits my mouth… and my hole.’ Harry smiled as he licked a path up Draco’s shaft. Draco wondered if he could come like this, just with slow teasing and Harry’s dirty talk. ‘When I'm down here I feel like I am made to be used by you.’
When I saved him at the Manor.
Harry never looked away, trapped by the vision of Draco sucking him off, his cheeks hollowing, his eyes burning through Harry as if he wanted to imprint himself on Harry’s mind, beyond this night, probably forever.
He watched as a man came up to Josh, speaking in his ear. The man wanted Harry, of course. Anyone with the smallest hint of good taste would. Josh simply shook his head, refusing the offer with a sly smile. Draco tried not to think of the satisfaction that gave him.
Potter touches his arm.
‘It’s going to get worse tomorrow. The bruises.’ I clear my throat. ‘Maybe… you should get to the Hospital Wing- I could come with you-’
‘Does that mean you’re coming?’
‘You mean them?’ He shrugs, turns his eyes back to me. His face is half shadow, half rainbow lights. His mouth forms half a teasing smile.
His mouth does not crash mine, I don’t pin him to a wall, my hands going down on him. We don’t move, don’t speak. His arm is next to mine, not touching. The seconds spill over us, silent, burning.
‘Oh fuck,’ Harry tensed up, the words almost making him come on the spot. But he knew he would take it, he knew it. He would, because Draco was everything on his mind, on his body, on his heart.
Content warning: this chapter is a graphic description of a rape scene. It involves Draco, but it does NOT involve Harry (meaning, Harry doesn’t rape Draco, someone else does). If this triggers you, please skip this chapter. If you decide to read, I’m hoping you do it in the safest way possible for you. Also, please remember there’s a happy ending at the end of this story. Thank you for sticking with this fic.
After a while, Harry pushes me back a little, so as to be able to look at me. And when he speaks I know he’s trusting me with something he wouldn’t just share with anyone.
Draco revelled in the helplessness of it. Harry’s eyes dared to wander as far as his lips, then to the corner of his mouth, then up to his eyes again.
He swallows uncomfortably. I immediately know, in my gut, that I was right.
‘Wanna come over to mine?’
He blanches. The terrible gash on his face looks even more white. Apparently he wasn’t expecting me to be this straightforward. I don’t blame him, I’m quite surprised at myself.
She’s so spot on about nearly everything that I decide to pretend I don’t know what she means.
‘Look,’ Josh said. ‘He’s totally into you, like…
He looks you dead in the eye.
Fuck, the way he said it. So sweet and shy and bold.
Someone needs to break this spell. One of us needs to say something to defuse this. Something mocking, something spiteful. But none of us does.
‘I know we’re not exclusive or anything—’ He begins, but you can't help but stop him.
You nurse the slight hangover with coke and pizza. The headache stays. You want a smoke, but leaving the bed is not a possibility.
Harry opened his eyes and they flicked to Draco, bright.
‘Why do you think I keep turning them down?’ I ask.
‘Yes,’ I say. 'Like they all do,' I add, unable to stop myself. My hand acts on its own. It drives his hand all the way up to my thigh. I’m breathless. I look up, his lips are parted, his cheeks tinged in faint red. His hand flexes over my thigh, experimentally.
She looks uncomfortable for the first time.
‘I like it. The hair, the tattoos, the eyeliner. Everything.’
It’s an excruciating drop into the fire.
I’m so tired of pretending. So tired of fighting it. So tired of feeling cold.
I’m in the great hall, Draco. You want me to get fired?
I want you to use me however you see fit,’ Harry swallowed. ‘Want to please you.’
Harry felt two long fingers breaching his mouth and he bucked back, his arse brushing against the hard line of Malfoy’s trousers. His lips parted pliantly to take Malfoy’s fingers in, deep. He was surprised to hear his own moan.
Harry cried out, his hips snapping forward at once, his cock sinking into the tightness of Malfoy’s mouth. There was only Malfoy, his tongue licking down his length, his hand gripping the base of Harry’s cock as he sucked him down. How could Malfoy be the one kneeling on the floor, taking his cock down his throat and still be so fucking dominating? That mouth was wicked, that was the best way to put it. Harry forgot all reasoning, his moans loud and helpless in the club, a river of pleas out of his mouth, his arms thrashing against the leather. He was screaming Malfoy’s name, over and over again. Harry felt like he was the one being fucked, even as his hips set a brutal thrusting rhythm edged on by Malfoy, who was now shamelessly moaning around his cock, taking him as deep as he could go. Harry was going to come and for the feel of it, it would be a fucking brutal orgasm. His bollocks were drawn up, his whole body taut as Malfoy sucked him like he’d been thirsty for this all his life. This was madness. All this. This brutal chemistry between them, this all consuming need. Lights flashed before him, blinking white spots in his darkness, as Malfoy gagged on his cock, willingly. His throat constricted once around Harry’s cock and it was too good and too much, Harry was going to come. But he couldn’t. Malfoy had to authorize it and his mouth was currently very busy. He felt the devious smile around his cock. The bastard knew what he was doing.
You wonder when will it all stop.
This is the future. The one thing I’m scared of. The future is here and he’s leaving me. I haven’t kissed him and he’s leaving, his bright blue hair, his sweet grey eyes, his stubborn mouth. He’s everything I want and he’s saying goodbye. I’m so sure of it, I almost don’t hear what he’s actually saying.
‘Have me over this table, Harry. Stuff me with your cock until I’m ruined for everyone else.’
‘How are your hands? Do you feel any tingling?’ Malfoy touched his wrists, pulling on the bounds to make sure they weren’t cutting up his circulation. ‘And your ankles? Is everything okay?’
You consider the flask of Sleeping Draught on your nightstand.
‘Please… let me wrap my legs around you… please…’
As for you… you probably look like someone’s just fucked the hell out of your mouth.
Harry felt Malfoy’s breathing on his lips.
‘Are you going to take me home now, Draco?’
It was impossible to lie to those green eyes.
‘Pansy told me.’ I whisper. ‘About your injuries.’
Just like that, Draco was soaring high, with Harry at his feet. He could take Harry right now, have him against some random wall, or bending over any surface. His hands dropped to his side. He’d never been so hard in his life.
, Draco thought, unnerved.
As he thought that, Josh set the flogger aside on the table, and removed Harry’s ankles’ restraints. Draco felt his own pulse beating hard on his wrist. Josh helped Harry up, then had him kneeling on the floor again, mere feet away from where Draco was sitting, exactly like that first time.
He nodded fervently. The idea of pleasing Malfoy with his body was a secret dirty fantasy coming to life. He felt Malfoy’s breath on his cheek. It was fresh and minty and Harry’s mouth watered. He imagined how it would be to have that taste on his lips. On his tongue.
I pretend to not be interested in him & he pretends to be interested in everyone else but me.
I have no idea how to respond to this. For a while, we don’t say a word. I let him hold me, my hand brushing slowly over his knee, my ear to his chest. I can hear his fast heartbeat. Nothing was ever easy to me, but he is. He knows me. Not some masked, collected version of me, but the real messy one. He sees it, the same way he sees the person I’m trying so hard to become.
I can never forgive him. He knows this.
I think I see the shadow of a smile on her lips, but I’m pretty sure I imagined it.
‘No, Malfoy. I won’t come. I’ll do everything you say.’
I sense Granger’s hand, or should I say reasoning, behind every word she’s just said.
He considers you for a moment. You never asked this before, for fear of getting turned down. Not for the first time, you wonder what goes on inside his head. Does he want you? Is this just a bit of fun and games? Is he bored? What does he want from you? When will it end? Because you know it will.
‘I think I’m into you. I think I’ve been into you for years. I’m probably ruining everything now. But even if you won’t speak to me again, even if you file for a new partner at work… I need you to know. I like you. Like, really like you.’
‘God, that was a nice farewell. You have the best arse, Harry. I'm going to miss it.’
He whispers me the truth, I exhale my heart out. It beats once, a bloody vibrant thing pumping life and need. And then I’m shouting it all at him, what I should have told him a thousand times before in a thousand different ways. He kisses my heart in.
‘I think that’s been established.’
‘I’m sober,’ I say. ‘Thank you,’ it’s a whisper, but he hears it. I understand now Harry would never take advantage of me while I’m drunk. He would never, because, in fact, he… He really...
‘I mean — I’m fucked up, Harry.’
He forced Harry’s mouth open so that he could slide more fingers inside it.
The cold air hits my face and I sober up some more, even if the street seems lopsided. He’s walking up ahead, his hands white at his sides. He takes a left turn, to the back of the building and I do too. This street is empty. He stops at the Apparition point. He doesn’t turn back to look at me, I don’t speak when I reach him. I lift my arm, he grabs it and I feel the instant pull. The world dissolves, swirls, we spin, his hand on me.
‘Save me the bulshit, Draco. I’ve known you since you were 3 years old. This is Potter we're talking about. You’re in love with him.’
The rest of what I meant to say vanishes off my mind. Because we’re at the Great Hall and Draco is walking over to our table, holding a plate and a glass of juice and there’s this very tall Ravenclaw — I think his name is Flannagan — walking over to him and everything slows down, halts.
‘Those-’ I swallow, holding his gaze. ‘Those are not like the bruises from our duels. They’re-’
Malfoy kept pinching his nipples harshly, one at a time, making them hard between his fingers, then pressing the tip of the cane there, playing, twisting them mercilessly. The pain was sharp and wonderful.
He stopped moving, his cock inside Harry.
He leaned over slightly, but made no move to touch Harry. The air crackled between them. He felt the energy thrumming on his fingernails.
He forces my legs apart and rubs his cock in between them, like he’s got all the time in the world, like I’m enjoying this. He’s hard and he holds me in a vice-like grip, adjusting himself behind me. I scramble against the wall, push back with all of my strength.
‘I won’t.’
I bring the dark tip of my boot forward, putting out the cigarette. He brings a warm hand to the small of my back & just like that our bodies slant together.
He stares at the glass of Firewhisky in my hand and I know he knows exactly how many I’ve had. His smirk is blatantly bold & perceptive. One of his eyebrows goes up. That’s my trademark, so obviously I take offense.
disliking
‘Do you think you can take this?’
Pansy Granger-Parkinson seems to be at a loss for words. Which is something I didn’t even know was possible. She recovers quickly though.
‘Who’re you talking to?’
That first time he kissed me was not the beginning, but rather the point of no return. The moment he became inevitable.
Wanted to tear him apart, hurt him, fuck him good, spell him better and do it all over again. And again.
Potter-Malfoy ;)
‘You were so good, so sweet, getting fucked for me,’ Draco said, his fingers cupping Harry’s chin, lifting his face up so that their lips aligned. ‘You’re desperate for my mouth, my cock, any of it, aren’t you?’
‘How about yours?’
‘I’m your property,’ he said. ‘Yours to do with as you please.’
‘I was waiting for us to be alone,’ he admitted, a long breath rushing out of him. Merlin, he wanted Harry to make him lose it, he felt so close already.
Look I had issues alright?

The way she’s looking at me is so serious, it nearly scares me.
‘You’re always so busy, Harry. Issuing orders all around… No wonder you’re here. You’re tired, aren’t you?’
‘That’s- he’s a fucking bastard, Draco.’
I turn my head towards him. His eyes drift to mine. They are as green as I remembered.
I don’t know how to go back to what we were about to do. But he does. His hand catches mine and he pulls me up, his arm wrapping around my waist. He moves against me. We’re in the middle of the street, but no one really cares.
I swallow. He’s all business, but at the same time not at all. He’s just serious. The most serious I ever saw him, and that’s counting some post-War speeches & the occasional work-related meeting. He’s been so many things with me, but he’s never been serious. I realise just how serious he is about whatever this is when he waves his hand, wandlessly putting up a silencing charm around our table. He takes a deep breath. He opens his mouth. Closes it. I’ve never seen him act this… hesitant. It makes quick work of spiking my nerves even more.
Whatever it was, it set Harry to motion. His mouth crashed over Draco’s, his hands pushing them flush together, another delicious sound leaking out of his mouth, a moan that built up around Draco as he let Harry take control of the kiss, of the pace, of
There was a possibility that Potter had said yes as some sort of non-healthy masochistic punishment. That might be his kink, but Draco refused to have that on himself. He knew all about being fucked-up from the War, he could only wonder how much more fucked-up The Chosen One was. That was why he’d been adamant in making sure it was enthusiastic consent, that Potter wasn’t too far gone or horny to care. But everything Potter had said - and the way he said it - had left no place for doubt. His consent had been a promise, palpable:
‘Josh,’ he said, knowing his face looked impassive. He felt grateful for how easily the mask fell in place. He supposed he could count that as the most valuable skill he’d acquired during the War.
All three of us look at each other. I open my mouth to speak, but I have no idea what to say. I don’t know what words describe this thing we’re doing.

‘One word from you…’ he says, warm fingers circling my wrist. ‘I’ll drop him right this second. You know I will.’
His mouth huffs the words over mine, his hand curling on my thigh.
He convinces me to step out of the house one day. He has a small garden on the back. The trees look too tall, too wide, but he puts his arm around me.
‘It's me, your long lost love.’
He didn’t know what he was asking for anymore, the only thing he knew was that tongue, moving inside him, Malfoy’s thumb caressing the skin near his hole, Malfoy’s face pressing into him, his hairs tinkling his skin, and he was bucking back against that heat, against Malfoy’s mouth and tongue, forgetting everything. He moaned freely, loud, his body going more pliant as Malfoy’s hands gripped his arse, forcing his tongue further inside Harry. He was going to come and he couldn’t, he had to take this, he had to, but he wasn’t strong enough, he was a hole, just a hole for Malfoy to fuck… a small, tight hole, being torn apart by that tongue. Merlin, that mouth. That filthy, terrible mouth. He felt powerless against the building pleasure, his orgasm starting to rise up, a force that could not be contained, but he had to fight it, Malfoy hadn’t allowed it, his orgasm wasn’t his, it was Malfoy’s… Malfoy’s to decide, Malfoy’s to have.
