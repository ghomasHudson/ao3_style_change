“You never know, Harry,” she says, driving her steel-toed boot into the drywall, which is holding with nary a scratch. “Wizards sometimes have a blind spot when it comes to brute force.”
“I am conniving.” Draco leans his head back, smiling wryly at Harry, who feels his stomach flip. He thinks it’s the first smile he’s ever gotten out of Draco, maybe ever, and he wants to make it happen again. “Merlin, how is it that neither of us ended up dying? You’d think with how hard we tried to kill each other, one of us would have figured it out.”
All his limbs are where they’re supposed to be, but there’s a tear somewhere that burns with Draco’s name, old wounds and something stronger taking him back.
There was probably a time after the war where Draco could have fled the country instead, gone for a small beach house somewhere gray and tended a few chickens, maybe had an herb garden. These are the kinds of things Harry would in theory choose for himself in any other universe.
“So glad you’ve come around to our side,” Ron said. “I knew you couldn’t stay so positive about anything that kept you away from your studies for too long.”
When his feet hit the floor he choked in a breath and knew without a doubt that the rest of the day would be like swimming upstream.
“Pink is just a good color,” Draco said, her voice dropping like she was telling a secret. “Thanks.”
“See you Sunday morning,” Harry says, a raindrop catching the lens of his glasses, another on the tip of his nose.
“Very hot, thanks for sharing with the class,” Harry says, and Draco makes a noise that’s potentially supposed to be a reply but is definitely just a whine.
Harry I’m drunk. Harry. Your name is a stupid as you are. I like writing it, it flows nicely on the quill. I feel like I always contradict myself.
Draco looked as if she was torn between two spectacularly bitchy responses. In the process of trying to keep Draco in her line of sight and trying to continue dancing with Anthony, Harry nearly fell over before she could hear the next bit.
“I think it’s a team sport,” Harry says, his eyebrows furrowing. “I think in the game of handjobs we’re on the same team.” He stops talking to let out a ragged breath. “Yeah, I don’t think I can fully argue this while you’re touching me.”
Draco gave her a searching look but didn’t press, just continued to lead her through the steps, her head held high.
“Nothing,” Draco shoots back, cutting into his crepe with a grim determination. The transformation has left him with a pallor to his skin and puffiness around the eyes, but he doesn’t look much less appealing in Harry’s jumper than he had at the Ministry charity functions right after the war. Harry wishes that Draco looking appealing wasn’t something he was aware of.
When they finally leave it, the kiss and the party, it’s because Draco pulls back out of his head with the backward spiraling motion he’s becoming accustomed to. They surface, leaning back in their chairs like wilted flowers, eyes still locked.
“I don’t know,” she said, a sadness in her eyes. She seemed to be searching for something to say, looking around at the flowers and the foliage like they’d give her answers. “Are you two-” A pause, scuffing her school shoes against each other. “In love? Do you love him?”
“What a nightmare,” Harry said, shoving his books into his bag, both of them knowing full well that Hermione was not only the brains of the trio but much of the glue.
“Calm down, I’m mostly kidding.” Harry puts up his hands in a gesture of surrender. “She’s probably not a suspect, but I do need to talk to her just in case. She might know something and even if she doesn’t, we need to keep her in the loop to make sure she’s safe.”
Draco can not believe he’s being asked this and tries to diplomatically communicate the facts of the situation. “I don’t mean to make things more bizarre than they already are, but, to be clear, I have wanted to sexually destroy you for a year. Perhaps longer. I don’t have to say, but it could be longer.”
“Of course, how could I forget the age old adage of ‘fuck comfort I’m a slytherin’,” Harry replies, the entrance of a customer with an old radio the only thing stopping Draco from biting back a retort.
Harry wants to hurt him, wants to throw punches like they used to so at least they can be on even ground. “Fine.”
“About knowing it?” Draco tried to fill in, his eyes tripping over Harry’s body, how he sat so sprawled out, his hair pushed every which way while Draco sat up perfectly straight.
It’s a bit cruel I think, to make us help them take our home apart, but it’s not like there’s much sacred left in here. Mother obliterated all the nice dishware yesterday, because the ministry people told her they planned on removing it. I tried to stop her, but she’d gotten the damn idea in her head and I didn’t know any way to talk her out of it, so we stood in the kitchens and smashed plates until the whole floor was covered in shards of delicate china. It doesn’t really matter, it’s not like anyone stands to inherit them anyone. Maybe Andromeda would have liked them? Didn’t Nymphadora have a son? Theodore? Not that he’d want death eater dishware. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
He didn’t tell Draco that he had it in his hands almost always. Draco knew. Sometimes, Draco looked at him with the fierce and penetrating pity Harry saw in everyone else’s eyes. Sometimes, Draco looked at him like he was the last man on Earth.
“Really good, I think. Cosmetology school has been awesome for her,” Parvati said with a smile. “She keeps owling me fancy makeup, it’s great.”
27. “You couldn’t be a martyr,” Harry said. They’d eaten and were sitting on opposite ends of the couch, rain coming down relentlessly outside. Draco should have gone home but he hadn’t yet.
“Unless he’s done anything to you personally, you don’t have a reason to throw things at him,” Harry said as the boy went quiet. “Tell all your friends to stop bothering the Slytherins, the war’s over.”
“I don’t know if that’s encouraging or not,” Draco replies, straightening like he’s pulling himself out of the conversation.  “Let me get your radio, might as well pretend you’re here for a reason.”
“Bugs are cool,” Harry says, but without much enthusiasm. Draco gives him a skeptical look, and he shrugs. Luna has been running a column in the Quibbler on Neville’s coolest mushroom finds from abroad, so he has more than the average amount of energy for indulging the weird, random things people love.
Draco’s grip on her hand tightened, a warning sign Harry thought she might just ignore. “Did I not say that it was none of your business?”
“Can I help you?” He asked, shutting his book and holding it to his chest like he was protecting himself and also like he didn’t want Harry to see it.
Draco looks shifty, and Harry has the feeling that talking about his feelings is just as difficult for him as it is for Harry. “I’m still figuring out how to be a good person. It’s very strange, living with the fear that you’re going to slip back into that, that if you’re too cruel you’ll be awful again. It’s difficult when witticisms are your only emotional defense.”
Malfoy just looks down at the radio and then back at him, and Harry speaks again before Malfoy can say something too cutting.
“But you’re the one who kissed me,” Harry replied, feeling a grating irritation at how whiny his voice came out. He’d been thinking in circles the whole day, wondering what to do but never assuming that Draco would be so difficult. He realized, belatedly, that he’d never considered that Draco wouldn’t want to kiss him again, and then, more slowly, that he really did want to kiss him. Any person would, he reasoned, Draco was a mirage made for him.
Do you ever wonder if things could have been different between us? I expect not, you were always so busy saving the whole damn world. That’s not why I’m writing. I’m not sure why I’m writing. I just feel very alone. I think somehow that you would understand that.
“Great, thanks,” Harry says, taking the box. “Your wards look good by the way, it doesn’t look like anyone’s broken in, or even tried. I’ll let you know as soon as the reports on the potion come back.”
“Not really sure I like the idea of being locked in my own head, honestly,” Harry replied, and she gave a little shrug.
“I was wondering if there was even the smallest chance you could volunteer to be my dance partner,” Ernie said. “It’s still inter-house unity and I think if you offered, McGonagall might not say no.”
Harry goes to gather his things, then returns to Draco’s side as casually as he can while everyone tells Dara goodbye, leaving the rest of them alone in the kitchen. Harry’s trying his best to figure out how they’re going to gracefully exit said kitchen so he can have shower sex with Draco, who is doing an admirable job of acting chill considering they’d just been caught kissing by one of Harry’s most beloved friends. “Thanks for solving my case, Hermione,” Harry says, accepting a weird sandwich from Ron.
“Oh no, I have to pay you,” Blaise said, rubbing the mitten against his face, before leaning down to rub it against Draco’s, who squirmed away from him protesting that he’d mess up her makeup. “They’re nice mittens, it would be rude.”
Draco dappled kisses along Harry’s jawline, trying to pull himself together. He couldn’t find the anger back, mostly because it had mostly been a protective kind of fear. Harry had kissed all of the anger out of him, and left behind a technicolor sadness that pulsed cyan behind his eyes.
Harry’s already so turned on he can barely think straight and the awareness that Draco is definitely teasing him by moving his hand so slowly is only making it worse. “I’m close.”
“It’s a bit involved,” Harry said, waving her hand around to try and communicate something, though she wasn’t quite sure what. “Basically we have to wear emerald or she’s going to be very upset with me. She might kill me.”
Draco’s breathing picks up, becomes slightly panicked. Harry can hear him shift in his chair. “Stop.”
It was bad enough that Harry had testified to his and his mother’s innocence at their trials, he didn’t need him savioring around after that with his stupid righteousness. Just because they had their little staring contests over breakfast didn’t mean Harry was allowed to barge into his life like that. The smallest bit of him registered that Harry was probably trying to be nice, but it was horribly overshadowed by the humiliated bit of Draco that just wanted to stop owing Harry things.
“So you’re responsible for all the things that have happened to you?” Draco asks, a mean, nasal quality sneaking into his voice.
Harry can’t think of anything to say that doesn’t sound too sappy, so he just leans against Draco and and asks him about his favorite kinds of tea until he’s teasing him back again.
“The expert is actually Hermione,” Ron clarifies. “For her Ministry connections and superior intellect, not her daddy issues.”
The first time they fuck is terrible. Their bodies are not made for each other and Draco gives nothing, doesn’t seem to want to kiss him, will barely touch him. Harry is afraid to press against Draco’s skin because he's half terrified it will peel away like the film on old milk.
Draco harrumphed and didn’t deign to respond to that particular criticism, flipping the book back open on his lap. “It’s not awful.”
Draco’s lips quirked up at the memory, even as the other half of Blaise’s comment sank deep into the darkest parts of his heart. “And if only that first bit was true,” he said, picking up his bag with a huff. “Let’s go to breakfast before I give up and go back to bed.”
Bella and Andromeda hated each other for that reason, too. It was nice to know that they were willing to put that aside for his mum, though.
Harry watched Malfoy as he sat on the grass, away from the five of them currently sorting dinner. His chest ached for the hollow shell Malfoy had become. He seemed so isolated, his pale skin and hair a stark contrast to the deep rich earthy tones of the surrounding mountains. He couldn’t tell if Malfoy was alone by choice or not, and so he walked over and sprawled out beside the blond, setting Talgarth down next to him.
After a yell from downstairs, “come on you bastards don’t feed the stereotypes!” Harry grabbed Dean’s hand and bounded down the stairs.  Draco stared after him wistfully as the group of Gryffindor’s left the common room into the great beyond.
“Of course they’ll love it. Say, Harry. My dear friend is having a drinks party in two weeks, and it would really be wonderful if you could come” he perseveres.
“oh, Pansy” Harry whispered into her hair, rubbing his hand up and down her arm. She sniffled a bit, before saying,
Draco watched the Gryffindors now, huddled together. Their easy closeness made his chest tighten. Slytherins didn’t cultivate friendships like that. Their parents’ politics and potential arranged marriages and the emphasis on self-preservation severely impaired the ability to form strong, stable friendships. His resentment was a foul form of jealousy, and he didn’t know how she was going to survive this weekend, especially when he saw the tenderness with which Weasley helped Granger adjust her backpack straps, and the small smile on Potter’s face as he watched them; no trace of jealousy to be seen. He didn’t understand. It should be messy. Why couldn’t they be messy, so Draco could feel a tiny bit better about his own mess.
In turn, Draco told her about the farm, about how kind Sirius had been, how at home he felt there. He spoke of how nice it was to see role models in Remus and Sirius, and of course, he spoke about how fit Harry was. The latter was done in hushed tones, their heads bent close together with lots of giggling breaks. Draco loved being with Pansy, she was a safe space for him and he always felt like he was fifteen again around her.
“a poem known to muggles, yes, but written by a wizard” replied Luna as she knelt behind harry and started to plait his hair again- Dutch braids this time.
The first week of the half term passed uneventfully. Draco did all his schoolwork so it wouldn’t be a mad Sunday-night rush.
“Here, Draco. Harry said you might need it” someone said, passing him a bottle of water. No, not someone-Hermione! Yes, Hermione had come and now was lying next to Draco. He turned his head and smiled at her, and she smiled back. He liked her a lot. Ron, Luna and Ginny were all there too, and the group lay out on the grass until late, when the girls had to go and get the train home. Harry and Ron propped Draco up and delivered him back to his room. Theo was out, and Draco he had missed his first ever whiskey/wine night since year 10. The boys would not be pleased. Ah well, the boys could fuck themselves, Draco had spent the whole night with Harry, and he couldn’t be happier (or drunker, but that’s by the by).
Soon enough, the funeral party filed out of the church, their collective breath fog in the crisp, cold January air. Like a school of sombre fish, they gathered around at the grave side, and Dudley, as well as some other men Harry didn’t recognise, came out bearing the coffin.
Here she stopped to sip her tea, then set the mug down on the floor and tucked her feet up onto the sofa.
When Harry was sure Draco wouldn’t vomit on him, he knelt between Draco’s splayed legs and began slowly unbuttoning the vomit-soaked shirt, before stripping Draco of his trousers, and then hefted the blond into his arms before carrying him into Harry’s room, and tucking him under the covers, on his side so he wouldn’t choke. Harry placed his bin on the floor in line with Draco’s head and left a glass of water and hangover potion on the side of the bed before slipping out and going back to his friends.
He assumed their closeness indicated that perhaps Harry and Hermione were dating, and whilst none of the adults paid any heed, Draco noticed both Ron and Ginny glare somewhat at the two. Interesting.
“Yea he’s some slimy lad from t’village that won't leave me alone either. Not sure why everyone wants me. Maybe it's because I'm the only brown lad for miles around, makes me exotic” Harry said the last bit self-deprecatingly, and Draco felt surprisingly sorry for him. He had only ever been the object of unwanted attention from girls from the sister school, but he was mean enough that it soon turned most of them off.
Harry turned and led the way. When he opened the front door, Draco was hit by a wall of fragrance. The warm and heady smell of spices wrapped around him, cradling him and drawing him into the kitchen. At the stove stood a woman with her back to him. Her long grey hair was pulled into a single neat plait down her back, hanging over her soft cream salwar kameez.
Hogwarts may have never lost a Rugby game, but neither had Harry and Ron. It was a match made in heaven.
“I- thank you, Sirius” was all he could muster up, and Remus nodded at him, before announcing that he was off to make lunch. Sirius then fished his cane up from where it was lying on the floor, and used it to push himself up to standing.
Harry woke early, and he and Pansy sipped tea in sombre silence at the kitchen table whilst they waited for Draco to emerge, but he never did. It seemed that Draco’s alcohol-fuelled optimism dissipated over-night, and when it reached 11 am with no sign of him, Harry sighed and said to Pansy, “I think you should go and talk to him”
“come on, Pans. You can help me find a replacement shirt.” Harry said, setting off to his room, or his and Draco’s room now, he guessed. It was hard to be in such a young relationship when you already lived together.
“You’ll see her later, thank her then”  Remus said, placing plates of homemade quiche and salad in front of everyone, before sitting next to Sirius,  who immediately shifted closer to him on the bench.
“Molly made it” Sirius said from where he was sitting down, his cane resting against the table beside him.
“I don’t need your pity, Harry. You don’t have to like me, it’s fine” said Draco gently, lowering a hand to run it through Pansy’s hair.
“I’ve been busy, Gin. showing Draco around t’farm” Harry replied, and Draco saw him shift further away from her. He bristled a bit at being used as an excuse as Harry hadn’t really done anything of the sort, but he saw it for what it was; Harry had no interest in Ginny. Though it shouldn’t, the fact made Draco feel a vindictive sort of pleasure.
His father was stood by the wall, and Mrs Prewett was facing him, back to the wall, snogging his face off. One leg was propped against the wall, and his father’s hand was under the satin skirts of her cocktail dress, the other hand violently groping a breast. Draco couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t look away. He couldn’t think. Fuck. He hated his father so, so much.
When they reached Harry and Remus, Draco thought he might be sick. Harry was crouched on the ground, with his arm inside a sheep. The sheep was lying on its side seemingly blissfully unaware of the fist and forearm inside it. Draco felt horrified, which only intensified when he heard Harry grunt and then slowly pull his arm back out of the sheep. In his hand were the two spindly hind legs of a lamb, and soon the whole little animal was out and laying on the grass, surrounded by the sheep’s bodily fluids. Harry gently swiped his fingers around its nose and mouth, before rubbing its side and placing it by its mother’s head.
The food was delicious, and Pansy said so several times, much to Remus’ and Sirius’s amusement. Draco was just so happy to have her there to spend his birthday with, and he kept glancing at her out of the corner of his eye to remind himself that he wasn’t dreaming, this wasn’t one of their sporadic texts he could send or receive whenever he found signal in the blasted countryside, but she was actually there, her short-clad thigh pressed against his trouser-clad one, her elbow knocking his as they ate.
By the hair of their teeth, they avoided teachers and prefects, and got Luna and Hermione into their room. They all sat about chatting and catching up, and the girls had never seen the school before, so they were marvelling at the size of Harry and Ron’s shared dorm.
A massive pencil-case looking bag flew into her hand and she ushered Harry into the bathroom next to his room. She swiped golden shimmer over his eyelids and on the apples of his cheeks, before lining his eyes with a vibrant blue liner and forcing him to apply lip gloss.
After what felt like an age but couldn’t have been more than a few minutes, Pansy and Draco withdrew their heads. A few tears were silently winding down Draco’s cheeks, and Pansy looked livid.
“Okay Malfoy. Later though, I'm not too keen on an audience” Potter says from across the circle, winking at me, and I'm automatically hard.
It was clear to Harry that the team were friends in their own right, outside of Rugby, and they all did their best to involve Harry and Ron- they explained the stories behind inside jokes, showed photos of past matches, gave advice on the hardest schools to beat.
After Draco and I called it off, because the war was picking up, everything seemed to get better. Blaise grew up into an attractive man, which seemed to soothe his insecurities, and Draco was so distracted by being Voldemort’s pawn that Blaise replaced him as the king of Slytherin.
Here, Harry ran his hands down his body as he leant back, Dean doing the same- they had clearly made this dance together.
Harry couldn’t make out the words, but he could feel the anger and sadness in them and he hated that. He knew it was because they loved him, but he hated to think that anyone else would ever be affected by his upbringing. The pain it caused him was enough.
“I owe you boys big time. How can I repay you?” he said, and Draco knew that this was just as much Theo flaunting his wealth as it was him being thankful.
Draco nodded and led them across the pitch, behind the main castle and across the cloisters to a large stone building, old like humanities house but less grand and more like an abbey. Draco had known since year ten that after every victory (which was, of course, every match) there was an after party, but he had never once received an invite, and though informal, it was very much an invite-only affair.
The three of them laughed, and then Seamus and Dean stumbled down the stairs, still in underwear. Blaise gave a low whistle and said “if Potty’s out of play can I have these two”
And anyway, he had Pansy. What more could he want? Especially with her and Hermione getting on so well, and him fitting so seamlessly into that. It was nice. Really, really nice.
“Hey, Harry” Ginny said, skipping over to him, leaving Draco behind. Knowing enough of how the cows got milked, Draco just walked into the barn with the milking machine and opened the little gates to allow the first cows through. As he was doing so, he overheard Harry and Ginny’s conversation, and he peeked over the gate to get a look at them as they led the cows out.
His hopes are dashed when Rugby boy 2 runs in. now that he is closer to Draco he looks even more like an Adonis. Dark skin, green eyes, curly hair and muscles all over the place. He is sporting a pair of glasses that hadn’t been there in assembly that morning, and he had forgone the Hogwarts school blazer for an irritatingly stylish Polo Ralph Lauren jumper.
The horrifying ordeal- though Harry supposed it must be more horrifying for Draco to have to watch his best friend kiss his boyfriend- ended soon after that embarrassment, and Harry found himself back in the attic, staring hopelessly into Draco’s watery grey eyes.
Draco was dying. The muggle consultant hadn’t been kidding about the heatwave. He felt like he was melting. The full-coverage, all-black outfit had been a massive mistake and sweat was pouring down his back, making his top stick uncomfortably. He had never felt ore grateful for anything in his life- apart from maybe not being killed by Voldemort- than he was grateful that Potter was carrying half of his stuff for him.
At some point after breakfast, Ginny and Harry passed Draco off to Remus and wandered off somewhere, and Draco didn't see them again until lunch. They came in not looking at each other, both of them stiff and uncomfortable, and they sat as far away from each other as was possible given that there were only five of them at the table. Harry left the minute he finished eating, Ginny hot on his heels. Once they’d both gone, Sirius and Remus shared a look that told Draco that this was an ongoing saga between the two of them.
“Sleep usually. Harry is a massive cockblock” said Seamus, laughing when Dean slapped him on the thigh.
“No, of course not. It wouldn’t be an issue at all” Harry said very softly, before reaching out and tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. Draco loved it when Harry touched his hair.
She giggled and blushed, and said “thank you boys” before perching herself on Draco’s lap. After she had downed a few drinks, they all apparated to an alley next to the club, and made their way inside.
Harry tracked Hermione down in the library, closing her textbook so she had to pay attention to him. He learned forward, and relayed his plan to her, desperately hoping she wouldn’t disapprove.
Then, there was also the matter of his education. He had always seen himself going to uni; his father had given him no other choice, and whilst he loved to learn, he had no career in mind for himself, nor did he really know which course he wanted to do. He had thought about applying for English, or maybe French, but the more time he spent away from studying, the less the idea of studying more appealed to him.
Draco accompanied Pansy and Remus back to the station late the next morning, and clung to her on the train platform as if she was his lifeline.
“he says you like me” said Harry with a wink, relishing the blush that spread over Malfoy’s cheeks, he looked impossibly youthful and vulnerable; a different person entirely to the boy Harry remembered from before the war. It was a refreshing sight. Grinning, he leapt up and extended his hand to Malfoy, saying “Ron’s got firewhiskey for tonight, let’s go eat.”
As if sensing the emotion threatening to overwhelm Harry, Draco scooted his chair closer and lay his head on Harry’s shoulder, kissing his neck gently. Harry slipped an arm around his back, and kissed him on the top of his head.
Ron let him stop for a minute to catch his breath back, and Draco felt the sudden urge to cry. He was so far away from home, surrounded by people he neither knew nor understood, expected to work a punishing job that he had no experience in. He could see the summer and autumn play before him; painfully stiff joints and tired achy muscles and nights alone in the tiny house and early mornings with two boys who acted like he wasn’t there for most of the time.
“you don’t ever need to apologise Harry, but it’s fine. And anyway look on the bright side, this trip has so much potential. I used to camp with my parents all the time as a child and I miss it dearly. It will be the three of us again, but completely danger free. We can make a fire and have marshmallows and hot chocolate and Kendall mint cake for the hike.”
Harry thought Draco would smell a rat, as he has not been so formal since his initial letter to Narcissa almost three weeks ago now, but Narcissa assured him Draco would be too taken aback by the invitation than the wording. She said she would tell Draco of her decision to move in with Andy that evening when she returned home, after he would have received the letter. The two returned downstairs, where Andy was putting Teddy to bed. Harry’s heart jumped to see Andy taking such a hands-on role with Teddy again, but he also felt somewhat sad. He had thoroughly enjoyed being Teddy’s primary caretaker, and he didn’t want to lose him. The two women left soon, Narcissa gracing him with a rare kiss to the cheek as she left. Harry then floo called Ron, explaining the situation and asking for help with the bedroom. “I can’t say I’m particularly excited to live with him, but you should have seen Andy with Teddy today, and if her living with Narcissa means she can be a better Grandma, I would let Draco sleep in my own bloody bed.” “blimey Harry, he’s not even your son.” Grumbled Ron, continuing before Harry could open his mouth and object “I know I know, you’re doing this for him and also for yourself. It’s okay Harry, of course I’ll help. Charlie’s in town so I’ll get him to help too.” “you’re the best Ron, I love you mate” smiled Harry. He was secretly very happy Charlie was coming too. Harry never entertained the notion of getting with him; the Weasley brothers were brothers to him too, but a boy could look, and oh boy did Harry like to look at Charlie. He disconnected the call, and checked on Teddy before going to sleep, simultaneously apprehensive and excited for his new housemate.
Though not entirely sure why, Draco soon found tears meandering down his face like warm caresses, as Harry sang unrelentingly, unaware of the effect he was having.
Granger had mad tea with the left-over hot water though, thank god for small mercies. Pansy sat now, a steaming mug in her hand as she watched the Gryffindor men build a bonfire. She wondered why- they didn’t have enough matches for extra fires outside of lighting the camp stove. She said as much, and was taken aback by Potter’s answer.
But it is so insulting, and it’s hard to find the humour. Especially with Peterson, who is heading towards us now. I drain the rest of my wine, and grimace.
“Just focus on her being here now. I can leave youse, if you want more time with her?” he asked, and Draco was shocked at the apparent consideration. Harry seemed to really dislike Draco, and he had never struck Draco as being a particularly kind person. Nice, maybe, but not kind.
She slid her hand back into his as they walked back to the house, passing Harry who was carrying one of the benches for the table. He glanced at Draco, grimaced a bit and then ducked his head again. Draco wasn't sure what to make of his reaction and he saw Remus frown at Harry too.
“I never- I never notice?” He says, wringing his hands together and starting to pace. “Am I the worst boyfriend ever? Do you think I encourage it because Draco please, please believe me I would never, ever do that” he says, stopping pacing and dropping to his knees in front of me, wrapping his hands around my calves and looking up at me with a forlorn, pleading expression.
“We came to check on our visitor. From the sound of it, he’s not doing too well.” Harry said, and now Draco was even more confused.
Draco was left holding a baby at arm’s length, now scared he was going to be vomited on, staring at the retreating image of Harry’s muscular, dark back. An hour later, Draco found himself feeding applesauce to teddy with a small plastic spoon while Harry painstakingly iced a monstrosity of a chocolate cake. “it’s so much easier with someone here, you have no idea Draco.” Said harry, as he finally finished and put the cake in the middle of the table and began to lay plates around it. “I uh, I’m not really doing much at the moment. I can’t work until my 18 months’ probation is over, so I could come over a couple days a week and help out if you wanted?” Draco offered, trying to wipe baby food out of Teddy’s hair, with no idea as to how it got there. “that’s really kind of you Draco but please don’t feel like you must! I do manage okay” replied Harry. Draco gave up trying to clean the wriggling baby and turned to Harry. “seriously, Harry. It would get me out of the manor which is a godsend these days. I can’t stand it there, and I would love to know more about both my cousin and muggle life. We could see it as an exchange. I play au pair three or four days a week, and on those days, you teach me about the muggle world. The black box in your living room is muggle, and you bake the muggle way, and all of teddy’s toys, clothes, and most of your furniture is all muggle, so you clearly are living in both worlds. It would help me become less ignorant, and you would get a bit more time to relax.” Draco turned back to feeding Teddy, unusually scared for what Harry’s response would be. “god Draco that’s, thank you, so much. I’ll accept that exchange. Teddy wakes up around 6 most days, but I don’t eat breakfast until 8:30. So if you could get here maybe 9? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays? I’m at the burrow enough Saturdays that we shouldn’t schedule it in, and Molly won’t relinquish her Teddy time. I see Andy on Sundays. Soon though, I’m sure, you and your mother will be joining her on Sundays too. Does that work?” Harry asked, “as there is an exchange of sorts you can treat this as a real job with holiday days or whatever, just owl me in advance if you need the day off, or owl me in the morning if you’re sick.” Said harry, turning and then groaning at the sight of his godson covered in pureed apples. “I tried to keep him clean, I swear. I don’t know how it got in his hair.” Harry just laughed, and said “don’t worry Draco, it always gets in his hair. Can you run up and grab him a new onesie and nappy? I’ll just rinse him down in the sink. He can have his big bath later. You can help with that if you want.” Draco nodded and turned to go.
“no worries Blaise, I have learnt Draco is the same.” Harry and Blaise laughed, and Harry realised he really rather liked the two of Draco’s friends. He was glad of the advice his mind healer had given him after the year, that forgiveness is light as a feather, but hate is heavy as a brick. As much as he resented the three- specifically Draco and Pansy for their school and war-time behaviour, he could see that they had changed, and carrying around hate for them would just make his life miserable.
And they were kissing and it was everything Draco could have dreamed of. Soft, slow, sweet, gentle. Everything Harry had come to mean to Draco.
It was only the first Saturday of the year and Draco was already stuck. He deeply regrets taking French, and scoffs at the irony at having spent months every year there- skiing at Christmas and sunbathing in the south in the summer, and yet is utterly unable to do his French homework. Conversational French-not that he knows much of that either- is a world away from textbook French, and the A-level is already so much harder than the gcse.
“Alright mam?” Ron yelled as he herded Draco in the door. A large woman in an eccentric floral dress came out of the kitchen to greet them.
“You must be Pansy. Nice t’meet you” Harry said from the doorway, nodding at Pansy. Draco felt her hand clutch at his, her painted nails digging into his palm; their silent way of saying ‘oh my god he’s fit’ that they had been using since about age fourteen. Draco squeezed back to agree as he pulled her through the front door and after Harry as he walked ahead of them back to the big house.
“Talgarth likes you” replied Harry, grinning impishly. Malfoy blushed, and Harry thought there may be some truth to the words of his small scaled friend.
It’s made slightly bearable by the fact that Harry is entirely oblivious to everyone else’s wooing attempts and has only had eyes for me for the past half-decade. In fact, if it weren’t so insulting, it would be funny to watch Harry rebuff their advances without even noticing he was being come onto in the first place.
“God, where do I start?” Hermione laughed a little. “We’ve known each other since age eleven. Harry, Ron and I all went to school together in a slightly bigger village about a forty-five minute drive away. Harry and Ron had been friends forever and Harry and I gravitated towards each other as we were the only people of colour in our year. I think at first, Ron resented me for what he perceived to be me taking Harry away from him, because of course we had something in common he had no access to.”
Soon, Draco’s breathing deepened, and it was clear he was fast asleep. Harry still couldn’t sleep, and so he was wide awake three hours later, well into the early hours of the morning when Pansy slipped in in her underwear, rummaged around his drawers for a t-shirt, pulled out a Cannons one and slipped into their bed on the other side of Draco to Harry, wrapping herself around Draco in much the same way that Draco was wrapped around Harry.
Slightly shell-shocked, Draco nodded, picked up a shower caddy and his towels, and mindlessly followed them downstairs.
“Harry. Come and sit. I know what you’re thinking, and you’re staying here, don’t worry” Sirius said in a voice he might have used on an injured tiger; wary, soft, comforting, scared.
Draco’s Christmas was strangely the best he felt he had ever had. Without the imposing and constant disapproval of Lucius, Draco and his mother were able to eschew tradition and focus on being happy. Christmas eve was spent curled together on the sofa in front of a roaring fire, content in each other’s silent company, and Christmas day was filled with subtle joy at the freedom they now had. In Lucius’ absence, they ate pancakes for breakfast, and lunch was a small and sweet affair where Draco ate only desert, revelling in the liberty brought by his father’s absence. He had gotten his mother an ornate set of jewellery that was all hers; not an heirloom of the Malfoys or Blacks, but just Narcissa’s, and she could wear it without also donning the weight of pureblood familial expectation. She had accepted it with reverence and tears in her eyes. Draco received a silk bound volume of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and a small bottle of perfume that his mother had imported from France. ‘All in all’, thought Draco as he returned to his room, ‘that was a better Christmas than I could have hoped for’.
Draco then returned to Ron’s family and Hermione, and the latter immediately engaged him in conversation about a book they had both read recently. He got caught up in talking to Hermione who was a challenging conversation partner. She constantly questioned his opinions, confronting him with how many of his opinions on literary works were borne out of classism and his assumed superiority he had developed due to his race and class. He came out of the other end of the interaction thoroughly chastened and questioning his entire upbringing. That was the point of a gap year, he supposed.
“oh, Harry” Ron said, wrapping an arm around him where they were sat on the sofa in the cosy living room of Ron’s house.
Saturday dawned, bright and early, and Draco was apprehensive. Ron had said that Luna, Hermione and Ginny were all coming to the match, and that Hermione had asked Draco to sit with them. He didn’t particularly want to sit with Luna or Ginny- who he had discovered had been harbouring a crush on Harry since she had first met him at age eleven, and Ron teased Harry mercilessly about it.
…until the first sex scene. Coy, sweet, young lovers on their first time together, all candlelight and romance. Except Draco was so utterly and exceedingly aware of Harry sitting right next to him, the warmth coming off his body. The fact that Draco was red with embarrassment and half hard purely because he was watching a sex scene with Harry in the room. Half hard like he even wanted sex in the first place. Draco wished his body was in alignment with his mind on that one. He was so scared he would be making out with someone, and they would assume that because he was hard, he wanted to do more. Not that he had ever gotten that far with anyone, so this was really wishful thinking on his part, but with Harry sitting next to him, oh boy did Draco wish.
“Molly said something happened and asked me to check on you.” Came Hermione’s kind voice from behind him. Harry put his bowl down and turned in her arms, folding into the embrace and inhaling her comforting scent of lavender and ink.
Draco felt sadness at the resignation of his tone, but he also wasn't naive enough to think that everyone was accepted everywhere. He was also burning to ask what they had done for Harry. Sirius didn't seem inclined to share though, so he tucked it into the mental folder he had of Harry, which already included being called James, and the sadness it caused.
Oh shit. Draco really didn’t want to do this. unbidden, the image of his father fondling Prewett came to his mind, and he flinched, shutting his eyes.
Harry greeted Narcissa with a formal handshake and a “Mrs Malfoy”, before nodding at Draco with a “nice to see you, Draco,” before ushering them into the kitchen so he didn’t leave Teddy unsupervised for long.
The months that stretched before him were still daunting; as much as he loved the place he was in, the people still presented a problem. Of the three his age only one seemed to like him to any degree, and it was clear that he would never achieve the closeness with Hermione that she shared with Harry, or even Ron. Sirius and Remus were kind, but they were also twenty-odd years older than him, and he didn't really want to spend his summer and autumn third wheeling an adult couple when he was just a teenager. The other Weasley brothers were kind and polite too, but they were also much older, and their kindness often felt a little bit like pity.
“It’s dinner now. Nan’s here so I hope you like curry” Harry said, his lips twitching up in the corners. He looked relaxed, but there was a nervousness about his face that Draco didn't understand.  Draco nodded and stepped out, pulling the door closed behind him and toeing on his walking boots for the brief walk over to the house.
He was reaching to knock on the door when it swung open and Narcissa was standing there, looking like the perfect mum in a matching pyjama set and slippers.
“Yeah, that sounds good. We could watch a film?” Hermione asked. Draco nodded and offered her one of his t-shirts to sleep in. He let her change in his room and she came out again, his t-shirt, that was another school one, drowned her, covering her shorts and falling to mid-thigh. Before now, Draco hadn’t quite appreciated the height difference between them, but he often forgot how tall he was, because of how small he had always felt at home.
“No shit, Sherlock” Draco mumbled, stealing the joint from between Harry’s fingers. Harry frowned briefly.
The man who had picked him up-Remus, he had said his name was- had looked disdainfully at his outfit of casual slacks and a white polo shirt, and Draco fidgeted in his clothes as he sensed the drive, and his last bit of freedom for the summer, was coming to a close. The car parked outside of the house and Remus swung the door open and hopped out, his boots splashing in a muddy puddle. Draco shuddered and gently eased his door open, staring dejectedly at the muddy ground below him and the knowledge that he was about to ruin his Alexander McQueens.
Sirius pushed his half-drunk mug towards Harry, who accepted it gratefully and drank all of what was left at once, setting the cup down with a gentleness that seemed at odds with the strength he clearly possessed, before he swiped a hand across his mouth in an action that shouldn’t have been as attractive as it was.
Draco woke up feeling well rested for the first time in months. He felt a warm weight over his midsection and his heart fluttered when he realised he had been spooned by Potter all night. He was in deep. Too deep. Awfully, horribly deep. Oh, merlin.
He had no idea what he was doing, so he let Harry order for him, while he played with Teddy at their table. “you’ve been awfully quiet today” said Harry as he slid into the booth opposite Draco. Draco shuddered internally at Harry’s intense gaze. This felt all too much like a date, yet Draco thought Harry was with the weaslette. That being said, now he thought about it, Harry hadn’t mentioned the fiery redhead at all, and had they been together, surely, she would have helped harry raise the child? “what happened between you and Ginevra?” asked Draco, wincing at his lack of tact. Harry snorted. “nothing happened. Its more about what didn’t happen. Almost nothing did. We were an awful couple. The one time we did have sex it was awkward and uncomfortable. We barely talked, barely spent any time together. At first we put it down to the aftermath of the war but then all that cleared up and we still never saw each other. Then I decided to take Teddy and she saw that as me trying to settle down with her, ‘trap her in domesticity’ as she put it, but honestly, I hadn’t even thought of her when I agreed to take Ted. She wasn’t in my mind at all. That’s when we ended it, about mid-July.” Harry explained.
She placed Teddy into Harry’s arms and winked, saying “don’t worry; Daddy Harry is still my all-time favourite” Draco slapped her on the bum, and she giggled before going over and sitting on Blaise’s lap, and leaning over him to talk to Hermione. Harry gently bounced Teddy in his arms and grinned at Ron, motioning for him to sit next to Harry on the sofa. He leaned over to his best mate and whispered into his ear “you’ll get used to the dynamic soon. Bottom line is we all joke about them wanted to have sex with me. Actually, I’m not sure Blaise is always joking.” He said, before turning his attention back to the infant falling asleep in his arms.
“Nice to see you adults getting along then” laughed Sirius. “I’m going to go and find the love of my life, can the both of you entertain yourselves while I’m gone?” Sirius asked, heaving himself out of his chair and walking out of the room more smoothly than Draco had seen in recent days. It must be a good day for him, then.
“it’s not like the Great Hall, it’s constellations even during the day” said the dreamy voice of Luna at his shoulder. He leaned his head onto hers and smiled. He found that Luna’s companionship filled a deep emotional hole within him; there were no romantic or sexual undertones, but she steadied him, and he found himself always feeling calmer if he was touching her in some way. When they walked together, they held hands, and on particularly bad days at Grimmauld place he would share a bed with her, and when he couldn’t sleep her soft breathing and blond hair that glowed in the moonlight reminded him of what he had fought for, and what he now had to live for.
Draco nodded as he took in his surroundings. The square was lined with boutique clothes shops and tea shops and cafes and charity shops. It was very quintessentially British, the sort of place his private school mates’ grandparents would have lived. Life must be so boring here, he thought to himself. He couldn't imagine living in a place so small, where everything must have been so slow paced.
“Honestly Ron, I wouldn’t have come here if I had remembered that this was his school. In all the stress of the move I just completely forgot. I almost had a heart attack when I saw him in the corridor today…” Harry was saying, shrugging his bag off his shoulder and collapsing onto the sofa next to Draco’s.
“fuck” Harry whispered. He wasn’t sure he could take the emotional toll anymore. He hated thinking about his past, especially the Dursleys, and now he would have to deal with upset and guilt. It all felt like too much. In all the drama of shopping and films and crying, he had forgotten that Ron and Hermione were due round for a late evening tea and cake. He groaned, and then said to Pansy, “Pansy, I forgot that Ron and ‘mione were coming for tea. I need to make a cake; do you want to help me? I can apparate us both straight to the kitchen if you need?” she sniffled and nodded, so he eased them to standing before taking her hand for the side-along. He accio’d two Weasley jumpers for them, knowing the comfort a large knit jumper could bring was unrivalled, and started cooking while Pansy ate some of the left-over brownies, no longer crying. He heard the low murmuring of serious conversation in the living room as he gathered ingredients. He made an indulgent chocolate fudge. Partly because Ron would need placating due to the presence of Pansy and Blaise, and also because he needed comfort food. Once the cake was in the oven, he went to the living room door, and motioned to Draco to come without Blaise. He pulled Draco out into the corridor and said “Ron and ‘mione are coming for tea. I’m not good at all this emotion and I’m feeling quite overwhelmed after dealing with Pansy and hearing Blaise shout. If I put a film on, could the three of you watch it while I spend some time with Ron and Hermione? They just got back from Romania this morning.”
And, oh fuck, but it was yet another thing Draco hadn’t meant to say out loud, but obviously did, because the universe hated him.
Sirius seemed to find it the same, it seemed. Though weighed down by the pain of the past, Sirius seemed to get more and more animated during conversations about their family, and he mentioned more than once how nice it was to have a family member who didn’t hate him.
She was right. By the time everyone was packed, it was near one am, and Harry could tell she was knackered; not just from the transfiguration but the constant bickering about what was needed and what wasn’t needed and how hot would it be and would they need pyjamas and general complaining about the tent sharing situation. She had needed to do all of Ron’s packing for him, which Harry was grateful for as he had thought he would be doing it for Ron.
I turn around and sit at my desk, my back to him. I hear him heave a sigh, and then walk into my room.
“You are a genius, Harry” said Ron, already pulling out his phone to message their little group chat and ask the girls to catch the earlier train.
The film ended and Harry climbed out of the bed, saying “right, well if we both make notes on it, then meet again in a few days to make the PowerPoint? Does that work?”
“I’m not sure if you noticed, but my father didn’t even send me a birthday card. Just because I have ‘real’ parents doesn’t mean they love me” Draco finished, not letting Harry get a word in. his volume had not risen above a low murmur, and with that he stood up and walked away. He was too tired to deal with the can of worms that was his father, but that conversation had opened it up.
Draco fell into the monotony of his steps, walking a good few metres behind the rest of the group, surrounded by the sound of his breathing and the thump of his feet hitting the soft springy grass that carpeted the valley they were in. Before he knew it, Granger had announced that they had reached their campsite for the night, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that there was only a few hours hike the next morning before they would be safely back in Hogwarts, and he would never half to walk again. He then felt melancholy descend over him when he realised that he would never get to spend this time with Potter again, and he felt a horrible crushing sensation in his chest.
It felt good to change, to know he was working hard and accomplishing things, and eating well. He felt more like a man with every passing day, which was something he hadn't expected to find joy in.
Harry laughed and wriggled out from between the two Gryffindors. He linked arms with Blaise and Pansy and the three went down to the living room.
“He’s helping mam. He’s the only man in our family with any skill in t’kitchen” Bill said, and Charlie chimed in after, saying “There’s a little party in the village tomorrow for Saint Dunstan’s day, and mam bakes the cakes for it every year, and Ron has helped since he was tall enough to see over the kitchen counter”
“I saw the Prophet” he says, voice thick with sleep. “remind me to send ‘mione a gift basket, we owe her one”
As Harry re-watched the scene, he honestly thought he was going to be sick- was it possible to be sick in a pensive?- he was sure this was the end of the wonderful thing he had with Draco. Harry couldn’t look at Draco as Blaise kissed him, as Harry shoved him away, scolded him, and Blaise left. Harry made to pull out of the pensive, but the memory hadn’t ended yet. In his haste, he had pulled out the whole memory, including him practically confessing his love for Draco to Dean. Shit, shit and bollocks. He hadn’t intended for Draco to know that… yet. Oh fuck, it kept getting worse.
Bryn’s parting remark was another tidbit for Draco to file away, about Harry’s lack of a mother, possibly implying that he had one, but lost her. Bryn’s blatant flirtation seemed to rule out the mark being homophobic in origin.
The next morning, as he did every morning, Harry stumbled down the corridor towards Teddy’s nursery. He was more hungover than he thought he would be, and was deeply regretting not requesting the babysitting services of Molly or the Black sisters. Teddy would be going to one of them tonight though, as it was club night, and Harry was desperately excited. Despite being in a four-month-old relationship as an eighteen-year-old, since getting together with Draco almost all of his evenings were spent on baby duty. He was desperate for a proper night out again.
I hear the door open and close, and then I hear a tentative knock on my own, followed by a “Draco, can I come in?”
Draco took French, Classical Civilisation and English for A-Level. In the words of his mother, ‘humanities are the domain of the upper classes, my darling. Under no circumstances may you study anything else.’
“of course you do. okay, sure” Harry says, taking off his glasses and dragging a hand down his face before putting the glasses back on and sitting up, facing Draco and mirroring his pose.
Then Remus was hurrying Harry out of the door for more work and the conversation was over. Draco returned to his living room and tried to read but ended up over-analysing every facial expression Harry had made whilst Draco had spoken.
“Now, now don’t be rude. We’ve a visitor” Remus called out softly, going up to the closest cow and rubbing its head gently. The cow pressed its pink wet nose into his hand and Remus smiled widely.
He opened his eyes again, and the twins drew him into a conversation that felt mocking but wasn't overtly cruel. Draco couldn't quite place his finger on it but it definitely felt a bit like they were making fun of him. Sirius then rescued him by calling down the table if he liked the cider, and when Draco voiced his affirmation, Sirius described how it was homemade by them on the farm.
Feeling guilty for getting in the way of the two friends, Draco sat up a bit and said “I’m gay, Harry, so I was never going to get with her, and regardless, I think you owe Hermione an apology. She’s right, its none of your business”
The room was empty but for three people. Draco, and what must be his friends. One was black, with deliciously rich skin and depthless dark eyes. The other was a non-descript, tall mousey boy, who also looked like a poster boy for rich parents and private schools and personalised porches and homes in the country.
“I’m mad at him. Can I sleep on your sofa?” she asked, looking even younger than him at that moment despite the year she had on him. He also wished he had put a top on before opening the door.
“right. Club night tonight yeah? I’ll send Teddy to the Burrow and then floo Dean and Seamus.” Harry said, and was greeted with enthusiasm. Harry showered and changed, and packed Teddy’s overnight bag and half a banana loaf before floo’ing to the Burrow, where he had a lovely tea with Molly. Since Malfoy had moved in, Harry had missed being the sole man, and youth, in the presence of old ladies. They were a balm on his tired body and mind, and Molly’s presence always made him feel as if he were wrapped up in a blanket made of pure love.
That easy camaraderie, like you could tell each other everything, and know you wouldn’t get judged for it. His friends were wonderful, they just weren’t close like that. They weren’t touchy-feely either. Ron always had an arm over Harry’s shoulders, or they were fake wrestling, or shoving each other or tackling each other. It wasn’t gentle touching- not like hugging and linking arms or the like that Draco did with Pansy, the one female friend he had outside of school, but it was more than Draco had with Theo or Blaise.
Harry’s heart sank at the lack of reassurance, but he nodded mutely, before apparating back to the club, grabbing Pansy and apparating back to the attic, statute be damned.
“when I feel better tomorrow, you can tell me all about Romania. We will have to go through the living room, but not yet.”
“I think since then he’s always subconsciously associated Sirius’ family with the people who took his parents away. And whilst I think it was a fair pre-conception for him to have, the minute you proved you weren't like them he should have treated you with more kindness”
It was a bit of a startling realisation- how much he liked Draco, but not an unwelcome one. He talked to Ron about it when he returned home that evening, and Ron was supportive of it, which mattered massively to Harry.
“not really, Potter” Blaise growled, and before Harry had a chance to ask what was wrong, Blaise was grabbing the lapel of Harry’s shirt, slamming him into the wall and kissing him, rough and hard. Harry slammed his hands into Blaise’s chest and pushed with all his strength, causing the other man to stumble back.
He wriggled into his tightest pair of going out jeans, which were a deep black with a golden button and zip. He then chose one of the fancy shirts Pansy had gotten him. It was a deep blue, made of deliciously soft silk, and had no buttons on the top half, and so hung open down to his sternum. Ron would throw a fit when he saw it, as would Pansy, but for entirely different reasons.
Harry went to make himself a cup of tea before finishing the epic, and Draco resolved to offer his comfort to the raven on his return. He was beaten, however, when Harry returned arm in arm with Luna. The two got into Harry’s bed, and Draco watched while the two finished the poem, Harry crying again at the return of Patroclus’ ghost in book 23. Draco waited for Luna to leave, but to his dismay she donned one of Harry’s t-shirts as he stripped down to his boxers as he did every night, and the two fell asleep, his dark body curled around her pale one, and Draco tried to ignore the pain in his gut at the sight.
“it’s not the same Molly. He’s the closest thing I have to blood family, and he isn’t even related to me” Harry said into her shoulder. “I am so alone without him” Harry choked out.
Draco’s heart flipped at this. He was torn between joy at Harry’s declaration and invitation, and fear at the prospect of a party full of Gryffindors.
He knew he shouldn’t worry; he trusted Harry, and he trusted Ron to look after Harry, but he couldn't help himself. He so wished it was himself at Harry’s side during this, offering support during such an unimaginably complicated time, but he also knew why it wasn’t him. He knew the place Ron held in Harry’s life was special, he knew that Ron had seen Harry go through unimaginable pain, and suffering, and that he had been a sounding board for Harry in those times, a safe space.
Potter sounded so infuriatingly gentle and he had brought Draco food and he had noticed Draco’s absence and he wanted to talk and it was all just too much. He unlocked the door with his wand from the bed, as more treacherous tears slid down his damp cheeks. He felt the bed dip as Potter sat, and he looked up to see what dinner Potter had thought to bring him.
“I'll touch your hair forever if you want me to” Harry said in response, softly, breathily, before threading his fingers though Draco’s soft golden locks, stroking gently.
“Come on, let’s take advantage of the free champagne. He’s probably gone back inside, so if you could continue the girlfriend act…?”
The traditions of ‘poor people’ as his parents would automatically class people who lived in a village such as Hogsmeade would be laughable to his parents, and Draco wanted to keep his experience sacred and his own, instead of letting them step all over it. He wrote instead of visiting the nearby village and reading in his ‘quaint little sitting room’.
Effie came and made curry again, with a spinach dish that Draco couldn't pronounce the name of, but that he thoroughly enjoyed. The paratha and rice also made a return, this time with extra naan.
“of course they can, I’ll dress the bed for them in a minute. Ron and ‘mione are coming for dinner tonight too.” Harry says, bringing Draco his coffee and sitting next to him at the kitchen table, whilst teddy plays with his dragon toy in his highchair.
Draco dragged Harry every which way, and bought probably more clothes than he knew what to do with. He pestered Harry on muggle fashion, and much to his chagrin he ended up buying several pairs of ‘trackie bottoms’ as Harry called them, for his time with teddy. He bought some plain sweaters and hoodies for the same purpose. Harry bought himself some hoodies too, as the weather was getting colder. “right Draco, if you’re not too overwhelmed, we could get lunch, there’s a great muggle place near here called Wagamama’s’, that does Asian fusion food.” Harry said, retying Teddy on a bit tighter. Draco was indeed feeling quite overwhelmed, so he just nodded.
“oh.” Exhaled Draco quietly. He straightened up, and reached a shaking hand out to place it on Potter’s chest. He tilted his head up a bit and suddenly Potter’s lips were on his again. Soft, insistent and oh, so much better now he was sober, and fully aware of what was happening. Too soon, Potter was pulling away. “I was sent here to find you and tell you we’re going back now.” He said, a small smile on his face. He took Draco’s hand and pulled him back towards the others.
Draco hadn't quite been able to hide the hurt on his face when Harry said he was going without him, but Harry knew he had to put himself first in this situation, and Draco had been so sweet and understanding about it.
Draco awoke at dawn the next day, already brimming with excitement for Harry’s imminent arrival. He wasn’t coming until 11:30, but by 7 am Draco was dressed, fed and ready, and spent many restless hours trying to read or watch tv and not being able to focus on either. His mother teased him mercilessly when he told her who was coming, which made his nerves worse and time move even more slowly.
“good evening Eighth years. I hope that you had a pleasant dinner, and that you are all excited for your excursion tomorrow morning. When you return to your rooms tonight, there will be a muggle camping backpack for you to pack necessary clothes and toiletries. Tomorrow you are expected in the great hall at six a.m sharp. There you will be given tents, sleeping bags, camp stoves, food and water bottles. The water bottles are charmed to constantly refill, but the food has been selected by the muggles we consulted when planning this endeavour. I would recommend that you all get an early night, and ensure that your routes have been planned thoroughly, I can assure you that you will not wish to set up your tents in the dark without access to magic.”
“I think today is going to be another of those times” he says, crossing my floor and turning my desk chair round so I’m facing my bed, which he then sits down on. I distantly notice that he put a t-shirt on before coming to talk to me. He heaves a sigh again, and I am suddenly scared for what he is going to say.
“has anyone told you that assumptions make an ass out of you and me?” quipped Draco, lacking his usual malice. He held a black-tipped porcelain hand up when Harry tried to defend himself, and then ran said hand through his short platinum hair. “yes, I’m gay, Potter, you assumed correctly… this time.”
“Does Draco not like to share?” asked Blaise, pouting and sitting in the armchair, legs wide open looking like the picture of decadence and debauchery.
She said, backing away from the notice board. Ron finally shoved his way to the front. “THEY’VE DONE TENT PAIRINGS”
Almost an hour after they had finished breakfast, and they were just leisurely chatting, Draco stumbled in looking very much worse for wear. He collapsed into a chair and Harry wordlessly levitated the breakfast he had saved under a stasis charm over to him.
Draco felt the wood slide through his gloved hands and into the ground and he marvelled at the strength of the man before him.
Soon enough, it was nearing eleven, and the dorm prefect would start doing the rounds, ensuring everyone was where they should be. Draco stood to leave, and the room started to spin. He could feel himself swaying on the spot. Theo had gone off somewhere to facetime Daphne, likely to engage in whiskey-fuelled phone sex, and so Draco was left to make his way back to his room alone.
He hated it; it made him feel vulnerable and exposed. His mindhealer- a French woman his mother had insisted he see over the summer- had explained it was probably due to him associating Potter with too many elements of his freedom; the fiendfyre, the death of Voldemort and ensuing end of the war, the fact that Potter had spoken for Draco and against Lucius; not only gaining Draco freedom from prison but also freedom from his father. She maintained that as time went on and Draco settled into being alive and free from the events of his past, this ‘anxious attachment’ would end. He sincerely hoped it would.
“So am I” Sirius said, eyes sad. “There were four of us at school. James, Remus, Peter and myself. Peter left for America after we graduated. Didn’t even come back for the funeral, the bastard” he elaborated. Draco was taken aback by the venom in Sirius’ tone when talking about Peter.
The enter the common room to get to the door that leads to the stairs that leads to their room- the place was like a maze and all the buildings were huge.
“Oh, Draco, that's so sad” Hermione breathed and Draco chuckled, releasing her hand and draping his arm around her shoulders. She cuddled into his side and said “well I’m your friend. Fuck boys, who needs them?” and Draco laughed and agreed, secretly suspecting her declaration may also have had something to do with a certain Ron Weasley.
After a few drinks each, they returned and sat on a bench in the church yard and watched the blackbirds sitting on the graves. Ron began to sing under his breath
Ron and Ginny near immediately went back to their other conversation, and no one but Draco seemed to notice their reaction to Harry and Hermione’s closeness. Harry wraps his muscled forearms around Hermione’s middle and leans his head on her shoulder. At this, Draco notices Ginny looking again, her face hard, but Ron resolutely looked away.
Harry threw himself on the sofa, and to his surprise, Blaise flopped on top of him. Maybe Blaise wasn’t taking the piss.
“In you go, it's in the common room, you’ll hear which room” Dean said, nodding at the open door to the building, where Draco could already hear the faint beat of drum’n’bass. That’s another reason he resented the rugby boys. Their music taste was appalling, for lack of a better descriptor. Linking his arm with Hermione, the four of them made their way in and down the hall. The music got louder and louder and by the time they reached the common room, Draco could swear the floor was shaking.
Pansy gave him a curious, undiscernible look, then nodded her head and gracefully made her way out of the kitchen, large mug of tea in hand for Draco.
“He looks like you, Harry!” Ron said, pointing at the boy in the middle, clearly the captain. Though his skin was somewhat darker, the likeness was clear.
“Yeah, it is,” Draco whispered back, his fingers drawing shapes onto her t-shirt above where her belly-button was.
They were in Harry’s room- Draco had been too scared to tell his friends the true nature of his relationship with Harry, lest it get back to his father, and so they had to spend most of their time in Harry’s room. Ron often graciously left for the library or common room, but Draco had come to really like Ron. Mainly for how much help, friendship and support he provided Harry, but also for Ron in his own right. He was funny, in more of a ‘laddy’ way than Draco was used to, but funny nonetheless, and he doted on Hermione in much the same way Draco doted on Harry.
If Draco didn’t know better, he would have thought that Harry had spent the last two weeks flirting with him. There were a lot of pet names, ‘sleeping beauty’ if he woke up late, which was happening with increasing frequency, and ‘blondie’ was a particular favourite, which Draco pretended to hate but secretly loved.
“wait until you try his cake, its orgasmic” mumbled Draco. “Draco darling, you do realise Potty dearest is back with us now” said Pansy with faux sweetness.
A heavy melancholy settled over all the eighth year Gryffindor’s as they waited for Ron’s return, his absence a painful reminder that they could not emotionally afford to lose anyone else. Harry and Hermione were everywhere together in the ensuing days, and much to Draco’s delight, Luna spent a lot of her time with him. She would hold Draco’s hand while walking to class, lie on his lap as the fire burnt low in the common room and Draco realised that perhaps this was Luna’s form of companionship, and that the twist of jealousy he felt seeing her and Harry together was entirely unnecessary. With this revelation, a weight that Draco hadn’t even known was there lifted off his shoulders, and he settled into being the male mirror image to Luna’s white hair and porcelain features. They could have been twins, he thought one night as the two sat, nursing mugs of steaming tea and staring at the fire. Both lithe, slim, blond, and somewhat waif-like.
“My brother’s gay” said Ron, nodding seriously. Harry rolled his eyes. He knew Ron had good intentions, but it did sometimes come across weirdly, which it had just done, judging by the way in which Wood was regarding him.
The sound of food and rest for his weary feet nearly brought Draco to tears for the second time that day. He hadn’t even realised how hungry he was until Remus mentioned breakfast, but now it was all he could think about.
Remus’ eyes filled with love and Draco had to look away for a moment. His Father had never looked at his mother like that.
The blond instantly yielded, sighing and melting into Harry’s body. The kiss was soft, intimate, gentle. Harry cradled Malfoy’s face with his hands, revelling at the softness of Malfoy’s cheeks, the soft strands of his hair tickling Harry’s knuckles. After not nearly long enough, Harry pulled back, and whispered “sleep” against Malfoy’s lips, before turning Malfoy around, and wrapping his arm around the blond’s middle, pulling their bodies flush together. He heard Malfoy sigh contentedly, and Harry kissed the nape of his neck before closing his eyes.
He stepped aside to let her in but instead of walking past him she hugged him, which was a nice surprise. Draco finally felt like he’d made a friend. She then sat on the sofa and patted the cushion next to him, motioning for him to sit with her.
Harry was shocked that McGonagall had said that speech without seeming to breathe, but he guessed (correctly) that she wanted to say her piece before he could resist or interject. Harry sighed, and nodded. He was too grateful for all that she had done, and all she continued to do, to deny her this. He was also hopeful for a year free from fighting, and anger, and division. Whilst friendship may have seemed like a stretch, Harry wanted peace, and he had a feeling, from seeing the pristine black of Malfoy’s nails, and the lack of robes in the Great Hall, that he and Malfoy could find common ground in an assumed shared queerness, if nothing else. Harry was desperate for a friendship like that; he had Hermione to share his racial with, and Ron was family to him, but in his sexuality, he felt quite alone, especially seeing how easy Ron and Hermione could love each other, no one could object to it, say it was ‘wrong’ or ‘unnatural’, the words of his uncle Vernon coming back all too quickly.
“I understand, Harry it's okay” Draco said into his chest, overwhelmed with relief that Harry still wanted him.
He showed the phone to Sirius, happy to have found another person who was unequivocally in his corner.
Draco then called his mum as they all went inside. It all felt so surreal to Harry. To think that Draco liked him so much he lied to get off school just to see him, and to think that Narcissa cared enough to let him; not just to let him skip school but to drive him all the way to Harry’s home. The empty space that had invaded his chest since the lawyer had told him the news filled, just a little bit, with warmth from the sheer force of love of the people around him.
“There are certain things a child shouldn’t know about their parents, but you are nearly a man now, and so I am going to tell you something. It might upset you, but know that I never want to hurt you.
With the plates and mugs all stacked in the drying rack, Draco made his way back across the little lawn that stretched between his cottage and the farmhouse. He carefully unlaced his boots at the door, and found a book that seemed interesting before settling into the little armchair.
“It took a long time for them to get used to us, and I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we don't live here, so they never have to see us be that affectionate or anything. We only come to this village for the communal events. Not only are we careful to not be overly affectionate in front of everyone, but we also almost always have Harry, and the locals will always love us more for what we have done for Harry than they’ll hate us for being gay.”
At one forty-five, the girls arrived, and Hermione found him in the library and hooked her arm through his, leading him to the field as if they had known each other for ever, rather than having only met once. It was a nice feeling. Even if things went nowhere with Harry, Draco thought he might always love him for bringing more friends into Draco’s life. At the field, Luna linked her other arm through Draco’s, waxing poetic about how lovely it was to see him again, and Ginny just looked him up and down and said “so you’re Draco”
Draco, drained from the mortification of laying himself bare to all those he had hurt, putting himself at risk of more pain, more suffering, just wished to slide into bed with ‘Fire from Heaven’, and fawn over the budding romance between Hephaestion and Alexander. Yet when he entered his room, he was faced with the high-pitched voice of a singer he didn’t know, and Harry. Harry Potter stood in the middle of the floor, body facing Draco but head to the ceiling, eyes shut as the so often were these days, white t shirt stuck to his skin with sweat, jean clad hips swaying seamlessly with the beat. He was flawlessly matching the girlish pitch of the singer, despite the deepness of his normal voice. ‘ain’t no particular sign I’m more compatible with, I just want your extra time and your… kiss!’ and on that tantalising final word, Harry’s head came down, and he threw his eyes open, bright green meeting stormy grey, his chest heaving, and easy smile gracing his lips as he looked that the blond in front of him, agape and seemingly awe-struck.
“I’m afraid I can’t help much, and I can’t say I’m enamoured with the idea of Lucius banging down my door claiming that I’ve kidnapped his son, but I would love for you to stay with us.” Sirius said, before pausing, opening his mouth, shutting it, and opening it again.
The three stumbled through the door of Grimmauld as it began to get light outside, and all collapsed onto Harry’s bed, which was just about big enough to fit three.
“my, my Potter. You look even better than the last time I stayed here. Still not as good as you do naked” said Blaise in his deep, sensual voice, stepping over the threshold and wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulder and steering them inside.
It suddenly hit Draco that Harry was much too young to have taken on all the stresses of parenthood. He looked so fragile in Molly’s arms, clutching at her while his body shook with tears. Draco felt like an intruder on this moment, not knowing what to say or do with himself.
The entered the room, and Ron immediately made a beeline for Hermione, who’s face lit up at the sight of them. They looked so happy with each other it automatically made Draco happy to see it.
“I did the GCSE. Numquam and quamquam and all that” Harry replied, laughing as if he was used to his intelligence being underestimated and undermined, and used to proving people wrong.
“Shit, you’ll be caught” Harry said, clambering out of the massive four-poster bed and herding the boy into their bathroom. He barely had enough time to leap back into bed and grab his book before their door opened again, and- fuck. It was Cedric. Of course, Cedric was their house prefect.
“Hey, Potter” Malfoy breathed, the smell of firewhiskey ghosting over Harry’s face as Malfoy giggled again.
Draco woke up to the worst headache he had ever had. He immediately knew he was better off than Theo, because he had been woken up by the sounds of violent vomiting coming from their bathroom. Draco groaned as he tried to sit up, and saw that he was still in his clothes from the night before. Those wrinkles would be a nightmare to get out. The whole outfit would have to go to the dry cleaners. What a start to a Sunday.
“Honestly? Yeah” Harry replied, holding his hand out for the joint. Draco kept it a bit longer though, taking a second inhale and relishing a little in making Harry wait before passing it back. Harry smoked with his eyes closed for a few minutes, and Draco drank in the sight before him.
“you’re fucking bevved, Draco” he heard Harry say from somewhere above him. Draco hummed in agreement, before feeling Harry shift and stand beside him. He grumbled in protest, before he felt hands haul him to standing too. He was entirely unsure of where they were going- between his state and the darkness he could barely tell up from down- and soon Harry was tugging him back down again. He flopped onto his back in the grass that he found underneath him. He didn’t know where Harry had taken him- the school grounds were sprawling, and it was too dark to tell which buildings were which.
“Some of Molly’s boys are here to help Remus around the farm, so you’ll meet them later. Ron’s older brothers. I thought today I would take you round the local village and get to know my cousin a bit better”
God, Harry’s voice sounded sexy like that. All gravelly and even deeper than normal. Draco nearly swooned.
“That it is, but I’ve never seen a man and woman more in love than Molly and Arthur, even if they have a unique way of showing it,” Sirius replied, smiling gently at Draco. It made Draco relax for the first time since he arrived, the look of friendship on Sirius’ face.
“Well as it’s your birthday you have no farm duties today. Unfortunately I have some accounts that need going over so if you don’t mind returning to the cottage for a little while?” Sirius asked, looking apologetic. Draco was so focussed on this that he missed Harry smirking a little into his mug of tea.
Once at the Burrow, Molly insisted on feeding them, and it was an hour of treacle tart and pork pies before they managed to escape with Teddy in tow. Teddy was crying when they arrived back at Grimmauld, so Harry took him straight to the nursery. As much as he loved his nights out, he loved Teddy a hundred thousand times more, and getting him back after a night away was still such an emotional feeling. Harry loved how perfectly the small boy fit in his arms. Teddy was still restless even after countless story books, so Harry decided they can indulge in a film. He puts some trackies and an over-sized t shirt on, and takes the small boy downstairs.
“Why does he always have to be like this?” Hermione asked, angrily. Draco lifted an arm and she immediately tucked herself into his side, clutching her mug in both hands. “Whenever he’s in a good mood he’s all about letting Ron and I figure it out for ourselves, but the minute he’s backed into a corner he gets defensive and weaponises it against us.”
“tough luck mate,” said Ron, voice dripping with pity and distaste at the name plate on Harry’s door; ‘H.J Potter & D.L Malfoy’. Harry knew this was what McGonagall meant; he could feel the line of boys behind him waiting with bated breath for his inevitable rage-filled outburst.
“there’s nothing to forgive, Mrs Malfoy. I do, however, have a favour, or a request of sorts I suppose. As you know your sister Andromeda is Teddy’s grandmother, and she’s very overwhelmed with grief at the loss of Tonks and Lupin at the moment. I was hoping you could write to her maybe, try and rebuild the bridge between you. She told me she missed the time you two spent together as girls.” Harry said, shifting in his seat. Narcissa’s tears started in earnest now, and she looked at Teddy reverently before saying, “I miss my Andy so much too. Would she meet with me, if I asked?” she asked, looking up at Harry, her grey-blue eyes boring into his green ones.
“are you- I mean, are you gay, Malfoy?” Harry finally asked, biting his lip and looking a bit embarrassed of the question.  Draco was too shocked to spit out a typical Malfoy brand scathing response (‘what? Scared I’ll bum the saviour?’ later came to mind). Stupidly, all he could think of in the moment was a very inarticulate “uh,, why?” (there goes ‘living proudly’ you coward, he scoffed inwardly)
“that’s rich coming from you Malfoy. By your own admission, you’re still a virgin. How can you care who I fuck when you can't get any?” Potter is smirking now, and again I am reminded of my own powerlessness. I used to be the Ice Prince of Slytherin; he is now the Fire King of the whole world. I am nothing before him.
“I’ve not kecks that’ll fit him” Harry said and Ron nodded and said “Ginny might, though they’ll be short”
“I never said sorry. For your father. I know this will seem insincere because I hated him but, he was still your dad and I am sorry that he died.”
“Reet lad, I just need you to hold the posts still while I hammer ‘em” Remus said, standing and kicking over the rotted wooden posts before picking up the new ones. He passed one to Draco, showed him the divot in the ground where he was to place it, and then picked up a mallet and got to work.
“so you mean to tell me you spent all night at a gay club and then came home to sleep near-naked in the same bed as Thomas and Finnegan?” the blond spluttered. Blaise chuckled at him, and Pansy sighed and said “I wish I had been in that bed”
“Your grandma cooks really well” Draco said, not knowing what else to fill the silence with. He was worried for a second that Harry would withdraw at the mention of his grandma, but instead he offered Draco a sincere look and said, “aye, that she does. Nothing better than Indian food”
At about six, Harry closed his laptop and sighed, pulling out his phone. Soon after, the rest of them followed, and by about six forty-five, they were chatting about the upcoming holiday, and their plans.
“of course, mate, I'd say we have at least an hour yet, though. Grab a pint at that pub round the corner?” Ron asked. Harry grinned at him.
It is true, but also a subtle hint that Harry needs a bit of break from the suffocation of pity, no matter how well meaning it is. Harry loves him for it.
“I'm sorry I was so obvious. And it's okay, I know they understand more than I do, and you’re here now” Draco said, all his insecurity dissipating in the face of Harry’s presence, his earnest apologies.
Draco tried not to be offended that Hermione assumed he’d judge Harry and Ron for their decisions, but he also had to concede that it was a valid observation to make, and had she told him when he had first arrived he probably would have reacted with disdain.
Draco hadn’t noticed that darkness had fallen during his sojourn in the kitchen, and Harry was swallowed by blackness. Draco was too used to the light pollution of London and was startled by the impenetrable blackness of the air around him.
“how am I supposed to convince him. He barely trusted me not to do a runner before this!” Harry replies, feeling more and more stressed by the minute.
“I must say I’m excited to be cooked breakfast. The food last night far exceeded my expectations” said Pansy.
Finally, practice was done, and Harry and Ron, sweaty and high on endorphins made their way back to their dorm house, grinning and half-wrestling, happy that their new team was so welcoming and so good at rugby.
Eventually she emerged, and she looked lovely. Her sleek bob was pinned back on one side with golden kirby grips, and her dress was a long floaty affair. It was a pure white with broderie anglaise, and she looked a little bit like an angel.
“good afternoon, eighth years. I am here to tell you about an exciting opportunity we are able to provide as part of our post-war muggle integration programme. Before I explain, I must say that I consider it to be a wonderful idea that will strengthen bonds and allow you all to develop new skills. Now, I wonder if any muggle-borns amongst us could tell me what the Duke of Edinburgh Award is?”
He explained the meeting to Ron and Hermione the next day, when they dropped by. Hermione was encouraging, but Ron was wary. He relented a bit when he saw the love in Draco’s eyes when he saw the photo, and when Harry had explained how loving and maternal Narcissa had been. He had received a letter from both Malfoys two days after their tea as well. Narcissa’s had thanked him for the effort he had made again, and explained that she had owled Andromeda and the two had arranged to meet for coffee at a muggle establishment. Harry had responded inviting her to babysit Teddy the next week, and with an envelope full of muggle notes, as he had assumed she may need them. The letter from Draco was more surprising, however. It had read
The image that conjured was so sweet. Draco had never done anything like that with his mum. She used to take him to art galleries sometimes, and then to posh cafes afterwards, but she was never an ‘arts-and-crafts mum’ as she referred to them, usually with disdain.
“Really, not even to the loo?” Peterson sneers and Harry may be a bit oblivious, but he knows when someone is trying to be cruel. He’s spent too much time with me.
“I can’t help but think that is why your mother sent you to us” Sirius said, his tone growing warmer. Draco looked at him in confusion.
“I had no idea mate. It's cool they all went here though. Remus must have as well.” came Ron’s voice from behind him.
“easy there Malfoy” he said in his warm deep voice. Draco was so focused on the warmth of the hand on his shoulder he forgot to shrug it off, forgot to act like Potter was his least favourite person on the planet.
He desperately disliked the person he had been at school and the longer he was here the more he could begrudgingly admit that his mother was right. This was a chance for him to have a completely clean slate and decide what kind of person he wanted to be.
“I’m sorry for being a dick at the beginning, but Sirius’ family are  t’worst and I just couldn’t understand why he’d let one of youse stay with us, yeah? And you came and you were so posh and shit and I just, I didn’t like you”
When he returned to his room, he saw a small package on the bed. Opening it hesitantly, he saw what looked to be a white version of the small black box Harry carried with him always, and a set of the white wires that were perpetually attached. A note fluttered out, which read: “Merry Christmas, Malfoy. This is an iPod like mine, and I took the liberty of downloading Hozier’s entire discography for you. Turn it on with the big button in the middle, put the headphones in and then press the ‘play’ button, which is the little sideways triangle. -Harry”. Draco was so overtaken by the kindness from Harry of not just the gift, which cannot have been cheap, but also the forethought of having it delivered to the Manor.
“Hey, little man.” Harry whispered now Teddy was awake. He kissed Teddy’s forehead repeatedly until the little boy was giggling and clapping his chubby little hands.
“Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good” Harry said, clambering onto Draco’s bed and pulling Draco next to him.
Sirius sat next to Remus, who was watching his limp with a concerned expression. One of the ginger men shifted up to allow Draco to sit, before passing him a bowl filled with pasta with tuna and sweetcorn.
“REMUS” Sirius yelled, and the man came running.  “What is it, love?” came Remus’ gruff voice. Remus walked in and stood behind Sirius’ chair, bracing his hands on the armrests and leaning over to look at the screen.
Harry surveyed the pitch before running onto it. He had been welcomed into the fold so far, but the first training session would really show what the power dynamics were, how the team worked together- if it worked together at all.
“when I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror, Potter, I see a person who used to be bad; a person who is seen by all as bad, and so I do everything in my power to make sure that my actions are good. Our actions make us who we are, Potter. I get up, and I always let Theo use our shower first. I give Pansy my bacon at breakfast. I still do Goyle’s homework for him. In the library, I study with Hermione because Ron hates it so much, and I let her talk as much as she wants. I give Neville plant cuttings from the Manor garden so he can grow them here. I lend him herbology books from my mother’s personal library. I plait Padma’s hair for her because Parvati isn’t here to do it for her. That’s why everyone loves me now, because everything I do, I now do with someone else’s feelings as my priority instead of my own.”
Soon, Ron and Hermione burst in, replacing the two women on the sofa, and begin cradling Harry, looking for all the world as if the golden trio were back in the Gryffindor common room after a particularly gruelling week.
“I didn’t say I had brought you dinner I said I brought you food” retorted Potter, green eyes bright with mirth. Draco rolled his eyes but crawled over the bedsheets towards Potter, who dumped the food between them and started unwrapping a chocolate frog, scowling when he saw his face look back at him on the card.
At eleven, Draco came down, and lay with Harry and Teddy and the three of them watched the telly. It felt as if they had been together for years and Teddy was their very own son, which was a strange if not unwelcome feeling.
They talked about future plans; Ron saying he was going to work in the joke shop, Parkinson saying she was interested in pursuing muggle fashion, and Hermione replying that she could help Parkinson apply to central saint martins. Harry voiced his wish to travel far and wide before even considering work, and Zabini said he was off to Italy with his mother and step-dad number 5.
If boy number 1’s key features were ginger, tall and freckled; boy number 2 was strong, dark and handsome. He looked like an impossibly muscled Dev Patel type, and it was all Draco could do not to drool. He had a strong jaw, thighs that looked able to crush watermelons, and arms that looked as if they could rip tree trunks from the ground. He was wearing those awful rugby shorts that were too short for decency and exposed an expanse of strong, brown thigh.
All too soon they were walking again, and the burn in Draco’s legs was becoming unbearable. The sun beat down on his back and neck, and his hair stuck to him with sweat. He felt utterly uncomfortable, only exacerbated by Potter talking to his snake again, and Draco felt his steps slowing as the hours trickled by slowly, and the sun changed its position in the sky, slowly reducing the intensity with which it shone over the Brecon Beacons that surrounded them.
Sirius sighed. “I had hoped Harry would be a friend to you, but unfortunately he seems to believe the poison in my family has spread to you- no offence”
“Please” said Draco, and Remus said “for me, love” and Draco was struck by the easy love between these two men. He wondered if his father knew the family he had sent his son to. Surely if Lucius knew the two men were together he would have never allowed Draco to stay with them.
“it's not okay, Ron told me how stressed you were, I'm sorry. I just couldn’t face it. I know people pity me, but seeing it so clearly on your face made it hard, I'm sorry. I want to spend every day with you from now on” Harry breathed, before kissing Draco so hard Draco’s knees went weak.
“I was so scared that you wouldn’t be here when I woke up. that you left Teddy with me because you were going somewhere. Going to see-“
“You were t’one to teach me about boundaries. What am I supposed t’do when she won't respect them?” was Harry’s reply. Draco inched closer to the door.
Draco watched him, memories of being silently held by the saviour the night before floating around in his head. It was curious, the blond thought, that Harry hadn’t said anything. No soothing words of understanding, comforting sweet nothings whispered into the darkness, just strong arms, long hair and silence.
He was lucky, and always wound up with one of his friends as a roommate, this year was Theo, and so at least he knew he wouldn’t be sharing a room with either of them. Well. It could have been luck; it could have been Lucius Abraxas Malfoy being on the board of governors. Draco was never quite sure when and where his father interfered with his school life. Direct educational interference was an impossibility, however when Lucius was being particularly cruel, Draco liked to think that always rooming with Theo, Blaise, Greg or Vince was a fatherly kindness rather than pure coincidence.
They sat down for cake, Teddy eating more marzipan in his highchair, and Harry smiled at Draco. Hesitantly, Draco offered a soft, gentle smile in return, and Harry knew then that everything would turn out okay. Draco was still here, still smiling at him, and that's what matters.
“you though, Potter, you don’t do any of those things. You never fly with Ron when he asks, even though he only asks when he’s thinking about Fred too much. You always find an excuse not to study with Hermione even though she does it so she can spend more time with you. You are curt, sullen and impolite. You never attend the Friday eighth-year common room parties, you sit alone in most of your lessons, you’re late to every meal so none of your friends ever get to speak to you. You, Potter, are acting like an arsehole, and you have done for weeks, and now everyone is just a bit sick of it. I know it’s hard to hear. It was hard for me to face how awful I was too, but its necessary. Think about it, whilst I go and see that Hermione is okay”
And so, Harry does what he always does when he feels overwhelmed. He bakes. In a surprising turn of events, he finds himself making his Aunt Petunia’s Simnel Cake recipe, which is fitting for the time of year, and he finds himself humming a hymn they used to make him sing in assemblies in primary school. Harry never knows when his subconscious will bring Harry’s early childhood to the surface, but clearly today will be one of those days.
In this moment, I hate him for how understanding he is, and I hate myself for the fact that I know I will say yes, even though I also know that there is no way this could work. I smile at him and nod nonetheless, before shifting closer to him and tangling our legs together. My bare legs rub against the soft, worn fabric of his pyjama bottoms and I am forcefully reminded of the fact that I am only in my underwear. Potter smiles back, before bringing a hand up to cradle my face, and pressing a chaste kiss to my lips. He kisses me two, three, four more times, his hand moving down to my hip. All the kisses are close-mouthed and sweet, and they are absolutely perfect. He then kisses my nose, my forehead, my cheek, before whispering to me to turn around, and then he pulls me close, cradling my body in his, the soft t-shirt pressing against my back as his strong arm wraps around my middle and holds me securely.
Draco froze. He had to be imagining things. Potter would never say the very words Draco so wished he would. His addled mind was only able to produce a feeble “what?”
“That sounds great! What day, because Draco’s busy Thursday.” Harry responds and I see Peterson take the opening, not knowing what’s coming.
“I love that woman” Sirius said, taking the tin from Ron and accepting a kiss on the cheek from him too. Draco marvelled at the easy affection between everyone around him, except him, of course. He knew such easy love had to be earned, but he felt a bit miffed and more a little lonely to see it blatantly in front of him all the same.
And here I am, with his arm around my waist, under my robes, which caused quite a scandal the first time he did it, but now is taken as par the course of our relationship. And, you know, the wine is okay, the food is passable and it’s not the worst way to spend an evening, if it weren’t for the people.
I rejected him, I said that I didn’t like him, and now I’m crying like a child because he slept with someone. It’s not fair, he’s right. Fuck he’s just so right. I’m still looking right at him, but my eyes are unfocussed now.
“you won’t like what I’m about to say, Potter, but as this is for your benefit, I suppose I should say it anyway” I venture, before closing my book and leaning forward, directing my gaze at him now.
“please, call me Harry, both of you.” Said Harry as he took his place, settling Teddy into his lap. “yea Draco, I made it. I started baking after the war because I found it relaxing, and now it’s what I spend most of my time doing.” He explained.
“When we re-did the house Hermione helped me install hidden speakers so I could play muggle music. I barely use them now, but I’m a big fan of muggle music.”
Harry greatly enjoyed the hilarity of explaining to three uppity purebloods that they were expected to spear marshmallows on sticks taken from the forest to their right, burn said marshmallows in open, sooty flame, and then eat them. He also enjoyed how Malfoy was so dainty, as disgust with the cooking method warred with the joy of eating singed marshmallows warred openly across Malfoy’s face.
‘hurt’, thought Draco bitterly, was an understatement, seeing the state of the two boys upon his arrival.
“Luna, darling. Come to the ball with me? Ah, great, I’ll see you then. Tell me what colour suit to wear.”
Blaise apparently had a crush on me at the time, even though neither I nor Draco knew about it, and despite knowing the whole endeavour was fake, Blaise was convinced that me and Draco were sleeping together anyway, and it inspired this… insidious resentment of Draco.
“therapy” Harry replied, laughing. That shocked Draco. Boys didn’t usually speak so openly and comfortably about such things.
Hermione looked taken aback for just a second, before taking a deep breath and walking out the room.
Draco was surprised at how perceptive Harry was. He supposed Harry was right; he had spent a lot of time agonising over whether Harry would like him less, or not at all, because of it.
“Do you want to do something tomorrow? We can talk properly in person, I can help you plan how to tell your mother, or we can do something to take your mind off it.” Harry said.
“he’s a grass snake, harmless and sweet. His names Talgarth, and we’re best friends now” said Harry, aware that he sounded childish, but loving that he had found a pet to fill the void left by Hedgewig without having to make a conscious choice about it, and Hedgewig had indeed been his best friend over those long and lonely summers.
Harry had run back out before Draco had time to sit up in bed, and Draco heard the distant sound of the floo alongside distressed baby cries as he threw some clothes on and ran down after Harry.
Theo had a steady girlfriend of Daphne Greengrass, a girl whose father was some horribly rich, horribly prejudiced tory MP that Draco and his friends hated but who their parents loved. Daphne was nice enough, though. Theo doted on her, and they made each other happy.
When he awoke, sharp pain spearing through his head, he saw Hermione and Luna curled up on Harry’s bed, and he felt that familiar ache as the realisation dawned that he was safe enough to be present as the two women sought comfort in each other. All pain was forgotten as he gazed at the image before him, once again hit with the knowledge that this was what friendship felt like, and it felt so good he could hardly resent the fact that he had waited 18 years to find it.
A notable absence at the table, however, was Harry. It made sense that after the last time he would not want to be reminded of the pain, but Draco also thought that if he had lost his parents but still had a grandma, he would want to be as close to her as possible.
“Knowing you, Ron, there’ll be no woo-ing involved” Harry laughed. “But fine, Luna it is. You have to deal with Ginny’s wrath when she finds out she’s not invited though”
“I got something special for Draco too, if he lets me put it on him” she said, with a mischievous look on her face as she looked through all her bags before uttering a triumphant “aha!” and pulling something out. It was another silk shirt, this one a pale pink, bordered with green and decorated with small birds and banners. Harry loved it, and said as much.
“You look devastating,” Draco mumbles against his skin, looking at him with that same dare in his hooded eyes. He looks like he’s goading Harry into trying to laugh it off, like he knows that the effect he has makes that impossible.
The leaves rushed in lazy whirls around his feet and he knew in the darkest places of his heart that if real Draco didn’t want him he couldn’t keep going into the forest and kissing him. He wouldn’t have wanted that, Harry knowing all the secret pieces of himself, Harry figuring him out, Harry with his hands on Draco’s body. Harry realized with a sick twisting in his stomach that if he was pretending to care about any version of Draco, then he’d have to stop.
The first letter he opens is from Hermione, it reads: HARRY! Your case— Draco is on it, isn’t he? Let me know if there is Anything I can do to help! Hugs, Hermione
“No doubt,” Harry says, plonking himself into his desk and shuffling through his notes to the part where they asked, rather at length, about Draco Malfoy. “No memory of that delivery at all.”
Harry stays, and Draco reaches up to cup Harry’s face, running his thumb over his stubble, examining him with such uncompromising affection that he can hardly remember how to breathe. Harry holds his gaze and presses his cheek against Draco’s hand, watching his expression melt into something even worse, like he’s going to eat Harry alive. This is exactly what Harry wants, he realizes, as Draco kisses him soundly, his other hand finding its way under Harry’s shirt and resting on the vulnerable skin of his stomach, pressing him backwards a few stumbling steps until his back collides with the brick.
Their first dance lesson fell on a Monday night, which was normally Quidditch practice, meaning that Harry was two separate kinds of keyed up and annoyed.
“You could really treat me like an acquaintance?” Draco asked flatly, glowering at Harry with the darkest stare he could. “You’re literally responsible for half of the scars I have. You saved my life and my mother saved yours. We’re not acquaintances.” He spit the last word out like it was something foul, challenging Harry to reply.
The peach dripped down the sides of his mouth and made his chin sticky. He wished for rain and then felt it soft on the top of his head. It began to pour, warm rain and warm breezes and he hung his trousers and cloak on the branches of a tree, letting the water soak him to the skin.
“Lovely to see you Harry,” she says, greeting him with a kiss on the cheek and a hug. She smells like herbs and warmth and she has a smattering of freckles on the bridge of her nose from her trip. “What’s happened?”
Draco laughs softly and Harry grins into his shoulder. “It’s going to be okay,” he mumbles into the fabric of Draco’s sweater and is answered with a kiss pressed to the skin just below his ear.
Draco picks a pen out of the cup and drops it back in. “She wrote me a thankyou a few years ago. It meant a lot to me. I still have it.” He sighs deep. “It’s a reminder that I’m not a bad person.”
“Oh Merlin,” is the first thing he says, snapping his eyes back shut like if he blinks, the situation will change. “Merlin, bugger, shite.”
Harry couldn’t quite map the changes in him, both his strange lack of hostility sometimes and his overt ignoring of Harry, to the way he’d yelled at him last time Harry crept up on him alone. Harry wondered if maybe it would be different now, if he could sit next to Draco and probably try to talk to him, try to draw him out. Maybe it was a selfish desire, like if he could make Draco like him in real life it wouldn’t be so awful to kiss him in the forest, wouldn’t be such a breach of trust.
I guess this is goodbye. I feel sick. I feel sad. I want to do a million stupid things. I don’t know what to do with these letters. I tried to dispose of them but it feels wrong now. Maybe I’ll just send them to you, it won’t matter how I felt once I’m dead. Maybe I’ll just leave them in the desk drawer and hope they die with me.
“Fire burns hotter than blood,” Draco replied, setting his coat on the back of the chair like he lived there, like he was any of them, his glamour dissolving into his face, his hands remaining his hands. He seemed to need to hear it as much as Harry did.
Real Draco must kiss like this, he thought, everything sliding together and then out again. He couldn’t have known, was only taking shots in the dark, but it felt like a truth when it came to him.
He feels Draco in his head but there’s no tunnel, only molasses, soupy and thick thoughts for a moment before the surprise registers and Draco shears through his mind again, latching onto a memory of them at school, Harry copying Hermione’s answers by the fire of the Gryffindor common room.
“It’ll be December soon,” Hermione adds cheerily, rummaging through the bag and pulling out a glittery snow globe. It had been a surprise the first year she came traipsing into his house with a bag of tinsel and garland, but Harry’s come to accept it. Hermione knows he wouldn’t bother doing it himself and she knows how strange the holidays are for him, in that they remind him both of family he has and family he’s lost.
Draco had only been dragging Harry behind him for about a minute when Harry saw the familiar outline of the castle through the gaps in the trees. “Are you sure you can..?”
“She thinks you’re a good influence on me,” Draco says, sliding primly onto a duct taped stool. “Not sure where she got that idea.”
“But what about right now? This second, what’s stopping you?” Harry said, watching Draco shiver as each of the words hit his back. He looked as if he might be unspooling somehow.
“Dara,” he says finally. “I’m begging. I would rather rot in here for the literal rest of my life than listen to you continue to kick that wall.”
“Oh, well, that’s good,” Harry manages, as they separate and follow Ron inside. Harry feels he’s not quite doing his best at pretending he’s not half hard and fairly flustered, but in his defense, this isn’t the kind of thing that normally happens to him.
The snake in the middle crept slowly forward, and Draco knew that it was going to, even before it did. He could feel its intentions before he saw them and didn’t feel quite as afraid. There was a lesson there, about confronting fears, about how the things Draco was afraid of were snakes and were also more than snakes.
Maybe it wasn’t like that in real life, Draco reasoned as he took a seat, pouring himself a cup of coffee and spooning in a generous helping of sugar. Glancing over at Harry again, he felt unpleasantly certain that it was.
“Nothing in that house reminded me of her anymore,” Draco said, like Harry needed to be convinced of something. Harry thought of his own mother, who was too dead to be anything but beyond reproach, who he only ever had eyes to remember by. Draco had his mother’s eyes too, but there were so many other things, before.
“In real life you hate me,” Harry said, wishing that all of his arguments didn’t seem quite so weak in the dark. “It’s not okay for me to be doing all this with you, even if-” He stopped, tried to collect himself. “It’s not fair for me to come here and kiss you if the real you doesn’t want to kiss me. It’s not fair to me or you.”
I feel like I’ve been getting maudlin lately. I can’t help it, I’m going to die. I think if I were to have one excuse for dramatics this would really be it. I want to tell you things. I want to write my whole life story for you and make you tell me that I’m not a bad person. Which is absurd, both because you would never say that to me, and because I have been a very bad person. Maybe you would tell me I’m one of the good guys, and we’d both know you were lying to make me feel better.
A memory of the cellars in Malfoy Manor drifted back to him, stark in all their dark and dripping glory, hanging thick with spiderwebs so thick and established that even his mother’s crisp spellwork was barely able to clean them out.
They’re being too careful with each other, and though Harry thinks it enough times, Draco never comments on it, because then they might have to face the consequences. Harry still hasn’t asked Draco if he should take a turn casting and he almost doesn’t want to. He doesn’t know what he’ll do when he has to look Draco in the face and know all his secrets. He wants them, wants them desperately, but he doesn’t want the reality of them.
She saw Draco shift but she didn’t understand what was happening until she felt Draco’s free hand on her chin, tilting her head up until their lips met.
Harry sat at the Gryffindor table in an early morning stupor the first week of school. Beside him, Hermione was chattering to Ron and Neville about something he’d long lost the thread of, but that seemed to be of pressing importance to her. Harry had a headache. Harry was very, incredibly tired.
Hermione has met him in the tiny window of time her absolutely bonkers schedule allows, and is pounding coffee at an alarming rate. She’s listening to him describe his meeting with Jasmine, giving him what has all the power of her undivided attention, though she’s intercepted not one, but two urgent looking owls in the meantime. There’s some idiotic magical creatures legislation they’re trying to push through that’s making her want to pull out her hair, and each time he sees her, she seems at least 4% more stressed.
“So you won’t?” Ernie pressed, pushing his hair out of his eyes. He had a pinched kind of look on his already pinched face, and Harry fought down the stab of pity that wanted her to say yes. Anthony did not deserve to be stuck with Draco just because Ernie was struggling, and she wasn’t sure that Ernie would use mouthwash for her.
“It’s just you, maybe,” Harry says, then cringes. “I don’t know, it feels better if it’s just you. I don’t know.”
“He really is dreadful,” Anthony said, glancing over to where Ernie was attempting to lead Draco around the dancefloor. No fighting had broken out and Draco seemed to be following, but even as they watched she paused to hiss something at Ernie when he tread on one of her toes.
“Hard to tell.” He watched her, setting his homework down with a sigh and patting the couch next to him. He remembered sixth year when she barely left his bed because both of them were too afraid to face anything, because they felt safer when they weren’t alone. They never talked about anything that was happening because he knew they felt differently, but the closeness always helped.
“You tell me, it was just a guess,” Harry says, setting his wand in the chair next to him and waiting for Draco to cast.
“Malfoy if you say threesome again I’m going to hit you with a pillow,” Ginny says, and Draco mouths ‘hot’ at her, which takes her so by surprise that she dissolves into laughter. It is rather enjoyable that all the Gryffindors think he’s such an uptight cunt that anything fun he does automatically amuses them. It’s been bringing out the best and worst in him. “Okay, alright. Harry’s a huge slag. Has anyone else here kissed Harry?”
Jay nods enthusiastically. “Did you watch the Premier League this year? Chelsea held their own which was fucking nice.”
His own body bore its own scars from the war and it was a warped kind of comfort to see them reflected back on another boy.
“Next time I shove my tongue down your throat, just remember that it’s pretty much the equivalent of a punch in the face,” Draco says, a wicked grin on his face.
Draco was a good dancer, which wasn’t surprising considering the fuss she’d kicked up. She had a subtle grace that Harry had never been able to master, and a strength to her movements that should have looked far more ridiculous than it did.
Draco nods, not even bothering to wrinkle his nose at the mention of Mrs. Weasley. “You were raised by your Aunt and Uncle though, that must have helped.” He asks, still doodling, still refusing to meet Harry’s eyes.
“I don’t think Draco was trying to be nasty,” Anthony said kindly, glancing over at Draco, who had begun to dance with a very stilted Ernie.
“Potter, Merlin almighty, what is this? Are you scared he doesn’t like you back? Are you scared of what people are going to think?” she asks, staring at him curiously. Harry hates the way she looks like she’s seeing a new side of him for the first time, and wishes he knew how to cover it up.
Draco held very still, watching the snake with wide eyes as nausea slid up the back of his throat. “Hello,” he said quietly, hoping this was another one of the forest’s plans, that she was still protecting him.
“Sure you don’t,” Hermione said, though by this time they’d made it all the way to where Ron and a few other people were playing Quidditch and she was saved. “No one break anything, I don’t even think Madame Pomfrey can mend your bones before the Slytherin-Ravenclaw match tonight.”
“Absolutely ridiculous,” Draco said firmly, feeling sharp relief when Harry gave him the beginnings of a smile.
She scampered across the rug and dumped herself next to him, cuddling against his chest with a happy little noise. “It’s all okay now,” she said absently, as they both returned to their books.
“I don’t really want to play games right now,” Draco said tiredly, turning around with a flip of his cape. He was in his neatly pressed school uniform, the pajamas he sometimes wore conspicuously absent.
“My hero,” Draco said, the comment dripping with such disparagement that Harry was reluctantly impressed. “Your grip is tentative.”
“I get that,” Harry says, because he remembers the first time he visited, when the shop felt like a place no one could touch him. “Is it hard to explain to people?”
“I don’t know,” Harry begins, knowing the words aren’t good enough even as they come out. He feels that same niggling terror he felt when trying to talk to Cho for the first time and thinks maybe he should just stay out of relationships if expressing his feelings always makes him want to gouge his eyes out. He takes a deep breath, trying to do better so Draco doesn’t curse him, or worse, leave. “Well like, no, I do know, at least, a little.” He rubs the heels of his hands into his eyes until spots of color grow in the darkness, trying to find the right words for once. His mouth goes dry when he meets Draco’s eyes so he talks at the blanket, words slipping like wet leaves from his mouth. “You make me feel safe and I feel like you understand me and like I understand you, more than other people do. I feel deeply connected to you and I don’t know if that’s a romantic connection or if it just means that we’re like, meant to be close somehow, but I like being with you. So much. I meant what I said, I do have a crush on you. It’s dumb, but I do.”
Draco nods, scanning further into the article. “We are, fortunately, and somewhat shockingly, not particularly related.”
Harry laughs despite himself, grinning as two security guards follow them onto the landing and Draco dispatches them with well-aimed stunning spells. They hit the ground with two satisfying thumps and Harry thinks perhaps he shouldn’t be enjoying this quite so much. The alarm continues as they race down flight after flight of stairs, passing a few Ministry employees who don’t seem to have any idea that their escape is the reason for the lockdown.
Draco grimaces, but seems to realize he’s in no position to argue. “Just this once, assault to my dignity though it is.”
On the topic of someone else’s disaster of a life, you really must stop allowing yourself to get plastered all over the front of the Prophet. While plastered. Ha. You need a publicist. Maybe a therapist. I hope to Merlin you have a therapist, I can’t imagine that PTSD is pretty.
Jay starts, straightening back up. “Oh! Sorry mate, I thought that maybe-” he makes a vague hand gesture that goes from Draco, then to Harry, and then back to Draco again. “Draco didn’t say- but! Nevermind!”
As he pushes out the door, he finally manages to identify the feeling that’s been pushing around in his gut since he got here.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, closed it, and then opened it again, trying to find some point of mooring to anchor himself to. Pansy had turned to look at him, eager for his input, but he couldn’t seem to form words.
“Yes,” Draco replies, moving so his feet are underneath him and he’s curled against the side of the couch.
Harry feels it the second time, hones in on it, feels Draco prod into his memories. Harry tries to find that shoving sensation back, tries to squeeze him out of his brain just like he always failed to do in his Occlumency lessons.
“I think I made it very clear that I, in fact, don’t want to,” Draco says. He is not in control of this situation. It’s possible that he has at no point been in control of this situation.
Draco was looking at him, focused like he was trying to untangle a knot. He dropped his hand from the tree bark and pressed his fingers against Harry’s forearm, firmly like he was hoping to find a pulse.
“Je serais content de le faire,” Draco replies, and Harry can’t understand a word they’re saying, but they’re both looking so pleased that Harry can’t really bring himself to feel left out.
“Creative: Ravenclaw,” Goldstein replied with a smile. “Plus, I wouldn’t actually push you down a flight of stairs so I think it stays in Ravenclaw territory.”
“I do know how you feel about research,” Harry says. “I just wish some of it was panning out. We have a lot riding on this potion test and I’m worried that if the results aren’t conclusive we’ll be back at square one.”
When he returns to his flat, the tiny one near the place wizarding London meets muggle London, he places his new radio on the table next to the old one, muggle news rumbling from the tinny speakers until he falls asleep in his armchair.
“I can’t think of any other way to talk to you,” Draco said finally. “How are you supposed to talk to people who aren’t friends or enemies?”
“Yeah,” Potter replies, close, close. Draco counts backwards from ten twice and tries to breathe. “I’m usually on a train. Sometimes the train will pass train stations filled with ghosts and I won’t be able to get off to see them. Sometimes there will be something on the train with me and I won’t know what it is or what car it’s in but I won’t be able to get away from it. I always wake up before it finds me, but barely.” Potter holds his gaze for all of it and that’s the worst part, really. Draco didn’t ask what he had nightmares about. Maybe he didn’t even care, how obtuse of Potter to assume that he did. “You do too?”
“Do they sing constantly?” Ron asked uncertainly, after sticking her tongue out at Harry “I’m not sure the girl’s dorms need more noise.”
He wondered if she knew how alive the forest was. He had a feeling that she might know much more than he did, but was afraid that the game would be up if he asked her. It was an odd sort of secret, because it wasn’t bad, not really, but he had a strong conviction that telling other people would spoil it somehow. He couldn’t tell if it was the Draco bit or the fact that the forest seemed to be recalibrating him at a primal level, but the fact remained.
“I mean, I agree, it was child endangerment,” Hermione says, waving her hand about and taking a generous swig from her cup. “But in their favor, they did kind of try to stop us. I remember Remus in particular saying ‘No, certainly not, you are children,’ which, granted, was pretty rich coming from someone whose entire friend group turned into animals at night and then mounted an underground resistance at 18.”
Harry smiles, wishing he could hold Draco tighter even as he tugs them together, their breathing loud in the quiet room. “Me too.”
The band, which had stopped playing as everyone got into position started back up again in a simple waltz. Draco gave her hand a return squeeze, beginning the dance with a careful grace that Harry still admired.
“But you, don’t you hate me?” Harry asked, his voice sounding stupid and alien even to his own ears.
“I’ll get you whatever you want, within reason, if you make my job as easy as possible,” Harry says, holding the door so Draco can slink in. He’s supposed to assign a Healer to assist any recently transformed werewolf in case of retransformation or unexpected injury, but knows that suggesting this to Draco would be a death wish.
After the speech, dinner passed in a blur of delicious food and wine, Ron regaling them with stories of the Weasley family’s misadventures and Luna describing the fantastic creatures they’d found on their fall break trip to the moors.
Draco looks insubordinate but doesn’t reply, taking another long sip of tea. Harry wishes he’d made coffee, or at least brought along something to do with his hands.
Dara looks thoughtful. “All that time you spent with your damoiseau still hasn’t given you any strong leads?”
Pansy is not doing her best job of looking uninterested. Draco suspects he isn’t either, but no one is really paying him any attention. “Hermione, please don’t tease me.”
Draco is becoming quickly aware of the fact that his strategy of mainlining mixed drinks and listening to other people’s conversations, while his favorite party activity, is perhaps not as clandestine as he’d previously assumed. “She did say you first. Only under duress did she say Harry.”
“Is he sleeping?” Draco asked the snake, who was circling them with slow precision. Draco felt a strong wave of protection, a sense of intense safety in the clearing that overwhelmed even his thrumming alarm at the snake.
“Everyone looks so nice,” Harry murmured as the minutes ticked on. “And happy, everyone looks so happy.”
“You don’t want to know,” Harry said, guilty even though nothing good would come of telling anyone of what he was up to. Even if he really was hooking up with Draco, it would be a disaster. Since it was just him out in the forest, it was even worse.
“You said you had something you wanted to tell us?” Pansy asks diplomatically, tapping her holiday green and red acrylics on the table. She looks just as put together and foreboding as she had back in the shop, her dark red lip stain closely resembling blood. He hopes it wasn’t anyone he knew.
“Do you need something or are you just going to stand there gaping?” Draco asks, dabbing at his lips with a tissue and touching it up with the color. There’s a petulant tilt to his voice but none of the explosive anger Harry was bracing for. He’s still having flashbacks from the last time he walked in on Draco leaning against a sink, some part of him still squeezing squeamish and petrified.
“Oh,” Harry replies, feeling a bit foolish. He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised that Draco managed to make friends, he’d always had luck with it in the past, and yet it’s still somehow surprising. Harry always had the paranoid suspicion that Draco had bought all of his companions.
“Thank you,” Dara says. “Can you tell us if you’ve seen anyone out of the ordinary visit Rob’s house in the last month or two? Anyone who doesn’t normally pay him a visit.”
Draco is nodding, a hard, thoughtful look in his eyes. Harry can see him turning the problem over in his head, nodding slowly as he begins to unravel it. “I can do that,” he says slowly. “It shouldn’t take too long, provided my hunch is correct.”
“So I think to myself, who has keys to all of our offices and would want to tamper with Harry and Dara’s werewolf case and I think, oh, of course, that little slug Millence Filbin.”
“Your flat’s nice,” Draco says when they get in, Harry turning on the kitchen light and clicking the kettle on. Harry shrugs, getting a mug down for himself as Draco hoists himself on the counter, crossing his legs primly in front of him. “Aren’t you going to make a cup for me?”
Draco reaches over to squeeze Harry’s hand, and he registers that they’re both equally nervous, which is the farthest thing from comforting.
Harry’s feet squished in the mud and he worried briefly that he’d get stuck in the mire, only the steady slosh of the mangrove roots as he passed giving him any kind of reassurance. He stopped to take off his shirt and trousers, laying them across a low hanging branch, resigning himself to wading in just his pants. While he knew his way around a drying charm, he didn’t fancy the feeling of wet pajamas on his skin.
“Classic Luna,” Harry agreed, about to contribute another Luna anecdote when she heard the telltale siren of Draco getting in trouble.
Draco’s eyes went wide when she spotted Harry, something like panic in them when she doubtlessly realized the same things that Harry just had.
“Are you on break?” Harry asks, peering into the lit up shop, the light from the window bleeding onto the dark sidewalk. It’s barely past four, but it gets dark so early that it feels like evening already.
Draco has always considered himself to be the kind of person who needs to be taken out to dinner and seduced. Turns out, as Harry presses his cock against Draco’s thigh, he’s apparently completely happy to be ravished against a random wall.
“Garbage,” she sneered, whenever she caught them with it open at the breakfast table, which was most days.
“Of course, dear,” she smiles, her eyes crinkling up at the sides like Draco’s do when he’s laughing. He has his mother’s eyes too, it’s a little unnerving. “I did wonder when you were younger, you were so flamboyant and you talked about the poor boy incessantly.”
“I think it’s supposed to be the four houses,” Ron said as they headed down the stairs, squinting up at the enormous installation. “Like, it’s all four colors?”
58. When Ginny had been in danger and Harry had loved her, he’d sent her away. Draco would never have allowed it. Harry doesn’t know if this makes him feel better or worse.
“Do you think the Slytherins know that their interactions sound like a strange, unsuccessful soap opera?” Harry asks, remembering quite vividly the trashy television Aunt Petunia would watch when the Dursley men weren’t home.
Harry fusses with the lace of his shoe, the ends frayed and dirty from too many missions spent running around. Harry runs their conversations over and over in his head: Draco’s expression in the diner when he’d explained to Harry that no one knew he was a werewolf, how vulnerable he’d had to be, even though he was pretending to be flippant. He thinks that the reason that he trusts Draco is because Draco had trusted him when Harry had given him no good reason to. He remembers the look on Draco’s face after Harry had let his temper get away from him, something approaching fondness.
Belinda cuts him off, setting the tv down at the table and waving her hands at him. “It’s not my business, just don’t get so distracted you forget what you’re supposed to be fixing.”
Draco can feel himself getting pinker and pinker and senses that there is no end in sight for his embarrassment. The most evil, scheming and devious part of his brain is hoping that there’s a way he can swing this situation so he can kiss Harry while pretending that he has no interest in kissing him. The rest of his brain is very concerned that there’s no way he’s going to be able to kiss Harry without significant personal embarrassment and is more concerned still about the fact that he may be willing to risk the majority of his dignity for one measly kiss. “Well I don’t know,” he says. “I just think as a tremendously beautiful and interesting person, it’s always shocking when I haven’t kissed someone.”
“I know what eyeshadow is,” Harry says grumpily, and Draco makes a noise that sounds like a laugh trying to disguise itself as a cough. Harry wants to chase the sound, make it unveil itself. Draco’s fingers feel strange against his eyelids and he tries to open his eyes only to have Draco clear his throat very importantly. “Sorry.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says. “When I said it- I don’t know, I did I guess.” He can barely speak by the end, too nervous and tongue tied. Calling it a crush makes all of the feelings he didn’t know how to label make sense, they’re an explanation he knows everyone will believe, and they open up a whole new vat of problems he can’t begin to handle.
“Don’t get all sappy,” Draco mumbles without thinking, ashing the cigarette on the porch. “We do enough of that, don’t you think?”
“McGovern is her married name, or I would have noticed it earlier. While searching for information about her I found her marriage announcement. Her full name is Opal McGovern née Mulciber. Half of her family were Death Eaters and her sister, Aileen Mulciber, was turned during the war by Greyback. If you remember, he wanted to turn as many people as he could in order to complete a takeover.” Draco’s expression twists with disgust. “Aileen is in Azkaban for life, but it would be a motive.”
“Welcome to the Gryffindor table,” Harry whispered as McGonagall waited for quiet, and Anthony rolled his eyes as he spread his napkin in his lap.
“You’re so brave,” Draco says, and Harry knows that all of his fears are unfounded. It’s so easy for him to forget that Draco seems to genuinely likes him, that it’s not about anything other than that. “You make it sound so easy.”
“We’ll have a Gryffindor-wide vote on it of course,” Ron said, gesturing at the rest of the table, a few of whom had stopped to listen.
Harry banished the scraps to the fire with a shiver, hoping the words wouldn’t stick even as he felt them whirl slowly around his head. He felt, as he had many times that week, a sensation he wasn’t familiar with and had yet to place. It was something bright and almost sharp, like the ghost of an old painful memory, like a string snapping and bouncing back to sting his fingers.
Draco is showing Harry how to change a belt in a record player, and they both know that Belinda knows something is up, but she hasn’t said anything and neither have they.
Ginny said to him one night that she didn’t know who Hermione thought she was kidding and that was when Harry realized who shot all of those holes into the tin cans out by his garden.
“Quite,” Draco agrees, bopping his head to the music. “Hogwarts was a home to me, especially when things were less than ideal at the manor. If I had gone back I might not have... you know.”
“Of course,” Draco says, lingering next to the fireplace. Harry realizes that Draco isn’t sure where he should sit, and is going to hover there until Harry properly invites him in. It’s somewhat of a relief, really, that Draco is just as much of an idiot as he is. This has been a surprise, but one of those that feels like he should have known it much sooner, really.
“I’m trying,” Harry says, dropping his head and staring at the pattern on the rug. “I haven’t seen those memories in years.”
“When was the last time you did your dishes?” Hermione asks, tapping her foot on the tile as she appraises the pile of plates near the sink.
Maybe Draco genuinely wanted nothing to do with him. Maybe Draco didn’t carry the spark of their fights and history in the corner of his heart like Harry always had. Maybe Draco didn’t want Harry in his life and they would be better off ignoring each other. It seemed incomplete, like after everything, all the real things and everything in the forest that had only been Harry’s, they should have deserved more.
“Nope, not a chance,” Harry said. “This will be so much less of a trainwreck. And besides, if either of us are seduced by beautiful witches at some point during the evening there will be no hard feelings.”
The words bubbled up at his lips. It’s a coping strategy, it keeps people from getting too close. If I’m mean I can protect myself, it’s always been like that. I don’t want to be, but I don’t know what else to do. Especially not with you. I’ve tried to tell you that.
“Muggles like the idea of magic,” Harry said with a shrug, his own peach dripping juice down his forearms and mixing with the pouring rain. “Not that you know anything about how they live.”
They follow Ron into the kitchen, Harry half-wishing he’d been quicker on advocating for the shower, as the sweat and dust has dried against his skin in an uncomfortable way. Harry glances at Ron and Draco to find that of the three of them, he’s actually probably the least disheveled, which comes as a bit of a shock.
“If that’s alright,” Draco murmurs, still moving his hand in an excruciating rhythm. He has a sly little smile on his face that’s making Harry, if possible, more turned on. Harry had thought that having hooked up with Draco before, he’d had some idea of what he was in for, and thinks with delight that maybe he has no fucking idea.
“Do you think the snow will stick?” Draco asked, reaching over to take a tissue from Harry’s outstretched hands and dabbing at her eyes.
“You’d hate mornings no matter what I did,” Harry said, knocking Ron on the head with with his shoe as he went to put them on.
After a few more counts of silence, Draco seemed to realize she couldn’t win. “I’m going with Greg.”
“Stop it,” Draco says, sharp again. “It’s not just like, a pain spell. Don’t you know? Have you ever had it-”
,” Draco says, looking down at himself and seeming to register first that he’s naked and second that he’s wrapped in an orange sheet. Harry can’t recall ever seeing Draco in orange, an observation confirmed by the appalled look on Draco’s face. “And of course you’d be here!”
Harry had felt something creep in as the room grew quiet and he threw spell after spell as Draco deflected and dove and flickered away from him. Draco fought with finesse. He fought with the perfect form they all strove for and he knew spells that Harry had barely glanced at. He always had his nose tucked into the Ministry issue spellbooks, learning, absorbing.
Draco took a long inhale of the sweet flower smell, trying to figure out how this could have happened. He reached out for the forest, trying to find an explanation. Had Harry followed him into here too? Did he have to come and ruin everything?
“I could recognize you by yours,” Harry replies, stepping out from behind the counter before Draco can reply. He can play battle of wits with Draco, and he doesn’t have to think about how this time it’s so much lighter. “See you next time I break something.”
“Thanks for finding those clippings,” Harry says a little too loudly. The witch a table over glares at him over her enormous stacks of books and he brings his voice back down where it’s supposed to be. “I never make it over to the archives for cases, Hermione is always yelling at me about it. This could be really helpful information.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “What didn’t you sneak into, really. And it wasn’t cold if you knew how to use a warming charm or a blanket.”
“Being enemies?” Draco questioned, a squirming nervousness entering his chest. Wildly, he thought that having any connection to Harry was better than none, and then felt fiercely embarrassed for having thought that at all.
“You look really pretty with lipstick on,” Harry says lightly, running his hand over Draco’s back and the knobs of his spine.
“He just threw his cup?” they ask idly, and he appreciates that they don’t look at him like Hermione does, with searching eyes.
Ernie let out an entirely audible sigh of relief that was not echoed by any of the other involved parties.
Harry glances over at Dara at the exact moment that her eyes glaze over and she slumps back against the chair. Harry only has time to look at Connie, who is regarding him nervously.
She smiles over at him, and Harry is almost sure she’s testing him somehow. He doesn’t know what the test is and doesn’t know how to pass. “How have you been Harry? I heard about the unfortunate business with you leaving the aurors.”
“Quite an idea,” Draco replied snippily, running a hand through his disheveled hair. “I just want to sleep.”
Harry makes sure Draco can tell he’s rolling his eyes. “I’ll try not to ruin the shining image of me the Prophet has constructed.”
“Father taught me to dance,” she said. “When I was six, we used to dance in the drawing room. Not proper or anything, just me standing on his feet as mother played the piano. And then when I got older he taught me how to waltz, and he used to scold me when I let me elbow fall until I was perfect.”
15. Draco knew better than anyone who in the Ministry was a Death Eater, who thought the Death Eaters had been right in thought but wrong in action, and who would agree to anything if the money was good enough. Listening to him talk, Hermione scribbled a hole in her parchment with the nib of a quill, fury burning a harsh line across her forehead. When she looked at him afterwards, Harry noticed a softening in her expression, almost imperceptible. Draco helped her figure out who she needed to talk to, what she needed to say to push some of her reforms through, even small consolations, and she forgave him.
“That’ll be enough for now,” Draco said, and Harry felt the ‘for now’ ring deep in his bones but he kissed Draco so he wouldn’t have to think about it, kissed him so deep that he could pretend he was real, that he was the only thing that was.
“Have a biscuit,” she commands. He and Dara hesitate for a moment, but both reach for one as her glare intensifies.
“Why are you so different each night?” Harry asked after a long moment. “Sometimes you’re so cruel and then you just-” The sharp image of Draco’s hand slipping into his. “You aren’t.”
Harry stared defiantly back at him, narrowing his eyes like he was trying to prove something and Draco wondered what had gotten into him. He couldn’t quite manage the quiet morning stare they’d perfected for the first few weeks, but at least he had an excuse. Potter was just being weird, as usual.
“They’re your memories, if you aren’t responsible I’m not sure who is,” Harry says, growing tired of the way that Draco works so hard to hold himself at arm’s length. They’re partners, they can’t tip toe around each other forever.
“Part girl, part cat. She was horribly embarrassed about it, but it wasn’t all that bad,” Harry says, smiling at the way Delia hiccups a little when she laughs. There’s a noise from the doorway, and Harry glances over to find Draco watching them, eyes transfixed on Delia.
At the Gryffindor table, Harry was having no such luck. He was glad that it was scarf season, because he’d begged a chill and wore his scarf wrapped firmly around the bruised skin of his neck. He’d woken up in his own bed, realizing in horror both what he’d done and finding that the evidence hadn’t disappeared along with Draco.
“It’s really intuitive, it’s like a puzzle,” Draco begins, his fingers worrying the hem of his jumper. He has a lot of nervous ticks now: feeling the hems of his shirts, touching his hair, running his fingers over the Mark. It’s kind of sweet to watch, like he’s trying to comfort himself. ’“One of the girls I met doing community service had one, she taught me the basic stuff. That’s how I got the job here.”
“That’s not what I’m saying at all,” Harry sighs. He’s going to compliment Draco. He’s going to tell the truth and its going to be the nicest thing he’s ever said to him, but he doesn’t know any other way to do it. Not that Draco ever deserved kindness, but Harry’s not sure if there’s anyone who doesn’t deserve kindness. Sirius would probably tell him that plenty of people don’t, but he thinks that Remus would disagree. He doesn’t know which man is right. “You know your spells way better than I do and your form is perfect. It’s always perfect. Everything I do on instinct you do because you know exactly where every part of you needs to be. You pause and calculate and I rush in.”
“I can’t figure out if I should be asking you what the sexiest thing I do is or telling you to kiss me if you actually want to shut me up,” Harry says, taking Draco by the hand and pulling him through his bedroom and into the bathroom.
“Thank Merlin,” Harry said with a shiver, watching Draco fuss with the spiderweb but not reaching for it himself. “Big spiders in this forest.”
“It’s really weird to realize that your parents are just people,” Draco says, shifting to pull his hands into the sleeves of his jumper. “I don’t know what that was like for you, but it’s always been so odd to realize that they were just trying to do their best.”
He sighs and when he answers it’s the closest thing he’s come to the truth. “I don’t think I do either.”
“So are we doing this, then?” Draco asked, their noses brushing as Draco slid an arm around Harry’s waist.
“I know,” Draco said, and Harry thought she might have gotten a glimpse of something close to hurt. “He’s a really good friend.”
“I can’t!” Harry said, rushing slowly towards anger, to something like despair. This was supposed to be easy and it wasn’t supposed to hurt. “That’s the whole problem!”
“It is easy.” Harry brings his face down so their foreheads are pressed together so Draco has to meet his eyes. Because Draco likes him and he likes Draco back. “We don’t have to tell the press or anything. Just our friends.”
“You’re weirding me out,” Harry said cautiously, not entire sure how the forest would feel about that response to his apparition. Draco had asked him to, but it all felt wrong. “Is that rude enough for you?”
Draco brings his wand to Harry’s face and murmurs something under his breath that makes the cut knit, the skin stretching and tightening over the bloodied area. Harry remembers waking up next to him when he’d accidentally stayed over, how Draco had looked exhausted even while he slept, how in the morning he’d slunk out with barely a word. For all that Harry does to pretend that he hadn’t cared at all when they’d kissed those nights in the bathroom stall, it had been nice, nice enough that when everyone else found out he’d shoved it away and pretended it hadn’t been anything. He’s still terrified by how much wanting to punch Draco and wanting to kiss Draco feel the same in his stomach, how the feeling never went away.
“At least Blaise is gorgeous,” Ron said mournfully. “Nott’s face looks like a creative macaroni picture.”
“Pansy Parkinson,” Hermione replies, and Harry’s heart jumps up into his throat. “She says that you’ve been following Draco to where he works, at a muggle repair shop, and that yesterday, when you were supposed to be at the hospital, you two went somewhere together.” Hermione says accusingly, stopping to give him a piercing stare.
“Is there a chance whoever you’re hooking up with made them permanent?” Ron asked, the cotton ball stinging, especially as Ron pressed into the bruise with increased fervor.
Harry steals the doodle pad and makes little Gryffindor banners all over it as Draco rings the customer up in his cheerful work voice. Draco goes to put the radio in the back and scowls at Harry’s additions when he returns. “Terribly done, Harry. You’ve completely cocked up what was a lovely drawing.” Harry pretends not to notice the amusement in Draco’s eyes.
“I thought you hated my father,” Draco says with a hint of his old drawl. He feels distant and Harry thinks he might be trying to hide his hurt. He never knew how Draco’s relationship with his father really was, although he read articles in the aftermath of the war that alluded to abuse and cruelty. He thinks it might have just been complicated.
“You don’t have to defend him to me,” Hermione replies. “I just never thought I’d have to be the one reminding you that he’s not just anyone.”
Draco peers around to make sure Emma is distracted and then replies. “Muggle clothing is a gift. So comfortable. Fuck robes. Fuck those weird hats.”
“Oh!” Harry says, grinning at her. “You’re a good kisser too.” Draco feels something awful happening in his body, some unhinged combination of jealousy, arousal, and fondness that he would tamp down if he had any kind of control over it.
Harry debated not answering it at all, but thought that, beyond being rude, his silence would probably would say all it needed to. “Unfortunately, yes.”
“I do know,” Harry says, glancing up when the waiter brings the check and throwing a few coins on the table before Hermione can reach for her purse. “Here, I’ve got lunch, thanks for letting me talk through the case. I’ll see you for dinner later this week?”
“I hadn’t thought about it,” Draco says, all dead eyes and mocking tone. “But yeah, Potter, it was super.”
“What are you doing out here?” Harry asked, hoping for nonchalance. He didn’t even know what he planned on accomplishing, only that Malfoy had bags under his eyes again and he was all alone.
“Poor thing,” Hermione said sympathetically, smoothing out her paper and copying down the date at the top. “If I thought McGonagall would let Draco dance with Blaise I’d offer to switch.”
Longing wasn’t an emotion Draco had been familiar with until he’d met Harry, and  he’d felt it in the years since in all its sharp and striking forms. Desire wasn’t new, he’d been intimately familiar with wanting as a child, patterned soon after with getting. Longing was different, how it squeezed his chest like a boa constrictor and wouldn’t let him breathe when Harry and everything else he wanted stayed just out of his reach.
“Save your money and buy yourself a couple of double A batteries,” Malfoy says, running a hand through his messy blond hair. He’s stopped wearing it slicked back and Harry isn’t sure when that started but it looks good on him, like he’s not so tightly wound anymore.
When he finally returned to the dorms for the day, Ron was the only one laying on his bed, a Quidditch magazine hovering above his head. It dropped down onto his face when Harry came in, and he let it fall to the side as he turned to look at him. “Early night?”
“I’m very aware,” Draco said, and Harry thought it was a good sign that she was being snide again instead of letting her emotions wash across her face. Harry was always open but Draco was tightly wound and only let the truth seep out when there was nothing left to hold it in.
“Hopefully you can find enough of my body to send home to Molly,” Harry replied, beginning the slow trek back to the practice room.
“I won’t tell, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Harry assured her, offering another tissue, which Draco used to delicately blow her nose.
“Hi,” Harry says, sitting heavily in the chair across from him. The room walks the line between comfortable and industrial, the armchairs snug and dull gray and resting on an oddly patterned navy rug. There are a number of candles and no windows and Harry can already feel the way the room eludes time. He fixes his eyes on the clock above the door, reading 9:12 with mounting panic.
Harry nods, wraps his arms around Draco and lets himself be pulled along. The first time they side alonged is sharp in his mind, and he remembers how quickly they’d jumped apart after, still so afraid to touch each other.
“I’m fine,” Harry replies, picking up a biscuit and then setting it down again with a sigh. He knows he should tell her, that she’d probably have some brilliant advice for him. He’s just vaguely worried that her advice might involve being rational and leaving Malfoy alone. “You can’t tell Ron.”
Harry quite agrees. Time stretches on in the white cube, during which Dara concedes that Harry can do push ups if Dara is also doing push ups and they brain storm more futile strategies for trying to escape the boring prison flat of anguish. After another food delivery and a few more hours of fitful sleep, Dara is scratching the word ‘remember’ onto her inner thigh with her pointer finger, as she’s become convinced that whatever stupid shit is about to happen, it will probably end up with them being Obliviated. Harry is concerned she’s right, but since she’s more interested in scratching her future self a message via her skin, Harry is content to let her get on with it. She’s halfway through the first m when Harry hears a bang, then realizes that the fact that he can hear a bang means that something, somewhere is happening.
Draco is nervous, Harry realizes, which makes it that much harder to tamp down the shit-eating grin that’s threatening to creep across his face.
“I agree,” Goyle said. “Art is nice though. I really like the yarn thing, I think it’s really nice.”
“I thought we were showering,” Harry manages, as Draco sucks a bruise against Harry’s collarbone. Harry is already hard, in addition to being moderately sweaty and blood covered, and is not sure he’ll be able to successfully perform his role as ‘the person who actually gets them into the shower.’
“This is a fucking disaster,” Harry said instead of replying, leaning up against the sink with a grimace and squeezing his eyes shut. “Why isn’t the spell working?”
“Alright, hun,” Belinda says as he slinks back out, feeling found out and nervous about everything. He’s not entirely sure what he’s looking for but a run down repair shop is a better lead than he’s had in years.
“You can get yarn from alpacas and angora rabbits as well,” Hermione said, her needles stilling. Blaise was examining the stitching on the mitten he’d been given with interest, holding his mittened hand up to the light to get a better look.
“I will absolutely hold you to that, Ms. Granger,” Harry replied, throwing the blanket onto Ron and making her way up to the girl’s dormitory to get her bookbag.
Draco slips in on the edge of his brain, and before Harry can zero in and push him out, his memories shift and swirl like film reels. Harry can’t figure out how to latch onto Draco and block him out once he’s gone deeper. It’s definitely lack of skill but it might be curiosity, maybe masochism.
He meets Harry’s eyes in the glass for a beat, then looks looks back down at his own mouth to swipe the lipstick across his bottom lip. His hand is steady as he does it, as nonchalant as any of the girls Harry had watched in his teenage years brushing on powders and creams. Harry wonders in panicked staccato beat where he learned to do that and if anyone else knows he does it. The worst part is that it looks good on him, the color stark against his skin like holly berries or blood.
Draco wandered the woods until his feet began to ache and as soon as he thought the words, the forest spit him back out onto Hogwarts grounds, yawning and slumped as he trekked back to his dormitory and fell into a thick, dreamless sleep.
Even worse than the forest was the look in Draco’s eyes when he’d stormed off by the lake, because that hurt had been real for both of them. He wanted to make it better somehow, but since he had no idea how to talk to Draco even if he could get him alone, it was a moot point.
He hovered at the skin before opening his mouth and sucking, gently at first but then with a deliberate kind of insistence, like he was taking special care to mark him.
“I’m not sure,” Harry leans over, curling so he can rest his forearms on his thighs and twiddle his thumbs. “I’m just exhausted.”
Someone makes a choking noise. He has no idea who. He hopes very much that it’s not him. Harry is still bright red and staring, a curl falling very artfully into his eyes. Harry’s nose is a little crooked from a sub-standard Episkey. It’s entirely possible that Draco is the one who broke it, and it looks so rugged it should be illegal. Draco had known this, but up close it’s so much worse. Draco is so, so, so utterly fucked. This is the last thing he needs. Why is Harry so hot? What evil, vengeful god made Harry so hot?
“Not a bad idea, Anthony is cool,” Harry said. “He uses mouthwash and he won’t try to grope me, so definitely a strong possibility.”
“You look warm,” Draco had remarked at her entrance, and Harry looked down at the scarlet colored wool with a smile.
“Can it be? Is my horrible and disorderly partner about to do the paperwork that has gone so neglected since he got a new boyfriend?” she asks, perching on the edge of his desk and immediately knocking over his quill holder. She begins the task of setting it back to rights, sending a pile of papers onto the floor in the process.
Harry Potter is by the punch. A pie graph of the reasons Draco Malfoy doesn’t want to talk to Harry Potter looks like this:
“I was talking about Dumbledore, I didn’t really mean-” Harry replied quietly, his arm limp in Draco’s grip. It was the most violent way he’d ever held hands. “I’ve never tried. Thought about it though.”
“Delia,” the girl says, dissolving into giggles. She makes an effort to compose herself, wriggling up in her bed. “Your scar doesn’t hurt anymore, right?”
“That’s what I thought,” Pansy says. “So considering all of this ample evidence, how, exactly, would you have managed to kiss Harry?”
Draco felt unbearably small, felt himself shrinking until the snake was the only thing left, and had to swim back up to find his voice again. “Yes,” he choked out, barely daring to blink.
