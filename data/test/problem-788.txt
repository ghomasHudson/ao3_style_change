“What did he do?” Harry prompts Teddy. He looks exhausted, on more than one instance Draco caught him dozing at his seat while he was serving up dinner. However, as soon as Teddy joined them at the table it’s as if he found his second wind. He listens on in rapt attention, his deep laughter mixing with Teddy’s light giggles as he learns about the hijinks of a group of toddlers.
doze off. He was so used to the sight at this point—the towering trees, the still water of the lake and the slowly drifting fog moving towards the castle—that the slight movement was enough to catch his eye.
Draco grabs the card and stuffs it back in the envelope before it throwing it in a drawer.
“Who is Teddy with?”
Harry catches up to him, taking a minute to catch his breath. He looks flushed, no longer in the robes he was wearing. He’s wearing a blue tie with the knot off centre over a slightly wrinkled blue shirt tucked into smart, grey trousers.
With a wink aimed at Draco, Harry leans in and takes an exaggerated sniff, Scorpius’s soft hair tickling his nose. Scorpius is looking at him with his eyes wide, nervously waiting for the verdict.
Malfoy stops to take a deep breath, his fingers subconsciously clenching in the puppy's fur.
Though he took down the Stasis Charm—he needs more organic conditions to test viability—there’s still a shimmer of magic around the glass structure. It tickles his skin as he passes through, almost as a welcome. Milly and Zeb have instructions not to disturb him while he’s in here, but the fresh cup of tea every few hours shows they’re still checking on him.
“Then, why. . “ Harry trails off, trying to think of a reason why Scorpius won’t get a chance to attend Hogwarts.
“I can’t sleep there.”
“You know what, buddy,” Harry says cheerfully, kneeling so that Scorpius can keep petting the puppy. “This little guy and I can’t play by ourselves all day, I do need to get some work done. How about you help me out sometimes? Keep him company so that I can work?”
“Harry!”
He wasn’t naive enough to think that things would be easy now. Draco had long gotten over any misconceptions he might have had that life, at any point, became easy. There were still things they argued about; the only thing that changed was the way they resolved those arguments.
He whines as Draco’s movement moves his hair out of reach, drawing Harry’s attention to his action. Harry chuckles, gripping the tiny hand in his to bring it down.
will want to talk to you.”

For Day#19 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
Harry bites his lip and hugs him back tightly, fisting his hands in Draco’s sweater.
“Come on in, Potter and cut the act. It’s not like you’ve been very subtle with your peeking onto my property, which, by the way, is an offence.”
“No stinky?” Scorpius asks, his voice breaking the moment and making Harry step back.
When Scorpius Malfoy decided to take charge.
Commandeering spare baubles from the Great Hall, they had run to the room, a bottle of Butterbeer safely hidden in Draco’s robes. With Celestina Warbeck crooning a festive ballad in the background, they finished the bottle while absolutely covering the tree in glittering garlands and sparkling ornaments.
It was also clear that the daily exercise had lent definition to his form, making him appear broader and sturdier. Very different from the small, thin boy Draco had first met.
“Nope,” he confirms, “not stinky at all.”
Prompt for the week was "Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike."
Malfoy looks pointedly at the half-empty glass of Gin in front of him. Harry blinks at the glass, then blinks up at Malfoy. Shaking his own empty glass around, just about whacking Neville on the head with it, Harry tries again. "Why aren't you drinking? I mean finishing? "
“Thank you for getting it started,” he smiled, already folding his sleeves up. Draco leans back against the counter across from Harry, his arms folded and gaze narrowed as he waits for Harry to say something, any comment at all on the state of the kitchen.
Harry waits patiently as Draco sees them out, he’s sure his face is still red thanks to Mrs. Malfoy’s passing remark, “I can keep him tomorrow night too, Mr. Potter.” He politely declines Draco’s offer of tea, too nervous to actually drink anything. He’s not sure how Draco is going to react to the fact that Harry’s been out and about, looking for ways to help Scorpius.
Harry smiles. He adds, “And you.”
with todays picture I managed to keep it fluffy. #mysecrettalent
so positive reaction. This though, this clueless countenance was something he hadn’t planned for.
Or maybe  he will only wait for the storm to die as Malfoy will surely freeze out in the cold. He would be okay with waiting it out till Malfoy decides to come inside but he knows they lose points if only one team member gets back. So he wraps himself up in the afghan from the sofa and steps outside, grunting as the cold wind whips around him, making him shiver.
He ignores Draco’s smirk and settles in; Harry knows that neither of them are any good at denying their sons.
Feeling inordinately pleased with himself, Harry leans to his left, letting Neville take his weight as he watches Malfoy fiddle with his camera. His fingers are careful and confident in the way he handles the device, swiftly plucking the film from the end and storing it in his pocket. Harry frowns.
“Malfoy-”
“I think it sounds exciting,” Scorpius exclaims, looking up at Harry in awe. Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever run out of these moments, times when he looks at Albus and Scorpius and can’t believe how lucky he is.
He watches as Malfoy takes a deep breath, his smile dulling  a little as he steels himself to say something. “There’s something else you should know, Potter.”
is breaking and entering . . .”
“At school today, Bobby was telling Joey, Darren and I, that all of us our different because we can’t do magic like our parents, even though Mrs. Harris told us that we can’t talk about magic in school where the other kids can hear us. We told him not to but he didn’t listen.”
Draco smiles, falling asleep with the comforting weight of Harry’s arm around his abdomen.
As far as timing goes, it’s not the most perfect situation and really, fate does seem to be holding some sort of vendetta against him, but at least he will die knowing that he’s in love with someone.
Harry chuckles. “She knows how to keep a grudge, that’s for sure.”
He sat there, stunned, once he was done. The letter lay open in front of him as he went over the words again. His first instinct was to share the news with Harry.
Draco hums, making his way towards the door. He gestures for Harry to follow him, the boy still quiet in his arms. He wonders how long Harry has been around the boy to be so at ease carrying him around.
Draco looks nervous as he stands and smoothens the creases in his shirt.
“That’s amazing, Draco,” Harry says. He sounds genuinely happy when complimenting him. “It’s about time they understand your worth.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why?” Draco found himself asking before he could restrain himself.
Harry nods.
Draco vanishes the bottle with a wave of his hand and throws his arms up, arching his back and jumping with the music. He shakes his head to get his wet hair off his face, spraying the people around him with drops of vodka. He hasn’t felt this reckless in a while, so uninhibited and relaxed, like it’s okay to let go, and he suspects it’s only because of Harry that he’s feeling this way. Aware that Harry will still be watching him, Draco puts on a show; arching his back and unbuttoning the top two buttons on his shirt. The crowd is pressing in closer now, he can feel the push and pull from the other bodies around him but it’s like their energies are feeding him, making him pull his carefully tucked in shirt free from his trousers.
Harry feels no concern for tomorrow because he knows this night, this one chance was more than he could have asked for and more than he could have known that he needed.
“No Madam Pomfrey,” Potter repeated, almost leaning against Draco now, “‘m fine, I just need to sleep.”
"I am, free, yes," Harry says, maybe
It takes a few seconds but Teddy nods, satisfied. He reaches up his arms for a hug that Harry happily obliges for. He whispers something into Harry’s ear that makes Harry hug him tighter, lifting him off the ground for a few seconds till Teddy laughs.
Draco reached out to catch him as the other swayed again, arms straining to hold onto him as Potter started growing limp.
Harry hasn’t told anyone about his night terrors, not even Ron and Hermione but he hates letting Malfoy feel like he’s the only one who is still affected by the events that occurred in that room.
“He can stay here,” Draco suggests hesitantly, “if he’s okay with it, that is.”
For Day#3 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
Harry is smiling now, he pulls Draco’s chair closer till their legs are tangled and Harry can lean forward enough to place his forehead against Draco’s.
“Hi, how are-”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I’m not, but for the record, you
“Draco,” Harry breathes, walking around the counter. He carefully wraps an arm around his waist, letting him lean against him.
The sense of comfort he once felt around Harry is starkly absent. Draco isn’t sure if it’s because of the time apart or the way they parted, but it’s enough to throw him off a little. He feels unbalanced in a way he hasn’t in a while.
Draco glanced at him to find Harry staring at him. He flushed.
He’s entirely unprepared for the sight of the little boy sitting just inside the door, watching the scene outside with tears in his eyes.
“I found some of my old toys while cleaning up,” Draco hurries to catch up to Harry. “I was wondering if Teddy might like to have them.”
“Tough shit.”
He’s not ready for Draco to all but fling himself into Harry’s arms, hugging him tightly. Harry reacts on instinct, holding onto Draco gently, one hand rubbing Draco’s back soothingly. He can feel Draco’s shoulders shudder, hear his breath hitch, he can finally smell that maddeningly addictive scent again, something that’s purely Draco and has been on his mind for days.
“Harry?”
When Harry storms out of the house, Draco can’t even remember what it was that started the entire fight. All he knows is that he said things he shouldn’t have and Harry kept taking it till he couldn’t anymore, storming out after finally giving back as good as he got.
. It wasn’t fair of me to expect you to be my escape.”
Harry finally feels Draco relax against him, ready to enjoy their quiet Sunday when he realises . .
“Will you duel them?” Albus asks, waving his legs and kicking Draco in the shins.
“Go on,” Harry urges gently, tugging at the blankets till Malfoy is once again nestled next to him, the blankets tucked around them.
“When?”
So the only reason behind this new, unpredictable behaviour has to be Harry’s presence.
Then, a year after they first spent the night together, Draco storms into the pub. Harry’s been waiting for him, drink at the ready, knowing just how difficult the busy week has been for his boyfriend.
"Marry me, Harry Potter?"
Blaise raises his hand in surrender, “Not a word, I swear.” Pansy rolls her eyes at Draco and heads towards the bar, snagging a seat as soon as she gets there.
He was supposed to be there for Draco’s birthday.
Harry almost wishes there was nothing on the bed between them so he could drag Draco closer. He wants to press a kiss against the color blooming in Draco's cheeks, feel how warm they are against his lips. As it is though, he settles for reaching for Draco's hand.
“”S okay, you want something to eat?”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out, waving cheerfully as he jumps down his front steps. It had taken him some time to get the information he needs, he is just on his way when he spots Malfoy and son walking down the street. He waits till they’re about to cross his house before calling out.
They move together, lips brushing hesitantly at first before they gain confidence. Malfoy pulls back, leaning his forehead against Harry’s.
For Day 8 of the 25 days of Drarry 2020 Challenge!
Before he knew it the room became a secondary dorm room of sorts. He was finding himself spending more time here, getting comfortable on the window ledge, than in the actual room assigned to him. The only eighth-year Slytherin to come back, he had all the space to himself but being alone amongst the empty beds was slightly disconcerting. It was also the reason why he could never get comfortable enough to fall asleep.
Putting up an act is harder than it once was. I wonder if it’s because of
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“Teddy,” Draco calls, lifting the boy from his perch to help him climb onto a stool placed right in front of the window. The kitchen feels so open now, compared to how it was before, the new windows letting in more light and giving the otherwise dark room some life. “Do you think you can help me?”
They break apart in surprise to find most of their friends standing at the door to the pub. Hermione is rolling her eyes as Ron hands Seamus some money and Luna is smiling proudly at them.
It’s as he’s watching Draco cutting up the sandwiches for Scorpius that Harry finds himself asking, something he’s been wondering about for a while, “Do you work at the Ministry?”
“No, listen,” he urges, moving till he’s next to Malfoy on the sofa. Before he knows it he’s placed the cup from Malfoy’s hand on the side table so that they can hold hands. “It’s okay. Perfectly. There’s nothing to be embarrassed  about.”
“Right, Potter,” Malfoy says tiredly, striding into the room and all but collapsing on the arm chair across from him. “To what do I owe the pleasure? Other than the fact that that you realised you’re
“And if I can’t?”
“It has,” he nods. “Congratulations on your new role, I heard from Pansy that you’re leading the entire team now.”
“I’ll go see what the little monster is up to.”
Pansy drapes her coat over her arm and accepts hugs from the two of them before she leaves, manoeuvring through the crowd.
Malfoy looks apprehensive, a hint of uncertainty in his eyes as he waits for Harry to walk down to them. His son, meanwhile, smiles unreservedly at Harry, his little hand holding onto his father.
or because I have simply forgotten how.
Harry raises an eyebrow at Draco, takes in the vial in his hand and stares at him in surprise.
Harry laughs. “It’s too soon or I would definitely say something like,
Any time doubts of betraying his mother creep in, Ron just reminds himself that no matter how amazing the taste is, she’s just never managed to create those fantastic swirls and designs on top.
“Did you hear back from them, yet?” Harry asks, topping Draco’s glass of wine before pouring more for himself.
“They’ll never even find my body.”
For Day#24 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
Dinner, after, had been Harry’s favorite part of the evening. He was no nowhere near as tired as he should be, having spent most of the night laying awake in bed thanks to his building anticipation.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
As luck would have it, not only did Prof. McGonagall view his temporary descent to teenage sullenness  but she also didn’t get a chance to glimpse the mature and calm adult he has definitely transitioned into. Which had been the image he had been going for.
“What are you saying?”
They have managed to pinpoint the Room of Requirement as the origin of the curse that’s causing surges of magic. It’s been kept contained to just one wing of the castle for now but at the rate it’s growing, they’re sure it would take over the whole castle within five days.
Draco sticks his tongue out and Harry smiles smugly, his point proven.
poker. And you would think, considering the fact that you are my best mate, you would warn a bloke about something like that but I guess I was wrong in thinking so.”
As days passed and no one came knocking, Draco felt like he could finally relax. He’d sneakily ordered a wireless, using one of the school owls to place the mail order. He had been fiddling with the controls, trying to remember the spell for his preferred station that played the classics, when his attention was stolen by a knock on the door.
Another reason why he kept coming back to the classroom, despite his attempts to find a better, warmer pit stop during his nightly walks, was the view from the windows. It was directly facing the lake, the moon reflecting off the surface casting a soft shimmer across the water, enough to make Draco pause and stare. He had spent hours curled up next to the windows, lukewarm cup of tea in hand as he gazed across the forest, thoughts calming enough to let him
Malfoy laughs, the sound wrong, filled with bitter humor. “He does, even when there’s nothing to find.”
“Hmm, if you don’t take a bath, you’ll end up stinky,” Harry explains, frowning as he thinks about it.
I'm sorry! They
Courage can take many forms, even self-preservation.
Harry laughs. “We never would have guessed. Don’t forget to take that heart you made, you can hang in on the tree.”
“Potter.”
“What?” Harry asked, his eyes shone with unshed tears.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Knowing her, it’s probably something gauche and immature. She thinks it’s funny.”
Gratitude rings oddly like reminiscence, like choices I should have made and some I shouldn’t have.
With the case wrapped up and paperwork done, Emma invited everyone over for a dinner party. “We deserve it,” she had exclaimed, high-fiving Bronan. Draco had been in two minds about going, not sure if he wanted to crash the team dinner. Emma, however, seemed to have foreseen Draco’s reluctance and had sent Draco an owl every hour till he finally confirmed.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
Harry arrives at Draco’s house bright and early, armed with gifts for both his dates inside.
Ten minutes, eleven pairs of socks, two sweaters, one scarf and one jacket later Harry gives up.
. Out of his work clothes and the casual jeans and trainers he wears to the Manor, Harry looks older in his more formal outfit of a fitted blazer over trousers. Draco watches on as he greets Emma, giving her a light peck on the cheek and meeting Tara for a hug.
It was short, their lips barely brushing before he leaned back a bit to judge Potter’s expression. The other didn’t let him go far though, finally raising an arm to wind across Draco’s waist and pulling him closer. This kiss was longer, heavier, filled with promise and nervousness and an overwhelming sense of
“Where is she these days?” Harry asks, helping himself to a chocolate frog when Scorpius offers. He almost gives in when Scorpius asks if Loki can also have one, but one look at Draco’s expression and Harry shakes his head.
“Teddy has always wanted a little brother or sister. He was so happy when I told him we were all going on a vacation. He’ll be so sad when he hears you don’t feel the same way.”
Scorpius looks up at him, eyes wide, tears hanging on his lashes. “You won’t send me away?”

He’s perched over an ancient scroll, over two hundred years old; he’s not sure but he thinks it’s the report that led to the creation of the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Fixing the dial on his monocle, to increase the power of the lens, he leans in, his chair tipped forward precariously as he tries to read the script. After a few minutes of trying he shakes his head with a sigh, placing the monocle to the side; it’s still too illegible. Tipping his chair a little more forward, he waves his wand over the parchment, taking care to regulate his wand movement to control the strength of the spell. With documents as old as these they need to be treated with restoration spells in a staggered manner, gradually building the strength in the parchment.
He finally catches sight of Draco, freezing in place before making his way over.
"It was on the floor," he explains, hoping he looks as contrite as he feels, "and it had the Hogwarts crest, I just wanted to see what was in it."
“I haven’t found the right name yet,” Harry says, peering at puppy in front of him, who is lying on his back in hopes of getting a belly rub.
Malfoy rolls his eyes but Harry can see the smile at the corners of his lips.
Pansy hugs him from behind, leaning on Draco, “No you don’t, you love us. And you love him, too.”
Harry’s lost in thought, imagining a little Malfoy in the kitchen with house elves, it’s a surprisingly adorable image. He’s brought back to reality when Malfoy waves a hand in front of his face.
horrible at spying?”
“-shocking, yes,” Hermione completes. She runs her fingers over a cashmere scarf, feeling the material before adding it to her shopping bag. “He will react. Eventually.”
“No,” he answers after a while, “I don’t really work, I want to be there for Scorpius as he grows up.”
, Teddy had questioned why.
“I can see that,” Malfoy says, tapping the biscuit tin on the counter. “Come on, let’s move to the living room.”
“Right, let’s get you home.”
“Who?”
It takes him just a few seconds to come to terms with the realisation that he’s okay with holding Malfoy in his arms for as long as it needs for  him to stop looking so scared.
“Harry?”
“Gee,” Harry snaps, “how did you ever guess that?”
Harry gives Draco a kiss, holding his hand till he feels the effects of the anaesthetic spell take over and Draco’s asleep. He wishes he could go in with Draco, whisper in his ear throughout the procedure but they’d known from the start that due to the fact that Draco was having twins, the less people in the room the better. Something to do with the twins fluctuating magical cores.
Still, Draco found himself unable to imagine a scenario where he would willingly join the trio for a lunch date. What would they even talk about? The fact that Draco’s friends had abandoned him to be stuck here alone and he probably deserved it?
“Will you come with me?” Draco asks, gesturing towards the pamphlet about the Society and it’s work.
He looks pensive, the cold highlighting the flush in his cheeks. Draco is reminded of another boy he once talked to in the snow.
He whines, burrowing further into Harry’s lap. “Can Harry come?”
He's already toeing off his shoes and dropping the cardigan to the floor, the slight dip to his side of the bed already beckoning him with the comforting feel only a well-used mattress can have. As he's just about collapsed onto the bed, he feels his feet nudge something heavy. Giving in to curiosity, Harry takes a look and blinks in surprise at the red cardboard box peeking out from under the bed. It's small, about the size of a shoebox but fancier with the Hogwarts crest on the top. As he hefts it onto the bed, it strikes him where he's seen it before. They had received their final letters from Hogwarts in these, a commemorative gift for the Eighth Years to mark their special year. Harry knew for a fact this wasn't his, having long discarded the outer box.
“Because of you.”
Thank you Orlando_Switch for your prompts! ♥
“Scorpius is in a mood today,” Harry remarks softly as he helps Draco wash the dishes. The boy had been sullen all evening and refused to say a single word throughout the meal, ignoring all questions till Draco had finally snapped and sent him to his room till he learnt how to talk respectfully.
When Harry doesn’t speak up, Draco carries on. “The potion, you know. The contraceptive potion I take daily. You’ve only seen me take it a few hundred times now.”
“I don’t like you,” Scorpius states, arms crossed across his tiny chest.
For Day#25 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
The house feels oddly empty with the Scorpius’s laughter and the never ending conversations he carries out with Loki. Harry smiles as he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, Scorpius had looked so proud when he had presented Draco with the cookies he had helped decorate. The icing was sloppy in places, the sprinkles too abundant and yet Draco declared them to be the best looking cookies in the entire world.
kiss Draco good morning. He pulls Draco closer by his apron and leans in.
left behind when they rushed to open the door.”
As the snow continues to fall, they stand under the streetlight, old wounds finally starting to settle, to heal.
“Oh, okay. Do you think you’d have a free moment any time soon?”
Working with Emma is challenging, her sharp wit and extensive knowledge in the subject making her an excellent sounding board for Draco’s ideas. She knows exactly when to push and the right questions to ask when they brainstorm.
As Draco moves to leave, Harry starts, “Wait! You were saying something?”
Rather than answer, Harry opts for drowning himself in alcohol. He knows  when to pick his battles.
Harry shushes him with a kiss, unable to keep his hands off of Draco. “But nothing,” he assures him, tucking a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear, “the best surprises in life are unplanned.” Draco’s sigh of relief is enough to make Harry kiss him again. This time Draco pulls back, moving just enough so he can look at Harry, his face radiant with a smile.
At Scorpius’s eager nod he catches Draco’s eye and bends slowly, till his face is level with Draco’s neck. Even from this distance he can catch hints of something earthy, with an underlying muskiness that makes Harry’s stomach jump.
“No,” Harry answers, frowning as he tries to remember Malfoy’s trial. He had attended the first day to give his testimony but that’s it, there had been a lot going on  then for him to pay attention to the outcome.
Harry sighs at Draco’s dramatic groan. “Draco,” Harry says, waiting till Draco looks up, “just because he chose to go over to his friend’s house no way means that he doesn’t want to spend time with you.”
The words have a lot of weight to them.
Harry nervously fixes his scarf, the pamphlets in his hand slipping out of his grasp in the process. With a curse he bends down to pick them up -
“Take me home, Harry.”
Now, with Luna at the bar with Seamus, Harry and Hermione were left alone with Malfoy who seemed to be enjoying himself just as much as they were and
I hold my breath as  I reach out to trace his spine with a finger, my touch teasing and light. He doesn’t move. I take my time mapping out his back, ghosting a kiss along his shoulder as I sit up on my knees and take in my fill of him. Merlin, but he’s gorgeous. And he’s all laid out for me.
Harry shrugs, a leg thrown over Draco’s legs as he pulls Draco closer with an arm around his waist. “Hmmm, I like it here better.”
Harry brushes Draco's hair back carefully, being mindful of the bow. "Just about tomorrow."
“Don’t you have a lovely new bed, young man?” Draco asks, slipping under the covers. He shivers at the warmth, sliding his cold feet across the bed till he hears Harry squawk from the unexpected chill.
It's a dinner party!
“What about them?”
It takes him longer than he had though to gather the courage to actually ask Draco out. A week after the talking to Hermione, Harry finds himself in Draco’s kitchen, sipping on a mug of hot chocolate as Draco gets Scorpius’s dinner ready.
“Bit early for some exercise, Potter.”
Prompt for the week: "One can never have enough socks."
Dinner is a comfortable affair, a routine born out of many such cosy nights. Teddy is full of energy, eager to update his Uncle Harry about all the high intensity affairs in his class. It makes Draco look on fondly, biting his lip as he wonders how the scene might look with an addition. He can already imagine where the high chair would go, maybe with Teddy trying to feed his little cousin. It’s an image that makes him warm, makes him want to instantly blurt out his secret. He waits though, uncertainty still ever present. Soon though, he promises himself.
“It really is something,” Harry agrees, his smile now reaching his eyes.
The case facts only confirm what he suspected when they first wrote to him. While the base potion was probably a standard Sleeping Draught, the reactant added was a hybrid of one of the more common ingredients. The question was:
“ . . and then Ron starts complaining about the number of midnight trips he has to make to the market and let me tell you, Hermione was not happy about that. She really let him have it and . . hey, Malfoy?”
The inside is alive and bursting with energy. Endless varieties of trees surround him, the leaves healthy and bright despite not having been tended to in decades. He can spot Bowtruckles sprinting along the nearest tree, hear the faint trill of birds in the distance.
I start from the top of his bollocks and lick all the way up his crack. He tastes like sweat and my come.
Harry swallows, nudges at his collar and follows Malfoy inside.
“You don’t know that,” Draco retorts, cringing internally at how petulant he sounds.
Even as he read up on the properties of the Invisibility Potion he found his mind drifting to the lone figure running around the lake, the fog following in his path.
The song changes, making the crowd roar; there are people jumping around them, the lights flashing brighter and faster and yet Draco Malfoy has eyes only for Harry Potter. He wants to find Blaise and tell him that he’s right, there’s no way Draco could even think about going home with anyone else tonight when he has the option of getting fucked so hard by Harry Potter that he forgets his name. But it’s not only about that, it’s also about the warm body that holds him tight at night, the lazy morning kisses that make him wonder how he ever woke up before and the breakfast in bed.
And the little monster
Much like the rest of the house, the dining room is stunning. Bathed in warm lamp light, it’s cosy and inviting. Little tea lights in shallow glass bowls are placed all the way down the centre of the table, the candle light reflecting off of the crystal goblets placed next to them. Interspersed throughout are little sprigs of baby’s breath, the flowers standing out amongst all the glass.
He calls Zeb, asking him to help Teddy wash up and then get started on breakfast. Draco waits till they’re out of the room to finally look at Harry. He’s seated himself on the carpet as well, arms wrapped around his legs.
Harry trudges behind Hermione as they try to make their way down the crowded street in Diagon Alley. He mutters as he moves the many bags he’s carrying from hand to the other.
God!”.
The little hellion comes running down the hall, stumbling over his own little feet as he races towards Harry. He’s a real mischief maker, his name more than apt for his personality.
“You did it!” Harry cheers, rushing over to where Draco stands. “Oh my God, Draco, you’re brilliant!”
At Harry’s nod he smiles, bouncing excitedly. “We live there,” he points towards his house, “that means we are, umm, wait a second.”
“I asked you to wait for me,” Harry chided, rolling up his sleeves as he settled down in front of Draco.
Draco laughs in surprise as Harry pulls him onto his lap, hugging him close with his face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck.
optimist now.”
I couldn't stop if I wanted to.  The urge to taste him again makes me lick a long stripe again. And again. His arsehole is covered in my spit and spunk, marking him as mine. I reach one hand to give my cock a quick squeeze to take off the pressure.
Harry casts another irritated glance down the street, there’s still no sign of Hermione. The red telephone booth provides him some measure of protection from the biting wind but he can still feel his lips tingling.
“Mistletoe.”
ravenous.
A naked, furious, Malfoy.
Besides his packages the only post he got was from his mother, whose letters arrived, without fail, every Tuesday and Saturday. Their own little tradition since his first year at Hogwarts. This was why he was pleasantly surprised the morning he awoke to find an unfamiliar owl waiting for him next to his bedroom window. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, he stumbled over, taking the letter and dropping a few treats for the owl.
Harry shakes his head. “That was our sixth date, on our fourth I took you to the dinner party at the Minister’s house.”
The longest chapter so far, phew!
Harry can feel Draco shrug, his head a comforting weight on his shoulder.
Harry sucks in a sharp breath, twisting his t-shirt in his hands. Fuck, fuck, double fuck. He needs to leave now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Come on! I’ll race you to the bedroom.”
However, the reality was a lot different. The Manor was as dark and chilling as he’d remembered, the never-ending corridors and looming portraits doing nothing to make him welcome. His mother had already written to him five times since the end of the year, urging him to join her in Nice, using the weather, the food, even the abundance of single men as an excuse.
There’s only neighbour left to meet.
The other blinked, posture rigid before he all but deflated, wand arm falling limp to the side as he wiped a hand across his forehead. Despite the relaxed stance, Draco didn’t miss how Potter kept a tight hold on his wand.
“Gentlemen,” Healer Walsh speaks up, the smile on his face reassuring Harry a little, “it’s time.”
“Potter,” Malfoy says, nudging Scorpius forward when he looks back for permission. “I assume that’s why you were in a hurry earlier?”
Malfoy nods and take a seat on the floor next to Harry. They are settled against the couch, with the fire roaring in front of them and the storm raging outside and it’s comfortably cosy.
Harry can’t remember having had so much fun in a long time. They didn’t run out of things to talk about the entire time, he
“Ron-“
Harry waves at Bronan. “Mrs Weasley offered to keep him. Draco—”
Happy Holidays everyone! I hope 2021 is filled with nothing but joy and good health for all! ♥
Draco laughs, a jagged, bitted sound that makes Harry flinch.
Malfoy laughs. “It’s okay to be shocked, Potter,” he teases, his eyes twinkling as Harry blushes, “I know I was. To go from spending my life with no cares or concerns in the world, to suddenly becoming responsible for a little life.”
personality. Normally, Draco would be proud that his son has had the chance to grow into his own person. But when midway during lunch, Scorpius throws a tantrum of epic proportions and overturns his glass onto Harry’s lap, Draco has to call onto every shred of patience he has not to react like his father.
Harry waits patiently as Malfoy collects his thoughts. Truth be told, he had almost forgotten the real reason behind why he had been interested in Malfoy in the first place.
“Fine,” Draco says, he leans forward on his elbows to look at Ron thoughtfully, “how about we make it a little interesting?”
try to warn Ron.
Draco smirks, blinking up at Harry from where he's leaning on Harry's chest. "I hope you're not getting any ideas, I have to head back to the Manor in a bit,"
"I can't," Draco groans, his words in contrast to how he slots one leg between Harry's. "Pansy wants to look at Mother's china collection for that charity gala she's hosting next month."
That’s when Harry notices it. Dave is also wearing a coat. A blue coat.
Draco doesn’t want compliments.
“I still love you a lot Scorpius, you’re my little baby, but I also love Teddy and Harry.”
Longest chapter so far, wow. I loved today's prompt!
was. Who would have thought that Malfoy could cook?
As they inched closer to November, Draco found himself sneakily applying Warming Charms along the path Potter usually ran. He was sure Potter was more than capable of doing such basic wandwork, but reminding him would involve talking to him, and Draco was trying to avoid that as much as possible.
He didn’t know you could be fined for flying a broomstick while intoxicated. The things you can learn from bar posters.
“Harry, what if daddy is stinky too?”
Draco’s near the lifts, finally done with the meeting. The conversation lasted over three hours, Draco’s questions making the team go over certain points multiple times.
The last ingredient will be handled by Emma and the other experts at the lab, while Draco will take care of the first three. He has to start by isolating each ingredient, studying their nature to plot possible variants and then test each hybrid with the potion to measure against potency.
It’s as he’s just at the cusp, rocking between a state of sleep and consciousness, he feels Harry fidget softly behind him.
He waits patiently as Draco works, his messy hair now a familiar white-blond again. Once Draco leans back a bit, Teddy chews on his lip before speaking up, his voice wobbling.
“Mr. Potter,” she starts, her voice wavering as she visibly fights to retain composure. “Thank you.”
“Malfoy, what’s the male version of a temptress?”
“Wait, what?” Harry sputtered, “Draco! I don’t understand.
He starts spending more time at the Ministry, poring over ledgers and documents taken from different suppliers to find any striking anomalies that can offer a direction for him to take in his research. He has multiple hybrid strains going at the same time, but to test each would take a while.
“Dogs can’t really read.”
no idea how Harry will react, it’s overshadowed by sheer joy. He feels almost giddy with exaltation.
“Draco!”
For Day#4 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
With a child in his arms.
Malfoy groans and buries his face in Harry’s chest, making Harry laugh and pull him closer.
“Kinglsey has a knack of spotting the good in people.”
The story ends here for now. I might add a vignette or two soon because there are still some prompts and scenarios I feel I want to touch upon. If there's
It’s never about love.
He flushes, it’s not the first time Harry’s ever praised him but he’s never gotten used to the easy way Harry does it.
Someone who can be infuriating, who can make Harry want to hit something in frustration and at the same time shout off the rooftops his love for the bane of his existence.
“Draco, I was just looking for you, we need to go for our fit-”
Finally, in little more than a whisper, Scorpius says, “I’m not Father’s favorite anymore.”
Draco sat back, disappointed. If the Floo was locked, it meant Harry wasn’t home. With how erratic Harry’s schedule was, Draco wasn’t surprised to find no one home despite it being only nine am.
Draco had watched, amazed, as Potter had transformed a spare roll of parchment into a little Snitch, complete with the etched markings around it. He’d handed it to Draco with a smile, the soft look in his eyes making Draco feel oddly light-headed. As their fingers had brushed, Draco found he couldn’t look away, had to make himself turn towards the tree and gently place it right at the top.
“He’ll be up at five sharp, you know,” Harry whispers, smiling as Draco groans into his pillow.
Apparently Scorpius is a fan of Muggle comics. He can’t really read them yet but he’s fascinated by the art.
“Would you like to come in?” Draco pants against his cheek, he looks debauched, his hair's a mess thanks to Harry’s hands, his cheeks flushed and lips kiss bruised.
“Malfoy, come on-”
Harry looks older, smarter. His hair seems to have finally grown into some semblance of style, making him look more put together than the Harry he remembers. He looks sturdier too, his shoulders filling in the robes in a way they didn’t before.
Harry tries not to think about how Malfoy’s arm is almost touching his, the crowd gathered around them pushing them closer by the minute.
“Finally! Draco, he’s not your fuck buddy, stop calling him that,” Pansy laughs gleefully. Draco resists the urge to turn back and hex both of them.
He waits as Mrs. Malfoy goes through the paper, her brow creased as she reads through the list of schools. He’s nervous as he fixes her piercing gaze on him, her eyes filled with emotion.
ingredient was it and what had it been cross-bred with to create the new, more potent version?
Hermione stares at Harry mournfully, depending on Harry to steer them through the crowded street. He gives up with chuckle, Hermione pulls him into a hug and smiles, relieved.
“Harry.”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
As the snow crunches beneath their feet, Harry wonders how Draco had thought that Harry could ever say no, his nervousness last night had been adorable and it had left Harry wanting to hug him, whisper praises in his ear and make him feel like he’s worth something.
“I’m not sure how I can assist, to be honest. My line of work focuses more on research than on solving cases,” Draco remarks, following Everly towards the back of the Atrium from where multiple lifts are zooming in and out every second.
. Malfoy is staring at him, biting his lip as he waits for Harry to reply. The ache has been replaced by a warmth that’s filling his body, starting from his toes to the tips of his fingers.
Draco sputters, face heating up as he locks eyes with Harry, who looks very smug for someone holding chunks of raw beef. Draco rolls his eyes at Harry’s smirk, sniffing politely before going back to openly admiring his husband. “Just enjoying what’s in front of me.”
Harry shakes his head with a sigh and gestures for her to keep walking.
As curiosity overtakes exhaustion, Harry settles in, pulling the covers halfway over himself as he drags the box closer. Pulling out the first photo on the top, Harry barely resists throwing it back in as he took in his dreadful hairstyle. The neatly written date at the bottom right corner makes him smile in awe, remembering little bits and pieces of the night. It was the first time Draco had joined their pub night, invited along by Hermione of all people. Harry had been surprised, and a little skeptical. He remembers asking Hermione if she was absolutely positive about bringing Malfoy along. Smiling at the photo now, Harry's glad she pushed for it, gave Draco a chance to find friends and move on.
It's a shifting thing, this comfortable warmth that he can't imagine not being there, growing from an inferno sometimes to a crackling ember other times. It's always there. He can feel it rumbling now, growing in intensity as he takes in this Draco backlit by the sun, the tips of hair stained gold. The bright light only serves to highlight the curves Draco hides behind layered clothes, the warmth in Harry's chest blazing at the thought of being the only one to see Draco like this. Without any layers at all.
Before Harry can speak up he hears someone call him from behind.
Draco snorts lightly at the
“Will Draco read to me?” he asks Harry, refusing to look at Draco.
Draco nods solemnly, turning away to hide his smile. “Of course.”
He doesn’t really know why he’s hiding the fact that Malfoy is neighbour, it’s not like Ron would do anything. But there’s a part of him that wants to keep Malfoy’s existence to himself for now, the same part that wanted to hug Malfoy that night, the same part that wants to learn more about Malfoy - not because of any suspicions about Malfoy’s reappearance but because he’s genuinely interested.
. Drinking together does not equal sleeping with someone and yet, on a rainy Saturday morning, Harry wakes up to a naked Malfoy staring at him.
in his life he would be worried about the severity and single minded focus with which he’s been consuming these sugary nuggets of gold.
Before Draco could ask something, Potter hurriedly spoke up again, looking flustered. “
I feel like I don't say it enough but genuinely, thank you so much to everyone who has been reading and commenting!
It takes some manoeuvring but I’m finally able to ease up behind him, letting my arms take all my weight as they bracket him to the bed.  In one careful push I line myself with his entrance, the head of my cock resting against his hole. It takes all my willpower not to just push in. Besides the fact that I don’t want to wake him up, I also don’t want to hurt him.
Harry frowns, his other hand coming up to cup Draco’s cheek. Draco can see his mouth open, see the concern on his face.
Harry turns, surprised. He smiles on seeing Draco, though he keeps glancing at the lifts impatiently.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was ready for a quiet thank you, maybe one of those rare smiles that make Harry’s heart skip a beat.
“If there’s a single pulled thread on this, Blaise, then I swear to Merlin . . .” Draco trails off, letting the threat hang in the air. Blaise knows the suit is a Brioni, one of the few things Draco doesn’t hesitate before splurging on. The Malfoy coffers may not be anywhere near depleted but Draco knows better than to waste money now, he’s seen a life free from money troubles and he’s also seen a life where for a few months they had no idea if they would have any money left after the Ministry seized their accounts for reparations.
“You’re very good with him,” Harry offers, leaning back on his chair to grab the tin of biscuits from the counter behind him.
The fact that Draco is no longer nervous about asking Harry, feels comfortable enough to just invite him over is what makes Harry say yes.
“I know I’m different, I’m sorry, but please don’t make me go away . . “
“He finds it funny when the blocks fall on me,” Draco complains with a smile, laughing when Harry presses kisses against his neck.
The other rolled his eyes, drawing his wand in a swift move and using it to light a little fire in it.
The Burrow starts decorating for Christmas while Ron and Harry have a quick chat.
“So,” Malfoy starts, looking everywhere but at Harry. “I still owe you some answers.”
Thinking of the weeks of planning, how easily everything fell together and Draco's suit that he hasn't been allowed to peek at yet, Harry leans closer as Draco tilts his head up.
Harry stumbles and almost falls. They’ve been walking for an hour, relying on their wands to direct them towards the camp. He smirks  at the sound of Malfoy chuckling. It takes just a flick, before perfectly formed snow balls are targeting the Slytherin, making him whine and curse Harry.
But Harry cuts him off, “I know I don’t have to but I
Draco tries to glower but Harry can see the smile peeking through the facade and he takes his chance. “I love you.”
“No!” Scorpius looks horrified; he starts wriggling in Harry’s arms, eager to be put down. “Daddy, I need a bath!”
Before I leave, he holds onto my wrists and leans into kiss me.
Where Scorpius is stinky and Hermione is clever.
The soft niggling tones of the alarm break through Draco’s consciousness, making him whine in annoyance. The chill of the cool October morning is seeping through the slight crack in the window and he wants nothing more than to curl deeper under his blanket towards the warmth his furnace of a husband radiates. As the alarm goes on, he sits up with a sigh, waving his hand to cut the noise off before it reaches a headache inducing volume.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
He’s ready to give the people a piece of his mind—there’s absolutely no reason anyone should be calling him
Malfoy looks amused as he takes the tin from the Harry, he opens the lid and peeks inside. He’s expecting Malfoy to make another scathing reply, instead Malfoy takes a look at the biscuits inside and asks, “Lemon blueberry?”

Harry chokes on his toast, prompting Seamus to reach over and thump him on the back. He gasps and tries to catch his breath.
all the attention he’s getting.
just as Harry walked through the door to the sitting room.
Scorpius makes no move to indicate he’s heard Harry, but that doesn’t stop Harry from getting comfortable on the bed.
HELP! I need help naming the puppy! I'm coming up blank, unless Snuffles and Mr. Paws count. :(
It was a testament to just how out of it Potter was that he went along with Draco without complaint. Thankfully, given the time of morning, the castle was empty—even Mrs Norris was absent from her usual prowls in search of unsuspecting students.
I looked up indoor plants in the UK and the palm showed up so I went with it. Though I do wonder that maybe in the magical world any plant can survive because
He can see that Scorpius is trying to say something and though it’s difficult, he wants nothing more than to comfort the kid, he stays patient.
spying. It isn’t really his fault that he look right into Malfoy’s backyard from his bedroom window.
He steps onto the spell warmed floor and curls his toes with a hum of satisfaction, stretching his arms to shake off the last dregs of sleep. It’s still fairly early in the morning, the sun rays just starting to inch along the floorboards, glinting off the wall of frames across the windows, but 7am rounds are an integral part of his job description as a Healer.
Harry laughs as Teddy tries to tackle him to the ground, his small fists barely making Harry feel a thing but he falls to the ground, groaning and pleading for mercy.
The glint of the sunlight across the corner of his eyes makes Harry look away from Draco for a second and he catches sight of the ever-present camera placed on Draco's side of the bed.
Harry snorts, biting back the appreciative moan at the delicious smells wafting from the kitchen. It smells heavenly, and he tells Draco so, his chin on Draco’s shoulder, watching him stir the sauce bubbling on the stove.
“Time for bed,” he breathes before turning over so his back is against Harry’s chest.
With each passing day Draco feels closer to a breakthrough, the investigation narrowed down to two possible additives. If he can identify the right one, Emma can run it through their list of suppliers to note which of them had access to it.
There’s a loud whoop.
And Harry does just that.
He looks nervous, ready to watch his life spiral out of control and it’s too much like Sixth Year for Harry to digest.
much.”
He can’t stop thinking about Draco.
Harry climbs up his stairs, stamping his feet to get the snow off his boots before stepping inside. Once he’s done shedding all the extra layers he had to put on before stepping out, Harry heads straight for his kitchen. Ron had dared him to eat the last bean from the box of Bertie’s Every Flavour Bean they had been sharing as they walked around Diagon Alley; he

Malfoy stops for a breath and Harry keeps his eyes on the kettle.
Scorpius shrugs, pulling on a loose thread in Harry’s sweater.
Harry nods, finally heading through the doors. Draco stands there for a bit till the wizard behind him grumbles pointedly, making him flush and move aside.
"However,," Draco pouts, gazing at a photo of Harry hard at work in their garden, the sunlight giving the picture a hazy look,  "I am annoyed at myself for not hiding it better, you weren't supposed to see it before tomorrow."
Draco shakes his head, trying to act nonchalant but his fidgeting fingers show just how nervous he is.
“What did you do?” He asks Scorpius.
Neither knew how to give. What to give. So they observe, wait and watch and think and act. They have years of experience on how to read the other,
(See the end of the chapter for
“This is ridiculous,” he pouts, running a hand through his now messy fringe.. A flick of his wand makes the knives stop mid air and rest gently along the cutting boards. Grabbing another cookie, Draco goes back to reading the recipe from top to bottom, determined to figure out where he went wrong and how to fix it. He’s so engrossed in reading that he doesn’t register the chiming of the Floo or the sound of his husband dumping his things near the kitchen door.
Loosely based on a prompt by Orlando_Switch! (I kinda glossed over everyone's reactions instead of going into too much detail!)
The night Draco got the scar was simultaneously the scariest and the happiest night of Harry’s life.
Hermione’s smirk is pure evil, her eyes twinkling as she takes in the sight of Harry laden down with her shopping bags.
Within minutes they’re both flat on their backs, breaths puffing in front of them as they pant with exertion.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Harry waits eagerly while Draco takes the card out of its envelope and he’s rewarded with Draco sputtering in embarrassment, his face and ears red as he stares at the card.
(and at least he hadn’t blasted a biscuit tin in annoyance. He was surprised Malfoy hadn’t been put into detention.)
It never comes.
That night they troop back home, Scorpius asleep in Harry’s arms as Draco carries Loki, the little puppy tired out from all the running and playing.
Draco blushes. “I might have forgotten to take the potion one day. In my defense though,
Feeling victorious at the thought of finally seeing the photo, Harry smiles. That moment feels like it happened ages ago and yet feels like it happened just yesterday. It's sometimes difficult to think back on that period of his life after Hogwarts and before Draco. He knows those two years did happen, but compared to his life now they are so inconsequential that he barely thinks of them. Riffling through the photos now, he's almost startled to see actual evidence of just how much he's changed since meeting Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron-“
Malfoy shrugs, looking too unconvinced for Harry’s liking.
Taking the first step is always the hardest, especially if you’ve never done it before.
He knocks once on the door before walking in, the occupants of the room pausing their conversation to face the new entrants. The woman nearest to the door seems to be around his age, with light brown hair tied neatly at the nape of her neck. The man next to her looks older, smart glasses perched at the bridge of his nose, clearly visible laugh lines signalling his age. Sitting across from them is a much older woman, greying hair pulled back into a stern bun, though the expression is softened by the smile on her face as she rises to greet Draco.
I don’t know which scares me more.
“I dunno?” Potter had shrugged awkwardly, one arm curled tight around the cauldron. “Did anyone ask you to?”
It's hard to resist teasing Draco a bit further though. "Look at you," he leans forward eagerly, the plush blanket sinking under him as he tries to get Draco to look at him,  the flush on his cheeks very telling. "Let no one ever say Slytherins aren't sentimental fools."

at Slythindor100.
It might have been years since he had last seen the Slytherin, but Harry knows he can easily spot that head of hair in a crowd. That’s definitely Malfoy.
Even as he keeps a lookout for his date, Harry slows down a little to enjoy the walk. It’s been a while since he’s managed to take some time out in the middle of the day to go for a stroll. The Department of International Magical Cooperation had really expanded after the War, setting up sub-departments to strengthen ties with magical communities across the globe. When Harry had joined the Forgien Relations team, it was just him and two others trying to set up some semblance of structure. As they’d started stationing diplomats in partnering countries, the staff size had grown tenfold and so had Harry’s workload.
He can think back to the exact moment when he decided to ignore his responsibilities and throw his parents to the mercy of that mad man.
Blaise coughs once, the only warning Draco gets, before he’s being manhandled away from the table.
Harry waits as Draco peeks into the box, going through some of the photos with gentle care with which he handles his camera
Malfoy winces. "No need to shout, Potter, I'm right here."
Harry can’t help but wonder if Ron’s final reaction be more of an explosion.
are the male version of a temptress. Tempting me with your, you know, your hair,” he gestures fondly at the offending hair, “your perfect clothes and the way you walk and when you bend –”
Harry. That was another topic he was trying hard not to think too much about. It was difficult though, to go from spending more than half his day with someone to only being able to catch up via rushed Floo calls and a single, brief visit. He was trying not to feel too upset about it; he knew Harry had a lot on his plate with first getting the required paperwork and the medical tests done and then the actual Trainee Program itself.
Harry stares at Draco. “What do you mean no?”
“You always sulk when you feel like things aren’t going your way, like when we were six and got our training brooms. Dear Merlin, it was just one time, one time I wanted to be Seeker but no, how could you let anyone else be Seeker?”
“Harry, then,” Draco starts, rolling his eyes at Harry’s satisfied smile, “as I was saying, there’s something else you should know, Sc-”
Harry had reassured him that his friends were unaware of the existence of the room and trusted Harry when he said he was okay. He said they only cared that he was doing fine and looking healthier than he had in months.
Draco peers up at him through his fringe, Harry meeting his gaze as he drags his palm across Draco's back. He can see the exact moment Draco makes up his mind, making that warmth in Harry's chest flare as Draco just about throws the covers back so he can straddle Harry.
When I can take no more I slowly pull out a little, shuddering at the hold his body has on me, greedy enough to not let go even in sleep. Without pulling out completely I push back in again, feeling his hips jerk as I rub against his prostate.
He walks back in a second later, rolling up his sleeves with a reluctant sigh.
“Yes?”
Draco isn’t sure if he responds, isn’t sure of when he moves but within seconds he’s all the way across the kitchen. Harry holds a cup of tea out to him, the slight hint of honey wafting from the steam tells Draco it’s just the way he likes it. This small act of familiarity pushes his already sensitive emotions into overdrive, making him blink furiously as he feels his eyes water.
It’s hard to be grateful when the terms of my probation are read out to me; sweeping floors was never on my list of aspirations.

distracted me!”
If Draco wants to sneakily move in he can also take over half the chores.
Harry frowns. “You didn’t want to join them?”
For Day 9 of the 25 Days of Drarry 2020 Challenge!
“That’s not fair, Potter! No magic allowed.”
Draco feels any energy he managed to muster seep right out of him. The poor child is finally quieting down, strong sobs no longer wracking his little frame.
“Oh,” Harry smiles, the soft, very
“Why? I mean, yeah, you did hog the blankets but that’s okay, I managed to steal them back.”
“Yeah, there’s something about working against the clock,” Draco muses, thinking back to the exhilaration he felt on finding the answer. “It’s quite unlike my regular research work.”
“Yeah, but I’m
what you think?” He looks offended, and oddly betrayed.
With great difficulty Harry shakes his head, holding onto Draco slim waist with both hands. He would love nothing more than to go in, show Draco the depth of what he already feels for him but beneath the haze of lust clouding Draco’s eyes, Harry can catch a hint a nervousness, a bite of apprehension that tells him that maybe Draco isn’t ready.
“Do you have Mr. Spencer?”
Malfoy is on the sofa, holding onto a cup with both hands. He looks nervous, the earlier playfulness missing at the sun rise.
Basically this means Harry and Draco can't go on that date
Once he starts cleaning though, he finds himself sort of enjoying it. There’s something almost therapeutic about it. If Draco were there, he would probably call Harry an emotional fool and order him to clean faster.
“Malfoy,” Potter gasped, struggling to catch his breath, blinking rapidly as the wind picked up speed. “What are you doing here?”
Where they have dinner. At Draco's house. Just the two of them. No Scorpius. All alone.
For Day#1 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
With all the patience I can muster, I slowly move my hips forward and ease into him, biting my lips to hold back a moan that’s threatening to break free. No matter how many times we’ve done this before, the feeling of Draco’s body clenching around me, holding me in, will never fail to amaze me.
Hours later Harry finds himself seated across from Dave in a cosy family run restaurant. It’s a quaint little place with only six tables, the wooden tables worn and softened by years of use. Bright holiday decorations cover the walls, the servers dressed in festive hats. Even the brick fireplace they managed to snag a table by has a tasteful garland draped across it.
“Sorry, am I disturbing you?”
“Yeah,” Harry says, laughing, “Neville should really know better than to accept any sort of food item from George. And Ron probably wasn’t even paying attention to what he was eating.”
, I’ll add those oils that relax your muscles.”
“Come in, I’m so glad you could make it!”
Draco barely managed to restrain what would have been a very undignified snort but thankfully Potter seemed to have caught the hint. Draco looked on in amusement as the boy in front of him blushed, one hand fiddling with the ruffled ends of the garishly yellow scarf.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s not sure Ron’s reaction would have been as subdued as his.
“You have
The cabin they arrive at for their reunited family holiday looks cosy and the scenery outside makes a Muggle think of Narnia in winter. In such a beautiful place one can’t stay too much indoors. So snow fight it is.
The wedding planning is an exercise in patience. If pressed on the issue, Draco would have conceded that
Harry takes in the man in front of him. His cool gaze, the messy fringe so in contrast to his proper clothes and the graceful manner in which he handles his glass. The slight hint of nervousness as he distractedly nods along to whatever Neville is saying, never looking away from Harry.
“It’s time to party!”
Draco startles, almost falling over. He sits back on the ground, shielding his eyes from the direct glare of the sun as he looks up to find Harry.
“Can they learn how to read?”
“Right back at you, Potter.”
“I’m fine,” Harry reassures him, pressing a kiss  on his brow. Draco says nothing but standing as close as they are, Harry can feel his body relax, curl a little more into his.
So he does, till they’re interrupted by the soft hooting of an owl sitting on the kitchen windowsill.
Harry’s confusion must have shown on his face, as Malfoy explains, “My son.”
“So if I take Loki can he learn too?”
Within weeks Draco realised that Sprout had started assigning more of the finicky plants to his care. As a result, he started spending even longer hours reading and researching, often also bothering her at odd times of the day if he had a question.
Ron already knows where this is heading, no brilliant swirls or hearts for him today. “Order one more hot chocolate then, and one of those cinnamon rolls he loves.”
“Shh,” he whispers, running a hand through Draco’s hair, “they’re okay. Both of them, Draco, they’re okay.”
Harry keeps staring at the posters around the pub.
Just 2 more days! :)
The remaining 4 chapters will be little glimpses of their life ahead, the family they build together. From the bottom of my heart, I thank each and every single person who read this silly little fic, left a kudos, bookmarked it or, most of all, commented. You kept me going. Thank you. :')
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
The first time they meet, as boys who have barely had time to grow into the men they
So he does, till they’re interrupted by the soft hooting of an owl sitting on the kitchen windowsill.
Harry carries on obliviously, using his wand to reignite the fire under the pot and getting started on chopping the beef. Draco watches on in rapt fascination, eyes tracking Harry’s arms as he deftly handles the knives, the corded muscles in his arms prominent as he chops through the bone with ease. He’s still in his work clothes sans his jacket and outer robes. The stiff white shirt is slightly creased, no doubt from Harry tugging at it all day. It’s still tucked into his well tailored grey trousers, Draco’s eyes tracking his form. He hums appreciatively, proud of himself for finally showing Harry the wonders of proper tailoring.
“In here,” Draco calls out from the kitchen, “cleaning up the mess
excited to be back in the place he once called home.
“Malfoy, can—”
Harry whines as Draco pulls away, grabbing at his sweater to try and reel him back in.
It was definitely working.
“Draco’s pregnant,” Harry mumbles, still in a daze. He feels like his entire life just got tilted on  its axis and it won’t ever reset the same. As they get hugged by everyone around them, congratulations and exclamations all around, Harry and Draco don’t  let go of each other’s hand.
It’s a good thing that Harry has never been one to give up easily.
Unfortunately for him, Harry forget to factor in one important consideration -
He smiles as a familiar great grey owl flies across the sky towards his window. Hermione had been very reluctant to bet an owl, but after months of trying to get Pig to listen to her she had finally caved and let Harry convince her into buying one for herself.
“It’s okay.”
"Draco?"
“Aww, no,” Draco soothes him, laughing, he places a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek before pulling him forward by the hand. “I did really work hard on dinner and I would like to hear you compliment me on my efforts.”
They settle down on the sofa after, the wireless playing an older ballad in the background, as Draco reads to Teddy. Within minutes Teddy is asleep, leaning fully onto Draco. With one hand he drapes a throw blanket over the child, wandlessly bringing over one of his own books to read.
Harry flinches. “Quiet down, Malfoy, jeez.” He hides under the pillow and sighs in relief at the reprieve from the bright  light. His joy though is short lived when Malfoy snatches the pillow away.
Scorpius huffs.
Thank you to everyone reading along! Your comments really keep me going otherwise writing a chapter a day would be quite an impossible feat for me. ♥
There’s a rapidly growing pile of boxes collecting in the foyer—a mix of his things from France, new furniture pieces for his bedroom and a supply of the materials needed for his research. His original plan for the weekend was to get started on clearing out that pile and finally setting up his bedroom. However, after a quick breakfast, where he spends more time poring over his notes rather than eating, he sets off for the arboretum.
Andromeda laughs fondly, bending low to brush a kiss against her grandson’s cheek before gently nudging him towards the stairs. “Go on, Grandma will see you on Monday okay? Be a good boy for your Uncles and don’t forget to brush before bed.”
He gets his answer the one time Draco gets carried away in his discussion with Emma. It is past seven by the time he realises. On his way out of the department, he’s surprised to spot Harry pacing in front of the lifts. Even as far away as he is, it is clear to Draco that Harry is clearly agitated, one hand running through his hair like it always does when he is stressed.
“I told you you could do it.”
acting like a big baby.”
As a lift finally arrives, Harry sighs in relief. He rushes in and presses the button for the Atrium, Draco following behind him.
This drabble was the winner that week. I remember staring at my screen in shock because I would have been glad to just survive another week!
Harry climbs up the steps to Draco’s house slowly, nervousness making him clench his fingers around the wine bottle in his hand.
The music is loud, loud enough that conversation is almost impossible unless you’re sequestered in the VIP room. Draco takes a moment to let the environment seep in, lets the thumping beat of the club reverberate till his toes and push away the stress of work.
define him, and you have to let it stop restricting you.”
“And when you wake up,” Harry continues, struggling to keep his voice calm, “I’ll be there, with our sons in my arms. I don’t know how I’ll hold them both but I’ll manage, till their father wakes up and they can see just how loved they are going to be.”
Things are moving along!
“So, Draco,” Everly calls for his attention, “what do you have planned now that you’re free of us?”
Harry clenches his jaw and decides that he needs to have a chat with not only Bobby’s parents, but the school tomorrow because isn’t this exactly the kind of bigotry they were assured Scorpius wouldn’t have go through.
“What the hell happened?”
He spent the night dozing in his abandoned classroom, now slightly more comfortable due to the sudden appearance of more blankets and a tattered old sofa. He was not sure where they came from or who dropped them off, but he felt like he’d seen
It was as Draco was about to turn in for the night, the lights in the Manor dimmed, that he heard the downstairs Floo chime. He was sorely tempted to just turn the lights off and go to bed. The anger that simmered under his skin was dangerously close to boiling over, and he wasn’t sure how or when it would explode.
Harry takes in a deep breath. Nods. The child playing near the trees squeals as light makes snow from the branches fall around him.
“Really?” Harry didn’t mean to sound so surprised but the thought of a fourteen year old Malfoy learning how to cook during the summers doesn’t really fit in with the image I had.
Harry arches his back outside their room, finally starting to feel the aches creep up his muscles after a day spent in mostly the same position. Draco tuts and places a hand on Harry’s back, gently moving him towards their room.
Harry slides further under the covers, pulling Draco with him.
Fear slithers in like the Dark Lord’s snake.
Keep those snowballs coming. At least it's not a filler chapter. :D The relatives leave tomorrow!
“You okay, mate?” Seamus asks, handing him a glass of water.
Draco resists the urge to thunk his head against the bar.
“No,” Malfoy snaps, pulling the covers away. Harry almost laughs at the owlish expression on his face when he realises Harry’s naked too. “Why aren’t you freaking out right now?”
smile that Draco could once never get enough of. “I’m sure he would love to, thank you.”
“Just say yes. We can worry about everything else later.”
Failing to take a single step, Draco sits down onto the carpet, Teddy instantly climbing onto his lap and clinging to him.
“He spends all the time with you now. And Teddy. But Teddy is okay because I like playing with him.” Scorpius adds with a pout.
He watched suspiciously as Potter smiled, nodding to himself once before carefully placing the cauldron on the floor between them.
“Do you like strawberries?”
busy ugh.
Harry spots Draco first and takes a moment to admire what he’s allowed to call his own. Draco looks like he belongs here, surrounded by people who compliment him in hopes to be allowed in his bed. Harry wants to laugh. He thinks about the bruise on Draco’s arm, a mark on top of the one taken to appease a Father.
Harry blinks awake gradually, the pull of sleep trying valiantly to drag him under but the cold air around his feet wins. Half asleep he pulls at the covers, smiling in triumph when he manages to drag them over so he can be saved from the wretched cold. He's blinking awake a few seconds later though, wondering just why it had been so easy to get the blanket when his bedmate is notorious for hogging them through the night.
the letter from his desk and levitates it over to Harry. It’s fun watching his expression go from tense to curious to hopeful.
Harry thunks his head against the door.
Freedom burns like never ending pain.
“Nothing . . just, nothing,” he trails off, too overwhelmed to put it into words.
He’s out walking the puppy when he spots Scorpius waving from the window. Harry waves back, smiling as he sees Draco trying to make Scorpius put a coat on.
“Are you sure he won’t accidentally spoil anything?” Harry asks cautiously, keeping an eye on Teddy slowly making his way down the row. Draco shakes his head, noting down his observations to send to Emma.
“Why am I different?”
“Stop thinking so much.”
The date will happen tomorrow. I promise. I'm making sure to mention it here so you can hold me accountable!
“I demand a rematch.”
Potter eagerly nodded, looking relieved at the change in topic. “Surprisingly, yes! I think the complete absence of people helped. Well, except for you. Since you were here. But that didn’t bother me. At all. I didn’t even notice you. Not that you’re easy to miss, Malfoy!”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“Okay then. Come on Grandma,” he calls, jumping off Harry’s lap, but not before giving him a quick hug.
Harry’s pulled out his thoughts by a loud sob. Draco is hunched over in front of him, hands gripping the counters for support as his shoulder’s shake by the force of his sobs.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr Malfoy.” Way smiles. Draco recognises her name from the letters—she was the one who reached out to him. “I really enjoyed your paper on the impact of planetary angles on Darkwort potency.”
An hour later finds Harry ready to just give in and take all of them home. It is only the thought of Hermione’s reaction to his impulsive decision that stops him. Well, that and the fact that he isn’t sure he can take very good care of one puppy, so more than thirty puppies is out of the question.
“Harry look at the bird, like in the book!” Teddy yells, beckoning the peacock closer.
Draco thinks about it, takes in all the people around him and smirks.
“What?”
“Yeah,” Harry replies, wondering why Draco sounds so confused. “For our date?”
He couldn’t pinpoint when or how, but the early mornings became his favourite part of the day. He couldn't remember the last time he found comfort in any time of day other than the deepest part of the night. Yet, without fail, he looked forward to dawn when he could start making his way down the stairs.
The night before they have to tackle the room, they go out to Hogsmeade.
"No."
, was making no move to leave.
Harry thinks frantically, cursing his mouth and it’s inability to work with his brain.
More than anything, he looks well rested though slightly harried.
He shrugs, looking around with a stilted smile.
“Mrs. Malfoy, it’s nice to see you.”
“This is David Bronan, he’s the Field Agent assigned to the case as well as our liaison with the Auror Office.”
how serious the little boy was about this. “Draco, you also scold Harry like Bill’s dad Jin scolds his other dad.” Teddy had frowned, arms crossed across his little chest.
He’s not prepared for the rush of longing that steals through him as he imagines Draco and Scorpius decorating the tree together, laughing and giggling together as they share this memory. He wants to be a part of it.
“Hey, bud,” Harry crouches next to Teddy, gently brushing away the dirt on his cheek, “I have to run to the Ministry for a bit. Do you mind staying here with Draco till then?”
Teddy nods, pointing in the vague direction of the living room where he’d dumped his things earlier. The
The only person who looks they’re having fun is Luna. She’s been chatting with Malfoy non-stop, ever since the moment she walked into the pub with the git in tow, ignoring everyone’s shocked expressions and, in Dean’s case, barely whispered mumblings of displeasure.
Draco scowls at his best friend, “Shut up, he’s not my boyfriend.”
I intend to rectify that now.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
He takes his time changing, smiling every time he hears a giggle from the bed and Harry’s immediate futile attempts at shushing.
He doesn’t even have to think.
The lift shudders and groans, making Draco nervously glance around them, wondering if this is how it really ends for him. He only let’s go of his tight grip on the handrail when the lift stutters to a stop, doors opening with a loud clang and an announcement—
“The Auror Program,” Draco explained slowly, feeling the letter crumple in his fist. “You’ve thought about applying?”
(So much for not regressing back to his teen years.)
Harry shrugs. “Not really but I can’t think of any other reason why you wouldn’t want to come in.”
Draco’s determined nod against his shoulder is all the answer he needs.
Life gets a little stirred up.
He leaves reluctantly, glancing back at the structure even as he rounds the corner of the maze. He hopes it’s still there when he comes back.
“You’re laughing at me.”
“So . . . “ Harry trails off, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. He knows what he wants to do but he’s still so scared of taking a wrong step and ending up all alone.
Harry smiles. “Look at you, toeing the line.”
She leaves soon after, not wanting to be late for her dinner plans. After checking in on Teddy, who is busy playing with his collapsible replica of Hogwarts (
Harry doesn’t let of Draco’s hand as they walk back home.
Even though it's only been a few minutes since he met Malfoy, talked to him face to face, Harry feels wrung out, his head spinning. It reminds him of the trip to the Ministry through the pipes, the spinning ride that left you dizzy.
He runs into Malfoy and Scorpius on the path towards their houses.
“Harry,” Hermione whines, linking their arms together, “I’m sorry, I got caught up in some work that came in at the last minute and -”
Harry smiles against Draco’s cheek. “In that case . . . “
of any reaction. Throughout Hermione’s interrogation, he had remained silent, not demanding answers or insulting Draco.
to chuckle at the irony), adding a warmth to the room is the roaring fire in the fireplace. It’s very different from what Harry would have expected Malfoy’s house to look like.
I sit back on my heels and look at him, taking in his slim legs, his tapered waist that still has bruises from last night and his back slightly damped in sweat. I want to taste every inch of his body.
“Isn’t that why you’re here?”
He knocks once, fixes his tie and flatten his hair. The door opens and he’s face to face to with his one time nemesis after six years.
Scorpius looks awed, and Harry vows to take him to meet Mrs Figg when he can.
“I didn’t then,” Harry continues hurriedly. “I thought if I’d already put in so much time, I might as well see it all the way through. Then a few months later they started talking about placements and teams we’d like to be a part of, and honestly, none of them appealed to me. That was it then.”
Another filler chapter, sorry! Tomorrow will make up for it. ♥
Later they’ll tell everyone else. For now though, at this moment, Draco is content.
“Hi,” he says softly, looking over Draco. He’s slumped in the chair, his hair messy and cheeks flushed. He has one hand on his stomach, stroking over his shirt; Harry smiles when Draco looks at him, his eyes bright as he breathes a sigh of relief.
Harry turns a little, aware of everyone around the table trying not to listen in. Draco looks tired, dark circles stark against his pale complexion, his cheekbones more pronounced as a result of all the missed meals. Harry knows he can’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do but he decides then and there to be more forceful when Draco wants to skip a meal.
“I used to have them every night,” Harry continues, aware that Malfoy is listening, “and I would wake each night terrified that I was back in the room. I could almost feel the heat of the fire on my skin, a heat so searing that I was convinced it was going to burn everything.”
“Draco Malfoy, I -”
It comes to a head about two days before they’re scheduled to head back home.
Draco skidded to a stop next to him, huffing as he tried to catch his breath, all the while staring at the other in concern. He looked pale, deep dark shadows pooling under his glossy eyes as he blinked in confusion.
“Harry, I don - oh,
He can see Hermione frown as she shakes her head. “No, nothing at all.”
He can only stare from his spot in front of his door as Malfoy walks around his living room, the wide windows giving Harry a glimpse into the room. Malfoy is smiling, his sleeves rolled up his arms as he carries a mug to a spot across the room, too far away for Harry to see. He’s ready to give up and chalk it off to a tiring day at the Ministy and his mind playing tricks when Malfoy walks back in front of the windows, heading towards what’s presumably the kitchen if their houses are planned the same way.
“Which one -”
Potter mumbled something into his scarf, making Draco frown and ask, “I’m sorry, what?”
“I’ll buy you two more,” Blaise placates him, swinging his legs as he takes in Draco’s office. Though office is a misnomer perhaps, it’s nothing more than a glorified storage room. There are towering piles of boxes, balanced precariously against each other. Scrolls upon scrolls of aging parchments can be found in every corner of the room. The only clear space in the room is the path from the door to Draco’s chair. Dressed in his expensive tailored suit, Draco knows he stands out amongst the piles of dusty old scrolls, the musty smell now a permanent feature of the room. But for the first time in his life he’s feeling like he’s where he belongs, there’s a sense of satisfaction in his job that he’s never experienced before and for now, that’s enough.
“You know,” Hermione says, finally done with giving her order, “we are actually quite near Harry’s house.”
stinky.”
“Err,” Malfoy stammers, a blush staining his cheeks, “I . . . Potter, I was thinking of trying something new today.”
“Your house is lovely,” Draco compliments, handing over his coat with a thanks. He’s not just saying it to be polite; her house truly is beautiful. With dark woods and deep jewel tones, it’s a cosy yet chic space, the candles and muted lamps giving everything a soft glow.
Blaise waves to the barkeep. “Two more! And keep ‘em coming!”
I had
idea what to do with today's picture prompt and clearly my brain can't come up with simple alternatives.
“Where is she these days?” Harry asks, helping himself to a chocolate frog when Scorpius offers. He almost gives in when Scorpius asks if Loki can also have one, but one look at Draco’s expression and Harry shakes his head.
“Well, what did you think would happen? I told you we were going to play poker with the Slytherins.”
“Oh my God, I’m going to die.”
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the flush that rises on Malfoy’s cheeks when he’s angry or the adorable twitch of his nose when he’s trying to rein in his temper.
“I still have four days,” he complained, rolling over and propping his head up on one arm. “Say, Draco, what are you doing after graduation?”
“Good decision, otherwise you’d still be stuck with that umbrella stand.”
Draco clenches his fists and shakes his head. “Hello, Pansy. Are you going to be joining us today?”
can you be pregnant?”
Draco’s scowling now, glaring at the slowly changing numbers as the lift seems to take even longer to reach the Atrium.
The first date.
It’s only after Harry’s back home, in bed, that he realises they completely veered off course and he’s learnt nothing about why Malfoy’s back.
changed. The Draco he is today is so startlingly different from the Draco he was then.
It’s been two days and he still can’t get over the fact that Malfoy is his neighbour. Out of all the possibilities in the world, he never expected this to be how he would run into Malfoy again.
I have NO idea what this is, omg. I just saw the prompt and this is what my brain came up with.
Six days prior to the most important day of his life Harry has no option but to face the fact that being around Malfoy makes him regress back into a petty and scowling version of himself. It’s not a realisation  he’s proud off but at least he has the capability to accept his shortcomings. Malfoy on the other hand, does not take it very kindly when Harry points out all his faults.
He laughs, walking back towards Draco with Scorpius in his arms. “I caught him as he was making a run for it. What did he do this time? Steal the fancy silverware again?”
night.
We've reached the halfway point! Yay! Thank you to everyone who has been keeping up with the story - all your comments and kudos make me smile! Thank you. ♥
“Do you surrender?”
Gone is the old ornate dining table meant to seat entire wizarding households; in its place is a slightly less
Harry would have given him anything but apparently Malfoy is made of sterner stuff as he shakes his head.
The thing is, Harry knows that Teddy and Scorpius have always got along before. Draco has taken Scorpius with him to the occasional family lunch and he has it on good authority that Scorpius has always been the perfect little boy.
“That was delicious.” Harry isn’t even just saying that to be a good guest, it
Deciding to move hadn’t been a split second decision, ever since Ron and Hermione had moved, Grimmauld Place had started feeling less like home than before. The house is still his, empty and gathering dust but he doesn’t think he’s ready to sell it off yet. There are too many memories attached to that house for him to just let go of it.
Scorpius frowns, thinking about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two house-elves hanging around his periphery added to his discomfort. He knew them, had grown up seeing them around the Manor, but the thought of them relying on him for directions and order as the Malfoy Heir was more than he could handle right then.
Grabbing treats from the bowl under the window, Draco slides it open to gently take the letter tied around his left leg. Ignoring the treats placed in front of him, Maximus nudges Draco’s fingers with his beak till he’s rewarded with a chuckle and light scratches across the back. “Greedy little thing, aren’t you,” Draco murmurs fondly, giving Maximus his required dose of attention before pushing the treats forward. “Eat up.”
“Oh my God.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco coos, softly brushing away the tears pooling under Harry’s lovely eyes. Harry catches his hand before he can pull away, bringing it up to his mouth to press a lingering kiss before grasping it tightly.
So he started visiting him, often doing nothing more than strolling along the shoreline, shivering as the cooler air from over the water blew over. Most days, Potter ignored him, getting there long before Draco did and continuing to jog long after Draco left. Some days he felt like he should speak up, say something to get Potter to stop for a bit, catch his breath maybe. But every time he tried the words would get lost under years of
The classroom was almost barren, save for a few broken desks that he’d spent the first night piling into the corner. He hadn’t planned on coming back, satisfied that he’d somewhat attempted to clear things out before moving on to his nightly excursions around the castle. The next night, however, he found himself once again carefully climbing across the rubble strewn along the corridor to enter the classroom.
late today.”
“What would people say?”
Rolling his eyes Teddy leaves the war zone and concentrates on helping Scorpius finish the snowman they started earlier, realising he won’t get now any answer from Harry.
“. . . and then she started complaining about how we don’t have enough time for each other these days.”
Curious, he grabs his wand and heads outside, the midday sun pleasantly warm. Within minutes he’s at the maze, walking around it to reach the other end. As he turns the corner, he raises a hand to block the direct sunlight and squints through the glare.
Harry nods. He doesn’t know why or how but everything is awkward now and he’s missing their earlier ease with an ache.
Draco rushed in right after, carefully placing all the pots in his arms on one of the window ledges. He shook his arms out, a wave of sharp pain ran up and down due to the combined weight of all the heavy pots.
Harry stops at the door to the living room and takes in the sight in front of him. Draco is on the couch, trying not to direct Teddy and Scorpius on the
“We can fix this.”
“Mr Malfoy,” she shakes his hand, grip warm, “thank you for accepting our request. I’m Madeline Hanes, Director at the Office of Forensics.”
“-trust me, if it was up to me, I wouldn’t be here  either,” Malfoy goes on, ignoring Harry, “but Luna is the only one in the office  who’s decent to me and she’s actually okay to work with. So when she asked, more like insisted, that I accompany her, I couldn’t really say no.”
“What made you pick Forensics?” Draco asks, curious.
Draco smirks at him from the sofa, carefully marking his page and closing the book he was reading.
.” By the end of it Draco was almost shouting, his voice echoed across the empty hallway behind him.
For Day#2 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
Malfoy smiles at him, his hair tousled from the wind and cheeks flushed from the cold.
She looks young, auburn hair hanging loose over her shoulders.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I don’t and I’ll prove it to you. I’m going home with someone else tonight because that’s what you do with fuck buddies.”
“When you started acting like an idiot,” Blaise states simply. Assured of his win, he fixes his tie and walks forward, placing an arm around Draco’s shoulders and steering him towards the door, “We’re young and beautiful only once, why not make the most of it?”
“‘Fraid so,” Harry says solemnly. “Though,” Harry continues, leaning forward till he’s almost nose to nose with Draco before saying, “I can make it worth your while.”
He had accompanied her to the Emporium, and just like the last time she had gone looking for a pet, she had fallen for the one owl that had refused to co-operate, had stubbornly looked the other way as she tried to talk to it and had almost bitten Harry’s finger off. Athena was still a stubborn thing but Hermione adored her and she had almost stopped biting Harry now. As long as he kept the supply of owl treats going.
“Would you like to stay for dinner, Potter?” Malfoy asks; he’s looking at Harry with a calculating expression, as if he’s waiting for something from Harry.
Disbelief smells like burnt chicken and cheap wine.
Christmas morning!
“I guess I should start from the beginning . . . “
Draco rolls his eyes. Smiles.
Draco is across from the bed, both hands wrapped around a steaming cup as he gazes out the window. He's wearing one of Harry's favorite outfits, besides Draco being entirely devoid of clothing of course. The stark white shirt is creased and only halfway buttoned but Draco makes even that look elegant, one collar dragging across his collar bone and almost falling off the shoulder. He's lost in thought, the shadow of a smile ghosting across his lips, his sharp jawline in contrast to the slight morning puffiness of his cheeks.
The park isn’t far from the Ministry office he works out of, the auxiliary departments spread across the city and connected to the main location through a cleverly designed system of Floo’s and what look like comfier versions of the Gringott’s carts. It had been a move deemed necessary after the war as the Ministry expanded, with departments growing the old location had started getting a little cramped.
“Mr. Potter.”
“Oh.”
"What?" Draco asks, he looks scared and Harry feels horrible.
Harry stops his fidgeting as Malfoy looks up to meet his eyes. Through the hum of the crowded pub, he has to strain a little to hear him. "Maybe," Malfoy starts, hesitating a little but never breaking eye contact, "one day?"
Draco jumped, shaken out of his stupor as Potter fidgeted a little, curling deeper under the blanket before he settled down again. He shook himself, glared at the sleeping boy for distracting him before forcing himself to go back to learning about Hubert’s boring law of useless things.
He is already wondering if he’ll regret the offer.
himself here, as a part of this little family, loving these two boys.
For Day#21 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
“It’s Granger-Weasley actually,” Hermione corrects softly.
His first attempt, cooking Scorpius breakfast, is met with a shattered plate and porridge on the floor.
“Octavius!”
“Shut up, Harry.”
Harry deliberately runs his hands through his hair at that, messing it up further. Draco’s snort is turned into a yelp when Harry all but dives into bed, curling up close with his head on Draco’s pillow.
He’s almost asleep when he feels the covers shift and Malfoy’s leg brush against his. He hides his smile in the pillow and drifts off to the sound of Malfoy’s steady breathing.
“Hi.” Harry smiles against Draco’s lips, one hand working it’s way under Draco’s shirt to,
- I loved interacting with all of you everyday! I'm really going to miss that.
Draco released his hold on the letter, smoothing it out a little.
Harry smirks. “Then I should check him too?”
Just five days before the biggest realisation of his life, Malfoy compliments Harry for the first time.
“I’m pretty sure it was our fourth date? When we attended Brown’s engagement ceremony?”
“Teddy, love, we can’t hear you,” Draco speaks into his hair, making Teddy whine, but he finally looks up. Draco coos at the tear-streaked face, using a sleeve to wipe his face.
He is
“Potter.”
at home.”
“I made you some tea.”
He didn’t even want to entertain the thought of having to go back to the dorms; he’d rather go live out in Hagrid’s hut with his slobbering beast of a dog.
It didn’t change the fact that he felt devastatingly alone (abandoned).
Curiosity sated, Draco was about to make a hasty and quiet retreat when he managed to accidentally kick a stray pebble. The sound was enough to jerk Potter out of whatever frame of mind he was in, the boy spinning on his heel, his wand out before Draco could quirk an eyebrow in surprise.
Where Harry meets Mrs. Malfoy and he sort of, kind of, maybe . . . gets her blessing.
Teddy is still lost in slumber, the covers pushed down to the foot of the bed. Draco straightens his arm with a smile and tucks him back under the warm blanket. He can sleep in yet, it’s still early enough that the toddler can get a few more hours. Draco would love to sleep more too but he’s been feeling a little queasy, he hopes the anti-nausea potion will kick in soon because he’s
As Draco leans closer Harry feels the rest of the room melt away, the centre of his entire focus is only Draco. They kiss briefly, yet it feels like an entire eternity. As they move apart, Harry's arm around Draco's waist to hold him close, it's only the thought of most of their friends being in the room with them that keeps Harry from leaning back in.
Draco shakes his head and seals off his room, giving one last lingering glance to the open scroll on his table. But before he can change his mind, Blaise is herding him towards the lifts, steering past lingering Ministry workers who are taking their time to walk along the corridor.
Harry waits, aware that Draco’s not done.
“Is someone in your room or…?”
Harry is waiting for him at the bottom of the steps, eyes fond as he waves at the couple. The nearest Apparition point is a little way from their house, a perk of living in a Muggle neighbourhood. Harry offered to walk down together and Draco was quick to say yes.
Harry hums thoughtfully. “It’s a newer office, you know. They had only started putting together the team when Madeline reached out to me. She was an instructor for the Trainee Program and thought I’d be a good fit. It seemed different enough that it excited me and I could also use everything I’d learned so it didn’t go to waste.”
“Go out with me.”
Harry shoots him a grateful smile, he really is exhausted, and starts retelling the story of the time when Ron, Hermione and  he stole a dragon from Gringotts.
Within a month, they had a routine down. Potter would show up some time after dinner, homework in hand. They would work in comfortable silence for a few hours, a soulful ballad streaming from the wireless and the crackling of the flames, a nifty addition by Granger, the only backdrop.
“His mother was one,” Harry says softly, lightly brushing back the child’s hair. He no longer seems upset, once again looking around them, eyes filled with curiosity. “Andromeda mentioned Tonks’s abilities also manifested this early.”
“Absolutely not,” Draco cuts her off with a chuckle, leading her towards the sofa. “He’s not a bother at all, and I know Harry’s been missing him something fierce.”
For Day#17 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
“I’m sorry about last night,” Malfoy starts, staring down at his tea like it holds the answers to the universe.
Harry presses a soft kiss along Draco's cheek, smiling as he feels Draco melt against him.
Draco feels his breath catch, the voice so inherently familiar yet feeling different, the tone deeper than he remembered.
If Harry hadn’t been leaning against Draco, he wouldn’t have heard the whispered question, an unspoken fear they’ve both been thinking about.
The sombre mood is broken by Teddy’s excited shriek. He’s pointing a chubby little finger towards their left, at one of the peacocks that is staring back at them just as curiously.
Harry shakes his head, grasping onto Draco’s hand when he moves.
He can’t resist grabbing the tin of ginger cookies that he’d picked up on his way from work. Made at a bakery not too far from St. Mungos, Draco has had the most intense cravings for them. To the extent that, rather than Floo’ing back home directly from work, he takes the time to walk to the bakery, stand in line with the rush hour crowd craving a coffee after work, just to pick up a tin (
way to unwrap gifts. Teddy is showing Scorpius the new model Quidditch Set that his Uncle Ron gifted him while Scorpius tries on his Weasley sweater.
“Potter!”
“Not really, no, he can’t.”
“Who is this Thomas Wolfe?” he asked instead, trying to take it one step at a time.
By the time the sun starts to set, he already has a stretch of land near the eastern wall cleared out for his use, the conditions perfect for him to run his experiments.
He knows he’s cutting it close, the hour inching closer to four faster than he’d prefer. He also knows if he puts this report off for tomorrow, he’ll regret it even more than having to listen to Hermione berate him for keeping his date waiting. Besides, it's not the first blind date she's set him up on and going by his success rate so far he has a feeling it won't be the last.
. . .
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“I can see that.” Malfoy’s lips twitch, his eyes wide as he takes in the mess in the kitchen. The puppy is almost purring in his lap as Malfoy scritches under his neck, making his tiny body wiggle.
“I don’t know what’s wrong, he just won’t tell me anything,” Draco sighs, anguish peeking through his confusion. Scorpius has never shut him out like this before.
"Stay?" he asks, fingers tapping an unknown melody along Draco's waist.
Blaise lets go, but stands between Draco and the table, his arms crossed and hips cocked, “Friday nights are ours, Draco. It’s tradition and you don’t mess with tradition.”
Draco had absolutely no intention of mentioning his room or the fact that he had been unintentionally spying on Potter. He opted for the safer, “I was out for a walk.”
Draco shuffled the larger pile of parchment towards Harry, ignoring the affronted expression thrown his way. He leaned back against the sofa, lazily waving his wand to start piling the cushions against the wall. It was as he was staring at the growing pile with concern,
struggling to find another word here, but the fact is that Malfoy looks adorable. His eyes are scrunched against the weak light, one fist coming up to rub out the sleep, the usually well slicked hair is messy and falling all over his face.
“Three shots of the best tequila you’ve got!” she shouts over the music.
I turn to my side to face him and focus all my attention on his breaths, the steady in and out of air that makes his rib cage expand and contract. He’s on his stomach, facing away from me, and I can almost count the knobs of his spine as he breathes. But as the lingering hold of terror fades away, I can feel another emotion creeping up my spine.
Harry is glad he didn’t have the cup of tea in his hand then, he is sure he would have dropped it had that been the case. He knows wizards can get pregnant, the baby shower he had attended for Seamus and Dean’s son was enough proof of that, but the fact that Malfoy carried Scorpius had never even occurred to him.
