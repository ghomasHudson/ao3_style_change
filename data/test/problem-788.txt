Fake-Draco swore and steadied himself at the window sill. He clasped his head and turned away, bent over.
He looked at Draco. The guy seemed less upset than before, his grey eyes were fondly watching Cass and if Harry wasn’t completely mistaken, Draco seemed to be as relieved to see her making friends as Harry himself.
Harry teared his eyes away and forced himself to check the other first-floor windows. The one to the left had similar curtains and the same flickering light shone through them – so this must be the sitting room’s second window, which was closed as well. Carefully Harry flew to the third window on this floor. No curtains and darkness behind – this one seemed to belong to another room, maybe a chamber next to the sitting room?
He gave Harry a derogatory look. “Still it made perfect sense that you should own the Hollows. Everybody knows about your cloak, a heritage from your father. You yourself told the story of the Elder Wand during your final battle with the Dark Lord and dozens of people saw the Deathstick fly willingly into your hand. Yet you don’t use it – obviously.” He nodded at Harry’s wand which lay on the floor in front of Harry, same as his invisibility cloak.
“Seriously?” Harry grinned. “So you don’t think Flitwick, Kingsley and Josh will make much of a difference?”
“It seems you require some help, darling?” fake-Draco smirked. “Well, I will show you a clue.” He took something out of his pocket, a small object, and pointed his wand at it. The tiny thing floated through the air until it hovered right in front of Harry’s eyes.
Harry felt sick. He had not been as desperate and powerless since that horrible night at Malfoy Manor. Suddenly he had a vivid flashback of Hermione’s voice, crying in agony. His stomach rose and he retched.
“Thank’s, that’s very kind – but I don’t want to bother you…” Harry said but his stomach had other plans and rumbled audibly.
“Sorry, Headmistress, I actually came to talk about something else – another matter… if you could spare just a minute? Or shall we talk after dinner?” he asked.
“I trust you completely, all three of you, that’s why I’m telling you in advance. I know that none of you is hiding a trap painting. But… if you happen to have made some changes to your rooms, which you do not want to be known about, it might be wise to remove them for tomorrow night.”
“But of course she can talk!” he said eagerly. “Professor Flitwick, I think we have made a major mistake… the way we were trying to get the naked lady to talk!”
“Oh, Master Harry Potter Sir! Very dirty, the noble house was, so very very dirty! But now is clean! Kreacher scrubbed every room of course! Master’s fine house would be in much better state, if Kreacher were allowed to take care of Master’s household!” Kreacher stared accusingly at Harry.
“Well, Mr Dumbledore… the Headmistress agreed that I inform you but you have to understand this is highly confidential. Your brother’s Imagic is missing and we have no clue where he is. He was most certainly abducted while all the paintings of Hogwarts were at the Ministry Archives last summer.”
McGonagall raised one eye-brow and asked, “So, Mr Potter– those ‘others’ you didn’t want to incriminate, that would be Draco Malfoy, I assume?”
Ron and Harry both paled a little before Ron said, “Don’t be daft Hermione. Everyone knows Josh is playing for the other team. Well, everybody but Pansy Parkinson. You remember that day she saw a picture of Josh in the Prophet and declared, Josh to be the only Hufflepuff, she would consider dating, if he asked her out? That girl is beyond ignorant.”
“Come on Ron – surely it’s not that bad!” Harry said with a grin. After the initial shock of having his surrogate mother as a teacher –Molly nagged at him nearly as much as at her children– Harry decided to be damn proud of her.
“Good morning, Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy,” Severus Snape’s Imagic said, looking from Harry to Draco with raised eyebrows as they returned his greetings. He seemed to absorb their appearances, Draco fully dressed and Harry in his usual unkempt way still wearing sweat-pants. “Up already on a Saturday? I never would have guessed that students are able to rise at such an early hour. And I must say I’m mildly surprised the two of you amiably enjoy early morning tea together.”
“That is why I went to Edinburgh before returning to Hogwarts, to talk to Philomella in person. Of course I didn’t tell her anything about Dumbledore’s missing Imagic. I just wanted to ask her opinion on Draco’s behaviour, whether she believes him to be truly reformed and regretful concerning his past. She is quite convinced his remorse is genuine and heartfelt.”
Draco flushed once more and for a split second Harry expected him to explode with anger. But then a miracle of sorts happened: Draco’s mouth turned into a lopsided grin and he cleared his throat. “Whatever, Potter,” he said, turning his attention back to the book.
“Yeah, the Auror department seems to be pretty secretive about their working tools, if even Hermione Granger has never stumbled across their spells,” Ron teased his girlfriend.
“That’s about the last thing I remember from that night. When I woke up next morning, I felt sick and had a terrible headache, couldn’t remember a single face from the guests – but otherwise I was unharmed.
As soon as Hermione heard about Harry’s afternoon appointment with the Headmistress she insisted on doing homework right after breakfast.
“But Transfig’ is a really tough one! So you are brilliant indeed,” Harry laughed. “You remind me of one of my friends – she’s never satisfied with anything but an Outstanding too.”
“Well, well, Mr Dumbledore, that’s quite enough talking for now,” Madame Pomfrey interrupted. “You’ve just made an exhausting apparition and need to rest. If you want to get as well as Mr Potter here, who’s ready to leave my ward, you better do what I tell you, alright?”
He was well aware that this was the first time he told someone outside of the circle of his closest friends. It was quite surprising that nobody had spilled the beans up until today, not even Draco Malfoy who surely must have received the message from Cass by now. But Harry did not want to keep his sexual identity a secret anyway and to tell another queer guy seemed like the easiest way to spread the news. Especially now, with Cass’ motto for the ball and the increased awareness of staff and students alike.
And there she was, sitting on a wraught iron chair between the mighty pillars of the front porch. As soon as she saw them walking towards the building she rose and approached them.
“Pity, Malfoy’s in the clear, he’d make such a good suspect,” Ron grinned, “though I have to say, he’s mostly okay these days, sometimes even entertaining in his deadpan way.”
!’ when spilling his milk. For the kid who had felt ugly in Dudley’s old clothes and scared in the dark of his cupboard. For all those years he had felt unwelcome, unloved and alone.
“Glad you like it,” Josh grinned and then asked, “What happened to your hair? It’s not raining outside, is it?”
Hermione blushed but looked rather pleased. “Really, did she? Oh well. I’ll better take the whole thing back to my room anyway – do you think it’s possible to take a copy of the copy?” she mused.
“Thanks, I’ll take credit for that. If it were up to Frank, the girls – they’re Arwen and Eowyn by the way – would be totally spoiled. Well, what else is to be expected from a vet!” Odie snorted.
“I hope your new owl is well behaved, Mr Potter?” her skill for small-talk seemed to kick in, “Otto, I believe, you call him? Do you find him useful?”
All of them scrambled to their feet and then silence fell over the hall. Harry closed his eyes. Faces of lost friends and family members were crossing his mind and he felt a lump in his throat. Dumbledore and Snape, Tonks and Lupin, Fred and Sirius, his mother and his father… the stream of faces seemed endless and Harry gulped down his pain.
Harry stared at him incredulously – and was immensely relieved when Draco winked at him and the others grinned. He assumed that everybody around the table knew exactly what Harry and Draco would be up to as soon as the door closed behind their hosts.
“No, they would not do, Harry,” Minerva McGonagall shook her head. ”Pictures taken by a magical camera have only a hint of charms in them. Such pictures might move a bit, but people in them will never talk or be able to leave the picture. It’ll take the Highly Advanced Charms of true Magical Arts to create an Imagic, who will contain some sort of spirit of the real person. Only Imagics are able to move freely between their portraits or to visit other magical paintings within the same building.”
Harry was secretly delighted that the House-elf dared to ask for something – if only for permission to do some more work. Well, it was probably a good idea to check the house from time to time. Maybe he should consider sending Kreacher back to London once a month, Harry mused.
Harry nodded. “So someone set you up very cleverly indeed… they expected you to do just that… to hide the painting and not being aware of trapped Imagics. The question is – who might have done this to you? Any idea?”
“Hi, Hagrid – good to see you again,” mumbled Harry pressed against Hagrid’s chest by the full force of a bear-hug.
The painting in question showed a lady’s boudoir. A fancy lady’s boudoir, by the look of it. With purple draperies and a pink carpet the room looked like a nineteenth-century brothel. At the front of the room a black poodle was fast asleep resting on an old-fashioned chaise longue. The small dog was curled up and one of his ears was twitching. A vanity full of tiny bottles and boxes stood right beside the chaise longue, several large vases fudll of red roses and lilies were placed all over the room.
“Yeah, that would be one way of dealing with the situation… but what if Laddley simply denies that he ever said something like that and then it’s Tommy’s word against a teacher’s? And we don’t want to involve other kids by asking them to confirm what they might have heard.”
Harry and his friends turned around and saw Blaise walking the corridor towards them. Harry was horrified to see, that Draco was at his side, face flushed and looking annoyed as hell.
“What about Potions? You always said I’m rubbish at Potions?” Cass was obviously relieved that Draco finally joined their conversation.
sneak off! I just wanted to make an early start and did not want to disturb your lovers’ bliss in the morning!” Harry argued. He looked around what was apparently still just Ron’s bedroom. “Huh, you didn’t connect your rooms again? I really liked your apartment,” he said as a peace offering.
“No, Daisy, of course not!” Harry was shocked, “Strolling around all alone could well be dangerous for you! Actually I’m reluctant to ask you for any favour at all – but at least you’ve got Pinkie to watch over you… so here’s what I want you to do – please alert Headmaster Snape about the Fat Lady’s disappearance. Go directly to his portrait and come straight back, do you hear me? No detours!”
When Hermione’s hand shot up, Harry feared for having hallucinations – until he realized, that she was merely holding up Ron’s arm.
“Exactly!” Harry looked around beaming. Everybody seemed to be just as pleased by this idea as Harry himself. Everybody but Snape.
She regarded Laddley with much concern. “Hating any of our fellow human beings will not only eventually hurt others but the hater as well. Hate is a very heavy burden nobody needs to carry. It might be very relieving to share your burden by talking about it. I should be very glad, should you be ready to recover – but I cannot force you of course.” McGonagall paused and drew a golden watch from the pocket of her robe. “You have twenty-four hours to consider your options, Professor Laddley. I want you in my office tomorrow at six p.m. right before dinner to hear your decision. Your lessons are cancelled forthwith and you may not leave the castle until then. That is all for now, thank you.”
“The Room of Requirements has not been rebuilt either,” Harry said, “and that’s where the passage ended.”
“Yeah, the ball,” Hermione sighed, “I can’t believe they did not cancel the ball after what happened last Saturday. I think this is a tremendous security risk.”
“Listen...” Harry’s voice was throaty, ”Oh for fuck’s sake! Obviously I don’t have time right now but… I guess we need to talk?”
Draco Malfoy just snorted, but Cass said, “You are such a macho, Blaise, I hope you’ll fall hard for that girl, before she dumps you.”
“Professor Laddley, please go ahead without us and… would you be so kind as to ask Professor Flitwick to start dinner? You can tell him Mr Potter and I have urgent business to attend to.” And with a fierce nod she sent Laddley on his way, who hurried down the corridor without further comment.
“But that’s only a matter of days now, right? Hermione, Harry thinks he might be ready to fly this weekend – isn’t that great?”
“So… if the library is in love with Hermione,” Harry thought this sounded extremely weird even by the standards of Hogwarts’ world of wonders, “what’s that supposed to mean? Besides Hermione’s ability to summon books? I mean… she has a boyfriend – will the library be… jealous of Ron?”
“Not a chance, Potter. If you are so bored, get a book of your own. I certainly will not share mine,” he snorted.
“One of you has to fetch the next round,” Harry told Neville and Seamus, nodding towards the bar, “that guy is scary.”
He silently bemoaned that he had insisted on Draco going into hiding – what ill advice he had given him! Harry ran his fingers through his hair in desperation when suddenly he was startled by a soft noise at the window.
Other students (but no Draco) came and went all morning, while Harry, Hermione and Ron kept busy scribbling their Transfiguration essays. Finally all of the other students had left for lunch, the three of them had finished their home-work at long last and were packing away their quills and parchments. Ron’s rumbling stomach gave proof, that lunch was well overdue. Still, Ron did not complain which was highly unusual in itself.
“Well…” Carter looked deeply uncomfortable, “I guess I’ll go back to my friends… have a nice evening, Harry, Draco…” He nodded and was gone.
Blaise puffed up, “For want of better entertainment of course! It’s a shame Chastity is not related to any of you lot…” He sighed.
“ – honestly, with all the sadness and loss, it’s so important to focus on good news once in a while, and Harry having an owl again, that’s good news!” Hermione continued.
“They always go to the beach on Friday night together and come back before midnight,” Headmaster Black explained gazing at Harry wide-eyed, “they are never late!”
“Don’t tell me you started fighting again,” Ginny said looking disappointed. “I so hoped your fights from former years were gone for good.”
“Be assured I have no illusions about the communication skills taught at Hogwarts, Mr Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy still seemed outraged, “I remember well enough how Slytherins and Griffindors treat each other – even the teachers. Well this is my house and I will tolerate no such nonsense here.” She turned to her son and said, “Draco, you know very well, what I expect to hear from you.”
“I know that,” Ginny said giving him an impatient look, “I’ll only use the girls’ showers. Just don’t want to enter the castle looking like an ogre… seems like cleaning spells don’t work properly on Highland Games’ dirt.” Looking around she blew her hair out of her face and asked, “Where’s Draco? Didn’t he join today’s swimming class?”
“Don’t be absurd, Severus,” Flitwick protested, “I have created several Imagics and my soul is perfectly intact!”
“You might want to reconsider, Potter. Ballet with Slughorn could do even greater wonders to your posture,” Draco Malfoy said smirking at Harry to everybody’s amusement. Harry pulled a face. Well, he was ready to bear some teasing as long as Malfoy kept his tone light.
“Who says this investigation isn’t a work of love?” Hermione said and to Harry’s utter embarrassment she winked at him.
Right after lunch the Headmistress asked Harry to attend another investigation meeting in her sitting room and to bring Ron and Hermione along. His friends had never been to the Headmistress’ private quarters before and were thoroughly impressed by the spacious room with its paintings and magnificent view.
“That’s exactly why Harry and I are going to be superb Aurors, while you, my dear, will have a boring desk job at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” Ron grinned. “But don’t you worry, I’ll love you nonetheless.”
“That’s a good birdie!” Daisy said lovingly to the bird and patted his head. “Professor Flitwick created him only a few days ago, so Pinkie is still a baby. I have wanted a pet for a century and now I have the loveliest companion ever – he’s such a darling, don’t you think?”
“Good night, Harry,” Hermione whispered and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek. “And there’s something else… Mrs Malfoy says she’s sorry for not saying properly good-bye but she hopes to see you and Draco soon and… she wants you to have this –,“ she pulled something out of her beaded bag, a longish item wrapped in a cloth of grey silk.
The thought of a tiny Draco who loved to play in this cosy little building amused Harry. He smirked at Ginny who grinned back.
As if he could read Harry’s mind, fake-Draco continued, “In case you are waiting for some back-up, darling, you will be terribly disappointed to hear that the letter I sent you was self-igniting. It burst into flames a few minutes after you read it. Wherever you left it, it’ll be nothing more than a small mound of ashes by now.”
“I am sorry, Molly.” Harry said softly. “You are probably right. I was… afraid, I guess? I never presumed you might have a problem with homosexuality, not when you’re Charlie’s parents! But… I feared you would be prejudiced against Draco. Hell, why wouldn’t you? When I myself complained about him and told everybody how much I hated him forever!”
“Fine,” Harry said. “So let’s pretend you’re Draco Malfoy. I’ve got other questions as well. Like… where’s Aberforth? Did you kill him?”
He drew his eyes away from Malfoy’s smiling face with some force and sipped at his tea… but nearly spilled his drink, when Draco suddenly said, “Maybe I’ll ask you to dance at the ball – only if I like your Halloween costume, of course.”
They looked at each other and Harry grinned, “What a relief to find out, we do not agree after all…” He turned to Cass and added, “I just think it’s risky for any two people, whether witches or wizards, makes no difference to me. But if you were a group of three – let’s say, if Hermione were to accompany you…”
“Hermione’s right, I get it,” said Ginny, “look, all of the first year students share one table – so we are seated according to our age group, our year! I just wonder, why there are not eight tables but only seven?”
“Well, you will surely remember the night of the Great Battle of Hogwarts? When Lord Voldemort attempted to kill you in the thick of the forest but both of you passed out? We were all shocked. But as soon as the Dark Lord regained consciousness and Narcissa declared you dead, most of the Death Eaters were ready to believe that victory was still possible. Alas I was not fooled so easily… that is why I trailed behind. While the others approached the castle, I started to search the ground.”
Harry was perplexed. Could it be true that Draco thought him, Harry, handsome? That he was concerned about Harry’s wellbeing? What was that supposed to mean? And what about Draco’s crush on Ginny? Harry shook his head and grinned back.
he thought, being well aware that any such hint might not have been received kindly. He laughed too and –feeling bold– reached for Draco’s hand.
While walking upstairs behind Headauror and Headmistress, Hermione fell back and pulled at Harry’s sleeve, “For the love of magic, what is going on, Harry?” she whispered urgently, “You’re play-acting, right? I don’t believe for a second that you are not concerned about Draco’s situation!”
Harry felt embarrassed enough without Draco Malfoy’s obvious glee about that intimate piece of information. He just wanted to get out of that suffocating compartment and was more than relieved to see the familiar lights of Hogsmeade train station approaching fast.
“Draco Malfoy has been a favourite student of mine for years. And not because of his family’s fortune or influence, but because he has been a very unhappy young man… unhappy in many ways,” Snape looked grave, “I know the pains of unrequited love.”
Now he put on his kilt, a crisp white shirt, black stockings and an emerald jacket. He was quite proud of his very own tartan, which he had designed using dark green, black and a fine strip of Gryffindor-red. Finally he suspended a black leather sporran at the front of his belt and –after a moment of hesitation– he not only put his wand in there but also his invisibility cloak.
“No, Harry. No you don’t, believe me. I am your worst idea ever.” Draco got up and left without another look at Harry.
“Indeed why not?” Draco shook his head and his voice was hoarse when he continued, “Why not? For a thousand reasons. Because I’m a mess. Because you deserve much better. Because I would ruin your life. Because I’m a reformed Death Eater on probation. Because you’re the best person in the world. Because you don’t need me. Because staying away is the best thing I can do for you… d’you want me to continue?”
Snape straightened the parchment and read, “On the back side it says in Amanda Da Ponte’s hand writing
Harry could not help grinning, “Don’t worry, Ms Malfoy, I’m used to far worse.” He hesitated for a second before he continued, “To be fair, we pretty much insult each other all the time.”
“As Head of the Auror Department, Kingsley has too many other obligations to be at Hogwarts all the time,” Harry explained, “he’ll just drop by occasionally, most of the classes will be held by Josh.”
“Yep. Apparently he’s on duty again as her probation officer, but obviously not teaching any more. Mum’s taken that position for good.” Ginny pulled a face. She was even more reluctant to accept Molly’s new job than Ron.
Harry looked around as far as he could stretch the ropes binding him. He searched the room frantically for any object to free himself, any chance to overcome his enemy as long as the villain was weak.
When the teachers finally started to introduce their Physical Education classes, it turned out Professor Slughorn did not offer ballet, but Zen meditation instead. Only Luna seemed to be mildly interested in this. But when Professor Flitwick promised to teach Ballroom Dancing, Hermione immediately started to pester Ron into joining this course together – as did quite a number of girls with their boyfriends all around the hall. Harry watched Cass elbowing Draco with a grin.
“So – where is that mysterious cousin of Malfoy’s?” Ron asked when the train finally left Kings Cross station.
“What a lark, pal!” Ron laughed and panted dismounting his broom, “you’re still fast as hell in the air!”
“Are you still feeling sick, Harry?” Hermione asked. “You should go see Madam Pomfrey about it.” Ron and Hermione exchanged worried glances.
“ – a sixth-year Gryffindor, I know him,” Draco snorted. “Always the shining saviour, aren’t you, Potter?” And he turned abruptly and left.
“Well, Headmistress McGonagall has hired me. She has tried to recruit a qualified Healer for some time now, preferably a Mental Healer. Many students and members of staff are still traumatized by the war and she wanted to make help available, if needed. Finally the Board of Governors permitted the expenses.”
“Sorry… I didn’t… fetch you… before I left but –“ Harry started to explain in a horrible voice he hardly recognised as his own, when Hermione cut him off.
“Shut the fuck up, Blaise!” Draco hissed. “This has nothing to do with Potter’s looks! What you suggest is plain abuse and I’ve certainly had enough of that in my life already. Whether to be abused or to pass it on to others – makes no difference to me.”
She seemed to hesitate before she went on, “You must know that I am immensely relieved, that Draco and I are merely on probation and not imprisoned like his father. For my son’s sake far more than for myself. And I am fully aware, that without your testimony, Draco might be in Askaban as well.”
“But how do we do that without going through Laddley’s stuff? I was so hoping to find a bottle of Draco-shaping Polyjuice hidden somewhere in his room – that would have been all the proof we need.”
“Could you please explain, what’s going on? Plain English, preferably?” Hermione crossed her arms in front of her chest. “I appreciate your good mood, but why should Ron, Cass and I leave the castle after dinner – to go to Wiltshire of all places! – and risk detention?”
He kept watching closely as the man in front of him changed. His shoulders became wider, the whole body put on weight. His hair grew longer and darkened. When he finally straightened up again, his hair was jet black and his eyes were piercing blue.
“ – but it’s more than that,” Hermione went on, “remember today’s D.A.D.A. lesson? He was really considerate. Two years ago he would have been delighted to wear me down in front of the class.”
“Last time I saw him he was running upstairs,” Cass nodded towards the boxes on the upper level and winked at Harry. “He’s probably trying to secure a box as a hideaway awaiting his sweetheart to join him.”
Harry took over, “On the down side – Dumbledore’s Imagic is still missing. We have no idea where Taurus Malfoy is hiding and even if we catch him, we’ll have no witness to nail him at court. Laddley – who could probably explain everything – is fighting for his life.”
He exhaled deeply and seemed to calm down. After a few seconds of hesitation he turned to Josh, “Auror Jordan – as Mr Potter was kind enough to listen to me today, maybe I could return to London now? And visit my brother this weekend again? He’s used to seeing me every Sunday and I don’t want to disappoint him.”
They chuckled and just when they clinked glasses, the backdoor opened and Aberforth Dumbledore entered the room, accompanied by Hagrid. Harry grinned and waved at them.
“Ah, here you are,” Da Ponte’s Imagic said nodding at Harry and his friends, “we want to introduce you to our new friend Ms Sylvia Silver. Sylvia, this is Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. Although they are still students at Hogwarts they have already been rewarded with the Order of Merlin first class for their successful fight against Voldemort.” She paused, then added proudly, “Of course they are all Gryffindors!”
Odie smiled warmly at Harry, “You’re welcome, dear. In fact… you’re just as welcome as David at our house, understood?”
They all laughed. It wasn’t the first joke Tavin had cracked this evening, he seemed to be really witty. Harry totally understood why Tommy was smitten by his boyfriend. The way Tommy and Tavin looked at each other pulled at Harry’s heart. Would he ever find someone equally devoted?
For some seconds his friends kept quiet, they just exchanged a glance of… worry, was it? Or compassion maybe?
Whereas a slightly dishevelled Hermione removed quickly from her current position on top of her boyfriend, Ron just grinned and stayed on his back.
The Imagic looked offended. “But Sir Potter, in my time, a young lady of her age would undoubtedly have been spoken for!” He shook his head, spurred his pony and trotted out of the painting.
“Sir Lodovicus used to keep this painting,” Sylvia made a gesture around her boudoir, “at his dressing room in Malfoy Manor as long as he lived, even after my death. But when he himself died some years later my painting was put into storage and for decades, nobody ever saw me or spoke to me. I would have loved to visit other paintings at the Manor but of course I could not call on anyone without clothes on! Then one day the Imagic of Miss Lydia Malfoy, Lododvicus’ grand-niece, explored the storage and accidentally stumbled into my room – and we became friends.”
Harry leaned back crossing his arms. “Your really don’t get it, do you? The difference between a friendly tease and plain insult?” he said frowning, “Look, I’m willing to be polite for Cass’ sake but I won’t take your shit, understood?”
Trigger warning: nothing worse than what's happening in canon volumes ... but still ... violence, torture, threat of torture, abusive language.
Harry stepped to the crib and tried to calm his godchild, “Hi there, Teddy bro, your uncle Harry’s here with you, don’t you worry.” The baby blinked at him and the heavy crying ebbed away as soon as Harry took him out of his crib. Teddy cuddled at Harry’s chest but kept whining softly.
“What I am trying to say, Mr Potter, without much success, is this: I know that my son loves you very much. And if you care for him as well, I truly hope that the two of you will become close… closer than any relationship Draco has ever experienced before. He deserves this.”
McGonagall turned to Kingsley, “Yes, please do so. And thank you, Professor Shacklebolt, for preparing the Magic Board. We should have done that a week ago…” She sighed, “could have saved Amanda and Serena.”
“This is not about security, it’s about teaching your lot some manners!” shouted the Imagic before closing with a thud.
Obviously Josh’s last remark had been the signal for Harry’s inner Gryffindor to take over, because suddenly he heard his own voice saying, “Would you have a drink with me some evening?”
Joking with Neville at the nearly empty breakfast table –very few students were up already– he certainly did not miss Draco’s silent presence. Surely Draco had eaten already, while Harry was talking to Snape? That skinny lad never ate properly anyway, most mornings he only toyed with his toast… (Harry had to concede, he was well aware of Draco Malfoy’s eating habits.)
“Right… sorry,” Harry said, feeling slightly foolish. Of course the Ministry of Magic watched Draco and Narcissa Malfoy closely. He knew that tracking spells had been put onto them, so every single move they made could be traced and controlled. They were not allowed to carry their wands, which had been confiscated by the Ministry and in case they were capable of wandless magic, this was also forbidden to them. Although Harry would not believe for a second, that Draco Malfoy could have mastered wandless magic.
“Oh, the high moral grounds of Gryffindors! What a bore!” Blaise teased with a dirty grin. “I certainly would not complain about having two pretty witches to f... f… foxtrot with. And Ms Granger herself seems very happy, having not just one but two favourite heroes of our time at her command.”
“And it might still happen. I’ll remind Flitwick that he agreed to it. Plus the Aurors will search his room soon enough, I’m sure of it. But… ” Suddenly Hermione drew a sharp breath. “Oh! What if… maybe we don’t have to enter his room… maybe we just need to talk to someone who can!”
Harry blushed and cleared his voice. “The good news is – and that’s why I’ve come –David’s problem at school has been solved, he can return any time.”
“Kreacher has not seen any Imagic where it should not be,” the House-elf answered eagerly, “but Kreacher works mostly in the kitchen.”
“My parents and I were just heading back to the Leaky Cauldron, when suddenly Laddley stepped into our path and confronted father… it was bizarre, he shouted and insulted father, called him a ‘
Cass' story about the Malfoy family had stirred something deep inside Harry’s heart. He was full of compassion for Cass – and for her cousin too. Growing up in such a messed up environment must for sure shape one’s view of the world, of relationships – and of love. Harry had to admit he had never considered Draco Malfoy’s circumstances anything but most fortunate. He had only seen the outside of course, Draco being the only child of devoted parents, enjoying wealth and privileges in abundance. Although Harry’s opinion on traditional pure-blood families had never been the best, this glimpse behind the curtain had given him a view far worse than anything he had ever imagined.
Draco Malfoy snorted, “Well Ginevra, yours is not the only family to show some likeness, believe it or not.”
This news was answered with delighted outcries from Harry and his fellow investigators shouting, “That’s excellent news, Severus!” – “Brilliant!” – “What does it say?”
Sylvia sighed deeply, “My painting was removed from the storage. It must have happened while I was asleep. When I awoke one morning I found my painting standing on an easel like this one and a stranger was tipping his brush into my space!” She looked abhorred.
Harry sighed. Now he was all alone. Otto was probably fast asleep… he had sent his pet to the owlery before leaving the hospital wing this morning. Maybe he should pay Narcissa a visit? Or give that damn parchment about potions another try? Pondering his options, he put the kettle on.
Fifteen minutes later Harry stood in front of Draco’s door, woollen coat in his hand and heart pounding. He took a deep breath and knocked.
Harry stared at the Headmistress who seemed even more amused about his reaction. He could not remember seeing her in such good spirits ever before.
Harry held his breath and just when he seriously considered taking his own life with the fork in his hand, he was saved by a crying noise from the snug.
Cass laughed, “Nah, don’t worry, your secret is safe with me!” She cocked her head. “If someday you want to let him know, that you don’t loath him completely, you will have to say so yourself.” She grinned rather wickedly.
Nobody mentioned the obvious, at least not within Harry’s earshot: Taurus Malfoy must have kept nearby. Thanks to the secret binding between Harry and Draco, Taurus had not been able to follow Otto or to remove the letter. Still he must have tried and in the course of it he had hurt the owl and broken the secret connection.
“Yeah, I can see what you mean,” Seamus nodded towards the bar, “there are some pretty strange people around at this place. Harry was even scared off by the barkeeper.”
“Maybe because you were busy with boring stuff like fighting – to quote our favourite poltergeist – ‘
“Apparently nobody has read Hogwarts’ C.O.M.A. for centuries – can you believe it? This one is the original book of course and it’s been stored at the restricted section. What really surprised me – the book has only ever been copied twice in all those years! Both copies were made ages ago for pure-blood families collecting Magical Arts, for the Ollivanders and for the Malfoys! Your copy isn’t even mentioned!“
“Quite right, Mr Potter,” said Flitwick, “as far as I comprehend this hex, that is exactly what happens to trapped Imagics. We can only hope our esteemed colleagues find their true personality again as soon as they are set free.”
He waved his wand again and grasped the stone out of thin air, then rolled it gently between thumb and index finger.
“Oh Merlin, that’s awful,” Harry was shocked. Although he despised Laddley’s conduct towards Tommy and had thought the Muggle Studies teacher a plausible suspect, he had never wanted Laddley dead. What had actually happened? Had Laddley been attacked or was he having a health breakdown? And what was to be done until they learned more about it?
“Oh fuck! You heard that?” Draco squirmed and ran his fingers through his hair, “I’m going to kill Zabini for good this time! So that’s why you avoided me all week? Oh Merlin… Harry –believe me– I would never do that to you!”
“I expect nothing less,” Harry grinned back. “You don’t know by chance where your cousin has disappeared to?”
Hermione looked unconvinced but nodded anyway. They walked closer and soon could understand what Cass was saying.
Cass seemed not surprised at all. “No need to be embarrassed, Harry! Josh Jordan obviously has that specific effect on lots of guys and girls alike. They crush wherever his gaze rests for a moment. Professor Jordan will have a fan-club of adoring students in no time.” She shrugged before adding with a grin, “Even I have to admit he’s eye candy. Still, I’m immune.”
“I am on duty of course,” Daisy sat straight and added with a very serious expression on her face, “Headmistress McGonagall asks to see Mr Harry Potter at her office in the afternoon at three p.m. to meet a visitor she is expecting.” Pinkie the raptor added an ear-piercing shriek to her message.
“You will find that we have decided to keep some and to abolish others. Before I tell you what you have to expect and most importantly, where you will rest your head tonight – let us all rise for a moment of silence to remember those who are no longer with us at this new beginning. For great is our loss and greatly missed are those who have died – among them the last two Headmasters of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Let us mourn them and all the other brave men and women who gave their life for freedom and peace.”
, Harry thought grinning to himself. His mood had improved significantly since he had received the letter. Finally something that needed to be done! The prospect of action was such a relief.
“Yes, I do. And I’m a Gryffindor, we're a pretty faithful lot. I won’t change my mind about you soon, Mr Malfoy.” Harry grinned encouragingly at Draco.
“Always a good choice,” Harry agreed and smiled at Draco. He was grateful for Draco’s attempt to lighten up the mood. Apparently they were on friendly terms again. And Draco was gay. And he might simply have been jealous of Josh… unfortunately Harry had no time to consider the consequences right now. He sighed.
“I most certainly don’t want that Sorores Cup,” Andromeda said. “You were quite right not to bring it to my home. Honestly if I never see Bellatrix’s face again, that’ll be just fine with me.”
“Have you been reading Muggle self-help books again, Minerva? Because that always makes you say things that are quite out of character. Anyway – people are different, my friend, and it is definitely easier to get along with similar spirits!”
Immediately Harry was reminded of Hedwig which made his stomach twist. But of course this was not Hedwig. This one was definitely bigger – probably male – and glared most indignantly even by the standards of owls, which were all pretty good at staring and glaring.
He brushed his teeth, ruffled his hair and put on his sweat pants, ready to face the young man who had always been able to quicken his pulse like no one else.
Harry dreaded the dance party, but loyalty with Cass made him show up anyway. The speech she had given boosted her popularity immensely – everyone wanted to talk to Cass and congratulated her on the chosen motto. Harry was secretly proud of his fellow students, obviously most of them were open-minded rather than ignorant. There was a lot of laughter, crazy ideas for costumes were to be heard and the atmosphere at the dance party was jolly and cheerful.
“Nothing!” Harry said, “It’s got nothing to do with me! Laddley harassed… someone else and I’m trying to help him.”
!” His hand prickled once more– the silvery surface reappeared and became solid again. Harry compared his copy to the original incident board and, yes, he had managed to do it perfectly.
“No, Mr Potter, Imagics are as indestructible as any magical artefact can be,” Flitwick explained, “it would take an immensely strong force to ruin them, a Basilk’s fang for example, or Fiendfyre.”
While August turned into September the weather was still remarkably fine and Harry was enjoying his prolonged summer-holiday. Otto was making good progress to become a reliable post-owl and finally able to find his way to school by his own. The owl was very proud to take on first jobs and especially fond of making deliveries to the Weasley’s home where Molly or – to the bird’s even greater delight – Hermione would treat him to fancy snacks such as flour worms or sweet beetles. Hermione had succeeded convincing her parents she was still trustworthy and was therefore able to stay at her boyfriend’s home more frequently.
“Thank you, Malfoy, for that heartfelt compliment, much appreciated,” Hermione deadpanned. She was seated between Harry and Ron, facing Cass. The colours of her own place mat were very much like Cass’, though Hermione’s pattern was one of tiny letters. She smiled at Cass and said, “Welcome – we’re lucky to have you!”
This was the signal for the opening committee of first-years to enter the hall two by two. They strode in time to some pompous classical music until they formed a circle around the room. All the first-years, boys and girls alike, were dressed in monochrome robes displaying vibrant colours of the rainbow. Right behind the kids walked Cass and Ginny.
“But we all want to help, Mr Potter… Harry!” one over-confident first-year said, his head hardly reached Harry’s elbow.
“What about Laddley’s room?” Ron asked. “Why don’t we have a look at his stuff? Maybe he left some clue? By the way, where exactly are the Muggle Studies Master’s quarters?”
“Well, I have to make a move, can’t have all the pretty girls suddenly falling for Draco sodding Malfoy, because he’s a such good dancer,” Seamus grumbled.
His only consolation were the letters they exchanged. Every morning when Harry awoke, Otto arrived at his window with a message from Draco. Although Draco was very careful and did not tell anything significant –at least, nothing to give away his whereabouts– Harry found much comfort in the mere fact, that Draco continued to write and even more so, that every letter ended with the treasured phrase
“I have full access to every single book and parchment of the collection at all times!” Hermione said with shining eyes, climbing down the stairs of the Guest House.
Kingsley Shacklebolt took his cup of tea, got up and stepped in front of a window. He seemed to admire the view over the grounds and Harry went to join him. The sun had disappeared behind thick clouds and the landscape looked perfectly November-ish.
“When I awoke again, I could not see anything, because the painting had been wrapped. And it also felt like being shrunk… then finally another man, much younger as the artist and far more handsome, removed the cover and hung my painting in his bedroom. But he was very strange… when he unwrapped my painting and first laid eyes on me he seemed quite pleased to see me. Then he did not return to his room for days and when he finally showed up again he was… he seemed repelled. He looked at me as if… as if he was totally embarrassed by my presence in his room!”
The former Headmistresses and the Fat Lady had all risen from their chairs and were shouting at the same time. “What in the name of Merlin has happened? I’m dizzy…” – “Where are we? This feels very weird indeed!” – “Don’t tell me I’ve missed my dinner!”
Blaise drew a breath, “It’s Friday night, Harry, and as much as I enjoy your company, my plans for tonight include lots of butterbeer and the adoring eyes of a pneumatic blonde by the misleading name of Chastity,” he nodded towards the sixth-years’ table, where a very pretty, voluptuous girl grinned widely at him.
Draco looked taken aback for a moment. Then to Harry’s relief, he grinned, “Considering the fact that we are indeed still school-boys, your argument seems rather pointless, don’t you think? And what’s the difference between your so-called friendly tease and school-boys fighting anyway? Please enlighten me.”
“Mr Laddley,” he said softly, “I understand. I am very sorry for your brother – and for the loss of your parents. Naturally I don’t agree one bit with what you’ve done, seeing what it has cost me – but… as I said, I understand. I won’t hold it against you.”
“Yes, that was me,” she sighed, “I have to practice my Animagic regularly but whenever I change inside of the castle, Mrs Norris throws a tantrum… but this is not what I wanted to talk about.”
“Oh Merlin, I’m here… I’m finally here,” Cass’ voice was breaking. She hugged Draco tight, who was sitting next to her. Harry had to look twice – if he was not completely mistaken, Draco’s eyes were shining suspiciously as well…
“Fuck you! Stop calling me a superhero once and for all! And about me being gay – Cass told you weeks ago, didn't she? So you better get used to it!” Harry was outraged.
“Can’ help it, Harry! I’ve picked the line up from Malfoy! He’s always teasing you like that and you seem to like it, don’t you? Considering you’re into him? Or is that a gay thing?”
“Well, actually, he might still have a chance,” Flitwick said to Harry’s surprise. “The Auror department has made some discreet inquiries and it turns out that Reekwith, Floolard & Partners –“
“You’ll pay for that!” Draco snorted. But actually, the bright colour suited him quite well, Harry thought.
Draco’s continued disappearance was worrying indeed. Not only had The Prophet covered the story of Taurus Malfoy’s capture, including a report about Harry’s injuries, but the Ministry had released several statements as well, clearing Draco’s name from any suspicion and asking him explicitly to return – yet he stayed away. Neither the Aurors searching nor the witcharding community of Edinburgh found any trace of his whereabouts.
Ron turned toward Harry, “Our sitting room looks like another library now – books and parchments everywhere!”
The villain raised one eyebrow. “Oh. So if this is not your lover, but somebody else, you won’t mind that I torture them? Not a very moral statement. You disappoint me, Potter.”
“Wow, that’s very considerate,” said Tavin. Tommy’s boyfriend was as excited as all of the younger Gryffindors about Harry Potter joining them for once. They had cheered and whistled, when he and Tommy had entered. Even the Fat Lady had obviously been very pleased to see Harry again, as she had swung open without even asking for a password.
“Well then, Charles – you can help Neville by convincing your friends to do what he says! Can you do that? Off you go!”
“Oh Merlin, that’s horrible,” Harry said. Watching a toddler die, unable to help – the sheer idea of it seemed to put even the many deaths he had seen into perspective.
Cass only laughed, while Hermione said, “We were just discussing possible themes, but Cassy refuses to tell what she suggested. My motto would be ‘A History of Magic’ and Ron went for ‘Famous Muggle Football Stars’ – what’s your idea, Harry?”
“Apology accepted,” Harry nodded at Laddley, trying for what he hoped was an encouraging smile. He did not intend to argue, that would only prolong their conversation. The sooner Laddley got it all out, the better.
“Have fun, Otto! I’ll fetch you when it’s time to go home, so be good, ok?” Harry shouted as he turned and walked back to the front of the Manor, where he was supposed to wait for his hostess.
“Charms can change the features of an object or person and also the impression they will make on others, whereas to change the very substance, the identity of an object or person, Transfiguration is required.”
Blaise took over, his voice filled the hall easily enough, “Okay, all groups begin by swimming laps to warm up for ten minutes in whatever style they want – starting now!”
“He always had a knack for Charms, got an Outstanding at his O.W.L., the swotter,” Seamus slapped Dean’s back and Neville shuffled the cards.
“Hermione, you’ll have to ask her yourself, why she never was at Hogwarts up until now,” he said, “And no – I most certainly don’t fancy her! She’s… she’s not my type. At all.”
“But the question remains, why Taurus Malfoy did it?” Ron said. “What’s in it for him, what’s to gain? He’s in no position to claim the family heritage even if Draco was out of the picture, right?”
“Frankly I’m not too keen on speaking with Kingsley at the moment,” Josh said, “but it’s your decision of course. If you want to do this the official way, you can tell him and I will back off. But be warned – it might take longer to get those records, if the Auror Office files an official request, longer than using my contacts.”
“Of course, why wouldn’t I?” Harry did not miss a beat to reply and his eyes did not falter from Kingsley’s. Hermione gasped.
“Whoa! That can’t be a coincidence! And nobody at the damn Ministry cared about that?” Harry was appalled.
Neville gave Harry’s shoulder a quick pat and opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something – but thought better of it and shook his head. He grabbed his stuff, grunted something like, “See’ya” and left.
“But Josh had no objections, he even seemed to be impressed! So clearly it must be ok?” Harry said. “Besides since when do you abide by the Ministry’s law so strictly, Hermione? I remember you performing some rather fishy spells yourself during the war.”
“Thank you for your time, Mr Potter” Gregory Laddley said. “I’ll try to keep it short. But before I start – please accept my sincere apology. I should never have done what I did. I deluded myself to justify my actions. What I’m about to share with you can never be an excuse for my crimes, I am fully aware of it.”
Laddley nodded. “Yes, of course. Thank you for hearing me out, Headmistress. I won’t deny what I said –,“ he gestured at Tommy and Harry without looking at them, “it was very rude and I apologize. I shouldn’t have said that. If you consider keeping me at Hogwart’s –and I am perfectly aware that you might not– I can assure you, I will never say anything like that again. It won’t happen, I swear.”
“Maybe you want to reconsider your orders, Harry, after school is finished?” Hermione said smiling at the House-elf, who gave her a grateful look.
“Well, Ms Granger, your theory might be quite accurate. We have strong reason to believe that Draco Malfoy has indeed been impersonated several times since his trial by means of Polyjuice Potion and that this might have been the reason for the frequent troubles with his tracking spell.”
“At the Room of Requirement of course. Just go upstairs, search the corridor where it used to be and focus. You should be desperate enough, I’m pretty sure you will find it at your service.” Harry prayed that Aberforth was right about this. “I’ll meet you there as soon as possible, so make sure the room will let me in but nobody else, okay?”
He smiled complacently. “Call it instinct or a lucky guess – I was hoping to find some evidence, some explanation for what had happened. What I did find was even better – I found the Resurrection Stone.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll talk to her,” Harry said, “and thank you for your honesty and trust. It’s a dreadful story… but I’m glad you told me.”
Hermione turned towards Harry, “What did you recommend some weeks ago concerning bickering siblings? It is unwise to interfere?”
“She’s brilliant… wow… that girl sure knows how to give a public speach!” Ron was as amazed as all of Harry’s friends.
Hermione looked mortified. Harry knew how much she hated to be praised without cause. He gave her a pleading look, silently asking her to go with his pretence. Pressing her lips firmly together she just nodded.
They went downstairs, nearly colliding with Blaise and Chastity, who were climbing upstairs. Keeping close to the wall they found their way towards the main entrance unnoticed. When they were about to exit the great hall, the music stopped abruptly and so did Harry and Draco.
“Right. But I still need to know what has happened, Mr Dumbledore, it might be important for the issue… the issue I told you about last time we talked, remember?” Harry pleaded.
“Sir Harry Potter! Most famous knight among wizards! Conquering warrior! Hero of all heroes!” The Imagic cried. Holding the reins of his his fat grey pony he bowed deeply, “Sir Cardogan at your service!”
“I’m flying out of here in the dark of the night, out of the no-apparation zone. As soon as it’s possible, I’ll risk disapparating to… to the place I’ll be staying at.”
or an insult – Harry had no chance of telling the difference. He walked back to his friends, careful not to spill more of their drinks.
“But – will she be able to follow classes of our year? Surely she can’t be supposed to start with the first years!” Harry said.
“Yeah, I can see that, Josh being great with kids,” Harry said. “He adores Teddy and sure knows how to handle a baby, cuddling and stuff. But… how come you guys seem to know so much about him? I didn’t even know that he’s Lee Jordan’s cousin until he told me!”
“You are being ridiculous, Voluptia, but I don’t have time for a lengthy discussion about house issues at the moment… how about moving to Albus Dumbledore’s portrait instead? It’s still unoccupied – sadly enough. Will that do?”
“They are actually called Imagics, these vivid images. Still, the law is very specific. All the legal spells and enchantments are listed and any other magic is strictly forbidden.”
“Ok, you impatient prat, I’ll take you to the owlery first,” Harry muttered with a grin. As he was a little early anyway and Narcissa Malfoy was not yet to be seen near the porch, he passed the front door of the Manor and walked around the building instead. At the backside of the house, alongside a very stylish conservatory, the door of the aviary stood ajar. Otto left Harry’s shoulder immediately to sail right through it. Harry was a bit nervous. How would the other owls take to the lost son? Most of them had seemed rather unfriendly to Harry, that’s why he had picked Otto in the first place, because he was so different from the others, crazy in a charming sorts of way.
Harry closed his eyes. His worst fear seemed to be true. Draco had not returned because he was perfectly happy in his exile. Perfectly happy with Mr Martin McBride, the fucking fake film star! Harry was angry, so very angry. He wanted to slap himself, hex McBride and drag Draco back to Hogwarts – but of course he would do neither. Instead he drew deep breaths to calm himself and watched silently as Draco, McBride and both dogs went inside.
When he awoke again, he felt surprisingly calm and relieved. The sun was shining and one look at his watch confirmed that breakfast-time was well over by now. It was eleven o’clock in the morning on Sunday the twenty-fifth of October 1998 – a fine, sunny day, perfect to start again.
What else was to be done? Otto was still unfit to fly, so Harry could not yet test Narcissa Malfoy’s assumption that the owl might still be able to find Draco, if Harry accompanied him, flying alongside on his broom.
“Thank you, Profes– sorry, Headmaster, for your support of Gryffindor! I wasn’t even aware that you were still stepping in for the Fat Lady – can’t some other Imagic take over? You are surely missed at the Headmistress’ office!” Harry felt guilty for Snape’s situation, as he had been the one to rope the Imagic into this.
“Watch out, you two,” Ron grinned at them, ”or you might end up becoming as scary as Tharros herself.”
“Oh, well, if you insist,” Ron mumbled but looked quite pleased again. “So let’s hear about Laddley!”
“You freak!” Laddley hissed. “You are not only a pervert but stupid as well! Haven’t I made it perfectly clear to you that I want none of your sorts in my pool?”
Harry’s heart jumped – could that really be what he thought it might? He drew the silk back to reveal a candle stick of fine bone china holding a tiny Imagic – a little boy with blonde hair and soft grey eyes who gave Harry a shy smile and blushed.
“Well, I’ve not seen this coming!” Ron said, “Last thing I knew, Ginny was with Harry – and now he’s gay and she’s with a girl! It’s confusing!”
For a moment Harry felt a rush of anger – before humour got the better of him and he laughed out loud. That toffee-nosed bastard with his posh talk sure sported a superiority complex! He shook his head and sipped at his tea still chuckling.
“Right, fresh start!” Kingsley said, “How about I treat the whole matter like any other case of the Auror Department? This way Harry even learns a thing or two about our work.” As McGonagall and Flitwick nodded their agreement, he raised his wand and shouted “
For a moment his eyes met Harry’s. They were still as chocolate brown and warm as he remembered them to be. Oh Merlin, he had no idea how to survive D.A.D.A. without making a complete fool of himself.
“… sexist is the word you are grasping for.” Andromeda finished his sentence placing the pot with slightly more fierce than necessary onto the stove. “Of course it is sexist. You don’t expect pure-blood families to be into gender mainstreaming, do you?” Her sardonic smile gave Harry a flashback of Bellatrix. He shivered and focused on Teddy who entertained himself on Harry’s lap by repeatedly making his tiny nose grow and then shrinking it again.
“Well, friendly enough, I guess. She didn’t coo, at least not like Otto does in your presence,” Harry grinned, “but she even brought Teddy a toy – a velveteen unicorn that can be willed to change colour. It’s supposed to help babies learn to control their magical impulses.”
“What? I thought both of you were supposed not to leave your home?” Harry was annoyed. Instead of being grounded, Draco Malfoy seemed to enjoy some kind of a holiday! And even more so, in Edinburgh, a city, Harry himself had never had a chance to see but very much wanted to.
Harry had to assure Flitwick that he was grateful for Pinkie’s appearance none the less – in spite of his skin that scaled off like a reptile’s. What use would a tiny Firebird have been that night? Or any other Imagic for that matter? Once again what had seemed to be a mishap had proved to be the right thing to do.
“The only sport practised at Hogwarts so far was Quidditch,” Draco Malfoy said, “and I quite liked it that way.”
Suddenly a mighty silver stallion appeared in the middle of the gym and said in Neville’s voice, “Everything’s fine! The Gryffindors are safe at the second floor common room, the door is sealed with the suggested password. Ah… and Daisy sends her love, Harry!”
The fourth woman slowly stood up and turned around. She was very beautiful with hazel eyes and dark curls falling down her back. She smiled and walked gracefully to the front of the painting. With one lascivious motion she dropped her gown – to be completely naked.
“No, of course I like it, Daisy, I like it very much,” Harry replied hastily, “it’s just… we were expecting to see the place where Ariana’s cup is hidden, that’s all.”
, for Merlin’s sake! And that’s all about communication! I’ve been told as much by my cards loving class-mates… one simply cannot play without talking. Players need to agree on the rules and make some basic arrangements, right?” Harry said.
Just when a sweet-smelling apple pie appeared at their table for pudding, Josh Jordan entered the hall. No longer wearing teachers’ robes but dressed in brown again, the young Auror headed right for their table. Harry had a distinct feeling he knew what was coming.
“How about I inform Professor Slughorn that you might be a little late?” said Josh turning towards the staff table. “I’ll be back in a flash.”
Now she aimed her wand at one of the floating pumpkins which exploded and set off a cascade of rainbow-coloured sparks.
“But why the hell not? I thought you fancied Potter anyway? Don’t you find him attractive at all?” Blaise asked. “You might reconsider, if you went to the pool once again, the guy looks quite hot without clothes, I promise!”
As soon as they were safely out of the hall, Harry quickened their pace, turned a corner and pulled Draco into the nearest alcove.
“Right you are, Headmistress Longbottom,” Phineas Nigellus Black said with a snort, “Severus the fool can’t resist playing the hero.”
“Great idea, Ron,” Hermione beamed at her lover, ”asking your parents, I mean. But they will be most surprised, if you suddenly owl them… you’ll need a good reason not to raise suspicions.”
“Ron! Don’t you think Hermione knows exactly why she’s with you? You’re a great guy, hell, you’re the best! She’s far too clever to settle for less. You’re funny and good-hearted and… just a good person!”
“Don’t be daft, Harry,” said the young Auror, “of course we’ll help… we have to go to the guest house anyway.”
Harry hesitated for a second before he turned to the door of the tea house. It might be a bit awkward facing Cass, now that he knew so much about her personal life. Still, as she had agreed on letting him in on her story, she seemed willing to trust him. What really worried him was Malfoy’s reaction. Would Draco behave even more hostile than usual? Would he be protective of Cass? Jealous? Harry felt he had to brace himself, before going through that door.
Kingsley was just opening his mouth to reply when McGonagall cut in. “First things first. Before we start talking about this painting’s ownership and provenience we have to get our colleagues out of it.”
McGonagall turned to the wailing Headmistress, who seemed to be an ancestress of Neville, “I want to remind you, that we have been talking about safety measures before I left for London. No Imagic was forced to investigate, but some of you –same as some humans– simply prefer to act instead of sitting around waiting. And Severus will not go missing right now – Professor Flitwick is with him at my living room,” McGonagall said reassuringly.
“… so you’ve known about Potter being gay for weeks? And didn’t find it necessary to tell me?” Blaise asked.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “What was that about? Aberforth behaves as if I wanted to expose Laddley! At the same time he insists that Lucius Malfoy was the one causing trouble – and for what it’s worth, I’m inclined to believe that… so why would it hurt Laddley, if people knew, what happened all those years ago?”
“I expect you to be open-minded and willing to learn, Professor,” McGonagall interrupted. “Sometimes teachers need to learn a thing or two as well, you know. Let me sum up the options you have: You can hand in your resignation and be assured, I will accept it immediately. That would be the easiest solution for all of us, but I doubt it to be the best one. I don’t like any person –teacher or student alike– to leave Hogwarts with the kind of mind-set you seem to have at the moment. The crucial question remains, are you willing to change, Professor Laddley?” She looked at him expectantly.
“Wow, that’s brilliant, Ron!” Harry said, “… but wait a minute… all of the new teachers have been students during Dumbledore’s lifetime, don’t you think? He’s been at the school for ages. Of course he knew Josh and Kingsley. Both Laddley and Tharros have mentioned, they too were students at Hogwarts. So Dumbledore must have met all of them. But still he didn’t give us a name…”
Harry silently cursed himself. Why had he come here all alone? He would be so much better off with a backup now! But waiting for help from the castle was not an option. Flying back would take far too long. Sending his Patronus was also out of the question, as his stag was bright and shining. If anybody – be it Taurus or Aberforth – was watching the yard, the silvery stag would immediately give away Harry’s presence.
“I wouldn’t dare to laugh at you! At least not while we’re kissing… I’m simply delighted that you enjoy –“ a quick kiss for Harry’s temple, “ – snogging.”
Ron dressed Draco in dark blue, which did not look bad, if a bit boring and student after student tried their talent.
“Yeah, man,” Ron said with a hoarse voice and blotched eyes. Harry was well aware that his best pal was anything but a morning person and that Ron would still be in bed, fast asleep, if he didn’t think Harry was in need of company. He was oddly touched and cleared his voice.
They fell silent for a moment. There was no need to mention Fred's name, they were all thinking of him. The sudden quiet seemed to inspire Otto to do something very much like a tap dance at the table which made them all chuckle.
“Cass did! We were ever so glad to see Dumbledore’s Imagic again! Then the others joined us for a quick celebration. Mrs Malfoy had the House-elves prepare some snacks and she even opened a bottle of Charmspagne for the occasion.”
“Well, I’m actually surprised everybody’s so alarmed about her absence,” said Ron, “didn’t she always stroll to other paintings? As soon as they offered food or drinks, that is?”
“That is a very clever remark, Mr Malfoy– it needs a good eye to spot the right colour for any object or person. Five points to Slytherin for that observation. Can all of you students see what Mr Malfoy is referring to? I want you to judge your results not only in terms of precision but in respect of suiting Mr Malfoy’s complexion.” Flitwick turned to Hermione, “Thank you Ms Granger, you can sit down now.” Then he cleared the colour away with a swift move of his wand and asked Hannah Abbott to go next.
“That is most unfortunate of course… but at least you owl has been merely injured and not killed.” She paused. “I don’t know what sort of
“Yes, indeed Mr Merry, they do,” Laddley looked startled for a moment, before he added to Harry’s surprise, “That’s one of the issues making Muggle studies worthwhile I suppose.” He gave Harry an insecure glance.
Harry was lost for words. The whole story was too horrible to be true – but at the same time totally believable. He hated Lucius Malfoy with all his heart, more than ever. What Laddley had done was wrong, of course it was, but Harry understood. He did not want to ponder what he himself would be ready to do, if a loved one was abused and hurt like that.
Harry stared at his left leg, as if it was no longer a part of his body. His leg was caught in a nervous tremor, rocking the little table in front of the fire-place. No wonder. He was anything but content with being stuck at Gryffindor Tower, waiting for Molly and Arthur to join them.
“Me neither. Did I tell you, that Tonks literally saved my life two years ago, when we were trapped by some Death Eaters? I miss her a lot, Tonks, you know. She was one of my best friends.” Josh’s voice was hoarse. “That witch made me laugh like no one else. She even asked me to be her ‘
“Yeah, she’s alright, Ginny,” Ron said, “sometimes quite funny as well. Yesterday evening she gave the most hilarious report of your visit to the Manor, talking like that Malfoy woman with a stiff upper lip – I nearly wet my pants! I think she did it mostly for Mum’s sake, likes to make her laugh.”
He got up and opened the window. The view was still spectacular, the castle still beautiful. He saw Ron and Hermione walking towards the Guesthouse – they were still his best friends.
“Easy for you to say, Headmistress,” Black snorted, “as it is just us Imagics who are in danger, no human has gone missing… so far.”
“Aunt Cissy was right, I’m afraid, Dray… “ she said apologetically. Her mat had a similar wavy pattern as Draco’s, but the colours were mostly red and lots of blue which gave the whole thing a look of bright violet, with quite a number of yellow highlights but scarcely any green.
“I wanted to show you, what it could be like… the two of us… together,” Harry said softly, “do you really want us to miss out on this?”
The Imagic kept smiling amiably and lay down on the chaise longue, careful not to wake the sleeping poodle.
Suddenly Christie chirped, “Harry, when you fight with Draco, you sound just like my mum and dad!” and she beamed at them.
“Of course it is not your fault, Mr Potter!” Ms Malfoy seemed to be bewildered by his outburst. “There is absolutely no need to defend yourself, I am not accusing you. I told you this very personal story because I hope – I beg you, that you will support Cassiopeia at Hogwarts. That is all.”
“Yes, dear,” Molly Weasley said, “I’d like to have a word in private, if you could spare me a minute?”
“No. As my valet.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes of course, as a date… but if you prefer playing gooseberry with the Roniones, I’ll understand.”
“I am so very sorry for your loss, Kreacher,” Harry said solemnly, “I know you were very close to Master Regulus.”
One hour later Harry had to admit, Cass and Draco dancing together was a sight to behold, a bit dazzling in fact. They were the best of the ballroom class by far and Harry was not surprised, when Hermione told him, Flitwick often asked students to follow their example during dancing lessons.
“Relax, both of you,” Harry said. “Otto will not be trained by the Malfoy’s caretaker and neither will I train him myself. I have already made enquiries at that pet shop in Diagon Alley where Hedwig came from, you know, Eeylops Owl Emporium. They will do it for me. Take’s about a month, the training, so he should be ready to go to Hogwarts with me in October.”
What was that about? Harry wondered. Well, Tommy actually had a very nice peach of an arse, no denying that. Harry had seen him often enough in speedos. Not that he was interested, but still.
Talking to the group at large he added, “I’ll be off – and you all, do as Neville tells you, is that clear?” then he left.
“What is it, Harry?” Hermione asked sounding quite nervous, “You look… upset? Did you talk to McGonagall about… what I did?”
Inside the building the ceiling was fortunately higher than expected from the outside, as the front gave the impression of a two-story building, but actually there was just one surprisingly spacious ground-floor room. Right in the middle stood four rattan chairs around a small table, which was set with teapot and cups. One wall was completely covered by a huge showcase full of china, at the opposite wall stood a settee dressed in pink velvet and a sideboard loaded with plates of tiny sandwiches, tea cakes and scones. Ms Malfoy poured them tea and asked Ginny and Harry to help themselves to some food. Harry and Ginny exchanged a smile – the scones smelled excellent indeed.
“Oh, no,” he said with a dismissive gesture, “not my invention… I picked the spell up from that book Ms Granger discovered, Cyclopedia of Mean Arts. It’s called Firebird Hex and enables a bird’s Imagic to leave the canvas. I’ve never heard of anything like that before, that’s why I wanted to try it. But I should have used a tiny bird, not such a beast!”
“Should be locked and soundproof now,” he said in his normal voice as soon as he was done. Harry added another spell, to keep the light in before he switched on the standard lamp next to the sofa.
Carter fumbled with his rainbow-coloured tie. He was wearing an elegant midnight blue suit, the tie being his only reference to the ball’s motto. “The thing about Christie is… she has adored you since she was little. When she was just seven, she insisted she would marry you one day. Now that she’s learned you’re gay, she has put it into her head to become at least your sister-in-law. That’s why she approached you… never mind that I had already asked a girl to be my date for the ball.”
He pointed his wand at the unconscious Draco, still bound and gagged. Apparently the villain applied another wet-rag-hex, as Draco’s head shot up and his eyes snapped open. He looked around frantically until his eyes found Harry’s.
“Take a good look at my nephew, Potter,” Taurus Malfoy said maliciously, “as long as he’s still handsome. Might not be much of a looker when I’m done with him!” He laughed at his own mean joke –
Josh wove his wand to make the frying pan glide to the table as well and took the chair across from Harry. He pointed to the other dishes and explained, “This is cornbread and that’s red salsa, a sauce to go with it. It’s rather hot, so you might try with care. And some salad of course.”
Hermione continued, “Anyway… McGonagall, Cass, Ginny and me searched inside of the tea house – it’s truly charming by the way, just like you said, Harry. And that show cabinet is huge, hundreds of items stored inside!”
“If you insist… surely he would be delighted!” She gave a little laugh before she continued, “Cassiopeia is very nice indeed, but she is certainly not as feminine as a young witch from a traditional pure-blood family is expected to be. She never was. When Nanny put a dress on her, within minutes she transfigured her outfit to pants. Her hair would never ever grow long enough to be braided. She was more daring and more adventurous than Draco. None of this behaviour was appreciated by her parents – or by myself, I have to admit. When the children were seven years old we had Draco’s Filius Stick painted and – as Cassiopeia had no sisters – a Filia Cup for her. We explained the purpose and tradition of these items to both of them and Cassiopeia declared with the greatest self-assurance, that she intended to marry a girl, not a boy.”
Attempting to lighten the atmosphere Harry said, “Anyway, it’s so good to see you again, Headmistress, I’m glad you are back at school, especially at times like this. What have you found out at the Ministry archives so far?”
Sighing deeply, Harry dragged himself out of bed and decided to stick to his tried and tested approach of keep going one day at a time.
Harry was amazed – and relieved that she did not expect him to accept that monster of an owl, who had invaded his kitchen a few days ago.
McGonagall sighed. “This is not the time to foster house prejudices, Voluptia! His painting is completely empty anyway. Headmaster Snape was kind enough to step in for you – he is presently guarding the Gryffindor common room.”
Harry felt his world turn upside down. Snape’s gaze was unreadable and when he started to talk, his voice sounded as nasal and bored as ever.
Chin on his chest, Draco seemed unconscious but at least uninjured, as there was no wound to be seen. Still under his cloak, still keeping quiet Harry tried to remove rope and gag with a wordless spell – the rope glided to the floor but the gag seemed to be stuck. It looked like he needed to unfasten the knot with his hands.
He seemed very satisfied by Harry’s shock. “Do you finally realize what you are up against, Potter? This is not some school-boy’s prank! This is me, a powerful dark wizard, who’s already in possession of two Deathly Hollows and who will go to any lengths to obtain the Elder Wand as well. Do you really want to test my determination?”
“Why is he sleeping already? Usually he nods off in the early afternoon. He’s not sick I hope?” Harry asked.
“Is this freak of an owl actually cooing? He sounds like a pigeon to me,” Ron grinned at his girlfriend. “Ah, well, that’s obviously what you bring out in a man.”
Then he turned to Harry, “The weather is too gruesome today, so we decided to stay indoors instead of cross country running.” Smiling at Harry he added, “Everything under control, Professor Potter?” – and he even winked.
Luckily Harry didn’t have much time to brood over what had happened, because he spent Saturday at the Burrow and there were enough people around to distract him perfectly. Molly was especially emotional as Bill and Fleur had just announced they were expecting a baby. So everyone was in a rather festive mood for a change. Molly fussed about Fleur, who rolled her eyes but was pleased nonetheless and Arthur opened a bottle of fire-whisky at lunchtime declaring, that it was already past five – in Tibet.
“Sorry mate, but… you two being together, that’s boring old news,” Harry teased, “yours was the most agonizing long-term courtship ever.”
“Yes, of course, Master Harry Potter Sir,” and with a few final sobs the Elf pulled himself upright again.
She sighed. “We all did, I assume. Still… I told you about Cassy’s father, how he treated his daughter? Well, neither my
“No need to worry, Mr Potter, I’m actually enjoying this service position very much,” Snape’s Imagic bowed his head in reverence. “First of all it is very interesting to watch the students come and go… Gryffindors are a most fascinating tribe indeed. Secondly I would not want to miss the opportunity to hear some excellent gossip – turns out, the Fat Lady is immensely popular, many other Imagics drop by her painting regularly. Which makes my present position perfect for investigating.”
Harry couldn’t hold back his confusion any longer. “Why are you so… different?” he blurted, “If the Imagic is meant to represent the real person, how come you are suddenly patient and even... even
“I’ll explain in a minute, Arthur, as soon as the students have left us,” Flitwick said pointing at the door.
Ron and Hermione stood next to the door waiting for Harry just like they always did. Harry gave them a quick glance, still he did not move and neither did Draco in front of him. Ron gawped at them and seemed inclined to fetch Harry – but Hermione took her boyfriend’s hand and led him out of the class.
“Look, I’m sorry but I can’t tell you, I promised to keep it secret, you know,” Harry ran his fingers through his hair, “if it were up to me…”
He sincerely thought, the Dark Mark would work like a… like an immunization. But of course it didn’t.”
“Which must be familiar to you, Zabini – seeing that practically every woman is more intelligent than you are,” Hermione said rolling her eyes.
After another silent treatment from Draco during Saturday dinner Harry went to his room, determined to stay there all evening. Most of his friends had been in rather good spirits, looking forward to the dance party at the gym but Harry saw no reason to join them. Only one more week to go until Halloween - this was the last dance party before the ball.
“Teacher’s pet, exactly. Maybe not Laddley’s, but – “, Draco pointedly looked at Josh, “most certainly his.”
“Quiet please!” shouted McGonagall’s rising from her place at the staff table. “Good evening students! I am very happy to be back in time for the drawing of the motto for our Halloween ball! Thank you for all your contributions, I am sure there are many brilliant ideas to be found in this pumpkin. But only one motto will be chosen…”
Harry assumed there had been another problem with Malfoy’s tracking spell. Had Malfoy already gotten his wand back? Maybe he should be prepared for an attack considering their last argument? The guy looked extremely upset. Well, Harry was determined to be polite for Cass’ sake, so he should at least give it a try.
Before Harry even had a chance to reply, Narcissa Malfoy shot her son a stern look and said, “Draco, how dare you insult a guest of mine like that! I have certainly not raised you to employ such bad manners!”
“Because I thought you knew!” Harry tried to defend himself. “Even if it’s illegal, I assumed you had at least heard about something like it. Believe me I had no idea, you were totally unaware of this possibility. It never occurred to me that you don’t know about something I know – you are my teachers!”
Did Draco really write his letters in the middle of the night, just before he sent Otto on his way back – or did he prepare them in advance? Harry wondered… with a sigh he put the last letter to the others. He kept them in his Sporran at the bedside table. The leather pouch reminded him of their first date – although Halloween had most certainly not ended the way he had wished for.
“Before I’ll explain, why I wanted to see you, let me ask: How are you, Harry? How is your health? And what do you think of the new regime at our school, do you like it?”
“Yes, exactly,” Flitwick beamed at Hermione in a way that made Harry suspect that himself and Ron hardly mattered at all. Which was not a totally unpleasant feeling as far as Harry was concerned.
Laddley continued, his voice hoarse, “As Tim was only seventeen – still a minor by Muggle standards – my parents and I were interrogated. Of course there’s no record in the Muggle world of the Malfoy’s, nor of their bloody Manor, so our story made no sense to them. In the end my father was blamed. He was accused of having sold his own son to paedophiles! When he was put in pre-trial custody he killed himself.”
“I am a pure-blood who was neglected a proper magical education up until now. Why? To put it briefly, my parents were ashamed of me. I am a girl but I do not feel and behave in all aspects of my life according to the female stereotype. I prefer to dress like a guy. I am attracted to girls. It’s always been like this and that is totally ok with me. But my parents did not agree. My father especially was abhorred by my preferences and when I was eleven years old he made sure that I was not admitted to Hogwarts. I had to attend a Muggle school instead. For the older students – that’s why you haven’t seen me those past years at school. Only now, after the war, with witchards like my father defeated, I am finally here and it means the world to me. Truly, it does! To be quite frank – often enough I have a hard time understanding my fellow students, when you complain about school, when you moan about homework… or lessons… or exams. Honestly? Have a little gratitude for your lot, people, really! Count yourself lucky!”
“Oh… glad to hear it… did you find out something useful already? Any leads on the black poodle for instance?”
“I don’t know the full story… I just know that Laddley hates father and holds him responsible for his brother’s state of mind… apparently the brother lives permanently at St. Mungo’s locked ward. Father and Laddley were at Hogwarts together but they would hardly have been friends, concerning father’s pure-blood obsession and Laddley being a half-blood.” Draco sighed. “I found out about Laddley when I was eleven… shopping with my parents at Diagon Alley for school – it was actually the very same day we met for the first time, remember?” Draco gave Harry a lopsided grin and squeezed his hand.
“When the children turned eleven years old, as was to be expected the owls from Hogwarts arrived. Both of them were excited and eager to go. But that very summer Taurus returned to the Manor – alone. Cassiopeia’s mother had just died. Against Healer’s advice she had tried once more to have another child and the final miscarriage killed her. Taurus was not mellowed by his wife’s death, quite the contrary, he was even more furious with his only daughter. He declared firmly, she would be allowed to attend Hogwarts but under one condition: She must fully confirm to the role of a pure-blood witch. Cass refused and was therefore thrown out by her father with Lucius’ full support. Her mother’s aunt Philomella gave her a new home, but her father kept parental custody and forbade her to go to Hogwarts or any other school for witchcraft and wizardry. She had to go to a Muggle school instead.”
“And I shall be extremely grateful for your support,” Ms Malfoy replied. “Allow me to mention one last thing, Mr Potter. I have shared my niece’s story with her full consent, I would never have told you otherwise. But please be aware, this story was meant for your ears only. Cassy certainly does not want other students to know.”
“That’s… that can’t be true! I’ve just been thinking about you! Healer O’Malley, that’s your name, isn’t it?”
“I know who you are, Tommy,” Harry grinned, “you’re a great swimmer – but I’m telling you nothing new of course. Why did you skip swimming class last week? Bored in your training group are you? How about joining Blaise and me then?”
Cass nodded, “Yep, queer as a quicksilver Sickle. Awful, isn’t it? I want other queer people to be nice, kind-hearted and tolerant, but of course being queer doesn’t make you a better person. Being discriminated against doesn’t improve one’s character, I’m afraid.”
Harry laughed. “I think your jumpers are brilliant.” Feeling bold he added, “If I ever get married, I’ll invite you and you’ll have to wear exactly that, even if it’s spring!”
“Quite understandably,” said McGonagall who had come to a halt in front of an artfully carved wooden door. She pressed her flat hand against an engraving of Hogwarts’ coat of arms and the door flew open. “Welcome to the Headmistress’ quarters!” she added.
“Ha! Mildly impressed?” Blaise laughed and slapped Draco’s back, “That’s the understatement of the year! You’re simply smitten by his authority, Malfoy – that’s what you are!”
When he had stuttered his confused question, whether that mug was his to take, Malfoy had responded with a seemingly bored expression, “I am certainly not expecting anybody else, Potter, are you?”
“He’s the artist of the hexed painting,” Harry explained, “Cass told me so. He’s supposed to be very proud of the hex. Painted the thing as a gift for Narcissa Malfoy… messy family affair, you know…” Harry wondered, how much of Cass’ story he needed to disclose.
Ron looked rather displeased by his girlfriend’s admiration for the young Auror and said, ”But he won’t stay at Hogwarts all the time, I guess? He must have more important stuff to do than watching Malfoy.”
After Otto’s return Harry and Molly immediately alerted all the investigators and they conferred about how to proceed. Meanwhile Madame Pomfrey mended Otto’s broken wing. She praised the bird for returning in spite of his injury and even let the owl stay at the hospital wing, promising to nurse him. Hagrid complained that it was his duty as a caretaker to watch over injured animals but everybody agreed that Hagrid’s hut was not safe enough for the owl seeing that the attack must have taken place somewhere close to Hogwarts. Whoever had assaulted Otto must have lurked in the neighbourhood of the school as the owl had returned to Harry’s room within half an hour. All night long search parties of Aurors combed through the grounds to find some evidence of what had happened but to no avail.
At dinner-time many students chatted excitedly about the dance party later that evening and the upcoming ball, but Harry kept quiet.
And how many more chapters will it take the boys to see the light of reason and #Drarry, for Merlin’s sake?!
Late in the afternoon Harry stood in Professor Flitwick’s office in front of an easel, impatiently waiting for Ariana to finish her drawing. Right after today’s last lesson the charms professor had willingly painted every item Daisy requested into a picture of a homely, light-flooded parlour. Now both girls were sitting at the table in the centre of this room, heads bent down and drawing. Daisy chatted and hummed, but Ariana was totally focused.
“She’s expected to arrive at noon,” said Severus Snape’s Imagic. “For now I assume you have to get going, seeing you are still in your nightwear?”
Then he turned to Flitwick and said quietly, “Professor, I could look after the students, if that’s ok? I’ll make sure the Gryffindors stay at the guesthouse and send the others back to their dormitories supervised.”
have been a suspect of sorts for some time now – and let me tell you, that feels pretty weird! I mean, I’m an Auror, a teacher and I was still a suspect?” He shook his head. “Apparently I’ve been cleared and Draco is the main suspect now?”
“Everybody is dying to know what’s been going on, mate,” Ron added, “there’s a lot of wild rumours about that night… why you and Abe were trapped at the pub and how Taurus Malfoy got those nasty cuts, you know? But I guess we’ll find out, as soon as your voice is back and you can give a full statement. So… you better do as matron tells you ‘cause we want to get the full story from you and fast, right?” Ron grinned.
“Yes, Josh… Professor Jordan has seen the painting too.” Harry sighed, “but I am sure – I am totally sure this has nothing to do with the missing Imagics of Hogwarts! Here’s what happened: There was this portrait of Walburga Black at my house –“
Harry was pleased by his pet’s affection, yet disappointed by Otto’s continued refusal to deliver a letter to Draco. Narcissa blamed the broken secrecy spell for his behaviour, but insited he might still be able to find Draco, if only Harry accompanied him in the air – hence her eagerness for Harry’s full recovery.
“Oh, but it does! Because I know the perfect costume that just goes with everything – I dare you to name three different mottos and I’ll promise this disguise I have in mind will fit in nicely with each of them!”
Harry grinned back. He suspected she was glad to get rid of him. His many visitors had been quite a disturbance to the tranquillity of her ward.
Draco chuckled and drew back his head. “Wow, someone’s a bit needy, I guess?” He looked right into Harry’s eyes and carefully removed Harry’s glasses. “Has anyone ever told you, that you look incredibly hot, Mr Potter?” He put the glasses on the side table.
So without doubt someone – probably Gregory Laddley – had impersonated Draco on that very same day by using Polyjuice potion. At least Laddley had the opportunity to do so, as he had arrived at Hogwarts one week before. Why exactly he – or whoever had done it - had used Polyjuice for hanging the painting in Draco’s room, they could only guess.
There was a moment of awkward silence until the next dance began. Hermione and Luna exchanged a look, before grabbing their respective boyfriend’s arms and dragging them to the dance-floor.
“Well, I challenge you – prove me wrong! Show me your idea of gender variety! Let me be clear: in my opinion this is not just about cross-dressing and sexual preferences, it’s about awareness and acceptance of all kinds of variety. I believe each and every one of us is truly a
Harry considered his options. If he wanted to move without the risk of tripping over something, he needed more light. Which was risky, it could give him away. But he did not want to stay frozen to the spot either. So he concentrated on the tip of his wand and made it shine in the softest possible way, nothing more than a firefly. Then he started to move.
Shouts of surprise, protest and some clapping were to be heard, before the Headmistress continued, “The Board of Governors and the staff alike agreed on this addition. Why? Because the Healers of St. Mungo’s were abhorred by the lack of physical fitness of some patients – students, they had to treat after the battle of Hogwarts. The Healers repeated what our trusted Matron, Madam Pomfrey has been telling us for years: many students are not nearly fit enough when they leave school. We want to do better and we will. To set an example the teachers will join you in this reform. In fact, all the members of staff will be your instructors for a variety of sports.”
“No, Josh just needs to learn a lesson and therefore he’s suspended. The Auror department is all about team work, Harry! It is crucial that we trust each other – you might well keep that in mind, for your own application… I fear, you also have a tendency of dealing with stuff alone or just with a few trusted friends.” Kingsley nodded towards Ron and Hermione.
The formerly naked lady blushed while both Da Ponte’s and Nightingale’s Imagic patted her shoulders encouragingly and she began to tell her story.
After lunch he had told Ron and Hermione briefly about the latest developments. Not even wanting to hear their opinion, he retired to his room pretending to feel unwell. In fact he did. He could not bear the thought, Ron and Hermione might actually consider Draco being guilty. They had joked about Draco being the perfect suspect just a week ago – but this was no longer a joke. Harry felt nauseated, terrified and oh, so very tired. He wanted to talk to Cass about it, but that was out of the question of course. In the end he broke down on his bed and slept during most of the afternoon.
Cass and Draco waltzed by and Harry sighed some more. Which one of them was actually leading right now? If he was not mistaken, they changed roles while he was watching. They moved most gracefully, looking very much like two guys dancing together in fact, a sight he had never seen before… Harry took a closer look: most of the couples were made up by two girls, followed by traditional mixed couples and – yes – some boys were dancing together as well. Harry marvelled at their sight. There was Tommy, a handsome sixth-year from his swimming class dancing with a chubby redhead – they had obviously no idea what they were doing, but still seemed to enjoy themselves very much. Harry watched them longingly until he heard somebody else sighing at his side.
sweetheart has disappeared and not Harry’s – oh gosh, it still feels odd to think about Draco sodding Malfoy as your – you know…”
“Quite right, Mr Potter,” McGonagall nodded. “I hope you will keep up swimming as Professor Laddley insists you are very talented?”
Harry kept a straight face although his heart dropped considerably. Hopefully this was nothing but a bluff? Maybe that was exactly what he himself should do – bluffing?
After that everyone said quickly good night. Dean offered to walk Luna back to Ravenclaw tower, which she gladly accepted, the others went to their bedrooms.
“Eliminating suspects, I agree,” cried Flitwick, “on the other hand Ms Granger has provided us with lots of fascinating new insights about Mean Arts – maybe you could give us a summary of your findings, just like you told me this morning, Ms Granger?”
“Don’t those legal advisers know where he hides? He’s their client, they must have a way to contact him, if necessary! Can’t we get them to talk?” Ron asked.
“That’s my guy, Kreacher, thanks,” Ron slapped the House-elf on the back which gave Kreacher the hiccups.
“Which was terribly distracting and made you forget to support your partner, you wretched dickhead,” Dean complained, “I’ve lost the final game because of you.”
That is why they had ended up with their plan. It only could go wrong, if Laddley failed to repeat his foul talking because of the schools increased awareness of diversity issues. Maybe he wouldn’t have harassed Tommy in the first place, if Cass had given her speech some weeks before. In a way they gave Laddley another chance to correct his behaviour– and Harry was not quite sure, whether that was generous or way too soft-hearted. They had not even decided on how to proceed should Laddley behave himself.
“Good evening everybody, I’m Cass and I’m deeply honoured that my motto has been chosen. I repeat: ‘
“And indeed at dusk other guests appeared, about a dozen of them. Only wizards, none of our class-mates, some several years older than we were. And they all stared at Tim in a way that made my stomach churn. When I asked Lucius, why he had not invited any girls, he just laughed. Again I suggested we should leave, but Tim talked me out of it. He was fascinated by Lucius, eager to discover all of the Manor’s treasures – and completely oblivious to the attention he got.”
“He’ll be absolutely thrilled to see you, Harry – please come in!” He held the door open and said, “I’m Odie by the way.”
He addressed the class at large again, “I get it you’re all aware why Mr Weasley’s Patronus is changing?”
Harry stared at her. “I should hope not.” It touched him oddly to see Hermione so worried about Draco.
“Certainly, Mr Potter,” Ms Malfoy said. She put her hand lightly on Harry’s forearm as if he was meant to escort her to an invisible dancefloor. Harry hesitated for a second before he offered his arm properly and off they walked together. He found the whole situation ridiculous, but decided to go along with Ms Malfoys strange formal behaviour anyway.
The evening crowd at the common room was pleasant enough, Harry had to concede. Luna, Neville, Dean and Seamus were playing a weird game of cards, which Dean had learned from a Muggle great-aunt living on the continent. Harry watched for some time but found the rules of the game hard to comprehend – he never even knew, who teamed with whom as they seemed to change partners all the time.
“Have lunch, for Merlin’s sake,” Ron grumbled, “can’t think with an empty stomach. You go listen what Kingsley and the Headmistress have to say in the afternoon and then we will work out a plan to straighten that mess out. But first things first! Lunch!”
“To keep you company, of course! Ron only told me yesterday evening about your early morning routine… we would have been here every morning, if I had known before!” She shot her boyfriend an annoyed look. “How was your night? Did you find some sleep?”
Snape’s Imagic sighed again, ”Mr Potter, those are deep questions. Even ordinary magic has its secrets and the art of magical painting is anything but ordinary or simple.” The Imagic seemed to consider his words carefully as he went on, “Some secrets will never be unveiled. If I had to make an educated guess, I would say, any Imagic’s character represents the painter as well as the portrayed, as the artist decides which characteristics are transferred from human being to Imagic and which are abandoned. But be assured, if my former self had felt nothing but distain and hatred for you – I would not be able to behave as I do.”
“That’s an excellent idea, Kreacher,” Harry said, “yes, please, ask your colleagues and report any unusual sightings directly to me, okay?”
“If you’re really not interested in the Malfoy’s fortune… maybe you want to hold me to ransom in exchange for a free pass abroad?” Harry said.
“I think that was part of the experiment’s attraction for him,” Josh winked at Harry, “anyway – would you rather have it the other way round?”
“You’re such a gobshite! I’ve had enough of your obnoxious comments!” Draco shouted. He stood up abruptly and turned to leave.
But many students from traditional wizard families knew very little about Muggle mythology and therefore asked their Muggle-born friends, what kind of a dating service Noah’s Ark had been? After some laughter and whispered explanations Flitwick continued, “And finally it is my pleasure to announce, that we will have a ball – literally a ball – at Halloween!”
“Right, Harry,” Daisy got up and tidied her dress from some leaves, “Pinkie will carry me – he’s such a good mount.” She raised her eyes to the top of one tree and called, “Pinkie, be a good birdie and come to Daisy!”
“We certainly did not know that such a hex exists,” McGonagall said with a stern face, “and that is most unfortunate, because otherwise we would not have encouraged Imagics to explore unknown territory. We were under the impression, as long as no painting was removed from the premises, they would be safe.”
He got up from the sofa to return to his own room. Before he closed the door of the common room he heard Draco mutter something. Harry could not quite understand what he said, but his tone – was that even possible? – was civil. Harry grinned to himself. He could outsmart that bastard with a clever mix of teasing and politeness, it seemed.
When at half past eight Harry took his place at the breakfast table, neither he nor Draco Malfoy mentioned their early morning encounter. Same as everybody else at the table, they were deeply engrossed in their new time tables, which they had just received.
Harry stretched and yawned in his bed… the idea of a nice cup of early morning tea seemed very tempting. He got up. Still in his sleeping attire of t-shirt and boxers, he just put on sweatpants and went to the common room.
“Come on, Ron,” Neville fell into his seat with a thud, “we all have seen this coming for weeks.” He grinned at Ginny and Cass, “I think you’re a cute couple.”
“Oh – right!” Hagrid shouted, “Poor Snow White! I almost forgot about her! She’s having her baby and I’m the midwife!” he explained before he headed for the back door.
At lunchtime both Professors Weasley were officially introduced to the students. Many kids stared at their son and daughter on that occasion. Some of the younger kids, who were still home-sick, might envy Ginny and Ron, but most of the students obviously pitied them.
“And you truly believe you would be the only Krum present?” Draco laughed at Seamus, “Lo and behold! The sweetness of simple minded Gryffindors!”
“What is this?” Aberforth narrowed his eyes, “are you threatening me, kid? Tell you what, I don’t give a fucking shit about the bloody Aurors or your fame! You’re way out of your league, kid – “
Hermione blushed. “He’s a Professor, Harry, in case you forgot! I can’t ask him to spend hours of his week-end listening to my research!”
“Don’t panic, Potter, it doesn’t suit you. But I sure hope, your costume will – suit you, I mean.” Draco cocked his head, “What will you wear? Let me guess… something very heroic, I assume? A Muggle hero costume, perhaps? Superman… or Achilles maybe?”
Harry praised his feathered friend as they made their way to the main building and told her some of Otto’s latest tricks. Right in front of the Manor they were met by Ms Malfoy, looking tense.
Otto hooted approvingly. The owl had settled down at the back of a chair and his huge eyes looked at the two young men on the sofa holding hands – and the view seemed to please him enormously.
“Well thank you so much, Ms Silver. I think that is all for now,” Flitwick said. “Unless there is something else you wanted to tell us?”
“He keeps a picture at his bedside locker,” Floppy said under her breath. “A picture that is not moving.”
“You’ve always had the emotional intelligence of a door knob,” Ginny snorted, “you didn’t even see your own relationship coming – while everybody else knew for ages you were meant to be with Hermione.” She pulled a face at her brother.
Suddenly Harry remembered his promise to talk to Daisy in the morning. When he looked at the painting of Wizard’s Wood he found the Imagic-girl in a slumber.
“Oops, sorry… Draco said… never mind. Anyway – as much as I would love to meet your friends, I’m not going to abandon Draco. I’m sorry, but I’ll only sit with you and your friends, if Draco is welcome too. He’s not just my cousin, you know, but also my best friend. Plus he has been my sole connection to Hogwarts for seven years. I’m not going to drop him now like a hot potato.”
“I’m not sure that would make it much easier,” Harry said, “besides… since when is it possible to disapparate at Hogwarts?”
Aberforth snorted. “Fight? That’s hardly the right word… Lucius Malfoy’s cussedness more likely. But Malfoy got away with it as usual. Well, now he’s locked up for different reasons and that’s that.”
Slytherin was the last house to leave. Blaise led them to the exit and Draco watched the rear end of their group, accompanied by Harry.
“You need not worry, Sylvia,” said Headmistress Nightingale, “Severus Snape is a good person, in spite of his intimidating looks. He will return your dog as soon as we tell him, that you miss your pet, I am quite certain of it.”
“And a fire… when the firewitchards arrived, they found you and Aberforth upstairs, both bound to chairs. As I’ve said before, it was a close call – for the two of you – but you made it and so did Aberforth. The pub… basically it’s burnt down.”
“But just a few days later Cass was refused to go to Hogwarts although you were admitted – and Draco was furious! He compared your situation to his cousin’s, and that’s when Draco’s emotional conflict and his aversion against Dumbledore began.”
“Three butterbeers, please,” Harry said when it was his call, “and may I ask you – where’s your boss? Aberforth Dumbledore? I’d hoped to see him.”
“Of course we do. We discussed every aspect of the whole matter nearly all night long,” Hermione said, “I sincerely think he would not risk his probation for such a prank… or whatever that is. He’s too clever for that.”
McGonagall sighed. “I see. You have still no concept of Hogwarts true magic… let me explain. Many objects and parts of our wonderful school have a life of their own, not only the Imagic paintings. Hogwarts’ library for example has a very… delicate personality. Why do you think Madam Pince is often so… exhausted and therefore sometimes not in the best of moods?”
“That’s the house colours – the mats give away how much of each house’s qualities you’ve got!” Harry shouted excitedly and started to look out for his own name.
“That went rather well, if I say so myself,” Narcissa said proudly. “I certainly would appreciate some tea now.”
Finally they agreed on how to proceed. McGonagall and Flitwick were to inform the other heads of houses on the Fat Lady’s absence and they promised to monitor Professor Tharros’ reaction most carefully. Harry and his friends went back to the Guesthouse and accompanied the younger Gryffindors back to their dormitory. It was after midnight when Harry finally went to bed, tired but full of hope.
“Easier is not always better, Filius,” she replied, “I’ve learned at least as much from people who are very different from myself as from other Gryffindors. Just look at us – you, Pomona and myself!”
Kingsley Shacklebolt looked intently at Harry. “So… you’re still interested in this investigation? Now that you seem to be rather close to Draco Malfoy? Still willing to face the truth no matter what?”
“Searched? What are you even talking about?” Draco looked startled. “Searched by whom? And what are they looking for anyway?”
Odie reached for the largest teapot Harry had ever seen. “Take a seat and have a cup – we could chat a bit while waiting for David and Frank, if you like?”
“It’s not about what I think, Harry. My opinion does not matter at all. Fact is, according to the Archive’s registry Draco Malfoy was at the Magical Arts collection on August twenty-eighth and no one can vouch for his presence in Edinburgh. If you insist, that Draco has nothing to gain by abducting Imagics, let me ask: Who has something to gain by setting up Draco? And we must not forget – less than two years ago Draco Malfoy actually tried to kill Headmaster Dumbledore in person.”
Draco stared at Harry as if seeing him for the first time. “You’re really…” he shook his head, “you’re serious about… us?”
“No idea. Spur of the moment, I guess?” Harry grinned. “Glad you’re having fun by the way. I haven’t heard you laugh half as much in eight years.”
was clearly visible in the bright red of the placemat’s pattern and Harry turned around to gesture towards Neville, who still hadn’t figured out where to sit.
“Good girl,” Draco said with a grin, “we will leave you to your book now, because I need to talk to Harry about some boring school stuff… enjoy Beedle’s stories!”, and he winked at her. Harry’s heart skipped a beat at the sound of Draco using his given name.
“Please don’t mention it,” Ms Malfoy replied then fell silent again. Eventually she turned around, her hand still on his forearm and led him along a gravel walk. Harry realised, they were not taking the direct route to the tea house.
“No way,” said Harry taking up the bait, “let’s see… my first motto is: Famous Quidditch Players. Second: Chocolate-frog cards,” and with a triumph he added, “Third: Muggle film stars.”
“Welcome, Professor Jordan, what a surprise! We’ve just started,” and Harry told them about the arrangements for the newcomers.
“Hermione – just… thanks.” Harry exhaled deeply. “It’s all those loose ends, I guess? We have so many different lines of enquiry… plus Draco has been gone for more than a week now and I’m just worried sick that this lunatic of an uncle might find him before… before I can do anything to keep him safe.”
“Oh no, not to worry,” McGonagall smiled some more, “this is platonic love at its finest. This love is just a blessing for Ms Granger and for all of us actually, because her Ladyship will be in considerably better spirits as long as Miss Granger stays at school… hmm, we should probably persuade her to stay as a teacher…”
“Good evening, Professor Laddley,” said Tommy. He was wearing nothing but his swimming trunks and seemed totally relaxed. His timing could not have been better. Laddley was already startled by his unexpected appearance and being on his knees in front of his least favourite student did not improve his mood.
Blaise had also spilled the beans about Harry’s outing, hence Harry had received quite a number of adoring looks from guys all day long, whereas some girls seemed to have fallen into deep mourning.
Harry went on about the Imagics abducted at Hogwarts and finally described the painting which had been discovered in Draco’s room tonight.
“You’re way too late Harry! Ginny and Cass just left, you should have seen them dancing the Tango… wow, that was hot,” Seamus said with a dirty grin.
“It’s Friday for fuck’s sake,” Ron blurted, “we’ve just had a delicious lunch, now it’s one more lesson to go and that’s D.A.D.A., our favourite – so stop sulking for once and start looking forward to a glorious weekend! It’s Halloween! We’re going to have ball!” Ron looked eagerly from Hermione to Harry. “Honestly, give the investigation a break!”
“Oh, stop it, Ron! The war is over, time to move on – it’s about time we get over house-prejudices!” Hermione exclaimed before turning to Harry, “I think it’s great that you and Draco are getting along so well.”
“Oh, in that case, I’m more than happy to come, Harry! I’ll let Cissy know in advance,” Andromeda smiled with relief. “I’m glad you feel that way.” She started rocking Teddy in her lap up and down, who protested loudly because the movement interfered with his stern staring at Otto.
“Tommy, hear me out… you’re a Gryffindor, right? What would you do, if he had talked like that to some other kid? You’d stand up for them surely?”
in the middle of Diagon Alley, can you imagine? Well, father stunned him and that was that. I knew better than asking what it was all about… but of course now I wish I had.”
“Be assured that Malfoy Manor will be watched very closely, Mr Potter,” Snape said. “The Aurors actually hope that Taurus Malfoy turns up at his former home as soon as he finds out that his sister-in-law is absent. That’s the main reason why she will be staying at Hogwarts. It’s a trap. Auror Shacklebolt reckons, if Taurus Malfoy is indeed watching the school, he’ll find out about Mrs Malfoy’s presence. He might be tempted to take advantage of the empty Manor and try to lay his hands on some of the artwork.”
“But I don’t want you to be all alone, Kreacher,” Harry explained, “don’t you like living with other House-elves at Hogwarts better than being all by yourself?”
“Well… you could just disapparate downstairs instead, if you wish? You’d still have to climb the stairs of the guesthouse of course.”
“Well, Taurus Malfoy’s involvement is certainly something to be considered,” said Kingsley. “I’ll check immediately, maybe the Ministry has some news concerning his whereabouts.”
“Well of course I had to accompany my wife to her new place of work,” Arthur smiled at Molly, “I’m ever so proud of her.”
Josh behaved totally relaxed around Harry and did not favour him at all during lessons. But occasionally after class, while everybody packed up their stuff and left, Josh chatted with Harry for a bit. They talked about Auror training, Teddy Tonks or Josh’s cousin Lee who had just started to work for the Daily Prophet.
“No, Minerva, not yet. I have just convinced Mr Potter to take a seat and have a little chat until Miss Dumbledore is done with her drawing.” Flitwick said. “Tsk, tsk, you Gryffindors are an impatient lot.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry, I love them both to bits – just don’t tell Ron, I said that.” Ginny smirked. “But… it’s a ball, for Merlin’s sake! You’re supposed to… you know, at least flirt a bit, fool around and what not!”
Meanwhile Harry decided to ask Kreacher to fetch his very own C.O.M.A. copy from No 12. When he called for him in the late afternoon, the House-elf was as eager to serve his master as ever but also surprised Harry by asking for permission to stay at the old house over the weekend.
“Wait, Dray, you can’t go before the motto is chosen – just ignore Blaise!” Cass pulled at Draco’s sleeve and held him back. “Just a few more minutes, please!”
“Gladly, Minerva,” said the Fat Lady with regained composure. She nodded towards the group of witchards in front of the hexed painting, “You will excuse me but I am rather tired.” With surprisingly graceful steps she left the boudoir painting and emerged again at Dumbledore’s empty portrait mere seconds later. Snuggling comfortably in his high-backed chair she dozed off.
Harry’s heart clenched. So that was Draco’s opinion of him: disgust. He wanted to run away but his body seemed rooted to the spot, his ears rang and he hardly comprehended what he heard next.
But Harry’s mind was occupied by the Imagic issue. Of course Draco was totally clueless about the suspicions threatening him and as much as Harry longed to warn him off, naturally that was out of the question. In fact Draco seemed to have a really good time at the party, his mood had improved significantly since dinner. As Cass was the most sought-after dance partner for girls and boys alike, Draco danced with Ginny nearly all evening, at least as long as Harry stayed at the party. He retreated early and went to bed in a foul mood.
“Lucky you,” Tommy nodded, “I mean, not just you, Ginny – but all of you from witchard families… the magic world is much more supportive of queers than the Muggle world. My parents totally freaked out when I told them two years ago. It was like
“I assume seventh and eighth-years have to share … we aren’t as many as the smaller kids,” Draco said with a seemingly bored voice, ”at least my house is rather depleted of older students and many Ravenclaws haven’t returned as well.”
“Well, just about 90% of all the young witches and about 10% of the guys?” she said. “Obviously you don’t read the gossip column of the Daily Prophet, otherwise you would know, that he became famous for being the youngest Auror ever, passing the final examination of Auror training with an Outstanding in every single subject when he had just turned 25.” She sounded a tiny bit envious.
“No, no worries,” Tommy interrupted, “he’s no racist, at least as far as I can tell.” He sighed, “but he’s got a problem with… queers.” He shot Harry a quick glance to check his reaction. “I’m gay, you know. He must’ve heard about it or maybe he saw me with Tevin, he’s my boyfriend…” His voice trailed off as he waited for Harry’s reaction.
“Thanks for the offer, Christie,” Harry said, trying to keep a serious face, “I appreciate your effort but I have plans already, sorry.”
“Of course not, Harry! That would have been most intrusive, don’t you think? No, I was waiting for you to tell me in good time.” Now she looked concerned again. “And that is why I wanted to talk to you. Why didn’t you tell us? We only found out when Ginny wrote that letter and told us about Cassy… I had thought… Arthur and I had hoped, you would trust us.”
He stepped into the bright bird-house and was surprised to see Draco Malfoy leaning against the wall next to the door, hands stuffed in his trouser pockets and a strained expression on his face.
But in the course of just three weeks Harry had learned, Draco’s personality was made of much more than arrogance and selfishness. Draco was polite and even respectful towards Hermione. He was totally easy-going with Blaise and when Draco looked at Cass, it was obvious he was capable of caring deeply for someone. So why had he been such a poor boyfriend to Pansy? Not the right girl?
Cass would probably want to tell Malfoy as well, Harry guessed. He had to assure her that was okay with him. She shouldn’t feel like having to keep a secret about something that eventually would be public knowledge anyway.
Harry frowned, “No, I don’t think so… but I will give it some thought… it would have to be a painting? Not just any picture? I mean, there’s loads of pictures, right? Issues of the Prophet, copies of that dreadful biography by Rita Skeeter, not to mention chocolate-frog cards…”
Tommy and Harry had decided to trap their teacher well before training started, preferably before Blaise turned up (which shouldn’t be a problem as Blaise was notoriously late). They assumed Laddley would be more likely to freak out if he believed himself to be all alone with Tommy. Harry wondered, whether Tommy was nervous? It hadn’t looked like it, when they had talked briefly some minutes ago. The sixth-year student had given a very composed and mature impression before withdrawing to the locker room.
“Well, he really is a prick, isn’t he? Still, what he did for Cass… oh, bugger, let’s go home, Otto – I want to enjoy some more Malfoy-free days before school starts and I have to see that git every day again.”
But most surprising was the background of the painting: Next to a curtained window four women were sitting around a card table. They seemed totally focused on their game and did not even look up when six witchards gathered around the painting.
“It seems as if Headmistress Da Ponte’s and Headmistress Darknight’s Imagics will not return as quickly as expected…” McGonagall said looking at her pocket watch, “let us continue in the evening or maybe even tomorrow – I’ll let you know. Headauror Shacklebolt and I have to prepare for the interrogation of Professor Tharros and I believe there is an owl waiting for me,” she nodded towards the window where an official looking barn owl was pecking at the window pane.
“Frankie and I, we don’t have children of our own, but we still try to support young people. We’ve had several kids staying with us for a while, and not just queer kids… a refugee girl from Iraq for example and others who needed temporarily a safe place to live. David knew about that, so naturally he turned up a few weeks ago when he was suspended and didn’t want to go home either. I insisted that he told his mum, of course.”
“Oh it was horrible, Amanda,” Sylvia said, “I was so afraid! When the stranger saw that I was awake he started to ask me all sorts of questions! But Lodovicus had never wanted me to talk to other men so I was too afraid to answer! I just kept quiet and in the end, I think, he thought me unable to speak at all.
"Sounds good to me," said Josh, then he addressed his students, “You've heard what Mr Potter said, so we have to be patient... if you don’t want to wait, you can go to the gym instead, just like the others have done.”
When Harry tried to sneak out of his room after midnight, he immediately ran into a middle-aged witch in Aurors’ robes, who asked him politely but firmly what he was up to. He pretended to need a night-cup of tea from the common room – which he then had to prepare and take back to his room under her watch. Was every corridor, every dormitory watched that closely? Or did they observe Harry’s room with special care, expecting Draco to seek him out?
When the door closed behind him, Harry approached the painting above the fire place where a sweet looking girl in an old-fashioned dress sat contently on a comfortable chair.
“Will you just… calm down, Kreacher, alright?” Harry even patted the House-elf lightly on the shoulder.
“Wow!” and “Ah!” the other students exclaimed. Harry had picked the perfect colour indeed. Draco looked absolutely stunning. The pale bluish green made his eyes shine brighter and his complexion seemed to glow – until he looked right into Harry’s eyes and both of them blushed violently.
“But to answer your rather blunt question, I don’t think we’ll get together again.” Harry sighed. “I really like Ginny, hell, I love her, but she feels too much like family for a girlfriend.”
“Don’t look at me, I refuse!” said the Imagic with a flushed face. “Stepping in for the Fat Lady is one thing, but I will not visit that… that lady of easy virtue again! Even if she were dressed properly! It was embarrassing enough to get Mephisto out of that dreadful painting – and by the way, she kept quiet for all the while I was there, did not even respond when I asked her about the dog’s name.”
as soon as I enter your house. At least the Aurors were able to remove the other portraits from the hall, so it’s just her single voice anymore.”
“What does McGonagall want, Harry?” Hermione looked concerned, “You can’t be in trouble? I mean, not this year again?”
“Thank you for your time and for the willingness to hear me out. You are a good listener Mr Potter. That is a rare quality. No wonder you are wise for your age. ‘
Memory after memory flashed through Harry’s mind: Ginny stating Draco’s handsomeness on the train. Draco smiling at Ginny and laughing with her. Ginny and Draco dancing together last Saturday. Even Draco snapping at Seamus just minutes ago, probably to protect Ginny– suddenly it all made sense. They were in love. Harry felt sick. So that’s why Draco attempted to befriend Harry! That’s why he was polite with Hermione and Ron! It was all about Ginny and had nothing to do with Harry at all.
“Nah, no worries. He’s teething and Andromeda said he didn’t get much sleep last night – I suppose, neither did she. He fell asleep an hour ago, so I took the chance to throw some cooked lunch together. I’m bored of sandwiches lately.”
“Morning, Mr Potter,” said Draco standing in front of the Wizard’s Wood when Harry entered, “say hello to our new guest. Her name is Daisy, she’s a dedicated reader and we have already talked about our favourite books.”
“Aberforth is even worse off than you are, Harry! That’s why he was transferred to St. Mungo’s. But McGonagall says he’s making good progress and will be back soon. And Taurus Malfoy – well, we’re not sure what exactly has happened to him. He was found in a field outside of Hogsmeade, badly injured, hardly a bone of his body unbroken. He’s still unconscious, also at St. Mungo’s. Apparently they have a special ward for prisoners… he’s heavily guarded, of course.”
Harry moaned and buried his head in his arms. And he honestly had believed Severus Snape to be the all-time low of his D.A.D.A. teachers! Now he had to live with the fact, that his last and final D.A.D.A. teacher would be a guy he had already shagged in his dreams! How was he ever going to get through that year without dying of embarrassment? How was he supposed to concentrate during lessons and pass Defence Against the Dark Arts at N.E.W.T.-level with good enough grades to get into Auror training?
Harry sighed and pushed his soup away. Draco’s hurt look made him immediately feel guilty – but why actually? He was just trying to gain some distance from a guy he had fancied for a while, a guy who found Harry
“Well, this particular crib-charmer happens to be part of the Malfoys’ family legacy. According to Ms Malfoy little Draco used to be rather fond of it,” Harry said with a wicked grin. “The image of Malfoy playing with his rainbow coloured unicorn – well, that’s something to relish, don’t you think?”
Professor Tharros was a living breathing example for the fact, that occasionally first impressions could be as right as rain. She was brilliant, no doubt about that, but very strict and expecting a lot from her students. The loads of homework she was handing them freely made everybody moan and wish for having McGonagall back – until Hermione had to remind them, that Headmistress McGonagall had never been shy on dumping them in home-work either. Still, Harry missed McGonagall. She had not only been his teacher and head of house, but also an important ally in his fight against Voldemort. He trusted her opinion as much as he admired her character.
Harry thought. He knew from his own experience that his opponent would be caught up in unpleasant sensations of change for a short while. A small window of opportunity to do something, anything!
Harry stared at the little table in front of him. Apple pie. Of course Narcissa Malfoy had been served the same dishes as the rest of the school. He heard the door clicking shut but kept staring at the cake.
“Is there a problem, boss?” shouted Tadgh. The barman had stopped digging and apparently watched their exchange. “You want me to kick the lads out in the streets?”
“I’ve got to get out,” Draco said not even trying to keep his voice down, “haven’t you heard Shacklebolt? I’m on probation, I have to follow his orders… however inconvenient the timing might be!” Luckily the noise level drowned his words.
Harry laughed. “Well that’s settled! Thanks again Kreacher, for the book and also for taking care of Number Twelve… maybe you could go there once a month to check everything’s fine? What’ you think?” Harry said.
“Remind me again – why are we here?” Ginny muttered under her breath as they were walking from the entrance gate up to the Manor the following Sunday afternoon.
Draco said nothing, but nodded and gave Harry such an intense look that his heart pounded a bit faster. No time to contemplate this, Harry thought.
“It’s up to you, Tommy,” Harry said turning to the younger student. “If you want to stay, I’ll be right with you of course – but we really don’t have to. You’ve heard quite enough hateful words already, I’ll totally understand, if you don’t want any more of this.”
Half an hour later Harry sat comfortably in a deck-chair near the pool, wearing swimming trunks, a robe – and his Invisibility Cloak. He was waiting all by himself, as the pool was reserved for special training at this hour. Having nothing better to do, Harry relived his last conversation with Draco again and again, trying to make sense of it without much success.
“Don’t you dare put your filthy hands on him, Draco,” Hermione pretended to be outraged. “Now that you’ve secured everybody’s favourite hero for yourself – isn’t he sufficient?!” She laughed and jokingly slapped Draco’s arm.
“Oh really?” Hermione said, “That’s great, because there isn't much about Laddley on the board yet. Right, here we go... I don’t want to repeat everything we have already discussed before, just sum up some news. I think, what’s most important is the information on Tharros’ and Laddley’s background.” She stepped closer to the board and pointed at the image of their Transfiguration teacher.
“It’s okay, Gin… don’t you think we’re already much better at not freaking out about… bits and bobs?” he gave her an encouraging smile.
“Hey, relax, mate.” Ron said, “they’ll be alright. A team that includes Hermione and McGonagall won’t ever be in trouble.”
Tadgh stepped next to his boss and both men looked grim and determined. “Better listen to your pal, lad,” the bartender said with a growl.
Before she stepped up, Draco got to his feet as well, hugged her tight and said, “Oh well, I get it, you just couldn’t resist – crazy Cassy, go give your speech!” He was flushed and seemed torn between pride and panic.
Again the investigators exchanged glances – Hermione had put Lucius Malfoy’s picture next to Gregory Laddley’s. Sylvia Silver seemed to be very observant and to have a good eye for faces, as she had spotted the likeness between father and son.
“Right,” Harry said oddly touched by Draco’s disregard for his own interests. “But if you want to support your cousin, then you better hurry to your mum and sort out, whatever problem the Ministry has with your tracking spell. Hard to grasp as it is, Cass really loves you and she needs you to be at Hogwarts next week. And believe it or not, I like her and I have no intentions whatsoever of harming her. So fuck off – you prick!”
’ and was suggested by Ms Cassiopeia Cornelia Malfoy! Hooray! Relish! Enjoy!” And with one last bang setting off a cascade of sparkles the spectacle was over.
“Oh that’s fine with me. I just passed my O.W.L., I wouldn’t be able to follow your classes anyway,” Cass said.
“As we have not enough space for the larger than usual number of students, an extra dormitory for all of the eighth-year students has been installed, which also serves as a guest house. Professor Jordan will be so kind as to see the eighth-year students to their own dormitory. That is all for now, further news will be discussed tomorrow morning at breakfast. In closing I would like to quote our most famous Headmaster Albus Dumbledore – ‘
Draco said carefully, “Well… I might have no idea what exactly is going on but as you’ve been obsessed with Magical Arts for weeks - I assume it’s no coincidence that the absence of the Fat Lady causes such an amount of precaution?”
“Calm down, Harry,” Ron grinned, “you’re still a bit oversensitive as soon as Malfoy’s name pops up, don’t you think? What I’m trying to say is, maybe we should find someone who knows about Tharros’ past? An informant? We could ask other members of staff… or I could write to my parents? I always had the feeling they know each and every Gryffindor alive or dead.”
“As a rule, wild-life animals will never change into tame animals,” Professor Jordan explained, “it will always be the other way round. Same is true for herbivores, they will never change into carnivores. Interesting, isn’t it? Patronuses are a most fascinating topic, don’t you agree?”
Harry swallowed and cleared his voice, “Just to make sure… you don’t have to worry… your story is safe with me. I hate gossip – and not just about myself.”
Embarrasing enough, both Hermione and Ginny had made cautious attempts of asking Harry what had happened between him and Draco. Harry had managed to sidestep their questions pretending he had no clue what they were talking about, but grudgingy he had to aknowledged the fact that the girls must have figured out his feelings for Draco. Just like Severus Snape’s Imagic obviously.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, we’re finally together… – I’m not going to loose you again!” Harry pleaded, “you have to trust me in this matter, please! I promise I’ll sort this mess out but until then, for the love of magic, you have to hide!”
She gave both Hermione and Ron a meaningful glance. The two of them looked mortified. Harry grinned to himself. Obviously it wasn’t easy to hide anything from the Headmistress.
“I don’t think so, Ron,” said Hermione. “Her decades of living in Japan speak otherwise. Japanese witchards wear sacred robes, which immediately reveal anyone straying to the dark side of magic – the robes would pale and lose all colour. Whenever this happens to a witchard, they are immediately handed over to the authorities.
Harry ruffled his still damp hair. “Yeah that’s part of the problem… everyone and his brother believes, I have some secret power. Well I don’t. I had lots of support and lots of luck fighting Voldemort. I’m certainly no superhero and not the brightest student either, you know. Just one ‘Outstanding’ at my O.W.L. Mostly I’m mediocre.”
The rest of the train ride went by rather uneventfully. Harry, Cass and Draco entered the compartment together. Unsurprisingly neither Harry nor his friends brought up the subject of Harry’s sexual identity again in Draco’s presence. Ginny and Ron quickly absorbed themselves in a game of wizard’s chess. The others pulled out their books and started to read. Hermione’s book looked like a Muggle science book full of charts and diagrams. Cass tried to prepare for school by diving into ‘
“I know you’re gay, nothing wrong with that.” Harry said with an encouraging smile, “You and Tevin make a really nice couple,” he hesitated for a second and added, “I might even envy you a bit.”
Kingsley Shacklebolt's announcement caused a lot of commotion. As soon as the Headauror’s voice had faded the students started to talk and shout - within seconds the great hall was buzzing with excitement.
The dance party was already in full flow. Harry, Hermione and Ron were watching from the side-line. Flitwick instructed beginners in one corner, the rest of the floor was crowded by couples showing very different dancing levels. Some enthusiasts improvised with much attitude and very little skill, others were obviously well aware what they were doing. Traditional pure-bloods, Harry assumed. Well, some pure-blood traditions were rather nice, he had to concede. Draco and Cass, both clad in their usual style of crisp white shirts and black formal trousers whirled around the room. Harry was awestruck – so much grace and harmony, their body language so similar, it was as if one beautiful young person was dancing with their own shadow.
“You know who I am?” Harry asked back. How could a Muggle he had never seen before be familiar with his name?
“I was hoping you’d be hungry. It’s just stir fried veggies with creole spices, hope you won’t mind, it’s a bit hot? And I will fry some bacon to go with it, if you like? I’m a vegetarian, but I don’t mind cooking meat for others.”
“C.O.M.A.,” Harry read the title aloud – finally the other shoe dropped, “that’s the same one as the vomiting book from the library of No 12!”
But no silvery horse appeared. After several minutes without a reply, Harry was afraid to hesitate any longer, afraid that his continued absence might raise suspicions.
Harry was determined to keep it that way. Being friends with Draco Malfoy might be okay, as Hermione had just stated, but fancying Draco Malfoy? The thought alone was more than a bit disturbing. Harry was relieved he had finally gotten Josh out of his mind and certainly did not need another unwelcome and totally pointless crush... no, he just would not fall for Draco Malfoy, thank you very much.
“Well, in this respect the witcharding world is not doing such a great job either,” Hermione pointed out. “May I remind you, we’ve only recently ended a war… and we are just a small number of humans compared to Muggles. Anyway, Laddley has been living in New York for a while and after that in Switzerland. As a Muggle Liaison officer he had diplomatic immunity and reported directly to the Minister’s office. That’s why your dad hasn’t heard about him.”
Harry glanced at the door. Yes, just like he had expected by now, Frank was no other than Fake Film Star. His smile was as warm as Odie’s if a bit dazzling.
oh, maybe it was just a precaution for not being found out, as students were forbidden to leave the castle on weekday evenings?
“That won’t be necessary, Kreacher,” Hermione said, “Harry just needs to talk to those House-elves who clean the bed-rooms of the guest house. Not that many, I guess?”
“Ah – yes. I asked for the background of C.O.M.A., where the book has been stored, who had looked into it lately and how many copies exist altogether. Her ladyship obviously keeps records of her books, because she sent me a parchment with all the facts,” Hermione explained.
The mental healer, Harry had been strongly encouraged to see for some weeks after the war, had explained it all to him. Restlessness and being easily startled were to be expected, after what they all had been going through. Symptoms of Posttraumatic Magic Disorder the healer had called this.
“Yeah, that makes sense. But she was at Durmstrang, so she’s qualified for prime suspect, if you ask me,” Ron said. “Plus that woman is way too scary anyway.”
“Otto?” Harry stared at his owl who was sitting on the windowsill, nibbling at the handle. Harry opened the window and his pet flew inside.
“It’s mostly pure-blood families and big institutions who commission paintings and collect. The Malfoy collection of fine Magical Arts is one of the most famous in England, other families worth to be mentioned are the Bulstrodes, the Selwyns and the Shafiqs – these four are the only families that still collect big scale. Or at least, they did before the war. The Malfoy fortune is frozen until Draco’s probation is over and I guess it’s the same for other pure-blood families. The fifth relevant private collection used to belong to the Ollivander family. But their paintings were rendered to the Ministry by Garrick Ollivander’s father, as his only son’s single talent and interest has always been wandlore. Since then the former Ollivander collection is stored at the Ministry archives, which happen to hold the greatest number of magical artefacts in the world.”
“And right you were, of course. I immediately asked for Professor Flitwick’s opinion, who is a true expert in Magical Arts. As soon as he took a closer look, he confirmed Headmaster Snapes suspicion and removed a fake painting, that had been put into the frame in front of the real magic portrait,” McGonagall pointed her wand at the empty backdrop in the gilt frame. “That’s when we realized, the Imagic of Albus Dumbledore was gone.”
To Harry’s utter amazement Pinkie the raptor shot out of the painting and went for the vile wizard, claws first and with an ear-piercing shriek. The bird was huge, at least as tall as Taurus Malfoy and not only armed with an enormous beak and razor-sharp claws, but he seemed to be searing hot as well. The temperature rose significantly with his appearance and soon enough all Harry could see was smoke and a blur of flickering orange feathers where Taurus Malfoy had stood next to the window.
“Now you might try yourself, Mr Malfoy,” Flitwick charmed Blaise’s pink away and added, “just point the wand at your shirtsleeve, yes, that’ll do.”
Harry sighed. Luna and Dean’s mutual attraction was plain to be seen. He needed to find out more about charmed pictures preferably before they started snogging, which might happen soon enough by the look of it.
“No worries, I promise to be careful,” he said, “don’t want to bother you any longer. Honestly, Madame Pomfrey – I’m ever so grateful for your care. You’re a star!” And he got up and hugged her.
In the course of the next week Harry, Hermione and Ron started what they called ‘Operation Imagic’. Each of them tried to get closer to their respective suspect after lessons to gather as much information as possible. Ron was most successful by far. Whether the reason was Josh’s past history with the Weasley family or just because Josh Jordan was openhearted and trusting in general, Ron was soon able to talk freely to Josh and ask any question he liked without raising suspicion, even when he brought up the topic of Magical Arts.
"Well, he seemed to be the friendliest of the flock. The other owls just stared and looked presumtuous, rather Malfoy-ish in fact. Otto looked… different, he’s the funniest owl I've ever seen. This stripe of darker feathers, don’t you think it looks a little bit like a tie?”
“He was fascinated by you – yet he pretended not to like you. Still it was very obvious to me. Mr Potter, I had to console a very disappointed Draco after the Sorting Hat had made up his mind about you. I have listened to meticulously detailed reports of each and every one of your Quidditch matches – and I assure you, I’m not even mildly interested in Quidditch! I sometimes had the distinct feeling of knowing far more about
“Honestly, Harry, you are far too modest for your own good,” Josh said shaking his head in disbelief, “but that makes you such a nice guy, I guess.” He gave Harry another one of his bright smiles and Harry was lost. Oh Merlin, how he was lost.
“We’ve got half an hour left – so it’s question time! Does anyone have problems with other defence spells? Now would be the time to ask and to practice some more.”
“You know what? Stop whining! You’re damn selfish, the two of you!” He was really annoyed. “I think it’s brilliant for Molly to get that job! Don’t you think it’s tough for her to be all alone at the Burrow, especially since we’ve lost Fred? Your mum raised you all – hell, she even raised me! And now she more than deserves an interesting occupation! Give her some credit! You should be damn proud of your mum instead of playing Moaning Myrtle!”
“I have to admit, at that time I had no idea what I had tripped over. But I could feel enough ancient magic in this tiny thing to know that it is precious and valuable. So I kept the stone and told no one about it. And finally, just a few days ago I got lucky.”
“I know,” Harry nodded towards the door, “they are my family of choice, plus all the other Weasleys. I owe them my life and my sanity,” he said and hesitated a bit before adding, “look, I’m so sorry, you felt you had to come out as well – it really wasn’t necessary. But the others will keep their mouth shut, if we ask them. I know you don’t want to talk about it.“
Harry did not even try to argue. She was right anyway and homework would probably keep his mind from worrying. They sat down to study in the common room, because Harry had pretended, he wanted to keep close to Daisy in case another message arrived. But that was mostly pretext.
“Ah, hullo Hermione, Ginny and Ron,” waving to Harry’s friends, Hagrid finally let go of a very crumpled Harry, “good to have you all back at Hogwarts! It’s going to be a great year, with all the changes… just wait and see.” Hagrid grinned, but seemed to hesitate a bit at the sight of Draco and Cass standing side by side with his favourite students.
Just in time Harry had remembered to inform Josh. He had excused himself under the pretext of having to call at school and got out of the house. The back garden was secluded enough for Harry to conjure his Patronus unspotted, thus preventing three guys in weird clothes from disturbing this perfectly respectable Muggle neighbourhood.
. I’m certainly not depending on a fake letter,” Harry said with as much confidence as he could master.
Right in front of his eyes was the sight he had dreaded to come across for some time now: Ginny and Draco cuddled together on one of the arm chairs, hugging and snogging. They didn’t even realize that someone –Harry!– had opened the door, so engrossed were they with each other. Although the ceiling lights were out, Harry was in no doubt. Ginny’s signature hair of auburn red and Draco’s white blond head were easy enough to identify even in the soft glow of security lamps only.
“Professor Laddley is such a good teacher, Harry,” she said earnestly, as if she were in a place to assess teachers, “pity you don’t take Muggle Studies.”
“– a deardevil, right?” Harry nodded, “Yep, that’s how Gryffindors approach life!” He grinned at Carter. “I think it’s actually nice to have friends or family members from different houses. Diversity is not just about gender, you know… it takes all sorts of witchards. Wouldn’t it be boring, if we were all alike?”
Odie started to cut some peppers and mushrooms. “I hope you’re not too hungry, Harry? We’ll have to wait for Frank and David. They’re both very peculiar with their personal hygiene and take ages for a shower! If this house didn’t have three bathrooms, I’d probably brush my teeth at the sink every morning.” Odie grinned. “I guess that’s the price one has to pay for a handsome partner.”
“The thing is, whenever Draco was feeling the side-effects badly, at the very same time the tracker would report a false-positive location.”
“Yeah, I guess so… but certainly the A.D. must be different?” Harry said. “Having said that – don’t you have to be at work? I mean… Andromeda could have asked me to come earlier, I was free all morning.”
Harry murmured something about feeling slightly better to avoid further questions. It did not improve his mood, that Draco seemed to be very subdued as well and hardly spoke a word. More than once he caught Draco staring, but as soon as Harry met his eyes Draco blushed and lowered his gaze.
“I’ll see you again in the evening, dear,” said Narcissa Malfoy, “Try to focus on your lessons for now, will you?” She smiled at Cass before turning towards Harry.
“How’s Abe?” Neville asked Hagrid, looking at the inn’s owner who had walked to Laddley’s table, “and what’s he got to discuss with our new Muggle Studies teacher?”
Soon enough it was time to change for the ball. Harry had been quite clueless what to wear for weeks. A gown was out of the question. He had tried it but, unlike Ron, he felt totally uncomfortable in a dress. Ignoring the ball’s motto was also no option. In the end Hermione had saved him just a few days ago.
She nodded thoughtfully. “I suppose I could talk to Dean – he’s doing awfully well at this year’s Charms lessons... but I’m not allowed to talk about the investigation… I would need McGonagall’s or Flitwick’s permission.”
“Of course I would, Harry!” Tommy said fiercely, “but he did not. And I can take it, no need to start a fight about it.”
and gasped. “It’s awfully late! We really need to hurry, if we still want to have some breakfast before our first lesson today! Which is D.A.D.A, Ron! Good bye, Professor, good bye Ms Silver – I hope your request will be granted!” And she shoved both Harry and Ron towards the door.
“Oh.” Tommy looked a bit disappointed. “Sorry. I guessed, I might not have heard you correctly before, Professor. With all the noise in the pool, having water in my ears, you know? I just thought, I might have misunderstood… what sorts of people exactly don’t you want in that pool?”
“Well, finally August was closing in and we were told to get ready for the journey homewards. Social calling stopped, everyone settled in their own frame nicely. Albus was with us, or so we thought. I must say, I was rather surprised he was sleeping soundly for the last few days at the archives and during all of the train trip – we used the Hogwarts Express, came together with the actual first-years right at the beginning of September.”
“With pleasure, Mr Potter, with great pleasure!” Flitwick said, “Please tell Ms Granger that I am looking forward to have a go at the incident board with her! As Lady Library’s lover she is in a unique position for doing research… tell her to see me at my office any time after breakfast, will you?”
After seemingly endless consideration he decided to check every window facing the yard. Beginning with the ground-floor windows Harry moved slowly and with uttermost care alongside the wall on the ground. All of those windows were closely shut. If he remembered correctly, they belonged to the pub’s kitchen and storage room. It was a bit weird that it was dark behind the shutters. Come to think of it, there was no noise to be heard from the pub at all? Maybe the pub was closed on Thursday nights?
“Congratulations! That was the correct answer to a trick question,” Harry explained to a startled Cass, “If you had made the mistake of actually naming just one book, Hermione would have filed you as ‘illiterate’ – like the rest of us.”
“Laddley blames father for his brother’s mental illness, I know that much. But why would he want to punish
O’Malley nodded, “I’ve met Professor Laddley… Harry, I know what has happened and I may tell you –the Headmistress explicitly said, that I could– I’ll work with him regularly… and not on my swimming skills. But this is confidential information and I’m not going to say another word... understood?”
“Hi,” Draco said self-consciously, “sorry, I’m a bit early…” his voice trailed off and they stared at each other incredulously.
Now Otto was incapacitated for days and Harry had no means of contacting Draco. In the absence of Otto, what would Draco do? Would he think Harry had abandoned him when no more letters arrived? Would he try to contact Harry? Or return on his own? Would he turn up right within Taurus Malfoy’s grasp? Harry was frightfully aware of that possibility. Thoughts like these kept him awake for hours at nighttime.
Harry was fully attentive now. He sat straight and watched closely as a slightly uncomfortable Draco Malfoy stepped next to Flitwick, who continued, “Mr Malfoy will be so kind as to be our canvas for today’s lesson.”
“For Merlin’s sake, I hope we will! Amanda and Serena most certainly were not fooled for a second as well,” said McGonagall, “they knew exactly what they were doing… I trust we will know more, as soon as they get back… it just seems to take them a little longer than we guessed.”
“Draco will not be able to do much for her at school, I am afraid,” Ms Malfoy said with concern, “If I am not completely mistaken, Cass won’t be sorted to be a Slytherin – in fact, I would not be surprised at all, if she were meant to join your house, Mr Potter. She is a very brave young woman. That is why I wanted to talk to you. I want her to have an ally at Gryffindor house, in case she is the first Malfoy to wear red ties. Headmistress McGonagall will certainly do what she can to protect her, but no teacher has ever been able to control the dynamics between houses or within houses – neither the friendships nor the rivalry. I know students can be very cruel and I want Cassy to enjoy those two years of Hogwarts that lie ahead of her.”
Hermione gave Harry a suspicious glance and said, “No need to be rude, Harry… but of course it’s your decision, whether you want some company or not.”
After minutes of tied fighting, the stags withdrew from each other. Both trotted away, stopped, stared at each other – and charged again. The colliding antlers sent sparks up in the still dark sky and the Patronuses fought without one being able to wear the other down. Again they desisted from each other, put some space between them – and charged once more. Their third fight was as close as the first and second, it was obvious that neither of them could win this duel.
“Wow, that’s really cool – how many copies can I store at the same time?” said Harry before he took the copy back into his wand.
Harry’s heart beat furiously when he reached the first floor corridor behind the boxes – and certainly not for having climbed one flight of stairs. He strolled along peeking into the boxes. Most of them were not taken yet, the curtains open towards the corridor.
Ron looked confused. “What do you mean? After all that’s happened at the pub, you won’t be allowed to fly without backup! Forget it, no way!”
Later on, teaching at Hogwarts and forced to see a Mental Healer, Laddley started to regret his partaking in the crime and became ready to confess. Taurus Malfoy realized his accomplice’s fading loyalty and consequently tried to get rid of him. The fake barkeeper simply spiked Laddley’s drink, the butterbeer he always had before disapparating to see his brother at St Mungo’s.
– in fact, it’s quite tragic. He has a mentally ill brother living permanently at St. Mungo’s. As long as their mother was still alive, Laddley could stay abroad. But she died last spring and now Laddley is the only family member left. He visits his brother every weekend.”
“Fuck’s sake!” Harry shouted. Looks like he needed to take another shower before apparating to Tonk’s cottage for his usual Friday lunch followed by baby-sitter duties.
Harry pitied her quite a bit. All the changes at school, the missing Imagics and now the trouble with Laddley as well – her first year as Headmistress was running anything but smoothly. Would the Board of School Governors hold her responsible for having accepted someone as unfit for teaching as Laddley? Harry sincerely hoped she would not be in trouble.
“Lucky you,” Harry grinned back. He had been used to girls fawning over him for years. But having adoring male fans touched him more than he had expected… even without Draco complaining about it.
But those were not the only Imagics present. Once again Severus Snape’s Imagic was sitting in the frame propped up on an aisle next to the suite of chairs and sofas. Harry was much amused by the fact that the suspicious black poodle was sitting comfortably on the Imagic’s lap. Snape must have overcome his aversion of dogs pretty quickly, seeing that he petted the poodle quite fondly.
Ron and Hermione agreed with Harry on informing McGonagall about C.O.M.A. and let her decide how to proceed concerning Madame Pince. None of them was too keen on talking to Hogwarts' librarian as she was prone to being rather grumpy. Probably the grumpiest of all staff members. Therefore Harry wanted to talk to McGonagall first.
Harry stood up abruptly. “You get it, right? We finally know what has happened, but even if we catch Taurus Malfoy, he made sure we’ll have no witness to prove it! This drives me nuts! We can’t just wait until Laddley regains consciousness!”
“Completely destroyed, it’s probably for the best.” Aberforth shrugged. “The inn was in ruins after the Death Eaters were done with it, many items were gone… I was so glad that Ariana’s portrait survived, but Imagics are pretty indestructible of course.”
Cass listening in felt different, because she too was queer. Harry was pretty sure, she had outed herself to lessen his embarrassment – in spite of being so keen on her privacy. Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. He really wasn’t very good at accepting support.
Now Harry was puzzled. “But… Ms Malfoy insisted you wanted to keep your story private? And you seemed to be pleased when I assured you I wouldn’t talk about it?”
When the ground floor rooms were finally tidy enough for his taste, Harry decided to renovate and refurbish his chosen bedroom. He took the heavy old hangings of Slytherin green silk down and painted the walls in a calming shade of greenish blue instead, a colour by the odd name ‘Duck Egg’ which still looked rather nice. The old wardrobe and the fitted shelves were stripped from dark paint coat and now shone in a honey shade of natural ash. Finally he decided to treat himself to a new bed and spent an absurd amount of money on a luxurious king-size with a mattress made of so many layers that he felt a little bit like ‘The Princess and the Pea’. Or rather the prince.
“No, that won’t be necessary, thanks. I’ll be fine – it’s only climbing down the stairs that’s still a bit of a plight, but I’ll manage.”
Harry sipped at his drink. “Tough for Aberforth, that the pub has been destroyed twice in one year! He told me, that he’s determined to rebuild again, as soon as he’s well enough to supervise the construction.”
“Wow, guys and girls – we have to split you up, you’re far too many to get into the pool all at once!” Harry shouted over the crowd.
Ron stopped. He looked intrigued. “But how can you even say that? And be so damn sure about it? You haven’t exactly spent much time together – I mean, outside of a classroom, just the two of you? What Hermione calls ‘quality time’, right?”
Finally! Finally he kissed Draco… and his lips were soft… and tasted sweet… and this felt good, oh so very good. Draco gave a surprised little laugh before he pulled Harry close and slowly parted his lips.
“It’s such a relief,” she said with a sigh, “Kingsley Shacklebolt’s testimony did it in the end. Josh insisted on asking him and I’m ever so glad I finally agreed. He’s such a nice guy, Josh, isn’t he?”
He opened the door of the common room and was very disappointed to find the Wizard’s Wood gone and some other, smaller painting in its place. He had so hoped to see Daisy again.
They stared at each other, taking measure. The pure hatred and viciousness in those grey eyes were far from any disdain Harry had seen in the real Draco’s gaze at any given moment. He was more aware than ever that Draco had never truly hated him, not even when they were still fighting like crazy.
. “Well, I think, it’s time to close this lesson. Class is dismissed except for Mr Zabini who will come with me to my office to discuss detention.”
The highly unusual sight of two members of staff –one of them being the Headmistress– approaching a students’ table made the noise ebb down and the Great Hall fell silent. McGonagall and Madam Pince stopped in front of Hermione, who turned pink and blurted,
he regains consciousness at all,” Flitwick added gravely, “don’t forget his condition is very serious, he might even die.”
Harry had finally brought himself to talk to Ginny about their relationship or whatever was left of it. When he had asked her, how she felt about them being just friends, she first stared at him – until to his immense relief, she started to laugh. No, she assured him, she had no desire to hook up again. Her final verdict stung a little but Harry was still relieved.
“Seriously?” Harry crossed his arms in front of his chest, “You don’t talk to me for two days –no fucking word for Merlin’s sake!– and this is the first thing you have to say to me?” He shook his head, “You’re such a jerk. Once and for all I think Josh Jordan is an excellent teacher and a fine chap as well – but I’m not into him, okay?”
“I know the sound of your footsteps!” A rather dishevelled looking Hermione shouted. She glared at his coat. “Where do you think you are going without us?” Hands on her hips, she was wearing nothing but a large maroon pyjama-shirt and her hair was… well, very bushy indeed. Harry stared at her pale legs and was immensely grateful that the shirt was long enough to cover her female parts.
Close to midnight Harry and Ron still waited for the search party’s return in the eighth-years’ common room. Ron was stretched out on the Persian carpet in front of the fireplace but Harry lounged on a sofa, keeping his distance to the fire. He had always loved to stare into flames and listen to the soft cracking of smouldering logs, but since the disaster at the pub, he found open fires slightly unsettling. He had felt the same at Flitwick’s office this afternoon. Well, eventually he would get comfortable around a fireplace again.
