Several more hours it takes, to make the journey back. Now that they know what is possible in Snowdonia, the men watch the shapes in the dark more closely, as if convinced that, at any moment, those slitted eyes that have not moved in hundreds of years will slide open and pierce the night. Draco was like that in the early days, too. Half-afraid, half-hopeful, scanning each mountain face and fancying himself worthy enough to witness the waking of these creatures who have never woken for anyone before.
Harry unfolds the paper he left him, and scrawled inside is indeed the address of the Amber Tap. He refolds it and stuffs it into his jean pocket.
A pang of guilt racks Harry. He had been so caught up in Draco and Hogwarts that he had completely forgotten about the news until they announced it.
"But you definitely shattered them all." Harry waves his hand at the emptying tables and chairs. "Did you see them all standing and clapping for you?"
Some run up and ask, “Do you need help with these, sir?” referring to the small stack of paperbacks Malfoy’s holding in one hand.
He reappears at the gate of Andromeda’s house; it seems smaller in the dark and cold, its cobbled bricks and gently sloped roof vague outlines in the night. Harry draws his robes closer to his body and walks down the path to the front door. The sitting room light is on, and Harry can hear piano music through the walls. Andromeda must have charmed the instrument again. She likes a bit of background noise while she knits by the fire.
The shifting grains of sand unsteady their feet, but Draco stubbornly stabilizes himself, huffing a little under the strain. The last brood predates even Amira’s tenure at the Refuge, so the only knowledge they have about the hatching process rests in the detailed records of dragon keepers of decades past. And the one tasked with studying them, and with the delivery, is Draco.
“You were right, she isn’t my dream anymore.” He pauses. “But the War taught me that dreaming isn’t what counts, it’s the choosing that does. So I’m choosing this - I’m choosing her.”
“How do you two know Draco, then?” She glances at the empty glasses all around the rest of the table. “And the rest of your party?”
Eventually, even under the strange circumstances, the siren call of the rain lulls Draco to oblivion.
“Oh.” Harry never knew Narcissa to be particularly altruistic. But then again, he’d thought that about Malfoy too.
Malfoy allows his hand to be held for a split second longer than Harry thought he would. “I look forward to it then,” he says without a single note of sarcasm in his voice. He promptly turns on his heel, disappears down a side alley, and is gone with a
Spring comes. The streams flush with snowmelt, and on their banks, the wildflowers begin to bud. Once shriveled and gray, the grasses fill and thicken with green - and when it rains, a sweet smell lingers on the wind for days afterward. When Draco walks the valleys and hills, now, the foxes rustle the brush. When he walks the birch forests, deer dart at the corners of his vision. Snowdonia unfurls like long petaled blossoms beneath his feet, and the clouds above crisscross the bright sky.
Harry watches some neighborhood children, dressed up in puffy winter coats and caps, play around in the snow. A few are working together to build what looks to be a snow fort and a few others are lugging a sled down the street -
Adrenaline makes Harry's heart pump, makes his legs work faster and faster. He's moving so fast his breaths come up in a puff of steam and quickly blow past him. The air is cutting. The voices around him are loud. He doesn't dare look behind to see how far Lucas has gotten. He doesn't dare peel his eyes off of the sight in front of him: their collapsed fort, Gordon and Robin cheering him on, and the empty spot where their wands used to be.
The cashier brings his coffee and Harry sips it gratefully while he examines the coffee shop and waits. The only patrons are a business woman eating a sandwich and watching something on her laptop and a teenage boy texting with a half-finished fruit parfait in front of him. The shop itself is small, with some tables lining the window like the one Harry is sitting at and some couches sitting on top of a plush rug in the middle of the floor. Classical music plays on the speakers, barely audible over the various machinery behind the counter. The smell of something chocolate-y drifts over to Harry from the oven in the corner and his stomach reminds him that he didn’t eat breakfast.
Unchanging and eternal, Draco had thought of Snowdonia. A constant in a world of fickle forces and the vagaries of life.
“Do you still remember how to ice skate?” Malfoy asks without turning around. Harry looks out the window and realizes he’s looking at the Great Lake on the horizon.
Though his parents were fond of trips in his childhood - taking him to see French chateaus, the ancient sites of Egypt, the golden temples in Thailand - they had only taken him to the ocean once. The Mediterranean, during their trip to Italy when Draco was very young - young enough to only remember a single image: looking over the rocks, stacked to his feet, at that impossible blue.
They sit in silence for a few, heavy moments. The house is dark and quiet, not even Kreacher’s feet scrabbling on the wooden floor can be heard.
They all have drinks in their hands, which explains how drunk they look in it. Hermione is doubling over in laughter, almost spilling the contents of her cup, and Ron’s hand is resting on the small of her back, his face twisting in barely contained glee and amusement. Harry stands to the side of both of them, and he’s laughing too, but not as hard. He’s mainly watching his two best friends fall over themselves laughing with a smile on his face - eyes warm.
The two make eye contact and hold it all while Draco takes the flowers from him and hold them close to his chest. Their fingers touch briefly in the exchange, and it sends shivers through Harry's body. He can sense the others behind him, watching his every move and analyzing their interaction.
The report still wasn’t done by the time Robards popped in again on his way home, so he instructed Harry to stay late and get it done.
"Poor dear, that's a lot of children for even two people to handle." Molly adds, smiling wryly and looking pointedly at her children. "Arthur and I could barely handle seven!"
"Er, sorry about that. Listen, did you...notice anything strange last night? I'm afraid I...don't remember much." It's not completely a lie. Harry's fairly certain that his memory is mostly intact, but if he was awake when his sweater was taken off, then maybe he's wrong.
He's never really met with any of the neighbors on his street. They sometimes host block parties or sell cookies and lemonade in the summers, but Harry's never been. He justifies it to other people - mostly Hermione - by claiming that his neighbors might be freaked out over a neighbor they never knew they had joining their events, but it's really because he's never in the mood to shoot the breeze with random Muggles.He’s barely ever in the mood to shoot the breeze with his friends.
"Congratulations," Draco tells them through the chaos, smiling at them warmly. "Have you told Rose?"
He takes her hand and they share a formal shake, as if they're potential business partners meeting for the first time. "Likewise, Ms. Weasley."
The gully between Draco and the others shrinks a bit. When before, Draco could see the other side, but never cross the staggering jump, he joins in on the fun, now - ribbing and joking and flashing his silver tongue. And when he banters with Prasad, he finds it hard to stop. Especially when Harry is laughing and laughing and looking at Draco like he never wants to look anywhere else.
“But…” A note of doubt enters his voice. “I’ve been rethinking that recently. The whole Auror thing. Especially with all the rumors about neo-Death Eaters...”
"Here." He slides a stack of files across the table to Harry. "Do you mind processing the intel on the members as they come in and make sure our records are up to date?"
One hits Malfoy's midsection, causing him to recoil a little bit, the second hits his leg, and the third actually reaches Harry's goal and hits the blonde git squarely in the face.
Lucy has returned to her parents and now joins the rest of them in eagerly watching the match and anticipating the winner. Both Draco and Harry have a broom in hand: two Cleansweeps, which are extraordinarily old school by now, what with all the fancy "Pulsar 3000"s and "Andromeda 4000"s nowadays, but they still get the job done. They're reliable and have the same specs as each other, which is all they really need for this contest.
Harry and Hermione try not to snort at that. Jazz is a Muggle genre invented by African Americans. Draco is the purest a pureblood wizard can be and a white, British man to boot.
Outside, the moon shows its face to Harry. Its light creeps through Draco’s window and touches him too, a silver afterthought.
“No thank you. Just take your seats, please.” Malfoy brushes past them and breezes into the classroom. The kids follow suit all-too eagerly. Only a few glance at Harry and none of them offer to help with the ridiculously and probably pointlessly thick Muggle textbooks he’d managed to lug up several staircases.
All the words that had been bubbling up, frothing in his throat, die on Draco’s tongue. The slump of his shoulders, the deprecating smile - Draco has only seen Harry like this once before. A man, defeated by love.
Molly is the first one to break the silence. "Merry Christmas to you too, Draco. Welcome to the Burrow." To Harry's immense relief, she says nothing more and simply smiles the same kind smile like always and gestures to the massive, cushy couch they bought a few years ago to fit all the new family members. There is only one spot left, and it looks like a squeeze for two people. "Sit, sit, the food isn't going to be ready for a while."
Those same hands touch Draco any chance they get. When cooking supper together, they slide along Draco’s waist as Harry squeezes by. When on a hike and Draco stumbles on a loose bit of rock, they shoot out to catch him. And when kissing, well, they are everywhere and endless.
Draco’s affections come swift and easy after that - like all this while he has been holding his breath, and now he’s finally letting go.
But Harry is a simple man, and maybe a little bit dumb. "And save you a loss? Not a chance." He stands, with Lucy still in his arms. "After you."
"Yep. It's a popular one already, if you couldn't tell. Lots o' kids chose to stay just because of it."
"What do you mean?" Harry thinks back to the conversation he and Hermione had about Draco's playing midway through.
With one last look at Draco's prone outline and his mop of messy blonde hair sticking out from the blankets, Harry leaves the room and lets the door click softly shut behind him.
As soon as he turns the corner into the sitting room, the music stops. Andromeda is sitting in her favorite cushy chair, right in front of the fireplace, with her knitting piled in her lap and the basket next to her. Draco Malfoy is seated at the piano. Both of them are openly staring at Harry.
Harry squeezes back, but remains silent. By the light of the stars, Draco sees the pain rising from him like smoke - choking him thick and heavy.
And when Draco does finally appear on the stage, striding across with his powerful, long legs - seemingly elongated by the elevation of the stage - the crowd goes wild. Cheers, hearty claps, and indeed, some standing already.
Draco smiles. "Even when living in the Muggle world, I couldn't quite leave behind my upbringing. My mother loved to cook French cuisine - it was the only cooking she never allowed the house eleves to do growing up."
Harry chuckles weakly, remembering with a jolt his plans with Malfoy the next day. “I can’t, I’m sorry. But sometime soon. Next weekend?” He looks to Hermione for confirmation.
In the shocked silence that follows, Harry swears he can hear the dust settling. (Not really though, as the children are all eating on noisily, paying no attention to the adults.) Harry shovels a forkful of green beans into his mouth to keep himself busy.
In half and hour, they've transferred Edwards to Robards' office and are finally getting an explanation out of him.
No one answers. No one moves. Prasad looks between them like they’re watching a particularly rousing Quidditch match.
“Thanks for all your help. See you in two weeks, Draco?” Malfoy nods. “Merry Christmas, then. And to you, too.” She smiles at Harry.
His words seem to have set Draco alight. His eyes sparkle as they open wider than Harry's ever seen them. "Are you sure? A magical energy?" He digs into his small shoulder bag and produces a notebook. "Tell me everything, in as much detail as you can remember."
Outside, a wind picks up, its howl audible even inside. Though sunny, the sky is still gray as gravel, and the shrubs and grasses still shriveled and leached of color. Normally, on a day like this, Draco would be out shoveling manure, curing meat, or shoring up on wood. Something to get his hands on the dirt, in water, into something real.
“And now I’m researching definitive connections between magic and music.” Malfoy finishes with a little flourish with his hands.
“Welcome back!” The smallest one squeaks. He looks to be about 4 or 5 years old. When his eyes lands on Harry, he asks, “Who are you?”
“I’ve always wished I could ride him,” Thomas says. “Weird how we have unicorns but not pegasi, eh?”
The older girl and the older boy that the woman had walked in with scramble for the door in a panic. Malfoy asks above the pandemonium, “Where are you two going?”
Headmistress McGonagall, in the years that she's occupied the Headmistress/master office, has really made it her own. The entire space is neater, cleaner, with fewer papers and knickknacks and other magical artifacts lying about. The desk still sits in front, as well as two armchairs facing it. The bookshelves form a perimeter around the room, and the portraits line the back. A nice, ornate rug is the only thing decorating the floor and the fireplace burns bright and crackles in the silence of the room.
Two days pass, and Snowdonia thaws a little, at their feet. Draco leads the group panting up hills, scrambling down valleys, and wading through streams. They catch fish, they climb the scraggly trees, and they laugh at each other among the branches.
Cups go up full and are set down empty again. The tequila lingers in Harry’s throat as a slight burning sensation, but he bears it. More shots, more conversation, more talk of the pregnancy - minutes seem to pass, or maybe hours? The burning sensation has moved down, lower and lower until it reaches his stomach, warming it up. Lucy is asleep. It might be Harry’s imagination, but it seems like, for every shot he takes, Draco takes two more. Even through the thickening fog settling in his mind, Harry feels concern for him.
It seemed like a good idea at the time - finally, literally since Harry and Ginny split, he wouldn't be going to a Burrow Christmas alone.
“What do you want?” The man asks him, his arms folded, looking at Harry, unimpressed with what he sees.
“Don’t worry, Draco. Take off your pack already and relax. Might as well.” They shuffle some papers into the file cabinet behind them. “Mint?” They gesture at the bowl full of them.
Molly blinks in surprise at being suddenly addressed, and nods her head. "Y-yes, it should be ready in forty-five minutes or so."
Newborn dragons, Draco quickly learns, are quite ugly. They are pale and bloodless, and the gleaming scales that lend their kind so much awe-inspiring beauty are merely colourless etches in the flesh.
Beneath the Christmas tree are scattered dozens and dozens of presents - big and small and with wrapping paper in every pattern and color imaginable. It's a true testament to the Weasleys' growing wealth that they are able to compile so many gifts each year. Arthur has been promoted multiple times since the War, Molly has begun to sell custom sweaters with impressive commercial success, Bill is a regional manager for Gringotts, Fleur is a model for a popular Wizarding cosmetics company, Charlie and Ion are eking out a good living at the dragon reservation, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is a smash-hit abroad, Percy is a higher up in the International Magical Office of Law in the Ministry, Audrey is the youngest member on Wizengamot in centuries, Hermione is a leading activist and speaker for nonhuman creature and werewolf rights, Ron is an Auror, and Ginny is the internationally acclaimed Seeker for the Holyhead Harpies. The days in which the Weasley's were known solely for their poverty are over.
“It’s okay, Andromeda.” Malfoy interrupts her and stands up. “I should be going, anyways.” The fear that Harry saw earlier was gone - hidden as something blank slides into place and replaces it. Malfoy grabs his coat - his
"Wha-" He stops and stares at the unassuming, unmarked package. "You didn't have to. I didn't get anything for you."
A beat. "Fine. I'll fuck off. Just don't talk to us - especially not 'mione - until you get your shit together, alright?" With that, he turns on his heel and stomps out of Harry's cubicle, not bothering to close the door behind him.
“Her scales act as insulation, and no, it is not dangerous, especially with the Refuge keeping watch. Though before, when dragons freely flew the Earth, there was some level of danger due to their open nest design. But the eggs need to be kept cool to survive - in the warmer months, the dragons bury them in the sand.”
Charlie gives his two cents, glancing at Ion. "Romania's already been working on something similar for a while - their Ministry of Magic, or their equivalent anyway, is pretty liberal."
Madame Maxine may be making an appearance as well, taking Hagrid along with her. Ever since becoming acquainted at her and Hagrid’s wedding, she’s been quite taken with Draco - they have tea every other week. Harry thinks they have some kind of French heritage-related kinship.
The rest of the afternoon passes with similar conversations - sometimes technical as the students interrogate Malfoy on his research, sometimes meaningless and playful banter. The only awkward moment was when Stella asked Malfoy, "Do you have someone special in your life right now?" To which Malfoy answered, albeit after a coughing fit and an obvious blush, "No-! Not that it's any of your business as my students."
He relaxes a bit, leans back in his chair, and reaches down to stroke Cane. They listen to the crackling of the flames for a bit, and, in the direction of the Forest, Harry hears rustling trees and wonders if it’s Gawp. Cane snores openly and his chest rises and falls with an intoxicating rhythm. Snow has started falling again, and the snowflakes cast shadows with the light slanting through the window.
A flicker of movement draws his attention to the picture frame on his desk - the one of Hermione, Ron, and Harry during the charity gala - only when his eyes settle on it, he realizes that both Hermione and Ron seemed to have left the frame entirely. Picture-Harry swirls the champagne in his flute, his eyes darting around the hall. The warm smile usually resting easy on his features has gone, leaving only a nervous grimace in its place.
As they enter, dozens of eyes swivel to focus on them - but they don’t leave. Whispers erupt, some laughter, some sly looks. Malfoy speeds up his pace, nose turned up, clearly embarrassed to be seen by his adoring students in such a state.
Ever since Harry mentioned offhand to her a few years ago that he was trying to get in touch with his Chinese heritage again - and the memories associated with it that his father had passed down to him - Andromeda has been expanding her culinary borders. All of her own accord, she started researching - buying recipe books, researching online, even going to London’s Chinatown to taste test and shop. And every two weeks or so, she’ll try her hand at an authentic Chinese meal for Harry.
But Harry continues, trampling through as he always does. “I’ve thought about you a lot since the War. I was so angry in the early years.” He takes a breath. “I never wanted to see you again.”
Draco makes sure to address each of them personally to thank them for coming, for listening, for donating. He looks exhausted - hair plastered with sweat, bags deep and cutting on his face, and shoulders slightly slouched - but still he forges on. At the donation table, Belle and Ava begin filling up what Harry counts as their fifth cardboard box of the night with notes and checks. Harry can only imagine what they've already received electronically.
"That's okay. I just happened to see it while I was out." That's a lie. Harry racked his brain to think of a suitable present for hours and made a special trip to Hogsmeade yesterday morning to acquire it.
When he wakes, the world is still steeped in darkness. It isn’t a nightmare that has woken him, but something else, for once. Voices, outside, toward the back of the cottage. Draco turns his back to the sound, trying to chase his lost fatigue, but the conversation comes through, clear as the night sky.
“Yes.” Slowly, leisurely, Draco extricates himself from Harry’s embrace and stands, stretching out his legs. “Let’s go, sleepyhead.”
When he finally makes it into the warmth of the club, he realizes that the mood inside is similar; the conversations are subdued and the people move with less energy than they did before, preferring to stand or sit in one place and stare at the empty stage.
“...Good work.” It comes so quietly, so haltingly, that for a moment Harry think he’s misheard. He glances over at Malfoy and he’s lying perfectly still, his eyes closed and his face peaceful.
Harry rolls onto his back and sticks a leg out from under the blanket. The room is cold. The heating charms must have worn off.
A week passes, then two. After a few days of training, Harry seems to settle into his new job; he organizes the paperwork and makes schedules and charms every guest that steps through the doors.
They stop by Malfoy’s place to pick up the textbooks - Harry’s carrying the heaviest ones again - and head straight to class.
Outside the room, Harry suddenly hears an avalanche of footsteps and muffled shrieks. Draco groans and nestles further into the covers. It must be present opening time.
Harry thinks wryly to himself. Hermione has been on friendly terms with him for an even shorter period of time - since last night, essentially. But aloud, he only says, “Yeah, but it doesn’t feel that way.”
Hermione tells him about her future plans for her nonprofit, which is very close to relaunching. She doesn’t ask, but Harry offers to be a spokesperson for it, anyways, and when he does, she beams at him.
"Pl-please....Don't send me to Azkaban..." He pleads, eyes meeting Harry's wild and desperate. "I'll do anything. Please....Ple-ease...."
Draco takes him outside, shows him the path shooting off from the main circle. Leads him to the semi-circle of cabins at the end.
He checks the time again and realizes he'd better make his way to the conference room soon. He doubts anything said in the meeting will actually be pertinent for him, and honestly no one would miss him if he didn't show up, but he's grateful for any distraction at this point.
he thinks. Snow in London has come late this year - something attributed to Global Warming by scientists, according to the snippets of Muggle news Harry would catch while dozing in front of the telly.
Subtly, Harry uses some magic to help him slow Rose down. The pair walk back to Grimmauld house, and Harry Floos them back to her house.
Once it's secured in place, directly under the spotlight, the same stagehand who pushed the piano it completely on his own goes back offstage and proceeds to to add a piano bench to join it. Next, with one fluid motion, he opens the top and props it up with a thin stick. Harry's amazed it doesn't break as soon as he takes his hands off. Finally, his job done, he leaves the stage the opposite way he came, and the stage is empty again, save for the new piano and bench combo.
It’s not a small thing. It carries a weight. The light picks up on it, making the glass shine and the contents pale.
"Shall we sit here?" Arthur asks the group, his hand resting on the chair back. It's one of the tables farthest from the stage, but seeing as the group didn't think to get here early like everyone else, they will have to settle. Once seated, Harry is tasked with getting drinks.
He doesn't have any words for her, only a slightly strained groan. His eyes are shut tightly, and even in the dim light, Harry can see that his face is red - either from exertion or from embarrassment, it's hard to tell.
Harry walks over to his desk, plops into his chair, and scrambles to find a bit of parchment and a pen that works; he uses quills at the Ministry to show that he
Harry would like to do nothing more than shoot the breeze with his best friend for a few hours, but he knows Ron can't afford to take breaks. Not when he's leading the field teams.
Though Harry's craning his neck, squinting his eyes, trying his absolute best to spot the Snitch, nothing sticks out to him. Not much movement, except from the gnomes beneath them, who are looking up at them warily, and from the Weasleys, who are still standing there watching them. The children wave, and Harry gives them a quick wave back.
Just as he bites into his last cookie - butterscotch, his favorite kind - Harry hears the sound of the Floo activating from outside his room.
Idly, Harry rubs the dusty framed picture of him, Hermione, and Ron with the corner of his sweater. They took it a few years ago, at some kind of fundraising event for Hermione's nonprofit - which has since closed down, but Hermione is currently working on getting it back up and running - but it looks like it could’ve been taken just yesterday.
Belle immediately moves away and gestures toward their table, her smile gracious. "Oh please, go ahead."
A minute passes. The sirens have gone away and the fire has died down a little bit, but the smoke it generates is still thick in the air.
As soon as Harry finishes the last “P,” Spotty swoops in, grabs the letter in her claws, and silently beats out of the room without being told. Harry sits back in his chair and prays.
The entire club waits with bated breath. Even Harry finds that he's unwittingly holding his breath in anticipation. Hermione gives his hand a little squeeze.
His fans come and go and Harry watches all of their interactions. It seems that many of his longtime, most devoted fans showed up tonight, judging from the way Draco would banter with them as if he's met them many times before. Many are crying when they approach them. Some burst into tears as soon as they hug him. The atmosphere is significantly more serious that it was during the Christmas concert, but the level of the fans' love remains the same.
Hagrid gasps and slams his cup down on the table, jolting Cane awake for a split second, before he huffs in annoyance and his head falls back on his arms. “Abou’ the baby, innit?”
Molly shakes her head. "Don't be sorry about that, dear. We were just concerned because, well, you haven't brought anyone over in a while."
Harry can’t think. His brain is foggy, muddled, and he can’t quite comprehend the sequence of events that just occurred - it seems like Malfoy is constantly running circles around him.  So he just mumbles an answer, “Hagrid’s,” and feels like he’s slowly sinking into the couch now that Malfoy isn’t sitting there too, helping him float.
They stand silent, watching the patch of dirt for a long time. So long that even some of their most vigilant “fans” begin to droop on the other side of the iron bars.
They separate and Ginny wastes no time in holding her hand out to Ma-Draco. "Nice to see you again, Malfoy."
The first rain of the year portends fresh growth, snowmelt flushing the streams, and all manner of creatures - magical and not - poking their heads from their burrows.
Malfoy is silent. He just stands there for several moments, mouth slightly open, before turning back around and continuing to walk.
Then, they walk into view, strapped up with various packs, one carrying a small cooler. They are so busy laughing and joking among themselves, that they barely look inside the building they’re walking towards, until they enter.
And when all the food has been eaten and Harry’s had two glasses of wine with Ron (Hermione sipping some tea), he stands up, hugs both of them, tells Ron he’ll see him tomorrow at work, and makes his leave.
Sometimes, their coworkers join them: Prasad, chattering and joking away, Walker, softly laughing, and Amira, touching her hand to Draco’s and smiling. If they notice any change, they don’t name it, but Draco sees the tenderness in the looks they give him. Or maybe that tenderness was always there, and now he finally knows to look.
"Harry, say the word, and I'll break his nose. And 'Mione will probably want to get a hit or two in too."
Draco's eyes are so dark. His blonde hair too - maybe it's the lighting, but it seems less platinum like it normally is, and more like a dirty blonde. His narrow nose, his sensuous pink lips, his slightly pointed chin; everything seems...different up close. But maybe it's just the alcohol talking.
"I-thank you." Draco flashes Harry an uneasy smile before he tears back the wrapping in quick, efficient strokes. Harry follows suit with his own present from Hagrid. He thinks it’s a snitch at first, but when it swings open on its hidden hinge Harry realizes it’s a pocket watch enchanted to vibrate gently at times that Harry can customize. From its accompanying note, Harry learns that Hagrid bought it for him in France while visiting his now-fiancee.
Mouth full of buttery biscuit, Harry manages to get out a muffled "Thank you." Kreacher doesn't react too much, simply bows and apparates away without another word. At Hermione's insistence, Harry has technically freed Kreacher, and he now technically works full-time in the Hogwarts kitchens. However, due to some drastic circumstances a year or two ago, Kreacher has been on extended leave from Hogwarts and has returned to Grimmauld place to take care of Harry. He doesn't really understand the loyalty because Harry is technically a half-blood and the godson of the Black family's greatest traitor - though he begrudgingly appreciates it while highly suspecting that it's also Hermione's secret handiwork.
Thankfully, he proceeds to do just that with minimal extra teasing. When the waitress comes back, Draco orders his fancy wine (You’ll love it, I promise, it’s one of the vineyard’s best years), a dish for himself called ‘Moules Manieres,’ and Harry’s dish, which he described to him as ‘a hodgepodge of meat and potatoes.’
Hermione begins. “Harry, we have something to tell you.” She threads her fingers through her daughter’s and husband’s.
“Hey, Lucas - and please, Harry is fine. Great job by the way. I learned a lot working with you and Sophia, even though I probably wasn’t much help.” Harry laughs.
Harry quickly folds up the note and sends Spotty off with it before he can think too much about what he has just done, but the regret creeps in as soon as Harry collapses back onto his bed.
"Well, I'm coming as your date, right? And I think w-we've known each other for long enough that...it wouldn't be..." he falters, "it wouldn't be weird, right?"
Draco's blushing so hard that he's visibly sweating again now. He avoids eye contact with Harry and instead stubbornly stares down at the table cloth.
But he doesn't say anything or acknowledge it at all - the only indication that anything's changed at all is the red dusting his cheeks and the tips of his ears as he passes Harry and leads him to McGonagall's office.
He approaches and takes a seat next to Draco. The latter rests his head on Harry’s shoulder, and they watch the waves and their tumble.
“And,” Harry whispers, “The apology you wrote to Hermione, after everything. That was all you.” He presses his thumb into the snake’s yawning maw.
Somehow, the thought settles Draco - that his mother also dreads the empty letters, and dull, careful small talk. That she stares too much at the vial as well, and touches it just to remember what it was like to touch the real thing. That she, too, walks her waking hours and lies unsleeping at night with torment and love warring in her heart.
It’s gotten to the point where she and Molly have a running rivalry for who can cook the closest to the James Potter from Harry’s memories. They’re an odd sight to behold in Chinatown: two bonafide white grandmothers walking the streets, haggling with amazing results, and dining at almost every single eatery available to them. Thanks to them, Harry’s gotten to taste not just food from the Hunan province - where his father was from - but also food from Sichuan, Canton, Shanghai, Xi’An, and more. Never in his life has he been so well-fed.
He cuts Harry off with a snarl, “Given my h-history? You th-think they would believe that I h-had no hand in th-this?”
Draco considers this. “I understand enough. You’re carrying through with it because you think you owe it. To her, to the Weasleys, to the world.”
Unused to this kind of high-society treatment, all Rose can do is giggle at Malfoy’s strangeness. “That tickles!”
When Harry looks at Sophia, she grins and announces proudly, "I'm offense with Stella. Gordon and Robin are taking defense and building our fort."
Draco begins flying away from Harry immediately, though it seems more like he's also searching rather than he's already found the Snitch. However, Harry doesn't want to take the risk - Draco was less distracted than him after the release - so he begins to cruise right behind him just in case it's the right direction after all.
He spots his sweater on the other side of the room, hanging off of something. When he pads over and unhooks it, he realizes it was covering a portrait of a man with a monocle and a pointy moustache. He looks miffed at being covered for probably the entire night, but grateful for being uncovered at the same time.
A hand shoots up. It's Jenny, one of the most veteran and respected people in the department, other than Robards and Kingsley. Harry's always liked her, though they never really have any contact with each other. Due to her experience, Kingsley's always sending her on high-level, top secret missions - the details of which even Robards can't access. Harry really only ever sees her back in the office once or twice the entire year.
He stands, stretches briefly, and heads downstairs to find something to eat. Recently, Harry has found himself skipping breakfast most days. Either he wakes up too late and has to quickly apparate to work, or he wakes up too early - 5:00AM, 6:00AM - and feels too queasy to eat until lunchtime.
"I know, I know." In hindsight, it might not have been the smoothest move, but Draco seems to have enjoyed himself regardless, and that's the ultimate goal, right? Maybe Harry is just trying to blindly justify himself.
Harry watches in horror as Malfoy doesn’t even struggle, doesn’t even bother to stand up on his own and walk, and doesn’t seem to acknowledge the ruling at all. He just lets himself be grabbed and dragged out the door like an empty luggage trolley.
“I think I understand, a little bit.” Harry pauses, then begins again, slowly this time, “Since before I was born, most of my life was already laid out for me. There was a prophecy. About someone killing Voldemort.”
But Jenny isn't backing down. Though Robards has wasted no time in raising his voice, standing up from his chair, and pacing angrily back and front in the front of the room, Jenny remains seated in her chair, her voice the same level, same tone, and her face the same expression as always - cool, collected, somewhat indifferent but not uninterested at the same time. Harry supposes that to go on the ultra-top-secret missions - which are rumored to be spy missions to the Ministries of different countries - she has had to learn how to keep her cool no matter which balding blockhead tries to speak over and silence her. "I agree with you that our tactics during the Second War were ineffective. But all that tells us is that we need to change it. And that's precisely what I'm advocating and have been advocating for since the First War, which you would know if you had been there for either of the two." She pauses a little bit to take a small sip of her water, time perfectly to let the insult fully sink into Robards' brain. And when it does, the effects are immediate and obvious: reddened ears, the clenching of the hands, and his quickened breath.
It’s long dark when Harry throws a pinch of Floo powder into the fireplace, announces, “The Granger-Weasley House” loudly and clearly, and steps through. Before Harry can gather his wits and stop his head from spinning, however, something collides into his legs and almost sends him back into the fireplace.
Harry laughs. "Hot chocolate, anyone?" The cold is really starting to seep through his clothes, and any kind of hot beverage sounds extremely attractive right now.
Draco takes some of the supplies, and Harry juggles the rest while still trying to change out of his pajamas. When they open the door, it is indeed Walker on the other side, the set of her shoulders tense.
They laugh at that, and suddenly Harry’s back in the Gryffindor boys dormitory again, staying up late with Neville and the rest, cracking jokes and giggling so loud the upperclassmen would pound on their door to get them to shut up.
"Bloody hell. What's happened?" Not that Harry really cares anymore. He's mostly just annoyed that his non-plans of laying in bed and feeling sorry for himself all day have been ruined.
“I knew you’d like it,” Draco smiles triumphantly. “See? It’s never too late to experience culture.”
She looks between the two men, both earnestly trying to curry her favor, and laughs - completely tickled by all the attention.
No, only the press is there, still circling and circling after so many years, never tiring of the chase. They clamor at the cemetery fence, a cacophony of camera shutters, interview requests, and frantic reporting.
mid-run in his scarlet robes - frames it, and hangs it up in the sitting room. At the end of the entire ordeal, Ron gets a promotion for his efforts, and relations with the Muggle Prime Minister improve due to the tireless efforts of Ash and Jenny to calm the Muggle population in the aftermath.
After discussing their trip to America for a little while - which cities they're visiting, what attractions they're seeing - a comfortable lull in the conversation descends on them. Harry looks over at Draco; he seems to be happier now that the conversation has moved on from him. Harry knows that everyone was just curious because no one had spoken to, or even seen Draco Malfoy since the War, but all the focused attention seemed to have tired Draco out quite a bit. Harry knows all too well what that feels like, so he squeezes Draco's hand in sympathy. The blonde looks at him, surprised, but not alarmed, and squeezes back. Harry can feel multiple people watching, trying to be subtle about it, but failing - Ginny being one of them
It isn’t a surprise; no one lives long after being Kissed, and Lucius Malfoy has lived past the average, anyways. Seven years. Draco gets dressed. He doesn’t bother checking himself in the mirror before leaving, he knows what he would see.
Draco’s smile wavers. "N-no. I don't think so. I mean, I'm not sure yet what will happen in the future, but for now I just want to focus on finishing up my research."
Harry turns to the horizon, to their friends and their flashing limbs. Above, the clouds part and unveil the sun.
Molly seems confused by the sudden change in conversation too. "Th-thank you, dear. Eat up, there's plenty left."
The look Harry throws at him. Like suddenly, he realizes he’s been feeding a snake. “Ron was right. Glad to know you’ll always be a prick.” He rises from the stone seat and trudges off into the darkness. The slam of the cottage door sends Draco’s heart skittering.
Suddenly, Harry’s all choked up. He can’t fathom why. “...Thank you. Thank you, it’s more than I deserve. And yeah, it’s been...a lot.”
By the end, Rose can kick off and land fairly safely, but the other children like Dominique or Lucy can't do much more than hover shakily a few inches off the ground. Teaching children isn't really Harry's strong suit - he neither actively likes nor dislikes it - but this is obviously where Draco shines. He teaches even more expressively, more animatedly, than he does with his teenage students at Hogwarts. His gray eyes shine in the dim lantern light, and Harry finds himself looking into them more often than he looks anywhere else.
“Ready?” Ginny’s announces the start now. Draco and Harry look at each other and their audience once last time. Ron is holding Rose, who gives them both two thumbs up. The rest of the children look on in awe.
Harry flings his door open and Draco Malfoy is standing there, in the flesh, on his doorstep with a bundle of flowers in his hand - Lilies. He's dressed up in a smart fitted shirt, slacks, and overcoat combo, and suddenly Harry can't meet his eyes.
The pounding at the door continues, and Draco grows more and more certain of the circumstances. “Harry, it’s an emergency, we need to go.”
They clean and pack up, and Draco isn’t allowed to help. So he goes to sit on the beach, pleasantly dry and warmed by the sun at his back - its light turning the dark sea to pale blue. Terns play in the surf, outrunning the tides, and gulls circle and cry across the frothing waves.
Robards shakes his head, his arms crossed and his face stern and condescending. What a bastard, Harry thinks. Jenny has at least ten more years of experience on him but he still treats her like a trainee at times. "No, they don't need to know about any of this. We're going to warn our community and encourage everyone to be on the lookout for suspicious activity."
The line between them stretches taut and with every breath, Draco hears its vibration - the song it spins out of nothing.
They laugh and Harry finds himself joining in. Even after all these years entrenched in the Wizarding community and in magic, both Harry and Hermione find themselves forgetting it all for a moment.
“As I promised last night, I’ve brought a few Muggle textbooks - mostly elementary physics - and several scores from my personal collection.”
Night passes. When it leaves, Harry rises silently, makes breakfast, eats some, puts the rest under a heating charm for when Draco wakes up later, and leaves for work.
He begins explaining the basics, and by the end, Harry thinks he has a pretty good grasp on Malfoy’s work. He first became interested in Arithmancy  in Hogwarts, and after he finished serving his five year sentence in Azkaban, he began making and playing music again and realized that music theory greatly coincides with some aspects of Arithmancy. “In fact,” Malfoy told Harry, his eyes bright, “Most successful musicians all around the world have been witches and wizards!”
. Our first priority right now is to secure the safety of the victims - Muggle orphans - and to thoroughly investigate the scene.”
Kingsley beings speaking without any preamble, his tone somehow more serious than the message he sent. “There’s been an attack.” The Aurors shift nervously. “The neo-Death Eaters claimed responsibility for it through a note left at the scene -
“Yes.” Draco waits for the barb. He is not afraid. Harry Potter cannot say anything that he hasn’t already said to himself.
Draco nods deeply, his lips curling into a genuine, pleased smile. Harry gets the sudden urge to read up on jazz, to learn its history, to properly listen to this music genre that he's had very little exposure to all his life (Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon despised it, considering it just another trashy,
The classroom is silent. Even the students outside have moved farther away, making their voices no longer audible. Harry can’t bear to look at Malfoy right now, but he doesn’t hear him move or react in any way.
When class ends, the students pack up and leave one by one until it’s only Malfoy and Harry left. “Would you mind collecting the books with me?” Malfoy asks.
"Jazz?" Arthur leans forward with interest and a steaming dinner roll in his hand. "Do they hold shows every night?"
He's wearing a green suit - Slytherin green - but it's completely covered in sequins . The light reflected off of him makes Harry squint through his glasses a little. His hair isn't slicked back - in fact, it hangs in his eyes and frames his face, making him seem younger.
But it’s still strange; Draco hasn’t slept with another person in a long time. Apparently, living in one of the most remote places in the Isles is not a quality people look for in a partner. Everything - the extra rhythm of breaths, the sharing of the sheets, the radiating warmth - feels out of place in Snowdonia, a place Draco has only experienced alone for half a decade.
Suddenly, Harry realizes the background noise at the table - Rose’s enthusiastic slurps, Hermione and Ron’s conversation, and the gentle clinks their spoons made against the bowl - have all stopped. He looks up, and all three of them are looking right back at him.
Weasley lets out a whoop of joy at the first glimmer of water, and he and Finnigan race to the sea’s edge. Thomas yells, “Wait for me!” as he struggles to get his boots off. Longbottom stands in between Draco and Harry, shielding his eyes as he traces the coastline.
He busies himself - there is much to be done with the end of winter. He fills the watering hole. He readies the food stores. He sharpens and resharpens his dragonhide tools, as the end of hibernation means a mass shedding of old scales and skin.
Harry nods, then drops his forehead the last remaining centimeters between them - so they are standing forehead to forehead, so close their noses touch.
Silence descends as everyone watches Malfoy who, seemingly oblivious to the pressure, flexes his wrist and runs his fingers up and down the keyboard. When he’s done, his hands fall on his lap, and he stills for a moment before laying his hands on the keys again and beginning to play.
The two leave the bedroom and head into the living room, where only his fireplace, liquor cabinet, television, and dusty couch sit. Kreacher is nowhere to be seen, and he doesn't come to wave Harry off. Not that Harry really cares.
“Wait.” With one arm, Harry stops Malfoy in his tracks. The latter twists around, his face cold. A wave of realization hits Harry and he emerges from its froth with his head suddenly clear. “You think Neville and I are dating?”
Hermione laughs, modestly trying to play it off, but Harry can tell from years of knowing her that she's pleased.
Words brim at the top of Harry’s tongue, threatening to spill like froth after a wave, but for some reason, nothing gets out.
There is nothing in the box, as is Malfoy family tradition. Everything that once was Lucius Malfoy is now contained in two vials: one in Narcissa’s coat pocket, the other in Draco’s. He fingers it, the glass warm with body heat.
"I'll take offense." Harry's never been much of a defense guy. Even in Auror training, which required him to be comfortable with both, he got away with mostly "playing offense": going on raids, stakeouts, duels, etc. It annoyed Ron to no end, as he hated defense too, but was always caught sneaking to the other side. Harry supposes it's cruel irony that he sits in a cubicle day-in and day-out now, unable to play either.
Although he's almost literally being pulled in five separate directions, Draco maintains a smile as he tries to fulfill all of their requests at once.
Harry knows that, coming from McGonagall, it’s a high compliment. One glance at Malfoy tells him that he understands the honor as well - his head is slightly and graciously bowed. Behind the Headmistress, Dumbledore smiles, eyes twinkling the same as they always have. Snape isn't in his frame.
Fantasies and dreams do nothing - like Harry said. They did nothing during the War, when Draco was caged in fear, and they do nothing now, when he is finally free.
She shakes her head sadly, as if in mourning. “I’ve been reading some Muggle literature, and they say that mental illness can be complicated.”
"We both are," Angelina answers. She and George smile at each other and intertwine their hands. "And then we're spending our late honeymoon in America."
"Are they bringing the piano out?" Arthur asks, clearly directing his attempt at a whisper toward Molly, but he's loud enough that everyone at their table and probably the ones once over hear him clearly.
She doesn't need to tell Harry twice - he manages to somehow balance all the drinks in his arms and moves back across the room.
They cackle, their somber mood dissipating as fast as it had come. “The look on his face!” With that, they go back to their paperwork and administrative duties, muttering under their breath with a wide smile still plastered on their face.
Finally, only the last partner pair remains - Jenny and Ash. Robards opens his mouth and draws in another breath to give them their orders, but Kingsley cuts him off, stunning most everyone.
"Potter," Malfoy chides, "sometimes it's refreshing to ease off our reliance on magic, isn't it? Sans-magic tasks humbles us."
After they settle down, Draco speaks again. "So happy to hear that. Have good Christmases and holidays, everyone?"
Draco laughs and rolls on his side so he can look at Harry full-on. His blonde hair has come out of its usual position and falls on his forehead, over his eyes. “Kidding. You’re so cute when you’re embarrassed.”
Sophia and Lucas are coming too - Sophia is Portkeying in from America, where she’s been wrangling their Magical Creature problem (though they call them ‘Cryptids’ over there) - and Lucas is just going to be walking down the street. He has it all planned out - he’s going to take time off Draco’s lab the day of, citing sickness, and then show up unannounced to celebrate.
“This is the main building,” he says, avoiding eye contact, “All of our offices are in here, and this is where you will work.” Draco rests a hand on the receptionist counter. “The restrooms are down the hall, first right. There’s a breakroom, too - last right.”
Hesitantly, he agrees, setting the drinks down and taking his seat. In the distance, Harry notices that the rest of their group have emerged from the restrooms. Belle follows his gaze and understands.
“Y-e-s?” Without meaning to, Harry’s voice rises at the end as he’s practically grappling with Draco, trying to keep him steady and on his feet. “It’s fine. Goodnight everyone.”
Harry eats his breakfast (a single fried egg and a glass of almost-expired orange juice), does his laundry for the first time in weeks, and attacks his kitchen pantry with plenty of
"I'm back-oh," Ron stops when he sees Belle hovering over their table. In his arms are their drinks.
As Harry and Malfoy float their belongings up to the house, Harry hears happy voices and laughter coming from within. No one's in the yard - besides the garden gnomes and Crookshank, who's taking pleasure in chasing them as always. It looks like they're one of the last ones to arrive, but Harry's used to being late to Christmas.
The receptionist chirps out a greeting at them, and they greet him back to be polite. A few other wizards and witches call out to them as they pass and as they ride in the lift, but Harry mostly lets Ron talk to them. Ron knows Harry doesn't like to deal with them, and he's a good enough friend to shoot the breeze on his behalf - "How was your Christmas? Mine was great, did I tell you Hermione's pregnant?" and "Do you think it'll snow again?" are two prominent conversation starters today.
And above all else, Harry keeps his distance - physically. When their hands accidentally brush as he hands off Draco’s tea, Harry jerks back, ever so slightly. When Harry passes him in the kitchen, he gives Draco a wide berth. Draco thought the pricking at his collar would ease - that the gripping tension he felt in his chest every time Harry got too close, looked for too long, would fade as Harry kept away.
They leave the hut and trek up to the castle. The snow is unbroken except for a few large footsteps and pawprints here and there. Everything is silent, calm even. Possibly the only remaining place left in the Wizarding world where Harry can exist alongside peace is Hogwarts over Christmas break.
They both step back as a reaction to the pain, cursing and wincing. Malfoy stares at the books scattered on the floor in silence before his shoulders hunch in defeat. “You’re in charge of the heavy ones. And hurry up, I’m already late,” he quips at Harry. He then scoops up the smaller, flimsier paperbacks and continues stomping down the hall again - maybe with a little limp this time.
He is not crying now, and neither is his mother. When they speak to each other, their words are slow and careful, but clear and unwavering.
Harry feels his body heat up with anger. Mostly because he and everyone else in the bloody meeting room including Robards know full well that when the Second War was becoming a reality, he chose to fuck off to America the whole time to go into hiding. He didn't want to deal with any of it, and Harry privately suspects that he actually sympathized with the Death Eaters, but wanted to position himself like a vulture to swoop in and take over whatever's left at the end of it all. If his suspicions are correct, then Robards has even
Draco sighs and touches Harry's face, shutting him up. "Let me finish. Then you can jump to whatever conclusions you want."
Alt (The Onion) chapter title: "Man Knows He Must Ride Unexpected Urge To Clean As Far As It Will Take Him"
Although a little taken aback, Harry tries to help him by describing exactly what he felt during the performance. At the end, Draco scans his notes and mumbles to himself. Harry doesn't feel like he felt anything groundbreaking or interesting, but Draco seems totally invested and engrossed.
His throat constricts; if he’s not careful, he’s going to begin crying too. But he’s done crying, at least in front of other people. “That doesn’t fucking mean anything to me. How do you think your ‘sorry’s will help me? And your endless nagging?” His lips curl viciously. “Did those Muggle books tell you that would solve this? ‘Cure’ me? I thought you were smarter than that, Hermione.”
He would laugh if his heart didn't feel so heavy. He doesn't know what he'll do without Draco. He had foolishly gotten his hopes up, gotten ahead of himself; there were times when Harry envisioned himself growing old with Draco. Adopting a crup together. Merlin, he even had a name picked out for it.
With one, strong kick, Harry's up in the air and flying higher and higher with Draco doing the same at his side. He knows that the Snitch initially flew off to the back-right of the garden, but since he took his eyes off the area for a few moments, it could've flown off to anywhere by now. Desperate, both to win and to do so quickly, Harry scans the scene in search of just a small glint of light reflecting off of gold.
Internally cringing, Harry tries to answer his question as best he can without revealing too much, “Oh...you know...working at the Ministry.”
"Are we ready?" Hermione asks. She's added a black and white striped shawl to her look, and she tosses it over her shoulder.
The rest of the group nod in assent and they begin the trek back to the castle. While doing so, Malfoy falls to the back of the group to join Harry.
Harry feels his consciousness losing grip of the situation; it slips faster and faster until the scene in the room with Malfoy spins out of control and shatters completely with a bright flash of light.
“Wow…” Harry looks back at Draco, a wide grin on his face, then gestures to the ground they walk on, the grass crowding the riverbank, the goliaths of stone cutting the sky.
"I should be the one thanking you," she says while taking off her glasses. "You seemed to have sparked quite a passion for learning - and for researching - in the students. That's a rarity in all the years I've been in magical education."
Neville sighs and finally makes eye contact with Harry.”I don’t know either. I guess I want to be friends again.”
But now is not the time. Harry bustles over to the bathroom to shave and wash his face and take a piss - not necessarily in that order. Not even bothering with his bedhead, Harry inspects the contents of his closet afterwards and emerges with the only button down shirt he owns - the one Hermione made him buy when they went to a fancy Muggle restaurant for Rose’s birthday last year.
With one hand on his friend’s chest, Harry stares out, his profile serious and hidden. Draco follows his gaze, but sees only the pale edge of the world.
“Yeah, it’s getting late,” Hermione says, never once taking her eyes off of Harry. “We’ll go now, but call us if you need anything, okay? Our fireplace is open - the wards will let you in.”
Willows comes from a long line of white Purebloods - shocker - but it seems that his family kept a low profile during the first two Wars. His parents raised both him and his little sister in America during the whole fiasco, and it's only once he grew into an adult that he moved back to Britain.
Harry lets him finish. "As I was saying," he continues, "I don't want us to become...toxic to each other. But I absolutely don't want to break up. I..." He flushes and struggles to speak. "I want to be with you."
Giving in to her demands, he works to push her harder, until she’s swinging so high that he’s afraid for a moment that she will flip over to the other side completely. She doesn’t seem to sense the danger, only squealing with delight. It’s her first time at a Muggle park, on a Muggle swing.
They walk out together, to the apparition point. Harry could use the Floo, but the journey through the flames and dust has been upsetting his stomach the last few times he’s done it. He blames age.
Harry knows that the show will start soon. And he knows that his friends and family are waiting on their drinks. But he still takes a seat at the bar, promising himself that he won't stay too long.
George lets out a burp and follows it with a lethargic "Excuse me," but Molly still scowls at him anyway. "Manners!" She reprimands him, but the rest of the family laugh anyways.
Harry closes his eyes, and the mundane thoughts disappear as his consciousness slips away for the night.
"Are you alright? Did you break anything?" Hermione scans Draco with her brows furrowed and her parent-voice on, but she doesn't touch him.
It’s still snowing when Harry wakes up the next morning. The flakes mind their own business on the other side of the glass as Harry gets dressed, pushes away the cuppa Kreacher offers him, and summons his broom - the Pulsar, the newest model, gifted to Harry free of charge so long as he rides it everywhere.
Harry takes Draco’s hand - it’s rough and scarred now, from years of volunteering at the National Scottish Dragon Reserve, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way. “Just think about it,” he says, “it helps. I promise you it helps.”
It’s full dark when they begin to clean up and make for home. Up above, Draco hears the strong beating of wings - dragons returning home to rest. And from far off in the valley comes the hooting of the owls as they rise, only beginning their hunt.
But all of that doesn’t stop him from already feeling the hangover beginning in his temples. He groans and splashes some water on his face.
With all the excitement about the pregnancy and baby talk, Harry didn’t get a chance to bring him up. It seems so unimportant anyways, in comparison. Hermione and Ron’s family is growing.
A flock at the corner of Draco’s eye suddenly takes off, and when he looks over, it’s Harry, looking sheepish.
To be honest, Harry's a bit lost. If Draco's breaking up with him, this is a hell of a roundabout to do it.
“Already?” The children complain and plead, but Malfoy shakes his head, smiling his soft smile, and takes his coat and scarf back from Harry.
They sit there, read, and organize for an hour or so - Harry’s lost track, too distracted by the mountains of parchment and by Malfoy, who, other than when he got up to bring back the tea, has been sitting right next to Harry the whole time. Occasionally he would change positions: both feet on the floor, cross-legged, reclining against the other end of the couch with his feet nearly in Harry’s lap. In contrast, Harry hasn’t dared to move anything more than his eyes as he scans the readings.
They relapse into silence. Out of the corner of Harry's eye, he sees the waitress coming with a dessert menu, but before she reaches them, a silver Lynx bounds through the walls of the restaurant, startling all the Muggles, and stops at their table.
Harry brings up his earlier conversation with Neville, and Hermione and Ron don’t look too surprised. “We’re so proud of you, Harry.” Hermione tells him. “Yeah, you did something really difficult,” Ron agrees. A warmth settles in Harry’s chest.
She sits back and smiles, regarding not just Malfoy, but both of them. "Very well. I take it both of you have somewhere to be...?"
“Well,” she checks her watch, “he should be here any minute now. He usually comes in a bit after noon. Do you want to order something while you wait?”
Harry winces in embarrassment. “Sorry, mate. I don’t understand,” he looks around him, at the drab gray walls of his bathroom, “I didn’t have
After their brief spell of drowsiness, Weasley rises, and wipes his eyes blearily. “Where to, next, Malfoy?”
“I’ll see you all after Christmas. I’ll get you something.” He goes to wake Pat, who stumbles into the kitchen a little blearily and takes the baby from Harry.
Draco turns his head to look back. Even under the hood of night, Draco can make out Harry’s expression - his steady brow and focused eyes, the serious set of his mouth.
The next gift is a bumpy package from Hermione. After a confused look at her, to which she meets with a mysterious shrug, he opens it. It's several tubes of paint and a bundle of paintbrushes.
"Congratulations!" "Congrats!" "When did you find out?" A chorus of voices explode with noise all at once, and Harry blinks slowly, trying to sort through it all. Molly seems on the verge of tears, and Arthur is rubbing her back in circles.
An hour - or maybe two - passes like that; Harry slumped at his desk, alternating between staring at the inside of his eyelids and the office carpet. He knows that he should be working on paperwork, but he can’t see the point.
“Harry!” “Harry, are you involved with-” “Do you have any comment about-” “Do you know anything-” “Have you-” Are-” They’ve left the door now, swarming Harry instead, but that doesn’t stop him from walking toward Robards and Kingsley’s office.
He snorts at that, the first thing resembling a smile on his face that Draco’s seen in days. “It was Ron’s idea. He thought it would be...calming. Being in nature and all.”
Longbottom doesn’t press the matter further, and the rest of the group barely get out a grunt of recognition at Draco’s words. Draco decides to spread his remaining material over the next -
Draco draws his hands from his pockets and begins rechecking his pack, making sure he’s bringing enough water, food, first aid. “Don’t start now. It doesn’t suit you.”
The next morning, they pack up and begin the hike back. An overnight trip was the most they could get away with, considering that they were rapidly approaching summer’s tourism peak, and, worryingly, that the dragon eggs haven’t hatched yet.
He brightens up considerably at this. “I’ve always looked up to them. And my father was one. He’s retired now, and he wants me to do it too.”
The final piece is sad. Harry doesn't know how jazz can be sad, (he thought that was what Blues were) but Draco pulls it off. The piece still makes everyone want to sway and dance, but the notes follow one after the other glumly, wistfully, yearning for the ones that have already been played.
Harry scoops up some more snow and uses his chance to run forward, past Malfoy, and exercise a pincer attack with Sophia on the opposing team’s fort.
"Of course I did," Harry assures her while trying to balance Lucy on his hip, "I do every year, remember?"
“I-” For a gripping, terrifying moment, Harry thinks he’s going to be turned down, but Malfoy continues to surprise him at every turn. “-okay.”
The door opens and Ron strides in, dressed in his red Auror robes. It must be his lunch break already, Harry realizes, if he has enough time to come and visit.
In his trainee days, Harry had imagined his future life with the Aurors vividly. There would be danger, the stakes would be high - it wouldn't phase him because that's all he's known his entire life. He wouldn't want to start out at a high level due to his name - no, he wanted to earn a position as a leader. He’d envisioned twirling in his scarlet robes, firing spell after spell from his wand. He’d envisioned himself dashing through the alleys, getting mud all over his boots, and taking down a suspect. He’d envisioned himself grabbing a beer with friends after closing a hard case and going home to Ginny and his children and falling asleep feeling warm and wanted.
"Go! Look, he's coming out now." She points and Harry follows her finger to see just that: Draco leaving through a door on the side of the stage. A crowd immediately coalesces around him, clambering for his attention and autograph.
If there is anyone to tell by then, Draco thinks to himself, I’ll tell them that, when I go, I want to go everywhere:
His mother had responded, he was sure of it, but he no longer remembers what exactly she said. It doesn’t matter now. Because now, he understands.
"Two," Kingsley continues, "we're currently in the process of working with the Muggle Prime Minister on a precautionary plan that will prioritize Muggle and Muggleborn safety, especially for those who are nonwhite. Jenny and Ash are leading this project and are in talks with top Muggle officials at this moment; they don't need additional help right now, but that may be subject to change as we confirm details and construct a solid plan. I will keep you updated."
With a heavy sigh and a blooming smile, Malfoy shrugs off his coat and unwinds his scarf. “Fine.” He tosses the coat and scarf to Harry, who catches them out of reflex. They’re warm with Malfoy’s body heat. Malfoy casts a small glance at Harry with a twinkle in his eye.
"My 'O' in Muggle Studies is finally going to be put to use," Jenny jokes, making Harry crack a smile. Truthfully, if she weren't already dating Ash, Harry would've tried to get close to her as well. She's always reminded Harry of Ginny in some ways - her strong convictions and spunk being two of them.
The song is...nice. It’s light and upbeat and Harry finds himself almost tapping his foot to the rhythm or swaying to the beat. He doesn’t, of course, but everyone else does: the children, the woman,
“Where is that?” Thomas asks, and Finnigan stretches out a hand and traces the hunter’s lines for his husband.
At those words, the children yelp and cheer, and quickly drop their brooms and dash for the house. It seems that, even in the face of learning how to fly, Molly’s cooking still takes precedent. Harry's grumbling stomach agrees with them.
Draco rises to his feet and puts on his coat. "I'm afraid not, I must go the club for some last minute rehearsals."
“I know you,” Harry says simply, easily. Not a boast or a rash, infatuation-fueled statement - just a truth.
Something sounds in the kitchen - a cross between a bell and a horn - and Molly scrambles to her feet, placing her knitting gently on the table. "Breakfast's ready!" She shouts, loud enough to reach the upper floors. Harry swears he hears a distant thump from some bedroom somewhere in the house.
But still, one question burns a red line through Draco’s chest - the cinder cord that makes music out of every glance, every smile, every kind word Harry gives him. Draco opens his mouth, and sings it:
Gordon stops speaking with Robin and turns to the group. "Time's up." Harry notices that he has a Muggle watch strapped to his wrist. Things have definitely changed from when he was in school.
“Er…” Harry’s caught off guard for a moment. He’d expected Neville to fly into some sort of rage, not speak so quietly that he has to strain to hear. Not sit calmly in his seat, hands to himself. “I don’t know. What do
Harry backs out of Robards' office, goes back to his cubicle, and finds he can do nothing but laugh hysterically, clutching at his desk. On his desk, the photo of him, Hermione, and Ron glints under the harsh light. The trio is back together, looking happier than ever.
He’s yelling right back at them, his face red, sweat pouring down, and several neck veins standing out starkly against his otherwise pale skin, but he’s still tight lipped about anything and everything.
“I wonder if it ever gets lonely down there in the winter,” Malfoy muses as he peers down into the depths of the Lake. The dark shape dives out of sight.
Longbottom practically faints at the sight of their camp. Already half-asleep on their feet, Weasley, Thomas, Finnigan file inside their respective cottages, and Longbottom follows close behind - but not before throwing Draco a quick, “Thank you for today, Malfoy.”
Draco nods. At his signal, his mother flicks her wand and the polished wooden box in front of them floats off the ground, and gently settles into the hole. Another flick, and the pile of soil that lay beside lifts as well, and covers the box - smoothing over until the seam of the hole’s border disappears.
Harry feels as though Malfoy isn’t going to sell him out anytime soon, surprisingly. The Harry Potter from ten years ago could never have imagined this. “I don’t mind, particularly, no.”
He thinks, half ready to tear his hair out in frustration at his own idiocy. He briefly considers owling Hermione an apology, but decides better of it. It wouldn't be worth anything anyways. And he's afraid that making amends would just be inviting her to poke her nose into his life again, which he can't have. She can't see me like this, he thinks, reveling in the coolness of his desk against his forehead.
And now, Draco allows himself to look back. He studies Harry’s face - the cut of his jaw, his sloping nose, the bow of his lips. He traces the lines of his body, and notes the flex of his forearms as he digs the trowel into soil, and the stretch of his calves when he walks. Draco stares at his hands. His smooth, dark skin, the lines on his palms, the tendons in his fingers.
“Almost,” Prasad confirms, “The mothers are getting restless, I think they hear them scratching the insides. You need to get down there now.”
Harry would like to comply with her order, but Malfoy's giving him a look that indicates that he may have some serious trouble doing so. The blonde sends a snowball Harry's way, and it splatters at his feet, gets on his sock, and proceeds to rapidly melt. Wincing but undeterred, Harry throws the two snowballs he's made not at Malfoy, but at one of the fort-builders. The poor student yells an expletive as the snow seems to fall down his shirt and touch his bare back, but continues building.
"Thank you for coming tonight. I know it's last minute and everything so I appreciate your support for not just me but most importantly for the little ones up front-" he gestures at the table all the orphans are sitting at. The audience cheers and applauds and the children give them shy waves back.
Draco watches the flames. It’s dark now. In the summer months, all the croaking, squeaking creatures would be emerging and singing their songs, but it’s still winter, and the night air is cold and silent save for the crack of the fire and Draco’s own heartbeat - a living thing in his chest.
Harry doesn’t speak much and is even less inclined to laughter. As the days pass, the colour in his face drains paler and paler. His cheeks grow gaunt, and the shadows deepen.
Fleur sighs and combs her fingers through her long blonde hair. Throughout all the years that Harry's known her, he swears that she hasn't aged a day. Especially after signing her modeling contract a few years ago, she seems to grow even more beautiful every year. "Bill woke up in the middle of ze night to throw up."
Oh, the look Harry presses to him. Through his eyes, Draco sees his own reflection - scarcely recognizable - but he doesn’t flinch away.
I wish I could tell you that I wrote down and remembered the specific Clementi piece that I was drawing off of in this chapter but alas...I am Boo Boo The Fool....But seriously though pretty much all of Clementi's pieces are upbeat so if that's your cup of tea then I'd suggest looking him up!
Malfoy’s eyes open but are still directed at the ceiling. “I mean good job in class today.” The couch groans as Malfoy sits back up - his hair mussed. “Do you actually want to learn about my research?” His voice sounds vulnerable, almost raw.
It’s Draco’s favorite hike. At Glyder Fawr, the earth is carved deep, and the mountains are pushed high. A product of millions of years of tension and grinding rock, but still the range is calm on the surface.
“Yes, we have.” Longbottom gives him a smile, slightly more genuine than the ones yesterday. “Shall we?”
Working there is hard. Ron commiserates with Harry and is a good ally - regularly calling his fellow Aurors out on their bullshit - but actually changing minds in the department seems like a hopeless prospect. Fixing the system from the inside is - and always has been - utter bullshit.
Draco takes his hand, a tender anchor. He opens his mouth and surprises himself, “Yes. Yes, I think so.”
When it’s time to leave, Harry gives Andromeda a kiss on the cheek, and apparates away once he steps on the other side of the gates. The last thing he sees is a lone silhouette shadowed by the light behind her, waving.
Draco sobers up in record time. And then proceeds to blush. "You've got to stop that," he says so seriously that Harry panics, trying to figure out what he did wrong.
They paddle onwards, conversation flowing freely. Save for them, it’s quiet - a few Muggles walk the shore with their umbrellas out, and the rain comes and goes, but no birds call, and whatever fish that swim the reservoir have gone deep into the murk.
He spends the rest of the day half-dazed with delight at his desk, filling out paperwork at a snail's pace. For the first time in a while, he knows the current day of the week: Wednesday. Which means the event is in two days.
They step into the hut and shut the cold out. Harry lets out a sigh of relief as he loosens his muffler, relishing the warmth of the fire.
"The new Enchanted Scorebook. I've been trying to get it for months." He starts thumbing through, his face full of awe. Harry likes the look on him. "It will mark notes while I play, and even give me suggestions when I'm composing. It's a must-have for the musical-magical community."
To his complete surprise, Edwards burst into tears, and instead of struggling against his bonds, lies limply on the floor. Harry flounders.
He sets up several lanterns around him for light, and inspects the eggs. They are close indeed - one or two are showing significant webbing, the film inside showing through the cracks.
Ginny kisses her again, holding it a little longer this time. "I love you." It's a whisper, clearly only meant for Luna to hear, but Harry can't help but to catch it anyways. Tugging on his tie and needlessly adjusting it, he pretends to be too preoccupied to hear.
"I have an idea!" Rose shouts, and the yard quiets down at once. She sticks a finger up in the air and declares, "I think both Uncle Harry and Uncle Draco should fly with me. Like what they just did."
But Harry and Ron did, and they both send triumphant grins Kingsley's way, but he pretends has if he doesn't see them.
Footsteps. In seconds, Draco Malfoy steps onto the stage and the crowd goes dead silent - even the children stop squirming in their seats and stare, fixed, at the stage.
Draco doesn’t respond, just watches as the car crawls closer and closer, enters their circle, and pulls off the side, to a mostly unused parking lot. A few minutes later, he hears the doors slam one after another and men’s voices rise in the air - muffled through the glass.
They stand on the edge of the nest for a long time, watching the eggs, unmoving like stones, and the slow rise and fall of their aunt’s chest. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco catches Weasley sliding his hand over Harry’s back, and inclining his head to speak something in his ear. Harry shakes his head and shrugs Weasley’s arm off.
NOTE: Please mind the suicide attempt mention content warning in this chapter in particular. As it was previously, the mention in question will be clearly partitioned off, and not reading it will not significantly impact your experience.
Kreacher apparates back into his room after a few minutes with a tray of tea and small snacks - biscuits, cookies, and fruit.
Harry looks down at it, but says nothing. It’s not a secret - Draco keeps it in the open, and he still, occasionally, takes it with him. A few times, he has caught Harry staring, perhaps trying to make sense of it. But he has never asked outright.
Harry stares at it for a moment before taking it. “Thank you.” He hesitates. “How did you find this place?”
She gives him a look. "Of course." With a tap of her wand, the fabric turns the exact shade of green that he had in mind - Slytherin green. She tosses it to him, and he catches it gingerly and begins to tie it.
“Well. I will give that ‘congratulations’ to you, then.” Draco pauses. “Are you still hungry?” He asks, nodding to his bag.
Harry looks over at Draco, heart pounding. The blonde doesn't speak for a little bit, too occupied with turning the gift over and over in his hands, inspecting every square inch of it. In the background, Harry barely registers Fleur coming back from the kitchen with a steaming pot of tea and a collection of cups. He's only focused on Draco, on his hands, on his face, on the way he's biting his lips.
Now that they're done eating, the children dash off into the living and continue their game from before dinner. Only Lucy remains, still sitting comfortably in Harry's lap and finishing off her dinner. Harry has been regularly cutting up the scraps of food too big for her so she can actually eat.
Putting a hand on her stomach, Hermione opens her mouth to speak, but Molly has already caught on. Her mouth opens, and a shriek comes out.
All that is left is the channel carved into the earth, and the bare rocks beneath. Harry jogs forward and jumps in. A sound rings out - the bottom of his boots clicking against stone.
Kingsley closes the file in front of him and looks up. "Ah." He looks neither disappointed nor surprised. "Good, now we can begin. I believe there are two open seats right here." He gestures toward two seats near the front.
“It’s getting late,” Hermione murmurs to Harry while placing a hand on his leg. “Maybe you should take Draco to bed.”
It’s Harry who lets go first. “Thank you guys for staying with me. But you all need to get back too.”
“Right.” But then Harry remembers. “But I also didn’t eat that much for dinner, or for lunch. Or for breakfast…” he trails off reflecting on his extraordinarily poor life decisions. It’s a wonder that he even had anything to throw up at all.
“Then I’ll teach you.” He stands and shakes off sand in glittering waves. He offers a hand to Draco, smiling. “Come on.”
He’s still thinking about it hours later, huddled up next to Cane on the floor in his bedroll, trying extract heat from the dog and the last glowing embers in the fireplace. Even with Hagrid’s periodic, almost earth-shaking snores to distract it, Harry’s mind can’t stop going back to Malfoy and his class.
In the distance, he notices the reporters inch closer and closer, eyes gleaming by the light of the dying fire.
Harry braces himself for the obvious follow up question, but it doesn’t come. In fact, Malfoy doesn’t seem to react at all - the look on his face, at least from the side, is faraway, distracted.
A few minutes pass with only the crunch of their boots on dirt and gravel for conversation. Then, Longbottom asks, “How did you get into this line of work, Malfoy?”
The words come like they were wrested from Draco by force - hard as stones, and just as punishing. “It was story after story of how she tortured my mother. Fire Leeches in her bed, Stinging Hexes under the dinner table - once, she even set Mother’s hair on fire.” Draco shakes his head, bewildered. “And Mother told me everything with a smile on her face, like she was just reminiscing. Could you believe it?”
He bends down quickly to gather up some snow and continues running while packing them into suitable projectiles. A few more snowballs whizz by him - thrown by Malfoy and not the two students working on the fort.
Toys practically cover the floor of the playroom; everything from Legos to dolls to toy cars pile on top of each other. A few squashy-looking armchairs stand in the corner with a tarp thrown over the top, creating a tent of some sort. When they enter, three children tumble out.
, Harry thinks. They've all remained close over the years, and sometimes Kreacher spends the night with them, helping them cook and clean.
One hand still gripping the gloves and the box they came in, Draco rests his other, after a moment’s hesitation, on Harry’s arm.
"Well," the man sniffs and purses his lips, "no, unless you count when the other young man woke up and covered me."
from time to time so he doesn’t get blown off course. He hasn’t missed Christmas decorating upkeep with Hagrid for the past 6 years, and he doesn’t plan on starting now.
In the struggle, Harry’s foot somehow finds itself hooked around the back of Malfoy’s foot, which promptly makes his leg give out under them and sends the pair sprawling onto the ice Malfoy-first.
Harry swallows thickly, and when he speaks his voice comes out a little raspy. "Yes. I loved it." The "love" in the word "loved" almost gets stuck in his throat.
Their full-grown parents or family members are unable to help, either, as their size and the nature of their claws do not lend themselves to sensitive operations. They cannot help their children hatch, lest they risk crushing the entire egg - baby and all.
"No shit. I want to know what you said to her that messed her up so bad. When she came home last night she didn't stop crying until two in the morning."
It’s surreal, Harry thinks, to be on the other side of the glass, to be the one giving comfort in the relationship. He struggles against guilt -
coat - and brushes past Harry as he leaves. After a second’s delay, Malfoy’s cologne washes over him and it’s minty. Harry unwittingly takes a deep breath of it. As soon as the front door clicks shut, Harry slumps into a chair.
Draco is smiling as he bows, sweat flying. "Thank you for coming and good night! And please consider donating!" He calls into the microphone before walking off. The applause continues long after he's gone.
The reporters almost within earshot now, and Robards is nowhere to be seen. Desperation claws its way out of Harry’s mouth.
Without wasting any time, she climbs into his lap to join Lucy, who’s used to this and doesn’t object; she’s actually practically asleep on his shoulder anyways, and Rose’s scream only makes her lift her head for one sleepy second before setting it back down again. “Merry Christmas! Who’s this?” She points at Draco. Harry’s surprised - up until now, none of the other children have acknowledged Draco at all.
Footsteps sound from the stairs, and moments later, Draco appears in the doorway. He's still wearing the same clothes from last night, but the buttons are all done up now, the wrinkles from sleeping in them are gone, and his hair is once again styled in an elegant blonde swoop. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Harry can't take his eyes off the skin it exposes - and the Dark Mark that remains there, unfaded and as ominous as ever.
Without Harry noticing, the students seemed to have already separated out into teams. “Be on my team?” Sophia asks Harry sweetly.
“Of course.” The group of teenagers in the corner burst into laughter. “It’s least you deserve. And it’s the least I could do.”
"And he's much better than his father was at his age, that's for sure." Arthur shudders as he seems to think back to his encounters with young Lucius Malfoy.
Because for three nights now, including the first, Draco has lain awake as Harry and Weasley have the same argument outside his cottage. On the second and third night, Draco instinctively threw silencing charms at his wall and tunneled back into his covers, but sleep never came easy after that. Because he knew, and that knowing was enough.
The next day and a half pass quickly and Harry and Malfoy fall into a sort of routine. They sit at breakfast together, go to class together, and hang out in Malfoy’s living quarters at night - grading assignments, shooting the shit, talking until late. It’s nice, Harry thinks. He wonders if this is how it could have been all this time - even before the War.
Hopefully, no one will say anything. He knows that Malfoy won't do anything to offend the family - even he if he doesn't like them, Malfoy, from what Harry's seen, would remain dignified. He's really just worried that this experience will sour his and Malfoy's relationship - not that they’re anything more than friends or even friendly acquaintances in the first place-
But this catches Draco off guard, and he practically flinches. "Uh. Yes, they do. But the longer ones are Tuesdays and Fridays."
Belle doesn't respond to that, but merely smiles slow and wide before turning on her heel and gliding away.
The few who are still cognizant of their surroundings answer back and bid them goodnight, but most don’t even notice as Harry half-drags Draco out the room.
Malfoy catches Harry's eye and smirks - and it's the kind of egotistical,  self-righteous, and petty smirk that he used to give him all the time in Hogwarts. It's a throwback, but not really a sight for sore eyes.
you last night?” Hagrid asks, his voice magnified and echoing around the hall. “You never came home!”
For a long moment, neither men speak. They just breathe in the night air, filtering in from the open window.
Harry’s dish is indeed ‘a hodge-podge of meat and potatoes,’ as Draco described, only the food is more artfully arranged than Harry was expecting a ‘hodge-podge’ to be.
As he comes closer to the building, his panic increases. It roots him to the spot until all he can do is watch the fire eat away more and more of the structure. He was right.
Fat tears squeeze out of Hermione’s eyes but she stays silent, never taking her eyes off of Harry. When she opens her mouth to speak again, it’s only a whisper. “I’m sorry Harry. I’m so sorry.”
Rifling through the files as he walks, he grows more and more bored by the page. Their knowledge about the group seems to have remained relatively unchanged; they know the identities of most of the leaders, but not much else, no knows relations, addresses - nothing. There’s nothing for the field groups to go off of, which is the key to a successful arrest or bust.
Another round of cheers come, and Harry swears passerbys outside the walls can l hear the thunderous applause.
After donning his robes and scarf and stashing the books under his desk for class the next day, Malfoy links arms with Harry and promptly half-drags him out of the castle, through the snow, and to the Lake.
Draco learns Harry’s favorite foods, how he likes his tea. At lunchtime, when they are both working the office that day, they sit outside to eat. After, they lay in the grass - head to head - and let the sun fall on their faces.
Despite the potential disaster looming on the horizon, the Ministry seems fairly calm - like it's a normal Monday. The fountain is gurgling away as always; after the War, Hermione petitioned to have the old statue replaced. Her argument was that it perpetuated the oppression of non-magical beings as well as of witches - the witch in the statue was portrayed as less important than the wizard, after all - and Kingsley had agreed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all supported the change, until it turned out the replacement statue was going to be of them, by popular demand. The public wanted it, and despite their efforts to stop it from happening, the public got it: a ten foot tall statue-fountain of the "Golden Trio" that now guards the front of the Ministry. It's really embarrassing to look at, but in all the years that Harry's been working at the Ministry, walking by it every morning to go to work, the initial mortification and annoyance has faded somewhat. Nowadays, Harry and Ron barely even notice it anymore.
"Malfoy--!" With one, rage-fueled-motion, Harry uses his entire arm to wipe his glasses clean and uses his other arm to launch his snowballs.
"I-I'm sure? I don't know what you all are talking about..." Harry trails off. He must be missing something here, or maybe it's the hangover that's messing everything up for him, but he is completely at a loss.
After waiting around for a response for a few minutes - all the while squinting a little bit from the sunlight that insists on streaming into his room - he casts
Everyone’s expressions are hard to read. Bill, Fleur, Audrey, and Percy smile politely, Molly and Arthur’s faces are inscrutable, Charlie and Ion don’t react much - probably because neither have had much interaction with Draco in the first place - Ginny attempts a smile, but it falls into a half-grimace instead - and Hermione and Ron beam at him.
And his father. After the Kiss and the seven years that followed, sitting patiently at the door, waiting for the reprieve of Death to come knocking.
Giving Harry a knowing smirk, Draco drawls, “Yes, Harry, she’s doing alright. Living on her own, gardening, cooking, making friends with her Muggle neighbors. Relaxing by the sea.”
"Harry! Harry!" Victoire, Bill and Fleur's oldest daughter, tugs on his free hand toward their massive heap of toys in the corner. "Come play with us! We're just starting."
The question seems to catch Harry off guard. He blinks, then looks away, out the kitchen window. “It’s not the entire reason.”
He watches Draco carefully - watches his gleaming hair falling in waves onto his forehead and neck, the way his knuckles bend, his polished dress shoe reflecting light as it periodically presses the pedal underneath the piano. The line of his shoulders was tense before, but relaxed now, allowing him a freedom of movement as he plays. At times, Harry even spies a small smile playing at his lips after a particularly fast series of notes.
The two men walk to the door and Malfoy sees him out. The last thing Harry sees before the door swings shut is Malfoy’s face: tired and full of shadows.
Thankfully, the wind dies down a bit after an hour of flying. The world below Harry is white and quiet again. He’s following the Hogwarts Express’ route, though its last trip of the year was yesterday morning - bringing Hogwarts students back home for the holidays.
Robards opens his mouth, clearly about to go off on one of his infamous tirades, but Kingsley raises his hand and he falls silent. Even Robards, the arrogant, pompous bastard he is, doesn’t dare cross the literal Minister of Magic.
But Ron has known him for long enough to know when Harry's bullshitting him. He just frowns disapprovingly at him and sighs. "You know I can't hide this from her. Not after what happened last time. I promised her."
Harry and Malfoy walk inside, the former heading straight to the living room, where he knows everyone will be. Molly and Arthur; Bill and Fleur and their daughters Victoire and Dominique; Charlie and his boyfriend, fellow dragon researcher Ion; Percy and his wife Audrey and their daughters Molly II and Lucy; George and Angelina and their children Fred II and Roxanne; and Hermione and Ron and Rose.
He waits until Belle and Ava are distracted processing other donations before approaching the bouncer manning the table. In the end, he donates a couple thousand pounds from his Muggle bank account, casts one last look at Draco, and pushes out the door into the quiet street.
It used to happen more frequently when they were in school together - namely fifth year, but those dreams either bordered on nightmares or turned into something else entirely, something more...embarrassing.
The articles themselves, Harry reads in earnest down to every last sentence. He has nothing better to do after all, just sitting alone in his office as his coworkers apparate in and out trying to save Muggles and Muggleborn people.
After gently prying his arm out of Draco's grasp, Harry sits up and surveys the scene. His jeans are draped on the edge of the bed - which he actually remembers taking off. He scoops them up, gets out of bed, and wiggles them back onto his body. This way, at least, his snitch boxers won't be on full display to Draco and anyone who could walk in at a moment's notice.
But when he looks across the table at him, into his features drawn with concern and earnest eyes, he can’t bring himself to be the paranoid jerk he often was in Hogwarts. They’ve graduated. It’s been fifteen, long years, since the War, and Malfoy has already paid his price.
In the corner, people continuously stream in from the outside. All the tables have been filled, so now there's a line of people posted on the back wall and utterly enraptured by Draco's playing.
"Ursa's Ultimate Collection of Unusual Artifacts." Harry adds in the silence of non-recognition afterwards, "It's in Hogsmeade."
Draco offers him a small smile. “Excellent.” He changes topics immediately. “Do you have a preferred wine, by the way?”
The wave of rolling eyes around the table is almost audible; after the War, Arthur's interest in Muggle technologies expanded full force into the realm of music. One of his favorite genres is jazz, Harry suddenly remembers from a very animated conversation he had with him once - during most of which Harry was completely lost.
"The show is almost starting again, I think," she says, checking the slim gold watch on her wrist, "Hopefully I will have a chance to better make your acquaintances afterwards - if you're staying to meet with Draco, that is."
When the door opens, a cheerful-looking young woman stands in the doorway with a baby in her arms and a toddler clutching her skirts. “Draco!” Her eyes flit to Harry. “And a friend. Come in, come in. Sorry for the state of things; Steven made a mess on the floor again.” As soon as she closes her mouth, the baby begins to wail. “Oh dear, I think it’s time for a diaper change. Come in, come in, I’ll just be a moment.”
"I've heard that painting is a good coping mechanism," she explains briefly. She doesn't need to say anything more. Everyone knows the kind of coping she’s talking about.
"Congratulations," he tells him, presenting Draco with Hermione's bouquet. It's well put together and beautiful - spiky leaves paired with blooming flowers of every warm color: reds, oranges, yellows.
With the combined help of Prasad, Walker, and Harry, they manage to move all the supplies to the edge of the nest. From here, however, Draco must move the rest by himself, and he must trade off with Amira to do it. The dragons are already wary of so many wizards in one place - and in such proximity, too. They only trust one at a time to approach the clutch.
Before the questions come, Harry steps in for the first time since dinner began to explain. "He was teaching at Hogwarts. I saw him while I was there." Draco looks at him from the corner of his eye, but he neither looks particularly pleased or displeased at him.
The elevator door opens before her friend can respond, and the two witches somehow push their way out and onto their floor. They walk away chatting amiably and as soon as the doors close, silence descends once more. A wizard taps his foot impatiently.
"Incredible, fantastic performance, as always. I'm so sorry to hear about the orphanage..." An elderly Muggle woman says.
Harry can’t remember a time when he thought his uncle, aunt, and cousin were in the right, but he does understand what it feels like to want to defend them anyways.
Harry manages a weak laugh before grabbing an empty wine bottle hidden in the corner. It'll have to do, he thinks with a grimace. After spelling some water in it and setting the flowers in the makeshift vase, he makes his way back to Draco.
Draco allows himself to be led to the kitchen, where a lopsided cake sits on the table, smeared with white icing, and topped with an icing serpent that’s been charmed to weave through the candles. He looks back at his coworkers.
“Good night, Malfoy.” Harry calls softly over his shoulder, before turning and walking arm-in-arm with Weasley through their threshold.
Ash's eyes are glittering when ze speaks, bowing zir head slightly. "Of course. We would be glad to help."
“Alright, lovebirds. Let’s settle down.” Harry pats the chair next to him. “The food is going to get cold.”
"Right? And I'm pretty sure the staff meeting will be about his group's further movements and not just about his break out." Seeing Harry's confused face, Ron explains, "I overheard Kingsley and Robards' one-on-one earlier today."
“There they are!” Prasad whisper-yells from the lip of the nest, the words nearly snatched away by the wind.
Time passes, and soon, heavy with wine and shitty vodka, breaths slow and ease into sleep. Beside Draco, Harry lies flat on his back, his eyes fixed on the sky. Where their arms nearly touch feels like a line of heat.
It's cold, but the group lines up behind the Muggles, who are chatting lively about everything - from the weather (cold and snowy) to what they did for Christmas to the performance they're about to watch.
The double entendre seems unintentional, but it’s not lost on Harry. “Sorry-! I was just...surprised is all.”
“No.” He’s a little embarrassed that it was their first guess. “I happened to run into Ma-Professor Malfoy and offered to carry his books in exchange with sitting in for a bit. I’m pretty interested in this uh...stuff.” Harry gestures vaguely toward the books sitting on their combined desk.
“Fuck,” Harry bites out. Spotty hoots reproachfully at his language, but Harry can’t bring himself to care very much right now. His brain is processing, running through all the possible responses he could send and trying to figure out which one would be able to convince Malfoy to go out for drinks with him.
"Harry." Harry resolutely refuses to look at his best friend, even though his voice has softened imperceptibly. "We love you. She still loves you. I just want you to apologize."
When Harry gets back home - no, to Draco's flat - dinner's already ready and waiting for him. And so is Draco. As they eat, Draco asks about his day, chats about progress he's made in his research - perhaps a little excessively. In fact, it occurs to Harry halfway through the meal that Draco's more chatty than usual.
His response is only a groan this time, but, miraculously, one of his legs lifts and lands on the ice.
But this is different. Music with words already bores him, so music without words is usually his go-to insomnia cure, but Harry can't take his eyes off of Draco. Definitely for self-serving reasons, but in the process of being glued to Draco's every move, every changing expression, Harry is really taking in the music for the first time.
The children groan, but leave him alone once Harry promises to play with them after dinner. Lucy, however, stays with him.
“I heard from Ron. That you were thinking of skipping work today.” Her hands are rested on her hips.
Two weeks later, it’s full-dark when a knock comes on Draco’s door. He sets his journal down and opens the door without looking through the glass.
Draco goes to use the washroom, and when he opens the door to step out, Prasad and Walker block him, and they crowd him back in and close the door.
"Uncle Draco, come play with us!" "Can we go flying, Uncle Draco?" "Come look at this, Uncle Draco!"
As he does every week, he walks the cobbled path to the small house, listening for the tinkling of the piano. But he doesn’t hear it today.
Grimmauld Place is dark and quiet when Harry stumbles back in. The ancient, Black furniture casts warped shadows in the moonlight, so Harry quickly spells the curtains shut. He pads into his kitchen - trying to be quiet for Kreacher and Spotty, both presumably already asleep - and glances at his liquor cabinet. He usually indulges after dinners with Hermione and Ron, but
Vaguely, Harry realizes that Draco's probably working his magic again, but it feels different from the Christmas concert. Then, Draco's magic teased the corners of his consciousness with a certain hesitation. Now, it's confident, controlled, and Harry can't help but to be swept up in it.
The compliment seems to placate Malfoy. He huffs but turns back around and continues walking. “I’ll let you know when the next one is,” he calls over his shoulder.
“Yes, well. Longbottom was kind enough to reach out after the trip - the original one. We’ve kept in contact ever since.”
” At that, Harry wrenches his hands out of Hermione’s grip and sits down at the table. It’s already been set, and steam rises enticingly from the pot of soup in the center. Harry turns his head to ask Hermione about the food and spots Ron sneaking up on her. He flashes an urgent look at Harry, and he knows what he must do.
Draco obliges, stepping into the riverbed, feeling the ghost of water flowing over his feet. They follow it downstream for a while, going home.
Hermione frowns in disappointment. "Alright. I respect that. But I'll second you, Arthur, I would be very interested in reading it when you finish."
Hermione asks, her eyes bright. "Are you thinking of getting it published somewhere? If it's what you say it is, I don't think anyone in the community has done what you've done."
He did not envision this: doing paperwork for a living, going asleep alone every night, and living only because he doesn't have enough energy to do anything else.
The Amber Tap is a modest brick building wedged between two other, larger clubs. It seems less assuming than the other clubs on the street, but it's the only one with a line poking out the door. From inside, Harry can see blue and purple light strobing gently and hear subdued conversation. No music, but Harry supposes they're waiting for the actual live music to start.
Whatever Draco thought Harry was going to say next, this definitely did not enter the realm of possibility for him. His eyebrows rise high, then higher, then higher again. His eyes are wide, and Harry swears his hair starts standing on end too, like a cat.
“Hell, no.” Ron Weasley curses before walking out the doors, and toward the parked car. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas follow him, calling their friend’s name.
Draco, in the face of all this information, simply raises an eyebrow. "That's very...interesting. And the secret is safe with me, I assure you."
WHAM! A snowball directly hits Harry's face, covering his glasses and dripping down to his lips. Harry reaches up to wipe his glasses clean, but endures another hit to the face and a third to his left shoulder.
Alarmed, Harry sits up and whips his head around, figuring it was the work of some rogue student out to sabotage them.
Sophia and Lucas, having finally decided on a topic, beam up at him. “Well, professor! We’ve decided to research chord progressions,” Sophia explains.
Malfoy’s face is unreadable. For a moment, Harry panics, thinking he has offended him, but it melts away when Malfoy’s face breaks out into a smile.
He looks at Harry quizzically, but knows not to press it here - especially since Edwards is still in the room, still seated at his chair, still staring at the table. He may seem out of it today, but he could still be secretly listening in. “Okay. If I don’t see you again, see you tomorrow?”
"Tom-" Arthur begins, but Ginny cuts him off. "Let's go, then!" She looks to Luna; their hands are still intertwined. "Would you like to?"
While he's waiting for a reply, Harry doodles some shapes in the corner of Jack Willow's case folder. No one would care to look twice at his reports, anyways, so it doesn't matter what he does with it as long as he maintains the illusion of productivity.
At one point Harry even takes the Map back out to check on Malfoy’s dot - just as he used to do in fifth year. The dot is resting comfortably in the spare room in the Astronomy tower. Harry keeps staring at it in hopes that it might give him some clue as to what is going through its owner’s mind. He thought he had Malfoy figured out from their meeting yesterday, but he never even gave a
Draco snaps the book shut and leans forward with interest. "Yes, how did you know? It's such a niche object - and rare too, due to the complicated spellwork done on it. To think it was just under my nose the whole time I was at Hogwarts..."
The files land on his desk in a heap, some of its contents spilling out and mixing with each other, but Harry can’t be bothered to care. Hermione and Ron are still out of the frame of his picture. The gray walls of his cubicle are unmoving and impassive.
Spread on the table are several dishes - sauteed greens, a cold noodle dish, and a whole fish that’s practically buried in chives and ginger.
"Thank you for your enthusiasm. Please relax and I hope you enjoy the rest of the show." His little speech down, he takes a seat and begins to play.
"...I guess," Draco finally concedes. "Sorry, I know I should take compliments better. I just feel like the second half wasn't...what I hoped it would be."
Even Arthur gets in on this. “And that is?” There’s nothing malicious behind his question, and none of the Weasley’s look angry either.
"Incredible. Thank you, Harry. Without you, Merlin knows how long it would have taken me to find another copy."
He has a point, most of their school years have been premised on competition - from Quidditch to schoolwork, everything has been grounds for fights, for comparison. Hell, just the other day they faced off in an intense snowball fight! Despite all the years in between now and Hogwarts, this, at least, has remained a constant in their relationship.
There’s a shush of fabric as Harry turns his head to look at Draco. “You really hate that idea, don’t you?”
“Explain, then.” Harry’s voice is hoarse, thick with an intense emotion, and it coils in the pit of his stomach - shaking his insides up with every passing second that his eyes stay latched onto Malfoy.
“We think they are set to hatch this year. And no, that is their aunt. In this particular species, the family members take turns guarding the brood during hibernation. Last year, one of their mothers kept watch.”
Second stop is Hagrid’s hut, where Harry says his goodbyes to his half-giant friend and his dog, and they exchange presents before they leave. Harry gifts Cane a new collar as his old one is barely hanging on by a thread, and Hagrid a pair of giant couple’s mittens - both wrapped, of course. Hagrid’s gift to him is small, but comfortably weighted. The two promise not to open each other’s presents until the next day. Malfoy is surprisingly calm during this exchange, and though he and Hagrid don’t exchange any more words than ‘Hello’ and ‘Goodbye,’ he
Narcissa smiled, her blonde hair falling all around her as she leaned over him. The light spilling from the hall barely reached them.
Clutching at each other and trying not to collapse in a heap of limbs onto the ice, the two men struggle and curse, trying to find their balance again but not daring to let go.
Harry argues about Quidditch with Ron for a bit - for the first time in years, really, since Harry finally had enough energy to get back into the sport two weeks ago. Thankfully, Draco caught him up on the most important bits and even alluded to being open to going to a match with him in the future - as long as the Chudley Cannons aren’t playing.
“When you lied, at the Manor, and didn’t give me away - that was a choice, too,” Harry says, tracing the eyes.
But suddenly, Malfoy stands up and moves across the classroom to look out the window. Harry watches his back warily.
It’s a little fast, and Draco’s mother made sure they knew that she thought so too when they had dinner together a week ago, but Harry has never been happier. What used to be tedious chores - laundry, cooking, cleaning - have become enjoyable with Draco there, doing and complaining about them alongside him. It’s still difficult for him to get up in the morning knowing that all that awaits him at work is a bland office and mountains of paperwork, but when Draco wakes him in the morning and all but orders him to go, Harry finds he cannot refuse.
Harry’s thoughts are interrupted when Draco slides on the couch and into his arms. They’ve stopped practicing, and someone has charmed the piano to play small ditties all by itself.
And he wishes he had done so earlier in his life. Draco plays piece after piece - some bright and bubbly and some frantic and fast - but Harry doesn't recognize any of them. He leans over to Arthur and asks him at the end of one of the pieces, while everyone's clapping, but he just shakes his head and shrugs in response. Even Arthur, the infamous Mugglephile and jazz-lover, doesn't know. Harry settles back in his seat, slightly disappointed at himself. He should've asked Draco when he got the chance - and he’d gotten it often in the past week that they've been at Hogwarts.
To their left comes running Prasad and Walker, followed by Amira and Dr. Khanyile. Walker yelps and screams as Prasad grabs at her waist, and the two wade deep into the pulling water. Amira flashes her wife a wicked grin, before rolling herself into the water as well - her enchanted wheelchair taking to the waves easily. Dr. Khanyile laughs and yells, “Wait for-” the rest of her sentence whirled away by the wind.
Though Longbottom has filled out over the years, now both taller and broader than Draco, it seems old fears die hard. His guts twist when Longbottom practically cowers, and says, “I see.”
They’re still giggling when they sit down and Harry resists a powerful urge to roll his eyes. These days, he’s not sure if he’s mildly disgusted or immensely jealous at their display. He wonders how they still seem so young. Fifteen fears after the war, one baby later, and they’re still in the honeymoon phase.
"Yeah!" "It was awesome!" The others clamor over themselves in agreement with her and crowd around Draco.
The children are all in various stages of unboxing their treasures - a few have immediately ripped their gift to shreds in an effort to figure out what's inside, and a few are methodically and carefully unwrapping, paying close attention so as not to even crinkle the paper. Lucy is part of the latter crowd.
Before them lies a pit dug in the sand, just wide around to fit a gray dragon coiled around the perimeter. The dragon shines dully, its scales like slabs of stone, and its stomach rises and falls as it sleeps. Nestled between its horned head and its slick tail are five eggs: black as obsidian, and just as smooth.
"Yes," Draco picks himself up from the couch, removes his coat, and begins rolling up his sleeves. The fire crackling in the fireplace illuminates him, scattering the colors of his shirt and turning it from maroon to red . "Get up, Harry, let's go. Molly, there's still time on the food, yes?"
For almost two hundred years now, dragon caretakers across the world have been assisting dragon hatchings, and dragons have learned to accept it. Draco is about to continue the tradition.
The castle looms at last, after the sun has begun its descent. Harry touches down at the Lake and walks the rest of the way.
Happy Friday! By this time next week I'll be in China visiting relatives, and I'll be over there for a few weeks. I'm expecting my update schedule not to change too much - still Mon/Wed/Fri - but the timing might be very off due to the massive time zone difference so I apologize in advance for that. Anyways, please enjoy Chapter 14! :)
I'm on tumblr: @Inofaro - I will be posting some of my thought processes behind this fic over there in the coming days, so if you're interested in that, check it out! And generally, that is where I post updates on current projects, so give me a follow if you enjoyed this and want to see more.
Thomas and Finnigan draw in a breath, and Draco knows that they’ve fit the pieces together at last: the flat stones laid in neat patterns, the range tapering into a tail in the distance, the arching, impossible peak, horn-like.
"Thank you Audrey, you're too sweet." Molly says while beaming at her. Every since the first time they met, Molly has been her biggest fan. Harry remembers, with some amusement, a conversation he overheard between Molly and Percy once when he was dating her, which really just consisted of Molly threatening him: "Percival, you better not mess this one up, or I will have several choice words."
"Welcome back." Hagrid greets Harry at the door, one big hand holding Cane back from slobbering all over Harry's face.
The blonde, immediately upon touching the mattress, stops moving and stares up at the ceiling. Somehow in the struggle the top three buttons of his shirt came unbuttoned, and Harry tries not to stare out of respect. “You move fast for a first date, Harry.” Other than a little slurring, he almost sounds completely sober.
He holds out his hand and Harry passes it over to him. While he inspects the previous spells cast on it, he tells Harry, "Get Kinglsey."
"I work at a Muggle jazz club weekday nights now, but I bounced around between many different occupations for a while."
But today, Edwards doesn't look half as mean as he usually does. His face is almost deflated, empty, devoid of much emotion. And when Robards addresses him, he only flinches and nothing else. Hughes is similarly silent, only nodding in acknowledgement of Robards' orders, but that’s in character. Ron nudges Harry under the table and the two share a fleeting, confused look. It looks like Ron doesn't know what's going on either.
Draco washes and towels off the baby. Its clawless paws cycle the air, and little mewls escape from its jaws. Through the towel, Draco can feel the nubs on its skull - the beginnings of the lustrous horns that take hundreds, even thousands of years to grow to their full length. When he’s done, he sets it down in front of the food. It snuffles at it, its eyes still wrinkled closed, but dutifully eats the first meal of its little life.
Lucius Malfoy is still alive. It’s a little known fact because the media has lost interest in him, and they’ve lost interest in him because he’s been Kissed. Harry feels uneasy and unsure of what is safe to say about him - everything seems like a landmine.
“I mean - you must think this is all so...dumb. She didn’t even live with us. It was only an occasional thing and even during the War when she was there at the Manor she was busy with other things anyways and you were
“Oh no, you were plenty help! And thank you.” He hesitates. “Mr. Harry...the other day...I seem to have upset you. When we were talking about the Auror department. I apologize for that.” He bows his slightly, his eyes downcast.
His wife puts on her coat and fiddles with the collar. "I think Arthur and I will head back to the Burrow. Are you kids staying?"
"Wow." Hermione leans back in her chair, her plate clean. "I'm guessing you drew a lot from Arithmancy?"
Before either of them can say anything more, Ron materializes at their table. "Yes, yes, you did." His voice is about half an octave higher than it usually is. He grips Harry's arm and helps him stand up. "Maybe we should call it a night?" His words are structured like a question, but it sounds more like a command than anything.
"I don't know how you do it, Draco," Fleur says breezily. She stands up and walks to the kitchen. "I'll just go and make some tea."
The photos associated with the suspected Death Eaters are blurry, the figures in them dark and shadowy. They seem less of an accurate tool for identification and more of the photographer’s best attempt at capturing a vague human form. Nothing much is listed in the description section - some estimates of their heights, weights, and some distinguishing features like the missing finger on the left hand of one of the suspects.
Draco leans in as soon as the waitress leaves to get their wine and place their orders. “So,” he begins, “what do you think so far?”
The defensive fort member can't even react. A snowball hits him between the eyes - courtesy of Sophia - and he goes down too.
Today, Harry hasn’t looked his way once, and why should he? There was nothing to see, anyways - just a man, alone.
Since it’s Christmas Eve and the house-elves are preparing a big, fancy dinner tonight, touch-ups of the decorations is high on the priority list today. After a quick trip to Hogsmeade to run errands, Harry’s finally doing what he came here for in the first place. Hagrid teases him before they split up once they get to the castle, “Finally got yeh back from Malfoy.” He chuckles at his own joke and pounds Harry’s back - which almost sends him flying - and walks off and down the hallway.
Desperately, Harry looks to Malfoy for help, but the git is feigning deafness and playing with the baby. “Er, yes. We went to school together.”
With horror, Harry realizes that Draco and his gaggle of fans have gotten dangerously close to his location without him noticing. He doubts that Draco will be fooled by his pitiful disguise, so he quickly ducks away, toward the donation table.
Malfoy sniffs and sticks his nose up. "Ever since you came back into my life - what - a week ago? I have never known monotony."
Robards still looks pissed - like a tea kettle boiling with the lid sealed shut - but he can't let out any steam yet, not in front of Kingsley. Taking a deep breath, he begins. "Brown, Jones, Robinson, you three are our main connection between the agents in the field and the Ministry - me and the Minister. Each of you will be in charge of closely monitoring a group, and you will be responsible with reporting and documenting their movements as well as staying up to date with their safety.
They begin sleeping in the same bed at night - Draco’s bed. Harry on the right, Draco on the left. The sound of Harry’s breathing becomes as familiar to Draco as the fluxes of Snowdonia; the rains and droughts, the tides of the seasons. Before he slips into sleep, Harry’s warmth is the last thing he takes comfort in. And when he wakes, Harry is the first thing his hands reach for.
“Harry, it’s okay.” Draco cups Harry’s face. The tears that were in his eyes earlier have all but disappeared.
“Good morning everyone,” he greets the class when they step back in the room. He’s got his teacher voice on: kind, yet no-nonsense. “Today we’re continuing your projects, so please come up and pick up the books you used yesterday.” The students follows his directions and soon the sounds of focused research and conversation fill the classroom once again. Harry takes a seat next to Sophia and Lucas, as he did yesterday.
He draws their history, their ancient rivalries and epic battles, their clashes with wizardkind; each claw and fang and tearing howl. They crowd forth with their questions. Draco answers all. Surrounded by behemoths and a staggering, untouchable history, every guest Draco has led to this location becomes childlike in their wonder. Their bodies shrink, but their eyes grow with firelight. Curiosity, so often pushed down in their adulthood, rises again like sparks in the dark air.
"I-I don't know," Harry stammers, like a fool, "Just wondering. Glad to hear she's well. And you said she’s close to the sea? That’s nice.”
Public events like those were always hell, what with hordes of hungry reporters and arse-kissers constantly on the Golden Trio’s tail, but at least they had each other to rely on.
At that moment, the door opens and Hermione and Ron step in. Ron's dressed in a black suit and a red bowtie, and a white, folded pocket square is poking out of his breast pocket.
"She’s right," Hermione jumps in, scrutinizing his look. "You don't look half bad like that. Especially with the suit."
Draco’s arms are warm. His body is warm. His breath smells like alcohol, but Harry doesn’t mind it as much as he usually would.
After Draco takes a quick shower, he finally slides in Harry’s waiting arms. His skin is hot and wet from the shower water.
"Oh, I'm sure. I think that even the Ministry would be very impressed with the idea." Hermione leans forward. "I've heard rumors for years now that they're trying to expand the Ministry's Magical Research department. They're just rumors, but I think that they have a lot of truth in them. In comparison to Ministries globally, Great Britain's is near the bottom - research-wise, at least. But don't tell Arthur, and especially not Percy, that I told you this. I heard it from Ron."
As some sort of compromise with himself, Harry leans against the wall and digs out the Marauder's Map that he had stuffed in his back pocket. The dot named Draco Malfoy, flanked by several other dots, moves through the castle at a steady pace. It’s not an illusion. No charms or trickery. That’s Draco Malfoy in the flesh, looking equal parts dignified and approachable in his long, flowy robes. Harry suddenly isn't sure what he's looking for, so he folds the Map back up and makes his way back to Hagrid's hut.
Despite himself, Draco feels his lips quirk up. “No, Weasley, she will not ‘blast us,’ as you say. There is a reason we are here in winter. You are right that they are very protective when they are awake, which is why we don’t usually come here as caretakers - much less bring guests.”
Malfoy smiles. “It was a fantastic success, of course. Your choice of music went over very well.” Then, he reaches into a pocket in his coat, pulls out a handful of notes, and holds them out to the girl. “Here.”
The funeral is private, but that doesn’t stop word from getting out. No one shows up to jeer - after about three years of that, people decided it wasn’t worth the bother anymore. Not like the Malfoys are ever doing anything interesting.
Draco smiles gracefully. "I should be thanking all of you for coming and supporting the kids. Thank you for caring."
“If there aren’t any questions, we mobilize now.” Kingsley finishes the meeting and the Aurors practically stampede out of the room, voices overlapping and growing volume as they all try to consult with each other and shout orders at the same time. Robards leaves to try to herd them toward the elevator and the apparition point.
Blinking slowly, Lucas says, “...Yes. You’re right. Sorry.” They resume their task of combing through the books, half-teaching themselves Muggle physics and half-researching proof for the theories they began to formulate about music and magic at the end of yesterday’s class.
Then, he pulls out several towels - one for each egg - and the water basin, enchanted to retain water and replace it automatically.
They sit, unspeaking, for several moments. Blood thrums in Draco, a rush in his hands and legs. The vial in his pocket - the one he grabbed in the half-dark, hours before - burns. He reaches in, and takes it out.
A pause. With a fluid motion, Amira turns her wheelchair towards the exit. “I’d better let you get to it, then.”
Draco’s explanation of some of the theory is interesting - but not really because of the subject matter itself. Harry has never been particularly musically inclined, anyways. In fact, he's never really had a favorite singer or band in his life. He rarely even listens to music at all. When he met up with Dudley a few years ago, just to catch up and make amends, his cousin offered to buy him a popular Muggle music player - out of guilt or whatever else, Harry doesn't know - but Harry ultimately turned him down and the two ended up just grabbing lunch at a pricey Muggle restaurant. He wouldn't have any use for it, and he didn't foresee ever finding a use for it. Ginny mostly likes the mainstream Wizard artists, and she used to play them in the house all the time when they were married, but Harry got used to tuning them all out.
Draco turns back, so he’s facing the open stretch of stars once again. When he quiets his breath, he fancies he can feel a slight movement beneath him: the slow rise and fall of Glyder Fawr’s slumber.
"Thank you, dear!" Molly calls out without taking her eyes off of what looks like a pair of mittens slowly forming under her skilled hands.
Harry notices out of his periphery that a few of the spectators have been creeping closer, while the rest - mostly the children - have stayed back.
Cane.” The door opens and the dog practically leaps into Harry’s arms, licking every inch of exposed skin. Hagrid chuckles. “Welcome back ‘arry. Sorry abou’ Cane - he’s bin cooped up in ‘ere all winter.”
Wizardkind has long played a critical role in the perpetuation of the dragon species. Perhaps in response to the worsening air quality due to the Muggle Industrial Revolution, dragons began laying broods with thicker and thicker shells to protect the embryos inside. However, the eggs eventually reached a thickness that the babies inside are unable to break through - leaving them trapped inside, starving to death.
Amira’s platitudes, Prasad’s cautious jokes, Walker’s shoulder squeezes - they are stones to him, gray and lifeless. All of it falls away, like the husks of skin and dull scales he harvests from the dragon nests. Hollowed out, pale without blood thrumming beneath it, Draco does his job, and he does it damn well, but always, he remembers: Harry Potter, tilting his head in farewell. Harry Potter’s hands on the wheel, expertly backing out. Harry Potter’s car pulling off with the friends he chose, to his wife he chose, toward the future he chose.
“I know!” Malfoy stares at a knot in the wooden floor by Harry’s feet instead of actually making eye contact. “I was just...curious - about what he said to you at breakfast. You don’t have to share if you don’t want to, but,” he meets Harry’s eyes and puffs out his chest a little, “I think personal conflicts among faculty are ultimately a detriment to harmonious learning environments.”
Draco imagines it: him, dressed up, mingling among the dozens of Weasleys and Weasley-adjacents, and trying the finger food. Watching Harry wait for someone else. Listening to his vows for someone else. Watching him kiss someone else.
“What else Potter? I play with the children.” The light condescension in Malfoy’s tone sends a shiver down Harry’s spine. It brings back memories. The mug is back on the table now, but Malfoy’s finger lingers, tracing the rim. Harry stares at the movement as his mind turns over all the new information.
The opposite team seems to have a similar plan in mind: Malfoy seems to be on defense, and with him are two students following his building instructions. Their two offensive players dash exactly as Stella and Sophia did, so now each pair is facing off. Lucas is one of them, but he’s facing off against Stella and not Sophia - but Harry feels like a Sophia-Lucas battle would be much more interesting to see.
Harry’s painfully aware of the barista at the counter, who’s cleaning out one of the machines and probably listening  in.
The height of summer, and they are laying on their bedrolls in the open air. They’ve made camp at the same place they stopped when they first visited Glyder Fawr, half a life ago. Their fire has burnt down to coals, then extinguished to nothing, but the smell of smoke lingers no matter how the gentle summer winds try to carve it away.
He thinks. "Well, I did my best. Couldn't protect everyone, though." Mad-Eye Moody. Tonks. Remus. Sirius. Fred. Just thinking about them gives him a tender ache in his chest - it's gotten less piercing over the years, but never has it gone away entirely. He doubts it ever will.
From downstairs somewhere, Harry hears some dishes clatter and hopes that it's Kreacher. And also hopes that he's making breakfast to take up for him.
After briefly squeezing Harry’s hand, Draco marches off toward a gaggle of Aurors in the distance, ignoring the jeers from the reporters and wiping at his face.
Harry’s face, in the near-dark, is unreadable. “Okay. I won’t.” His fingers turn a sprig of grass over and over. “Sorry.”
Next Friday is Draco’s 38th birthday, and Harry’s been planning a surprise party for months. Andromeda and Teddy are hosting and the guest list has gotten long. The Weasley’s are coming, of course. Belle and Ava are too, along with Jonathan, whom they adopted from the Harmony Orphanage two years ago. He’ll be joined by Pat and the rest of his friends from the orphanage who haven’t aged out already. Angelica’s flying down from University of Edinburgh, where she’s taking summer classes, and Dan’s taking off from his part-time job at
The blonde closes his eyes and holds up a hand to his temples like he's about to faint and proclaims dramatically, "I have not known peace."
Ginny reaches over and squeezes her hand, smiling. "I second that. You never seemed that way in Hogwarts, at least.”
Hermione carries on the conversation she and Draco were having outside. "Do you have young relatives...?"
They then move to an adjoining room - the kitchen - and it’s somehow even more hectic than the living room. The counters are cluttered with papers which, upon closer inspection, are colorful crayon drawings. The dining table is in a similar state, and in the corner stands a small piano. It’s not the same kind that’s in Andromeda’s house - that one’s a grand but this one is an upright, Harry thinks it’s called. And it doesn’t have the sleek, black finish that Andromeda’s has either but rather a brown, chipping coat of paint.
Malfoy’s smile moves to one side and his eyes are suddenly downcast. “I haven’t practiced the piece since the show…”
Harry’s heart plummets. “Oh-no-please, please don’t apologize. Lucas, you did nothing wrong, I promise. It’s my fault for getting so worked up.”
Harry’s halfway down the hall, having passed a few empty portrait frames, when he turns on his heel, storms back the way he came, and raps on Malfoy’s door. It opens pretty much instantaneously, as if Malfoy was still standing in front of it.
Draco takes a deep breath before continuing. "As you probably already know, they lost their home - the Harmony Orphanage - a few weeks ago. This concert is to raise money to buy a new, better home for them."
Draco looks over, and almost starts at the look on Harry’s face. Open, serious, pointed like an arrow towards Draco.
Follow me on tumblr @bonsoirpunpun if you want to keep up with what I'm doing/want to know the lunatic behind this fic jhfaksdkjk
The blonde smiles slyly, as if he’s sharing some inside joke with himself. “A few things. I’m currently following a lead that seems to be very promising.” Harry has to stop himself from flinching at the memories of the all-too familiar cubicle that the words “following a lead” conjure up for him.
After putting their crup - a smiley pitbull christened Trent by Hagrid - to bed and fighting over the first shower before settling on taking one together, Draco and Harry are finally ready for bed.
he’s heard a few slurs tossed around at office parties. Racial profiling is rampant in the department, too - which is why tracking down and persecuting the
"We're doing well. It's my first time hearing Draco perform, and I'm pleasantly surprised so far." Hermione stands up and the two women exchange a handshake.
The kids, with some coaxing by Arthur, leave the living room - new toys still in hand. Harry looks at Lucy, who has been walking her new stuffed hippogriff up and down his arm, shoulders, neck, and head for the past few minutes. "Breakfast?"
Unable to come up with a good response, Malfoy opts to just lightly punch Harry on the shoulder instead.
Harry glances out the window and spots Rose, Hermione, and Ron outside. Rose is playing with her broom again, with her parents trying to spot her. Harry watches as she tumbles from her broom, laughing and smiling while Ron and Hermione hover anxiously.
Harry doesn’t hesitate for a moment and wraps Hagrid in a hug and laughs into his shoulder. “It’s about time!”
Outside the window, Harry can see that a fresh layer of snow has fallen overnight. Now, he suspects it almost covers the front door. But it's not snowing now - on the contrary, it seems like a nice day, sunny, with minimal wind. A redbird perches on the window ledge and regards him through the glass, cocking its head.
They begin eating, and don’t stop until the plates are practically licked clean. Groaning, Harry sits back in his seat, tempted to pop open his fly to give his stomach more room - which he’d seen Jackie Chan do in one of his old martial arts movies that he and Draco had watched once. “For the culture!” Harry had said, brandishing the Muggle VCR tape in front of a doubtful Draco.
“Catch.” In an arc of brilliant blues and greens and reds, the clothes soar through the air and land in an impossibly neat pile on Harry’s lap. The cat has vanished.
After brief introductions with the rest of his team - Robin, Stella, and Gordon - they all get down to business.
Draco knows what he is thinking of. “The Tri-Wizard Tournament? The dragons they carried in for that were deliberately agitated. Under ordinary circumstances, they would not have paid us humans any mind at all.”
“I was in the fores’ with Gawp when it came! Read the letter an’ maybe got a little too excited - I think the centaurs are mad at me again.” He shrugs. “Oh well. More tea?”
“And Mother was, naturally, reminded of her sister. So she talked about her for a little bit.” A pauses. “And she said that she still loves Bellatrix. Even after everything, she still loves her.”
Stella answers him. “The rules are: no wands, no cheating, and no contact with anything other than snow. At the start of the game we’ll all pile up our wands in our territory and the other team will do the same with theirs in their territory. The objective is to steal all the wands from the other team.”
They’re all shouting at and over each other, each one trying to be the first outlet to break what they probably sense is a juicy story. But Robards - though he is an asshole and a tyrant - is the best in possibly the entire Ministry with dealing with the press. He’s been doing it for several decades, after all.
"Oh no you don't!" A snowball flies by Harry, and for a moment he's distracted by the sheer amount of force put behind the throw. Malfoy's getting down to business. A second one clips Harry's ear, and he takes it as a hint to begin running in a zig-zag pattern.
Giving Harry a slight smile and handing him the change, she says, “Perfect. I’ll bring it around soon.” Then, she gestures to a table near the front window. “You might want to sit there. That’s his favorite spot.”
He doesn't have the Snitch. He never reached it, so it's still flying out in front of them, but Harry doesn't care about that now. While pulling the broom back into a sudden stop with only his legs, Harry uses both hands to grab onto Draco's. He's heavy, and Harry vaguely notices Draco’s broom falling to the ground beneath them, but by utilizing all the muscles he hasn't worked out in years, Harry somehow manages to secure Draco onto his broom. And by secured, he means the blonde isn’t falling anymore - but with the way he's desperately trying not to slip off, grasping at the twigs and at Harry's arms, he doesn't seem any less anxious about his situation. He's more slung over the broom than actually riding it; he's balancing on his stomach and his legs are dangling off the side. Harry knows he can't hold that position for long.
Although Kingsley’s nowhere to be seen, Robards is there, standing in front of the door almost in an effort to guard it and prevent the crowd from entering.
They dig in. Draco finds himself quite ravenous after another long day packaging manure. Prasad smears a bit of icing on their girlfriend’s face, and the ever-stoic Lin Walker cracks a smile. Amira challenges Harry to a game of Exploding Snap, and when Harry loses - which was most of the games they played - he laughs and laughs, his voice a miracle in the setting light.
"S-o-o...." She begins, her voice drawing out that one vowel for an absurdly long time before she actually starts talking. "How was last night?" When Harry looks over at her, she's wiggling her eyebrows at a pace that he could never hope to mimic. Her voice has entered suggestive territory, and Harry has a growing suspicion about what she's referring to.
“Fine.” Harry heads toward the kitchen, looking around for something to do with his hands - cooking, setting the table, anything.
The club is winding down now, and prerecorded jazz songs play softly from the speakers, almost in tune with the gentle strobing lights. Harry and Draco take a seat in one of the many empty tables near the stage. Draco lays the bouquet down on the table and props his elbows on the table and rests his head on his hands and sighs deeply.
” Harry instinctually catches Draco in his arms when he slumps forward. “But I should've known they w-wouldn't give up. Merlin I’m such an
Or maybe he's already on the ground, staking them out with a Weasley Wizard Wizzes' patented Disillusionment cloak on, or dashing through darkened alleyways, sending flashes of light at the figures in the distance. Harry lays his head down on the small empty space on his desk.
More than once, Draco had come stomping into the house, cursing and peeling off his stained, sweat-soaked work gloves. They were the ones he used to do everything, from gardening to manure collection, but although he has grown accustomed to almost all the dirty realities of his job and lifestyle - muddied, sweaty hands remained a sticking point.
“Don’t forgive him.” Draco moves his head closer. “You say he was young, and so he was. But everyone was young once, too, but not everyone was like him.”
There is silence for a few seconds as Harry stares at the grain of his desk and Ron regards him coldly. In the distance, there's a loud noise followed by raucous laughter.
The children seem okay on the surface - covered from head to foot in soot and ash and dressed in slightly tattered pajamas, sure, but okay.
Both of their careers haven't slowed down much since then - quite the opposite, in fact - but with their professional success has come more flexibility in regards to their schedules. They often had to miss family get-togethers like Christmas in the past, but now they can actually take some time off.
They are silent and unmoving for one, loaded moment before: “Fine.” Draco says, ducking out of the door frame and out of Harry’s range. “If you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine, I apologize for being so intrusive.”
After one last song that Draco finishes with a series of extremely quick notes, played by - to Harry's astonishment - only two fingers, Draco stands up with a flourish, bows, and exits the stage to thunderous applause. The lights come up and chatter resumes in the club, but few people actually leave.
As soon as Harry reads the note, and rereads it, and rereads it again, he slams it down onto the kitchen table, startling Spotty into finding another perch on the back of a chair, and starts cooking his breakfast with newfound strength.
Though Harry’s all-too-aware of every single pair of eyes on him in this moment, he steps forward anyway for Draco’s sake; he deserves a proper introduction. “Everyone, this is Draco, my date tonight.”
The owl came a month ago - the one that invited Draco to be the main speaker of the inaugural International Music-Magic conference, held in Bucharest. Draco had practically torn the piece of parchment to shreds while reading it, which greatly annoyed Narcissa, who wanted it intact and in her scrapbook.
Malfoy looks back at Harry, sighs, and stops. There are many heavy-looking books tucked in his arms - Harry spots what seems to be a Muggle Physics textbook.
They never went back, and they never went to the sea again. When he’d asked to at least see the English Channel, they had refused. Nothing to see, just water. And besides, your mother would be worried - you can’t swim.
Harry directs his attention back to the table just in time to see Molly taking out an enormous jug of tequila and setting it on the table. It’s the jug that she saves for special occasions, mostly pregnancy announcements. “Let’s celebrate!” Bill, Ron, George, and Ginny cheer and drain whatever liquid’s remaining in their cups in preparation. She doesn’t waste any time in divvying out the alcohol to most everyone, occasionally pouring too much, causing some to spill on the tablecloth.
Harry presses a kiss to his temple. His voice warm, he says, “I’m happy for you. And thank you. Thank you for everything. Oh Merlin, this is going to be so fun.”
One of the witches drops her voice but it's an elevator, so everyone can still hear her. "Do you think we could...sneak in? When is it anyways?"
Harry wishes he could stand and clap for the woman, but Ron’s firm, restraining hand on his thigh indicates that it might not be an entirely appropriate time for it.
He whispers back, "Talked to the bartender." She cranes her head to look over, spots Ava, and lets out a low whistle.
Draco feels a headache approaching, like when he stands on the tallest hill and spots the darkening clouds from miles away. Prasad chuckles. “Good luck, Draco.”
Her eyes open wide as she looks up at Harry - for a moment, Harry sees Hermione’s face in her, despite her of shock of similarly curly, but red hair. “Really!?”
Ginny is the one to release the Snitch, since she also volunteered to be the referee. With a golden flash, it's gone from her hand immediately, but Harry's keen eye has remained intact through the years. He subtly follows it from the corner of his eye, but tries to make it seem as though he's lost it. Glancing at Draco, he realizes that, either the blonde's doing the same thing, or he actually doesn't know where the Snitch is.
"Okay," he manages to get out before Ron all but wrestles him over to the group and out the door. The last sight Harry gets before the door slams shut is Draco sitting at the very front of the club, giving him a slight wave.
Without hesitation, without any orders, Harry picks up the snowballs that tumbled to the ground when he fell, throws them all at Malfoy with ferocious force, and barrels forward without any thought to his own well-being.
They often speculate about Harry's role in the entire ordeal: a spy? a mediator? a leader? a lead investigator? The theories run as wild as they want them to and the public snaps it all up; the first issue of the Prophet that broke the news was almost impossible for anyone to get their hands on, it ran out of print that quickly.
Harry had sent a Patronus ahead of their arrival, giving them a brief rundown of the situation, and asking them to refrain from potentially inflammatory comments. And a promise to explain once it's all over. But again, in hindsight, maybe he could've explained a little better.
Prasad lays their hand on Draco’s arm, their touch gentle, and their brown eyes warmer than Draco has ever seen them: “You deserve it, Draco. And he wants to give it to you.”
"Thank Merlin." They reach the meeting room and find that most everyone has arrived before them. The double doors are propped open and inside is seated all the Aurors with Kingsley at the head of the long table. All heads turn to look at them as Ron and Harry draw close.
Sunlight streams in from all sides. The lobby is empty, save for a few dusty couches, the receptionist desk, the temporary receptionist, and Draco.
"Not at all." Harry keeps on talking. He can't stop. He can't will his mouth to close. Every thought that forms in his brain immediately leaves. "In fact, it's the opposite."
“You’re right, it’s not the same.” Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead. It’s sweaty, but familiar on Harry’s lips. “But that doesn’t make it hurt any less.”
Ron checks his watch - Harry’s wedding present to him - and says, “You’d better hurry up. It’s 6:50.” Harry idly wonders why he got Ron a watch but didn’t bother getting one for himself.
The students burst into laughter, unable to keep it in anymore. Harry rolls his eyes and catches Malfoy give him a cheeky wink when the student's aren't watching.
As Harry approaches the empty seat next to the new Potions professor - Professor Gill - the students behind him quiet a little and stare at his back. Hagrid is already seated at the High Table, talking animatedly with Professor Sprout. Neville doesn’t seem to be here yet, Harry notices - or maybe he has already gone home for the holidays. Harry hopes it’s the latter. Headmistress McGonagall catches Harry’s eye and nods slightly.
Molly smiles and waves a dismissive hand at him. "Oh shush. Not like you would remember if something did happen."
"How's Gawp?" Hermione, in a desperate attempt to change the conversation,  continues her questions.
“I-uh-wh-?” Harry suddenly realizes what he means as the true gravity of the situation they’re in settles on him. “Oh.
at the books as they begin to pore over them. Harry glances at the physics textbook his neighbor receives, but can’t figure out anything on the page that might be even slightly interesting.
Vaguely, he also wonders what Draco's doing right now. Maybe sleeping. Maybe at that cafe. Maybe even at the orphanage. When Harry closes his eyes, he can imagine the blonde at any location, relaxing, smiling, working.
The light of the candle flickers across Draco’s face as he speaks, drawing Harry’s attention to the sharpness of his cheekbones, the fullness in his lips…
The group reappears, walking sullenly from the side of the building. Weasley is redder than usual, but isn’t shouting anymore. Harry locks eyes with Draco through the glass, sending his heart tumbling.
Feeling slightly awkward, but also stubbornly unwilling to display any kind of weakness in front of the bastards in the room - especially Robards - Harry strides in with Ron following him and they take their seats. As soon as they do, the doors swing shut and the meeting begins.
“Of course.” Harry leads them to the side, away from children, the Aurors, and the reporters. “Are you okay? I’m so-”
She claps her hands together - which makes a slightly odd noise, due to all the rings on her right hand clinking with all the rings on her left hand. “Oh, then I
Time flies when Draco's playing; before Harry knows it, it's late into the night and Draco just lifted his hands from the piano from the last time - with a flourish - and the audience practically jumps to their feet as one in passionate applause.
Neither of the two men speak for a few moments. Draco looks deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowing a little bit, and Harry - well - Harry isn’t sure
The men sit in their awe for a long time. Watching the bruising sky, pointing to the hashed lines of exposed rock - so clear to them, now, that they are scars of long settled battles. They ask Draco if the other mountains are dragons, as well. He says:
The textbooks in Harry’s arms are beginning to painfully cut into his flesh. “Yes…? Why else did you think-”
“...I apologize.” He says stiffly, his eyes trained on what lies ahead. “It seems that I’ve misunderstood the situation.”
Weeks pass but Harry barely notices. The days and nights blend into one - sunrises, sunsets, dawn, dusk, Harry can't tell the difference anymore. All he knows is to lay unsleeping in his bed when it is dark - or when Kreacher gently hints at him to - rise after some time, dress, go to work, and come back and repeat the process when he feels he has sat at his desk for enough to be counted present and working.
The kitchen isn’t sealed off from the living room, so Harry can see the black counters and a dining table with nothing but a maroon tablecloth with white trim thrown over it. The bathroom door is closed and the bedroom, which Malfoy has entered, seems to be similarly red-themed like the rest of the space - at least from what Harry can see in the small crack between the door and its frame.
He considers this. “You’re right, people used to live here. Mostly likely Muggles - ancestors of the Welsh.”
"Thank you for coming on such short notice, during such a busy time," Kingsley begins, surveying the room. There's a flicker of pity in his eyes. "This will be quick, I promise."
When Malfoy enters the coffee shop with a jingle of the bell, the barista looks up and calls to him: “Hey Draco. Your friend’s over there.” Malfoy’s head turns and, seeing his impassive face and piercing eyes, Harry shrinks into his jacket. Malfoy turns back around, orders with a voice so soft he’s inaudible, and walks over to Harry.
“We’re volunteering at the pound! Sorry, Draco, we’ll talk to you next time,” Angelica yells on her way out, letting the door slam.
Hermione closes her book quickly, walks into the bathroom, and wraps Harry in a hug. “Welcome back to the living.”
Kingsley and Robards constantly make a strange pair, no matter the context. Right now, for the example, Kingsley’s face is perfectly smooth, not ripple of any emotion other than thoughtfulness, while Robards’ face looks like a volcano about to erupt; his facial features are shifting endlessly, quivering, like molten lava is slowly moving them around, making his eyebrows bunch closer and closer together.
“I do.” Harry runs his hand through his hair. “We haven’t seen each other in so long. I’m curious about what you’re doing now.”
The air is tense when Harry walks into the conference room. No one is sitting, preferring to instead lean against the walls, arms crossed, and eyes darting from Auror to Auror. Ron glances at him when he comes in, but looks away as soon as he recognizes who it is. Harry tries to appear unaffected.
Malfoy opens his mouth to reply, but just then the woman yelps in alarm while staring at the clock over the piano. “Dan, Angelica, you’re going to be late!”
"That must be Bill," Fleur says while staring at the ceiling before following Molly into the kitchen.
Harry buries his head under his sheets until the darkness is complete around him. "Nope." No one will miss him anyway - except for maybe Ron. But even then he'll probably understand. Harry's missed work a lot in the past, so none of this is new. Sure, he was reprimanded by Kingsley himself when he skipped for extended periods of time in the past - probably because everyone knows that he's the only person in that damned Ministry that Harry is willing to listen to anymore - but nobody will notice one absence. Harry's been keeping good on his promise of punctuality and perfect attendance so far, so just one cheat day won't hurt.
"Alright. If no one has any further questions, this meeting is adjourned. Remember, report any unusual or suspicious activity back to either me or Gawain." Seeing that no one is raising their hand, Kingsley stands, takes the file folder in front of him, and begins to leave. "Good work everyone, and good luck. Hopefully we can resolve this soon. Gawain, if you please."
Harry rubs soothing circles into Draco’s back as the latter slouches in the face of defeat on both physical and spiritual levels.
"Harry?" It's Ron. He stops outside the door and knocks. If it were Hermione and she were coming to check up on him because he skipped work, the door would have flown off the hinges by now. And this isn't merely conjecture - it has precedent. Spelling the pieces of the door back together is more difficult than it should be, mostly because all the splinters of wood are hard to find back.
While Ginny, Luna, Hermione, Ron, Molly, and Arthur contribute to that chatter and try to pass off as Muggles, Harry nods along and listens in on the Muggles' conversations. He perks up when they mention Draco.
Draco leans forward and squints at the phone. "Why can't you apparate? If you don't mind my asking."
The true horror comes when, spreading like a second skin, his old, old fantasies live again. The yearning he’d felt daily, hearing their laughter tables away, watching them walk the grounds together from a window up high. His shameful desire, the endless
They take their leave, and with one final wave to Pat and the children crowded on the doorstep, they round the corner and are alone again.
Despite his efforts to imagine what a "Musical Theory" class with Malfoy could be like, Harry can't conjure up anything. Perhaps Malfoy is teaching them piano? Or other instruments? A sudden image of the Hogwarts student body in dress robes playing an orchestral concert invades Harry's mind.
Though he told him not to that morning, Draco is waiting up for Harry, hunched over his keyboard, composing like mad. He twists to look at Harry when he comes in. “Hey.”
Luckily, with the opposing team's offense completely tied up with Sophia and Stella, Harry has a clear path to the wands. He charges forward, but swerves right to avoid a snowball from Malfoy. There's a glint in his gray eyes as he prepares to throw the second one.
It seems foolish to classify the Christmas Day crowd as 'large' now. While the line was out the door that night, it's coiled tightly up and down the street tonight, and the club itself seems like it's bursting at the seams. The two bouncers at the door are working frantically trying to let in as many people as possible while also ordering the people already inside to make room.
Harry feels a sudden rush of empathy for her, but also for Draco. More often than not now, Harry also finds himself choosing to rush home instead of spending time with his loved ones. "He can be stubborn, but I promise he's a good guy."
It’s a busy week - both Prasad and Walker are out on extended camping excursions, leaving Draco and Amira at base, alone, to prepare for five new baby dragons.
vomit. The piece are beginning to come together now. “I Side-Alonged you. But only after you threw up in the alley.”
"Good evening. How are you two doing tonight?" Harry recognizes her as Belle, the owner of the club.
"I try to come most nights that he's here, and I know that he has something special planned tonight. I couldn't make it to the one last Christmas, but I heard it was incredible - he even started planning with his elbows at one point!"
He’s right, but Harry’s already in too deep; he has no choice but to push on. “Don’t worry! They’ll love you!” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at that, but strangely, Harry finds himself believing his words. “I promise! It’ll be fun.”
"However should I know? He arose in the early hours of the morning, looked at me, took your sweater off, and threw it at me. I certainly did nothing to offend."
He's already thinking about next time and they haven't even made it out of Harry's house yet. Harry gulps. "O-okay."
Hermione clears her throat, and everyone's attention immediately snaps to her. "Everyone, I have an announcement to make."
By contrast, Harry's wearing a mustard-colored sweater that hangs a little too loose at the arms and that Ginny once called "uglier than Umbridge and Voldemort's lovechild,” some bootcut jeans - which he has also endured a lot of hate for, mainly from Ginny as well - and a loyal, but worn out, pair of runners.
Slowly, Malfoy speaks, “It’s an interesting idea, but I don’t think my work is all that groundbreaking yet. Or interesting, even.” He stands and walks to the window. “It’s late. And it looks bad out there.” With a twirl, he’s facing Harry again. “Where are you staying again?”
He turns and walks to the door. “Welcome to the team,” he tosses over his shoulder, before pushing open the door and getting back to work.
When he cranes his head to look across the field, he sees the one with all of their wands, the student that Harry thought was going to beat him: Lucas. He's laying perfectly still, face up in the snow, staring at the sky. Malfoy jogs over and gives him a hand and the two and the rest of their team huddle around and smile and talk.
And with that, without even waiting for a reaction, Draco leaves them, walks into the kitchen and says his goodbyes there, and glides out the front door with his trunks floating along behind him. The 'pop' of Apparition sounds moments later, and he's gone.
"What will it be, sir?" Her eyes reflect the blue and purple rays of light bouncing all over the place.
Arthur thinks to himself for a moment. "I don't think so. We put the children to bed soon afterwards, anyways."
of everyone in the department. Aurors preach against hate, against discrimination, but a few of Harry’s coworkers still pull the corner of their eyes back when Kingsley’s not looking at staff meetings and Harry
Suddenly, as Harry's settling down on the floor again with his drink, he spots the stack of textbooks they used for class on the table and realizes something. "Malfoy."
For the the next several minutes Harry alternates between sitting in his chair and staring blankly at his wall and leaning back and hoping to 'accidentally' fall asleep as he waits for an owl from Robards to give him some direction.
The afternoon sun peeks out from behind a few clouds. His mood drops when he realizes he has work in the morning, but soars higher than before when he remembers he’s having dinner with Hermione, Ron, and Rose in a few hours and falling asleep in Draco’s arms a few more hours after that.
“I-” Draco pauses, then bows his head. “Thank you, everyone.” When he looks back up, Harry is beaming, his smile scorching.
Lucas, who’s been silent throughout this exchange, suddenly speaks with a light in his eyes. “You’re an Auror, right?”
'd that the security on him was...not great. That plus some of the guards had snuck off and had their own holiday party on Christmas, so be probably saw a chance and took it."
“O-okay.” Draco whispers. “Okay.” He withdraws from Harry’s hug, leaving him cold. His mouth is set in a tight, grim line. The fire has mostly burnt out by now, but the glowing embers it leaves behind still cast shadows across Draco’s gaunt face.
Then, Longbottom asks him a question regarding the wild grass bordering their trail, and their conversation carries them. Without prompting, Longbottom shares that he is an Herbology professor at Hogwarts now, and he takes special interest in flora native to the Isles, aiming to research some particularly rare species. Draco entertains him, and before long the sun is high, and they’ve reached the foot of the mountain.
“No,” his voice a growl, “it’s not okay.” Harry throws his arms around Draco and squeezes tightly. “It’s not okay at all.”
The only thing that spurs Harry to actually go to work and not mope around at home is the thought that Hermione might invite herself over again at any point and give her a piece of her mind for their conversation last night. No - it wasn't a conversation, it was a full blown argument. Probably one of the worst ones they've had in several years. Harry half expects a Howler from Ginny to drop in on his head at any moment; she and Hermione seem to have formed some kind of pact a while back, whenever Harry's being an ass to one of them, they tell each other and the other one comes and knocks some sense into Harry. It's a pretty good system, Harry begrudgingly acknowledges.
Draco’s silent for so long that Harry thinks that he’s fallen asleep. And when he does speak again, it’s only a whisper, “Only if you invite me again.”
Sobs rack his body with renewed vigor. He scrabbles at Harry’s robes, clutches onto him with a vice-like grip.
"Yes, and it's quite rewarding, at least for me. I enjoy engaging with my audience - especially the regulars"
Supper passes uneventfully, and without much conversation. Longbottom tries valiantly to buoy his group’s mood and appetite, to no avail. Weasley still looks as though he’d swallowed a slug. Thomas and Finnigan are trying their best to pretend as though Draco doesn’t exist. And Harry. Harry is still staring - a little subtler than before, but staring nonetheless.
Draco looks intensely amused. "Why are you asking?" He takes another sip of wine as he pierces Harry with his intense stare. He's gotten really good at doing that since Hogwarts.
At this small morsel of information, the group of students burst into noise and activity again. They hurl question after question at Malfoy, and he patiently answers every single one as they walk through the corridors. When they turn a corner at the end of a corridor, Harry lets them go. It doesn't seem that he'll get a chance to talk to Malfoy alone - at least not tonight.
“It could have been either Neville or me - we both qualified. But Voldemort chose me. And from then on, everything about me revolved around him, and the War that was coming. Everything still does, really. I will never be free from it. I’ve never even known that freedom.”
Draco steps forward, careful to keep his movements slow and deliberate, and holds out his hand. “A pleasure.” They shake. Longbottom’s hand is cold and damp. “We can set out at any time, so let me know when you’re ready. Or if you have any other questions.”
"Really? That's really rare these days, I think. Humble talent? Such an unappreciated virtue, in my opinion."
“It was...hard. To listen to all of it.” A heavy pause. “Because it was so familiar. Bellatrix she-she-did all of that to me.”
- the cafe that he’d met Draco in what seems like ages ago, he spots Neville, who catches his eye but does not wave. Harry walks over and takes his seat.
Just that thought alone manages to send Harry into a fairly peaceful sleep that night, the first one he has in weeks.
Harry gets the feeling that maybe it would be unwise to go any further, especially with Malfoy as a former Death Eater
Draco doesn't wrinkle his nose in disgust like Harry half-expects him to at the mention of Hagrid; instead, he looks thoughtful. "I can understand that. Even if the Manor weren't seized, I think my mother and I would've gotten rid of it anyways. It was too big, even for three people. And not to mention the memories that lived there..." He trails off and takes another sip of wine from his glass.
The Muggle in lines are excited, but not as much as they were at the Christmas concert. The wind makes it hard for Harry to listen in, so he just watches their stony, serious faces as they talk to each other.
Cold chills sprint up and down Harry's body, making him shiver even though his covers are warm. Reluctantly, he gets out of bed and begins to get dressed, but his mind is still racing. The rising trend in neo-Death Eaters - all mostly young, white, wizards resentful of the continual intermixing of the Wizarding and Muggle communities and whites and nonwhites - has mostly meant more paperwork for Harry, but he had assumed that they would come to their senses eventually. The War hadn't happened that long ago, after all, and he thought that the Wizarding community wouldn't be willing to go down that road quite so soon. But the movement his rapidly barreling toward a fever pitch, and if Willows and his gang are really planning something serious...
Above, the gulls still call, always interrupting, always overlapping - until question and answer bleed into one.
It's either Hermione or Ron. Those are the only people in the world for whom his wards allow access.
It’s true; looming before them, utterly out of reach, was an impossibly tall jut of rock, scraping the sky. Draco has never reached the top before, he doesn’t even know how long it would truly take. But he never needs to, and he never should.
Draco waits, but Harry doesn’t say anything more. “Harry?” Draco says, gently taking Harry’s hand. Their fingers interlace, and Harry squeezes.
Hermione sighs in exasperation. “Harry-” she begins, but that’s when Ron strikes: winding his arms around her middle and hugging. She shrieks, but once she sees who it is, they both dissolve into laughter.
They're all laughing and smiling. Sophia joins the pile-on moments later and they scream and yell together.
They move the party into the sitting room and onto their objectively hideous floral print couch that Harry snagged from a Muggle yard sale half as a joke, and which Draco keeps around out of spite. And because it’s surprisingly comfortable.
“It’s alright, we know the way.” As she and Ron file out of the bathroom, she stops and turns back to look at him in the doorway. “Good night, Harry.”
If she recognizes the name at all, she doesn’t show it. Usually Muggles aren’t a problem, but Harry has encountered the occasional person who had vaguely heard of him and would be convinced that he was some lesser-known celebrity. “Nice to meet you. Friend of Draco’s?”
“This is where the staff lives. That is Amira’s cabin, that is Prasad and Walker’s, and this is mine.” Draco points to each one in turn. “Since Prasad and Walker share, and Amira shares with her wife, the dragon veterinarian who visits occasionally, you’ll be staying with me.”
“I agree. ‘s why I quit the Ministry.” Draco didn’t even know Harry had worked there to begin with. “Those white walls and windows that lead nowhere…” Harry shakes his head.
Spotty hoots sharply at Harry from the window. Upon noticing the small bit of parchment tied to her leg, Harry throws back his covers and practically sprints over.
Ava grins sympathetically at him. "Yep, sorry, but he's never mentioned any Harrys either. Sometimes he talks about his Mum, but that's only after either me or Belle ask after her. But she’s never come to his shows - not as far as I know."
"That's...so surprising. He never brings friends around here. In fact, I think you're the first that I've known about." She looks past Harry, into the crowd, and points at a woman across the room with black hair down to her waist and a smart blazer and slacks set on. She's chatting amiably with an old white couple. "That's Belle. She's the owner of the place. And we always joke that we're the only friends that he has, but I'm pretty happy that's not true." She chuckles at that and shakes her head while she wipes down the counter.
A sound, a growl, erupts from one of the adult dragon’s throats. A line of smoke begins trailing from its nostrils. The babies squeal and toddle over, their limbs still awkward, their infantile wings flapping unevenly. Once all five of them gather, the adults take each of them in their mouths by the scruff of their necks. They bow their heads to Draco, unfurl their wings, and take off in unison. The beat of their wings is so powerful that it sends the shell pieces and food pellets scattering, and Draco must press himself to the ground for fear of being blown away.
and begins her speech as everyone is settling back in their seats. “Wow. I...I have no words.” She lifts up the medal and looks down at it.
give you all a tour. Please, follow me. And have you met my girlfriend, Ava, the bartender?” And with that she leads most of them away, chatting amiably with Ginny and Luna in particular, but as Harry turns to follow them, a hand around his wrist stops him.
The rest of Draco's audience doesn't seem to be facing the same problems that Harry is. They clap, snap, stomp their feet, and even sing along to the pieces - their joyful faces illuminated by the spotlight, by the light reflecting off of Draco's sequined suit. Most of them know every single word by heart. They go especially wild when Draco plays jazzy renditions of what Harry vaguely knows are popular Muggle Christmas songs. But the small group of wizards and witches in the back just sit in silence, opting instead to watch and witness Muggle culture.
Malfoy takes it and stows it in the inner pocket of his coat without checking its contents. He is unblinking and unflinching in front of her. "Thank you for the opportunity."
"Harry!" She pulls him in for a hug. She smells just as she always does - like her shampoo, which is cinnamon-y, and like her perfume, which soaks her body in vanilla.
“All done!” Prasad chirps. “Just remember to try to keep your magic usage to a minimum - the dragons get a little antsy when they see it. And as you already know, Draco here will be your guide for the next seven days. All the safety measures are outlined on page three, but you shouldn’t worry with Draco. He’s very experienced.” They beam at him. Longbottom looks slightly ill.
