“Hi.” Hi, like he’s just visiting. Like he hasn’t been avoiding Draco for weeks now. Like he didn’t just wake up Draco from his sleep.
The kitchen is clean, which isn’t what Harry had been expecting. He knows he left half a sink of dishes, not to mention the dishes that Draco hadn’t got around to drying. There’d been their wine glasses too—but they’re nowhere to be seen.
The words seem to hang in the silence, and Draco chases them with a sip of his wine.
“No!” Harry says, emphatically and oh-so earnestly. “Draco…”
“What, did you get bored? Couldn’t find anything to help you pass the time?”
The Room had been there for him for years, since first year even, and Harry’s been able to rely on it’s help for so long, from the days of Dumbledore’s Army, to the time Ginny had hidden the Potions Book. All of which seem so long ago now.
The walk to Draco’s quarters seems harder than any of the late night walks he’s made these past few weeks. His stomach churns as he walks the unfamiliar route, but he forces himself on regardless, seizing the motivation while it lasts. He knocks before he can allow himself to second-guess it, rapping his knuckles against the door; not too light so that Draco can’t hear him but hopefully not so heavy that he wakes up Lily.
, which isn’t something Harry usually thinks about relationships. Crossing the line from friends to something more has never been something Harry’s done well.
Harry’s expecting it when Draco closes the distance, lips sealing against his own. For how long, he’s not sure. The last few moments, definitely. Since the incident with the wine glass, probably. But possibly since before then, maybe since he invited Draco to his house, maybe since they started going out to the pubs on Friday nights. He’s not even sure that fits really. It feels like longer and it’s probably wrong, but it feels like it’s been coming as long as he can remember, that he’s
"There are spells for that you know," Draco says, leaning against the kitchen bench.
"If i wanted to do that I could just start afresh. Or with something that is beyond repair. If I did that, it wouldn't be this item anymore would it?"
It’s not uncommon, for a wizard, especially those of poor blood to make a grand gesture upon finding their soulmate, a way of showing that they are worthy of the soulmark between them.
The dungeons still feel like home to him, and he feels safe, feels like he could close his eyes and navigate his way on memory alone, even after all this time. He keeps walking until he finds the narrow staircase he’s looking for, hands running across the wall as he takes the staircase, counting out the steps, until he reaches thirteen.
Draco strips his clothes, and Harry follows suit, his eyes raking over Draco as he does. It's not the first time he's seen Draco's body, but it's the first time like this, first time naked and unflinching. The first time he's allowed to look, properly, and Harry does.
Now, making food for people brings him happiness, the act of creating something and taking care of the people in his life both wrapped up together. Washing the dishes closes it out, and there’s something calming about the act of washing, drying, and putting everything away. The rest of his house is a bit of a mess, but his kitchen is clean, everything in its place, even if the places seem to be chosen by the house itself.
"Is there much to it?" Harry asks, genuinely curious. "Setting it all up?"
He drifts off like that, somewhere between the space of awake and asleep, but he feels more at peace than he can remember feeling lately.
Draco's gaze locks with Harry's, and there's something in his voice that cuts straight through him.
One of the first stories Draco remembers is that of pauper who matched with a princess. Her father, the king, had been unimpressed, but at his daughter's request he’d acquiesced, allowing them to marry, if only the pauper could prove himself worthy, by completing the tasks the king himself had set.
But Luna… somehow her recommendations always see him right, even if they seem a little odd sometimes.
“I never knew about soulmates,” Harry continues, “I didn’t — I didn’t realise it was a thing, that this was a possibility. Someone failed to mention that along the way. Like you think that would have been something to mention, like
“I’ll sit down,” Draco says, with a smile. He’s rocking side to side slowly, the slow movement that Lily loves. It’s like he’s dancing a slow dance with Lily, his arm around her and her little hand bunched up against his chest. Harry loves them so much. “I wanted to get some of the essays marked, so if you can get her to sleep I’d love you forever.”
have them. It’s happened before.
“How’ve you been?” Ginny asks, and Harry should have been expecting it really, but he’s not prepared for it. But they’ve always got into each other's business, Ginny and him. It’s no different now. Sometimes Ginny pushes when he needs to be pushed. It’s why they worked together for so long, until suddenly they didn’t anymore, just like him and Draco.
Harry looks up to see Draco leaning against the wall, holding a glass of wine. Wine seems to magically find its way into Draco’s hand in Grimmauld Place—just another perk of your ghost cousin being in charge of the house, Harry guesses.
"I've always enjoyed working with older things," Draco says, and he runs his fingers over a thigh-high piece of furniture, pushes against it, and the furniture moves, rotating slowly around. It's a bookshelf Harry notices now, watching as it rotates, showing off the spines of different books as it does so. Harry drags his attention back to Draco when he speaks again. "But I did go through a stage when I… wanted nothing to do with older magical items…" Draco trails off. "Some things shouldn't be repaired. I didn't always know that."
He’s considering leaving when the door does open, revealing a sleep-worn Draco, hair mussed up. He’s not in his pyjamas, though, and Harry knows without a doubt that it means Draco had fallen asleep on the couch.
It’s easy to fall into familiar routines, as exams approach again. There’s a panic to the atmosphere, as the fifth, seventh and eighth year students try and cram in as much studying as possible, and Draco is no exception. He’s determined to use every minute available to study. He needs to be his best, needs to show them all that he’s more than just a Death Eater. It’ll take more than a few outstandings for him to get a job after graduation, but it’s a good start.
Draco’s already shedding his sleep shirt, unbuttoning and placing it in the laundry basket. He lies face down, and Harry takes a moment to appreciate Draco, laid out on the bed before him. Draco’s a treat to take in, and Harry’s not been allowed to look in so long. He wants to fall over Draco and place kisses over his body, starting on his lower back just above his pyjamas, and kiss his way up Draco’s body till he gets to Draco’s ear. He wants to mouth at his lobe and then turn him over, snog him breathless and make his way back down Draco’s front, and then get his mouth all over Draco’s cock.
This doesn't feel like that.
He throws his wand behind him—bad form that, Robards would pitch a fit—and Draco’s hands are back on him, one finding his shoulder, the other coming to his hip. He tugs Harry in until their bodies connect, and it’s like a Warming Charm where they touch and Harry bites back a moan, bringing his own hands to Draco’s hips.
. He’s close enough to feel like he’s watching through a looking glass, seeing every movement crystal clear, as Draco takes a sip of the wine. He can see Draco swirling it, see the way it pushes out his cheeks, his lips wine red, and Harry wants to touch them, wants to press his thumb against Draco’s lips and see what he does.
"I don’t think I have been," Regulus says. He looks younger when his face pulls in confusion. He was only a teenager when he died, Harry remembers, another casualty of the war. "I wasn’t here. And then I was. I guess the house needed me. All I know is I woke up, the house was empty, and I didnt need to open any doors to get through them." Regulus shrugs, the action strange on his shoulders. "It was just Kreacher and I for a while, and then this one moved into the house."
"New enough." He's been on two failed dates, had one shit kiss, and had Dean offer to show him what it's really like to kiss a bloke—which he declined, even if he'd been a little tempted. He doesn't particularly feel like sharing any of that though. But he knows it's… That some people might take issue with that. "Is that a problem?"
Draco wakes to the feeling of someone in the bed behind him. There’s a press of lips against his neck, warm and gentle, and it only takes a moment before Draco is melting into it, moaning into the pillow. He takes a moment to appreciate it, the way Harry’s body is laying on top of his, almost pinning him to the mattress. One of Harry’s arms is wrapped around him, hand gripping his hip and fingers rubbing small circles against his skin. Draco can feel Harry’s hardness against him, rocking against his arse in movements that aren’t subtle at all, and he can feel Harry’s cockhead leaking against his back. He was already half hard when he woke, and his cock is fattening up beneath him, almost painful where it’s trapped against the sheets. Draco wants to move, wants to get his hand on Harry and wank him off again, wants Harry’s fingers on him, or maybe in him, and
It isn’t, and it’s not what Draco had been asking, not really, not at all. It defeats the purpose of
he feels like saying. When has he ever really had a home that was
at his own finger.
He misses Pansy, the feeling coming on suddenly, and almost overwhelming in its intensity. He feels  angry at her for not being here when he needs her. It’s not a new feeling, something that comes and goes, but rarely this strongly. On his better days, he knows why she’s not here, why she couldn’t face up to these castle walls, but he still misses her, some days more than others and today more than all before.
“Yes,” Draco breathes out, and if his voice sounds a little weak Draco hopes Harry puts it down to the arousal thrumming in his veins. “Yes. Are you? Do you want this?” Draco needs to know, needs to be sure.
Harry jerks in Draco’s arms, all comfort gone with the words. It must be so obvious, but Draco doesn’t loosen his arms. His thumb is back, rubbing a pattern against his hip. It’s still comforting, even as Harry’s body feels like it’s thrumming from the tension.
Harry understands the sentiment.
"Harry, if I start giving you sympathy now, it’ll never stop. I just don’t have the energy to keep up with all your injuries."
, Kreacher disappears too.
Harry feels his face flush and hopes it won't be too obvious under the dim lights of the bar. "It's new," he acknowledges.
Regulus turns to Draco, taking him in, and Harry resists the urge to step in front of Draco, to shield him from the ghost. Not that it would do any good.
now?" Harry asks, looking around. The shop is still as empty as it was when Harry came in. Just Draco, and Miss Black sitting behind him. It doesn't seem like the busiest of shops, but Harry can't imagine that means Draco can just leave off whenever he wants. "Can you just do that? What if someone comes by? Won't you get in trouble?"
to do, and it's important to me that you know that Harry. Tell me you know that."
Draco presses in closer, and Harry presses back, gasping into Draco's mouth, and then, when Draco breaks the kiss, into his shoulder. Harry's head is spinning, the want and need twisting up inside him. He wants Draco, needs Draco, and he takes, pressing their bodies tight together and giving back every thrust that he's given.
It’s the tone of his voice which almost makes him break, that makes him want to give in, to talk to Harry until he understands. He wants to tell Harry all the reasons why he can’t have this, why he’s not allowed. Maybe Harry would understand. There are so many reasons why this is a terrible idea, too many for Draco to even consider, especially when he’s been doing his best
"Draco." Harry gives him a shake, and Draco makes a small noise of protest, the sound smothered slightly into his chest.
When Harry looks down he can see the blood on Draco's hands, seeping red into Harry's shirt where he's grabbed him. There’s a bloody tea towel on the floor and past it Harry can see shards of glass—one of the water glasses Harry had washed only moments before. His stomach swoops, the relief turning in his stomach. He feels a little sick, and a lot stupid, and mostly just fucking
"Yeah," Harry agrees, the words tumbling out.
?" Draco asks, and Harry freezes, hand stuck almost to his pocket, but it's not him Draco's talking to.
but it’s
to think about it.
Draco groans again as she lets out a particularly piercing wail. She’s really getting into it now, and it’s been an age since Lily used to cry like that. But Harry remembers how it goes. Her eyes will be all scrunched up, and she’ll have tears soon if they don’t put a stop to it.
Maybe this is something inside of him, maybe it's a result of being the Chosen One. It's hard to find a relationship when you're wondering why, why,
, and if Harry hasn't at least checked it out by dinner next Wednesday, Luna will know.
Your soulmate is often, but not always, the person you end up with. They’re often romantic, but not always. There’s no discernable pattern to when you soulmark will turn up. Sometimes someone you've just met, sometimes someone new. There's no perceivable way to understand where a soulmark will turn up. They often turn up after intimacy.
"I’m sorry," Draco says, "I don’t remember you."
He is also definitely going to fall asleep if Draco keeps doing that.
“Potter,” Draco groans again, and he can’t take it anymore, needs to get a hand on himself, to touch his cock, needs to touch Harry back, and he moves, too quick really, almost pitching straight into Harry, and saved only by Harry’s bloody
Harry's heart is still racing, the adrenaline still pumping in his veins even if it's not needed. His head is rushing still, thoughts racing, like
The only problem is it never lasts.
“What do I require?”
“I’m not saying you have to marry me Draco,” Harry says, “This doesn’t have to mean forever, but just, would you be willing to give it a try?”
It is comfortable, Harry can admit that, but he really couldn't care less about the sofa when Draco is standing in front of him. His hands had flown up when he'd fallen to sit, grabbing for something to hold onto, and they found their way to Draco's hips, feeling the soft material against his hands and
that if he were to say any of it Draco would run, maybe not forever, but he would, and there’s nothing Harry wants to do to scare Draco away. The feelings are his own, and he channels them instead into his kiss, to say with his lips what he can’t say with his voice. It must work in some way, because Draco quickly gets back on board. It’s a fumble then, a rush of fingers, Harry and Draco’s. Harry gets Draco’s trousers undone, pushing them down enough that he can get his hands on the skin of Draco’s arse. It’s so much hotter skin on skin, and Draco seems to think the same, fingers shoving at Harry's waistband, tugging until they get stuck between his body and the sofa cushions.
They start to pick up the pace and Harry has to bury his head against Draco's neck to breathe hot and wet against the skin there. He presses open-mouthed kisses against Draco's skin as the rhythm and pressure builds between them. Harry can feel the way Draco's breathing heavily too, and Harry's shaking hard enough that he can't tell if it's just him or the both of them. His breathing and thrusts are growing fast, erratic, and when Draco's thighs clench tighter around his cock, Harry groans, biting down against the skin, as he comes between Draco's thighs, slicking him up further and then thrusting more, making a mess of Draco, too.
Draco huffs a laugh, walks back to his chair and sits again, folding his legs and dangling his wine glass from his fingertips. "I think I’ve done enough today. It’s my turn to watch you now."
It’s almost overwhelming, the way Harry paws at him, hands shoving up Draco’s shirt, so rough on the material in ways that sends alarm bells ringing in Draco’s head, but he can’t even think of saying anything, when it means Harry’s hands are finally on him. Harry’s fingers trace up as he moves the shirt, one hand holding Draco’s hip firmly as the other starts moving up, tracing Draco’s stomach, fingers just skirting his belly button, before drifting out to his ribs, feeling the bumps and dips as he traces his way up, feeling the way Draco’s breath hitches, at that, and when Harry flicks a thumb over Draco’s nipple and his breath catches on a sharp inhale.
Draco. But Draco doesn’t want him back. “Draco doesn’t want me anymore.”
"I’m surprised you recognised me."
His fingers still on his flies, but when Harry reaches for them Draco slaps his hands away, reignited by the touch, and he makes short work of them, throwing them across the room to wherever the fuck that Draco does not care about. This time when Harry reaches out, Draco lets him, hands coming up to his hips, and pulling Draco back in, down to the bed with him and kissing him again, lips warm and sort and a little wet from the kissing. Kissing Harry feels like sitting too close to the fireplace on a cold night, all delight with just the hint of too much, and Draco can’t get enough, wants to keep kissing him all night.
He suspects the glare might be lacking, considering the thumping in his chest and his groin, and the fact that Harry is still grinning down at him.
Harry thinks of the hallway and the tapestry which once hung there that now rests in the basement along with that fucking portrait. He wonders if he’d be able to find the names and trace the path of the house. He grimaces at the thought—he’s not sure that’s something he wants, even if he could.
Draco’s breath is starting to stutter, hips jerking, and Harry doesn’t let it ease up, even as their hands bump into his stomach. Draco’s torso is right in front of him, so he drops his head, finding the skin next to his nipple and kissing it at first, and then taking the skin between his teeth to bite down.
Harry sighs, deep, leaning his head back and looking to the ceiling, as he inhales deep enough for it to be audible. “Please, Draco, I just want to talk.”
He wants it more than he cares to admit.
Harry wipes his hand off on the sheet before wrapping his arm around Draco, pulling him in close regardless of the mess.
“Since you’re being a lazy sod today,” Draco grumbles, “can you take care of her while I run to the loo?”
policy when it comes to damaged magical items, which Harry's never examined much before, happy enough to leave it to someone else. He shakes his head, and Draco continues. "
Draco traces his fingers along his ribs, imagines he can feel the words beneath them, as he says, “Yes.”
, and Harry watches as the glass puts itself back together in front of them both, setting itself gently down on the table next to the sink.
There’s blood, more than he would have expected, but he knows from experience that hands always bleed a lot. It takes a moment to locate the wound, rolling Draco’s hand in his own as he looks it over. He finds it on the side of Draco’s hand, just below the junction of his pinky finger. It’s not a large cut, but it looks like it might be deep and it’s still bleeding.
Draco nods, but he doesn't make a move, and when it's obvious he won't, Harry steps up to him.
“Of course I came,” Draco says, like there was any chance of Draco missing this. Harry doesn’t need to know Draco only decided to come today, and only when he’d gone back to the study room, taken a look around, and suddenly felt startlingly aware he’d be leaving all of this behind, when he hopped on the train back to London.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s, holding him tight and leaning back into it, relishing the feeling of Draco’s body against his.
Draco nods.
"Alright," Harry says, taking a step back from the bench, but then hesitates, waiting for Draco to guide his next movement.
Lets the fantasy play out before his eyelids, before letting it go on his next exhale.
"It has," Harry agrees.
"No," Harry admits. The information Hermione gave him had been limited. It had been a haphazard amalgamation of information, sourced from books, newspaper articles, and even one Harry swore was a
"Oh."
"You can usually trace the lineage of the masters of the house back like a family tree as it passes from person to person." Draco seems to consider his own words. "Although master probably isn't the right word. It's more of a pairing. A mutual relationship. You give a bit of yourself and the house uses your magic."
There might have also been—he might have thought—
"Oh." Draco seems shaken by the words, and there’s a hint of red on his cheeks. "Thank you. I think she’d be pleased to know you’re back. She always spoke well of you."
Harry throws down the report he’s been trying to read, taking the cup from the coaster—his own face looks up at him. It’s a little obscured from tea rings, but the persistently awkward smile still looks up at him. It’s not even his smile; the image isn't a photo but a replication. Not even a good one. Draco had come in crowing about the coaster one morning, and Harry’s not been able to get rid of it since. There’s a variety of them it seems, and sometimes he comes in on a Monday morning to a different image looking up at him, another face that looks not-quite-right but close enough to be eerie. This week's coaster is a picture of him from after the war, the ostentatious Order of Merlin medal around his neck, against the backdrop of Hogwarts. The coaster rendition of Harry seems to display pride at the medal, occasionally displaying it off for the viewer to see. Harry’s
It’s Harry’s turn to glare, trying to put into a look the thought of
It takes a bit of shuffling around, Draco manoeuvring Harry's body to get him into place. It's the fumble that comes with a new bedfellow, and it could be awkward but there's none of that between them. Draco reaches his hand behind him to pull Harry in tighter, opens up his legs, and when Harry's cock slides between them, Draco locks his thighs together around it.
"This isn't what I would have expected your flat to look like," Harry says honestly, holding his own glass in his hands. He reaches out, tracing a finger over the table. It's old too, and there's a thrum present that speaks of a magic inside it, though for what purpose Harry can't tell.
“What?” Harry asks, the confusion in his voice, Draco can’t tear his eyes away from the marks, can’t look to see the confusion he can see there, because he knows that writing, knows the curl and angle of the H and the way the letters run into each other —
“Couldn’t think of anything better,” Harry says, and he means it. Draco laughs and presses another kiss to Harry’s lips, and really, there’s no other time or place he’d rather be in.
That face is haunting him the night he decides to try again. It’s been a tense day, family dinner with Hermione and Ron. He loves them both — loves Rose and Hugo just as much — but sometimes it’s too much. He doesn’t resent them their happiness, but it’s hard looking at the two of them so happy. It hurts to see his friends still so happy with everything Harry wants. He’s got one divorce in the bag and is separated from his husband, but Hermione and Ron have been a constant the whole time. They bicker and fight, fights which seem like they’re so big Harry can’t even fathom it, and Ron’s come round to his to sleep on the couch before. But at the end of the day they always work through it, and it’s just a little too painful at the moment. Like looking into the sun, it leaves Harry blinking his eyes and trying to keep himself under control.
"Sorry, it's just." Draco runs his hand through his hair, pulling it back from his eyes. It falls straight back over them, and Draco looks at Harry through the strands of hair. "Sensitive subject I guess. I left the Aurors for me, not any other reason. The distinction is important. Important to me."
Draco groans, hands pressing harder against Harry's hips. Harry moans, presses his body in even closer. He brings one hand up to Draco’s neck, the other snaking around to Draco’s back, keeping their bodies pressed tight together.
“Do you ever think about getting away?” The words tumble out of his mouth before he has time to stop them.
doesn’t do anything to help with the tightness in his pants.
"No," Draco responds, without looking up from his work, hands still working. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Harry takes a step further, trying to look at what Draco has in front of him—a machine of some sort. Harry can't tell any further, and why did he even think he'd be able to tell in the first place? "I'd invite anyone to try and make their way out of the shop without paying what they owe. It would make my afternoon."
. He presses down on the skin almost accidentally, and Draco releases a hiss of pain, startling Harry into looking up at him, hand still clasped between them.
"Words
That's fair. Harry had felt the great divide at the end there. It had been like a gaping chasm between them, and every time Harry looked at Ginny, it had hurt so much. It felt like someone was reaching through his ribs to grip and squeeze his heart. A bit like it does now.
Sometimes that feels even worse.
before, but not
The first thing Harry registers when he wakes is the warmth of someone in his arms.
Which is when his eyes slip down, to three words marked into Harry’s chest.
He doesn’t know when Harry started reciprocating it.
"So tomorrow," Draco says. "At Grimmauld Place."
Draco breaks the kiss with a gasp, a sharp intake of breath, and he half curls his body into Harry, dropping his head to rest on Harry's shoulder. It pushes his groin away enough that Harry can shove his hand down further, fingers making a terrible attempt at stroking Draco's cock. His arm feels awkward and in the way, but fuck if it isn't one of the hottest things Harry's done.
Harry's thrusts slow, and Draco releases some of the pressure on his thighs. Harry rests his forehead against Draco's shoulders as he tries to get his breath back under control. It's only when fingers brush against the hand still on Draco's cock that Harry remembers his hands exist—and that Draco's still hard in his.
worthy.
all mixed up together, and Harry inhales, breathing it in like his first breath of air after swimming in the Great Lake. He can already feel that he’s alone in the bed, but Harry reaches out anyway, fingers finding Draco’s pillow and pulling it to him. It’s not Draco, but he wraps his arms around it anyway, cuddling it to his chest and burying his head into it. It’s a poor substitution for Draco, really, but for Harry it’s so much more than he’d usually have, and he hangs onto it like the lifeline it feels like.
Harry leans back again, taking in the shop and another look up and down the street.
Draco shrugs. "I don’t think it’s worth worrying about now. If it was going to happen it would have by now."
are these people talking to me, and maybe he let that get to him a little, and maybe he let the desire for a relationship slip away. He was just as happy living with Ron and Hermione, and maybe he would have been fine staying there forever, the third wheel to their relationship.
Harry's had sex, sex with women anyway. There was Ginny, and after that a few relationships, but nothing that turned serious. Harry's never really done the casual thing before, always felt like he couldn't imagine just going home with someone
?" Harry asks—even Harry knows how to cast a passable
He slides his legs over Draco’s sitting on his thighs and careful to keep his hard on from bumping against Draco’s arse. He squirts some of the oil onto his hands, making sure the lid is on before placing it aside on the bed. He rubs his hands together to warm the oil up and pushes the heels of his heated and slicked up hands onto Draco’s lower back. Harry applies pressure and then pushes upward firmly in a long stroke until he reaches Draco’s shoulders then pushes outwards. His hands run horizontally along the muscle of Draco’s shoulders before he lifts off.
. Draco rights himself again, still feeling the echo of Harry’s fingers where they’d dug in tight, and almost as if Harry can tell it he squeezes again, digging in, and Draco half hopes there’ll be bruises in the morning, a sign of all they’ve shared tonight.
"Well, it’s my house and I’m not leaving. I don’t want to." Regulus glares at Harry, crossing his arms. Harry thinks he might float up a few inches too. "You can’t make me leave."
Draco knows what it was like then, has an understanding that can only come from being stuck right in the middle of it, even if he was on the other side.
Draco nods, but doesn't answer, instead picking up the wine bottle and pouring them fresh glasses, hand wrapped effortlessly around the wine glass like he was born to do so, and that's probably true. Draco Malfoy, learning his way around a wine bottle before he could probably walk. There's not a drip on the glass, but Draco slides the cloth along the rim of the bottle anyway before placing it back on the table. Draco holds the one glass like he's supporting something precious, delicately, and Harry lifts his own, feeling awkward and clumsy and
Here, looking down at Harry, Draco feels worried for a moment, that maybe this isn’t real. These sort of things don’t happen to him, not really. People say good things come in threes but for Draco that’s never been the case, good things
He could stay here all day. Or the whole dream, however long it lasts. He’s not planning on moving, not ever, if he has his way.
and his mind is very much alert.
Draco's breathing as hard as Harry, lips red and swollen, hair a mess from Harry’s hands in it. Harry uses that hold, threading his fingers into the strands to pull Draco up and onto his lap to kiss him.
"Of course we did,” Ginny agrees. “But like, not about the big things. We’d talk about all these little things and how we wanted to be better parents than we’d had and how our days were, and we talked about so many things but never about the big things. I knew more about what you went through and how you were feeling from Ron and Hermione. And I think a part of that was that you didn't want to talk about it. And I think maybe a part of you didn't want to burden me, but I just never felt like you were letting me in. And eventually I realised that you weren't going to let me in. Even when we had issues, you never wanted to talk about them. And I think part of you is afraid to talk about these things, and I think part of you is afraid to let people in. And I get that Harry; you've lost so much. But if you don't let people in, you're just going to end up alone."
"So what made you stop?"
Draco blinks, like he’s still trying to wake up, and Harry resists the urge to step forward and hug him.
which could mean anything. The door is ornate, a wooden frame and glass with some sort of metal weaving across it. The door looks older than the rest of the shop, and stands out from the rest of the buildings in the way it's
, he thinks, then remembers that there’s a significant chance it’ll all be coming to an end soon. Harry cuts the thought off, shoves it into a bag and then underneath his bed like all his old books and parchments from Hogwarts that he still can’t bring himself to throw out.
underneath that.
"You keep telling yourself that Malfoy," Harry says, playing the same old part once again. He’s glad they can have this now, the easy banter may have been years in the making, but it’s part of why Harry enjoys their partnership so much. It’s surprisingly easy to get along with Draco these days, and Harry can appreciate Draco’s quick banter, far better than the sharp tongue he used to wield. It’s a far cry from the antagonistic relationship they once had. Nemesis. Harry had thought of Draco as his

It makes his stomach churn, the weird mix of anger, jealousy, and the hot burn of shame at himself for feeling it at all.

He brings a hand up to Harry’s chest, to where he knows the mark lies beneath, and Draco lets it rest there a moment, imagining he can feel the words beneath his palm, because Draco has always had a masochistic streak at heart. It’s only a moment, and then Draco is pushing Harry away gently.
He’s doesn’t remember when the line blurred. Doesn’t know when his hatred for Harry developed into a reluctant acknowledgement that he found Harry attractive, or when that turned into a full-fledged crush.
It’s a production of sorts—or maybe a torture designed especially for Harry. Draco swirls the glass first, the liquid moving almost hypnotically around in the glass a few times. Draco brings the wine glass to his lips, smells it first, and then takes a noisy sip of it. Or maybe it’s just loud to Harry, but he can swear he hears the sound of Draco taking a drink. Draco doesn’t swallow the wine, shifting it around in his mouth for a moment, lips already carrying a hint of red from the wine, and Harry’s body runs hot at the sight of it. He abandons all pretence of not watching, turning his attention to Draco fully. He sees when Draco swallows, the movement of his throat and the bob of his Adam’s apple, and
Harry can feel the heat in his cheeks.
“Because I talk to him,
“There’s nothing going on with Draco.” The feeling inside his chest is back, both at the lie and the truth of it. He’s seeing another Draco. There’s nothing going on with his Draco, the Draco he wants more than anything. He wants his
Now that he knows, it should be easier. Draco doesn’t hate him. Ginny says he still
It’s the smell that he recognises first. He rolls over when he wakes, turning on his pillow. There’s still that smell that’s so
"Right." Harry lets his eyes fall shut, lets himself lean against Draco, relaxing into the press of his hands and the feel of his body. He could get used to this.
"But you don’t drink it often do you?" Draco asks, there’s still a touch of amusement in his voice, and there are definitely tears in his eyes. Harry can’t find it in himself to mind.
"Ah." Draco nods. "Luna."
As if summoned, there's a weight on his leg, stepping on and then walking over him, and then she's sliding between the two of them, pressing Draco's body away from him as he feels her turn in circles, and then lie down.
"You’ll have to forgive him," Draco says. "He wasn’t aware of the requirements of maintaining a house such as this. He didn’t realise the consequences of leaving it empty."
Harry hums noncommittally, leaning against the wall beside Draco. Draco feels more crowded than he had been when he was in the middle of it all getting the drink in his hands, a rising heat beneath his clothes. He rearranges his feet, leaning away from Harry, just to put some more space between them, and pretends not to notice when Harry’s eyebrows furrow, instead casting his gaze over the room and it’s occupants.
"It’s not Dark Magic," Draco says firmly, and he sounds a little defensive. "Not everything you don’t understand is Dark Magic. Not all magic uses spells or potions. Some magic runs deeper, houses just happen to be one of them. Divination does too."
Harry is so close he can feel the puffs of Draco’s breath against him. He’s still holding Draco’s hand in his own, still looking at it, watching as the blood still leaches from Draco’s hand, but he can barely focus on it for the feel of Draco. It feels like he’s hyper aware of everything Draco, from the sound of his breathing, to the feel of his hand beneath him. He should be doing something, should be practising the wound care he’s had drilled into him since the day he started, but he can hardly think, can’t even remember the first step, when it’s like his brain is chanting Draco, Draco,
Harry nods.
To making a home—to having Draco be a part of it.
She starts to fall asleep before she’s even finished the bottle, and Harry places it on the kitchen bench as he rocks her gently, murmuring sweet nothings to her. When he’s sure she’s completely out, he places her back in her crib, pulling the sheet up over her.
"And Harry doesn’t know the first thing about taking care of a house like this—if Grimmauld was left to him it probably would end up rotting."
He wants that.
There are marks they still bear, some more literal than others.
Harry doesn't know.
, the thing that tore their marriage apart and almost took their relationship with it. Instead, he watches the boys as they play. James is making a castle in the sand from a bucket, and Albus has his own castle, covered in bits of leaves and branches and all the things they’ll have to clear out of the sandpit later. It’s fine, though; he’s having fun, and that’s what matters.
For all that his nightly visits to the other Draco have been helping him, they’re not helping in this way. Seeing his Draco still hurts. Every night sitting at the head table hurts, feels like a torture room built just for him. Harry knows he makes it worse. It’s like a bruise, and Harry can’t stop poking his thumb at it until it hurts even more, watching Draco whenever he’s not looking, when Draco’s talking to the other professors, or a student. If Draco’s hurting as much as Harry, he doesn’t show it. And that hurts even more, but there’s nothing that could make Harry look away.
"It's about time really," Draco laughs again and walks over to hand a glass of water to Harry, sipping on his own.
His other hand wraps around Draco pulling him in tight and pressing their bodies together. Harry groans, thrusts up, the wetness on his cock slipping against the line of Draco's stomach. Harry wants to see it, wants to see his cock sliding against the pale skin there, leaving a sticky line against Draco's skin and in the fine hair he knows grows there. But he can't stop kissing Draco either, kissing him like Draco holds the oxygen he needs to breathe, and it's only a few graceless ruts before Harry's coming, feels his cock spurt straight onto the skin there.
Beside him, Draco slides his paperwork from off his lap, and wraps his arms around Harry, dropping his bony chin onto Harry’s shoulder, and then smothering a yawn into his shoulder.
He doesn’t want to be in this bed, this room that is like the one they shared in so many ways but not quite the same. He throws the sheets and grabs his dressing gown, not even bothering to put it on before he leaves, making his way back to his own rooms.
Draco pulls back, captures Harry’s lips in a kiss that
He scrambles backwards, falling back against the mattress, rushing to get away from Harry in a mad rush of uncoordinated limbs. He definitely kicks Harry in the process, feels muscle beneath his foot before he gets caught in the sheets, falling to the floor and taking half the bedding with him, and any remaining air forced out of his lungs in a rush.
“Do you want help with that?” Harry asks, as his fingers trace along the elastic.
“I talk about everything in my therapy. The other day I talked about how we should be able to say ‘I’ve been sadly’ as easily as we say ‘I’ve been poorly’.”
"I think I’m ready to go back to sleep," Harry says, and as if summoned, a yawn escapes him. "What about you?"
The touch can only be Draco, and he’ll know what to do, Harry can always rely on Draco on the field. Harry turns, lifting his hands out of the soapy water and making a fucking
"So," Draco says, casting a pointed glance around the room before returning his gaze to Harry. "What’s wrong with your house, Potter?"
It’s almost comical how much he wants this, how much the want ignites a fire inside of him. The want has been inside him for so long but Harry’s been pressing it down, and now he’s acknowledged it, it’s like opening the floodgates.
"Master, was it?" Draco asks, stepping out from beside Harry. He walks over to the bench where his wand was left last night. He leans against it and casually picks up his wand. "The Master of the house? And he asked you to clean up?"
Kreacher nods.
He brushes his fingers against the door frame once, allows himself to feel the familiar stone beneath his fingers, before he moves on, walking straight past the entrance, and further into the dungeons.
And this — this is surely a recipe for disaster.
“You’re busy,” Harry supplies, voice sad. Draco doesn’t look up. He can’t, even if he can’t read the words in front of him.
"What the fuck Harry?" Draco exclaims, hands relaxing but not releasing their hold.
get in if he wanted, he's not sure he's welcome here anymore.
Then Draco stalked back inside, kicked off his shoes, and threw himself onto the sofa quite dramatically.

"Your core still looks the same," Regulus says. "Besides, you look just like Narcissa. I don’t think you could be anyone but her son."
but he just… doesn't.
Harry’s head is spinning when Draco pulls away. Draco straightens up, rolls his back, and then drops to his knees right in front of the sofa.
Draco gives him a reprieve, moving to grab his own glass, and Harry takes the moment to take a sip from his own. He barely remembers more than
, but Harry’s never said the words, and Draco was never going to ask. “And I thought maybe we could be something more, even before all of
It’s a little scary, just how much Draco wants, wants this. Draco drowns the voices in his head out with a roll of his hips, pressing his erection into Harry. Harry spreads his legs wider to allow Draco to move closer, pressing their hard cocks together. It feels amazing, the hard pressure, and Draco finally breaks the kiss, gasping loudly against Harry’s lips.
The door is already there, and he doesn't remember that part either. There's a part of him that thinks he shouldn't. He should resist the pull of this, leave the memory intact if that's all it ever was.
The moment stretches out, balancing precariously like a Knut on its edge, and Harry’s sure it will go tumbling over any moment.
“Never,” Harry says, and then, “it’s been so long.”
The dragon is what draws most of Harry's attention though. He’s seen it before, but less often than the others. When Harry’s seen it before it’s usually partially obscured, the dragon’s head poking out from beneath Draco’s layers. It starts just below his ribs, spreading down over his hip and ending on his thigh, with flowers clutched tightly in its claws. Harry’s not sure of the breed, he's not even sure if it is an actual breed of dragon, or an amalgamation. Charlie would be able to tell him probably, but it’s not like he can ask
He’s too close, leaning his back against the kitchen bench, and Harry would barely have to reach out to close the distance. His body feels too hot, and he wants to take a step back but feels like that would give himself away.
The garden was the last thing they looked at, Draco pushing aside the leaves and branches as he made his way down the overgrown path, and Harry hadn’t missed the pointed huff at the state of it, and had only just missed the branch of the crabapple tree released in his direction.
"Fancy seeing you here," Harry says, for lack of anything better to say. Harry Potter, going on thirty and still doesn't know how to start a conversation. Maybe he should go to the seminar
to get used to this.
come to him, or when they do they come with their own consequences, like a Djinn's wish come back around; like the time he got onto the Quidditch team only to crash his broom, and the way his father had looked at him when he said he couldn’t believe he’d been such a

trying to stand out; no 'open' or 'come in' sign. Harry leans in to look through the glass, and it seems clear from a distance, but when he gets close there's something obscuring his view, a slight fuzziness like a thick fog made firm, a hint of a spell at the root of the obscurity.
Harry swallows him down, and Draco holds onto him until he finishes off, hands finally releasing Harry’s hair from their grip and falling back to his sides. Harry lets his softening cock fall from his lips.
He doesn’t think he’ll fall asleep, but it’s moments before Harry feels sleep taking over his body.
Every soulmark is different, means different things.  There are people who find their mark in a relationship and living out their days happily, but there are  other stories about people being missmarked, horror stories often. There are even some people who find a soulmark and never know who was responsible. Not all words are unique, not all words make sense.
The furniture in here is as old as downstairs. It's all one big floor, a kitchen, a table and chairs across from it. On the other half of the room are sofas, facing a fireplace bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, full to the brim, and Hermione would just love to see those. There's a lone table in the middle of the room, almost covered in opened books and paper, and Harry moves closer, intrigued.
There's a pressure against the bed, and Harry tenses, ready to jump into action, but Draco's arm tightens over his chest, and he whispers, right into his ear, "It's just Miss Black."
Draco Malfoy.
“Take a photograph why don’t you, Potter?”
the Dursleys might start to think of him as family. Maybe then Vernon would stop glaring at him and instead tell him he did a good job, maybe Petunia would ruffle his hair and place a kiss on his head like she did Dudley, and maybe Dudley might invite him along for kickabout with his friends.
“I’ve missed you, too.” Draco’s arms are wrapped around him tighter than any hug Harry’s had recently. Harry can understand that, feels like he never wants to let go again.
Harry tries to put all of his feelings into that kiss. It’s too early for the emotions he’s feeling, and he knows,
"No, this is a Rolling Stone Vintage. It’s very good, but it’s been a long time since I had any."
“Did you think about this?” Draco asks, rolling his hips into Harry’s, watching Harry’s eyes as they slip shut, Harry’s moan echoing his Draco’s.
Draco laughs, the noise loud and genuine and ringing through the kitchen.
Harry finds himself standing in front of the door to the Room of Requirement with no memory of having walked there nor having walked past the door the required three times, either.
“We’re friends too, you know,” Harry says, like it’s obvious, like Draco should have realised it, and maybe he should have, maybe he’d hoped they were something more than
Kreacher nods again, disappearing in front of their eyes with a small pop.
Of all the magical beings that exist, the only ones that have soulmates — or soul
Draco’s not quiet, groaning out, and little hitches of breath escape. Harry can tell when he’s found a particularly tender spot when Draco sucks in a breath and tenses up; Harry digs his fingers in, massaging at the knot of muscles until Draco relaxes again, groaning out and going loose beneath him.
"Lie back," Draco says, pressing against Harry's chest.
As a child it’s in every story you’re told, promises of meeting your soulmate and your whole life falling into place. As if there was nothing more important to look forward too, not when you had your other half waiting for you.
Draco pulls back, enough to look at him "Yeah?" he asks, "Do you want to?"
"No," Harry says, "I’ve had wine before." He doesn’t add that he’s only had it once, at a dinner hosted by Bill and Fleur. Fleur had poured him a glass. He hadn’t enjoyed it then either.
"Umm." Harry's only plans involve a freezer dahl, a beer from his fridge and eating dinner at the table with his dying ficus. The usual for his Saturday night, not that Harry wants to admit that. "Sure. Why not?"
Draco seems to appreciate the pasta at least. Harry doesn't think he tastes it, too focused on Draco, like every sense has been tuned in to the sounds of Draco eating, the little moans of appreciation that send chills through Harry's body. He watches as Draco manages to eat the pasta without leaving traces of sauce all over his face as Harry knows he does himself. He has to wipe it away with the frog napkins that Molly bought him as a housewarming gift—he's still not sure what the meaning is behind the frog motif, but he appreciates the napkins all the same. Harry even thinks he can smell Draco; Harry watched Draco work up a sweat today as they investigated the house, so maybe Harry actually
"It is," Draco says, taking the menu, and their conversation halts as someone comes past with a bottle of wine sliding it to Draco with a "Thought I'd get you started with your usual". There's an obvious camaraderie there, as Draco exchanges words with the person, and Harry distracts himself by looking at the table, not wanting to feel like he's eavesdropping on the conversation. There's a glass with a little candle in the middle, still unlit, and it's that which Harry turns his attention to until there's a glass placed in front of him, and Harry looks up to see Draco pouring the wine into it. "The Muggle and wizarding areas are located close enough that it's a simple thing to manage," Draco continues as if there had been no interruption, "and there's enough traffic on either side to make it worthwhile. The wizarding neighbourhood was dying off just a few years ago, and now it's coming back to life."
"I never wanted to be an Auror," Draco says, and it takes Harry a moment to remember the question he'd asked. "I did it because people didn't think I could, or thought I should disappear after the war. It felt like a way to make amends, and to show them all up at the same time. Then I stayed because Mother was so happy to see me making something of myself and rehabilitating the Malfoy name—her thoughts, not mine," Draco adds.
“Draco―”
His stomach turns at the thought.
"We couldn’t have that now could we?" Draco says, with a laugh.
only. I’m there to help you sort out your shit. Just like usual. Where would you be without me to manage you?"
There’s a truth in that, but it’s something more. Harry’s never been much for bodies. It’s the person in front of him, and yes Draco’s body is attractive, the
Harry’s fingers are just trying to make their way underneath Draco’s waistband when Draco shoves up his shirt, pulling his arms up to strip it off him. Harry gets up to speed quickly, reaching for Draco’s shirt buttons, fumbling with the first few, before giving a frustrated groan, and yanking at the fabric. Draco takes pity on him, leaning back to pull it off without bothering with the rest of the buttons. It’s too tight and it gets a little stuck. Draco has to shimmy a little which does amazing things where he’s sitting on Harry’s groin. Harry runs his hands up Draco’s torso, almost as if he’s helping, but really just to take Draco in. Harry’s seen him topless before of course, seen the lines of his scars, the tattoos Draco got during what he somewhat affectionately calls his
"Tomorrow," Harry agrees. "Thanks for agreeing to help out."
"I remember you," Regulus says, squinting his eyes at Draco. His voice has changed, from one of aggravation, to one of… curiosity almost. "You were Narcissa’s boy. She was so happy when you were born, I don’t think I’d ever seen her so happy in my life."
him, but Harry still can’t find it in himself to cross that barrier. He ends up heading to the Room of Requirement, falling back on old habits.
“I’ve missed you,” Harry whispers into his ear.
, which was less than comforting, but Harry figured that, as an Auror, if anyone could handle a malfunctioning house, it would be him. A foolish thought—but certainly not his first, and not even the most foolish, not by far. "There's nothing in the information I—Hermione—found that says anything about how the houses are formed."
It feels like the words are calling out to him and pulling him in, like a Siren’s song. It feels accurate, that Draco would be the fisherman, and Harry is the rocks that will spell Draco’s demise.
He’s not sure how well he’s succeeded. The house almost seems resistant to it; the books on the bookshelf he ordered last night have been rearranged, the living room furniture has moved around, and the blanket he folded away last night was pulled across the living room floor. That, at least, he’s righted, but he had to leave the furniture, and he couldn’t stop looking around at the house and imagining Draco judging him for it. It’s especially hard when he’s seen inside Draco’s home, the sharp flat that wouldn’t look out of place in a housing magazine, everything ordered and with its perfect placelines, with green luscious plants in every room. It’s a stark contrast to this dusty and discoloured house, the light that doesn’t seem to reach the corners of the rooms. At least the portraits are gone now, courtesy of Hermione’s hard work—first to disable the charms on the portraits, and then to remove them from the wall. It’s something at least.
Draco smirks around his thumb, and Harry knows he’s lost.
She walks across the bench to Harry and sits pointedly at the edge closest to him, looking at him expectantly. After a moment's hesitation, he reaches his hand out tentatively, half expecting a swipe. He's not had much experience with Kneazles outside of Crookshanks—who is probably not a very representative example of his breed (or half-breed).
"It was alright," Draco admits, stepping away from Harry, and Harry mourns the loss immediately.
, echoes around his head,
Harry can’t watch his thumb, so he watches Draco instead, watches as Draco’s eyes lock on his lips or his thumb, the way Draco's mouth has fallen open too, mirroring Harry’s own lips. Draco’s thumb presses harder, dipping just inside the crease of Harry's lips, almost inside his mouth. Draco tugs at Harry’s bottom lip, just a hint of pressure but enough for Harry to feel it, for his mouth to drop open further, almost obediently, and Harry wants this, wants Draco’s thumb in his mouth, feels hungry for it, wants that and more.
The kitchen is sparkling; Harry usually keeps it clean, but it’s nothing compared to this.
"Alright then," Draco says, exasperation seeping into his voice. "What do we need to do?"
"It’s a peace lily," Draco says, handing him a coffee cup.
In the morning his mother found the bruises, but Draco only shook his head when she asked what happened.
His chest hurts so much. And if this is what the room decided he needed, he’ll pass. It’s like losing Draco all over again, the pain of waking up alone made sharper for the taste of it he got in his dream.
"You’ve got a little..." Draco brings his thumb up to Harry’s lip, swipes at the corner of his lips.

in a way they haven't in so long, not even before they split. It's not even sex to write home about, really, nothing like the passionate or lengthy lovemaking they used to have back in their early days, and one time they even get interrupted by Lily. Harry has to abandon Draco to go to her, cock still hard and wiping his lube-wet fingers off on one of her spittle rags before tossing it at the laundry pile. He still wouldn't trade it for the world, can't think of anywhere he'd rather be, any
He rolls over quickly, scooping Draco into his arms and tucking Draco under his chin. If this is a dream, then there’s no saying when he’ll wake up. If it’s a dream it’s
"It might be a bit more work, but some things are worth preserving."
"I needed a change," Draco says. "When Pansy suggested we go in on a shop together, it seemed like that might be the right thing."
Harry's fingers close into a fist in Draco's hair. He pulls, lightly at first and then harder when Draco only moans around him.
that Hermione has recommended. Every other conversation feels like a difficult one. "Nice shop," Harry adds, quickly.
"So was Sirius," Harry points out.
“Some of us like our sleep,” Draco snarks, though that’s not true, not usually anyway. He’s usually a light sleeper, tossing and turning through the night and awake at the drop of a pin. But he can’t recall waking once, and feels rested now. He can see the sunlight filtering through the stained glass window, adding to his already sated feeling with the warmth it brings him. He feels like a cat, could stretch out across the sheets if it weren’t for the more pressing issue of
"Having fun Ted?" Harry asks, reaching to run a hand through Teddy’s hair. Without looking away from the set of trains in front of him, Teddy ducks his head, avoiding Harry’s hand completely, the ends of his hair flashing pink as he does it. Sitting on the floor beside him, Regulus laughs. Harry barely resists the urge to poke out his tongue. He’s
not to touch, so Harry places his hands on his thighs instead, digging his fingers in to distract himself. Draco lies back on the bed, hand moving down his body, ignoring his own flushed and hard cock to slide between his legs. His hand moves and Harry can't see what he's doing, but he knows Draco's spreading the lotion there, slicking himself up for Harry's cock.
"Really? What were you expecting? A Slytherin colour scheme? Snakes on every wall."
It feels like his whole body condenses down to that one point of contact, the soft skin of Draco’s thumb pressing against his lips. Harry swears he can feel the dampness there as Draco’s thumb rests there just a moment. His mouth falls open, and Draco’s thumb is so close to pressing into his mouth. Harry thinks about flicking his tongue out, licking the moisture up as nothing more than an excuse to taste Draco’s skin, to press against him and press against this moment, whatever it is that’s happening between them and see where it goes.
“Draco—”
It's even quieter when he leaves, back to the space that had once been as loud but now just looks empty. The space is so empty, the ghosts of their past even more present than the actual ghosts that haunt Hogwarts.
It’s sharp is the first thing he thinks—possibly a ridiculous thing to think about wine. It has a sort of spiciness to it without actually tasting spicy at all. He swallows the liquid, feels it burn on the way down, and when he takes a breath, he almost coughs on it, like it’s gone down the wrong way. His eyes sting and his mouth feels a sort of dried out, with a taste on his tongue that lingers and is decidedly
"So, what’s for dinner?"
Draco flushes a little and takes another sip of wine.
"Well if you’re going to be like that, maybe I won’t share my wisdom with you at the weekend."
It’s not, and Draco suspects Harry knew this. Draco feels the heat in his face, feeling caught out, and his words come tumbling out, harsher than he means them to be. “And you’re not.”
"I do." Draco says, voice hard now, none of the teasing from before.
Carefully, wand raised and ready, Draco at his back, Harry leans to peer around the doorframe, then leaps into the kitchen.
"Right," Harry says, looking at the lily again for lack of anywhere else to look. It feels awkward now, or maybe just
“See you around, Malfoy,” Harry says, low and soft, and Draco can’t be sure if there’s a sadness there, or if it’s all in his head.
Draco sighs.
He can’t believe this is actually happening.
"Right." Harry can feel he's fucked up somehow—stepped in it somehow, and it feels inevitable, like the sour feeling in his stomach tainted it all. "Sorry, right, I didn't mean—" Harry leaves the sentence unfinished. He doesn't know how to correct his misstep.
Draco’s slips his hand between them, knuckles brushing over Harry’s cock as pushes down their pants to get their cocks out. Draco’s hand wraps around them both, the moan echoing between their lips. Harry shoves his hands into Draco pants, pushing them down haphazardly, getting his hands on Draco’s arse properly. Draco moans as he starts to move his hand, a little dry, but it still feels amazing as he tugs at both their cocks He grips firmer, pulls tighter, and it’s not helping Draco, but he wouldn’t trade it for anything, especially not when Harry grips tighter still, thumb digging into his hip and fingers on his arse, almost like Harry

happened. I just want to ask you to… to try. To not rule it out before even trying.”
. It's not something Harry knew at the time—they were barely colleagues back then and definitely not friends—but it's something he knows from throwaway comments, both from Draco and from people in their group of friends. Harry and Draco became friends later, but Draco's experience has always been something Harry's been curious about. The hot sort of curiosity that intermingles with something else, maybe. The kind that makes him want to ask questions, want to get every single detail, while simultaneously wanting to know nothing about it.
Draco slips his hand out from between them, and collapses on Harry, trapping the mess between them, as his breathing starts to slow. When he can think again, he whispers a spell to clean them up. It only half works, Draco can still feel some residual stickiness, but Draco can’t bring himself to care anymore.  At least he tried.
of him: the the lift of his eyebrow, the way he makes tea, the way he rolls his eyes at Harry when he’s not paid attention in the briefing, and how Draco then re-explains it all, better, in ways that make sense.
“It’s sorted,” he tells dream Draco.
Draco pushes the door open for Harry, and Harry walks inside.
"Shhh," a voice—Draco, he remembers now—whispers soothingly. Harry's body relaxes a little, without even thinking it, even if his heart is still racing. "Was it a bad dream?"
Harry bites at his lips to contain the groan that's threatening to make its way out of him. Trust him to move into a house with a tantrum-throwing ghost.
Harry continues to move through the shop, looking around. The place would be a nightmare to catalogue, he thinks. There are more things than he can see, items Harry doesn't even know the name for, all protected by glass. It's obvious there's a system, groups of items kept together, and everything is laid out perfectly, obviously done with care. The shelves are full, but not cluttered, and organised so carefully.
“Alright.” Draco steps out of his hands and walks back in the direction of the bedroom. “But only because you’re magic with your hands.”
Draco sighs, places his tools down again, and looks up at Harry.
"Alright." Harry lets it go, as much as he wants to prod. It's not his business really, and who is he to waltz in here on a Saturday afternoon and ask Draco all about his motivations? Well an Auror, actually—who often has to ask people about their motivations. But he's not working, and Draco's not a suspect.
And that — that’s news. Draco’s suspected it, and it’s not exactly surprising, but still.
"No no," Harry says quickly. "I just. Wasn't expecting it. I'd like that though. If you do."
It might be a dream, but Lily crying in his ear still hurts, and it still tugs at his heart all the same. Harry makes sure to handle the usual parts as quickly as he can, putting the heating charm on the kettle while he changes her nappy. He cradles her to his chest as he walks around the kitchen with a bouncing step, and by the time he’s got the formula made up she’s already starting to settle a little. He tests the bottle on his arm, the action still familiar after all this time. When it passes the test, he feeds her the bottle, cradling her with one arm.
"I moved to live at the shop," Draco says. "You're welcome to come in for tea, or another drink. No strings attached."
he needs to look away, but he
Draco bites back the sound threatening to escape, gripping his own arms tight, pulling them closer against himself. He can feel the space low on his ribs, just behind his elbow, and he lets his knuckles graze over it, where he thinks the letters rest, even if he’s never actually looked.
