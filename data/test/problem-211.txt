Malfoy looked into his eyes looking for a lie, but when he couldn't find one he smiled weakly and nodded.Harry got lost in his eyes and unconsciously extended his right hand. Malfoy looked at him in amazement but quickly took it before Potter regretted it. When their hands came together, they felt an electrifying sensation pass through their hands.
"Don't worry it's nothing serious, it will be over soon – Harry tried to reassure him, but he knew Draco would ask for explanations.
Harry was even more lost every second that passed, what news were they talking about? He also knew that Ginny thought she loved him but she was only dazzled by his fame, but from Hermione, he did not expect it, because even if though it seemed strange he noticed that she had taken longer than usual in moving away from the kiss she had given him on the cheek. He just hoped it was just strange thoughts of him.
– You're welcome Malfoy. Just don't try to play with me, because if you do, Voldemort will look like an innocent puppy next to me. Malfoy let out a little laugh that to Harry, who had never heard it, seemed like the most beautiful sound he could hear.
"You'll know that later, for now, I need to know if you can get into Black Mansion– he sat down again and stared at the boy in front of him, - I'm just going to tell you that I need Potter guarded and protected anywhere, anytime, from whatever and especially from whoever deems him harm.
He saw a large group of Slytherins with Draco in the center giving orders, he smiled and made his way towards him. He passed between the boys and girls and planted a grand kiss on his lips leaving them all amazed.
Remus Lupin was watching the Eiffel Tower through the window, it was dark, and the tower's glowing lights stood out against the purple sky. Paris was a place that had always seemed beautiful to him, but despite the beautiful view he had he could not help but think of the letter that had come to him the day before.
"Wait for me here Harry, I'll let Minerva know that you will be resorted last” – he went to the door with a triumphal smile on his lips.
Draco saw Harry approach and opened his eyes surprised, but when he felt the warmth of Harry's lips, he closed his eyes and let his hands rest on the brunette's thigh and back. The contact only lasted a few seconds, but when they separated Harry felt embarrassed.
The twins looked at him with pity, but they knew it was necessary for him to know the truth, he couldn't trust anyone.
Seeing the surprised glances of the adults he felt too weak by what he had said he got up and quickly left for his room while the adults followed him with their gaze.
"Let Snivellus know that Harry has to go to the Weasleys' house– he stared at him for a few seconds before he spoke again – I suppose you're relieved to know that he won't have to see that being –he was pleased with the boy's serious assent and smiled to himself, as he liked to make the boy uncomfortable– Now hurry in sending that owl. The last thing we need is a problem because of his absence tomorrow – having said this he turned around and went towards his room; He had to take a bath to relax, leaving both men alone.
Harry had already put on his green silk pajamas when the portrait opened revealing the blonde wearing a black silk pajama.
– "Uncle Vernon, tomorrow I have to go to... one place" – upon the annoying look of his uncle he quickly added – "I have to start fixing my house to move out as soon as possible" – it worked. His gaze changed to one of joy.
He found the spell lasted hours until it finally ended, leaving his father panting and his forehead pearling with sweat as Lily stared at him in amazement covering her mouth with her hand.
He said, looking at him with certainty but without daring to hold his gaze for too long so as to not risk him using Legilimency. “I know that I shouldn't risk being caught; for that, the plan I have is simple but effective. With him I could approach Draco Malfoy, his father is Voldemort's right-hand man, and it would be so easy to manipulate him.” he winced through the words, but the Headmaster could very well interpret it as displeasure. “After all, he has always wanted to be my friend, and having the Prince of Slytherin as a friend, the Slytherin house will take me seriously and obey me and I could find out more.” – he finished, shrugging his shoulders as it was something really simple.
"It wasn't a dream Harry, you won't be alone again– he winced in pain – but if you keep squeezing me that hard, you'll leave me useless very soon.
"Of course not, I would never do something like that," he said with embarrassment, "Ginny's just confused and doesn't know what she wants, but that doesn't mean I'd hurt her. Ginny is like a sister to me; I can't see her as she would like – he ended feeling pitiful.
When he arrived at the castle instead of entering with the other students, he said goodbye to Luna and lagged behind with the new students. He looked for his head of house with his gaze and when he found her, he ran towards her.
Draco felt as if he been kicked in his stomach. Did that mean the Lord already knew Harry was his son?
Without him noticing he had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady and the professor gave her the password. He went in followed by Harry. The pregnant silence that followed his entrance made Harry uncomfortable.
“Yes, I thought so too. I just hope it doesn't go the other way and ends up convincing Harry to go back to Gryffindor.”
"And now I want you immediately in the library, you and I have to talk," he said, letting go of the two men with a wand movement and turning around—ah by the way...—he shakes his wand and to everyone’s surprise, Harry was left fully naked. – That will teach you to respect me, young man, I will not tolerate that you speak to me with that tone. Oh, and you are grounded.
"That's your decision, I just wanted to make you see a reality that could be. Now go say goodbye to Harry, I’m sure he is waiting for you and that is why he hasn’t come down.  – he saw the indecision on boy and added – Don’t worry about Sirius, I’ll go keep him occupied long enough. Now go!
–You know Remus, I’ve been thinking that if we don’t receive Harry’s letter tomorrow, let’s get back to Scotland immediately and look for him. Of course, it’s best if you talk to him first and explain why I’m not dead, I don’t want to cause him a heart attack if he sees me coming all of a sudden.
Even before he continued reading, he knew it was all true, now all he needed to do was know who his other father was.
He looked at the guys in the back and nodded. He turned around and went out with his trunk floating after him. He was so upset that he did not realize that Ron had followed him until he felt the magic vibrate and directed towards him. He didn't have time to raise a shield and closed his eyes waiting for an impact that never came. He opened his eyes in amazement and saw the professor in front of him with the wand raised.
"All right, I won't touch a single oxygenated hair now, but then hold me back because I can no longer bear to see this scene anymore," he said with his teeth clenched.
"There's no time to waste, I'll just tell you to moderate your questions – he spoke quickly – but above all, for nothing in the world, don't you ever think of insulting Potter. That boy turned out to be even more important to the Lord than he already was. Now let's go.
took the letter out of his pocket, and stretched it out to Griphook, who set it on fire instantly. Harry watched him curiously.
– Mmmm he may be with some conquest. All right, Severus, I'll give you an extension, you have until tomorrow at noon to find him and bring him to my presence. Don't let me down again, Severus. You may retire.
– Ginny, how can you say that? By Merlin, you're only 15 years old! Not to mention the fact that your parents and siblings would skin me alive, besides...
"After all, we're both Black," Draco replied with malice, "and it's not like I need your permission, Black, I already have the consent of the Dark Lord," He said arrogantly, and he smiled at the stupefied look in their faces  – "All right, I'm going to go see how Harry's doing". He turned around and headed for the stairs.
– I just sent the letters. I hope they'll answer me, at least one of them will," he said with melancholy.
"Well, nothing really, right Hermione?" he says looking at her, "just helping Mom with the house and hanging out in the yard.
When he walked into the library, he found Potter in front of one of the bottom shelves watching a book, and what a book!
The afternoon passed slow and fast at the same time, as Harry wanted to know what was hidden from him and at the same time preferred to remain in ignorance, he did not want to feel any more pain than he felt. But since nothing lasts forever, he had to gather his courage to place some sleeping draught in the glass of milk he offered Ron before going to bed, courtesy of the twins. He went to bed and five minutes later Ron was sleeping soundly, and he would for some time. He got out of the room quietly and went towards the back garden where they had arranged to meet to
Tom turned his head towards the snake surprised, it was so simple why hadn’t he thought of it before.
“You are only knowing the other part of your origins and accepting them. I think you're doing well, like I said, changes are coming and you're going to go a long way, Potter. I hope we'll see each other again.
– Look, Draco, if it will make thing easier for you, we'll make sure Potter doesn't bother you and so on...
Harry didn't know why, but he didn’t like what he was hearing, what the hell did all that mean? If something were to happen? what would happen to him exactly?
Dinner had gone as normal as possible, the only one who was oblivious to the tension accumulated in the air was Harry.
Voldemort saw the disgust reflected in the boy's features and stopped his hand. Any other time he wouldn't have cared, and he'd even have done it just to torture him, but, seeing that boy who had the same age as James’s son look at him with disgust made him think that when he had his rendezvous with Potter, he wouldn’t only be afraid but be disgusted as well. He couldn’t begin to explain why that mattered to him. He lowered his hand and walked around him with small steps, analyzing him.
In his Occlumency classes, he went very well, Professor Severus had left him several books with many exercises; the only thing he wasn't doing very well was in etiquette classes, not that he didn't learn but rather that he couldn't concentrate. He wanted to talk to Draco about what had happened between them but with all the things he had to do in the day, he ended up exhausted at night and nothing helped the fact that they had been assigned a room each and quite far away.
"Harry, I think you should go for the portkey you lent him yesterday," he said slowly looking at Draco. He saw Harry nod and ran up the stairs– it isn’t necessary to tell you that no matter what you have to do, don’t let him get to Harry without knowing his intentions. Right?
had only given you half an hour, but this is important – his expression passed in a second from being indifferent to one of complete despair as well as his voice. "My father is locked up in Azkaban... I know you're not interested—he hastened to continue before I replicated—but for whom I am here for is my mother—He looks straight into Harry's eyes and spat rapidly— The Dark Lord took my mother! – he sighed - As payment for my father's mistakes."
"Don't worry about them Harry, I'm sure they’ll understand," she said, " she said happily thinking that was the only thing that worried him.
"You don't understand," he said slowly, "I know something's not right, I feel it. It's like Harry's in a lot of pain and I feel trapped knowing I can't go out looking for him. – he took a sip of the tea before looking at the adults. – I just need to know he is ok so I can breathe a little easier.
–You shouldn't do it Draco, just look at his behavior and if it can't be done then tell him you can come in and... – but Sirius interrupted him.
The three expectant listeners blinked in confusion, looking at each other with surprise until a second later Sirius let out a loud laugh as he clapped, causing others to laugh with him.
"Enough or I will vomit," Severus interrupted with pretended disgust, "I'm disgusted by so much sentimentality," Severus finished.
– Tell him there's going to be an attack in... mmmm – he pondered for few seconds – can't be near Little Whinging because they could look for Potter and that would cause me problems... near the School either because that could lead them to Potter again... nor Hogsmeade because there were already attacks there," he said with one finger on his chin,-  ah! I know.! Tell him it's going to be near Diagon Alley, I'll send some Death Eaters there to get attention. But the most important thing is that you get something out of the old man," he said feeling satisfied, lying on the back of the couch.
– I... I didn't...– Draco didn't know what to say, he hadn't thought about it that far, but now he understood that he could lose him either way; if Harry turned him down or if he went with someone else.
Harry felt himself being expelled out of the memory abruptly. He ended up on his knees on the cold ground, panting. When he had sufficiently recovered from the ordeal, he picked up the
The blonde did not respond, he was too surprised that Harry had called him several times by name. He gently placed him on the bed taking off his glasses and when he turned to sit on a chair he felt a tug bringing him back. He turned around and found Potter’s green eyes fill with tears again.
“Shut up and stay out of it!” he screamed with rage and looked at Harry – “Who the hell was it?” – he asked gritting his teeth.
Harry smiled cheerfully and looked at Severus in a mute question. Severus seemed to understand why because he looked everyone in the eye and finally nodded to Harry, who let out a sigh of relief knowing he could trust them.
"If you say so, but well we didn't come to disturb your fantasies – they looked at each other before they went on – there's something important that we have to tell you Harry, but we don't know if you...—but they were interrupted by Harry.
Draco had returned to Black Manor twenty minutes earlier and had found Harry sleeping peacefully on the couch. He sat in front of him and asked Kreacher to bring him his potion book and tea with biscuits while he waited for Harry to wake up.
Harry frowned but made himself looked uninterested. He heard them close the door and got close without making any noise. He didn’t hear anything but he could see shadows under the door so he deduced it was a
He watched her leave and seconds later the two men entered the room. He watched pleased as they curtsy and then placed his gaze on the young man in front of him.
"I'll think about it, Potter, but...—he saw the boy's grimace of disgust and he breathed in —I don't assure you much, Harry.-  The last word was said a couple of shades lower. He felt tremendously uncomfortable but the smile on his son's face might be worth it— Concerning the scar I can't tell you what's going on, I'll get Severus to investigate. All right let's stop wasting our time and tell me what happened at the Weasleys' house—he saw his son's smile disappeared and he narrowed his eyes dangerously.
– "The master forbade Twynki to say his name until you agree to speak to him without bewitching him"–the elf writhed his hands nervously.
When he opened his eyes again, they were in the Mansion. He sighed in frustration and let go violently from his godfather.
The two went to bed and took their preferred position, with Harry facing Draco and clinging to his shirt and Draco hugging Harry tightly at his back.
"Don't let them touch you Harry or ill cruciate them to exhaustion," he said, reloading his forehead on the brunette.
He took out his wand and made a cut along his palm. The scarlet of his blood glows before a few drops fell on the ground. He closed his palm in a fist to force the release of more blood and carefully slide his palm over the entire lid of the box, which glitters in a pale blue color that quickly turned to emerald green.
ancestor! Besides, how dare you destroy my diary!? – he shouted, shaking the boy completely frightened.
A heartbreaking cry resonated throughout the house as the other Death Eaters swallowed saliva begging Merlin not to be the Lord's next anti-stress ball.
– It's good to know that some of your old habits are still there. I'll take your word. Bring me tea with some milk and biscuits, preferably...
“All right, Harry, I'll leave you. You're in good hands," he said, looking at the twins in a warning sign.
– Perfect Kreacher. Could you come back for me early tomorrow? - And since he was at it he could find out if what Malfoy told him was true, - and before you come back for me, I need you to investigate where Narcissa Malfoy is and with whom."
– Oh! Come on Malfoy– Harry was uncomfortable and didn't know what to do – Stop crying or your eyes are going to turn red and ruin your cute angelic features. - Harry wanted to swallow his words as soon as they came out and he looked at Malfoy flushed. - I didn't want to... I didn't mean...
"Yes," he said, going up to the bed, "and I'll take care of those who don't yet know that YOU're untouchable," he said, approaching his lips.
The banter his uncles gave him wasn't as close as to what he was expecting. They just picked the things up while they were yelling at him that he didn't even know how to use a watch. Harry wanted to reply that if he had one, he was sure he'd know how to use it, but he shouldn't abuse his luck that way, I'd better use it for something else. He'd make the most of it now that they weren't so upset.
"Enough Draco, ignore him," Harry said, clutching the blonde's arm, "Now that I'm no longer with them and they're not famous, they'll look for fame another way," he saw the redhead red with shame and smiled with satisfaction.
Draco stayed up longer, thinking of a way to find his mother. When he finally fell asleep, he fell into an uneasy slumber.
The unexpected visit by the Hogwarts headmaster had made the Dursleys know that he was now wholly orphaned, which had caused them to decide to take revenge for the time they had to endure at home in fear of his godfather's killer. Professor Dumbledore had gone to his uncle's house three days earlier to do the reading of Sirius's will and it was there that unfortunately, his uncles had realized that he had inherited a house and a lot of money even if they did not fully understand it; because what he had inherited was the number 12 Grimmauld Place (a mansion), several chambers in Gringotts full of galleons in his name and against his will that despicable domestic elf Kreacher.
The day was splendid. The night before he felt he was suffocating but the day made it all look different and he had promised himself that if things went wrong he would have Draco, his godfather, Remus, his father, and perhaps also his other father with him; so he would handle anything.
Harry hugged her and followed her inside the house. When they arrived at the dining room, he was amazed to find the whole family there, he did not expect to see Bill, Fleur, and Charly.
Merlin was it hot in here? He felt his mouth water, but he couldn’t stop examining the body in front of him, and that shirt that caressed his body in the right places and Fuck! It must be a sin for his pants to be fitted like that! Those black pants were so tight that it molded deliciously to his long legs, and his arms that were crossed in front of his chest seemed to him like the most erotic vision he had ever seen.
– Good, good. Let's not turn this into a meaningless discussion. Let's catch up and see what we do next– he looked at Harry and added—You guys start.
Draco was fascinated by the information they had found that he did not realize that Harry had fallen asleep until he heard a sigh coming out of the brunette's lips. He looked at Harry's face and smiled at the sight that he had fallen asleep on his shoulder. He gently caresses his cheek and deposited a kiss on his forehead, then attaching it to his chest so that he would not hurt himself so that he could finish his reading.
Harry feeling the contact of something wet on his skin woke up, woke up, overwhelmed, and turned to Draco instantly.
When they arrived, he saw Harry's glossy eyes, and without saying more hug him tightly as he stroked his back.
–Please Potter, save her! what do you want me to do? I don't mind humiliating myself more if you help me save my mother." Malfoy looked at him from the ground with begging eyes and he couldn't bear to see that look of pain on his face.He sighed with resignation.
Hello Guys. It's been a long time. This translation kind of went into an unannounced hiatus. I apologize. Updates are going to be every two weeks now. I will do my best to continue translating and giving you guys chapters. As mentioned before, this story is a translation and the original story in Spanish is far ahead so if you know Spanish and want to read ahead please do so.
"I don't think there's any need to tell you whose portrait this is," Severus said, looking at him seriously.
"He seems to be very comfortable resting so we didn't want to disturb you," he smiled at the boy's blush – but from what I see, you're both very tired so it's best if you head to sleep. We're going to go to rest too, aren't we, Paddy? He added, hoping Sirius would understand the threat implied in that sentence. But judging by his frown, he doubted that he had even listened to him.
"s-sure" he rose slowly putting on his glasses and he called the elf – Kreacher take us to my uncle’s house but stand in the bushes of the house so no one can see us.
"Just let me rest with you a little longer," Harry said as he leaned more towards Draco's warm hand, "and I don't want to repeat it again, I'd rather wait for my godfather and Remus if you don't mind," he said uncertainly.
Remus's laughter resonated in the silence of the Mansion and distracted the two men from their contest of intimidating glances.
– They will let him hand me over to ... Voldemort," he said in a whisper, "your family will allow Dumbledore to turn me in to be killed," he said with deep sadness.
When Harry stopped crying he held him even tighter, letting him know he was there for him; but when the brunette stuck to his body and felt his warm breath tickling his neck he had to suppress a shudder. At that moment he realized that he felt for Harry something beyond friendship. He wanted his friendship since he was a kid, but now he not only liked his way of being, but he was attracted to him and that wasn't good, he had just won it he didn't want to lose him just because of it.
– Well, now tell us, Harry, do we owe the mysterious savior your makeover? – he asked looking at Harry from top to bottom.
"Of course, I wasn't mad at you! It's just that...– He twisted his hands without looking at his father. "I thought since I found you and you accepted me in your life. Well, I'd have a normal family vacation. But if you don't want to, then...– He didn’t finish. He felt uncomfortable. Maybe he misinterpreted things.
– But that's impossible...because they... they don't... but they have hated each other all along, it is impossible that now Harry...–but he was interrupted by a whisper.
– All right, since we're all together, let's take the opportunity to catch up. We have a lot to tell you, Harry. But first I'd like you to explain what my pervert of a cousin is doing with you, with no one else in the house and sleeping together on the couch – he asks pulling him by the waist and lying against his chest, getting a snort in response.
Draco denied with amusement before placing a gentle kiss on the other boy’s cheek and lying next to him luring him to his chest. Harry let out a satisfied sigh and clung to the blonde's shirt.
Remus sat in front of them and saw the scene in front of him with amusement, but then frowned annoyed at Sirius who only made a funny pout and let go of Harry's hand.
– Of course Mrs. Weasley – she walked without looking back, lost in her reflections and mixed feelings.
Harry just nodded, not relying on his voice to express his gratitude, he leaned down slightly and laid his lips on those of a surprised Draco.
Nagini had already returned from her little feast, but upon entering the mansion she had perceived Tom's unease in the air, so she quickly slipped into his room. The scene she found was very funny, she rarely saw a nervous Tom and he was circling around an armchair as if he was possessed or playing musical chairs.
Severus was mouthing like a fish out of the water when he learned the content of the pensieve. He did not know what bizarre world he was in to make James Potter the lover of the Dark Lord and not only that, but Harry Potter himself, the Boy-Who-Lived himself turned out to be his son. This wouldn’t bring anything good, except problems and headaches that were already beginning.
Nagini, who had been sheltered in the shadows, decided to appear before Tom crucio’d the blond and made Harry upset because of it. She slithered slowly and approached Harry’s feet.
Everyone kept looking at the stairs with their eyes and mouth open except Nagini who had rolled up in a corner to rest a little mouse she had found.
Harry still wasn't processing the information when he saw her turn around and back in. It wasn't until Ron's cry resonated in his ears that he came out of his trance.
– All right, Harry, if that's what you want, we'll let you go, but are you sure you can trust Malfoy?
2) Old Dotard - an old person who has become physically weak and whose mental faculties have declined.
"We don't know anything, Harry," hastened to answer Hermione, "that they've been here, they've been here, but you know they don't tell us anything," she said, looking around the room, avoiding, by all means, his gaze.
– Well, it's too late. Today one of yours came to get you – he looked at the alarm in his nephew's eyes and he hastened to add – it shouldn't be anything bad because he was one of those that protect you.
While hugging his father he settled in his chest and hid his face around his neck. He didn't know how long he was like this, or when he fell asleep.
– Harry! It's black magic, you can't use it just like that. It would drain almost all your magic, that without taking into account the fact that you don’t know how to execute the spell and have an illegal wand in your possession unless you want to receive your parent's visit in Azkaban. He said a tad uncomfortable.
Harry followed the professor, but before he dared to look at the blonde again, and what he saw left him scared and confused. Draco looked at him with contained anger, he had the feeling that if he could kill him with his eyes, he would have done it by now.
He let out a sigh with frustration, he knew his godson, he knew that if he didn't want to be found there would be no way to do it, he had no choice but to send him a letter.
When they saw him disappear down the stairs, the older men’s gaze rested on the blond boy left in the living room.
"It seems that we won't have to wait long for me to meet the Lord," he extended the letter that was taken by Sirius, "he wants to see me as soon as possible.
"Well, don't get used to this because I won't do it again," he said, "I was also worried that if something happened to you I'd have the first argument with my father because of you, and I want it to be because he calls me "son" and not "Potter"–-he ended, making a pout.
– My lord? – Draco knew that something like this would be asked, he did not know what his intentions were with Harry, but if he believed that he would hurt the brunette he was very wrong.
"He's just imagining things," Sirius said near Remus, "I don't think they'll do anything to him. Molly loves him as if he were one of her own. In fact, last year we argued because of that; she was taking a lot of attributions that didn’t correspond to her.
Harry nodded and went up the stairs. He dropped into his bed to sort out his ideas and see how he would get to the Leaky Cauldron without doing magic and how could he get into Grimmauld Place. He did not know if there would be protections that would prevent him from entering, or if on the contrary upon entering there would be some kind of alarm that would alert the Order or Dumbledore.
"Potter, they will be your roommates, Blaise Zabini, Draco Malfoy, and Theodore Nott," he said, looking at them one by one.
“Wow, it looks like our Harry has a lot of secrets. We understood that no one could get in there after...– he shut up and looked at the brunette.
-There have been too many emotions for you today Harry and interesting discoveries for me. – he said looking intensely at the blond, who just blushed – so why don’t we all take a seat and talk for a moment. After you can rest and explain the presence of young Malfoy at the manor.” He reached his hand to Harry’s back but at seeing the distrust on Slytherin’s expression he added more for the blond than for Harry. – Agreed?
Harry hurried through one of the many corridors there was, but this time they didn't go down to the subsoils but entered a kind of white-walled room, with a desk and a couple of chairs.
Voldemort reread that damn letter for the third time and frowned more and more. He was too frustrated by the content of it and above all because he had not found its author despite having tried all the enchantments and spells he knew and that only confused him even more since the only way that the magic signature was not recognized was because his owner was already dead, but if that were so, then how come it came to him?
would have done something to him. He let out a sigh as he went into the shower. He didn't know what to do, on the one hand, there was the undeniable fact that Tom Riddle or Lord Voldemort was his father, but on the other hand, that same person hated him and wanted to see him dead. And he didn't know what to do, if what his dad said in the memories was true, he could with Remus's help bring them back and maybe, just maybe his godfather too, and if he achieved that maybe he could get his other father back, too.
He sighed and turned on the grass looking up at the sky. He recalled the day they had been left alone after several days, as Sirius was always present in his etiquette classes overseeing his progress and adding comments here and there.
"Harry, I know the last thing you want to do is remember everything, but if so, things will get even harder and we have to know exactly what happened to be prepared," he saw Harry nod and added, "we'll make you some tea and wait for you in the room when you're ready, right, Sirius? –  he asked with a tone that left no room for discussion.
“Harry, we don't believe them. They're saying that you joined You- know-Who and that's why you're going to Slytherin, that you're a traitor," Angelina said, and she denied frantically, “but I don't think so; I always knew that Ronald was envious of your fame and Hermione just wants to use your influence, but that doesn't mean you'd abandon us for something so low” she finishes with conviction.
He immediately got up off the couch as he watched Harry wrangle on the couch with his front and neck covered in sweat, his face had a rictus of pain. Draco knelt in front of him and touched his cheek, the brunette was burning with fever. He was panicking, He had to wake him up as soon as possible.
Greetings Guys. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas surrounded by loved ones while making sure to stay safe. Here is another chapter!
By the time they got to the platform, they looked at each other in the eye and nodded, they had said goodbye before because they couldn't risk being seen by anyone, especially the Wesleys. He was about to turn around and pass the platform when a tall man with brown hair and eyes approached them.
"My dad was very powerful, he wasn't auror for nothing. Besides, can you imagine if you had to go to Gringotts? – he asked with amusement – the poor goblins would surely tremble when they saw The Great Lord Voldemort enter through the bank gates – he laughed at the hilariousness the image produced.
“Of course not!” He exclaimed indignantly, that was too much, and he wouldn't allow it. “In case you forgot, my mother was the daughter of Muggles, and I don't know," he said, laughing without humor, “Perhaps that “Coward Malfoy” as you call him is a better friend than you could ever be!” He screamed, angry. He saw with satisfaction as he recoiled from the impact of his words. “At least with him I would make sure that he did not betray me at the slightest opportunity," he said, looking at Hermione as well.
He leaned on the couch thinking of his beloved James. Would Harry be as good at flying as his love? He let himself sink into the memory of the first game he went to see of his beautiful boy with unruly hair.
– On the other hand, I want you to investigate how to get my old appearance back. I need to get my human traits back as soon as possible, and you are the only one who can accomplish that. Now, take your leave, ill call you when I need you.
The letter was dated almost 16 years ago, but as much as he tried to remember something, his mind went blank. He’d never been with anyone, yes, had had one-night stands, but he never slept with the same person twice and he had
"Ha-harry" he took a short breath of air before forcing his barriers, when he did panic started to fill him – Harry! Something is wrong with my son! I must find him, Severus, take me to Black Manor. I know you know its location, I need ….
"Thank you, father, I know how hard it is to get the ingredients for the potion," he said, smiling, "then I'll see you tomorrow."
Tom was so surprised that he could not react until a loud burst of magic caught his attention a second before a spell passed by rubbing the right side of his face. He looked up to see a furious Draco Malfoy pointing his wand directly at him as he breathed agitatedly.
"I'm just here to tell you that dinner will be served soon" - he looked at Harry and asked - "Do you feel better Pup?
Harry turned around and saw Draco look at him with angry eyes and pointing the wand at him. He was going to talk, but he was interrupted by Nott.
With a wrist movement, he opened the door, revealing a Severus in his classic black robe. He looked relaxed as usual, but the Dark Lord was able to see a couple of drops slip down his forehead, a sign that he had run to get there as soon as possible. He could not suppress a smile of satisfaction at the fact that the man was still afraid of him.
Sirius saw him leave with his godson in his arms and was about to follow him when he was stopped by an enraged lycanthrope.
– What?"– he asked incredulously – What do you mean that he is alone at the Mansion? Someone might find him and hurt him – he was panicking and that wouldn't help – Moony fix your stuff right away, we're going back to Grimmauld Place today.
– I'm fine... And about what I’m doing I'm just going to tell you I have to send a couple of letters, and then you and I will sit down and talk.
“Draco! " Harry exclaimed in amazement and then he smirked "Tom didn’t Crucio you?” he asked with amusement.
– Don't call her that! Her name is Lily Evans," he smiled maliciously, adding – or Potter, she is still Mrs. Potter – her father's growl made him smile widely.
Nagini was sure if she could roll her eyes she would have. Tom always stopped thinking coherently when it came to the youngling.
– Don't worry uncle I'll only be a few minutes while I pick up my belongings. Then we will leave – He looked at Draco in the right and added – no one knows where I'm going, so if you don't want me to be forced back with you, don't tell anyone where I went.
– What if I do? –  he taunted, broadening his smile seeing how the Malfoy trembled with fury. – After all, it is my right. He is mine.
He knew that the insolent brat was awake listening to everything and because he didn't want any more arguments with his Moony because of the oxygenated guy, he would tune down his jokes. He received a growl in response and smiled smugly.
He saw the twins look at each other and then stared at him, so much so that Harry felt under a giant magnifying glass.
He quickly left the library and climbed the stairs as fast as he could, but without making his presence known.
"All right, I understand I'm not as dumb as I look," he said pouting, "I know that for now I shouldn't trust anyone, just you.
"S-si-Sirius?" he asked with fear, "Is that you?" he felt confused, but suddenly he understood – Oh Merlin,  Draco I've become crazy! , he exclaimed worried and with tears in his eyes.
He was so upset that he was inadvertently throwing everything in his reach against the door until it opened revealing Remus behind it, who just had enough time to lower his head to evade a jar that was going straight towards his face.
Young Malfoy looked him in the eye for a few seconds before nodding and loosening the grip by freeing Harry from jail from his arms. A prison that from what he saw Harry didn’t mind at all. He took Harry by the shoulders and gently led him to the couch where he sat with Sirius and Draco on both sides, each taking a hand from the brunette.
"You may be right, but the most important thing is that things will be faster now," the woman said with security.
He gave a frustrated sigh. All he wanted to tell him was that he already knew, but he wanted to see how far the oxygenated blonde endured jealousy before declaring himself to Harry. He went out the door looking for Remus to apologize.
– I suggest Mr. Potter, that the content of the box be seen in a more …. Secure place. Please follow me–The goblin walked to the exit leaving Harry standing there anxiously looking at the box in front of him.
He didn't know if it was real or it had been a dream, but he wouldn't stop to analyze its odds. He quickly got up from bed, took his glasses, and ran down the stairs to the living room.  He drifted in front of the couch when he saw a blonde head sleeping peacefully and looked around for something that would indicate that he hadn't dreamed of everything he remembered, but his disappointment was great seeing as there were no suitcases or anything to indicate the presence of somebody else apart from Draco. He was about to give up when he heard a voice at the top of the stairs.
Nagini, the Lord's huge snake, was screwed around Harry. Her tail was hugged by Harry as if it were a pillow, while Harry rested his head comfortably on the snake and the snake rested his huge head on Harry's hips.
Harry lowered his gaze with real sadness, not because of the Weasleys and Granger, but for all the other people he considered friends. He raised his gaze and sighed.
Harry opened his eyes getting used to the light of the room and rested his green eyes on some grays staring at him expectantly.
Here is the last chapter for today, Guys. The schedule I have planned will be a chapter every Friday. It can vary but not by much. I will try to keep it as such. See You Next Friday!
– That's obvious Harry, but you don't have to tell us where you are or with who, that's something that's better kept with you.
He smiled maliciously at the thought that he still hadn’t revealed the icing on the cake. "Ah, I almost forgot, this schedule will only be Monday through Friday". He heard a sigh of relief at his side and smiled wickedly at the owner of the sigh. "Saturdays and Sundays there will only be physical training because you will have Occlumency classes with Severus... ". He saw the completely desolate expression of the brunette and pitied him a little, just a little. "And Sunday with Malfoy until no more than midday."
– You’re right – Sirius kissed him on the lips gently before retreating to the closet to look for his clothes.
After Draco left Harry stayed unpacking his belongings. Kreacher had prepared two rooms for Draco and him, but Harry was not happy to know that he could no longer sleep next to the blonde.
For his part, Harry smiled satisfied that he had managed to get out of that confrontation unscathed; he did not think he could always achieve it.
He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he did not realize the adults had come out of the pensieve a long time ago and watched him in disbelief.
Harry looked at the group behind Weasley and Granger and saw confusion and annoyance in their eyes. He did not answer, he merely looked at Ron who looked at him with rage.
– If you can still joke, it means you'll recover soon. Nice going little Prongs!" Sirius said proudly.
Hi guys! First I must apologize for there being no update last week. Life you know? but anyways! here is the next chapter. Enjoy!
Harry didn't wait any longer, he had to know they were planning, and he wouldn't stop. He walked towards the closed door with the twins on his heels, when he was in front of the door he turned around towards the twins and took out his wand.
"I doubt it very much, if I've learned anything from that boy, it's how stubborn he is," he ended up with a snort.
"Judging by your expression when you came in, I have to assume you remember perfectly what happened yesterday," he started, "so then you're going to tell me what happened? And don't lie to me – he was quick to add seeing that the brunette was going to protest – I know that when you got from your "appointment" you immediately locked yourself in that room after telling your elf to get me out of the room. - He stared at him to see his reaction to what he would say – I also know that what got you like that were the memories you saw in the
Harry thought he would find Dumbledore or the minister breaking into his house, but he never thought of seeing such a handsome guy accompanying Severus. The shock was clear on their faces, everyone wondered who that handsome man was. Harry, curious to know who he was began to approach him. He had a certain familiar air that was intriguing to him. Without being aware he had come closer than he initially wanted, but he stood up short when he saw the man's mocking smile. In short, he was sure he knew him from somewhere.
– What will you tell him when he asks you if you've been able to enter the Mansion? Keep in mind that whatever the answer will endanger you or Harry–Remus wasn't entirely convinced.
Harry only got to cover the front and close his eyes tightly to avoid seeing the looks he was getting from everyone.
Harry thought it would take a long time to cross the dining room and get to the tower, but all the students looked at them in amazement and walked out of their way.
Draco had spent most of the day locked in the library; He was depressed and angry at the same time. Apparently, Harry wasn't missing him as much as he said he'd miss him, as he hadn't even sent him a simple letter to find out if he was okay. Just imagining that the Weasley girl would be stuck to Harry like a tick, made him sick and angry, really angry.
Harry watched him undecided. He wanted to tell him the truth, even though he was afraid of his rejection afterward, but he also didn't know how long he could keep the secret without losing his mind. He needed to trust someone and if things went wrong, he could always erase his memory and pretend they never met and have always hated each other. Though he knew that would hurt him greatly.
He buried his nose in the brunette’s neck while he in turn clung to his arms. After a few minutes, they were both asleep.
– Of course! His place is by my side, James as my husband and you as my heir," he said, trying to disguise how proud he was.
"Will you help me bring them back? – seeing Tom's gaze he hastened to explain – after all Lily is his best friend and she took care of me;  she would be like an aunt to me, a real one not like Petunia – he said, trying to convince his father.
– It's all right. For now, you must rest, I don't know what put you like this – his gaze slid slightly to the
"Too easy, all I needed was localization," he said with self-sufficiency. - Severus, cast an anti-apparition spell before they escape, and let’s get in quickly. – When he finished talking, he walked towards the door being followed closely by Severus.
– he observes the expression of bewilderment on Potter's face and rolls his eyes – it's not just any book Potter. Books of black magic are not only dangerous because of their content but they are dangerous themselves! If you don't know how to fight their influence you can end up being manipulated by them, crazy or dead – He explained seriously, making it clear that it wasn't a game.
"They don't agree that I look for my father, right, Draco? – he asked taking advantage of the absence of adults.
Voldemort violently shook his wand towards the door sealing it completely before someone dared to interrupt him, he didn’t want any more casualties in his army and least caused by himself.
– Let’s go, sleepyhead, rest while they come out. I'll wake you up when they're outside – that said, he pulled the body of the brunette over his lap without getting any resistance and placed him between his legs.
"Of course," he replied mockingly, and he smiled when he saw the boy tensed," I understand that you are on different houses and are supposed to be rivals – the boy nodded and blushed slightly – well, then I will let it be in your hands the option of choosing if somebody helps you and who they are; just make sure they are trustworthy. – he said seriously.
"I have to go; I have to settle some issues but... I'll do everything I can to get you to spend Christmas with me". He saw his son's smile of happiness and felt something warm spread over his chest. “Still, I’ll try to come to dinner every night before you return to Hogwarts. By the way, this is for you," he said, spreading a jar with a violet potion, "take it today before bed; it'll hurt a little, but by the time you wake up, you won't need the lenses anymore.
"My lord" he bowed and quickly walked out the door looking for Draco. He found him down the hall waiting for him.
– We will try to explain as much as we can, but it will be until very late at night. Your job will be to get rid of Ron and Hermione, for now, we have to go.
Greetings guys. here is another chapter. Hope you enjoy it! I just noticed that I deleted the announcement that the updates will be on Sundays from now on so ... yeah.
"The good thing about this is that if they dare to give you up to Voldemort, you'll be safe," he said.
am," he said, causing Harry to drop a growl. He got up from the table and looked at everyone. "If there are no questions I'm leaving". He saw everyone but his son’s slump figure nod. "Have a goodnight". And he headed to the hallway.
– You... I appreciate everything you did for me last night if it hadn't been for you...–he let out a sigh—I know the least I owe you is an explanation,  but the situation is very delicate and I'm still not sure I can trust you  Malfoy.
"Yes Weasley, listen to know-it-all Granger," Draco said contemptuously, "if you don't want me to send you to the infirmary.”
"As your three tutors will always be available, it is best for the schedule to be set. Therefore, they will start from 6 to 7:30 in the morning with physical training, from 8 to 8:30 breakfast will be served and young Malfoy will be able to take advantage, then you will study with Lupin from 8:30 to 12 pm, you will have half an hour of lunch from 12 to 12:30, you will continue your studies from 12:30 to 3 pm. Young Malfoy will have the time of 3 to 4 for etiquette classes, the meal will be from 4 to 4:30, the remaining hours from 4:30 to 8 p.m. you will train with Black and finally dinner will be served at 9 o'clock and I must clarify that I do not like to wait". He said looking in warning at his son, but this one looked at him in horror.
Voldemort was furious to hear someone speak like that of his son, but he but that won’t go unpunished, but before he could do something, he was stopped by Nagini.
He carefully folded the letter before ruining it with his silly tears. He knew he’d do the impossible if he knew there was a way to get his parents and Sirius back. He had tried desperately at the end of the fifth year to know if Sirius could return as a ghost, but no matter how much he did, failure. That only served to assure him that his godfather would never come back. He wiped the tears with his robe's sleeve and made his way to the box. Now more than ever he had to know what was in that box.
–Come on Harry, you've been through a lot today. You'd better go to bed. I'll come with you and then ask Kreacher to fix me a room if you don't mind," Draco said, driving the brunette into the room.
Severus received him in the living room along with the owners of the house and the young Malfoy, who merely nodded in his direction.
– Where is Young Malfoy? Why didn't you bring him with you? – he felt like he was starting to feel upset.
– Well, what are you going to do now? Apparently, the hardest thing was yesterday, you're not affected today," he said straightening up.
Harry closed his eyes when he felt Draco's lips on his own and gasped when he felt his soft tongue stroking his lips asking permission, which was granted, and had to hold on to the blonde's shoulders or his legs would give way. His tongues struggled to dominate, but unsurprisingly, Harry gladly ceded control and instead tangled his fingers into the silky blond hair moaning with pleasure.
Harry felt a blush and smiled foolishly as he watched the blonde put as many clothes in his trunk. Fifteen minutes later the trunk was on the bed with all included clothes, books, and all his belongings.
– My dear Severus so many years believing that it had only been a physical attraction and today I come to realize that you can love, we both can. But don't get confused Severus, you're an intelligent man to realize that despite potter's great resemblance to... James, you've learned to love the brat – he ended with a mocking smile.
He knew the day would come, but he didn't feel ready to face the consequences. Being honest with himself he was afraid to come face to face with Harry now that he sure already knew the whole truth, but he was also afraid to know the identity of Harry's real father, his instinct was telling him there would be problems.
Draco Lucious Malfoy Black are MINE, and I won’t allow anybody else to touch you as I do!” he declared firmly.
He rolled over his side and approached Harry who was instantly startled but smiled at the blonde and immediately turned around snuggling up to his chest. Draco sighed satisfied and embraced the brunette from his waist as he whispered in his ear a good night that corresponded to him with a whisper.
- Well, I'm sorry to tell you that if you don't tell me who your master is, I won't talk to him. - Harry looks at him decisively waiting for the elf's answer.
Malfoy chokes on his own saliva and dries his throat as he watched Potter move his hips as his eyesight was lost on his ass.
Harry would have been surprised if it weren't for what came out of Malfoy's mouth was no more than a whisper. He watched him raise his hand and direct his trembling fingers toward the letter. This was a good time to know if he could trust him, with
Draco was still embarrassed, so he just took his things and muttered a "Goodnight" before heading towards his room.
"No need, Mrs. Weasley, I'm sure he’s still upset about our little argument the other day – he looked at Ron who had red ears and avoided his gaze – it's best for us to have breakfast. I cannot leave your house so late or Dumbledore might worry, besides I have to go upstairs and fix my stuff.”
– Hey, you've done nothing wrong! –  Draco said when he saw Harry's blush, "Which reminds me... do you want to tell me what happened? –  he asked, placing a hand on the brunette’s cheek.
“But what are you saying Harry?! – he asked surprised – “Once you are selected there is no turning back. Besides, if that happened, we both know where the hat would send you,' he said with false concern.
Harry was tired. It had been several days since he had returned from the Burrow and had spoken to his father. Every day he received letters from the twins or messages through coins with news about change of plans, visits from the director, sneaky conversations from his "friends" or just jokes.
His aunt stepped aside by leaving the free passage for the young men while not taking her eyes off Draco, which annoyed Harry. They were about to go up the stairs when their Uncle Vernon showed up followed by Dudley. Harry stood up indecisive about going up or waiting for him to see them. Draco seemed to perceive his confusion because he looked up at the very moment his uncle saw them, frowning when he saw Harry and watching Draco's clothes with envy.
Tom got up and took a deep breath of air before talking again, this time with more peace of mind, but not least worried and now, besides, furious.
They had just arrived in the room when they saw his godfather and Remus appear or rather the fake versions of Vernon and Petunia.
Without waiting for an answer, he took Draco by the hand and led the way towards the door. They rang the bell a couple of times before his aunt Petunia’s horse face appeared.
“Yes Professor” on the way to the stairs he received looks of surprise, anger, betrayal, sorrow, pity, and some smiles of encouragement.
"Well, but won't you tell us who's the lucky girl or lucky guy?" they said together crossing their arms.
Harry didn't let him finish, he pounced over him and tumbled them over the bed, and He took his lips in a searing kiss. When they separated Draco’s, eyes had darkened with desire.
fallen in love. The problem was that this person sounded so confident that Severus's presence was indispensable before he completely loses his patience.
"No Headmaster," Severus replied with clenched teeth, "I'm sorry, but I don't have much free time, among Potter's private classes, all my Dark Arts Defense groups and Potions, plus the Lord's commissions, I don't have much time left to invest in anything else.”
"Shut up Ron, you don't know what you're saying– he saw their faces in awe, and he rushed to clarify – if I had my parents alive and if my father was in Azkaban and my mother was in danger I wouldn’t mind being a cowardly snake if that way I could protect my mother – he said furiously – I’m not defending Malfoy, but I think that I would do the same in his place. You guys are lucky to have your parents alive and free.
Her eyes opened in surprise when she noticed his expensive clothes and his blond hair but more so when she saw their hands intertwined.
"Master Potter," he said contemptuously, giving an exaggerated bow while he began his repertoire of insults to the half-breeds, blood traitors, mudbloods, and more. Harry sighed and let him rant at ease. He knew that if he wanted him on his side, he had to use all his pieces carefully.
"Father exaggerated when he sent me clothes," he said, scratching his head in shame, "it's best if I change.”
“He did what?!” Professor McGonagall and Draco asked at the same time, one with disbelief and the other in anger.
Harry moved the wand to reposition the spell, he didn't want to know anymore he'd heard enough. He stood there without moving until he felt a hand gently perch on his right shoulder, sighing, he turned and faced those who appeared to be his only allies.
Greetings guys. OMG First of all let me just apologize for my absence these recent weeks. *BOWS*  I recently acquired a new job and the first couple of weeks were .. hehe *rubs nose* Anyways, My schedule finally stabilized and I will continue to upload chapters every Sunday *coughs* hopefully.
Greetings everyone. I hope all of you are well. With everything going on its pretty hectic out there. be sure to stay safe. Enjoy the chapter.
"Tell me Harry" he took advantage of the state in which the brunette was and held his hip with the other hand.
– Don't even dream that I'll let you go to that house alone. We're going to have dinner first, and then I'm going to pick up my things at the mansion. When I return, we'll go get your trunk and we'll be back as soon as possible and then we'll see what to do—Draco said with a look that took no complaints.
"I suppose I have no choice but to tempt my luck trying to know why he wants to come in here," he replied with a shrug.
He doubted that Harry, as he was now, would want to tell him what happened o even want to tell him. He held him in his arms until he stopped crying but when he turned his gaze to his eyes to talk, he noticed that boy was aching so bad and he felt his heart tightened seeing him like that.
"You're Harry Potter, you'll achieve everything you set your mind to," He said, grimacing, but then smiled. “Good luck Harry” He gave him a gentle kiss on his lips despite Black's growl.
Tom didn't want his son to have any misunderstandings, so gently, nothing worthy of a Dark Lord, but yes from a father, he lifted the kid’s chin and looked at his eyes.
Harry gave out his wand feeling helpless without her, feeling that only lasted a few seconds as it was soon returned to him.
Harry hugged the blonde tightly, he wanted with his soul to believe those words because he never wanted to part with him anymore. Draco came to bring light to his world and without him, he wouldn’t be able to put up with everything without breaking.
– I received a letter from him a few days ago asking to be here today at 2 in the afternoon. I do not know the reason why he asked to see me. – he conveniently avoided saying his name.
– That mission is not only for young Malfoy, Severus, but I think you already know. I need weekly reports of the boy's progress and any inconvenience that comes immediately let me know.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. XD
– All right, Severus, we can do this tomorrow. Now what I need is for you to go get your godson right now, I need to know if he's been able to do what I asked or if he's located Potter.
"Headmaster", he nodded with respect, "I would like to speak to you, it is about...– he pretended indecision—I would like to be selected again—he asked firmly.
– Draco!  You fool! You had me so worried”. he was so relieved to see the blonde safe and sound that he didn't think about what he did. He went to him and hug him tightly, wishing he could keep him safe all the time.
– See Paddy! Harry must already know you're not dead and he'll be very happy to see you again. When do we go back? – Remus turned to see that Sirius was not answering – Sirius?
Harry looked at them for a few seconds, he felt uncomfortable under their eyes. Like he was at a ministry hearing again.
"Shh Harry" they took him by the arm and pulled him into a corner – Ron and Hermione climbed almost after you and have locked themselves in their room, they're talking but they cast a privacy spell and our extendable ears don't go under the door.
"Now we are together and within these territories we are free” he kissed his hair—now sleep that classes begin tomorrow.”
Harry smiled, content with the approval of his godfather. After all, he needed that little shred of humor to face what was coming.
Harry let out a sigh. How he wanted to repeat that kiss. At night he couldn't sleep well.  He needed Draco by his side and knew that at Hogwarts it would be even harder to be together unless... He jumped up, he had an idea of how to fix that problem and if he planned things right, he could get rid of Weasley and Granger and keep Dumbledore on his side without him suspecting anything.
"I suppose so, they always made me bored," he smiled, "although I'd like you to teach me to read the book upside down like you because I didn't learn that at school," he said with a smirk and saw with satisfaction as his cousin blushed bright red.
"We know you're leaving tomorrow. Mom told us because she wants all of us to convince you to stay and spend the rest of the vacation with us," George said.
"Crying...," he repeated, understanding what had happened, "those assholes! –  he saw the elf hit the wall hard and stopped him – I don't care if you want to punish yourself, but first, you have to look for Professor Remus and Black and tell them Harry has returned and to look for us fast.
Voldemort was giving sparks through his eyes, if it weren't for the fact that he now knew that Potter was his son he would have crucio the boy till unconsciousness. Although his wand burned with the desire to launch it.
"Well, I'm not so sure, buddy," Ron said with malice "after all, you defended him when I said he was a coward for hiding. Maybe you really wanted to be his friend and I was a nuisance in the way, but that will …
– I still don't know if I can believe you or not, but for the moment I'll give you the benefit of the doubt." Harry let out a little sigh and continued. - The time is up, I have to go back, or I'll have more trouble, but I'll see you tomorrow in the Leaky Cauldron at noon."
"No Harry, this is the point of no return – Fred said – and if we cannot stay with you we will just go someplace else if it's necessary.
Draco groaned when he heard Harry declare himself his own. He went down to his mouth and kissed him, sticking his tongue in, and exploring the delicious mouth of the brunette as his hands glided down his sides.
Harry lowered his gaze, feeling his eyes burn with new tears, and shook his head slowly. Remus and Draco gave Sirius a glare while the latter hugged the brunette.
– Stop Harry. I know that maybe young Malfoy is right, but don’t get your hopes up. I don't want to see you suffer if, in the end, everything turns out to be a trap to get you.
“Harry” he gasped “You have no idea how beautiful you look like this, blushing, agitated, and lips red.” He straightened to look at him properly. “If we don’t stop now, we won’t be able to stop.”
Annoyed by her behavior he took Nagini and together they entered the memories. He wouldn't say it out loud, but he wanted to see James again as he remembered him and his little Harry, only a year old.
“Draco, what are you going to do now that you know whose son Potter is? " asked Nott. “ I must accept that when my father told me yesterday I had a hard time believing it, you understand me, that is Harry Potter, the idol of light, the golden boy, son of the Dark Lord? I can't imagine how you will be; you have always hated each other and now you will have to live together always and in addition to everything, you must kneel before him as if he were the Dark Lord!” He said looking at his friend who had not reacted to anything he had said.
– No Harry. Just because you carry his blood doesn't mean you're the same as him. I've known you since I was 11, and I know you couldn't hurt anyone. You're not and you're never going to be like him, and I'm not going to let that torment you, did you hear me? - the blonde ended up decisively.
Severus walked through the corridors of the dungeons quickly, carrying his wand tightly, and didn't mind hexing a few students and giving detentions if his frustration came down a little bit.
"We're free until lunchtime," Draco said, walking next to Harry, "What do you think if we go to the room and I lend you my owl, so you can send news to your dad's friends and your father”.
He located the Wesley’s going up and when he thought he was going to leave alone, Fred and George saw him and smiled extensively they walked to meet him.
Voldemort was sitting in his favorite armchair in shock, his breathing agitated and his eyes completely open.
"Of course, Malfoy – he said with a grimace – besides, maybe things will go well and I decide to stay with them the rest of the Holiday- he said upset and didn’t notice the hurt look on Draco’s face.
Meanwhile, Severus felt the world come at him. Hadn't the useless of his godson heard a word of what he warned him about?
– I'm pathetic, aren't I? Maybe I did something wrong without realizing it and now I'm paying for it," he said without looking up.
He came out of his thoughts with a sigh. That distant Saturday, he had seen his love fly with such grace that he had fallen even more in love with the boy, which was never in his careful plans. After spending time with his friends, he had left them to spend a valuable half-hour kissing meaninglessly at his beautiful young man who had melted in his arms.
He left the letter on the table and set out to take a bath, but just as he was about to go into a shower, Nagini slipped in lazily.
"I would have given my life for them," he said, looking away, "I just thought that... after five years I meant something to them”. It ended with tears sliding down his cheeks, tears that he cleaned with fury.
They looked at him for a few seconds in shock. The first to get up was Remus, who smiled kindly at him and held out his hand, a hand that Draco quickly narrowed as he got up.
He hadn't realized that his eyes had been stained red, but Nagini and Severus had noticed and that was why the poor snake was curled in a corner and Severus had a trembling hand on the doorknob without turning his eyes away from the man in front of him.
– "Kreacher do you know if I can enter the mansion by appearing inside or do I have to come and go in through the door?
"Just be ready if someone comes up– and that said he moved the wand and, in a murmur had the spell that was on the door undone.
– You should know that this could cost you dearly. You are lucky I still need you and I had to say I admire your courage or stupidity, as you look at it, to speak in that manner to Lord Voldemort. However, I must warn you that it will be the first and last time that you’ll come out unscathed- he righted himself and smiled maliciously. – or almost. Crucio!
Harry was going to protest, but they disappeared before he could even process what they had just told him. He dropped near a tree, rambling about what the twins told him, and his throat squeezed painfully when he thought maybe he could only count on them.
"Mmm wouldn't be so sure," he said, releasing the boy and walking to a couch at the back of the library, - After all, your performance at Hogwarts leaves a lot to be desired –he continued, speaking loudly to make sure he listened to him.
Draco composed his expression and followed the Lord with a determined pace, ignoring the worried gaze of his godfather.
– Of course not! And you didn't do anything wrong either, but they did. They dared to mess with those they shouldn’t, and I swear to Merlin they will pay for it," he said, dragging the words and imbuing each of them with hatred.
The atmosphere relaxed and everyone forgot what happened, except Harry who had promised Draco to be very careful and say nothing until he was sure to trust them. He still followed the others and sat in the dining room. Dinner passed quietly without problems and an hour later everyone was chatting while they ate dessert.
Draco felt like shit, Potter wasn’t in the mood for his taunts or jokes. Whatever he’d seen in those memories left him defeated and completely vulnerable. He was supposed to take advantage but felt no desire to do so.
"Shut up, you filthy mutt," Severus said with annoyance "you heard the Lord, you'll go with me to the Muggle’s house, and Lupin will take care of Potter," he said, walking out, the faster he'd solve that problem, the faster he can come back— I don't have your time, move!
"I know, I've stopped trusting him too, I’ve realized days ago that he has been using me and lying to me as well. – he went silent for a couple of seconds, wondering how much he could tell them without giving himself away – I … I haven’t been staying at the Dursleys for a couple of days now.
Draco showed up in the kitchen ten minutes after he left, but Harry was so tired that he had fallen asleep again on the couch. He woke up when he felt a few caresses on his right cheek, but he didn't open his eyes trying to enjoy the caress longer. The fingers traveled through his jaw and descended towards his neck, suppressed a shudder but a sigh escaped him.
"Malfoy will take care of giving him quick etiquette classes, and since there's not much time to teach him to eat the different kinds of food, the least I hope is that he learns to behave like a pureblood on the table even if he still eats junk". He heard his son moaning and burying his face in his hands embarrassed.
"Well, and now let's go before I change my mind – with a wand movement he dressed his son and took him from his wrist to head to the library, being followed by a docile Harry who only stared at the ground muttering a faint
– Anything you can find out about you report it to me immediately and after that, I want you to...– but he stopped when he suddenly felt a tightening in his chest.
"Then he may listen to me when I tell him that I am his son and …  he started with excitement but was interrupted again.
-Well, I wouldn't be so sure Siri–he turned and placed his hands on Sirius' arms–you saw them these days, they're so close that they looked like one, they complimented each other in phrases, actions, and decisions.
Harry was shocked. Dumbledore planned to deliver him to his father so he could kill him, and that way ensure his own life and them…
“It better not be what I think," he said, cornering him against the wall, "because you, Harry James Potter," he said, poking him with his finger, threateningly, “
- See you, tomorrow Potter, - and saying this he took his elf's hand and he disappeared. Harry let go of a long sigh.
"Of course, Harry". He sighed, knowing that from now on he knew there would be nothing he would deny the brunette.
Tom raised his right hand in the direction of the house and with his palm outstretched uttered a spell in parseltongue, where, to his satisfaction, he saw the number 12 appear among the other houses. He smiled proudly as he delivered the next spell, and to Severus' astonishment, a large number of woven silver threads appeared, like a huge web covering the entire mansion.
Draco took a few seconds before he answered. He bent his right knee and looked the Lord with a serious and determined expression.
When Sirius and Remus left the pensieve their expression was one of resignation that changed to one of disbelief when they saw the Malfoy heir pampering a sleeping Harry Potter. They felt so out of place that they decided to point out to the boy that they had already returned. They both cleared their throats a couple of times, surprising the blonde who gave a small jump.
"Wow, you've got character," he said, taking him by the chin and bringing his face closer, "even though you still look like a scared kitten.
"It seems Lucius will receive a worse punishment than what I already had prepared for him," he looked at his son and continued, "well, I have more anyway, I just need to protect them and keep them away from you," he said reproachfully.
"Malfoy attacked him, Professor," Hermione spat, pointing an accusing finger at the Blonde while kneeling next to the redhead.
"Shhh," Draco said, putting a finger on his lips – “We both know that you are the best seeker, and it doesn't bother me at all to leave you the position in exchange for the cup," he said, smiling cheekily.
– I-I don't know, but...i-its. v-very ..p-painful – he managed to say with his voice laced with pain – make it stop Severus – he said stuttering.
3) Snake a la mode di Voldemort - basically snake in Voldemort's style.  (differs from the original in Spanish)
"We won't tell our mother that you gave us the money, but tell us, Harry, why are you worried about what our mother says? " they asked.
– I'm ready Paddy just needed to pick up a few things. Let's go – he smiled at Sirius's emotion, he looked like a little boy who had been promised a popsicle upon arrival.
– Harry, you see, during the summer I have been thinking that... well, with everything going on we won’t know when Vo-vo … - she stuttered.
Dear Voldy is getting closer to the truth, and so is our Dear Draco. How will he react once he knows? Is Harry going back to those horrible muggles? Will he tell Granger and the redhead?  Aghh, SO many questions.
When he finished breakfast he excused himself to go upstairs to fix his clothes and nodded to Hermione when she told him she would come up in a while to give him a book she had bought for him.
He passed his wand over his wound and proceeded to open the box. It was lined in red and gold velvet. Inside were four transparent glass jars that clearly contained memories. He watched them for a few seconds and then I call Kreacher.
Harry looked in the mirror and all he saw was Katie and Angelina's kisses and then something clicked on his head and he paled. Draco couldn't believe that... He never...
When the door opened and the headmaster came out, Harry came across a look that showed concern, he assumed it was fake just like the others.
– Potter – Tom hissed dangerously low, causing a chill on everyone present except the person he wanted.
money before returning from school, knowing that the privileges granted by his godfather would end when the Dursleys knew that Sirius had died.Not that he was going to tell them, but he had not wanted to risk that, somehow, they would find out and he had to go hungry; because the last thing he wanted to do was worry Ron and Hermione more than they already were because of what had happened in the ministry.
"Is your intention serious?" the boy looked him in the eye and nodded – My son, does he return your feelings – (1) he asked, not really wanting to know the answer.
He felt that the heat from his body was beginning to stay in his lower parts and he told himself that he needed a cold shower urgently.
"Wow I didn't know you'd missed me so much – he was surprised by the brunette's reaction but didn't hesitate to answer the hug – if I'm going to get this reception I think I'm going to have to go out more often," he said jokingly.
"Let's go before the effect goes by," he turned around and gave the blonde a quick hug, "I'll see you at night, wish me luck.
"Excuse me, Professor McGonagall—called Harry controlling as best as possible the tremor of his voice and looking the teacher in the eye.
"It seems to be a Howler," Draco said, untangling the letter, "but I don’t know to whom it …” he stopped letting go of the envelope as if it burned him when he saw who send it and for who it was.  _ Do not touch it!
"Explain yourself before I regret it – he dangerously stoned his eyes. For some reason, he didn't like the boy's behavior.
"Thank you for everything you're doing for me," he said with tears in his eyes, "but how will you return to school after what happened with Umbridge? And after you leave school what are you guys going to do? - he said with uncertainty.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. XD
he opened the window and took the letter. – Out, out, you filthy animal! Don't even think I'll give you something – he saw that the owl look at him with resentment, but he didn’t care
Draco stood motionless in the center of the room with an expression of surprise, he was so restless because of what he was feeling that he didn’t realize he was making a trail in front of the chimney.
"With regard to that..." Harry twisted his hands nervously. “I have a plan to keep me away from Granger and Wesley. He saw the surprise in their eyes when he used the last names to refer to his old friends.
"Yes, he's very important to me—when he saw his malicious smiles, he hastened to clear up—it's not what you think, he's like my... father," he said, looking out the window.
– Come on. I'll show you – he took him by the hand, and they went up together to the room where he left the pensieve.
Harry thought about it for a moment and thought it best to talk to Dobby before he left. He consulted the time and decided it would be better for Kreacher to come back tomorrow morning. That gave him enough time to talk to Dobby.
"I think it's best for all of us to go to rest," Remus said, seeing young Malfoy wanting to kill someone, preferably Sirius, and he couldn't allow it if he didn't want Harry to be upset.
What they didn't know was that no one made fun of Harry Potter, and that's what they were going to find out very soon. He came in with determined steps and dedicated a radiant smile to everyone. He wouldn't let them see him defeated and alone before he allowed it, he would make them miserable for betraying him.
Draco knew what was waiting for him and so he tried to run away from what would be a very unpleasant interrogation.
Harry nodded and began climbing the stairs with Draco after him, leaving behind his uncles and cousin but remembered his cousin's look and looked back just to see how he ate Draco's eyes. He stopped suddenly and gave his cousin a furious look, snarling me menacingly.
“With that, you will make sure that our little Ronnie explodes with jealousy, but do not worry we will be your shadow, we will make sure that nothing happens to you.”
"It's dangerous to come out his wet, you could get a cold Harry – his voice was more of a soft whisper – why don't you let me help you? –  and saying this he began to slide the towel down his neck by touching with the tip of his fingers the skin of the brunette who shuddered under the touch.
"It seems that Granger was very effusive when she said goodbye to Potter," Theo mocking said, "I always thought Granger was in love with Weasley, but I seem to be wrong," he said without knowing he was making a mistake.
"I don't have much free time, so I'll tell you what your missions will be and... – but his son clearing his throat interrupted him and he had to suppress the urge to roll his eyes, "I hope that you all will be
He inhaled and exhaled deeply and began to tell them everything he had experienced in the Burrow, relying on Draco's support in the most difficult moments. When he finally finished, he felt very tired, but also free from that loneliness that had been installed in his heart upon knowledge of the betrayal.
– My lord, it's the connection! "He said kneeling next to the Lord – you must break the connection with Potter, the boy's emotions are so strong that he has managed to transmit them to you – he heard the lord gasp and hastened – You must break it now! Before it is impossible to do so.
Both boys frantically nodded white with terror. The two had fallen on their butts as soon as the howler started. They didn’t breathe till they saw it disintegrate in millions of little pieces. Nobody dared to say anything, till Remus broke the silence.
– I believe... that you have your answer there Paddy.” Remus replied quietly, stunned to see Harry like that with whom he thought he was his worst enemy apart from Voldemort.
He walked into the room he shared with the boys and almost immediately regretted it. Ron and Hermione waited for him with their arms in indignant attitude in front of his trunk; it also didn't help that Angelina, Katie Bell, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were looking at him from a few feet back.
Over the next week, Harry had been a little busy, both for classes, homework, and more, and for the constant harassment of the Headmaster, but that didn't overshadow the cute moments he spent with Draco.
Remus watched him leave and took a deep breath to soothe his nascent erection. When he was dressed, they sat together on the bed, each with his letter.
"Oh, by the way, Harry, I almost forgot, did you know that Lucius Malfoy's trial has already taken place?" he asked.
Harry felt desponded by the pull but upon seeing that it was Draco he showed no resistance and instead let himself be embraced by Draco while feeling the warm hands of the blonde perch on his hips.
But Draco like the first four times had not deigned to respond. He was just walking back and forth lost in his thoughts. Harry had already taken too long, and he was worried about what that mudblood and that weasel could do to him.
– Excuse me, I'm looking for Griphook– he asked in a neutral voice, although inside he was very nervous.
– I'm aware of your rivalry, but I don't care about that. You'll follow my orders and make friends with Potter until he trusts you blindly. Understood?. – he threatened.
He opened the door of the room and allowed the blonde entry, who curiously looked at the room, only a small bag was on the huge bed. For not being lived in for a long time it was very clean, but he guessed that it had just been cleaned as Potter had been on Privet Drive all the time.
"All right, Harry, come with me to my office, but I don't assure you that what you're asking for is possible” he looked at Minerva and nodded. “Professor, please let all the first-time students sit together and announce that the selection will be taken place at the end of the banquet” he saw that she was going to ask stopped her with a signal. “I'll explain later Minerva.” Having said this, he walked with Harry towards his office.
– Are you talking about Mr. Nott or Mr. Zabini perhaps? – Snape didn't take his eyes off him; he knew his godson was using
"That sounds very good Dobby–. Harry watched him a few seconds before asking him – Dobby, I called you because... I wanted to know if you... could you help me?
– What are you doing here brat? – he heard a growl from Draco and watched with fear as the tip of his wand peeked out of his shirt.
Two hours later the team was formed, with Draco as captain and Keeper; Harry as a seeker; Marcus Flint, Adrian Pucey and Graham Montague as chasers; Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe as Beaters.
"Guys," Harry started not very sure, but maybe if he took a little risk, he could know exactly what was going on, "I know something is going on...
He took a deep breath before picking up the first memory. He knew that after seeing the first one there was no going back, but he had already made up his mind that there was no turning back either. He overturned the content of the memories marked with number one, closed his eyes for a second before leaning forward.
Sirius and Remus came from their walk through the city streets when they saw a beautiful white owl they instantly recognized.
He got up and went to the kitchen for some water while he enjoyed the blonde's reaction to the knowledge of Harry’s scrutiny. Returning to the room he found Harry speaking to Remus while he leaned on the blonde’s shoulders. He made a grimace but still went and sat next to him.
Nagini slipped down his shoulders and watched the jars with the memories. She rolled her eyes as a snake could and got down from Tom’s shoulders.
But he couldn’t finish speaking because that handsome man was approaching, walking with sensuality and Remus felt a shiver down his spine.
– Can you tell us what was going on here Harry? You aren’t thinking of taking advantage of our little sister? - they almost laughed at Harry's panicked face.
"Well, you're wrong buddy, they searched Malfoy Mansion and found nothing," he said with a frown, "they only gave him a year for being caught in the Ministry.
Draco walked a few steps to stand in front of the Lord. He stood upright without saying anything and looked at him straight in the eye.
"This can't be happening to me– he massaged the bridge of his nose – Draco please think. You know Potter is the son of the Dark Lord, what do you think will happen to you if he realizes you like his son and you want to sleep with him. Even Dumbledore wouldn’t be able to save you.
– I could break this spell by spell and end the barriers, but it would give The Order time if any alarm is triggered. So better...– He directed his wand to the ground and uttered another spell in parsel. Immediately a dense haze began to come out of his wand and began to slip between the silver threads – destroy them all, together.
"Imagine if I had accepted Malfoy's friendship, although that might have made me stronger – he wanted to cause them the same pain they were causing him, but he didn't realize it had been very obvious until he found the look of disbelief and a little horror from the twins. He blinked rapidly and added in an attempt to fix his little slip of the tongue – But, of course, that …
– Of course Harry Potter sir. Dobby will be happy to help you. You just have to say what Master Potter needs."
Harry looked at them without quite understanding what they were referring to, but something inside him told him it wasn't a good thing.
"Potter, you are an insolent brat. !!HOW DARE YOU STOOD ME UP AND LET ME WAIT LIKE AN IDIOT. Oh, but this won’t go unpunished, you’ll see when we see each other. Nobody disobeys Lord Voldemort and YOU least of all. Another thing you had from James, but that doesn’t matter now. DON’T YOU HAVE A BRAIN? HOW DARE YOU LEAVE ALONE TO THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WEASLEYS? You cannot trust anyone. USE YOUR HEAD IF YOU HAVE ONE! And YOU, DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY BLACK, YOU DON’T HAVE ONE EITHER! HOW COULD YOU LET HIM LEAVE ALONE? IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE INCONSIDERATE POTTER THE CRUCIATUS CURSE WON’T BE ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF YOU. I want to see you in three days AND YOU BETTER NOT COME WITH ANOTHER PATHETIC EXCUSE OR I will find you and cruciate your as.. -cough- BODIES TILL UNCONCIOSNESS. Understand?
"My lord.” He cleared his throat – I have it ready, I was going to come and show you what I found yesterday; but first, I wanted to find Draco to know if he had entered the Black’s manor. – he gave him the scroll with the information.
– Well, y-you see Draco... I, that is... Well... I don't know if...–He took air and whispered – I don't want to live alone in the mansion – he looked up to Draco and saw that he smiled tenderly —the memory of Sirius' death is still very present and living alone in this huge house would remind me of it all day. I don't think I can take it; his memory would drive me crazy. I'd rather go back to my uncles; it'll only be a few days because last week I'll spend it with the Weasleys.
His daily routines were strictly followed to the letter and thanks to that he had gained a little weight and muscles. He thanked that his father had given him the potion to correct his sight, or else he would lose every sword duel just for losing his glasses half-workout. He had also learned a lot from Remus and now he was sure that with a little effort he would compete for one of the first places, even with Granger and Draco.
"It's clear to me, but now you and I are going to go to the library for that book while I tell you how it went –he let go of the brunette and they left the room.
Draco knew that if he came out alive it would only be because he knew where Harry was, at the moment he would take advantage of it, he would not let Harry to his fate.
"What the hell...– Sirius gave the boy in front of him a serious look– when I catch you I'll kill you degenerate brat, I warned you not to put your filthy hands back on my little Prongs' body–but he was interrupted by Harry's soft words.
"He's gone for a couple of hours," he saw his pup’s disappointment with amusement – "But he said he would be back for dinner"— the illusion in Harry's eyes was something worth betraying over, even if he had to betray Dumbledore himself and the whole Order. "It seems he still needs to give some orders.”
Draco was surprised by what he had just heard, was it his imagination or had the other boy declared? But, when he was going to ask him what he meant with what he said, he realized that the brunette was asleep. He caressed his cheek gently and drew him further to him, as he was not sleepy, he would enjoy the warmth and softness of his body before he left.
"But he asked for it, if his father is in Azkaban it’s because he followed You-Know-Who – He replied even angrier because Harry had defended him.
He quickly approached under the watchful eye of his "dear" cousin but when he saw one of his hands climb up over the Gryffindor’s back, he snarled before pulling Harry to him with strength. He saw that the man was about to protest but before he did, he was detained by the grip of Professor Lupin, who just smiled amused.
"Listen, Weasley," He said firmly, seeing the curious onlookers who were approaching, "I don't have time to waste it with you, but if you want to know my every move so badly, ill give you my schedule, that way you can follow me everywhere and who knows” – he shrugged- “Maybe you’ll be lucky enough and I’ll give you an autograph.” He said pushing him out of the way without hiding his smirk listening to the jeer and taunts of the others.
–No, it looks like you were pondering something important. You looked very calm–he replied slowly wishing he wouldn't blush or give himself away.
–No, Harry and I were just talking. I’m going to sleep - she got up and before she left turned to Harry – think about it Harry – and then she left the room.
"Hey Harry, you look beautiful, “she said in her dreamy voice, "are you coming with us? – she asked, looking at the other Ravenclaws who ignored her.
Draco couldn't stand it and flipped the bedside table while the glasses on the fake window were starting to shake.
He walked through the door, walked down the stairs, and went through the living room. Ignoring open mouths and fallen teacups on the floor and asked about his room.
"You look a lot like James," he said, surprising the boy, "but you're smaller and weaker than him," he said with a mocking grimace.
– We must return Sirius. Harry is alone at Black Mansion and... but this time he was interrupted by Sirius.
– Yes Aunt Petunia, but don't worry, we just came to pick up my stuff. It won't take long," he said indifferently.
"Of course, the seed was already sown, they believed everything I told them, and I got them to think it was the best thing for everyone," he saw the woman rise in front of him.
– That's no excuse Potter, the mudblood you were hanging out with has better grades. Besides," he added, "when I was at school, my grades were the best, and James, despite being a rowdy one, had very good grades, so I won’t expect less from you.
He watched with fascination as the brunette shuddered and let out a gentle gasp. His gaze crossed with green eyes and smiled mischievously straightening.
"My-my diary—he stuttered and he immediately turned to his son—Do you have any idea what you did?! – he screamed – That basilisk was one of the few inheritances of The Great Salazar Slytherin,
However, poor Severus was worse off, kneeling on the ground completely sweaty, his wand up and his eyes exorbitant by horror.
I'd made it. The director's eyes shone brightly as he heard that phrase. I quickly scribble on a piece of
– Come on Remus, why are you taking so long? We have to get there before nightfall, so I don't wake Harry – he spoke impatiently.
– Severus, you will have time to continue lamenting your bad luck later. For now, I want to know how the research I asked for is going, now more than ever I need to regain my appearance.
– No Ron, forgive me too. I understand, Malfoy has been a delicate subject for me too but I can't help but put myself in his shoes that's it–" he said, "well leaving that subject aside, it's best to rest. I ate too much, your mother thinks I haven't eaten every holiday and took the opportunity every few minutes to refill my plate, so much food has made me sleepy.
Harry took a hand to his scar and stained his fingers with blood. He quickly took a dry cloth and pressed hard to stop the bleeding.
– Because of my scar Draco. We have a connection thanks to the scar he left– Draco stared at him and took his hands in a gesture of support – and it seems that he has already learned the truth – he sighed with regret.
"Potter what are you doing here? You should have entered with your classmates to the dining room” she said sternly.
“Good Dobby, I think it's best if you return now. I don’t want those two to be left alone too much and if something were to happen let me know immediately. And tell Kreacher that I entrust Draco to his care.  – he said while looking at him.
"You're lucky, but I didn't come for that," he said, holding his hand, "Our letters from Hogwarts have arrived and they are waiting for us to agree who's going to buy the supplies," he led the boy inside the manor.
"You don't know what this means to me," he said with a lump in his throat, "I thought I was alone, that none of you would support me.
Harry walked down the corridor knowing nothing, feeling only anger, pain, and disappointment. He wasn't aware of his magic was vibrating the armor where he passed, but Snape did.
When he returned to the room, he found Harry lying on one side of the bed covered up to his neck, and smiled. It was the greatest temptation he had ever seen. He walked slowly to the bed and looked at the brunette for a moment before lifting the sheets and going into bed.
After a few minutes, everyone started to retire and get some rest, so he didn’t have any other choice than to follow his friends toward the room. He went in after Hermione, Ron coming in behind him. He desired this conversation as much as a Cruciatus from his father, but he could at least divert the topic. Before they began, he raised his barriers, he didn’t think they knew Legilimency, but he couldn’t be careless.
Harry couldn't believe what he heard. His father was in love with another man and they were going to get married!
"Yeah Professor, he attacked Harry in the back" added Neville. “And it's not the first time, last night he also attacked him in the back when he was going down the stairs.”
"Draco isn’t who you believe, I can trust him – he took his bag from the bed and stood again in front of them – you don't have to worry about me, besides I need it before I collapse. I need to be as far away from here as possible – he looked at them with a supplicant look before adding – please let me go with him, I promise I will keep you informed– he felt new tears fill his eyes but blinked them away furiously; they didn’t deserve his tears.
Harry forgot everything when he heard the latter. He had been lied to, and not only that, no one thought to tell him anything. He felt a pain in his chest knowing that perhaps, after all, his friends were not what he believed. He was increasingly suspicious of Dumbledore, that just meant that if they were faithful to the Headmaster, Harry had nothing else to do here. With the terrible pain he felt in his heart, he turned around and dropped into bed, he didn't want to hear anymore, he was afraid of what he might discover.
Draco frowned in disagreement and shook his head. He saw the expression of confusion on Harry's face and added quickly.
He wished to have a family but he couldn’t let himself be fooled by Tom and end up dead, after all, he did not know that he had a son and that that son was the same person who wanted to see dead. He was afraid that his desire for power would be stronger than his feelings for his father and for his now "son."
"I'm counting on that young Malfoy," He said with a warning note in his voice that went unnoticed by Harry "Well, I'm leaving. I'll see you on your outings to Hogsmeade, ah! Severus will give them Polyjuice to take to the express.”  He looked at Malfoy and he spoke. “As Narcissa's disappearance has already been made public, there is no point in Severus taking Polyjuice so you will go directly with him. I suppose the Wesley twins will be able to keep you company," he said, looking back at his son.
– Perfect! Let Young Malfoy do his job and we will do ours – at Harry’s confused expression he explained – you cant expect us to let you meet with the Dark Lord without having learned the minimum of Occlumency. It would be foolishness of our part, and while it may not be very useful with him, it will keep you protected from any other person. Remember that your father’s letter said that you cannot trust anyone Harry and I am afraid lest of all in ...
"No," he shook his eyes, "no, no, no, no, no, this has to be a joke," a sob, "NO! – he screamed with all his might, hitting the ground with his fists, hoping that the physical pain distracted him from the pain in his heart.
Those present came out of their shock and brandished their wands. Draco seeing Harry's intention to get closer positioned in front of him, threatening the man in front of him and being followed by the two elders. Forming a protective barrier.
He watched his godfather and Remus look at each other for a second before nodding and turning to the couple in front of them.
– The one I’m sure you fell in love with – Harry taunted. He saw his father's grimace and leaped with joy– I knew it! – he screamed laughing, but then looked at him seriously. – Do you still love him? – he asked with uncertainty.
He felt his fangs grow and told himself to stop before he did something crazy, but before that he indulged once more in the sight before him, once again staring at the beautiful body he had before him.
Both looked at each other quickly before turning by putting themselves back to the house but also to the others who were storing the brooms in the closet.
– If you just trusted me a little more, I could help you with the heavy burden on your shoulders. You don't have to do it all your own Harry.
“Come on Harry, we'll join you. Don't worry, Mother, we'll take care of him—and without finishing speaking, they pulled a brunette who was still looking with his gaze for the mysterious man.
"All right Severus, we're leaving," he said, "we have a lot of things to do," he looked at the others, and he added, "I'll be back in a few hours for dinner. We must agree on a few points before Potter's return to Hogwarts. My elf will bring you everything needed to feed Potter properly," he said, turning around-  "By the way, don't worry about the wards, I'll put new and more powerful ones" With that said, he went out with Severus after him.
Draco knew that wasn't enough to know if he could trust Harry's life to him, so Merlin help him he would have to pressure him more if he wanted a favorable response.
The problem was that in his life everything was possible; and that was the reason he found himself laid on his back on the bed looking at photographs of his godfather and his parents, missing them and feeling more alone than ever. He loved his friends, but he needed something else... someone else, and not even Ginny had been able to fill that void.
He was so focused that he didn't realize he was just circling around his armchair, nor did he realize that a pair of sneering eyes were following his movements.
– Kreacher enough! I understand. You hate me for occupying the Black's Mansion and I hate you for Sirius's death. But I called you to propose a truce: if you help me in whatever I need, no matter what it may be, when I defeat Voldemort you'll be free to go with the Malfoys or whoever you want—Harry saw his eyes shine and knew he needed only one thing: to make sure. -But for the duration of the war, you won't be able to tell anyone, absolutely no one what you see, hear or do. Understood?"
Everyone looked at him with wrap attention, he felt a little uncomfortable, but quickly set it aside. He took air and move on to tell them about his entire plan, then waited for their thoughts on the matter.
Harry showed up in a dark alley, he could hear people's murmurs, so he assumed they were near Gringotts.
The next morning Harry woke up disoriented and alone in his bedroom's big bed. He couldn't remember how he got there and wondered about Draco's absence in bed. Suddenly the memories overwhelmed in his mind: Draco, his godfather, Remus.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
- You forget who you're talking to, Potter. – he said smiling with haughtiness – I’m not some weakling, like some others– he said, irking the boy again.
But this answer didn't come so he decided it was best to get out of there as soon as possible before someone attacked him. He turned and had barely taken two steps when he heard a voice behind his back that caused his skin to stand.
"Wait, did he write one for me?" He took the letter from Remus excitedly, but if he thinks I am...–but he was interrupted by Remus.
– Enough guys! That's something I would do for you all the time and if I had to, do it again, you have nothing to thank me for, you would do it for me too," he said seriously.
"I guess he thought about it," he said, smiling, but then he got serious “I... I have the consent of the Lord and your father's friends, but if you don't...”  he didn’t finish the sentence, suddenly insecure.
After Harry explained why Draco was staying at the Mansion with him, it was their turn to hear the tale of what they had done to prevent Sirius from being locked in the Veil after the curse cast by Bellatrix. He was astonished to learn that neither his godfather nor Remus could die until they put their souls back together or they were destroyed, but above all that their parents' souls could still be alive.
Voldemort had left the pensieve a few minutes ago, but he still couldn't believe what he had found in those memories. He found it truly incredible to believe that the little malnourished boy he had seen grow up as his worst enemy was actually his son,
"Sorry Sirius but Draco cannot leave. I'll explain what's going on but don’t kick Draco out of your house please– he ended up begging.
– What happened? Is Harry all right? –  Sirius asked distressed looking both ways, but when he laid eyes on both boys, he rolled them. – Can I Know… why the hell do you both like to sleep in “that” position whenever you are together? – he asked annoyed.
After lunch, they headed to the greenhouses with the Hufflepuffs. Although he had to endure the wary and envious glances some sent to him, he enjoyed Draco's company that always attentively solved all his doubts and at the end of class, he gave him a beautiful red rose.
Greetings again. Another wonderful and intriguing chapter brought to you by our dear author VampirepPrincess27.
Harry stared at the place where Kreacher disappeared debating what to do now. He decided to eat something light and then call Dobby. He lifted a board off the floor and took a couple of sandwiches and orange juice. He missed pumpkin juice, but he could have always had a little tomorrow. While eating, he tried to see the pros and cons of staying in the mansion without telling anyone; but after half an hour he decided that depending on the content of the information given to him in the bank tomorrow he would decide whether to stay or not; because at the end of the day the information should be important if he was asked to keep quiet.
He blinked several times getting used to the sunlight, but a black blur clouded his eyes, he tied to rub his eyes but his hands were busy, one hugging and the other being caught under something. He closed his eyes for a few moments, he didn’t remember when he had fallen asleep. The last thing he remembered was... he opened his eyes blushing instantly. His left hand rested on the brunet's hip while his right arm served as a pillow, he felt his breathing accelerate, and, which made it worse because with every breath his chest brushed against Potter’s back. He cursed under his breath for falling asleep. As he could, he wiggled out of the bed before he did anything foolish.
He got up willing to call Dobby before time got out of his hands. He felt certain displeasure at not being able to tell his friends anything, but as soon as he had all the information, he would let them know. He shook his head clearing that feeling and called Dobby.
Harry pulled him closer, gladly receiving that mischievous tongue that searched for a playmate. When they split up, Harry smiled at him.

Harry explained to them a modified version of the plan because there were still things they didn't know, and it wasn't time. When he finished, they both smiled and congratulated him on his incredible plan.
– If you value your life at all you insolent little brat, don't ever express yourself like that again about ... Potter –he spoke through clenched teeth, permeating every word with poison – I could never see Potter that way, he would be like a son to me and...—he stopped at the stunned gaze of the Malfoy heir and knew he would crunch him to the point of exhaustion for making him lose his patience.
"Oh come on Theo, leave Draco alone.” Blaise said, looking at his friend, "the job will be for us, we'll have to stop them from hexing each other and thus prevent Draco from being killed for daring to hurt the Lord's son” He said with a tone of resignation.
Tom got comfortable in the chair and set out to listen to his son. He could feel his anger grow on the same level as Harry's pain, but every time he saw him trying to withstand his tears, he just wanted to go to that hovel and slowly and painfully torture that mudblood and the redhead.
– James! – He let out a small sigh of nostalgia, remembering the first time he kissed him, and the first time he made love to him.
Harry arrived in the Transfiguration classroom with Draco between a few laughs and jokes with the other Slytherins, but his laughter died when he heard Weasley's voice.
– Well, if that's the case then do it. Bring him here, after all, he remembered my father, maybe he will give me the opportunity to tell him the whole truth and if not then …
When he finally made it down he realized that the kitchen was full of all the murmurs of the family members and he felt that he was beginning to lack air, he was afraid of looking at them in the face and in no way did the fact that the twin’s words resonated loudly in his head as if amusing themselves with him and his naivety.
– The only ones? –  Sirius asked in a tone identical to Draco's – What about Molly? Ron? –  he said upset.
Once he was sure the Headmaster was no longer in the office he sighed with relief and relaxed, but it didn't last too long.
"Oh darling, I should say, more than well! – he arrived in the living room and sat down -everything was too easy, everyone has a little bit of darkness in them – he said with certainty. – and they aren’t the exception, besides, I knew how to handle well they ones that could give me trouble.
-Wait Potter,- spoke a familiar, terribly well-known voice. Harry tensed at that moment, begging Merlin that this drag of words did not belong to whom he believed, or he would be dead. He turned slowly thinking it was impossible for him to be here. Serious mistake.
– yes Draco, that's what I mean. He received a similar letter and from what I can see he's too angry about what was done to them, what I don’t know is, in what role am I left in—he ended up talking to himself, not realizing that Draco was watching him as if another head had come out of him.
Hi guys. Did you guys feel that chemistry between them? Harry, I think your Slytherin side is showing! Rrrrr. The little flirts. I hope you guys enjoyed it. See you at the new one! XD
"You're right my boy, I've loaded you with a lot of work and that's why I'm looking for help for you.” He took a lemon candy and continued. “My old friend Horace Slughorn is about to take the potion master job. I hope to have him here after the Christmas holidays. But there is another issue where I require your opinion” He continued calmly.  “Remus contacted me yesterday and asked me for Harry to spend his first trip to Hogsmeade with him, but I still haven’t made a decision.”
"No. I was just trying to tell you that Harry won’t leave your side and that you shouldn't worry about that but about your feelings for him," he smiled rascally at the boy's stunned look—Even Sirius, who's not a werewolf, has realized your intentions with little Prongs. But what I meant is that when you're with Harry, your smell is... let’s say … suggestive – he let out a little laugh at the child's blush – I must admit that at first I didn't know if it was just physical attraction but now I'm sure what you feel for him goes further, although of course the wrapping doesn't displease you at all and I say it because I've seen you when you see him and...
"I don't know...– he was so confused and hurt that he felt his heart torn to pieces – I just want to go back to Draco, I want him to hug me as usual and tell me that everything will be fine – he ignored their looks of amazement and beg them with a look to let him go.
– At first, we didn't know what to believe, but when you arrived, we realized that you were suffering a lot. We know we can't alleviate the pain you feel for Sirius' death, but...
"I... I want you to know that I will court Harry," he said firmly, eagerly awaiting the reaction of the older males.
–But-but it wasn't my fault either, it was attacking the students! Also, why are you worried about the diary, it was just an old book that manipulated people with your..., - he pronounces slowly, "By Merlin! Don't tell me it was... that was... a Horcrux! – he ended up horrified.
They got on the train and headed to the last cart, which was always unoccupied.  On his way, he met Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. He looked at them sadly before covering his expression with indifference and following their path.
Draco appeared at the mansion ten minutes before twelve o'clock thinking his godfather would still not arrive and thus had the chance to collect some personal items he had left the day before. He went to his room as fast as his legs allowed and when he walked in, he stood still, surprised as his godfather watched him sitting from his bed.
Draco looked at his green eyes and knew there was nothing he wouldn't do to see that boy happy. He smiled and took the brunette's warm hands.
– Certainly Malfoy, but this information is very personal and... I'd like to see it first before anyone else finds out the truth.
He let out a sigh of boredom and rose from the bed to stretch his legs. He leaned over the window wishing he could get to breathe fresh air, but punished as he was he did not think he could go out, his uncles would not let him, which only left him only a way out to attend his date at the bank, and that was... to move to Grimmauld Place. He wanted to leave this house but was terrified of moving alone to his godfather's house, painful memories would consume him.
-Dumbledore – if he was expecting questioning because of his comment he received nothing of the sort. – yeah. I expected that. I dint like that he didn’t let me know he wanted to get inside the Mansion, I found out because Kreacher told me. His behavior is somewhat strange, he didn’t offer protection to Draco and his family, not even making sure with
"Of course he's innocent, he's not perverted like other people who take advantage of his affection," he replied annoyedly.
Harry looked at the portrait and immediately recognized it. It looked pretty much like the statue there was in the Chamber of Secrets.
Draco smiled and shook his head, muttering something that sounded like "Gryffindor." He leaned over and took Harry's lower lip between his for a few seconds before splitting up.
When he looked up, he was someone else, someone Draco would be proud of if he saw him judging by Fred and George's surprise face. He decided that in that game they could all play, so he hid his feelings under a mask of joy that he could hardly feel there and sat down for breakfast with all the Weasleys as if he knew nothing.
Tom mentally thanked the boy for having his eyes nailed to the ground or else he would have to hide his surprise and shut his mouth.
Harry rolled his eyes at the password, but still went in, the portrait closed behind him. he didn’t even look up from the ground or pay attention to what Severus said, he kept trying to understand what had happened outside with Draco.
"All right, Draco, I'll tell you the truth. I just hope that when you know it you don't hate me, although you'll probably be disgusted and you'll never want to see me again. Still, I will take the risk – he sighed sadly before getting up from the couch followed by Draco, who watched expectantly.
Harry couldn't believe his father did all that to him; He definitely still resented him for what happened a few hours earlier.
They didn’t have time to place a shield when they realized little Malfoy's intentions and were surrounded by a blue-white light.
"You seem to be very asleep–he saw his cheeks blushing deliciously – I guess you were very tired, so I suggest we go quickly for your things and go back to sleep, what do you say?– he threw a Malfoy-brand smile that melted anyone.
He was left alone in the room, watching with amusement how he ran up the stairs. He knew that if Lucius Malfoy saw his heir behave in such a way, it would probably give him a heart attack and even more especially knowing for whom he acted in that manner. He turned around and went to complete his little task.
When they saw the sender everyone was astonished, but no one took it. Until it got up in the air in front of Harry.
can help us locate him. isn't that right Draco?" he smiled with amusement when he saw the boy's extreme paleness.
Draco had arrived at the mansion and explained to everyone what had happened with the Lord and his godfather. Later, the conversation had led to Harry's Occlumance lessons before meeting Voldemort.
"Alright, that's enough of this show," he said, staring seriously at everyone, "I came to see Potter not any of you.
The conviction in Harry's voice gave him strength for what was coming. He nodded and answered his godfather’s letter.
Harry recalled that Kreacher told him that he had found Draco crying alone in the mansion. Besides, that was the perfect excuse to spend more time with the blonde and just leave his uncles' house once and for all.
Harry suppressed a sigh of relief when he saw only an empty seat and nodded up to the carriage without saying goodbye to others.
