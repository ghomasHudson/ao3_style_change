Narcissa was relieved to hear that she son wasn’t going to be a Death Eater, that way if they lost the second war her son wouldn’t go to Azkaban. If she wanted anyone to be safe it would be Draco so that someone could live on with the family name. She was sad that she wouldn’t be getting any grandbabies that are blood-related but she still had some hope with getting her grandbabies.
After a few minutes, people started to flood into the courtyard. Harry stood by a big tree, hiding in the shade as he looks around for Cedric. After a bit of searching, he was right over there. Cedric was with the guy and they looked to be heading off to the other end of the courtyard. Harry blended in with a group that was also heading off in that direction and started following Cedric. It didn’t take long before Cedric and this Guy started kissing, then hardcore making out. Tears started forming in Harry’s eyes and he gasps, gathering people’s attention.
Draco was Harry’s support system alone with Ron and Hermione. Harry had to remind Ron that he was still his best friend. Ron and Harry never had their fight where Ron stopped speaking to Harry. The reason this never happened was that Harry could open up and chat with Draco to get a second opinion on how he was acting and anytime Harry felt like he was alone in this fight Draco and Hermione reminded Harry that he wasn’t alone. Hermione could be a little harsh by the way she told Harry that he was not alone in this fight because of how irritated it was that Harry talked like he had to fight Voldemort alone. Draco had to be a calm middle ground and helped Harry come to terms with the fact that no matter what he did, he wouldn’t have to fight this alone. Draco also mentioned that this was just as much of other people’s battle as it was Harry’s.
Draco was doing what he could to be on good terms with Harry. Out of everyone that Draco messed with and was mean to, he wanted to prove to Harry that he was good.
“Nothing really interesting—just you know, boring detention. She made me clean and dust her office and some other stuff,” Harry said before biting on the inside of his cheek. It wasn’t like Harry was completely lying. Nearing the end of his week of detention he did have to clean up Umbridge’s office and dust her many cat pictures that line the walls of her office. He just didn’t say anything about the pain he had to endure.
“I know you said that your father wanted you to be a Death Eater and all that, and if you don’t want to talk about it, we don’t have to. I was just wondering if over the summer you learned anything about what they might be planning or not,” Harry just straight out asked. There were times where he didn’t have a filter and right now was one of those times.
Draco was one of the last to get off the train and once he entered The Great Hall all eyes were on him. It was obvious that people were very wary of him and very angry that he was even there. So many people wished that he would have been sent to Azkaban or at the very least would have just stayed home. Draco kept his head held high, not wanting to be seen as weak, all out of habit, and took his seat at the Slytherin table.
On the last day of his detention, he tiredly went to his common room to look through some books of “Defense Against the Dark Arts” because he will not let someone like Umbridge get the better of him. Harry had been through worth so he wasn’t going to listen to the things Umbridge was trying to drill into his head with the “I must not tell lies” being carved into his hand.
“Well, I kind of always thought you hated me. I mean, recently we have become friends, but still.” Harry says. He was giving Draco puppy dog eyes hoping Draco would say that he liked Harry in any way.
“Of course, you big goof. I would really like that,” Harry quickly says in a happy cheerful voice.
One sunny day Draco and Harry were chilling on the Quidditch field. “And then I was like ‘I’m not going to bring her back, she got what was coming to her!’ haha, yeah that was a crazy accident. My aunt Marge was a jerk, to say the least,” Harry joked as he looked over at Draco. that was a mistake as Harry tripped on his own feet and instinctively went to grab something to not fall which only brought Draco down with him. Draco and Harry fell to the ground and there was a moment of silence before they erupted in laughter.
“You are not going to believe what I just saw! But you have to trust me! I was going to the changing room to get into my quidditch outfit for practice. Even though my whole team doesn’t practice for another hour. That’s not the point! The point is I saw Cedric in the changing room making out with some girl. I went in to see who it was because I wasn’t sure if it was you or not and I went and got a closer look, and it wasn’t you, so I quickly went to tell you what I saw! Well, after I drenched the two of them in water… but still!” Draco was talking fast but just slow enough for Harry to understand what Draco was saying.
“Y-yeah, I guess I did… That still doesn’t explain the fact that you never told me that you liked guys! I guess that explains that even though you had pansy, who was all over you for the last few years, but you never dated her—or anyone for that matter,” Harry was confused but it began to make sense. kind of.
“Cedric, are you okay?!” There was a panic in Harry’s voice. He kneeled on the ground and placed his hand on Cedric’s cheek.
After they were allowed to start eating everyone got to talking. Draco was sitting between Goyle and Pansy. It really didn’t take long before Pansy started hardcore questioning Draco. “What was that all about Draco? Did you really mean all that you said? Are you really going to change? That isn’t very ‘Draco Malfoy’ or ‘Slytherin’ of you!” Pansy questioned. This is one of the main reasons Draco didn’t tell her about wanting to be good over the summer. It would have all been a waste of parchment paper.
Let’s just say that Draco was really happy to get back to Hogwarts so that he no longer had to deal with the tension between him and his father. He was also excited to get to become friendly with Harry. It was that same summer that Draco thought a lot about Harry, and only then did he realize that he had a crush on him. The guy he still has beef with was his crush. Draco wanted to make things right between the two of them at the very least even if they don’t even end up dating since Harry was with Cedric.
The day Draco got the letter from the Ministry of Magic telling him that he would get to go back to Hogwarts was a conflicting day for Draco. Draco was so happy that he would get to go back to school, but he was extremely worried about what others might say or do when they see him. The reason he wanted to go back to school was to try and prove that he is getting better and can be a good person. He also wanted to apologize in person.
changing for the good. “And why should we believe you Draco? You have been nothing but nasty to us for the past 7 years.” Hermione stated as she crossed her arms.
“WHAT?!” That was all Lucius could say.
year of Hogwarts.
“That makes sense. Well, what do we do now?” Harry asked softly.
much staring he would get from that night onwards. Plus, he didn’t want to get teased endlessly for wearing a dress.
“I’ll see you in a bit,” the man says before giggling and heading down the hall.
“To be honest,” Draco kept a straight face and continued after a short pause, “I never really hated the mudbloods.” Once Draco finished that sentence his father’s jaw dropped.
Cedric felt bad that he couldn’t be in a committed relationship, but there were just things Cedric needed that he would not just take from Harry. Even if their relationship lasted till Harry was of age, Cedric would not do it with Harry. Cedric would feel horrible taking Harry’s first time when he wasn’t into him like that. Over the summer Cedric did start regretting saying yes to being Harry’s boyfriend, but he just couldn’t break it off for some reason. Even with all that being said Cedric still couldn’t be faithful.
“Harry- I-…it’s not what you think!” Cedric quickly told Harry while taking a step away from the guy he was kissing. “The kiss didn’t mean a thing! You got to believe me; it wasn’t you, so it didn’t mean anything! Harry, love look at me…” Cedric honestly didn’t know what he was saying at thing point he was just saying whatever came to mind without really meaning it.
Draco had no idea if Harry knew at all that he tried his best to save Harry. Draco tried everything he could to save Harry Potter without anyone knowing and Narcissa was in on it. Draco had no idea why he did what he did at first. After a while though, he realized that he needed Harry around and things would be horrible without him. If there was anyone that Draco was going to learn to trust to help make him a better person, it would be Harry Potter.
“Yeah, sorry I don’t really know what you are implying,” Harry was very confused at this point. Draco groaned and grabbed Harry by the tie and pulled him into a kiss. The kiss only lasted for a few seconds before Draco pulled away and looked deeply into Harry’s eyes.
Harry Did everything that he could to try and communicate with Cedric over the summer, or any of his friends, but the Dursleys were doing all they could to keep Harry busy. They didn’t want him talking to anyone who was part of the wizarding world. Vernon Dursley still hasn’t forgiven Harry for giving Ron their home phone number.
As soon as Draco saw Harry crying, he quickly hopped from the tree and ran over to Harry quickly pulling him into a hug. “Hey, hey what’s the matter?” Draco says in a calm caring voice.
Once at Astronomy Tower Harry sees Draco once again leaning on the railing looking out at the stars. Once Harry made it to the top of the stairs Draco turn and looked over at him.
“Oh, no it is okay, I just needed to ask in case you did know anything that would help!” Harry moved closer to Draco and slightly nudged him. Harry looked into Draco’s eyes and smiled. “It is okay. I am just happy that you are by my side to help me with everything that is going on. I will do what I can to protect you because I will not lose you now that I got you! And that is a promise!” Harry chuckled softly which in turn made Draco start laughing.
“I completely understand Draco… Please just let me in, if you can’t trust anyone else, trust me,” Harry smiled softly and held out his hand. After a few moments, Draco took Harry’s hand.
Draco watched as the two of them got out of view. Draco relaxed and sighed softly once Harry was out of earshot and out of his view. Draco leaned against the tree he was in earlier and smiled. That was until Cedric walked up to him.
All he could do was hope something would happen tonight that would cause that to be unnecessary. Not that he had any clue what that could plausibly be. He knew what he hoped for, but that was as unlikely as snow in the summertime.
Harry watched him for a few minutes, thinking. Draco wished he could read his friend’s mind, so that he knew what the answer was likely to be, and so that he would be able to counter it if he needed. Finally, Harry nodded. “All right. But only if you can find me an outfit. I’m not wearing my leathers to a ball,” he added with a grin.
The next few days were spent avoiding Potter even more than he had before. And even avoiding meals, where he knew he would have to face Potter. Perhaps if he stayed away long enough, Potter would get bored and leave?
He rocked on the ground for a moment, but Potter seemed to have no compassion whatsoever. “Get up, or I will get you up and lash the thing to your waist, pretty boy.”
"Oh, you didn't! Really. It surprised me, that's all."
But there was another I hoped to meet. Harry Potter. Unlike my friends, I held a fascination for him rivaling my need to be a Death Eater. I was convinced, if I could have but a chance, I could bring him to our way of seeing the world. He would join us and the Dark Lord, and together we would all make the world a better place.
Some of the hope went out of Harry’s eyes. “Oh. That’s…why you asked me about firsts, wasn’t it? You want me to…?”
At that, Harry beamed. “As often as you’d like.” His arms pulled Draco closer, and Draco lost himself in the kiss. It was everything he’d never thought he’d wanted. It was perfect.
“Wash? Sweep? You’re kidding, right?” Draco’d never had to so much as brush lint off his clothes before. He had no clue even how to go about it.
Draco glanced at Harry, then met the Minister's gaze. "Sir, I have no defense." Harry hissed at the words, Draco but ignored it. Harry could fight this all he wanted, but it was true.
Unfortunately for Draco, his father’s patience was soon at an end with the way he treated each man who came to court him, and all the flaws his son found with them. With each suitor, his patience grew thinner. Finally, his patience could take no more.
True to his word, Draco's host visited, usually during meals once or twice a week. Compared to what Draco'd become accustomed to, it was wonderful. Of course, he still suspected Potter was behind the shadow which hid him from Draco's eyes. He never called him by name again, though.
Potter shrugged as he led the way to the road once more. “You were sleeping so peacefully, I didn’t want to disturb you, Draco.”
“I was eleven. Hardly the same thing.”
“Moony, it’s a dragon! Can we discuss language later?”
“Well, you have neighboring kingdoms. And you won’t be kids forever. Who says you’ll be able to keep peace with him? I’m sure he’s just as opinionated and persnickety as his parents…”
Harry took the tray, then looked up to meet his eyes. "Yeah?"
“That’s impossible! Who would possibly fit both mother’s wishes and my needs? No man in his right mind would pretend to be a woman for the rest of his life!”
“Not really. I mean, yeah…I was born here, but…this was never home.”
cuddly with me when you finally fell asleep?”
Draco shook his head. It was very annoying that he couldn’t, really, but there was no way to change that, so he would have to find another way to communicate with these three. If he wanted help, anyway…
"Do you?" he asked, surprised now. "How?" Obviously showing his face was a start, but if he had more in mind… maybe this might all work out okay?
“You mean…that man…Snape? He wasn’t lying? You’re really…?”
“Boring, like I said. Makes my job a bit easier, I suppose. Otherwise Egan over there would still be having difficulties.”
“And if he wishes to leave?”
Harry managed to open his eyes meeting Draco’s eyes, but Draco knew neither of them would last long, so he pulled his hand away.
Pansy worried Slytherins would be the only attendees, but at the stroke of ten, the small room they'd chosen on the fifth floor quickly crowded with partygoers, most of whom chose to wear the provided masks.
“No need to apologize, your majesty. I understand. I was just happy to help.”
Draco groaned and sat up, then gasped as his arms seized up from the unfamiliar workout they’d been put through the day before. “Oh, god…”
“Potter…what?”
to marry,” he said with a scowl. “It’s bloody awful. I’m ready to strangle the lot of them.”
“I hope, your highness, that we will manage two. After all, every child should have a sibling, don’t you agree?”
Generally, during these introductions, Draco’s parents stayed silent, apparently wanting Draco to make up his own mind about the applicants. But this time, Lucius stepped forward. “Gryffindor?” he asked, looking alarmed—for him, at least. “That is impossible,” he said. “The Gryffindor Royal family died out nearly twenty years ago.”
Potter nodded. “He was gracious enough to allow a poor craftsman to tag along with his group. But we will be traveling back alone. I hear that he and his entourage have decided to stay on for a few days?”
“Oh, I do apologize, Potter. So…what? You had to repay me by returning the favour?”
Prince Draco’s mother was driving him mad. She seemed insistent upon his being married within a year, and while Draco could not fault her for that (he was the heir to the kingdom, after all), there was no way he could ever see himself married to a woman. Even Pansy, the closest female friend he had, simply did not appeal to him in that way. It would be like kissing his aunt Andromeda. Or worse.
After he finished his bowl, Potter grunted, then stretched out on his bed. “A man could get used to that kind of service, Draco. You might make a good wife yet.”
Once there were a King and Queen who wanted nothing so much as a son.
Draco grinned, then shifted closer. He knew they shouldn’t, and yet, all he wanted was to taste those lips. Surely that couldn’t be such a bad thing? Apparently, Harry agreed, for those soft lips pressed against his, and the two of them pressed against each other as hands began to roam.
“Well, you were with Cedric, and when I thought about telling you… Well, you had literally just gotten out of a relationship with the guy.” Draco stated and Harry nodded.
THE END
“That is true, but some say your bright green eye color is even rarer than my grey eyes.” Cedric lightly squeezed Harry’s hands to get his full attention. Harry lightly tilted his head questioning what Cedric was doing. Cedric let go of one of Harry’s hands and moved his now free hand to Harry’s face. He cupped Harry’s cheek gently while rubbing his thumb against the other’s cheek. He pauses a moment before leaning in and kissing Harry.
“You can tell me anything. I won’t judge, but I can’t promise I won’t laugh.” Draco looked deep into Harry’s bright green eyes which were glimmered in the moonlight.
“Oh, come on, it isn’t your fault for what Cedric decided to do. You had no idea! For the record, you are not stupid Pottah. You are actually quite amazing. You’re goofy, funny, down to Earth, easy to talk to, and quite sensitive. Yes, sensitive in a good way. If you weren’t then it would probably feel like talking to a brick wall.” As soon as Draco finished talking Harry started chuckling and hearing that made Draco smile. Harry pulled away from the hug just enough to be face to face, looking at each other.
“She suggested starting a club to practice Defense Against the Dark Arts, so we know how to protect and fight in the upcoming war. I was kind of surprised since they kind of doubted me that The Dark Lord was back since I was the only one to witness it,” Harry says as he walks over to the railing and looks up at the moon.
Cedric was caught off guard, yet he was touched that the
He never wanted to become a Death Eater. That was Lucius' dream and his path in life. Draco wanted to live his own life, for himself and nobody else. Draco no longer wanted to be his father’s puppet. He knew that the only reason that his dad wanted him to become a Death Eater was to get back on Voldemort’s good side.
“Sorry, am I interrupting here?” Draco smirked and let out a soft chuckle. Draco made his way over to Harry and took a seat on the blanket. “Where did you get all this food?” Draco looked around at the food that was laid out in front of them.
Draco squinted slightly and read aloud, “I must not tell lies? Huh, that doesn’t sound like what she put you through was working at all,” Draco paused for a moment before continuing. “So, would you like to explain this, or would you like me to take a guess as to what this woman has done to you because I highly doubt that this is your own doing.”
Class when by as normal. Ron kept his eyes on Harry and Draco as they passed each other notes back and forth. Ron was being more protective than usual since Draco joined their friend group, at least in class. When class was over Ron quickly “pulled” Harry out of the class, but Harry still managed to slip Draco a note without Ron seeing.
One of the Slytherin spoke up and told Harry, “Look up in the trees and you will eventually find him. He won’t be hard to find with his hair sticking out so much against all the green in this area.”
“I know it is hard to believe it, but I am not lying to you. Why would I lie to you when I have spent all this time building a friendship with you? I might have been mean to you in the past but not like that!” Draco has a worried expression on his face. The more Draco thought about it he remembers every time he saw Cedric, he was flirting with someone different. He couldn’t believe how he didn’t see this sooner or how come Harry never noticed a thing. Draco started getting angry again and he just snapped, blurting out: “You’re so dense you didn't even notice! pay more attention to him and you will see that I am right!” Draco immediately regrated saying that out loud, it was meant to be a thought in his head, but it was too late now. Draco really didn’t want to lose his friendship that he just got with the golden trio about something that he was not lying about. He wasn’t trying to hurt Harry, but he was not going to hurt him more by keeping something like this a secret from him.
“Sorry, I was really hungry, and I had to find a way to sneak away without Goyle and Pansy finding out,” Draco said in a soft quiet voice. Harry patted the seat open next to him and Draco walked over slowly before sitting next to Harry. “So, why did you call me out here?” Draco asked as the question was honestly driving him crazy.
“Actually, something did happen… but I am not meant to talk about it. With the Dursleys, well other than a lot of hard work, yelling, and my cousin making fun of me, it was pretty normal summer.” Harry looked sad as he had to think back to what had happened. Even though he was dating Cedric there was no way Harry was going to admit that Dudley heard Harry say Cedric’s name in his sleep. That is way too embarrassing to say out loud. It was already bad enough that Dudley said it out loud to Harry in front of his “gang.” With the dementor attack well, the Order didn’t want Harry to go spreading out “lies” which was the truth. That being that Voldemort was back and him being responsible for the rogue dementor that attacked him and his cousin. “I also had to go to trial and the reason is the event I am not allowed to talk about.”
“It is a long story… It is not that I don’t want to tell you! Don’t get the wrong idea. It’s just that—let me start from the beginning,” Draco looks away from Harry and looks up at the moon. “Ever since I was young my father wasn’t the affectionate person and so to try and get his attention. I tried to do any that I could get his attention by doing the things that I thought he would approve of. That included being a big jerk to anyone who I wasn’t a pureblood. My father despised Mudbloods and so I lashed out at Hermione and tried to make fun of her any way that I could. My father wasn’t the guy who I thought he was. You see since The Dark Lord had come back the topic of me becoming a Death Eater had come up over the summer. My Father was trying to pressure me into becoming a Death Eater because it was greatly “benefit the family” which was such a lie. My father lied his way out of going to Azkaban and because he didn’t even try and find The Dark Lord, he is untrustworthy in the eyes of The Dark Lord, so he is trying to use me to get back on his good side. He really thought he could fool me but that was not going to happen. I am not an idiot,” Draco had paused for dramatic effect. “Plus, I was getting sick and tired of living for my father and not for myself. There was so much about me that no one knows about, and I wanted to share with others and stop hiding from others and especially myself.” Draco finished speaking and looked over at Harry who was stuffing his face with food, he looked to be hungry. The way he ate reminded Draco of the way Ron eats. Draco realized he should eat too before the bell chimed. So, Draco started eating.
“I am going to head out, I will chat with you guy later,” Harry got up, trying to not act like he is rushing, and makes his way out of The Great Hall. He waits till he sees Draco out of view before following after him.
“Harry… I have known you long enough to tell when you are lying to me. Tell me about everything that happened,” Draco said as he began lightly tapping his foot. Not because he was impatient it was more because he knew that whatever he was about to hear he wasn’t going to like it. Draco tapping his foot was more of something while trying to stay calm and not get angry at what he might hear.
Harry studied Draco’s face closely before narrowing his eye. “Is there something you haven’t told me yet that they are making fun of you about?” All Draco did was nod. “It must be a sensitive subject…” Harry paused for a moment. “Remember I won’t judge you about anything, but I would like to know, if you are okay with it, to maybe help you.”
Draco turned and looked over at Harry, “Wh-what? I mean, about what?” Draco stuttered. His heart was starting to pound in his chest. Draco studied Harry’s face closely. Harry looked to be thinking. His black hair was messy with a few stands in front of his glasses. His hair was always a mess, but Draco thought it looked really good like that. It looked like styled messy hair. In the moonlight, Harry’s bright green eyes really popped and stood out in the darkish room. Draco had to tell himself, in his head, to focus because Harry was beginning to speak again.
“Oh, yeah I am up here? What took you so long? I was waiting for bloody ages” Harry called out. Draco walked up the stairs and saw Harry sitting on a red and white picnic blanket. Draco was slightly uncomfortable being in the tower since he hasn’t been in this place since… That one night.
They were a cute and clumsy couple.
As soon as the conversation ended Harry quickly headed to class doing his best not to be seen by Cedric. This is what Harry was waiting for. The main proof Harry was looking for before he would end the relationship with Cedric was to see Cedric kissing someone else and so far, Harry hasn’t seen it. This meeting though was going to be the proof that Harry was looking for. Harry was going to walk in on the make-out appointment and acted like he didn’t know what was going on. He was going to act shocked and cause a scene.
“I never dated anyone because no one, not even my parents knew that I was gay. At the time I didn’t think that I liked anyone, but over the summer I realized that I had a small crush on you the whole time. When we became friends that crush only grew. Plus, you are not really that observant,” Draco was really happy that Harry liked him back and the same with Harry. Harry was thrilled that Draco liked him back and has liked him for so long.
“Okay… so there was more discipline than just the cleaning,” Harry states as he fidgets with the sleeve on his left arm. Draco leans over to Harry and looked at the other’s left hand and wrist.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t know anything. My father almost completely stopped talking to me. He only talked to me when he had to, but it had nothing about what was going on. Not even my mom would tell me anything without getting in a lot of trouble. I am just in the dark as you are. Sorry, I am not much help,” Draco said with a slightly sad voice. He felt bad he wasn’t any help at this moment.
“I don’t think I can continue… My body is refusing to move and even if I do, I am sure I’ll be way too shaky. I’ll just end up falling if I try to continue. Cedric looked to the side and saw his wand. After a lot of struggling, he got his body to grab the wand and point it up at the sky, having red sparks shoot out of his wand and into the sky. Cedric was officially out of the race. “You may have one by default, but you should still search for your price. The cup that is,” Cedric smiles weakly before closing his eyes.
The Golden Trio had 4 members now and Harry couldn’t be happier about it. Everything else is just as it says in the book.
“Bingo. I snapped at her, and I yelled, saying that she was lying about—HIM, not being back.” Harry finished.
“Yes sir, very clear,” the three quickly barked out. When Snape turned back around the three let out a quiet sigh of relief. The lesson went on and the three tried not to get distracted. Draco can’t help it and sends Harry a note.
H- ‘Let’s have a picnic for dinner! Meet me at the Astronomy tower at 6 p.m. I want to hang out without having Ron or Hermione breathe down our necks and watching us. Also, I will not be taking “No” as an answer. See you later Draco.’
In the Triwizard Tournament, the second event involved saving someone you cared about. Now, since Harry and Cedric were both competing in the tournament, they couldn’t save each other so someone else was picked.
“That is a really good idea. Do you think anyone will join?” Draco asks.
Draco chuckled to himself before folding the paper and putting it in his robe. “I’ll see you soon Pottah.” Draco headed off to his next class. All-day, the only thing that he could think about was going and seeing Harry and having a little picnic. Draco was also nervous because he couldn’t tell if this was meant to be a date or not. I mean Harry just got out of a relationship, but who knows what is going on his Harry’s head.
“Am I, interrupting something?” Snape spoke, practically hissing his words at the three. They all quickly shook their heads and crumpled up their notes hiding them in their robes. “Good. If you mess up this potion because you weren’t listening to how each ingredient affects the potions you might just end up making an explosion, or worse, a poison. If you do that, I am not helping with the antidote. Now pay attention or I will give you three detention. Do I make myself clear?”
Lucius sent Draco to his room so he and Narcissa could talk. And for the rest of the summer, Lucius refused to make eye contact with Draco or even talk with him. Lucius only talked to Draco when he absolutely had to. Draco told his father that even though he wasn’t going to be a Death Eater he would still go and do the same work his father did to keep up that family name in that way. That made Lucius a little happy, but he was still salty, so he didn’t say much over the summer.
“Draco Malfoy, I demand you to speak to me! I don’t really understand why you are running away from me and ignoring me. You are really being a prat!” Harry was annoyed and really upset. “You didn’t sound crazy. It is okay that you didn’t understand how you saved me. I… But I am still really grateful that you did!” Harry waiting for a response and Draco was frozen in place. A million thoughts rushed through Draco’s head. “What are you scared of Draco?”
H: ‘Good to know.’
From this point on Things go on how it normally does in the books just with a few things different. Draco helped convince people that Voldemort was back and the club forms with Harry as the teacher. Draco would help teach others as well when he could while also practicing the spells Harry was teaching and having others practice. Not long after they became a couple, they told Ron and Hermione about them. Ron was extremely shocked, but Hermione saw it coming somehow. The fact Hermione saw it coming shocked Draco and Harry because they thought they were being really sneaky, but nothing can get past Hermione.
D- ‘You know it!’
“I don’t know if I would be a good teacher or not… I would have to think about it. We should gather people together who would want to join the club first and see who they think should be the teacher,” Harry stated. He wasn’t sure if anyone was even going to join the club except for his friends.
Draco spent all night tossing and turning. He was really tired, but his thoughts wouldn’t shut up. He honestly wished he hadn’t gone to the tower. For the next few weeks after that moment, Harry would try to talk to Draco, but Draco would quickly leave before Harry even say anything. A full month has passed, and Harry still couldn’t get a word in to speak to Draco.
People started to head to their common rooms by this point and The Great Hall started to empty. There is a group of people that stayed behind though, Draco and his group. The whole dinner Draco kept looking over at Harry. Draco didn’t trust Cedric. It could be because he is ever so slightly jealous that he was with Harry, or maybe Cedric was just giving off the wrong vibes around Draco. One this is for sure and that is Draco will never admit to being jealous. That is unless he is forced or needed to say it.
Headmistress McGonagall Quickly got everyone’s attention and the normal speeches started. Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table to look for Harry. Draco just needed to make sure that he was here. After a little bit of searching, he found him. Draco let out a quiet sigh of relief and turned his attention back to McGonagall. “Before we go on to sorting the first years into their houses, I would like to bring everyone’s attention to Draco Malfoy.” Everyone quickly turned their head to Draco. Draco took a deep breath and stood up. “Mr. Malfoy would like to say a few words. Would you please come up here dear,” McGonagall finished as Draco made his way to the front of the room. All eyes following his every move. It was such a long time ago that Draco sent out that letter asking for him to make a speech if he was allowed back in Hogwarts. It was quite surprising to him that he was allowed to give his speech.
“Do you really mean all of that? You’re not just pulling my leg, are you?” Harry says starring into Draco’s eye trying to study his expression.
‘Oh, come on Draco. Don’t you want to talk to me? No? Well, your loss. Just think about it. I do think that you are wasting your time, but I am not going to push it. I am sure you will see I am right sooner or later.’ And just as fast as the voice appeared, it was gone just as fast. Draco let out a sigh of relief and made his way to his next class. This wasn’t the first time that Draco had heard this voice. He heard it constantly, giving him advice on what he should do ever since he first came to Hogwarts. He only listened to the voice to make his father proud, but now he just tries to ignore it the best that he can.
Voldemort was reborn that night and Harry just barely managed to make it out of there alive. The Council is refusing to believe that “The one who shall not be named” had indeed returned.
Weasley… I am done with games. It is as I have said before, I really do want to change whether you believe it or not,” Draco stated after a few moments. Draco was sounding rather emotional by the end of his statement. He really just wanted someone outside of his group to see that he really wants to try to be good. The thought of everyone forever hating Draco after he has changed makes Draco somewhat emotional.
“Draco? What are you doing up here?” Harry asked as he walks over to Draco. Draco quickly turns to look at Harry. Draco smiles happily.
Draco did send out letters to anyone who he may have hurt, but he knew he would have to apologize in person. He sent some letters to almost all the Weasleys, Hermione, and many others. He also made sure that he included in his letter to George how extremely sorry he was for George’s loss. There was one person he didn’t send a letter to. He didn’t send a letter to Harry because he just didn’t really know what to say.
Slowly after a lot of time, Harry and Draco become really close. Ron and Hermine were not okay with this new friendship but any time they tried to bring it up with Harry, he would get really mad. “I’m an adult, I can make decisions for myself of who I should hang out with it. You guys are like family to me. Just please give him a chance, at least for me,” Harry was always saying something along that line whenever Hermine or Ron would protest Harry spending time with Draco.
Everything after that went by so quickly. Many of the Death Eaters quickly fled from the crime while others were already held at wand-point. With the number of Death Eaters that quickly left the scene, the number that did stay were outnumbered. There were some that tried to point their wands to continue the fight, but their wands were quickly knocked out of their hands. Everyone was taken in and was questioned and many of them put on trial.
Harry had his first boyfriend, and his boyfriend was a player…
“Harry? Is something the matter?” Draco asked as he raises his brow in a questioning manner. “Something on your mind?”
“What if it was of my own doing? What would you say then?” Harry asked. He was mainly asking this because he is genially interested in what Draco’s response would be.
This conversation was just making Draco angrier by the second, but he kept his cool. “You couldn’t get Harry back even if you tried,” Draco said with a smirk. “So, have fun not being as popular—oh and by the way, having Harry being your only claim to fame is rather pathetic if you ask literally anyone. I’ll be off to class now.” Without another word, Draco headed off to class. He was late and almost got detention, but he managed to talk his way out of it.
But Draco wasn’t listening to his father’s words any more. All he saw was Harry, nodding. He took Harry’s hand, lacing their fingers together, then led the way up the stairs from the garden to the hall leading to his tower. Once they’d reached the sanctuary of the stairs leading up inside his tower, he pulled Harry close.
The shift in mood was enough to unsettle Draco's emotions, so he nodded, no longer able to meet Harry's eyes.
“Right.” He pulled Draco into a kiss before both men, who each glowered at the sight, but neither one said anything. Satisfied, Harry pulled back and turned to Sirius. “Lead the way, Padfoot.”
Uncertain, Draco watches him, his gaze wary. “Start what, Potter?”
“Look…It’s…I’m still trying to figure this out. But…I wanted…I mean…I promised you I’d be here. So I came. But…maybe it was a bad idea, Draco.”
“He’s just enjoying himself, Sirius. Honestly.” Harry sighed, and continued to scratch at his head. “It’s too bad we can’t take him with us. I bet the Prince would love a pet dragon.”
“Well…no. But…I haven’t. I don’t want to hurt you, Draco.”
"If you think me a fool, boy, do continue to pretend. You fool no one with that innocent act."
“No. It wasn’t. Until I saw you out here…it’s been horrible.”
"Perhaps you missed the charges?" He couldn't believe Harry would do this. Surely Harry, of all people, knew Draco deserved his place in Azkaban.
Draco nodded. "Father doesn't like me to play with other boys most of the time. Only the sons of his friends." He made a face. " I don't like them very much." He tilted his head. "You seem much nicer. And more fun." He tugged on Harry's hand and pulled him into the yard.
The annoyed look turned even darker. “And I should care why, exactly?” Potter asked.
Harry blinked. “No, sire. The dragon…he
“How much longer are you going to keep this up, knowing that I will never agree? That I will never want you…”
Though Draco had never given the idea any thought at all, having assumed he would never be able to find someone to marry, he answered almost without thought. “Of course they will share the ruling of this country with me. What use is a spouse who only sits there and looks pretty?”
“Everyone in my family must earn their keep,” Potter said to him with a smirk.
I could talk to, even if nothing else…”
“You certainly seemed popular,” Harry said softly, a note in his voice that Draco had never heard before.
"Draco—"
Lucius watched this interaction with interest and not a small bit of worry. He had hoped to teach his son a lesson, but perhaps he had gone too far? Still, it was too late to back down now. “Very well, Potter. I will have a wagon prepared. Food and gifts as befitting the heir. And when the time comes…”
“Yeah.” Harry looked at Draco. “Won’t they?”
"I can't hurt you here. The spells in the room prevent it. What have you got to lose? If I'm lying, what's the worst that will happen? Nothing. To you."
Draco shook his head. "No. It's just… I remembered something."
It helped. He was able to keep his mind busy, and focus on something other than how bored he was.
“She will if everyone holds up their part, Pansy. Now, are you going to help us, or…?” He let the threat dangle, knowing anything she could think of would be far more devastating than anything he might suggest.
“And you are?” Draco asked, a bit hesitant to offer his hand to this man.
"So you don't… I mean you wouldn't?"
“You’ll be a gorgeous bride in whatever you wear,” Harry tells her. And yet, his voice is flat when he responds. He does not seem happy at this coming wedding they are speaking of. Should not every young man who is to marry his school days sweetheart be pleased?
The tone of voice made his host's identity all too clear now, even if he hadn't guessed before, but Draco ignored that for more important things. "Did I look for a way to use it against you? Did I call you Potter again? Never. I wanted you here. To talk to. To get to know you. As much as you'd let me. Regardless. I don't care if you're Longbottom or Weasley… or someone I don't know. I just…" Draco felt the panic rising in his chest, filling his throat. "I just wanted to become… friends."
If only he didn't this interminable wait. But then, he'd never been highly placed in Voldemort's circle. His visibility was the only reason he was here.
?" he asked, horrified.
Draco turned to glower at him once more. "He didn’t know you in the dream, Potter."
"Of course not," Draco sneered. "Because you'd have to admit I might actually be something other than evil, and that is something you'd never be able to do."
Draco nodded, not wanting to show how the affiliation upset him now. "Yes. My…several Death Eaters entered Hogwarts because of it."
“I…I don’t…” Seeing Harry’s face fall at the word, Draco swallowed thickly. He hadn’t met that. He squeezed Harry's hands and nodded instead. “I think so.”
to seeing Potter again. It was ridiculous. He didn’t miss the git. He just wanted this over and done with. Now.
"The guy I spent all my time with at the parties." For the first time, Harry seemed uncertain. "I know we never got on ever. It was why I kept putting it off. And then Snape came in before I could tell you, and—"
Looking up, Draco met his friend’s eyes then nodded. “True.” Too bad he couldn’t just ask Harry and have done with it. But things between them were already strained and awkward from their difference in status. He didn’t want to hurt Harry for some whim of his own. “Still, maybe I’ll get lucky and find the person meant for me at one of these balls.” Unlikely to happen, but he had to let himself hope, didn’t he?
Draco's eyes dropped to the floor. "Maybe." He knew Harry's position would have been far worse. And he supposed nothing could have changed that. "But you made it through fine without my friendship. Better off for it, too."
He moved back to the centre of the room, his thoughts whirling now. Potter had tricked him. Made a fool of him! He’d been keeping him prisoner here, knowing the king would never allow it. Well, then. Draco would just have to find a way to tell the king as soon as he arrived. And then they’d see what would happen, wouldn’t they?
Until the day the house elf didn't come with the food. Harry did. Not his host, a shadow with no face or distinguishing features, but a Harry, who looked distinctly rumpled with dark circles under his eyes.
With only one more tale to go, Draco wonders if he can even get the words out any more. But Harry insists.
Draco kept glowering at him for a long moment, then gave it up for a lost cause. He nodded instead, then moved to pick up his wand. “Right. Let me out.”
The only time we see the Malfoy heir cave a little is at breakfast. When Malfoy arrives, he tries to sleep till noon, but Harry has always been an early riser. At first he tries to wake him by tapping on the door, but he soon learns that the smell of coffee and bacon will pull Draco from his bed far sooner than any request, however kind. Draco always comes to the table bleary-eyed and grumpy, but he always comes, and can any of us truly blame him?
Not that Draco had much to go on. Just this house, which was fairly generic, the shadowy figure he'd met when he'd tried the front door, and the fact they'd probably been on the side of Harry Potter, since they'd been given the chance to watch over him.
Everyone thought that dreams were meant to tell you something. But Draco couldn't afford to let himself believe that, because otherwise, he’d go insane. There was no way he could believe that having seven nights of dreams about Potter meant
Cedric did threaten that he was going to try and get Harry back, but that never ended up happening because he officially started dating Cho. He wasn’t a player anymore and was actually really happy with his relationship with Cho. He did end up apologizing to Harry and Draco and then left them alone except for when it came to getting help with some spells in the club; “Dumbledore’s Army.”
On Draco’s way to Potions, he got pulled by the arm, forcing Draco to turn and face who pulled his arm. The one who pulled Draco’s arm was Ron. Ron then grabbed Draco by the collar and pulled him closer. “I don’t know what you are up to, but we will find out. I don’t believe you for a second that you have changed… No matter how convincing it is…” Ron says as he glares into Draco’s eye.
Harry buried his face onto Draco’s shoulder. “Cedric—You were right…” Harry managed to say while he was muffled from hiding his face.
“I will do with you. I will help you convince them, and I will also be joining the club with you guys,” Draco says with a smile. “My dad literally asked me to become a Death Eater since The Dark Lord was back,” Draco pointed out.
“So, you got a week of detention? Did anything happen in there?” Draco asked as he studied Harry’s expressions. Harry got tense and it looked like he started sweating.
“Draco you have to be a Death Eater! I thought you of all wizards would want to see the mudbloods gone!” Lucius yelled out, his face turning red with anger.
“You like me too?! I had no idea! I didn’t even know that you were into dudes!” Harry blurted out without really thinking.
“I see… Well, how about you meet me on the quidditch field after practices and we can go do something to get your mind off things? I can already tell this year is going to be stressful so breaks from these stressful times are needed!” Cedric ruffled Harry’s already messy hair and smiled softly.
The rest is known. Harry grabbed onto the cup and was transported to Little Hangleton Graveyard. The same graveyard he was having nightmares about and the one that held Tom Riddle’s grave.
“Well, you know… how do you
about me? Like really
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry quickly apologized. “Hermione was just bringing something to my attention. She has helped come up with something we can do about the whole, Dark Lord thing,” Harry added.
It was Viktor Krum. He was under the Imperius Curse as he cast the Cruciatus Curse onto Cedric. Cedric fell to the ground in pain. It was a good thing though that he called Harry’s name because that caused Harry to spring to Cedric’s rescue. Cedric was saved by Harry, who stunned Krum, and reluctantly shot red sparks into the air to mark Krum's position, so that he could be retrieved from the maze. When knocking Krum out is when the pain stopped for Cedric.
“Do you like me
Harry was trying to control his tear as he went out looking for Draco. He knew that he would need to break up with Cedric as soon as he saw what Draco said was true. Harry just couldn’t face Ron or Hermione after what just happened, but he really wanted to see Draco. He wanted to apologize and tell him that he broke things off with Cedric, but the hard part was trying to find Draco in this massive school. He had to find him quickly since it was almost time to head off to his next class.
Draco was just hanging around in the Astronomy Tower hoping Harry would come by. He was doing this every day while Harry was away in detention, just waiting for him to come back. Draco was leaning against the railing looking out into the distance. Harry walked up the stair and was surprised to see Draco there. He was surprised that Draco didn’t turn to look to see who was coming up the stairs.
much is what I mean... Because I like you like that...” was all Draco said as he was blushing like crazy. He couldn’t believe that he actually just did that. Harry was in complete disbelief. He was shocked but also blushing like crazy.
It was quickly the next day and Draco was tired. He didn’t get much sleep last night as he was too busy overthinking what might happen. Draco got dressed in black pants, a white shirt, a gray sweater vest, and black shoes. He really didn’t have a colorful wardrobe so this would have to do. Looking in the mirror he was worried his hair would stand out too much. Draco combed through his hair with his fingers as his mother gently knocked on the door to Draco’s room. Draco turned and looked over at his mother who had slowly opened the door.
Draco and Harry begin to talk about anything and everything as they go over and sit on the picnic blanket that they always leave laid out on the ground. They smiled and had a few laughs as Draco was acting silly to get Harry to laugh. After a while they held hands and look out at the stars and Draco would occasionally kiss Harry’s cheek because he could and mostly because he liked to see Harry’s cute reaction. Harry's neck would tense up like a turtle going back in its shell while smiling. Draco would chuckle at this expression which would make Harry slightly upset and telling Draco to stop teasing him.
“I have already spread the idea around to some students, but they need to know if… Voldemort was even back or not. I say she should set up a little meeting somewhere outside of school to talk about it and see who will sign up. Ron and I will spread the word,” Hermione smiled as she looked over to Ron.
“What game are you playing,
D- ‘You seem to be doing better after what happened yesterday. How are you holding up?’
Cedric and his dad, Amos Diggory, did a lot of traveling so even if Harry were able to send Cedric a letter it was a low possibility that Cedric would answer it. That being that he would be so distracted that he would forget about the letters entirely. Any free time Cedric did have was watching Quidditch with his dad or socializing.
Harry was waiting for Draco at the Astronomy Tower. Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was going to be coming to meet him at the tower or not. Harry was starting to get nervous for some reason. This has never happened before. Harry was normally really irritated to see Draco, but once they became friends, he was happy to see him and get to hang out with him. This time was different than the rest. He was nervous and was sweety with a knot forming in his stomach the longer he had to wait for Draco to get there. Harry was getting so nervous he was thinking about dipping, but he is the one who made the plans to he didn’t want to disappoint Draco if he does show up. Harry closed his eyes and took a long deep sign, trying to calm himself. A light shined off in the corner, catching Harry’s attention. Harry opens his eyes and snaps his head and looks over at who was making that light.
Harry was nervous for the entire class period and didn’t know what he was going to do. He wasn’t even sure what he was going to say. He tried to come up with something but, nothing came to mind. Draco tried to talk with Harry and the same with Ron, but Harry simply could not hear them as he was stuck in his thoughts. He just mindlessly went through class doing what he was told or doing what he was reading in his potions book while making some mistakes.
“I can see why you think I would be a good teacher, but I was talking about you, Harry! You are the one who performed that one big light from the difficult Patronus charm that fought off hundreds of Dementors. You have a lot of experience with using defense spells than any of us,” Hermione pointed out.
“I asked a few favors and got some food for us without Hermione and Ron knowing. They think I am up in my room coming up with a plan with everything that is going on. I do need to think some things through and form something like a plan, but that can wait a bit. Oh, and they also think that I am catching up on the homework that I literally can’t do over the summer thanks to the people I have to stay with outside of Hogwarts,” Harry says with a bit of a worried face about the whole plan-making that he needs to do.
Harry finished his food before speaking, “Draco, I am so sorry. I had no idea that you were dealing with all of that at home. I kind of thought that you were always a jerk because that was just who you are from your father, not that you were doing it to get his attention and make him proud. You really didn’t have to tell me all of that, I didn’t mean to pry into your life.”
“Says you, you have gorgeous bright grey eyes,” Harry quickly pointed out.
“You really need to stop running away from your issues,” Harry joked while smiling at Draco. “And to answer your question I didn’t mean it in a bad way. What I mean was, I know people will look at us weird and think it is wrong for two males to be together like this, but I can’t help that I need you like that.” Harry was blushing and starting to get really awkward. “What I mean to say is… I like you Draco… Like, a lot.” Harry chuckled softly.
For Harry it was Ron and for Cedric, it was still Cho. Now if Harry had any jealous bone in his body, he would have questioned the two of their relationship with each other, but Harry just brushed it off. He was way more focused on wanting to save everyone when he realized his two friends were there along with a first-year kid and his old crush.
years that were in Ravenclaw. The Golden Trio kept a very close eye on Draco any time that they could. Nearing the end of that week people started becoming conformable with Draco being there.
On the way to dinner one night Draco was alone and running late to get to the Great Hall. He was rushing trying to make it in time so there would still be food left for him. He just needed to pass a handful of room and he was at the Great Hall, that was until Harry got in the way.
“After everything that I have said and done… I am not surprised. I don’t expect you to ever forgive me,” Draco says with a sad look in his eyes and light hurt expression on his face. Ron was stunned and Draco used that to his advantage. Draco gently placed his hands on Ron’s before removing Ron’s hands from Draco’s Collar. “I have little hope the Weasleys will forgive me, but I still have hope.” And will that, Draco took a step back from Ron and turned and walked into Potions class.
“Sorry, sorry. Um… well, people in my house have been making fun of me about… something and it has just made me paranoid of what others could be saying about me, or us, without knowing,” Draco lightly chewed on the bottom of his lip waiting for Harry’s reaction.
“What are you talking about? There is nothing wrong with my hand,” Harry says as he shows Hermione his right hand. Hermione rolled her eyes and grabs Harry’s left wrist and held it up. The sleeve of this sweatshirt fell revealing the scars from his hand.
“Wh-what? Really?” Harry was smiling, he couldn’t believe his ears. All Harry could do was smile. He was in a playful mood, so Harry decided to press further. “What am I to you? Like a friend, a crush~?” Harry couldn’t contain his smile; he wasn’t being serious but Draco being quiet while his face turning bright red said everything yet Harry was too blind to notice the meaning of Draco’s blush.
At dinner, something had snapped in Hermione. Since seeing what happened to Harry, Hermione had an idea of what she can do.
“There is just something that I have been wondering… I don’t know how to say this, so I am just going to come out and ask it. Why have you changed so much since last year?” Harry looked back into Draco's eyes, trying to read Draco’s expressions.
“Well, yeah I do—wait did you just say that you like me back?!” Draco smiled happily.
Ron eventually agreed to it and the conversation ended up changing to something different and Harry started to space out. He wasn’t sure how to teach someone spells to defend himself. He started thinking back to all the advice he got for how to perform the Patronus charm. Harry looks over at the Slytherin table, by the door and sees Draco just starring at him. Harry remembered that they are meant to be going to the Astronomy Tower after dinner. Harry quickly nodded to Draco and turn to Hermione and Ron, quickly excuse himself.
“Looking for me?” Cedric chuckled.
Cedric and Harry talked for a little bit longer before Cedric went back to his table. Harry sat down and could bring his full attention to his food. He didn’t get to eat much since he was busy looking for Cedric or talking with Cedric. He had to eat quickly though because everyone had to head to their common room soon.
Harry was extremely shocked; this was his first kiss. There were no longer any butterflies in his stomach as they were going crazy like rockets. His heart was pounding so loud he could no longer hear his thoughts. As soon as Harry registered what was going on, he kisses Cedric back. If Harry didn’t know he was at least slightly gay before, kissing Cedric confirmed that he was. Harry quickly got ahead of himself and asked Cedric to be his first boyfriend. Cedric chuckled and nodded.
“Okay. We will give you one week. Just one. If you act at all suspicion, then we will bring the suspicious activity to the headmistress's attention and she will deal with you.” Harry suddenly spoke and then quickly walked over to Draco before whispering in his ear. “don’t disappoint me, Draco.” And with that Harry headed off in the direction to his common room quickly followed by Hermione and an upset Ron. It was obvious to anyone that Ron really wanted the conversation to end in an unfair duel of 3 vs. 1.
Instead of Azkaban Draco was under house arrest for the whole summer, the mail going in and out of the Malfoy house was monitored, his wand was taken away, and Draco was also required to attend lessons with a therapist. Draco had to go see a therapist once a week for the whole summer. At the end of the summer, the therapist would be one of the people to help decide if Draco was ready to be released from house arrest and was allowed to go back to Hogwarts.
Draco was one of the first people on the Hogwarts express. No one seemed to recognize him, so his outfit was working. Once on the train, he got into a booth and changed into his Slytherin uniform. He then waited for a friend to come to join him, but he was really waiting to see Harry Potter. He was wondering how Harry was doing and if his summer went well after the war. Draco was starting to wish he had sent Harry a letter, but it was too late.
“Are you Draco? You look like hell,” Harry says will a worried look on his face. Draco could tell that Harry was trying to hide the fact that he was worried but was failing.
“Don’t you start with that! That’s bollocks and you know it!” Harry yelled before taking a few breaths to calm himself down. His expression lightened and he was now calm. “I’m sorry for yelling at you… I just want you to let me in Draco. Or anyone for that matter.” Harry paused for a moment. “Is that what you are scared of? Letting people in?” Harry walked over to Draco till they were about 2 feet away from each other.
“Well, I would be really concerned and ask you if everything was okay and if there was anything that you wanted to talk about—but with the way you are looking at me right now, that is not the case at all so, spill. Tell me everything. I promise I won’t get too mad,” Draco was concerned regardless but also upset at the same time. Draco then realized what he said and realized that there was something that he left out. “Just know that I am not pressuring you to tell me. I completely understand if you do not want to tell me something like this. Just know that I am here for you. When you are ready to talk about it, I will listen to it and try not to interrupt it too much just because I know I will get at least a little bit mad,” Draco added.
There was a long moment of silence. It was a nice comfortable silence. Harry was thinking of how much of a crush he has on Draco. While Draco on the other hand was thinking if it was time or not to confess his feelings. It had been a long enough time since Harry’s breakup, so Draco found it a safe time to ask.
Draco looks at his mother and then down at the beanie. This is just what he was looking for, but he really didn’t have any hats and a hood was out of the question. He takes the hat into his hand and turns to the mirror and puts it on. “This is perfect, just what I was needing, thanks, mother.” Draco smiles at his reflection. He was in the perfect outfit to blend in. Nothing was standing out that would someone think that this was Draco. “It is getting time for me to leave; I am going to head out to see if I can get on the train before many other people. I’ll write to you when I can and tell you how things are going.” Draco gave his mother a quick hug before getting all of his things and making his way to King's Cross Station.
“Harry, we need to start something for the next war that is coming up,” Hermione states.
“I am happy I have you too. I will do what I can to protect you in this war.
“I don’t want to ruin this wonderful night but there is something that I would like to ask you about. Is that okay?” Harry asked quietly. He felt bad but he wanted to know about the whole Death Eater thing.
“Well, Harry, will you od me the honor of being my boyfriend?” Draco asked and then quickly added, “If it is not too soon from your last relationship that is.”
for attention.  Draco was the first of the Slytherin table to excuse himself and headed for his room. On his way, he was stopped by none other than the Golden Trio. He was expecting this to happen eventually he just wasn’t expecting it till before morning classes.
The guy Cedric was kissing cleared his throat. “So, I guess that means you are single now. So, what do you say—” The guy was quickly cut off, interrupted by Cedric.
“Yeah, sounds great. I will meet you back here after dinner. Just give me a signal when you are heading to the Tower and I will follow a bit after you leave so no one gets any ideas that we are up to something funny,” Harry smiled at the thought of someone thinking that he and Draco were a couple. Harry no longer questioned if he had a crush on Draco anymore. Harry didn’t know how to hide it, so he was just acting like his normal self. The only thing that Harry ever tried to hide was any time he was about to start blushing, but because it was normally chilly in the Tower Draco just thought Harry’s face was red from the cold not that it could be something else.
“Um, Harry can I ask you something simple?” Draco asks but as soon as the words left his mouth, he started to get nervous. Harry tilted his head, interested in what Draco had to say but didn’t say anything. Draco took a deep break before continuing, “How to feel about me? Like what do you think about me?”
D- ‘That’s good, I hope. Well, if you need anyone to talk to you know where to look for me :)’
Harry and Cedric made eye contact and smiled at each other. Cedric said bye to his group of friends and went over to Harry. “You look great! Green was a good choice,” Cedric says as he smiles brightly.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but he knows when a response is not wanted. He signed and left without saying another word. He was walking back to the changing room muttering himself. He really did want to go and practice quidditch. Yet, his mind was somewhere else the whole time, and the captain repeatedly had to tell Draco to focus, but it was no use.
The person to take Draco’s place in “Inquisitorial Squad” who ends up catching Harry was non-other than Pansy. She wanted to bust them for taking Draco away from her. Draco on the other hand was the one to get any details on what the Slytherins were up to, but they still managed to get caught because of Cho getting the truth serum and spilling the beans. The bad dreams that Harry has do still have Cedric in it but more of the cheating since he didn’t die in the 4th book.
Over the course of the next few weeks Harry and Draco would spend lunch together and some days when Hermione and Ron are being extra clingy to Harry, they would spend Dinner together up in the Astronomy Tower. There were just some days where Harry just couldn’t slip away from the two to go hang out with Draco all alone. Draco would chat with Hermione and Ron whenever they had a class together along with Draco’s other friends who were in Slytherin, but Draco would want to chat with Harry outside of class.
Draco went to his room and quickly got everything that he needed for school packed away. He had sent out someone to go get his book for him as he didn’t want to interact with people just yet. He really didn’t want to get in a dual with someone and get put back under house arrest again. He was getting excited to see some of his friends. Luckily for Draco, he didn’t have to wait long as he had to be on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow. He got his letter around noon and he spent the rest of the day preparing what he was going to say and do tomorrow. He even planned his outfit for tomorrow. He needed to wear something that wouldn’t make his hair pop out in a crowd and a hood would be too suspicious.
“Well look to is back from the dead! Where have you been Pottah? I was starting to get worried,” Draco says as he crosses his arms. Even though they have been talking and hanging out constantly for a whole month at this point, Draco still calls Harry by his last name mostly out of habit.
Over the course of a week, Harry started to pay more attention to the things Cedric was doing. He saw just how “friendly” he was acting to some of the guys and girls. Cedric mostly did a lot of flirting with Cho and this one guy who was a Slytherin. This broke Harry’s heart, but he just had to wait a little longer. He wanted to see Cedric kiss someone before he would believe it in his heart that Cedric was cheating. Sadly, Harry got what he was looking for.
Harry wore a robe of bottle green that went well with his eyes. Cedric went with a traditional black tuxedo for the dance. There were 3 groups of people at the Ball. The first group was looking over at Cedric when he entered the room to see who he went to the dance with. The second group was looking over at Harry once he and Ron separated so Ron could go find where his date was. Some thought for a while that Harry and Ron went together, but once they saw Ron with his actual date, they realized Harry was going with someone else. Intrigued they watched to see who was going with the infamous Harry Potter. The third group was of people who didn’t notice nor did they care.
Within that one-week, Draco did what he could to help people. Draco even stopped a few Slytherins from playing bloody horrible pranks on some 1
Harry walks up to a group made up of a Slytherin and 2 Hufflepuffs. He dried his eyes and keeps a straight face knowing if he showed emotion the people, he was talking to, would make a face of them being concerned. That would make Harry break down into tears and he did not want that. He didn’t like looking vulnerable to others as he didn’t want to be made fun of.
While Draco was still in earshot, he heard Ron loudly sigh, “Bloody Hell,” before hearing his footsteps leave down the hall. Draco took his seat and laid his head down on his desk. Draco’s heart was pounding, but not because he was crushing on Ron, that wasn’t the case at all. Draco’s heart was pounding because he was so scared that he was going to get into a duel that would end him being sent to detention or worst
The day Draco was released from custody there was an outrage. People wanted Draco to be locked away, like his father. Draco was let go because it was seen that he was under the imperius curse. Technically he was not under the imperius curse, instead, he just did what he could to not make his father angry. Since Lucius Malfoy worked for the dark lord Draco was, in a way, forced to work for the Dark Lord as well.
“Yeah! I didn’t see you get off the train!” Harry says as he quickly stands up and turns his body to hug Cedric. “How was your summer?” Harry had the biggest smile on his face. Harry was really happy to see Cedric.
Draco smiled softly. “of course, I’m not doing anything important right now. What exactly are you 5 having trouble with?” Draco asked moving his broom to the side. He tilted his head slightly as he studied the group's body language. He has gotten really good at understanding others by how they present themselves. This way he learns what not to do or say to make others uncomfortable as they get used to him being nice. It’s mostly just him trying not to joke about anything ‘evil’ as others still take him seriously even when he is obviously joking.
“Y-you’re joking, I-I didn’t do anything!” Draco bit his lower lip and looked away from Harry’s eyes. Draco was wondering how he could have found out.
“Well, um… Why didn’t you say anything sooner?” Harry asked after a little bit of hesitation.
Harry was confused and thought that Draco was trying to pull a prank on him. After weeks of Draco chatting with Harry when he could in and out of class in a friendly manner, Harry started to believe Draco was turning good. It was a surprise, but a nice one to experience. Draco was now one less person to worry about this school year and Harry was okay with that. Just means less stress for him on one thing.
“What have they been saying?” Harry was getting visibly angry.
“I’m all ears, what is the matter? Tell me.” Harry quickly said while putting his hands on Draco’s shoulder and gently squeezing them.
“Of course, Sirius. I’ve been here with Draco the entire time.”
Still…he had to get some help. People would start looking for him soon, and when they found a dragon in his place…better to not be here. All he could do was hope he found someone who would at least try to understand him before running away.
"I was insulted and ignored…" Potter said indignantly.
Draco jumped up, pulling his hand from Potter’s grip, horrified. “No! You…no!” And with that, he ran from the room.
"So?" Draco answered. "I didn't know what the magic would do, but I knew if he got me angry enough, it would do
When he woke, it was morning. He could barely move from his sore muscles, and his stomach was demanding food—
Draco blinked. She wouldn't punish them? Before he could say anything, though, Harry was tugging at his sleeve. Draco glanced at him, then nodded. As they left the hall, he shot a last look at Snape, the man fuming at not being given the chance to crucify them all.
But as days pass, see the news articles appear. Each is greeted with greater temper by the Malfoy heir, and soon he can stand it no longer. Watch as he dresses to kill—he so wishes it could be literally, but he knows that he cannot.
"Remember what, Malfoy? Are you saying you met me? Trust me, I'd remember meeting a prat like you."
Narcissa sighed. “Very well. There is one last test I would like to do, and if she passes…”
Draco huffed. “And what is that supposed to mean?”
"Because now we both have a chance. To be something more than what people expected us to be. Maybe even to be friends?" He held out his hand, and now, the bitter memory of a similar moment on the first train ride to Hogwarts tempered with a fonder memory.
Dumbledore chuckled. “Well, when one is summoned…” He smiled. “And things are in order once more in Gryffindor?”
“Oh, come on, Moony. I know you don’t know her, but Narcissa grabs every opportunity to control the situation, just like my dear mother. The poor boy’s doomed.”
“You leave that to me. I have only one request.”
“Never mind. Leave. What do I care?”
Slowly, Harry returned the smile. "Yeah? So that's why you want me to stay?"
When they turned into the Great Hall, Draco glanced back at Snape. This would be worse than hed possibly thought. And he'd never managed to find out who his mystery guy's identity. It wasn't fair.
Draco slumped by the fountain. What was he going to do? Even if he’d wanted to explain to his parents how this had happened…it was still his fault. After all, if he’d done what they’d wanted, he’d never have been out here in the first place. But he wouldn’t even be able to do that. The first glimpse of him they got, they’d likely try to kill him.
The king nodded. "Two brothers and a sister. I could have someone collect them, if you would like?"
At that, Narcissa’s eyebrows rose. “Indeed? I…apologize. I had hoped the mattresses…”
Harry turned back to Draco. “Are you…human?”
When he'd arrived, he'd been taken to one of the interrogation chambers, but after only a few questions, they decided he knew very little, so he'd spent the rest of his time in a cell, waiting his turn to be told he would spend the rest of his life in Azkaban.
King Lucius scowled over his son’s shoulder. “So…King Harry…”
“You’re okay,” he shrugged.
"I wish it didn't have to be like this, Draco. Maybe… if things were different…"
“You said that if I could ever think of anything you could do to repay me for helping you and your family, I should let you know. I’m letting you know, Draco. I want to come live in the Manor with you.”
Draco went rigid, recognizing the voice immediately. “What. Are. You. Doing. Potter?” he asked, trying to keep his voice calm.
My suggestion was accepted gleefully. After all, he only ever managed to get one spy into Hogwarts. This would give him as much access as he wished, any time he wished. But it was not enough for him, even despite being a great advantage. No, he had another task for me. One that chilled me to the core—Kill Dumbledore.
Draco almost nodded, but really, he just wanted this over. “Look…I should…go.” He realized now, though, that he didn’t want to. But he wasn’t going to be the one to make the first move. Not this time.
“So I’ll have something made for you, then. Please, Harry. Please come?”
"Yes." The word stuck in his throat, but he forced it out.
He caught Harry watching him speculatively. "Maybe."
So what could Draco do? Confront Potter, of course. After all, the git didn’t seem to be leaving on his own…
“I admit, I…failed to explain myself, but would you have listened?”
Draco was sure, even despite the dark, the flush on his cheeks was quite visible now. “Yes…but not just,” he assured him quickly before Harry could pull away entirely. “Harry…There’s never been anyone else I could even think of that way. I just…didn’t want to hurt you. It wouldn’t be fair to you.” He sighed, his tone bitter when he spoke again. “Father would never allow me to make you my consort.”
For lack of anything else to do, he stretched out on his side, turning his back to Harry, and dozed off.
“I’m fine, Potter. Don’t worry about me. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?” Potter was correct, of course, but even so, Draco wasn’t about to tell him that.
“Yes. Though we are a bit concerned that they seem too friendly already. I mean…Harry doesn’t even know him! Just…this dragon. That’s not the same thing.”
“Right. Maybe I should drag you to the king? See what he has to say about it?”
They ate their supper in silence, and then both went to their separate mattresses. Draco pretended to fall asleep, but listened for Potter’s snores to begin, then sat up to watch him. What did Potter think to prove, doing this to him? And why did he think he could get away with it?
By the time Harry's replacement came, Draco was certain he'd never get another chance. "Harry, wait…"
Draco had to bite his lip at that, and it took all his willpower to keep the blush from spreading too far across his face.
“I know. It’s too much. I tried to tell them I wasn’t going to go in, but…they insisted,” he shrugged, looking awkwardly embarrassed.
Harry nodded slowly. “All right.”
When Potter knocked on the door at ten, Draco was wearing not only pyjamas and underwear, but also his thickest winter robe. He pulled open the door and waved Potter in, but the other man stood there, just staring at Draco. “Aren’t you…a bit warm?”
“Ron…what are you…”
As Draco felt his cheeks heat even more, he stood and moved to the window again. He was hardly going to discuss his sexual preferences with Potter, after all. “Does it matter?”
"Not during our lunch break. They might not even notice, then."
. He did. And it did."
“Good. 'Cause I have other things I’d rather be doing than talking to you, Malfoy.” Potter opened the door wider, waving Draco in.
“And he wishes to see us in the gardens?”
face. Was it truly Potter? If not, who was it? Were they handsome? He imagined they were. Of course, any attempt to imagine his benefactor, the hair turned black, the eyes green, the face kind.
Well, let us turn a bit and we will see the reason. Look, there is Harry. And see who that is on his arm? Why it’s the very Ginny who wanted so badly to get his attention!
Draco held his breath, but nodded slowly. What if Harry said no? Of course, if he did…he somehow knew that he’d be stuck in this form forever more.
Oh, this was a bad foot to start off on. “And yet you’re here. Something must have convinced you to do so?”
Blaise’s lips twitched for a second, then he bowed low. “Highness. I have brought you a princess to become your bride.”
Raising an eyebrow, Lucius stepped out of the carriage. “You seem in excellent spirits. I expected…well…different than this.”
“Yes!” Still, he couldn’t quite pull away any more, either.
Finally! An answer he could use to prod them in the right direction. Draco shook his head.
Many of the students bagun to pair off. The couples weren't exclusively within their year or house, either, but across house lines. And the couples were not within the three "good" houses, either. Many of the Slytherins had found themselves girl- or boyfriends from other houses. Even Draco.
Still, lunch was a long ways away, and before even the first hour was up, Draco was certain he would collapse without
“They’re different each time.”
He was beginning to fall into a truly panicked state when Harry alit on the windowsill once more, the late afternoon light lighting him from behind and making him glow, and for a moment, Draco just stared at him, wondering if he were simply a hallucination. Then he spoke. "Sorry it took so long, Draco. He had to make a potion. But it should work…and he gave me a few others…"
