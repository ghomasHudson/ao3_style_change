-Folds his paper and tosses it on his trunk, before holding his head in his hands.
He jumped when a pop startled him, and he groaned - frantically trying to grab the damn radio before it ... to late!
“You both coming?” Neville ‘s voice reached their ears.
No, he would reply in the morning and not mention Malfoy at all.
That was his last lesson for the day. He tidied up the class room with a wave of his wand, scooped up the test papers and the book he had just finished into a box, and then retreated to his private rooms.
Harry sat down opposite Draco, and he started looking over the parchments. He had been corresponding back and forth with Narcissa through Draco for the past five weeks, and he’d learnt a lot about Draco and Narcissa’s life with Lucius. He felt sorry for them both, but he knew his sympathy wouldn’t be welcome so he never offered it.
He chuckled at the memory, and then suddenly felt the heat in his cheeks when the images of Draco luring him into the forest naked returned.
Harry laughed with tears in his eyes.
-Draco staring back at Harry, and sneers at him.
“I’ll see you down there,” Harry was speaking with Madam Pomfrey, “I just need to have a word with Mr Bartlett.”
Harry laughed – such a pure addicting sound – as smoke filled the air between them. A tall hat with hanging baubles appeared, two mice squeaked as they ran off, and other crackers ‘banged’ around them with similar effects – only with different items appearing. Of course, Harry put the ridiculous hat on, still chuckling away.
-Saturday 7th November. Harry bumps into a sneering Draco in the halls, and Harry drops his wand.
Draco was telling himself that one more helping would be okay, it would be his last, and he just couldn’t resist one more bowl of that rich, irresistible, homemade, chocolate log. The moist treat was enough to melt his mind, to take him away from reality … and to temporarily remove Potter from his thoughts. He picked up the knife, and as soon as he went to cut off another slice… the yule log vanished.
“Right!” Harry stood up straight and clapped his hand together. “Summer essays please!”
Draco spun around to face young Hufflepuff girl. Miss Payne looked like a deer caught in a Lumos, her face pale, her breathing ragged, and her eyes filled with such fear. He quickly started to approach her but she suddenly fled the room.
recover. It was foolish, to be as worried as he was; the virus wasn’t life threatening to a powerful wizard like Draco, and he would be more then okay with Poppy looking after him. He was just being unreasonably protective of the man, and seeing him so vulnerable in that childlike state… it must have just triggered his foolishness.
It was true, Harry had come through for her – something he was eternally grateful to Harry for - and his mother was planning on sending the divorce certificate to her ex-husband as a New Year gift. Lucius had no idea that Narcissa would be a Malfoy no more, and Draco suspected that his father would not be happy. He didn’t care what Lucius thought anymore, his mother deserved happiness after what that bastard put her through... what he’d put them both through. Lucius Malfoy was no longer his father, and even though he would be keeping his Malfoy name, he wanted nothing to do with the man that had sired him.
you torn yourself apart that year. It was a war, there were more than two sides Draco, and you were in the grey – being backed into a corner. Only someone that found pride and enjoyment in their orders from that bastard deserved to be punished. Only those that feel remorse and guilt over the thing they were forced to do, deserve absolution.”
Harry sighed as realisation hit him. “Have you possibly eaten something of the joke variety Mr Bartlett?” Harry asked, thinking of the Weasley Wizard Wheezes ‘Amazing Animal Assortments.’ It was a product like ‘Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans’, but instead of flavours… you’d be forced to speak like a random animal for at least twenty minutes.
Sirius dying at Bellatrix's hands, then changing to Dobby's death.
Draco: "I'm sorry okay. It's just ... I can't use apparition."
And you make me fight for you, you, you
Harry sees Draco in the Hallway - they get confrontational and start shouting.
“It’s never happened before. I think the students keep me distracted enough. Besides, I think one of the students would notice and start shouting, don’t you?” Harry tersely explained.
-They share a kiss, before Draco pulls away - something in his hand.
-His younger self vanishes, just as Draco's hand passes through the air.
Hermione went on to explain Easter, and surprisingly her audience were very interested. Seamus, Dean, and Neville also turned to listen. When she finished Draco slipped away.
was among them.
Harry: "Tosser!"
-On the horror roller coaster, Draco screams clinging onto Ron - who is also screaming and paralyzed by the spiders with red eyes.
Harry’s hand lay gently over Draco’s wand, slowly pushing it down until Draco finally slouched and started sobbing.
“My Gryffindors. Why am I not surprised?” Harry shook his head and sighed. “What did they do this time?”
“Sorry sir!” Alexander apologised.
Harry poured out another glass of whisky – of liquid courage as he had dubbed it, and as he poured another one for Draco’s sake, he decided that in order to gain Draco’s trust and encourage him to open up, maybe he could be honest about the soul fragments Tom Riddle had stashed away. If nothing else, it might prove that he did in fact, understand enough.
Harry: "Better! It looks good!"
Harry: "Don't do this again Draco!"
-She points her quill at him.
- Draco surprising Harry for his 24th birthday. All their friends and family there.
Midnight was rapidly closing in by the time Harry had return to his room, had a shower, and climbed into bed with mug of hot chocolate. He twisted the warm mug in his hands as he thought back over the last several hours.
The room they were in had unlabeled boxes stacked everywhere, and some stacks reached the ceiling. There were a few abandoned classroom tables, and various other things. It wasn't that small, but it was so full of stuff that there wasn't much room left to move. Draco's apple-minty breath wafted into his face along with his scent of old books, and an addictive blend of blood orange, coffee, and broom stick wood. He found himself inhaling deeply through his noes, thinking how it caressed his olfactory senses and made him dizzy. When Draco spoke again, Harry noticed him almost blushing - he looked... embarrassed?
“Indeed.” Draco smiled warmly, taking Harry’s hand in his own rather tightly.
After dinner, Draco waited in his potion’s classroom for Miss Briana Payne’s remedial lesson to begin, along with Mr Silas Avery’s detention.
“This isn’t something I share lightly Draco. Apart from Kingsley, only Ron and Hermione have this knowledge. It’s fucking difficult to share too – it’s a pivoting factor to my worst nightmares. I don’t talk about them, not even to Ron or Hermione.”
Draco: "It's okay Harry, you didn't know. You're right though ... I should have just told you. I let my pride and ego stop me."
“Please, excuse me!” Draco politely excused himself from the table. He left the Great Hall, forcing himself to walk normally, but once he was in the corridor he walked briskly to his private chambers.
“What are you up to?” Harry blurted out before he could arrange his thoughts. He didn’t mean to sound accusing, but Malfoy had befuddled his brain. Before he could rephrase his question - or take it back and just accept his apology like he should have done in the first place - Malfoy had opened his mouth.
-Images of
“What if we got you some honey?” Harry asked, trying to pacify a childish Draco Malfoy.
Harry: "Why would I break up with Ginny? She never cheated on me, that was an act to get my attention. And, how do you know that?"
Harry could see the way Draco stared at him, could almost see the wheels turning. If he was right, Draco had understood his words perfectly but was now at a crossroad between Padfoot and himself. Harry wanted to tell Draco who he was, but he felt the blond needed more time to realise his own feelings first. Harry however, knew that he was falling in love and that scared him because of who his heart was choosing. It was a comfort that they could spend so much time in each other’s company, but the real test would come later once Draco’s illusion of Padfoot had been destroyed. He just hoped that Draco would be happy that he was Padfoot, and not distraught over the revelation.
The terrored bleats lend half the worth.
Ron gets sad.
Actually, the time spent in a solitary cell with unlimited reading materials hadn’t been terrible at all.  Even the Oubliette had its charms.  And he eventually got to volunteer some in the infirmary.  Emptying his brain into Pensieve vials with Robards had been the lowlight of the day for months, but not intolerable.
A new orb materialized from the center of her formless shape.  It was a perfect, smooth sphere made of new glass.  The colors swirling through it were mostly white and brown, but rosettes of red bloomed under his fingertips as he accepted it.
Draco’s breath shuddered in as he rested, feeling the pressure inside him.  His cock felt painfully hard below the teasing satin, and any movement would only urge his body to a faster climax.
“He was… I dunno.  Kind of spacey.  Bruised up, though, Har.”  Ron leaned back on the futon, and Harry vaguely wondered if he should have Scourgified it after having sex on it.
“And Harry, similar for you.  On the hunt for a lucky witch?” Connie asked, not looking up.
If you’re going to throw a conception carnival, you should expect to dish on some details.  Positions, frequency, overall rating of the fucking on a ten-point scale, because it would be lovely to know, as an adult, that you are the product of a spectacular fuck.
“Cissy…” Lucius warned, taking out the forms.
———————————
“He was supposed to tell you to come see me.  And that I’m married,” he replied, turning back to look down onto the field.  “And not to
Their meal concluded and she settled herself in the lone armchair in the living room across from the kitchen. Ron followed her, claiming the end of the sofa nearest her.
A wide grin and a half-snorted laugh from Draco startled and embarrassed him.  “First off, Potter.  No, you couldn’t.  Not if I didn’t want you to.  Not anymore.”
Perching on the railing of a long pier, they hooted their conclusion. He scanned the pier, the walk leading up to it from some shops, and saw no one. It was still rather early in the morning.
With a chuckle he forfeited his pen and ripped out a few pages of paper, handing her the notebook.  She took them with a curt nod and disappeared into the bedroom.  His gaze followed her with pride.
, you are so thoughtful,” Draco murmured, and Harry wondered if he’d meant to say it out loud.  Stormy eyes focused on his as Draco thrust into her mouth, bottom lip between his teeth.
The shampoo was an ethereal, creamy blend of sandalwood and something floral, and he wrung suds from his hair and lathered them down his body.
“Anyway, he’s got the better space now,” Ron preened, still quite happy with his renovations at Malfoy’s.  “Once he’s got a decent table and chairs and whatnot, maybe we can persuade him to play host.”
Harry’s lips tensed, fighting a smile.  “You fell in with a gang of gay wizard ballerinas?”
“Yeah, she does. Feel free to remind her I hate her while you’re at it. Drop my glasses down.”
O Warden, my Warden?
“Oh, here we go,” the Goblin said, as the naked orator produced an ornate golden chalice.  “I’m Burgock, by the way.”
Harry looked back to Falk, who was grinning like a wolf in a sheep pen.  He realized he’d never seen Falk smile, and hoped he never ever did again.  This had to be what a Rusalka looked like when it drowned its prey.
at the scorched spots on Ron’s shirt before Audrey came round the corner.
Shrugging, he poured his own cup and waited.   She rewarded him by clasping the mug in her hands and not making a move to throw it.
Harry suppressed an inarticulate squawk, fully aware that his cheeks were absolutely scarlet, and there was nothing he could do about it.  Malfoy’s admission made him nervous and jealous and excited and just utterly confused.
The toe of his shoe traces precise circles, and he brings the quill up to run the smooth, short barbs down his cheek.  Harry wonders if Draco shaves with the same motion, because it’s very much a preparatory gesture.
“No shit,” Harry huffed.  “Yesterday, was a bit of a shit show, and now you’ve got a flatmate with a tendency to
, I have no idea.  You are… moving in, apparently?”
“Right…”  Draco continued.  “So, he got bored and swirled the stabilizer to the bottom and only drank the aphrodisiac.  But…double.”
Harry feigned a shocked gasp.  “Just another corrupt-“   Her fingers wrapped around his cock, and he actually gasped as she stroked him in a tight grip.
“What kind of games, Draco?” Harry’s tone held an edge of warning.
.  Carpet and Harry’s feet greeted Draco as his head hung over the edge of the cushion.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Draco rolls his eyes, but sets the knife down. “I’m better with live plants, which is why I eat so few of them.”
“I did,” she said cautiously.  Several orbs burst with sudden light and simmered down to each glow uniquely.  Glaringly bright cerulean, ominously dark vermillion, a sickly churching chartreuse.
Ch. 3- Your actions might be appropriate, Draco.  He’s fucking hot.
Draco circled the tent warily. The split flaps on the front held three crossed wands and a red cross. Between them, toes peeked out.
————————————
He was wearing track pants and a sweaty t-shirt that clung enticingly to muscled arms and a powerful back. He must have come straight from training.
“Harry, I registered it to Hermione,” he prattled on, “since she can’t have one in her Muggle building, and you already have your Ministry-issued residential Floo in your flat.  I figured keeping Malfoy’s name entirely off it was best.  Hope that’s okay.”
“Subjective.” Draco turned and bent one leg up against the back of the futon, hands in his lap.
My feet hurt.  Like I’ve been running, not just planning to.  I have to get the fuck out of here.  I can’t leave when he’s here.
But none of it matters, because he’s chasing the kind of release he’s only ever had with one person. One person he trusted with his life on a daily basis. And now with one person he really only trusts for this. But it’s enough, that trust.
——————————————
“Shh…”  She kissed his chin again.  “Let me decide what I can handle, maybe?”
He continued idly scrolling up in the conversation on the phone, disappointed that it was rather banal, other than mention of Millicent and himself.
“This yours, Potter?” Hagrid rotates the fox in the air, looking him over.
Hurry,
Ron stepped out of the Burrow Floo, still picking Quintaped hairs off his t-shirt.  That thing was going to be the focus of all of his nightmares for the next year.  Bloody terrifying creatures, they were.  Like a starfish, king crab, and gorilla had a very fertile three-way.
“I should put clothes on,” Harry muttered.  Merlin, this was a bad idea.  He was already so hard he could barely think.
Codger continued, spitting as much as he was speaking.  “And I would like to extend a welcome to our very unexpected guests from the international wizarding community.”
Gods, the man was a hot mess.  So resolutely uninterested for so long, but so
His mobile was vibrating with a steady stream of incoming text messages, and he rolled his eyes.
Her knee hitched up over Draco’s hip as she wrapped an arm around him, and he relaxed into her.  The few minutes they’d spent exchanging dysfunctional memories of absentee parents had been disgustingly comforting.
The messages had started twenty minutes ago.  And damned if Draco wasn’t right.  They were going to get an international Portkey at dawn on a Saturday.
Sure, Malfoy probably
“I am beyond
“It is…”  Fleur searched for the words.  “
“Mm hm,” he hummed, working his way to her ear.  “But you can’t-“
The pad of the man’s thumb traced over Draco’s bottom lip, but avoided the cut. His hand cupped Draco’s cheek and wiped a tear from his temple.
Draco grunted against his upper arm, arms and legs intertwined like a greedy Acromantula.  An especially aggressive hand job had done wonders for Draco’s mood.  Harry set his glasses above them on the ledge and snuggled down into the nest of pillows and limbs.
Ron nodded in agreement.
Draco planted a kiss on Harry’s chin.  “I.” He kissed Harry’s lips.  “Love.”  The tip of his nose.  “You.”
“I’m awake,” Harry grumbled, folding his arms under his face.  His hands fell between the wood slats, and sweat dripped from his fingertips onto the concrete.
“Everything okay?” she asked, struggling to keep her eyes north of his chest.
His breath caught as his own hand pressed hard against the base of his growing hardness.  Nope, he thought.  Auror, not lover.
A light shone softly under the door, and the knob turned.  A woman stood in the open doorway, sleek dark hair cascading down over a crimson silk dressing gown.  A rather tall, statuesque woman.
That’s all.
Draco smiled softly, beatifically.  “So, a month?”
“Why?” Draco whispered.  “Why that one?”
The doorknob rattled, and Hermione was the first to turn, leaving Draco with parted lips, bent over the futon.  Harry didn’t notice, tongue and fist still working as Ron shuffled in, plastic bags in both hands.
“A little,” she muttered, nuzzling into the fabric over the crease of his groin.  “Maybe I’ll just leave you like this.”
Lucius’s eyebrows got higher and higher.  Draco ticked items off on his fingers as he went.
“Yeah. Slow.”
Draco sighed, relieved that Ron wasn’t immediately appalled.  “Half-Rusalka, like Magnus.  His niece and nephew, actually.”
Ron let out a low whistle as the lights rose in the cavern.  Not a cavernous room.  A literal cavern.
“They’re rather well-mannered, in their own way,” Draco said, rising to sit up next to him.  “There were a few in a pen across the field, behind the cottage at Durmstrang.  Every time I burned dinner, which was often the first few months, I’d take it to them.”
He wishes Draco had worn a tie with his shirt, so he could pull him down by it, but Draco drops to his knees and shoves Harry’s shoulders down. His back presses into the floor, and Draco’s mouth closes around his cock, and Draco’s finger slips into his arse, and Harry’s already forgotten the rug is there. He was already so close, that it feels like mere moments before his climax rushes, hard and ready, from Draco’s touch inside him out to his waiting mouth.
“Ron, are you alright?”  A cloud of damp chestnut frizz hovered over his face, worried brown and gold eyes examining him.  “You look like you’re going to be sick.”
You shoulda been an Auror, Ron,” Harry groaned, splayed out on his living room floor.  His jeans were singed through, his glasses were shattered, his futon was still smoking, and
She ground her hips hard against her cupped hands, thinking of him sliding his hand down to do the same as he thrust in her in quick, deep strokes.  Heat coiled low inside her, and she thought of his cock getting harder, his hips thrusting more erratically, his forehead resting on her back, his teeth nipping her skin, until he cried out, thrust deep inside her, and came.
His breath caught and he exhaled in resignation.
A harsher blow, for finer-tuned.
I’ll teach the Future Bully-Knuckle-Catcher 3000 how to snatch a bully’s flying fist in mid-air before it can hurt anyone.  I’ll teach her to dance, and I’ll teach her how to refuse a man’s hand and to fill her dance card with shiny stickers when men aren’t worthy of the space.  I’ll teach her how to map the skies, and lie through her teeth, and when and why to do both.

Searing pain lanced through his upper arm and Hermione screamed his name.

“You read my mind,” she called, shimmying into jeans and a shirt.
“Uhm, yeah.  One of them.”  She really hoped they’d drop the topic.  Cassandra was shell-shocked already, and Janine looked like she was going to burst.
Maybe Ron or Harry would be interested, but she doubted it.  Even if they were interested, she wasn’t sure

, watering the roots down into their new home.
“Greetings,” Draco replied with a bewildered shrug.  Just because Ron was in the other room, they were formally announcing their arrivals now?
In the top photo, a corset and stocking-clad Draco stands in the middle of a group of drop-dead gorgeous men. They’re pressed together so tightly that Harry can’t tell which of the men’s hands are on Draco’s hips or whose arm is wrapped around his waist, but they’re all grinning like they’ve just pulled off something magnificent. Leather straps lace back and forth over Draco’s calves, widening to engulf his feet. He hadn’t been joking about the boots, then. Nor the men.
Ron turned back to his desk and list of smoldering fires.  With a now-clearer head, none of the issues seemed huge.  Most of them looked rather dull, actually.
“If you don’t…” he clipped, leaning forward, “take off your trousers,”
,” Draco corrected.  “I may change my mind in the afterlife.”
“I’m terrifying.” Draco holds two fists out, palms down. One very obviously has the chartreuse jewelry box in it. The other appears to be empty, save for the tattoos on his fingers. “Pick one.”
I just… want you to want me, too.
Draco woke feeling warm and more comfortable than he could ever remember being. He smiled. He must have been dreaming of Harry again. Draco could swear he could smell Harry. He took a deep breath, drawing in that woodsy scent. His eyes flew open when he felt something tickling his nose.
Draco walked over and took Violet as everyone took their places.
McGonagall frowned. “But Albus, you know other students will be upset. The Slytherins especially will argue that you are showing him special treatment.”
Harry shifted Vi, taking care to keep the bottle in her mouth and reached out to turn a page in the textbook on the coffee table. Hearing another frustrated sigh come from across the table, Harry looked up just in time to see Draco run a hand through his hair and glare at the book in front of him.
Snape snorted. “I was not joking, Potter. With you, it is a legitimate concern.” With that the man turned and left the room.
Dumbledore nodded. “I will get Harry settled in tonight. Why don’t you return to Gryffindor Tower and calm the students?”
ring!”
Harry stopped when Snape did and then he flushed when Snape raised an eyebrow. Of course. Snape had no reason to know his way around this neighborhood. Harry looked around until he had gotten his bearings and then started off, Snape trailing behind.
Harry winced. “Ah, Hermione…”
Ginny looked at him pleadingly. “Would you, Harry?”
“If you’d just wait outside, I’ll be out in a minute,” Harry said, still trying to get Ginny’s zipper to cooperate.
“You got married without us, Harry?” Hermione asked, looking both angry and hurt.
-suite. He noticed the Slytherins looked wary.
my baby.”
“I decided on a more appropriate spouse for our son. It works out quite well that Draco is gay.”
Harry bit his lip to hold in the swear words on the tip of his tongue. Remus was right. Until the ceremony, there
Harry nodded. “You know, I’ve always wondered about that. I mean, I’ve always known you two were friends and I always wondered why, if he was such a fanatic about blood purity, he would be friends with you.
“What?” Ron asked, turning to Harry.
“It is a muggle term,” Snape interrupted. “In a muggle wedding the man that stands up for the groom is the best man and the woman that stands for the bride is the maid or matron of honor.”
It was a short walk and in only minutes, Harry and Snape were standing at the door of 4 Privet Drive. Harry gave Snape a nervous look and the older man reached out and pressed the doorbell. Harry shifted from foot to foot as they waited for someone to answer the door.
***********************************
“What the hell!” Ron shouted.
Harry shushed both Ginny and Vi, who started wailing herself when she heard Ginny. He pulled Ginny down to sit beside him on the sofa, wrapping the arm not holding Vi around the redhead’s shoulders.
Harry saw Draco stiffen when he walked in. Harry walked over to the bed and sat in front of Draco. He leaned over and looked at Violet. She opened her eyes as he leaned close and Harry smiled at her.
Finally, they heard footsteps inside the house and then the door opened.
Harry glared at them when Vi stirred. “Shhh!”
before he left.
life for the rest of my life.” Harry gave his friend a hard look. “He’s going to be Vi’s godfather and I’m not going to be constantly fighting with him, especially in front of Violet. I’m not asking you to like him, but we are all going to need to at least be polite.”
Pansy looked at him in shock. Her mouth opened and closed a few times, but no sound came out. Finally she said, “What?”
***************************************
baby anyway?” Draco asked.
Harry glared. “Headmaster, I appreciate that you are trying to help and I know this may seem ungrateful, but…I would appreciate it if you didn’t make any choices concerning Violet. Any choices that need to be made that affect Vi will be made by me and Pansy.”
Draco’s breath rushed out of him and he froze, trying not to move a single muscle as he looked at the top of Harry’s head. When Harry sighed and pushed closer to Draco, Draco thought his heart would beat out of his chest, but Harry only sighed again and stopped moving. After several long moments, Draco closed his eyes and breathed a soft sigh of relief when it seemed Harry was not going to wake.
“Draco, Granger told you this was an engagement ring,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes and wiggling the fingers of her left hand.
After a good hour’s work in the library, Pansy was joined by a couple other Slytherin girls. They talked and worked on their essays together though Pansy was careful to avoid any discussion about her illness. A couple of hours passed and Pansy began to feel tired again. It took her ten minutes to get away without having to invite the other girls back to her private room and her feet dragged as she walked down the hall.
her boyfriend. They did everything they could to keep the two of them apart. When they found out that she was pregnant, they sent her away and refused to tell her boyfriend where she was. The last I heard before they moved away was that they had sent her away to some school and the child’s father never found his baby.
“I would have thought you would have wanted Molly Weasley to help with that.”
“Right,” Ginny said and then shook her head. “I’ll just-I just-…Right, so. I can see why you would agree to him being the godfather. You’re giving her peace of mind. Letting her know that we Gryffindors won’t corrupt her baby.” Ginny gave Harry a weak grin.
Harry shook his head and let out a little laugh, remembering the glint of determination he had seen in Luna’s eyes before she wandered off to ‘reclaim her oawirth.’ Harry had no idea what an ‘oawirth’ was, but he guessed it was some kind of endearment for Ginny.
Snape nodded and left quickly. Dumbledore warded the door after the Potions Master had left.
Snape suddenly glared. “Do not let it happen again, Potter.”
“Great! Go grab it!”
“Harry? Why haven’t they suggested that Violet isn’t yours or something? I mean, they seemed to have accepted this pretty easily considering,” she whispered. “And aren’t they a bit shocked that their gay friend has a baby with a girl?”
“Draco, you are holding my daughter, who is going to be your goddaughter. I think we’ve earned the right to call each other by our first names,” Harry said. “And am I sure about what?”
************************************
When Pansy caught sight of the incredulous looks on the faces of Harry’s friends, she frowned and leaned over to whisper into Harry’s ear.
Harry left the Black estate to Remus. He couldn’t think of a more appropriate gift to leave his mentor and semi-surrogate father. He left small, appropriate gifts to his friends, such as some books to Hermione and his Quidditch gear, including his broom, to Ron. He left a small portion of what he discovered was a rather large fortune to the Weasley family. Everything else he left to Violet.
Harry frowned. “What does that mean? What more is there?”
and I'm still not completely happy with it. Somethings are being mentioned way too soon, but I'll just have to adjust my timeline because I'm not writing this chapter one more time! In any case, I hope you like it.
Harry took the chance to catch his breath. He was in a room somewhere in the dungeons at Hogwarts training with Professor Snape. Harry was approaching the end of his sixth year at Hogwarts and he knew he wasn’t the only one feeling like time was running out.
“You reasons for marrying Miss Parkinson.”
“Harry, you are marrying the girl because she’s dying. I can see to you agreeing to make Dra-what the hell?
Draco tried to ignore the way his heart beat faster at Harry’s nearness. As Harry leaned in to put Violet into his arms, Draco caught Harry’s scent. It was a natural woodsy smell that on anyone else, Draco would have sworn was cologne. But Draco knew Harry didn’t wear cologne, not even to the Yule Ball in forth year. It was a scent Draco had only caught a few times over the years and now, just as it had every time before, it caused Draco’s body to react.
Harry just glared at him and continued. “You Malfoys would make great allies. There will be plenty of distrust and suspicion and insults when you join us, but as Slytherins you would already know that. And really, how’s that all that different from being Death Eaters? In return, you would have far less chance of being killed off by your own allies and, when the war is over, you will not only be allowed to continue life as usual, but you will be seen as heroes. Because, make no mistake, I will be winning this war,” Harry finished grimly, tightening his arm around Pansy’s shoulders.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You will set a horrible example for our daughter if you are miserable. So you are going to find a good man and get married and be happy.”
Harry looked at the crying girl and thought of his own family, of living at Privet Drive. He knew exactly what she meant about wanting a family, about wanting to be loved. How many times had he fantasized about getting older and marrying and finally having a loving family of his own? It was why he tried so hard to be straight; why he told himself it was Cho he had a crush on, not Cedric; why he tried really hard to tell himself he loved Ginny as a boyfriend and not as a brother would.
“Ginny!” Harry said in exasperation.
“Ginny?” Harry asked when he couldn’t stand the silence any longer.
Both had forgotten that the Headmaster was still in the room. They never noticed how he watched them with sad eyes and a sorrowful smile. They jumped at the sound of his voice. “Miss Parkinson, I believe you may want to tell him the rest,” Dumbledore said softly.
Severus rolled his eyes at the response. “I believe I told you that you could not do so without your guardians signing the necessary paperwork?”
“What do you mean, Albus?” Snape asked darkly.
Ginny let her hair down and she quickly fixed it. Draco turned and left the room, Ginny and Harry soon following. As Harry passed Snape, the man handed him a small black box. Harry grinned. “Thanks.”
“Ron, what are you talking about?” Harry asked, glaring at his friends. They hadn’t spoken to him since he had tried to invite them to his wedding. Admittedly, he hadn’t been around much and they didn’t know where his suite was, but he’d been in classes with them.
“Ron and Hermione seem to think you are still angry with me and upset over me cheating on you and they think I should be trying harder to make things better,” Harry said while glaring at his friends.
“She’d look adorable with a cute little upturned nose,” Harry protested.
“Harry! Are you even trying to make things better with Ginny?” Ron demanded.
“Potter, what is going on here?” Snape asked. Harry could swear there was a thread of amusement running through the man’s voice.
Draco looked at his best friend and then back at her baby.
Pansy smack Draco lightly on the shoulder. “Watch your language! And I think what Harry’s smiling about is the way you are cuddling with Vi.”
“Harry. I think they will be well suited, don’t you?” Lucius said calmly.
“Everything is just fine,” Harry said through gritted teeth. Here he was, trying to ask his best friends to come to his wedding and they were going to treat him like that!
“Something wrong?” Harry asked.
Harry shifted on the sofa and kept his head down as he continued. “When I was about eight or nine, there was a family that lived on Privet Drive. They had a teenaged daughter and she got pregnant. It was all Aunt Petunia could talk about for months.
“Obviously not, Potter, or you would have been done by now,” Draco said sarcastically.
“Oh,” Hermione said. She settled for leaning close to look at the baby.
Harry had an idea. “Do you have a formal dress, Gin?”
Harry and Dumbledore watched as she left and then turned to each other.
“You still could have come to me,” Draco whispered.
“And, when you refuse to take the dark mark you will have someone to go to,” Pansy said, giving Draco a hard look that said she fully expected him to keep his promise.
“Actually, Minerva, I had already been planning on provided one of the Slytherin students with a private room.” Dumbledore held up a hand when she started to protest in outrage. “The student is quite ill, Minerva.”
While McGonagall explained the situation, sounding extremely upset, Harry stood behind her and tried to explain to the Headmaster through hand gestures what had happened.
Snape nodded when Harry trailed off. “Also, I spoke with Lucius. We discussed the arrangements for the ceremony. He wants to speak with you after the ceremony before he makes a decision on the matter you asked me to speak with him about.”
Harry blinked rapidly, trying not to cry himself. “I promise, Pansy.”
“I am Thornspur. Mr. Snape said that you wished to have a will drawn up today, Mr. Potter?”
’ smiling at the baby. “Harry, mate,” Ron said apologetically. “I told Dean and Seamus I would play a game of Exploding Snap with them.”
Harry hurried after him. It didn’t take Harry long at all to figure out that they were heading for the dungeons. Soon they arrived at Snape’s office. Harry followed the older man in and turned and watched as he warded the door.
Snape smirked. “I take it that the Headmaster has led you to believe that I have only been spying since your mother’s death?”
Draco frowned. “Why?”
“Yes,” Harry whispered. “What now?”
“Well, let’s hope she doesn’t get my nose,” Pansy said, leaning over to look at her baby’s face. “My baby pictures look fine, but as I grew…” Pansy shrugged.
“As in, they have plans to get married?” Ron asked, horrified.
By this point, Harry was beyond annoyed with Hermione. He had moved into outright anger. He glared at her back as she walked away. Ron soon followed.
“I know I’m still pretty young,” Harry said, “and I know that I’ve only been a father for a couple days, but…I always thought that’s how fathers
“Oh,” Narcissa said, pleased. “How wonderful! Welcome to the family, Harry!”
“Or,” Harry said, “in our case, the man of honor and the best woman. There you are, Ginny.”
” Draco said out loud in horror.
“Okay, I’ll be back soon,” Harry said. He leaned over and smiled down at Vi before turning to leave.
Two hours later, Pansy was surprised to wake from her nap and walk into the living room and see Harry and Draco sitting next to each other with their heads together. After watching for a minute, Pansy grabbed her books from her room, wrote a quick note and snuck past them, checking on Vi on her way out. Both Harry and Draco were so focused on their discussion they never noticed her leave.
“We’re fine, Harry,” Pansy said. “We’d probably already be out of here if,” Pansy cleared her throat and blinked rapidly for a few seconds, “if I weren’t ill.”
“Hey,” Harry said.
Ginny winced. “Why didn’t you say anything, Harry?” she whispered.
Harry handed the black box to Ginny and whispered, “Hold this for me? Just open it and hold it out when I reach for it, okay?”
Snape lifted an eyebrow at him again.
Draco just walked over to the side of the bed opposite Harry and leaned against the headboard and looked down at Vi. Ron and Hermione were a bit louder in their entrance.
“Yes. And you should be grateful I do the understated look well, Harry!”
Vi would start off in Pansy’s room and Pansy would get up with her the first time she would cry. When she had gotten Vi settled down again, she would put her in the bed in Harry’s room and Harry would get up with her the next time and put her to sleep in Pansy’s room. Then the next night she would start off in Harry’s room and so on.
Severus ignored Harry’s thanks. “I need to file these documents at the Ministry.”
Pansy started to reach for Vi when she had a sudden thought. She quickly and quietly went to her room and searched through her things. Soon she found what she was looking for and she returned to the living room. Seeing that no one had moved while she searched her room, Pansy quickly raised the camera and took a few pictures. She was glad the wizard camera didn’t require a flash as she’d seen on a muggle camera she saw once.
Pansy smirked. “As a matter of fact, promise me now.”
“What more could there be, Harry?” Ginny asked in disbelief. “You cheated on me with
Reaching Snape’s office, Harry entered when Snape barked out a command to do so. Seeing Harry, Snape lifted an eyebrow and made a show of checking the time. Harry smiled ruefully and sat in the chair in front of the Potion professor’s desk.
“Explain,” Severus demanded.
Harry pulled out his wand and set his bed on fire. There was no way he was ever going to sleep in that bed again. He stood there and watched it burn, feeling a fierce satisfaction as the flames spread. The heat and smoke drove him back a few steps and he started to cough on the smoke.
Harry smirked when Draco started choking on his wine. Lucius just continued to calmly enjoy his meal.
***********************************
“Miss Parkinson,” Dumbledore said urgently, “where is the book with this spell? Does anyone else know of it?”
“I can’t say I’m sorry, Harry,” Pansy finally said.
Draco turned an annoyed glare on Harry. Harry also never seemed to notice when he was so close to Draco, much less the effect he had on him. He definitely gave no indication that he felt anything himself.
“What are you doing here? Did they kick you out of that freak school of yours?!” she demanded, looking up and down the street as if afraid of who was watching and might see them standing on her doorstep.
Harry couldn’t help but notice that bewildered was a cute look for him. He nearly fell off the bed in shock when he caught himself thinking that.
Harry was sitting on the floor between the sofa and the coffee table holding Vi in his lap, feeding her a bottle and reading from an open book on the coffee table when Draco came in.
The three other students stopped and stared in shock as they finally saw the scene in the room. Pansy was sitting on the bed, holding a baby, with Harry Potter sitting next to her with his arm around her shoulders.
Dumbledore turned to Harry and Pansy. “Please join hands.” The two nervous students reached out and grabbed each other’s hands. “Harry, you may begin.”
Snape lifted an eyebrow and, rather than walk outside, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the ragged glove. Harry grinned at him and crossed the room. He gave his muggle relatives a bright smile as he reached out and touched the portkey and he enjoyed the brief look of horror and fear on their faces before they disappeared.
Draco frowned, why was she looking at him like that – as if she expected him to bolt from the room or something?
-They both look out at the lake.
-Harry runs after Draco.
became a thing of the past. The next time his eyes opened, it would be Saturday.
Harry heard the jealousy in Draco's voice, but Draco shoved him with a scowl. Same old Draco sodding Malfoy, he'd never change.
-They walk to Gryffindor table together. Harry gives anyone that weren't happy, a look of pure warning.
“Auror Graves is speaking with Minerva, he requests your presence.” Draco cut to the chase before Harry could even greet him. “Immediately!”
“What is it?” Draco frowned, eyeing the folded parchment.
“You never seem to have lessons after lunch on a Friday, neither do I.”
Harry thought as he poured himself a new coffee. He took his time figuring out his reply, and once he was ready, he starting writing.
Draco: "Nothing! Just finish your drink and stop worrying about things that don't concern you."
“Fifty point will be taken from Slytherin…” Draco glared at the boy. “And you will remain behind. The rest off you may be dismissed!” Draco was obviously angry.
Harry held Draco’s eyes as he continued. “I don’t think bad of you for breaking down earlier either, I’ve done it enough times. I know how humiliating and weak it can make you feel, but… I have your back Draco. I hope that’s something you can accept because … I think I need someone to have mine too. You up for that?”
Harry: "I was thinking of visiting the shops. I was gonna grab some Bertie Bott's every flavored Beans."
A healer from St Mungo’s had been called over, and Draco – who had still been in the hospital wing at the time, explained that it was their belief that a more potent version of the draught of living death could have been the culprit. This of course, posed the question of how he knew this – especially when a spell confirmed it to be true. More questions then followed when the Aurors arrived, and it was a giant mess.
Draco: "Jealousy doesn't suit you Ronald."
“I don’t want your forgiveness Potter!” Draco spat, walking off to his chambers.
Harry muttered softly as he came up behind Draco in the bathroom - who had been holding onto the sink sobbing. All the food of Draco's body lifted gently like being sucked away into thin air. Andromeda taught him that spell over the summer - to clean spilt milk of Teddy's clothes. Draco jumped, embarrassed to be seen this way, and not expecting Harry.
“So, he didn’t confirm that he
company Potter?” Draco asked. Harry though that Draco sounded much older than he actually was, tired and worn out.
He still needed more to go on – there must be hundreds of people with that combination of looks.
“Alright! I’ll let you know.” Harry said, realising the urgency to go and find the girl. He turned and rushed off toward the Hufflepuff common room, sending a patronus message to Neville asking him to meet him there.
Harry didn't look remorseful at all, but Draco was sure he didn't mean it - It still fucking hurt though.
“Can I trust you with a secret?”
He sighed and walked to the other end of the living room - over to what looked like a massive golden snitch stuck trying to pass through a tall wooden table. Harry opened the top half of the golden ball, revealing a drinking cabinet with glasses. As Harry was helping himself to a glass of Glenglassaugh Octaves single malt Scotch whiskey, Draco found his voice.
As Poppy handed him the vial, he recognised it as a mild pain reducing draught and assumed that it was to reduce the stinging that he was suffering in his extremities. He downed the potion quickly, relieved when his symptoms started to alleviate… but they didn’t go away completely.
Draco certainly wasn’t going to admit that Har-Potter, was simply the first person he'd though to call for assistance. “You've already expressed the desire to deal with Mr Avery yourself, so I thought you’d want to know. If you wish to tell her head of house, or Minerva, then by all means, but I’m serious Potter, the girl was in a right state and may even need to visit the hospital wing.”
-Mentions refusal of work due to mental health reasons.
Harry was currently in a staff meeting - one that was just about to end, but he couldn't keep his eyes from wondering over to certain blond man he hadn't seen in about twelve years; one rather good-looking Draco Malfoy. Yes, Harry could admit when a man was gorgeous, even if their personality was ugly ... but the change in Malfoy was shocking.
“Look, Har, I didn’t know that stuff would set off-“
The nearest one reminded him of the crystal ball in his bedroom wall.  Swirling sky blue and white streaks chased each other under the glass as he wrapped his fingers around it.
“Aww, romantic,” Ron interrupted dreamily.  Malfoy paused, smiling.  Weasley was a bit of a softie, apparently.  Harry looked at Ron like he’d just admitted to
“Which wand core did his magic prefer?”
He’d gotten, at most, three hours of sleep the previous night, thanks to Potter’s existence in his home.  The man had rolled off the couch not once, not twice, but thrice.  He’d never once stuck the landing gracefully, and the resulting grumbles had repeatedly startled Draco awake.
“Har.”
.” He growled, cursing the damnable skirt, head falling back against the chair.  The skin of his chest ran hot, flush chasing up to his cheeks.
Giving’s vital; as is taking.
She looked up to find him frowning slightly.
“It is getting rather loud in here.” She shoots a glare toward Harry’s friends and shoulders her purse as they slide out of the booth. “Draco, we’ll see you at-“ She blinks quickly, and Harry wonders if she’s going to cry and what on earth he’s walked into. “I suppose we’ll see you when we see you, luv.”
The ICW had shipped the body to the Asklepieion of Kos for a thorough autopsy, while the Ministry had a hissy fit.  Harry had no idea what the Asklepieion of Kos was, but it was evidently some kind of hot shot international Healer’s guild.
Sisters’ embrace already torn.
Fuck, she was too close to coming already.  Not that a finite amount of orgasms was a remote concern, she thought.
“Your department gets Aurors from Muggle police?”
Harry froze the memory instinctively, initially startled that he could.  Malfoy was drawing… fire?  A forest on fire.  Interesting, he thought, wondering if he still had the sketch.  No, that was dumb.  How could he?
“Good,” Draco said, grey eyes peeking over the back of the sofa with a glint.  “It’s a date.”
Ron had only seen a night sky so alive out at Shell Cottage.  He turned, taking them in. They faded as the rough stone ceiling of the room came back into view.
“Soon.”
Her tongue ran a line up to his ear, drawing a shudder from his chest.  Interesting, she thought.   Thrilled at finding a way to disrupt his teasing, she tentatively locked her teeth over the muscle of his shoulder.  It earned her a deep rolling thrust from him, and she moaned.
“How can-“ Harry pauses as Kate dabs something cold on his ear. “Why?”
“Psst, Harpy.”  He nudged her cautiously with an elbow.
“I think she prefers to be called a mother hen,” Ron corrected, nodding.
Dove-grey eyes focused on the mug in front of Harry, still avoiding his gaze.  Harry wished Draco would just yell at him.  The suspense was awful.
The fox chuffs at Hagrid’s retreating form as he wanders back to the gala, leaving Harry with arms full of panting fluff. Even through inches of fur, Harry can feel Draco’s heart hammering inside his ribcage. He’s not a large animal, really. Not difficult to carry.
“Don’t send it, Har,” he mumbled into his bottle.
“And a platform,” Draco said slowly.  “And a train.”
Gods, time stops at those first cries.
Blood dripped down his shoulder as her talons dug in.  She scrabbled for a stable grip, puncturing down to the muscle as he gritted his teeth and wrapped a towel around his arm.
“No, this isn’t the film, either.” Harry scoops another handful of popcorn into his mouth.
Draco swallowed thickly, blinking back tears.
Ron gets injured.  Malfoy's a Healer?  A Dark Arts Healer?  That's a thing?  Why?  How?  What?
With a sigh, she slid a key under the fold of the paper, making a ragged incision across the top.  There looked to be a single piece of  ivory paper inside.  The edges were thin, the pulp having been spread by hand.  Unfortunately, there was no sliding it out of the envelope without destroying it.

Her nipples tightened as
Hopping to his forearm, the small owl turned its round face up to him and ventured a demanding little shriek.  It was a bold move, surrounded by much larger birds.  The falcon danced its agitation on a perch, ready to attack.
She isn’t very smart.
Love, we’ve got you.
"He's getting the Kiss."
,” she sighed, her fingers having found his hair.
“You know you two could come here.  Ron put beds in some of the other rooms.”  He inclined his head toward one of the unused rooms on the other side of the kitchen.  Little more than a dark entryway.  “Not that Draco would probably care if you used his.  Kind of picky about this sofa, though.”
Heavy feet clomped down the stairs in a one-two step.  “Lou’s down!  Pints!” shouted Bill.

Harry swallowed thickly.  Malfoy on his knees looking up in greedy expectation was a bit too arousing.
Draco shrugged.  “Under the silver rose bush?”  Harry nodded, looking through the files.  “She used to sit there and cry a lot.”  He knew his voice sounded numb, but didn’t feel like wasting effort on a convincing performance.
Harry hummed eagerly as Draco’s fingertips traced the tight edge of his trousers and met at the button.  A soft breath huffed out of him as Draco popped it open and slid the zipper down.
He groaned and pressed his weight between her legs, reveling in feeling his pelvis flush with hers.  His entire length was buried inside her slick heat.
Harry’s eyes slid down the other man’s body, lingering on his groin, admiring Malfoy’s ability to have a coherent conversation with what appeared to be a full erection.  But then he hadn’t drank the koboldozers.
Cassandra glared at her, and Hermione’s chest flushed with nervous prickles.  Damned if she was going to sit in a library and listen to snide remarks from a Muggle in Fuck-Me hair.
He’d always hoped he wouldn’t have to nudge his best friend into this personal revelation.  It didn’t feel like his place, but maybe nobody else was going to show up out of the blue and do this.
“I want to come on your cock,” Draco said in a heated rush, eyes raking down Harry’s chest to his hard length, “and I want to watch you come, and then I’m going to lick your skin clean,
He felt in his pockets, fingers coming to rest on the cool metal of his pen.

She fiddled with the hem of her apron, gaze in the middle of the floor.  “No, I don’t think you will, love.”
“Okay,” the man whispered. “Okay, it’s alright.” A warm hand ran down Draco’s arm, and he shivered, naked and wet in the cool air. “I’ll get you something to wear.”
*********************************
Harry nodded, finishing off his abysmally flavorless oatmeal.
That there was a Head Auror private box at the Stadium was a surprise, Harry thought.  And the fact that Robards’ Floo had seen fit to deposit him in it was another surprise.
The man picked up a key off the dresser. “I don’t have to-”
Harry pursed his lips, shook his head, and rolled his eyes, taking some blame for Basilia’s forwardness with him.  Catching on, she smirked and wagged a finger at him.
Metaxas whips around and scowls at Draco, but is met with casual indifference.  Draco shrugs and ventures a glance toward Harry, eyes following the motion of his jaw as he finally gets the gum softened enough to properly chew.  Bits of lemony sugar crunch between his teeth.
“I… well…” Narcissa stammered.  “At least we’re on good footing socially,”
Moonlight glances off Jensen’s cheekbones and casts his face in stark relief; beautiful, ethereal, and all Harry's. If he wants. And a part of him does want it.
Ron was in love.  In love, or maybe in severe like and experiencing considerable indigestion.
“Harry, Kate. Kate, Harry.” Draco gestures between them. “Kate’s a Squib. And a Bulstrode,” Draco says with a nod.
Biting his lips, he tried to quantify for himself where they
“Fiiiine,” she whined, and scooted out toward her clothes.  “This worked out pretty well, though.”
each other?  Free
“Oh,” Harry whispered.  “Well, what should I do with the smaller three?”
Ron hummed and nodded, but rolled his eyes at Harry, who cocked his head like a confused Crup.  Smiling softly, Draco wiggled his toes under the Head Auror’s thighs as Harry shoveled korma in his face.
The box slid back under the bed, and Draco crawled toward him, snatching the cuffs up.  After an entirely too-thorough demonstration that bordered on condescension, Harry’s wrists were firmly, but comfortably, secured under his back as he lay propped up in a nest of pillows.
Harry waited, knowing the tightness around Malfoy’s eyes meant he was still formulating a response.  That was fine.
“All here?” Falk asked, dropping his hand from Harry’s chin.

Harry lays it across Draco’s palms and waits for a reaction. It’s only as wide as Harry’s thumb, and he watches Draco turn it over, then loop it around his wrist.
The Wizengamot was gratefully using the side doors to file out, and not passing their table.  Hermione and Ron were both queuing up to leave, but he and Potter just sat.
This chopping block feels quite bereft.
“Are you sure this will work?” Eric asks. He turns Harry’s Invisibility Cloak over in his hands and holds it up to the streetlight outside Gringotts. “If they have that ticket linked to their wards and we side-along in, one of us might get bounced back out. I’m sure we can see the fireworks from somewhere else.”
“A note would have sufficed,” Draco said, head falling back on top of the arm of the sofa.  “But then Granger wouldn’t have come over, and I wouldn’t have sent her back loaded, and you wouldn’t have sent a note, and I wouldn’t have invited you to dinner, so…
“Oh, fuck,” he says in a half-sob. “You’re awake.”
“Wait, a cliff?”
Ron lowered his lips to her ear, turning her head to look at Harry.
Aurors do not... They don’t... Merlin’s tits.
He nodded, relieved she’d guessed on the first try, and didn’t look prepared to mock him for it.
Ron cleared his throat, a dead-on imitation of his own father, and whispered rather loudly, “Would the ever-so-mature third years please not wake the-”
“Why wait, though?” Harry asked.
“Jensen’s here on contract for the summer.”
his dick just so she could watch Harry suck it.  Motivation, that.
Odbert softly shut the ledger and Ron felt the Goblin assessing him, then his bag.  Bloody impolite, Ron thought.  But he knew well enough not to look down at a Goblin.  Rude little bastards.  Nothing compared to growing up the youngest of six brothers, though.
Ron laid down on his back, watching the clouds roll by, giving Harry some space to excruciatingly dissect every conversation he’d ever had with men who’d scared him off with misinterpreted compliments and innuendo.
The older one, gray hair buzzed short, turned to him and nodded disdainfully.  Great, he thought.  Narcissa on the prowl meant Lucius with a scowl, like it always had.  Such a lovely marriage.  Maybe he could work it into his story of breaking off his fake engagement with Pansy.
“Uhh…”
Sudden realization made him gasp shortly through his nose, and he was grateful Potter was noisily slurping up broth.  Damnable eagle tendencies.  He should
A ponce, a swot, a ginger, a disaster
It was sheer luck he’d taken a moment to look up at her and raise his head before the bench collapsed. Not much to be done if the Healer is the one with a concussion.
Gnashing, slashing, windows smashing.
Chortling and bobbing enthusiastically, she held out a leg.  Unsure of what she wanted, he offered a finger.  Surely she hadn’t learned to shake hands.  Her talons wrapped around his finger, but she made no move to let go or shift her weight from his arm.  She just watched him out of one eye, expectantly.
“Merlin,” Draco gasps through a smile, “so bloody eager.”
Pitchlynn leaned back in the chair and hooked his thumbs in his jeans pockets as he waited for a response.

His magic weaves the air denser, and my scars eat the pressure down like slashed vents.  Like they can save me from being crushed to death miles under the ocean.  Save me or pull me down into the current.
“Ugh, fuck,” she groaned.  “Never again.”
Potter left his coffee on the table and wandered through the kitchen to the door and patio.
Onasis’ shell-shock and open intrigue echoed Harry’s feelings too well.  Why the fuck was Malfoy radiating cold fury but nuzzling into his neck about it?
From “Writings in Exile”
Draco woke with a crick in his neck and an insistent throb in his cock.  Not the best nap, but a decent enough one.  Enough to think.  Or fuck.  Or think about fucking.  Or fuck about overthinking.
for alerts.
“I very much did.” She smiled back. “You know you’ll have to earn it, though.”
Harry’s eyes burn, and he realizes he’s been staring, unblinking, at Draco’s knuckle tattoos for a while. Draco rubs a thumb over the letters on his fingers. “There’s a little cinema down the block. And the place next-door has the best falafel.”
Pansy had put the bra on over her dress and was turning her chest to admire it.
What if they couldn’t pin this on Lucius?  What if all this had accomplished was stirring Narcissa up before releasing her?  What if she took it out on him next week?  What if she came for him?
Harry levitated a chunk of leftover beef from the kitchen, through the living room, and let it hover above the couch.  Nostrils flaring, Crookshanks’ head emerged as he sought out the morsel.  With a flick, the meat landed in the cat’s bowl in the kitchen.  A flow of orange fluff followed it, and Draco’s empty arms fell flat.
Stifling a smile, he replied, “I guess I will.  It’s easier as an eagle, actually.  But eagles don’t appreciate it.  Not that Magnus did, either.
“I pissed in a mug tonight.  That was a first,” she said, taking a tentative sip.
raising you, you selfish brat!  I
“Promise,” he whispered, slowly pulling Malfoy’s hand to his face.  “As long as our signatures are recorded together, they won’t know the difference.”
Sea water and blood filled Ron’s nose, and he tried to snort it out, but found only air.  Glancing over, he saw Harry doing the same thing.  A biscuit out of the baskets got rid of the taste and smell.
Knife in hand, he took off eastward, testing the ward as he ran, barefoot over the sandy soil.  He fell into a ground-eating lope and found himself at the eastern edge as the sun broke over the hills.  Perfect timing, he thought, watching the rays askance.
Not really.
Malfoy took Hermione’s chair and sat down with the book. “So, 28 days, regular?” he asked, again trying to tread lightly into the topic.
“Oh, well,” Draco murmured, sliding his hands down to the bed and rising.  “It is my duty to indulge you.  My sacred obligation, really.”
“…but this Adams wanker is honestly going to botch a…”
“I’m pregnant, Harry.”  Draco announced, draining his mug.  “With Granger’s babies.  Twins.  It’s all rather unexpected, and we didn’t know how to tell you.”
He needed to be going over Malfoy’s records for the Wizengamot Committee meeting in a couple weeks, not dealing with this dumb-fuckery.  Especially not from Ron, and not for something this idiotic.  He had absolutely no patience for this caliber of bullshit today.
The number of Malfoys with case files was alarming.  Though, he surmised, it wasn’t so different with Muggles.  The wealthy could afford fines and dodge incarceration, so perhaps they were more prone to petty crime.
Harry glanced around at the dispersing red robes, half-hoping one of them would tell him what he was supposed to do next.  It was disorienting, the business of finding oneself Head Auror.  No mentorship with Robards showing him the ropes.  Just sudden, amorphous responsibility from any given direction.  Like being dropped blindfolded into a firing range.
Hermione turned and shot him a withering frown as she sipped, shrugging in agreement with Draco.  Feeling oddly exposed, Harry slid his boxers back up over his hips.
“And this.”
“Not yet,” Draco said sarcastically.
“Yeah,” he sighs.
Draco winces, scarlet lips pulling back. “And tattoos…”
“No, Hermione, he’s a thrice-damned Death Eater, and I’m done pretending he’s not! I don’t give a fuck about his projects or his Quidditch or that he survived the damn war,” Ron said tersely, gesturing to Malfoy with a quill.
He sighs flower petals and frost again.  “Draco, I’m allowed to have friends.”
“Hacked.  And no.  She yelled at me for my spelling.”
“Falk?” he croaked.
dust out of fabric without somewhere to put it.”
Chomping indelicately through the first truffle, he swallowed.  Hunger gnawed at him, but wolfing down an innocent box of chocolates simply wasn’t done.  Or wise.
“Aren’t you?” Draco smirks, and grinds his arse over Harry’s groin. Harry moans, and Draco’s hand wraps around his own length.
Water puddles around Draco’s feet, but his eyes are on the bulge in Harry’s jeans. Draco steps forward, and Harry steps toward the wall, assuming Draco means to head for the door. Instead, Draco stalks toward him until Harry is backed up against the scorched tile.
“Which time?” His ex-fiance bit the inside of his lip, and Draco thought he saw the start of a frown.
Scarlet lips turn down at the corners in a contemplative frown. “Since Voldemort died.”
“You know, dear, I’m not sure,” she admitted.  “When Muggle women don’t scratch the itch, do they run a fever?”
Her mouth snapped shut.  “Dark Arts, not
Harry could smell the wind on Malfoy, and it made him wistful.  Distractedly, he wondered if Malfoy had ever chased a Snitch as an eagle.  That would make for a very short match.
Harry released Draco, and both his arms wrapped around the other man’s chest as their breathing slowed.  Hot lips pressed a path along Draco’s shoulder, up his neck, and nipped at his ear.
He could practically watch her melt into her knickers, Harry thought disdainfully.  She took a deep breath and resumed instructing them and shifting her own position.
“You really aren’t a cat, are you?” she asked, more to herself.
The Golden Trio lose their clothes again.  Damned Gryffindors.
The foot of the bed sank, and Draco knelt there, a soft smile on his face, and a blueberry scone in hand.  “You’ll find people you hate in each house, too,
Draco smiled, bottom lip between his teeth.  “You could knit a jumper right now, and I’d come, Harry.”  He sighed and ran hands up Harry’s thighs, gaze lingering on Harry’s hard cock jutting out between them.  “For starters,
Watching her watch him, he wondered if she’d thought about him the last nine years the way he had of her. Had she been groaning his name into a pillow at night? Was it as familiar on her lips as her name was on his?
His heartbeat was slow and steady under her hand and in her ear.  She melted against him, grateful he understood.
“Sorry,” he replied.  “I just… is this a date?”
thorough.  Truly a class act.
“That’s very generous,” Malfoy replied cooly.  “But please reiterate to your husband that I’m not actually on his payroll.”
The rain was letting up, but he eyed the window less eagerly than before.  Molly’s undivided attention was intense, uncomfortable, but also benevolent and nebulously protective.  Like he was being interrogated for his own benefit.
Harry flicked his hand sarcastically.  “She spent the night with you.  Not like you got left out.”
“Gay.  Ernie?”
Draco yawns and buries his face in Harry’s hair.  “I’ll figure that out later.”
They had named themselves The Elder Band, and their terrible name had been nearly as annoying as their death threats and assassination attempts. If they were responsible for this, then either Granger was working with them, or they’d kidnapped and likely tortured her.
“Dray, when are we getting married?”

Pansy sat down suddenly in front of him, drawing his hands out from under his chin.  Obligingly, he watched her, gaze soft, as she splayed his fingers out on top of the leather.
“Oh, well, I won’t take it personally, then,” Harry muttered, a disembodied hand coming up to scrub his eyes.  “I was just seeing if you were going to Malfoy’s, too.”
Molly’s treats and a pot of tea would have to suffice.  And Granger was just going to get an eyeful of him in a t-shirt, pajama pants, and bedhead.  He was kind of looking forward to throwing her off-kilter with this departure from host expectations.  She probably thought she’d be eating off porcelain in a grande dining room.  This would be fun.
“Malu?”  Harry asked with a hesitant grin.  “They have names?”
He worked his fingertips up around her ears to massage the small muscles at her temples, and earned a soft groan.
“I don’t want her trying to use Legilimency and Obliviations to clean this up,” he whispered, leaning a touch too close for propriety.  “She’s good, but this is too many people.”
Fucking impossible, he thought, lungs heaving and legs pumping.  Fucking biologically, magically, herpetologically impossible.  Someone had sent him a female Basilisk with viable fucking eggs.

“I should never have married you,” she spat, leaning forward.
“You don’t have to make me lunch, you know.”  Ron took a bite of the sandwich, and it was… a sandwich.  It was fine, but it wasn’t worth his time nor her effort.  Not when he had a dismembered Quintaped to find cold storage for, and she’d been in the middle of gardening.
“I had scars from the war,” Draco said, half-statement, half-guess.
“So, Malfoy,” he started.  “The Ministry didn’t hide him.  He hid himself.  And I’m responsible for his safety, so I’m not going to tell you where to find him.   But I can take a message back to him for you.”
His wrists tugged against the cuffs behind his back as the weight of his situation sank into him.  He was bound, displayed on a mound of pillows, adorned in silken raiment, and between his feet knelt his lover.  A sacrifice to the altar of themselves alone.
This was how he remembered Potter.  Glasses askew, covered in chaos.
“I don’t think we can.”  Draco licked his lips and stared straight ahead.  He was ghastly pale, even for him.  “I don’t think it matters if we do things differently.”
Sudden, dying gasps
“I live here?” Draco asked, but he couldn’t have said to whom. “Like this?”

Hermione will never ever speak of how she summoned this Patronus.
Unholy beeping filled the room again, and she slammed her hand down on the alarm clock. She must have hit the snooze button. Evil contraption.
He felt her knees settle between his feet as her fingers changed position, and he tilted his hips up.  Her fingers froze, and he cracked an eye to look at her.
He smirks as a delicate blush blooms high on Draco’s cheeks, and Draco clears his throat. “What, uhm, are you?” he asks, then shakes his head. “I mean, uhm, what are you, you know… into?”
But if anyone were going to make the case to her that it was relevant, he supposed it would be Malfoy.  And if he’d convinced her to learn for
“Sure.”  She closed the file and checked her mobile.  “Are you going to keep Adams a while?”
“Sorry, Potter. Even amicable breakups are still breakups, I suppose.”
He’d been suspicious of Falk in the deaths of the Aurors and the man in the bar, and this all but confirmed it.  And Falk had done all of this without missing a cue from Basilia.  Like it was little more than breathing for him.
Draco’s jaw clenched, and he exhaled carefully through his nose with a slow blink.  “What’s the worst thing that could happen?”
Her hips picked up speed quickly, keeping time with her hushed, panting moans.  He crooked his fingers inward a touch, and her hips stuttered.  A frantic sob of pleasure broke from her, and her core gripped his fingers, clenching time to the movements of her hips.
this man once, mind and body.  He’d handed his fucking soul over to Magnus, only to have Narcissa repossess it.
“Greedy witch, indeed.” Ron scolded.  “And you know, I don’t think I’d object to coming in your mouth while you do so, ‘Mione.”
Maybe bringing him a set of dishes wasn’t unreasonable.  Hell, at the moment, he was prepared to buy the man a fucking harp.
With a sigh, Draco looked from the preoccupied Supreme Mugwump to Falk and pinned him with a solid scowl.
“Oh, shit! The curry!”
“Reckless, sometimes.”
“Oh.” Draco grimaced.  “Superb.”
Voiced again, for you who hailed me.
She pulled him back out, sucking him dry.  “Don’t ever call me ‘Granger’ again,” she whispered against his length, sliding him back along her tongue.

Draco harrumphed a breath through his nose and set his teeth just behind the flared head in his mouth.  “
“Yeah, I’m gonna Floo into the Atrium and-“  Ron’s hand brushed the pouch of AstraNox in his pocket, along with the shrunken furniture and trunks.  “Shit.”
Dinner was what his invitation had said, but he’d slept for a day and a half instead of preparing anything.  Rounding the corner, he sighed, seeing the baskets Weasley had brought in.  At least there was food.
The sun was high and the air balmy the first time it happened.  Mid-summer.  Quite possibly his birthday.  Which birthday, he wasn't entirely sure of.
“Fuck, Ron,” she whispered.  Heat pooled low in his hips as he felt her start to tighten around him.  “Fuck, fuck fuck,” she chanted as she moved.
“Thank you, Potter.  Our last small item, which is not on the agenda, is the sentence revision of Narcissa Malfoy, given her position as both a prime witness and potential plaintiff in the case against her husband.”  A woman from the Wizengamot box across from Hermione stood, paper in hand.  She was one who’d delivered a simpering smile to Narcissa before she’d been hauled out with the Dementor.

Not exactly the kind of introduction her classmates and roommates could hear, so she’d stayed quiet.  Quiet and alone, for the most part.  Quiet, alone, and quite lonely.
Next to him, Draco knelt and wiped tears from Ursella’s cheeks, and Harry’s heart dropped into his gut as he heard the words.  “But Papa, what if the hat doesn’t
Harry snuffled his nose into Draco’s hair, and felt the other man tense up.  “Don’t you dare, Potter.”

Malfoy’s comment about not needing a broom for several years came back to Harry.  Of course he didn’t need a broom anymore.  Why would anyone bother with a broom when they could fly like
Harry bit his lip and fidgeted with the ring on his finger.  So many things made sense about Draco’s dream that had been confusing before.  The rings, the children, Draco wailing like he’d just lost a limb on the platform.
He relaxed into the mattress with a muted sigh. Come oozed from his fist onto his shirt and belly. It would look better on his not-husband’s skin. On his sticky-sweet lips, dribbling down his chin. Painted across a tattoo on his arse.
“And I want this hand,” she took his left hand, skimming it up and around to cup her left breast through her shirt. “Here.”
The corner of an empty seat and the backrest of another were enough of a ladder. Harry's elbows rested across the rails, hands wrapped around the metal as he pulled himself up, chest, waist, hips, and legs. He toed the cloak under his shoes as he slid forward.
Odbert’s long, gnarled fingers snapped loudly, and books drifted from his desk up to the shelves, sorting themselves neatly.  The door slammed shut behind Ron, and he shrieked a tiny, very manly shriek.
Malfoy’s brows rose with sarcasm.  “Bully for me.”
Draco huffs, amused.  “Your mouth gets you into entirely too many situations your arse can’t handle, Potter.”
Harry’s lips smother Draco’s words, reducing them to a pleased hum as his hands find Draco’s waist. “I like it.”
She looked up, pinning him with her gaze again. “Maybe I want you to come so I can lick you clean before I beg you to fuck me hoarse.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry chuckled.  “You have to read this shit.”
“No,” he said much more solidly than he felt it.  “Let them see.  Nothing changes if they don’t see.”
She gulped loudly.  “Oh! I… I don’t see it anywhere.”
“-train, and I want to punch that bloody-”

“The UK is a dangerous place,” Falk said, like it was common sentiment.  “Your Ministry doesn’t exactly make it safer.”  Harry stared at him, not understanding.  His eye itched, and he glared at Falk.  “You have no idea, do you?” Falk asserted.  “You don’t know how corrupt your Ministry is.  Or how poorly it protects its people.  Or what the rest of the world thinks of you.”

His ability to project an austere, buttoned-down facade while red-eyed, wild-haired, and all but naked was impressive.  The Emperor sans clothes, she thought.  Such a jarring departure from the Malfoy in that memory.
He poked Harry in the shoulder with the mobile.
He was still pleased he’d pulled off a five-hundred mile Apparition after not having done it in nearly a decade.  But escape was his speciality, he mused, picking up a book from the table.  Not the most dignified area of expertise, but if he’d had much pride left, he probably wouldn’t have spent the afternoon curled up crying on Weasley.
“It’ll stop if you want it to stop,” she said as her touch skimmed the scars between his fingers.
She sighed and closed her eyes as she tried to remember his bedroom.
The guards were both witches again, and curiosity got the better of him.
“I… sorry, I didn’t hear you,” she stammered, propping herself on her elbows and blinking sleep from her eyes.

“Mum,” Ron asked softly.  “Why the haircut?  Why the soup and cake?”
“Liar,” Draco scoffed and broke off a corner of his muffin.  “It’s not every day I take a man to my bed for the first time, snog him till he falls apart, then he wakes up hating me.  Spite for breakfast.  Unusual menu item.”
His hips hitched to drag it back across, and the timbre of Magnus’ voice trickled through his mind.  He huffed a breath in surprise.  A rather inconvenient sensory memory.
“Going down!”  Ron yelled, hopping off the stool.  Molly snagged Malfoy’s collar and pulled him back, supporting his head.
Robards said as early as possible.  He’d just get there at 5:00 and sit outside the Head Auror office till Robards came in.
Never slows.
Pansy’s phone vibrated against the tile and he grimaced.  She tapped out a reply and hugged her arms around his head.
“Oh, fuck you very much,” Pansy fires back, smirking.
Harry sat at his desk waiting.  For what, he wasn’t entirely sure.  For someone to tell him what to do?  For some kind of emergency?  For Falk to breeze in and agree that this was total shit and he definitely didn’t look that desperate in person?
Malfoy sighed and leaned against the doorjamb.  “Because I knew you’d show up here a smoldering disaster.  And not only do I not want to talk
The DMLE guide contained an entire section on MedCap qualifications and responsibilities. It was extensive, to say the least. Most MedCap partners took an Unbreakable Vow. Not to defend each other, but to protect their unit, even over each others lives.
Harry stirs and clearly says something about chicken tikka.  Gorgeous tosser.
Gathering his own memories, he bundled them and filtered back into her.
“Language,” Draco chuckled.
Harry was still talking, but the words were lost behind the thud of his pulse in his ears.
Glassy grey eyes drifted up to his with a soft, sad smile.  “I love you.”
Her walls stretched to finally accept him, and she whimpered, urging him to hurry.
He clasped his hands behind her back and leaned her forward as his impatience grew. Her face leaned into his shoulder, and he laid his cheek over her forehead.
Harry’s glasses landed on his chest, thrown by either Ron or Hermione.
Her hands slammed down on the table in front of him, and he closed his eyes.  Sometimes, surprise blows hurt less than expected ones.
“But you had my grey jumper and my sweatshirt and I just- I just thought…”
“And you’ll tell Ron to get the demolition plans to Amsterdam by-”
His hands pressed the damp soil down, hands around the base.  A thorn scraped across his tattooed pinkie, and he drew back to look at the bleeding scratch.
A sharp thunk to the back of his head startled him to alertness.  The most recent addition to the pile had slid off and clocked him.  The glossy-pictured book fell off the side of his head and opened to a section on common fungal afflictions of stone fruits.
I don’t know how long I’ve been standing over the pile, but the balls of my feet are numb and my heels hurt, so probably too long.
********************************
She sucked in a breath as he slid a finger between her folds.  He froze, noticing her sudden tension.
His condescending face blurred, and she blinked to clear her vision.  It didn’t help, and she tilted her head.  That didn’t make a difference, but he came back into focus.  Adams’ nostrils flared, and he glared at a point in front of the counter, next to where Harry leaned over the dusty regulations manual.
“Your what?”
“Merlin, Granger!” he belted.  “Warn a bloke.”  He shook his head and looked her way.  Instead of looking relieved, she still looked exhausted, and now in pain on top of it.  Rather pitiful state, really.
“Probably a nice change to have such a fine upstanding citizen bending over for him, hm?” she said placidly, like she was discussing his Quidditch team's statistics.
The owlery attendant flinched.  “Yes, ma’am, Ms. Granger.  It’s just that... We all decided, the owleries... that is, that because our owls never return from a delivery to him, that we’d need to take that into account.”
Rain patters against the glass ceiling, and Harry wishes he could catch it on his tongue.
Harry shook his head.
“What’s wrong, Granger?” he mumbled into her neck.
A silent bond for we the quiet.
In drink or skin, all prudence fled.
Cool skin slid over his own hand, and he yelped, room coming back in to focus.  Furious grey eyes scrutinized him, scowling.

“No,” he whispered.  “Not the actual kids.  Me.  And kids.”  Harry turned and rubbed his face against a pillow.  “I’m not… I don’t think I’ll be good with kids.  Or even okay.  Bad, even.”
Wide, mortified grey eyes watch him as he flexes his jaw and blinks. Draco cringes and sits up with a murmured “Sorry.”
“You alright?” Harry whispered, mere inches away.
“Fuck… fuck…”  Harry whispered.  Draco pressed his thumb behind Harry’s sac while he moved, judging his reaction.  “Oh,
“I did.  I earned my keep.  And stop frowning, Granger.”  He caught her gaze as it traveled up from his concealed groin.  “You’ve already seen this show.”
“Uhm, yeah,” she muttered, still entranced by the idea of replicating Cassandra’s Fuck-Me hair.  Ron would absolutely die if she showed up to Wheal Elvan in that.  Draco would probably laugh himself to a full erection.  Harry would be adorably confused by it all.
“See?  I’m dangerous,” Ron said, preening.  “The Ministry’s Most Wanted.”
“Well . . . you did ask nicely.” Draco’s fingers withdraw, and he murmurs spells into Harry’s hair again. “Keep kneading.”
“Aye, son.  They found her this morning.  Peaceful-like, though.”  Rhoda’s soothing tone washed past him, not sticking.
“Rather taken!”  Luna exclaimed.  “And I told her you call her that.”

Someone is attacking Harry in the dark, pinning him to the sofa, and he throws an elbow behind him to slam into the person’s thigh. The attacker reeks of leather and cigarettes. A man collapses onto him with a pained grunt. Harry rolls him off onto the floor and shoves his hand down to pin the man’s neck to the floorboards.
You understand the slaughter…?
Harry yanks his shirt over his head, drops his pants and trousers, and kicks the pile of clothing out of the way. Draco’s shirttails block Harry’s view of Draco’s groin, but the rug is soft as Harry drops to his knees and shoves Draco into his mouth. Fingers twine in his hair, followed by a hoarse shout and a long strand of expletives.
“It hurts like a mother fucker.  Can you Heal it here?”
Fan-fucking-tastic, he thought.  It was a solid argument, he had to admit.  And Potter had waited till he had reason.  And he had tried to get out of being assigned to his case in the first place.  Really, he had done what he could to keep his distance.
“The bodies they found near the tree line at the Manor all show evidence of trauma and residual Unforgivable curses. I haven’t asked for them to be screened for any kind of Blood Magic, because I’m not sure we need to, and because I have no idea how to even do that.”
Under his arm, Draco stretched and rolled on to his back with a loud yawn.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.

Her breath was soft in his armpit, and he was starting to suspect she enjoyed his sweat.  She was also going to fall asleep soon, judging by the slowing rise and fall of her chest alongside his.
And I'm a praise slut.
If Harry Potter had any chivalry, Draco thought, he would pace attractively where his audience didn’t have to strain their necks to watch.  But damned if he was going to move from his standard position on the sofa to get a better view.
Harry can’t quite resist letting his thumb rub along Draco’s lower back, and his skin is just as soft as his fur, but warmer.
Harry wraps a hand around both of them and gives a slow, languid stroke or two before he answers. “You do get what you want, don’t you?”
Harry rubs his lips together as he pulls away. “You really were celebrating a Quidditch contract that night, weren’t you?”
A face emerged from green flames bearing glasses and an untidy mop of black hair.
“Oi, you’re not supposed to be here!” shouted a man's voice, cutting through the silence of the dim vault.
Molly smirked at him.  “So long as no one gets hurt this time, hm?”
A blurry shape appears in the doorway, and he settles his glasses back in place. The MediWitch purses her lips and takes a steadying breath. “It seems Mr. Malfoy left.”
An anxious gesture, Harry had noticed.  It hadn’t really occurred to him that Malfoy couldn’t consider his future options without taking the twins into account.

Doubt brewed, heavy in his chest.  Not even a kiss goodbye?  Had he done something to make her leave so abruptly?  Was it the book?  Had he done something in bed she didn’t like?  Was he just entirely off-base in thinking she’d enjoyed his company at all?
He’d expected his first time to hurt like hell and be moderately terrifying, not…
“Her husband doesn’t like her blowjobs, either.” Falk said softly, a smirk disappearing behind a styrofoam cup of tea.
She lingered under a streetlamp to peruse the Quibbler issue, but more to revel in being under a Lumos-enchanted light.  Her wand and magic use had been almost non-existent aside from contraception charms and the rare cleaning spell.  Some things were too important to trust to Muggle technology.  Or too tedious.
Impossible to meter out!

Falk chewed his gum and thought carefully, turning and adjusting as Basilia commanded.  “We hope to be done with fundraising by the end of this year, and break ground on a new complex well outside the city in spring.  Next summer will be the last season on the historic field.”
Draco treats him to a lop-sided smile. “Your aim is impeccable.”
Hermione crumpled the paper and tossed it at Crookshanks, who watched it roll to a stop next to his paw, unmoving and entirely unimpressed.

The man looked away from him, down a street made mostly of potholes and patches. Draco felt an odd solidarity with the pavement. Every detail he learned felt like a shovelful of asphalt stomped into his head.
Watch!  Step by step, this dark ballet.

against the deepest root of him.  His hips snapped forward as pleasure whited out his vision, and he throbbed against her finger.
Draco’s shimmy turns into a whole-arse waggle. Harry lunges forward, but Draco hops to the side, out of reach, and turns to bolt toward the kitchen.
Draco’s teeth chattered, and he bit a knuckle to stop the sound.  His tongue traced the creases in his skin as his lips formed a seal and sucked against the intrusion.
“Oh, hell.  That really is her.  She probably has a timetable for it already,” Ron groaned.
“Hi,” Draco whispered.  “Pockets full of furniture again?”
“That’s so vague,” he huffed as he wiped his cheeks dry.
“Good morning, early bird,” she said as he took the chair next to her.
Harry’s week is a blur of emergency wand orders, mostly for students returning to Hogwarts after the holiday, and some yearly restocking for several organisations, as well. A tremor-stabilising handle made of quaking aspen for a Healer at St. Mungo’s. Black walnut shell dust grenades to rid the Hogwarts greenhouses of an ambitious Venomous Tentacula. An extra-springy corkscrew hazel wand for a gymnast-turned-first year Muggle-born student.
“Shh.” She hissed, cutting him off. He felt the flutter of her Legilimency again, and let her in.
“But now I want ice cream,” Draco said with a huff.
He was treading carefully, she thought, and he was right.  She did need more than her pussy could handle tonight.
“Say it again?”  He let go of Draco and sat up, hands on his thighs as he pressed himself down onto the hot, slick length below him.

“Three…” he muttered toward the door, not sure if he was expected to do the same.
“And I’ll blow-“
He cast a Muffliato with entirely too much force, and Hermione thought she’d gone deaf.

But would Harry wake up in this bed tomorrow morning?  How long would he stay once he didn’t need to?  How many hours until Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were free?  Free
He needed to go back to his flat for his wand, at least. He’d left it in the bathroom. He wiggled his toes between the couch cushions and catalogued the items in his flat that were worth the trouble of rescuing, and came up with very little. His wand, a pair or two of shoes, and maybe the ring and receipt in the safe under his bed, if for nothing other than the mysterious nature of them.
Draco rose up, lips still stretched around Harry, and lifted his brow over innocent, round eyes.  Harry chuckled.  “Yes,
Without thinking, she opened a random page, holding it up to the light filtering in from the street outside:
His head swam with visions of finding her dying on a rocky beach, mashed together with memories of her screaming, writhing, bloody on the Manor floor. He shook his head and looked for the owls. Their circling had become a descent spiral, and a shred of hope loosened the tightness in his throat.
Fingernails trailed up both sides of his neck into his hair, and he froze.  The hands slid down to grip the tops of his shoulders.
And so, the need for a witch or wizard trained in Muggle law as a liaison between the two worlds had been on the docket for the last five years.  It didn’t officially have her name on it, but there weren’t any other Muggleborn law students lining up to challenge her.
“I believe I shall ride this lovely cock on the bathroom floor, then hop back in the shower.  For actual bathing purposes.”

Dread trickled in his gut. If she told him to simply bend her over and fuck her senseless, he was prepared to refuse. He’d told her to lead, but that didn’t mean he’d follow blindly.
Draco started to ask how on earth he’d know how to heal anything, but data points shuffled and realigned in his head. Piles of cigarette butts that moved like lung tissue. Spells that could match blood samples. A self-diagnosed potential concussion.
“Oh, sorry,” he sighed softly.  “But no, nothing like that.  I am not a vector of disease.  Currently.  And I checked you thoroughly when I Healed your shoulder.  Took care of a budding sinus infection, too.”  His tone was off.  Monotonous.  Dead.
“So…” Potter led, eyebrows raised in expectation.
The ward pressure eased, admitting him and he started the walk to the door.  It was always a nice enough little stroll, and the footpath had gotten noticeably more tame.  Probably due to the increase in traffic over the last month or so, he figured.
Draco, reluctant Seer.  Coming to grips with this shit.
Ch. 4- Your vengeance followed by snuggly sex with Harry are very appropriate, Draco.  He’s fucking hot.
It’s . . . sweet. But that’s not what this is. The towel gently wipes him off, and there’s a rustle of fabric before his joggers are pulled back up over his hips.
Harry looked at Draco, who was taking slow, measured breaths and gripping the sofa like it was the last solid thing on earth.  What had him so shaken, Harry wondered, taking a cursory sip from the bottle.
“Help yourself, little trickster,” Odbert said.  “Most of this has been sitting here since the seventeenth century, when it was fashionable for young heirs to partake in death-defying quests.”
He nodded slowly, shifting the pot to a hip and pulling out his knife.  With a wary glance at Molly and a responding encouraging nod, he nicked a finger, letting a single drop of blood hit the dirt near the sheer granite face of the outcrop.
“No, surprisingly.”  Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.  “Later,” he whispered.  His finger and thumb pressed against his eyes, and Harry suspected he was hiding tears.  “I cheated on him, Harry.  Spectacularly.”
“I wish my paws had thumbs.”
Ron was mutilating celery, it seemed.  And perfectly good carrots and onions looked to be next on death row.  “May I?” Draco asked, extending a hand for the chef’s knife that was being used with all the elegance of a Bludger’s bat.

“Oh, well, that’s certainly out of my price range.  I guess I’ll try something else,” she slouched.
“No, dear, I never thought to mention it to Hermione,” Molly replied.  “Draco, I’d say you’re done.  Much better.  Whoever’s been cutting your hair doesn’t know cowlicks.”

His relief when she got back in bed was palpable.  Falling into his dream was seamless, except that the point of view was hard to control.  They were still in bed, but there were other people with them.  Kids?
She had a dab of neon pink highlighter on her lower lip, where she’d tapped the tip while deep in thought. It was more than a little adorable. “Yeah, sure.”

Security inside the bank was guaranteed.  It was probably the only place he’d feel safe from assassination attempts, really.  Transportation was the real issue, but maybe he could work something out with Potter.
Harry continued peppering Malfoy with questions about Koldovstoretz and Durmstrang Quidditch. Nipping at the heels of a Death Eater for information was an odd way for an Auror to slake his curiosity, she thought. Especially considering he’d probably acquired said knowledge in unsavory ways.
*********************************
“Would you do me the honor of not quite marrying me?” Tears ran down Harry’s cheek, and Draco wiped them away.
He rolled over and looked up at Molly Weasley.  Patient eyes adorned with laugh lines softened as he watched them.  “Hi,” he whispered.  “They found her.”
I kind of started remembering a lot of things I’d forgotten.  Or made myself forget.”
Malfoy’s eyes sprang open with a gasp, and he looked wildly around the room before squinting at the back of the closed door.  The terror in the bond quickly dissolved into profound annoyance.
“Me?” Draco feigned offense. “I’m innocent. And so bored, I think I’ll reread
“Uhm . . ." He holds the other empty bowl out for her inspection, and she paws at a bottom cabinet. “Smart girl.” Inside is a bag of dried dog food, and Harry scoops it into the bowl and sets it down. “Hungry, too.”
“Huh,” Harry said, chewing slowly, his happy little shoulder shimmy reappearing for a mussel.
you!  I hate you both!  I should have smothered you both in your sleep when I had the chance!”
The dragon hatchlings in his dream chase each other around his ankles in gleaming, scaled figure-eights. Warmth radiates from them as they climb his legs. The golden one squeaks a challenge at the red one, and it responds in a kitten-cough puff of smoke that makes Harry laugh and reach down to pat its head. Together, they climb up over his groin, and he scoops them higher, onto his chest. They snuggle up, and he hoists them onto his hip.
“Is the Asklepieion of Kos a Healers Guild?  I think I’ve heard of it,” she drawled.

Harry snorted a laugh and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.  “Great.  I have to see him around Diagon.  And now I’ll have that mental image.”
, Draco thought.  Lucius’s preferred topics of conversation were the ones that were difficult to lie about.  Draco could make up stories about his social and dating life for years, but Lucius could easily send an inquiry to area spirits purveyors and find out that the Ministry had razed the Malfoy Manor vineyards two years ago.  Maybe someone in the postal room could be bribed… nah.  Too Slytherin.
Harry’s eyelids flutter open, and he lifts his head from Draco’s shoulder. His hands make ineffective squeezing motions in the dough for a moment, then the head of Draco’s cock pushes into him.
His weight crushes me to the bed, a forearm across my shoulder blades as he reaches into the nightstand.  I’m pinned, breathless, and in a sudden, tear-jerking rush, I remember how much I love this fucking bastard.  I forget it every day, and I fill that empty space with bitter ashes until
“We are celebrating the most lucrative transfer contract the Russian League has ever extended to a 3rd Division Keeper. A true masterpiece in royalties and loopholes.”
“I suspect you spent the morning being distracted by a chair.” Draco rolled over to face him, winding an arm across his waist and up Harry’s back. “And that is dangerously close to engaging in

“Ah, no.”  She dried off, conspicuously skipping her groin, and quickly wound her hair up in the towel.  “We sorted it out.  Are you staying in bed?  I could do with a nap before I have to go.”
“Did you sit at that table and imagine her getting fucked?”  He kisses the clenched muscle in the corner of my jaw, and I will myself to relax it.  “Did you think about her getting pumped full of come and keeping it?”

Ron bit the inside of his lip in thought, embarrassed by his own lack of knowledge on something fairly pivotal in wizard society.  “Solidarity?  Basically.  It was a serious case of the haves and have-nots, so most families who could use it quit teaching their kids.”
His mouth opened, but nothing came out.  There was no one to hear it, anyway.

It was his turn to roll his eyes.  “I mean Weasley.  Your Kneazle is already in love with me, anyway,” he huffed.  “We’re eloping to Paris.  There’s a bad pun in there about fucking the wrong pussy…”
Harry slid his glasses back on and picked up his coffee.  Falk looked either deep in thought or rather peeved at something in the distance.  Harry wasn’t sure which, until he spoke.
If he pulled the loop with his teeth, his hands would drop free and the ropes around his shoulders would loosen. After the sink incident, she’d started using a tie that left him an emergency exit.  He wasn't proud of it, but still grateful.

“Oh! Right. Death. Yeah.”
Liore was real.  She wasn’t one of Narcissa’s delusions or Lucius’ lies.  She’d been real.  Was real.
“Gods, ‘Mione,” he rumbled. “I thought you’d never come back.”
He beckoned a guard seated a few chairs away from Hermione.  The man sprung up and disappeared through the door in the corner.
Seer… stones?  Sounds like bollocks.
“Yes, the Burrow,” Malfoy responded, pulling Harry to standing and entwining his cool, clothed arm with Harry’s naked sweaty one.  “I need to drop something off, and then we’ll go home.”
“Fair enough.”  She leaned in to run her lips over his collarbone, and his hands found her waist.  “Show me your disappointing bedroom.”
His fingertips rubbed against each other.  Slickness spread thin across the ridges of his fingerprints as he tried to control his breathing and ignore the nearly-painful throb in his cock.
“Long story or short?”
Harry’s teeth find his bottom lip again, and his free hand finds his hard cock as Draco’s thick, hot head presses against his hole.  A moment of pressure, a soft gasp through Harry’s nose, and three breaths to adjust, and Draco’s just barely inside his entrance.
“Actually,” Draco says, lingering in front of him, “I wasn’t, but those were delectable.”
A dust plume wafts over Harry’s trousers before he realizes Metaxas is throwing himself a geriatric tantrum by kicking up dry dirt.
Harry should have had four more nights in his bed before he could move back to his flat.  No, Draco thought, frowning,
Fuck.
What if I say “Let’s run away?”

He wasn’t a typical cat, but looking up porn on a laptop was beyond even him.  She sat down to figure out what he’d done.
“Mmmyeah,” Ron drawled, opening his eyes.  “Yeah.”

“And that family is immense.  And powerful.  And
Above the pile of clothes, the early morning sunlight hit the quartz orb in the wall, making the streaks glow azure.  Harry hadn’t mentioned daffodils, but his hands had smelled like muffins when he came home from Narcissa’s cell.
At some point, his story was Magnus’ story, and Harry didn’t have a right to it.  Unless Magnus was part of his future, as well.
He was born for this,

“You’re full of surprises,” Draco huffed, and considered his words.  “Malu picks it up from you, I think.”
With a pop, he landed on the other side and used the bracelet to hone in on Malfoy again.
*********************************
Hermione’s eyes followed Draco’s hand and widened expectantly as he gripped Harry’s thigh and bent his top leg up, setting the knee in front of him.  Harry sucked his bottom lip under as Draco eased the tip of his cock against Harry’s entrance.  It was awkward, being watched while vulnerable, and Harry felt himself tense up.
Okay, she thought, a rather
Humor drained from the man’s face, along with the pink in his cheeks, and he was suddenly stricken.
She blew out a slow breath and tried to concentrate on her tepid surroundings.  She was going to be sitting in a courtroom deciding a man’s fate in a few hours.  And had just been asked to gang up on the top authority in magical law enforcement.  Meanwhile, on every side of her, bored law students struggled to stay awake while one of their own crucified herself on the monotony of her own words, likely taken verbatim from a textbook.
This child, so trained!
,” he whispered, grazing his lips back and forth.
His ear caught a faint whistle as they walked.  Probably a flying memo in a hurry.
———————————
Charon won’t accept dead for dead.
Suscitsempra.
Hermione hid a chuckle against Harry’s back and wrapped her arms around his waist.  He relaxed a little under her hands.  Of course Ron had tried to cheat his way through the written portion of Auror training.  It was a wonder he hadn’t gotten kicked out.  Officially, anyway.
A knitted shroud!  Right where you drowned her!
Days. Days alone. Days alone in this fucking squalor. Nothing to do, nowhere to go. No purpose, no destination. Nothing and no one and no reason to exist.
Potter turned and walked away, but Draco suspected he didn't leave.  It kept happening, the glimpses of him.  A fresh red robe with gold trim.  Licks of his magic late at night.  A week of seeing Potter in his peripheral vision.  A week of unprecedented peace in the yard.  A week without Lucius.
Rough hands cradled Draco’s jaw, thumbs gently stroking down to his chin and back.
“Well, sort of,” Draco says, confidence faltering.
The warm fist running over his cock urged his hips to thrust forward, despite his downward urgings.  “Too much,
Draco’s lips graze over the tip of him, before laying an obscenely chaste kiss. “Mine.”
She gave a low warning hum that slowly trickled to a soft growl, ending in a light snore.
Above him, within arm’s reach, dozens of plastic glow-in-the-dark stars adorned the ceiling of the tent. Over Harry’s shoulder, the constellation Draco glowed softly. Orion’s Belt… Leo... Cassiopeia… Ursa Major… Virgo… Ursa Minor… None of them in their correct positions.
His breath caught.  Something happened to Magnus?  And no one told him?  But how could they?
“I’ll be done in a minute.”
“Yes.”
The man is wearing a bloody corset and stockings. A black leather corset with silk straps that go up over his shoulders, and a black lace garter belt clipped to fishnet stockings. The fishnet pattern feels as though it’s intentionally drawing his gaze upward to linger on the satin knickers and bulge within.
“Falk
“Fine.  You asked for it.
He pulled his lip under in thought.  Maybe Potter’s concern was valid, though.  Was Draco slowly realizing Mag had been a less-than-ideal partner?  Yes.  Was he worried about him becoming a rampaging Dark Wizard?  Eh.  “No, not without just cause.”
Names of the dead.
, he thought.
This time was worse.  This time, they’d agreed on no touching at all.  Draco didn’t trust him, and Harry certainly didn’t trust himself.  Especially not with the red dildo on the table.  The one that was an exact replica of his own cock.
It won’t last. Harry knows as soon as his hips are flush with Draco’s arse, and every touch liquefies and settles, a molten weight at the base of his spine. His hands run up Draco’s back, and he’s so warm and smooth that he almost forgets about the tight, wet heat around his cock.
A sliver of wood.  No longer than his thumb.  Little more than an ambitious toothpick.
,” Draco sighed, before obliging Harry with an inhalation of air.  “
The daisies in his hand are wilted compared to the obnoxiously green grass under his feet, but he tosses them next to her headstone, anyway. It’s the least he can do, but it’s the most he’s ever done for her.
Draco maybe tells his parents they're poor and stands Lucius down in a would-be duel.
His skin was fluorescent pink, and the water was starting to cool when he heard the door in the living room slam shut.
!”  He turned to Adams.  “The cat said you smelled like a wolf.”
“You want me to breed you.”  Lips graze my earlobe.  “Don’t you, honey?”
“And then when they finally did have something they needed to tell me,” she continued, breath in a hitching whine.  “It took them days to remember.  Or to bother.”
The man rolled his hand in the air and motioned Draco to continue while he drank tea from a plain white mug.
“Fuck… fuck… fuck…” fell from his lips in time with his cock thrusting forward to meet his hand.
Draco wheeled, circling the mile-wide ward, feeling for damage.  The bag in his talons threw off the slow turn, and he changed directions.  Fatigue tugged at the edges of his vision.  Skipping a midday nap in favor of a post box stop had been a poor decision.  No one ever sent him mail, anyway.
It was nonsense at first, just a mirage of naked skin in her living room.  He waited and watched, letting the images coalesce until Granger took form.  She was straddling one man, another in her mouth.  The men kept changing forms, a rotation of red, black, and blonde hair.   Limbs and torsos shuddered, reforming.  Their bodies kept drifting positions, her silhouette the only stable one.
One of her hands wandered down to cup him, the other supported her weight, she set her mouth on the head of his cock again.
“Well,” Potter started, and for some reason, Draco could practically hear him lacing his fingers behind his head, “for starters, I’ve had a key for ages. And I wanted to bring your things over. Maybe see if it jogs your memory. Your pack’s in here. And you didn’t answer the door, so I was a little worried and let myself in.”
“Well,” he huffed, feigning offense, “how can I turn down such a romantic offer?”
“Something like that,” Harry muttered into his beer.
“Sknnnph.”
There’s a hairsbreadth that separates hate and awe, and in that space lies surrender.
********************************
Bill and Percy flopped onto the couch.  Percy handed bottles to Ron and Harry.
“Hi, yeah,” he stammered, not feeling at all like an Auror.  “My friend’s in jail, and I guess I’m here to take him home?  Ron Weasley.”
But if you don’t, I hope you have fond memories that sustain you.
He stepped out, basket of muffins clutched to his chest, fully expecting to see Harry and Draco going at it like newlyweds.  Instead, the stone rooms were eerily quiet.  Maybe they’d drained each other dry and passed out already.
“Yes. I would assume he went home.”
His sheets were cold against his skin.  Even Harry’s pillowcase was a chilly comfort, despite the scent of him.  No, maybe not
Ursella stomped her foot and yelled in her brother’s general direction.  “Shut the fuck up, Bryn!”
Luna.
“You’re an Auror.  Have you ever protected a child?” Falk asked, attention going back to the food truck.
Maybe not unreasonably so.  Apart from Cho, Ron couldn’t remember the last time Harry had so much as kissed a woman without end up balls-deep in her.
“I… gave Magnus syphilis,” he said, eyes downcast to avoid Harry’s scrutiny.
Draco realizes the amount of intentional chaos Harry Potter is capable of.  And that
He eased himself down onto the piano bench facing her. His gaze was a million miles away, but she very much wanted to go with him to wherever he was thinking about with such reverence.
Years ago, he’d had all of this. He’d had this man, who’d loved him, who’d made a home for him, who’d fought alongside him. He’d had everything he wanted. And he’d ruined it.
She pocketed her mobile and wandered to the Floo.  Coin-operated?  Very odd, she thought.  A glance in the owlery window was equally uninspiring.  What kind of owlery in a major city was closed at all, let alone before midnight?
“Okay,” she sighed and returned the soft graze of his lips.  “I’ll try.  For muffins.”
The inevitably buck-toothed, red-headed, Future Bully-Knuckle-Catcher 3000 hasn't even arrived yet, but Weasley's been avoiding home and dragging Harry out every other night.  I wouldn't-not disregard it if I got laid on those nights.  But no, out-drinking gingers is an exhausting job and some swot's not to do it, and Harry always showers and goes straight to sleep afterward.  He doesn't sleep that well, and even though he doesn't come home drunk, it's still probably not good for him.  It's not good for me, and what's good for the goosed is good for a gander, if you know what I mean.
Malfoy is not, however, waiting in a stall, but personally fumigating the loo. A blue-violet cloud of sickly sweet smoke obscures the low ceiling, and he holds the last half of a blunt out to Harry. Smoke pours from his nostrils as he waits, but Harry shakes his head.
you turn tail and run is new.”
A glance about the plants doesn’t yield a set of pruning shears, or clippers, or even scissors. A tidy pile of monkey puzzle tree clippings sits at the base of the glossy blue pot like an offering, and he surveys the tree. Draco has pruned the tree to even it out. He’d made at least twenty little snips to carefully adjust the tree’s balance, and Harry hopes he’ll get to watch next time.
She watched herself holding two small children, maybe three or four years old.  And he was holding two other children between them, but she couldn’t get a good look at them.
Harry has a lot of feelings about this.  Scared feelings and happy feelings and all the big feelings.
“Oh!” he sighed, surprised.  “It’s a good time to transplant roses.”
“For not… For leaving me at the Burrow,” Harry said, low enough to escape Ron’s hearing across the room.
Draco’s brow knit in concern.  “You hurt me, or I
He tried to keep his eyes above the man’s chest and failed miserably.  Whether he had intentionally turned to outline his figure in the bright doorway, Harry wasn’t sure.  But it was difficult to ignore.  Long legs, narrow waist.  A dancer’s build, Harry thought.
“Just going to walk right by, hm?” a voice croaked.
“Dammit!”
Quiet repose.
“And we would be honored to have your decrepit personage at our Mabon celebration.  This weekend, if you’re interested.” Odbert offered.  “Burgock said he has something for you.”
Surely it couldn’t be that different from going down on women, and he had…. He’d gone down on Hermione so many….
“Wait’ll you see what my arse can do.”
I think I’d starve to watch him eat.
The slamming door concussed the house, echoed down the ladder hole, and through the water.  So much for knocking.  Standing, he slicked his hair back, squeezing most of the water out.  A towel at the top of the ladder would have been a good idea.  A cold, wet, naked face-off sounded like an automatic loss.
Even weirder to watch a man he wasn’t involved with lay in his bed watching the dreams he’d had in this bed next to the woman they both shared.  A rather tangled web, he thought.
He let a small smile peek through.  The Unspeakable was clearly enthusiastic about her work, and it was oddly charming.  And she appreciated gossip, as well.

He slid from the sofa to the floor to fit the legs to the tabletop. He’d made very quick work of it, and she felt useless, her only contribution having been dispensing bolts and anchors when he asked.
“I mean…” Harry grabs Draco’s wrist and pulls his hand away, ignoring Draco’s pout. “Are you going to go off like a bloody grenade?”

“Wicked witch,” he panted.  Attempting to shift his weight onto his tailbone just resulted in pain, and he growled softly, resuming the teasing position on top of the damned plug.  Salazar’s salivaries, if he could just

She’d really thought the capital of Wales, home to hundreds of thousands of people, would have a decent magic district.  At least a Gringotts branch and a robe shop, but no.
Draco shakes his head. “My office Floo isn’t connected yet. Side-along me to the St. Pancras’ Apparition point. I can walk home from there.”
Draco must have been thinking the same thing, because he lets out a held breath and sinks into Harry’s side as she turns to chase a floating tray. She pats a Goblin on the head as she passes him, and they exchange brandished middle fingers, followed by playful raised fists as she steps through the crowd.

He could just feel Malfoy’s lips with his own lips, then.  That was better, anyhow, he thought, leaning forward.

Falk didn’t stand so much as lurch upward bodily and harness the movement into a choppy, quick walk.  He was headed to the food truck, where the man was lifting a basket out of a fryer.  He arrived at the window precisely when the man turned toward it with his chips.  Legilimancy like that was eerie.
“Ugh,” Hermione groaned.  “Fine.  Let’s go home and take a bath.”
Mind still reeling over the implications of his Animagus form, she nodded, “I know.  Maybe.”
“About that,” she started, following his gaze.  The “illegal magic” part of his memory description enticed her slightly more than the drunk naked Quidditch coach part.  Slightly.
Harry’s words echoed back to him as he curled up in his corner of the sofa.  Had Harry considered whose blood he’d end up drawing?
Harry nodded and shoveled in a second mouthful of the scarlet curry.  Draco waited for him to explode in capsaicin-induced pyrotechnics, but he calmly arranged a third spoonful.
Harry leaned back against the sink, head cocked, eyeing Draco warily. He must not have known about Pansy, either. Draco’s embarrassment washed down her as they both waited for his response, and it surprised her. Maybe ganging up on him wasn’t the best approach.
“I think we cooked this hog,” Draco said, settling himself along Harry’s side, head on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry’s arm wrapped around him, and he leaned down to kiss the sweat-matted blonde hair under his chin.
Harry took another bite of oatmeal and turned the page.  The man didn’t seem to give a care in the world that someone was going to die of sexual frustration right in front of him.  Worst public servant ever.

“Oh,” Harry blurted.  He didn’t have a good response for that.
“I love you,” Draco said with a resolute smile, and rolled off to snuggle up against Harry’s side.
The Goblin pointed a gnarled finger across the room where a very naked, very male Goblin was giving a speech on top of a table.  He was drawing quite a crowd, Harry noticed.
Her head tilted side to side, as if sifting options like sand through a sieve. “I didn’t even get to play it yet.” She looked him squarely in the eye. “I will risk the inside of your head, Draco. And I don’t plan on leaving, and am a little offended you suggested it.”
Ron felt Malfoy through the bond, shocked at the sensation of absolutely drowning in contentment.
and waiting for the snap.
——————————
A wry smile turned Draco’s mouth.  “Devious, Potter.  Your turn.
“You want this?” Harry waggles the cape, and Draco’s head snaps back and forth with the motion. He growls a low reply, and Harry smirks. “You want it back?”
, but hesitated.  The touch of magic would wake Harry, who was sleeping rather beautifully.  If one could sleep beautifully.  Which, it appeared Harry Potter could.  His lips were especially kissable while he slept.
“Leave it to you to complicate the shit out of romantic gestures.  It’s not that specific."  He swept the loose leaves and petals into a pile.   “And most couples develop their own little dialect.  If you ever see a stargazer lily in this house, don’t be around after dark or you’ll hear why my parents had so many kids.”
Harry almost offers to bring some to Gringotts, but pauses to analyze the statement. “Are you inviting yourself to stay for breakfast?”
She and Ron had managed to sneak a few kisses their last year of school, but then everything had exploded.   Leaving for Australia without so much as a goodbye had been in poor form.
Scrambling to gather his thoughts, he pushed up to his knees. He had to leave, and now. This was escalating horribly.
“Ron?” she called firmly in the small room.
“Oh!” he whispered, as his hips settled onto the soft cotton of Draco’s briefs.
Harry stood behind Hermione, one hand working between her legs as she melted into him.  They were both stark naked.

a satisfying blow.  The one and only time she’d punched someone, and it had been perfect.  Better than sex.
The mattress dipped, and a hot mouth latched onto the head of his cock, earning a surprised little gasp.  Draco’s fingers pulled the skin tight down his length, and Hermione’s tongue worked over the sensitive, exposed flesh.  His hips thrust forward into her mouth, sliding Draco’s cock inside him.
is rather accustomed to diurnal long sprints and several hours of strenuous flying per day,” Draco explained, sitting up in the middle of the sofa.
Scarlet lips turn in a wry smile, and Draco nods. “I’ll see you at the gala, then.”
Draco watched him patiently, but Harry just shook his head softly. They hadn’t been quiet, but he had headphones and a decent amount of focus. “It was fine, Dray, really.”
————————————
Draco takes another oyster off the plate of crushed ice and tips it into his mouth, leaning back on an elbow in the sand.  Harry watches the cold mass slick itself through Draco’s lips and tries to not gag.  Draco examines the shell while he chews for what seems like a preposterous amount of time, and flings it into the sea.
“Well, Malfoy,” he offered.  He remembered Malfoy and Ernie trading barbs in the Great Hall on numerous occasions.
“Slow, then?” Draco’s lips lay a too-chaste kiss against Harry’s neck, even as his fingertip presses into Harry’s hole.
He gasped as her finger slid right through the tight ring of muscle, and her knuckles rested against his body.  She didn’t move it, and he was grateful as his hole tightened around her finger.
Not that he was complaining. The tidiness of the bedroom and bathroom had been a very welcome surprise. Where the bedroom was dark, and soft, and hushed, the bathroom was a hard, white tile-toothed echo chamber.
“I don’t...” Draco’s words ended in a tight whine, and he pressed his lips together.

“Granger, I’m just… Not doing this.  Not tonight,” he mumbled, refilling his mug.
“And do you know what I thought about for
His hands slid down her back to cup her ass.  “There’s morning sex and muffins in it if you stay the night.”
“And then you just…” Harry quarters the potatoes with ease, and shrugs. “You just chop them up without making it into a sword fight.”
A copy of Witch Weekly sat on top of Harry’s desk, and he frowned.  There was an ominous scorched line on the cover and office smelt faintly of burnt paper.
With a grimace and two sickening, squelching pops, he had a grotesque, sightless head, and a leather bag with two, he assumed, lethal yellow eyes.  The bag sat on the table like some kind of absurd scrotal mockery.
“That’s not what he said at all!” Harry shouted.
“Yeah, okay, Mum,” she said, and the call ended.

“Looking after witches in heat is generally a collaborative effort, you know,” he warned, starting to genuinely worry how much longer he could keep up with her.
Harry smells cigarette smoke and glances up to see embers flare in a side street. Malfoy leans against a stucco building, shoulder and head resting on the gritty surface as he watches Harry.
But worst of all, Draco was grounded.  Literally.  A smaller bird could have flitted around within the sixty-foot range, but not a fucking eagle.  So, instead of spending his morning on the wing fishing, he was trapped in his home.  With an audience.  And that

Harry quirked an eyebrow at Draco as he swirled his tongue over the tip of the other man’s cock.  Draco cleared his throat and relaxed back down.  “As you were, Potter.”
He shuddered, remembering that otter appearing to die and wither after delivering its cryptic message. It had caused him as much anxiety as the message itself. More, maybe. She seemed to have no idea what a difference it made.
A small whimper fell from Draco as he stretched around the dildo.  He slid his arms under Harry’s armpits, hands on his shoulder blades, pulling him closer.  Harry’s tongue skirted Draco’s bottom lip, seeking without demanding, and Draco opened to him.

His breath hissed in as the dildo hit his prostate with each thrust, and one hand drifted down to grip his own length.  Harry's hand wrapped tight around his own cock, doing nothing to stop the throbbing ache.  Draco stroked in time to his hips movements as his face dropped back along his shoulder, blond hair dangling in the moonlight.
He ambled through the living room, tapped each of the three dildos on the head in greeting as he passed, and started a pot of coffee.  The Kneazle followed him, chirruping a salutation, likely in hopes of a treat.
that.  But it made sense.  It fit with some of the warnings Falk had given him about alcohol, and stress, and sex.  It made sense that Falk had given him advice on looking after Draco, if this is what Falk had seen.  “You said Falk didn’t show me an accurate picture.  I thought you meant he made himself look like a better boyfriend than he was.”
Maybe he was sending her a formal notice to bugger off.  An insult about her bloodline, her appearance, her general existence, and well wishes for her ambiguous future, probably.  That seemed very Malfoy.  A beautiful, biting rejection in the post.
"What happened?" she gasped, her heart rate refused to die down, "I just saw Voldermort attack one of his Death Eaters…He's angry, out for blood." Draco stared straight at her, fear now etched in his throat.
"Hm, in what way?" Harmony joined Draco on the banister, aware that her hand brushed against his. A small smile escaped her, and Harmony covered it with puffed cheeks.
"A little slow there," he laughed, giving a teasing smile. "You sure you didn't hit your head?"
"Changing," he said simply, "in the boys' locker room."
"Alright", she said, "do you know what you are wearing on your feet?" Harmony rummaged through her suitcase and pulled out the sandals she used during the summer.
"Don't you have work to do?" she asked.
"What? You haven't thought of him as anything more," Ginny laughed. "He's 18, freaking hot and single. Ah! If only he paid half as much attention to me as he does to you."
"You mean Harry Potter here?" The professor asked, leaning back against the hallway wall.
"Maybe that's just his lunch," Ron had overheard her.
"The poisons that are odorless, tasteless, and inconspicuous are the most treacherous," Draco said, still wanting to add that Leighton was raving bonkers to have a jar of that stuff in his cloak. It was certainly illegal.
"Is it because of that girl? Who is she? I do not approve of her." Mr. Malfoy grabbed his wounded arm and hissed. "I'm doing these things for your own good."
He passed three more shelves where he beheld the most beautiful sight he ever witnessed in his short almost fifteen years of life; Harry Potter on the floor writhing in agony. Harry' eyes were shut, teeth clenched issuing no sound, except for the occasional chorus of pain. Draco actually wished Collin camera boy was there, and something in the back of his mind was playing Beethoven's Fifth. Potter was at the end of his mercy, and Draco could not help but smirk a bit as he watched the boy wonder twitch.
She went to bed that night full with cake and took out the kitten socks. They were soft in her hands and she slipped a foot into one of them. Her toe felt something hard and she took off the sock to find a simple necklace with a wooden deer at the end and a note. The note read it was your mother's in Snape's precise hand writing. The wood felt smooth and was about the size of her thumb. She carefully tied the cord around her slender neck admiring it in the mirror. She wondered why Snape had something of her mother's. Well, they were still in the same year and she may have dropped it one day and he probably had kept it. It didn't matter now.
Maybe Draco's on to something.
"There is a way to complete Voldemort," Dumbledore slipped the ring on his finger, on the charred hand which poison was slowly killing him, "and maybe even a way to regain his humanity." Severus looked at the headmaster, wondering if with greatness came madness. Not like there was a difference anymore. He felt the throbbing at his own hand, like that too was a poison slowly taking away his life.
"Draco," Leighton looked at him in surprise, "I was joking. You all need to lighten up. Laughter is a cure." Draco felt his hand fall, and then fist in annoyance. Damn him. "Letting go of pain, is also a mind exercise. You have to train yourself. We will go over the base line basics on what to do when we find a wizard down and not breathing. Spells that will facilitate breathing, regulating temperature, and pumping blood to the heart. Then we will go over some advanced spells that mend bones, stitch lacerations, slow the heart, and those that keep an unbeating heart alive. Lastly we will go over potions that will put a 'stopper to death'. Any questions?" Leighton watched them expectantly. "None, alright, let's begin."
"Do you know who I am?" Harry brought her hand to her face and felt the lack of her glasses. Damn it, she thought, Damn, Damn! She sat up and Dudley's gang stepped back a bit to give their boss ample time to show off his impressive figure. Dudley was still a vast ocean, and his 'new' found talent at boxing only gave his normally rotund body a massive look.
"I'm sure that suggesting anything about your arse would be considered harassment."
"What happened back there?" Draco asked as he changed as well.
"Why is he retrieving them?" Ginny asked. They were all seated on the padded floor
"The lumos spell, I assume," Leighton said watching the tip of her wand. "Perhaps if it were darker, it would help." The light in the room dimed until all that was left was the remnants of the fading sunset. The darkness was unsettling, she wanted to see. She wanted the light. Her eyes seared on to where she thought her wand was as she repeated lumos, lumos, Lumos, LUMOS in her thoughts.
What choice? "Then why am I still a boy, what did you do to me?"
Whatever the Slytherin reactions had been to her traps, their violent behavior towards her dwindled. She knew that they weren't done, that they would undermine her in more subtle ways, but for now she had the satisfaction of showing them up. They knew that it had been her. Snape must have known it too, but none of them siad anything had happened. Theodore had bald patches in his hair for couple of days, and Crabe and Goyle scratched their head constantly like a dog with fleas, while Pansy had hot pink hair for a few days, courtesy of Harmony changing the girl's hair products into dye. But overall, she hadn't hurt anyone.
"Don't let her hear that," Blaise chuckled. "It all makes sense now. Why you are friends, why you have disobeyed your father, and why both of you have been acting so strange. At first I thought it was mental. Potter would never make a hot girl and you would never date him, but then I saw your girlfriend. I thought you hated those green eyes, but hell she's hot."
"How do you know all of this, Potter?" Blaise asked.
"If we are to be," she lowered her voice "friends, then you better change your tactics."
This wasn't supposed to happen.
Memories of the two of them flicked through his mind; Harmony in a sleek silver dress smiling up at him, Harmony holding his hand on the way to tea, Harmony launching herself at the Dark Lord, protecting him. He had to say something.
"Last time you said that, you guys forgot. No, I'm sticking around," Ginny said. She cut off Draco's next retort, saying, "if you don't like it, invite one of your friends."
"Legillimens," Draco said and dove into her mind. It was as if all of her emotions were like an open book, that Draco could flip through. All he had to do was know where to look. He wanted to know what she thought of him. As he dug for that, he noticed that some of her memories slipped from his grasp, and he almost had to force his way into the heart of them. Draco saw a memory of Harmony and him played before him. He watched as she, as Harry Potter, watched him in potions class. She was sitting near him, and the Draco that was next to her had his finger on the book, and telling her instructions which she wasn't listening to. It was like looking at himself from a photograph, as if certain things that she liked, she stared longer at. He could feel the emotion coming off of her, this was a peaceful memory, and soon it dissolved from around him, either from it ending or from Harmony forcing him away. He hadn't known that she stared at him during potions. He had only thought that she was in her own little la la land, but he smiled now. It seemed like Harmony was trying to push his mind away, faintly like a huff of annoyed breath.
"That Potter boy that attends St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys?"
"Sir?"
"What are you talking about?" he asked, "I think your making stuff up in your head." Then why are you holding my hand? She wanted to yell into the night. Maybe she was driving herself mental.
"Nah," she said softly, allowing her red hair to cover part of her eyes, "I'm just happy that I can be this close to you. I always wanted to be." Ginny gave a half smile, "It hurts though, giving up my feelings," Ginny gave a light chuckle. "What am I saying? Silly me."
Draco brushed passed her meager defense and went further. He wanted to know more, almost like a man who had never tasted something as rich as wine. He saw Harmony as a boy looking inside a mirror with two people staring and waving at him. He felt Harmony's longing fill him, as he looked at what Draco realized were her parents. He placed the memory where he found it and felt Harmony's loneliness linger on to him. Draco almost wanted the girl to fight him before he took something from her that he shouldn't.
"I just wanted to be with you," Draco looked down at his hands.
Snape deliberately took a long pause before shuffling some F marked papers on his desk and putting away his suitcase. "Oh yes, I did see her, didn't I," Snape mussed.
"So, what are you doing here, Harmony?" Ginny asked, "is it to cheer Draco on?" Harmony sat next to the girls and decided that going as Harmony had not been as good of idea as she had previously thought.
"I have one rule," Leighton said, "don't use what I teach against another student." Leighton looked down at Ron and shrugged, "Do you know what happens to students who break the rule, Ronald?" Ron whimpered at the man's feet. "That's three hundred muggle push ups. Starting now." Ron's face was beginning to lose color. When the binds fell from his body, he jerked and sat up shakily. Draco couldn't help but smirk as Ron began to sputter incoherent words.
"How do you know?" she asked, knowing that he may be the only one to have figured it out.
Draco could only catch Harmony with his eyes from afar. The rock music turned to a soft waltz tune, and Draco involuntarily edged his way towards her. He admired the short lilac dress that hugged her body, and tugged at his senses. Her wondered how her hair danced in curls to her shoulders, and he wanted to pull off the mask she wore that had flowers concealing her scar. He couldn't look away. She was beautiful.
"I am pleased that no one has died in my absence," professor Snape said slowly. Maybe this year he would not suffer from any severe migraines. "Class, we will start by examining your level- by making the calming draught on the board." His brow met in concentration, black hair curtained around hollow cheeks. Students wondered if his silence meant that they should start. He at last let out a slow calculated nod as his eyes migrated from cool gray to vivid green. "But you will not be using the partners sitting next to you." Many of the students' eyes scattered about for possible candidates more than tolerable. "Which I will be picking," he enjoyed their stunned looks of silence.
Harmony shoved her clothes into her locker, and flattened her hair with her hands. "You look good in a tank top." Harmony turned to him and lifted an eyebrow. Thankfully he was fully clothed. He must have been referring to yesterday considering the over sized shirt covered the most of her.
Harmony chewed her bottom lip, unaware that she would make them appear pinker and swollen. He did not stop watching her. She was so tempted to lift her leg and kick him in the chest, but she could not. She could only narrow her eyes in annoyance and fold her arms in front of her chest. "What do you want from me?" she sighed. Why was he doing this, it just didn't make sense. Was this a game to him, to get her angry so then they could fight.
"Professor Dumbledore, what does the prophecy mean?" And why did it involve him being female?
"I want to," he said, and Harmony regarded him closely with her green eyes.
"Hello professor," Harry said, trying not to glare at the other man.
"I'm glad," Blaise smirked. They neared the dinning hall doors and Draco saw that Harmony was holding out the doors for some ravenclaws. He had to stop from flashing her a smile. She caught his eye before letting go of the doors. "Potter's also changed." Blaise watched Draco, "he makes me not want to turn him into a punching bag. You guys are friends I've heard."
"Now Potter, this potion will make you slumber for a whole 24 hours and you may feel a slight tingling as you are immobile." Snape's sneer tripled Harry's misgivings. Snape really did have a sadistic side, but Harry uncapped the potion and downed it with a grimace from the rancid taste. Snape definitely made it as inedible as possible, and he almost could feel the mélange of little chunks of miscellaneous animal parts. As the last of the potion slipped down his throat, his eyelids leaden with sleep and he blacked out from the world.
"Quick, someone do something!" Neville nearly shouted. Fred and George ran over from wherever they had been to watch their brother duke it out with a salivated ball of food.
"So for the fox, what would we use to mend the bone?"
"So what's your name?"
"Sure. I'll see you at dinner." She faltered in her steps. I'll see you at Hogsmeade shimmered through her steps.
"So really, how was your summer, we want to know everything." Hermione said with a smile.
"No!" Kreacher croaked like a dying toad and pointed his finger at the man.
"Then I would Animum Quiesce it, and slow its heart beat, all the while thinking very hard that it is a mouse and will need much more controlled magic."
"Harmony," Draco stepped in front of her, "your hands." She hadn't noticed that they were shaking, and she clenched them into fists.
"But you look so happy," Blaise said, "and I'm bored of sour company."
"Technically, you don't need much," Ginny put some glittering eye shadow and black eye liner across Harmony's eye lids much like that of a cat. Next the mascara thickened her eye lashes, and Ginny added a touch of blush. "See we are done," she said, and sprayed her body with something that smelled like a tea shop over her head. "You don't have piercings, but a necklace will be fine."
"Pff, right," Harmony itched with a happiness that she wasn't used to. "Maybe," she laughed.
"What was that?" Harmony asked. She picked at the locket further, but it was stuck. "Strange it won't open."
"Do any of you feel something making you feel at home?" the Professor asked with a wide smile.
"Oh Harry," Ginny said from two seats away, "You have to go. Tell Professor Snape to shove his detentions elsewhere, because you have more important things to do."
As it turned out, Ginny couldn't have the locket longer than two days before the girl started going ape shite on everyone. When she had over heard Ron tell Hermione that he thought this was the worse he had ever seen her PMS, two women had him glued and hexed, and Ron learned the hard way about female related tact. Luna on the other hand, was immediately crossed out from locket bearer. The moment it hung around her neck, her eyes rolled back and she went into a trance. In fact, when her mouth opened, she began to prophesize. "The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking more than your blood. He will steal everything from you. Death is at knife point, waiting to carve out your heart. The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking…seeking…seeking…" Harmony jumped when she heard that, remembering those same words from Trelawny, right before she had switched into magical fitness. Ginny, Draco, and Harmony stared at the girl when the locket was safely removed. "Well," Luna said, "that was certainly peculiar."
"Harmony," Ginny nit her brow. "I'd rather you tell me that you need to keep it secret, then you telling me outright lies. I understand though." Ginny went to get up, but Harmony grabbed her sleeve.
"There's only one broom!" Harmony grumbled as the red head had jerked the broom up.
"Remember, Snape taught me," she said and he laughed.
Pain seared her scar, as the touch upon her skin became corrosive. She looked up in shock, into the swirling blood eyes. Ropes held her body to a gravestone. "You are mine."
"Alright, well done," Snape said, "50 points to Slytherin." Harmony stopped in mid strike, realizing that it was the first time Snape had ever rewarded points to her before. Maybe her mum was right, Snape wasn't so bad after all.
"I am not your enemy. It was wrong of me to brawl with you because of where I stood."
"I used to think it did, but now I realize that the gender was not the important part, but what makes the prophecy substantial is you Harry. What you have become. You have a choice to act and save these people, it's a lot to ask for and do."
Draco stood close to her, ignoring the fact that she was Harry Potter. "What did you think of the game?" He loomed over her.
"Stop it." Ron scolded as his cheeks turned to a flaming red hue, much to the twin's utter glee. They rested an elbow on each side of Ron's shoulders.
"What," he said, feeling the hurt steal away his happiness, "why not?"
"I wanted to see," Harmony paused, "Professor Snape." Draco chuckled, he knew that she was lying. He smiled smugly as he patted the chair next to him.
Harmony waited for Ginny and Luna, and hoped that they wouldn't mention how close Leighton had gotten to her. She was wrong as Ginny grabbed on to her arm and leaned into her. "That was something," Luna said, as she skipped next to them. Harmony closed the door and didn't look back to see if Leighton was still there.
"Not that one then." Ginny remarked, tucking it away out of sight. It wasn't that Harmony had never worn a bikini before. Last summer in Brazil, she had a lot of good times in a bikini. But that was different somehow. These were people that she saw every day in school, and what she liked to think of as her real life. "How about this one then?" Ginny asked, holding out a white one that looked a little less scary. Harmony frowned at it, until Ginny remarked, ""it's alright if you don't want to, we can just go back and tell-" Harmony shook her head, took the white bathing suit and stepped into the loo to change.
"Do you want another photo?" he asked, and Harmony laughed.
Twenty minutes later as they were standing in front of Harmony's vault at Gringotts, Draco looked at the fat pyramids of Galleons with his mouth literally hanging open.
"Yeah, but the rest of the Hogwarts population doesn't know that."
There on the windowsill pearing through were two almond brown eyes and a pale white face. She jumped in shock, and it gave a series of hoots in response. It was a barred owl with creamy white and tan mottled feathers that glowed in the earlier morning light. One of its talons was outstretched with a note tied to it. The window creaked open, allowing a waft of cool air to pass her frame, and she untied the small parchment. She was glad that this owl had not pecked at her with its small yellow beak. The note looked freshly written, with ink that had not fully dried; she looked down at the parchment.
"Oh," Harmony looked around the room before seeing an extended rope hanging well above a massive pool. "Please tell me we aren't swimming."
After Lucious had a word with a woman at the front desk, Harmony was rushed to a private room, where immediate care was provided to her. Draco took a seat in the room and silently watched as the medi-wizards worked on Harmony. He was numb. Most of it he knew would hit him later, and he would deal with that when the time came for it.
With her shirt front open and her back to him, Harmony pulled off her shirt. She knew that he must have been staring, but it was only her back that he was seeing. It hardly mattered if a few bra straps were showing. Harmony quickly pulled on a tank top and an over sized gray shirt before kicking off her shoes and starting on her pants. She had them off and replaced with a pair of black shorts in a few seconds and shoved all of her clothes in her locker. She slammed the door and passed a gaping Draco without a word. When she stepped out of the changing room, she put a hand on her pulsating heart and set her glasses on her now boyish face.
She had not expected to see him, not so soon at least. Draco Malfoy opened the sliding door without so much as a knock and looked passed the distrusting faces of her friends to a very disgruntled looking Harry Potter. Thankfully, she didn't get the urge to stare at his lips and wish for something more. Instead a cool dread permeated through her, and she sat frozen against the glass.
"Michael, you are right. I do care more about Harry than I do about you." Ginny twisted her arm free, but not before she read the angry and disbelief clear in his face. She knew that she had hurt him, but she needed to know that Harmony was okay.
"Was it about Cedric?" Ron asked.
"Don't you have somewhere to go or someone else to bother?" Her eyes narrowed wondering what he wanted.
"A girl can hope," Ginny smiled, "and maybe eventually he'll see something special right in front of him." They neared the common room and Harmony hugged Ginny.
"Or I can ask Dobby to apparate us there," Harmony said.
"Hello dear, is something the matter?" Pomfrey said as she strode past rows of house-elf clean medical beds. She stopped, taking in the scene of a very unconscious Harry Potter, carried in the arms of a very conflicted looking Draco Malfoy. (It was a good thing Draco did not bring Harry in ten minutes earlier, spasmodically twitching with his eyes rolled back) "Good heavens!"
"Not before you get held back a year," Draco said.
When Draco found out where they were, he wished that they were miles into the open sea, with sharks included. There was nothing below his feet supporting him. They had portkeyed alongside a cliff and had just missed the surface by five feet. Miles and miles of open air separated them from the ground. "Oh my God!" Draco yelled, and he had no time to curse out the Professor who deserved to drop dead. Because at that moment, that was precisely what was happening. Gravity was a cruel bitch sometimes.
"Ginny, are you alright?" She looked over at the tall form of Blaise Zabini as he leaned against the stone halls next to her.
Harmony was entirely conscious of the occupant behind her, and though he was at the same distance as Ron had been if he were there, Draco was much too close. She felt a touch to her side as he strayed a hand there. At once all her focus drifted. That hand radiated heat through her, spilling into her thoughts. She wondered what that hand would feel like against her own. Rough, hard, or firm? She bit the inside of her cheek, hoping to slow her breaths, her embarrassment, and her heart. When that touch left, the feeling did not.
They arrived at the flat and Harmony stripped off the pale pink cloak that was supposed to mark her as a girl, or a flamboyant transvestite for that matter. She was glad that the flat allowed her a private room and washroom, and she dragged her trunk to the foot of her bed. It was only four in the afternoon and McGonagall wanted her to shop for proper clothes to fit a young lady.
"You can't lose something you never had, Hermione," Ron smirked. They gathered their belongings almost ready to head out.
"Oh man Harry," Ron shuddered, "that man is pure evil. Remember that detention he gave us. That was bloody awful. He made me clean each cauldron inside out, with my hands! I don't want to know what he makes you do, I feel so terrible."
Draco was no master tracker able to see all the vestiges left from students, but he had a way of finding Potter. He knew that Potter and his gang were at the end of the train, and Draco saw red. The Weasley family practically swamped the train, with their disgusting red hair.
She hadn't heard a student pass for awhile, and Harmony unlocked her room, to poke her head out. There wasn't a single Gryffindor in sight, and Harmony went as fast as her high heeled legs could go. She made it to the portrait and went through with relief.
"Whatever," Harmony said, and let the subject drop. She remembered to put on her Potter mask.
"That's all?" she chewed on the inside of her check trying to look at the papers in Draco's hands.
"Remember you can walk out of my door anytime you wish. Even if you don't believe me, it's still going to be true."
"Shut up." The outer layer of his uniform fell to the floor, and he grasped the material of his gray vest and continued to pull it over his head. The collared white shirt remained to soak up the trails of water. The water heated, torrid to his touch, and flushed his skin.
Her eyes opened. Book, she thought. She got up from her bed and cast down the silencing charms. Maybe Voldemort was in the Department of Mysteries for a book. She wasn't so sure about that, but Harmony needed to go to someone who knew the Department of Mysteries, or find a way to get into the Dark Lord's mind. She shuddered at that thought, and wondered why she had thought that in the first place. She could recall what Snape had told her that Voldemort could go into her mind through the connection they shared. But couldn't she go into his mind then? She had made progress with Occlumency, she could divert Snape from her mind when he was invading her most personal memories. She had to find out if she could enter Voldemort's mind, without him knowing. But would Snape even help her with that.
"For a moment there I thought that I would have to make excuses for your untimely death," Draco whispered. "Should you go to the nurse or something…"
"Just let me get the last bit of information, and then you may get what you need." He pointed at Harmony. It was surreal that no one knew her name, that she was essentially no one and that if this even got in the paper, it would be lucky to be on the seventh page.
"No!" Harmony jolted in her armchair, her jaw moving before her exhausted brain could. "I was with..er..Dumbledore! Yeah." She whispered, happy with her answer.
A Malfoy's Worst Fear
"He's so dead," Ginny muttered. They looked at the cliff that they would have to scale and Harmony frowned. Did any of them even have the upper body strength that it would take to reach the top? He doubted it. But then again, representing the only boy entitled him to at least be able to make it the furthest. Luna joined them from the girls' changing room with her hair swinging in a pony tail.
"There is so much negative energy in that necklace, you shouldn't wear it too long." Draco frowned at the two girls occupying his space, because now he couldn't see what Leighton was pulling.
"My God!" Harmony nearly shouted, "Where's Ginny!" Harmony, Luna, and Draco looked between their feet to the ground below. There was no way that she could have survived. They then looked up, and Ginny was no where. Draco could picture the red head reaching out for the ledge of the cliff, and her arms snapping when she made contact. It wasn't a pleasant image. "Leighton!" she screamed, "Ginny's gone!" Draco was surprised to see the fear in Harmony's eyes. It didn't make sense to him.
"Fighting," Harmony instantly replied, "right, Malfoy!" Draco lifted a brow.
"I don't know," Draco said. Snape's eyes were unwavering.
Alone again, Draco fisted the robes where Harmony had gripped not five minutes ago. Draco hit the green padded seat with the bottom of his fist. How could she? He had poured out his heart only for her to trample on. He hadn't done anything wrong.
"I'm going in there," Draco said, refusing to be in the side lines, "and you should too, if you care about her so much." Ginny shot him a glare before stuffing the ear into her robe pocket.
I'll see you at Hogsmeade.
"Why?" Draco asked.
Harmony sighed at his hopelessness, and then remembered that she too did not know any such spell. "Then I guess that you will just have to go as you are."
"We've been trying for over a year, and you convince her to go out on a trip!" Fred whacked another cushion across Charlie's face.
"I need help finding a present for Hermione," he whispered, but they both knew that Hermione was smart enough to guess what words they were exchanging. "Just you and me," he said with a wink. Harmony swallowed the remark that she held, and nodded back at him. Ron gave a pleased look, and turned his attention back to Hermione.
"Michael, now's not the time, I need to go." Ginny snapped at him.
"I don't know, it just popped up as I was going around the halls back and forth, wondering what I wanted."
"This is so weird," Draco said as the people took no notice of them. He seemed to be enjoying himself very much, and when they got far enough, she pulled the cloak away and changed back into Harry.
"What's new about that?" Ginny asked with her quill tickling her nose. "You got about a thousand of them."
"Code names, professor?" Ginny asked with a raised brow.
"Oh that," Harmony stated, regarding it as if for the first time. "Diamond I guess."
"Draco," Ginny said, stopping him on his way to potions class. "I need to talk to you."
Unforgivable curses whispered enticingly in her mind, and as if Mr. Malfoy could hear her, he turned to the girl. His eyes widened, as she shot a spell that struck his face and left a laceration there. His face twisted into a mask of loathing, and the sickening vengeance enraptured her.
Harmony wasn't quite sure if the advance guard of Moody, Lupin, the purple haired Tonks, Emmeline, Sturgis, Hestia, Kingsley, McGonagall, Severus and Sirius in dog form were quite necessary for the short trip from Diagon Alley, to some house nearby in London. But so it was that this party of eleven ventured off. The distance was actually so short that they traveled the muggle way, the ten guard members staring at the unfortunate muggles on board like they were about to suddenly sprout fangs to bite Harmony's head off. There was a slight misunderstanding about whether large shaggy dogs were allowed on public buses, which was neatly sorted out with a pinch of strange green powder that made the bus driver smile wide and focus intently on driving. After the first stop several suddenly smiling muggles realized that it was time to get off the bus. It was a good thing they chose to do so, because after the third minute, Moody began getting antsy, his eye swiveling erratically, mumbling in a mostly incomprehensible fashion. Harmony picked out the occasional word such as "death," "impending doom" and "impalement."
