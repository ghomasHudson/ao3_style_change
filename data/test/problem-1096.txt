“I’m not fighting dragons! It’s a lightsaber.” The boy held up the branch pointedly. “I’m Thomas. Who are you?”
“Something like that. Just make sure to drink plenty of water. Oh, and don’t skip any meals even if you’re not hungry.”
“This changes nothing you know. I still plan on kicking your ass this season. That cup is as good as mine,” Draco mumbled into his pillow.
As they walked through the woods looking for the magical mushroom, the other boys paired off and Draco found himself to be the odd man out once again. While he scanned the forest floor for the tell-tale red cap, he could hear the other boys talking and laughing in the distance.
. Did they sleep together? Draco could hardly remember anything from last night. He was completely screwed. He stumbled into the bathroom and dug through his toiletry bag. He had gone without them for months but if there was ever a time when he needed an extra pick me up this was it.

Draco made himself a plate of food but he stuck with water and was surprised to see Harry do the same.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Stop that. I’m firing you from cleaning duty before you start reorganizing my pantry.”
Draco hopped into the shower to get ready for the day. A few minutes in, Draco felt the effect take hold. He watched the water runoff his fingers and brought his hand up to look. It was mesmerizing. He could see every line, every bit of discolouration. His brain was racing.
He wasn’t sure how to process this new piece of information, the fact that yes, Lucius could be a good father when he wanted to be. And fuck, that name… Eltanin, the brightest star in the Draco constellation. What the fuck was that supposed to mean? Was it his father’s way of honouring his long lost son or just replacing him? Or maybe it had nothing to do with Draco at all?
Draco and Potter both pulled up at the last second, narrowly avoiding a nasty collision with the ground. It was an impressive feat of flying executed perfectly by both seekers but with one key difference, Potter was holding the snitch.
“I’m not trying to start a fight. I’ve wanted to bring it up for a while now. I’m worried about you, Draco.”
“Yeah, but I don’t go to school here, my mom is a professor and I get to spend summers with her. I live in Nantes with my dad.”
Great Britain received a 30 point penalty for Draco’s play so they had some ground to make up for. Draco ran some assists and screens, shielding his teammates from the other players. The entire time he kept watch on Krum, but it seemed the snitch was nowhere to be seen. Draco thanked his lucky stars.
And so Draco used the summer to practice, mimicking the other boys’ behaviour. He told jokes, incurred favours, pretended to be interested in whatever his “friends” liked. And it seemed to work, Draco became more and more popular among the group.
Holyhead Harpies. Draco couldn't really figure out what Blaise did for a living. As far as he could tell Blaise just travelled the world and met other interesting people.
Running and working out helped keep his head clear and gave him something to do that wasn’t drink or get high. But flying, flying just made Draco think about all the ways he had failed. Then in May, Pansy told Draco that she’d gotten him a meeting with the owner of the Falmouth Falcons. The Falcons were at the bottom of the rankings, lower than the Cannons, but they had recently been bought out by a new owner who was committed to turning things around.
Pansy had stopped worrying about him so much now that his grades had improved and he was no longer moping around. They still hung out all the time but Pansy was an independent kind of person and she liked her space, which meant that Draco often found himself with nothing to do and no one to entertain him. Pansy suggested he join a club or find a hobby.
. Right. The only talent I have is making others believe I have worth. It’s just an act, all of it. In school, I tricked everyone into thinking I was naturally smart and gifted. And now, now I have everyone believing I’m some kind of quidditch prodigy. I’m not. I almost lost that game against Portugal,” Draco laughed as realization dawned on him, “and tomorrow Krum is going to beat me again. I’m fast, so what? Krum is ruthless. He is going to decimate me on that pitch and I’m just as much of a fool as the rest of them for believing I ever stood a chance.”
Asim looked confused for a moment before grinning. “Well I don’t know about you, but I was hoping more of this,” he pressed a kiss to Draco’s neck, “and this,” another to his check, “and this,” he pressed the final kiss against Draco’s lips.
Pansy apparated away and Draco cleaned up again. He wandered around the rest of the flat. He hadn’t taken much of it in last night. It was very nice. An exposed brick wall took up one half of the living room. There was also a fireplace that Draco assumed was hooked up to the floo network. The ceiling reached up to the second floor and a large skylight looked up to a canopy of trees. A set of art deco windows looked out onto a shared terrace. Upstairs was Pansy’s room and the guest room that Draco now occupied.
After lunch, Draco would often play in his mother’s gardens. He would climb trees, collect rocks, or play games of make-believe. His favourite game to play involved his imaginary friend, Nicolas. They were explorers travelling the globe and cataloguing their adventures together.
Once everyone was seated, Professor Dubois introduced himself to the class. He had come to Beauxbâtons after finishing his thesis on the podorozhnik plant in Siberia. Draco idly imagined what it would be like to explore the expanse of mountains, rivers, and taiga that stretched across northern Russia, studying plants and writing papers. It sounded wonderful. He wondered if Professor Dubois had seen the aurora borealis while he was there, as a child Draco had always dreamed of seeing one of the auroras. Draco caught himself before his thoughts drifted too far away and focused back in on Professor Dubois as he went over the class syllabus.
. So Draco kept himself out of sight as much as possible. His favourite spots to read were the linen closet on the third floor, behind the shed at the back of the property, and between the crook of two large branches of an oak tree that overlooked the yard. He spent all his free time reading alone and that was just how he liked it.
“I was damaged long before I meet you. My father knew it, that’s why he didn’t want anything to do with me. You tried to fix me once already and look where we ended up.” Draco gestured to the empty corridor. “I’m sorry Potter, but you’re just going to have to find someone else to be your pet project because I can’t anymore. Turns out everyone else had the right idea all along and I’m done trying to prove them wrong. I give up.”
“Look Draco, I told you when I took you in that you could stay as long as you needed and I meant it.”
When Father had told him he was being sent to boarding school, Draco could not have imagined anything so horrid as this.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” said Pansy. “If you want to play quidditch then play quidditch. I’m sure that one of the teams has an opening for next year.”
Draco took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down, there was no use getting worked up over things that hadn’t happened yet. “Thank you, Tibby. I’ll go to see him now.”
It wasn’t too long after his conversation with Dorian that Draco caught sight of the snitch. It was hovering near the centre in a gap between the other players. Draco took off at speed knowing Krum had done the same. Krum had an edge since he was dive-bombing the snitch from above, but Draco was slightly closer in positioning. As the snitch took off it became a neck and neck race between the two.
The man who spoke was younger than any of the other professors Draco had met. Draco had a hard time judging adults’ ages, but he figured the man couldn’t be older than thirty. He had short kinky curls, dark brown skin, and a crooked smile. He was carrying a large cardboard box, that from the sound of it was filled with glass bottles of some sort, and a brown leather briefcase.
“You could stay, you know,” Harry spoke softly so that Draco could ignore it if he wished. He didn’t, turning from the door back to Harry. “It’s a big bed and I don’t mind sharing-- Just sleep of course,” Harry hastily added.
Professor Dubois had stayed behind this year, so Draco picked back up the habit of studying in his office. Occasionally he would go on walks in the forest with Professor Dubois and they would gather different plants and just talk.
“Must have been quite a relief to attend Beauxbâtons. But you didn’t join the quidditch team until your sixth year. Why is that?”
Lucius pushed past the elf and set off at a brisk pace. With a wave of nonverbal magic the nursery door violently swung open. Narcissa looked up from her place beside the crib with surprise and Draco began to cry. Narcissa stood and clutched her son to her chest in an attempt to comfort him. Lucius muttered a quick
As much as he hated to admit it, Draco noticed a difference in his speed and reflexes since the last match he was in. Had it really been only a few weeks? Harry certainly wasn’t going easy on him but Draco found that he had no problem keeping up.
Draco quickly switched to washing his hands, his eyes darting automatically to the intruder’s reflection in the mirror. What he had not expected to see was a girl confidently walking to one of the stalls. Draco panicked. Had he gone to the girl’s bathroom by accident? Impossible. It was in the entirely opposite direction. Maybe this girl had been hit with a
At first, he thought that there had been a mistake and he was about to say as much, but then he caught sight of his name written plainly across the front and the return address in the corner,
A few days later Draco had finished a new book and gained a new friend. As soon as he had finished the novel he had gone to find Asim and they had stayed up into the night talking about their favourite parts and the characters.
Those words made Draco perk up a little. He did enjoy collecting favours and this would be an entire quidditch team worth of favours. Plus it would mean more flying, already Draco was eager to climb back on a broom. Draco made up his mind then that he would do it, but he wanted to really drag it out.
He took a moment to take stock of his situation. The tuition money wouldn’t cover his books, supplies, uniforms, or wand. Perhaps he could make some sort of arrangement with the school, they could loan him what he needed and then he could pay them back after graduation or he could provide some kind of labour after classes, like cleaning or tutoring. Draco was sure that there were other students who couldn’t afford everything so there had to be some sort of system in place. He would write back to the school and find out what it was.
“We’ll never know that, will we?” He shifted over. “I talked to Coach and the owners, the Tornadoes won’t be renewing your contract for next season.”
They went to the dorms next, and Mr Barker showed Draco where he would sleep. All the boys lived on the third floor and were housed four to a room. The space was clean and utilitarian. It was large enough to fit two bunk beds with a chest of drawers at the foot of each and four small desks along the walls. A window in the centre of the room kept the space from feeling claustrophobic. Draco noted there were no locks on any of the drawers or on the bedroom door itself. No matter, it wasn’t as if Draco had brought anything of value anyways. Just a few basic clothes, some books, his journal, and a photograph of his mother that Tibby had spelled still. He had to leave his more magical possessions at home.
Harry contorted himself to reach into his bedside table. He pulled out a glass vile and shuffled back over to Draco. He tried unlacing Draco’s trousers but kept fumbling it. “What do wizards have against zippers anyway,” he pouted.
Was this man for real? Draco moved to leave but was held back by a hand gripping his upper arm. The hand quickly retracted but it was enough to give Draco pause. It was probably best to just let Potter say whatever it was he wanted to say then Draco could get out of here.
That night all the teams celebrated, winners and losers. Draco was thoroughly enjoying himself. It had been a while since he had been this drunk and on hard liquor no less, it would seem the Russian weren’t much for wine.
“What’s that?” Pansy asked as if she hadn’t planned this since the moment Draco had opened his door.
“Wow,” he paused. “Well, I actually came over here because our seeker just got injured and can’t play out the rest of the season. We would be lucky if we could get you to sub.”
“Sorry,” Draco said. “Carry on slaying your dragons or whatever it was you were doing. I’ll find another place to study.”
“I didn’t say you were.” Pansy turned back to Draco then, it appeared she had seen everything she needed to. “You were quite difficult to track down, you know.”
As a seeker he had reign of the entire pitch, looking out over the chaos below him. That was when he saw it, just a flicker in the air. He would have dismissed it as nothing more than a trick of the light if he hadn’t been looking for it, but as it was there was no mistaking it. Draco shot off like a bolt of lightning. He kept his eyes on his target and didn’t let it out of his sight. The other seeker was still hovering on the pitch, and didn’t notice Draco until it was too late.
a party. Do try and have fun.” Finwick started to walk away. “But not too much fun, yeah? We still have that game against Pride tomorrow.”
He went over to investigate and was surprised to find a kid who didn’t look more than nine years old. He had wavy brown hair and a light complexion. The kid was making strange noises and swinging a branch around. Draco watched for a moment reminded of his own games of make-believe as a child.
She had grown her hair out since the last time he’d seen her and was wearing an expensive tailored dress beneath her robes. Draco wondered how she had managed to walk through the snow in those heels. While Draco was still busy processing this development, Pansy pushed her way into the house as if she owned the place. She began looking around at the trash and liquor bottles that decorated every surface.
Draco put on his mental armour as he left the apartment and tried to put stupid Potter and his stupid comments out of his head. It didn’t work and Draco was a second behind everyone else during the match.
Pansy was already on the phone talking to a client. She gestured to a plate of toast and a bottle of orange juice and Draco poured himself a glass. He wished he had some champagne to go with it. Just enough to make his headache go away. Instead he sat down at the table and started on his toast. Pansy hung up the phone and turned to Draco.
Draco kept his eye out for Theban script carved into the stonework, which was used to mark the passages to the Place Confiné. His letter had provided detailed instructions and he was able to locate the entrance to Rue Roscelin without much difficulty.
Draco felt his heart racing as he drew closer to the snitch. The adrenaline rush was unlike anything he had ever felt and as his hand enclosed around the ball he was overcome with a sense of accomplishment, pride, and joy.
They ended up eating dinner together too, mostly because Draco wasn’t sure he had the energy to find his own dinner. Instead of quidditch, the dinner conversation shifted over to other topics. Harry talked about his godfather Sirius Black and Sirius’ partner, Remus Lupin, who had raised Harry after his third year in school. That started turning the gears in Draco’s head, if Harry’s guardians were gay that might explain why he had been so comfortable with the idea of sex with Draco the other night. As the conversation continued, Draco told Harry about the latest book he was reading. Harry wasn’t much of a reader himself but he listened attentively as Draco talked about a plot involving unrequited love, not fitting in, and spiders.
“That doesn’t count. Those were just seekers games.” Harry paused. “People think that all the seeker has to worry about is getting the snitch, but that’s not true. There are so many things going on at any given moment during a quidditch game. A truly great seeker always has the bigger picture in mind whenever they’re on the pitch. I always get too absorbed in looking for the snitch, but you… I am pretty sure you know exactly what the other players are going to do before they do.”
It wasn’t until March that Draco realized, for the first time, he had a real true friend. Pansy had wormed her way into Draco’s life and he was surprised to find that he genuinely cared about her opinions, thoughts, and feelings. He couldn’t have been happier.
Potter actually had the gall to use his first name. Something must have slipped past Draco’s mask, because Potter quickly corrected his mistake.
As they pulled away from each other, Draco looked at Harry’s ridiculously goofy grin and knew his own face looked the same. Draco had never been happier.
The night before the match, the team went out for an early dinner together. And for a change of pace, Draco decided to join them. Their energy was contagious and Draco was surprised to discover that he was actually excited for tomorrow and not a bundle of nerves.
Draco was nervous as hell and his mind was racing. He wasn’t even sure he wanted to play quidditch anymore, but he wasn’t sure what else to do. He had given it a lot of thought in the past few weeks. Maybe Dubois would be willing to be his thesis adviser and he could get his mastery in Herbology. But what then? Draco had no interest in teaching nor did he particularly want to work for a potions manufacturer as an ingredients expert. Perhaps he could travel the world and collect magical plants for wholesale, though that would require some capital for start-up and capital was something Draco didn’t have. Which brought him back to quidditch.
And Draco would, he knew he would, but he still felt like he didn’t deserve her. She was waiting for an answer now and there was only one that she would find acceptable. “Okay.”
He woke up in his own bed for the first time in days, the late morning sun shining through the curtains. He showered and shaved and picked over his reflection in the mirror. He looked terrible, skin pale and sickly with a red flush in his cheeks. A couple cosmetic spells helped out but couldn’t erase the exhaustion entirely.
As the other first-years arrived Draco watched their parents fuss over them and say their goodbyes. A few of the other boys already seemed to know each other and gathered together in the corner. One of them glanced over at Draco and said something to his friends. They all looked over and laughed. Draco snarled. It wasn’t fair. He knew how he looked with his old muggle uniform and terrible haircut, but that wasn’t him. He was supposed to be their equal, at the very least, but here he was stuck in a faded grey jumper, worn-out trousers, and not a sickle to his name.
Though Draco wasn’t upset about it, he reflexively put on a pouty face and scoffed because he knew that’s what Potter expected him to do. “Weren’t you?”
As the months went by, Draco’s situation did not improve. He clearly didn’t belong here and the other boys knew it. They teased him about his name, his accent, the way he walked, how he sat. They said he spent too much time in front of the mirror and that his handwriting was too girly. Frankly, Draco was surprised they didn’t find something to criticize about the way he breathed. Not that Draco cared, of course. What did the opinions of a few muggles matter?
“You aren’t going to need that today. Flying isn’t your problem right now, you are as fast as you’ve ever been. But you’ve lost your endurance and your reaction time is shit. We need to build up your core strength.”
“No, that is quite alright. I believe I have everything I need. Draco, it was a pleasure to meet you.” And with that Ms Skeeter showed herself out.
Asim laughed. “Of course. I am sure you found Dany to be extremely relatable - mysterious, attractive, blonde.”
It was strange to be at the school with so few people. There was one other first-year that stayed behind with Draco, but she was a girl and spent most of her time with a couple of second and third-years. There were also a handful of sixth-years that stayed to work on independent study programs or get ahead in their classes.
, have we been having the same conversation? If you were truly worried about me you would be around more.”
The next day he was feeling a bit better. He was still tired but he wanted to get out of the house. Draco was pretty sure he was going stir crazy. Pansy took him out shopping as a distraction and they went on a walk in the park. When they got home, Pansy stayed up with him and they played cards until one o’clock in the morning.
Wanting to crawl into bed with a hangover potion and maybe a bloody mary or two, Draco ended the match quickly.
Draco continued. “I did stop once… after my father died. I went overboard and I got myself clean. I don’t think I can do it this time though. I still had quidditch then. Now, I have nothing.”
When Draco had imagined this moment he had wondered if he would cry, but there were no tears. Instead, he laughed. It was an awful sort of feeling. He thought he would have felt free, at least, but he didn’t. He still felt the need to prove himself to his father, he supposed that had been ingrained in him so deeply he would never be free of it. A wave of nausea passed over him. He reached inside and let his magic calm him.
“I don’t mean to offend, mind you. The last owner, Mr Moore always had a soft spot for the players no one else seemed to want. Justin over here was ranked as one of the top ten chasers for over a decade but the moment he turned thirty-four no one wanted him, never mind the fact that he still had some good years left in him.” He looked over at Justin teasingly. “We’ll see if he’s got another one left in him this year.”
“With skills like that it doesn’t matter. I could totally teach you the rules, the game isn’t that complicated really, and it would just be for one match - two if we win.”
That first day Draco had expected Thomas to hunt him down and drag him off to play like he had last year, but the entire day passed without so much as a sighting of the other boy. At dinner, Draco shot him a look from across the room but Thomas only averted his eyes and ducked his head. Something weird was going on. That whole first week Thomas seemed to be avoiding Draco, and Draco couldn’t figure out what he had done wrong. Maybe Thomas had sent him a letter that had got lost in the mail and thought Draco didn’t want to talk to him anymore? But why wouldn’t he just say something?
Draco couldn’t fault her logic, actually he was kind of impressed. He debated for a moment if he should leave, but that felt too much like a retreat so he went back to applying his cosmetic charms.
“So what? You’re just going to give up? Drop out of school and stack boxes for a living. Sorry to be the one to tell you this but you wouldn’t make it through a day of manual labour.”
He ignored the other boys, he would have to make up for it later, but at the moment there was nothing he could do. It was almost time for the portkey anyway. They got into position surrounding the large hoop that would take them to Beauxbâtons. Draco looked around at the other boys in his group and saw a mix of nervousness, confidence, and excitement. He steeled his own expression as to not give away his inner thoughts so plainly. As the portkey activated, he felt an uncomfortable tug in his gut and then the world exploded in a whirlwind of commotion.
Draco knew he was attractive and didn’t see the point in being modest about it. He didn’t have the money to buy skin or hair products, but one of the older girls had left a magazine in the dining chamber once that had some spells in it that suited Draco’s needs. He tested the spells out whenever he found himself alone in the bathroom. There was one that made his hair extra soft and gave it just a little bit extra volume and another that vanished unsightly blemishes.
“I could teach you if you’d like. I also know a good one for your eyebrows. I’m Pansy by the way.” She held her hand out. “Pansy Parkins.”
He did his best but it was a pitiful showing. His head was pounding. His mouth was dry. He could barely fly straight on his broom. Draco wanted to cry. This was humiliating, soul-crushing. It was so much worse than Barcelona. Draco was lucky that the match didn’t end after five minutes. Hell, he was lucky he didn’t fall off his broom.
If I had known all it took was some shattah on the floor and a summoner’s circle I would have done it ages ago.”
The first few weeks after the funeral were agony, but Draco endured them without breaking. The one lesson his father had taught him, and taught him well, was that as a Malfoy Draco was expected to be better, to do better, than his peers. And since Draco had no peers to compare himself to, he had to be perfect. Which meant that he could not allow himself to be weak.
Parker, was the team’s keeper, and she was the quiet one in the group. She was probably also the strangest of the bunch which only endeared her in Draco’s mind. She had lost her mom at an early age like Draco had, and though she had been raised by her father Draco was able to find many similarities between them. He was closest to April though, and the moment he had introduced her to Pansy he had regretted it. The two of them had hit it off and often gained up on him, which was just unfair.
Draco wanted to scream and yell, but he doubted his father would appreciate such a display. His father was disowning him in all but name, washing his hands clean of Draco for good. A part of him wished Father would just make it official, take away all of the pressure of living up to the Malfoy name. But Draco was grateful that he did not, because that would mean loosing everything.
Draco turned away from the reflection and headed for the door. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. Every fibre of his being fought to hold it all back. As he rounded the corner of the hallway he collided face-first into the person he least wanted to see. What the fuck was Potter doing here? He should be out on the field celebrating his win. Though Draco supposed this victory was hardly special in Potter’s mind.
“Hmmm. Do you imagine you saw the snitch as a representation of the love and acceptance you must have craved? Impossible to pin down, always just out of reach.”
“You have great instincts, you just have to learn how to follow through. If you did that you would have no problem beating Krum. I could help you if you want. We could train together, a few seekers matches.”
In the bathroom, Draco surveyed the damage. He was shocked at his own reflection in the mirror. Draco had been at l'Internat for less than one day, yet he could hardly recognize himself. The skin around his right eye was red and already swollen. He would be sporting a bruise for days to come. With any luck, his dormant magic would speed up the healing process a bit. He tried to fix his new fridge into something a bit more sophisticated but soon gave up. Without his usual potions and creams it was useless.
Several minutes passed in this manner, but Draco was patient and singular in his focus. The score was 50-70, with Durmstrang in the lead, when he saw the other seeker take a dive. It could have been a faint but it wasn’t, Draco could tell. He shot off after the other wizard.
He responded to them all politely declining, for now, stating that he preferred to complete his studies before he embarked on his chosen career. But the word was out, Draco Malfoy was one to watch.
“I know. I’m not saying I’ll never come back. I just want to take some time to explore other options.”

He missed Thomas more than anything. But even Draco’s friendship with Thomas wasn’t the kind of relationship he craved. He had always felt more like an older brother, it was his job to give advice and protect him. Draco had never felt comfortable confiding in Thomas, he didn’t want to burden the younger boy with his own problems. And that was what he truly wanted, a confidant, someone who would understand him wholly and completely.
Draco laughed, hollow and humourless. “You were trying to give me space? I thought you were avoiding me because you didn’t want to talk. And yeah a little warning would have been nice but I wasn’t upset to see you.” A small smile formed on his face.
Draco’s orgasm hit first. Cum sprayed across his chest and his ass clenched up as Draco surrendered himself to the waves of pleasure. A moment later he felt Harry’s own orgasm hit as he filled up inside. Draco closed his eyes and let himself just exist in the moment.
Draco took another deep breath. “I understand why you don’t want to talk to me, that was kind of the point of those things I said, but I need to apologize.”
Draco agreed and reached out for his broom that someone had brought over. He flew up and rejoined his teammates who were all gathered near the goalposts.
Why couldn’t the doofus get it through that thick head of his? Draco was toxic and Harry was so much better off with him gone.
Between his outdoor study sessions and his playdates with Thomas, Draco had spent an exorbitant amount of the summer outside. He’d used skin protection charms hourly, but by the start of classes his skin had developed a golden glow and his hair had lightened so much that it was almost platinum in colour. It had gotten much longer since the start of first year as well, there wasn’t quite enough of it to pull back but the soft locks were constantly falling into his eyes and Draco had developed a habit of tucking it back behind his ears.
Draco wrote to Pansy that week telling her that maybe the summer wouldn’t be so bad after all and that perhaps she should have greater faith in him.
Draco made a humph-ing noise and turned away in embarrassment. How did this girl, Pansy, know he wasn’t interested? Was he that transparent? He looked at her again and she smiled knowingly. She didn’t seem to think he was weird. Then again she was the one in the boy’s bathroom.
Draco had only travelled by portkey once, when his family had left England, and he had been so young he didn’t remember it at all. He knew though that portkey travel was particularly rough especially on one’s stomach, which is why he had skipped breakfast that morning. He would not allow his first moments at Beauxbâtons to be soiled by a bout of portkey-sickness. What a terrible first impression that would make.

Thomas frowned. “But isn’t as much fun by myself, pleeeeease, you can study later if you really have to.”
After that day in the garden, Thomas pestered Draco relentlessly. He learned that Thomas’ parents were divorced and his mom was the advanced Astronomy professor. She was conducting some sort of research using the school’s telescope as so she needed to stay on campus. Which is how Thomas found himself at Beauxbâtons for the summer.
Draco set his things down on his assigned bed and followed Mr Barker back downstairs to receive his uniforms and regulation haircut.
Draco dismounted quickly and immediately headed for the lockers. The noise of the crowd was deafening around him. His eyes flicked up to the screen as it showed Potter holding up the snitch triumphantly, that stupid fucking grin across his face.
Krum nodded and flew off. Draco might have imagined it, but he thought he saw a small smile on Krums face as he departed.
“Yes Draco, you have uncovered my dastardly plan - to kill you with exercise and healthy food.” Harry deadpanned right back.
It was a dangerous move, especially in the rain, but it worked. The snitch was gone. The referee blew her whistle and called a foul, giving Durmstrang a free shot on goal. Draco knew they would be gunning for him now and his teammates had to work extra hard to keep the bludgers away.
“I’ll stay over tonight and we’ll clean it up. You can stay with me for as long as it takes to get you clean again. I know a witch, very discreet, that specializes in addiction potions. We use her for work sometimes.”
Potter ignored him. “I’ve been watching your games and you’re better than me. Your instincts have always been spot on. I might have faster reflexes and more speed but that sort of thing comes with training, experience. It is only a matter of time before you beat me.”
When the snitch popped up again Draco and Harry shot off. The golden ball took a sharp dive, and Draco was reminded of his very first match with Potter only this time he was confident that he could do what needed to be done.
As the charity match approached, Draco did his best to keep the house clean and manage his drinking. He limited himself to two drinks a day, and after a while he was able to get it down to one. It stopped the shaking and the headaches, and some nights it was the only way he could fall asleep.
“Look Draco, going from number two to number four doesn’t make you any less perfect. And any apprenticeship program would be lucky to have you after graduation. Besides, grades are just one arbitrary measure of a person’s intelligence. All they really tell you is who is good at working the system.”
“That may be true, but I feel like it is time for me to move on. Don’t tell me you and Max don’t miss your space.”
“Yes, bed, good idea.” Harry stood up and pulled Draco up as well. “You know, it killed me to see you flirting with Blaise all night.”
Draco spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon organizing his things and practising small spells with his wand. He couldn’t get all of them to work on the first try but he continued to practice. Eventually, he grew bored and made his way down to the common room to socialize with his new classmates. He spotted a tallish boy with mousy brown hair and a strong jaw who was seated by himself.
A curtain hung in the doorway and Draco heard a whittling tea kettle. A few moments later the healer pushed open the curtain and came in holding a cup of tea.
The other boy looked him over, assessing. “I am waiting for my friends to come down,” he said in a flat tone.
Beauxbâtons’ Conservatory was breathtaking. Draco had only seen the conservatory from a distance when walking the campus grounds but inside the glass structure felt otherworldly.
After the game, more people showed up to the house. Draco wasn’t sure but he suspected there were more Weasleys, if that was even possible, there were definitely more Gryffindors. A couple of people brought along food and alcohol and soon enough it was a full-on party.
He was nearing the end of his rope when he saw it, a glint of gold hovering in the air. Despite his monologuing, Potter saw it too and both seekers were speeding across the pitch.
When he got home he quickly started nursing a bottle of wine. He pulled out a record player that sat in the corner of the living room and chose one of the records at random.
Flying around with Potter was just as fun as it had been last night. They got into a couple chases early on in the match but the snitch got away both times. The third time Draco caught sight of the snitch it was hovering just over Potter’s shoulder.
As much as Draco had enjoyed playing quidditch before, when he played for the Tornados every game had just felt like work - like an obligation he just had to fill. Especially after Harry had left. But playing with the Falcons was actually fun. Even when they lost, which happened a lot more than it had with the Tornados, Draco still had fun. Of course, Draco preferred winning but he stopped beating himself up over stupid mistakes because his teammates genuinely didn’t care if Draco, or anyone else, messed up. Everyone gave it their all because they were happy to be there. For the first time in his life, Draco didn’t pressure himself to be the best and he had never been happier.
As the night went on Draco caught the eye of one of the beaters from Estruga, the Spanish school. He had wavy, brown hair and an accent that was definitely doing things for Draco.
“I wish I could be more like you,” Draco confessed. “You have an effortless charm. Everybody loves you. There is no place that you wouldn’t fit in.”
Draco took a deep breath and sat down next to Harry. “This morning I received a letter from the National Quidditch Team inviting me to play at the World Cup.”
Draco packed his bags and apparated with Pansy to her flat in London. Pansy made dinner while Draco unpacked his stuff in the guest room. Pansy had done well for herself and Draco couldn’t help but feel guilty for falling out of touch with her. Draco didn’t deserve a friend like Pansy. He didn’t-- Draco looked down at his shaking handstand clenched them tight. He couldn’t change the past but he could do something about the future. He would be the friend Pansy deserved.
Harry stood above him still, drinking in the sight. He pulled off his own shirt and crawled into the bed with Draco. Draco ran his fingers across the muscles along Harry’s stomach as they continued to kiss.
“Very good. I’ve studied his games in the group stage and I don’t believe Mr Krum is as unbeatable as he appears.” Draco didn’t look to see how Krum reacted to that statement and the reporters moved on.
Draco went to the cabinet and poured himself a drink. He took a few sips as he stood over the counter, but when he brought the glass up to his lips once more he noticed the tremor in his hand. Fuck. He set the glass down.
It was a hungry, desperate kiss and Draco gave as good as he got. After a moment they broke apart to breathe.
Reaching the locker room Draco quickly stripped and hopped into a cold shower. If he was fast he might be able to make it in and out before the rest of his team made it off the pitch. A few seconds was all he needed to wash off the sweat. Draco threw on a t-shirt and some joggers. It would be freezing with his wet hair but he could bear it for the few minutes it took to get to the apparition point.
He left the pitch and flew as fast as he could across the grounds. The chilly air pierced through his robes but Draco didn’t want to stop long enough to cast a warming charm. The feeling of euphoria and clarity was almost better than the one the pills gave him.
But all of that was ruined one afternoon in late November. The air had begun to cool so Draco was pretending that he and Nicolas were on an arctic expedition. They had encountered a group of talking polar bears and Draco was attempting to negotiate with the great polar bear warrior, Ulysses, so that he and Nicolas could get a ride to the research base at the south pole.
There was a rare smile on Draco’s face as he exited the locker room and followed his teammates onto the pitch. The smile fell immediately when he locked eyes with the last person he had expected to see.
A few months into Draco’s recovery Pansy did the impossible. She helped get Draco a second chance at his pro-quidditch career. He hadn’t touched a broom in all that time though he had continued to exercise almost obsessively.
“You wish.” Draco knew Potter was just edging him on but honestly a seekers game sounded perfect at the moment and with any luck it would wear him out enough that he would be able to sleep through the night. “Ok,” he nodded, “one game.”
“I am sure you can get Professor Hérisson and Professor Duchamp to give you an extension on the assignments. They like you--”
“Je passe souvent par la France, la prochaine fois que vous en avez envie, regardez-moi et je serai heureux de vous offrir une cuisine raffinée.”
“It wasn’t an orphanage. Just a boarding school for young boys in Leon. My father and I were never particularly fond of each other.”
“You don’t want to be like me. You already have so much more than I do. Something that I will never have.”
At those words, Draco couldn't contain himself any longer. He bent down and pulled Harry into a kiss as the chaos of celebration rang around them.
“I’m not dramatic. And next year I’ll hardly have time for quidditch. In case you didn’t realize, next year we will be sixth-years and we’ll have the
“Well, I suspect you were unsuccessful, which is quite lucky because we’re all going to be spending quite a bit of time together. Whatever it is that happened I suggest the two of you work it out sooner rather than later.” She looked at Draco meaningfully.
The rest of his team went crazy. As soon as Draco landed he was tackled by no less than five practical strangers, screaming and chanting.
“You know my offer to train with me still stands. There are still a few weeks left before the season starts.”
He started taking the magical pills every day once again. Then he would go for his morning run, eat breakfast, head to the training facility for some kinetic stretching, run through practice with the team, spend some extra time on the pitch running his own drills and practising different scenarios, then there was his cool down workout usually lifting weights or some other strength training exercise, he would shower before heading home and run any necessary errands. Once he got back to his flat he would pour himself a drink and start on dinner, while he was cooking he would listen to some muggle tapes and practice his Russian. He would usually have another glass as he ate and studied old matches. After cleaning up and getting ready for bed he would polish off one last nightcap to help him sleep then wake up the next morning and start all over.
He made sure to spend just enough time with the others so that it would be clear that he was one of them - he had shed the persona of the “weird kid” and it was not one he planned to pick up ever again - but once his social obligations were upheld, Draco would retreat back into himself. He still had grades to maintain after all.
Harry stretched Draco some more with two fingers before adding a third and Draco was touching himself now, slow but deliberate strokes along his cock.
As summer break approached, so did final exams. Draco was disappointed to find that despite all his hard work he had yet to distinguish himself. He’d managed to move from the middle to the upper end of the rankings, but it wasn’t enough. He needed to be at the top or there was no point.
The 2002 World Cup took place in Japan during the month of June. Draco was beyond nervous to be playing with a lot of the same teammates that he had let down during the Euros, but most of them seemed willing to leave the incident in the past. Draco was sober now and knew he wouldn’t be getting any more chances if he fucked this one up.
Draco took the envelope and headed up to his room. He set the letter aside to read in the morning but as he got ready for bed his curiosity got the better of him. He began to skim the letter to see what it was about.
Draco cut her off, “All of the professors like me. I am the perfect student - well most of the time. But it doesn’t matter how many extensions I get, there is no way for me to catch up on all the work I missed.”
Draco frowned, something was definitely wrong. “It wouldn’t feel right to leave you alone with all this mess. Besides, I’m not even tired.”
“Well maybe that’s what I want,” Draco snapped. The frustration, stress, and anger started to boil over.
“I don’t need your help or anyone else’s for that matter,” Draco spat. “The only person you can depend on in this world is yourself and I plan on doing just that. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I will knock you off your high horse eventually. And I will do so on my own.”
Draco knew immediately that he wanted to see Professor Dubois. It had been years and he wanted to hear all about Dubois trip and his book and-- Draco looked around the small house. Empty bottles littered the floor, dishes were piled up in the sink, and the whole place smelled like a bar. Draco, himself, wasn’t much better.
Harry finished covering a bowl of hummus with some Spellwrap before responding. “I had to mingle and it seemed like you and Blaise were having fun.”
Harry began to stroke his fingers along Draco’s arms, pressing kisses wherever he saw a beauty mark decorating the soft skin. Then he moved on to Draco’s thighs working his way down but skipping completely over the area that Draco felt needed the most attention. Once he got to his feet, Harry tapped Draco lightly on the side indicating that he should flip over.
That year, Draco didn’t pass Emilie Baumé in the rankings. He figured number two wasn’t so bad. Merlin, what would his father think of that? Draco decided that studying was all well and good, but at a certain point it became too much. As long as his reputation remained intact and he was still near the top, it was fine. It wasn’t worth the countless hours of studying each week that it would take to get him a shot at number one.

Draco glanced down at the textbook in his hand. “Yes, I need to get ahead so I can be top of the class.”
“Did he tell you how the local Auror’s department found them when they finally managed to take down the wards?” Harry asked, filling in the spot next to Draco.
It wasn’t long before more symptoms started to show. Instinctively he hid it from Pansy but he realized that was counterproductive so he let her see the tremor in his hands and the sweat on his brow.
“Take one drop every morning for a week and that should see you through the worst of it. The first day you take it you are likely to experience fatigue. After that things will start getting back to normal.”
“You know my dad drank. He wasn’t mean or anything. He just got quiet and fell asleep in his clothes.”
Draco became a regular at Dubois’ office hours, at first he would make up questions to ask but eventually the façade became unnecessary. Instead, Draco would just go to Dubois’ office to study while Dubois graded papers. Draco would also help Dubois after class as part of his work-study and they spent many hours together in the conservatory and the gardens. It was nice having someone to talk to again, and Dubois would often show Draco interesting articles or pull books that he thought Draco would enjoy.
After that, Draco got his shit together. He didn’t stop drinking or taking his daily pill but he kept it under control, enough to hide it from his team. They finished out the season strong coming in second to Puddlemere, which automatically qualified them for that year’s International Quidditch Tournament.
“Tasty too,” Simon continued. “Doesn’t look as if you got enough to share though, and isn’t that a shame. It just wouldn’t be fair for you to go enjoy that delicious cake all by yourself when the rest of us don’t get any pudding at all.”
It wasn’t a no, so Draco took a seat. “Draco Malfoy.” He introduced himself keeping the frustration out of his tone.
It rained on the day of the final match, but it had been decided that the weather was mild enough that the game should continue as scheduled.
Asim also appreciated Draco’s talent of swiping a bottle from the kitchens. They spent many a night getting drunk together and philosophizing about stupid things like what would happen if the muggle world found out about magic or the repercussions of someone going back in time and adopting themselves.
“You want me to write your paper for you? In case you didn’t notice I’m more than a bit busy. I’ll be lucky if I catch up before exams start. Besides, why would you want a fifth-year writing your paper?”
And so things reached an equilibrium, a new normal, which is why his tenth birthday came as such a surprise. Mr Barker handed out the mail every morning at breakfast. Since arriving at l'Internat Draco had not received any correspondence from his father, there had been a note on his ninth birthday but Draco understood it was nothing more than a formality. He had expected to receive the same for his tenth but instead of an envelope, Draco was handed a small brown parcel.
“If you could set one of these at every workstation that’d be great.” The professor smiled again and handed Draco the box.
“If I joined the dance team I might as well just come out to the whole school now. Besides, I haven’t done ballroom since I was eight, there is no way I still remember all the steps.”
Mr Barker gave Draco a tour of the grounds though there wasn’t much to see. Just the single building and a small side yard where, Mr Barker told him, the kids played football in the warmer months. The first floor housed some administrative offices, the kitchen, dining room, and a small lounge with mismatched furniture and donated toys. A group of boys were gathered around a small TV in the corner. They turned to look at Draco as he passed through but they quickly dismissed him as uninteresting and returned to their program.
“Please Harry, let me get this out.” Their eyes met for a brief second before Draco lowered his head. “I was terrible to you. Since the moment we met, you’ve been nothing but kind. I was petty and jealous and an asshole but still you treated me like a friend. And then I took that friendship and I ruined it just like I ruin everything else--” Draco shook his head. “I can’t even blame the drugs or alcohol for that one. You opened up to me and somehow I made it all about myself. I’m sorry. And I’m sorry for everything I said to you that day. I know I said some horrible things. I didn’t want to get better and I knew you would try and help me so I said what I had to to keep you away. I am a terrible person but I’m trying to be better. I don’t expect you to believe me, but I hope that you’ll be able to see for yourself someday. Until then, do you think we can work together? Because the Falcons are kind of my last chance.”
“Look, I don’t mean to be rude or offend you in any way. I just thought I would make it clear that I’m not in the market for any friends. Save us both some time. That way you all can carry on as normal and I’m perfectly content to keep to myself.”
Draco managed to get a few hours of sleep before he heard Pansy moving around in the living room. He groaned as he got out of bed. His headache had somehow gotten worse. He brushed his teeth and washed his face before making his way out of his room.
The Falcon’s lost the first game of the season, but oddly enough it didn’t bother Draco. The Harpies had played a good game and their seeker had taken advantage of a gap Draco had left open. He wouldn’t make that mistake again, and hopefully they would win the next game. The truth was Draco was actually looking forward to discussing the game with Harry. They would talk about strategies and possible plays and training exercises, and Draco couldn’t think of a better way to spend the afternoon.
“Draco, great game today.” It was the female Weasley. What was her name? Penny? No, it started with a ‘G’...
Draco smiled and reached across the table taking Pansy’s hand. He wondered for the millionth time how he had gotten so lucky to have a friend like Pansy Parkinson.
"Sometimes blood means more than just your family, and you have a real talent." Xavier smiled and placed a hand on Draco’s bicep. “It's quite loud in here, perhaps we should find a quieter place to talk?"
“Here,” she said handing Draco the cup, “drink this.” She moved on to check on whatever was simmering in the cauldron. “It’s valerian tea. It should help with the nerves and those tremors.”
And so, a few minutes later, Draco found himself hovering ten feet above the ground. He was a bit unsteady at first, but he quickly got the hang of things and soon he was sweeping through the air. He grew more and more confident and began to pick up speed.
. Draco smiled, not even the sight of his father’s name could ruin his mood. He flipped the envelope over, on the other side was an ornate golden wax seal - the letter “B” intricately designed. He opened the envelope carefully and removed the parchment inside.
Draco continued to take the little orange pills daily over the summer months. It had become routine for him, and he didn’t like who he was whenever he was off of them, namely irritable, unmotivated, and unfocused. Whenever they would wear off Draco felt like he was returning to himself, which was something he wished to avoid at all costs. Plus, they gave him enough energy and focus that he could still study after a long day of flying.
Draco avoided the bird’s beak as he handed him the letter and when the owl had flown away Draco turned to survey the mess. He could do this.
surprise Draco. Even if his father wanted nothing to do with him, he was still a Malfoy. He had pure wizarding blood running through his veins and yet his father was suggesting that he leave all that behind. Beauxbâtons was still three years away. That meant three years of living as a muggle. It was ridiculous, maddening, and completely unfair.
The end result was that Draco spent most of his free time alone. After dinner, he would often swipe a bottle of wine from the kitchens, find an empty classroom, and drink a glass or two as he worked on revisions by himself. He found it comforting to have a glass of wine in his hand to keep him company as he studied, and he never drank enough to get properly drunk.
Draco arrived at the party fashionably late and immediately located some familiar faces. As he made his way over to the other third-year boys, he noticed they were passing around a bottle of cheap wine between themselves.
Draco kept pace with Harry, biding his time for the right moment. The ground grew closer and closer but Draco kept his eyes on the snitch. Almost there, they were so close now. And there it was. Just a small twitch as the ball veered right a few feet above the ground. Harry pulled up to avoid impact but Draco leaned into it turning the movement into a spiral as he reached for the ball. And that was game. The snitch was his.
Great Britain had the advantage and Draco knew this was his chance to end the match. He flew low and caught sight of it immediately. Krum was barreling for the ball and Draco chased after them both.
Harry pulled out his fingers and Draco turned back around so that they were facing one another. He gave Harry a soft kiss and laid down again on his back bending his legs to give Harry access at this new angle.
was what he had been waiting for the last three years. He knew better than to let the other boys see the letter, so he quickly tucked it into the back of his book. He would have to wait till the end of classes before he could read it.
Pansy turned to Draco then and hugged him. He froze when she touched him, feeling strange. This was the first time anyone had touched him since… well it had been a while. He relaxed into the hug and squeezed her back.
A series of emotions flickered across Narcissa’s normally stoic face. Shock, confusion, disbelief. “You want us to leave the manor? And go where?”
She stirred the cauldron once more before moving over to the window to inspect a few plants. After she found what she was looking for she added it to the cauldron and stirred it a few more times.
She cut him a sharp look but Draco held his ground and stared right back. If that was all it took to throw him off, he would have withered away ages ago.
“I’m sorry Draco,” Pansy said still holding him. “I should have come sooner. I knew-- I should have come sooner.”
As the school year got underway, Draco developed a new routine. He spent the school day with the other boys, helping out with homework and teasing them at lunch. After classes, he would stick around for a while and socialize. He used the skills he had built up over the summer, doing whatever he needed to do to hold onto his new spot in the social hierarchy. Often the boys would gather by the lake after school and hang out, but Draco wasn’t interested in devoting any more energy than necessary on his so-called friends. He was always the first to head back inside, using his work-study with Professor Dubois as an excuse.
Draco slammed the door shut. Honestly, who did Dubois think he was telling Draco that he needed help. Dubois had left years ago, he had no idea who Draco was nor did he have any right to have any kind of say in the matter.
The new season started with Elliot Fisher as Puddlemere’s first string seeker. The papers speculated about Potter’s sudden withdrawal siting everything from injury to secret love child. Even Draco’s teammates gossiped about the prodigy seeker. Draco did his best to tune it all out.
The match against Mata was the most difficult Draco had played in a while. Mata was an older player in her mid-thirties and had heaps of experience and understanding of the sport that Draco still lacked. She was able to counter Draco’s speed quite beautifully but ended up losing the match in the second hour.
“I know exactly what you mean. That feeling of being completely... outmatched. Like you're caught in a storm on all sides. The training, the instincts, it all leaves you and the best you can do is keep yourself upright.”
The new school year began with excitement. They had graduated from the Collège and moved on to the Lycée, which meant that they got to choose their specialities. Draco had chosen Potions, Alchemy, and of course Herbology. So instead of attending Professor Dubois class only once a week, he would have three full class periods devoted to his favourite subject.
Draco figured Harry would talk about whatever was bothering him if he wanted to but he wasn’t going to push it. He went to work collecting plates and glasses to put under a cleaning charm in the kitchen.
The match was intense. Draco kept dry enough with a few water-repelling charms but that didn’t make it any easier to see. He decided to fly a couple of laps around the field to see if he could spot the telltale shine, and he watched Durmstang’s seeker do the same on the other end of the pitch.
“I don’t know Louis, I am really busy with school and well… Maybe if I skip that extra credit report for Arithmancy… That might work. Alright, I’ll do it.”
“I was going to take the day off, but there is an emergency at work and I don’t trust anyone else to handle it.” Pansy sighed. “Will you be ok on your own for a few hours?”
“You princesses about done fixing your hair?” A voice yelled from the corridor. “You’re going to make a terrible first impression on the new assistant coach if you’re all late. Let’s go!”
“So what is Beauxbâtons like? A couple of Beauxbâtons students stayed at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament but I didn’t really get to interact with them a lot since I was only a fourth-year. Is it true that you have to kiss a frog at the graduation ceremony?
After lunch Harry’s friends showed up. Harry had introduced them all as they arrived but Draco couldn’t really remember their names. The redheads were all Weasleys, Draco recognized the name as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. There was also Oliver Wood, who was Puddlemere’s keeper. The rest were mysteries to him. Draco got Wood, one of the Weasley twins, and the girl Weasley on his team, along with Angelina (or was it Angelica) and a pair of blondes.
“Draco, you can’t graduate from Beauxbâtons without experiencing it at least once. I think they have a bunch of spare brooms in the quidditch shed. Next time you’re bored you should take one out for a loop around the campus. I promise you won’t regret it.”
. They continued to ignore each other a while, before one of the sixth-year girls walked up to Draco. “Hey Draco, I don’t know if you remember me from yesterday. I’m Katy.” She offered out her hand and Draco shook it.
Well, that wouldn’t be an issue with Pansy’s mothering. Draco still wasn’t convinced but he had nothing to lose so he agreed and pocketed the tin.
He spent the rest of the day pouring through books, but the only thing Draco learned that Thomas had been right. There were countless cases of squibs being born into pureblood families. In the early days they had been killed, but that practice was soon seen as cruel and barbaric. There was a law passed in the early 1900s that forbid squibs from marrying or having children that stayed on the books for several decades before being repealed. There were even accounts as late as 1976 of forced sterilizations. But for the most part it seems purebloods just swept the entire thing under the rug. It become a well-kept family secret and was something that no one wanted to discuss. Draco was disgusted and appalled.
This has nothing to do with the story but Estruga Academia de Maxia is named after the Galician word for stinging nettle which is just as ridiculous as Hogwarts (named after the hogweed plant apparently). Their motto is
“I’ve got plans this weekend, but if you’re already planning to spend it in the library adding one more paper to your pile wouldn’t be such so bad.”
Lunch went well and after that Draco and Pansy ate together every day. Sometimes they ate with the other boys, sometimes with the girls, and sometimes it would just be the two of them. Everyone assumed they were dating and Draco and Pansy were content to let them think whatever they wanted.
The days were lonely but Draco did his best to keep himself occupied. He got back on a broom for the first time since the tournament. It felt good to relax and let his instincts take over. The Var was extremely beautiful in its isolation and Draco would go on leisurely flights along the Verdon river, stopping to examine the plants and take in the landscape.
The entire time he wanted nothing more than a drink, but he pushed down the urge. Draco just felt numb.
After allowing himself this, Draco picked himself up and began putting everything back in its place.
“No, me either. How about this? In public, we’re friends, good friends. And then when it’s just the two of us we’re more than that.”
When the semester’s ranks were posted in November, Draco was shocked to find that for the first time since arriving at Beauxbâtons his rank had dropped. He had gone from number one to number two and he chastised himself for overlooking one critical thing.
“I asked a few friends to come over this afternoon for a pickup game. We’ll see then if last time was just a fluke.”
“Sorry, it’s just that half the girls in our year have a crush on you. I don’t think they realize that you are not interested.”
Draco heard a cheer and turned to see Russia had scored the first goal of the match. He wasn’t worried though. Quidditch was a high-scoring game and he believed in his teammates. However, as the clock kept ticking the point gap grew larger and larger. There was still no sign of the snitch and if things continued at this rate it wouldn’t matter if he caught it or not, Russia was going to win.
I know all this information can be overwhelming (I have definitely been there), but I hope that if you need help you are able to find it.
He thought about writing to Pansy, but he figured she was probably busy with her own life and didn’t want to be bothered by him. Especially when he was like this.
Draco read the short letter three times before the words truly sunk in. He had been disowned. It was official now, the only thing he had left was his name and it was a worthless name at that. How many of his father’s rants had been about how the Malfoy name no longer had the weight it once did? How, before, it could be used to open a number of doors but now it only shut them.
That is how just a week later Draco found himself on the quidditch pitch once more, hovering in the air and looking for a small, gold ball. Draco was grateful that there weren’t too many spectators, this was just a small intramural game and quidditch wasn’t exactly a popular sport at Beauxbâtons. There were only about a dozen students in the stands.
When he got back to the hotel it was well past midnight but before he could make it to the elevator one of the staff flagged him down.
“There are plenty of rumours out there about us and he wanted to make sure I was ok with it. I didn’t want me being here to keep you from taking the job so I told him not to tell you that I was going to be a coach. But that first day, when you saw me… the way all the colour drained from your face, I knew I had made a mistake. So I tried to give you your space.”
Draco Malfoy, disowned progeny of alleged Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy, and new seeker for the Tutshill Tornados, believes that he is up to the task. Malfoy recently returned to England, after spending his formative years in France where he attended Beauxbâtons Academy of Magic.
Draco should have expected it, but he hadn’t. He still didn’t understand why anyone would go to that much trouble to help out their competition.
Flying around that dinky backyard with Potter and his friends was the most fun Draco had had in ages. Wood seemed to be the only one taking things seriously while the rest of them laughed and joked as they played. Draco could tell they were all excellent players, but for the first time he didn’t feel any pressure to win.
Dubois might not know what he was talking about but Draco knew he needed to cut back. It was almost July and he had a match coming up, not a serious one just a scrimmage for charity or some such. Still, he couldn’t continue drinking like he had been the past couple of weeks. It was time to pull his shit together.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Alright then, you can teach me the spells after supper tonight. I’ll meet you in the Arithmancy Classroom at eight.” Draco didn’t wait for a response and instead headed out the door to his next class.
She gave the sick boy a potion to settle his stomach and handed out schedules and a map of the campus to everyone. As first-years they were registered for Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Wizarding Literature, Potions, Alchemy, Defense, and Wizarding Etiquette. They pretty much had the entire day to settle in, with the welcome feast not taking place until seven. Lunch would be available in the dining chamber from twelve to two for anyone that was hungry.
Draco waved him off then took a minute to get his breathing under control before apparating back to his flat. Even though he had lost every single match, flying with Potter had been amazing. For the first time in a long time Draco had fun, and he found himself actually looking forward to tomorrow. Draco didn’t fully understand what had changed but he was beginning to think he had misjudged Potter completely. As soon as Draco made it to his room, he collapsed onto his bed and went straight to sleep. He slept through the night and didn’t wake up until his alarm went off.
He had until Friday to pull the pieces of himself back together. Friday night there was supposed to be a big dinner for the charity event and then on Saturday would be the actual match. All the proceeds would go to an organization that protected magical creatures.
The entire day he was unbelievably focused. Classes rushed by and Draco could recall all the material with extreme clarity. The second best thing to a time-turner indeed.
Draco waved his hands away. “Let me do it or we’ll be here all night. You take care of your own pants before I vanish them away.”
Draco enjoyed Asim’s stories of the trouble he got into as a kid, even if he was a bit jealous of the loving home Asim had clearly grown up in. When Asim talked about his mother, Draco couldn’t help but think of his own and wonder how different his life would be if she was still here.
Dorian turned to him. “Keep on Krum and the snitch for now. They are one hundred and fortypoints ahead at the moment so the snitch would still mean a win.”
He pulled a feint and got Potter to chase after him, losing him behind a bludger before looping around and plucking the golden ball out of the air.
The matches were tough, some of the hardest games Draco had played but they managed to secure their spot in the final match against Durmstrang. And the worst they could do now was silver.
Draco and Asim hung out regularly after that. They talked about books, school, food. Asim didn’t ask about Draco’s childhood or family once he realized they were a bit of a sore subject but was happy to regale Draco stories of his siblings - two younger brothers, twins, and a little sister. Asim’s family was muggle and his brothers hadn’t demonstrated any ability for magic, though they were still waiting to see if his sister was so inclined.
The whole day he could think of nothing else except for the piece of parchment waiting for him. As soon as class let out, Draco rushed out to the yard. He climbed up his tree and settled into his favourite spot.
Draco stared at the snitch in his hand in disbelief. The noise around him was so deafening that it just became a buzz, his ears were ringing. They did it. Fuck, he just beat the world’s best seeker and he had done so on the largest stage imaginable. Fuck.
Draco looked up to see who had woken him from his nap, Vanessa Malet, one of the sixth-year girls. She was top of her class and captain of the debate team.
He had always believed that magic is what gave a person their worth. At only twelve years old, Draco could do things a muggle could only dream of, but what if that was a flawed way of thinking. Draco’s head hurt. He couldn’t think about this anymore today. He stuck all the books on the restock shelf and headed back to his dorm. His world view had completely shattered that day, and he owed Thomas a huge apology. Hopefully, he would forgive him.
Draco gripped the paper tightly, wrinkling it in his hands. Skeeter had everything completely backwards and Draco wondered if she had listened to him at all. She hadn’t even stuck around to see him fly. She heard what she came in wanting to hear and probably had written most of the article before even speaking to Draco. What a joke. Still, Draco couldn’t help but internalize a few of her words.
Draco groaned. Harry wasn’t kidding about the warm-up, after the four-mile run they did strength training. Harry had Draco doing so many push-ups and sit-ups and planks that Draco thought he was going to puke. Once he recovered enough to stand, they took a break for lunch - chicken breast with salad and a tall glass of water.
“Alright then, if you’re sure.” Mr Barker opened the door and walked Draco to the gate. “You’re a good kid Draco, and I wish you well at your new school.”
Thomas’ body seemed to contract in on itself making him seem even smaller than he already was. “Haven’t.”
“In school, I prided myself on my grades. It wasn’t until the end of fifth year that I even rode a broom.”
The snitch flew up and directly into the melee of players. Draco and Krum followed. It was a test of Draco’s skill to avoid any collisions and he and Krum spung, bobbed, and weaved around the other players.
“Look Potter, I can see this is difficult for you to wrap your brain around so I’ll spell it out for you.” Draco used every ounce of self-control he had left to steel his face as he looked Harry in the eye. “Leave me the fuck alone.”
It took Mr Barker a while longer to meet Draco in the entry hall. He took a moment to review all the paperwork once more and check that Draco had everything he needed.
They were still only friends, though Draco found himself hoping more and more that they could be something more.
Everyone on the team had come from such different backgrounds but Harrison had been right when he said they were all rejects in one way or another. Because of this they were able to relate to each other on a much deeper level than some superficial commonalities would have allowed.
“Come by my house tomorrow at nine, I’ll owl you the floo address.” Potter got up to leave. “Oh, and about sex…”
They made small talk for a bit, though Sébastien didn’t seem too interested in Draco, and when his friends came down Draco found himself alone once more. No matter, he would find someone else to be his friend. He attempted to talk with a few of the other boys but found that he couldn’t keep up with the conversations. They spoke about books he had never read, sports he had never seen, and games he had never played. A couple of the muggle-borns tried talking with him, but he found the conversations to be dull as they only wanted to talk about how amazing magic was, and did you know that there were flying horses, and do you think dragons really exist, and on and on.
Thomas took to it immediately and loved assisting Draco with his chores. Sometimes he even hung out with Draco when he was studying. Draco would pick out a book for him to read - always a simple subject that didn’t require a magic core like herbology, potions, or astronomy - and they would read together in silence before Thomas eventually got antsy and they would go out to play.
While Draco was disappointed in this new revelation, he still figured having fake friends was a step up from his previous situation for surely the appearance of friends was better than no friends at all. It was all a game. He just had to figure out how to win.
“This should help with the physical symptoms, but you might still find it hard to focus for a few days and the mood swings will continue.” She calmed the flame and began bottling the potion. “It may be a while before you can sleep through the night, but it is not a good idea to combine this with any sort of sleeping draught.”
“What? It’s the 21st Century. I think it is about time everyone gets over this whole homophobia thing. Personally, I like to give just as good as I get.”
Draco woke up the next morning aching all over. Even walking was painful, but Draco’s stubbornness outweighed the discomfort and he was able to stay just a few paces behind Harry on their run. After making it back to Harry’s flat and getting his breathing back under control, Draco laid down in the grass.
As Draco stood and dusted the dirt off his pants, a witch came over to greet them, “Welcome to l’Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons.”
“You see, Draco understands. Êtes-vous un connaisseur de la cuisine française?” Blaise addressed his question to Draco.
A few nights after he finished off the healer’s potion, Draco finally got a decent night’s sleep. He had installed a white noise machine next to his bed and it seemed to help with the insomnia. Soon enough he was sleeping even better than he had when he’d been drinking.
An hour later Draco was trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was eating bolognese across from Pansy Parkinson. She had ordered food for them both, as well as a pitcher of water for the table. She hadn’t brought up the drinking or the drugs. Instead she talked about herself, what she had been up to since graduation. Draco felt as if there was a haze around him, but he listened. She was a paralegal at a law firm, and it seemed to be a successful one at that. She split her time between London and Paris, had a high-powered boyfriend who was into finance, and a cat named Coco.
Draco looked around the room. They appeared to be in a cottage out in the countryside. There were plants drying in the windows, various rock and crystals decorating the shelves, and a cauldron bubbling over an open flame.
The tournament was scheduled for mid-May and not even Draco could hide his excitement. The school was abuzz with the quidditch team’s newfound success and Draco was more popular than ever.
Potter trailed off as Draco reached out to brush his hair back revealing the famous scar. He could always blame it on the alcohol.
“A common misconception, but actually OCD and OCPD are two very distinct things. You must have had a lot of pressure on you as a child, and well, prodigy and psychosis often go hand in hand.
Maybe this chance with the Falcons was just what he needed. His whole life Draco had focused on becoming number one so that everyone would appreciate him. But maybe that had been the wrong approach. People would think whatever they wanted to think. And, miraculously, it made no difference to Draco. He was tired of wasting all his energy pleasing other people. Draco could count on one hand the only people whose opinions he actually cared about and at the top of the new list was himself.
He tried for weeks to tap into his magic again, but Draco could never get it to work. He thought back on the incident, the magic had poured out of him like a wave. His mother had taught him that the heart was the source of a wizard’s magic, their core. Magic flowed from the heart through the veins, which was why blood was so important. So, Draco concentrated on that feeling, the sensation he had felt that day in the dining room. He pictured in his head that he was pulling that magic out of his core, sending it through his body, and out into the world. A few times he thought he could feel a tingling in his fingertips but that could have just been poor circulation. Still, he practised.
