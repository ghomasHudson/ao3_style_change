But he hasn’t yet seen Potter’s cock, no. He’s felt it against him though – against his stomach, his hip, his thigh, his own cock, rubbing and grinding and rutting until they’re both groaning with need. But he hasn’t
?!” Draco complains as he rounds his desk and slams his folder onto it, throwing himself into his chair and dramatically dropping his head into both hands.
For an unplanned first kiss, it went on for a remarkably long time, neither of them particularly keen nor in a hurry to part long enough to discuss things. They kissed and kissed and kissed, standing there entwined together, arms coiled around each other, breath huffing across each other’s faces, neither of them cold anymore, despite the biting wind that swirled their cloaks and robes around them.
Harry immediately splashed back through the water and after drying himself another time, started walking in the direction Malfoy had said. When there was silence behind him, he paused and turned.
“It’s on your desk, go pick out all the mistakes I’ve made and I’ll owl it before I leave,” Octavia answers vaguely.
“I shouldn’t be roaming around, it can’t be safe for—” Potter starts in a murmur and Draco clicks his tongue irritably.
he’s always feeling now. It’s only with some effort that Draco managed to retain his mask of impassivity in front of Granger and Potter during these appointments, and he hasn’t yet mentioned to either of them that he reads to the baby every night now. He supposes he ought to feel guilty for not offering to let Potter engage with the baby too, but he’s not sure he’d be able to sit there and watch the git
“Please!” Draco yelps, before Harry is abruptly pulling out and crawling back down to swallow Draco’s cock, throat opening up to take him deep, tongue pressed against the sensitive underside of the glans.
“I’m not being defensive!” Harry claims at once, narrowing his eyes at Draco’s grin and kissing him on the mouth. “You’ll be okay to take them by yourself?” he asks, and Draco nods.
, in turn, that he was breathtakingly idiotic and that it had been somewhat pleasant to have met him again, however briefly, after all those years, and that he hopes Harry finds peace in being soulless.
Draco blinks, looking down at their joined hands in silence, feeling his cheeks slowly colour as he bites his lip and looks back up at Potter. “You wanted to help me,” he says, voice shaking but tone flat.
Potter squirms and bucks beneath him, his breath leaving him in sharp, whooshing gusts, his head thudding every now and then against the floor as he tosses it back. He remains silent, not calling out Draco’s name again, not even moaning or crying out again, but his whole body, in all its broad entirety, trembles uncontrollably under Draco’s ministrations. When Draco, at one point, manages to get the head down into his throat, Potter sits up in shock, eyes bugging out, mouth open in shock, before collapsing back down, arching his hips up and bursting into a loud, vigorous orgasm that has Draco spluttering in surprise.
“I—” Malfoy shakes his head again, gulping hard. “Ask me to choose,” he repeats, his voice so soft that it’s merely a puff of air against Harry’s face.
Unlike a real gold Snitch this one was silver, and had tiny wings, also silver, that didn’t flutter. Inside the shiny, spherical ball, he’d found the cufflinks he’d pointed out to Pansy one evening, several weeks ago, as they’d flipped through that month’s copy of Wizarding Elite in the Eighth Year Common Room. Harry had sauntered past with a derisively snorted
“Malfoy,” Harry murmurs, nuzzling into his sharp collarbones before running the flat of his tongue up the length of his neck, kissing his jumping Adam’s apple and gnawing at his perfect jaw. “Fuck, are you okay? Did I--?”
“They’ve taken the wards down,” Malfoy whispers shakily under his breath, appearing almost dizzy with relief. “Tilly,” he raises his voice a bit and addresses the house-elf.
He led the children inside and shut the door behind them. The kitchen looked just as they had left it – two half-eaten bananas and a little bowl of Froot Loops on the table. The drapes were still drawn shut. Harry remembered the terror in his neighbour’s eyes from the night before.
Draco snorts. “Right,” he says nastily. “Mind telling me why you bolted out of here like were possessed? Right after we’d...done that, no less,” Draco spits, barely mindful of the heat flooding his face. “You can’t fucking
Erickson finally shuts up, his eyes going from heated and hungry, to cold and flat. Not waiting for him to finish glaring, Draco whips around, his hair flying out behind him, and stalks off, leaving Erickson standing there gnashing his teeth.
Enormous grey eyes peered out from behind Malfoy and despite everything, Harry grinned, taking a single limping step forward. He stuck out his hand again. “Hello, Scorpius.”
Malfoy flirts, Harry flirts back, they kick some serious arse out there as partners, and Harry indulges in the occasional wank to memories of Malfoy’s luscious arse that he gets frequent glimpses of in the locker room. They never in any way address that spark between them that they’re both clearly aware of, and keep the details of their dating lives to themselves. Harry stays away from the flirty clerk on Level Three who’d gotten three sheets to the wind and snogged him at a Ministry event before Malfoy clocked him in the face, and Malfoy
“Talk about that, then,” Hermione interrupted him smoothly. “Clearly you have lots on your mind to talk to him about.”
Delirious with pleasure, his sweaty hands slipping on the smooth granite countertop, his cock begging for some attention, Draco wound one arm back to dig his nails into Harry’s flexing arse, bringing the other hand down to his cock and fisting it with swift, well-practised strokes, his orgasm rushing in gleefully.
Malfoy emits a squeak of surprise, shoving futilely at Harry before suddenly letting his mouth move along with his. When Harry pulls back, he stares at Harry with a mixture of impatient confusion and curiosity.
Malfoy doesn’t reply, staring at Harry over the rim of his slim, frameless spectacles like he’s a purple Erumpet wearing a vivid pink tutu that spontaneously appeared out of thin air to perform an energetic entrechat for his entertainment. Harry waves a hand before his face when Malfoy doesn’t even blink for several long beats.
“Draco, what are you doing?” she asks quietly and he doesn’t quite have an answer. “This might not turn out well,” she warns when he doesn’t reply.
“Oh, you know,” he says with forced airiness, shakily twisting the cap off his butterbeer. “Growing in every direction and waddling around on feet that won’t fit into any of the shoes I own anymore.” Granger laughs merrily and Draco finds himself grinning back despite everything. “I’m doing okay,” he adds with a shrug, drinking some of the creamy beer and licking it off his lips, heart still jumping in his chest.
But Draco’s erection has already flagged and he’s already scrabbling for a towel to cover himself up with, cheeks and neck burning with embarrassment.
“Shit,” Draco wheezes when he finally manages to wrench his mouth free, gasping up at the ceiling. Potter is still inside him though his body is angled awkwardly so that he’s half on his side and half on Draco, carefully avoiding Draco’s belly, and he presses small, wonderfully ticklish kisses along Draco’s throat.
, if it’s someone trying to sell me shit again--” Harry grit his teeth answered with forced calm. “Hello?”
Harry turns, eyes moist, and they simply stand there, nose to nose, beaming at one another. “I showed you, Malfoy,” Harry murmurs softly, buffing a knuckle against Draco’s jaw.
“’swhat I’m doing, Malfoy,” Harry snarls, finally pulling his hand back, grabbing Malfoy’s hips again and fucking Malfoy into the wall until he’s coming a second time into his burning hot, pulsating arse.
He put away the bedding as the children padded around, their socked feet getting drenched in dew. He knew he needed to get them cleaned up a bit– maybe clean up a bit himself – and feed them breakfast. But his mind was on overdrive; half-formed plans tumbled over one another and for all the urges he felt to do something constructive, he felt unprepared and naive.
“I thought you told him the appointment was to ensure that the foetus and he are doing okay,” Hermione mutters, not looking up from the file she’s perusing.
“It looks nothing like a baby,” Malfoy mumbles, frowning, staring unblinkingly at the almost shapeless blob Hermione is indicating to.
Granger grins at Draco’s exasperated expression and gets gracefully to her feet to go rouse her husband, who’s dozing in the armchair by the fire with their sleeping daughter in his lap.
Eventually, Potter became Harry, and Malfoy became Draco, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about touching Draco; touching his hair, his face, the pearly white skin of his neck. Harry couldn’t stop imagining what it’d be like to hold him, to feel the warmth of his flesh against his own, to feel the faint vibrations of his laughter against his skin.
“You wanted the truth,” Harry retorts flatly. “Sit your perfect arse down and eat your stupid breakfast, Malfoy,” he says, turning away, ignoring him as he splutters some more.
Malfoy – is standing before him, peering around the door at Harry, pale eyes bugging out and face draining of all colour.
Draco fidgets a bit, feeling oddly guilty suddenly. “I don’t like to pry,” he says awkwardly. When Potter just shrugs a shoulder like it doesn’t matter, “It’s not like I don’t care about you, Potter,” he says without looking away. “I just don’t want to...invade your privacy. I’m already living in your house, rent-free; I don’t want to be someone you have to check-in with every time you leave the house or...justify going out to.” He finally looks away, Potter’s gaze on his face way too intense now. “I’m used to spending a lot of time indoors; I never did have too much reason – or money,” Draco adds with a tilt of his lips, “– to go out much, or people to go out with. You do, and you have no obligation to give me any explanations before doing so.”
With a sigh of what sounds like satisfaction, Potter drags his fingers out, making sure to widen them just inside the rim so he can swiftly plunge his tongue back into Draco’s arse as it contracts uncontrollably from the intrusion.
so,” Malfoy responds, carefully not meeting his eyes, voice decidedly breathy. “Is this why you were here alone tonight, Potter?”
He presses Malfoy against the bike, lapping just under his jaw, leaving uneven, mottled bruises as he sucks ruthlessly into the bites he gives him. Malfoy leans into Harry, swaying unsteadily on his feet from the force of Harry’s assault.
I feel bad. “C’mere,” I murmur, reaching out and pulling him closer – as close as I can bring him to myself, wrapping my arms around his midriff and squeezing. Though he still looks muddled, he smiles at once, bringing his arms around my neck and bumping our noses together.
me?” Draco’s voice rises incredulously, “You—I’d never let you hurt me, Potter, that’s ridiculous. What the fuck gave you the impression that I’m that easy to
He and Potter gasp in unison – there is a distinctly human shaped form wiggling faintly in the centre this time. Draco can see the large, round head, the vague, almost shapeless limbs; when he squints, Draco thinks he can see the little arms, held up against its chest, hands meeting over the heart, waving around, and so he just watches the little thing wave for a while.
Spurting out another pulse of come onto Potter, Draco sags against him, breathing heavily through his mouth, his lower back now throbbing. “Fuck,” he whimpers weakly when Potter drags his fingers all the way to the tips before scissoring wide just inside the rim.
Malfoy pants softly at him for a moment, eyes boring into Harry’s, before slowly dipping backwards, fingers curled around the lapels of Harry's leather jacket , long neck straining as he wiggles against Harry, before he fluidly rises back up, bringing his arms around Harry’s neck, lips brushing Harry’s ear as he whispers, “I’ll be counting on you not to let me go, Potter.”
Malfoy seemed to relish the fact that he knew something Harry didn’t. “Because, Potter,” he said with the air of explaining to a child that two plus two makes four, “gold – pure gold – can repel a dementor just like one those fancy Patronuses can.”
The boy looked so pitifully confused, so desperate for more information, that Harry, for a moment, wanted to burst into tears right along with him.
I snogged the living shit out of him while he was legless and he actually kissed me back but none of it even matters because he has a fucking boyfriend and probably hates me and blames me for taking advantage of him anyway, I think.
“Who said she was drunk?” Harry chuckles, pulling his fingers out to a mournful cry from Malfoy, unbuckling his belt and pulling his flies open to gingerly pry out his poor, neglected cock, hissing as he eases the foreskin down and gives the shaft a swift little stroke.
Harry smirked, slow and smug, before once again pulling the covers off Malfoy, bringing it down his legs before placing his hand lightly on the inside of one calf. There was a sudden, deafening silence as Malfoy stopped breathing entirely. Harry let his hand brush, feather soft, against the flimsy pyjamas as he moved his hand upwards.
With a hoarse sound that’s only part human, Potter starts to fuck his mouth, left hand tightening in his hair, right hand gentling over his strained, aching jaw, fingers reaching down to stroke Draco’s throat over where it bulges around his cock.
“Always the victim,” Draco mutters, looking away, and Potter laughs again, this time elbowing him lightly in the flank. Draco’s heart skips dizzily and he makes a deliberate effort to keep breathing.
Soon, he’s up in the air with a large, bright golden Tempus timed to count down twenty minutes hanging above his head so every one of the players can see it. Most of the team plays offence while the Seeker, Elena Kross, Ginny, and one of the backup Chasers serve as defence, mainly just trying to intercept the Quaffle as frequently as they’re able to. He blows his whistle in sharp bursts every time the players take too long to pass the Quaffle or when they break formation. When the Keeper, Ava D’Mello - a tall, wiry young woman with the propensity to violently lose her temper if she ever missed a save - starts bellowing at Evelyn Greene, one of his more experienced Chasers, Harry blasts a particularly strong Shield Charm between them and barks irritably at them to get a move on. To his surprise, it’s nineteen year old Emilia Thatcher, his newly recruited Chaser, who scores some of the quickest goals — followed by Ginny, who is ruthless in her defence. They score the assigned ten goals with just under fifteen seconds to spare and Harry waves off the Tempus with a pleased grin, blowing a single, long note on the whistle to indicate the end of the day’s practice.
“So... someone here? At school?” Hermione sounded like she was coaxing a toddler to tell the truth about where they’d hidden all their extra candy bars.
, the sort of grin that not just reaches his eyes but makes them light up brilliantly, face going wonderfully pink. “Me too,” he admits shakily, stepping closer, and Draco feels like he’s about to explode with whatever’s pumping his heart to fifty times its size.
With a soft hiccup, Lyra bursts into tears of startlement, dropping the headless Chocolate Frog and lifting her arms up at Draco. Scorpius is watching them, his eyes very wide, and Narcissa’s lips have thinned down to nearly nothing as she glares at Lucius.
“Well, of course I fucked him,” Harry replies blandly, pulling the day’s load of paperwork towards himself with a sigh. “Sort of the whole point, wasn’t it?”
Harry releases him as though burnt, stumbling back with a shuddering exhale, watching Malfoy rub his wrist and bare his teeth at Harry. “I’m—I’m
, didn’t you?!” Seamus cackles, slapping his thigh. Draco is instantly irritated and I, until now just watching the rest of them interrogate him in (not stunned) silence, am suddenly holding my breath in anticipation.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Six years of being married and he’s still scared of the in-laws,” he mutters, sliding the cookbook back to Harry.
“Don’t play with your food,” Draco says softly, leaning over and cutting Scorpius’ lamb into tiny pieces. “Here, finish this and you can eat dessert.”
He’s looking at me now, back straight as he kneels there, and his expression downright terrifies me. I’d braced myself for a scorching accusatory glare – it’s not what I get.
Whimpering pathetically, Draco just comes in his pants like a fucking teenager, thrashing as he stands on the tips of his toes and claws at Potter’s back, the kiss turning increasingly feral. Potter is now growling continuously into Draco’s mouth, his hands slipping under Draco’s clothes to touch him properly, to find the soft fleshiness of Draco’s arse and
Malfoy is silent save for whimpered little mewls of overwhelmed pleasure, his nails tearing down Harry’s chest from time to time when Harry thrusts in and
“There could be a wedding, sure,” he says with a shrug and when Malfoy snorts, he rolls his eyes. “I mean, I’m sure we’ll talk about it eventually, if we haven’t murdered each other by then. I’m afraid it might not be possible before this one is born, though,” he adds, grazing a knuckle gently over Malfoy’s stomach, his heart fluttering in time with the movements from within. “Maybe before the next one!” he says brightly, rearing back a bit at the sudden dangerous glower Malfoy instantly shoots him.
ingly messy. The fact that he seems nearly incapable of having an ulterior motive for doing something; his almost frustrating transparency, his brutal honesty.
“Oh, don’t blame them, Potter,” Draco says airily with a saucy little wink. “I can be very persuasive when I need to be.” He waits, staring pointedly at Potter until his eyes widen in shock.
Malfoy is sitting on the dirty, stained mattress, hunched over hugging himself, his hair curtaining his dipped head. He’s looking right at Harry as he walks in, his face dripping with tears, eyes swollen and bloodshot, and his nose pink and blocked by the sound of his thick sniffles. He looks absolutely devastated, and the relief Harry feels upon seeing him is quickly overpowered by the heart-wrenching guilt and despair that fill him.
I lean in suddenly, flattening him against the cushions, and he yelps. Assuming that I just startled him, I don’t stop to investigate as I crash my mouth over his again and kiss him in earnest. He squirms a bit, clutching my shoulder, but doesn’t protest; it’s only a couple of moments later when I feel something wet under my chest that I pull away to find him clutching an empty champagne flute. I’d upended the contents of his glass all over him. There’s a large, wet patch on his grey t-shirt.
Harry’s stomach tightened and his throat closed up. He kept his eyes squeezed shut and let shudder after shudder pass through his chilled flesh. “She’s—”
Draco hiccups over his chuckle, pinching his nose between the folds of his napkin. “You’d like a pet dragon?” he asks wryly, one blond eyebrow lifting expertly. “Did Hagrid put that idea in your head?”
“Why?” Draco turns to him, unable to keep the suspicion out of his tone, “Why are you offering without me even showing the slightest inclination?”
“I don’t have to,” says Harry. “I’ll experience it firsthand tonight. I’ll see you in the Great Hall at eight.”
He shoves me again, planting both hands on my chest and pushing with all his might, and then follows it up with an attempted right-hook. I catch his fist as it flies at me and throw it away before pushing him away with measured force. He trips backwards, almost falling over.
Malfoy is rigid and palpably incensed, and Narcissa looks utterly aghast. “That’s not what we’re here to talk about, Father,” Malfoy’s voice is low and full of warning, “and it is not a topic open for discussion either.”
, are you mental?!” Ron howls, picking up his empty bottle of butterbeer and chucking it wildly at them, the bottle sailing over their heads as Harry suddenly collapses onto his back with a grunt. “I will LEAVE!”
When the very tip of his cock finally brushed against the shallow dip where Malfoy’s stretched hole lay, Harry’s cock spat out a large dribble of precome that then trickled down his cleft. Harry whined in his throat, bit his lip and gently coaxed the tip in, Malfoy completely still under him.
you’re going to be rich again someday. And when you are, you can buy me something fancy as fuck and we’ll call it even; you can buy me a dragon, maybe!”
, jumping with each sly press against that swollen nub inside him. Harry flicks his tongue at the sweat-dampened hollow of Draco’s tailbone, winding his free arm around his waist and jerking Draco’s hips higher before biting a savage mark onto Draco’s arse cheek.
fan, sir,” Scorpius said, and to Harry’s gentle horror, the little boy’s eyes filled up with tears. “You’re completely marvellous. Oh, I do apologise.”
“I’ll be just a few minutes,” Hermione tells them, carefully collecting the glowing orb on the palm of one hand, and the vial of blood in the other before bustling out of the room.
“No,” Harry says at once, voice grainy and tired. “I don’t know how it— it’s never happened before.”
up at Draco, vivid green and intensely bright as he stared with that half smile he reserved just for him.
When he turns back around, Levitating the cloth and spelling it dry, Granger is still standing there, watching him closely, her expression odd.
“Oh, I’m looking at him,” Draco drawls, leaning one shoulder on the cool metal and crossing his arms.
The sound he makes is clearly a gasp that’s been hurriedly bitten away. His nails are digging into my shoulder blades and with that grip on me he pulls me onto himself completely, so that as I flatten myself over him, I slip deeper.
He tried every single day to catch Malfoy’s eye, sometimes even deliberately knocking into him as they crossed in the corridors, just so Malfoy would
“Get them off,” Malfoy repeated, his voice sounding slightly nasal from talking with his head thrown back. As Harry watched he wriggled around until he was pulling his shirt off, dragging it off his arm roughly. “Potter, get them the
. First Robards wouldn’t get off his arse about the recent increase in Squib attacks, and he had a shit amount of paperwork that only increased every day, and he was still in a dilemma about hiring himself an assistant, and now this fucking...
It’s Malfoy he buys a croissant for every single damn day without fail on his way to work because the prat is too lazy to make himself breakfast, and it’s Malfoy who makes all his numerous mugs of tea that Harry consumes daily. It’s Malfoy who helps him pick out gifts for Hermione and Molly and Ginny for any and every occasion, and it’s Malfoy’s birthday and Christmas gifts that Harry spends most money on every year.
She laughs that easy laugh again. “Harry really doesn’t care, Malfoy,” she tells him. “Does he even seem the sort to throw sprauncy parties on his birthday?”
all the love and admiration that he’s constantly showered with. Draco hates that he knows this now, hates that he can’t simply carry on mindlessly hating the fit bastard.
Harry rests his head in one hand, forgetting to reply for several seconds as he simply stares at Malfoy with a soft, loopy smile that slowly spreads across his face until he’s grinning at him like a stupid goof. Malfoy looks away, taking a few sips of his drink and ignoring him for a long while before turning back to him with an impatient, “Okay,
, Draco is being spun around and pinned firmly to the door, Potter, on his knees behind him, ripping Draco’s trousers and pants down to his ankles. Yelping and scrabbling to maintain balance, Draco lets his legs be shoved wider apart and cranes his neck to look behind him with a shrill wheeze of disbelief when Potter roughly pries his arse open with both hands and plunges his face in.
Draco’s bellow is heard even over the deafening, thumping music and Ron’s head snaps around, one long arm lifting in greeting as he fights his way through the packed dance floor over to the semi-circular booth we’ve secured at the back of the enormous club.
Whimpering now, Malfoy finally pulls his hand free from between them, choosing instead to carefully angle his own freshly risen cock so it’s slotted against Harry’s still clothed erection, and
“Harry, fuck.” Draco let his head drop back onto Harry’s shoulder as his cock was pulled out and lovingly fondled, pushing his damp hardness into his fist and whining again when the grip tightened obligingly.
“I asked you last week if I should book you an appointment at Madam Malkins,” Potter had said, shrugging and muting the television but not looking at Draco. “You said you’d tell me when you needed new clothes.”
“I think you misunderstood me earlier,” Harry says suddenly, his hands splayed against Malfoy’s back.
“He has, unfortunately.” When Harry didn’t press, he went on cautiously, “When the infestation first began to grow, I made sure I kept him educated about what was happening. He enjoys reading – however much a five year old can read – and being read to. There isn’t a lot of children’s literature about dementors, as you’re probably aware.” Malfoy drank some more tea, shifting on his feet. “When...our house was taken over by them, he seemed—seemed prepared. He was shaken, of course;
Unthinkingly, Draco bucks up, using his free foot to kick at Potter’s thigh – and freezes. Above him, Potter has stilled too, viridian eyes enormous and round with shock, lips parted, breathing quickening as it dances across Draco’s face.
Potter darts him a look and then just shrugs. “Had a few whiskeys at the Leaky, rode the tube for a couple of hours.” he smiles sheepishly. “It helps to just...stay on the move; keep doing something.”
But Draco isn’t listening anymore, for Draco has had such a sudden, brilliant brainwave, that his head
“Correct me if I’m wrong, Healer Granger,” Draco cuts in loudly, sounding rather irritated. “But I’m fairly certain that a person’s voice box would work perfectly well even when said person didn’t cling to The Boy Who Lived like a bloody barnacle, wouldn’t it?” Hermione smiles around over her shoulder from where she and Ron stand at the sink, trying to repair a little chip Ron had gone and broken off the handle of the gravy boat with an overenthusiastic
He trailed off into brittle silence while Harry sat there and simply gaped, his thoughts formulating slowly, filling him with vague realisation that somehow also warmed his insides up. “I—we went to dinner with a couple of Ron’s brothers,” Harry said softly, dipping his head to try and catch Malfoy’s eye. “I’m sorry, I actually meant to send you a note, but we ran late and I forgot.”
so hard that his body flailed with it, his hips bucking wildly into Malfoy’s as he held him down and fucked his orgasm up into him, grunting with the effort and unnerved  from the impossible intensity of it. His insides felt liquefied and his limbs felt heavy and overused.
The orange chicken is suddenly rubbery and tasteless in my mouth. I set down my fork and take my time sipping my beer. Ron clears his throat loudly.
“What, what is it?” Harry demands at once, staring between her expression of awed disbelief and the projection on the wall.
But then their lips brushed, once lightly, again with more intent, and Malfoy tilted his head slightly, sidling closer to Harry, his mouth falling slightly open so with a sudden jolt of elated excitement, Harry could feel, could taste, the warm, wet sweetness of his mouth.
His prick juts out from his body, flushed dark red and twitching every few seconds from the need to be touched, veins bulging alarmingly along the thick length. Harry can still feel the soft pressure around it, clamped tight and damp. He can still hear the loud, wet sounds of lube and precome with every pump of his hips, every thrust of his cock messily squelching out the thick, sticky mixture out the arse of his date from earlier that day, the loud, deliberately wanton moans still echoing through his head, making him grit his teeth and roll his eyes much like he had while he’d still been in the act of fucking him.
Malfoy’s slightly wry expression suddenly vanishes to be replaced by flat frustration as he lets Harry’s words sink in. “Merlin, Potter,” he says irritably.
Harry’s swift inhale goes unnoticed as Malfoy’s head snaps up, gaze fiery as it meets Hermione’s. “I’m not here to participate in
“Erm...” Harry, scratches his ear, more than certain that he has the wrong place. “A... A friend – Draco Malfoy? I don’t think I have the right place, though.”
Potter chortles along with him, eyes soft as he regards Draco. “Are we really friends, then, Malfoy?” he finally asks when Draco finally looks back at him.
“Something you likely paid for through your nose,” Draco says sharply, mopping his eyes again. “I can’t have you spending that kind of money on me.”
, he’d probably write me into his will—Ow!” He’s laughing as, judging by the sound of sharp slaps, Mrs. Weasley smacks him across the head. “This is Tristan. Babe, this is Ronald’s mum – if I ever get fat, this lady will be the one respons—”
Ron is eventually sent to elbow his way past all the sweat-soaked bodies to the bar to buy the next round, by which time Neville has finally arrived.
!” He shoves him again. “So tell me what the fuck went wrong!” Draco shouts right into his face before abruptly lowering his voice to a trembling murmur. “You regret what happened, is that it?”
the next day, a panel of pictures splashed across the front page – Malfoy wiping his cheek outside Honeydukes; the two of them garbed in formal dress robes, Harry holding out his hand for Malfoy to take; the two of them desperately stifling their laughter as they’d spun together in the Great Hall, dancing with a sort of grace Harry wouldn’t have believed possible if not for the photographic proof in front of him.
“Obviously.” Malfoy’s tone had no bite to it – he sounded slightly breathless and leaned forward a little and Harry felt dizzy from the sudden drastic change in his demeanour.
“Where are you taking me?” Malfoy snapped irritably, and without waiting for Harry to answer, added, “I think I’m just going to head back to the castle now, Potter.”
“Oh, please,” she huffs, getting up as well, “Like I wouldn’t have bullied it out of you either way.”
“Where’s Lily?” But Harry saw her immediately. She was right beside him and Harry instantly recognised the bubble of a steady Warming charm around her body.
throw an Unforgivable at you.” Malfoy’s chest rises and falls as he seethes, his rough pants filling the still silence between them.
Albeit rare, these unmitigated breakdowns render Draco almost paralysed with shock and fright when they occur, and although he’s had over seven years, he’s still not managed to learn how to efficiently deal with them, still hasn’t learnt the right things to say; and
of it fresh in Draco’s mind as he’d bitten into one arm, hand braced against the slippery wet tiles, and pulled himself off once, and then again, before dressing and heading back to his flat, exhausted and sore, mind curiously blank as he’d fallen into bed and touched himself again, arching off the bed as he’d pictured Potter atop him, intense and fierce.
and—and I can hardly stand the thought of going through it over and over, just fucking holed up alone in my room and I have to do it again now in just a couple of days and I—” he’s gritting his teeth, shaking all over, eyes burning bright with tears, “I hate it, I hate what I am, what I’ve beco—”
Almost dizzy with the need to come now, Harry gently brings Malfoy’s leg off his shoulder and eases himself behind Malfoy, hooking his elbow under his thigh and holding it up so he can continue pressing deep into his contracting arse.  Malfoy moans softly when Harry feathers kisses up his clammy nape, turning his head to kiss him hungrily, reaching back and fisting a hand in Harry’s hair.
The agonised hopelessness rolling off of Harry as he sits slumped on the sofa creeps over Draco, cocooning him in the sort of powerlessness that makes one’s whole existence feel utterly inutile.
“I don’t regret what happened,” he says at once, quiet and firm, turning around with his hands on his hips. “I’ve been dying to touch you for
, look,” Draco says impatiently, “the point is, Potter doesn’t have to live as a recluse, you know? He’s a government registered member of wizarding society. He can live a normal, healthy life as a free man – as a free werewolf, whatever. I’m willing to bet they’d even give him his job back at the DMLE – there are perks to being Harry bloody Potter, and he ought to
“Don’t.” Harry was shocked at the bark in his own voice. “Don’t touch that gorgeous cock yet.” He could hear Malfoy’s breathing stutter again. “Do you have your wand on you?”
“Nothing to apologise for,” Potter says lightly, not seeming offended in the least that Draco hadn’t paid attention to something that was such a vital part of Potter’s life. “Not your fault.”
He’s right up in my face now, gnashing his teeth as he flounders for words, his eyes rolling drunkenly every now and then. I grab the finger he’s jabbing into my bare chest and tighten my fist around it, an implied threat of a broken finger.
Draco shushes him softly, leaving his cock with a final, long lick up the shaft, and then kissing his way up that faint line of hair leading to his navel. He presses greedy hands all over Potter, stroking his thighs, his heaving stomach, reaching up to tweak dark nipples. Potter is blissed out and boneless under Draco’s hands and mouth, squirming slightly when his navel is tickled. Grazing his teeth across the flat expanse of his midriff, Draco mouths his way to the large, grisly bite mark on Potter’s hip. He can just about make out where razor sharp teeth had sunk in – those marks are paler than the rest of the twisted scar. The healed skin feels fragile and wrinkled under Draco’s tongue as he laves gently over the entirety of the scar.
Details of the previous night trickle into his head, leaking in drop by drop like water from a broken faucet. Potter, on his knees in the dark, foul smelling alley; Potter’s mouth, still swollen from sucking Draco’s cock, fastened around Draco’s arsehole; Potter’s spectacular arse, tight with muscle, clenching under Draco’s hands; Potter’s tiny arsehole, dark and ringed with hair...
It’s only many seconds later that Harry realises he’s holding his breath. Releasing it on a loud sigh, he throws himself into the chair Malfoy had vacated – Malfoy who is just sitting there, utterly still and silent, inexplicably filling Harry with panicked restlessness.
“Or was it this? Having your hands held down or something?” Potter’s barely whispering now, but Draco still flinches at his words as if they’d been bellowed into his face, bringing his free hand up to shove
Not even when Malfoy blushed again and yanked his hand back with a little scowl. Not even when he snapped at Harry to stop staring at him all day like a creep. Not even when he threatened to set Madam Pince on him if he didn’t stop grinning like a lunatic.
“Do it,” Draco whimpers mindlessly, barely aware of what he’s begging Harry to do, “Fuck, Harry, please, do it, I want it,
Malfoy was scorching hot around him, the grip of his arse so unyieldingly tight around Harry’s finger that he was momentarily worried about putting his cock in there. Harry waited two heartbeats and then dragged his finger out slowly, bit by bit, watching the way Malfoy’s mouth fell open, his face half hidden under one arm.
Neither of us is able to reply for a moment Draco uses the temporary shocked silence to snag what’s left of Ron’s pasty, while I stare at the side of Draco’s face, my stomach rolling with sudden discomfort.
Harry pressed their foreheads together, and for a while, they just stood like that. Draco brought his hands up to cradle Harry’s face, grazing the tip of his nose over his and following it up with a kiss.
Malfoy got to his feet and brushed dirt off his cloak. “I wasn’t trying to creep up on you. I was right behind you the whole time.”
“You could just Summon it,” Malfoy mumbled as he sat in this weird half-turned away pose and began to try and shrug his shirt off.
“Fuck, you’re tight,” Potter comments admiringly, twisting the digits through conjured lube, and starting to stroke his prostate with the pads of his fingers.
“Yeah, we’re several days overdue actually,” Potter informs him. “It’s been over a month since your last check-up. Hermione actually reminded me last week but—” he flushes lightly, “I dunno, I wanted to wait until you’ve settled in a bit before...”
“Ferrets are not rodents,” Harry mumbled, tugging at his earlobe, examining his shoes. When Draco only swelled further, rage building to a dangerous level, he hurriedly held up his hands. “I’ll—I’ll ... erm ... have a word with him ...?”
Malfoy’s mouth sags open, and he plucks his glasses off his nose to glare incredulously at Harry. “Are you on pain potions or are you simply inebriated?”
“Hey, you take care tonight,” Ginny says softly, reaching out and cupping his cheek before gently wiping off the streak of dirt she’d smeared. “Don’t land up drunk in a ditch somewhere, yeah?”
Another few weeks after that, we’d had to call in Curse Breakers after a midnight raid that had turned out to be all kinds of fucked up. Ron had been injured and I stood next to him as one of the emergency Medi-Wizards had checked him. When I’d looked up at one point, my stomach had plummeted to see Draco in the crowd gathered outside the old cursed mansion we’d raided. Draco had been looking at Ron’s supine form on the stretcher but when I looked up at him, he’d met my eye directly. Then his gaze wandered to my singed robes before landing on the pendant he’d gifted me, lying on my chest, the gold threads catching the moonlight. Ron and I had both been hit with curses. Only I’d escaped unscathed.
Potter gives him that crooked half-grin that makes Draco want to jump him, and leans in close. “Yeah, well,” he nuzzles Draco’s temple, “
Harry lifted his head just enough to be able to look up at him – to check if Malfoy looked smug about the fact that he would be
“Dose number three of the week for Mr. H. J. Potter,” comes a bored voice from behind the counter, “Standard Wolfsbane, certified brew by St. Mungo’s. Here’s the bill – bring that back with you tomorrow or you won’t receive the fourth dose.”
“That’s the potion hitting your bloodstream,” Draco nods, pushing himself to his feet, “You will have one dose per day, every day, Potter,” he adds.
, but an acceptable counter-manoeuvre, Malfoy,” Fox drawls, before clapping his hands together in a single, jarring smack that rings off the walls. “Alright, that’s it for today. Get your lazy arses out of here. See you next week.”
They don’t pull away when they break apart, staying pressed close and breathing each other’s air as they pant, brows pressed together. Potter’s eyes are shut and Draco’s are slightly crossed as he peers at him, watching the way his lashes flutter. They’re both hard, Potter’s need an insistent press against Draco’s hip, Draco’s cock twitching a damp spot in his pyjamas.
Blaise turns around and buries his face into Draco's thighs. It would be normal, if his fingers weren't as tense as they were, betraying the other's apprehension. "Did you mean it when you said you no longer cared about blood purity?"
“So more to the right of the Viaduct than the left,” Weasley nods. “Let’s get started then, shall we?”
"Did you mean it?" Blaise ambushes him not a minute later and Draco, who'd been busy leaning out to grab the bag of diamond beetles for Erthuira, almost falls off the bed.
Potter actually laughs at that, cheeks still blush-dark, smile bright and blinding, eyes crinkling at the corners for a few moments. Draco's amusement dies a stuttering death to make way for flaming homosexuality because fucking
“I absolutely cannot wait,” he says, but Draco’s so relieved he doesn’t pay attention to whatever Blaise is babbling on about, instead grabbing onto the arm around him and mushing his cheek into Blaise’s comfortable warmth. “For the day you figure it out. It’s going to be
"So?" Potter demands, scooping it up. "It's not a teacup anymore, is it? I think you look gorgeous, dear," He coos at the creature, "Don't listen to Malfoy, darling, he's just mad because you make a prettier dragon than him."
Potter frowns, the heat flickering out from his gaze as he straightens up to stare at Draco's curt dismissal, clearly disappointed with the lack of a fight. Draco bites the inside of his cheek and tries not to outwardly react- his own disappointment at not being able to spar aside, dear
"Someone turned Vince's legs into a mermaid tail," Draco replies and Professor McGonagall sighs and walks out of the classroom.
"And they're very nice dungeons, thank you very much," Draco sniffs. "You can take her for now to get her acclimatized, but I want her back tomorrow morning."
"Get your damn lizard, Draco!" Theo hollers and Draco mutters something uncouth and stumbles out of bed to grab Colette.
someone’s sick and collapses on a chair, closing his eyes. “And one of the connecting bridges, I suppose.”
Draco shakes him by the grip on his arm for a lack of better things to do and Potter blinks, the glaze over his eyes disappearing, and he straightens back up in a manner that suggests he hadn't even realized he was shrinking away from the others in the room. Draco frowns.
"WHY DID YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE POTION ANYWAY, WAS TURNING YOUR HAIR INTO FLOWERS TOO DEMEANING FOR YOU? COULDN'T YOU JUST STICK TO THE BOOK?"
“Because if we narrow it down to the famines that happened in England," Granger says waspishly. "Then we can possibly connect it with the tapestries or statues or portraits of Hogwarts and see if the next clue is there."
"What do you mean different ways to do portions?" She demands, holding it away from him. "Professor Snape said at the start of first year itself that if you tampered with the instructions, you would never get the portion you needed."
“You should consider it, Harry,” Ron says apologetically, taking Potter’s wand quickly as he turns to face the Weasel with a look of dramatic betrayal. “Your handwriting
"No!" Potter catches his hand, then says, "She'll get better sunlight in the Gryffindor dorms, you can't keep her in the dark!"
"Is this about him not looking at Potter at all during breakfast today?" Daphne says. "It's the talk of the school- people are already mourning the death of the most legendary rivalry this place has ever seen since Abraham and Joan."
“Well, there’s that at least,” Blaise says, even though he sounds discomfited. “Not scared of Azkaban, though? That’s concerning.”
"And you can ask Anthony Goldstein from Hufflepuff and his friends," Vince says cheerfully. "So you'll have a nice even number."
“To look for the Death Eater in the castle,” Longbottom explains. “We also invited Luna Lovegood, the Patil twins and Lavender Brown, by the way,” He says to Potter, who shrugs.
Draco scowls at him, taking a matching step forward, letting Brinette shake herself out and leap to Potter’s side. “How will you keep her out of the teacher’s sight? She isn't registered, you know. If they take her away because of you, Potter, I swear I will-”
"Ingrates!" He announces, and Potter growls at him even as it successfully captures everyone's attention.
and Potter immediately bristles up, poking a finger in his chest as he accuses, “What- You put salt in my treacle tarts and told me I needed to cut down on them last week, you bastard!”
"Consider this: no," Draco replies, looking up at where Professor Binns has moved onto the sixth century wars. "And if you're going to stay here and annoy me, take my notes."
he thinks at his stupid friend as he strides through the halls before Pansy can catch upto him, the younger students hurriedly moving out of his way as he passes.
Draco smiles before he can stop it, magic burning in his chest with happiness, and says, "Yeah, that's fine, Vince."
Draco bites his lip to hold back the words that want to come out of his mouth at that, some of them salacious, some of them disdainful, all of them liable to keep him up at night in regret and embarrassment, and gives Potter his sharpest, sweetest smile instead.
He forces himself not to squirm as everyone in the room stares at him, because a Malfoy should never display any self-consciousness. But his lip twitches slightly in a defensive snarl anyway and his hands curl slightly into fists. "What?"
," he repeats, painfully aware that most of the table is staring at them and grinning or giving him sympathetic looks. "I-"
"Look, can you just come back here?" Draco snaps. "I know you couldn't have gotten over all of it that fast, you berk. You're not-"
"Not like-" He struggles for the right words. "I do not mind if he gets help, if it does not count in the judge's marks."
Draco does not. You don’t spend three years hating someone without knowing when they’re lying either.
“Why don’t you lot search for them then, if you’re so worried?” Draco interrupts Granger with a snarl, and Finnigan looks at him belligerently and then straightens up with an air of determination and garbs a parchment to start scribbling. Draco assumes he's listing possible hiding places to be checked, which means there’s one less thing for the rest of them to be worried about. Even if the idiot gets killed, at least they’ll have an answer to if there
Oh. That. Draco purses his lips, but whatever, it's not like it matters in the grand scheme of things anyway. He can hold back on the disgust about Granger and the blood traitor if he's getting a fucking
Draco jerks to a halt to stare at him. Potter goes red and Draco slowly breaks into a smile, raising an eyebrow. “I wasn’t aware you cared about my well-being, Potter.”
"The Hufflepuff head of house said that he'd be-" Potter doesn't get any further than that, because Draco calmly sets his wand down on the table and then gracefully pounces clean across it and tackles him to the ground.
"Maybe we could get the Greengrasses to help?" He hears Vince's muffled voice suggest from behind as he climbs out of the Slytherin dorm and he rolls his eyes.
“I’ve already managed well enough these past two days,” Potter spits. “Hagrid taught us invisibility spells for animals and she’s smart enough to not make trouble in class.”
“Don’t shout, Blaise,” Granger murmurs into the table and hiccups. Astoria starts mimicking her immediately, giggling.
"You must not have done it well enough," He scoffs automatically, even though he's not exactly sure what he's condoning.
He doesn't answer, busy trying not to pant like a dog for breath, which only seems to incense Potter and his gang further, and their magic bristles up into the air threateningly.
Potter makes a face like he's just realizing how that sounds, then undoes the muffling charm on their desk- when did he do
Next time, I’m just going to let you fall to your death, Potter, potential accusations of murder be damned.”
"I suppose that's possible, considering how many people are in the castle at the moment," Weasley frowns, very much not getting lost, putting his hands on his hips. "We don't really know anything about the Beauxbatons or Durmstrang students."
“It’s good,” he says, grabbing it to take another sip and Draco flashes a I-told-you-so smirk at him. Potter hesitates and swirls the remaining sparking liquid in his cup a few times before offering it out silently.
“Let’s,” Potter snaps, and yanks his hand away, grabbing a blank parchment and sitting down at the table. He turns back as Draco pats his robes down and cleans himself up, and sends him that
“We’re going on a walk!” Pansy calls out, and Draco blinks as he realizes they’d already reached the dorms while he was lost in thought. They pass by, waiting until they know they’re alone before glancing at each other.
, Potter," He snaps, although his voice wavers a bit because it really looks darling, all cute beady eyes, magnificent feathers and glowing scales. "Plus it has two tails and disfigured front legs."
"I know where you are because can sense your eyes on me, idiot," Draco snaps, "You stare at me so often that at this point I'd be able to recognize you Polyjuiced by the sheer weight of your glare."
“Four,” Vince says and they look at him for the audacity. He shrugs. “Hannah Abbott is in half my classes. She asked me about you yesterday.”
"'And misery.'" Draco says, "Maybe I do need that appointment at St. Mungo's. I'm clearly going insane."
"I heard our name!" Astoria declares, grabbing onto Draco and using him as momentum to swing back around from where she was going to enter the dorms and crashes into Pansy gracefully. "Whatever do you require our services for, my favorite social experiments?"
, Draco grimaces, Potter slumping in dismay next to him. There's no way you can get around ancient binding artifacts, not without a huge enough sacrifice that leaves the person worse off than if they'd just gone through with the demands.
"Why am I even talking to you?" Blaise says scornfully, feathers sprouting on his arms as he brings his head back up, glaring at nothing. "You're the most Pureblood of any of us, and you probably were just lying to earn everyone’s trust anyway. Like
Of course, Potter flies after him immediately, his standard glare on him as they go back to the part of the bridge they were inspecting.
"A stick, Draco, yes," Goyle says reassuringly, and Draco crosses his arms and hisses at him to show that he hasn't missed how 'small' and 'little' haven't been denied. Again, it's not
"Hey, think of it this way,” Longbottom says with a grin, putting a hand around her shoulders. “At least now you know you also like girls.”
"We should ask a few Ravenclaws as well," Granger says, narrowing her eyes at him. "Ask Penelope Clearwater if she knows any good people."
Draco growls and grabs Potter's wrist with the full intention of breaking it again, but Clearwater suddenly shouts behind them, making them both jump.
With a nigh near stupendous show of either obliviousness or straight-up turning a blind eye to everyone staring at him, Potter ignores them all and walks back to the same table, pulling out worms to steal Cora’s loyalty with.
“Wait, wait,” Millicent says, frowning. “What about the firewhiskey I brought? Are we-” She looks around for Madam Pince, then lowers her voice, “Are we doing that today?”
"Well-" Potter looks over at him expectantly and Draco has to work to keep his expression blank and not wince. It is
Blaise shakes the entire bed as he sobs, feathers molting wildly around them, and Draco holds him as tight as he can and whispers nonsense calming sounds at him, one hand petting the other’s wings.
“Oh, please,” Potter says scathingly, “At least I can say that I know where you are because you never
"The library?" Astoria says dismally, though quiet enough to not get them kicked out. "Why are we- oh.
"Ten points to Slytherin," Severus says suddenly. "Now get back to class, you'll be informed of any further events. Why were you even in the hallway in the first place?"
"Where were you? We're going to be late for class!" Potter snaps when he skids round the corner- Malfoys shouldn't
He glances at her as they turn the corner and watches the mirth from fade, face becoming drawn and somber. “Blaise,” she says.
Draco takes a long breath to fortify himself, thinking up a few arguments. Normally, he wouldn't go into such a situation without a plan of attack and at least three back-up ones and five ways to exit in a dignified manner, but Potter always
“And the teachers also say not to cheat in exams," Pansy replies testily. "People still do that, don't they?"
He looks down and presses his fingers into Annelyn's body insistently out of view, and she gets the hint and trots over to Potter. Sure enough, the offended-upset-concerned expression slides right off the other's face and he coos happily at Roma- no, maybe Bellingham?- looking just as ridiculous as she does.
“Fair enough. Night, Potter, Gryffindors,” he nods at them and stands up, aware that the others will follow him because of the lure of the- dinosaur, was it? Dinosaur.
"I'm so confused," Parkinson wails, hanging off of him like an overgrown sloth. Forget Quidditch training, he was going to end up built like a bodybuilder just by lugging all his stupid heavy friends around this bloody school all day.
? Are you trying to get yourself killed? Not that I’ll be complaining- we’re clearly better off in the hands of Voldemort if the alternative is a stupid bumbling Gryffindor who jumps onto slanted roofs- you’re not even holding your broom, Potter!” He looks up incredulously at where he can see the smoke of the Firebolt hovering completely out of reach if Potter needs to grab it. "What were you
“Let's get back to it then, shall we?” He interrupts frigidly, and flies off before anyone can answer.
“Obviously, it was good alcohol, we’re not letting it go to waste,” Draco says, rolling his neck with a wince. Weasley had mistaken him for someone else at one point and hit him cheerfully on the back so hard that he’d gone stumbling into a table at a wrong angle. “You, house elf, get us something to eat.”
"Maybe I would have had time to, if you didn't stride along like your underpants were on fire," Potter snaps.
he slips in the bathroom and cracks his head on the stone floor while he's showering, leaving him ten minutes between first period and giving up Rinoca's comforting presence to the Gryffindors.
Draco, having no other option, does the same, brushing past everyone and walking stiff-legged over to the bookshelves.
“Shit, the Squid!” Potter exclaims, and promptly climbs onto the sandbank, his two shadows yelping and following him hurriedly.
"I wasn't lying," Draco blurts out and Blaise goes silent and still. "I-" He racks his brains, "-made a Muggle friend over the holidays, when I was going out to Diagon Alley and terrifyingly enough, he didn't seem to be any stupider than the lot of you."
talking about him when they complained about the magic polluters and he should be smart enough to know that, but even though Blaise would, he’d also be miserable for the rest of their time together. And Draco didn’t want that either, because he was Draco’s- ugh- his
Potter doesn't reply, still holding onto the outcropping of the wall he'd grabbed onto, head down and breathing hard.
“Yes, I did,” Draco replies, even though that had been a month ago and it was a fast and drunk thing that he barely remembers. He squints at an odd vine hanging down from one of the balconies, which turns out to just be spelled purple and blue for funsies. Probably to mislead them. “Why, do you have a problem with that?”
A flicker of anger crosses Potter's face even as he unzips the bag next to him and the bird-dragon springs out chirping and lands on the table in front of him. "She's not just
Draco deflates and looks at her. She probably needs that, doesn't she? "Fine, but I'm taking her during the day, then."
Potter curls into himself even further at that and Draco looks over with a frown. The Hufflepuffs didn't even
“We’ll discuss it when we meet up tomorrow,” she agrees, turning a page, like her knee hasn’t been bouncing nervously beneath the table this whole time.
all these years, right? None of us have," Draco evades, pushing concern into his voice. Blaise pushes his head further into Draco's pajamas silently and the half-fake concern twists into genuine distress. "
They stand there in silence helplessly until the Bell rings out, the torches on the fall going out one by one.
“Crying?” The Beauxbaton champion frowns, stepping forward, eyes raving over Potter, “How old are you?”
When he finally manages to compose himself and look over, Potter is aiming a hundred-watt smile at him, whole face lit up with joy, blinding in its intensity. Draco stumbles a bit over his robes as he comes to a halt and Potter somehow gets
"I called him a stick," Crabbe explains and Goyle snorts and gestures for Draco to hand him over. "A small, little stick."
There's a moment where the blood drains from everyone's faces, and then an immediate uproar from every single person in the room and

lost control. They’d been trying to get him to do it by accident for years, but he’d always had an ironclad grip on his thrall, no matter how hard they scared him or how happy they made him.
"Are you stalking me?" He demands. "How the fuck did you even know I was here- you're not even in this class!"
"Well, it's what they gave us!" Granger says, throwing her hands up. Draco bites back a snicker at her irritation and wonders how long it had taken for her to choke down her pride and ask others for help. Ask the

“You’re such an asshole,” Potter says through gritted teeth. “What the fuck got shoved up your ass this morning?”
"I think he meant more along the terms of 'the student body isn't supposed to know Harry's taking part in the competition'," Finnigan says, looking right at home in his own coat. "But yeah, if I hit my head on the rocks and drown, please don't try to find my body. Just let me lie on the bedrock with the squid for all eternity."
"I NEVER WANTED THE FUCKING SPOTLIGHT," Potter roars, throwing the bag in his hand to the ground in anger. "I NEVER PUT MY NAME IN THAT RUSTY OLD CUP, I NEVER WANTED TO BE A CHAMPION, I NEVER WANTED TO TAKE PART IN THIS FUCK-ALL COMPETITION!"

these past few days to miss out on the action because you two are on your time of the month. Everyone, put on your notice-me-not charms, I want you up in the air in five minutes.”
"Wha- that easily?" Potter says, dumbfounded, frowning like he's expecting Draco to demand half his wealth and sexual slavery from him in return for the creature growing up well taken care of.
thick skull and you've ended up with irreversible brain damage," Draco says finally. "But we are not
An arm falls around his shoulder as they trudge back as well and Draco looks up to see Blaise, magic calm for the first time since Draco had first lied about not caring about Purebloods, no longer skittish and rubbing against them with its feather-like texture and putting them all on edge.
Millicent smacks him in the shoulder and Draco steps on her foot. "There's more people here because we were searching for the Death Eater in the castle yesterday, and we had to tell them why we knew there was one and they wanted in," She says, "Speaking of, we're going to need your help with translations for interrogating the Beauxbaxtons later on,
"Alright, enough!" Astoria says crossly, pulling them apart by the robes like she's scuffing kits. "Have
"Well enough-" Potter sputters indignantly, looking two seconds away from either punching the stone wall or Draco. It speaks volumes about his intelligence that the probability of him disfiguring his knuckles on the wall is higher. "How can I
“She’s intelligent, she wouldn’t get confused,” Potter insists, “And you know that isn’t going to be happening anytime soon. I’m not letting you name her anything snobbish and posh like you’re trying to.”
Surprisingly, Potter snorts in response, then immediately looks guilty at laughing at his groupies. Draco, not for the first time, ruminates wonderingly on the absolute weirdness of the person in front of him. How irritatingly righteous of a morality do you have to have to not be able to laugh at your own friends?  But...no, Potter is smothering a smile with the back of his hand while still remarkably looking conflicted about it, reaffirming his place as a human being with emotions other than anger and high-handedness, and Draco unwillingly feels a smile pulling at his own lips in victory.
“I don’t want to, quite honestly,” Weasley replies. “I’m going to forget that ever happened. Let’s go find the books.”
“Does anyone know how his other half took this rejection actually?” Pansy interrupts, lolling further onto him so she can look back at the others. "I'm morbidly curious."
He gets suspicious looks for his trouble, and he sneers back at the insufferable brutes and gets silent snarls and curled fists in response, which is about par for the course of their daily interactions.
He shrinks back as everyone stares at him, and then explains quickly, “I’ve been tracking his sightings. It’s not him.”
“You-” Potter hisses, then stops suddenly, mouth curling in anger. It looks like it nearly hurts him to keep his mouth shut, a vein visible on the side of his head with how tight he clenches his jaw, and Draco raises an eyebrow at him, his own anger strangely simmering down for curiosity to take its place. Potter wasn't one to ever hold back his accusations, however insane it made him sound.
“It’s the fact that he lost control after you said blood purity wasn’t important,” Pansy says finally and Draco inhales sharply, heart skipping a beat, and looks over at her.
“What about him?” Draco frowns, leaning out to look at their ally, who’s currently baby-talking Elanor while Greg and Vince feed her the treats Draco had bartered away from a sixth-year with a parrot familiar. He
She laughs louder and throws an arm around his shoulder. “Yeah, sure, sure. But that’s not what I wanted to talk about.”
There's a quiet rustle as Blaise's wings unfurl around them, and then he slowly looks up at Draco with his face screwed up and tears in his pearlescent white eyes.
"-wouldn't listen!" Potter finishes, and Draco blinks, focusing on what the other is ranting about so that
"She's not that bad!" She protests vehemently, and Draco raises his eyebrows and exchanges a glance with an amused Blaise. He ignores the guilt-threaded mess of emotions that shoot through him as their gazes catch, that have been plaguing him every time he makes eye contact with the other, instead smirking over the free blackmail Astoria had given to them on a silver platter.
Potter rolls his eyes and Draco moves the inkwell out of the way right before his elbow would have knocked it over. "Yeah, yeah, alright you great bloody show-off. We get it, you all like posh stuff and old things."
"Much, yes," Theo replies, immediately nicer than he's been in the entire last year to the rest of them combined. He's smiling widely when Draco pulls his eyes open again, and staring at Greg with a look that most people would describe as belonging to a serial killer on Amorentia and what their gang describes as being embarrassingly in love. "Madam Pomfrey said the fever's gone at last, so I can stay in the dorms and should be able to come to classes again in a few days."
"I thought it was a simple conclusion to draw!" Draco protests. If Potter had figured it out, he thought the adults would have as well. But clearly not, since McGonagall only groans and buries her face in her hands and the rest of the teachers are badly masking expressions of fear.
radiate a truly stupendous amount of heat, so much so that he can feel it from where their hands almost touch as Oscar runs over, so he partially forgives her.
"Who needs a kneazle when we have him?" He hears Greg say fondly as he walks away, and Draco smiles where no one can see it in the empty hallway.
"It's called tradition, Potter. Tradition and values," Draco says, sweat breaking out on his forehead as he continues Transfiguring the bird to a dragon and back.
"Draco's going insane, to answer your question," Blaise says over Pansy's shouting as Draco uses her as a human shield against Astoria's indignant smacking. "We need your help to sneak him out and get help."
Draco likes Sirius because he is also gay and trans and has the Vibes. Also i just think the wix should all fistfight each other a bit. Builds character.
shit!" He drops his wand with a hiss, shaking his hand out. The teacup is now stuck between transfigurations as a bird-dragon hybrid, gold and blue and blinking at him. "Twenty-seven."
"Nope! Apparently our dear Draco Malfoy, for the first time since he set foot on Hogwarts grounds, didn't look over at Harry Potter even
Potter grabs his hand at the last moment as the others shamble out of the room. He smiles, rosy-cheeked with drink and magic too strong and curious for Draco’s continuing mental health.
"Wondering if you can kidnap and stash me away in a Body-Bind to lengthen the lifespan of darling Regina, yes, I see," Draco nods. "It won't work, by the way. I did not have the only blemishes on every single report card I've received be 'He talks too much in class', for the likes of
They're all silent for a few seconds as they digest that, and then the tension snaps and they all burst into laughter.
!” Potter hisses, cheeks red in mortification and Draco digs his nails into the other arm before he ruins the whole thing.
"Cunts," Draco mutters as he slings his bag up higher and makes his way outside. It’s a nice day- cloudy and windy and cool- so he takes his homework out to the edge of the Great Lake. The hill the castle is built on steeps down straight into the water, but Severus had told him about a small patch of land at the very middle of it, a sandy bar which you have to wade through the shallows to get to, well worth it for the privacy and the quietness and overall being the most peaceful place in the whole school.
“Because I am well aware that you hold the warmth advantage in this little custody battle of ours, and like hell I’m going to pass up a chance to beat you up,” Draco sniffs, tilting his nose up.
He sneers and sits down next to him, snatching up a quill and drawing quick margins. Around them, the others are already one cup into the vintage firewhiskey Millicent had smuggled in, much more amiable in their conversations than they would usually be.
"My life does not revolve around Harry Potter," He says indignantly. "I don't have to be paying attention to him every single day, do I? I don't want to deal with his stupidity today, that's all."
Harry, watching Draco's attention go to the Slytherin for 0.5 seconds after they wasted an hour of everyone's time because he had Draco's attention, and then seeing him kiss Pansy on the cheek platonically: I am filled with unbridled rage. This is normal.
“They obviously tampered with the cup, so they must be in the castle!” Finnigan cries out, “They could be waiting to kill us all in our sleep!”
“Did something happen?” Pansy demands as she slides into the seat next to him and Draco drops his head into the cross of his arms with a groan. Relentless bitch. “Draco if you don’t tell me this second, I swear to Godric-”
Draco opens his mouth instinctively to argue, but catches sight of Ida yawning, showing all three sets of adorably small teeth. He smiles and gently picks her up- he really hopes she likes the bed he’d made for her. It was temporary- he was definitely going to order her something appropriate for her regal status, but he’d transfigured multiple stolen notebooks into pillows and sheets so the bed he had currently wasn’t half-bad either.
"Are you feeling colder than usual? Do you have a headache? How many fingers am I holding up?" Pansy shoots one question after the other, worried enough that she doesn't so much as blink when Vince grabs some of her fries.
Draco: I'm going to pretend to accept blood purity so that me and my friends can take part in this tournament.
“Oh, well, we’ll have to take full advantage now then. I want to ask Hinto how he got that graffiti on the Gryffindor tower to stay so resilient,” The first one says, cracking his knuckles. “You lot are the talk of the school, by the way. People think you’re all Imperiused, or are dying. Personally, I put my money on temporary insanity.”
"You bitch," Draco groans when he can see again, twisting out of the tangle of their limbs to the sound of Crabbe and Nott's raucous laughter and Vince’s rumble of amusement. "See if I order you rare mice ever again."
“Oh yeah,” Daphne mutters, pushing- Cora? Agnes? Edith?- out of the way. “Some of these letters are definitely old Latin. Not all of them, though.”
"Yes, thank you, Mr. Malfoy," Severus drawls from the corner, and Draco tries not to wince. He's going to hear passive aggressive jibes from his godfather all week for this entire display.
" Draco snarls, reaching over to pinch Nott, who slaps him in return. "She's staying with us. And you will
Draco scoffs at the display, sneering even though he’s extremely outnumbered and backed into a corner with volatile Gryffindors. “Are you lot
, Malfoy," He says, voice cracking in sheer happiness. "Seriously, I can't believe you did that, you have no idea how much I didn't want to do the Triwizard. I mean, you’re still a right bastard, but- what do you say we have a temporary truce, hm? Until I can pay you back for this."
He forgets the apples, but his queer heart can only take so much, so he forgives himself and he goes to lie face-down on his bed between a snoring Vince and Greg for the rest of the afternoon instead.
“Pansy, love,” He repeats, all of their smirks glinting sharp in the sunset as she jerks back to life and looks around at them with the clear expression of someone who’s just realized they’ve fucked up. “Do you have anything you want to tell us?”
Unfortunately his good mood barely has time to sink in, because a moment later as he rounds the corner someone crashes into him at full speed and nearly knocks them both to the ground.
, you overgrown mushroom," Draco snaps at her, reaching out and throwing all his weight into getting everyone to resume moving.
in our dorm room?" Theo says, shuffling over, with a wary stare at the animal currently trilling happily as Greg spoils her with her fourth bag of treats. (She’s only been alive a grand total of three days- the idiot is going to get overfed and barf into Draco’s shoes again, he just knows it.) Theo drops down by Blaise, throwing his leg over Draco's and he narrows his eyes at her one last time before shuffling in closer for warmth.
“You know, for all your posturing and expensive lifestyle choices, you really stink today, Malfoy,” Potter says and Draco is immediately filled with a truly stupendous amount of bloodlust.
“Oh,” Pansy replies in a completely different tone, breathless and wide-eyed. “Ye-yeah, of course. Sorry.” She adds offhandedly, never tearing her eyes away from Abbott in front of her, and Longbottom rolls his eyes and splays one hand over his face as if to protect himself from the second-hand embarrassment the lesbians are exuding onto everyone in a half-mile radius as he walks away.
come to Malfoy Manor and promptly been thrown out with a lot of yelling, barely missing the Ministry officers. "Black wispy hair too. Till his shoulders."
“What is that supposed to mean?” Granger says indignantly and Draco derails the conversation before it starts.
Millicent leans over and studies the paper, tapping the ones she doesn't, and Potter reaches out with his wand and spells them golden. They pass the paper around and scribble it down, splitting up to find books on the unknowns.
make him go before the audience arrives and let him finish his tasks in front of the judges to appease the Cup," Professor McGonagall muses.
"But how did they even get in the castle?" Potter frowns. "Dumbledore says at the very least the wards would have notified them if someone with the Dark Mark walked through them."
Abbott grins lopsidedly at Pansy. “See you in the Griff common room at ten,” She says and slugs her in the arm awkwardly before jogging away after her friends.
you idiot," He snaps, moving closer and glaring. "You can't keep backtalking them and expect them to hear what you have to say!"
They work in tandem for a long while, bickering and spitting insults at each other. Draco has the field advantage of- well, quite frankly, saving Potter’s life, even if he doesn’t think the other can ever actually truly die sometimes- and he takes full advantage of it whenever he’s losing any ground.
but no one manages to speak up legibly before Dean Thomas smacks the table and snaps, “He’s already going with me.”
“You two done?” Thomas perks up, with the slightly vacant expression of someone who’s completely sloshed. “Have some firewhiskey!”
"Hey! It's bad enough that you two nitwits cost us precious study time as it is," She snaps, coming up to them with all the authority of a student in a higher grade, power that the teachers
"Do you want to sleep with them?" Astoria asks interestedly, and Draco supposes that's an option too.
"Not if you use bits of self-fertilizing shrub and stir anticlockwise," He replies in the same nasty tone, narrowing his eyes.
Blaise and Vince open their eyes as well, the three of them exchanging a pained grimace as Theo completely melts at Greg's words, grinning happily. Theo's been smitten with Greg for about three years now, with apparently no intention of ever confessing. And that was pretty understandable- what with Greg being unfortunately straight and just as in love with Daphne.
Potter scowls, but unfortunately seems desperate enough to start scribbling down whatever is written on the chalkboard. "Oh, come off it, will you? It's written in some old language that none of us could read, and since you're so… snobbish and have that whole 17th century prince thing going on-"
“Yes!” Potter says, and Draco swears that if this infuriating bloke is homophobic as well, he’s casting an Unforgiveable, Chosen One or not. “You can’t just sleep around! What if you- I don’t know, catch something?”
“Not that the thought of that isn’t absolutely delightful,” Draco interrupts, grimacing, “But can you three nutters get out of the Great Lake before-”
"Good," Thomas shrugs. "One of them stole all my scrolls yesterday. They deserve to be traumatized by a corpse or two."
“The next clue must be somewhere here,” Potter says instead and Draco reminds himself that he has not fallen low enough to push a drunk person off a cliffside, no matter how tempting it is.
Vince laughs into his neck and continues to not be of any use as Draco drags them awkwardly along the length of the castle to get to the Slytherin dorms. "You're so weird," He says, amused, "I'm normal heavy, it's just that you're a small little stick. And you
“A Death Eater came to my house for shelter," He says flippantly, seeing Longbottom flinch out of the corner of his eye and carefully not feeling anything about it. "I wasn't in the room when they arrived of course, and they were swiftly removed from the property, but I heard them mention Potter a few times. And before they were thrown out, they said that they'd let the Triwizard Tournament 'take care of it before he arrives', which I assume means that they’re going to try and kill him.”
"We'll all copy the riddle down then," She says bossily and Draco imagines hexing her. "They're all different languages, right?"
"You kinda are," A third-year says and Blaise stops checking his pulse to burst into laughter. "Luckily, he's just as bad, otherwise you'd be an embarrassment to the whole house."
Draco raises an eyebrow. "What's wrong, Potter? Too tired from running away from all your adoring fans? I suppose all the attention
"Fine with me," Draco mutters and flies away quickly. He very valiantly ignores the odd cold sense of loss that comes with finally getting rid of Potter, like preparing for a fight with a Devil's Snare that's invaded your front yard while your parents were out, arming yourself and the house-elves for a match to the death, and then finally finding out it was actually a bunch of manure spelled purple and covered in the pollen you're allergic to, leaving an irritating prickling sensation over your entire body for a week, the only thing that makes you feel less restless being almost falling into the fire to absorb its heat.
"I wanted to see what it would do," He admits in the end. "It either would have turned purple and your fingers would turn into vines, or blue and your toes would turn into vines."
“Bring Enoch with you when you come down,” Draco calls out, an uncomfortable prickling on his skin at Potter acting the way he is.
They don’t get a chance to talk about it the next day, because Granger ambushes him in the school's daily early morning run around the castle to talk about the Triwizard, and ten minutes later the rest of her group accosts them as well.
“Yeah, sure,” She says, before shaking herself a bit when Abbott stares at her in shock at the sound of her informal voice, high and breathy. She clears her throat and mounts her holly and diamond broomstick stiffly. “I’ll find you when I’m free.”
"Yes, but it was my spell and my teacup," Draco hisses back, petting the top of her head gently. "And look at the state of
can convince them, can you?" Potter snaps, putting his hands on his waist and moving closer. He smells of shampoo, the wildness of the forbidden forest and the enticing sparks of fire when you get close enough, possibly a side effect of the Firebolt. "Get them to listen to your every whim?"
“Um-” Someone in front of him says questioningly and his temper snaps back up just as fast as it had disappeared, and he curls his wand up to cast a low-level blasting charm at the floor between him and Potter.
At least Potter has the decency to look a bit abashed at this one. "Yeah, well," He says and then doesn't explain anything. "Remember how Dumbledore said I could get help for the tournament from some of my friends? Well, the first riddle came in and Hermione said to come ask for your help because even if you are a twat, you might be able to figure it out."
“I don’t know, now that I’m reaping the rewards of it, it doesn’t seem all that bad,” Potter whispers, leaning in closer until they’re inches away from each other. Draco digs his nails into his palms, wishing desperately that he could punch this infuriating fucker in the face without getting kicked out of the group. “Thanks
“Oh, like you don’t eat strawberry candies like they’re your last meal before you’re due to hang,” Potter says nastily, crossing his arms.
Murmurs of assent follow, and Potter stretches his hands in the air with a sigh, showing a sliver of skin as his shirt rises, because for some reason he does not wear the school robes after classes are done, like most of the Muggleborns in the school.
Draco hums and signs his name on the parchment, holding the half broken quill out to Potter. He signs and Asgorin chirps and jumps up between them as the magic binds the three of them together.
if you two weren’t at each other’s throats and skulking after the other like cats in heat the entire time, you realize that?” She demands. “Minutes!”
“Every last one of you owes me favors,” He declares to the groaning mess of teenagers when they’ve downed the potions.
“Manipulation, yes?” Potter says under his breath. “I want Bria on the weekends, or else I’ll tell your friends that you’re a Hufflepuff at heart.”
"Don't be fucking rude," He snaps and Draco's temper sparks back up immediately, hands curling into fists.
Everyone looks up at him immediately, the clattering of their spoons and plates coming to a halt, and more than a few conversations around them die out.
be clearer in saying 'I didn't put my name in the Goblet of Fire and I don't want to take part in this competition'?"
“Let it go, Hermione,” Weasley says cheerfully, filling up another round of cups and passing them over. “Just have some more alcohol and relax.”
“Yea, but food tastes so much more nicer when y’r hungry,” Abbott says, smacking the table in tune with her words.
, not yell out the first bull-headed sentence that comes to mind; no teacher is going to listen to you that way. Then again, you are a Gryffindor, so I suppose the curse of bull-headedness is incurable."
By third period, he’s in a truly terrifying mood, not bothering to wait for anyone as he storms out of the classroom, head still throbbing from it's introduction to the bathroom tile and getting worse.
Belinda chirps in agreement on his shoulder, and he pats her gratefully even as he bullies everyone down to the kitchen.
Also literally the only goddess i will ever bow to, distantlullaby, read through the work and called Harry a manic pixie dream girl and that's all I'm going to write him as.
Potter inhales deeply and then thrusts his wand out at Weasley. “Ron, take my wand before I hex this bastard. And no, I didn’t even know those existed.”
Potter’s voice in his head taunts him suddenly, and he has to stop in the middle of the hallway to shake with sheer anger for a few moments, hands curled into fists.
No, don't answer that, clearly you don't possess any modicum of basic self-preservation or sense, I don't know what else I expected!"
Of course, annoying idiot that he is, Weasley doesn't answer, waving a hand dismissively. “Never mind that,” he says, “Are you telling me actual
She shoves her metal plate into Longbottom's arms and goes to walk away when Abbott suddenly crosses her arms and looks at her reproachfully and Pansy stutters to a halt with all the grace of an infant eight-legged giraffe.
He feels the smallest of smiles play on his lips as he hears Potter yell obscenities as he walks away, abruptly going silent to be replaced by the sound of a teacher scolding him and docking points from Gryffindor, even if he doesn’t feel any of the satisfaction penetrate the mess of emotions in his chest.
The laughter that rings out is louder than it has been the past few days and Draco stops staring into the distance and pondering whether it was possible for the Forbidden forest to support a herd of kelpies at the sound of it.
harder to fool his Slytherins than it is the teachers and the Gryffindors- you don’t grow up playing cards and stealing each other’s clothes and convincing each other’s parents that they’re at each other’s Manors while secretly trying to fly to Switzerland to see the Aurora Borealis without knowing everyone’s tells and tics when they’re lying.
Draco resolves, feeling slightly shaken. He reaches out to grab the paper and quills kept in the middle of the table and slides them out to the others to hide the discomfort sinking its cold claws into his chest.
Dumbledore is the first person who manages to get themselves together, asking neutrally, "What are you doing here, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Play along, Pansy," Blaise says grimly. "We have to go along with what he says until we can find a way to alert someone discreetly for help."
SORRY for the lag and also not responding to comments, depression is kicking my ass and i also had no idea where this fic was going i only planned the beginning and the end.
Draco curls back in shock, then grits his teeth and says in his most venomous tone, “I thought manipulation went against all your moral failings, Potter. After all, it’s
"Fuck- don't dislocate my shoulder, you bloody twat!" Potter yells at him as Draco tows him down the hallway, and Draco smirks and puts that one away for his argument in the stick debate that he's going to have later. "Where are we going?"
"I still think we're overthinking it," Daphne says, resuming her pretend jogging as a teacher passes by and then going back to walking as soon as they're out of sight. “The first line is literally telling us that it’s supposed to be simple.”
However, while Draco was content to wait, Harry wasn’t. A week into the new term, Draco heard a knock on his door and opened it to find Harry on the other side, proffering a pack of beer with a questioning smile. It wasn’t an apology as much as an olive branch, an offering to move into the future without the tension of their fight looming over them. It was also a nod to the first time Harry had visited Draco’s room, and Draco’s lips quirked into a smile at the memory.
"Trust me," Draco said firmly. "You don't want to date me. You want to leave before you end up hurting yourself unnecessarily."
Instinctively, Draco wrapped his hand around the tattoo, clenching his fingers until his nails dug into his skin. He was certain he could feel a bruise already blossoming, but he welcomed it with a sick sort of pleasure. He deserved it. If he could take back every ounce of pain he had caused another person, he would do so without hesitation. "And I regret taking it every day." Draco glanced over his shoulder to look Yaxley in the eyes. "I'm finished, Yaxley. I'm not one of you anymore. I won't be coerced into doing this kind of dirty work again." He stalked away before Yaxley could reply, shoulders squared and strides long.
Harry didn’t approach the end of break with the same relief, though. He caught Draco when Draco was in the middle of packing up his things, just days before Draco could move out. “We need to talk,” he said, arms crossed and shoulders tensed.
Still, Draco felt oddly attracted to the man, drawn to him as though by a magnetic force. His mouth seemed suddenly dry, and he had some difficulty thinking of something to say.
The one thing he couldn’t control, however, was the nightmares, and soon Draco’s reassurances weren’t enough for Harry. The brunette turned the light on and sat up after the sixth night Draco had woken them both up, a serious look settling in his green eyes. “Please tell me what’s wrong, Draco,” Harry asked, voice tinged with desperation. “I’m your boyfriend, let me help you. I care about you, and I’m worried. Please.”
at the cause of that scar you hate so much. Did you think I was too stupid to notice? But I didn’t push. We both have our scars. I thought you, of all people, would understand.”
"Well, if you insist, Harry," he drawled imperiously, with a melodramatic roll of his eyes. He couldn't let Harry think he was a total pushover, after all.
The moment he and Harry were alone, Draco crossed over to Harry and pulled him into a deep kiss. "What do you say we celebrate Weasley's departure by defiling his bed?" he whispered conspiratorially.
And he would fix this somehow. Despite his best intentions, he had fallen hard for Harry, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing him so soon after experiencing what true freedom was like.
But no one had reacted negatively. No matter how many times Draco combed through the memory to process it, he couldn’t deny that. And not only that, but he had actually been paid a compliment. A compliment! Had he really spent so long fearing his Mark for nothing?
“I’d been on my way to apologize,” Draco said finally, unable to bear it. “To explain everything. You were right; I shouldn’t have let my fears control me like that.”
Reluctantly, Draco turned to face Lucius, rearranging his own features into a more neutral expression. Lucius had the upper hand in this confrontation. Draco would have to manipulate the situation carefully if he wanted to escape with his and Harry’s lives intact. He met Lucius’ gaze evenly, ignoring Harry as he tried to speak around the gag in his mouth, and waited for Lucius to break the impasse.
Draco bottled away his internal turmoil for the time being. He knew his eyes looked unfocused, gazing into space as the memories crashed over him unbidden. "To hide a mistake," he finally offered, and he knew that Potter understood.
A knot of horror supplanted the anger Draco felt, growing more potent with each second. But Draco didn't let his uneasiness break through his facade, focusing instead on regaining control of the confrontation. "You grow bolder in the absence of my father," he noted coldly. "As though you forget that I, too, am a Malfoy." The reminder cowed Yaxley somewhat. At the very least, he stopped smirking, which Draco counted as a small victory. He let his words hang between them for another minute. "Tell me, then, why Father believes I will change my mind. Tell me why he cares so much to send anyone at all, or why I would come with you when I have made my feelings clear."
He could weigh his options, but he already knew there was only one course of action he could take. Harry’s safety and wellbeing came before Draco’s emotions. Even now, in the face of Harry’s anger and upset, Draco couldn’t tell him about the Death Eaters. So instead, he buried his inner turmoil and fracturing confidence under a stony façade, and he did what he’d been born and raised to do: he attacked Harry’s weaknesses.
With a violent shudder, Draco pushed the memories back. Harry dropped a gentle kiss to Draco's lips, and Draco lost himself in the sensation for a moment. All of a sudden, his breath seemed to rattle too harshly in the stagnant silence permeating the flat, broken only by the quiet hum of the traffic outside.
all of that was? You better start talking, Draco, because the moment my legs stop feeling incorporeal, I will leave, and you will be dead to me.”
Draco quirked a rueful smile. He couldn’t deny that. “I fucked up. A lot. I’m not asking for forgiveness for any of it. But I owe you an apology and an explanation, even if you don’t accept either.”
But he couldn’t focus on that right now. This distance, while painful, was a blessing in disguise, letting Draco devote the entirety of his focus to dealing with Yaxley without having to keep Harry at bay, too. If Draco played his cards properly, he could sort this all out and then reconcile with Harry on his own terms; he refused to do so on the Death Eaters’.
Potter complied with a chuckle and sat at the opposite end of the couch, mirroring Draco's position. Draco stared at him a little suspiciously, trying to guess whether Potter had done this on purpose, but then Potter passed over a bottle opener and Draco's focus shifted.
When they entered Draco’s room, Draco gestured vaguely to his couch before moving to place the pistol on his desk. He stood still for a moment, mesmerized by the glinting gunmetal. Then he shook himself out of his reverie, filled an empty glass with water, and passed it to Harry where he had curled up on the couch, all the while trying to ignore the way his hands were trembling. Harry accepted the water with a brief nod and a stony expression.
“You can’t just shut people out every time you get scared, Draco!” Harry said suddenly, nearly shouting in an effort to reach across the distance Draco had put between them. “You’re not the only one who had a stake in this relationship. You don’t get to decide for me how things end, or how I’ll feel in the future.”
Draco was shaking his head before Harry had even finished speaking. “It was nothing,” he said. “Just a bad dream. Certainly you’ve had those, too?”
Draco couldn’t help his sharp intake of breath, nor the way he twisted his left arm to jam his Mark into his hip, but he managed to square his shoulders and draw himself to his full height. “What have you done with him?” he asked coldly, his mind racing to determine the most likely scenario.
His decision was coming back to bite him now. He wore a facade when he was around Harry, pretending to be strong and confident and worthy of Harry's attention, but he couldn't maintain it forever. Sooner or later, Harry would discover the secrets hiding behind Draco's mask. He would learn about the deceit and guilt buried beneath Draco's skin like a second layer, eating away at Draco like an itch he couldn't reach.
Draco said nothing, sifting through Potter's words and formulating a reply. Potter apparently took his silence for rejection, for he stood up with a sad smile. "Look, I get it. If you don't want to get out with me, I won't bug you again. I just thought it was worth a try." He hesitated a moment longer, and then turned around to walk away.
He forced himself to pull away finally, his work ethic taking precedence over his burgeoning feelings for Harry. "I'll text you," he said.
In the end, his commitment to academic success won out. He dropped his left hand into his lap and pressed his forearm against his waist. In this position, the majority of the Mark was hidden from sight, and Draco could focus on keeping the panic welling in his chest at bay.
"You are turning into Weasley and I wholeheartedly do not approve," Draco declared. He turned away with a haughty sniff.
“It didn’t feel right without you,” Draco said. It was another lie; he’d simply forgotten in the aftermath of Yaxley’s visit.
"I knew this was an awful idea," Draco lamented to Harry in a mournful whisper. Harry's expression fell immediately, but Draco ignored it and powered on. "I actually liked their ice cream and now I can never go back to that shop."
Draco laughed but there was no humor in the sound. "You think that now, but you have no idea. I was known as the Ice Prince back home, did you know?" he revealed. "Draco Malfoy, the heartless bastard with a perpetual stick up his ass, the emotional range of a rock, and lips that are probably cold as ice." The insults rolled easily off his tongue due to the frequency with which they'd been flung at him in the past. They didn't hurt him anymore as they once had, but perhaps they would warn Potter away.
Draco was still for a moment, taken aback by Harry’s easy assumption that they would be spending next Christmas together. A pang of guilt shot through him. Harry had no reason to be aware of the complications Draco would soon be facing, nor would Draco let him find out. That conviction spurred him into action again, and he carefully unwrapped the package in his hands.
Draco froze. He kept his eyes trained on his duffel. He had hoped he would be able to make it to the start of term before being confronted by Harry, but it seemed he had hoped for too much. “Alright.”
Harry tsked dismissively. “We can go out together. This way you know you’re getting me something I’ll like, and I’ll be able to guilt you into spending an exorbitant amount of money to make up for it.” His eyes brightened then. “Did you open your gift?”
"No, me neither," Harry agreed, his voice still hoarse. He fiddled aimlessly with the plastic bottle, tossing it back and forth between his hands. Draco waited silently for a moment longer, thinking Harry might be more inclined to speak now that he had had a few minutes to calm down. Indeed, Harry opened and closed his mouth several times, but to Draco's irritation, nothing came out.
"Then we're having our first date right now," Harry declared, mercifully releasing his grip as they neared the stairs so that Draco could balance himself. "My treat, obviously." He reached the bottom of the stairwell before Draco could and waited impatiently for Draco to finally step onto the ground floor. Then he had hold of Draco's hand again, scarcely waiting for Draco to regain his footing before pulling him along again.
arms. To his dismay, Draco finally remembered he’d fallen asleep wearing Harry’s t-shirt, which had sleeves capped just inches below the shoulders. His Mark was now on full display.
When Harry said nothing more, Draco asked the question that had been plaguing him all evening. "Why didn't you keep acting?" he asked, his voice breathy as Harry continued pressing kisses in a trail down his collarbone. "Did you really hate it that much?"
"Of course, sorry! Thank you!" said the first girl, her chirpy voice too loud in the now-silent cafe. The pair retreated to their own table as Draco waited for Harry to pick up his trash to throw away.
There was no doubt Yaxley had returned to London to report to Lucius about his meeting with Draco, and Draco knew Lucius would not let Draco's disobedience remain unpunished. At best, Lucius might send a team to retrieve Draco, by force if necessary. But Draco could handle that with ease; he'd practically grown up in the gang, and he'd learned early on how to hold his own against nearly any opponent. Unfortunately, Lucius probably knew that as well, which meant it was unlikely he would leave Draco's retrieval to chance and subordinates once again.
Once inside, they grew subdued in favor of consuming their meals, though occasionally, Draco would catch Harry's eyes and mime a particularly amusing moment from the film, or vice versa, and they would devolve into another spate of muffled giggles.
Harry smiled. He pushed himself off the bed and crossed the room until he was standing in front of Draco. Taking Draco's face in his hands, he pressed a soft kiss to Draco's lips.
Draco sighed impatiently, fed up with Weasley's failed attempts at subtlety. "Weasley, I will have Harry all to myself for over a month. I assure you, I will find ways to keep him entertained." He drew the final word out suggestively, leering at Harry as he did so. Weasley's face reddened, but he finally picked up his own luggage, hugged Harry one more time, and walked out of the flat.
Potter cut him off with another laugh. "I'm just saying, it's not really up to you to tell me what's good for me, is it? Unless you can read my thoughts, in which case maybe you really are mental," he said. "I can decide for myself whether or not liking you would have consequences."
He turned toward Harry, whose expression had gone blank. Montague had relaxed as well, settling into a comfortable slouch as he watched the confrontation between Lucius and his son play out.
Draco knew it was an absurd thought the moment he had it. Harry was completely unaware of how deeply Draco’s world had been shaken just days before, nor did his behavior suggest he had grown tired of Draco. But the fear lingered in the forefront of Draco’s mind until the moment Harry returned to the room and sat back down on the bed.
"Far be it from me to divine a Malfoy's intentions," Yaxley said primly, his sudden subservience a mocking contrast to his previous brazenness. His lip curled then as he made his scorn for Draco known, and Draco's anger returned tenfold. "Feel lucky that you are being offered another chance to begin with, instead of asking such insolent questions. Mistress Narcissa fought hard to grant you pardon, though Master Lucius asserted, rightly so, that you did not deserve it. Do not let her efforts go to waste."
The start of term crept up on them without a warning. Draco met it with a sense of relief. Soon, he would be able to move back into his dorm room, away from Harry’s disappointment and concern. He would be able to confront his father on his own terms, without worrying about keeping Harry in the dark. For a brief moment, he felt guilty that he was looking forward to leaving Harry, but he pushed the guilt aside with the knowledge that he could keep Harry safe this way.
, not when he was young and foolish, and certainly not now despite his older age and increased maturity. He had almost come to expect the unexpected, to as much of an extent as the unexpected could be expected, and he made it a point to no longer let it faze him. So when a month after their chance encounter, he received a call from the front desk stating that a boy named Harry Potter was asking for Draco to buzz him in, Draco simply released a long-suffering sigh and accepted his fate.
“But not now. And not soon,” Harry concluded. “You wouldn’t have said anything until you’d run yourself ragged trying to achieve whatever outcome you’re holding out for, would you?”
in flames, I’ll happily help,” he snarled. “There is so much you don’t know about me, Harry, so much that you don’t
“If they’re friends, Master, they’re like no friends I’ve ever seen,” Yaxley replied with obvious relish. Draco wanted nothing more than to take a pair of brass knuckles to the older man’s torso, even as the sense memory of flesh tearing under metal brought bile rushing back up his throat. “Had their hands and mouths all over each other.”
If Draco had to guess, he would say Lucius would come to fetch Draco himself, especially once he learned about how Draco had challenged him when speaking to Yaxley. And if Lucius came to get Draco, there was no doubt he would try to use Harry as leverage to convince Draco to return to London. That thought scared Draco more than anything; he couldn't let Harry get caught in the crossfire of Draco's mistakes.
He led Yaxley to a park he had come to with Harry just a week ago, wincing as he noticed the easy familiarity with which Yaxley navigated through what should have been an unfamiliar location. This, combined with how easily Yaxley had found Draco in the crowd before, left no doubt in Draco's mind that Yaxley or one of his associates had been tailing Draco for days now. Aside from raising questions as to whether Harry was also being followed and why Draco hadn't noticed earlier, the knowledge left a bitter taste in Draco's mouth. How many intimate moments between him and Harry had Yaxley been a witness to?
He had stormed toward Draco as he spoke, his steps even and purposeful, his cane nothing more than an accessory. A façade. Draco was so sick of facades, had spent his whole life crafting one for himself only for it to turn to rubble anyway. Lucius traded in facades, in masks and caged hearts and secrets and lies, and in him Draco saw everything he would rather die than become.
When they finally curled into each other an hour later, drowsiness slowly creeping upon them, Draco carefully pulled away from Harry to make his way to the couch. He had barely gone a step before Harry caught his wrist to pull him back.
Harry grew visibly more distressed the longer Draco stood without responding. Draco took a perverse, hysterical pleasure in watching Harry’s jaw tighten and his eyes narrow with each passing second. “Say something!” Harry demanded finally. “That’s it? You’re not even going to apologize? You’d rather hang onto your pride than make a meaningful effort to fix this?”
"Let's just go," Harry whispered back. His voice was shaky and his eyes were damp. He tugged lightly on Draco's hand.
“Leaving?” thundered Lucius. “Remember your place, boy! Rebellion has made you arrogant, and it is time you were put in your place. You cannot possibly believe you would be happy here, rubbing shoulders with commoners and groveling to those who are beneath you. I’ve built you an empire, and I will not see you squander it for some naïve, misguided sense of superiority!”
“I was going to pop out and pick something up before you came back, but I ended up sleeping in,” Draco said with the appropriate amount of chagrin.
Draco shook his head. "Not for a few hours," he replied, and immediately Harry jerked him forward, pulling him along such that he had to either match Harry's pace or be left to trip over himself gracelessly in an effort not to go sprawling to the ground.
He took a deep breath and broke the eye contact, dipping his head forward until his forehead rested against Draco's. His fingers had stopped their motions against Draco's arm, drifting up to loosely encircle his wrist instead. Draco brought his right arm around Harry's shoulders, holding him close. He saw that Harry's eyes had drifted shut, and his own followed suit.
As Draco opened his mouth to ask for some time to think about it, his gaze fell upon the neon yellow sticky note from where it had fallen to his desk that morning. He had forgotten to throw it in the bin during either his emotional crisis or his rush to leave the room, and now it glared at him accusingly. All of a sudden, reality crashed down upon him, reminding him how quickly he had moved into this relationship. This combined with the paralyzing knowledge of how serious Harry already was sent tremors ripping through his body, and he sank weakly down on to his bed before his traitorous legs could give way as they were threatening to do. "I think the day after might be best," he said shakily, hoping that Harry wouldn't hear the tremor in his voice.
"I was lucky," Harry breathed against Draco's lips, making him shiver involuntarily. "I survived with a broken arm, two cracked ribs, and some gashes on my legs. My parents, though…" He trailed off. Draco tilted his chin up so he could kiss Harry, trying to pour silent encouragement into the gesture. He noticed that Harry hadn't mentioned the scar on his forehead, and he took the omission to mean that Harry had acquired it elsewhere. He filed the information away absently, deciding to address it some other time.
The carriage doors had long closed behind them when Draco turned to Harry and said, "Let me know how much the rent is; I'll cover it. I wouldn't dream of imposing you for so long without recompense."
As he crunched through the snow, Draco felt his head droop with the weight of the thoughts buzzing through his mind. He had been so certain that he had left his past on the other side of a closing set of train doors, stranded on a platform in London while Draco fled in search of a clean start. He had managed to forget, somehow, that a life such as his was not so easily abandoned, and that the severing of those ties would leave behind a tangled web Draco would be unable to escape.
"Yeah," Potter said absently, fiddling with the hem of his shirt. Draco filed the information away, just as he had been doing during the time they had spent together, despite knowing he likely would have no use for it in future. "I had fun with you," Potter said finally. "In fact, I think I'd like to take you out sometime," Potter said finally.
"You ramble when you get scared, have you noticed that?" Potter replies aggravatingly and Draco hits him again. He dodges as Potter turns to hit back, except there’s a loud squeak from the other’s Muggle shoes and he loses his balance and falls straight off the roof.
satisfactorily visible to everyone present there, and perhaps anyone looking out from the Astronomy tower a good half-mile away, when she goes absolutely crimson and stares at her and Abbott's joined hands like she’s discovered the last
“Are you insane?” He demands when he gets his voice back, wondering how the hell Potter plans to live past nineteen if he's going to constantly pull off stunts like that without any regard for personal safety. “Are you
“Uh, yeah,” Potter says, blinking a bit before looking over. “The Goblet of Fire is binding, so I kinda have to, even if it won’t officially count. But I’m allowed to ask for help from any friends if I want, so-”
"A Death Eater came to my house," Draco sputters out, alarmed, which is true enough to satisfy the quick Legilimency sweep Severus makes. Draco carefully puts his shields back up before he continues, making sure there's no one else in his head before he lies, "Father threw them out immediately, but they mentioned 'letting the Triwizard take care of it before he arrives.'"
“I already checked there,” Potter follows him up and says right into his ear. “There’s nothing to be found.”
“And feel free to never return to that fashionably-challenged building once you see our dorm,” Draco tells her primly and Potter scoffs and rolls his eyes.
"Why would any of them do it though?" Potter says. "You know how many secret passages the school has- who's to say someone hasn't just snuck into the school and is just hiding out in a broom cupboard or something?"
“Plus we- we haven’t finished-” Granger waves a hand morosely at all the books strewn over the table, then slumps back down against Astoria and sniffles, apparently a sad drunk.
“Thanks ever so,” Potter says, looking a bit hurt, and luckily one of the Weasley twins appears in front of them to successfully derail the very confusing anger that’s suddenly risen in Draco and the urge to defend Potter’s handwriting for not being that bad, even though it very much is.
Blaise puts a hand on Draco's forehead, which practically covers his entire face (he has big, slender,
"Did you know about this?" Pansy yells after him, and Greg calls out, "You can't run away from the truth!"
Tariana dodges immediately without even a squawk of surprise, and flies over to Greg, because she is a living creature he transfigured himself and therefore irreversibly a part of Draco's soul and thereby knew he was coming, and Draco crashes into Blaise disastrously, sending them both tumbling to the floor in a flail of limbs and shouts, the nearby bedlamp making the journey with them and breaking over both their heads.
“I’m so sorry!” Blaise says, sounding mortified and panicked for probably the first time since Draco’s known him. He’s shining slightly as he pulls his hands off Granger and Weasley’s shoulders, both of whom are completely blissed out, staring into space with the dopey grins of people under the influence of a happy Veela. "Sorry, sorry, my bad!"
“Oh will you piss off, the lot of you,” Draco snaps crossly as he goes to shove his quills in his bag. He refuses to stay here as long as these idiots are tainting the peacefulness of the place. "Go play Exploding Snap with the murderous creatures of the forest, or whatever is it you do in your free time. At least that way you'll be inflicting your presence on living things at your level of intelligence."
A second hand twists in the front of Draco's robes, and he fleetingly thanks Merlin that everyone is in class and the hallway is empty, before his entire awareness boils down to the person in front of him when Potter growls straight in his face, "I can keep up
"I don't know if you hit your head on your way into bed last night and it was the last straw for even
"As long as I don't, she won't." Draco says and can't hold back a smile when said wonderful creature stands back up and presses her small head against his cheek and makes an
“No, you fell off the roof, is what you did,” Draco says sharply. “And you didn’t cast any spells, you obviously have to check if they’ve charmed any of the rooftiles, you utter cretin.”
Pansy snorts and shoves him playfully. “Not to outsiders, no. They must have taken your murderous staring at face value instead of interpreting it as the hopeless pining that it is.”
Draco sneers silently at him as soon as the others move out of sight and Potter’s grin grows more feral. He wants to knock it off the fucker’s face so badly.
"And how will you show me that, your majesty?" Potter replies sarcastically, hopping along on one foot and casting a
“Thanks for the help,” He says, “It’s almost not bad having you around when you’re not being a prejudiced terror.”
Potter practically crashes into him as soon as they walk into the library, after a truly tiring day of carefully evading questions from the student body. “Where’s Madeleine?”
Granger has managed to break out of the trance by the time he's done and blinks intensely a few times at the table like it holds the secrets of the universe. Next to her, Weasley is still out- Blaise's thrall isn't sexual yet, but it's still a rush of happiness like no other, as anyone who's lost a game of cards to the fucker can attest to, and she frowns at him and clicks her fingers in front of his face a few times before giving up and turning to them.
“How did you find me here?” Draco asks, nonplussed, which is a fair enough question considering he’s completely covered from view by the huge rocky walls on either side, and the only way you could possibly catch sight of him is at a certain angle on the other side of the lake, which happens to also be in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
Potter, fuck you very much, Greg- vaguely implied otherwise, even though he'd made a New Year's resolution to stop with the habit.
“Like ambrosia,” Blaise mutters from across the table, then gasps and starts struggling from under the tangle of Pansy and Vincent, who blink awake sleepily. “Guys. Guys! Ambrosia!”
Because every single curse that has ever befallen the Malfoy line has landed on his shoulders for having the misfortune of being the outcome of a decision to have a single child, Draco ends up with his books in the same shelf as Potter’s.
Granger looks put out, but visibly gathers herself together and raps the table for attention. "Regardless," She says, "The first riddle came in and we need your help to crack it."
he chants to himself as he chases down Finnigan, who is chasing after Thomas, who is chasing after Millicent, who is trying to get into the forbidden section to look for good sets of clothing for the three of them.
There isn’t a sound at the table when he’s finished, tension thick enough to be cut with a knife. He shakes himself. “But Father threw them out afterwards and we never saw them again.”
a small, little stick! Just because you are aiming for a career as one of the stone gargoyles of the castle, doesn't mean-"
AND Im so excited abt the Blaise part because ppl are always much more willing to change for their friends so this is gonna be fun.
Pansy smiles back, the tips of her ears red, pulling at the strand of hair on her face like she always does when she's nervous, and Draco exchanges a thrilled glance with Blaise over her head. Pansy hasn't fancied anyone in
“...Yeah, probably,” Potter says. “Move out, everyone. Keep an eye out for anything that might look like it doesn’t belong on the Viaduct.”
Some of the righteousness wavers and falls off the other's expression at that, but luckily Abbott speaks up at that moment and saves Potter from being kicked off the broom and fed to the mermaids.
"Nothing," Potter says finally, and Draco checks the sky for flying whales or anything that would suggest he’s in an alternate dimension. Potter seems to understand what he's implies immediately even though he hasn’t said a word, and he narrows his eyes and thickens the air with the ozone of his magic in irritation, but only grits out, "Take a bath and rest. We meet at the Gryffindor tower at ten.”
Draco raises an eyebrow, grinning. "Disappointed that you won't be able to murder me, Potter? All of your scheming gone to waste?"
is Potter approaching him and aiming the softest smile at Lucina in his arms, petting her head with a single finger. “Sleep well, Amy. If Malfoy or any of the Slytherins give you trouble, just fly over to our tower, hm?”
, until Weasley comes splashing up to him out of nowhere, dragging Granger and Potter behind him, looking a weird mix of constipated and livid, and demands, “Was there really a Death Eater at your house who said they were trying to kill Harry?”
"I'd rather run naked into the Forbidden Forest," Draco tells him primly. "I'm fine with getting a little wet."
Draco, you heard how they were talking about us at the World Cup. My blood is worse than the worst of the Muggleborns, it's-"
Draco growls, making the third year shrink back satisfyingly even as Vince grabs his hands tightly. "No hexing the babies," He says firmly, ignoring Draco kicking him.
how am I supposed to feel reassured that you're doing a good job taking care of her? What did you feed her?"
out of this whole mess anyway, does anyone think of that?" He continues, a self-deprecating smile on his lips, tears running down his cheeks. "The entire Hufflepuff house hates me.
"Yeah, have some firewhiskey, mate!" Weasley cheers from where he's sitting at the table and transfiguring loose papers into cups more expertly than anyone Draco has ever seen. "Bill let me have some once, and it's the best thing ever, come and drink."
they had, both of them cowering in front of her rage. "I don't want to hear a single peep of your squabbling for the rest of the day, understand?"
"That's not going to bite you in the arse at all," Greg says amusedly, the steady rumble of his puberty-deepened voice throwing Draco back into sleep almost instantly. "Are you feeling better, Theo?"
impossible standards, Malfoy." He frowns, distracted, "Wait a minute, can she fall sick? Or... die?"
"Aw, nice!" Greg cheers, reaching out and tugging at Theo's messy hair cheerfully. "It'll be nice to have you back,
"What?" Pansy frowns, pushing past her to look at where Potter is waving at them, a determined expression on his face, clearly ignoring the looks of horror of the seven or so Gryffindors around him and the admonishments Granger is hissing at him and Weasley shaking his arm wildly. "Draco, what the
"By getting you out of the tournament, obviously, keep up," Draco snaps impatiently, dragging them around a corner. "I know you're slow Potter, mentally and physically, apparently, but I had thought you were capable of basic logic jumps."
"Do you know how overcrowded those rooms are already?" Draco complains, "I don't need more trash in my house, thank you."
be aware of at least some of the things people whisper behind his back, which is why Draco nearly trips over backwards on his robes when Potter suddenly straightens up and starts yelling.
" Draco says, and absolutely nothing proceeds to happen. The thing bites his finger in reproach. "...Throw it away, I guess."
Unfortunately, it's hard to summon up the irritation to punch someone who's laughing like they've heard the funniest joke in the world, so Draco yanks at his hair instead and Potter yelps. But he's still grinning maniacally as he grabs onto Draco's
With that stunning start to the morning, Draco's day predictably goes horribly. He takes out his frustration on his breakfast, hacking it into the smallest pieces he can, not so much as glancing at anyone around him throughout. He gets so caught up in the destruction of his food and his parents' voices telling him not to be barbaric, that he completely forgets to actually eat until it's too late. And then after
Blaise says, so tense that he's one wrong move from spraining something badly. "If Muggles aren't worth shit, then I'm a fucking
“That’s something we will consider when we find hard evidence that it’s not in the Viaduct,” Adelaide says firmly and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. “Even Dumbledore wouldn’t make us swim through sewage.”
“Until we find something better, it’s at least worth checking out,” Potter says, shrugging at her. “Malfoy, get those notes too, it had stuff about famines in it.”
Madame Maxime seems discomfited at her Champion’s beseeching, looking over at the other two for direction and throwing the ball in their court with a raise of the eyebrow.
. Plus, Draco's pretty sure he'll somehow get implicated if he leaves the other here and the idiot drives himself into the Janus Thickey ward, so he says carefully, in case the last bit of sanity holding Potter together snaps and the other turns on him, "Can't you just… tell them you don't want to participate?"
couldn't they tell he was just sucking up to the other side for profit? But he can't say it, or even imply it with a well-timed glance without being caught, so he keeps silent and tries his best to look foreboding.
“What do I have to do to get you to share your firewhiskey with us?” Finnigan asks Millicent as soon as the door shuts.
"What are you doing here?" Finnigan demands when Draco finally succeeds and manages to get the paralyzed idiots he's with to the edge of where Potter has pushed a few tables together and left one side empty for them. The Gryffindors seemingly realize that at that exact moment, all of them looking over to Potter in betrayal, who ignores them so thoroughly Draco is slightly impressed.
"I didn't!" Potter says desperately from behind him, stepping through the doorway to look at the others, "I have no reason to-"
They all shout in pain at the sharp noise and flinch back, holding their heads. Draco gives a disdainful sniff, and throws his robes behind him as he twirls around to leave.
and watches the students file out yawning and stretching, before turning to look at him fiercely. "You're going to apologize for calling Hermione a Mudblood."
"Could be a Carrow," Severus says grimly, and Karkaroff's fingers tighten on his shoulders before letting go.
and eats it as gracefully as his parents do at parties, practiced until perfect. When he’s done, he flicks his eyes up to Pansy, who immediately takes the cue- she’s not the co-head of their little pack for nothing.
Draco hums and she walks off slowly. He looks out, gaze landing on the gilded Owlery tower, visible from where he was standing. As he watches, the doors open and all the owls fly out in a giant mess of white and brown and grey, the whole flock going out to the Forest to hunt their dinner.
, he wants to ask, but he already knows the answer. Draco carefully doesn't look at any expressions on anyone's face, choosing to look at the shelf with the green brains instead.
It feels silly fighting with Potter after that, so Draco clears his throat and says in one of his most amiable tones, "So, I hope I can trust you not to kill Ramona in the hours you have her?"
Draco exchanges a smirk with the other Slytherins, who have temporarily given up on wringing muck out of their clothes to enjoy Salazar’s latest blessing- the glorious, rare opportunity to make fun of Pansy Parkinson.
"Can you describe them?" The Durmstrang headmaster says urgently, placing both hands on Draco's shoulders. He used to be a Death Eater, Draco remembers. "Any memories of them at all?"
Draco sneers at him and reminds himself that his mother would be very disappointed if he defaced a rare Katawixi book with his nails, or threw it at Potter's head and it somehow got corrupted by the other's stupidity. "Oh, shut the fuck up" He snaps, "Or would you rather rope in twenty more people to fill in for the job the eight of us are doing?"
Her eyes go wide. “Fourteen?” she says, distressed, “I have a sister who is fourteen as well. She is not capable of taking part in this at all!” She turns to her headmistress, “Madame, please, he is far too young!”
Unfortunately, any ground-breaking inventions Draco might make in the one minute of pure euphoria he experiences die a sad death as Potter recovers and gives him his best glare- probably in the Top Ten Glares in the country, with how long he spends practicing it on Draco. It would be absolutely terrifying for anyone else, but Draco, who’s been subjected to the horrid expression for four years running and at this point doesn’t think there’s a glare in the world that can faze him anymore, just rolls his eyes and flies along.
“You said that twice,” Blaise gleefully informs him as soon as they step into the hall and Draco places Reginald into his arms to distract him.
Also, yes, I did get carried away with the Theo/Greg subplot. I do not control this story- it controls me.
“Fine,” He grits out. “I’ll take her on Saturdays and every alternate holiday that we have. We’ll discuss vacations afterwards.”
"What?" He thinks he hears from behind him, but he just rolls his eyes and walks off to hide the fact that he was doing it
“Are you going to stand out here cackling like insane people until dark?” A voice says nastily and Draco scowls even before he’s registered whose voice it is. He turns around and Potter is glaring at him fiercely, angry once again about something Draco has achieved by merely existing.
Weasley shrugs. “Yeah, part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. But make no mistake, I’m nothing like these berks here, all snobbish assholes and poorly hidden prejudice.”
Pansy says incredulously, saving Draco the time. He uses it to try and wrangle his thoughts back into working order. Even
Potter blushes a bit. “It was the first thing that came to mind, alright?” He says defensively to the table. “What would
Dumbledore, the House teachers, the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang heads and the three champions all stare at him speechlessly.
"Watch it, dickhead!" He snaps, pulling himself upright and throwing aside the curtain he'd stopped his fall with, then sees who it is and sneers. "Ah, Potter. I suppose it makes sense that it's you, who else in the castle would have such little decorum? And oh look, you've even broken your ugly Muggle footwear."
What many people don't know is that it's only the Malfoy albino hair that makes Draco seem paler than everyone else- Pansy is just as light-skinned, and it's
“Er, yes sir, right away,” A vaguely familiar voice says, but the elf is gone before Draco can place it.
Blaise and Theo grab onto one arm and Daphne and Millicent the other, Astoria, Vince and Greg leaning on her shoulders to weigh her down in case she runs. Draco spins in front of her and gives her a sweet smile before dropping a kiss on her nose.
"With me," Potter says infuriatingly, putting her on his shoulder, dodging Draco's attempts to grab her back.
Potter hears anyway and the quill in his hand bends a little. He exhales loudly and says through gritted teeth, "I
He groans deep in his throat, but as he looks around at everyone else, there seems to be no help for it- he lets go of his broom and reaches out to bodily pry out his piece from the wall. It takes a bit of effort, and he nearly gags at the thought of the centuries-old muck that's gathering under his fingernails as he scrapes it off, but in the end he goes sprawling back as it comes free, and the spell on it dissolves, leaving Draco clutching a beautiful metal plate, embossed nifflers and jewels on one side, writing in Latin on the other.
“They’re also still Creatures,” Pansy practically whispers, face creased with complicated emotions. “You know how some people view them. I didn’t know it mattered so much to him though- the whole not being a Pureblood thing.”
his office, the champions and headmasters are supposed to meet in the first-year's Transfiguration classroom in two minutes."
is that you’re all-” Draco starts to shout back, but his magic abruptly lurches back and fizzles out, taking his voice with it, anger draining away. The word ‘Muggleborns’ had been about to pass his lips, before he almost violently remembered Blaise curled tight in a ball and practically howling to the ceiling that morning, gone half-harpy in distress.
“He lost control earlier,” Pansy murmurs worriedly, and Draco frowns harder, worry creeping up his spine as well. Pansy was right- Blaise
Karkaroff purses his lips and looks at Dumbledore, who sighs. “It’s true, Harry has already been through so much these past few years, and he
No, he decides, he’s not going to fall for it. He’s not going to let Blaise be the downfall of him, no matter how strong their ties.
that it would be faster if I checked the roof on foot rather than fly above it, and possibly miss something. I don't see what the huge issue is- if I fall I can just magic myself back up. I did it when I was a kid once."
," Blaise sobs, and Draco feels guilt burrow into his heart, wanting desperately to go back in time and slap all of their younger selves hard for never noticing. "Every time you- you all talked about Mudbloods, I would- always wonder if you secretly thought that of me-"
Draco looks back at Potter, who's staring at him with a bloodied smile on his lips, eyes sparking with magic and alive with the thrill of the fight. He shrugs carelessly. "We'll reschedule it for another day.”
Except she immediately goes flying to Blaise's bed when he tries to pull her away, and licks and pecks at him until he wakes up, giggling. He pets her fondly, and Draco takes advantage of the distraction to creep closer after her, on the tips of his toes. He gets as close as he dares, aware that the other four boys are staring at him in amusement, the dorm silent with bated anticipation, and Draco takes a silent breath and pounces.
Potter's skin goes darker and he immediately lets go, pulling his hands back like he'd been burned. He slings his bag up higher and glares as they walk off, matching Draco's stride this time. "Are you sure you can get me out of this?"
"I didn't put my name in the Goblet," Potter repeats quietly, looking so miserable that he's either suddenly become the greatest actor and strategist in the country or is telling the truth and has genuinely hated every minute of the past two days.
"We need your help," Potter says as he slides into the seat next to him and Draco nearly breaks the teacup as he slams it down on the wood.
His friend glares at him so ferociously that Draco shrinks back in shame. "No," He snaps. "At least they're human. I'm
"-so, it's settled then," Dumbledore says. "We'll send Harry beforehand to do the tasks, with help from any friends of his choosing as long as they aren't present during the actual event, and keep his scores unofficial."
Draco actually cannot speak for the sheer amount of stupidity being exhibited in front of him right now. Potter's finished half the roof by the time he gets a handle on his speechlessness and flies forward to smack the prat up the head.
is not what Draco would call the next two hours in the slightest. The Gryffindors, to no one’s surprise, are lightweights, and also apparently have never had alcohol before, so Draco is forced to babysit them.
“We need to settle on a name for her,” Draco says primly as he inks in the days of the week, “Don’t want her getting confused on who to respond to.”
His own allies are similarly dumbstruck as he hits at their shoulders to corral them into sitting down, taking his own place in front of Potter at the center.
"Nevertheless, your name was still in the Goblet," Professor McGonagall sighs, although she looks slightly sympathetic. "How else can you explain that?"
There’s a sharp intake of breath from around the table and Draco hesitates. He curls his fingers over the bird-dragon’s little head and his voice drops as he remembers the terrifying chill of the hooded figure’s presence, the pervasive feeling of
Draco snorts as she flies away, mounting his own broom and flying up abruptly so Potter has to swerve to the side to avoid getting knocked out of the sky. He hears a low growl from the heathen behind them and smirks over his shoulder as he casts a Notice-me-not on himself.
Blaise goes still in his arms at that, then suddenly pulls away with a wet, fake laugh. "How angry do you think Pansy would be to hear that you called me the f-word first?" he asks in a completely different tone, an insincere smile on his face.
Draco doesn't think the other is one for crying either, come to think of it. He hasn't seen the other cry even once in over three years.
doesn't end up in the infirmary for 'not listening' if Potter gives into the bout of hysterical anger he's currently experiencing and decides to hex him.
“Alright, I’m done,” Abbott is declaring when Draco trudges back with the three idiots and a hastily
Of course, Potter immediately jumps straight from his broom onto it, so recklessly that Draco’s heart actually skips a beat, a shout of alarm dying in his throat.
Astoria smacks him, and it's a testament to Greg's good genes and heavy build that he doesn't crumple like old parchment at the rough treatment, considering the fact that she's built like a brick house.
Draco clicks his tongue in irritation, turning them around and pulling Potter along again. "You couldn't just
“Right, yes,” Granger says, picking up the scroll he’d spent the last twenty minutes working on and firing three drying charms quickly. She goes to give it back, then glances at it and frowns. “Wait, how-” She flicks it open and scans the length of it, “That doesn’t make sense- how would adding owl feathers help? Professor Snape said you had to use badger claws.”
Draco can't possibly mask the sheer, unadulterated horror that passes through him at that statement and he stares at them, paralyzed. Potter snorts next to him, then steps forward and fervently says, "Thank you, thank you so much," And promptly drags a scandalized Draco away from the bemused crowd.
“Honestly, as much as I think it would be grand fun to see you two get into a fistfight again,” Weasley says from the corner he and Potter are staring at them with wide eyes from, “I really don’t want to get eaten by the Squid today.”
The Gryffindors bristle at the passive aggressiveness, but Potter only blinks and says, "Oh, right."
“Now do you believe us?” Granger snaps. “I looked up past events- this stupid Tournament is not a joke! Did you know-”
, it’s just something that's common sense. If we keep breeding with Muggles, the pure magic that we've inherited, that doesn't
, and he was not going to let anyone hurt him just because he was born a Creature. Even if it was Draco and the other Slytherins doing the hurting.
“I’m not,” Draco snaps, even though he is. “I just don’t think that if we’re going to hate each other, it should be over something I no longer believe in.”
"You're just saying that because you've never been kicked in the balls," Vince grunts, already half asleep again- he always was terrible with hangovers. Then he frowns after a moment, cracking open an eye to look at Draco, "Is that okay for me to say?"
"Hogwarts has a system in place that utilizes the water from the lake, passes it through the cleaning spells set up at the centre of the school and sends it back into the river," Granger lectures while Draco stares at the thundering cascade of water pouring out from gaps between the bridge's pillars. Now that he's here in the daylight, it's a much more intimidating task than he'd thought it would be, and it's also a wonder the whole Viaduct hasn't come crashing down already with the force of the flow. "It's an extremely innovative mashup of Muggle powerplants and magic,
"If it turns out that she hasn't been joking this whole time and is actually conducting social experiments on us, I'm turning her into a clock and throwing her in the cursed rooms of Malfoy Manor," Millicent calls out as she jogs up to them, bottles clinking in her bag as she moves.
“Yes, I know,” she says, linking their arms together as they pass a few Hufflepuffs on their way back from Hogsmeade. “That’s not what worries me.”
"-We thought you'd be able to decipher what language it was and save us a bit of time," Potter barrels on, squinting at the board, "What's after 'ruin'?"
wonderful, confident, charming Blaise think that Draco thought less of him because he was part-Veela.
"He's saying he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire," Draco continues when no one says anything.
Potter rolls his eyes, "Obviously not. But we have no idea what the riddle they've given us means and we need your help."
"I know what dyscalculia is," Pansy says curtly, staring down at Abbott, knuckling white around her broom.
“And it is in no way possible for us to get it today,” He says loudly over the roaring water, “So let’s all take a nice trip down to the kitchens, get some sobriety potion, eat something, and fuck off to bed.”
"Damn," Blaise says when he's done, "Didn't think about it being a prank honestly, but I guess it makes sense- hey, wait, where do you think you're going?"
“Hannah, you fucking genius,” Potter says, tottering alarmingly before grabbing onto Abott’s sleeve. Draco stops Vanishing the bottles to run over and grab them before they both overbalance and shoves them both down onto a beanbag, before running off to grab Greg from the windowsill as he tries to ‘fly with the sheer power of free will’. “You solved it!”
"I thought dinosaurs were much bigger though," Hermione frowns. "Although I can't say I read that much about them."
"Easy enough, mate," Vince says unhappily, looking miserable in his bright yellow Muggle raincoat. "I don't think there's a soul alive who'd want to be caught dead in this thing."
“Then what-” They both pause as Professor Flitwick passes by, stopping to assure him that they’d head to bed soon, after this quick walk, no, they wouldn’t do anything at all sir, good night.
Pansy steps into rhythm with him and he slows his walk purposefully so they can talk out of hearing range of the others cooing over the dinosaur, who’s basking in the attention with dignified joy, like a true Slytherin creation.
and mutters in a voice even he can hear sounds petulant. “It’s not hard to notice Potter what with his stupidity as big as his bottomless ego and as pervasive as his fucking magic.”
"Yup!" Professor Sprout says, just as cheerfully. "You would have done very well in Hufflepuff, I think."
“UNBELIEVABLE!” Draco rages once he’s raced down and caught Potter seconds before he hit the water. “Forget Voldemort, your own stupidity is going to be the death of you- move out of the way!” He snarls at the disillusioned person above them- probably Longbottom, considering there’s a lack of any reply in any form. “
“They’re speaking in unison,” Potter mock-whispers to the other, eyes sparkling with mischief, “It’s too late. We’re all doomed.”
"I'm just saying, you could have found them speaking in Irish hot!" Astoria protests, though at a much lower volume than before.
” Draco pants as he catches up to them at the Viaduct five minutes later, the whole lot of them staring morosely down at the dark thundering water that churns loudly far below them, looking quite terrifying in the evening dark. “How the fuck did you all move so fast?”
"Lovegood is good at observation," Abbott says. "And the other three are splendid gossips, which should help."
"May I have your attention please," Dumbledore calls out and Draco has never liked him more. He doesn't bother listening to what the old nutter has to say, taking advantage of everyone looking away and scarfing his food down as quickly as he can.
There's silence for a few moments, and Draco stops casting to glance over, frowning at Potter's glazed over look. There's a haunted expression on his face, like he's remembering something that's not very nice.
fingers that have been the topic of discussion amongst them all more than once) and frowns. "Maybe we should book an appointment at St. Mungo's. We can sneak out after the third period."
The Viaduct is part of the old castle, untouched by any renovations. It’s a long bridge, cream and grey, the grit of the wall peeling off in places. Draco grimaces as he looks at it, covered in slime and moss and muck, almost definitely not given a good wash since it was built. There are balconies jutting out every few meters for people to sit down and stare at the hills and forest at, vines hanging down around them. He hears Granger yelling out to someone to go check the benches and forgoes that idea, instead flying up and checking the roof of the Viaduct, red-brown and slippery.
“Oh, Godric, he’s dying,” Astoria says in tones of complete horror, and Blaise pats her on the arm and nods with all the grimness and sorrow of someone whose friend has been sentenced to the guillotine.
“Like I don't know you and your friends bought them all out to spite me. And I assure you, if I’m executed, it will be through the guillotine and nothing else,” Draco replies. “I don’t have so much French royal blood in my veins for anything otherwise. But we’re getting off-topic. Eat more, so I’m not wrestling someone with the physical capabilities of a ten-year old next week in the alcove on the fifth floor at midnight, and would you rather have Josiah Saturdays or Sundays?”
"Castings before it gets stuck?" Potter asks interestedly, and he nods before he can think better of it. "Aw, it's so cute. What are you gonna do with it?"
Draco clicks his tongue, familiar annoyance creeping back up now that Potter is no longer crying, along with the barest hint of relief, because he never knows what he should be doing when someone cries. "It's not what you're saying, it's how you're framing it. You have to use
And yeah, I think fourth year draco and the rest of the slytherins wouldnt have capitulated to not being assholes for anything less than realizing their friend was hurting because of their actions. I hope its angsty enough to seem good while being legit. And no, what made Blaise turn away had been him being special because he was in draco's inner circle, rather than it being an overall thing, but he mostly forgives draco for trying later on, if that was unclear.
He reaches into his bag and pulls out an old, yellow scrap of paper, sliding it to the middle of the table. "This is the first riddle of the Triwizard tournament," Harry Potter says. "And I need everyone's help to solve it."
“Well, this surprisingly didn’t end in bloodshed,” Thomas says cheerfully. “Same place at six tomorrow?”
Pansy groans, but nods, and they all laugh in satisfaction as they let go of her, Draco leaning in for another mocking kiss on her cheek and tweaks her hair playfully.
Draco surprises them both by laughing, amused, cutting off almost immediately, staring at Potter in mutual horror.
Draco wakes up to the sound of Nott shouting and practically falls out of his bed as he tries to wrestle open the curtains around it in blind panic.
"To manipulate teachers?" Potter demands, looking disgusted, and Draco's carefully crafted persona immediately shatters, like it always does when Potter starts up with his righteous bullshit.
“UNLIKELY ROMANCE?” shouts the front page, and seated at the Gryffindor and Slytherin tables respectively, Harry and Draco exchange grins over breakfast.
Harry’s mouth didn’t relent, sucking on the hard nub until it was reddened and shiny with spit before flicking his tongue over it in swift, teasing strokes that had Draco keening and yanking on his hair again. Over and over those teeth scraped at his nipple, leaving it delightfully sore and perversely throbbing for more of the same treatment. And Harry obliged, loudly sucking on it until Draco’s spine bent inwards and he unravelled completely.
, you tit!” Draco groaned, trembling as the hot, damp skin of his back was plastered against the cold stone of the wall where his shirt rode up.
Potter, the enormous prat, had choked back tears again and Draco had been quick to take the mickey simply because it helped staunch Draco’s own horrifying rush of some more of those

They spend the Christmas break apart, Potter at Weasley’s and Draco at the Manor, writing each other every day, and the evening they return to Hogwarts after New Year’s, they make love for the first time.
This time there was no over the top reaction; Harry sat there with his face in his hands, his glasses fogging up as he breathed, for what
His mind feels wiped blank as Draco sits there, completely stunned and still teetering on disbelief. Next to him, he can feel Potter’s careless impatience, his sheepishness, and a hint of anxiety as Draco’s peripheral vision detects him turning to stare at Draco.
Muggle money, Malfoy?” Seamus asks curiously as Draco squeezes his way between us both to pick up his drink that he’d abandoned on the bar in favour of accepting the random challenge a stranger had thrown at him.
Draco’s hands go a bit cold. “No,” he says shortly. “But yours is,” he adds, nodding at him. “We could practice against your Boggart.”
“Did he know about the Veela thing?” Potter grunts suddenly and Draco just stares at him for a beat.
He’s half-hard as he watches Potter now, both of them lounging on the sofa in nothing but their boxers, with Draco’s bare, swollen feet in Potter’s lap. Potter distractedly reaches down to squeeze Draco’s feet every few minutes, engrossed in
Malfoy straightens up, smiling softly at her and taking the hand she reaches out with. “Next month,” he says quietly.
him, staring with that same unabashed, heated intensity that had overwhelmed Draco the night at the club (which in turn means that Draco is nearly always hard in Potter’s presence); but it also means that when Potter is
After Potter leaves, Draco stands just stands there, his insides still surging with a rather hysterical swarm of butterflies, Potter’s expression of calm surety as he’d kissed his hand still bright in Draco’s mind.
“I need to sink down there to get my mouth on his bits, darling,” she replies calmly, her many rings glinting in the strobe lights as she lifts her martini to her glossy siren-red mouth and sips delicately.
pay for a watch that likely cost you half your vault!” Draco rants forcefully, his napkin caught in one tightly clenched fist.
I think back to a few weeks ago when my days had been spent in a blur of wanting him with every aching fibre of my being, of feeling his absence like a gaping hole somewhere inside me. And now I have him, and I love him more than ever, and I’m making an utter idiot of myself because I can’t stop thinking about
me with your overabundance of selfless virtuosity, Potter. I was as much a willing participant that night as you were.”
“Er.” Ron yanks his scarf out from under a cushion. “It’s past eleven, mate. I’m old. I need to go to bed.”
When the water finally turns cold again and his erection stays stubbornly in place, Draco steps out with a sigh, drying his hair with a charm and towelling himself down haphazardly before donning the terry bathrobe hung on the back of the door. Then he brushes his teeth and works some hair serum into his barely damp hair, all the while imagining various scenarios in which Harry declares he’s too fat to fuck and goes to sleep in the guest room.
Harry blinks awake from the light doze he’d fallen into. He pushes his nose into the little nook under Draco’s ear, pressing around the curve of his back as he says, “I told you, let’s just go up to bed.”
A faint line appears between Potter’s thick eyebrows and his mouth tightens a touch. “Why?” he asks quietly.
?” Malfoy instantly shoots back, narrowing his eyes at the cluster of loudly cackling women in the middle of the enormous, oval field.
“My great-great-grandfather, Septimus Malfoy,” Draco fiddles with his gloves, “he cursed the whole bloodline – our bloodline. His son, his first son, was rumoured, still is rumoured actually, to be one of the most beautiful Veela in existence. On his seventeenth birthday, during the celebrations, the boy was drugged, lured into an empty chamber and raped...after which he was killed, likely in a fit of panic.”
Harry swallowed, licking his lips and sitting up straight. “We... We went to look for her but...” Harry floundered for sophisticated ways to put it but in the end just said, “But she was gone.”
Finally sinking back down, his back hitting the mattress with a soft thump, Draco sobs helplessly, vision blurred to the point where Harry’s nothing more than a blurry shape against the light flooding in from the hallway, his grip on Harry tightening until Harry is pressed up against him, one foot on the floor to leverage his continued, brutish thrusts into Draco, his mouth now moving urgently along Draco’s neck.
“We tried, Potter,” he says kindly. “Calling that attempt a complete fucking disaster would be doing it a kindness. Now how ‘bout another pint, eh?”
Then Harry is laughing too, despite the shock still evident in his gaze. Dropping his broom, he steps forward to press a firm kiss to Draco’s mouth. “I bet mine’s bigger,” he says, grinning rakishly, before drawing his wand, and nearly yelling, “
“So,” he says loudly, chest puffing out, smugness emanating off of him in waves. “You tried to contact us
“I’m sorry,” he slurs, stifling a whimper as that familiar pressure from within pushes against the barricades he automatically puts up. With a Herculean effort, he wrenches his eyes open, seeing nothing but a colourless blur. “Are you okay?” he rasps. “M-Malfoy? Shit—oh god—” Panic rising all over again, Harry frantically gropes the taut swell of Malfoy’s stomach that his hand is latched around.
Sure enough: “Just when I think you can’t sink any lower, Pans, you prove me wrong,” he says, lip curled, expression one of raw repulsion and not a little resentment.
“Malfoy, I got worried,” Harry says, taking half a step towards him. “I just—I told you I want to be... I want to stay in touch, right? I just...got worried,” he repeats, staring desperately at Malfoy whose striking features are stained blotchy red with anger. “I’m sorry I forced my way in, alright? I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.”
Lifting his delightfully sore arse off Harry’s sticky cock, Draco flings himself into the crook of Harry’s arm which then automatically curls around his waist. Cleaning Charms are murmured, Draco’s lip is Healed and the lights are spelled off, so that in the shadowy darkness of their room, the half-moon playing shameless voyeur, it’s just them, Draco and Harry, entwined mind and body.
Malfoy nearly shuts the door in his face but ends up slamming it into Harry’s booted foot instead. “
At least I managed to stuff my cock back inside, Harry thought morosely, turning his head to once again look at and ensure that the furred half-man half-wolf lying a few feet away was properly dead. Harry had got him with a Severing Curse to the neck just as he’d taken an enormous bite out of Harry’s shoulder.
I simply frown at Draco’s small, round ear and start a rough mental countdown for how long I believe this idiocy will last.
Potter stares warily at Draco, then at the vial, and then with a careless shrug, plucks out the little cork, and downs the mouthful of potion with only a slight shudder.
“WRAP THIS UP, HARRY!” Weasley bellowed from next to Granger. He was on his feet, like a majority of the students were, and was bouncing up and down with pent up tension. “COME
I watch the three drunkenly swaying women cross the street, holding onto one another as they giggle shrilly, their ankles twisting dangerously as they fight to maintain balance on their ridiculous six-inch heels. They clamber into a taxi and I watch it trundle away.
“Thanks,” Malfoy mumbles, getting up and abruptly looking over at Harry, face clear of any resentment or hostility for the first time since he walked in. “See you around, Potter.”
Shock mingles with slight confusion, his eyes wide and questioning, and the second our eyes meet, he smiles a small, completely bemused smile that I then realise is meant to be
For all the patience and uncertainty I’ve held on to since I got together with Draco, I find that I am no longer in the frame of mind to wait.
Harry was back to staring at Malfoy now, not even bothering to be discreet about it. He didn’t know if he’d been waiting for someone to
Malfoy simply blinks once, slow and tired, before leaning his head back against the wall, sighing through his nose.
going to sit around wringing my hands and gazing at you in the hope that it’ll happen again.” He didn’t look at Harry as he spoke.
, Malfoy,” she snipes and Draco glares at her. “You think if it were a choice, everyone who’s ever bitten wouldn’t choose it? The Alpha gene is innate; Harry was born an Alpha and was one even without the lycanthropy.”
There’s something off about it – the way Potter’s smile is slightly strained at the corners of his mouth, or the way his hands are balled into fists, the casual avoidance of eye contact – and Draco wouldn’t have noticed it had he not spent the past week rather desperately familiarising himself with All Things Potter.
, and how it’s probably only Harry’s innate kindness that’s preventing him from saying anything to Draco about it.
He’s wearing blue jeans, slightly frayed at the hems and slipping down a little at his hips, like he’s lost weight since buying them, and a faded yellow t-shirt, both garments bearing dark splotches of what looks like grease, and when Potter turns to shut the door behind them, Draco sees a large, slightly rusted spanner sticking out of the back pocket of his denims, along with a carelessly bunched up, grease stained rag that’s almost spilling out completely.
! Potter, there, don’t stop, keep--” he groans helplessly into one arm, “—keep going, Potter!” he manages in a high wheeze.
Draco grabs two empty wine glasses and flounces away with a muttered oath and Ron takes the chance to send Hermione a Patronus before turning to glare at me pointedly, wordlessly promising me that there’s no way I’m getting away with this – not without a detailed explanation.
as Harry calmly resumed brushing his teeth, green eyes twinkling with mirth, irritating Draco even more.
I’m definitely as red as Ron now, I can feel it. But I just crack my neck and straighten up in my seat determinedly. “Not that I can think of,” I say. “My—my past partners have never...y’know...” I clear my throat and shift in my seat. “I’ve never faced any complaints in the past. But, well, I have no way of knowing if they were just being polite, of course.”
visit Potter. Draco knows that his feelings for Potter have transcended from hopeless fancying to a fondness that’s inexplicably and inexorably solidifying into something far more real and significant and
“She’s two, it’ll be a few years before she calms down,” Draco replies blandly, setting aside the empty bottle and picking her up to hand over. “Let’s just get her dressed. Mother can do her hair when we get there. We have just enough time to get our robes on and get going,
Malfoy looked around too, but it was with a sort of impassive familiarity rather than the quiet wonder that the children’s faces bore as they walked around.
I swipe my face sideways, breaking the kiss, and sit up to roughly pluck off my shoes and socks, pulling off my trousers along with them and chucking them aside without looking. I’m looking at nothing but Draco who has risen up onto his elbows to watch me finish undressing. When I take off my boxers with no particular finesse or ceremony, his gaze flashes down to my cock, rigid and swollen, beads of precome at the tip, and he licks his lips before simply laying back down and looking at me.
He’d shot out of bed and had raced through his morning ablutions with the soppiest fucking grin on his face and the desire to kiss his idiot boyfriend throbbing through him. But by the time he’d gone up to the Great Hall, the Gryffindor team had already left for their warm-ups.
accent,” Draco comments. “It always does something for me, that seductive little rolling of your ‘r’s that you people carry off with such flair.”
Weak, breathy moans sound as Harry marks Malfoy’s throat some more, sinking his teeth in and viciously sucking blood up until his skin stands out in mottled red and purple. Malfoy gasps, arching high, pressing his chest into Harry’s mouth as he sucks on tight, pebbled pink nipples, pulling the reddened tip in between his teeth and flicking his tongue over the throbbing nubs until Malfoy is sobbing with each helpless jerk of his body.
“He is being leaving by the living room Floo,” Kreacher tells him, jabbing a skeletal arm at the ceiling. “He is being gone.”
Wordlessly, Draco kneels and starts unlacing Harry’s heavy, dirty boots; there are splotches off blood on them as well and Draco presses his lips tightly together, trying not to acknowledge the queasiness rising in him. Throwing the boots under the coffee table, he peels the stained, sweaty socks off, briefly squeezing Harry’s large, square feet with both hands before he feels one sturdy, grimy hand gentle over his hair.
, Granger!” Malfoy grits out, shutting his eyes as though to block out her words, his whole body trembling. “I don’t have to tell you
Potter doesn’t talk again for a bit, flipping the page again and smoothing a hand softly over the next photograph – his parents, clearly just wed, standing and beaming at the camera alongside Sirius Black, Remus Lupin – bright-eyed, far less burdened in appearance – and – Draco realises with an unpleasant start – Peter Pettigrew. He’s
Hermione shuts her file, looking more than a little sorry for him. “I... I told you, Harry, male pregnancies aren’t unheard of among wizards. Plus, it’s possible that the wolf in you played a role here.”
He bobs his head over Potter’s cock with a systematic continuity, focusing every last shred of his need, of his own arousal, into keeping his lips sealed in a firm vacuum around the spit-slicked shaft, and sucking as hard as he possibly can, his movements energetic enough that his hair spills out of its knot and down his back and over his shoulders, tickling Harry’s thighs and groin and irritating Draco enough to make him swat impatiently at the strands, but not enough to make him pull off Potter’s cock. He keeps at it, sucking and licking at that slit, tasting the bitter-salty precome, one hand wrapped firmly around the shaft, stroking up and down each time he moves his mouth up to the head.
“No, you’re right,” she says. “He couldn’t have. Luckily enough, he had me to give us you. And darling,” she leans forward, expression kind, “I was out of shape for over a year after I had you. And despite all my self-consciousness, your father was lovely about it.”
“Right now, I don’t know if you mean sexually or wolf-wise,” Malfoy replies blandly, scratching idly at his thigh.
, drying her hands on her little apron, and starts collecting the sheets of wrapping paper Scorpius flung about the living room as he’d unwrapped presents.
“Yes,” Harry answers dully; he’s not wearing his glasses and Hermione is a very blurred, bushy-headed shape floating in front of him.
Granger gets up and pours him a goblet of water again. “Harry doesn’t go through the transformations during the full moon,” she says calmly, sitting back down and placing the goblet before Draco. “
Harry snorts and this time he kisses Draco’s mouth, slowly parting his lips with his own and sliding their tongues together. Draco clutches at him, pouring himself into the kiss until there’s nothing left to give, yielding completely within the circle of Harry’s arms.
“Sometimes they go less fine,” Potter quips amusedly, taking another few sips of coffee. “What do you do now, then? Are you working?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes again, his hands warm in Harry’s hair. “Are we to arrive separately?” he asks cheekily. “Are we to greet each other like colleagues and nothing else – shake hands once maybe?”
“Are you going to pretend that you and Harry have never had intercourse?” Narcissa deadpans. “Because your daughter is right there.”
Harry shrugs. “I’ve been meaning to write them anyway, but then I figured I’ll just drop by,” he says casually, bouncing a fist over the back of the sofa. “And so after they told me that you’d left for the day, I went and spoke to the Minister – and that other bloke, the coordinator for department heads.”
Harry was silent, his arms tightly wound around Draco’s trembling form. “Malfoy.” A little confused by the sudden reversion to his family name, Draco leaned back to peer into the bespectacled face that shone seriously at him. “We’re not going to lose this.” Harry paused. “Ever.” Draco licked his lips slowly, shutting his eyes against the glare of the fierce promise in that declaration. “Draco...” Harry kissed his name onto his forehead.
“What the hell happened to you?” Harry asked, regretting it instantly when Malfoy’s lips twisted as he finally looked down at his soaked self.
“Once we board that ship – if we were to decide to—” Harry murmurs against Malfoy’s flushed cheek, “there’s no getting off for me, Malfoy, not ever.”
“That’s it,” Potter murmurs quietly, shakily. “Suck it, Malfoy, suck it hard, you tosser. Fuck, you’re good at this. You do this often, you piece of shit? Are you just really a cock-hungry whore beneath that snooty, holier-than-thou exterior?” Pulling out until only the glans rests on Draco’s tongue, Potter snaps his hips forward, driving down Draco’s throat so hard that he’s gagging and tearing his nails down Potter’s flanks.
Draco scowls, but hands the dinosaur over, and the traitor jumps into Potter’s arms immediately. Although, Potter
“Can you stop fighting for a moment?” Astoria calls out, louder than usual. “Did you find anything?”
“Well, when you have an idea, do inform us,” Her sister says as she runs past them, on her second round of the entire fucking castle, because Astoria is an insane person.
