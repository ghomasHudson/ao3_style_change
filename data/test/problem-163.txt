Within no time, a memo flew into the office. Draco raised an eyebrow as it flew past him but otherwise didn’t acknowledge it.
Draco looked, flabbergasted, at the envelope, “But it’s in France this year!” He laughed, and Ginny shrugged her shoulders playfully.
Draco, Pansy and Blaise stepped inside the club, preparing to get it ready for the night. The plush red leather booths were empty, awaiting the throngs of drunk wizards that would grace them; the vast mahogany dancefloor was polished to the highest shine possible, and the poles surrounding it were ready for their dancers to occupy them. To Draco, the club before the lights were dimmed looked strange - the red and blue lights really made the atmosphere and without it it was stark.
He heard Harry’s characteristic heavy but quick footsteps and jumped away from Potters desk, focusing instead on the evidence board.
“Ah,” Harry said, “That would rankle slightly.”
“Well, like you’ve said,” she smiled at both Harry and Draco, “you’ve had a rough couple of years. It’s a joint present really – you both deserve to go!”
Harry, shocked that Malfoy was being almost civil, nodded. The intoxicating blonde dancer came to the end of his set, and Harry found his eyes lingering on him. There was something about him that made Harry hot under the collar, maybe it was the smirk with which he held himself, or the blatant sensuality that he performed with. Harry cleared his throat, he realised that he’d been staring, and moved to sit in an empty booth.
“Erm, mainly around London, and a smattering of places further North.” Malfoy replied. He leaned on the edge of his desk and wrapped his hands around his coffee.
Harry smirked to himself, and carried on filling in the forms and things in front of him, “Thank you, Malfoy.” he smiled, his voice light and sarcastic. He could feel rather than see Malfoy glaring at him.
” Harry said playfully, “Why can’t you make the effort? You are my
Draco and Harry continue their investigations, will going further North provide a breakthrough?
Harry burst out laughing, “No!” he chuckled, “I was doing some exercise, actually. I told you it was all muscle.” He winked and held the door open for Draco to come in. He saw that the settee was still in the bedroom, and so hovered near the fire place instead. Harry leant on the side of the desk.

“Honestly,” Hannah beamed, and placed a hand on her stomach, “We want you to be Godfather.”
nothing had happened; no-one had caught his eye (other than the barman) but he was enjoying his time nonetheless. All of a sudden the music changed, and while he and Ron had become even closer over the past few years, this song was just a little bit
“These are the three unforgivables, they were deemed so in 1717 and ever since then they have been termed thus,” he waved his wand at the board and they wrote themselves down, “The use of these, while legal for a few periods of time in history, will get you landed in Azkaban,” he said, “However, it is important that you know them; because even now, there are still wizards and witches who perform dark magic. On the bright side, one of these curses can be resisted. Does anyone know what it is?”
That light fluttering feeling in his chest went south and Harry pulled his head away to look Malfoy dead in the face. There was Draco, eyes half-lidded, with that characteristic smirk and ruffled hair. He looked Harry up and down, his eyes lingering on his lips for just a moment too long to be meaningless.
What happened after the the chance encounter?
Harry cried out, his language almost as obscene as Draco in this moment. He sat up and wrapped his arms around Draco, holding him close as he matched Dracos pace with his own thrusts. Harry thought that perhaps this position was far too intimate for a first time with a former enemy, but he was way past caring. This felt too good.
Harry choked slightly, it was the first time that Draco had said it. He sat staring at the cup, holding it tightly in his hands for a moment or two. He felt a surge of happiness; Draco had known that he was teaching this lesson today - his least favourite lesson – and so he probably wanted to make Harry feel better. With a gulp and a thudding heart, Harry touched his wand to the cup,
Harry sat nursing a drink in the corner of the Knockin’ Kneazle. It was a busy Friday night; the whole club was absolutely packed with people - a regular occurrence because it was the hottest wizarding spot in this part of London. He wasn’t particularly interested in any of the dancers - male or female - until an intoxicating song began playing. It was powerful, strong, and gave a rush of confidence to Harry. The rhythmic melody lulled him into a cautious and subtle trance, one that made him feel like he was worthy of the world. A blonde dancer strutted out and grasped the pole lightly, swaying his hips and flexing his muscles for the patrons. Harry watched, transfixed, from the corner as the blonde seemed to hypnotise the audience. He was vaguely aware of Blaise and Pansy sat at the bar to his right, and he assumed that they were watching him watch the dancer as he felt their gaze attack his neck.
Ron rolled his eyes at her playfully and she threw a roll of wrapping paper at him with a smile, “Wrap your mums present and then make a start on the dining room.”
“Is that where you learned to be such a useless, annoying part, then Potter? Being with all those Ravenclaws?” Malfoy asked, a smirk playing on his lips. Harry wasn’t in the mood; he’d had too much to drink and he wanted to go home. He was tired and worn out, and didn’t want to be reminded of the past - it was far too difficult for him to think about, even these years later.
Harry sat behind his desk again, and wrote a quick memo to Hermione asking her to swing by. The paper memo flew off with a flourish, and Malfoy glared at Harry from across the room. A knock at the door startled Malfoy. It was Auror Anderson and he was holding a letter.
“Potter.” A voice cut through his daydreaming. A cold voice, a voice from the past that Harry had thought he would never encounter again. He turned on his heels, suddenly on edge.
Draco watched Harry as his arms flailed in a mad protest of the referee, and realised that he was head over heels with Harry. It was the way he felt things so passionately, even about people he was totally unfamiliar with, and how he was completely unable to hide it. Harry's emotions rule him, but he always paid attention to his rational thoughts (when he had them) and by merlin he could rule the world if he set his mind to it; yet he was happy to just carry on with his job in the Aurors department, helping people like he always had done. He cast his eyes down to Harry's body, and couldn't help the thoughts that came forward. Images of Harry spread eagled across Draco's bed clouded his mind, and he couldn't, or rather, didn't want to think of anything else. It was in this moment that he realised he'd never been attracted to anyone else, truly, as much as he was to Harry Potter; it could overwhelm him, the sight of Harry in any state of undress. He very much believed that a naked Potter could ask him to do anything and he would oblige for just a taste. To say that he was completely beholden to his worship of Potters body was an understatement, even now, at this small local quidditch match, his mouth was watering and his groin was beginning to react. His mind instantly went to their possible list of post-date activities and he had to refrain from calling the date short then and there to take it to his bedroom. He wondered if it would always be like this: if he would always get distracted by the sheer beauty that radiated from him, whether he was still mussed from sleeping, or in his finest attire. He wanted to find out. He wanted to see Harry grow old and experience every iteration of him possible. His breath caught as he realised he was getting in over his head, but he loved every second.
Harry smiled to himself, this was possibly the longest he had heard Malfoy speak directly to him before without cursing or hexing him in some way, “Yes,” he replied, “It is quite strange isn’t it?”
“Obviously, Master.” He frowned, and looked around at the mess that Harry was making.
Draco nodded to himself, “Oh, and I don’t have a girlfriend - who would want to be in a relationship with a Death Eater?”
The next question, “How did you kill you-know-who if you haven’t used a killing curse?”
wine for the evening. They were beyond content, and no doubt they would spend the evening in their cosy living room, under blankets and getting happily tipsy.
They stood, once more in the hallway, and they looked at the Healer in anticipation.
“Which one is that, sir?” A Gryffindor student called Charles looked sheepishly at him.
Harry stood still, and smiled to himself - he always got questions like these when he taught this class, “Yes, I have. I’ve cast two of them as well,” he added, “though there is one that even I won’t touch.” he explained.
charmed the piano, and was now playing himself.
“You just need to give it some time.” Her heard Hermione say quietly before he sat back down.
Harry read it, his eyes growing wider with every sentence read, and eventually he turned to look his two friends. Everyone watched him with anticipation. Arthur, Ron and George leaned forwards on the settee, waiting to hear what it was.
They sat and spoke at length about how Harry was doing, Hermione gave the odd glance at Draco as if she couldn’t believe that he’d gone out of his way to help him. Harry had been doing so much better, though it seemed that Draco wouldn’t let anyone see just how confused and lost he was. He really needed someone other than Harry to talk to about these things, especially as it was Harry’s actions that had sent him into a spiral that he didn’t fully understand.
“Draco,” Harry said, and took a sip of his tea, “That potion is incredible. I haven’t slept that well in such a long time.” Harry looked so grateful and Draco felt a lump rising in his throat. He had not expected to be so emotional over this, but apparently he was.
Nancy nodded, “I’ve known you long enough to know that. What’s made you
“It’s a complicated concoction of a powerful sleeping draught, a potion for dreamless sleep, and a draught of peace. I tried it on myself and I had a good night’s sleep. I modified it so that the effects last for about eight hours. I made it in the hopes that you could have a decent sleep, you know, without nightmares and such. I’ve called it the Essence of Tranquillity.” Draco explained.
to get up?” Draco mumbled, his voice still croaky with sleep.
“It should help with the nightmares. It’s quite a powerful potion – I formulated it myself.”
They left the classroom in darkness, hand in hand and giggling at what had just happened. Draco and Harry bickered about what they should cook when they got home – Harry knew that he would inevitably end up doing most of the cooking while Draco mused over the
Leave some love, I appreciate it as always xx
anything when she kissed me.” Harry explained, “I didn’t feel
,” Harry groaned.
The students filed out, one by one, and Draco looked around the room. They had been brewing Wiggenweld Potion, in preparation for their next class, and the classroom was quite a mess. Draco turned to his desk at the front of the room and made notes on his students' potions, his back to the door. Without warning, the classroom began to clean, despite no incantation being uttered. Draco whirled around, looking for whoever had done that.
I totally forgot, but I created a playlist to go with this fic! Check it out here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7zwSW4S80YP35idD1R5Xjg?si=-ViVX7moTbqLyf-7dODJIQ
Draco kept quiet, shaking his head and rolling his eyes in response. Just as he had planned, Harry had slowed down, however he had lost sight of the snitch. He cursed himself, and flew higher searching for the snitch once more.
Hermione talked to Kreacher. With a start, she looked under the tree and exclaimed, “Oh! Kreacher,” she cried, “I got you a present!”
“We do have wands you know, Potter?” He waved his wand and the books put themselves away, even the ones that had been in Harry’s hands.
Harry held out his hand and they walked back into the living room. Nobody said anything about Draco’s sudden disappearance, and instead they looked to Harry.
Draco put a hand on Harry's back, and Harry noticed that he’d put his sleeves down, “It’s alright. I didn’t think that through properly,” he got up off the bed and filled a goblet with water with a flick of his wand and gave it to Harry, “Here. Are you alright?” he asked.
The door opened slightly and Neville’s head popped around it. With a sly smile and dangerous eyes, Draco let go of Harry’s hair and began to move his hips again – slowly and teasingly. Harry turned to look at Draco over his shoulder and smiled an amused smile back at him. Neville took a step into the room, and cast his eyes over to the door to Harry’s office. Harry worried briefly that Neville might come over, but Draco ended his ability to think clearly with a few skilled thrusts. Harry cried aloud as Draco hit just the right spot and stroked him in such a way that he knew would make him come closer and closer to finishing all over the desk. Harry bit down hard on his hand and Draco laughed quietly and smugly to himself, he really did love seeing Harry lose himself.
“Did you use the protean charm that I did with the DA coins?” she looked proud of Harry and also a little emotional.
“Thank you, Neville, I think I am. Did you hear about Draco?” he asked.
They went through the courtyard, down into the corridor and then to a part of the castle that Draco had never seen before. Draco looked at Harry questioningly.
Malfoy took a deep breath, “It’s actually not as bad as I remember it being,” he smiled, “there’s a sense of nostalgia being in Snape’s old classroom again, though now of course I’m teaching. I imagine you have something of a similar experience being in Lupin’s old room?”
They conduct an interview, and Malfoy heads on his date...
She stood up in her seat, her voice quivering slightly, “You need to want to use them,” she said, “You have to have a desire to be bad.” she sat back down and Harry nodded.
Harry smiled widely, the widest that Draco had ever seen him smile, and pulled him into a tight embrace. Draco gasped slightly at being pulled so close to a shirtless Harry, but held him just as tight as he was being held.
The room sat in silence for a moment, and then Harry stood up from his desk and sighed deeply, his students looked at him wide eyed, “There are some things that need to be taught that are distressing, and that are incredibly dangerous,” Harry started, “but, you need to know them.”
“Shall we just chase the snitch around?” Harry said when Draco met him, a grin on his face.
“Firewhiskey, please.”
Draco smiled, “Hung over?”
She turned to look at Draco, “Are you sure you’re alright?”
“It would be good to see you there, Harry.” He heard Neville say.
Harry sighed as he thought. He too missed Draco when he wasn’t around; he had become pleasant company. Those few days when Draco had been avoiding him were very bleak: he had no one to be around. He’d tried to talk to Neville but it wasn’t the same, and Ron and Hermione were constantly busy. Harry thought of the banter they’d had before – was that flirting? Harry shook his head: he’s not gay, and he doesn’t flirt with Draco.
“You really need to teach me some cleaning spells, Hermione.” He smiled as he admired her handiwork further.
They threw the doors open and stepped over the threshold of the Hall, and nothing catastrophic happened. Draco walked half a step in front of Harry, like a bodyguard ready to clear a path, but so far his caution was not needed. As they entered the Hall more, a hush fell over the crowded room. Harry had not been seen in the Hall since the welcome feast. Students looked, fell silent and smiles began to break out across their faces. Potter looked at Draco, and Draco too was smiling. Their footsteps echoed through the room as they walked, both growing more confident with each step. It would seem that when they were together, nobody judged Draco or hounded Harry - perhaps the hatred for Malfoy and the love for Potter meant that people kept their distance from them both. When they reached the teachers table and were about to take their seats, Neville turned to Potter and embraced him warmly, a tear threatening to spill from his eye. With this, the hall erupted into cheers and slowly returned to the throng of activity as people ate, talked, and laughed.
Draco vents, and the club is full.
Draco broke the moment, sure now that his limbs would respond if he told them to, “How does a pot of tea and a cigarette before bed sound?” His voice was quiet, hoarse; heavy with the implication that Harry may stay the night.
Draco heard Potter moving around in the other room and moved swiftly away from the bookcase, thinking that he wouldn’t appreciate him snooping around. He lifted the big kettle over the fire and pulled the tea set out. Draco smiled to himself; these teacups had been used a lot recently. Harry came into the office, still in his pyjamas.
Harry stood up, and greeted Ron and Neville with an embrace, clapping them both loudly on their backs as he did. Ron looked a little worse for wear, and Neville seemed to be well on his way to being drunk. Ron grinned widely at Harry and took a seat in the booth. Harry had to guide Neville into a seat, and even then, Neville couldn’t quite balance on his own, he leaned onto Harry’s shoulder for stability and Ron laughed.
Harry loved Sundays in the castle. It felt like the crack of dawn until about lunchtime, and it was perhaps the only time that the big old building lost some of its infectious buzz. It was barely 9am and so the corridors were empty – not even Peeves was out yet. Harry ate his apple as he walked through the winding corridors to Draco’s room, a delightful spring in his step.
Hey Hey.... regrettably we are nearing the end of our journey together :( It's been a hoot and a half, and as I've mentioned before I do have another Drarry fic on the back burner that I'll hopefully finish xD
If you're following the playlist for this fic, the song I chose for this chapter is Gymnopedie No. 3 by Satie <3
Ron and George sat at the table washing and peeling potatoes, bickering as they did about who was the best quidditch player and why. The potatoes landed into a big pot with a thunk when they were done. Arthur stood drinking tea and occasionally checking the turkey, marvelling at how good everything smelled. Molly, Hermione and Neville prepared a mountain of assorted vegetables, with Neville talking about the hidden magic in everyday root veg, and Hannah was in charge of drinks; when Harry came in she shot him a teasing glare and moaned at how bad his taste was. Ginny sat wrapping a last-minute present at the table, out of view of everyone. The radio on the shelf played Christmas music and every now and again someone would chime in singing. Harry just stood in the door and grinned – he loved his chaotic family.
Malfoy opted not for the settee, but for an armchair that was tucked away in a corner under a window. Harry went for the settee and turned, with his feet on the seat, to see Malfoy properly. A kettle boiled over the fire.
Nearly every hand rose into the air. Harry chuckled to himself. He pointed to the first student and smiled.
Draco smiled, “Back to mine?”
All Harry could do was hang his head, slightly embarrassed that their little bubble wasn’t entirely private. He went to the cloakroom, and as he got there, Draco was leaving with his coat in hand. They said nothing, but walked out into the now cool air of London. Harry followed Draco to the apparition point, still in silence, heart still beating faster than ever before.
Harry went up the stairs to his office, past the wall where portraits of Gilderoy Lockhart once hung, and held the door open for Malfoy.
He busied himself, making sure that he had everything ready for the beginning of term – he planned what he wanted to teach, made sure that all of the equipment he would need was in working order. The wardrobe with a boggart in it creaked in the corner, Harry shot it a glance with a smile on his face, remembering how Professor Lupins classes had made him feel. He spent the day like this, getting ready for the year, settling back in, and remembering his own time as a student here.
“Really?” He asked, “You’re not pulling my leg?” he stood up in an instant, sending bits of paper scattering across the room.
The room fell quiet as Draco stopped talking, his voice hoarse from letting everything go all at once. Harry took some deep breaths, he wanted to be there for Draco but he also had things going on in his head that he was still coming to terms with. His conversation with Hermione earlier was still playing on his mind – he had yet to talk to Draco about that. Harry processed the things he had been told and it boiled down to this: Draco had missed him, and he’d been having butterflies in his stomach whenever Harry was around - he’d been using the draught of peace to stop it. When Draco saw him on his date, he grew so sad and angry that he disapparated to his shop in Diagon Alley.
Draco kissed him again, groaning as Harry moved his hips, eliciting filthy thoughts from Draco. Harry took his hands off Draco’s and pulled his jumper off, throwing it in the general direction of the floor. Draco took advantage of having his hands free and began to undo Harry’s shirt buttons, as quickly as he was able to. When Harry was free of his cotton confines, Draco held him firmly around the bare waist and flipped him onto the bed. He was growing incredibly frustrated.
Draco’s grey eyes turned hard, his jaw clenched and he wrung his hands in front of him, “I guess.”
Another look went around the students and it was a while before anyone else spoke, “There’s the Imperius curse.” one student called. Harry nodded.
“Not at all,” Draco sidled up to Harry, wrapped his arm around Harry’s and for the first time Harry caught a glimpse of what Draco had put on - a deep navy silk robe, loosely tied around his waist. It complimented his eyes and his snowy hair perfectly.
Sunday came and Harry woke up early. He’d had yet another peaceful night’s sleep thanks to Draco’s Essence of Tranquillity. He really relished the well-rested feeling that he had in a morning now, and was grateful for having a friend in Draco. The settee was still at the end of his bed, he had been too lazy to move it back to his office. He glanced at it and remembered a drunk Draco smiling at Harry as he decided to sleep there. He laid awake in bed, blankets pulled up to his chest, reading a copy of the Daily Prophet. There was little of interest in the papers these days but it made for something to do on a Sunday morning. Harry considered Draco’s comments from the night before and relived them.
“Well… Draco,” Harry sighed, “I have to say, that was probably one of the best first dates I've ever been on,”
“It’s beautiful,” he mused, “The pattern is so delicate,” he looked at the teacup closer, “I’m sure I recognise the maker.” He said quietly.
“That’s highly admirable, Draco.” Harry put the vial back into the box and leaned back onto the desk.
kind of night, Potter.” His smile widened as Neville put the tray on the table and conjured a bean bag of sorts.
The only thing that Harry noticed about the room was the huge bed that almost filled it. Other than that, he was focused on one thing entirely.
“Where did you get all of these?” Harry asked, shocked at the pictures he saw – there were pictures of him and the Weasleys laughing in the gardens at the Burrow; Harry playing Quidditch – his scarlet robes flying behind him; Harry and Ron at the Quidditch world cup when they were younger; being best man at Ron and Hermione’s wedding. Everything that he could ever have wanted to see all over again, was there. He even noticed that Draco had put some of his old photographs in there – there was one of the original Order, and the second Order; as well as some of his parents.
“How are you so small and yet
Harry finished the painting on the door and smiled at his handiwork – it wasn’t too bad. He cast a drying spell over it and went inside. His hands were red from the cold so he held them over the fire.
“You wish… Potter.” Draco called in response, calling his name in a mock snarl like he used to when they were younger. It made Harry chuckle.
Harry nodded at her, and was going to say something but she disapparated before he could. He sat up on his settee, covering himself with the blanket, and tried to calm his thoughts. He wiped the sweat from his face and neck and unclenched his hands. He examined his palms in the dying light of his fire and saw that his fists had been balled up so tight that he had cut his palms.
Draco stood, in just his boxers, at the end of the bed. He looked down at his case and fell quiet. Harry knew that something was wrong so he went over and wrapped his arms around Draco’s slender waist.
Harry smiled, he was clearly proud of Draco. He didn’t say anything, but Draco could tell that Harry was happy. He looked up at Draco, his green eyes almost wet with tears and siled such a genuine smile.
When Ursula eventually scuttled off without looking at Harry, McGonagall ushered him into her office.  Harry stood awkwardly in front of her desk, like he was 15 again.
The elf stopped outside the classroom door, and disapparated. Draco could hear Potter screaming from here. No wonder there had been students out of bed, he thought to himself, as he cast a charm around the room keeping in the sound so the students could sleep, and to save Harry further embarrassment. He walked quickly up to Potters room, and cast a further charm to keep the noise in. He did not want Potter to feel ashamed in the morning, and if he could help with that, he would.
Neville and Potter seemed to be lost in conversation now, talking about their timetables and their classes. Draco looked out over the students. He could see students of his hastily finishing homework, taking care not to spill pumpkin juice over it; he could see young couples passing notes to each other; people reading the Daily Prophet in groups, talking about their world; others were reading books and drinking tea peacefully. The Hall was clad in tapestries and flags of each of the houses, casting red, blue, green and yellow dashes all across the room. Draco watched the Slytherin table out of curiosity and noticed that it was far more relaxed than when he had been student here. If he looked closer still he could see that there were even a few Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs sat at the table with their friends. This made him smile, maybe the villainous stereotype of Slytherins had finally calmed down. His eyes glanced at the other tables and saw too, that there were students of all houses sat on each one. A warm feeling crept through him because of this. Neville asked Potter to pay a visit to the Three Broomsticks later on. Draco began to listen deeper at this point, but tried to not intrude on their conversation.
Draco had asked his elf to keep an eye on Potter because he was worried about him. Without hesitation, and without knowing what was happening, he found a Bezoar from his potions kit, not knowing what had occurred but thinking that a possible antidote could come in handy. Draco quickly grabbed his thick green cloak and followed the small elf, wishing that it was possible to apparate inside the school. He had to stop to tell a few students to go back to bed, and he grew more and more concerned as he approached the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom.
Fuck.
Harry changed his clothes, pulled on his shoes and went downstairs. Kreacher greeted him in the Hallway.
“It’s not even that warm, Draco.” Harry smiled at him, amused by the predictability of his friend.
“I never asked,” Potter started, “What made you want to be kind to me? When we first saw each other again you were your usual cold self. Now you’re not.”
Draco dropped, ever so elegantly, to his knees, sliding off the sofa with a devilish smirk. It would be the death of him, Harry was sure. Those big grey eyes looked up at him, pale in comparison to the blush creeping over his slender face.
It was just before the feast, and Harry was sat marking homework at the desk after class for he was sure that their house was too relaxed to get any work done, when Draco sauntered into his classroom after making sure it was empty; he had an unusually confident energy to him and Harry had certainly noticed. Harry’s breath hitched when he saw what Draco was wearing – he looked positively divine. He wore all black; his shirt was a fine silk and it shone as he moved, and he wore tight trousers that left little to Harry’s imagination. His hair, like usual, was loose and slightly curly, though it had started to fall into his eyes. Harry gulped, not sure if he could take Draco walking around the castle like that for everyone to see. Draco walked up to Harry and stared fiercely at him. He took two fingers and placed them under Harry’s chin, lifting him up from the chair.
“Mmm,” Draco grunted, “They’re really not telling me anything though. It’s weird.” He put his wand down and crossed his arms.
Lastly, Draco pulled up his last two presents. One of them was a Chudley Cannons jersey from Ron. Both Draco and George sniggered when he opened it, and Draco flashed Ron a grin.
“I’m not really one to venture out anymore, Malfoy.” He said tentatively. He didn’t want to offend Malfoy, especially as he was being kind to Harry.
Harry nodded and looked at Ron, “Well, I didn’t think it was that bad.” He shrugged. Everyone – bar Draco – had seen the house in much worse condition during the Order days.
Draco cleared his throat, he was not used to being the recipient of such an intimate reaction from a friend, “Take a vial before you go to bed, and you should sleep soundly.”
“Haven’t you experienced all three, sir?” she blurted. She sat back in her chair in shock and whipped her hand over her mouth after she spoke – clearly, she had not intended to speak so surely.
Draco looked up, “Why?” he asked, his icy eyes burning fiercely. There was an edge to Draco’s voice that lead Harry to believe that Draco was, in fact, jealous; whether he wanted to admit it or not.
Students milled around the castle, lounging comfortably on benches, or playing gobstones on the floor. A group of fourth years poured over a
“Mione, what do
He was jealous when someone kissed Harry.
Harry had asked him to his office for tea and cake, but he had declined. He had something else in mind.
Neville laughed, “Yeah, she’s fine. She was still in bed when I left,” he smirked, “we’re trying for a baby.” He added quietly.
“I was going to say Hermione, yes… She’s in the Ministry so we may as well just send her a memo and ask her to come and take a look.” Harry sighed, and Draco folded his arms, appearing to mull it all over.
He took out his wand and waved it at the board. It flipped to show the ‘Unforgivable Curses’ written neatly on it. The buzz promptly disappeared. These students were just about old enough to remember the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, and it had clearly had an effect on them. Their parents had been involved in taking sides, or had fought bravely with Harry to protect the wizarding world. He felt a certain responsibility for them that surpassed his responsibilities as a teacher.
Molly raised her glass and chimed in with a loud ‘Merry Christmas’, everyone else followed. There was a clink of glasses before Harry sat down again. Everyone was silent as they ate, the scraping of knives and forks, refilling of wine glasses, the occasional comment on the food, and the cheerful Christmas radio music were the only sounds to be heard.
“Malfoy,” He greeted, intending for his voice to be as hard and cold has his adversary’s, but not at all matching the level of arrogance that Malfoy could summon, “I imagine that you are the new Potions master?” He stopped trying to sound cold, any unsavoury feelings towards Malfoy had been forgotten years ago – after all these years Harry had simply let it go. As he looked at Malfoy he was stunned by his appearance. He was, very much the same, only older. Flecks of grey hinted at the edges of his snowy hair, and he was dressed very smartly in all black. He was wrapped in a very expensive looking cape, fastened with a silver snake that has charmed to look real. Harry was actually impressed with the way Malfoy held himself.
Harry hadn’t even thought that he would not want ‘Malfoy’ hanging around him. It tended to have negative connotations these days, “Of course, sorry… Draco.”
Morning all (Yes I know its night time but I work nights... sue me), I'm hoping to post a chapter a day(ish) until its all up - it's already written and edited etc, so it shouldn't be too long until it's completed <3
For now though, feel free to hit me up on Tumblr: graduallyfindingpeace <3
Draco matched Harry’s smile, remembering how long it had been since he’d played, “Absolutely,” he enunciated, “Shall we say that we’ll meet on the pitch at one?”
Draco looked from Harry to the key, then to the door of the maisonette they were stood in front of, then back to Harry, “Are you asking me to move in with you?” he said in disbelief.
He glanced over at the table and Harry was talking to Hermione. Her hand was on his and he was hanging his head. He looked upset. Draco grew concerned, he wanted to see if he could help but he was unsure of how to. How could he help Harry with his problems when he couldn’t even figure out his own? He cursed himself for making a mess of everything.
Draco got up from the bed and walked, naked, to the burner. Harry admired the view as Draco put the small kettle on the top and warmed his hands. His pale skin looked warm and appealing in the orange glow of the candles and fire from the burner. Harry pulled himself off the bed and sighed: they would have to go out into the world for the rest of the afternoon. Draco stretched, and turned to smile at Harry, putting his arm around his shoulders in the process. He pulled Harry closer, and held him for a moment.
Harry understood, it couldn’t have been easy for Malfoy – a former Death Eater – to go out without facing some kind of abuse. It wasn’t easy for Harry either, he would often get surrounded by people with good intentions but over powering actions.
Malfoy checked the time: it was just after seven in the evening. He groaned and ran his hand across his eyes and then through his hair.
They found the room with ease, there were some comfy looking armchairs in front of a huge stone fireplace which took up most of the room. It was stiflingly warm in here compared to being outside. Harry found the heat calming, it would eventually lull him.
When that was done and the bedroom was packed away, he took his parcel of books downstairs and slotted them into the bookshelf. He felt really satisfied to be out of a little room and into something that was homelier. He remembered what he had left in his trunk and ran back upstairs.
“I got your invite from Kreacher,” he said, “What time were you thinking?”
They went through to the living room and Hermione sighed, she rolled her eyes slightly at Harry. She waved her wand around the room and within an instant it was cleaner and fresher than it had been moments before. Harry stood agape at how she was able to do that.
They clapped each other on the back, and headed back towards the castle. Draco still had butterflies in his stomach and he still couldn’t, for the life of him, figure out why.
“Not really, I’ve a few letters to post and I need to check the potions store but other than that I’ve nothing to do. Why?” Draco answered.
Harry’s heart broke seeing Draco look so dejected. He looked through Draco’s case and sure enough there was the usual assortment of shirts, ties, and suits. He smiled, and took a Chudley Cannons t-shirt and a jumper from the chest of drawers. He gave them to Draco and a smile began to creep up onto his face.
They worked hard on the living room. Hermione put the Christmas tree up, making it bigger until it fit the high ceilings properly. Harry and Ron stood staring at the tree wondrously – it was a beautiful, rich Norwegian spruce. They started placing decorations around it, taking care to not break some of the expensive glass baubles that Hermione brought. Hermione levitated an angel to the top of the tree and took a step back, precisely directing Harry and Ron in their decorating efforts.
Alexandre glanced longingly at Harry, and then slumped off towards the backstage door. Harry frowned at Draco, with frustration growing inside him. The glare that Draco directed at Alexandre, however, was intimidating enough that Harry thought twice about calling him out on his behaviour. He restrained himself from firing a scathing comment his way - Alexandre was supposed to be working, and Draco was good friends with the owner. Harry convinced himself to not look into it, he was probably just trying to make sure that Blaise’s employees didn’t cross the line.
He was starting to get nervous however, Hermione was taking a long time to give any feedback. She came up to him, and pulled the skirt up to his waist, “Always wear it on your waist, Harry… it looks far better…” she tucked his shirt in, pulling at it slightly so the gentle fabric still draped over his body, “just relax,” she said, and as he did she smiled, “there you go… don’t let the outfit wear you,” she sighed and then nodded toward the mirror.
Hermione was perched on the edge of her and Rons bed, one leg crossed over the other surveying Harry's choice of outfit with the kind of sincerity that he hadn’t got from Ron. As usual, he was wearing all black, but he’d recently learned the art of layering. And androgyny. He thought he’d rather cleverly paired his leather jacket with an
Draco looked out across the long tables that spanned the length of the hall, and could understand why it would be off putting for Harry - even he found it unnerving sometimes. It could often be like you were on stage. Draco nodded at Neville and let his thoughts wonder as he ate.
Draco laughed darkly into Harry’s neck, withdrew his fingers and lined himself up with Harry’s entrance, “I know I’m sexy but there’s no need to call me God, Harry.”
Stay safe, as always xx
The Christmas holidays had come and gone. Draco had stayed at Grimmauld place with Harry for the rest of the break and they now returned to Hogwarts together. Harry smiled at Draco as they walked up to the castle again. No matter where Harry lived, Hogwarts was always home, and to be here with Draco by his side was almost overwhelming.
They had barely landed at Draco’s flat before they were all over each other again, only now, Harry was more confident. This, he could do. This, he had done a million times before. He pushed Draco back until he fell onto the sofa, and lunged at him with a practiced hunger, a need that drove him, compelled him to take over.
“Esmerelda,” Draco said quietly, “My house elf.”
“Ronald, why can’t you make an effort?” Hermione sighed as she helped Ron with his tie.
Harry, while he was enjoying having everybody in his home, grew restless. He wanted Draco here to experience this. He checked the time: It was 7pm. There was a final knock at the door and Harry’s heart leapt.
Harry ran a hand through his wild hair as best he could, then noticed that his quill had been dripping ink all over a student’s essay. He looked around to make sure that nobody had seen him in a world of his own, then cleaned it off with a wave of his wand. He cleared his throat then carried on marking the work.
Evening all!
Draco ran his finger along the inlaid filigree and watched the candles reflect in the high shine of the wood. He opened the box, and took out the red teacup. He raised his eyebrows and held the cup up, really looking at it.
Harry took a deep breath and sipped his coffee. He strolled over to the board and stood next to Malfoy; closer than perhaps they were comfortable with but not really caring.
Something goes wrong for Harry
He sat on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands and a heavy chest. He had always thought that his nightmares would end when Voldemort had been defeated, but instead it just served to give him more material. The small body of Keracher appeared in front of him, head bowed as he met his master.
“I appreciate your concern, I’ve just been catching up on work and things, really, I’m alright.” Potter smiled, and took off on his broom.
Harry and Draco walked back to the castle, energised by their night out. Draco had his arm around Harry, supporting the drunk wizard as he walked back to the castle.
Phew... I should finally go back to work tomorrow after being off for a while. Hopefully that will mean an update every day again - can't wait to get this all up after writing it for so long! <3
Draco folded the letter in and envelope and sighed – he had nothing to lose by asking for Grangers help.
Draco looked at him curiously, “What didn’t go well?” He asked, “The date?” his voice had a hint of hope in it. Draco put a small cast iron kettle on the top of his burner and warmed his hands as he crouched by it.
After he got dressed, he walked through his curtain-clad archway and into his office. He picked up an apple, and with an unusual amount of gusto, left to head to Draco’s office.
The elf bowed, put the curtains on the bed, and left again. Within just a few minutes, Harry had the green curtains set up on Draco’s side of the bed. He chuckled to himself, wondering if it was a touch too gaudy for Draco’s taste.
Draco's voice hit deep into Harry. He had never heard, or imagined, Malfoy speaking to someone in such a way. It was like something snapped inside Harry, and he mirrored Draco’s actions. They found a rhythm, or maybe Harry found Draco’s, but it was good. So good.
Ron gestured toward his tie, “I am making an effort…” he grinned, and put his arms around Hermione's waist, “besides… who do I need to look good for?”
Draco relaxes, and the duo carry on with their interviews.
Harry smiled, “You know what I mean,” He glanced at the door, “Do you… er, do you want a pot of tea?”
Harry sighed, “I’m sorry about that, I didn’t really want anyone knowing. I didn’t even tell Ron and Hermione.” He felt guilty about that but there was nothing he could do now - it was in the past.
“Yeah, the potion thing. That was good of him, it’s quite good to see you two getting on.” Neville dried some glasses and put them away. Harry thought it was odd seeing him work here when he was so used to seeing him in the greenhouses or milling around the grounds.
He went with a feint. He darted in the opposite direction to where the snitch was and Harry followed. He flew slower, hoping to slow Harry down too.
He strolled through the halls of Hogwarts towards the path to Hogsmeade – he was in no rush this evening. The sun had started to set, and the sight of a vivid orange, pink and purple sky cast intense shadows over the stone walls of Hogwarts. He wanted to watch this splendour in all of its glory, unencumbered by the glass of a window. Draco quickened his pace until he was outside. When he finally reached the grass he stood still, staring at the sky and the sheer beauty that he could treasure now that he had no darkness in his life. A lone bird darted across his field of vision, swooping low over the orange horizon, then soaring as high as it dared to. Draco watched its dance and smiled. The way that it dove and glided reminded him of a nimble broomsman using the thermals to quicken their pace. He took a deep breath of the cold, fresh air and let his body relax – he let his shoulders fall, and for just a second let his posture slip from its English stiffness. He looked down to the lake, and marvelled at the refection of the sky of the gentle water. Hogwarts grounds really were beautiful in the evening.
“Yes,
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Harry said quietly, “Why are you suddenly at Hogwarts?”
“But?” she encouraged him.
The feast was mostly done, students and teachers alike had started to turn in for the night. As Harry and Draco turned to leave, Headmistress McGonagall turned to them with that reproving look that she used to cast down at Harry when he was a student. Her arms crossed over her chest and she had a slight smirk.
As they came to get used to being sat alone, Malfoys eyes lit up and a satisfied smile erupted onto his face, “Glasses!” he shouted, and gestured with his hands as if he’d found the answer to a complex equation or tricky piece of spell theory.
Harry looked at himself. If anyone had ever told him when he was a teenager that toward his late twenties he would finally find a style that made him feel powerful, he would never have believed them, but here he was. Avant-garde and androgynous, and far more experimental than he would ever have thought.
, ogling some famous wizard or something. Draco smiled, Hogwarts definitely had a different energy now that there was never a serious threat hanging over it. He reached the corridor that the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom was on, and tried to pluck up some courage from his Slytherin heart. He had no idea why he was so nervous – perhaps it was because he had never really given anyone such a personal present before. As he reached Harry’s classroom door, the Hufflepuff quidditch team marched down the corridor, clearly late for quidditch practice. Draco laughed to himself, resenting how long it had been since he had played his favourite pastime.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, his head still resting in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco smiled wickedly and dropped to his knees, his eyes level with Harry’s crotch. His eyes twinkled with mischief, he brought a hand up to Harry’s entrance and pressed gently, not once breaking eye contact. Harry, at this point, knew what he was in for, and moved his hand towards his cock. Within a split second, Draco raised an eyebrow and stopped him from doing so with his strong, slender hand. Harry whimpered as he felt the delightful press of a lubricated finger at his entrance. He had to control himself, stop himself from baring down onto Draco’s finger then and there. Draco applied more pressure and Harry hissed, trying hard to control himself.
“Pans, I don’t fancy Harry Potter,” he stroked her leg absentmindedly, “We work together and he’s being annoying.”
Draco looked at everyone, stunned. He soon saw that George, Ron and Ginny all had their characteristic Weasley jumpers on and he felt a wave of belonging wash over him. He slipped Harry’s dressing gown off, and pulled the soft woollen jumper over his head. It fit him perfectly. Everyone cheered, and Neville clapped him on the back. He stood up and walked over to Molly, dodging discarded paper and unwrapped presents.
Everybody took their turns to open their presents, and it was soon Draco’s turn.
She put down the sweeping brush that she had been holding, and stood nearer to Draco with one hand on the counter and the other on her hip, “What’s on your mind?”
“So,” Neville began cautiously, “I know we weren’t usually on the same side and things,” Draco looked at Neville curiously, wondering what he was about to say, “but there really is no hard feelings. You know that we - Hanah and I - really have put everything behind us?” Nevilles voice was soft, and so non-confrontational, as always.
At the mention of Harry's name the class seemed to electrify, a Slytherin student called Bernie raised her hand, “Have you ever brewed one, sir?”
“Lay down,” Draco whispered, nuzzling into Harry's neck and kissing him oh-so-gently. Harry did as he was told.
Harry’s office was quite large, it had been Professor Lupins office when he taught here and it held fond memories for Harry. There was a small bedroom to one side that served him well during the week, and he quite quickly settled back in.
Draco nodded, happy that he would get to spar with Harry. He had not played against him in years and he remembered how much he used to enjoy having him as his opponent.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry answered, in just quidditch trousers, and with a flushed face.
“You’re only saying that because you’re a Gryffindor,” he smiled, and spoke gently, “To a Slytherin, this is home.”
Draco smiled, and held Harry tighter. They hadn’t ever really said that they loved each other, but they knew. Draco chuckled under his breath, “It’s been the most authentically happy Christmas I’ve ever experienced, I think.” He remarked. Hermione flashed him a sympathetic look.
“Thank you, Kreacher, I’ll answer him myself – you’ve got better things to do.” Harry smiled. The elf bowed and disapparated.
“Draco…” Harry said, so quietly that Malfoy could barely hear him, “you didn’t have to do that.” He put the vial back in the box carefully.
Harry nodded, it seemed like Malfoy had done quite well for himself. It made Harry happy to hear that Malfoy was no longer under anybody’s thumb, but it also made him highly aware of his own stagnating life. He had been teaching at Hogwarts for ten years now, he had never done anything else, and he was beginning to long for a fuller life again – friends, family, pets, excitement. He almost came to regret secluding himself from the world. Mayhap there could be a life out there for him yet.
He only looked up when Malfoy cleared his throat, “Well well well, Potter…” he said, and Harry looked at him expecting a vicious comment, “this is the first time I’ve seen you out of your regulation Aurors robes,” he smirked and paused for a moment, as if he was weighing up whether or not to continue, his eyes dragged their way appreciatively over Harry, “I see that your fashion sense isn’t as dire as it used to be.” He gestured to Harry’s sharp suit and nodded in approval.
Draco smiled a little, “In my previous experience, that usually means it’s going well.”
Harry sighed and looked at his watch, “It’s getting late,” He groaned, “Want to call it a day?” A glance out of the window into the bullpen showed that nearly everyone had gone home already. Malfoy followed Harry's gaze out towards the maze of desks and sighed.
Draco wound his long fingers into Harry’s dark hair and tugged slightly, he leaned in close to his ear, “how badly do you want me, Potter?” he asked with a smile, and carried on stretching Harry out as he did.
Harry's head fell slack, and after a moment, he couldn’t take any more. He tightened his grip on Draco's hair and looked down to him. He simply nodded.
Draco sees Harry after the Gringotts Ball... What'll happen here?
Howdy! It's my day off, hence why this is uploaded at a reasonable time - I hope you're all having a wonderful day, and are carrying on staying safe in the wake of rising Covid numbers <3
“Do you keep in touch with Weasley and Granger?” Malfoy asked, dragging Harry out of his depressing reverie.
Greetings earthlings!
Harry eyed him suspiciously, “What
The grounds were slowly starting to look more and more autumnal. Trees had started to turn golden, leaves were beginning to flit to the floor, and the air was turning colder. The warm colours stood out against the cold blue sky as Draco looked up to observe a bird, darting to and fro above him. He took a deep breath, and appreciated his momentary freedom. He turned to look behind him and marvelled at the sight of the castle, standing steadfast and stubborn on the horizon and felt suddenly emotional. How on earth did Potter have the courage to save all of this when he was just 17? Draco deeply admired Potters strength the more he thought about the severity and the complexity of the challenge that Harry had faced. He wondered what he would have done if he had been issued such a monumental task at such a young age - he was so fragile back then, so immature and very impressionable. But he also lacked courage, something that had probably saved him after Voldemort died. Had he had more courage he may have gone ahead with actually killing someone, something that made Draco shudder under his heavy cloak. He looked back at the floor, trying to clear those thoughts from his mind.
Harry shook his head and motioned for Malfoy to come in.
“Yeah, though there wasn’t much need to sneak around the castle after….” Harry sighed, “Well, after everything.” He shot a glance at Draco who nodded glumly into his glass. Draco hadn’t been there for their eighth year, he had instead chosen to go to a different school, away from everything. It often annoyed Harry that Malfoy hadn’t been there to see the castle repaired through the collective effort that he had led.
Harry nodded, “I was just telling Hermione something. I’ll tell you all about it later, if you fancy having tea in my room tonight?”
One look at Draco and his flushed cheeks as he recounted a particularly riveting part of the match, and Harry knew that Draco was just as electrified as Harry by their day together.
They carried on stumbling like this, bickering and laughing all the way back to Hogwarts with Harry being mostly supported by Draco. As they neared the entrance, Draco looked up to the time – it was 2am. They tread quietly through the halls, silently praying they wouldn’t run into any students while they were in this state. Harry laughed to himself – he’d not snuck into the castle for quite some time, let alone for a fun reason.
Harry nearly spat out his juice, “I don’t know what you mean, Neville.” He tried to maintain an air of innocence but he couldn’t stop grinning. Neville had definitely picked up on their atmosphere, and was loving making sure that they knew that.
“Never mind.”
“Potter,” she sighed, “Do you know why you’re here?”
Harry woke up terrified. Again. He’d been at the Burrow with an army of death eaters swarming around him and his family – the Weasleys. He could hear Mrs Weasley crying so vividly in his mind, and he hated the sound. He wanted to hold her, tell her that everything was okay now – he was here to help. He noticed something holding him. Something was trying to soothe him. He mustered up the courage to open his eyes and was confronted with a dark mark in his face. He stood up in a flash, his wand automatically at the ready in front of him, ready to fight - as always.
A healer turned to look at her with pity in his eyes, “let's go into another room and I'll explain all to you, I promise.” Ron and Hermione glanced at the healers working away, grateful for their hard work, and followed the healer through the door.
Harry sucked air in through his teeth and looked around the classroom. His students were on edge, leaning forwards in their seats and desperate to know, “Now that,” he said, “is a long story. Would you like me to tell it, and then get back to teaching you about these?” he asked.
“Erm, no. He couldn’t make it.” Harry replied. Kreacher came through with tea on a tray and then shuffled around the house lighting fires and cleaning the odd thing.
Malfoy nodded, “I’m hardly surprised,” he looked at Harry, “You went through a lot doing what you did.”
Malfoy stood up, and ran a hand through his snowy hair, “I was wondering if you would like to go to Hogsmeade for a drink?” He spoke slowly. It felt to Harry like he was making a point to be an adult – extending an olive branch almost.
“I wanted to make sure that you were okay,” Draco said sheepishly, “You worried me a bit.” He looked at the floor, not really comfortable with sharing his feelings so openly.
Harry rummaged for a pair of trousers long enough for Draco, but couldn’t really find any. He continued to look when he heard a snigger from Draco. He turned to look and saw him holding up the jumper – it was one of Harry’s Gryffindor ones.
If he wasn’t listening to the Weasley family and his friends, what chance would Draco have? “Can you just tell him that he’s welcome in the Three Broomsticks, please? It’s not good for him to hide away.”
“Okay,” he said, trying to seem happier than he was, “I’ll see you soon.” he smiled and pulled Harry in for a kiss, trying desperately not to get carried away while they were in the corridor. Draco left, and Harry stood there alone, already missing him.
He let the water cascade over him for a while longer, then finally reached for his body wash. He tried to calm his brain down, to think about things other than work but it was no use: his mind was over active at the best of times but when he had very little else to occupy him, work was often all he could think about. He stepped out of the shower, pulled a thick towel around his waist and then took up his spot in front of the mirror. He pulled a straight razor from the cabinet and tidied up his beard, while it could be done with magic, there was something soothing about shaving the muggle way. Every time he picked up his razor he remembered when Sirius had taken a quiet moment away from the Order to teach him how to shave the muggle way; it always filled him with a sense of affection and longing for his godfather, as well as an overwhelming amount of admiration for the ritual that went along with shaving this way - not only did it provide a closer shave than magic, but it made Harry feel pampered.
Malfoy scowled at Harry, “It’s only shit because we’ve been lumped with a case that shouldn’t even be with the Aurors.”
, he sent back. He carried on with his lesson, but now he had a warm, glowing feeling deep in his stomach.
Pansy rolled her eyes, and Blaise laughed, “Mate you’ve been single for as long as I can remember,” he grinned widely, “You need
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
“I know,” Hermione stroked Ron's hair, “me neither. Let's go get some things from his house, we need to make him comfortable and get out of the healers way,” they rose from the chairs and flooed to Grimmauld.
“Though it’s never getting worn in public, I’ll promise you that!” Draco laughed and Ron rolled his eyes playfully.
Harry sat and let Malfoy’s words sink in, “That’s not so dissimilar to you.” he said quietly.
“Draco…” he panted, lifting his head from the table, “Draco, if you carry on…” once again he let his head fall to the desk with a thump, “If you carry on like that, I’m gonna come.”
“Well, they do say that opposites attract.” Draco drawled. Harry returned Draco’s heated stare and threw caution to the wind. His heart hammered in his chest and his hands began to shake, he felt the stirrings of
Harry looked dreadful, a dark purple-black slimy wound marred his shoulder, tendrils of the curse spreading through his arm and chest indicated that the curse spread fast; whatever it was. If they looked close enough, they could see the curse pulsating under his skin, like it was sentient in it’s capture of Harry. Ron had vanished Harry's clothes, his sweat soaked, curse ridden uniform lay under a stasis charm in the corner, and performed a spell to put his fresh pyjamas on him.
nervous…”
The Hall was full. Draco and Potter could hear the thrum of noise from students talking, eating and laughing with one another through the doors to the Hall. Potter threw Draco a cursory glance, not really looking at him, but checking that he was there. Draco saw that Potter had chosen to wear his red and Gryffindor jumper under his robe, perhaps it was something of a talisman for him, perhaps a reminder of the bravery that he once possessed. If he could defeat Voldemort and save the school, he had every right to sit on that table and eat with the people he saved.
Everyone had settled down, presents had been opened, and huge quantities of Christmas dinner had been eaten. Draco had
Harry understood, it had been pure bliss living at Grimmauld Place with Draco. He initially thought that having Draco around all the time would be too much for him after living on his own for so long but it had felt so natural and easy to be with him. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. They passed the rest of the walk up to the castle in silence, appreciating the winter weather and each other’s company.
They sat quietly for a bit, the fire crackled away, and rain began to patter down the window. Every now and again the charmed snake would hiss on Malfoys cloak and Malfoy would smile slightly at it, clearly proud of his charm work. Harry stared into the fire, quite unable to fathom that he and Malfoy were having a conversation – a true, meaningful conversation and not getting on each other’s nerves. Harry was somewhat shocked that of all the people he had told his feelings to it was Malfoy, but he appreciated his efforts in trying to create a friendship where there had only been animosity for years.
A grin spread across Neville’s face as he nodded. Everyone burst into clapping and congratulations for them both. Harry hugged Neville tightly, a big grin on his face, and then took Hannah in a warm embrace.
“You’re going to wear a hole in the floor if you keep on doing that.” She commented. Harry stopped, and sat on the table that ran down the length of the room. He was careful not to disturb the decorations that Hermione had placed down it ready for Christmas Day. He drummed his fingers on the oak and looked at the clock: it was 4pm.
Draco nodded, but Harry recognised that he was trying hard to maintain his appearance – how typically Draco.
As I've mentioned before, I do have another fic underway so I'm sure that'll be up eventually!
“How do I do that?” Draco asked, his family had never really been good at talking about feelings. Or talking about anything really.
Draco nodded, “I think it will be our own little slice of heaven,” he said, “I’ll pack my things and meet you back here?” he asked, and turned to face Harry, who still held him around the waist.
Harry shot her a look with a shrug and she laughed, reaching into her bag to pull out everything from a shrunken Christmas tree and a box full of decorations to reems of wrapping paper and boxes full of what Harry assumed were presents, “Well come on, then,” she laughed at Harry and Ron, “I’m not doing all of this by myself.”
“You look mischievous tonight, Harry,” Neville smiled, “Have you been up to no good again?”
He tidied his work area and put his robes on over his smart shirt. He took a deep breath to steady himself and began the walk to Harry’s office.
“Fucking glasses,” Draco turned to look at Harry, “You don’t wear glasses anymore… that’s what’s different… I couldn’t put my finger on it.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but closed it before any words could come out. He didn’t want to break the moment. Whatever the moment was. He leaned back into Malfoy, returning his hand to sit gently on the back of his neck. In a move that he liked on himself, he traced his fingers down Malfoys spine, eventually settling on the belt loops of Dracos trousers. He pulled Dracos hips towards him, a desperate effort to get him even closer. To feel Draco against himself completely. With every move they made, Harry could feel the deft muscles beneath Malfoy’s black trousers; the slow, pulsing moves pressed them unbearably close and it was driving Harry crazy.
Draco strolled around the class, his N.E.W.Ts students were exceptionally bright, and he admired them greatly. This class was his favourite, he felt like the fewer students he had in a room, the more he could relax. This group, he knew, had the potential to be exceptional. It was near the end of the class, and so far their resulting potions had been mostly successful - nearly all of his students were getting into the rhythm of his teaching and he was getting used to them. He was almost liked, he thought.
Nancy raised her eyebrows, “Harry Potter?”
The hall was slowly filling with students, hungry for breakfast. The noise level rose and Neville beamed down on his students, some waving at him and grinning widely back at him. Draco hoped that one day he would have the admiration of his students, but doubted it since his past followed him around like a shadow on a mid-July day.
Harry sighed and nodded back, looking glumly into his glass. With no warning, Neville came into the room with a big smile and heaps of energy. He had another tray of drinks in his hand – everything from more firewhiskey to a new cocktail that Hannah was trying out. Draco looked at the tray and smiled to harry: “Maybe it is
“If you think this is bad, wait until you see the curtains on the bed!” he called through as Draco went inside.
Draco was impressed with how she approached everything he said while they spoke, there was no hint of their awful childhood relationship that broached her voice, and she treated him with such respect. She would certainly get his vote when she ran for Minister. They spoke for an hour or two about how he could go about getting this potion to people, and they settled for the simplest possible route: giving the recipe to St Mungo’s and the Ministry to do with as they wished. When they had figured out what they would do, Hermione said to leave everything to her. Draco agreed, he had a lot on his plate at the moment.
“Why lucky me?” he asked, his throat going dry. His palms were clammy and he searched for some breath. The room really was very hot all of a sudden. This was definitely flirting, he thought.
He remembered to breathe. Harry hadn’t told him that he was seeing anyone. Was this why he had suddenly been too busy to see Draco? Why did he
Draco looked awkwardly around, “Drink?” he asked eventually, though he looked like he was not entirely convinced that it was a good idea.
“I’m just having trouble coming to terms with how I’m feeling about things,” Draco explained, “I’m having
Harry gulped, he was more nervous than he’d been in a while, “Can we just talk for a bit?” he asked. Draco’s shoulders slumped but he nodded and pulled Harry towards him.
As always, your support is massively appreciated - you're all amazing.
Harry stood up from the table, his empty plate vanishing, and drained his cup of tea, “Don’t be late.” He winked at Draco, and Draco felt the faint flutter of butterflies in his stomach.
Draco let go of Harry for a minute and waved his wand around the desk, casting protective enchantments, with a teasing smile. He undid the buttons of his black shirt as he did, and slid the shirt off as he finished. Harry looked around him confused, but aware of what the spells did: nobody would be able to see or hear them. His heart beat faster, and he felt his trousers straining around his crotch.
Harry smiled as graciously as he could, “I seem to be at a disadvantage,” he looked up at the blonde, “as you know me... but I don’t know you…?” he angled for his name, and wrapped his arm around the taut waist of the man before him. The Dancer’s skin burned, and seemed to be so fine that it looked like it wasn’t real.
“Sorry I was… erm…” Harry hesitated, “Daydreaming.” Harry shook his head and Hermione shot him a proud look.
Harry chuckled softly, “Yeah something like that,” he put the now empty cup on the bedside table, “How are you feeling?”
They hadn’t been fully qualified Aurors for long, they were still getting used to being the ones making decisions and being responsible for things. They had been partnered together because of their performances during their training, and it was not a decision that they had really become comfortable with yet, even after a few months of working together. Harry, at first, had been so annoyed that they were tied with being the youngest Aurors ever, but now he found it amusing - they were absolutely clueless sometimes, other times, they were an amazing team despite their dislike for each other. Malfoy was clearly taking the situation worse than Harry was, he would often get agitated when Harry seemed to be more in control, calmer than he was. It wasn’t unheard of for Malfoy to have brief moments of what could maybe be described as panic. Luckily for Malfoy, Harry had become unusually responsible and level headed after the war, perhaps he had grown up quickly after all.
wearing his favourite outfit, that was true, and he knew that he looked good. His wild, curly hair was pulled back at the nape of his neck, his stubble was now a short beard, and he wore a dark red, three-piece, velvet suit with a black shirt. His shoulder holster for his wand was firmly fixed underneath and even though he had felt ridiculous with it at first - he happened to now feel naked without it. Draco continued to really look at him and a satisfied smile settled onto his face. Harry tried to not to react to this but he must have done a bad job because Draco turned his head quickly away. Harry smirked.
Harry smirked back at him, “And how’s that going for you?” he asked.
“What have you got there?” she asked, looking intently at the boxes that Harry held.
Ron slammed the letter down on the table in their flat in wizarding London and sighed, “‘Mione, come help me here,” he called through to her, “I can't think right now,” as he spoke to her, he quickly hid some sheafs of parchment under the newspaper.
“I am pretty tired,” Malfoy mused, “I guess we should call it quits for today at least.” He raked his hand through his hair but didn’t move from his spot at the desk.
Harry shrugged and sighed, “Do you want to sit upstairs again?” he asked, he liked the room up there, it was intimate and warm.
Kreacher smiled at Harry, and nodded his wizened head, “Anything, master.”
Neville smiled to himself and carried on eating. Draco sat and thought to himself about Potter. So, it would appear that Potter was looking out for him. The least he could do in return was look out for Potter.
“I didn’t, you know,
“Well how about that?” he smirked, “The golden boy got the golden snitch.” He was being sarcastic of course, and Harry laughed in response.
Neville smirked at Draco, “Are you friends now? What’s happening there?”
“The morning?” He grinned down to Harry, taking pity at how drunk he was.
throughout the entire date. I’d have much rather been in the Three Brooms with you again.” Harry admitted. He dropped his gaze to the floor, not wanting Draco to see that he had been watching him.
If anyone is wondering (and because I love bikes so much myself) Harry's bike, Bess, is a Triumph Thunderbird, in black :)
Harry shook his head. He didn’t like the tone that she took with him – was he in trouble? He hadn’t been in trouble for that long that he couldn’t really remember what it felt like.
Potter tensed for a moment, a muscle clenching in his jaw as he considered Draco's offer. He then seemed to relax once he’d made up his mind, “I think I might try it.”
A silence descended like a thick mist, enveloping them in a bubble despite the loudness of the bass beating in Harrys chest.
Harry picked up the box, branded ‘Draco’s Dispensary’ and looked at Malfoy, “What is it?”
Draco looked at Harry from under his lashes and licked his lips slightly, “What do you want to do after this?” he asked, his voice still low.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, “Ah… Draco. Are you two an item now?” she asked, smiling excitedly. Ron came back into the kitchen, his eyebrows raised in anticipation for Harry’s answer.
Draco obliged. His chest rose and fell quickly with his breaths, and if Harry looked closely enough, he could see Draco’s pulse pounding in his neck. Draco stood with his arms slightly outstretched, and Harry surveyed his gorgeous body. He admired his lean arms, his dark mark standing out stark against his pale skin and scars scattering over his torso. They shimmered almost silver in the light of the classroom. He was already incredibly hard, Harry noticed, as he raised an eyebrow at Draco’s boxers. Draco removed them.
Draco smiled again, how typical of Potter to try and make other people feel better when he was suffering the most, “Thank you, Neville,” Draco was genuinely glad to have someone like Neville on his side, he knew that he would stick up for him if there was any hassle, “I appreciate your thinking of me, I might come around for a butterbeer or two.”
Hermione had seemingly given up on finding what she was looking for, “So who’s coming this year? The family of course, Molly, Arthur, Ginny and George. Is Percy coming?”
Ron bit his lip, and then turned to Draco, “They put bars on his window-”
His fire crackled away as he fell to sleep, curled under a blanket. Home, at last.
The cold air sobered him up somewhat as they stood at the apparition point. The silence had to be broken, “your place or mine?” Harry asked, his voice hoarse and so needy.
They walked down to the feast after they got ready, the hall was bustling with students talking and laughing and there was a very lively atmosphere. Neville sat between them both at the high table. Harry couldn’t keep the smile from his face as he looked out over the hall – would people notice a difference in him? He glanced at Draco who seemed cool and natural as he sat up there on display – Harry felt like he had a filthy secret, like he had something on his mind that only he knew about: he had a lover and he had been with his lover all afternoon. He liked it.
Harry groaned, grabbing at Dracos shirt to get it off him. He was far too clothed, too covered up for Harry's taste. He wanted Draco exposed, wretched, hopeless… eager. He wanted him in any position that would speed up the whole process. It was already becoming too much. They both clawed at each other's clothes in a frenzy, and once Draco was naked, Harry didn’t much care about himself still wearing his shirt.
Harry sucked air in through his teeth, “It just didn’t work out,” Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow, “I ended things with her.” Harry drained his glass, the firewhiskey burning his throat in a way that was not at all unpleasant.
Ron laid himself on the sofa and picked up the daily Prophet, he huffed at some article or other and settled down. Hermione sat on the sofa with him and Ron put his head on her lap. She stroked his hair absentmindedly as she pointed to something in the paper. Harry sat in front of the fire still and smiled to himself, wishing that he and Draco could be doing that. He wondered what Draco was doing now. Was he still at work in the shop? Was he sat alone in Malfoy Manor wrapping Harry’s present and stressing over getting every detail perfect? Was he packing his bag to come over and counting down the hours until he could break away and see Harry?
He broke free from his distracting reverie and tried gain to concentrate. He noticed an envelope had appeared on his desk. He groaned as he recognised the writing – it was McGonagall.
“Well, yes. You’ll have to foot that part of the bill yourself!” She laughed. Harry stood up and gave her a grateful hug, she didn’t need to do that much for him.
Draco broke the seal and unfurled the parchment. It was from Hermione.
“I don’t think I’d be too welcome in The Three Broomsticks anymore,” He traced the flight of a bird with his finger on the glass of the window, “not after everything that happened there.”
I regret to inform you that the next chapter will be the last, so savour this one <3
“It’s from Hermione,” Harry said as he unfolded it, “She says that she’s just about to go home so she can’t swing by, but yes, you could very well be right.” He sighed. So, Draco had been right and now Harry looked like a dick who didn’t trust his partner.
“Well… lucky you.” Draco smirked. His eyes were so intense as he stared at Harry, his icy eyes were somehow burning. Harry felt his heart rate quicken.
His final present was from Neville, and while it wasn’t a golden envelope, it was a rather substantial, heavy, framed picture of Draco and Harry stood near one of the large fireplaces in The Three Broomsticks. This one they had posed for, at the request of Neville. For a moment, Draco almost didn’t recognise himself. His eyes weren’t as cold as they usually were, his composed demeanour was relaxed, and the fire cast a warm glow over the picture, his hand and Harrys were intertwined in front of the fire, and Draco turned to look at Harry. When their eyes met in the photograph, they broke out laughing. He hadn’t expected to ever look so happy and satisfied with life. Harry gave his hand a squeeze and Draco squeezed it back.
Harry sniggered, “We really should go and see if anybody is up yet, it’s bad form for guests to be awake before us.”
He slid his shirt off, and whipped off his belt. Harry undid his own trousers and let Draco pull them off in a swift movement. He kissed Harry’s stomach, hips and thighs as he lay there, almost completely naked, with bulging boxers and a heaving chest. Draco had never been so turned on before. He stood for a second to remove his own trousers but they were soon intertwined on the bed again. He sat across Harry, as Harry had done to him and moved his hips. Harry threw his head back momentarily and drew in a sharp breath.
Hermione nodded, and smiled, “Well it’s good to see that you’re doing better,” she looked past Draco and stood up, “Harry! I’m glad you could make it.”
Draco nodded, “That’s not so dissimilar to what happened to me. God, we’ve both been through it, huh?”
Harry cleared up all the discarded paper, bags, labels, ribbons and cards and then everyone sat, peacefully in the living room. The fire carried on crackling, and Draco’s charmed piano carried on to play. Arthur had fallen asleep on the settee, George showed Harry something from his stack of WWW products. Molly spoke to Hannah and Neville, congratulating them on their pregnancy and talking about the joys of being a parent.
Draco planted a chaste kiss on Harry’s forehead and stroked his hand along his back. Harry shifted slightly and kissed Draco, fully on the lips, back. Draco opened the kiss, and it very quickly was like they’d not stopped kissing since they were in the Three Brooms. Draco’s hands touched Harry all over, feeling every inch of his strong body. Draco lingered over Harry’s shoulders and biceps, impressed at how toned he was. Harry pulled away, sensing Draco’s thoughts.
Harry smiled at Draco, he was so understanding that it confounded Draco a bit sometimes, “It’s really okay, Draco,” he said, “It’s all water under the bridge.” His voice was soft and gentle.
And yes, the bike is a 'they', bc why not? xx
There was a soft knock at his door, and someone cleared their throat.
“Oh,” Harry exclaimed softly, “Malfoy. Hello.” He was shocked to see him here, to say the least.
Harry sat on the counter in the kitchen and pulled two small wooden boxes from the cabinet. They were inlaid with mother of pearl filigree and was polished to a high shine. Harry opened them. Inside them laid two delicate teacups, one decorated with a dark green pattern; the other with the pattern in a dark red. Harry had had these specially made by an artisan on Diagon Alley. He cast a protean charm over the teacups and waited for a minute or two. He stroked the green teacup with his wand, and a blank space formed in the middle of the pattern. Harry smiled as he saw a mirroring space opening up on the red teacup. He muttered something under his breath, his wand still on the green cup, and saw the words come up on the red cup. He marvelled at the power and existence of magic for a second or two and then put the cups gently back into their respective boxes. These would make a wonderful Christmas present for Draco.
“Coffee?” he asked as he stretched the top of his back, hunching over a desk wasn’t his favourite.
He better not say that too often, Harry thought, or things may get out of hand very quickly.
Draco broke free and caught his breath, though his hand worked its way under Harry’s skirt and brushed against the soft boxers that he found there, “we should…” he was breathing hard now, and Harry could tell that he was trying to calm himself down, “we should go…”
“It’s not illegal to feel, Mr Malfoy,” She rolled her eyes, “though you should maybe figure out what you’re feeling. It will clarify a few things.”
He slid a finger between Dracos cheeks, working him there while he sucked hard. Draco had more restraint than Harry had, only committing to small thrusts here and there, he spent more time telling Harry how good he was, how divine he felt… it sent the feeling in Harry's chest into overdrive.
She pulled out a notebook and a quill and clasped her hands together on the table, “I think it’s a wonderful idea,” she said, “We just need to talk through how we’re going to do it.”
Harry satisfies his curiosity, and gets an unexpected visitor.
that I’m not entirely used to having.”
Well... the boys finally get their date.
Harry cleared his throat as Draco put a hand to his neck, and smirked slightly, “Okay, maybe it was a pretty good afternoon.” Draco admitted quietly.
Draco loitered in the hallway, pacing back and forth with his hands over his eyes. Harry stood near the door, not wanting to crowd Draco. He realised that he was crying, and Harry felt a pang of guilt – perhaps this had been too much for Draco to get used to. The sounds of laughter and music was still audible from the living room and Harry cursed himself for putting Draco in this position.
“Just things we’ll need.” She shrugged and continued to look for things in her bag.
Harry nodded slightly, and turned to go back to his quarters, a strange feeling deep in his stomach like something was about to happen.
Draco stared at Harry, his mouth slightly agape, “I’m not jealous,” he sighed, “I’m merely upset that you didn’t tell me that you had a date.” He sneered, and Harry winced at the sound. He hated the way Draco could sound so vicious so easily.
Ron and George rose from the settee to help, and eventually there was a pile of presents in front of everyone. How all the presents had fit under the tree, nobody knew. Draco gasped as Ron put some presents at his feet. Ron gave Draco a reassuring smile and Hermione looked at him proudly.
He was well aware that he was staring, but to hell with it, it was totally worth it.
“Morning,” he sighed, “I didn’t expect you to still be here.” He leaned against the archway and crossed his arms over his chest.
“I had thought about it,” Draco admitted, “but I thought that I might actually donate the recipe to the Post-War charity.” Draco mumbled the last part, but Harry understood.
Harry stood at the door, a slight smile on his face, no wand in hand. Draco didn’t know that Potter could do wordless, wandless magic. Git.
Harry looked at him quizzically, “What do you mean?”
“That’s a heavy question, Potter.” Draco mumbled, he wasn’t sure that he wanted to have this conversation with Harry, but it would seem that he didn’t have a choice.
Harry lay back, and touched himself as Draco removed the rest of his clothes. He shot harry a flirtatious look as he stripped, a sexy smirk creeping up onto his lips as he did.
Harry protested, “Really, you don’t need to help me clean the entire house. Kreacher is more than capable and he’s working on it as we speak.”
Draco smiled back at her and excused himself for a second, closing the door behind him softly. Harry also excused himself and followed while the presents were still being sorted.
The door opened, and Harry let his surprise show for a split second. Draco had answered in just his trousers.
The dancer blushed, “Alexandre.” he replied, and seemed to come across quite shy as Harry turned his full attention to him. Harry could tell that the man was only attracted to him for his fame, but that didn’t stop Harry from being attracted to him. Alexandre dropped his head, gazing coyly toward the floor.
Harry pulled Draco towards him by his belt and took control, as if all of a sudden, he couldn’t bear to be apart from him. He ran a hand through his blonde hair, pulling it and breaking the kiss. Draco smirked at Harry, his eyes were clouded and he was breathless. His lips were pink and swollen from their kiss and his chest heaved. Harry’s hands fumbled with the buckle on Draco’s belt but a hand stopped him.
It was pleasant to have a dedicated wizarding nightlife spot, as opposed to a nefarious den of dark magic, the whole community (or near enough) had agreed that the change was needed, and after the grand reopening of Knockturn Alley by the Minister, the wizarding economy had seen an unprecedented boost. It had given those who lost their businesses to the war a chance to start up again, and Gringotts had arranged financial support for every single one of them. This space had become a beacon for how things could change, more so than any new statue in the Ministry atrium; that was why it had become one of Draco's favourite places, it was symbolic but also fun as hell.
“However, I can make tea in my office?” Harry offered, wondering if simple tea would be good enough for someone like Malfoy.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything. Blaise looked between the two with a mischievous smile on his face, “Trouble in paradise, Dray?” his eyes glinted under the club lights.
“We have these names, Anderson,” Harry passed him his piece of paper, and threw a glance at Draco, “Can you look into them a bit more for us while we keep on digging?” Harry gave a charming smile to Anderson who nodded. Draco silently held up his list and Anderson took it as he left.
He tried the door – it was open. He entered the room and it was empty. The door to Potters office was closed. He knocked on this door, and heard a shuffling around inside.
“And how are you finding that?” She asked, somewhat surprised.
.” Harry tried hard not to lose his temper. The scratching sound of his quill maintained throughout the room, not ceasing as he spoke.
Draco nodded, and seeing as how his last class of the day was done, he would like to relax. He met Potter at the table, and they walked out together silently. The corridors were quiet, students were likely cosied up in the Great Hall waiting for dinner, or sat in front of fireplaces in common rooms. Draco hoped that his students were doing the reading for his next class. Potter seemed to enjoy walking in silence, and so Draco kept quiet, appreciating his company and his relaxed manner.
Draco watched Harry intently. Harry pressed his wand to the red cup, and within just a moment, the words that he thought faded onto the green cup, the pattern parting elegantly:
Surprise flashed across Malfoys face for a second, which then turned to relief, “That will do just fine.” He replied, and almost smiled at Harry.
“You know…” he spoke low, right in Harry's ear, “dancing with someone usually requires moving,”
Draco smiled, “Have you been talking to Potter?” he asked quietly.
Harry smiled, “That night, after Esmerelda left, I checked my map and I saw you were still up. I was so tempted to come and talk to you, but I didn’t because I saw you with Esmerelda - I thought she was your girlfriend or something.” Potter laughed.
“Are you okay?” he asked, his voice was small and the room was tense – was it because they hadn’t spoken? Had Draco done something wrong?
“Is he going to die?” The worry in Ron's voice sent more tears to Hermione's eyes. They'd always been as close as brothers, and Ron had already lost one. He didn't need to lose another.
“Come here,” Harry groaned, he threw his head back and it hit the desk with a thud, still stroking himself, “Oh, god, come here.”
“Do we
Draco pulled on a pair of jeans when Harry really couldn’t find any of his pyjama bottoms that would fit him and they finally left the bedroom.
“You’ll be in Regulus’ old room – right at the top.” Harry said and Ron left, levitating the bag up to the top floor.
He sighed, but looked at the paperwork he had got done. It was some achievement at least. He sauntered over to Potters desk and checked how much he’d got done. Surprise, surprise, he’d finished. Draco saw that Harry had been writing something, the page was strangely blank but with a thin veil of something covering it; it must have been charmed to be undetectable. Draco’s interest was piqued. He looked to the door but couldn’t see Harry. He stealthily lifted the piece of parchment and checked the piece underneath - sure enough there were indents in it, but Malfoy didn’t have time to figure out what he’d been scribbling so secretly.
Harry nodded, “I haven’t been doing much,” he said, and put his empty teacup on the table, “I’ve not really wanted to these last few years.”
With the mention of bad form, Draco sighed. He knew Harry was right, “… fine.” He muttered, and planted a kiss on Harry’s head. They slowly and reluctantly untangled themselves from each other and left the bed. Harry pulled on a t-shirt and some pyjama trousers, and Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
Harry went back to the bar, Ron had decided to head back home to Hermione after Harry had decided to leave the dancefloor. It was getting late, but as Harry leaned against the brass bar top, the bartender came back over. He contemplated following Ron and going home, there wasn’t much for him here.
“So,” said Potter eventually, “I was thinking of going to The Three Brooms,” he sighed slightly, “but I don’t want to go alone.” He glanced self-consciously at Draco, then back to the desk in front of him.
close for them to comfortably dance to together, especially as Harry still kind of wanted to pull.
Neville, completely oblivious to what was going on, and not able to see through the charms, looked around the ‘empty’ room for a second or two longer, appeared to mull something over, then left and closed the door behind him.
“I’m sorry, Draco.” He groaned.
They nodded a solemn response, and after Hermione had placed a tender kiss to Harry's forehead, they left.
Harry rolled his eyes, “I literally didn’t say anything…” he snapped back, “I’m just doing paperwork.” Harry threw the casefile back at Malfoy and carried on doing the paperwork for their last case, working under the thin light of a lamp; the only source of illumination near Harry’s desk.
Stay safe xx
Harry felt Draco come over to him, so he moved his arm, allowing Draco to get as close as possible. Draco kissed his chest, just a soft chaste kiss, right near his pounding heart. It was terribly tender, so Harry wrapped his arm around Dracos shoulders, holding him to his side. His eyes still closed, he felt, rather than saw, Draco looking at him. He felt like he should say something, but this moment was so fragile, so ethereal, that he didn’t want to spoil it.
“Well, yes. Quite,” Draco responded, clearing his throat, “Anyway, I’ll leave you to your exercise.” Draco left, leaving Harry to do as he wished.
He couldn’t hear what Harry murmured back, but Neville sighed. He leaned back in his chair so that Draco could see Potter, and turned to him, “Draco, would you come to the Three Brooms if Harry did?”
Harry sat anxiously on his desk at the front of his class as his sixth years poured into the room, chatting and laughing to their friends. This was always his least favourite lesson, but he knew that it was one of the most important that any student faced. He took a deep breath to steady himself. His students took their seats and hushed. They had become used to his colourful lessons - he always had examples to show them, and he was always very hands on. This time though, he sat without his wand, hands clasped in front of himself, and with a solemn look on his face. Their curiosity was obviously piqued.
A buzz of excitement passed over his students - this class in particular loved anything dangerous. It made Harry smile, remembering just how much trouble he got himself into as a student.
He felt it rip through him, deep and forceful, and relinquished any sense of decorum he had and let himself moan Draco’s name over and over like some kind of hedonistic religious chant. His come spilled over the desk, over Draco’s hand, and over his own stomach and he had to take some deep breaths to calm his heart rate in an attempt to recover. Draco’s hand had found its way out of Harry’s hair and onto his shoulder. Draco’s head lay on the back of Harry’s neck once more and his thumb stroked small circles on Harrys shoulder. Harry could feel Draco’s hot breath on his neck and it sent shivers down his spine.
Harry poured the tea into the teacups, and handed a cup to Malfoy. He smiled at Harry and thanked him. They drank their tea in relative silence, maybe passing the odd comment about the quality of the tea leaves, or the heat from the fire.
Harry had come to Draco’s room. He sat on Draco’s elegant chaise longue and fiddled with his hands. He was nervous, Draco thought. They’d hardly spoken for the time that Harry had been there. Draco sat on his desk chair, with his legs crossed at the ankles and waited for Harry to say something. Eventually, Harry looked up at Draco.
“Harry?” He said quietly, and knelt at the side of his bed, not wanting to startle Potter, but needing to wake him up, “Harry, come on, it’s alright.” He put his hand on Potters shoulder, and his eyes burst open. Full of tears and fear, he stared at Draco, his green eyes wide with shock at seeing him in his room. He took a moment to calm his breathing and then slumped back onto his sweat soaked pillow with a sigh. His breathing steadied, and Draco kept his distance for a bit. Harry eventually wiped his face with his sleeve and sat up in his bed.
Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s back, encapsulating him. They both had more purchase this way, more room to move, to try and break each other's resolve.
“McGonagall wanted to know if there was a way that life could be made a little easier,” Harry said, a smile beginning to creep onto his face, “so she gave us this.” Harry held the key up and Draco began to smile.
After a particularly loud third year class, Harry had the rest of his day off. He sat at his desk at the front of his classroom, massaging his temples, and looking at a stack of textbooks to put away. He looked at his wand, wondering whether or not to use magic to clear up but decided not to. He still did many muggle things, it was after all, what he had been used to for so long.
in his trousers.
On the fourth day, Hermione and Ron received a letter from Malfoy:
“He’s not wrong Harry,” Ron took a long swig of his drink, “there’ll be somebody in here to satisfy even your predilections.”
Leave some love - let me know how you're finding the fic so far! xx
Harry’s stomach knotted, the adrenaline had worn off a bit and he wasn’t entirely sure what was going to happen. Harry stood awkwardly as Draco closed the curtains, lit the burner and charmed his candles around the place. He swung off his cloak in a single flourish and stood in the middle of the candles, looking at Harry.
“I guess I got sick of people coming up to me all the time,” Harry’s voice broke slightly, betraying his emotions, “It sounds awful, but I just wanted everything to quieten down but I can’t even go for a casual drink unless its in a muggle bar. Every now and again I’ll bump into a witch or wizard that knows who I am and I feel so suffocated. I never wanted any of this,” Harry turned to look at Malfoy who was listening quietly, he seemed genuinely concerned, as if the mask had slipped for a second or two, “you know, I don’t really do anything anymore. I couldn’t tell you the last time I went to Diagon Alley and looked at brooms, or wondered around Flourish and Blotts. I get Kreacher to do a lot of stuff for me, or I just don’t do it at all.”
Leave some love xx
Malfoy nodded slowly, “Can I ask a favour?” He asked, his voice small, “If that’s okay?”
A note sat on Harry's desk, a few days after their reconciliation, signed neatly by Draco. Their first date. He had requested Harry's company at a mid league quidditch match, something that intrigued Harry. He had imagined that Draco would drag him along to an art gallery, or an opera, maybe even a regular play if it was classy enough. Lower level quidditch was notoriously brash, unregulated, and tough: not something he associated with Malfoy.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” He tapped the parchment with his wand and watched the inky red writing dance across it.
Harry put his glass down more forcefully than he anticipated and steadied his breath. Draco smirked at him and did the same. He lazily drew his hand up to his collar and undid a button or two, keeping eye contact with Harry. Harry had butterflies in his stomach, he was sure of it. He licked his lips. Draco slowly stood up, and made his way over to Harry. Harry stood up and leaned against the fireplace, the heat from the fire intensifying the heat between them.
Harry raised his eyebrows, “Okay, well where do you want to start?”
Harry’s breath began to catch, he’d never been ridden like this before. He usually preferred to stick to positions less intimate, less familiar; but this was unlike anything else. Soon enough, he felt the deep sensation of his own orgasm building, he reached up and pulled Draco's hair, hard enough to force his head back. Draco laughed, clearly enjoying Harry’s reaction and knowing where this was going.
He led Harry to the bed and laid next to him, his soft mattress enveloping them both in a comforting embrace. Draco put his arm around Harry and Harry leaned into him. It was nice to be held. Harry laid his head over Draco’s heart and listened to the thudding in his chest. It soothed him like nothing else could.
Harry understood, though with Hannah being the landlady there he didn’t think it would be an issue, “That was years ago though, Malfoy, I doubt that it would be held against you now.” The kettle boiled and Harry turned, summoning his tea set to him. He put his wand away and poured the water into a teapot, swirling the tea leaves around inside.
They sat in relative silence as they ate. Neville would occasionally beam at Harry or Draco but had stopped teasing them. Draco would glance at Harry every now and again; if their eyes happened to meet Harry’s stomach would fill with butterflies and he could not stop smiling.
Was that banter? Draco thought, had their relationship reached that level? He laughed with Potter and they carried on walking through the rain, Draco's charm keeping them dry. Every now and again, Draco would look at Potter just to double check that he wasn’t imagining things - they really had put the past behind them.
“Err,” Harry eyed the glasses cautiously, “I didn’t realise it was
Neville left, taking a pastry or something with him as he did so. The gap between Harry and Draco seemed huge. Harry moved to where Neville had sat, ringing his plate with him.
Draco, surprised, blurted, “Catch you in a compromising position, Potter?”
Draco took his hand away and pulled himself off Harry. Harry brought his head up to look at the space that Draco now didn’t occupy. He let out a whimper, and frowned at Draco slightly, silently begging him to come back.
He cleared his throat, and knocked on the door, the present tucked under his arm. There was no answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Since Draco hadn’t really had a chance to walk around the grounds since his return to Hogwarts, he took the chance to do that today. He wrapped his old Slytherin scarf around his neck, pulled the hood of his cloak over his head and set out to walk to the lake. The stillness of the water and the deep green hue always brought a wave of comfort over him, perhaps it reminded him of the Slytherin common room, or maybe he just liked the water.
Draco sat with his head in his hands. Why did everything have to be so damn annoying? Maybe he could try to talk to Hermione – she knew Potter better than he did.
“Everything okay?” he asked quietly.
“What didn’t work out about it?” Draco asked.
Malfoy turned and stared intently at the teapot, “perhaps,” he said, “perhaps people would be okay with my being around.” He stood gracefully, took off his heavy cloak, the snake hissing as it was unclasped, and walked over to the fireplace. His black and green suit fit him well, and was clearly as expensive as the rest of his items.
Harry smiled to himself, and pulled out his wand. He had not looked at the map in months, but it always brought him an odd sense of comfort.
Second of all - Thank you all for your support and love, I've been floored by how quickly we've got to over 2000 hits and 100 kudos.. wa totally not expecting that <3
When they had finished wrapping their presents, they put them under the tree and admired their handiwork. Ron joined them after a while and put an arm around Hermione’s waist. Harry felt a deep emptiness in his chest – he missed Draco more than anything. He wished so much that he could have been there to decorate the tree and wrap the presents; he imagined bickering softly over the decoration colour scheme, wrapping presents at opposite ends of the room so that nothing was revealed before it should’ve been, and greeting their friends at the door together as if it were their house. He sighed. There was plenty of time in their lives to experience that.
Harry nodded, “Though it does require some training.” he added.
Harry nodded, and Draco kissed the back of his neck again, as he eased himself into Harry. Harry gasped as more and more of Draco filled him, and Draco let his head drop onto Harry’s back, his forehead touching Harry’s hot skin.
“Heavens knows that I’ve not been used to that in my time.” Draco commented and drained his teacup.
Draco laughed, she clearly wasn’t going to take any shit, “I’m not used to being in a weird place
share of the paperwork then we could actually get started on this case,” he said through gritted teeth, “but until you decide that paperwork isn’t
“It’s the five-star service here, you know, Harry.” He chuckled and Harry smirked. Draco’s voice was quiet and husky, it was a level of intimacy that Harry had not experienced in such a long time. Draco put his own cup down and picked up his clothes. They got dressed fairly quickly and in relative silence. Harry could feel Draco’s eyes on him as he buttoned his shirt up, and his heart beat faster in his chest. He calmed himself down, reminding himself that they could be alone tonight.
Draco looked at Potter and nodded, silently telling him that ‘he’s got this’. Neville, who sat in the middle of the two, turned to Draco and smiled.
Potter landed next to Draco, his face flushed with exhilaration and wind burn, “How are you today, Malfoy?” he asked, slightly breathless from his flight.
Harry laughed at Draco’s comment and flinched slightly as he felt Draco’s cock grace him. Draco grabbed a handful of Harry’s bum cheek and kissed the back of his neck.
Malfoy sat with Blaise and Pansy at the other side of the booth, a clear divide still present between the two houses. Pansy aimed a wicked smile at Harry as she plucked a drink from the tray. Blaise looked across the club, flaunting his ownership; surveying the dancefloor. He sat on the very edge of the booth, clearly ready to interject if anything got out of hand. The stark contrast between the Slytherins and the Gryffindors was evident, but there was a sense of nostalgia to the arrangement.
They walked in silence back to Dracos large bed, crumpled and stained from their machinations. Within mere moments, the fatigue took over them both, and they slipped into a dreamless sleep, both unsure of what the morning would bring.
“That’s very true,” he leaned back on his desk, with his arms folded over his chest, “Can anyone name these curses?” he asked.
Draco pulled Harry into a tight hug, “Of course, you idiot, it’s a fantastic idea,” he planted a kiss onto Harry’s hair, “I was going a little bit crazy sleeping on my own.” Draco added, his voice low.
“I don’t know,” Draco smiled, “maybe two? I have to sort some things out with a student of mine.” He grabbed his heavy charmed snake cloak and headed towards the door. Harry followed, it was clear that Draco had to go.
“Alright, but, where on earth are we?” Draco asked, looking around this part of the castle with a frown on his face. There was a small terrace of maisonettes with balconies looking out over the corridor - it was like a miniature street within the castle itself. Draco hadn’t really seen anything like it before.
Harry looked at himself, and saw that he had little splashes of paint on him, “Erm,” he smiled, “I’m redecorating.” He admired his handiwork on the front door – it was half green, half red.
“Hullo Harry,” he smiled, “Good to see you again! You really must drop by the Three Broomsticks this year,” he glanced at Harry, knowing that he didn’t venture out much because he tended to get surrounded easily, “Hannah and I could make sure that you have some peace and quiet.”
He walked back to his room in the dungeons and sat quietly on his chaise longue. Draco thought for a moment, satisfied with how Harry had accepted his potion. Perhaps he would have better rest now, Draco hoped.
Draco came in to find Harry looking out over the skyline from the balcony. His long hair was a mess, and he was wrapped in Dracos sheet. He put the pot of tea down on the table on the balcony and lit a cigarette. A bad habit, but one that he only indulged in after a particularly good shagging.
“Two more,” he said, “What are they?” Harry surveyed the room and felt bad for his students. They had come into his class excited, but they were now somewhat disheartened; memories of their parent’s stories coming to the front of their minds.
“Harry,” he spoke calmly, holding his hands out to show that he didn’t have his wand, “It’s just me. You’re alright.” His face rested peacefully and his eyes, though icy, were sympathetic. It was not a look that Harry was used to seeing on Draco.
He held his hand out, “Come on then,” Harry took it and followed him. Ever since they had had a long conversation one night about their blunders at the Yule Ball, and how much easier it would have been if they’d just gone together, their friendship had a lot fewer boundaries. They often danced together at clubs, until Harry found someone to pair off with, or until Ron wanted to go home. They had become very comfortable just expressing their admiration and platonic affection for each other, and they had no real qualms about any of it. It had been awkward at first, especially for Harry whose upbringing hadn’t exactly been full of expressed feelings and relaxed sentiments, but now they were closer friends than ever before.
Draco took a deep breath, “Oh, well that’s a loaded question, Potter.”  He turned to look at the man walking by his side and carried on, “My House Elf, Esmerelda woke you from a nightmare. She knew that we were in the same school year, and told me about it.” Harry looked slightly shocked, but a smile crept up onto his face as Draco spoke, “It got me thinking, really thinking, about what you went through and I realised that you did so much at such a young age and I thought that you probably and I probably had some things in common now. Turns out we did,” they walked on as they left the Hogwarts grounds.
Draco sucked in a breath, unsure of the answer to the question himself, “I think we’re friends? We had tea the other day and a rather deep conversation but I’ve not seen him since.”
I hope you enjoy this chapter :) I really appreciate all of your support, it means so much <3
“Hey, Kreacher,” Harry called, and carried on sorting some things out, Kreacher came with a pop into the room a minute or so later, “Can you do me a favour please?”
She glanced through the letter, “just tell him that Harry is doing fine, and that we will let the healers deal with Robards. If Harry does wake up any time soon I don't want Draco there to create drama.” She sighed, and left the room again, leaving Ron to peruse his secret parchment.
Harry smiled, and Draco looked at him with a glint in his eyes that could only be described as pure, unfiltered lust. It made Harry’s heartbeat speed up drastically. He leaned forwards and kissed Draco, neglecting the work on his desk. Draco kissed him back, so powerfully, that Harry forgot that they were in such a public space for a minute or two. They fought for dominance, Harry’s tongue taking control of the kiss. Draco moaned, he secretly loved it when Harry won. Despite this, Draco lifted him onto the desk and Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s lithe waist. Draco pulled Harry’s legs up further, holding them there as they kissed on the desk.
A Hufflepuff called Henry shot his hand up and Harry prompted him to talk, “Thank you,” he said simply, “Thank you for what you did.” his students nodded and murmured in agreement. Harry felt a lump rising in his throat. People thanked him all the time, but he’d never had a student say that. Harry nodded in response, “You’re more than welcome.” he said, hoping that his voice didn’t betray him.
Evening folks! I've had a shit of a day at work so there'll be two chapters up today... got to get it out of my system you know? This one is short and sweet and the next one is... well. Something.
“It did seem like all of a sudden your name stopped appearing in the papers. What happened?” Malfoy asked. It sounded like Malfoy had been checking up on Harry over the years.
Draco looked, bleary eyed, through the arch way to the settee in Harry’s office, “Accio settee,” he laughed, and the seat came flying through the arch to the end of Harry’s bed, “Okay, night Harry.” He said as he climbed onto it and promptly got comfortable, smiling at Harry.
Harry lay there, motionless, covered in bruises and surrounded by healers. The healers were performing spells and taking notes in a quiet frenzy. As Ron saw the scene in front of him, he broke down.
“Come on, Potter,” she smirked, “You’ve been especially lax in your teaching duties lately.”
It was the morning after Draco had gone to Potter. He woke up, not in his own bed, but under a blanket on the settee in Potters office. The sun streamed in through the window casting a warm glow across the room and he could hear birds singing. As a crimson curtain hung over the archway to Harry's bedroom, Draco assumed that he wasn’t awake yet. He had not woken up since Draco had arrived, which was a good thing, Draco thought.
Draco sighed, “I’m not entirely sure, Nancy, now that I think about it.”
“Turn around.”
Draco flew carefully, his eyes surveying the air for the snitch. With a golden flash, and a fleeting moment, he saw it. With no hesitation, and wanting to win, he flew with such speed toward his target. He almost had it in his grasp before it darted off in the other direction. Draco, being a skilled flyer, followed it. Harry was onto him. He felt Harry flying next to him, watching his actions to see where he would go. Now was the time to think: could Draco reach the snitch with Harry on his tail or would he have to shake him off? Was now the time to employ a convincing feint or did he have the speed to catch the snitch as he was?
“I had them made,” harry said, his voice was quiet, “watch…” he pressed his wand to the red teacup and the pattern parted. The words ‘Merry Christmas Hermione’ appeared on the green cup and Hermione smiled.
There was a murmur of agreement around the room and people slowly filed through to the living room. A fire glowed in the grate, candles flickered through the room, and a pile of presents surrounded the tree.
He got up from the settee, and stood near the fire. He looked around the office and smiled to himself: the room was very Potter. A Gryffindor jumper lay across the back of his desk chair, there was a signed poster of the Holyhead Harpies on his bookshelf, and an old group photograph was pinned to the wood. Draco recognised Sirius Black and Mad-eye Moody grinning back at him, of course, but the others he wasn’t sure that he knew. He looked at the books on the shelf, and recognised some wizarding classics. There was a lot of reference books, Draco noticed, and many books that he assumed were muggle books because he did not recognise the titles. A snitch lay in a gap on the shelf, along with several other trinkets and small framed photographs. A photograph of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny caught his eye. It was taken, quite obviously, after a Quidditch match. They were in their Quidditch robes, bar Hermione of course, and Harry still held the snitch in his hand. Ron had his arm around Hermione, who was holding a ‘Go Gryffindor’ banner, and Ginny was on Potters back grinning hugely as she messed his hair. It was a sickeningly sweet photograph, Draco thought, but he would have given anything to have had friends like that.
“Shall I get us some drinks, Potter?” Malfoy asked, whipping off his charmed snake cloak in one swift movement.
“I can take anything you deal to me, Potter.” He smirked, egging Harry on. So much for this being a friendly match – this was going to be fiercely competitive bout.
“Ah. You know him?”
Harry nodded; he didn’t really know what to say. He had never really intended to spend much social time with Malfoy, they were simply partners - forced together because of their performances during their Auror training. They had very little in common, besides years of animosity, and shared very few of the same interests, aside from quidditch - which had usually been something they competed in.
He wanted to live with Draco, not just share a bed with him for a few nights then move to a different room. He wanted to experience everything with him, together, as a couple. Harry figured that that included picking furniture together and having their own things.
“Oh… Oh my god,” Draco whimpered into the duvet, gripping the material with his fists and bucking back into Harry's face.
Harry waited with anticipation. The sorting ceremony had finished, and the excited first years now sat happily in their houses. He saw several shocked faces glancing at him every now and then, the words ‘Harry Potter’ on their lips. This made him feel uncomfortable. The actions of his childhood had caused everyone to have very high expectations of him: expectations that he was always worried he would not fulfil. For now, though, he would just entertain the new amazed first years as best he could.
Harry looked at his naked form in the mirror. While his hair hid the scar on his forehead, nothing could hide the scar from Umbridge that still marred the back of his hand. Even more blatant though, and unmissable if he was topless, was the scar in the very centre of his chest. Shaped just like the scar on his forehead, but mangled and twenty times the size, it stood out against his tanned skin. He knew that being an Auror would result in an interesting collection of scars like Mad-Eye had, but he had never imagined that he would have two ‘Avada Kedavra’ scars on his body. He wore them with a twisted sense of pride - perhaps it was morbid to some people - but Harry’s sense of humour had been partly forged in the throes of war, and it sometimes showed.
Draco chuckled, and moved closer to Harry. He let himself pull Harry close and graze his neck with his lips, “I must be formidable indeed,” he kissed his neck slowly and felt Harry wind his arms around Draco's waist, “To make
Draco nodded. They walked into the living room and stood in the door way. The room hushed. Neville and Hannah were unphased by Draco’s presence – they had after all got used to Harry and Draco being constantly with each other. George and Ron looked up but were soon pulled into their conversation with Kreacher again, though they kept their debate quiet.
“Hey, I reckon you could do with updating your team, mate.” Ron laughed, and Draco thanked him.
“So, what's this case then?” he pointed briefly to the board and Draco sighed. It would only be their second case together, their last one - sorting out some unregistered animagi in tandem with the Animagus Registry - had taken forever for the newly qualified duo.
McGonagall leaned forwards eagerly in her chair, “Have a biscuit, Potter,” she pushed a plate towards him, “and tell me all about it.”
“Hi, yes I am, thank you.” He replied, his voice still raspy from sleep. He wasn’t okay though, he had been having another nightmare, this time about the final confrontation with Voldemort that had happened in the courtyard outside.
Harry felt a lump rising in his throat – Draco had been exceedingly nervous about spending Christmas at Grimmauld Place but this was the best reaction they both could have hoped for. The room resumed its lively conversations and everyone went back to relaxing with each other. Draco took a liberty and sat at the upright piano at the far end of the room and began to play a festive tune quietly. It matched the atmosphere perfectly. Harry sat with Molly and Arthur and beamed at them, his heart lighter than it had ever been. Within no time at all, Grimmauld place was full of life and laughter, and the void that filled the house two days before was completely gone.
Harry smirked, “I just thought that I’d rather come and disturb you while you got dressed,” Harry raised an eyebrow, “I had nothing better to do.” He added with a smile. Harry hovered near the desk, hands in pockets.
‘Why did I choose such a demanding job?’ He thought, ‘and with Potter, no less.’
“What the fuck happened?” He sobbed, “somebody please tell me.” His voice was sore from the shouting in the hallway, and no doubt the memory of seeing Harry being carried in Hagrid's arms just a few years prior. Harry couldn't die… it was impossible. It was all that was going through Ron's mind - Harry could NOT die.
Draco led Harry to the bar, his hand holding tightly onto Harry’s as if he was possibly going to run away, “I have to get my coat from the cloakroom,” he said, “then we’ll leave,” he turned away, wanting to be alone as soon as possible.
“Have you even looked at the latest case?” Draco huffed, running a hand through his loose blonde hair - a tell-tale sign of his stress.
Draco nodded and kissed him again, his pale hands taking ownership of Harry’s body, roaming up his back, across his chest, over his trousers. He nimbly unfastened Harry’s trousers and slipped a teasing hand under. He very clearly wasn’t going to wait and at this point, neither was Harry. Harry’s back arched as Draco teased the head of his cock over his underwear. Draco tore Harry’s shirt off, and pulled Harry even closer with a frustrated grunt. He wanted to feel Harry’s hot skin against his own. He tangled his hand in Harry’s hair and pulled hard, exposing his neck. Harry smiled at the feeling. Draco trailed kisses and bites down his neck, slowly working his way down to his shoulder and collar bone. Harry let out a moan – he loved it when Draco bit his collarbone.
He stroked Draco’s back for a moment or two and pushed him gently so that he was on his back. He nuzzled into him, his arm over Draco’s chest and his leg between Draco’s. He reached down to Draco’s black silk boxers and once again began to fondle him. Draco’s back arched as Harry teased his head with his forefinger and thumb. Harry nibbled gently at Draco’s neck, sucking every once in a while. He increased his grip as Draco’s hips thrust in time with his movements, keeping it intentionally slow. Draco let loose a guttural moan as Harry slowly sped up and felt him tense with the force of orgasm. Draco’s hands clawed in Harry’s back and on the bedsheets as he came all over Harry’s hand. Draco laid, breathless, and looked at the ceiling with a satisfied smile creeping up onto his face; Harry admired how his pale skin glowed in the candle light.
“Draco,” he shouted across to him, “I’m glad you could make it!” He pointed to the ground as a way of telling him to meet him there. Harry flew down to the ground, where the Quidditch chest was waiting to be opened. Draco joined him.
It had been some time since Harry had last seen Malfoy, and he was expecting things to be difficult. He had always said that he understood why Malfoy did the things he did, and was instrumental in making sure that Malfoy did not receive punishment for his actions, knowing full well that he was just as much of a victim as anyone else. Not that Malfoy knew that, of course.
The stands were bustling with people, all shouting and making noise. It hurt Harry's ears at first, but he found himself adjusting to it pretty quickly. Draco was thriving, the energy around him was tangible and infectious; Harry took moments here and there to marvel in his passion for the match, the exaggerated way that he contested the referee on penalties, and the closeness that he watched the players with. He gave Harry advice on which bets to place, having seen both the teams play before. Some of the players were incredibly talented, Harry couldn't take his eyes off one of them; a young woman, Dabrowski, who executed the most graceful of tactics with a kind of raw untrained power. When the referee pulled her up for something, Harry began shouting at him. In his eyes she hadn't done anything, and so he cupped his face as he began to spew his objections at the ref. It didn't help that he had a bet placed on her scoring three goals before the three hour mark hit.
Hi All!
“Right,” Harry looked back to the letter, “but there are other colours on there too.”
Harry chuckled to himself and hopped off the desk, wincing slightly, and began to pull on his clothes. Draco did the same, and watched Harry with loving eyes.
“Everything okay?” he asked sincerely, now looking at Harry. To hell with his own emotions, he thought.
Harry had wondered if it would be awkward after, but it felt natural and easy as he laid his head on Draco’s shoulder in a loose embrace.
Despite their teasing, Malfoy decided to join them.
He felt Malfoy look to the ceiling, his breath hitching in his chest, faltering with every exhale, “Something you like?” Harry teased.
“Harry!” Hannah smiled from behind the bar, “There’s a small room upstairs that you two can use, if you want?” Neville must have mentioned that they’d like to be away from crowds if possible. Harry nodded to her, and Malfoy headed up the stairs, eyes following him as he did.
“Right, well. You need to get dressed and I need to shower and change. Shall I meet you in the Hall for breakfast?” Draco smiled, once he had calmed down somewhat.
Malfoy nodded, “I think this proves that this was done by a squib.”
“Perhaps that’s all it is.” Harry noted.
Potter smiled, “Thank you for being there last night,” he stood next to Draco near the fireplace and put a hand on his shoulder, taking Draco by surprise, “It was bad again. I’m glad that someone was here.”
He spent the night in his office, in front of the fire place, cosying down. He often forgot how cold Grimmauld place could be, with its lofty rooms and grand furniture. He much preferred the soft, warm ambience of Hogwarts.
“Yeah, that’s the one,” Harry stumbled next to Draco, putting more weight on the wizard than he expected to, “How are you not as drunk as I am?”
Harry was shocked. While he and Malfoy were on talking terms, he had not expected to have him as friendly company any time soon.
“So how’s it going?” he was making a cocktail, and Harry couldn’t help but look at how the guy's body moved as he did. He felt himself roll his eyes, truth be told he shouldn’t have been looking at the bartender. It was wildly inappropriate.
“Yes, Kreacher, thank you,” Harry pulled on some gloves, and looked down at the elf smirking back at him, “Would you be more than willing to send me anything that I have probably forgotten?” He asked, knowing that this had happened every year since he started teaching at Hogwarts.
Draco rolled his eyes and took his feet from the foot stool. Pansy protested as he stood up and straightened his jacket in the mirror over the fireplace, “I think, if you two keep on ganging up on me, I’ll go home.” He looked at them over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
He had changed since Harry had seen him that morning. He was wearing a much more casual, though still suave outfit and Harry most certainly noticed. He still wore his black hooded cloak with a snake clasp, but underneath he wore the Slytherin green checked suit trousers and a grey pullover. Harry could see a grey collar peeking through the top of the jumper. Draco rolled his sleeves up and he joined Harry.
to kill Voldemort,” Harry’s eyes shot up, “You were not meant to have a normal life but nobody told you that. Of course that’s going to leave something behind.”
“So, how’re you doing mate?” Ron asked, taking a drink from the tray. Blaise frowned slightly at him - the drinks had been meant for Draco, but now everyone took them as they wished.
“Are the curtains in the Slytherin dorm green by any chance?” He asked the elf; Kreacher looked at him like he was a fool.
She settled a tea tray onto the coffee table and sighed, “You’ve been at my house for,” she checked her watch, “Three hours and you’ve done nothing but talk about Potter,” she sighed, “Are you finished?”
Draco cleared his throat, “You don’t have to pretend to be interested, Hermione.” He said, certain that she was merely being polite.
Malfoy nodded, though he was still eager to get on with work, “I guess.” He pulled his cloak over him and grabbed his things. Harry had left before Draco had even had a chance to aim a snarky comment his way.
“Well you better get over it hun, he’s coming over,” he subtly gave Harry space.
Potter wasn’t here. Draco found himself looking for him, perhaps as a reassurance, or just someone who understood his daily strife. Neville saw Draco, and greeted him with a warm smile. Draco walked up to the table, and took a seat next to Neville. His food appeared on a plate in front of him, and he gladly tucked in. His own house elf had joined him this year, and it made him happy to know that she was here with him.
There it was again, that light fluttery feeling in his chest. It made his blood pound, his heart beat faster.
Harry couldn’t help but wind his fingers through that silky blonde hair, but it took every ounce of restraint to not thrust further into Draco, to make him really feel his frustrations. Without making a sound, Draco began to work Harry with an expert technique.
p.s. I'm sorry.
“I would like companionship though,” Harry sighed, “I get lonely.” He hated how small and weak his voice was, but he didn’t mind being like that around Draco. Draco had seen him at his most vulnerable but had also seen him at his strongest, and yet to him he was just Harry – not Harry Potter: the boy who saved the world.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, groaning slightly, “It was kind of a disaster.”
He pulled the teacups from their spot in the cabinet and joined Hermione in the living room. She was sat cross legged in front of the fireplace, wrapping a decorative bow around an oddly shaped present. Harry joined her, moving scraps of paper from the rug so he’d have space.
“You could say that,” Harry gestured for a shot, and chugged it back in the blink of an eye, “we have a long, complicated history.”
When Draco felt Harry nod his head, he knew that he could start to move more. He began to thrust, slowly at first, to make sure that Harry was comfortable with it, then gradually faster. Harry seemed to lose all sense of control as Draco repeatedly hit his prostate.
“Shut up, Potter.” Draco said and pulled Harry into a kiss by the neck.
Pansy is worried, and the boys make a break in the case.
The sound of students filing out of classes could be heard in the corridor past the classroom, and Malfoy checked the clock on the wall. It seemed they still had some time to chat.
Molly beamed at Draco, “You’re part of our family now, young man, we’ll be damned if we don’t treat you that way.” George passed her a present and she added it to her own pile with a thanks. Though he couldn’t see it for himself, Neville and Hannah looked down at Draco with big smiles on their face – they really appreciated what he had done for Harry, and with the Essence of Tranquillity.
“That’s what Hermione said,” Harry smiled at the idea that Draco and Hermione could have anything in common, “she also said to give it time.” He sipped his tea – even this was far more upmarket than anything Harry had.
He wrapped himself up in his robes, took a deep breath and walked through to the Courtyard. He hoped that Draco would not take too long. His breath escaped him in small clouds of mist, it was freezing outside, he pulled his cloak tighter around him and buried his mouth into his scarf. He exhaled to warm himself up and tried to relax a bit. He sat reading the book that Hermione had bought him for Christmas – and as much as he didn’t necessarily want to admit it, he was finding it very interesting.
Pansy shot him a knowing glance and sat down on the settee, draping her legs over Draco’s lap, “If it was anyone else dear, I’d think you fancied them.” she said, matter-of-factly. Blaise looked at Pansy's bookshelf, running his finger along the spines of the books, clearly trying to seem uninterested in Draco's ranting. In truth, he'd got used to it in the dormitories at Hogwarts; Draco's speeches on Potter had dominated the conversation during their time there, more so from fifth year onwards. Blaise, Boyle and Crabbe had been very well versed on Potters movements through the years, they knew just as much about Harry as anyone else… if not more.
“Even if you’ve not written anything on it yet,” he waved the parchment in front of him as he spoke, and Harry watched him with a sense of interest - investigatory spells hadn’t been his forte during training, “There will still be some of your residual magic on it. Being around magic leaves a trace that is quite hard to get rid of.” He laid the parchment next to the letter and whispered the spell over it. Once again several coloured mists cascaded out of the tip of his wand and settled over the parchment. A silvery green line lingered over the spot where Draco had just been holding it, “there’s my magic - look,” he said, a reddish mist filled the page, “there’s you,” he explained as it settled, “and it looks like that’s it - just you and me on there.”
“Thank you, Kreacher. I’m sorry if I woke you.” Harry wrapped his hands appreciatively around the mug, and took a long sip. There was something so soothing about chocolate. It warmed him like nothing else.
When he got back to his room, candles now extinguished, he picked a random outfit for the day and got ready as quickly as he could. He checked himself in an ornate black and silver mirror and fretted slightly. Why was he so concerned with how he looked? Who was he trying to make a good impression for? He threw his snake cloak around him and charmed an aftershave to match his outfit, still wondering why he was going to an effort.
Morning all!
“Well the head of the DMLE, Quentin Redsoule, has taken all the credit for ‘disbanding neo-death eaters’ when Seamus and I did nearly all the bloody work.”
“I still get nightmares.” Harry said, plainly. It seemed that as they were talking in earnest now, and he thought that he had figured out why Malfoy had come to him – they had a shared experience that they could get off their chest.
“Shut up, you know I like it cold.” He faked a glare at Harry and smirked.
He had two days until he saw Draco for Christmas. The entirety of Harry’s family would be coming over: all the Weasleys, Ron and Hermione, Neville and Hannah, and of course Draco. It was Harry’s favourite time of the year and he wanted to make sure that the house was perfect for everyone.
“I have a map, my dad and his friends made it, it shows everyone in Hogwarts. You can see them move around and stuff, it’s really bloody handy.” Potter explained. Had that been how he always managed to sneak around? Draco wondered to himself.
Neville turned to Draco when he sat down and smiled, “Have you had a good afternoon, Draco?” a smirk crept up onto his face and he glanced at Draco’s neck.
When he grasped Draco in his hands, Draco let out a groan. He moved his hand rhythmically and Draco moved his hips in time with Harry’s pulses. Harry quickened his pace and Draco moaned with every movement. Draco tensed for a moment and then leaned down to kiss Harry on the chest, he moved further down. Harry’s hand left the sanctity of Draco’s boxers as Draco moved further down the bed.
Draco’s heart flipped: Potter had been speaking about him to his friends. He felt the faint flutter of butterflies in his stomach but he soon suppressed them, “Yes, well. I’ve been on the right track for quite some time, I’d just still been having a hard time with everything.” Draco explained.
“Neville seems to be okay,” Malfoy remarked, and Harry looked at him questioningly, “I just mean that he doesn’t seem to have any issues with the war like we do.”
When Harry came back to their office, Malfoy was standing over his desk working intensely on one of the letters. Mists of various colours came out of the end of Malfoy’s wand and washed over the surface of the parchment, each different colour highlighted something different on the letter and glowed vibrantly. Malfoy hummed slightly. The piles of Hogwarts records still dominated the floor, reminding Harry of the sheer volume of work they had to do.
“How are you not in Azkaban if you’ve cast an unforgivable?”
She smiled at him and uncrossed her arms, “I know, Potter,” her eyes twinkled knowingly, “Is there anything that I can do to help you?”
“Alright Neville,” he nodded towards him, “Can I just have a butterbeer please? How’re you doing Potter?” he smiled down at Harry and raised an eyebrow.
Draco laid awake in bed, as he usually did, thinking about his conversation with Potter a few days ago. He had intended to get around to being on speaking terms with Potter, to make life easier working at Hogwarts, but he had not anticipated just how much of a similar life they had come to have. Draco’s parents had been imprisoned in Azkaban, leaving the Manor cold and empty. Draco had cut ties with any of his Slytherin classmates in an effort to put the past behind him and so he had found himself quite isolated - though not as self-ostracised as Potter had found himself. He had enjoyed Potters company, it had been easy, stress free and natural to just talk now that he did not have the threats of Voldemort or his Father hanging over him. He could do as he pleased, and more often than not now, he wanted to be a better person.
They somehow had stumbled back to the castle, the air between them charged and ready to snap at any second. Harry could barely restrain himself as they tripped their way into the corridors. They had to have a modicum of control – students were milling around now and they had to be ‘normal’. They walked, not touching, through the main corridor and it seemed that within a few minutes they had to actually act as if they were in charge. Students approached them and asked about things, or they had to dish out the discipline to unruly kids.
He reached a certain point in the grounds and saw Harry already flying around the practice pitch. He mounted his broom and flew towards Harry.
Draco chuckled, “this is… this is exactly what I expected,” his mouth found Harry's neck, and in one swift, licentious move, licked a stripe from his collar bone to his ear and began sucking just below his ear lobe.
With his other hand, Harry held Draco tight to him, stopping him from moving while he completely took over. He thrust hard and fast, desperate now to finish what had started in the club, to get what he wanted, to release his frustrations.
“You broke into Gringotts?” A Ravenclaw pondered quietly to herself, Harry was sure that she meant to do it under her breath. He shot her a mischievous smile and nodded.
Harry took Draco’s hand, and ran to open the door. As they stepped inside, they saw just how quaint the little houses were. They walked straight into a small living room, complete with fireplace and floor to ceiling bookcases and desks for them to work at, there was an archway to a small kitchen and dining room. A spiral staircase lead to the bedroom and bathroom. Draco climbed the stairs and smiled to himself when he saw the bedroom. It had the same bed as the dormitories had, just a double version, and there was enough space for both of their trunks to stack next to the wardrobe – indeed Harry’s already stood there. Small bedside tables sat on either side of the bed, above them were candles mounted on the wall, and picture hooks sat near them. Draco walked over to the window and drew the curtains – they faced out the back of the house. It was just possible to see the Quidditch pitch – Harry would love that.
“We do have…” he cut himself off as Draco’s tongue teased his neck again, “We do have a house… we could go to…” he managed to pant out.
“I think that sounds like a wonderful idea,” Draco sighed, “the sooner I go pack, the sooner we can get to celebrating.” He looked at Harry through lidded eyes and nodded slightly.
He heard someone coming up the stairs and was confronted by his faithful shop keeper, Nancy, “Oh,” she said, “it’s you. Why aren’t you at the school?” She asked. Draco looked at her and smiled briefly, she had clearly had a busy day. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows, her hair had hastily been tied up and she looked exhausted.
“Bottoms up lads.” Neville smiled, looking from Harry to Draco.
Draco seemed to relax a bit more, though he was still uncomfortable with the heat in the room. He took his tie off completely and undid a button or two on his crisp white shirt. He finally took a drink from the tray and cleared half the glass in one. They sat in silence for a little bit working their way through the firewhiskey. Every now and again, Harry felt Draco’s eyes on him – either in a quick glance, or a longer stare. It unsettled him slightly. Was Draco looking at him because he’s ‘Harry Potter’, or because he’s a friend?
“Are you ready?” He asked, his voice breathless and low; dripping with sex.
“Well, you don’t have to see her again,” Draco said as he flicked the lid back onto the kettle, “you don’t need a partner to be happy.”
After he had met the excited first years, caught up with his continuing students and bid goodnight to his colleagues, Harry wondered back through the familiar corridors back to his office. The restoration of Hogwarts after the Battle was impeccable. Even Harry, who had been the cause of all the damage, could not tell that the castle had been left practically in ruins. He strolled, hands in his pockets, through the building, musing over every tiny detail and memory that were tucked around every corner.
“Of course, Master.” The elf bowed.
It was raining outside, so Draco cast an Impervious Charm across them both, and they walked contentedly through the grounds of Hogwarts. The leaves had almost completely fallen off the trees now, they piled up on the sides of the pathway, lining the way for him and Potter. The rain made the grounds seem impossibly serene, and empty, Draco was sure that he’d never seen the grounds so bare in his life. They walked, through this serenity, towards Hogsmeade.
“You want to…” he raised his eyebrows as Draco smirked at him, “Here?” Harry was reluctant to admit to himself that the thought of having sex in such a public space excited him a bit – perhaps more than it should have done.
Blaise looked down at Neville as he said this, “I’m sober,” he stated, “I’ll apparate you home and I’ll come back as quick as I can,” he and Neville stood up, though Blaise supported most of Neville's weight, “Pans, will you take over while I sort him out please?” he asked.
Wassup wassup, I hope you enjoy this chapter! It was originally two chapters, but honestly, the first part is kinda short so I squished them together <3
Draco turned to look at him and smiled, “I am, thank you.” He placed a tender kiss on Harry’s head and held Harry closer.
The kettle whistled, and Draco poured the tea with a wave of his wand. Harry pulled a cup towards him and cradled it in his hands, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, grateful for the friend he had found in an old enemy.
Harry sighed, he hated being teased, “Oh god, I want you, Draco,” he panted, and backed his hips into Draco’s hand, unable to resist the feeling, “god I fucking want you.”
“Oh, call me Molly; please.” She said and everyone laughed. Draco nodded, and went over to shake Arthur’s hand. Arthur raised his eyebrow and pulled Draco into a tight hug.  Draco took a deep breath when he was released from Mr Weasleys grasp and sat back down next to Harry.
Harry chewed his lip – maybe he’d done the wrong thing? “Yes?” he said tentatively, “Only while we’re at Hogwarts, there’s no obligation to move anywhere together permanently” he added quickly.
“I try to stay out of things now,” Harry said, extending a hand as a peace offering between the two, “but I’m glad to see that you’re here to keep me in check.”
“Shall we open presents now?” Her eyes were bright and she flashed brief smile at Draco.
“Is it a pyjama party downstairs?”
Draco shook his head and held Harry tighter, “But I’m warm and you’re naked and I’m pretty sure I’m in heaven right now.”
“What went wrong?” Draco asked, producing a beautiful vintage tea set from a cabinet on the wall and placing it on the desk.
, and not worry about public image or holding himself to the expectations that the media placed on him. The only room that had not been renovated was Sirius’; Harry couldn’t bear changing it, and so it sat, cleaned up but very much the same.
On Sunday morning, Draco woke early. Harry’s trial of the potion had been on his mind all night and he found himself, ironically, unable to sleep. It was breakfast time, and Draco lingered outside the Hall for a second or two. He fiddled with the sleeve of his Slytherin jumper and took a deep breath, wondering whether he would be confronted with a Harry who had slept well, or the usual exhausted but still chipper Harry. Just because the potion had been successful for Draco, it didn’t mean that it would work for Harry who had far more severe problems than that of himself.
Draco has some news; the boys begin their interviews.
Hermione put a consoling arm around Ron, her worry tangible on her tear soaked face, “can someone please explain to us what's happening?” she tried her hardest to maintain her composure, but it was beginning to crack. Her mind, like Ron's, was taken back to the battle of Hogwarts, and seeing Harry dead in front of her.
Harry raised an eyebrow in response - silently asking Malfoy to explain himself. Before Harry could open his mouth, Malfoy moved like lightening to Harry’s desk and grabbed a piece of parchment.
“It’s just not on ‘Mione,” Ron complained, snapping Harry out of his wondering, “We’ve been working so bloody hard and yet he get’s all the credit.” Ron huffed loudly and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Hey hey, this was supposed to be two chapters, again, but they were both short so I mushed them together!
Malfoy leaned forwards in his chair, looking at Harry intensely, “You were uniquely affected though, you were
“How’s Hannah?” Harry asked, he noticed that she wasn’t in the pub today.
It had been a few days since Draco had given Harry his specially formulated potion. Both he and Harry had been exceedingly busy during the week so far and so they hadn’t had time to see each other properly. Draco felt the stirrings of a feeling that he wasn’t too familiar with; perhaps he missed Harry’s company. He sat in his office after a day’s teaching and sighed. He did not quite know what to do with himself. He had marked his students work – they had done surprisingly well at the Draught of Living Death and he really wanted to push them next lesson. He had made sure that the potions cabinet was still well stocked, he had tidied his already tidy room, and there he now sat: restless, and agitated. He looked to his book shelf and sighed, none of these titles would satisfy him. He eyed his broom, but it could not entertain him tonight. He looked at his chess set, but he had no one to share the game with. After some time deliberating, he decided to go to the Three Broomsticks – at least Neville would be there for some company. Perhaps he would sit alone, to really test how far he had come since being back at Hogwarts. Maybe he could relax and appreciate his own company.
