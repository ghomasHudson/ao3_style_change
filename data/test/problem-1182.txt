Harry blinked for a moment in the light of the pub, taking the opportunity to look around the room as he and Malfoy took off their coats. Several people were fingering cigarettes idly, and the smoke made the room slightly hazy. There was a strong but not-unpleasant smell of beer in the air, and the wooden tables and bright fireplace created a warm, comfy feel to the room. Harry wondered what had attracted Malfoy to this pub – he normally gravitated to posher bars where hipsters wore suits and drank fancy gins.
“I’ll have to double check, but I believe your map coincides with the territorial markings of the Northumberland pack, although there hasn’t been communication with them since before Voldemort’s time – Lupin couldn’t get in contact with them when he was underground.”
He made himself breakfast (eggs and bacon) for the first time in what felt like ages, musing on what to do with his afternoon. Savage had, unwillingly, given him and Malfoy the rest of the week off, meaning he had a four day weekend instead of two. Savage rarely gave permission days off, even for Harry Potter, the Chosen One – only Shacklebolt’s insistence had persuaded her.
There was a silence. None of Hermione’s notes had instructed them what to do when offered unsettlingly canny observations about themselves. Finally, Malfoy spoke, apparently having got over his fear.
It didn’t take long for Malfoy to fall asleep, comfortable in his own bed, comfortable sharing it with someone else, but it took Harry longer. He watched Malfoy’s peaceful, sleeping form for quite some time before sleep claimed him.
“So what happens if someone somehow claims all three?” Malfoy mused, fascinated. He didn’t seem concerned that Harry had kept this secret for all three years of their partnership so far, or perhaps he was going to pounce once he’d learnt all he could.
Harry didn’t reply, instead choosing to blast Malfoy with the shower head, already laughing even before Malfoy let out a shriek of horror.
Hope you're enjoying the story! One more chapter to go :) Leave a comment and let me know what you liked. And feel free to ask for one-shot ideas, I'd love to give them a go
“Yeah, I always do, you know that.” He did – Hermione had forced him the first year, saying somehow both sarcastically and earnestly that the great Harry Potter attending such an event would go a long way to repair relations after the war. He’d grumbled, but it had been so much fun that he promised to go every year.
“Bloody hell, Neville, I thought you were coming tomorrow? You scared the shit out of me!” Harry cried, feeling embarrassed and relieved as the red glare around his fists quickly faded. Neville, taller and broader than Harry now, blushed wine-red, seemingly unaware of how lethal Harry’s curse would have been, or even that he’d been about to cast one at all.
Harry rolled his eyes and kissed his boyfriend squarely on the lips before knocking on Ron and Hermione’s front door.
“Do you want it to be a date?” Her gaze, somehow, got sharper, and Harry wriggled uncomfortably under the microscope of her stare.
Harry moved on, and noticed Ron’s inelegant form slouched against a tree, eating an apple. He looked totally unrecognisable as the famous war hero, with his nondescript brown hair and a birthmark scrawled across his cheek.
“These are all Hogwarts students?” Gobsmacked, Ron poked his envelope with dismay, looking as though it might combust spontaneously. Harry viewed his own package with similar suspicion.
“I agree. Potter and I can work tomorrow – we’ll look at matching the dates, and then try and work out who has had access to Susan.”
The two wizards were still sat quietly, perhaps three or four hours later, when Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly, and Malfoy sighed, putting down his quill.
Again, Harry was at a loss for words. It didn’t matter whether he wanted it to be a date (which was a conversation he didn’t really fancy having, with himself or anybody else) because it wasn’t a date.
It was going to be a magical day. The day of Ginny and Luna’s wedding had finally arrived, and nobody knew quite what to expect – both women had been very tight-lipped about the details. Ron was Ginny’s Best Man, and Harry was Luna’s. Hermione was Maid of Honour for both, and so she had recruited Malfoy as a helping hand or, as Luna put it, Secondary Maid duties.
“Why the hell are you so fucking secretive?” Malfoy was furious all of a sudden, his deliberate coldness and calm deteriorated in an instant.
Having come dressed in muggle clothes this time, he set off towards the village, bracing himself against the chilled spring winds. He thought about casting a warming charm, but was unwilling to use magic when he wasn’t sure it wouldn’t be noticed.
“Harry!” Hermione cried out from behind him, voice shrill with shock, quickly followed by Ron’s shout.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry! Nothing’s a good event until there’s been some drama. Besides, it’ll be a relief not to hear Malfoy moon about you anymore.”
“That’s not the point, Malfoy! I know we couldn’t have saved her life but we could have saved her from this!” Harry gestured wildly to her body lying in the murky ditch water and, to his horror, burst into tears. Embarrassed, he wiped his tears away angrily, refusing to look at Malfoy. Hermione and Ron had drawn away to contact forensics, and to give them some much needed space.
When Harry woke, he was still dressed in his clothes from yesterday, surrounded by piles of newspapers and red string. He didn’t have the energy to tidy up or shower, and certainly not to cook, and so he sat on his sofa, mindlessly watching a cooking show on his TV.
“All those times I was so awful to you…I always thought…you know, the Chosen One, you’d have grown up being told how brilliant and special you were.”
“Yeah. I love Malfoy, and I want a family, but we’ve never talked about this. What if he doesn’t want kids?”
“Actually, that’s not a bad idea, we can have a look around. I’ll come with.” Malfoy followed, pulling on his cloak.
“Oh, look, Neville’s arrived!” Luna swanned off to greet Neville and Calliope, and Ginny watched after her with a fond smile.
“I know.” Malfoy replied smugly, laughing a little as Harry slapped the back of his head lightly in response.
After the war, Luna had invented magical tattoos, and had also pioneered a new style of therapeutic healing, which incidentally often used her tattoos. Harry himself had three of her tattoos, and he knew Luna had gifted Hermione and Ron matching ones that glowed when they were together for their wedding present. Luna’s non-therapeutic tattoos were famous around the world, and she always had an entertaining story about her work.
“Hermione is great, isn’t she?” Harry noticed that Ron had detached himself from the group and was watching Harry talk to Francoise.
“I’m the master of the Elder Wand.” He didn’t know what else to say – how to explain the terror he felt every single day that he’d get disarmed, that he would condemn the world by being weak; how to describe his nightmares about seeing someone use the Wand to carry out unspeakable acts.
Harry was surprised – this invitation was new. Malfoy had never offered before, and Harry had never asked, instead seeing Pansy in his own time. She, too, occasionally stayed in his guest room if Blaise was still out of the country when she returned.
“Of course, as though anything could stop Granger working!” Blaise replied before Harry could, and everybody laughed. The laughter wasn’t unkind, though, as it would have been in school – instead, it was friendly, even admiring. They saw what Hermione was trying to achieve, and they respected her for it.
“I’m not. I’m not sorry.” In for a dime, in for a dollar, Harry figured. Things would be awkward at work now anyway, no harm in making it worse.
The sound of the muggle curse coming out of Malfoy’s pureblood lips, and the irony that it was Christ he’d chosen, made Harry smile, and then, uncontrollably, he laughed. Either Malfoy understood the joke, or Harry’s laugh was contagious, because Malfoy started to laugh too, and they stood there, laughing, in front of the war portrait until they heard Seamus’ magically magnified voice rattling through the maze, starting the auction.
“Alright, I’m off for the weekend.” Harry stood and headed to the door, pausing in the doorway as he pulled on his robes. “You going to the art gala tomorrow?”
“Sorry I interrupted earlier, Harry, but we needed Draco to give his speech. He was Best Man and Man of Honour, you know.”
Knowing what he did about Malfoy’s bad history with Greyback, Harry couldn’t help watching him carefully through lowered eyelashes, searching for glimpses of the vulnerability he’d seen last week. He wasn’t disappointed – Malfoy’s pale skin was more snow than marble, and his fingers, wrapped tightly around his wand, were trembling.
To the right of Harry, was the rest of the DA and the Order, more jubilant than those on Harry’s other side – relieved the war was won, they hugged and checked each other for injuries. Lavender was slumped, bleeding, on the ground, being tended to by the Patil twins, but there was a faint smile on her face, like she was glad to be alive. Behind them, shackled with silver chains, was Malfoy’s frail figure, face pale and miserable, and his mother beside him, statuesque, and the other surviving members of the other side.
“That’s… a lot of blood.” Malfoy pointed out, gesturing to dark patches on the stone floor and brick wall.
Harry sat back down. Malfoy was upset about the lie, clearly, and the best thing to do was sit it out.
“You’re looking distracted, Harry. Are the nargles disturbing you? I can make you a tonic, if you'd like.”
The theme was always a surprise – the invitation always said roughly to dress in elegant, fancy muggle clothes and come prepared for anything. The event this year was set for Friday 19th, just over a week away.
This time Harry woke in his own bed, and Malfoy was still lying there beside him, sleeping softly. Harry smiled and moved to kiss him gently on the forehead before getting out of bed to shower.
Bellchant left the coffee shop with a small bag of pastries and two cups of coffee and made a beeline towards Scratch. Harry held his breath – would Scratch be able to keep his cool and continue playing his role? The plan relied on it.
“Do you know why I always have so much stuff nowadays? I wasn’t allowed to own anything with my muggle relatives. I had to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, actually.”
“Yeah, yeah, all good. Just surprised me, is all.” It was a bold-faced lie and they both knew it – Harry always expected paparazzi – but Dean didn’t call him out, instead slapping him on the shoulder cheerily and turning away.
“When did you first realise you liked me?” Harry asked, wondering privately when he’d first started to like Malfoy, even though he hadn’t realised it.
So it was with tremendous relief that Harry saw Herman Bellchant stroll casually out of a side alley into the courtyard, dressed smartly in a suit, headed towards a chain coffee shop. Harry watched Bellchant take note of Scratch, sat slumped against a tree, rattling a cup of change – to an untrained eye, he looked like any other homeless man, but as he called out, his lips split to reveal crooked, sharp teeth, and his uncut nails clicked against the side of the cup.
“Hermione’s convinced you’re just being difficult, but I actually think you don’t have a clue.” Ron said, watching Harry watching Malfoy. “I don’t think you know you’re in love with him.”
“That’s very unwise. Their alpha is a nasty piece of work. But you wouldn’t ask if you had any other options, I’m sure, so I’ll tell you if you promise to be careful.”
The Howler burnt up and fell to the table as a pile of ashes, which Harry quickly flicked away with a gesture. Malfoy, having started out amused, was now audibly laughing as Harry scrawled out a quick explanation to Ron.
“Like wife, like husband, I suppose it shouldn’t be a surprise.” Malfoy said, but he was half-smiling as he bent over the book. Harry curled his head in beside him and flushed as he could feel the warmth of Malfoy’s breath against his cheek – it felt strangely intimate and almost uncomfortable, although Harry couldn’t work out why.
“Merlin, Potter, give it a minute, we’ve only just got here!” He threw himself into the seat opposite Harry, adding “wish you were this keen to work at the office.”
Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and spun around, coming face to face with Connor Johnson. He felt his heart twist and he forced a smile.
Molly looked like she was about to burst into tears, and so Harry and Ron stepped forward, carefully untangling Malfoy from her grips and leading her back to her seat at the front of the hall.
“I’ve met Draco several times in the past, and I was introduced to Hermione Granger just a few minutes ago.”
He crouched there in front of Harry as they both breathed heavily. He realised he’d seen the moment Harry had refused to talk about for six years – the moment he’d died. He thought about apologising, but before he could, Harry asked what he’d seen. Ron remembered that Harry didn’t always see what the Legilimens saw – he truly had no skill at this whatsoever.
“It’s charmed with the same spells on the ceiling of the Great Hall at Hogwarts.” Dean said, proud of his find, and Harry saw it in a different light – the dark blues of the sky and the shimmering silver of stars would be gone in the morning, replaced with the burning oranges and pale blues of dawn.
“You know what we have to do next, don’t you?” Harry didn’t say it like a question, but Malfoy answered anyway.
“Just waiting for the right partner.” Harry smiled back at Malfoy, who held out his hand. Harry took it, but Malfoy didn’t lead him anywhere. Instead, they embraced where they stood, swaying in time to the music.
“Oh, sorry! I spoke to McGonagall and she sent me the files of everybody who studied at Hogwarts in the last thirty years.”
Ron finished serving up, jokingly telling everyone “Don’t worry, this is all me, Hermione just watched!” Everyone laughed as Hermione, blushing and smiling, slapped his arm gently.
Harry looked around, recognising several co-workers and colleagues from the Ministry, wondering vaguely where Malfoy was. He said he’d be there early, so presumably he was lurking somewhere.
“Well, either way our clothes will fit in well.” Hermione replied, already getting up to go and get it, keen to show Harry, or perhaps just keen not to exclude him on account of their relationship.
“He’s an arrogant twat, but he’s good enough in bed. Couldn’t stand talking to him, though, so obviously it didn’t work out.”
“Well, we’d better get going, we don’t want to be late.” Hermione held out her hands to her boys and spun them away.
Harry sat silently eating his breakfast for some time, thinking of Hermione and Ron – he’d been delighted when they’d gotten married, and he was just as delighted now that they were expecting. But he couldn’t help feeling down in some way – they were becoming parents, and he was still living the same life he’d been living for years. He wondered if he would spend the rest of his life as a single, lonely man who hunted bad people for a living. He hadn’t dated anyone seriously since he and Ginny had broken up five years ago – she’d wanted to start her career without any distractions or complications, and he had no longer been in love with her, so it had been an easy break up. And now he wondered if it had been a mistake to reject the various offers he’d had since then.
“Hang on….Is that us?” Harry leaned forward to see the framed photograph on Malfoy’s bedside table, amused and secretly delighted to see it was the photo of them that Malfoy had bought at Dean and Seamus’ gala. “So that’s why you wanted that piece so badly.”
Harry twisted in his arms, kissed him on the lips, revelling that he could. He still couldn’t believe he’d gone from having no idea he wanted to kiss Malfoy, to always wanting to in such a short space of time.
“Jesus Christ.” Hermione whispered as she stared down into the ditch, carefully pushing several bramble bushes out of the way to reveal Cressida Boone’s dead and decaying body.
Malfoy quickly returned with two pints of beer and looked in mock horror at the notes Harry was laying out.
As the room erupted into conversation, Harry found himself watching Malfoy, his usually solemn face curved into a soft smile. His eyes were bright as they sought out Harry’s, and they both sat, frozen amidst the cheerful chaos, as they stared at each other across the room. Harry couldn’t decode the look on Malfoy’s face, and felt something confusing stirring deep inside himself. Blinking, he turned away abruptly, accidentally catching Hermione’s eye, frowning as she raised a questioning eyebrow at him before turning to talk to Ron quietly.
At that same exact moment, back in the Ministry building in London, Hermione’s assistant submitted a report, under a fake name, reporting werewolf activity in the small town of Caster-on-Sea – one of Fenrir Greyback’s remaining acolytes had been sighted and would be retrieved later that day.
“Ugh. There’s a used condom in the wastepaper bin. Looks recent – must have been here in the last twenty-four hours or so.” Harry grimaced. “So we know she was having a sexual, and perhaps romantic, relationship with someone. And we can guess by the condoms that it’s a man, although there’s no significant other listed in her file.”
He knew he was meeting Malfoy later that day, to write the first draft of their report for Savage, and, he supposed, to have a drink. It felt strange, the thought that he and Malfoy would drink alone, as they rarely spent time together, alone, outside of work. In fact, now he was thinking about it, he wasn’t sure if he’d ever spent time with just Malfoy when work wasn't involved.
“Wow, my baby sister, engaged! Can you believe it?” Ron was delighted, grinning widely. Harry agreed cheerfully, starting to pour out white wine into half the glasses as Ron did the same with red into the other half.
Usually Malfoy was as relaxed and amused as Harry was about the out-bidding, but that didn’t seem to be the case this evening. As Harry outbid Malfoy for the fourth time over the photographs, and Malfoy’s lips turned down for a moment, Harry realised perhaps Malfoy was more emotionally invested in the photographs than he’d thought.
“Hermione’s right – causing a scene will let the person behind everything know we’re onto them. We have the upper hand at the moment, and we have to keep it that way.”
“Yes. I’m dreaming that I’m killing people. I’m afraid.” He knew he couldn’t tell her about the Elder Wand, of course, but anything else was fair game.
“Careful though, Ron, or you’ll end up with a whole Quidditch team!” Ginny snorted at the look of horror on both Ron and Hermione’s face.
“Don’t worry, Harry, I’m staying with Calliope tonight – flat’s all yours again.” Neville winked at Harry and walked through the fire with Calliope.
“Ah, go on, mate. Hermione’s been nagging me to eat more healthy crap, but if you’re eating some, she won’t mind.”
Malfoy said nothing. Harry would have been concerned at his lack of a response, but he could barely think straight enough to be careful of his aching hand, let alone decipher Malfoy.
“I guess we’ve worked out roughly where the pack is, then.” Harry said, looking down at the map. He then turned to the newspaper clippings Malfoy was flicking through.
Amused that Hermione thought she’d ever get Ron to stop eating constantly, Harry took a handful of crisps and started to munch on them. He felt something stir at the thought of having somebody to nag him about his eating habits, but he forgot about it when Hermione appeared in the living room, towelling her hair. She looked surprised, then pleased, to see him sat on their sofa.
Ron’s skills were rudimentary – he could divine particular memories if the subject was willing, as Harry was, but he couldn’t block out other, more present, memories. If Harry had been less distraught, he might have been concerned about what Ron might see.
Harry wasn’t convinced – his working relationship with Malfoy was pleasant and even friendly – he thought that bringing up memories of the war would only confuse things.
“Obviously not, Potter – he chose to be a wizard first and a werewolf second. These werewolves willingly live in the wild, as a pack… some of them don’t even have wands.” Malfoy replied, head tilted slightly as he watched Harry, clearly tired of biting his tongue. Harry could feel the heat of his stare and was psyching himself up to explain to Malfoy why he no longer used a wand.
“And both bedside tables are used.” Malfoy slicked his finger across the left table, showing Harry the lack of dust. He pulled open the drawers and gingerly held up a pack of condoms, eyebrow raised as he met Harry’s gaze. Harry felt himself flushing inexplicably as he poked around. There was surely something inappropriate in the way Malfoy had held out the condoms to him, suggestively, Harry felt, but he couldn’t bring himself to vocalise that thought.
“Aye, we did. Very nice lady she is.” A lanky, dark haired man popped his head out from the kitchen to chime in.
“That’s different. I had to know you could be trusted.” Even as he said it, Harry realised it was a mistake. Malfoy’s pale cheeks reddened and his voice almost squeaked as he fought to keep it low and even.
“I reckon it’s safe to light a Lumos or two, don’t you?” Ron lit his wand up. Malfoy and Hermione quickly followed suit as Harry patted his back pocket, reassured that his wand was still there after his tumble. The Elder Wand was tucked up his sleeve, as always.
Malfoy was still distracted by the menu, and so Harry thought fast, recalling the picture of the almost middle-aged dark haired woman in the case file.
“They always lie about me, Malfoy. I literally can’t go a week without reading some bullshit story about me.”
“Bellchant doesn’t care about blood purity, Harry, or at least it isn’t his priority – he seems uniquely focused on magical creatures, like werewolves.”
“If everyone could stand in two groups and face me…” He said, and everybody obeyed, each privately thinking, where is this going? Pansy and Blaise’s parties were infamous for their crazy invented games.
Slowly, cautiously, hoping and praying and fearing what might happen next, Harry pulled out the Elder wand from his sleeve holster and placed it on the table. Next to it, he placed his own wand from Ollivander. Malfoy looked almost shocked – wizards used only one wand, unless it was broken or lost in combat. Harry waited for Malfoy’s questions as they stared down at the wands.
“To making the world a better place.” Harry said, thinking of the case they’d closed and the awful man they’d put behind bars.
“Ha, great idea! Won’t matter if you’re drunk or not, she’ll reject it anyway!” Ron, who had more than a slight dislike for his old boss, chuckled away even as Hermione frowned at the thought of work being done badly. But she’d heard years of complaints from Harry and Ron to know that Ron was right – Savage had once famously turned down something Hermione had written for Ron, and Hermione had been furious.
“Harry, those bits aren’t bad. They might be messy, but they’re not bad - everything you did, and still do, is for the good of other people. Don’t you want him to know that?”
Harry hit the ground with a thump, rolling onto his stomach with a groan just in time for Malfoy to land on top of him. Both men threw themselves apart with grunts of embarrassment as Hermione fell to the floor, stomach shielded by Ron. They all picked themselves up, brushing dirt and dust as they took in their surroundings.
As always, Pansy talked a mile a minute, barely letting Harry get a word in edgeways; she reminded him of Hermione in this respect. There had been a strange day soon after the war, after both girls had joined the ministry, where they’d had to work together, along with the Aurors. Both Ron and Harry had been gobsmacked to see them getting on well, until it had suddenly clicked – both girls valued information and knowledge (although Hermione preferred facts and Pansy favoured gossip) and both girls would do anything to get what they wanted. Hermione and Pansy were highly intelligent, determined and fierce. It was no wonder Hermione and Pansy were so close.
“We obviously can’t arrest her in front of everybody – it will upset Dean and Seamus, and besides, she probably isn’t aware of anything, so she’ll cause a scene, which will make the Ministry look bad, and it’ll traumatise Susan.”
Malfoy had sounded perhaps a little upset, but Harry was angry now – it was one thing to read the newspaper that had it out for Harry, but to read it and believe it? Unacceptable, and incredibly hurtful.
“I’ll deal with it, Ron! Leave it.” Harry shook his left hand distractedly, and drops of blood smeared the floor.
“The Wand, the Stone, the Cloak a few years ago. You didn’t even tell me you’d died, Potter! That seems like the sort of thing you might have mentioned once or twice, don’t you think?”
“Oh, all that crap again, is it?” He grumbled, adjusting himself in his chair. “Why can’t you lot just leave me alone? I’ve not done anything to harm no-one, so can’t you lot just bugger off?”
“Celebrations, apparently. Pansy says here to think of fireworks, balloons and streamers. Dress code is the same as always, though.”
Malfoy reassured her they’d be calm and collected, and they turned to apparate to outside the forest.
Harry raised his fists to push Ron away from him, pissed, but as he did, he took a deep breath and froze still. The scent of citrus surrounded him – Malfoy. Malfoy’s arms were wrapped tight around Harry, holding him against the warmth of his chest. Harry found himself relaxing into Malfoy’s arms, resting his forehead against his shoulder, shaking with adrenaline.
“I always keep a spare set of clothes here, Potter. I like to be prepared for anything.” Malfoy replied primly. “And besides, the techs will probably need help setting up the potions and charms, and I’m best qualified for that.”
They caught each other’s eye and, without speaking, both knew they’d decided not to remove their glamours – if Jeremiah was this unpleasant to any random government official who came visiting, it wasn’t worth finding out what he’d do to the man who was partly responsible for his sister’s trauma and mental breakdown which resulted in a permanent place at St Mungo’s.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, remembering all the emotions that he’d felt in the moments after killing Voldemort – he’d felt so tired, and hollow, and alone, and so fucking afraid.
“That level of torture…” Malfoy hesitated. “It wasn’t just for information – Susan wasn’t an Auror, she wasn’t trained to resist torture, she would have cracked long before he needed to cut out her eye.”
Both Harry and his partner shuddered at the thought of Dorothea Savage, who had been aptly named at birth – at perhaps seventy years old, she was the still-ruthless Head Auror that had first paired them up three years ago after several failed partnerships each. She seemed totally uncaring of Harry’s fame and Malfoy’s old reputation, and treated both of them with a barely concealed impatience for their friendly bickering and the rebellious streak that ran, mile-wide, through both of them.
Now they walked, Malfoy’s wand out surreptitiously, up and down the alley, carefully searching for any signs of magic – as Junior Aurors they’d learnt that every individual had a specific brand of magic, so to speak – it could be marked and traced and used as a way of identifying criminals.
“Mr Umbridge, we’d like to ask you about some of your public statements about werewolves.” Harry spoke calmly and carefully, watching Jeremiah’s hands, waiting to see if he’d twitch, go for his wand. He didn’t reach for anything, but he tensed, leaning forward in his chair.
“What’s the case?” Harry asked eagerly, keen to take a break from the endless paperwork he had on his desk. Malfoy didn’t reply, instead reaching into a drawer and pulling out an old file, memo still clasped between his long fingers. Harry sighed impatiently and twitched the fingers of his right hand, which shot the memo across the room towards him, garnering him a frown from Malfoy.
Harry didn’t know what to say – he’d always known Lucius Malfoy was a bastard, of course, but he hadn’t realised how awful he’d been even to his own family. He didn’t know if he’d be allowed to call Malfoy’s father a bad name, though, or if that would be a step too far. Instead he decided to share something personal about himself, so Malfoy didn’t regret telling him.
Malfoy was sat on the sofa, reading a newspaper. Harry saw with dismay it was the Daily Prophet – Harry’s nemesis. He’d actually campaigned for it to get shut down several years ago, but he’d had no luck. He hadn’t realised Malfoy read it, although perhaps he did it just for fun, the way Ginny and Luna did.
“Malfoy. You’re in love with Malfoy.” And suddenly everything made sense. A bolt of electricity shot through him.
“I don’t know why Pansy is so keen to set me up!” Harry groaned, downing his drink in one large gulp.
But Harry wasn’t a brave man anymore, not when it came to this – he could and would throw himself head first into a fight without a second thought, but he couldn’t listen to his own heart.
“No, let me finish. I know the Prophet is shit, of course it is! I mean, all the times they’ve called you a coward or a cheat or a cuckold, they’re idiots. I just read it because it reminds me of before He came back, when my father was just my father and not a Death Eater.”
Reluctantly, Harry held out his left fist (his right still ached from the night before despite all the healing spells) and unfurled his fingers, revealing a small black stone sitting neatly in the palm of his hand. Ron turned away suddenly, and Hermione gripped his hand tighter.
“So Potter gets to be a saint and I’m just a faithful Death Eater?” Malfoy’s voice was cold and steely, and Hermione almost flinched.
“What’s wrong? Another nightmare?” Ron asked, voice uncharacteristically quiet – it was the voice both he and Hermione reserved for when Harry had another episode.
“Ron always cooks more than enough, you hungry?” He couldn’t explain it, but he really wanted Malfoy to say yes. He’d been polite enough to ask Harry yesterday, after all – of course Harry had to do the same tonight.
“No. But since you are, I’ll see you at work.” Embarrassed that he’d come to see Malfoy for no reason, Harry turned away.
“Careful, Malfoy.” Hermione called out, unable to help herself, but she didn’t put down her plate of cake or move from her seat - the broom only flew three meters above the ground, and Roseanne was clearly having the time of her life.
The sun was shining, although it wasn’t very warm, and the leaves on the trees were just starting to redden.
“Malfoy said to say hi.” Harry said to Hermione, relaxing into the comfortable sofa, looking pensive. Hermione didn’t reply, waiting for him to say whatever it was she knew he was thinking about.
“Yeah, thought we’d save you the horrors of conversation with Connor!” Ginny was not a fan of Connor – she was the only one of Harry’s friends who’d never encouraged Harry to date him. Harry often wondered how much of it was genuine dislike and how much was just her uncanny ability to see exactly how Harry felt, but either way he was grateful for it.
“Yeah, I can’t think of anyone’s birthday we’re celebrating, and New Year’s isn’t for ages, so I dunno what the idea was.”
Harry saw Malfoy’s face light up as Dean flicked through the photos, and smiled to himself – the game was on; this was the piece he and Malfoy would playfully fight over.
Malfoy looked up, surprised, almost pleased. He agreed, much to Harry’s relief, and they finished packing up, walking together towards the fire.
“I was just telling Hermione about someone I worked on this morning.” Luna replied airily, beaming at Harry as she reached across Hermione to pat his leg in greeting. He grinned back.
Hermione’s frown faded as Roseanne opened her present – a toy broom. Ron cheered from across the room, where he was chatting to Ginny and holding his son, Harry Frederick. Ron’s cheer, however, had nothing on Roseanne’s scream of joy as she immediately jumped on it.
“You’re comfortable just existing in here.” Malfoy elaborated. “Pansy would want to know everything about the place, would be busy making friends and connections, learning about the muggle world.”
Many hours later, when several bottles of wine had been finished by the group, Ginny and Luna excused themselves to return home, blushing at the lewd cheers and jeers of everybody else. Calliope had migrated to Neville’s lap at some point, and Malfoy had moved to sit beside Harry, who’d just finished his third glass of wine.
Harry and Malfoy held hands as they walked through the park; they talked about nothing in particular, enjoying what was technically their first date.
“I can find out.” He caught Hermione’s eye. She stopped short, immediately paler, hesitant, and then, slowly, nodded. Malfoy looked suspiciously at Harry over Hermione’s head.
“So, we’ve worked out what Cressida was doing here – researching the murders of supposed werewolves.”
“Yes.” Malfoy snapped back, not looking away from the pages. “You told me you didn’t do the whole sleeping around thing.”
They were late to the party, by a solid hour, but before Hermione could even make her trademark face of disappointment and disapproval, Harry waved a large wrapped present in the air. Roseanne leaped off her chair and almost threw herself on the floor in her hurry to greet her uncles.
“And I don’t! Why are you reading this, anyway? They’ve never printed anything factually correct, ever.”
“Fine. I’ll go down into the village and get something to eat. Want anything?” Harry stood, heading towards the door.
“Remember that time she told everyone about Auror Rabnott’s filthy one night stand with the French Ministry’s ambassador?”
Harry was about to speak when there was a growl behind them. Both men spun around, but were careful not to raise their wands or their hands, as Hermione had instructed them. They came face to face with a naked bearded man, at least six feet tall, towering over them. His body was streaked with mud and his nails were long and yellow.
“Of course I do, Potter. My nannies used to read the tale of the Deathly Hallows to me when I was a child. I just always assumed it was a bedtime story, a ghost story of sorts.”
“Oh Jesus…I’m sorry... I didn’t mean…Oh God…I’m so sorry.” He babbled, fingers pressed against his own lips.
Malfoy stood and kissed Harry, a heated, passionate kiss that almost knocked Harry off his feet. Harry was vaguely aware of clapping and cheering, but all he could think of was Malfoy in his arms and the ring on his finger. This was his great happiness.
“Connor Johnson from the Falmouth Falcons asked me out, but I said no, obviously. He’s not really my type.”
Harry didn’t want to get into it with Malfoy now, but there had been times in the past that he’d vanished, no communication with anyone, leaving Ron and Hermione behind to cover for him.
Not long after, Harry and Malfoy left Hermione and Ron’s flat, agreeing to meet work separately tomorrow and meet back together on Monday.
Malfoy agreed, but said he had to return home to change clothes before they could leave for the park.
Malfoy opened his mouth to reply, but Harry was on a roll now, he was finally talking about everything that had happened to him, and he didn’t want to hear whatever Malfoy had to say.
“Malfoy, are we…” he paused. Malfoy continued making pancakes, twisting his wand in circles above the pan. “Are we dating now?”
And for a long, long time, he waited with bated breath, invisible and silent, hopefully watching each alleyway for a sign of Bellchant. They’d been unsure if he’d come as himself, or wearing someone else’s face, and Harry didn’t know how to distinguish a disguised Bellchant from an innocent muggle who had somehow gotten through Hermione’s many spells.
“Oh, isn’t it beautiful!” Hermione gasped, and even Ron, who’d once told Harry he didn’t understand why people bothered with how things looked, looked impressed.
Malfoy’s face was frozen in shock. It was the most open and honest Harry had ever been with him about the war – usually Harry brushed off his questions, or made a passing comment but refused to explain it.
“I heard you won’t be drinking for a while, Hermione.” He told her with a small smile, embracing her lightly before giving Ron a hearty pat on the back.
He didn’t feel brave enough to pick a beer, unsure if he even could name one, and so he left that to Malfoy.
“It’s not about trusting him. I’d trust him with my life – I do every time we’re out on a mission. I just…don’t want to talk about it.” He paused, and Hermione waited patiently. She was used to his way of speaking about personal things – slowly, and painfully, but always relieved afterwards.
“Ah, shit.” Harry swore, bumping into Malfoy in his haste to step backwards. Malfoy edged around him and swore too as he saw what had distressed Harry – the motionless body of junior Auror Alison slumped at the foot of the stairs. Part of her blonde hair was stained a dark cherry red and her face was bloody and bruised.
Harry gasped. He’d never have guessed that this was coming, but he couldn’t be happier that it had. He stared at Malfoy for several long seconds, unable to voice his delight.
“Once a week, maybe less. It was an accident at first: it was midnight, and it started raining, so I ran into the first open bar. Turned out to be a nice place, so I came back.”
“Yes, of course. I’ll be outbidding you this year, Potter, just you wait!” Malfoy smirked a hollow smile at Harry, who smiled back.
Harry, near the front of his group, beside Hermione and Ron, finally saw Malfoy, standing beside Blaise, dressed sharply in a dark green suit, blond hair slicked back sleekly.
“Oh, thanks; it’s coming along slowly. You know what Luna’s like – so full of ideas, not so great at the planning.”
“I’ll sort it!” Harry snapped, voice suddenly too loud, too brash, and this time Malfoy and Pansy turned round, seeing what the commotion was. Malfoy’s eyes caught his.
After a few more minutes of discussing details, Hermione left, saying she’d thought of a perfect prank to get back at Ron, and Harry left quickly after. Unlike the day before, though, he instead stepped straight into his own two-bedroom flat in central London. He, Ron and Hermione had lived together in Grimmauld Place for two years after the war, until they’d gotten married and moved out. Harry, unwilling to live there alone, had also moved out, into his current flat.
“We know, Susan. We don’t blame you. But we need to know who he is so we can stop him killing anyone else.” Malfoy took over, giving Harry a warning glare as he opened his mouth to reply.
Harry was still thinking about the painting several minutes later as a brief break was announced. Harry was about to ask Malfoy about it when he saw Susan Darling across the crowd, cheerily downing a glass of wine while chatting to the people beside her. Harry was struck by how casually she was behaving, compared to the prim and almost restrained woman he’d met the day before. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm, ignoring the sour look Malfoy gave him as he spilled his champagne slightly.
Both men gasped in sync. Harry blindly groped for Malfoy’s lower back, resting his hand in the small of his back, and Malfoy made a tiny, soft, sound that, to Harry’s embarrassment, went straight to his cock.
“Well, I’d just died, so I think it’s understandable.” Harry joked, and could have slapped himself – it was the sort of joke he’d make with Ron or Hermione – people who knew the truth about the night in the forest.
Harry had danced for a little while, with Hermione and then with Pansy, but Pansy had quickly tired, saying she would sit down a while, and perhaps Harry should wait for Malfoy. She’d winked when she said it, and Harry wondered at what it meant, but he did as he was told, happy to watch his friends dancing.
Malfoy dutifully read and Harry used his right index finger to mark a shimmering black dot next to each place, with the date printed beside. Malfoy watched curiously, but to Harry’s relief didn’t ask anything, instead continuing to read out the dates and places.
Harry actually laughed at that, and just as he did, Malfoy appeared over Connor’s shoulder, smiling. He saw who Harry was talking to and the relaxed, casual smile fell off his face. He frowned and turned away, and as he did, Harry noticed he was holding two champagne glasses. He felt guilty for some reason, and he couldn’t shake the feeling until he took another sip of his drink.
“Coming, Harry?” Hermione asked, pausing at the door. Harry nodded, pushing back his chair, but Malfoy stopped him, arm held out in front of his chest, close, but not touching.
“Look at us, look at us…who’d have thunk we’d end up here?” Neville slurred. “I’m a ladies’ man! I’m popular with the ladies! And Ron, wow, you’re a married man! And you’re about to be a dad!”
Both her eyes were missing, and her throat had been slashed in the same way Susan’s had. It was impossible to tell in the dark if she’d been subjected to the Sectumsempra too, but Harry would bet she had. As he caught Malfoy’s eye in the gloom, he knew Malfoy was thinking the same.
The world seemed to shake for a moment, and then Harry felt a surge of adrenaline. Almost without feeling it, he clenched his fist, crushing his empty champagne glass into his palm. There was a splash of blood, and then Ron, who knew Harry best of all and presumably had predicted his reaction, repaired the glass with a wave of his wand. Without batting an eyelid Ron reached out to take Harry’s bleeding hand, but Harry yanked it back.
“You told him it was mine, actually, and that you’d won it off me.” He paused. “Is that it?” He gestured to it, laying harmlessly on the table, looking so unlike the weapon of war and death and madness that it was.
And then he was at the glass doors, pushing his way through flimsy curtains, finding himself standing on a balcony in the brisk night air. He slapped both hands on the railing, leaning out into the open, breathing deeply. His heart was racing – he vaguely wondered if he was going to faint.
“Sorry, Harry. The International Magical Flower and Fauna convention ended a day early and I had nowhere else to go till the weekend.”
“A few?” Harry asked incredulously, looking in horror at all the paperwork she’d compiled. “Did any of your subordinates know about Cressida’s presence in the country?”
“It doesn’t say. I guess we should go check out where she was staying, then.” Malfoy looked forlornly at his half-finished mug of coffee, and then stood, slinging on his cloak and sliding his wand into his sleeve. He tapped his feet impatiently as he waited for Harry to do the same, who quickly sent a memo to Savage about their field trip before joining Malfoy at the door.
He was surprised to find himself so concerned with the topic – although in the past few weeks he’d been increasingly focused on it, he hadn’t really thought about love and relationships since he and Ginny had split up. It had been strange to find himself no longer with the woman he’d once thought he’d marry, but at the time he’d been so full of hope and excitement for the future that it hadn’t mattered much.
Reassured that Scratch’s part of the plan was watertight, he looked around at the people milling casually around them, and was amused to recognise Malfoy sat on a bench reading a newspaper. Although Malfoy wore the face of a stranger, dark hair falling in his eyes, his expression of mild impatience was hard for Harry to miss, even from across a courtyard.
They were silent for a long while, each imagining the horror Susan must have felt to realise the man she trusted was using her, and the pain she must have felt before she died.
“And whose idea was that?” Hermione’s glance was sharp and intuitive, and Harry felt it pierce right through him.
Laughing, Harry made his way towards Hannah Abbott to give her a quick hug and see how she was doing.
The two men didn’t say anything to each other, instead communicating through a series of grunts and movements. Their guide loped off and the new man knelt on the floor, gesturing for Harry and Malfoy to do the same. They followed his actions immediately, waiting for him to speak first, as custom dictated. The tone of this meeting would be set by his first speech.
“So it’s Dark magic.” Harry agreed, trying to ignore some strange familiar feeling that was rising up inside him – he felt slightly off-kilter, like the world was upside down. He shook his head, dog-like shaking off water, and turned back round to face Malfoy, who said what they were both thinking.
Harry didn’t say anything – it was Malfoy’s turn to start whatever difficult conversation was about to be had. There was a long silence – Harry refused to speak first, and it seemed Malfoy had come only to stare at him sullenly from several feet away, so Harry started to close the door.
“That bastard! That slimy, disgusting evil bastard!” Susan shouted, and Harry as amazed to hear her raise her voice for the first time in their interactions. She clearly remembered everything, or at least enough.
He hated feeling like he treated them as emotional guard dogs, keeping out his most negative thoughts, but they both constantly reassured him that it was normal for friends to look out for each other – that’s what love was, after all, and didn’t they all love each other? Harry could never disagree with that.
Harry couldn’t help smiling at the thought of Malfoy being distracted by their kiss, although he felt bad Malfoy had ruined his reputation of giving the best speeches.
“Yeah, she’s my cousin Cressida. We thought we’d come pay her a visit while she was in the country.” Harry smiled, and turned his eye to the menu. “I’d like a cheese and onion pasty, please.”
“Did she say what she’s researching? We’re all pretty keen to find out before we get the shock of a lifetime.” Harry tried up to play the role of friendly younger cousin who was keen to stop his older cousin getting into trouble, but he was distracted by the arrival of Malfoy. Malfoy looked rugged and tired, unlike his usual poised self, and Harry supposed it was because of his uncomfortable sleeping arrangements the night before.
“My turn to talk, sorry!” He joked. “I love you too, Malfoy. You’ve changed my life for the better in so many ways, and these six months have been the best of my life. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“I double checked Bellchant was safely in custody this morning, and everything is sorted. He’s headed to Azkaban tomorrow morning. Your plan was really rather good, Harry.” She continued, reaching out to pat Harry’s cheek.
“Yeah, it was shit, mate. He forgot half of it and had to get his notes out.” Ron looked delighted at the thought of perfect Draco Malfoy having to read his speech from his notes, although he wisely kept that thought to himself – Hermione, who never used notes, wouldn’t hear any criticism of memorisation.
“No, Malfoy. You can pretend you aren’t reformed if you have to in order to save your lives. Harry doesn’t have that option.” Hermione’s voice brooked no arguments, and Malfoy, having argued with her in the past, obviously reaslied he wasn’t going to win this one.
“Potter…I don’t want this to just be a fling.” Malfoy’s voice was pained, and he wouldn’t catch Harry’s eye. Understanding hit Harry like a punch to the stomach.
“Aurors Potter and Malfoy! What happened?” Susan’s voice finally rang out, echoing through the small room.
Harry was saved from having to answer by the arrival of a bright red Howler. Malfoy finally looked up, seeming amused as Ron’s voice bellowed out.
Malfoy said nothing, and Harry, too, was silent as they hugged, until Ron reluctantly cleared his voice.
“You’re one of them, are you? One of them bastards what tried to put her away on that hellish island when she never did nothing wrong?” Jeremiah was enraged now, spittle flying from his mouth, but still no sign of his wand, to both Harry and Malfoy’s confusion.
Harry was rapidly trying to work out the correlation between wolves and murders when Malfoy spoke up.
The two men whirled chaotically around Harry’s kitchen for several minutes, until the song changed to a slower, softer tune – a ballad. Harry made to let go and step back, but instead Malfoy pulled him closer, looped his arms around Harry. They swayed side to side, Malfoy’s chin resting on Harry’s unruly hair.
“I’ll need an answer at some point, but no rush, Potter.” Malfoy added sarcastically, but the smile on his face told Harry he wasn’t worried – Harry’s larger than life grin had to be a dead giveaway of what his answer would be.
“That’s a good idea, actually, Weasley. We could do with the extra manpower since this case seems to be spreading in several directions at once.”
Harry stared at him, breathing hard and fast, palms stinging. He’d said more than he’d meant to, and he could only hope Malfoy wouldn’t notice his careless slips. But he wasn’t so lucky. Of course he wasn’t.
“It’s just that with your familial connection to Dolores Umbridge, we have to check. You understand, sir.” Malfoy’s voice had gotten cooler. Harry remained silent.
He knocked hesitantly, clutching the notebook and case notes he’d forgotten and had to double back and collect. The door swung open almost immediately, as if Malfoy had been standing behind it, just waiting. Perhaps he was feeling nervous too, Harry mused, feeling a strange shock jolt through him at the sight of Malfoy.
Harry didn’t even say goodbye to Pansy, just turned on the spot and spun away, appearing outside Malfoy’s front door. He stood there for a long while, working up the courage to knock on it or to go home.
“But I want to let you in, Draco.” Malfoy had been looking at his hands, but at that he glanced up, eyes wide. Harry continued. “I’m sorry, too. What I said about your father was cruel, and what you said to me was cruel. But I want to move past that.”
Then there were the ones about his career – “Harry Potter – addicted to the thrill of the kill?” “Potter – a boy in a man’s world” (when he joined the Aurors), “Chosen One – not chosen?” (This one came after Ron’s promotion, which Harry himself had suggested).
Both Harry and Malfoy had been to every single gala Dean and Seamus had hosted, each donating obscenely large amounts of money to their charity, Help for War Orphans; Dean and Seamus had become singularly dedicated to helping innocent people who had suffered during wizarding wars, and they now travelled the world to help anyone affected by any magical skirmishes and find artwork to sell at their charity galas.
“She’s lucky it’s not Azkaban!” Harry barked, surprised at himself. The scar on his hand was tingling.
Harry pulled away from Malfoy, embarrassed and awkward, but Malfoy had already turned away, picking up the Portkey and holding it out to Hermione and Ron. Trying not to feel disappointed for some reason, Harry reached out and they all spun upside down.
“I have a guest!” Harry cried out as he stepped through the fireplace just ahead of Malfoy, hoping it would help contain Ron and Ginny’s weekly madness. It was a futile hope, he realised, as Ginny immediately called out to him, trying to get him involved in some sibling bicker she was having, energetically, with Ron as they served up.
“I cracked her code! Took me most of the night, but I worked out a spell that would decipher it.” He pushed a stack of paper towards Harry and waved his wand, muttering under his breath. As Harry watched, the letters and words rearranged themselves on paper. It reminded him vaguely of something Ron had said once, about how letters never seemed to stay in the right places when he was trying to read. He wondered if this spell could be adapted to help him.
“Good. I’m not in the mood to sign any autographs today.” Or ever, Harry added mentally, grimacing at the thought of hordes of people all crying out his name, crowding closer to touch him. Six years had not diminished his fame or popularity with the general population, much to his dismay.
“I always write.” Harry grumbled as he produced a new piece of paper and waited for Malfoy to start talking. It was true that Harry could charm a quill to write as either one spoke, but Harry had to admit that he enjoyed this effort at teamwork.
Both Harry and Malfoy laughed, thinking of all the secrets Pansy had been delighted to spread in the past. Nothing truly important, of course – she was a trusted and valued member of the Ministry, but she did always love to gossip.
“Aw, cute, matching.” Harry said sarcastically, and Hermione smacked his arm, but all three were laughing.
He turned to his own face, strong and almost square, scar on his forehead, half hidden by messy black hair, green eyes behind circular glasses. He closed his eyes, passed one hand slowly over his face, and then the other, right to left, then left to right. Then, without opening his eyes, he tapped his glasses with a fingernail, and then opened his eyes. His face was now framed by short, spiky blond hair. His eyes were a piercing blue, behind rectangle glasses, and the only marking on his face was a slight birthmark below his left eye. He frowned, and watched as a stranger frowned back.
“Cressida Boone believed you were being murdered, and nobody was noticing. But last week she went missing.”
“No. But I know of you, boy. Returned from death itself. The stench clings to you. And beneath that, I smell your burning power.”
They’d had this jokey conversation many times throughout their years working together, and always the other person replied “You wish”, but this time, Malfoy just looked at Harry, eyes wide open. Harry, surprised, stared back. It occurred to him for the first time that he should probably be scared, or at least cautious, but he wasn’t. He was, at the most, nervous. He felt the burn of the Elder Wand in his pocket, and heard its whisper, and shuddered to realise it may be affecting him more than he thought.
“I don’t mean to offend, but you have been unsuccessful so far. We ask your permission to carry on her investigation – to find and bring to justice the perpetrator of these crimes.”
“No, I wasn’t in the office but Ron was there dropping off my lunch, he told me there was an emergency?” Hermione, breathless, dropped into a small armchair to catch her breath. Harry saw what had happened – Ron had played a prank on his poor unsuspecting wife.
“I am Francoise Benoit, a colleague of Pansy and Blaise’s from the French Ministry. You are Harry Potter, correct?”
A cry of joy caught his attention and Pansy appeared in front of them, wearing a black lace dress that flowed around her like water. Her characteristic crimson lips curved into an elated grin as she threw her arms around each newcomer in turn. Blaise stood behind her, holding two glasses of champagne, which he held out to Ron and Harry.
“Oh yeah, I’ve met him. He’s a bit…well…” Harry didn’t know how to put it politely. Malfoy didn’t bother troubling himself with that.
“You seem happier.” Ron told Harry as they put away the plates, Malfoy and Hermione chatting in the living room.
Hermione ran off to find Dean, and the three men went to find the empty room Malfoy had mentioned. A few minutes later, Dean led Hermione and Susan in, talking cheerfully about a painting they might be interested. Ron gave him a quick thumbs up and ushered him out as Hermione gently invited Susan to sit down with Harry and Malfoy and then she joined Ron just outside the door. Harry knew they were still listening, but their presence would have worried Susan more than this interview already might.
“Maybe they thought you were. In pain, I mean.” Malfoy finally spoke, looking at him out the corner of his eye.
“You’re definitely coming round later, right?” Ron asked Harry worriedly, who rolled his eyes and agreed that yes, he’d be there for dinner, as he had been for every Thursday since, well, forever.
“Why don’t you have any of this stuff out there?” Harry hooked a thumb behind him, towards the main room.
Both Harry and Malfoy started uncomfortably as Hermione spoke – Harry at Hermione’s mention of Remus Lupin, which brought a lump to his throat, and Malfoy at her casual use of Voldemort’s name. They eyed each other warily for a moment, half expecting the other to call them out, and then relaxed when neither said a word. Hermione, oblivious, continued talking.
Harry and Malfoy hurriedly made their polite goodbyes and followed their original guide to the edge of the forest, where they promise to return in several days with more news. Then they apparated into the cottage where, to Harry’s horror, Malfoy fainted.
Hermione didn’t bother to reply, instead continuing to flick through the files of Hermans with criminal records, to no avail.
“I can and I will.” Ron replied stubbornly, tips of his ears turning pink, and Harry, sensing the possibility of an argument, interrupted.
“And Harry, mate, you’re the most eligible bachelor in the country! No, in the whole world!” Ron patted Harry’s leg. There was no answer from Harry or Neville, and Ron sat up to see both of them snoring. He climbed unsteadily to his feet, placed two small vials of Hermione’s hangover potion on the side table and stumbled through the fireplace with a final “Byeeeee”.
“Let’s visit them together. I’m not very keen to meet Umbridge’s brother alone.” Harry admitted, and Malfoy nodded gratefully, clearly feeling the same. Harry wondered what these people would do when they came face to face with Harry, who had been a staunch, vocal supporter of Hermione’s work since day one.
Dinner passed in a blur of noise and laughter, with Ginny and Luna telling everybody about some bizarre adventure they’d had a few months ago while travelling, and Harry and Neville countering with their wildest experience in Mexico a few years ago. Hermione was, of course, horrified by their “stupid, reckless behaviour”, which only made everyone laugh more – even Hermione, who, after spending years with Ron, could now happily be the brunt of a harmless joke without being offended.
The light revealed a ditch roughly thirty feet ahead of them, and the four hesitantly made their way towards it, expecting the worst but hoping for the best. As they drew close, Ron recoiled, covering his nose. The other three were slower to recognise the stench, unable to separate it from usual countryside smells, but they soon caught on.
“Apparently she was so embarrassed she ran out before Luna could finish her tattoo!” Ginny grinned as she entered the room, still dressed in her Holyhead Harpies Chaser uniform. Ginny had spent two years as a reserve with the Wimbourne Wasps before a particularly successful game had garnered her a trial with the Holyhead Harpies. Only five years after leaving Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley was one of the Chasers with the Holyhead Harpies, and she was very popular with the fans.
This kiss, Harry knew, was the kiss that would lead to sex – he hadn’t been ready before, but he was ready now. He wanted it, and he wanted it with Draco Malfoy.
Once they’d eaten their fill, and drank an entire bottle of wine between them, they slumped back on the sofa, feeling lethargic, until Harry suddenly had an idea.
“Hermione and I created a spell – at the first sign of trouble, one word and it’ll be sent to a safe location. It won’t want to go, but it will.”
“Oh, I’m sure you are, he’d be mad not to date you.” Hermione smiled at him as Ron enthusiastically nodded his head.
“His name is Herman. I met him a few years ago.” Susan continued to explain, in great detail, everything she knew about him.
“Merlin, Potter, what’s all the pomp and circumstance about? You told me you had a lead, so get on with it!”
There was a knock at the front door. Harry, who’d been half asleep, shook himself awake. None of his spells had triggered, so it wasn’t a reporter or a muggle – must be a friend, then. Most likely Neville, or perhaps Ginny. He found himself hoping it was Malfoy, and then hoping it wasn’t.
Unlike the rest of the flat, his room was a vivid burst of colour – countless of what were presumably his own paintings hung on the walls, depicting Hogwarts and countryside scenes and even a small, darker one of Malfoy Manor burning. Even his bedsheets were a bright green (Slytherin green, Harry thought to himself).
“I don’t know. Maybe because I have all three – I’m Master of Death, maybe.” Harry paused. “Doesn’t mean it’s easy though. I’ve only used it three times, and every time it hurts so much.”
Harry was just debating whether to get a third glass of champagne when a large gong sounded. Attention turned to Blaise, clad in a smart colourful suit.
It was crossing the line, Harry knew, but he couldn’t help himself – Malfoy still read this shitty paper that his shitty father had read so many years ago? What the hell was wrong with him?
“Hermione’s just in the shower, but she’ll be glad to see you when she gets out.” Ron joined Harry on the sofa, holding out a large bag of crisps. “I was just about to have a snack, want some?”
“Right, we can’t make any assumptions at this point.” Malfoy paused. “Although we should probably know more than we do right now…It’s been almost a week since we first got the case.”
Harry spotted Ron a few feet away, engaged in a lively conversation with Dean and Neville. He wished he could leave this awkward conversation and join them. He wondered if he could call Ron over or if it would be too rude.
Thinking quickly as Malfoy made his next bid, Harry shrugged when Dean and Malfoy turned to him, waiting for him to wave his paddle.
“My name is Scratch. I am the Alpha of this pack. You are correct – ten of my pack have gone missing, only to turn up dead. We do not know who causes such offenses.”
“Unlike you, clearly! Now I see why you’re always late to work.” Malfoy smiled up at him as he pushed forward a plate of eggs and avocado on toast.
“You’re right, Harry – I do want to be involved. This seems rather serious.” She flicked through some of the papers, double checking something, and then peered over at the map, which Harry had left on the table, still shimmering with magic markings.
Neither said anything for a long time, just sitting there, existing together. Finally, Malfoy stirred.
“So, Malfoy, dating anyone at the moment?” Ron asked, still sat beside Hermione on the sofa opposite.
Twenty-four hours later, early Saturday evening, Harry frowned at himself in the mirror, adjusting his robes yet again, convinced they weren’t lying right. He could feel his stomach roiling with nerves, for some inexplicable reason, on top of the mild dread he always felt about this event.
“I really am.” Harry replied, listening to Malfoy laughing next door, wondering if he’d finally gotten his great happiness.
He cast a Tempus charm in the mirror, obscuring his face as he brushed his teeth with vigour. Only five hours until he was due at Ron and Hermione’s – it was tradition that the three of them had a drink before heading to Pansy and Blaise’s party. But until then, he was at a loose end with nothing to do.
“Oops!” Pansy put her hand over her mouth jokingly, but she clearly wasn’t going to elaborate. It would be up to Harry to ask Malfoy.
“That doesn’t explain anything. It doesn’t make sense.” Malfoy had flinched at the reminder of his father, and Harry would have felt sorry for him, if he wasn’t so busy feeling sorry for himself.
“You’re ridiculous.” He told Harry, but he was smiling too. “Also, if we’re late for the party, I’m going to let Granger castrate you.”
“You alright, mate?” Dean asked, noting the faint sheen of sweat on Harry’s upper lip, which he hastily wiped away.
And so Harry and Malfoy found themselves standing, side by side, in front of the small mirror in Cressida’s bathroom. Harry, distracted, watched as Malfoy pointed his wand at his silvery hair, which was usually slicked back sleekly, and was now falling softly around his face. The tip of Malfoy’s wand spread a dark brown flowing through his hair, like an oil spill. At the same time, Malfoy’s grey eyes darkened, and his high cheekbones faded away beneath rosy cheeks. Harry stared – in all their time working together, he’d never seen Malfoy in disguise – usually there was no need, instead using Disillusionment Charms, or, in Harry’s case, his Cloak.
“Right, I’ve got to be headed off.” Harry stood, waving his hands and watching as all his notes carefully piled together. Malfoy sniffed, not looking up, and Harry thought back to the night before.
“She hasn’t been here.” Malfoy paused to sip his drink. “I haven’t been here with anybody else – I didn’t think they’d feel the same way about it as I do.”
“Hello, Harry!” Hermione, surprised to see him, made no motion to stand up, instead just waving vaguely at the chair opposite her desk as she finished signing some document. “What can I do for you, Harry?”
Harry realised he was stood alone, lost in thought as he had been, and turned to find a friend or, failing that, a drink. Instead, he found himself facing a tall, dark blond man who was reaching out to tap Harry on the shoulder.
Then Ron and Harry had given speeches. Ron’s had been, typically, full of jokes and stories, but there was no denying the strength of his emotion. Harry, who was a more nervous public speaker, chose not to say too much, but instead read out a beautiful poem about love and marriage (Malfoy had helped him choose it).
“Well, it’s your lucky day, pet, she’s due in for breakfast in about ten minutes, if you can wait that long.”
Somewhere in the back of his mind Harry was hearing a commotion just inside – raised voices, perhaps – but it seemed so disconnected from the electric elation he was feeling that he ignored it, forgot it immediately.
The angle of the kiss was awkward, uncomfortable, and without breaking the connection of their lips Malfoy stepped backwards, bringing Harry up to stand against the balcony railing. Harry released Malfoy’s face with his uninjured hand and pulled Malfoy towards him, to stand flush against him.
He remembered something Ron had said in his wedding vows to Hermione: “Marrying you is the great happiness of my life – this is the joy I’ve been waiting for forever.” It had been a remarkably poetic phrase from someone who had, just an hour before, eaten six chicken legs and then thrown them back up from nerves, but it had brought a tear to Harry’s eye.
“I have an idea, but we’ll need help from Dean or Seamus.” Malfoy suggested, and after a few moments, the others agreed, seeing the urgency in the situation. Malfoy outlined his plan.
Harry didn’t say anything, but he leant his head on her shoulder as she leant against the railing beside him.
“Who is he, Susan?” Harry asked, excited at the possibility of getting a new lead. “We know you were romantically involved with him, and he killed you because you realised he was using to you kill werewolves.”
Harry didn’t need clarification on who Malfoy meant, and he didn’t ask Malfoy to say his true name, either.
Harry looked at Malfoy, surprised, as Susan nodded and left the room, saying a quiet goodbye to Hermione and Ron.
Harry smiled. She had quite a reputation for not only being an excellent flyer but also incredibly fiery on and off the pitch.
“Yeah, I would probably have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t been involved with some sort of disaster every year.”
He was very adamantly ignoring any thoughts of Malfoy, which were alternating between remembering how it had felt to kiss him just yesterday, and how it had felt watching Hermione punch him so many years ago.
“Mr Umbridge, we’re here to ask you a few questions about an ongoing investigation. Is now a good time?” Malfoy’s voice was polite, cool, professional. Jeremiah threw himself into a ratty armchair and grunted again, this time gesturing vaguely towards a sofa on the other side of the room. Harry and Malfoy sat.
Malfoy stood making pancakes in only a pair of trackies, and Harry felt his heart stop for a moment. Blushing, trying to get himself together before Malfoy noticed, Harry sat at the table.
“Harry, mate, are you nuts? That guy was all over you!” Ron gestured to the tall handsome man walking away, incredulous that Harry hadn’t even spared five minutes to talk to him. “Why didn’t you go for it?”
“Nah, haven’t found the right person yet.” Malfoy seemed to be falling asleep and Harry, feeling the effects of the wine, thought perhaps they should return to their homes.
“How much?” Harry asked, and Dean told him. It was a lot. Harry thought for a second, and then nodded, signing the magical contract that would allow the transfer of Galleons from Gringotts. Dean left Harry to wander the maze. Harry looked at almost every piece, wanting to feel the buzz of his heart that came with finding something he loved, but nothing came, although he saw some great paintings and some skilled photographs.
Feeling dizzy, and vaguely like he might be sick, he shoved the bloodstained glass at Ron and stumbled away. He heard Ron telling someone “Well, I finally told him.” He heard Hermione’s concerned, “Oh, dear.”
Harry didn’t go inside to listen to Malfoy’s speech. He didn’t want to hear him cracking jokes and sounding all clever and fancy as though what had just happened meant nothing. (Harry would later find out his speech had been a terrible mess – Malfoy had stumbled through it, clearly distracted.)
“Malfoy, when have I ever had flings?” It was true – Harry hardly even went on dates, and everyone knew it. Harry reached out, turned Malfoy’s face to him gently.
“I bet my father is turning in his cell.” Malfoy stood behind Harry, gently wrapped his arms around his waist, and rested his chin on Harry’s head. Harry had never thought Malfoy was any taller than him, but clearly, he was. It was an odd thought, that they were still learning things about each other so many years after their first meeting as children.
“Without my death, the war wouldn’t have been won.” Harry paused. “There was a prophecy, the one your father tried to get at the end of fifth year, at the Ministry. ‘Either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.’ It had to be me. I had to die so he would.”
They headed quickly to where Susan was queuing to collect another glass. Harry carefully collided gently with her shoulder, immediately apologising profusely. To his confusion, she didn’t seem to recognise him as someone she’d met before, instead blushing and ducking her head when she saw who had bumped into her. He spoke to her for a moment, flashing several hand signals at Malfoy behind his back. Malfoy stepped into the conversation, distracting Susan as Harry searched for any signs of magic around her.
Before he had time to smile at Malfoy, gentle string music started to play and there was a collective gasp from the people crowded behind him. Everyone turned round to see Pansy, black dress charmed white, walking down the aisle created by the two groups.
“Only two of the murders seemed to match our MO – one in Edinburgh two years ago, which was coded as a mugging gone bad, and one in London last year, which was coded as an unsolved murder.” Malfoy held out his small black notebook. “I made notes, if you want to copy them.”
Harry groaned – he could only imagine the fervour and intensity she would bring to this case, and while he loved her to bits, he didn’t think he could handle working so closely with her on it for long.
He twirled in a circle, showing off the dark red suit he’d bought on a whim, and laughed loudly at Ron’s wolf whistle.
Harry nodded, stepping aside so Malfoy could enter the flat. He wondered what Malfoy would think of his flat, so busy and chaotic and filled with things.
“Is something wrong, Malfoy?” Malfoy had spoken with more animosity than he usually did, and although Harry racked his brain, he couldn’t think of anything he’d done wrong recently.
Harry closed his eyes and turned the stone over three times in his palm, breath caught in his throat – he’d never before called anyone he didn’t love, and he didn’t know if it would work.
Harry probably deserved it (he hadn’t been especially kind to the recently deceased Susan) but he was fairly sure he didn’t deserve the sharp kick under the table that accompanied it.
“We could always ask the Northumberland pack for help, couldn’t we? They told us if we didn’t catch him, they would, so why not work together on it?”
Fifteen minutes later (Luna always ran late) she let him into her office and they sat on beanbags together.
He snatched up the most colourful of Malfoy’s paintings (Hogwarts in neon) and took it into the living room, hanging it above the TV with a swish of his hand. Malfoy appeared behind him and laughed, a little bark of noise like he couldn’t stop himself. Harry smiled proudly.
There he is! Harry thought to himself, relieved to finally have spotted the elusive Malfoy again. He couldn’t help but smile as Malfoy laughed so much he spat out his mouthful of champagne. Malfoy rarely fully relaxed, and it was nice to see him looking so happy.
Harry opened his eyes to see Malfoy standing over the body, looking like he might throw up. Harry unwillingly joined him and stared down at Susan’s naked dead body. Deep wounds marked her abdomen, arms and legs, blood pooled and congealing on the sheets beneath her. One eye had been cut out, placed on the pillow beside her, and her throat had been slashed. Harry ran his fingers through the air above her body, identifying the Sectumsempra curse on most of the wounds except her throat and eye, which had seemingly been done by a knife.
Hopefully, somewhere nearby, Herman Bellchant was somehow receiving that very same report. They’d hypothesised that if he’d got to Susan, he’d likely gotten to several other Ministry officials, and could be counted upon to be reading every report about magical creatures.
Seamus announced that the painter had requested to remain anonymous, which Harry could understand – it was a slightly controversial thing to paint. But Harry couldn’t help but notice Seamus wink at Malfoy as the next item was being brought out, and Malfoy flushed slightly, seemingly nodding his thanks back at Seamus.
Telling them about it seemed to help – she became less emotional and more factual as she talked, eventually pulling out an envelope that she said contained a list of all the times and dates she was missing.
Ron had used the stone, once, after the war, and it had been terrible. He’d wanted to speak to Fred, to say goodbye, but when Harry took back the stone Ron had become distraught, shouting and screaming and crying. He’d tried to kill himself, to join Fred, and only Hermione’s quick thinking had saved his life.
“Yeah, I thought I’d surprise you by making pasta from scratch, but I’m not sure I’m doing it right!” Neville gestured to the several pots and pans that surrounded him, and Harry chuckled. Harry had been giving Neville muggle cooking lessons for roughly two years, and Neville was as slow a learner as he had been at Potions. But Harry was a patient teacher, and Neville was more than eager to learn, and so it was an enjoyable experience for them both.
“I can’t imagine what that’s like!” Hermione winked at Ron, who pretended to look put out until she kissed his cheek quickly.
Harry had noticed Malfoy and Hermione whispering during his speech, and passing something between the two of them, but before he’d been able to ask either of them about it, Ron had whisked him off to talk to his parents.
Both Ginny and Luna had wanted to walk down the aisle, and so they’d come to a typical Ginny-Luna compromise – both women would walk down the aisle to meet Ron and Harry. Hermione would accompany Ginny down one aisle, and Malfoy would lead Luna down a parallel aisle.
“How the hell do a bunch of Slytherins drink harder than Gryffindors?” He grouched as he rolled over in bed and almost fell off, swearing under his breath as he righted himself.
Ignoring them, he punched a third time and felt something crack inside his fist. He raised his fist to punch a fourth time. Hands grabbed his shoulders and span him around, pulling him into a rough embrace.
“Yet another one night stand?” Malfoy said sourly, ignoring Harry’s comment. “I didn’t realise you got around so much.”
“Bloody hell, Harry, we were about to send a search party for you!” Ron appeared through the door to the kitchen, but his easy smile showed he wasn’t as serious as his words suggested.
“Hermione!” Harry said, embarrassed that she’d dived straight in, not bothering with small talk. Ron was snickering behind his forkful of food.
He was always better at this than Harry – he knew the right words to say, the right tone of voice to use. Harry was relentless (Malfoy had once called him a bloodhound) – he’d do anything to find the truth, to stop the bad guys – emotions, his or anyone else’s, rarely came into it. This difference in character was partly why they worked so well together.
This was the first time they’d gotten drunk together in a more private setting, Harry realised, which he thought explained Malfoy’s relaxed behaviour and willingness to drink more than usual.
Harry was more than a little worried about this – his night terrors had been upsetting for Ginny, and were a large factor in why Harry didn’t have one night stands. The thought of waking up screaming, sobbing, in front of anybody terrified him.
Harry had never thought about it before, but Malfoy’s face was striking – the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones, the softer inward curves of his cheeks – it wouldn’t be considered handsome (beautiful, perhaps?) but there was something about it. His face was almost hard to look at it – you’d have to learn it to love it. But then, isn’t that exactly what Harry had done? Without even realising it, he’d fallen in love with Draco Malfoy.
Harry and Malfoy outlined their plan, taking great care to explain every complicated part. It took Scratch some convincing that he could not harm Herman – Malfoy swore he’d pay for his crimes, but there must be a trial first.
“Well, a young French witch asked for a tattoo of Ginny blowing her a kiss on her shoulder. I didn’t mind, of course, so I agreed. She didn’t seem to realise anything until I was half-way done and she saw a photo of us kissing on my wall!”
Harry stepped outside Malfoy’s flat and apparated, doubting that Malfoy would have a direct Floo link to Ron and Hermione’s flat.
They chatted about Pansy, and by association Blaise, for some time, before moving on to Hermione and Ron and their pregnancy, and then Ginny and Luna and their wedding planning.
Harry nodded. Although it had been six years, and all three Slytherins had been found innocent of all crimes on the basis of their age and upbringing, some wizards still reacted badly when seeing them. The number wasn’t high, or at least that’s what Harry thought. Perhaps it was worse than he’d realised.
