“Well, I didn’t have the best childhood.” And Harry tore down the dam, and the water just flowed. Harry told Draco almost everything. He told him about how his food was limited, how he was forced to do the chores since he was a young kid, how he was discriminated against because he was magical, how he was ignored in his own home. How he felt like a ghost for the first 11 years of his life.
Draco woke up the next morning. He relished the feeling of sleep, not really fully waking up. Instead slowly coming to his senses. When he finally woke up enough he noticed that there was something curled into his side and something cold touching his legs. Turning his head he saw the most adorable thing. Harry was cuddled up next to him curling into his body, frozen feet smushed between Draco's legs. He was too cute, almost like a baby curling into their mother.
Harry was in shock; how could my mom hide this from them? Harry collapsed into the chair that had been offered and put his hands in his head, did mum hide this or is something else at work here? Closing his eyes, he begged his mum to answer, “They knew you were their son, Harry but three weeks after you were born, they ended up in the hospital with no memory of you or of us being together. Lucius thought it best to hide it from the public because we didn’t want Dumbledore to know who your real fathers were. James being a good friend to us all agreed to marry me, and blood adopt you. We changed your birthday your real date of birth is June 26th, 1979 Harry you were 2 years old when we were killed.” His mum said with such sadness in her eyes she was fearful that Harry would hate her. So, Harry was 8 years old instead of 7 which would make sense on why he seemed to be smarter than he should be his brain was more developed. “I am sorry you had to find out this way honey, but after everyone gets purged you all will remember and Harry you will still have my eyes, but you’ll look more like Tom and Sev though you will still have some of James features.” Lily said to make sure that Harry understood how important the purge was. Finally looking up into the eyes of his fathers who looked shocked and confused he smiled and said, “Mum explained, but for you to understand we all need to do the purge.” Harry said they both nodded and all of them got ready for the purge ritual. “Now all of you need to take this potion and lay down in the circle this ritual takes about 2 hours to get through and doing everyone all at once will save us time.” Gailak said they all did as instructed and laid down in the circle as the goblins each sat on a rune and started chanting the goblins then took a dropped of everyone’s blood and put it on a piece of parchment to know what was being purged. Everyone one but Harry’s were the same except Sirius and Remus’s Hate potion the purge list is as followed
“No, Harry, you aren’t in trouble; we saved you from your relatives, don’t you remember?” Severus asked, hoping there was not a lot of memory loss.
“No Uncle V-Vernon I d-didn’t do it, I d-don’t know what that noise was, I only thought that this wasn’t home this was a prison.” Harry said hoping that little comment would really get him killed then he wouldn’t have to go it himself.
Compulsion- Albus Dumbledore- to believe the prophecy is real and that Severus was the one who told Voldemort about it
“I’m just going to sit with him in case he wakes up again,” Severus said to bring out a book and to sit in the chair next to Harry’s bed. Harry didn’t wake up again until the next morning.
“Harry my boy, I sure this is just a misunderstanding. I don’t believe Mr. Weasley meant any harm.” Said the old goat as he walked down from the head table. “Oh, he meant it headmaster and I advise that he stay away from me, I might not be so nice next time.” Harry said still glaring as he dropped Ron on the floor and walked over to Draco. “Come on Drayk lets go eat I see that Professor Snape is handing out schedules.” Harry smiled holding out his hand to Draco. As they started to walk hand in hand a voice was heard. “That is wrong Harry, being gay is gross and you’ll never be accepted in our world.” Said the big toothed girl from the train. Turning around looking pissed and ready to kill Harry said, “Miss. Granger before you open your mouth, I would advise you to look up Wizarding laws, they are quite different than the Muggle world.” Not bothering for an answer, they left for their table got their schedules and left the Great Hall.
Draco had caught him, he had his prize under him. Harry had stopped struggling willingly submitting to him. His veela was soaring. He was so happy. He finally had the boy of his dreams. It was wonderful.
Harry was freaking out. He was pretty sure none of the dominants would want him, he was convinced he was unlovable.
Draco forced himself to look away from Harry and focused on Blaise. “Hmm, Pardon, just a little distracted.”
Harry tended to his injuries as best he could using scraps of cloth from his old t-shirts to wrap his more severe wounds. Before crawling onto the bed and curling up in a tight ball to preserve body heat as there was no blanket. Harry then fell into a very uneasy sleep. Dreaming of someone (or people) who would care for him, protect him.
“Hey did you guys notice that Weasley's been leaving us alone?” Harry asked his friends one day while they were hanging out by the great lake.
“Huh? I'm Sorry I didn't catch that maybe a bit louder” Harry could clearly hear the amusement in her voice, not even needing to look at her face to know that she had a shit eating grin plasterd on her face.
Pansy led Harry to the table with less people, Harry guessed it was the table for the submissives. He talked with a few of the submissive there but mostly kept to himself and Pansy. He wasn’t in the mood for talking with other people to caught up in his excitement.
So when he was talking to a Pansy in the hallway. Pansy shifted a bit and he could see him. And Merlin to Draco, Harry looked like an actual angel. But he wouldn't put his head up and tried to run away after Draco tried calling after him. So Draco ran after him. But after turning the corner it was like Harry just disappeared into thin air. After looking for him for 5 more minutes he went back to Pansy to see her smirking, she was the only one who knew about his... Crush. She asked about what happened and as he told the story she looked like she started to deflate, but Draco already being upset excused himself and headed down to the dungeon to think about things.
Draco looked so horrified with the information that Harry couldn’t bear telling him about the cupboard or beatings yet, he would just not yet. He needed time to rest after opening up his emotional wounds.
Pansy downed the rest of her hot cocoa. She wasn’t really much of a morning person so she could feel herself slowly drift off into unconsciousness. The last thing she noticed was a warm body, and dark chocolate skin. She melted against the warm body keeping her away from the cold before sleep took over.
Harry landed in the corner with a thud. His uncle stormed right to him picking him up and then throwing him against the other corner this happened until Harry started apologizing for being a freak.
But it wasn't going to plan, they were already half way through the term and besides meals and classes he has only seen 2 glimpses of Harry and both times before he could apologise Harry would always run away.
“Huh?” Harry snapped back into reality after Draco tapped him on the shoulder. “Oh, sorry there’s a lot on my mind. What were you saying?
Harry looked down at his plate. It wasn't empty but it was at least three fourths full. “Yah, I’m hungry.”
Harry glanced around the garden, his garden. No it wasn't his aunts, although it may be her house, her lawn. He tended to the garden, he chose the plants. He planted, watered and cared for the plants. He had no idea what his aunt did with the garden while he was away at Hogwarts, but he was certain his Aunt herself didn't tend to it. It had to be a gardener of sorts, because Harry was sure had his aunt been the one tending to the garden the plants would be wilted and ugly.
Harry had let Pansy go back down to the dining hall since she couldn’t go into the couple's hallway. So Harry lugged his trunk down the hallway. He didn’t remember it being this heavy. Harry barely went 3 doors down before he collapsed on top of his luggage, panting softly.
with Malfoy, always watching him and hoping that Malfoy would talk to him.  Harry would try to be more civil towards him for the rest of the term.  But Harry was pretty sure that Dra-Malfoy would still treat him the same…
Harry was almost at the cave, he was so close. He didn’t know how but it was if he memorised the forest. The trees were so familiar as if he walked this path everyday. He was enjoying the calmness of the nightime, almost completely forgetting about the dominants that could be lurking in the shadows.
“I believe that would be our fault” Pansy said pointing to herself, Blaise, Neville, Theo, and Luna. “Well and the devil twins they helped as well I guess”
"Hey Pans, over here" Hermione said, cancelling the charm and waving Pansy over to the alcove she was in.
“I just wanted to inform you, that you may return to your rooms in the castle. The headmaster has set-up a room for the mated couples for both of you, you should move in soon. You don't need to attend and you can just settle in for the next 4 weeks.”
Harry was frozen. His Veela was telling him to run, to see if this dominant was worthy enough. But he was frozen, he couldn’t move away from where he was. It was if someone had cast a strong sticking hex on his feet.
Draco arrived at platform 9¾, he was currently searching for Blaise, Pansy, and Theo. Draco came into his Creature and Magical inheritance 3 months prior and he had already been to his first Mate meeting. He hadn’t found a mate because all the females were snobby and stuck up, only wanting him for his money. Draco wanted to find love, not some wife or husband (he had no preference) who would care for him and not how much money he had or how powerful he was. Even though he was pretty powerful magically, and physically as well as really well off. Draco had at least 10 thousand galleons in his trust fund alone.
“Woah” Harry looked awestruck at their room. “This place is big” Harry jumped on their king-sized bed.
Draco was stumped over the summer he decided that if he ever wanted Harry's affections or even Harry as a friend he was going to have to be nice to him, he was going to try to be Harry's friends by being nice, it was childish for him to think otherwise, and if he does become friends with Harry he could see whether they could be more.
They cuddled the rest of the night. Harry felt lighter and freer now that everything was out in the open. He was so glad that Draco still treated him the same, even if he knew how horrible his childhood was. It was going to be even better now that he could understand more of his needs and wants.
As Draco was walking to his compartment again. He smelt it, it was so much stronger now he couldn't help but hold back a moan. The Submissive smelt so sweet, so pure. He froze, he just smelt the scent around the compartment, right as he was about to rip the door open his friend Theodore stepped in front of him shaking his head. He growled softly, a warning, before he snapped out of it.
“Calm down Harry, you're practically bouncing off the walls. If you keep this up i doubt you’ll have enough energy for Saturday” Pansy rolled her eyes playfully at her friend. They were on their way to the dungeon for potions class. “And I’m pretty sure you don’t want to be asleep do you”
"That is besides the point, but yes." Draco said smiling, but then turning grim as if he remembered something "I remember you mentioning something about Ron being your first ever friend, What is up with that?" Draco asked
Draco read the book to Harry as they relaxed on the surprisingly comfortable bed of the hospital wing.
Harry looked up from the book, somewhere while reading he had transitioned to lying on his stomach while toying with his hair. After reading the passage he was certain that he was in fact a Veela, and not just a Veela, but a male submissive Veela. After the initial shock, Harry went over to his mirror again and took in his appearance as well as reflecting on his day. Harry realised that like the book said he had been acting extremely more emotional than he usually was. He noticed that he spent a lot more time trying to hide his tears from his uncle… and he was significantly more scared of his uncle… yep he decided i’m definitely a submissive Veela.
Note: This is very very short. Barely 1000 words. I just wanted to write a filler so here this is. I had to re-plot this story again so i will be adjusting a few things, ya. I'll try to post more during the holidays.
Draco smiled at the nickname and grabbed his bag slinging it around his shoulder before he walked back to Harry and grabbed his hand, and they moved to go to the dining hall with the rest of the school for lunch.
After reading that Harry was actually quite excited for his 1st mate meeting that was going to be held in November. He had gotten the letter from the council the day prior informing him of the date and the location. Fortunately for Harry the hunt was going to be held at hogwarts.
"It's okay Draco, erm..." Harry said looking nervous "Do you like me?" Harry asked, closing his eyes nervous. Draco chuckled,
“Hey, I was going to get tha-” Harry stopped mid-sentence when Draco started filling up his own plate. “What are you doing?”
Some of the submissives looked snobbish, the type of submissive who would wine, be difficult. Draco didn’t want that. He glazed over those subs, the others looked ok, if Draco weren’t gay he would probably go for them. He noticed there were less submissives in this meeting then there were in the one he attended over the summer. A lot of submissives chose to wait then.
The pair had also found out that they both enjoyed a lot of physical attention. Especially Harry since he didn’t have that kind of affection, or any affection growing up. Along with that, neither of them minded PDA, and every time they went out of their rooms they were always touching whether it was holding each other's hands, cuddling, or kissing.
"Yah, why did anything else happen?" Pansy asked, slipping out of the way she would act around non-snakes, since she knew she could trust Hermione she was as cunning as a Slytherin that Pansy sometimes wonders how she is not in Slytherin. Pansy was starting to get excited because this had to be good if Hermione was calling in early.
Harry finished picking off dominants. In the end there were 6 dominants left. Harry’s Veela was picky; only a fourth of the dominants remained.
"Yes uncle Vernon" Harry practically whispered just loud enough so that his uncle could hear him. He finished making the coffee in record time, putting the cup on the table then bowing his head "Here you go sir, anything else sir?" Harry asked quietly, not willing to have another punishment given to him so close after last night's punishment. When his uncle didn't respond Harry went back to the corner, bowing his head.
"Um.. No I guess not. I just mean why would you like me? Your... Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Ice Prince, Handsome, and mysterious" Harry said Gesturing with his head then pausing to look at Draco," I didn't even know you were Gay until you kissed me mind you" then he continued his ranting arms flailing," and your so cool and overall just... WOAH, and i'm just... Harry. I'm so Boring and so Plain... Just why would you like me?" Harry asked true confusion flashing through his eyes.
"Hey Mione, what's up you said it was important." Pansy said, turning to Hermione with a raised eyebrow, while Hermione finished putting up a privacy charm around the already semi-hidden alcove, so that if anyone monitoring the halls were to pass by them they wouldn't be able to notice them. It was a system they had come up so they could meet up without "ruining" their "reputation".
Harry was starting to feel hungry. It was a familiar feeling, he didn't eat much but he still felt hungry. So Harry sat up leaning his head on Draco's shoulder, waiting for Draco to turn the page.
Now for Harry, know that your mother and I loved you and if for some reason both she and I don’t make everything will go to Harry, except for the gifts to our friends. Now if both lily and I are gone the guardianship goes to as followed until harry is 25 and has fully matured into his creature inheritance. The first set of guardians are Severus Tobias Snape and his Husband Tom Marvollo Riddle if for some reason these two aren’t able the second set are Lucius Arculus Malfoy and his wife Narcissa Black Malfoy if these to are unable then the third will go to Sirius Orion Black and his husband Remus Jackson Lupin. My last and final suggestion is to go to the goblins and get a purge done not only on yourselves but on Harry as well as an inheritance test. This is my last will and testament so mote it be.
“He is going to need a lot of potions, Sev, and we are going to have to rebreak some of his bones so that they can set right.” Cissa explained she hated that she would have to do this, but it needed to be done. “I will put him in a magic-induced coma; that’s the best I can do for him, so he isn’t in pain.” She said with tears in her eyes.
“I need to leave if my Uncle finds me; I am in so much trouble.” Harry started to panic, even more, looking for a way out.
They barley got into the Hall before Draco was pushed out of the way by someone red and brown. “Out of the way Malfoy, Harry is our friend he doesn’t need disgusting Death Eaters like you around him.” Ron Weasley loudly said the other students in the Great Hall turned towards the commotion. Before Ron could grab Harry’s arm he was being pinned to the wall. “I warned you once Weasley, do not touch me or my family. I also told you we are not friends, nor will I ever be friends with someone who believes they can push people around to get what they want.” Harry said glaring at Ron who looked scared seeing Harry’s purple eyes.
“Dad, Father we might have to use our leverage sooner than we wanted. I think you need to hear this, first since my life is all they can think about.” Harry said slightly less calm as he waved his hand to let them listen into the conversation. “I told you to just knock him out, not try and control his mind! Now Tom and Severus are going to be on alert, and we will never get to Harry.” Dumbledore said sounding stern then going on and said, “we need Harry to win this war, he has to much political power.” Sounding like he really hated to admit that last part. “Well it doesn’t help that he’s already bonded.” Said Hermione sounding defeated that it couldn’t be her. “You could always kidnap the snake and make Harry do what you want.” Ron said not really sounding like himself. “Ron! What’s wrong? That’s a horrible idea.” Hermione said sounding confused like she was looking at Ron for the first time. “Actually, I quite like the idea.” Dumbledore said sounding like he was smiling. “What! Headmaster we couldn’t possibly.” Hermione said but then got quiet. “I think your right Headmaster, getting Draco away from Harry will in turn make him do whatever we want.” Hermione started talking again also not sounding like herself.
“DRACO! Its 11 in the evening, quit your whining, it's going to be you. Let me get back to my book, or I swear to Merlin you really won't be catching Harry. You will be 6 feet under”
Harry let out a relieved sigh and turned slightly avoiding the stiffness in his shoulders. Harry then cracks open his eyes and whispers "Happy Birthday Harry" Then the pain comes back tenfold and Harry passes out, a heap of appendages, clothes and hair.
Harry was shaken out of his thoughts when someone tapped on his shoulder, Harry jumped slightly looking up to see Luna standing beside him. With Neville just behind her. He grinned at her and Neville as he stood up to hug them.
One day Pansy and Hermione had had enough of Harry avoiding Draco, so once again the 2 met up in the dead of night and planned another plan that would get Harry to talk to Draco and not just run away.
Harry picked up his potions book and flipped to the page he last read. He skimmed through the book taking note of the ingredients and compared how they reacted to one another. He was working on a new version of dreamless sleep, that was stronger and not addictive. He was almost done; he just needed to find a replacement for the Valerian Sprigs so that it wouldn't cause an explosion when it came in contact with crushed wormwood. After 2 hrs of reading Harry placed down his potions book and checked the time. It was 11 pm, 1 more hour till he was 15. Sighing, Harry placed his potions book down and picked up his charms textbook and skimmed through the lessons, just retaining the main ideas so that he could perform well at best.
"Perfect, even better with you as my heater," Harry said, but he slowly moved away from Draco slowly looking nervous.
Harry beamed up at him."Yes I would love to accompany you to Hogsmead next saturday Dray, on one condition, don't worry it's nothing bad, actually think you'll like it" Harry said smiling at his pout. Draco then beamed.
He felt like he had the world on his shoulders and he didn't know not to deal with all of it. Things that he shouldn't even have to deal with. That no child should have to deal with. Yet there he was. Every year he kept reinforcing his different masks depending on what the Wizarding World wanted him to be, his hero mask he started to call it.
Then when Harry got sorted in Gryffindor he made up his mind that he wouldn't be able to have a second chance, so once again he resorted to being mean. Just to have those amazing emerald green eyes at him, at the time that was enough but, last year when Draco had been taunting Harry and he looked straight at him with such hate in his glowing eyes. Draco couldn't stand it anymore, he couldn't deny it anymore, he was obsessed and slowly falling in love with Harry, and that was why he decided he would be nicer. He wanted those eyes to look at him full of admiration and love not with hatred and hurt, it hurt him too much knowing that it was him who took some responsibility for those emotions.
At some point, they moved to the living room. Draco was sitting on the couch reading a book while Harry was on his lap reading along. Draco had his hand running through Harry's hair. Harry and Draco had spent the day getting to know each other. They realized how stupid they had been during the previous years. All those years they could have been dating instead of fighting. Draco was determined to make up for 2 years of Hogsmeade dates. Harry just nodded, subdued by the steady fingers rubbing at his scalp making him sleepy.
"Hey, hey. It's okay. I love cuddling no matter my previous cold exterior." Draco cut Harry's rambling, pulling Harry closer. "Now, it's too early to be awake let's cuddle love"
Harry’s submissive instincts were screaming at him to go claim him whenever he saw Draco with the other submissives, even if Draco didn’t look all that interested. They had hung out a lot in the 1st week of the hunt. They laughed and joked, made small talk, talked about opinions, Harry was fascinated on the magical world that he hadn’t really explored other than Diagon alley and Hogwarts. There was so much that he didn’t know. Draco helped shed some light on a lot.
He was always near Pansy during the introductions. A lot of the dominants were paying attention to him. He didn’t understand at first until Pansy told him how rare male submissives were and these dominants were probably gay.
Harry snuffled a bit before he turned facing away from Draco, huddling in the comforter against the freezing air. Draco watched the sleeping form of his mate for a few more minutes before he slowly slipped into dreamland as well.
"Po-Harry? What's wrong?" Harry jumped, startled that one, that Draco Malfoy the Slytherin Prince was asking that and two that he was asking that with such kindness and compassion in his voice. He looked up and saw that Draco was just there. Panicked, Harry started to get up and tried to get away, Draco had other Ideas. He grabbed Harry by the arm and pulled him into his arms.
"I like that. Hazz, Hazza. Has a nice ring. But besides that, can we go down for lunch? I'm starting to get hungry" Right on schedule Harry's stomach decided to make itself known.
Things were finally starting to look up for Harry. After the incident with Weasley, as well as many more with other submissives and dominants, the teacher’s saw it fit to have a ‘short’ seminar on magical beings.
Harry had finished freshening up, but instead of jumping off the walls like he was 2 days ago, he was staring off into space with a blank look on his face. It was unnerving to Pansy, for a good minute she just stared at him startled. This wasn’t what she prepared for, she was getting ready for extremely over-excited Harry, not all serious and anxious Harry.
Draco was hopeful, all he needed to do was chase Harry in the hunt, if he had to he would kill all other dominants who wanted to get Harry.
“Oh, and Harry I saw you staring at Draco” Pansy smirked when Harry’s head snapped her direction, Harry choked on the bite of tart. Coughing it into a napkin.
When they retired to sleep that night Harry fell asleep instantly, too tired to do anything else. Draco on the other hand found it difficult to sleep. He was too angry with the way Harry grew up. He would never allow him to be treated the same way for as long as he was breathing.
Draco let go of Harry's hand to wrap it around Harry's waist pulling Harry closer to his body. Harry smiled into his arm as Draco's warmth surrounded him.
He wasn’t able to finish his thought, because his senses were assaulted with the scent of vanilla and Sandalwood, he melted into the body behind him drowning himself in the warmth of the body behind him, the closer he got to the body the stronger the scent got. The scent was so familiar, it was so early in the morning Harry couldn’t remember where he was.
Harry lugged his trunk onto the train, pulling himself on the train afterwards. He dragged the trunk behind him as he held Hedwig's cage in the other hand. He had set Hedwig free to go to Hogwarts before he entered the station. He traveled to the front of the train, almost in slytherin territory, like the compartment right before it enters into slytherin territory. Harry settled down getting out a hoodie that he bought in Diagon Alley out of his trunk and settling down on the chair leaning so that he was looking outside the window. Luna and Neville settled across from Harry, Nevillle shooting him weird looks.
Draco was trying to make his hair do the thing where it looked messy but in a sexy way. He stopped gelling his hair back over the summer when he didn't gel his hair back during the meeting over the summer and more submissives were looking at him. He didn’t take any particular interest in them though, he was gay and there were no male submissves at the hunt, so he took no part. Though he did figure out that he did look better with his hair down.
“There is nothing going on between me and Blaise okay. Can we just… Change the subject please” Pansy said frantically, her face as red as a weasley’s hair.
“Yes, I called it in like 3rd year, during that care of Magical Creatures Class, honestly you guys are just idiots.”
These days Draco and Harry were connected at the hip. Draco never leaving Harry’s side outside of their quarters, and Harry never wanting Draco to leave his side either, so there were no problems. Even when the pair were in the dorms they didn’t like being apart. Always staying in the same room as each other. The only exception was when one went to use the restroom.
One day when Harry was confronted by Hermione one again after he ran away once he saw Draco turning the corner.
When Draco was able to focus again without the intoxicating smell of the powerful submissive infiltrating his system, he noticed that Goyle and Blaise had the same reaction as him. Shaking his head he steeled himself and turned away from the compartment and walked down the hall motioning for the other 2 dominant Veela’s to do the same.
Draco must have stared for hours, but it was merely minutes, his mind was screaming at him to pounce on the submissive and
“No not really, us creatures mature faster, so by the time we mate it's mature enough to have children. So yes if you were a muggle or a regular wizard it would be rather weird but not uncommon, but for creatures it's completely normal.”
“You're not going to get him to eat anymore, you know that right? I’ve been hanging around with Harry for a while you aren’t going to get him to eat more than half a plate most days, its a miracle he even ate 1 serving.”
Then he focused his attention to the dominants. When he did he noticed a few of them, well most of them, were already staring at him. He squirmed under the intensity of a certain stormy gaze. Their eyes met for a few seconds, his stormy gray eyes captivating his. Harry couldn’t look away. Those gray eyes studied him, taking him in. They stared at each other for what felt like only a few seconds but it could have been an hour.
Harry finished weeding the garden and looked up at the sky for a moment. Enjoying the soft breeze for a quick moment before he had to go back into the house, away from his garden, his plants. Harry couldn't wait until he turned 17 in 2 years, he could use magic, he would be of age, he could escape. Never come back. Mayhaps he could meet that one person who would care for him. He would love that. Harry entered the kitchen after cleaning his feet on the mat outside. Once he was sure he was clean enough, he entered the kitchen to start making lunch.
Draco dramatically raised his arms ready to attack “you sure?” Moving his hands to they were ghosting Harry’s sides.
Thnx for reading hope you enjoyed :) Kudos and Comment, please :) Thnx for the support guys :) School has been taxing there is so much work and not enough time to write... so as you noticed updates longer. I'm not abandoning this fic even if it takes me a month to update.
Hermione and Ron were getting worried because this was almost a daily occurs now, after dinner every day -even though Harry wouldn't eat that much- Harry would work on his homework, that itself was very strange, and then he would go either onto a couch or a bed and just lay there staring emptily at the ceiling mumbling stuff under his breath to really nobody.
McGonagall got a handle on the class and had everyone start to try and turn their match sticks into needles. Harry and his friends got theirs to change fully on their first try, while it took Hermione and a couple of others to get it in two or three tries, Ron didn’t even get the tip to change. “Well done everyone you all did well, I want to congratulate Blaise, Theo, Draco and Harry for getting their match sticks to change on their first try, 5 points each to your house. McGonagall said with a stern smile not really letting anyone know how proud she was of her nephew.
One would think that well all kids need to be punished in some way when they do not follow the rules, but Harry was punished to the point of no food for a week or having his entire body scream in pain from his uncles beating him inside and out. That is where our story begins with a little boy no bigger than a three old living in a cupboard under the stairs contemplating death.
“Not that it’s any of your business but my mom and dad were friends before Hogwarts. My dad was the one who taught my mom about magic.” Harry said still glaring at the idiots. “Why did she go into hiding, if you weren’t James son.” Ron asked trying to stretch for more answers. “Because the person who was after my mom and James didn’t know what they did.” Harry said rolling his eyes getting bored of the conversation. “If we are done with the history lesson, I’m tired and want to get back to Draco.” Harry said looking at them with a bored look. The lions didn’t say anything more and Harry walked away but not before casting a shield and eavesdropping charm on himself and the lions.
“THAT BASTERED! How dare he think that; he can do this to our family.” Tom yelled looking like his old self when he got mad. “Harry, I understand why you are mad, but to use the bit of leverage we have won’t help. We need something that will truly end this without giving our whole hand away.” Severus said going over to his husband to try and calm him down. “I know dad but what can we do? I am so tired of acting like this is just some big annoyance, I just want to go to school and be a kid. Why does everyone have to make a big deal out of me living through the bloody killing cures.” Harry said shrinking further into Draco and looking like he just wanted everything to just be over. “Uncle Sevvy, I think it’s a bad one this time.” Draco said as he saw Harry shrink more and more into himself trying to become smaller than he was. “Harry, go into your mind scape, speak with Lil’s, let your mind rest as well as your body. We will figure out what to do in the morning before breakfast okay.” Severus said looking at his son knowing that talking with Lily would help Harry’s mind rest, she wouldn’t let him out until she felt that he was well enough.
Not waiting for a response, the Minister tapped the next parchment and Lilies voice started to speak. “I Lily Rose Evans Potter do declare of being in a sound mind state this is my last will and testament witnessed by my husband James Charles Potter and our friend Sirius Orion Black if you survive me James please take care of Harry and don’t get him into trouble that means you to Sirius. I leave everything to my husband should he survive expect the few gifts for our friends.
Tom smiled Harry had been excited about learning he could have a pet at Hogwarts sure he had his snow owl Hedwig at home but to have a pet that would be as loyal to him as Hedwig was and he could keep in his dorm was what excite him the most. After getting their multiple compartment Trunks with their initials etched into them, they walked over to the owlery to look at all the pets that were available. “What, are you wanting to look at?” Severus ask when they walked into the shop, knowing Harry would most likely look at the snakes. “I want to look at that Green and Purple Python.” Harry said pointing to the cage the held a 3-foot Python that would fit perfectly around Harry’s arm and stay out of site. “If its willing to pledge its allegiance with you then you may have it.” Tom said know Harry got his ability to talk to snakes and was proud every time he spoke. “Hello, my name is Harry what is yours?” Harry said looking at the snake smiling when it raised its head “you are a speaker? My name is Amethyst nice to meet you Harry.” Amethyst said looking at the speaker with respect “Hello Amethyst I am looking for a Familiar for school and have always wanted to have a snake would you be willing to have me as your Master?” Harry said smiling fondly at the snake hoping she said yes. Amethyst was surprised the young speaker wanted her everyone who ever came in here looked at her with disgust. “I would be honored to be your Familiar, I only have one thing that needs to be seen to. For me to pledge myself to you we have to make sure our magic is compatible.” Amethyst said, “All you have to do is touch my skin and if you don’t get cut then we are compatible.” She said as Harry placed his hand on her skin, they were not only compatible but soul bound Familiars.
“GET OUT! I don’t care what you have read or who you are, if you had any manners you wouldn’t push anyone you don’t know out of the way specially a bonded pair. His name is Draco this is Theo and that’s Blaise, now that you know our names leave us alone.” Harry said looking very angry his Green eyes flashing Purple. “Harry! I’m fine, see no harm done.” Draco said kneeling next to him holding his hand trying to calm him down. Harry looked down at Draco shaking and tried to slow down his breathing. “I really suggest you leave, Harry does not take anyone treating Draco badly.” Blaise said looking at the girl who only nodded as she left the compartment.
Once the feast was over, the old headmaster got up to do his speech. “Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. I would like to welcome our first years and two knew teachers to our lovely staff. Teaching potions is none other than the Youngest potions master in Great Britain Professor Severus Snape, as well as his Husband who will be our new defense against the dark arts Professor Tom Riddle-Snape please give them a warm welcome.” The Headmaster said then went on to state the rules and then sent everyone to bed.
century. I’m Hermione Granger she said looking at Draco with shroud eyes that meant anything but nice.
They left right after dinner towards the Headmasters office, not really wanting to see the old goat but knew they had to show up as civilized as possible. “Acid Pops.” Tom said with a roll of his eyes. Walking into the Headmasters office Dumbledore wasn’t the only one there. “Eight o’clock right on time, good I asked all the teachers here tonight so we can discuss Harry’s future and make sure his behavior in classes will stop being so disruptive.” Dumbledore said not even bothering to see the looks of shock on everyone’s face. “Now Harry I will not be having you throwing students up against a wall anymore and this thing with Draco in pretending to be gay will stop as well.” Dumbledore continued giving everyone a grandfather smiles of sadness that made it seem like he was sorry that Harry was doing all of this. “I will stop you right there Professor before you make a bigger fool of yourself than you already have. First off, I am gay, Second, I will not stop what is going on with Draco and I since that would be going against Lady Magic herself as she was the one who accepted our Magic and Soul bond at just nine years old. Third, I will try not to throw anyone against a wall but I will warn you if Mr. Weasley or Miss Granger do not cease and desisted the notion that I am their best friend than I will not be held accountable for what happens when they have already been warned twice now. That also goes for any of the Gryffindor’s who think that just because I am Harry Potter and my mother was Lily, they have some right to demand I am changed from a Slytherin to a Gryffindor.” Harry said looking at Dumbledore with very bright purple eyes of determination that everyone in the room could tell that Harry was not happy about being told to stay away from Draco. “I will also put in if this whole conversation was about you trying to take control of my life and not actually about something to do with school or my classes, I have no problem going to the school board and filing a complaint to them for you using your position as Headmaster for anything other than being a School Headmaster.” Harry smirked at the goat with such malice that would have made Severus and Tom laugh if they weren’t in the company of other teachers. “I think this meeting is over, like I said before I am a busy man and I do have another meeting.” Dumbledore said looking shot down and ready to throw a tantrum for not getting his way. “I will then say good night to you all and see you all in class tomorrow.” Harry said bowing as he walked out of the office and started to go back to the Slytherin common room, or try to that is until he got his in the back by a curse.
Harry was in with the dominants for a full day. The last time it had taken this long it was because all the dominants had been knocked out by the submissive, that was over a decade ago. All other hunts had been within 6 hours. The council was starting to get worried about how long they were staying in there, wondering if the submissive had just found a good hiding spot or if all the dominants were dead.
"Well... I WAS RIGHT!!" Hermione grinned, "Harry does have a thing or Draco!" She looked at the Slytherin and she saw the gears working inside her head, and then slowly she started to grow excited as well. Then she looked straight into Hermione's eyes, completely serious.
“The book said that the hunt starts with the most powerful submissive. Since this isn’t the case how are we going to do this?”
"HARRY! What is up with you? Last term you were still fighting back! But ever since... ever since... ever since the Yule Ball you've been different! You run away from Draco! Just... just we want to know what is up with you! We're your friends, we only want what's best and to help you!" Hermione said, you could clearly hear the concern laced in her voice. It hurt Harry to see that she was this shaken up by his
"No, no you didn't" Harry said rubbing his eyes. "It's just- are you okay with us cuddling? I mean, you don't really seem like the cuddling type so I assu-"
He wondered if he would ever be happy, or if this year was going to be the year that could be normal... or as normal it can be when you are the boy-who-lived and everyone is either worshipping the ground you walked on or is calling you a liar and a cheat. And with Cedric dying and Ron and Hermione's newly found relationship - where they often ignored him and left him sad alone- he was wondering if he could ever be happy.
Harry raised his head slightly to make sure then headed over to the table and collected Dudley's china then deposited them in the sink, he rinsed them with water, then went back to his corner to wait for his Aunt and Uncle to finish eating. When the couple was finally done eating he got their plates, cups and utensils then placed them in the sink. He then started scrubbing and doing the dishes. Finishing as fast as he could so that he could go to his room to relax before his birthday.
“That is hungry? The stimulants usually make you starve. It's why everyone is carrying around snacks, are you sure you're not hungry? It’s ok to eat more we aren't going to judge”
Harry had been walking a while, making sure to spread his scent around the entire enclosure to confuse the dominants. Harry was coming close to the outer rim of the enclosure, surely most of the dominants were at the center by now.
He studied the eyes, they had so much depth, so much emotion, warmth in them Draco was swimming. The rest of the world faded. It was just him, Harry and that sweet smell. He took in Harry’s slender body, curves accentuated with his robe. They were traditional submissive robes. Draco was wearing something similar, while Harry showed off his curves, Draco’s displayed his angular shape and strong muscles.
"YES! I knew it!" Hermione shrieked , "I can finally tell Pansy... ohh this is going to be so much fun" Hermione smirked with a mischievous glint in her eye. Harry nodded at her then turned to look at Ron who, to his surprise looked amused.
And Draco knew for sure he was in love with Harry, and he was determined to have that boy as his mate.
Harry finished the dishes, then went upstairs to his cousin's second bedroom. He went inside then picked up his textbooks, he was able to sneak them out of the cupboard the other week so he could actually prepare for his classes. It wasn't that Harry wasn't smart. He probably could answer the OWLs and get EE, or an O in some subjects. It really wasn't his fault. He was so used to staying in the background and purposefully failing classes, that he carries that habit to Hogwarts. He was never able to shake it. Then when he met Hermione he didn't want to upset her by beating her grades, or be accused of cheating. He just made sure to know the material and then do his best during the test. He actually wasn't that bad in potions either, if Snape didn't intimidate him or belittle him, shocking him to adding extra ingredients and then messing up his potions he would be good, it would be even better if the Slitherins stopped throwing stuff into his cauldron constantly. He was pretty good with the theory, but he couldn't work with all the distractions and people tampering with it, so he was never able to practice it.
Harry's hand touched her skin and their magic glowed around them as they were bonded instantly. “Whoa, what just happened?” Harry said looking at Amethyst “Young Master we were meant to be! I have found my soul Familiar! It means I am the only Familiar that will be able to bond completely with you.” Amethyst said sounded proud that she found her one true master “This is amazing I can’t wait to take back with me.” Harry said picking up Amethyst and walked toward his father. “I found who I want.” Harry said looking up at his father who looked so proud. “Harry you’ve bonded to your true familiar I’m so proud of you.” Tom said having heard the conversation. After a couple of minutes Draco came back with a black kitten with bright green eyes “Her name is Jade, the owner said that most customers take one look at her and say her eyes are to creepy.” Draco said looking at Jade like everyone was crazy to think such a thing about a kitten. “I think she is beautiful Drayk, I love her eyes they definitely named this beauty correctly.” Harry said as they both walked up to the counter and paid for their Familiars as well as their beds, food and Jade’s collar. Amethyst wrapped herself around Harry’s arm and laid her head on his shoulder as they walked into Olivanders. “AHHH! What are you doing with that ugly thing?” again the Woman just couldn’t leave them alone “She is my Familiar and if you or any of your family so much as touch her I will have you arrested for harming her.” Harry said seeing the woman raising her wand, “Now if your Children are done getting their wands, I would like to get mine so I can get out of here and go home.” He said looking at her with a glare that would freeze time. “Yes, we are done anything to get away from that THING!” She shrieked looking at the snake like it would strike at any second backing her kids towards the door before bolting. “Finally, Now let me help you get your wands gentlemen.” Olivander said looking thankful that woman was out of his hair. It took only 10 minutes for them to find their perfect wands, Draco’s was a 11 and a quarter inch Hawthorn and Dragon Heartstring and Harry’s was of course the brother to his fathers wand 13 inch Holly and Phoenix Feather, after paying for their wands they left the shop and went back into the Leaky Cauldron and apparated back home.
When he finally was able to focus on what was going on around him, he started to observe the people around him. Dumbledore was talking, something about an instinct stimulant in the drinks. Harry just listened to Dumbledore talk in the background, he already knew most of what he was saying anyway.
Harry and Draco didn’t leave their rooms often other than to eat, and catch up on the school that they were missing while they were settling, but whenever they did leave it was to hangout with Pansy or Blaise or Neville or any of their friends. The more they went out, the more Harry noticed the absence of one annoying weasel.
Draco turned to talk to Blaise. When he smelt it. Ohh it was as sweet as it was the first time, as potent as pure. Ohh the submissive smelt so pure. Draco’s neck snapped in the direction. His eyes were hazy, only following the scent with his head. When his vision cleared up he gasped in surprise. The mystery Veela was Harry, Harry looked awkward like he didn't know what to do.
Nothing could ruin his mood, well almost nothing. Weasley would still glare at him from across the room while Granger just allowed it to happen. Ginny had finally noticed he was missing and started to try to latch on him. Luckily Harry had a Pansy, and Pansy had like a third eye for this. It was like she could sense when weasley or granger were on their way and would always usher him away. He was very grateful, the only thing keeping him from clawing their eyes out was the fact that they never got within 6 feet of him.
The Goblins also informed Harry that there were large amounts of money being taken out of his vault every year. When they investigated it they found out that it was Dumbledore who had been stealing from him and depositing it in Vaults that were keyed to Ron Weasley. This just made Harry more hell-bent on avoiding Ron and by extension Hermione. This made him suspicious of Dumbledore's true intentions. When Harry was curious to see whether or not he was keyed any potions, the goblins said that his inheritance would have flushed all of them out so there was no way for them to know for sure.
Pansy went down to the mess hall. It was barely even light out, but she wanted to be one of the first to greet Harry and his new mate when they finally returned. She wasn’t hungry yet so she grabbed a mug of hot cocoa and moved closer to the enclosure.
Just as Draco was finished with his plan he spotted his friends by the train's entrance. On his way to his friends he froze. He smelt the most amazing scent since he was at his Veela Meeting. After a few moments, the scent dissipated and Draco continued his way to his friends knowing exactly what that scent meant. There was an unmated submissive Veela at Hogwarts, and they were powerful and by the looks of it very fertile.
He would never give up. He was going to get that submissive. Kill all the dominants that come close to him. Protect the submissive. Anger and Frustration rooted deep within him shot up. He ran towards the hedge with a shriek he needed to get to the other side, before the other dominants did.
“Students.” Dumbledore noticed none of the students could hear him, they were trying to keep their instincts under control. He cast a sonorus on his voice. “STUDENTS.” All heads turned towards him. “Good, now that I have your attention, just a reminder that all students who will be participating in the hunt will be exempted from all school work, until the hunt is done. Teachers have been notified, none of them are requiring work from you until after the settling period for those who are going to mate. This will allow you to choose your mate and choose them wisely, they will be your mate for life. Now that is out of the way you may now mingle.”
Draco couldn’t stand it. There were so many dominants around him. Too many dominants around what should be his, Draco had to steel himself. Harry wasn’t his… yet. He just had to win him over, Woo him. Make Harry forgive him for all that he was done over the years. Give him a second chance to prove himself.
“I think I know who’ll catch her” Harry leaned back down, and winked at Blaise before melting back into Draco’s warmth as they got closer to the dining hall. They settled down at the submissives table where Pansy and Harry usually sat. Harry knew he should have woken up Pansy, but what fun would that be? Plus he wanted to spend a little more time with his new dominant.
Sorry, this is short. I wanted to update before my birthday on Saturday, and frankly, I honestly don't know how to make this longer. Oh well.
Harry had gone through all his clothes that he and Pansy had owl ordered. He realised he didn't order any clothes for the winter weather. All he had was the jacket he wore during the hunt, and the robes he wore in the enclosure. But other than that he had nothing else warm to wear except a few long sleeves. After thinking about it a bit he decided that the long sleeves would work, even if they were thin.
He then started to heat up the roast chicken from yesterday and made sure that it wouldn't get too dry. After preparing the mashed potatoes and gravy he plated them on a white long plate with floral patterns and placed them on the table. He then got the orange juice and water jug from the fridge and set them on the table. Once all the food was prepared he set the table for three then rang the bell signaling that dinner was ready. He hoped that the Dursley's wouldn't be able to taste the faults, but knowing them they definitely would.
It was a chaste kiss but filled with as much love as Harry could relay in that moment. When Harry leaned down the pair smiled at each other.
He prepared himself to fly, he was pounced on by a bigger dominant. Draco shook him off easily.  How did he not sense this was dominant coming. It must be the sneaky one. Draco growled. If this dominant thought could coerce him into becoming he had another thing coming. Draco used the bigger dominants own strength to flip him over while he was trying to ram Draco into a tree.
He wasn't able to finish that though because the next thing he knew he was being tackled to the floor and there was a warm body on top of him, making his veela purr happily. He struggled trying to turn around to fight this dominant.
. As his mate. It was surreal. Harry was waiting to wake up to find himself back in his cupboard. It never came.
When the boys returned to their rooms they cuddled, munching on cookies that they had made days prior. Still burned, but somehow still good.
“Umm.. not a lot to be honest. When I was younger i used to think you lived a very privileged life.”
Harry was mesmerized with how beautiful Draco looked at this time of the morning. The light was shining, making his hair look like it was spun of gold, and his skin looked like he was glowing.  He looked like a Greek god with his sharp aristocratic features and toned upper body. Harry turned more to observe
As Harry was reading again he was able to get a whiff of the sweet intoxicating smell, but this time it was so much stronger, it felt like someone had gotten a spraycan and made it rain with the scent. When Harry got his first whiff Harry shot up staring at the door, almost willing it to open up. He was almost drooling, it took everything in Harry not to run out of the door and run, but he knew that if he did that it could potentially be seen as a chase to the dominants outside the compartment. Harry was about to just that but to Harry’s dismay the door didn’t open, in fact the smell faded away instead.
Harry especially loved Draco’s kisses. From the light feathery ones that Draco planted everywhere from his cheek to his shoulders and his nose. Those always made him smile. To the hot, heavy and dominating snogs that they shared, those always left him breathless.
He watched as Harry passed in front of every dominant, he’d already ½ of the Dominants. Draco was shaking. He was so worried. Harry was at the dominant right to his left. Draco held his breath.
Ever since that one kiss when they got back to their rooms, they both took it as a sign that they were ready to take the next step in their relationship. In other words. A lot more snogging.
Harry left the room and went down the stairs to get a start on breakfast before Dudley woke up, and complained. He made bacon, eggs, pancakes, and sausages flawlessly (to any normal person, but to Harry and the Dursleys it wasn't good enough). Not even trying to eat some, because he knew how fat he was, how freakish and ungrateful (what could he say after years of being told the same thing over and over again he eventually started believing it, despite knowing that it was wrong). No he didn't deserve to eat, no matter how hungry he was. He served breakfast while standing in the corner waiting to collect the dishes and get started with his long list of chores already on the counter.
Harry leaned up and kissed Draco’s cheek to calm him down, he also released a few calming pheromones for extra measure. It worked because a few moments later the blonde calmed down and resumed his reading. Still, however, mumbling under his breath ways he would torture and eventually kill the stupid weasel if ever even look in Harry’s direction.
The Displaying week was over. It was time for the dominants to decide who they wanted to have as their mates, which submissives they would be willing to die for, care for, love.
“Oh for the love of Merlin. Harry. NOTHING. Is going to happen. Clearly all the dominants want you. If they didn't they would be BLIND, DEAF, AND HAVE NO NOSES. You are the most sought out submissive here. The only way you’ll be walking out of here mateless is if you reject ALL dominants, which we both know won’t happen because of the ice prince”
In the main room where they entered there was a small kitchenette that was across to a small island, that had bar stools tucked into the side. In the other corner, there was a small sitting room, and in the center, there was a small coffee table. To the side, there was a small mini-balcony where they could look out into the quidditch pitch of Hogwarts.
“Hmmm, ya your right. Though your Veela could be blocking them because they know you have me now” Draco gave a smug smirk, reaching for Harry’s hand and lacing their fingers. “Or they could have worn off”
Draco had to stop himself from snogging the beautiful boy senseless whenever those eyes turned towards him. He was happy to notice how Harry would stare at him constantly, the same way that Draco would in turn stare at him.
Even if they knew they could never. The blonde haired dominant had such a determined mask on. His eyes hard, glaring at every dominant that came within 5 feet of the beauty that was the male submissive, most of the dominants still came close though despite the warning growls and sharp death glares.
Draco on the other hand was confident, he was only going for one submissive in this hunt. It was obvious, every dominant in the chase knew it. A lot of them were going for the same submissive, determined to at least get a chance.
He was in position, and pounced on the deer, letting his Veela take over for the meal. He skinned the deer before eating the animal raw. The hot red blood made the animal warm as he took bite after bite. The taste of the warm blood flooding his mouth, excess dripping down his chin. He moaned. The meat was so tender, so soft, so juicy, Harry relished the taste of the deer's blood, the thick, warm liquid made him feel warm inside as it slowly filled him up.
When she finally got to the Library, Hermione started asking him questions about where he was, but Harry was already tired from his little run in with Draco, that he was just answering the questions without really realising what he was answering, Harry picked out a charms book and sat down with starting his charms paper, the last thing that Harry heard before he got lost in his work was "Dammit!" Courtesy of Hermione.
And just like the first time Draco opened up to Draco about the cupboard, the beatings and the emotional pain he went through when he was with the Dursleys. The entire time Draco held Harry close to his chest as he processed the information Harry was given him. The worst of it was that unlike the last time Harry was so calm, not shedding a single tear. This just made Draco even angrier.
Draco got his Jumper before retreating back to the bathroom looking smug at being able to get such a reaction out of Harry. When he exited the room a good 5 minutes later, he was dressed and ready to go. Hair styled to perfection not a hair out of place.
“Ya. But you said they react differently to each submissive. Maybe I’m just even more different.” He smiled cheekily, Pansy just rolled her eyes.
Draco chuckled pulling Harry impossibly closer. “I love you too Harry, more than you could possibly imagine”
Draco has always had a crush on Draco ever since he 1st saw the raven haired boy in Madam Malkins, Draco tried impressing the boy but looking back at it, he came off as mean and he knew it. Draco always thought that he would have a second chance when he got to Hogwarts again, which is why when Ron was able to befriend Harry in his 1st go Draco got really Jealous so he resorted to being mean.
Get a grip Harry, DAMNIT! All you had to do was pour the soup into the bowl! GOD DAMNIT! Harry repeated to curse himself while cleaning up the mess of soup on the chair then cleaning up the dinner and placing the leftovers in the fridge.
Harry looked through his side of the closet that Draco had unpacked for him yesterday. One day in, and Draco was already being the perfect mate. Harry smiled to himself as he looked through his shirts already settling on a pair of jeans that he knew were good enough to keep him warm in the chilly November weather.
Thinking about this imaginary person Harry felt even more alone, he felt that if he were just to disappear no one would even notice much less care. His stomach grumbled, then he realised how hungry he was. He didn't even know when the last time he ate was. He longed to go back to Hogwarts at least there he had food -even though he couldn't stomach much- water and a bed.
claim what was his. While his body couldn’t move and inch, he was mesmerized even though he had seen the same thing many times over the years. He moved closer trying to get a better view as branches obscured his vision.
“Ah, I see. Well, I’ll see you in the room” Draco smirked turning away from his mate, not really moving.
Draco continued to eat his steak, still sneaking glances at Harry when he thought no one was looking.
Early the next morning Harry woke up with his body aching. Stretching to get his glasses he opened his eyes to see that he could already see everything well enough. Thinking that he must have slept with his glasses on he stretched and rubbed at his aching muscles and standing up, using the table as a support for his wobbling legs.
“Just. If you're hungry we can always call a house elf. I don't want my submissive going hungry. Harry just nodded, even though he wasn’t going to do so. He needed to keep his weight because what if he just gained so much weight Draco would leave him. Totally implausible but this was one of the many thoughts running through Harry’s head until he was shaken out of his  thoughts by another person.
Harry actually paid attention to Dumbledore this time. He was glad that he didn’t have to focus on school work while he was participating in the hunt whether or not he would gat a mate.
Harry thought about his birthday and wished that he could spend it in the burrow with his friends and actually have a real birthday for once. With a party, cake, presents, and his friends.
“Shut up,” Harry said, returning to his tart. “Sure I was staring at Draco, I mean he is a dominant right, it must be the stimulants.”
“Well, yes, but it reacts differently to everyone's hormones. But by the last dose, all instincts should be out. Like for example from my experience the first dose will usually bring out my motherly instincts, for you, it might be your more submissive qualities or make you easily flustered. It depends, why how do you feel?”
Severus Snape and his husband Tom Riddle I know you have the wrong impression of me the only thing I can suggest is a purge test and hope you understand afterwards. I leave you Vault 590 with all the Potters library potions books as well as very rare ingredients.
“write down the potions, and I see if I have enough for the next few days, then I will start to stock up,” Severus said just as he heard the door open to his husband, looking very grave. “We got to him in time, Tom, but he’s going to be put into a coma so that we can give him the care that he needs for the next few days,” Severus said, trying to reassure both Tom and himself.
All the time that he was able to spend with Harry was amazing. He loved the way Harry would laugh and smile, how the corners of his eyes crinkled slightly when he’d laugh or smile. Or the small quirk of Harry’s lips when Draco did something idiotic. Or the way Harry’s eyes twinkled.
Draco continued to stare at Harry even after Pansy had nudged Harry making him eat his food. He looks so beautiful, it was hard for Draco to just stop looking at him.
After a while, he noticed that the hand that used to hang loosely around his waist moved up to card through his hair. He gave a soft purr before he tilted his head up slightly to peer at his dominant’s face. Grey eyes stared right back at him
They arrived at the clearing where the tents were. There weren’t a lot of people there, maybe around roughly 20 on one table and then 10 on the other. When Harry stepped in the tent his senses were overloaded with so many scents. Harry went weak at the knees, it just smelled so good. Pansy was already so used to the different scents that it didn’t bother her much, and Harry held on to her for dear life. She didn’t seem to mind much.
When he and Harry would talk half of the time he was just staring at the beautiful boy standing in front of him. Wondering why they had become rivals through the years, if only he wasn’t such a git when he was younger he could have had him all this time.
Thank you for reading! Hope you all enjoyed it? :)) Kudos and Comments are very much appreciated thanks :D
Needing to make sure this dominant was worthy, he had passed the first task of actually catching him. Now to see if he was strong enough. He finally was able to flip them, the blonde Veela was strong, Harry was pleased. He started to claw at the dominant. He wasn’t able to even get one before both his arms were caught and he was flipped again. But this time his eyes were locked with piercing story grey ones. Harry was lost in them. This dominant was worthy, he had earned that title. And Harry willingly submitted to this dominant. Baring his neck for the dominant to scent him.
Draco flew up to a tree and waited, and the submissive came closer and closer until Draco could see the little submissive coming up. And oh Merlin he looked beautiful. Draco didn’t know how but it was as if the submissive had a glow to him, Draco could spot it from anywhere even in the dead of night. Even if the submissive was ruffed up, hair messy full of twigs, skin smeared with mud here and there. It didn’t matter, Harry still looked wonderful and nothing nature could throw his way would make him look less than it.
Harry looked at his wings again stroking the wings and then softly shivering in the soft waves that stroking the outer feathers gave him. Harry thought… is this such a bad thing? Harry thought about it as he toyed with his hair… no, no it wasn't such a bad thing. This could finally be the chance Harry got to be cared for, to have someone love him. No this would be a good thing, and Harry looked forward to meeting his mate. Remembering that the Goblin’s were waiting for his response as to what his inheritance is. So Harry got up and got a parchment and a quill and wrote a quick letter to Ironclaw, saying that he was a Veela. He gave the letter to Hedwig, then lay down on his bed exhausted, as soon as his head touched the pillow he was out like a light.
He was, it was all under his glamour. Along with the eye bags from his sleepless nights, and his scars from his tortuous homelife.
Once the scent disappeared and his head cleared. He was taken to the dominant entrance and given the inducer. He could feel his senses sharpen. He let out his claws and his wings, growling he could feel other Veela’s nearby. He could smell the submissive. It was faint but he could smell him. There was a hedge keeping him from the submissive he tried everything to get there. There was something keeping him from flying he couldn't cut the hedges.
“Don’t hide,” Draco said, Harry tilted his head to look up at Draco and mumbled something. “I’m sorry, Harry, I wasn't able to catch that”
“Draco. What did I just say, you are one of the most intimidating dominants second to me of course. You need to calm down. You already have Harry’s affection, all you need is chase to keep him” Theo said, not looking up from his book, “You have this in the bag, don't worry.”
"It's okay Harry. You don't have to explain, I understand. As long as you're warm, I don't want you catching a cold. So if you feel cold just tell me okay baby?" Draco said looking into Harry's eyes.
When Harry found that out, he also realised that he may or may not have feelings for his schoolboy nemesis Draco Malfoy -Harry was sure Ron would freak when he heard this. That made everything click, why he was so
“Ok then, if you're sure.” Pansy was still judging his plate, her own plate filled with so much meat and salad Harry didn’t know how she could eat that much “God knows why you're not slimmer.’
Later that night long after Harry and Ron had gone up exhausted from all the revision work, the same bushy haired teen under the disillusionment charm snuck out of the common room and down to the snake den. Once she arrived she saw her by the entrance tapping her foot impatiently, God to the bushy-haired teen she looked perfect. She'd been harbouring feelings for the Slytherin for some time now, not that she would admit it to anyone. Unlike what most people say, she was actually a decent person.
"YES! I KNEW THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM!" Pansy said, she shot up then started pacing "I've always thought that Draco must have had a thing for Potter, always 'Potter this, and Potter that, and Potter with his Perfect smile and a Perfect eyes.' I should have caught up sooner, Bloody Hell. Especially recently I am 1 million percent sure Draco so has a thing for Potter! I mean he has been rather soft recently! Even nice to other Lions! Bloody hell! I am so shipping them!" Pansy then gasped then she stared at Hermione and squealed "WE NEED A SHIP NAME!!!"
Harry knew they were released, he could sense them all around him. There was one in every direction. He needed to go deeper and find a place to hide, where the dominants would have a hard time finding him.
“If you're not ready I'm 100% sure that Draco would understand, he won't pressure you into anything you know, under all that ice is a rather warm soul.”
He loved everything about Draco. Draco’s eyes looked at him with so much love and affection. Draco’s rare smile that was only common for Harry to see. Draco’s scent that instantly calmed Harry down and Draco’s embrace was always that warm and safe.
The one good thing about his birthday, his relatives would avoid him at all costs. It was like a little retreat, their own form of gift maybe. Anyway no matter what it was. Besides having a longer list of chores, or being avoided like the plague, to Harry July 31st was just another day. It was like any other day, therefore nothing to celebrate, if there was anything to celebrate. Harry couldn't wait.
Draco could tell Harry was slowly waking up because Harry started to wiggle until slowly Harry smiled softly and nuzzled his head into the pillow before he opened his eyes to stare up at Draco.
She had her suspicions that Harry has a crush on Draco, all she needed was Harry's confirmation. But if she was honest she could see Draco would also show his concern for Harry, and if it wasn't for the fact that he already suspected that Harry liked Draco she would think her idea completely preposterous, but she had her suspicions that Draco liked Harry as well. I mean, it just made sense. Like how a boy in kindergarten would pull a girls pigtail to get their attention. Plus if Harry did like Maloy, she could always ask Pansy if Draco felt the same as Harry did. (Pansy and Hermione had gotten closer since the Yule Ball when Pansy caught her crying after Ron had been a jerk, and they had been getting closer ever since.)
