Neville made a short choking noise. “Sorry, what?”
“No! No,” Draco stopped him, tightening his grip on the soft, worn collar. “Don’t take it off. I mean—eventually I’d like you to take it off, someday, but not now. I like it on you. It looks good. You… look good.”
“It’s none of my business.”
“What’s what?”
He didn’t hate them anymore, of course. He just didn’t quite know what to do with them.
“They’re your neighbours, Harry. Aren’t you even the slightest bit curious as to why they’re out here together?”
“I think it’s charming,” he said, voice fracturing the stale air. Beside him, Theo grunted under his breath.
“Noted,” Draco said, cranking up one of the knobs on the front of the stove and making the orange flame flare up dangerously. Harry left the room, thinking that maybe it wouldn’t hurt to go write his will just in case he really did end up dead by the end of the night.
“Yes you do, Potter! This—this weird thing you’re doing. One day I think you hate me—
They didn’t match. It wasn’t right. Harry couldn’t be attracted to him.
He’d spent the better part of the last two years cleaning up the orchard and restoring the house to its former glory, replacing the caving roof with new shingles, varnishing the hardwood floors, stripping down the peeling wallpaper, repainting the walls in earthy shades of green and yellow. When he showed it to Ron and Hermione after the place was finally furnished, they’d smiled and complimented him dutifully—but there was something else underneath their words. Something painful that Harry didn’t want to touch with a ten-foot pole.
“It’s not our home, but thanks,” Longbottom replied as he popped open a plump jade-colored bottle of wine in with his metal contraption, bent over the coffee table.
“I mean, only if Harry’s okay with it.” Pansy looked at Potter directly. “Are you okay with it? We haven’t been out for drinks in months. Not since we moved here, I think.”
“Where’s Draco?” she followed up, which was the last question he wanted to hear right now.
There was something squeezing Draco’s lungs. “Yes,” he said, refusing to let his voice waver. “On the train to Hogwarts. You—”
“Potter—”
—Potter happened.
“No. I’m not a Slytherin.”
Draco yawns, arm curling around Harry’s midsection reflexively, jaw clicking. “Too bad.”
The smile widens. “That’s precisely why.”
“Seconded,” Hermione said, her earrings clinking as she tipped her head back. “Do I still have feet? It feels like I don’t have feet anymore.”
She was half-leaning against the open door, one hand on the doorknob, the other wrapped around the frame; her hair was pinned back at the crown of her head with what seemed to be two coloured pencils, one blue and one yellow. A beige cardigan hung off her round shoulders and wrapped around her torso, unbuttoned at the top and tucked into the front of her skirt. She was certainly a sight for sore eyes—but she was also a sore sight for tired eyes.
Harry gave him the finger, and Malfoy stepped back from the threshold and let him inside.
Harry wiped his hands on the patterned dish towel hanging from the hook next to the sink. “It was Luna’s idea.”
Then, Potter did the unimaginable; he backed down. “Alright,” he said, raising his palms in surrender. “Fine. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. I’m not trying to pressure you, I just thought you might want to try.”
Draco shrugged a little. “I don’t know, it’s complicated. Why are you asking me this?”
What was truly strange was that—despite their new unofficial arrangement—Phoebe didn’t stop disappearing in the mornings. Her behavior was as consistent as the sun rising, and eventually, Harry just had to accept it for what it was—he didn’t have the time nor the temperament to trudge across the property line every morning in search of her. So he let her go. He didn’t understand
Draco’s eyes went wide. “Salazar, is it really? I should be getting back.”
“And drink lots of water,” Luna added meaningfully, reaching up to pat his cheek before he closed the door on them. “Take care of yourself. You deserve a break.”
“Going somewhere?” Neville asked sleepily when Harry came padding into the kitchen in search of his trainers, probably looking like a madman, given that he was wearing half-pajamas and half-winter gear.
“Did they?” Draco raised his brow, eyeing the bright blood-red drink skeptically. “I despise cherries.”
In late November, she helped him string up Christmas lights around his windows and along the railing of his front and back porch, making his house look magical in the ripe blue of dusk. Malfoy scoffed when he first saw them, muttering something snarky about “decorations in November” under his breath, but Harry just ignored him. It was getting both easier and harder to do that, now; easier in that Harry was getting used to his snarkiness, harder in that Harry was starting to involuntarily notice other things about him. Like, for example, the way his voice got smoother when he’d had two or more glasses of wine, or the way his thumb and his pinky finger stuck out when he put his hands in his trouser pockets, or the way his neck curved to meet the angled knot of his jaw. Harry also started paying more attention to the way his clothes were positioned on his body, how his white shirts were never wrinkled and his jumpers hung off his shoulders a bit, making him look all soft and round and strange.
Greg looked up from the television. “Harry Potter’s sitting on our porch?”
“The one about Phoebe. About why she’s been wandering off into Draco Malfoy’s backyard every morning.”
Of course, Draco didn’t know why Phoebe was so attached to him; it didn’t bother him anymore, now that he’d gotten used to it, but it was still an undeniably strange phenomenon. He didn’t even like dogs all that much—in full disclosure, he was more of a cat person—and yet he’d managed to form a bond with this animal without even trying. With all that considered, Draco didn’t blame Potter for being irritated. He had every right.
Draco blinked up from the label. “Pardon?”
Hermione’s eyes were kind and relieved. “We thought you might.”
“Luna,” Harry said with slow realisation. “Luna put you up to this.”
Potter shook his head, sitting back on the edge of the table. “It’s always been weak for me. I know I won it from you, but I don’t think its allegiance has ever fully changed.”
They exchanged vows under an archway made out of two blossoming apple trees whose branches were wound together loosely, shaking leaves down onto the happy couple as they slid shimmering gold rings onto each other’s fingers. Harry cried a bit and squeezed Draco’s hand; Draco gave him a handkerchief and told him to “get ahold of yourself, you great oaf,” and then Harry laughed, and his best friends were married, and everything was okay.
Potter—frozen, like a deer caught in headlights—swallowed visibly and issued a small, unsure, “I guess? But—”
“You think so?” Draco had asked gravely, dropping his small bag of clothing onto the floor and slumping down next to Greg on the squishy sofa.
“She’s only gone in the mornings?” Neville asked when Harry brought it up over dinner a few days and a few more disappearances later.
“...and this one’s name is Hecate,” Harry overheard Luna explaining to Pansy as the two of them leaned over the chicken coop, straw getting stuck to their fancy robes, while Neville was busy in the garden showing Greg and Theo how to water tulips correctly.
Malfoy, arms folded, simply replied, “Bite me.”
“No more kidnapping my dog,” Harry demanded, hooking one finger around Phoebe’s collar to keep her close to him.
Malfoy bent over his shoulder again to eye the sequence critically, brow knit. “Hm,” he grunted noncommittally.
“The stick-shaped one?”
Harry looked down at himself. “What’s wrong with my dungarees?”
It was Saturday, meaning it was farmers’ market day, and Harry was scheduled for a nine o’clock slot. Nev and Luna loved farmers’ market day more than he did; they were great with customers, and they didn’t mind hanging out together under a white spindly tent for two to three hours, feet kicked up on the fold-out counter, jackets zipped up to their chins. Harry was a little more impatient, and he tended to get skittish when the crowds got bigger towards the afternoon. But if he wanted to keep his mortgage, he had to sell at least half of what he harvested, so he tried not to complain.
Parkinson turned tired eyes on Harry. “Can we leave now?”
Draco lifted his head from where it was tilted against the cool glass of the window, knees drawn up to his chest. He didn’t answer, instead meeting Pansy’s gaze across the darkened room and nodding slightly.
“Yes, exactly, a wand tree. A tree that grows wands.”
“Pansy.” Malfoy turned to Parkinson, who was wearing a tight, shimmery black dress that looked far too thin for her to be wearing without a Warming Charm. “Tell him how ugly his dungarees are.”
“We—um.” Draco coughed a little and held out the tin. “We brought dessert. Greg made them.”
He thought about what Luna had said—how it only takes a moment to decide you love something. He wondered if that applied to other things besides Fleetwood Mac songs and shelter dogs; if it applied to people, too.
“Looks like she came back just in time for lunch,” Luna said, reaching out and fondly mussing up the long fur on her back.
Harry peered down at her, arching his brow. “Do you
Neville snorted, pointing at the television with his fork, a piece of steamed broccoli hanging off it. “She’s going to burn it,” he declared as a woman with tight grey curls appeared to completely forget about her sponge cake baking in the oven as she started on a lemon zest icing.
Draco thought, maybe, that might’ve been the best thing to happen all day.
“You do?” Draco asked, barely a whisper.
“You’re wearing my jumper,” he said breathlessly after Harry had opened his eyes, dazed and glittering.
It was bizarre.
Draco bit down on a frustrated sigh. “Glad we’ve cleared that up. What do you suggest we do, if neither of us want it? Shall we snap it in half? Set it on fire? Donate it to a museum?”
“Something like that,” Hermione confirmed. “Again, it’s only a theory, but familiars do everything for a reason, and the patterns you described to me just seemed a bit too on-the-nose to be coincidental. We think it’s possible that you and Draco have some sort of… magical link that only she could sense.”
He felt like his head was underwater.
“To talk to you,” Harry answered, raising his voice slightly so Draco could hear him.
She stepped back, but her hands were on his biceps, squeezing. Comforting, almost. She was still smiling, calm and effervescent. “I knew we’d run into each other again someday, I just didn’t realise it’d be this soon.”
Harry ducked his head back into his knees. “Yes,” he sighed, muffled.
“I think so.” Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry through his fringe. “I didn’t bring much.”
“The wards are in the basement,” Malfoy explained as he continued onward through the entryway of the depressing kitchen into an even more depressing living room, dominated by a frumpy sofa and a sagging coffee table that looked about a century old. There was also a tiny television set shoved into the corner, its antenna wonkily bent out of shape and its screen covered in fingerprints.
“Let’s just get this over with, please.”
, darling. Down.”
“Harry?” the voice came again, seeping up through the floorboards like bleeding honey. There was an ominous creak of wood followed by what sounded like footsteps, and Harry realised with delayed clarity that there was an intruder coming up the stairs.
Looking down at her, loose hairs fanned out around her face, her cheeks rosy and ripe with the glow of the morning, Harry couldn’t help but feel bad. “No,” he sighed, falling back next to her, knees knocking. “No, you don’t have to. But I really would like some more sleep—my day doesn’t start until seven at the earliest.”
“But at normal times,” Ron added meaningfully, pointing at him through the fire.
Pansy poked his foot with her own. “You need to eat something. I’m not going to let you get bad again over this stupid thing.”
After zipping up his jacket and tucking the ends of his trousers into his wellies, he beckoned Luna to meet him around the side of the house where the toolshed was. Leaning against the peeling, dilapidated clapboards were two adjustable ladders and a stack of woven baskets with cushions on the inside and a fabric strap for slinging over the shoulder. They grabbed one of each and hauled them together across the clearing to the first blooming grove of speckled trees, wet grass squelching under their feet. There were small puddles of week-old rainwater gathered at the roots of the trees, brown and foggy.
“Draco,” Harry said, so soft he almost missed it, “I want you to know that I’m about to do something tremendously stupid. Maybe the stupidest thing I’ve ever done.”
Draco stared at him incredulously. “You really want to traipse all the way next door just to have an awkward conversation with people who
Harry, who was in the middle of grabbing a short stack of bowls from the mahogany hutch in the hallway, called back exasperatedly, “You have to use magic."
“I hate that he can make me feel this way,” she’d said after the worst of the tremors had subsided, sounding defeated, leaning on Harry’s shoulder as the cold tiles bled through their clothes.
“She’s always been a weird one,” Ron agreed, now leaning half his weight against Hermione’s shoulder, gaze unfocused. He had a reddish pillow crease cutting along one cheek, disrupting his splash of freckles.
His lips thinned and he looked away. He was nervous. “I don’t know how to do this,” he admitted eventually, squinting against a slight brush of wind. Not looking at Draco.
“Maybe she’s going through puberty,” Luna suggested one afternoon, perched on the porch railing. “That’s a thing for dogs, isn’t it?”
“Indeed.”
“Maybe not, but it wouldn’t hurt to try.”
“We’re trying to say that your dog sensed Draco’s magic and was attracted to it,” Hermione explained simply. “She was the one to lead you over there in the first place, wasn’t she?”
“And risk breaking our wards again? Thank you for the offer, but I’ll pass.” Draco heaved himself off the sofa, wobbling a bit when he was fully upright. “I can walk. See?” He took two steps forward, lurching a bit and not really proving his point.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, breaking into that horrible smile of his that turned Draco’s insides into goo.
“Warm-blooded,” she reminded him, spinning back towards the mirror and adjusting her neckline. “Do you think I could get Potter to cast a Warming Charm on me? I bet his Warming Charms are phenomenal.”
“Come along, Emerson,” Pansy chirped to the dog as she slipped her flip flops on. Draco rolled his eyes, but decided to let it slide this once as they turned and started back in the direction of the house, the little, speckled dog following close at their heels.
“Come to break our wards again?” he asked loudly, folding his arms against the cold and leveling Harry with a crafted deadpan.
“And you, Hermione,” Luna replied, smiling angelically while the neon-tinted lights played over her face. “How’s everything with you? How’s the Ministry?”
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes again by stuffing his wand back into his pocket. “Not my fault you can’t do magic, Malfoy.”
Malfoy shrugged carelessly. “No promises.”
“These will do fine,” Draco assured, pulling the elf-made bottle closer so he could read the label. He expected Potter to sit back down and maybe pop the cork on the daisy wine, but for some reason he remained standing, hands curled bracingly over the back of his chair.
he’d lent them over at all, but he didn’t really mind. Neville looked better in them than he did, anyway.
“Shit,” she sighed. “That’s not good, is it?”
“Liar,” Harry said, leaning against Draco’s shoulder heavily. “Let’s not talk about him right now, yeah? I’m enjoying myself.”
“What about Theo?” Pansy asked, eyes narrowed and searching. “Was he in your brain when you were with Theo?”
He was startled awake painstakingly early in the morning by the familiar thud of the front door and a voice shouting his name up the stairwell, loud and boisterous.
“Hm,” Draco hummed lowly, shifting in his seat. “I can understand that, I suppose. Your life seems exhausting.”
“Is now the right time?” he asked, lifting his head and meeting Potter’s deep juniper gaze.
“Is it still happening?” Granger asked, brows knitting together.
Harry followed him, trying to hold in another sneeze, but failing. There must have been a whole foot of dust coating the flagstone floor and the ancient-looking shelves, all of which were completely empty. There was a spiky metal thing on the opposite wall that Harry thought might be an old-timey furnace, but he wasn’t completely sure. He didn’t even know if wizard houses needed furnaces in the first place.
“I’m sorry, Luna, I just—” he frowned and rubbed at his temples. “I know you were trying to be nice, but I can’t deal with them. Not—not today.”
It was odd, Harry thought, being a dog person. That’s what Ginny called him last time she’d visited, which had to have been—what, a year ago? Almost a year? He couldn’t remember. Point is, she’d called him a dog person, offhanded and casual, a small smile on her freckled face tinged pink with wine. It caught Harry off guard, and he’d thought to himself,
The backyard was—well. Overgrown, for one. Green, for another. Untamed and clearly unregulated. There were trees on all sides, blooming in rich shades of orange and yellow that staunchly reminded Draco of Wiltshire in autumn, of the manicured trees that had neatly lined the gravel drive of the Manor once upon a time. A small dirt path cut through the garden like an artery, crowded in by tall, swaying grass and budding wildflowers; in the near distance a fountain shaped like a mermaid gurgled faintly, her arms winding skyward like a ballet dancer.
“Is she here?” he’d asked, low and pleading.
But, still, regardless of the incident, Potter was acting weird; he was being clumsier than usual and spacing out at odd intervals. It was peculiar, and unsettling, and also incredibly endearing, which Draco just fucking hated. He didn’t understand how Potter could go around making the strangest things endearing, like wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve or tracing little shapes in the condensation on his water glass. He ate like he was a small child, picking out all the carrots from the soup and putting them to the side of his plate until he’d finished the noodles and broth, and Draco couldn’t help but watch him the entire time with poorly-concealed interest.
Draco stared at them a moment longer, then grunted and said, “Merlin, fine, since you’re both so bloody stubborn.”
“No,” Potter said. “Snapping it in half.”
Luna surveyed the Slytherins for a moment, then decided, “I’ll take Pansy and Theodore, you take Draco. Will that work?”
Harry blinked. “Really?”
“Merlin and Morgana both.” Malfoy’s eyes rolled up to the ceiling, like he couldn’t stand to look at Harry in the face. “I can’t believe I’m letting you do this.”
“How long is this check-up lasting for, exactly?” Harry asked, folding his arms over his torso protectively.
“There’s got to be a way,” Pansy had insisted. “The Ministry isn’t
“Unfortunately, he still has magic, so I seriously doubt it,” Draco said. “And since when did you start caring about his health?”
“Not anymore,” Luna pointed out, folding her hands over her stomach. There was a straw-colored strand of hair cutting across her cheek, so Harry brushed it out of the way carefully, and she flashed a brief smile in his direction.
“You just don’t use it,” Potter concluded, leaning back in his chair.
“I know, that’s why they reminded me of you.”
Maybe all this time—buried deep under dense layers of hatred and frustration and war—maybe Harry had known this was a possibility. Maybe he’d hoped. But he hadn’t gotten a chance to explore any of that. He hadn't gotten a chance to explore anything, really; his mind had been on one track, and Draco had been an obstacle on that track.
“I’m making a political move,” Draco informed her, then stretched down to pat the half-asleep dog gently on her head. “No animals will be harmed in the process, I promise.”
He couldn’t say he wasn’t regretting it, but he also couldn’t say he wasn’t mildly enjoying himself. The Slytherins were odd but interesting company; Parkinson had been dominating the narrative all night, asking question after question about Neville’s education and Luna’s apprenticeship. She’d asked Harry a few questions as well, but he could tell she wasn’t exactly jumping out of her seat to talk to him. Neither were Nott, or Goyle, or Malfoy; Goyle had barely said a word since he walked in, only nodding along to the conversation and letting out slight grunts every once in a while. Nott chimed in a polite amount, each word clearly calculated to sound agreeable but not enthusiastic, like he was afraid of showing too much emotion. Malfoy, on the other hand—Harry didn’t really know what was up with Malfoy. He talked quite a bit, but only as a sidebar to Parkinson’s questions. He never prompted anything or brought up any new topics.
“Your familiar,” Ron said tiredly. “They’re, like, semi-magical entities that latch onto wizards or witches and assist them with magic or guide them. They’re a bit rare, though, aren’t they, ‘Mione?”
“There we go,” Draco repeated mildly, staring at the remains of his wand like he’d never seen it before. It was hard to believe that this was the wand that had chosen him all those years ago. That this was the wand he’d cast a thousand
Potter levelled a long, calculating look at him, then nodded and stood from his chair. “Probably. Let me check.”
“Me too,” Theo jumped in, clearly anxious to say something before his silence got weirder. Greg didn’t add anything, but he nodded his head stiffly, like a puppet on a wire.
She gave him a look. “Come on. Talk to me.”
“Sober adjacent,” Ron corrected importantly.
Later, when Harry finally manages to fall asleep, it's to thoughts of the morning dawning blue and beautiful. It's to the even breath of Draco in his ear. It's to the metal band around Draco's finger, gleaming amid the black, holding sweet, saccharine promises. It’s to patterns of moonlight playing on the backs of Harry's eyelids and car horns honking in the near distance, filling him up, making him whole.
“You can’t kidnap my dog.”
“Harry,” came Hermione’s soft voice from behind him. “Are you alright?”
Draco leaned his head back against the glass. “If I ate anything I think it’d just come right back up. I wouldn’t want Greg’s macaroni to end up in the toilet.”
“Mm,” Harry said, bobbing his head in understanding. “Not a bad idea. Are you okay to walk, or d’you need a Side-Along?”
With some difficulty, Luna hauled herself out of the henhouse and followed his gaze, looking around at the flattened clearing. “Around here somewhere,” she said airily, using her hand to shield her eyes from the sun. “I took her on the trail that loops around the herb garden, but she sort of wandered off when we got back.”
“Can I have my dog back, now?”
Phoebe let out a short, pleading whimper from Draco’s lap, as if she was also reluctant to get back. Harry gave her a scolding look for siding with the enemy, then succumbed to their insistent gazes with a leveling sigh. “Fine. Five more minutes.”
if you so desire! i promise i don't bite :)
“Maybe.” Harry looked around the joint, squinting into the darkened corners where leather-upholstered booths were shoved together, keeping an eye out for bright red or bushy brown hair. “Are they here yet?”
“Are you happy?” Harry asked, breaking the serene near-silence.
Pansy narrowed her eyes. “Draco.”
“Okay,” Harry said, praying to Godric that Draco couldn’t hear the way his heart was slamming against his chest, pounding in his ears. “Fine. I don’t even care that much. Have a good night, Malfoy.”
“I’m serious, Potter.”
“Are you?” Parkinson inquired, leaning on her elbows. “I wasn’t aware of that.”
“Couldn’t find her,” he said, out of breath and panting. Luna frowned.
“You don’t know that!”
Harry hadn’t even had time to greet them before Luna had barreled inside and gasped with delight. “Oh, Harry, it’s lovely here!” she’d exclaimed, twirling around the saffron-painted kitchen and running her hands along the sunken velvet armchairs in the living room.
Malfoy held the door for them, throwing one last brackish sneer at Harry before letting it fall closed behind him, effectively shutting out the cold morning. Suddenly, the room felt big again.
“Mhm. Scared the shit out of me at the time, but I think I’m getting used to her, finally.”
“I know. I trust you.”
Draco moves so his head is tucked above Harry’s, encircling him so completely that he feels like he’s a hatchling being tucked under the wing of a bird. The lights from the city make patterns on the ceiling, and in the distance, the tires of a car screech.
Another honk sounded, followed by the sputtering rev of the car engine, so he shook himself and started to jog back, tendrils of hair slipping out from his tie and spilling into his face annoyingly. “No dog?” Neville asked when he finally reached the car and folded himself into the front seat where Neville had just moved from.
“Is that all?” Harry asks into the not-silence.
“Luna Lovegood,” he replied slowly, breathless and tight, walking on eggshells.
“Everyone leaves a key under the mat, Harry,” she cut him off blithely. “It’s human nature at this point.”
“Is that it, there?” Malfoy asked, reaching his hand over Harry’s shoulder and pointing at a small gap in the sequence where the runes were faded and dull.
“Hey, Luna,” he said after a slow moment, squinting slightly as he scanned the yard. “Where’s Phoebe?”
He realised a second too late that he’d crossed the official property line, and a sudden, sharp fear gripped him. Surely Phoebe wouldn’t have gone this far without him? She’d never done anything like that before. She barely used to leave the bed without him persuading her with the promise of food.
warning for mentions of death threats towards the middle of the chapter; nothing graphic. see "more notes" if you need to know what parts to skip over <3
“Well,” Potter said, straightening up and brushing his hands on his jeans. “There we go.”
Granger, considering him carefully for the first time all evening, frowned. “And she’s been there since day one?”
“If you say so,” Harry allowed, not wanting to argue despite his skepticism. He followed Draco’s lead anyway, levering himself off the sofa and balancing his weight against one of its arms while blood rushed to his head. As Draco started off down the hall, Harry plucked their near-empty Mason jars from the coffee table and wobbled into the kitchen, dropping them into the sink unceremoniously. The floorboards in the corridor creaked gently, followed by a rhythmic clicking of paws that signalled the movement of Phoebe. Knowing her, she was probably shadowing Draco towards the foyer, her eyes large and pleading for him to stay.
Draco held the piece of hawthorn out. Potter blinked at it, then up at Draco, a frown pulling at his lips. “I’m not taking that from you.”
“Nothing they haven’t done to us.”
“We would be trespassing.”
“Do you find him attractive?”
a few times, huddled under a knit blanket with his fingers wrapped around a scalding hot mug of cocoa—the cabbage mug, to be exact—and cried a bit at the airport scene like he always did. Then he rewound it and cried a little more the second time.
Potter ignored him. “Is Phoebe up there with you?”
“What made you so adamant on being alone tonight?”
“I need you to tell me your theory,” Harry said quickly, words coming out all jumbled and clumsy.
Ron’s eyebrows jumped up. “How’d you manage that? He’s been attached to your hip all day.”
“I can.”
“So?!”
Hermione had nodded, and then they went out into the backyard without Harry and started walking through the rows of snow-covered apple trees, Ron’s hands in his pockets, Hermione’s gripping her elbows. Harry had watched them from the kitchen window, feeling something warm and relieved expand in his chest when they stopped in the middle of the orchard and embraced each other, Ron’s chin resting on top of her unbraided, frizzy hair, Hermione’s nose digging into his collarbone.
And he wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either—Malfoy seemed just as frustrated and confused with the civil Friday evenings spent in front of Harry’s fire as Harry was. He even went as far as to corner Harry in the kitchen one night, swaying a bit and blinking under the feeble overhead lighting, clearly tipsy. “Listen,” he said, putting two hands on the wooden countertop. “Can we talk?”
“Where’s Phoebe?”
“Just me and Neville,” Luna piped up, her head in Harry’s lap and feet propped up on the hearth. “He doesn’t pay us, though.”
“I don’t—”
Draco broke first, pulling his head back and batting his eyelashes open while his heartbeat thumped in the floorboards below his feet. His hands were on Harry’s collarbone now, and he hadn’t the faintest clue as to when they’d got there. He didn’t move them, staring now at the dark cashmere that was wrinkled under his fingertips.
Harry wrinkled his nose, thinking briefly of his aunt Petunia, then shook the image away in favor of stabbing a clump of pasta and twirling it around his fork. He was determinedly trying not to make too much eye contact with the Slytherins, afraid that doing so would be the potential catalyst for a fist fight. He hated how they were sitting in his living room and eating his food—the living room that he’d furnished all on his own, the living room that he ate and slept in, the living room that was far more intimate than any other room in his house—but he was also determined to make Luna happy.
“Whatever,” Pansy said, dismissing Draco with another wave of her hand. “I’m calling her Emerson and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
Potter’s lips turned up. “That’s up to you, I think.”
There wasn’t anything wrong with being a dog person, it’s just that Harry had never been a dog-person before. He’d never been an anything-person before. He’d barely been a person-person most of his life. So it was weird hearing that come out of Ginny’s mouth, but it wasn’t necessarily unpleasant. He thought he could be a dog person if he wanted to be.
“How the fuck would you know? Molly’s never let you have a house plant, let alone a dog. She told me you tried watering a cactus one time and nearly killed it.”
Neville looked surprised. “But, Phoebe—”
This thing. Whatever’s going on here.”
“Yes,” Draco repeated, feeling his ears go hot. “Why are we clarifying this?”
“I don’t care!” Harry exploded, clomping up the wooden steps and holding tight to the railing so he wouldn’t do something rash, like hex Malfoy’s ears off. “I’m not playing games with you. If you couldn’t tell, we’re not in school anymore, and I’m not going to put up with your shit.”
“You—” Neville stared at him. “Harry, are you feeling okay?”
“Potter,” Draco said before he could stop himself, his tongue with a mind of its own.
He almost wished he missed it; it would’ve been an easy thing to do, given the jagged shadows and congregation of aluminum bins that theoretically should have blocked his view. There were bodies shifting against the far wall of the alley, and Harry should have just ignored them, but a hitched gasp and a flash of platinum hair locked him suddenly and unwillingly into place.
“I do. The Silk Dragon, right?”
“A sick man,” Harry echoed nonsensically, shaking his head and dropping his handful of silverware onto the dining table. “Fine, whatever. I don’t even know why I’m arguing. Try not to set my house on fire, please.”
For the second time that evening, Draco wondered how exactly they’d gotten here. “Ready.”
“One...” Potter started.
“I don’t care.” Draco popped the lid to the container of soup, swirling it around a few times before beginning to pour it into the pot. “You’ll get in my way. Go lie down, or read a book, or something. Go be a sick man.”
Parkinson—who Harry couldn’t actually tell was drunk or not—simply quirked her eyebrow at him. “Concerned for my safety, Weasley?”
“Yeah, alright.” Harry nodded affirmatively, then pushed off the wall with a heaving effort, trying not to stumble over the chipped pavement. The street was mostly empty, washed out by the flat yellow streetlights and carved with shadow. Even though he was outside, he could still feel the music vibrating his bones, making his vision pulse as he rounded the sharp corner into the alley and abruptly stumbled onto something he probably wasn’t meant to see.
One tilt up, and Harry could do something he’d never dreamt was possible. Just one tilt—
Harry blinked, alarmed. “Those are real things? Like, actually?”
,” he breathed, hand on his chest. “You scared me.”
“Half past six.”
He turned the faucet off, listening to the steady stream of water turn into a slow drip, hitting the metal basin of the sink with soft
Draco, Theo, and Greg all swiveled to look at her, uncomprehending. “Who?” Greg asked.
The front burner flared up, causing Draco to awkwardly jerk backwards into Harry. “
“Leopards,” Luna said, face breaking into a slow sunrise of a smile. “They would’ve been leopards. Her favorite animal.”
“There are about a million things wrong with your dungarees, none of which I have the time or patience to relay to you. Do you really not have anything else? Anything at all?”
“No,” Luna replied to Neville cheerfully, swaying her head to the sunny rhythm undulating from the radio and cracking her window open so the smell of the wind and the countryside bled into the car.
Draco froze, which was a near-impossible thing to do in the middle of a crowd of writhing bodies. “Wait, what?”
Draco, Draco, Draco.
Hermione’s eyes were wide and frazzled, her skin tinted slightly green from the light of the fire. “What could you possibly need at one in the morning that isn’t emergency related?”
“You asked me to fix yours, so I’ll try and fix yours. But I can’t promise anything.”
“We’re on the run from the Ministry,” he said, staring fixedly at Harry with the same steeliness he’d had the other day. Everyone in the room seemed to shrink with those words, leaving only Harry and Malfoy to mow each other down with iron-forged gazes.
“On three?” Draco asked, breath puffing out white in the frigid darkness.
“Oh, okay, yeah, found it.” Without warning, Neville Longbottom appeared in the hall, holding a metal contraption that Draco assumed was the bottle opener. He seemed to pale a bit at the sight of Draco and the rest, but he quickly shook it off and plastered on a placid smile. “Hello. Living room’s through this way.”
He picked up a rounded pebble near his shoe, weighing it in his hands as he squinted up at the window, a soft strip of orange skewing through the darkness and planting a seed on the fertile black sky.
“Hey,” came a smooth voice from over Draco’s shoulder, breaking him from his daze. All at once, the noise of the vibrating music and pitched laughter came flooding back, like a bubble had just been popped around his ears. He turned, swaying slightly, and found Theo standing directly in front of him, a thin sheen of sweat glazing his forehead.
“None of your business,” Parkinson snapped suddenly, a look of instant regret passing over her face less than a second later. “Shit, I—sorry. It’s—Draco’s right, we haven’t done anything illegal. That’s all you need to know.”
They’d all been sitting around the dining table when Harry came stumbling down the stairs, which was certainly a sight to behold that early in the morning; it was rare for them to be all in one place, and witnessing it made Harry’s heart expand tenfold. It was almost,
surprised Draco.
“How did you even know I was awake?”
gone.”
“Luna,” he said again, “you were the one that stopped me in the first place.”
Draco’s heart rate spiked and he exchanged a sharp glance with Pansy. He’d been wondering where Weasley and Granger had been all this time, but he’d been far too wary to ask after them.
There was silence as Harry covered the hole, the snow-softened dirt soiling up the toes and laces of his trainers. When it was done, he took a step back and rooted his hands in his pockets; there was a slight breeze tumbling through the dark, ruffling the greenery and pushing his hair into his eyes.
“You sure?”
out of the runic time period, but yes. That would be my guess.”
“That’d be my guess.”
“Ah.” Draco grimaced, gaze straying to his forearm. “Right. I forgot about him.”
Theo shook his head and began moving away, stepping over a clump of daisies so he could stand in the centre of the clearing. “Pansy went swimming down at the ravine again.”
“Draco.”
She shrugged loftily and rocked forward on her bare feet. “A little dirt never hurt anyone.”
Happy to let Luna do her thing, Harry collapsed into one of the beige wicker rocking chairs and tucked into his own cup of tea, the rich steam curling white in the still blue daybreak. Despite the early sun blanketing the backyard with a warm, yellow sheen, the air was cold and damp, residual frost clinging to the wood railing of the porch. The faded metal bird feeders hanging from the cross beams creaked and swung faintly in the breeze.
“Did I?” she asked, gaze wide and blue, pinned on the wand in his hand. She didn’t seem nearly as fazed as most people would have, but then again, this was Luna. “Goodness, sorry about that. I didn’t mean to.”
Theo turned away from the table, apparently deciding to ignore him. “Whatever. I’m going.”
“The fact that we can’t do magic is all the more reason to have them up.” Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “Not to mention that I distinctly remember telling you that they were up before we arrived here.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he turned this new slew of information over and over in his head, heart beating at the speed of light. “I like your theory better.”
Potter snapped his fingers knowingly. “And anyone who gets released from Azkaban has their wand tracked.
“It’s too loud here,” he adds a long moment later.
“Oh my god,” Draco groaned, falling backwards onto Pansy’s bed. “I hate you so bloody much. I can’t believe you roped us into this.”
“Everyone okay?” Luna asked them, switching gears and earning another bout of giggles from Hermione.
She slipped inside and closed the door carefully behind her, handle clicking, then made her way slowly across the room and to the cushioned window seat where Draco was curled.
ripped through the darkness. Potter pulled his hands away sharply and the wand clattered to the ground, splintered and broken. There was a small plume of silver smoke, released from the chipped edges of the wand like an exhale into the still evening air.
“I’m not fucking bartering with you!”
“Harry,” she said pointedly.
Even though the whole scene was a little rundown and waterlogged, it was charming and mystical in a quaint kind of way, like it’d been plucked out of a storybook and left to the wild for twenty years. With a few wood-restoring spells and a string of fairy lights, the bridge could look as sturdy and magical as it probably once did, the willow trees arching artfully towards it, their leaves brushing the river and reflecting shades of deep green across the crystalline surface. He smiled a bit as he pictured rowing a Venetian gondola down the stream while singing a barcarolle, instructing Neville and Luna to make a wish as they passed under the arch of the bridge. He dismissed the fantasy before he could begin to fixate on it; the stream was much too small for a gondola, anyway.
“What?” Harry asked, uncomprehending. “I—this is my kitchen, Malfoy.”
Hermione smiled again, eyes crinkling, but there was something sad in there as she met Harry’s gaze. “Anyways, enough about me, we’ll have plenty of time to talk about this when we’re sober. We were talking about you.”
“I know.” Pansy touched his hair lightly, brushing it away from his forehead.
Of course, how didn’t I guess that.”
“But they don’t have magic,” Luna pointed out, then tilted her head thoughtfully. “Though I’m not sure if not being able to perform magic would get rid of their individual magical signatures. I’ll have to look into that.”
Parkinson’s brow scrunched. “Having trouble with full sentences, Potter?”
Harry ignores him. “Tell me about our home,” he says instead, placing his hands over Draco’s. “Our new one without cars or taxis.”
“Serious question.” Harry squinted at his reflection, then swiped a hand through his fringe to push it out of his eyes. He paused, then backtracked. “I mean—not attractive as in you’re attracted
“Potter,” Draco said with sharp frustration, prompting Harry to look up from the table and meet his scalding pewter gaze. “I’m serious. You make me crazy.”
a decision, he definitely made the right one.
While Luna dragged Neville outside to go meet the baby chicks, Harry pulled on his favorite cords and laced up his boots in anticipation of the long-ish walk to his car, parked at the bottom of the hill where the river split. He stared at himself in the mirror over his wardrobe, narrowing his eyes critically at the coils of hair that stuck out over his eyes and at the back of his head, then grabbed a yellow elastic to pull it all back away from his face. He could probably ask Luna to help cut it later.
“No, but I’m just saying,” Pansy stated. “It makes sense, doesn’t it? That she would belong to wizards?”
A loud honk sounded from the bottom of the hill, followed by a shouted, “Harry! We’re going to be late!” and Harry looked at his watch. It was ten until nine, and the market was fifteen minutes away. Shit.
“I—” Draco took a breath. “Of course I do, but I can’t.”
“You—” Harry blinked again, harder, re-disoriented. Jesus, what a morning. “Luna,” he restarted, trying his absolute best to sound polite. “You—not that you’re not welcome, or anything, but why are you here? At six in the bloody morning?”
Harry wasn’t sure why Ron and Hermione had chosen this place in particular to meet up, given there was a perfectly pleasant pub just around the corner that served vegan snack mixes and played Bowie over the loudspeakers, but he wasn’t going to question it. It was entirely possible that they didn’t get out enough in London, what with their highly demanding work schedules, so Harry was perfectly happy to give them an exciting night out if that’s what they wanted.
Pansy burst abruptly into laughter, loud and disbelieving as Draco shrugged his jacket on.
“Madam Malkin’s,” Harry interrupted again, and suddenly he was only one step down from Draco. Inches away. The closest they’d been in a long, long time. “We met at Madam Malkin’s. You don’t remember?”
Draco folded his arms. “No.”
Luna just flashed her teeth at him and sighed, “Oh, Harry,” in that way she did, and the next thing he knew, he was making scrambled eggs for her the following morning while
Malfoy was the one pressed against the wall, his head tilted up and exposing an alabaster strip of skin that was under the command of another sandy-haired man that Harry instinctively knew was Nott. The gasp had to have come from Malfoy, because his eyes were now latched onto Harry’s, wide and grey and full of something that Harry didn’t recognise. Something intense and untamed.
“Tell me about what it looks like. Where it is.”
“Potter—”
Harry’s smile widened, but he ducked his head down so Draco couldn’t see it and poke fun at him. “You’re very welcome.”
“Harry? Harry, are you home?”
“But nothing. I won’t force you to eat right this second, but I want you to have something before you go to sleep. Promise me you’ll at least try?”
Potter blinked, then cast a look around the room, meeting Draco’s gaze for a fleeting moment. “Er. I mean, she didn’t really specify, but she knows that I’ve been having people over. So—”
“What’s that all about, anyway?” Harry griped, tugging himself up his own ladder and adjusting the basket slung precariously over his shoulder. “Did every single one of them get their magic taken by the Ministry? And if so, wouldn’t their parole have ended by now?”
Draco grimaced. “Yes.”
Harry knew exactly where she’d gone. “Thank you,” he told Hermione before squeezing her shoulder gratefully and stepping fully off the porch, purposefully missing the last two stairs. It took him longer than necessary to weave through the dispersed congregation of tables and guests, people stopping him every few steps and telling him what a beautiful home he had or what a funny speech he gave. Eager to get away from the crowd and find out what exactly Draco was doing, Harry smiled and nodded his way to the edge of the clearing where he could surreptitiously duck onto the path. He could still hear voices and laughter even after the clearing had disappeared from sight, seeming to follow him through the tangled trees and down the well-worn trail.
“Certainly not,” Pansy said seriously, then cracked a tiny, sly grin. “Even though that’s the biggest lie I’ve ever heard come out of your mouth.”
He sighed. “I walked into that one. What’s happening? Is there coffee?”
“Oh,” he said softly, staring at the ring. “Oh, ‘Mione.”
“That’s so fucking weird,” Weasley laughed; Draco had forgotten how loud his voice was. “Have you taken her to the vet recently? Maybe she’s gone loopy or something.”
“Fine,” Malfoy repeated, then proceeded to spin around and slam the door shut, leaving Harry alone on the porch, dripping wet.
“Oh, I’ve noticed,” Draco said with a curt laugh. “She doesn’t keep it a secret. You know she hugged me the first time we saw her?”
“I see you’ve brought your whole motley crew,” she observed. “Luna, it’s lovely to see you.”
“No, you’re not,” Malfoy sneered.
“You’re making it very hard for us to believe you haven’t done anything illegal,” Neville said lightly.
“You’re welcome,” Harry replied slowly, and then Goyle turned away and continued to water his dying tulips with his empty watering can. Harry thought that could be symbolic of something, but he wasn’t sure what.
That caused a standstill. Heads swiveled to look at Harry through the haze, Parkinson’s eyes like bullets and Malfoy’s like glass beads, glossy and wide.
“Of course not! She’s a delight.”
“Disappointing,” Parkinson sighed, popping a piece of steamed squash into her mouth. “I didn’t even realise they had higher education for wizards, let alone things like herbology. It does sound fascinating, though, even without bells.”
“There’s nothing to explain.”
Silence. Then, “Incredibly.” There was a soft rustle, and suddenly Phoebe was laying her head restlessly across Draco’s lap, like she couldn’t possibly get close enough to him. Harry could sympathise with her on that front. Draco smiled at her and reached down to scratch between her ears. “I think your dog might be in love with me.”
“That’s the one,” Lovegood said, clearly not sensing the immense atmospherical shift, reaching down to scratch the dog again. “Phoebe belongs to him, so it makes sense that he was the most worried out of all of us. He went out this morning looking for her.”
s. He took a breath in through his nose, holding it at the top of his lungs like Hermione taught him to do, and by the time he released, he was ready to face the music.
“Bizarre,” Pansy said wondrously. “Should we have given her a name by now?”
“You’re putting words into her mouth,” she rebutted, crouching down to set the dish on the top step and smiling wide when Phoebe scrambled up to reach it, ears and tail immediately perking up. “That’s it, good girl,” Luna cooed, patting her head. She glanced up at Harry. “What do you think she was doing in that part of the orchard? You don’t go over there much.”
“You know what’s on my mind.”
“Not an emergency,” Harry cut her off. “I’m so sorry for waking you, I just—I really need something.”
“No more breaking my wards,” Malfoy shot back, refusing to meet his gaze.
“I am not! I tried to be diplomatic by making you an offer, and you turned me down. Therefore
He wasn’t depressed, or anything; he’d been depressed before and it hadn’t felt like this, not in the same way. He just felt—fragile. Tender, maybe. Like he was a bruise on the knee of a child who’d tripped at a playground. Who’d been knocked over by someone bigger, or stronger, or more careless.
“She’s a pain in the ass.”
“Please shut up, now.”
“You look lovely.” Lovegood held out her hand amicably. Pansy shook it, shoulders back and chin lifted, but Draco didn’t miss the way she went a little red around the ears.
Ending up in Bedfordshire had been a stroke of good luck amid their scramble between dwellings and 40-hour workweeks—it was the first house in nearly three years they hadn’t needed to pay for. It was the first house that was so removed from the wizarding world that it was practically an oasis. Walking through the front door all those months ago had felt like surfacing from a grimy pool of anxiety and hardship, and the house had wrapped around them like a warm blanket. For once in his life, Draco had felt absolutely sure that everything was going to be okay.
Harry felt like he had mental whiplash. He couldn’t be attracted to Draco. That wasn’t allowed. He hated Draco, and Draco hated him; that’s how it worked. That was their thing, and it was fine. Good, even. They weren’t built to like each other. They were fundamentally different down to their very cores, molten and hot, and there was no way on Earth they could ever begin to move beyond that.
And it was fine, for a while. Loud and greasy and depressing, yes, but fine. Better than prison. Better than war.
“But how are we only finding out now?” Draco asked uncomfortably, shifting against the stiff wood of his dining chair. He would give at least a hundred Galleons for one of the high-backed chairs with squishy cushions and curved armrests that used to sit around the informal dining room in the Manor, charmed to mold perfectly to anyone who sat in them. But, alas, he didn’t have a hundred Galleons. “We’ve been here for nearly a whole week. Surely we would’ve noticed if we had magical neighbours.”
He could get up, though. He could pull himself out of his reverie if he needed to. He didn’t need help.
Harry snorted lightly and shifted the car out of park, gravel crunching under the tyres as he began to pull out of the driveway. Neville flipped to a station that was playing something by Fleetwood Mac, and Luna immediately perked up. “Oh, I love this song,” she said excitedly, brushing Neville’s hand out of the way so she could dial up the volume.
He wished he were surprised that the lump didn’t move, but he wasn’t; Phoebe was about the single laziest sheepdog on the planet, and she didn’t like to do things if there wasn’t a guaranteed reward. One of those things was, apparently, protecting her one and only owner from trespassers.
There was silence. The night breeze was sharp and cold, stinging Draco’s bare forearms.
of crazy, of course. That was up to interpretation.
The Ministry had declared that they could provide housing to him for two months while he searched for a job and got back on his feet. “Housing” was a generous term, though; for those two months they’d stuck Draco in a room the size of a broom cupboard, with one window and one bed that was so frail it could barely support his weight. He’d still taken it— he didn’t exactly have any other options.
“Harry,” Draco says, eyes still closed. Fingers still curled into the fabric of Harry’s shirt.
“Oh, isn’t it fascinating?” she gushed. “I had no idea Muggles knew so much about Hellenic polytheism.”
“Quick,” Theo agreed, gaze like fire. “I can do quick.”
Neville smiled blearily and gave him a thumbs-up. “Good luck. Don’t get eaten by a rabid colony of dogs.”
Draco didn’t normally believe in such things, but it was hard not to when he was living smack dab in the middle of a fairytale. It was especially hard not to when, fifteen minutes until two in the morning, something sharp pinged off of Draco’s bedroom window, and he knew exactly who had thrown it.
It almost sounded like he was daring one of the Slytherins to say something snooty, either about his cooking or his lack of furniture. But Draco couldn’t blame him for the furniture thing, and linguine did sound quite good. If he wanted snooty, he wasn’t giving Draco much material to work off of.
“It’s not, but okay,” Draco rebutted, feeling a muted kind of jealousy swirl up in his head. He’d always wanted a crup when he was little—he’d asked for one every single Christmas for at least six years—but his father was allergic to pretty much any animal with fur, so that was that. His mother had tried giving him a pet gecko in compensation, but it’d escaped about a week later. Draco never saw it again.
“Sit anywhere you like,” Lovegood said, easing herself onto the arm of the sofa and casting her own over the room, as if presenting a piece of artwork. There was a plentiful cheese platter complete with grapes, sliced apple, and dehydrated dates sitting nicely in the center of the coffee table, surrounded by stray books and empty glass flutes. It was hard not to be impressed by the presentation of it all—even though that was the last thing Draco wanted to do.
Encouraged by that glance, Draco lifted his chin and spoke up, “We’ve got nothing to do with it.” Heads turned in his direction, and he tried not to squirm. “I mean, we haven’t been leaving food out or anything like that. She just keeps showing up out of the blue.”
Draco felt too paralysed to say anything. Greg was staring, slack-jawed.
“Draco,” Harry says after a while, hoping that the other man hasn’t fallen asleep yet.
“Harry,” he announced blearily when Hermione dragged him down in front of the hearth. “Mate, I love you, but this is bloody ridiculous.”
“Coming, Pans?” Theo asked with amusement as he twisted the silver handle and opened the back door, a gush of cold air spilling in behind him.
“You’re horrible,” Draco informed him. “A horrible, horrible friend. I didn’t even know cherry cocktails existed.”
“So… noon-ish?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I hate to break it to you, but the Manor is about twenty times bigger than this place. My house doesn’t even have a wards compartment, let alone an entire room.”
“Harry,” Hermione had said with the same exact frown the real estate wizard had. “You’ll be so far away from London. Are you absolutely sure?”
“I like my version better,” Potter said, amusement glinting in his eyes. Draco felt his cheeks go warm.
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling softly to himself. “She can be like that. She likes you, though. All of you.”
“Let me rephrase. Are you trying to be arrested for destruction of private property?”
to guard the house.”
He hadn’t known what to say to that. “Sure they do,” he tried, sounding suddenly meek. It felt like a lie, but he wasn’t sure it was.
“And leave Potter unsupervised?” Draco replied incredulously, stopping abruptly in the middle of the room. “No, thank you.”
The elastic band of tension binding Draco’s chest immediately snapped, and a monstrous grin broke out on his face before he could even begin to reign it in. “You’re serious?”
“Don’t insult her, Harry,” Luna chirped through the screen door. “You know she can’t defend herself.”
“You folks need a ride?” the driver asked, poking his head out curiously.
“Context, please?” she requested, pulling herself half out of the pool with her elbows planted on a wet slab of rock. “Is there a ransom on my head or something?”
“No,” came Draco’s soft answer, muffled by the thin strip of wall that separated them. “Not tonight. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, daft animal.”
“What the fuck,” Draco said, horrified.
a fortifying voice whispered in the back of his mind. But it worked counterintuitively, unwillingly reminding Harry that he was—against all better judgement—genuinely attracted to this tall, pale, vigorously irritating man. He just couldn’t win.
Theo?”
“Pansy. She wanted to be sure we’d have as much time in the morning to get ready as possible.”
“That’s my guess.”
The sky outside was streaked with heavy grey clouds when he pushed through the back door onto the porch, the dull morning blue shot with pink and orange from the rising sun. The grass was wet and squishy, and everything smelled of fresh, damp earth. Phoebe was nowhere to be seen, but the wand in Harry’s hand was twitching North—just as he expected it to. He’d cast a subtle tracking charm on her before falling asleep the night before, and while his wand wouldn’t tell him exactly where she was, it would at least point him in the right direction.
“Do they even have cabs all the way out here?” she asked while doing so, raising her eyebrows at Harry.
“You still have feet,” Harry assured, smiling. “Have either of you seen Draco anywhere? I lost track of him.”
He wiped his forehead with the back of his gloved hand and peered at the wild, shadowed part of the yard that engulfed the North corner, feeling a heavy anvil of responsibility press down on his shoulders. He didn’t know what was over there other than old, probably diseased apple trees and out-of-control underbrush, and he didn’t really want to know. But the mediator within him urged him that learning to control that area would be another step in learning how to be a real, genuine farmer as opposed to the amateur-adjacent farmer he currently felt like. He really did need to tidy the place up, especially if Phoebe was going to continue her mysterious adventures.
“Our home sounds nice,” he says once he’s settled back between the linen sheets, glasses folded on the pile of books next to the mattress, knees bumping into Draco’s like they do every night. “I like it.”
“Mm.” Draco shifts and brings a hand up to kiss Harry’s jaw with his knuckles. Gentle; absent. “I’ll tell you what,” he starts, his breath warm on Harry’s neck. Harry wants to melt into him. “After tomorrow, when all the papers have been signed and all the champagne glasses have been picked up, we can go look at places.”
Then, on Christmas Eve, another faint knock had sounded at the door, and Harry opened it to find Ron standing on the porch looking unrested and pale.
“And I distinctly remember
“Put it on, Potter.”
“Harry,” Luna repeated, and he couldn’t even begin to understand why she sounded so peaceful, so meditative, when there were three fucking Slytherins sitting at Harry’s kitchen table—specifically, one Draco Malfoy sitting at Harry’s kitchen table. One Draco Malfoy who was staring at him with eyes so wide they looked on the verge of popping right out and bouncing on Harry’s floor like ping pong balls.
Theo grimaced, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand as he came to the bottom of the steps next to Draco. “I think someone tore the wards.”
“And I haven’t the faintest idea why,” Draco said airily. “No one’s forcing you.”
“Yes,” Lovegood corroborated easily, and Draco noticed that she had the same bright pink drink as Potter, but instead of one paper umbrella, she had three. Another was tucked behind her ear. “It was very strange. She always came back, of course, right around noon. But none of us ever saw her leave in the morning.”
“God,” Harry grumbles. “That woman has been after me since day one. Why did we let her coordinate this?”
Luna nodded. “Yes.”
Pansy grinned and tipped her head back to stare at the ceiling. “Merlin,” she said again, then rolled her head to look at Draco’s profile. “Are you alright?” she asked, lowering her voice so only he could hear. Theo and Greg were both occupied with staring out the window, so he doubted they would hear her either way.
“And yet you keep asking questions.”
“They’re corduroy,” Malfoy said horrendously.
“You guys ready?” he asked through the screen after tramping downstairs, keys twirling around his index finger and wand carefully stowed in the sleeve of his jacket.
“North,” Harry told him graciously before helping Hermione clamber up beside him. “Towards Bedford.”
“I don’t know, I’m just saying—”
Harry nods. “I’ll think about it.”
“One minute,” she said, flapping her hand and bending down further to coo at the small litter of newborn chicks nestled inside the safety of the henhouse. They’d hatched just the other week, and already Harry could hear their chirps all the way from the porch, loud and chipper.
“No,” Potter stopped him, straightening up off the table and pushing the wand back towards Draco. “Keep it. I want you to.”
He’d agreed with them. Every single one. He deserved more than he’d got. Much more.
“Following Phoebe,” he answered, bending over to swipe his beat-up Chucks from the pile of shoes next to the door. He wasn’t too surprised to see Neville sitting at the dining table, hands wrapped around a hot mug of chamomile tea, but he certainly wasn’t expecting him to be awake so early.
“Had a little adventure, did you?” he asked, but all he got in return was a strange little wiggle and a sloppy attempt to try and lick his face. Luna laughed merrily.
“You’re forcing me!”
His infatuation with the house was undeniable; he could see past the mulchy lawns and faded wallpaper, the metal furniture in the yard crawling with weeds and ivy, the duck pond around the front that was so brown it was almost black. All he could see was potential—fifteen acres of potential.
Malfoy nodded, casting his gaze towards the fire. Something made Harry want to get up and grab the curve of his chin to tug him back in place so he could meet Luna’s eyes. “I do,” Malfoy said. “I was very young, so it’s all a bit fuzzy, but I remember her. I was introduced to her at some event that I probably didn’t care much about, but I remember liking her robes the best out of everyone there.”
So he didn’t.
“You went to Azkaban,” Potter said, which was a sentence that shouldn’t have hurt Draco’s chest as much as it did. “Not for long, obviously, but you did—didn’t you?”
Draco lifted his gaze. “With what?”
“Did you find them?” she asked lightly, hopping up onto the curb and holding her arms wide for balance. “They weren’t in the park. A man did offer me a good deal on some weed, but I don’t have cash on me.”
“Anytime, mate,” Ron said through a loud yawn, wobbling a bit in place and forcing Hermione’s grip to tighten. “You would’ve found out either way. ‘M surprised Luna didn’t pick up on it.”
“Draco—”
Her brows knit. “Am I being unhelpful?”
Draco did, shifting himself under her arm so it draped around his shoulders. He put his head on her shoulder, and she rubbed his arm soothingly up and down, rhythmic and predictable, how he liked it.
Draco’s stomach dipped. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he dismissed, but his tone was slipping out of his control. “There is no
Theo’s mouth pressed into a thin line, and he nodded curtly before turning away to start circling the perimeter of the clearing. Draco had no idea how he was going to figure out where the wards broke without a wand in hand, but it was true—he did trust Theo. He trusted Theo with his life.
“Yes. Is that surprising?”
Potter grinned, and Draco felt something sharp and hot jolt up from the base of his spine.
“Hi,” she said quietly, mirroring him by sitting down and pulling her own knees up, resting her chin on them. She was wearing an oversized white t-shirt with sleeves that came down to her elbows. A pair of grey cotton shorts exposed her pale legs, supple under the slanting moonlight and dotted with small, soft, dark hairs. Her hair was down and her makeup was wiped away, the only remnants being dull smudges of grey around the corners of her eyes.
“It’s a matter of dignity, not of the law,” Malfoy added, but Harry agreed with Neville. They weren’t making it easy.
“Harry… Potter?” Greg asked from behind, and Draco wanted to spin around and shake him silly because
“So act like it!”
Unsurprisingly, Lovegood was the one to answer the door. Her smile was huge and welcoming, teeth gleaming in the supple evening light as she stepped back and said, “Please, come in.” Her hair was done up in intricate plaits and dotted with multicolored butterfly clips, some of which seemed to be moving. It might’ve just been a trick of the light, but it made her look ethereal. “Pansy Parkinson,” she greeted as Pansy and Draco stepped into the foyer, Pansy holding her coat tight around herself, Draco gripping onto a plastic tin of Greg’s homemade brownies.
“Old times’ sake,” Draco echoed, his brain going fuzzy for a moment, and then going sharp again when he realised what exactly he was being asked. “You mean—here? Now?”
There was a single bouncer outside that asked for their IDs, which—surprisingly enough—the Slytherins had ready, and not a single one was fake. “Done this before, have you?” Harry asked Malfoy when they made it inside, having to sway close to him because of the garishly loud music.
“See?” Potter chirped. “You’re a liar.”
Draco’s breath tickles the shell of his ear. “The bed won’t have a bed frame, because according to you they’re unnecessary. And there’ll be Dean’s artwork on the walls and Greg’s pottery on the shelves. And there will be books. Lots of them. In the corners and on the windowsills and under the covers.”
Harry stared hard at the back of the other man’s head. “That’s just fucking rich coming from you, Malfoy. Do you even have a job, or is your daddy paying for all your expenses out of pocket?”
Draco sighed. “I suppose you can help me sniff Pansy out in case she’s been kidnapped.” A beat. “You don’t think she’s been kidnapped, do you?”
“Yeah?”
Beginning to feel the slight cold sifting into the kitchen, Harry waved his hand and wandlessly closed the windows that Luna had opened, only leaving the one over the sink alone so he could continue gazing out at the sprawling yard. The orchard was bright and perky, spread wide over the generous fifteen acres of land, crowded in by the surrounding woodland and rugged hills that peeked over the tips of the apple trees. Their branches reached high and beckoning towards the dull blue sky, shining glimpses of pink and yellow nestled amongst their cradles of leaves. The ground was riddled with fallen apples that Harry figured he’d have to clean up later before the squirrels got to them.
“Half past six,” he echoed blankly.
“Do it, then.”
“Public safety,” Draco cut in. “I know. My parole wizard made that abundantly clear.”
“Goodnight,” Harry returned, and then he was pulling his head out of the fireplace and the flames were gone, leaving behind nothing but slow, crumbling blue embers.
This.
“We should have known better.”
“I have, yeah,” he answered anyway, trying to be a good sport.
“Oh, he does. He thinks we’re the scum of the Earth, as far as I know,” Draco said, nodding. “I have a feeling that Lovegood is behind it. She was oddly nice to me when we—” He paused. “Well, you know.”
“Good.” She scooted closer so she could hook her leg around his. It wasn’t very comfortable, but Draco appreciated her closeness. Her warmth. “Now,” she said once she was settled, “tell me what’s on your mind.”
“I know you’re not, but that’s no excuse to skip out on two meals. Did you even have breakfast this morning?”
“No,” he said. “I can’t do this today. Sorry for breaking your wards, but I’d really like you to leave. You’re not welcome here.”
“No,” Draco retorted, “it’s not. I was a twisted, confused, elitist piece of shit in school.”
Hermione’s head tilted. “Do you see where I’m going with this?”
“It’s not important,” Malfoy answered firmly.
“And I’d like my dog back, but clearly that’s not happening anytime soon.”
“Very good,” Draco agreed. Strange, how they were doing that now—agreeing on things. “But—what about you?”
, which, personally, was Harry’s favorite.
“Soon,” Pansy answered, sliding one of her feet in between Draco’s in what he assumed was a comforting gesture. “Are you feeling better?”
“So, it’s going to be fine. Luna won’t let anything bad happen on her watch, I know it.” She paused, then spun in front of the mirror and frowned at herself. “Should I wear tights under this?”
“Have you made sponge cake before?” Luna asked him, twisting on her back to look at him upside down.
“I thought so.”
Neville’s brow creased, conflicting emotions rippling across his face. “Where’s Phoebe now?”
“I think I’m done dancing for my entire life,” Ron replied as he slumped against the banister, long legs sticking awkwardly off the steps.
“For what?”
“Don’t you reckon she has a name already?”
at it so she wouldn’t track it into the house. He then did the same thing to Phoebe’s paws, causing her to sneeze in surprise and then try to lick Harry’s face a second time.
just got here. You’ve been here for ages.”
“Merlin,” Hermione sighed before standing up and steadying herself on the back of the booth. “I’m closing our tab now. Harry, can you find Draco and Theodore so we can start heading out? I haven’t seen either of them in ages.”
“Do you want me to stop?”
“Your house had a
“Everything alright?” Harry asked, lowering himself down next to Draco and crossing his legs. “I lost you back there.”
“You’ve heard it before?” Neville asked, surprised, and Harry swatted at him to sit down and put his seatbelt on. He was rotating the steering wheel and maneuvering them out onto the dirt road that would eventually lead into town, cutting through the valley and running alongside the white-capped river that weaved between the yellow fields and modest hills surrounding his property. There were a few other privately-owned farming estates in the area, but only one or two shared the road with Harry, so it was practically empty.
Harry hated it, but not enough to make him throw his wine glass or flip the coffee table on its side. He was having a hard enough time deciding whether or not he should be annoyed at these people for intruding on his life.
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
“Good,” Harry said, smiling softly. “That’s good.”
Theo’s eyes brightened. “Okay?” he clarified, grip tightening on Draco’s hip.
There was a pause, then, possibly for the first time all evening, Goyle spoke up, “Because we’re Slytherins.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t want to talk about me. Your stuff is much nicer.”
“Oh.”
probably. Protection.”
“Okay.”
—and then the next day you’re inviting us over for dinner every week. I don’t get it, and I’d like you to explain.”
“Jesus, Harry,” she sighed, scrubbing a hand over her eyes. “Just—give me a moment. Ron needs to be here.”
Harry couldn’t deal with her. With any of it. “I’m finding a cab,” he decided, heart thumping in his ears as he began pushing through the group, leaving them to deal with the spectacle around the corner. He thought he heard Ron say his name as he left, but everything sounded liquidized and muted. Like there was water in his ears.
“Her robes,” Luna repeated, small and hopeful, as if she was afraid the words would run away from her if she didn’t catch them.
“Excuse me?” Nott asked, sounding stuffy.
Draco put his forehead on his knees. “Right.” He lifted it again. “But I’m not trying to get into Potter’s pants, if that’s what you’re implying.”
“No.” Malfoy put his hand up. “No, they need to be fixed, and you’re the only other bloody wizard within a thirty-kilometer radius who can do that. I can help a bit with translating, but without magic I can’t—” He paused, frustrated. “Just—
“I’m not lying.”
“I believe my house had a motto,” Luna spoke up thoughtfully. “I remember it was in French, but I don’t speak French. Do you speak French, Draco?”
“You do?” she asked, matching his softness.
Since then, Neville and Luna had been the only true regulars that came by Harry’s house on a weekly basis. They were a huge help with the orchard and a joy to be around; nothing felt strained around them, and Harry didn’t feel even the slightest of expectations when it came to them. With Ron and Hermione, there was always a grim subtext, a dark thread tying all of them together, usually untouched, but present nonetheless. With Luna and Nev, there was nothing of the sort. It made Harry feel guilty sometimes, but then he remembered Eva’s words about living “for himself,” and so he tried thinking of Luna and Neville’s presence as a treat to himself. As something cathartic.
She rubbed her hand up his shoulder again, squeezing it slightly. “It’s fine if you have feelings for him. I can’t say I understand it, but I’m here to support you.”
She blinked. “I might’ve. Did it just happen?”
“Yeah, she does that sometimes,” Harry said, smiling knowingly. “Hope it doesn’t bother you.”
That wasn’t breaking news, exactly—Potter had been acting weird for over twenty years—but this was an unusual kind of weird. A kind of weird where he was making eye contact with Draco much more than necessary and turning beet red when Draco asked him simple questions, like where he kept his salt shakers or if he was “enjoying the soup.” Draco had a sneaking suspicion that it all had something to do with what happened at the Silk Dragon, with Theo and the alley and everything, but he didn’t dare bring up such a volatile topic.
“Maybe they’ve just moved in?” Greg suggested from his place at the head of the table, shoulders hunched and large hands wrapped around a comically small mug of coffee.
Granted, it did get better after a generous serving of pancakes and a steaming cup of coffee, but there was still pain lingering behind his eyes hours later after he’d said goodbye to all three of his friends. “Get some rest,” Hermione advised him on the way out as she tugged on her coat. “I mean it. Take a day or two off work, if you need.”
On Tuesday it snowed again. Wednesday it didn’t, but the soil in the yard was still too frozen for Harry to break through. So instead, he decided to sleep in until noon. He played solitaire with himself in front of the fire and won every time. He listened to Mazzy Star and Elliott Smith over the wireless as he cooked lunch. He cracked open
“It was,” Nott jumped in. “I mean—mine, Draco’s, and Goyle’s. Only for a year though, while we served out our parole. Technically we’re allowed to do magic now, we just choose not to, so the Ministry doesn’t have the means to catch up with us.”
“I wouldn’t put it past him.”
“More exciting that way!” she called back, and Draco sighed inwardly. If she caught a cold, that was entirely her problem.
“The top one next to the sink, I think!”
“We’re fine,” Ron assured, but there was an amused smile playing on his face, like he was trying not to laugh. “One of the barkeeps was coming onto Parkinson so ‘Mione told him she was her girlfriend.”
Draco’s brain short-circuited as an unwelcome image of Harry Potter attached to a dog leash flashed before his eyes, and he quickly shook it away. The ball of heat in his chest wiggled uncomfortably for the second time that morning. “It’s raining, you know,” he called after Pansy’s retreating figure, her rubber flip-flops slapping loudly against the stairs.
Spilling out onto the sidewalk was like submerging from a hot, sweaty pool, and Harry sighed as he breathed in the cool night air, steadying his weight against an exposed brick wall. Luna leaned next to him, her movements slow and smooth like she was wading through water. “What’s the plan?” Harry asked her groggily after determining that neither Malfoy nor Nott were anywhere in sight.
“Goodnight, Harry,” Hermione said with one last smile.
“I’m not stupid.”
The familiar cabbie gave him a toothy smile. “The one and only. Where are you two headed?”
“This is more than withdrawal,” Harry said, frowning at his dog as he stroked the curve of her back. “It’s almost like she’s magnetically attracted to Malfoy, which is creepy as fuck when you think about it.”
“I’m sure.”
“Ah,” Harry said, now understanding why he was up so early; the couch was only comfortable to sleep on for a maximum of three to four hours. Anything beyond that would end in a serious muscle cramp or a bitch of a sore neck. “No problem. Save some of that tart for me, yeah? I shouldn’t be gone long.”
“I’m right, though.”
“They were there before we moved in,” a new voice replied. Gregory Goyle, big and lumbering as ever, shoulders curved like an inverted parenthesis.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, finally turning around to meet Malfoy head-on, still wringing the dishtowel in his hands so he wouldn’t reach across the counter and strangle the man. “I don’t fucking know. But rest assured, I’m certainly regretting it now.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Then put a leash on him, if you’re so worried. Merlin.”
“Positive,” Harry had said again, frustrated this time. It wasn’t that far, anyway; only a single Floo stop or a ninety-minute drive in his dingy green Outback. He could visit London whenever he needed to. And it’s not like he needed to see Ron and Hermione every day to survive—he could do that on his own. Or, at least, he hoped he could.
“Pretty much,” Potter nodded, looking towards Lovegood for confirmation.
“I know.”
“That’s the one,” Theo confirmed, straightening up. “My hypothesis is that whoever’s living there crossed over the property line and then Disapparated before they could get caught.”
“He has, actually. His ego, particularly,” Hermione piped up, sliding off her own stool to come break through Ron’s embrace and wrap her own arms around Harry’s shoulders, smiling. “Hi, Harry. It’s been far too long.”
His mouth was pressed into a thin line, caught somewhere between scared shitless and blazingly angry; his thin, pale hands were wrapped around the edge of the table bracingly. But he didn’t answer Harry—Theodore Nott did.
“Bizarre?”
“Fix my wards and I’ll give you your dog back.”
“He has too!”
“...I know.”
Something conflicted flashed across Potter’s face, like he couldn’t decide if he should be triumphant for being right or concerned by Draco’s tone. “I had a life before moving out here,” he started, dropping his tone. “That was one of the first things they taught us in Auror training—that once a convict is released they don’t really get all their rights back. The wand thing is for public—”
Draco’s fingers tightened around the post as he tried to process that bit of information, heart still drumming in his ears. The dog had stopped running and was now approaching Draco and Theo slowly with a kind of curious head-tilt. The branch was still sticking out of its mouth, probably in hopes that Draco would throw it again. It looked ridiculous.
Greg tore his gaze away from the window, dazed. “Oh—er,
“I couldn’t tell.”
Draco had asked all those weeks ago when Harry had been standing in the same exact place, washing dishes over the sink, the lights around him dim and warm.
“You—oh,” Hermione said, blinking, like she wasn’t sure if she was seeing things correctly.
Draco sighs, airy and lackadaisical, but indulges Harry anyway. “What do you want to know?”
“I assure you we haven’t,” Parkinson said tersely, back as straight as the chair she was perched in.
Theo grinned in the way he did whenever he was well on the right side of tipsy, all crooked and thin-lipped. “Maybe a bit. How could you tell?”
Except—well. It didn’t feel like an intrusion anymore. Not with them sitting in his living room, eating his food, making conversation. It felt like a misstep. Like maybe the universe wasn’t actually playing some cruel prank on Harry, and this reunion hadn’t been predetermined whatsoever. Like it was an accident—a stumble of fate.
Draco had never experienced such an intense moment before. It was like time had surrendered its iron-fisted hold and locked the two of them into place, unable to look away.
“Should be,” Harry replied, skimming his wand to the area and feeling a slight ripple of magic. “Yes, that’s it. What symbol is missing, do you think?”
Neville nodded and swallowed a sip of his tea, steam curling around his face. A reddish pillow crease ran down one of his cheeks. “Yeah, I took the couch, Luna took the guest room. Hope that’s okay.”
Harry sat up on his elbows, gaze refocusing on the dark, jagged shapes of his bedroom. Phoebe was curled at the end of the bed, her chest rising and falling slowly, rhythmically.
“Right,” Harry said. “Right. Of course.”
“No.”
“Yes, yes, right. Apple-picking.” She drew her hands out, too, and brushed them off on her skirt, getting little bits of hay caught in the sheer material. Evidently, she’d forgotten about her cabbage-shaped mug of tea, as it was sitting untouched on the flat roof of the henhouse. “Will Nev be coming by today to help out as well?” she asked curiously.
“Maybe,” Pansy shrugged. “But we can’t just keep calling her ‘the dog.’ It’s exhausting.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” She carefully extracted her hand from between Harry’s, but not before pressing a gentle, motherly peck to the back of his knuckles. “We were potentially thinking May, when the weather starts to get warmer, but we haven’t settled on anything yet. It’ll be small, though. Only immediate relatives and close friends.”
“I’m sorry you had a bad day,” she said softly, her cheek pressed against the top of his head. “But it’s all going to be fine. Even if we’re neighbors with the Chosen One, we’re going to be fine. You’re going to be fine.”
“Yes.”
They both agreed that would be easy, and time went on. October slid quickly into November, and soon the days began to shrink in daylight and Harry began to spend more and more time in the depths of his orchard, pruning and picking for hours each day in preparation for the rapidly oncoming winter. Neville’s visits got more sporadic as his classes picked up speed, while Luna’s got more frequent. She began staying entire weekends, falling asleep on Harry’s couch late in the evening after Friday dinners and, frankly, forgetting to go home. Not that Harry minded.
“Yeah.” Draco’s fingers curled into the fabric of Harry’s jumper.
At one point, Pansy knocked on his half-open door and stuck her head inside, disrupting his brooding long enough to announce, “I’m going down to the ravine for a swim. Care to join me?”
Harry shrugged. “I’m not good at foundational wards.”
“Are they standard wards, or just anti-Apparition?” Harry asked as he came up behind Malfoy to peer into the brick niche where a suspended set of complicated runes shimmered dully under the washed-out light.
“Dangerous?” Harry’s heart dropped.
“Okay,” Harry breathed, picking absently at one of the little knotted flowers on his duvet cover. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
Draco opened the window.
“Take it back.”
“But—I thought your magic was
Once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin.”
, Potter, not the other way around. I haven’t kidnapped anything.”
Silence weighted the room. Harry’s hand stilled, and he looked up to find Malfoy already staring at him, eyes wide, fingers digging into the velvet armrests.
“Isn’t that animal cruelty?” Pansy asked, turning her back on the window with her hands poised on her hips. She was still in pyjamas—they all were, in fact, all except for Draco himself—and she looked rather ridiculous, her huge t-shirt coming down to her knees and making her look half-undressed. “Yesterday you were lecturing me about the gender binary of canines, and now you’re using one for blackmail? You’ve changed your tune.”
Unsure where to go from there, Draco wrapped his arms around his torso and leaned half his weight against the chipped banister post. “So,” he started.
“Yes!” Luna’s face lit up pleasantly, clearly surprised that he'd managed to remember something. “Have you been reading that book series I gave you for Christmas?”
Harry turns his head just slightly so he can see the window. The ivory light. The steel clouds.
“Ah, you’ve come to harass me, then.”
Another car honks outside, and Harry looks away. Back out the window. The watery clouds have completely cleared now, leaving behind an unobscured pearl of light that crowns the terraced rooftops of London like a piece of fine jewelry. Gibbous and full.
She nodded emphatically, holding the towel close. “Yes, please. I’d rather not be standing around freezing my tits off when this potential kidnapper shows up.”
“Mate.” Harry felt himself grin like a madman, meeting Ron in the middle of the vibrating room and throwing an arm around him despite the fact that he was at least a foot taller. “Have you gotten bigger since I last saw you?”
“So you’ve said. Three times.”
“Did you stay the night?” Harry asked, even though the answer was quite obvious—unless Neville had decided on a whim to come over at seven in the morning. When Harry had gone to bed the evening before, both he and Luna had been in the living room watching
“Ron proposed last week,” she explained gently, holding her hand out in front of her like she was looking at the ring for the first time, too. She was smiling, faint and secretive. “That’s part of why we invited you out tonight. So we could tell you in person.”
“I usually sell at the farmer’s market in town every weekend. We have a booth there.”
“Fine,” he replied firmly. “Just peachy.”
“What’s its name?”
“Okay,” Hermione cut in, shutting them down. “Enough. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can all go back to sleep. Capiche?”
“Who’s the liar now?”
Harry stared at her, unblinking. “Is that not obvious?”
Oddly enough, the weirdest part of dinner wasn’t the staring or the blushing or the dismantling of Draco’s well-cooked vegan soup; the weirdest part was when Potter asked, completely out of the blue, “Do you miss it?” then immediately looked like he wanted to take it back.
The letters inside had been beyond vulgar, cursing his name, his family, his dignity. And he didn’t blame them.
“Yeah,” Harry nods. His eyelids want to close, but he doesn’t let them. Doesn’t want to let them. Doesn’t want to let go of the warmth and the citrus and the moonlight just yet. “I don’t think Ron and ‘Mione count as regular straight people, though. They’re just— they just
It got better after that. In August, they moved to an old townhouse in Dublin after Theo had announced his cousin would be moving back into the house in Cornwall. “It was my aunt’s,” Greg explained as he’d pushed the door open and lugged their bags inside. “Haven’t seen her in ages, but she won’t mind us staying here.” That was true—they’d stayed in Dublin for nearly a year without hearing a peep from any of Greg’s family, immediate or extended. They didn’t hear from any of their families, really, least of all Draco’s.
Draco had been alone. He’d never been alone before—he was without a home, without money. Without anyone on his side.
“Of course you do. Can you come in here?”
When they’d come back, Hermione told Harry that they were “going to try again,” and there had been tears shining bright and glossy in Ron’s eyes. Then Hermione hugged Harry and told him how grateful she was to have him, and that she missed seeing him, and Harry had agreed profusely, and they all promised to talk to each other more. To stay in each other’s lives.
Harry’s brain supplied as he saw Phoebe triumphantly recover the branch and begin her bounding journey back towards the house, looking happier than Harry had ever seen her, and then he immediately repealed that statement and began to burn it with a mental torch in his brain. No, Malfoy was
“It looks cold,” Draco said drily, eyeing her up and down. It looked grand, actually, and if Draco was attracted to women, he figured he’d be drooling over her—but he was mad at Pansy, and he wasn’t exactly jumping to dish out compliments to her at the moment. “Why must you always dress like it’s summer in Morocco? It’s nearly December, you absolute nutter.”
“Huh?” He craned his neck. “It’s not?”
“You’re not just faking it so you can get your dog back?”
“You should go, sometime. Lots of farms there—I’m sure you’d fit right in.”
“Your hair,” Pansy chirped.
That was the last thing on Earth Harry wanted to do, but the material was warm and pliant under his hands, and they really did need to get going if they were going to make it to the bar on time. So he bit the bullet and put it on, sliding his arms through the impossibly soft sleeves and tugging it over his head, most likely messing up his hair more than usual. “There,” he declared once it was on all the way, cuffs falling past his fingertips. “Happy now?”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“You’ve been living for other people for so long, Harry,” she’d said kindly, foot crossed over her knee, hands clasped in her lap. “It makes me proud that you’re learning how to live for yourself. It shows progress.”
“I never
“Yes, exactly.”
too early for a conversation with her. He needed time to prepare for those—or at the very least a warning. “The, um, the chicks, you mean?”
She grinned wickedly, flipped him off right back, then continued to laugh.
“Leverage for what?”
Harry wanted to ask, given that there wasn’t a single houseplant dead or alive in sight, but he didn’t ask. Instead he just nodded shortly and slipped out of the room, not really wanting to engage with a man whose parents had most likely murdered one or two of Harry’s classmates.
So they’d stopped. Completely.
Draco had written back plainly, hoping with all his heart that he knew who he was responding to.
“As many as you want. As long as you can keep them alive.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“I realise that, and I’ve decided that I do not care because I absolutely refuse to be seen in public with you dressed like that. Put it on.”
“It’s been sitting in a box in the back of my wardrobe,” Potter told him after handing it over, their fingers brushing as the smooth, dark wood touched Draco’s skin for the first time in half a decade. Ten inches of hawthorn and a unicorn hair core; reasonably springy, supple enough to bend. Heavy in his palms. “I meant to return it, but there was never a right time.”
Harry hadn’t pressured her to talk despite his burning curiosity, and the most she ever said about it was after he'd found her crying on the floor of the downstairs loo, hands shaking, eyes wild. “I’m having a panic attack,” she’d informed him through tears, and Harry had sat next to her and held her hand, helping her count her breathing until her hands stopped trembling.
“Draco Malfoy stole my dog.”
Harry shook his head, insistent but apologetic. “No, I’m sorry, I just—I
There was more creaking in the hall, followed by a startled laugh and a breathy, “No, no,
“Her brain is literally the size of a walnut.” Pansy flicked a wet piece of hair out of her face, then sighed at Draco’s offended scowl. “What if we called her something gender-neutral, like Avery or Emerson or something, not she’ll really mind that much. Given that she’s a dog and all.”
Harry whines faintly and buries his nose into Draco’s collarbone. His glasses knock against his forehead uncomfortably, but he doesn’t care. “Who the fuck scheduled that again?”
are the only thing keeping you here. It’s a bit ridiculous, actually.”
“Why on earth would you do something like that?”
“Just him?”
Harry gave him a long, blank stare, trying to ignore the way his heart was thumping in his ears. “Nice to see you, too. What exactly are you—”
The path stretched on and on for what felt like miles, twisting around fallen logs and down short outcroppings of rock and dirt. At one point, it began to slope downward, following a set of chipped, sunken wood boards that were set into the ground, acting as a sort of crumbling stairway. Harry was careful stepping down it, keeping one hand on the passing tree trunks so he didn’t stumble and fall face-first into the oncoming greenery.
He was referring to the stove incident, then.
“After four years?”
“Can you name a recent time?”
“I feel like I should be mad at you.”
Outside, the clouds waver and a chipped corner of the pearl-white moon spills into view. A car honks in the distance.
“Okay.”
“Oh,” Draco said, feeling like his head might fall right off.
“That’s so fucking offensive,” Harry said seriously. “Half my wardrobe is made of corduroy, you prick.”
Bedfordshire felt like fate.
A beat passes, and the faint sound of music from a nightclub down the street floats up through the floorboards. Fills the space.
“What would be a crime against humanity?” Theo asked through a yawn as he padded into the kitchen, one side of his hair sticking up completely vertical like he’d just been electrocuted.
Just inside the grove, a small, barely-used path cut meekly through the greenery and wound inward towards the surrounding woodlands, beyond where Harry had ever bothered exploring. Despite the fact that the property had been sold to him by a wizarding real estate agency, this particular area of Bedfordshire was entirely Muggle; he didn’t expect to see any roaming centaurs or wild acromantula nests, yet he stayed wary of the rustling bushes and the animalistic chirps that sounded every now and again. Muggle forests could be just as terrifying as enchanted ones. He knew better than most, given that he’d spent a majority of his seventh year living in both.
“I said okay. I’ll do it. You win.”
“And they’ll be here when we get back,” Harry promised, shutting the back door behind him. The crates of apples were sitting around the side of the house, waiting to be picked up and lugged down the hill so they could be shoved haphazardly into the boot of the car. Levitation charms were iffy because they tended to bruise the apples, so instead Luna cast lightening charms on all of them and they each took two, one stacked on top of the other.
“Good plan,” Draco agreed.
important.”
“It’s mine,” a new voice sounded from the doorway, stilted and gruff, recognizable in a heartbeat. “They’re just squatters who won’t leave.”
The next morning, Phoebe went missing again.
Harry peeked through his fingers, gaze falling on the half-eaten platter of apple tart, gooey and warm-looking, inviting Harry to come take a slice, but he’d completely lost his appetite. “Thanks,” he said anyway, tired.
“Well I would, but you see, this colossal piece of shit kidnapped my sheepdog and won’t give her back, so unfortunately I can’t do that.”
“It’s perfectly alright to find him attractive. You’re allowed to be attracted to people.”
And so Harry went home—his
So, left without much of a choice, Harry did the only thing he could think of. He pulled on his coat and pushed outside into the nebulous night, headed straight for the tangled greenery of the North corner, thinking only of Draco, Draco, Draco. Thinking of his hair and his hands and his voice, of the way he’d said Harry’s name hours earlier. The way the syllables had fallen from his lips so easily, as if they’d been there on the tip of his tongue forever. As if he’d been waiting to say them forever.
“Have you named the little ones yet?” Luna asked, changing the subject and breaking his train of thought. She was leaning back over the chicken coop, attention recaptured by the chattering baby birds. Since it was obvious that she wasn’t going to be pulled away from them anytime soon, Harry stood up from his rocking chair and brought Luna’s cabbage-shaped mug over to her so they wouldn’t have to strain their voices to talk.
But he didn’t want to turn back. Not yet, anyway.
“Yeah, a few minutes ago.”
him, just like, attractive in general. Objectively.”
“Luna,” Harry said, ducking around the thick branch that had been inches away from concussing him so he could look at Luna in the neighbouring tree. “Sorry, but that’s an absolutely horrible idea. The worst, actually. I can’t think of anything that would be more horrible than inviting them over for dinner.”
Harry’s eyebrows went up. “Hear that?” he asked Phoebe, scratching her head. “Luna thinks you can’t defend yourself. That’s awfully mean, isn’t it?”
Draco gave up on battling the dog away from the windowsill in favor of glowering down at him. “Don’t you have better things to be doing with your day? Cows to milk or sheep to herd, perhaps?”
“Oh,” is all he has time to say before he’s arching up to meet Draco in the middle, fire unfurling in his chest and catching his ribs, his spine. Draco is pliant and slow, arms tightening around Harry’s middle.
“This,” Harry emphasized, gesturing between them like that would explain everything. “Us.”
Potter was eccentric and oafish and incredibly, undeniably magnetic, and Draco wanted to despise him so badly that he considered blinding himself multiple times throughout dinner. That way he would never have to look at Potter’s inexplicably attractive face ever again.
“It most certainly is not. Why would you even begin to think that?”
Harry snorted and leaned back against the wood banister, letting his head tip up and soak in the streaks of sunlight permeating the cloud cover, keeping his hand lightly on Phoebe’s back. Out of his peripheral vision he could see the North corner, lush and bedraggled, needing desperately to be tidied up.
There was a short exchange of shifty, startled looks between the Slytherins, none of them seeming willing to answer. After a moment, Parkinson looked ready to gear up and take one for the team, but then Malfoy’s crystal-cut accent broke the silence.
Harry shrugged, turning away to finish setting the table. “It’s cheaper.”
“Won’t be hard for us,” chimed a new voice, and both Ron and Hermione swiveled their heads towards the rest of the group, faces freezing almost comically when they realised that it was Pansy Parkinson who’d just spoken and not some stranger who happened to be listening in on their conversation.
“Thanks, ever so.”
“That’s fine too,” she assured. “Feelings are complicated. Christ, I’m engaged and even I don’t understand them half of the time.”
She and Neville stayed for the rest of the day, helping Harry make fried tofu for lunch and then sitting on the floor of the living room, surfing idly through television channels while a small afternoon fire crackled in the hearth. Phoebe laid with her head in Harry’s lap, craning up every once in a while to try and take a swipe at his bowl of tofu, but she gave up halfway through an episode of The Great British Bake Off and promptly fell asleep.
, because Harry didn’t want him to be on the market.
“Brilliant,” Malfoy said drily. “Glad we have that cleared up. If you could kindly step off my porch now, I would sincerely appreciate it.”
“Fine.”
But now Harry was thinking about Malfoy.
The drawer slammed, rattling the room. “I hate it when we argue, you know.”
Draco, who hadn’t really looked away from him the entire dinner, frowned across the table and set down his spoon with a
“If that’s the case, let’s hope it’s one-sided,” Neville snorted.
From his bed, Potter’s dog lifted her head and let loose a huge yawn before settling back down, digging her long nose into Draco’s comforter. “You’re ridiculous,” he told her, receiving nothing but a small sniff in his direction.
home, unpainted and unfurnished as it may be, but home nonetheless—and he learned how to live for himself.
“Yes, but not an elitist one. That makes a difference.”
“Yeah, I don’t know what’s up with her.” He clicked his seatbelt.“I sent my Patronus to go find her and it went towards the North corner. She’ll be fine without us for a few hours, I think.”
“Yes,” he admitted faintly, thinking of Malfoy’s sharp, angled face, of his blanched hair sifting in a tumbling breeze, a crooked house with a sunken roof poised behind him, framed with green. “Yes, I am.”
“Hermione’s?”
The layout of the house was similar to theirs, with narrow hallways and arched doorways, but the living room was significantly smaller and significantly more furnished. There was a well-loved sofa in the middle, strewn with oddly patterned throw pillows, a pair of mismatched velveteen armchairs, twinkling lamps and hanging plants galore. The fireplace was roaring gold, and the smell of ash and woodsmoke buzzed around the room like static.
“Well,” said Draco, “I would try to help you, but I don’t know what exactly ‘this’ is.”

“Oh,” Harry said faintly. Mind spinning. If he was a cartoon character he’d have little birds flying around his head, probably. “I—found them.”
Despite her evident exhaustion, Hermione smiled softly. “Yeah,” she sighed. “Remember it’s only a theory, though. It’s very possible that Phoebe’s just a normal dog with an odd personality.”
“You have a lovely home,” Pansy complimented after all their jackets had disappeared into the hall, clasping her hands over her knees.
“How did you know?” he asked quietly, voice wavering.
“Something like that.”
“I saw you in the window.”
Luna didn’t have time to finish her question, cut off by the rest of their group tumbling through the door of the Silk Dragon. Hermione was giggling unusually loud while Ron had an arm thrown around her waist, keeping her close. Parkinson stumbled out after them, looking more frazzled than she had all night.
don’t make me talk about the Ministry. In fact, let’s not talk about it at all tonight,” Hermione said feelingly. “I’m declaring tonight a no-Ministry night. Just forget it exists, please, for the sake of my emotional wellbeing.”
Luna sat up from Harry’s lap, fair brows drawn together. “Why don’t you want them to know where you are?”
“Positive,” Harry had replied, running a hand down the splintered banister of the back porch and smiling privately.
Harry sighed and let his head thunk against a branch. He couldn’t win here. “I’m not inviting them over, Luna, end of story. It would be a complete disaster.”
Harry’s mouth opened, but no words came out.
Harry’s breath caught in this throat. “My… what?”
?” Neville rolled his head back disbelievingly, wine glass dangling loosely from his fingers. “Merlin, save us all.”
“I figured.” She was still smiling, Merlin. “That was very thoughtful of you. All of you.” Lovegood turned her smile to the lot of them, then down to the dog who was sniffing determinedly around her ankles. “She’s been going missing every morning for this past week. We were quite worried.” She reached down to scratch the dog’s head. “I knew she’d be alright, though. She’s very clever.” Lovegood looked back up at them. “Either way, Harry will be pleased you brought her back.”
Softly, Draco said, “I’ll be down in a moment,” even though he knew that the minute he stepped onto his back porch, there was no turning back.
“Are you going to keep repeating after me, or do you actually have something to say?”
“When’s the wedding gonna be?”
Harry’s legs felt weak. He couldn’t handle this. “I really don’t want to let you in.”
“I do,” Draco said quickly. “I do. Trust me, I want to, more than anything in the world. But I…” He looked down at the wand—the wand that he’d cast his very first spell with, that had kept him company all throughout his tumultuous teenage years, that had been loyal to him until the end—and decided that he’d outgrown it a long time ago. “It doesn’t belong to me anymore,” he finished, looking at Potter resolutely. “It’s yours. Even if you never use it, it’s yours.”
“You mean houses?”
“I know. I remember.”
“Moony,” he says.
Draco blinked. “I… suppose.”
“On three,” Potter agreed. He was bent down by Draco’s foot, holding the wand with both hands so Draco could stomp it clean in half. He was backlit by the low yellow light spilling onto the porch from the house, giving his silhouette a sort of fuzzy yellow halo and making him look soft and untouchable. “Ready?”
“So what the fuck do we do?” Draco had demanded.
Not sure what else to do, he brandished his wand and cast a rapid Patronus, instructing it to find Phoebe and keep an eye on her while they were away. It bobbed its silky, translucent head and pounded off into the Northern part of the orchard, and Harry watched it go, feeling dazed.
“About the Slytherins! She probably sensed their magic or something and sought it out because she didn’t know what it was. She’s not
