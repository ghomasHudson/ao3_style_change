“I hate you so much,” he sighed in contentment when the skin bearing his Dark Mark burnt beautifully under his almost done cig.
“Forgive me. I know you are not joking,” Draco spoke, clutching at his stomach, trying to calm himself down from the high of laughing so much at a stretch. He would not like to admit to anyone else, not even Harry, but the silence that usually surrounded him these days that yes, he’d like to venture out into the public to go shopping or eat at a restaurant or simply a park to sit on the bench and smell the green grass and wet soil. Yet, he also knew it was impossible. People would simultaneously hurl rocks and spells at him if he dared to roam out in the public like a free man. His marriage to the Chose One might have dissolved the rest of his time in Azkaban but it certainly did not absolve him of his crimes. He was still a criminal on the loose under the guise of Harry Potter’s husband.
“Ah, it hurts!” Draco tried standing up but fell to his knees as the pain in his stomach intensified to unbearable levels. The last thought he had before succumbing to unconsciousness was that maybe, he had eaten too much and that it was killing him.
After dinner and drinks came the time for presents and from his pocket, Harry produced the presents he and Draco bought for the family and enlarged them to their original size. Draco and Harry got Hermione a set of books on the real secrets of the Wizarding World. They were authentic books and were only found if you knew how to look for them. Hermione pressed a kiss on their cheeks for the books as she squealed in delight. They gave Ron a box full of Belgian chocolates and the hungry toad opened the box and savored the sweets right away. For, Ginny they purchased a silk baby pink robe which suited her complexion really well. It was Harry's selection. For George, they purchased a self-writing quill that would help him with his orders around his shop. Knowing Molly's love for cooking, they bought kitchenware for her and she was beyond excited. Upon Harry's suggestion, they purchased a collection of muggle stamps for Arthur and gave it to him. For the next twenty minutes or so, Harry had to explain to Arthur how they worked and what their purpose was.
She hugged him back and looked sadly over his shoulder at her husband, silently pleading for comfort.
"You have NOTHING to be sorry about. I should be doing the apologizing for what I did," Harry said, tracing his eyes over Draco's wounds.
Hope you guys are safe and sound. I pray for you to have the strength to support yourself and your families. Let the world be normal soon.
'I'm truly sorry, Draco. I hope you will get better someday. Harry is married now. He's happy. I don't want you to spoil that for him. After a lifetime of war and bloodshed, he deserves to be happy,' she said.
“Gee, thanks, but I can protect myself,” Draco huffed to make light of their current situation. He didn’t want her to pity him more than she already did. He didn’t want to turn into a charity case.
Draco laughed mirthlessly at the absurdity. Harry KNEW how loss looked like and he didn't particularly need to marry Draco for that. For heck's sake, he lost many people who were dear to him on the battlefield and no one better than Harry knew about Loss and the gaping black hole it always left behind.
Sifting through his cupboard, Harry found a small rectangular package under his Auror uniforms and proceeded to unwrap it. Round black glasses without lens, so similar to the ones he wore but way more sturdy and authentic, sat in a wooden box.
“Oh yes! I was in my third year when Dementors attacked me on Hogwarts grounds. I fainted and when I came to, I was asking about the match and my broom. Believe me when I tell you that my heart was blown to smithereens when I was shown my broken Nimbus. I still have it, you know?” somehow, the smile on his lips didn’t want to die down and his cheeks hurt from smiling so much.
"I'll be going with you?" Draco asked half in apprehension and half in the excitement that he would finally be walking in the streets, taking in their structures and the scenery around them.
An ominous silence fell over them as Draco ate his eggs and toast, sipping his coffee after a couple of bites. He finished the rest of his breakfast and coffee in silence but for the first time in a long time, he ate because he was hungry. Probably it was because of Granger's unwanted presence in his line of sight yet he was grateful although he'd die before admitting that.
“But I’m no woman, Harry! I don’t have the required intricacies, if I might add. So, please, do enlighten me!” he screamed.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Dinkydog, Rose, Babygirl33, Laura, IamMyself, Solitarysoul, Irisk, and MadamePerverell for your comments!
"No," Draco replied but still couldn't gather enough courage to look into Harry's eyes and tell him that he would be alright. That they would be alright and fear is nothing to be ashamed of at all.
Draco sighed, then nodded affirmative and winced when the hand towel rubbed over his sore and slightly bleeding opening while Harry apologized every few minutes.
"I'll be going with you to the Weasleys this weekend," Draco announced the next morning as Harry was getting ready to go the Ministry, grumbling like an old man about his work hours.
'Sure,' I replied and fought against the urge to ask her about you. The longer she lingered like a puppy at my doorstep; I realized that the danger of me asking about you is over the threshold of my self-control.
"Mate, you need to talk to him about whatever that's happened. Even I can see that the ferret's not in the right state of mind and I'M supposed to be the thickheaded one of the lot," Ron chuckled humorlessly.
Harry was going to finally kill him. He had been expecting this during his lonely days and nights spent wallowing in his sorrow, smoking and drinking like there was no tomorrow as he waited for Harry to show up at their house with either a wand or a knife in his hands and finish him. It would’ve been dramatic, yes, but at least it would save Harry the pain of keeping him alive – the one who apparently wiped out the chance for the existence of his conceived baby.
Thin cords of strong rope coiled around Draco’s wrists and held them in place. Draco’s wriggling like a caught fish only worsened the condition of his bound wrists but did nothing to keep Harry at bay.
Ron could see Draco calculating his options. The man was visibly trembling and Ron didn’t want to imagine or know why. Besides, he already knew and saw enough. A part of him could already guess why Draco was so overcome with fear. Harry. There had been a time when all of them were far from okay but they recovered. In retrospect, Ron felt utterly ashamed and guilty for leaving Harry to his own devices. He now believed that, in an attempt to get better, some part of Harry’s mind only repressed his trauma from the war as the people around him got help and walked out of the Darkness. A lot of what-ifs took up space in Ron’s mind but there was nothing he could do about it now. He could only think about what needed to be done henceforth.
"Draco, bloody hell, mate! Are you mental?!" a hand, Draco guessed, slapped his own hands away and the put-out bud rolled on the gravel.
Draco nodded in agreement though his anxiety still remained. How could he face the family he once openly humiliated in the public? How could he sit with them and pretend to be making merry when all he would remember upon seeing them was how he played a huge part in them losing their family?
Then, after almost eight long years and the death of his parents – his wonderful, lovely, foolish Mother who followed her husband in the name of love – the Golden Boy had come to rescue him. Harry needn’t have given him two choices and a minute because the moment he walked into Draco’s cell, Draco strongly knew that he would choose Harry. It would always be Harry over anything. He would take Harry in any form he came. Always.
After days of spending time with no one other than himself, though his mind told him to push Harry away and stop their forthcoming sex, warmth filled Draco’s heart and body when Harry finally pushed into him in one big thrust and both of them screamed in ecstasy. There was no preparation, it was raw and painful which served Draco’s want for burning inside out. It’s said that sex was heavenly but to Draco, sex was Hellfire. And they were the ones who set it aflame. Draco’s hands, which were flat against the wall, slipped and he fell forward, causing Harry to pull out a bit. The pleasure was too much to stand properly. And he wanted more.
"No, I won't," Draco turned away from the mirror so that the person in it wouldn't taunt him anymore. A few tears threatened to spill from his eyes yet again which he refused to shed at any cost. Picking up his wand and his Marlboro pack, he exited the bathroom.
Frowning, Harry smoothed them and read them. They were invitations from Molly Weasley. And this time, she sent one to Draco too. Suddenly, a twinge of guilt settled heavily in Harry’s heart. Not only did he not let them know of his marriage to Draco but he never contacted them later. Through The Prophet, Harry guessed, was how they knew of his predicament yet they didn’t come barging into his house for an explanation. Not even Ron did! Yes, they celebrated his birthday and Ron and Draco had a glaring competition but never once did either Ron or ‘Mione asked him for an explanation. Not once did they verbally abuse Draco for the crimes he committed, no matter how forced or involuntary. It hadn’t even crossed his mind then that he needed to provide a reason. He simply let his friends indulge him in their love and acceptance. None of the Weasleys demanded an explanation from him in their letters which wished him a very happy birthday. Looking back, he really felt bad for declining Molly’s invitation for dinner on his birthday. He smiled wistfully when he remembered the good old days of Christmas dinners at the Weasley’s.
“Why are you making such a big deal out of this, Draco? Don't tell me you never wanted a child of your own," Harry reprimanded as if he was the right one all along.
Just out of a perfectly dreamless sleep, Draco couldn't decipher where he was or to whom those gorgeous glassy eyes belonged to until he remembered the events of the previous night and stiffened for a moment in Harry's embrace before relaxing.
"Ron? 'Mione?" Harry asked in a daze, sitting up on the bed. Draco sat up too once Harry's weight was off of him.
"Happy now, are you?" Harry asked mockingly as he stopped beside Draco, who was visibly startled when his husband marched into his room angrily.
When Draco got a good look, he understood that Harry was about to cry but made no move to offer his husband any comfort. Part of his heart went out for the man but the larger portion of it only wanted to stay as far as possible from the man who tried to strangle him to death. Yet, as Harry curled towards Draco, pressing into his chest for comfort, Draco’s free hand involuntarily wrapped around Harry, bringing the both of them closer. It was a bit too late to draw his hand back as Harry’s other hand, which wasn’t interlaced with his’, found purchase on Draco’s waist, tightening the loose embrace.
. Usually, I don't prefer song lyrics as titles to my stories but this one felt apter than any other title I could come up with for this particular chapter.
"We lost the baby's magical signature, Mr. Potter. I'm sorry," he said in the most apologetic tone ever and Hermione gasped. So did Ron, which sounded more like a donkey's bray.
“Oh, please!” Draco rolled his eyes. “Who’s stopping you from going, Potter? You can go and make merry with all those ginger-heads and their… acquaintances,” Draco refrained from saying ‘mudbloods’ when he finally caught Harry’s furious eyes.
The first time Arya asked Harry to tend to his broomsticks, he suffered a major setback. All the progress he made was for naught, she realized, when she observed in their third session that Harry had broken his knuckles punching the wall in order to curb the pain the sight of his broomsticks caused. She hadn’t apologized because Harry’s reaction was exactly what she wanted to analyze and discuss. Yet she hadn’t learned anything in that session too as Harry seemed utterly closed off to anything she wanted or questioned. Still, she gave him the same assignment – Tend to your broomsticks. At least one is fine. Their fourth session was a bit more productive though Harry hadn’t tended to his broomsticks. He opened up about his Godfather, Sirius Black. No one seemed to realize how Sirius’ death affected Harry. And later, the war. The war was still a topic they haven’t reached yet but Arya knew that they’d get there. Baby steps.
Draco shook his head in an attempt to push those miserable thoughts away but it seemed harder to do so as minutes passed.
“I'll apply the Healing Salve after we finish washing up," Harry said while wiping Draco's blood away along with his semen using the wet hand towel.
Draco was tempted to accept the bouquet and move on. It was a daily thing in their household but for how long? If he left it like this, there was no telling when it could be far from okay. If they reached that point, there would be no forgiveness, no turning back. Harry needed some professional help and Draco couldn’t give into him now and let all his misgivings go.
"Ssh, Malfoy. Struggling won't do you any good. Stay still and I might just take pity on you," Harry smirked as he sat down over Draco, who was on his back on the floor, looking up at Harry with terrified eyes. Only this time, Draco knew that Harry wasn’t going to assault him sexually as he did months ago. This was to be Harry’s physical wrath thundering down on Draco.
one, if you’ve conveniently forgotten,” he rolled his eyes and took the chance to scan her attire. Ginny was dressed in a skin-fit neon orange top with off-shoulder sleeves and equally skin-fit black jeans.
“Yes, it’s me. Can you please open your eyes?” And he did. Curiosity got the best of him when the strike he expected never came. For a while, he blinked rapidly until his eyes adjusted to the pastel light in the room. They were alone in a tiny room and the candles overhead were dimmed so that the room was in a state of semi-darkness. It didn’t take long for him to find Harry’s eyes staring down at him in concern.
The gentle kiss brought him tumbling back to reality. His husband’s apology had been so sincere that for a fraction of a second, Draco really wanted to forgive and forget everything. Yet, a voice kept nagging at the back of his mind that there was another side to Harry. Tonight was probably Harry’s
“All of us lived under his thumb, saving our loved ones from his strike! Tell me, who did you lose in the war? Friends? Family? I lost my Godfather. I lost my friends! Who was responsible for their deaths if not you?!”
"Doesn't every Auror at the Ministry know that I'm here, Weasley? Where are the rest of you?" he asked, the answer obvious, at least to him.
“Merlin, I think I like the frigging bastard,” Draco’s whisper was loud in the quietude of their room and he hoped that his words would reach Harry, wherever he was, and bring him back to his side.
“Father. What are you doing here?” Draco asked not really politely, though that was exactly how he felt.
Draco stopped dead in his track and turned around towards his best friend since childhood, who grew a lopsided sneer. Did she really just... She couldn't know, right? It had been news to himself a few...
“Well, I do know quite a lot of people who do kind of owe me a few small favors.” Harry grinned and grabbed his phone.
Smirking, Harry pocketed the other wizard’s wand and they apparated back to the Ministry. They had been looking for this man for quite some time and luckily, with the help of Draco calling in from his undercover work, they had found him just in time.
“Show off, Harry.” Draco smirked and looked down at the Savior who still had his eyes closed. There was however a small grin on his face which proved that he wasn’t actually asleep. “You need to let me get up and go to work.”
Draco chuckled. “You know me, love. Once this whole bullshit it over, we can be happy together. Just the two of us, no idiots around.”
“It’s nothing…” Harry shook his head, trying to get his hand back out of Pansy’s grasps. She was not letting go, simply looked at him, as if he had lost his mind. Or maybe she had lost it.
“Really, how so?” another voice sounded and Draco turned to see Jason standing at the door frame. He seemed to have stopped working, as he was wearing a casual t-shirt and jogging pants, which Draco never understood how someone could wear these.
“Pansy wasn’t talking about Potter, to be honest” Theodore grinned as he placed he essay on his satchel. “And I have to say… I think everyone here’s right. Granger and Weasley shouldn’t  have waited this long to do something, if this would have happened to you, we would be destroying the Gryffindor Common Room and it’s not normal.”
There were so few houses all in different colours around that it wasn’t hard to figure out which of the softly illuminated living rooms was supposed to be the right one. In the windows, you could see people watching games, series or movies. One couple was playing with their dog, another enjoyed some wine while others danced around the living room. They were not the targets.
“Why again did you show me how to use a phone, Harry?” Draco growled as he watched Harry walk back into the bathroom. At the door frame, he turned around and winked at him. Draco groaned and fell back onto the couch again, opening his phone. This man was his downfall, almost certainly.
Draco pushed a rather stubborn strain of hair out of Harry’s face and looked back into his eyes. They were so soft, so full of love and hope and just everything Draco had ever wanted to see in his boyfriend’s eyes. Leaning in once more, Draco kissed him softly, breaking it too soon.
“Listen, Harry, I need to apologize. I’ve been nothing but a big old dimwit.” He sighed and raised his eyes to look at Harry. “For the longest time I thought Draco was hurting you, even if I had no proof. And I thought I would do so much better in helping you grow up – I realize I was wrong. I am sorry for all the trouble I have caused you, Harry. I never meant to be so… such a bad friend.”
“He never did. He thought about it when some witch was stalking him, I think” Ginny snorted. “If you continue like that, everyone will know about you and him. It’s only Monday!”
Draco was dreading the next day. He had to tell Potter who he was. Now. If he didn’t do it right now, someone might tell him who Benjamin Brown actually was. Tomorrow, he needed to leave and at best, take Potter with him.
Hermione shook her head over how her two best friends were behaving. “We just came to see whether or not you’re okay. But I think there are a few too many people here for you, huh?” she asked as Harry closed his eyes for a little longer than usual.
“Maybe I don’t want to anymore. Better off not surviving than being your pet whore,” Draco let his tears hit the ground. Minutes of holding them back had hurt his head.
Okay, so now the story's on the road to recovery. We're still in Harry's lane it'll not be long before we will also get to walk the path of Draco's recovery. It'll be slow. Probably mundane. But that's what healing is. It's boring but wholesome in the end.
"I want to. I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't know what overcame me," Draco said and Harry could hear the honesty lacing those words.
“Yes, Harry. It’s barmy but that’s what we all think,” Ron came to his Mom’s support and Harry clucked his tongue in annoyance before applying new tactics.
"Suit yourself then," Draco said through clenched teeth and continued eating his rice bowl just for the sake of it though he didn't feel hungry anymore.
“Yet you do not have the freedom to break in,” he countered futilely and before Rita could smart-mouth him, he asked the reporters, “What do you want to know?”
Thank you for being patient with my irregular posting schedules. I am just too cooped up with work and I have no time to indulge myself or my readers.
“Hermione, are you alright?” he heard Harry and a soft grunt signified that he might’ve hugged Granger.
Today, as he found himself plastered to the rough wall of their kitchen with Harry’s arm digging into his back, his entirety looming over Draco angrily, he reckoned, was Harry’s day of dementia. Draco grunted in pain at the impact and was sure that the wall left a few scratches on his right cheek.
The first time Harry took him out into the muggle world was a couple of months after Draco had started living with his husband. He had been skeptical and downright adamant about visiting muggle London for groceries. The only delivery boy worked at Fresh Market had gotten into an accident thus delivery services were halted till the shop owner hired a new boy or the old one was fit enough to work again. For four months after, no groceries were delivered to their doorstep; instead, Harry took Draco along with him twice a month to get all they needed. When Draco followed Harry into the lone garage, he supposed they would be driving there, given Harry’s house was close to the Muggle world. But, no. He learned that Harry’s garage was only for show and that he had not the possession of any vehicle, except a few classy broomsticks which lay haphazardly in one corner, a layer of dust piled on them. The garage was only a ruse for a convenient apparition point, the only spot in Harry’s house which allowed it.
Draco sighed, the fight leaving his body in a huff. These people never failed to give him a hammering headache. He closed his eyes and rubbed circles on his glabella with his index in order to curb the pain spreading around. When he finally gathered enough strength to open his eyes and face his unwelcome guest, he saw a mug of coffee hovering right in his line of sight.
“I don’t expect you to. I committed a crime, Draco. I can’t ever forgive myself for that. I still wish to have a baby with you, if our future permits. Despite everything, believe me when I say, I really do care for you.  And I want you to get better too. Not just me.”
“Filth like you don’t belong here,” her batty voice quavered not in fear like Draco’s did but merely because of her age. Yet her voice had a derisive edge to it which Draco couldn’t ignore.
The whispers we've exchanged during our heated passion in the room of requirement still buzz aloud inside my head. We'd been dating for a year and we wanted to take our relationship to the next level. We talked about it frequently as we cuddled inside a warm blanket at the Astronomy tower but never took that final step. When our seventh year was close and our sixth year was about to see its end, we somehow knew that we'd be separated for a very long while, given we were fighting on different sides. You knew, didn't you? Even when you sliced my chest open and almost killed your then lover accidentally on a bathroom floor, you knew that I was on your side. A few weeks after that incident, you couldn't show your face and avoided me like the plague. All it took was a letter from me saying that I forgive you to bring you to the Room of requirement, albeit reluctantly. And as soon as you stepped in, all I could do was lift you up, pin you to the wall, and ravish your pretty boyish mouth like a man starved for days on end. With your glasses askew, you looked so damn handsome. As I found a pleasure spot on the side of your neck, your nimble fingers tangled themselves in my freshly washed hair and your legs wound around my waist and somehow, telepathically, we knew that tonight was the day we consummate our relationship.
“How dare you insult me, you scum!” the old witch’s voice rose an octave, making it shrilly and raspy.
day. Would he stay the same when his mind was crippled with agony or would he once again revert to his old self and hit Draco? And if that happened, Draco was sure that day would be his last, if there was no one to stop Harry, given Ronald and Granger were busy with their own problems. Draco gulped in fear and looked away. He didn’t want to take that chance with Harry.
"I wanted to visit soon. But there was the issue of Harry and then my appointments. I didn't realize I was too late until today," said Hermione.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Kikukaku, serilla, LapislazuliStern, Wanda, Laura, Babygirl33, Solitarysoul, PeoniesandIrises, Irisk, JordanWithaG, and Papercutter for your precious comments. You always inspire me to do better and write better for my readers. Thank you so much!
She visibly winced at Draco's harsh statement and her stature showed how sorry she was for leaving Draco to his devices after Harry almost killed him. She should've been there for him despite all the bad blood between them. Besides, it was in the past and as adults, after almost a decade, Hermione wanted to let go. To forgive, if possible, where you could never forget.
“I said NO!” Draco interjected loudly and a wave of magic hit Harry, forcing him to step away from the blonde. Draco’s magic.
"Might've. It's been five days since the article's been published, hasn't it?" Hermione conversed with Ron.
Madcheshirefox, Rose, and Babygirl33 - your thread was so satisfying to read. I'm glad that the chapter pissed you off. Thank you really for your thoughts. Your discussion made me really happy!
“Do you ever miss him, Harry?” Arya queried him about Draco, an uncharacteristic frown marring her chubby face.
was he anymore these days? After Azkaban, had he any personality left? After Harry, had he any conscience left?
By evening, Harry was back with a bouquet of white and red roses and an apologetic look on his face.
“I can’t believe it, mate! After all these months… I am a father now!” Ron squealed. “My baby girl; you should see her, Harry. She’s the prettiest thing I’ve ever laid my eyes on. I feel like I’m over the clouds,” Ron’s toothy smile could rival the Sunlight. His face and his teary eyes shone brightly under the dim light of St Mungo’s.
“Remember the day you visited me in the Azkaban?” Draco asked, removing Harry’s glasses and gently wiping Harry’s wet and snotty face with Harry’s robes. They could be washed later. Harry looked a mess with tears and snot splattering his face. He looked a great deal younger and vulnerable as he sat on Draco’s lap, his palms still fisting Draco’s shirt as if letting go would kill him.
“I want to talk to him,” Harry countered as he fisted Ron’s grip of his shoulder, trying to pry it away.
"Good day to you, Mrs. Weasley. I fell down the stairs the other day. Rather disgraceful of me, I must say," Draco gave his best fake smile and willed Molly to believe his stupid but convincing lie.
And for the first time in what felt like a millennium, Draco found peace in his life and it didn't matter to him that the Weasleys and Potter were responsible for that or the crooked circumstances that led to his happiness.
Gently, Harry picked him up in his arms. He could’ve used a levitation spell but at the moment, he wanted to hold the blonde in his arms and whisper how sorry he was. He settled Draco on their mattress and went into the bathroom to wet a hand towel. He cleaned Draco’s face and the chafed skin of his wrists and ankles before draping him under a warming charm.
Harry watched with interest as his husband read the mail, numerous expressions floating across his face - shock, wonder, reluctance, and finally settling down on happiness.
Ron coming there certainly helped Harry in calming down briefly. When he was sure that Ron was out of sight, Harry took a couple of breaths to regain his bearings. The ruby of the bud Draco held between the fingers of his left hand glinted off of their wedding rings.
“You bastard!” Draco said dangerously. “If anyone, ANYONE at all is to blame for the death of the baby, it is you. Don’t you go prancing around accusing me of killing it because I never did!”
Draco wanted to die when his husband spat squarely on the dark mark. It was Harry acknowledging Draco to be an atrocious Death Eater like his Aunt Bellatrix, like his Father, like all the others who proudly wore the Dark Lord’s mark even in his absence. It was his husband screaming silently that Draco didn’t deserve the freedom he’d been so wonderfully given after eight years in Azkaban. It was Harry Potter against Draco Malfoy, not Draco Potter.
“Anyone give you this, Harry? Hm?” Draco asked breathlessly, grinding back into Harry’s erection, making him groan senselessly.
“It is our first Christmas after marriage, Draco. Molly is bound to make something special for us as she did for the previous couples. I don’t want to miss that, not because of your pureblood tantrum,” Harry’s mood riveted towards anger now.
Draco pulled Harry close by fisting the collar of his Auror robes before whispering seductively in his ear, "Doesn't that turn you on, Potter? Get on with it." Draco taunted, throwing a lazy yet confident smirk at a befuddled Harry.
He didn’t know how much time had passed since the bathroom but Draco felt relatively better as he opened his eyes. Looking around the room, he surmised that they were still at the Weasleys but judging from the darkness, he concluded that it was nightfall. He slept for more than four hours! Sitting up gingerly, the pain in his stomach felt like an illusion of the past for it seemed to be perfectly all right now. Pain no more, his attention found voices outside his door.
“You have to, ‘Mione. One step at a time, okay? Careful, lean on me. Yes, just like that,” Harry groaned shortly when Hermione finally got up and put her entire weight on his left side. Holding her up seemed to be an excessively hard task but he wasn’t going to let go of her. They just needed to get to the hospital and she’d be alright. Besides, where the heck was Ron?!
He heard a thud again, followed by a deep groan that didn’t sound like Harry’s voice at all. Alone in the house, Draco feared that someone must’ve broken in. Arming himself with his wand, he silently crept out of their room and towards the staircase. The sounds seemed to be coming from the living room or the kitchen. As stealthily as he could, Draco got down the staircase when he heard a deep moan. That wasn't a tone take by someone who broke into a house. Rather, it sounded like sex to him. But who in their sane mind would break into Harry Potter’s house to have sex on his sofa?
It really didn’t matter, as Harry leaned in and kissed him softly. This time without a camera sound. When he wanted to separate though, Draco did not let that happen and continued kissing his boyfriend, until he was lying in the couch completely, Draco right on top of him. Once Draco let go to get some much needed air, he opened his eyes to find a complete dazed and love-struck expression on his boyfriend’s face.
While he walked into the ball room, Draco heard him say under his breath: “Come back when you’ve found a proper wife, before that you’re not welcome.”
Before he could say more, Madam Pomfrey had turned around and looked incredibly happy. “Thank you so much, Severus! This will surely help little Mr. Potter to gain back any kind of health reducing problems he had had. We’ll start with two vials a day” she looked at Severus to see whether or not he was agreeing with her, before she continued. “And after a week we’ll check up on it again for the next week.”
Kira smirked. “Better than ever. He has gotten back onto the field and in Maiselle’s name, you should see him fight! He actually got back almost a fourth of what we lost in the last few centuries. It was awesome!”
“He’s not serious, right?! Harry’s been here for three weeks and they only now want to see if he’s fine?!”
“Pansy Parkinson!” Harry raised his eyebrows at the witch who was still holding onto the camera. “If you don’t put this thing away and let me and Draco have a moment, I will hex you!”
“That is not pureblood behavior, little Slytherin Prince!” she called after them, once Draco and Harry had already entered the hallway, laughing loudly.
“Don’t look so surprised, Dray” Harry chuckled. “We both fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. Both of us had the potential to be dead. It just happens that…”
Harry burst out laughing and shook his head, while Draco pulled him to his side. And with some light banter, they made it to the Great Hall, where breakfast was indeed already being served. Draco was incredibly happy to see Harry’s hungry eyes over the food. He wasn’t sure he had ever seen Harry look at food like that when he had first come to stay with them.
Surprised by this answer, Harry nodded and grinned then. “I think I like your idea!” Leaning back in his chair, Harry was convinced this would be the thing he needed to get Draco to go on a date with him. He was definitely going to ask him for help about the potions theory.
in your life!” Draco snarled, trying very hard to keep the sparks out of his eyes. Harry was sure that nobody else would be able to see that. All they could see right now was the two of them having serious problems and Draco being an absolute idiot.
Smiling, Harry pecked his husband’s lips, before another thought appeared on his mind and he smirked. “Love, if they ever do Amortentia as a way of realizing how much in love we are, do I have your permission to have my own little anger directed towards you?”
His best friend since childhood grinned. “Do you remember how I told you about this professor for Memory Recovery things?” Draco nodded silently, which made her continue. “Well, I got a letter back, once I said that I wasn’t kidding and that it was important.”
“I’ve got my sources” Harry answered, deciding not to bring Minerva into this mess. “But I am terribly upset that Daphne didn’t tell us! I thought we were close friends!”
He turned to Severus, clearing his throat. “Lord Snape, Head of the Noble House of Snape, do you accept to take a son of no birth into your house, to adopt him and treat him as your own?”
Draco knew he had to tell him, eventually. He’d rather tell it himself than having the Aurors stop by and take him with them. So while he spent the morning on the hill, he tried to come up with a solution of how to tell him that he was in fact Draco Malfoy, the Auror, without hurting him too much. He now also had to deal with his new found feelings for this Golden Boy.
Harry walked out of the kitchen, chuckling. “You guys haven’t even seen everything on the bottom floor!”
“I mean, look at that cute dog!” Draco said loudly as he entered the Common Room together with Padfoot. Harry was hanging back a little and tried desperately to bite back a grin. Inside the Common Room, most women were surrounding the black dog and petted him.
“You know, Potter” Malfoy started and brushed a snowflake off his shoulder as if it was the most important thing in his life. When the snowflake was gone, he looked up and grinned maliciously. “For someone who has won the war, you’re mental walls are really shit.”
He hadn’t lied to himself over that one simple fact for years. Perhaps, he’d been brainwashed by the hordes of magazines and newspapers that plastered Potter’s face on every edition, always the same few images (from the single photoshoot Potter had probably been coerced into a couple of years ago) or a grainy picture of Potter leaving a restaurant, or a pub, his hand up to block the lens. The entire country had been convinced he was a perfect person, an incredibly accomplished wizard for his age.
Potter had taken up residence of the second chair behind the till, left his shoes under the table, and allowed an easy yet tired grin to slip between his shallow dimples. There was something about him - the sparkling eyes, grumbled complaints, the padding of his feet as they followed Draco’s own around the store - that convinced Draco that Potter wasn't the worst company an ex-Death Eater-turned-librarian-slash-bookseller could have.
His hand fell back to his side as he heard footsteps draw closer outside, crunching through the gravel. The steps paused at the open door, before tentatively walking across the threshold, heels knocking floorboards.
That gaze – Despite everything they’d been through, Draco felt that he’d never grow to regret what came next, no matter how unprepared he was. Maybe, sometime in the not-so-distant future, Harry would piss him off and be bloody righteous and so fucking Gryffindor. But Draco wouldn’t regret choosing to smile at Harry and striding forward. His broom fell to the ground and Harry’s eyes widened.
Fletcher was frozen, her shoulder hunched as she fought a shiver. “I haven’t felt magic like that since the–since the…”
Potter pulled open a door that seemed to roll open along the length of the abomination and gestured to take a seat. Fletcher easily climbed in, slinging herself in one of the seats near the front.
“Has our nation’s golden boy got an anger issue? I guess you didn’t get your temper from the Dark Lord after all.”
“Mr Draco Malfoy. This is an announcement from the Ministry of Magic.” Harry’s tight grip on his wand eased a fraction as his eyes slid between the green patronus and Draco. “Narcissa Malfoy has died-“
In the daylight, the potential cult got up to nothing of interest. Their activities mainly seemed to consist of playing with child-level hexes and tossing them at nearby trees in some bizarre competition that involved juggling a set of pinecones. Besides that, they gathered firewood and lay around in tattered sheets, making enough conversation to keep the camp awake.
But Potter was climbing back into the driver’s seat before long, wiping his hands on the denim jeans to which he seemed to be emotionally attached.
The common room felt calm again. Draco smiled down at Harry. If this was to be their last night, he would make the most of it.
“Surely there are better ways to approach this ridiculous search than this? What’s that muggle phrase…? We’re looking for a needle in a 300 square mile national park.”
“You really need to work on your ginormous ego—” Draco remarked as he laid down in the vacant space beside Harry and let the covers fall on top of him. His toes were cold from the stone floor. The chill was spreading from his toes to his hips and above, egging on his muttered complaints. “Ordering me about, clambering into
Draco adjusted his stance under, what must be, Potter’s invisibility cloak as the hot touch seeping through the fabric of his robes disappeared. The steady flow of body heat from his side didn’t move though, not even as Draco stretched the cloak to its limit, taking a small step away. He tried to forget the man beside him and focused on the case.
“I’m not sure my answer will satisfy you,” Draco replied swiftly. He tugged the blanket up to his chin as he spoke, shuffling beneath it so that his limbs lay strictly separate from Harry’s because he could already feel the heat flooding out of Harry. It was too tempting for a man like Draco, far too tempting.
“You were wrong.” Draco folded his arms, rolling his eyes. His expression was slipping though, as Harry smiled, clearly not buying his act. “You don’t know me as well as you think you do.”
“To be vulnerable.” Potter propped his elbow against the side of the sofa and pressed his cheek into his palm. His voice was picking up its usual tone. “I guess it’s my turn again.”
Unfortunately for Draco’s sanity, they then spent the next hour going through her infinitely long train of thought. The sun had set by the time he’d allowed to raise his head and stretch.
She dropped him off at 10 am, leaving him to stare up at a quaint building. The stairs were a steep climb and the reception was unimpressive and rickety, only a high, circular desk separating him from an ancient witch hunched on a stool. Her glasses were perched on the very tip of her nose, her wrinkles extended from the corner of her eyes to every inch of her face and her hair sat on the top of her head in a messy slob. He introduced himself and signed a disclaimer at her command, thanking her politely as he strode two paces to the trio of seats opposite. They all sank willingly at his presence.
“You’ve done plenty for her, for us both,” Draco said quickly, not quite realising in time that it was gratitude toppling across the table to Potter. “There’s no need.”
Her chatting, meanwhile, began grating on Draco’s patience after a further two hours huddled in the cold. She continued regardless, talking to herself when Potter and Draco’s murmured responses lapsed into stony silence. They were staring out at the group when the moon reached its peak.
It turned to chuckling as a pair of second-years scurried past clutching textbooks and sharing high-pitched giggles. Harry Potter and his ex-Death Eater boyfriend was hardly new gossip but the mention of sex might be enough to put them over the edge. Rita Skeeter’s unpaid intern would be banging at his dorm door before he knew it.
As it came to be, they grew to understand each other, to accept what couldn’t be changed and quietly apologise under flaring sunsets.
Draco blinked. “You can’t always get what you want.” He said simply, calmly, and rolled his eyes. He was rather sick of people thinking they could find the
“I’m fine. There are a few final guests to attend to, and then, I’ll grab a drink.” Draco replied, swaying into Harry’s body a fraction as he looked around the room.
Potter parked up fully on the edge of the road, receiving a few loud beeps from cars passing by – no doubt for his shocking parking – and climbed out the car, dropping a good foot’s length to the ground.
“Professor, I have been given the official will of the Potters. Is there someone you know who could assess the validity of this document?” he asked, half expecting not to get an answer.
Harry inhaled softly, happy that all the attention was away from him. He was sure he would have told them the truth in a matter of minutes. Luckily, additionally to Draco’s teasing, a few more people arrived at the Great Hall for breakfast and the topic of Harry’s lateness was quickly forgotten. At least that was what Harry hoped.
Pansy chuckled. “These are all the pictures of the Christmas banquet you took. Those are of everybody” Pansy pointed to the left pile, while Draco frowned at her.
“Watch it, Draco” Severus interrupted him and Draco sighed. Yes, there was no other choice. He had to take baby Potter and somehow take care of a baby.
As he walked back, Padfoot happily walking next to him, he thought of a way to get to talk to Draco. It looked like they had to meet during the night – probably in the Room of Requirement, where both had all the time in the world to talk and be themselves. As he finally reached the entrance level again, Ron walked towards him, Hermione in tow.
So, he entered the Hospital Wing to find Severus and McGonagall sitting around there. Frowning slightly, Draco took the opportunity to talk to the headmistress without having had to climb up to her office.
It still wasn’t working. Next to him, Nott was leaning against the house, his wand between his teeth, looking out onto the lake.
Draco blinked faster and bit his lower lip. That was such an amazing thing his boyfriend just did! Since he didn’t like his former favorite movie anymore, Harry had gotten probably all the movies he could find. Just for him! He was feeling so much love from this idiot, sitting on the floor.
“How did we not see that?!” He shook his head and followed his friend inside. As he passed Harry, his aftershave stayed in the air and Harry felt the light amber and musky scent almost too much. He leaned at the door frame, closing his eyes to get this stupid feeling over with.
Harry shoved Draco with his shoulder and grinned. “You’re the worst husband. And I also hate that Daphne made it sound like we married because of true love or something.”
Harry simply shrugged, as he had apparently been dealing with a few things. And this scar had according to Madam Pomfrey been there for a few hours. Luckily, they had visited Madam Pomfrey early enough and she could heal it. Well, it was a magical scar, so there would be a scar remaining, however, not the sentence, but simply a somewhat giggly line. She then canceled the spell Draco had cast upon Harry, so he was once again growing in his fast rate again.
Potter’s nonchalance did unspeakable things to him. That and the fact he was apparently openly flirting... Draco shook his head, while he closed the door and leaned against it. Maybe he wasn’t flirting. Maybe this was his personality...
“How long has this been going on?” Draco looked very concerned. With the lack of a good night’s sleep his pureblood mask wasn’t entirely there, though it could also have been the imprisonment having changed him. Harry had to admit that he hadn’t seen much of the emotionless mask yesterday. He seemed rather open about his feelings.
Harry relaxed further, finally being able to let his body feel the emptiness, the weariness overcome his body.
Pansy interrupted him right before he was able to talk about what he was dreaming off. “What were they about?”
Draco smiled and lifted him from the ground into his arms. “Of course, bear. But maybe you should eat something, huh?”
Draco laughed and raised his eyebrows. “Careful now, Bill. You make it sound as if you’re not that in love with Fleur.”
He couldn’t finish, as Harry interrupted him quickly: “I know it’s true, Draco! He came to rescue me and… Bellatrix killed him! He fell through the veil in the Ministry and he… he was just gone!”
Draco had thought that his childhood had been unfair, but reading this, he was ashamed of himself. Doing chores once a week and helping house elves cleaning the table every other day was
He really wanted to eat the chocolate, but since he didn’t know how long he would need to the school, he decided to get up again. When he did, he heard a voice from the stream.
Draco hiccupped, his sobs finally ending and he held on tightly to Harry’s shirt. “But I… I couldn’t… This… I…”
Harry frowned and was just about to shake his head, when he widened his eyes. “Ravo... Yes! My penguin! Our story.”
This time, Draco couldn’t contain his laughter and he shook his head. “Um… we’re not naming strawberry cakes, bear.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he should say. How would he react if he’d really gotten a divorce from Draco? Definitely not like that! Draco had been right when he had offered  a day ago that his husband could pretend to not want a divorce from him. If Draco ever wanted a divorce, Harry would be on his knees, begging for him to come back, to change whatever he needed so his husband wouldn’t leave. He just couldn’t live without him, he never again wanted to be without his one true love.
Harry smirked. “Well okay. Think of the Marauders, then. But I’ll doubt that’ll help you.” He got up and walked to the kitchen where Draco heard him opening a bottle of wine.
Charlie held open a red curtain and looked at Draco. “You can call for Dross. He’s my oldest House Elf and knows where to find us.” She nodded at Pansy and they left, while Draco stayed back watching his ward intently.
Malfoy looked up from the computer and even smirked. “Don’t worry, Potter. I’ve long ago made peace with the fact that the
“I am absolutely certain she has” Harry laughed and led Draco to the door, where he knocked. Not a second later, it was opened by Ginny who grinned at them.
The answer to that question came rather quickly from outside when Connor called out Harry’s name once more, followed by... “Draco!”
“I know. I just wanted to make your father unwelcome.” Harry chuckled and kissed Draco softly. “Tonight at mine? I’ll make you some comfort food?”
Harry pulled him even closer, feeling so loved and happy. Hopefully, he could give Draco a little bit of that comfort as well.
Pansy grinned at Draco. “You are so far gone from the bully you were when he was youn… older” she gave him a lopsided grin.
Suppressing another sigh, Harry forced himself to smile. “Peter, I told you to grow with the times. Listen, how about you come over on Monday and we’ll look at everything together. Maybe Maria can help with some information.”
Draco caught it and Pansy threw him a thankful look, before turning to the boy around her leg. “Hi darling! How was your day?”
Since the pain in his stomach wasn’t really getting better, Harry decided to just try and get up. Hopefully today was another good day. He wouldn’t like for Draco to see him go from a very good to a very bad day.
“Yeah, well, we both seem to have a little too much fun with this game” Harry smirked. “So, what are your plans this afternoon?”
“Unless you forget about it” Harry remarked and earned himself another glare, though this time from Hermione herself. He grabbed a piece of Treacle Tart and wanted to stick out his tongue to Draco who had a hard time hiding his grin.
Neville widened his eyes. “Wow! Congratulation, mate! Who’s the lucky lady then?” He frowned. “Wait, no. Who’s the lucky lad?”
“He is!” Harry laughed and petted his head. Dag hooted and apparently confirmed it. Draco chuckled and shook his head.
The flickering light and the sounds of an alarm brought Harry back to reality. He saw his ‘dog’ sitting across from him with a tilted head and staring at him, as if he could tell that something was wrong with him. Well, that wasn’t that hard. He had a few problems which were obvious and then a few more which couldn’t be spotted easily.
“Well, with any luck, we don’t need more fake flings” Harry chuckled. “Did you promise him a raise?”
“I fell asleep with you in my arms and I woke up in a room by myself. For a brief moment I thought everything that happened was just a dream. I mean… being turned into a baby and then having my childhood nemesis with whom I’ve been in love with forever taking care of me” Harry grinned. “That does sound like the things a dream could contain.”
It wasn’t an overcomplicated case, although cults were never simple. They were interwoven with complex theologies and ties of loyalty. They could be dark, they could be harmless. The Dartmoor Forest case seemed to be anything but.
” Draco began, clearing his throat midway. “It was all nonsense, of course. I wanted to ensure this wouldn’t cause any trouble, um, going forward with this case…”
Potter actually beamed at him, the brightest grin Draco had seen all day – although, the stink of his breath left much to be desired – then he retched. The dry cough of air brushed Draco’s arm and he pulled away in time for Potter to grab a nearby plant pot and throw up. He had to look away, the sound was enough as Potter vomited a little longer.
Draco considered it, turning back to the campsite. “They don’t have any other mode of transport.” He realised, “Although, all of them look to be of age, why wouldn’t they apparate? Why this forest?”
“What the fuck are you doing, Potter?” He hissed, disregarding the fact that nobody could hear them in here.
“Ernie spends every Saturday morning by the lake, Draco. He’s not here.” Harry told him with an amused smile, shaking Draco’s hand away. “How is it that I know your roommate’s habits better than you do?”
No matter how long he observed their behaviour and no matter how many pieces of parchment he filled with notes and remarks, he couldn’t understand.
“You really need to sleep more,” Potter whispered, his eyes scanning Draco’s with concern, disregarding the simple fact that he was the sole reason that Draco didn’t. (Well, maybe not the
It released a whining creak as he pushed it open and found Potter sat on the grass verge, his hair twisted in a crown of moonlight. The man didn’t react to the door opening, nor the sound of Draco slowly lowering himself onto the edge of the minibus.
He ducked behind a tree while Ares looked nervously toward the sound. By the time, his gaze returned to find Draco, he was left to search the vacated space in confusion.
Mr Griffin was in no state to answer any ground-breaking questions. He deserved the peace and care that this institution could provide him without three nosy investigators forcing themselves where they weren’t welcome. And as much as Draco wanted to solve the case and move on to another challenge, this wasn’t the time to push. Griffin’s mind wasn’t for excavating.
If there was a single thing that caught Draco’s eye when he looked at the Dartmoor Cult, as Fletcher had officially started calling them for case consistency purposes, it was the behaviour. Many of the individuals acted like children.
He lowered his gaze to the pot-bellied character that was printed repeatedly on Harry’s pyjamas. What use did an 18-year-old
Draco rose to his feet, following the woman from one uncomfortable, rigid seat to a tattered couch in the only adjoined room. The door clicked closed behind him. The woman was directly in front of him, a notepad placed on her lap. She smiled unconvincingly. A pair of teacups was floating between them, spoons stirring the contents.
“No, nothing that will hold up in a trial.” He glanced back at the group. They looked harmless enough, many of the members were too young to know any complex magic, and they probably couldn’t fight off an Auror and two relatively experienced wizards. “Why don’t we take them in for questioning?”
He was striding down the long, dusty corridor, a picture of pure elegance and grace. And as he caught Harry peeking from their alcove, he smiled. An automatic smile, a small lift of his lips that grew into a toothy grin, out of his control. The kind of smile that made his face lose the years of trauma, the kind that felt like home. It
“I promised no such thing,” Potter said over his shoulder. His eyes looked sunken from the drive, but a smile toyed at the corners of his lips. “Seatbelt on.”
It was, in fact, an extremely peaceful half an hour. Fletcher seemed to take note of the atmosphere too and relaxed into a slightly-less-than-perfect posture as Shacklebolt rattled through the items. Nonetheless, Draco was still eager to escape to their little nook in the case 341 office. There he could experience complete peace and work through all the problems that were supposed to unravel with a simple tug but didn’t.
The kettle released its final hiss, releasing a burst of steam, and provided itself at Draco’s disposal, who swiftly poured himself a cup of tea.
“God, yeah. Look, I’m sor—I mean, I shouldn’t have turned up here.” Potter said quickly, a hand moving to rub his neck. “Although, I appreciate that you didn’t turn me away when I needed… help.”
Draco quietly prepared the van’s concealment, watching Fletcher munch on her snacks out of the corner of his eye. It took another five minutes to complete the charm and locate any blind spots he’d missed. Potter finished at a similar time, vanishing through the back of the minibus, and shouting through, his voice distant.
Tonight was no different, except for one meaningful disruption that left Draco wondering if Potter would ever come find him again.
Draco blinked away the fatigue that was provoking his thoughtless actions. “Fine. Second door on the left, although I’m sure you remember that much from last night.”
Harry had come out of nowhere; one moment, Draco was taking a detour to the library, making the most of his free period with the looming pressure of exams hovering over him. He had a plan: find a seat somewhere in a dark corner of the library and ignore human existence for two hours until he wrapped his fatigued head around five of the examinable arithmancy assignments. Pansy was under specific instructions not to speak to him until the weekend.
childhood, my parents. I still do but I can’t do anything to change it, just as much as I can’t change the Dursleys.”
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter said once he’d returned, taking the large step up into the driver’s seat. “Here.”
There wasn’t much chance to protest once they reached the riverbank, Potter grabbed their forearms and side-apparated them back to the minibus.
Draco stared at it. His slender fingers trailing down Harry’s arm to delicately trace its outline, the same look of disbelief crossing his expression. Always the same incredulity. Draco leaned down to press his lips to the tattoo, soft lips grazing the skin with a tremble.
Draco noticed out the corner of his eye that even Potter was coercing his body to compliance through its exhaustion; his feet dragged slightly against the floor, his hands dangled heavily against his thighs. Something in those runes had caused this. Perhaps it had simply been the strength of the spell. Some ancient magic relied on draining the magic energy of all living beings within the perimeter, but Draco had only seen it mentioned on a handful of counts, it certainly hadn’t been a large enough area of magic for any further research. Most spells he’d seen referenced relied upon a natural magic of the land; they leeched their fuel from the very soil.
“No, you have a huge crush on Luna Lovegood.” Draco said, and when Fletcher opened her mouth with denial printed upon her expression, he added, “Don’t deny it! She’s the new editor and I’ve seen you not-so-subtly pick up a copy every month since her promotion.”
“Red tape,” He answered as though that explained everything, and continued rummaging through a nearby bush. There were twigs knotted in his hair and he looked quite uncivilised.
, it read. Potter was smiling at it, ripping away the plastic to take a bite from the chocolate within.
An hour after midnight, Draco kicked away the covers and lingered on the edge of his bed. The room hung in a calm quiet; Fletcher’s voice had settled to gentle murmurs and Potter wasn’t there. Draco’s heart raced for the shortest of moments and letting his sleepy mind guide the way, he slipped his boots on and headed for the door.
Fletcher hopped out of the office when she heard them coming, then produced a cocky lean against the door frame as a sly smirk slipped onto her lips.
“Get to work, the both of you.” He said instead. “I’m going to grab some lunch. Don’t cause any trouble.”
. Who the fuck was he if not that? But Harry’s intentions didn’t seem vicious. So, Draco absorbed Harry’s sharp glare and sighed. “Come sleep, Harry. It’s too late for this conversation.”
“Mr Potter will be reporting to me on a fortnightly basis and he will be briefing you.” Shacklebolt looked as though he was going to say more but restrained himself. His eyes narrowed slightly in Draco’s direction instead. “I expect full professionalism for the duration of the case. You’re both dismissed.”
By the time they made it back to the group’s campsite, it was abandoned. Besides, a few dead carcasses were scattered around the fire, skinned to the bone, of course. Fletcher had to look away. The same runes were carved into three points around the campsite border, the same pattern. Draco noted them down.
Her eyes scanned the situation momentarily as she nodded, settling upon the correct response. It was a simple, “Yep. I think one of the young ‘uns had wandered out of bounds and set off one of the alerts I’d rigged.”
A faraway thought drew closer to the forefront of his mind, some obvious truth he didn’t even want to contemplate. So, he remained thoughtless as he trudged back to the observation spot, thankful for once that he wasn’t wearing robes. It was easier to move through the terrain without them, plus he saved several sickles on dry cleaning.
He didn’t like exposing his back to it. He felt vulnerable and he couldn’t bear it: the familiar feeling of fear that nestled into his heart. He moved away, stepping out of the clearing by a foot’s length. The heavy weight lifted.
“You’re such an idiot,” said Harry, turning until his hips were pressed against the counter and he was looking up at Draco, a smile resting easily on his lips. He reached up to brush Draco’s hair back into place, long blonde strands resting on his forehead, and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s lips.
The minibus itself didn’t throw up any complaints like a thestral or a badly charmed broom might – they could’ve even travelled by
. I’d apologised to Luna and Weasley and Granger, even if they hadn’t accepted it, and the teachers and all the bloody house-elves I could find. I guess it all came out at once when I saw him that morning.”
As they landed down the street from the Ministry, tucked neatly behind a large dustbin, and Potter pulled his arm away, Draco found himself wanting to spend a little longer in his universe.
“You’ve been spending far too much time with Dumbledore’s portrait,” Draco said, using his valuable choice to ignore Harry’s heavy words for a while longer. He watched Harry grin sleepily. “For now, I will choose to sleep.”
Fletcher herself clambered into bed and cocooned her body within the duvet, only a nose left in the open for oxygen. Draco made dinner against his body’s pleas. It took tremendous strength to lift a single arm and stirred the pot intermittently, but he managed it.
have for such childish clothes? Draco would rather a slow and painful death than give up his silky, black pyjama sets. Perhaps Potter ought to invest in a pair... His mouth ran dry at the thought of Harry wearing them, the hems riding up to reveal soft, pale skin and—
They walked the corridor without a word, lost in their own thoughts. Fletcher, the Ravenclaw of the pair, was undoubtedly already running through the case facts in her mind – slotting the puzzle pieces together as though it was a two by two jigsaw. Draco, meanwhile, was forecasting everything that would push Potter’s and his strained civility to its limitations. Seeing each other before the first coffee of the day, for instance, could derail the previous five years of seemingly neutral ground they’d found.
Draco took his time to analyse the lazy smile on the man’s face, categorising it as unthreatening, before carefully uttering his lie.
Shockingly, there was nothing for two miles and Draco’s heart sunk, realising perhaps they should have headed upstream instead. There was no point turning back now.
It was a simple enough ordeal to order a glass of house wine - red, obviously - and the haddock. Potter ducked out of the risotto, instead opting for steak pie and a pint of beer. The menus were taken.
However, with her somewhat natural charm, she’d tempted Potter into some light chatting. They talked in quiet voices, discussing some other unsolved case that neither had wrapped their heads around yet. Fletcher was still laid-back about her theories, suggesting she hadn’t yet grasped the case.
“I know,” Harry said softly, “I love her, and Ron, you know that. They’ve been my family for eight years, but I can make my own decisions, Draco.” He offered his hands once again. “C’mon.”
Another ten minutes was spent stood at his side before Potter rolled onto his arse and stared up at Draco, a smudge of brown puke at the corner of his lip. The toilet was flushed a final time, once Potter had wiped his mouth, and then he was on his feet. He still looked unwell, his gaze unfocused, but the sway was far less pronounced, and he looked tired, not drunk. It was almost a relief.
He stood there a moment longer, then he took off in a sprint, dragging Draco by the hand. Harry ducked into every room, just quick enough to catch the house pulling away the white sheets in the dining room and the reception and the kitchen. But by the time, he had released a whining Draco to run up the stairs into the first bedroom, the house had outpaced him.
They spent far too long browsing the menu. Suspiciously so for Potter who had been adamant on the risotto the entire walk over, less so for Draco who was trying to minimise any small talk they’d inevitably become engaged in. His eyes slipped over the choices of wine another five times before the waiter appeared, notebook in hand, unconvincing smile fixed in place.
Now, Draco was no mastermind chef, but he managed to whip together a semi-decent French dish from the sparse ingredients Potter had stocked their tiny kitchen with. It was fortunate that Fletcher had set the standards so low last night, for Draco’s dish didn’t look half as appetising as he hoped. But as Potter and Fletcher took slow first bites, he was mildly relieved that neither so much as flinched at the taste.
He lifted a single hand to gestured at the wall as a smirk settled on his lips. “Besides, I had to check that there was room for my vast collection of erotic artwork - I think our self-portrait would be perfect for this spot, just above the stove here.”
Fletcher nodded, but Draco scowled to himself. This would be a much easier technique if they flew…on brooms, in that flying car Weasley had hijacked in second year, even on a stupid hippogriff! But Draco didn’t kick up a fuss under Fletcher’s watchful gaze and stomped off in his designated direction, kicking a few extra tree roots when their inconvenient positioning pissed him off.
“Only one interviewer please,” The nurse stopped Draco with an outstretched hand. “Arthur often becomes agitated when there is too much attention on him. This should have been mentioned in the debriefing.”
They didn’t say much for the rest of the afternoon as Fletcher flicked through her books and made half-hearted notes. Draco tried to help, but his hands shook each time he tried to write a sentence. It was as though he’d lost the skill; Draco had been capable of writing in his swoopy cursive since the age of six, he couldn’t simply
Draco just nodded and Harry’s touch was gone as quick as it came, though it skimmed his lips for the briefest of moments. He clasped the door handle in his palm. “Goodnight.”
Fletcher perched in the middle of the two men, unsubtly swinging her attention from one to the other instead of observing the case suspects.
“I agree,” Potter said as he sauntered into the office, and Draco had to stop his jaw from slackening. He never thought he’d hear Potter of all people agree with him.
“If you don’t mind,” Draco said, rising to his feet and hooking Harry’s hand in his. “We have somewhere to be.”
“Brilliant.” Potter said, ignoring Draco’s mental daggers and smiled at Fletcher. “I’ll send you both the details by tomorrow.”
He read until the floorboards behind him creaked. Draco twisted quickly, grabbling for his wand. Potter looked at him with his head tilted to the side, a curious expression on his face. And Draco froze, his wand pointing at Potter.
But I'm doing my best to get the next updates out as soon as possible. I appreciate there may be small errors, despite my vigorous editing, but thank you for sticking this out so far!
Draco slipped out of his covers and padded across the room to the bathroom, scooping up a pile of clothes he’d laid out last night. “You should watch your filthy mouth, Miss Fletcher.” He smirked.
Draco laughed humorlessly and shook his head. “Do I look like it? Well, if my mother would have a say in it, definitely. The girl wasn’t even fifteen, I think. And they’re from France, they probably never heard of the Malfoy name.”
“I have always wanted to go skinny dipping in the lake. Now, we’re back and we’re doing it” he sounded as if he was close to laughing. “If you’re not coming with me, I’ll be divorcing you.”
He smiled back at his ward and nodded. “I know. What do we have to do to get him to deal with his traumatic past?” he asked when he turned to the worker. However, he seriously doubted that this man could answer his question. Maybe he needed to ask for the man who owned this shop. Oliver had always seemed to have a special bond with all the animals that lived here. No matter how short.
He had arrived a little early to talk to High Executor Nelson, and she had been quite surprised to find Harry Potter as a baby. She was very welcoming and just now entered the room again, though nobody else had been with her.
And now, he wasn’t eating. Had he always been that way? How much had he eaten when they were at Hogwarts together? Draco had always watched him, but he never thought to check on how much he was eating. The fact that neither Hermione nor Ginny, who both kept a very close watch on Harry, had come to talk to Draco made this even worse. It seemed as if Harry had been starving himself not only at home but also at Hogwarts.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You could have told me that you recognized me. At least then I could have been honest as well.”
“I’m leaving!” Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed half of the tea to go. “Enjoy my apple tea, you big bully.”
The Slytherin nodded and smiled, before he vanished behind the secret door that seemed to disappear as soon as the wood touched the other wooden parts. By now, the knocking had intensified. Harry rolled his eyes and took a few more steps to the door and opened it spirited.
Draco pressed a kiss on Harry’s forehead and they stayed like that for a moment. Finally, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand. “Come on, let’s see if we can release the idiots from the basement.”
Harry leaned in, kissing his husband softly. “It’s just a year, my darling. One stupidly, tiny year. We’ve had ten years of relationship so far. I don’t plan on stopping. So, now we’ve got a year basically separated? Won’t keep me from thinking about you” he said and tucked a strain of hair out of his husband’s face. “Besides, just think about how amazing the sex is when you’ve had to restrain yourself for a few months.” He winked at Draco, who snorted and shook his head.
As Draco stares into the mirror, something twists inside him, a snake coiling in his chest. He had thought the change would make him feel happy, or… pretty, but he finds himself grimacing at the limp way his hair just... hangs around his face now. He doesn't look at all like his mother. He looks like his
There is, in theory, nothing that Draco couldn't ask Aunt Andromeda. So, trying to channel some kind of inner Gryffindor, Draco takes a deep breath into a tin of saffron biscuits and asks, "Has Teddy ever tried looking like a girl?"
They're ostensibly drinking tea together, though Draco hasn't touched hers yet. Well, no time like the present to remedy that, if only to stall for time. She swallows down too large a gulp of hot chamomile tea, and starts to cough.
!" Teddy yells excitedly, his high-pitched seven-year-old voice surely carrying to wherever in the house Aunt Andromeda is.
Dikē gasps, unconsciously covering her mouth with her hands as she looks down at Harry, down on one knee on their dirty kitchen floor. He holds up the same carved ring box as the one he used the last time he did this, but there's a new ring in the box now.
Frozen heart pounding, Draco steps even closer to the mirror as he desperately tries to get his hair to look exactly like it did before he started messing with it.
He rises from the bed, takes a step closer to the mirror. A memory flashes through his head, an image of himself standing in front of a much more ornate mirror. He's six years old, or thereabouts, his grey eyes glassy with excitement as he tries on a necklace that Aunt Fiorentina left behind after a recent visit.
"What?" Dikē asks, transfixed by Harry's eyes now like she just was by the ring he's still holding out to her. "I mean, I already agreed to marry you, remember?"
, Draco corrects himself. And not for the first time either. Every time he imagines his upcoming wedding, for some reason he pictures himself wearing one of those white, fluffy, Muggle-style wedding dresses that look like decadent meringue confections.
Again, silence stretches out between them. Draco keeps staring out the window, afraid to turn and see the face Narcissa makes when she's unhappy but trying to hide it (the "just bitten into a lemon"-face, Harry calls it). The once-cursed grandfather clock ticks and tocks in its corner. Narcissa sips her tea – maybe she's the one stalling for time, now.
Now it's Draco's time to freeze – and then almost blurt out The Secret without even thinking. But just then Teddy storms into the kitchen, Harry in tow, demanding firstly cookies and secondly that Draco finally comes to look at the new broomstick.
Narcissa nods encouragingly, and suddenly Draco feels like crying. She turns towards the window again, and addressing the peacock/peahen she says, "Mum… I think… No, I know. I'm a gir-... A woman. I'm a woman. A trans woman."
sure played around with her gender presentation quite a bit. I'm not even sure she really thought of herself as a girl, at least not all the time."
– watches an albino peacock (or maybe a peahen, it's hard to tell from this distance) pecking at something down on the manor grounds. She jumps and turns away from the window at the sound of her mother's voice.
"I don't know, actually," she says at last. "It's hard to tell with a seven-year-old. At that age children really just look like children, you know? I mean, sure, he wears his hair long sometimes, but long hair isn't just for girls, obviously – and he never keeps it for more than a moment, really. He stays the same a lot more than Dora did at his age." She chuckles. "Well, she never really stayed the same for long, no matter her age. But speaking of Dora,
Aunt Andromeda barely has time to show up in the hallway to say hello before Teddy is racing out into the garden to show off his new toy broomstick. Harry follows, ready to admire, but Draco sneaks off to the kitchen with Aunt Andromeda instead, to help her get the tea things ready.
As they hug, Harry drags his fingers through Draco's inadvertent new haircut, and Draco can't help pushing into his hand like a cat.
He has dragged the mirror into their bedroom, because it's the only room with permanent anti-Apparation spells, and Draco very much does not want to be interrupted right now.
The word thrills through her, now that she's noticed it. It whispers of dresses and veils and invitations with
Back in the here and now, twenty-eight year old Draco twirls a finger through one of the strands of hair next to his face, futilely trying to will a curl into it without actually using magic. When he lets it go it just falls back down, as thin and listless as the rest.
Unable to take her eyes from the ring, Dikē is vaguely aware that she should probably say something.
Turning his hands over, the glint of his engagement ring catches his eye. Goblin silver that doesn't blacken, intricately inlaid with dark green vines. Slytherin colours. It's beautiful. But... Pansy's engagement ring has a diamond the size of a grape on it. Not that Draco would want a ring like that. He wouldn't; it would look stupid on his veiny man hands.
Harry had told her that he'd take her out on a special date tonight, so Dikē had finally worked up her courage to ask her mother for hair advice. Her hair is still not as long as she wants it, but with Narcissa's help it now frames her face in wispy tendrils that makes her feel like a Muggle's idea of a fairy princess. She's even wearing the bold red lipstick that she bought weeks ago but hasn't dared to try yet.
