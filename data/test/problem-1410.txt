“Fun? I don’t see anything fun in being married to you, Potter!” Draco screeched.
“Yes, that’s true. Teddy, meet Draco” Harry introduced them.
Harry couldn’t suppress a light chuckle, relieved for the lack of maliciousness in Malfoys friendly mocking voice. They worked in silence accept for Malfoys instructions and Harrys muttered „Got it“s.
Potter hit John over the head and dragged him outside. Like hell he would let his colleague flirt with Malfoy any longer!
The next day, Draco felt like in trance. He went to work, though Astoria had tried to persuade him to take a day off. Last night was spend with a lot of crying, eating ice cream and stopping Astoria from running on a rampage and burn Harrys flat down. Draco was utterly exhausted, but he needed work as a distraction.
All the way to the Great Hall Hermione kept up a steady stream of onesided conversation and shooting Harry knowing looks. Harry tried to focus on her words and not on the turmoil of feelings inside of him. Everybody was staring at them and Malfoy ignored him again. His hand was so warm and soft, Harry had to suppress the desire to squeeze his hand and interlace their fingers.
Phew, now was the time for that famous Gryffindor courage. “The last few weeks, you didn’t speak to me or even look at me. I’m frustrated, because you ignore me. I feel hurt, because only I don’t seem to be worthy of your attention. Seeing you flirt with Ron of all people made me very angry and jealous, because I thought that you maybe like him. I really don’t want you to like Ron. I want you to like me. I want you to look at me and only at me. And most importantly, I want to taste your cherry lipstick. So please, kiss me?”
Blinking, Harry turned to the blonde. “Stop what?” he asked confused. Did he do something with his hand? He glanced at their joined hands. Nope, no squeezing, no circling, no traveling.
Reluctantly Harry made to grab Malfoy left hand, but Malfoy quickly snatched his hand away. “I’m lefthanded, you oaf”, Malfoy hissed and held out his right hand.
“Maybe he is annoyed, that you’re staring and talking about him so much” Ron muttered.
"Don't think I'll forgive all that dressing up and tricking so easily, Thrushbeard. It's a good thing you've got the rest of our lives to make it up to me now." Draco teased with a smug grin.
“My knight in shining armour!” the blond exclaimed and batted his eyelashes.
“Kiss me again”, Draco breathed in a needy voice. Oh, the kiss was perfect. Harry ran his hand into the gold blond hair and felt with delight how a small hand wrapped around his neck. The kiss deepened as Harry snuck his tongue in Dracos mouth.
“Harry Potter, it’s so nice to see you.” Luna answered dreamily. “I see you’re wrackspurts have gotten away. I believe it’s thanks to your lovely company.” She peered around him at Malfoy, who sat stiffly and eyed the food suspiciously.
“Don’t just stand there blushing like a lovestruck maiden! Come in already and explain”, Astoria demanded, watching Draco standing the hallway.
Oh, the challenge was on. Draco would hold Potters hands, alright. He would show the Gryffindor he was superior in hand holding. And talking. Draco would talk so much, Potter will be filled with useless knowledge and opinions. “You wish”, he tried to sneer but his mouth twisted into a sincere smile.
“ Harry asked in Parseltongue.
Oh, if only Draco had listened to Luna and not been bothered by the smell of fish. Then he would have been in a safe place and not so dangerous at the gate. He was a complete failure.
After the meal the beggar took his guitar and hummed, seemingly lost in thought. Draco took the time to look at his husband properly for the first time. His gaze glided over the ragged clothes that suggested a well-fed and strong body underneath.
“I guess, so.”
Satisfied, the blond took the pot from the fire and put it on the table where the beggar was already sitting. It was a bit too salty, but Draco was so hungry that he devoured the sparse meal greedily. The beggar watched with a gentle smile as his husband ate enthusiastically.
It was like our regular sex, but at the same time, it was completely different. Maybe my senses were heightened from the battle like my magic was. Maybe it felt so much more emotional because I died.
Still stiff with shock, unable to comprehend what had happened, Draco followed the beggar.
Arriving at the Arithmancy classroom, Malfoy dropped Harrys hand as if burned and fled into the room, sparing Harry not one glance.
"You will," replied the beggar stubbornly. The man gave Draco a hard look that didn’t tolerate disobedience. "Because I command you."
Luna leaned towards him and whispered, “Harry is staring really hard at you. I bet he thinks you’re cute, too.”
Dracos cheeks were now a rosy colour. They must have stared at each other for quite a few minutes, because Hermione broke their muffliato and said “Time’s up. We’re done for today.”
Ron’s lips began to wobble and Hermione patted his head reassuringly, urging him to go on. “By now I know more about Malfoy than I know about you. Or Hermione. I just want to eat my meals in peace without you pining after Malfoy.” At the end of his speech, Ron broke down in tears.
“Fifteen minutes of holding hands and you’re asking that now?” Draco couldn’t help but giggle. “Where’s your famous Gryffindor courage? We have already done more than that.”
"How is this possible?" Draco was stunned. His Potter, who could no longer be his Potter, was Gryffindor King Potter, and still his Potter.
Harry turned to the blond and asked “Will you be okay? You don’t have to go in, you know.”
“Of course, dear” Aunt Cecile replied kindly. “Now go dance with your boyfriend. I must say, you’re the perfect couple!”
Another knock sounded. Annoyed Draco let his grip on Potter go and muttered “I haven’t ordered anything else.”
Oh, shit. Harry’s really going to say it. “Fuck it. I’m in love with Malfoy, aren’t I?” Harry yelled and hid his face in a cushion.
Harry laid his forehead against Draco’s. He looked intently at the man he loved and asked, "How was the kiss? How was my chin? Did it not sting you?"
Suddenly I’m being picked up and clutched to a trembling chest. I’m in Hagrids arms, whose whole body was shaking with sobs. I wanted to reassure him that I wasn’t dead, but now was not the time.
“So that’s it? I’m fucking pregnant?” Draco said blankly. Harry smiled stupidly, “It’s real love!”
“Please tell me, you instructed Colin to take lots of pictures! I have to print that image on a t-shirt!” Seamus wheezed when he got his laughter in control.
“Oh, uhm. I’m waiting for Malfoy. We’re supposed to hold hands all day as punishment for our fight earlier”, Harry explained, flushing a little.
“Hermione, just so you know, I spoke with Ron just now and, uhm” he fidgeted, fingers playing with the sleeves of his robe, “I realized, that I kind of like Malfoy.”
Right at that moment Neville stumbled into the common room. Spotting the banner, he asked the group “Intervention banner, what’s that for?”
The millet soup seemed rather bland to him. So the prince looked for more side dishes and found some herb pots by the window. He used them to season the soup.
The other boys face was a lovely shade of pink that reached up to his ears. He seemed just as giddy as Harry felt.
CLATTER
The Auror that came with Potter snorted.
Potter looked like he wanted to argue but was elbowed by his colleague. “After this we’re off duty. Mind if we join the party?”
He moaned, "Stop. I can't go on. My feet hurt. My dress is already torn. Alas. My hair's all mussed up."
The other candidates did not fare any better. One earl was too short – “Short and thick is never quick”. Another duke was too pale – “As pale as death. Are you sure you will last long enough to satisfy me?”
“So, bridesmaid, huh” Ron tried to lighten the mood. “Is Malfoy going to wear a dress?”
“Well, yeah.” Harry frowned. “But isn’t that normal? I mean, I should know things about my enemy, right?”
Harry meanwhile stood on the other side of the market in his knights uniform with Ron and observed the lively activity of the market.
Potter’s grin turned predatory as he leaned in to whisper into Draco’s ear “And then?”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, but the family name has to be chosen during the bonding ceremony and can’t be altered afterwards.”
But I meant it to. I really was done being the Chosen One, the saviour. So I said “Is a wedding vow sufficient enough or do you want me take an unbreakable vow?”
“Yeah, you’re right”, Ron conceded. “It was more talks of ‘Malfoy’s up to something’ now it’s ‘Some part of my body stands up for Malfoy’.”
“Draco, please calm down. I just want what’s best for you.“ Lucius tried desperately to stop his son from destroying the roman knight’s armour, his favourite piece of art in the whole castle – and that’s definitely not because of the silver peacock adorning the metal, mind you.
“I’m so sorry, Draco”, cried Hermione. Sighing Draco got up and hugged her. “Don’t be. Somehow, all your shitty spellcasting is the best thing, that happened to me in my life. I can’t even scold you properly! It’s all your fault, that I’m so happy right now.” He kissed her cheek and whispered “Thank you for giving me this family.”
Draco didn’t bother to look at them directly. He arched a delicate eyebrow at the mirror. “And what if I am, Weasley?”
Draco couldn’t hear anymore, his ears were ringing. His chest constricted and he was sure his heart stopped beating. He had to go away from here, far far away. He blindly stumbled outside.
"You...you love me?" Draco asked hesitantly.
Brushing the lips Harry dreamed of kissing for weeks he said, „And I want you
“For the brightest witch of our age, you’re bonkers.” Draco snapped irritated.
Carefully peeling the arms of the person he obviously spend the night with from his chest and waist, Draco sat up. He felt nauseous and dizzy and wasn’t sure, that feeling came entirely from the hangover.
His brilliant plan to give his son Draco to the beggar and bring him back a few weeks later was not so brilliant at all. In his zeal, Lucius had completely forgotten that he did not know how to get the prince back.
Draco did not respond to the king's words or hands, but he did not evade the touch. Harry took this as a good sign and continued.
“Ah, famous Mr. Potter”, Lucius sneered when Draco entered the living room. Draco flinched.
That... That was Draco's treacle tart!
“First of all, Draco, did you finish some badges?” Draco flushed and gave Luna a badge for inspection. “They are wonderful, Draco. You really are skilled. It must have taken a lot of time and effort to make one.” Luna praised and pinned the badge on her sleeve.
Rons face heated up. “You wish, Ferret Face. Are you into men, now? What would your dear father say, if he knew his only son was a poof who liked to behave like a girl? You’re disgusting!”
CRASH
"Pah, I didn't want him."
Blaise handed the potion over and Draco drowned it greedily. He felt his head clearing, but wasn’t so sure, he liked it. He had a sudden sense of dread.
) and swishing her wand at them. Shit.
Delighted Fleur exclaimed, “Comme c'est beau! Vous parlez français?”
“I’m sorry, you are stuck with me.” Dracos voice was very small, vulnerable. After the war, society was very forgiving to him and his family. That didn’t vanish the guilt though, that Draco felt. Their forgiveness didn’t make Draco a better person and Potter deserved better.
„Sure, Malfoy“, Potter shrugged and smirked. Potter, the prat, was smirking rather a lot today. It was a good look on him and Draco wanted to snog – eh, punch that smugness off Potter’s face.
Slowly, the blond prince's lips formed a smile. "That's good, because you can't get rid of me. We are married, after all."
When Slytherin’s prince finally looked at him, Harry knew exactly what to do to maintain his attention.
Ron laughed. “And what are you doing in that club? Running around, hugging people? Fuck, that image is hilarious.”
Now, Hermione turned incredulously to Harry. “WHAT?”
His friends had warned him not to go, because there were rumors of the princes nasty personality. But here was King Harold mingling amongst the other marriage candidates. He was the only one wearing a mask. He didn’t want to start a ruckus in enemy territory before he even got to speak with Draco.
But before Draco could leave, the king rose from his throne and the servants stopped.
“I know, your schedules are not the same today. So Mr. Potter, if you would be so good as to escort Mr. Malfoy to his classes and pick him up, after?” Not waiting for an answer, she dismissed them with a shooing wave of her hand. “That would be all. You can go now. I would advise a short trip to Madam Pomfrey.”
“Okay, then I will take over that task for us both. I can teach you, if you like? I’ll show you housekeeping spells, too.”
“But not too loud”, the Prince reprimanded as the Lord was already on his way out.
“Oh, roll on home, Mr. Wine Barrel. Have a good trip”, Draco waved his hand lazily in dismissal.
Hermione paled. "Is it because of the diagrams and graphs?"
I then saw Ron and Hermione making their way towards us and promptly apparated me and Draco into my bedroom in Grimmauld Place. I really didn’t want to stop what Draco and I were about to do.
"Harry, why are you dressed so shabbily? And where have you been the last few days?" Hermione asked suspiciously.
The beggar was clothed with all sorts of utensils and many instruments, and very submissively lifted his hat, which was already pierced. The beggar took a leap of air and screamed "IAH" like a donkey.
Potter seemed to consider this and nodded slowly. “Not what I hoped for, but I let it count.” Potter bowed and offered Draco his arm.
Stop. Hold on.
Draco was having the time of his life. Who knew marriage interviews could be so entertaining? Right now he was putting some dorky looking guy whose name he had forgotten in his place. “Repeat after me: I am a donkey.”
Merlin, if that wasn’t the cutest sight, Harrys ever seen. Groaning, he thumped his head against the table. That was it, he was dying because of Malfoys cuteness. Malfoy being nice to Luna was a lethal combination.
Draco took a deep breath and signaled the guards that he was ready.
“I live to entertain” Draco drawled and leaned over Blaise to straighten his tie. “Ready to get married?”
Draco blinked again. “Oh, that’s a shame.” He let his eyes roam over Potter again. A great shame, indeed.
The King faced the candidate to his left.
After finally escaping the celebrating crowd Harry got into the locker room. Glad that his teammates already finished showering he undressed. He wanted some time alone to relive the match and think about Dracos smile.
“I’m a cursebreaker and your bond with Harry really is interesting. Mind if I ask you a few questions and perform a few spells?” Bill asked. He seemed alright for a Weasley, so Draco nodded.
“I’ll wait here for you.” Harry kissed Dracos knuckles before letting go of his hand. Draco was sure, his cheeks were flaming, when he entered the house. Merlin, that man would be the death of him. He was so touchy since this morning. Even if Harry didn’t love him, at least he was attracted to him and worried about him.
Every word the prince screamed was followed by another loud crash resulting from a mahagoni chair that was slammed continously on the ground like a rockstar would destroy his guitar.
The next morning Draco awoke on top of Harry yet again. This time though, he couldn’t extract his body so easily. Harry was hugging him to his chest and every time Draco tried to wriggle free, the arms around him tightened.
“Hey, kiddo.” Harry nuzzled Teddys cheek and the boy giggled.
“That’s hot as fuck” Draco breathed and jumped me. My arms full of blonde, I vanished our clothing resulting in Draco moaning loudly. “I didn’t know, you could do that.”
“Je parle un peu. J'ai appris le français dans mon enfance.” Draco smiled. It was a while since he spoke French and it was nice to activate his rusty skills again.
Way too soon though, Draco had to end their dancing when the pain of wearing high heels the entire day became too much. Already lamenting the inevitable loss of Potter’s proximity, Draco disentangled himself from the Gryffindor.
His shift was almost over, when he had an inkling, that something really bad was happening. His ring –he couldn’t bring himself to take it off, though Astoria had wanted to cast
“Furthermore, Harry, you don’t have a reason to be ashamed. In fact, in the wizarding world homosexuality is a common occurrence. One famous gay wizard, for example, was Professor Dumbledore, who–“
Ron was incredibly relieved. At last his friend came to his senses. He hurried to catch up with him.
"Oh, I am so happy. A wedding at last. My sweet little Harry is growing up. Hah, I can hardly believe it. I remember the first time he came into my kitchen. He looked so small and starved. That this skinny boy would grow up to be such a gorgeous man! And now he's getting married! Our Harry Potter!" chattered Molly as she chased all the kitchen staff back and forth.
“But you should stop now, love. There are people watching.” I tried to still Dracos hips, but he kept rutting against my thigh.
With his fingers in his ears King Lucius slowly approached the prince. He motioned the guards who sneaked up cautiously as not to scare away their prey. The guards were glad to wear armour, because the prince was known for biting.
Draco was here. He was working in the kitchen in Harry's castle and did not let himself be spoiled by noblemen. He was here and not starved or dead.
“You don’t know that! I remember Ginevra throwing a really strong Bat Boogey Hex in Hogwarts!” Yesterday, Draco thought it would be okay, but now he was scared as fuck.
“No, but I’m certain she figured it out. In fact, I think all of Hogwarts already knew about your feelings before you did. You’re not very subtle, Harry. And I told Pansy, because she was the one who gave me the idea for the intervention. Apparently, all of Slytherin had one for Malfoy and it helped.”
“Wait, at least let me change the name!” Draco cried desperately when they were ushered out of the office.
After weeks of careful observation he found the blonde to be nothing like the years before. The Slytherin was ready to help the underclassmen when they got lost in the labyrinth of stairs and corridors or when they needed tutoring for their homework.
"Don't whine, darling!" the beggar scolded happily and started strumming a song on his guitar. "Sing along, it'll make you feel better."
Harry laughed. “What the fuck, Potter!?” Draco yelled. Harry laughing at Dracos misery was too much.
"Hush", the beggar held a finger to the prince's mouth. "Do you not hear? The thrush sings... Don't frighten it away..."
I held Malfoys gaze, getting lost in the grey-blue spheres that were sparkling so mirthfully. Ron glared at Malfoy, hissed “Shut up, ferret face” and pushed me into my seat.
“Well, nobody calls Edward by his real name, too, but is it proper? No. Besides, why should I get myself dirty?” Draco said haughtily.
Astoria glared past Harry and hissed, “Get in the house.” When Harry tried to enter, she held her hands out. “Not you, Potter. Just Draco.”
Draco also froze as the king's gaze fell on him. He knew those green eyes. Not from the kiss in his father's castle. But from somewhere else.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, anything. But Molly shoved a pastry into his mouth and eyed him critically. “You’re so thin. But we’ll fix that right up.” She patted his cheek and turned to Harry.
“No, Harry. I don’t hate you!” Draco interjected but Harry didn’t listen to him, because he had worked himself up into a panic attack. His whole body shook and tears were streaming down his face. “I even took your virginity out of fun! The first time isn’t something, you do on a whim. It should be something special. And you were so drunk you can’t even remember it. I took advantage of you. Shit, I’m such an idiot!”
"Even you, Molly. Please give me a moment with Draco." Ordered the king when the cook did not move. Reluctantly, she obeyed, leaving the blond boy alone with the king.
“Ehm, professor.” Malfoy asked, blushing furiously and sounding absolutely mortified. “What if we–“ He closed his eyes, took a calming breath and tried again. “What about, when we have to go to the bathroom?”
The blonde held up his right forearm, showing the letters
“That’s good, then. I myself slept most splendidly. I had a very nice dream.” Harry grinned. There was a glint in his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite decipher. Draco usually took pride in reading peoples emotions easily, but when it came to Harry he was lost.
Out of sheer pride and defiance, Draco had refused to admit to the beggar that he had no idea how thread was spun from wool. Not to mention the weaving of thread into fabric. But it couldn't be that difficult if the rabble could do it with simplicity.
“Did you bring that husband of yours with you?” Lucius inquired. Draco nodded, unable to speak. “Good, bring him in. I want to have a word with him. And you, son, go to your mother and console her. She is devasted, you wore such a frilly dress.”
My magic swelled and then lashed out. I screamed “What the fuck, Tom? I’ll kill you, you filthy scum!” Before Voldemort could react, I was on him, intend to punch the shit out of that bastard.
“Ehm, Draco, there is a man in your bed”, Greg said staring curiously at the bed.
Malfoy gave her an incredulous look. Harry just shrugged, feeling oddly happy with the knowledge of Luna approving his whatever-it-was with Malfoy.
"We only have this one," replied the black haired man. He tapped the space next to him and said, "Come here."
“Draco, you look so cute with flowers on your head.” Luna said, admiring Draco who violently shook his head.
Helplessly, Draco followed. Over his shoulder he gave Harry and Andromeda a pleading look, but his aunt said while smiling warmly “It’s alright, Draco. We’ll acquaint ourselves when Teddy has tired himself out.”
“Alright” Draco conceded. “What do you want?”
“Mmh, how about saying something bad about his hair?” Ron mused.
Potter was the beggar, was the horseman, was the king, was his husband.
The blond looked at the bed, which seemed very narrow. And only now did he notice a problem. "Where is my bed?"
“I’m not calm, not really. I’m rather nervous, actually. I always wanted to believe, that there was someone out there in the world, who’s perfect for me. I dreamed of having a soulmate. And I’m very happy to have found mine.” Potter smiled a sweet, genuine smile and Draco felt a pang in his chest.
His thoughts returned to the blond Slytherin. It wasn’t so much his outer appearance but his aura that had changed, Harry registered. Last school year Malfoy gave off fierce aggressiveness. Now there wasn’t the feeling of baseless hate and superiority. He looked…approachable.
Sobbing, Draco dropped himself onto a bench in the kitchen. Molly hurried to him immediately and embraced him. Before she could ask what had upset the blond boy, the kitchen door opened.
“Aren’t you going to thank me?” Potter asked.
“Draco, darling!” Narcissa exclaimed and flung herself at her son. She kissed his cheeks, slapped him and kissed him again. “How could you elope like that! I understand, it’s romantic, but the childs wedding is a mothers dream! And you wore such a silly dress, you looked like a five year old girl. Don’t pout, darling”, Narcissa admonished and nudged his nose. “You were a very sweet bride. Promise me to have a grand anniversary party next year, that you’ll let me organize, and you will be forgiven.”
So, he did what he always did when Malfoy got on his nerves – he went flying. All week, Harry had trailed after the blond for the sole purpose to find out what he was up to. And how conspiratorially Malfoy just laughed with his girlfriend, he definitely was up to no good. But Harry was left unsuccessful. And he was feeling rather frustrated and somehow a little depressed after Parkinson, that bint, had pressed her breasts against Malfoys toned arm.
That’s exactly how Harry found them, when he ran into the room wand at the ready. “I heard you both shrieking, are you alright?” When he couldn’t find a source of threat, his eyes rested on Astoria and Draco, entangled and flushed on the floor. “Uhm, did I interrupt something?” Harrys nostrils flared for a short moment and there was a dangerous glint to his eyes.
Gaping, Harry looked from the professor to Malfoy, who looked equally as shocked. He looked to McGonagall again, waiting for her to call it all a joke and send them to Filch, so they could polish everything in the trophy room or something.
“Oh, how wonderful. I thought nobody would come, but I already have two club members.” Lunas soft voice floated into the room.
“Because that will work well”, Harry scoffed. “He will just continue ignoring me.”
“Grandma told me, the dragon is your husband, is that true?” Teddy looked up at Harry with wide eyes.
Not yet truly convinced, Draco asked, "And what was all that about the pottery stall?"
Shocked, Hermione realised what the Gryffindor King had concocted. "Oh, Harry! You married the Slytherin prince!"
“Hey, Luna”, he greeted softly and began to fill his plate which wasn’t that easy with only one hand.
Draco stared at Harry wide eyed. “What the fuck, Potter! I told you, I fancied you since forever. Why would I need other options, when in my heart the only choice is you?”
Potter’s eyes bulged, “Bridesmaid?”
The problem was that Malfoy ignored only him. The Slytherin was the same bossy brat as always to all the others. So, when Malfoy commented on Nevilles potion, Harry saw his chance to push himself into Malfoys focus and initiate a fight.
my side.“ Then he captured the soft mouth in a tender kiss.
Ginny narrowed her eyes at Harry and declared “Your obsession with Malfoy.”
But the professor was dead serious. “Now, Mr. Potter if you would take Mr. Malfoys hand, please.” Voice not tolerating any argument, McGonagall gestured from Harry to Malfoy.
SPLASH
When Draco looked up at the king again, he revealed a scar across his forehead. But Draco looked only into the green eyes before him and realized...
"And then you just disappeared. I looked everywhere for you. I thought I had lost you forever. But then you were here, in my castle. You have no idea how relieved I was to see you. I gave this feast today so that everyone would see how much I love you."
As Ron, Hermione and I went out of the dungeons to our next class, Ron muttered “Told you, mate. He will always be a git. You’re sleeping with the enemy.”
Draco’s attention was then drawn away from further musings about Potter’s interesting reactions by the announcement that Neville was going to throw his bouquet.
Thanks to the high heels, Draco was the tallest. He gracefully kicked Pansy out of his way, squealing gleefully “Take that, Pansy!” – he still hadn’t forgiven her for breaking the silencing charms at Blaise’s stag night – and elegantly snatched the flowers out of Granger’s outstretched, waiting hands. Draco would have liked to take pride in his Seeker’s abilities, but his triumph was all due to his long limbs and Granger’s shortness.
The game was exhilarating. Draco held a very professional playing style and Harry was struggling to keep the upper hand. He never felt himself so challenged and this was pure bliss. In the end the Gryffindor clasped his fingers around the small golden ball.
Luna didn’t seem disturbed by Dracos rage. She petted his head and whispered something, that promptly made him shut up and his face got even redder.
I looked directly in Voldemorts red eyes and shrugged as if to say “Yep, I really am that dumb.” Resigned to my fate I sighed, “Hi, Tom.”
Draco tried to bake a pie. He was very pleased with the end result. He had not made a skirt, but at least he had made something to eat.
Oh. Draco didn't expect that. It sounded like a tempting offer. Never working again. Wear beautiful clothes all day long and eat the finest things. He could live like a prince again.
Harry lay his free hand over his heart. “Malfoy, you hurt me! I swear I am a gentleman and would never touch your underwear before we even kissed! So, whatever twisted your knickers, it couldn’t be me.” He then leaned towards Draco and whispered in his ear “Though I wouldn’t say no, if you wanted me getting in your pants.”
Draco soon relaxed and found, he enjoyed himself immensely. After the warm and overwhelming welcome he got to know each of the Weasleys and came to the conclusion, that they were nice to be around. Even talking to Ronald was pleasant.
Eagerly, the men approached without giving the goods even one slight glance. "This is very nice tableware. Did you make it yourself?" said the man with light brown hair.
The day was torture. Potter had such a curious nature and asked him all kinds of questions. It was hard enough to ignore him for a few hours. He couldn’t do it again, he was sure of it. But he kind of wanted for it to happen again. Maybe Potter would step out of line again, soon. Draco certainly wouldn’t try anything himself.
Draco was convinced that his father would calm down after a while and forgive him. It was always that way. Draco would simply stay away from his father for a few days. At some point, father would miss him too much and spoil him again.
With one hand he squeezed Zabinis hand, with the other hand he ran along Notts arm. "I am not worthy of your kindness. Unfortunately I cannot go with you, but if you buy some of my goods, it is as if you were taking a part of me with you. After all, I made the dishes with my own capable hands."
“I’m sorry! While searching for a way to break your bond I found this spell, that could enable same-sex couples to receive children of their own, if it’s real love. I wanted to tell you normally, I swear. But I drank so much and you told me, you really wanted to have kids and I just kind of performed the spell. I wasn’t even sure that it worked.” Hermione said helplessly.
“Yeah, but it feels so intimate.” Harrys cheeks flushed. Draco stared at him wide eyed. Merlin, that man was cute.
When Malfoy cornered Ron against a wall once, asking if he wanted a taste of his chapstick, he was trying a new flavor, Harry had enough. He decided he had to do something. He really didn’t want to start a fight with Malfoy, but he had to confront the Slytherin somehow to get his attention.
As soon as the beggar entered the castle he was greeted by the red-haired captain who stormed him with questions.
"The kiss was good, nothing bothered me," replied Draco, blushing deep red to Harry's delight.
“Let me try.” I imagined my finger coated in slick, so I could slip them easily in Dracos ass. As soon as I had formed that thought my fingers were wet. Immediately I got to work, preparing Draco thoroughly.
The beggar went outside the door. But he did not close his eyes. So he could see that the prince was really very, very beautiful. His white skin without blemish, his blond hair golden in the morning sun, curves in all the right places on his slender body.
“You should have listened to the whole, conversation, silly. I said, I was tired of it, because I had trapped you in this marriage. I wanted to break the bond, to set you free. I wanted to give you a choice. I hoped you would still choose to be with me, but out of your own free will and not because you didn’t have another option.”
Neville shot Harry an annoyed look. “Please, Harry.“
“Hey, I’m not that small! You’re only taller because of the Heels” Potter grumbled but let himself we swirled around by Draco.
Wiping the last tears from his face, the blond man squared his shoulders. He thanked Luna and headed towards the castle.
He nearly had a heartattack when the blond prince announced he chose Lockhart. But it was all just a trick to get rid of the slimy bastard.
Just what was Potters objective? Why was he suddenly interested in Draco? The blonde had a very bad feeling about it all. That definitely wasn’t the last he had seen of the stubborn Gryffindor.
Draco was startled by this touch and pulled his hands back. Immediately, the brown haired man was at his side and touched Draco's arm. "Blaise, do not frighten the poor child," he said to his companion. Then he turned back to Draco, leaned against Draco's face and breathed into his ear "My name is Theodore Nott and this is my business partner Blaise Zabini. What is a beautiful child like you doing in this crummy market? Such beauty shouldn’t be wasted in such a place. Wouldn’t you like to come with us?”
Harry carried him until they stood in front of a restaurant. “Have you eaten pizza before?” Harry asked.
He needed just a bit more time to annoy the blonde, just a bit more forced proximity.
“I didn’t know you cared so much, Weasley. So, you’re noticing things about me. Is it perhaps, that you’re interested in me and fantasize about me in a skirt while making out with your girlfriend? My, you are so lewd.” Malfoy drawled.
Hermione widened her eyes and immediately scrambled to gather all her textbooks and notes she had scattered for reviewing all over the table. I helped her grabbing all the stuff while Ron stuffed another pancake hastily in his mouth.
Landing on the ground, Harry made his way back up to the castle. Harry wasn’t good with feelings, he needed help for that.
The prince was not used to the long walk. After hours of running around he had enough. What was this beggar thinking of, dragging him behind him as if he were a cow.
Harry shook his head in obvious disgust. "Ew, Ron! Ginny is like a sister to me!"
The End.
Dazed he looked up to the man that kissed so wonderfully and asked, “What are you hiding under your mask? A crooked nose?” The mask covered only the upper half of his face. Draco could tell despite the mask that the black-haired man before him was incredibly handsome.
The black-haired Gryffindor stared helplessly at this crying mess of a best friend. Admittedly, he really talked a lot about Malfoy. But that was only because Malfoy was definitely up to something! And if he noticed Malfoy's devilish good looks from time to time then surely he would be allowed to point that out! He opened his mouth to say as much but was hushed by Hermione.
‘Salazar, you can’t be serious. Is this person really that dumb?’, Draco slowly but surely lost his temper. He screamed, "Get lost! I will set all dogs on you! The guards will shoot at you and my servants will beat you!"
Draco stared impatiently at the door. Behind him, the party was at its peak. The Weird Sisters were blaring trough the stereo, people were dancing excessively or chattering enthusiastically. All inhibitions were lost thanks to Luna’s special punch. It was a very dangerous drink which made you feel woozy with just one glass.
‘Cherry?’ Harry thought faintly. He wanted a taste, too.
Malfoy glanced at Luna who was currently admiring her badge again. He took this chance to give Harry the finger. Harry suppressed to urge to lean forward and suck at it.
Draco, however, left all the excitement cold. What did he care about the king's wedding? Granted, this could have been his wedding. He could’ve had the handsome king and all the pomp. Stupid Potter with his stupid castle and his stupid lands and his stupid kissable lips.
"You should have seen him flirting with all those men. He never flirted with me like that and I am his husband!" Harry tried to explain himself.
“You okay, Draco?” asked Greg worriedly when the blonde wrapped his blanket around him like a cocoon.
„Oh, finally!“ Neville exclaimed and took a piece of parchment out of his robe pocket. He unfolded the paper and began to read very gravely. “Harry. I cannot stand idly by –”
“Harry, you really should overthink this carefully. Malfoy has a really bad reputation. There is a reason he’s called the Slytherin Ice Prince. It’s like he’s devoid of any emotions like compassion or empathy. Parvati says half the school has had their hearts broken by him.” Hermione took my hand and gave it a squeeze. “I’m very worried he will hurt you, Harry. You should stop before you’re in too deep.”
Even Draco could not stop smiling. He leaned over to his husband and kissed him on the chin that he had insulted so badly a few weeks ago.
The beggar rolled his eyes and lifted Draco into his arms. The prince cried out in surprise and resisted. But the beggar was surprisingly strong and did not give in. With a cheeky grin he said, "I forgot, we are newlyweds", and carried him bridal style over the threshold.
The mood in the castle was very depressed, but at least Draco had his freedom. But he could not fully enjoy his freedom. He caught himself too often dreaming of green eyes and vividly remembered the soft pressure of firm lips against his mouth.
Draco blushed. “I know only a little bit from what I learned as a child.”
Slowly, the blond prince reconsidered this offer. He and the king had only had a brief encounter during his father's engagement attempt. And Draco was the spouse of a beggar and looked as such. Even if he met the Gryffindor King, he would surely remain unrecognized.
But it wasn't until everything was demolished that the rider distracted his horse from the stand and disappeared through the gate, followed by the red-haired captain.
“Harry Potter! Come to die…” Voldemort sounded almost wondrous, as if he couldn’t believe I was really dumb enough to walk into certain death.
“Why me? I haven’t said anyth–hmpf” Ron too was promptly silenced by a pastry.
“Oh, yeah. It’s about a secret agent called James Bond. Is this your first time going to the cinema?”
“I promise. I’m never going to leave you again. I’m done with being a hero.” I murmured against his lips.
Resigned to his fate, Draco decided to indulge Teddy. “Yep, that’s me. Nice to meet you, Edward.”
The next thing I perceived was the scent of earth. Slowly I could hear voices from excited Death Eaters, until Voldemort hushed them.
He opened the kitchen door a crack wide and indeed. There next to Molly Weasly stood the blond prince cutting various vegetables. Every few minutes Molly pushed a small snack into the prince's mouth, and the prince hummed a short buzz as a thank you.
Unsuspecting, Hermione entered the common room. She was in good spirits because she had just finished her homework for the next three weeks and could now spend the time revising her notes. Of course, her notes were colour-coded.
When they emerged at the Weasleys home, they were greeted by a sea of red-heads looking at them curiously. Draco went rigid, staring at the people before him like a deer caught in headlights.
“You what?” Dracos voice was that high pitched, the glasses at the table began to vibrate dangerously. Potter whistled appreciatively.
Draco's eyes widened in fear as the horse did not slow down and he jumped to the side in fright. The horse kicked against the stand, which fell over.
Draco looked at his feet when he answered. „Father wasn’t very pleased that I defied becoming a Death Eater by leaving no space for the Dark Mark on my arms. I told him I wasn’t going to bow my head for anyone. I have my pride in being a Malfoy and Malfoys don’t kiss the shoes of anyone especially not of lunatics.“
“So, what’s your excuse of tasting like Malfoy?” Ron asked.
“Why, thank you, Greg, I hadn’t noticed” Draco would’ve rolled his eyes if his head wasn’t killing him so much. Greg inclined his head as if to say ‘You’re welcome’.
"Gentlemen," he said in a seductive tone and fluttered his eyelashes, "you flatter me very much. But I am only a poor potter who wants to sell his wares."
“Thank you, Ron. That was very brave of you to say. I’m going next, alright?” Without waiting for anyone answering, Hermione began her presentation.
Harry took the air in shock as King Lucius began to laugh with joy.
“So, Harry, don’t you think I’ve forgotten your earlier reaction. What’s up with that?” Hermione turned to Harry, looking him up and down speculatively.
I shook my head lightly, effectively ending my reverie. I turned to my friends. “Come on, we have potions now. We should go, if we don’t want to be late.”
“Should
Draco blinked and found himself scooped up in Potter’s arms.
“Bill, no work on Sundays!” admonished the blond woman next to him. Draco had the feeling to have seen her before. “Bonjour Draco, I am Fleur, Bills wife.” Ah, the triwizard tournament.
Potter just shrugged and said “Anything for the fairy princess.”
Luna looked at the spot Draco pointed to and shook her head. "Better not go there. It's very dangerous because so many people walk there. Riders also pass by there. You'd better stay here with me."
Harry seemed slightly disappointed. “Well, you can’t have all my firsts.” Draco teased and they entered the cinema.
Harry laughed. “Should I carry you then, princess?” Without waiting for an answer, Harry scooped Draco up into his arms. Draco squealed and flailed with his arms. “Let me down!”
The prince, however, staggered, swayed, almost fell and rose again with the laughter of the people. Then he became angry. 'How dare this impertinent fellow humiliate me like this? I'll show you!'
He dragged himself into the bathroom and threw up. Suddenly an image of the party flared up in his mind. He had drunk too much, and his memories were fuzzy. Just like last year. He was snogging with Harry in a corner of the room, when Blaise interrupted them, talking shit about making another bet (
Yeah, I figured that much. I really didn’t look forward to it. Draco could be more frightening than Molly Weasly. But even angry Draco was the sweetest thing living.
The beggar took some clay and began to shape it. Draco watched with fascination the skillful hands of the man. With the beggar's instructions, Draco soon began to form plates and cups himself.
Harry grinned impishly and gave Draco a little kiss on the tip of his nose. Then he stood up and said, "I'll show you how to make pottery now."
Then a rough voice rang out from the courtyard and came up to him. "I thank you, Prince, but throw down the second slipper so that I can sell the pair at the market!"
Draco woke up, feeling warm and protected. Coming to his senses slowly, he registered, that he was sprawled all over Harry. Well, so much for minding the others personal space. He watched Harrys peaceful sleeping face for a while, thinking of the absurdity of their situation. Carefully not to wake Harry up, Draco finally climbed out of bed and took a shower.
Draco wasn’t the person to use many words of affection. That made those moments so much more precious. He rather showed his love in the way he kissed me or looked at me while his luscious lips were wrapped around my.. “Oh dear. Then he’s going to kill you.” Narcissa broke me from my reverie.
“Anything” Potter nodded and grinned.
In a solemn voice, Lucius announced, “Henceforth, you shall be husband and spouse. Go with him, son. From now on you shall share bed and table with him."
As much as Ron admired the courage of his king and friend, he thought he was being too stubborn. Could love make Harry really that blind?
In front of the hut he found flowers. He stuck them on his dress and a few more in his hair. Draco still had so much dignity after all that he wanted to look good even in misery.
“Are you the Sugar Plum Fairy? I could be your nutcracker” Seamus winked at him suggestively.
“So are you both ok with me fancying Malfoy?” Harry asked.
„I want to be on your side, Harry“, Draco whispered and Harry embraced him tightly.
“I’ll make breakfast, if you can wait a few minutes?” the Gryffindor asked as he got out of the bed and discarded his sleeping shirt.
Dracos smile widened. “So, care to join me on going on the most thrilling adventure? I have to go apologize to a very good friend of mine for not marrying them. And this friend just happens to be very skilled at hexing the hell out of people who’ve angered her. I’m in dire need of a human shield and you seem just the right person for the job.”
Ron and Neville cheered. “Finally”, Neville cried. “Way to go, mate”, Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder.
Harry took the offered hand in his own as if it would explode any moment. McGonagall then swished her wand other their loosely joined hands.
When the beggar took Draco away, Lucius had not sent anyone after him to find out where his son was taken. And now he couldn't find Draco and couldn't bring him back either.
"Draco, dear, do you know what treacle tart is?", Molly asked her new apprentice.
Lucius was outright furious. Not only had his son humiliated some fine noble men with excellent marriage prospects, but Draco also gave up his chance of becoming the spouse of the most influential men alive. And all the riches Gryffindors king housed! That was it. The prince needed to be taught a lesson.
A sudden thought clouded Potters face. “Wait, I remember Blaise saying something about pureblood customs and no sex before marriage. You were a virgin until last night, right?”
I barely registered all the people ‘cause I was searching for the only person that mattered to me. My green eyes locked with grey ones and I began to run.
Now the snake looked at him in confusion. „
Harry looked at him thoughtfully and demanded, "Then kiss me!"
Harry leaned back, rubbing his eyes. He suddenly felt very tired. “Even if – and that’s a big if – I would want to get together with Malfoy, I can’t. He’s with Parkinson.”
The End.
Draco twirled in his pale pink dress in front of the mirror critically. His short blond hair was perfectly styled, his nails polished a soft pink matching the dress and his eye make up in various shades of grey, making his eyes look big and silver. The dress fluffed around his legs, caressing his pale skin.
“And you couldn’t just talk to me like a normal person? You know, we’re forced to hold hands right now, yes?”
"But I am not Thrushbeard, I am your husband!" Harry replied.
“Well, yes, we were to get married after all. She is one of my best friends.” Draco said cautiously. Harry sounded very agitated.
The King of Gryffindor was never happier than at this moment. This was also shown by the radiant smile he wore on his face.
Harry looked Draco deep into his eyes and nodded. "With all my heart."
“Astoria, I’m really so–“
“Enchantée.” Draco greeted.
“If you want it, then go take it.” I growled.
Harry choked on his pumpkin juice. „I…I don’t like Malfoy! Just look at him! There definitely IS something different“, the Boy-Who-Lived-Just-To-Choke-To-Death blushed fiercely.
‘And embarrass myself before the common people?’ Draco's face turned all pink. "I will never!"
Draco began to panic. His father had barely spoken to him in weeks and was still upset with him. As it was now, Draco couldn’t be sure whether Lucius would keep his threat or not. "Be quiet, my father can hear you. I'll give you a gold piece”, the prince pleaded with the beggar.
“, the snake slid over Dracos shoulder to his back.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world” Harry said solemnly and took the seat right next to Draco.
“You don’t even plan to get married anytime soon! Or do you have a special someone right now?” Granger demanded to know.
She knew that Draco wasn’t fond of going anywhere but the kitchen. But there were too many guests, too much food and not enough staff in the castle. And when Molly asked Draco for something, he could not refuse the warm-hearted woman anything.
“That’s because you’re never sitting next to Harry. It’s like sixth year all over again.”
“I’m not cute!” said Harry indignantly. Ops, had he said that out loud? “I’m a burly Auror, I’ll have you know. There’s nothing cute about that.”
Ron shook his head. “Nah, let them figure it out, themselves” he grinned when Harry interlaced his fingers with Dracos.
Harry wasn’t able to answer. Fixed on the tattoos he impulsively streched out his hand but froze in his movement when he heard an angry hiss, „
Draco peeked through his eye lashes. Harry cupped his jaw and lifted his face. “You know, when I was injured during the mission I saw your smiling face in my mind and the only thought I had was ‘Please, let me see Draco again’. Soulmate bond or not, I love you, Draco.”
In fact, the glittering blond hair of the prince stood out among exotic flower arrangements. He seemed to be a little overwhelmed by the flower girl's flow of speech, but kept his temper in check. Harry was very proud that his husband did not resort to insults. However, the prince's beautiful face seemed to be distorted in a sneer as he walked with his cart to the gate and set up his stall.
The next days passed by in a flash. The beggar went into town during the day to sell the pottery – aka to take care of the affairs in the castle – while Draco made pottery and painted the finished dishes with different patterns. Harry especially liked the set with the Gryffindor crest, that he immediately brought to the castle as a national treasure.
“For being the human shield that stood between you and getting your face polished by Hermione.” Potter’s boyish smile that made his heart flutter was the only reason why Draco accepted that stupid reason and didn’t remind the Gryffindor of promising to be a gentleman for the entire night. It was basically Potter’s duty to protect Draco.
Hermione then squeezed Ron’s shoulder gently and said, “Why don’t do you start, love?”
“Are you always that affectionate with your friends?”
Of course! Harry had searched everywhere but his own castle.
Ginny had won Dracos heart when she chose him as seeker instead of Harry in the friendly Quidditch match between the Weasley siblings, because “You’ve got talent Harry, but let’s be real here, Draco’s got more skill”. Not to mention, that the match was anything but friendly, it was more like a warzone. It was great!
“Right” Ron shook his head and turned to Neville. “Why was Blaise’s stag night already last week?”
Damn, I wanted to kiss the sneer away. I sighed and rolled my eyes dramatically, because Malfoy insists we pretend to still be enemies. “Of course, your majesty, let me be you’re humble servant.” I said, my tone mocking.
Blaise nodded and smiled goofily. Draco had never seen his friend that happy. “Neville is the love of my life. I don’t know how I deserve him.”
The ministry worker looked slightly overwhelmed as he let his gaze drift over the crowd before him. His eyes widened comically when they fell at Potter. “Ha-Harry Potter! It’s such an honor, to meet you!” He exclaimed.
The Prince's dumbfounded moaning harmonized surprisingly well with the sounds of the guitar.
"I doubt very much if the ferret can improve. He's not worth all the trouble," murmured Ron.
Potter took Dracos hand. “I’m not. I’ve always had a certain interest in you. Though it wasn’t always positive, I’ll admit. I never saw you in that way, until last night. You had a striking presence, as always, but it was different from school.”
“Of course, love. I want to spent my whole life with you. We can marry right now, if you want.”
Jealousy rose in Harry and made his body shake with rage. Only Rons hand on his shoulder held Harry back from angrily stomping to the stall and beating the men up.
Entering the Great Hall, Harry made to go to the Gryffindor table on his right. He didn’t get far though, because the hand he was holding tugged him to the left.
“You heard, what he said in there. He wants to break the bond! He’s yearning to finally get rid of me.” He took a shuddering breath. “I–I should go, pack my things. Thank Molly for everything in my stead, will you? I don’t think, I can take to say goodbye personally.”
“You talk to him about me?” Draco asked surprised.
Ginnys humor was also really dark which Draco appreciated immensely. She was the only one who he could share his most hilarious and bizarre hospital cases with. I mean, yes, the poor patients, but how could one not laugh about a man who hopped around pooping eggs and thinking he was the easter bunny?
All I know is, that I couldn’t care less, why it felt like so much more, because Draco began to move, making pretty noises. I helped, guiding hips up and down. Dracos stamina wasn’t the best, but before he could get too exhausted to move I flipped him over and thrust deliberate slowly into him, trying to convey to him how much I cherished him.
They had walked for a while in companiable silence when Harry asked shyly “Is this okay?” and nodded to their joined hands.
“Stop apologizing, you idiot!” Draco wiped his tears away. “I’m still very angry at you, and me, and our friends for not preventing it, but we can’t go back, we can only face forward now. By the way, I’m famished, so stuff your guilty feelings and make me breakfast!”
“Silence!”, King Lucius barked. “You have two suitors left. Draco, you will choose one of them. THAT is my final word!”
“Do not worry, Mr. Malfoy. You can use the bathroom facilities privately. But you will be pulled back together after seven minutes, so you should not take too long.” McGonagall smiled in a way, that wasn’t reassuring at all.
"Send only the guards and dogs and servants. I have the King's word and meanwhile, play a song”, the beggar mocked and actually began to sing a vulgar song crookedly.
“Yeah, it was more like the other way around.” Harry stopped in his tracks, when the thought hit him. “Merlin, I really did drag you into this whole mess forcefully. God, Draco. I’m so sorry! I made you marry me out of a whim, because I wanted to mess with you a little. Now I’ve ruined your life! You could have married Astoria and have children of your own. And then I ripped all those possibilities apart, because I wanted to have a little fun. What if your parents would’ve outcasted you because of me? And now I pushed you into living with me and giving this relationship a chance. God, you must hate me!”
“I’m sorry. I’m just getting my things, then you won’t have to see me again.” Draco said, eyeing the carpet. He wasn’t ready to see the cold expression his father would give him.
Harry wasn’t sure, if he should clarify that it was him, who noticed all those things about Malfoy and Ron only knew, because Harry rambled non-stop about it.
“No, no. I’m sorry! Please stay!” Harry wheezed and forced Draco to sit down again – Draco didn’t know, how he managed that, he was injured after all. “I’m not laughing at you, I swear. It’s just, it makes so much sense now. You not being home yesterday, Ginny incoherently yelling at me.” Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. “I don’t want to dump you, I want to be with you.”
Luna called out after him, which sounded like "Watch out for the nargles," whatever that meant. But Draco was already on the way to his place next to the gate.
“It is the warrior's armour that you hear”, Lockhart replied proudly.
“I would like that very much, mother.” Draco soothed his mother, astonished about her outburst. Normally, Narcissa wasn’t one for showing much emotion.
His husband seemed to be well-built. He would make a good worker, so that he could certainly make ends meet for both of them.
"Harry, where were you? What happened? Why do you look so shabby? I was seriously worried. You were gone for days!", Ron exclaimed.
“It’s great. It’s a job that demands a lot from me and it’s exhausting. But there are many interesting and funny things to see. I’m just so grateful, that I’m finally doing something good, that I can atone a little…How you like being an Auror? Didn’t get enough of chasing bad guys, did you?” Draco smirked, which Harry answered with a smirk of his own.
In the hallway though, Potter began to struggle. “Wait, Malfoy, you’re misunderstanding something!”
“I know. I’m not sorry though, you’re really sexy when you’re mad at me.” I growled back, relishing in the blush that tainted Dracos cheek red.
Malfoy blushed prettily. “Of course I speak, you oaf. Just not to idiots like you, Potter.” He sniffed haughtily.
To Harrys joy he often was paired to work with Malfoy in classes giving the dark haired boy opportunities to casually touch the blonde. Their hands, elbows and knees would brush accidentally when one of them reached for an ingredient, leaned closer to read in a shared textbook or repot a large plant. When they touched, Harry could occasionally hear a muffled hiss coming from Dracos left side. The hisses gave Harry one more reason for longing to see what was under the Slytherins robes.
‘What?’, Draco took a step back in shock. The black-haired man was not here for him. ‘He is only interested in politics. He's just like everybody else.’ Draco thought bitterly.
“Can I meet him, soon?” Draco had heard of his estranged aunt and that his cousin Nymphadora had died during the war, leaving a baby boy behind. He was always curious about this side of his family but hadn’t had the courage to contact them.
Instead of answering Draco drew me into a filthy kiss and rolled his hips against mine. Moaning I grabbed Dracos perfect arse and squeezed. I instantly grew hard.
But Draco found just as quick a snide remark to reject the tall duke. “Long and thin has little in,” the Prince sneered.
“Hello Lovegood”, Draco greeted.
“No, he’s not. They are just really good friends since childhood.” Luna said with wide honest eyes.
The beggar stretched and yawned. He went to the bed in the corner of the room and said to Draco, "Come to bed now.”
“Of course, you are” Draco drawled seductively and gestured inside. “Please, do come in– wait, Potter?” Draco’s eyes nearly fell out, they went so big.
Potter looked into Dracos eyes and Draco searched for any kind of insincerity. All Draco could see was honesty and hope, it made hope bloom in Dracos heart as well. Potter just wanted a soulmate, somebody to be there. But maybe someday, Potter could come to love Draco for who he was.
“What’s the harm? We can easily get a divorce.”
When only Harry and Malfoy were left in the Hall, McGonagall approached them to lift the charm.
Affronted, I looked up at Ron and was about to complain, when the redhead sighed heavily. “I know, I know, mate. I’m blocking the view. Soooooo sorry.”
They walked down the aisle arm in arm and wasn’t that just surreal? Weasley wolf-whistled then and Draco gave him the finger which gained some scandalous gasps from the audience.
The guests were equally bewildered. Had the king married a mere servant?
Draco shrugged and said “I’ll show you, I will sell everything we made!” And with a cheeky grin for farewell Draco made his way to town. Harry however took a shortcut to the castle and put on the Gryffindor knights uniform. Disguised as such he took his horse and rode to the towns market.
The chef and mother of the knights squad supreme captain Molly Weasly only needed a quick glance at the blond youth to give him a comforting hug. In her opinion, the young man was much too slim and looked so forlorn that it broke her heart.
“I don't want to get married! I. REFUSE. TO. GET. MARRIED!“
Draco knew that it would probably be better to accept the girl's help. After all, he didn't know his way around the market. The flowers were fine too, but right next to the fish stall, their lovely scent was disturbed. Draco was very proud of his pottery. The jugs were very beautiful and would sell well even if people had little sense of aesthetics.
Hermione realised that Harry was not to be dissuaded from his plan. As the two men went into the office to attend to the royal duties, she said quietly, "I very much hope nobody will be hurt.” Then she went after her friends.
Granger didn’t take his honest, heroic act well, though. She charged at him with a grim, determined expression that promised war. Draco was momentarily stunned, remembering Granger’s right hook, that broke his nose in third year and he knew that Granger would fight him for the bouquet the muggle way.
In the evening, when the beggar returned to the hut, a good meal and a smiling prince awaited him.
Since the bathroom incident, whenever Malfoy crossed their way, he made kissing faces at Ron. Unfailingly, Ron would turn red up to his ears embarrassed. Harry, too, turned red, but for a different reason. He was jealous, that Ron got so much of Malfoys attention and Harry got none. Not even a sneer or a loathsome look. It drove Harry mad.
“You will love this!” Harry promised and ordered for them both.
Draco snorted and took Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “Obviously.”
Grey eyes flashed in anger and Malfoy fought back. Somehow, they made it out into the hallway, where the situation escalated into a full on brawl.
“Now you’re a girl, too, Weasel. Have fun being infected by my repugnance”. He turned swiftly around and stalked out of the bathroom.
"Too late. You've already given him to me as husband." Harry showed the wooden rings he and Draco wore on their fingers.
Even after classes he was dragged into the library again. Extremely bored Harry turned page after page of his Quidditch magazine while Malfoy diligently did his homework. Harry hadn’t read a word of his magazine, focusing instead on Malfoys body warmth and the soft pressure on his hand.
Malfoy was such a drama queen, painfully demanding, always fighting with me, a right prat. He could kill my nerves. But what had me dying a little bit every time I was near him was that killer body. I mean, just look at that swaying hips!
The party had ended with everybody being drunk. Draco had the feeling to have some important memory missing but ignored it for the time being. They had to pick up Teddy, who was going to live with Harry and Draco. Draco finally had the little family, Harry had promised him.
The prince turned around, dug his head under the pillow and grumbled, "Quiet, who's screaming? I want to sleep! Guards, servants, maids, chase that screamer away!"
“I’m getting there, mate. What else do you feel? What did you feel, when you held Malfoys hand?” Ron asked gently. He could just tell Harry, what he thought, Harry was feeling. But Hermione taught him, that it was better if people came to the realization themselves.
But the king did not let go. "Look at me!" He urged.
“Nothing!” Harry held his hands up in surrender. “I just like to see you eating so enthusiastically. It’s making me happy, if you enjoy my cooking. Can you cook?”
“If you’re not already sharing a living space, I would advise in moving in together. Well, then” the employee stood up, to shake their hands and show them out. “Here is your marriage certificate. I wish you all the best, Mr. and Mr. Potter.”
Chuckling Harry set on making breakfast. “Anything interesting in the news?”
Today though, Draco kept his distance from the punch, he was the host after all. He was in charge of organizing Blaise’ stag night and therefore had a duty to see everything was going according to plan. And though Draco was slightly tipsy, he took his responsibility as Blaise’s bridesmaid very seriously.
“Ok, then let’s go. Apparate me?” Harry held out his arm.
“See something funny, Potter?” the Slytherin sneered. Draco was minding his own business, ignoring Potter successfully for two full days, slowly being able to forget the feeling of Potters hand in his and then the idiot had to push him right in front of the DADA teacher.
“Arithmancy” Malfoy answered shortly and took the lead by walking determinedly in long strides, dragging Harry with him. Thankfully, they didn’t encounter many students on their way.
Harry had trouble sitting still in his seat. He just found out, he was in love, dammit. And he currently held hands with the object of his desires. He wanted to squeeze Malfoys hand so badly, to rub circles on the back of that hand, to let his own hand travel up Malfoys arm, let his hand explore. Harrys agitation grew and when he was sure he would explode Malfoy said “Potter, would you stop that, already?”
Draco moaned in disappointment as he registered reality. Right, he was now married to a beggar and had spent one night in a very shabby hut. There were no servants and he now had to use his delicate hands for work himself.
“If you don't turn the music down, we'll have to break up your party” Potter said.
“Harry, please. Stop! It’s okay!” Draco tried frantically to calm Harry down. Should he touch him? He flailed his arms helplessly, not knowing what to do.
Then he began again, voice very serious. “I cannot stand idly by while you make the biggest mistake a man can make. Ignoring being gay. I know, I know. How would I, Neville Longbottom, know anything about that? Is Neville gay, too? To tell you the truth, no, I’m not gay. I’m a raging heterosexual. But I spent half my life rooming with Seamus and he explained homosexuality to me in detail. So, I know a gay man when I see one. And Harry, you are without a doubt gay.”
Harry turned around abruptly and stood directly in front of Draco in just a few quick, long steps. “Is this how you want to marry me?”
Despite it being still midday, Draco whispered “Good night, Harry.”
“You’re flouncing your leg and it’s bloody annoying. I can’t concentrate, when you do that.” Malfoy looked pointedly on Harrys lap. Harry followed his gaze and truly, his leg bounced with increasing speed.
Seamus slouched into his chair and pouted, “No explosives until after the wedding.”
“Then what are you all waiting for?” Draco asked sharply and everybody scrambled to their feet. In passing Draco could hear Potter mumbling to Weasley “Bossy Draco is kind of hot. Look, Ron, I got goosebumps!”
I only sighed. I knew better than to argue right now. We had this conversation daily since my hook up with Malfoy. My friends could never understand that I had already fallen too hard and that it was impossible for me to stay away from Malfoy.
And suddenly... Suddenly the prince danced beautifully. He spun around gracefully, arched his back and stretched his long legs. And all around, people fell silent and amazed. Then the coins fell into the hat and people applauded. Draco was so pleased with himself that he did not even notice the beggar's amorous look.
Draco was jolted out of his thoughts when there was a loud knock at the door. Draco only heard it over the blaring music because he was pressed against the door, though. He swung the door open. Two men in red robes stood before him. Draco let his eyes roam appreciatively over the uniform clad bodies. He had waited all day for this moment. This was going to be the highlight of the party.
“Then the mother must have been a thrush. Because only the thrush has such a chin. So… you are the King Thrushbeard! Get a birdcage here!”, Draco laughed out loud though he wasn’t feeling like laughing.
The two men before him wanted only his beauty anyway, and not him as a person. If he went with them, he would be just a beautiful bird in a cage like in his father's palace.
Lockhart, trying to do a somersault, fell to the ground with his arms and legs strangely twisted.
“The last months got me thinking, how did it come to war? The conclusion I came to was, that there wasn’t enough love. Without love, little children grow up to become evil. Without love, people hate each other. So I thought, why not spread more love, so something horrible like the battle cannot happen again? The clubs theme therefore is ‘make love, not war’.”
The two were strolling a few feet behind Harry and Draco who were bickering happily with each other. This morning Harry took Dracos hand naturally without being punished to do so by one of the teachers. Neither boy had noticed the difference in their handholding.
Harold refused a political marriage. He was a romantic and believed he could find true love. And hell, he deserved true love after fighting a war and becoming ruler with only age seventeen.
“A simple promise isn’t going to cut it this time, Harry. I need more than that to trust you on this.” Dracos eyes were hard as steel. I knew, he meant it.
“From my mother I will have inherited it”, Harry frowned.
Harry sat down with Draco and searched for the right words. But just as he was about to start his speech, Draco interrupted him. "Have you come to humiliate me further? Is what you have done to me not enough? Do you hate me so much?"
“Uhm, ok.” Harry turned to Draco. Gathering his thoughts, he cast a muffliato. He was going to confess his feelings, so it should be a private moment. He took a deep breath. “You’re acting like a whore, always moaning for attention but giving me the cold shoulder. I feel betrayed, that you’re wagging your tail at everybody and you give a shit about me.”
“I don’t want to calm down. I don’t want what’s best for me. And I don’t don’t DON’T want to get married!“ The prince screeched now in such a high pitch that Lucius feared even the white peacocks in the yard were thrown into a dither. Those poor creatures were most sensible, you have to know.
Panicked, the prince pulled himself together and hurried after the beggar. "No, no. I will come. Just don't run so fast."
How could Draco face his husband now? Potter and his beautiful, stunning green eyes and his rough beard and his gruff voice singing silly, happy songs.
Ron nodded and folded his parchment. “Harry”, he began to read, eyes glued to the paper.
Five minutes later, Hermione entered the bathroom, looking slightly sick herself. Ron and Harry followed closely behind.
“Draco, wait! Where are you going?” Ginny called after him and grabbed him by the arm.
Harry sighed the password sadly and climbed into the Gryffindor common room. He wanted nothing more than to take a hot shower and curl up under a bunch of blankets to sleep, but he pulled himself together to say a quick hello to his friends. Hermione was rather adamant about Harry telling her where he went and that he came back safely.
"But then you thought I was a beggar." Ron held up the beggar's disguise for everyone to see.
"Harry, I know you care for him and I admire you for helping him to change. But it cannot be ruled out that his character will be spoilt forever. What if he does not change? You took responsibility for him when you married him and you can't just throw him away when he doesn't change as you want him to." Hermione was very worried.
“Oh yeah? That idiots potion would have exploded, anyway. He doesn’t need my help for that.” Malfoy sneered. Well, as much as one could sneer with a half-broken jaw.
Her smile faded, however, when she saw her friends looking determinedly at her and gathered under a banner. The poster read "Intervention".
Potter had been pretending to Draco all along. Was Draco just a plaything of the king's whims? Did Potter want to mock him all the time and the humiliation in front of all the nobles was the climax of the game? Was this revenge for Draco's spurning Potter's hand?
Frightened, Draco backed away. What was the man saying? "I'm the spouse of a beggar. Let me go."
Those were the thoughts running in my head as I walked through the Forbidden Forest towards my inevitable doom.
“What are you doing?” Harry laughed. “Nobody eats pizza with cutlery.”
„If I wasn't non-violent since yesterday, I'd punch you in the face right now.“ Malfoy grumbled and finally turned to face them. Though he only had eyes for Ron and was totally ignoring Harry. Harry felt an unpleasant twist in his stomach.
The Slytherin king cried out in rage throughout the kingdom. "My wayward son has driven all suitors away with scorn and derision. He did not want the best of men. Now he will have to take the first beggar that appears before the castle. That is my royal word. So mote it be."
It was apparently Ginny’s turn, now. She squinted at her parchment and nodded before mindlessly scrunching the paper up and tossing it aside. “Harry, you’re an oblivious idiot. Just go and snog Malfoy, already. I know you want to and honestly, it would be hot as fuck. I ship it!”
Grudgingly, Harry followed. Malfoy did the same, but shoved Harry brutally aside when he passed him. Stumbling, Harry mumbled a tripping jinx. Malfoy barely held himself upright. And in the next second, both were shoving and pushing each other rather heatedly.
Before Hermione could answer though, the Slytherin came out of the room. Immediately, Harry felt a pull on his hand, pulling him towards the blonde. Heaving a sigh, Malfoy held out his hand which Harry took gently.
But Draco had spurned the king. He didn't want him, thank you very much. No riches in the world he wanted, he just wanted his beggar –Potter– back. But he couldn’t have this Potter either. Stupid Potter with his stupid hut and his stupid songs and his stupid smile.
If only he knew, how true those words really were. I would do anything for him.
This was the perfect opportunity to answer with something smart and witty that would express Harry’s feelings while making him look cool simultaneously. But neither his brain nor his mouth seemed to be working. He was frozen in place. Where was his inner Gryffindor when he needed it?
Draco spluttered, "Never! I'd rather sleep on the naked floor!"
“And if a little rain comes, you rust”, Draco expressed his concern.
Last year Harold got a glimpse of Draco. He was visiting the enemy country to renew the peace treaty and saw the Slytherin prince flantering in the gardens and feeding the peacocks. In the bright sun the prince looked like an angel with his gold-silver hair, his fair skin and slim body. Harolds heart began to beat furiously and he felt his face flushing. He never felt like this before. This must have been love at first sight.
When he himself exited he stumbled into a firm chest. Looking up he met emerald green eyes and stepped back hastily.
“Are your own parents not good enough for you anymore, now that you married the wizarding worlds darling hero? Are we that much beneath you, that you can’t look us in the eyes?” Lucius asked sharply. That made Draco look up. His father didn’t look angry, rather sad.
“Oh”, Draco’s voice was nothing more than a soft sigh.
"This is part of my disguise as a beggar, to sneak into Slytherin. I was there until yesterday, if you must know."
marry or should YOU marry?”, Draco screamed very high pitched back.
“Harry!” he yelled. Concerned, the black-haired man came into the bathroom. “Are you sick again?”
Hermione made a “tch”-sound. “Why won’t you ask him out like a mature person? You’re not a kindergartener!”
Potter stiffened and Draco absentmindedly kneaded his shoulders back into a more relaxed state. “No, I don’t have one. But that doesn’t mean I have no right to catch the flowers. That’s discrimination against single, gay people!”
Harry gave Draco an appraising look and smirked. “You are not half as beautiful as you are said to be.”
“No, I’m still used to house elves” Draco admitted sheepishly. “I wanted to learn, but there wasn’t much time during Healer training.”
I watched trough my eye-slids as a fuming blonde strode in my direction. Damn, an angry Draco was hot as fuck. I mean, he was angry a lot. But right now was a whole new level. Draco was livid, he was furious. I stifled a moan. Now was not a good moment to get a stiffy.
"You are in a beggar's house and this screamer is your dear husband," the beggar laughed happily. "Get up, the day has come, we have much to do," he said and sang on.
"What, did you marry Ginny in secret?" Ron asked, stunned.
“The man in your bed? Draco, you don’t know, who that is?” Theo sounded like he was on the brink of laughing. This was a very serious situation, dammit!
“That’s what I’ve said, do keep up.” Pansy met Draco’s eyes and startled. Looking guilty, she made to run away. “Pansy, you cow, stay where you are!” Draco screamed and stormed after her.
Draco gaped at his father. Then stared at the beggar. Then looked back at his father. Both men wore perfectly serious and content expressions.
While Neville poured him a cup of tea, Harry began to voice his problem. “Last week I had a case of nightly disturbance and where did I end up?” Neville’s eyes widened slightly and he had the decency to look sheepish. Harrys eyes flashed dangerously. “Exactly. At your fiancés stag night, organized by none other than Draco Malfoy who – apparently – is bridesmaid! I am your best man! Why haven’t you told me that Malfoy is bridesmaid?”
Oh, my sweet Draco… He was going to be so mad.
The Slytherin prince gasped. “How dare you speak to me like that?”
"Give me another chance. I don't want to be so useless. Teach me something!" asked Draco urgently.
And hidden under his robes he had a tattoo running down the left side of his torso. It said
Neville nodded solemnly. “Really. He lost a bet to Blaise.” Everyone but Harry cried out in delight.
Harry immediately forgot his anger. “Uhm, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He scratched his head and looked around airily. Best to play innocent.
The next two hours did not go better. The pottery stall with the beautiful prince attracted a certain kind of clientele: rich men looking for some fun with the handsome potter.
But he wasn’t the only one with a make-over over the summer. Harry himself has become taller and broader. He wasn’t the scrawny little teenage boy anymore. His hair was as unruly as ever but he wore it shorter with side cuts. The old round glasses were replaced by new hipster glasses.
“No way” Ron spluttered, “Blimey” Seamus spluttered, “Really?” Dean asked.
The party was great. There was games, dancing and conversation. Blaise even held a speech, talking about how he lost a bet to Harry and how Harry claimed his winnings by ringing Blaises doorbell at night, demanding to know every little detail about Dracos crush on Harry in school.
“Never! I caught it! It’s rightfully mine.” Draco peeked experimentally over Potter’s shoulder. He had to admit, the Gryffindor was very useful. Such broad and muscular shoulders…
As soon as the blond prince had set up his stall, the first interested people arrived. Two handsome young men in rich clothing approached the booth. However, they seemed to be more interested in Draco than in the pots. Despite shabby beggar clothes, the beauty of the prince was undisputed and attracted the attention of the people passing by.
“That”, Draco gestured to Harry in general. “All that kissing and touching and being nice to me. Don’t do that, when you’re going to dump me.”
“All your limbs are clattering. And it squeaks that you cannot hear your own word”, Draco shouted over the noise.
Lockhart approached, while his armour clanked eerily with every step.
“Please sit down again, Harry.” Hermione asked, staring at him sternly until Harry complied.
Draco didn’t believe him. “You said, you were tired of our forced relationship. You were tired of being with me.”
“Draco, I don’t think it’s like that. Harry wants you!”
When McGonagall handed the wands back to their owners, she explained, “You have to hold hands for the rest of the day. Your wands only work, when you’re touching each other. That’s not an invitation to harm each other. Everything that hurts the other, you experience too. Spending some time together in forced proximity will hopefully teach you to behave appropriately for your age.”
He had no hope of his feelings being reciprocated and couldn’t risk anyone ever finding out about them. So, Draco had decided to shove his feelings deep deep down, were they belonged. He wanted to forget about the Boy Who Lived. And it wasn’t even that hard, to Dracos dismay. He didn’t sought Potters attention anymore and therefore had no interaction whatsoever with him. It hurt to realize, that Draco meant nothing to Potter, that he only got into contact with Potter when Draco initiated it.
“His full name is Edward and he is four years old now. Right now, he really likes dragons, because we visited Charlie in Romania this summer. So, don’t worry, he already loves you, because I told him your name means ‘dragon’.” Harry reassured Draco, his hand never leaving the small of Dracos back as they walked from the apparition point towards Andromedas house.
“Yeah, I figured we should do it properly if we’re giving our relationship a chance. I know, we got the order all wrong from the start, but Draco Malfoy, will you go out with me?” Harry gave a winning smile and conjured a white lily, which he offered to Draco.
He was just shuffling to the corner he, Ron and Hermione usually occupied when he realized something was wrong. For one thing, Luna and Ginny were also in their regular spot, but that was not an unusual sight. What was unusual, however, was that his friends instantly fell silent when they saw him coming. They stood up and turned to face Harry. They all looked very serious and held each a piece of parchment in hand. Now Harry began to worry. He frowned and asked suspiciously, “What is going on?“
„Come off it, Malfoy. How about neutral territory? Hufflepuff table?” Harry asked, internally preening that Malfoy finally spoke normally to him.
“You can redecorate and add your personal things anywhere you like, I don’t mind” said Harry after the tour. “Maybe you should go to the manor to grab the things you need. And then we can go sleep the jetlag off. Should I–I mean, do you want me to come with you to get your stuff?”
"Where am I to go now?" he whispered desperately.
“That is a great pity. You know, I really wanted to make Hogwarts a better place, where there is no violence, no bullying. You see, I was bullied very often. And I’m all alone. I really hoped, I could make friends with both of you and make a difference in our final year at Hogwarts.” Luna looked at them with wide, sad eyes.
But his interest in Malfoy wasn’t his fault this time, either. Just look at the guy! At the trials he looked like death himself. And now he was back at Hogwarts, practically glowing with his shiny golden locks and his smooth pale skin and cute pink cheeks and round bum and Harry really should stop thinking about Malfoy before his lower body betrayed him again.
That was suspicious. So of course, Ginny and he were eavesdropping on their conversation.
Harry said as much to her when she sat down. Ginny waved him away impatiently and stood right up again, adding “Oh! In case you’re worried about our previous relationship, I just say: no worries, I like being your little sister. So, man up and go get him, bro!” She grinned and gave him a thumbs up. Harry groaned and facepalmed.
Draco sneered, but it was only half-hearted. The blush, that was rising to his ears was giving away, how happy the blonde really was, though. “No, I don’t want to remember our wedding day as the day Voldemort hugged me. And today you’re standing in the spotlight, boy wonder. I want a real wedding, where I’m the center of attention.”
“Well done, Draco dear. I’ve been telling Harry for ages to get rid of all those old t-shirts.” She said to Draco. “How do you like the food?”
"Potter" Draco only breathed the name out. "The Beggar."
“Come on, Draco. You survived your parents and your ex-fiancè. The Weasleys won’t hurt you!” Harry said annoyed. They were just a few feet away from the floo network, but Draco wouldn’t budge one inch away from where he stood.
The End.
The Gryffindor king swallowed his broken emotions down. And said in an icy voice, only his eyes betraying his pain, “I thought you wanted a human. But I forgot, you're looking for a pretty chin. I do not have one. But I love you, handsome prince. Why? That you must ask the thrush, she knows more about love than you do.”
Harry interrupted him and asked incredulously “Wait, you’ve just been carrying that around?”
“Nonsense. I have to admit, I would never have dreamed of seeing the wizarding worlds saviour strip for a living, especially with your atrocious dancing skills – I just say Yule Ball! But if anyone can pull it off, it’s you. You never seize to surprise me, Potter.” Draco dragged the black-haired man further down the hall.
“If you think I would sit with a bunch of brutes, you are sorely mistaken, Potter”, Malfoy hissed and turned towards the Slytherin table.
On Saturday evening Harry said “Tomorrow we’ll spend the day at the Burrow.”
“Absolutely spiffing.” Draco was stiff as a board.
He laughed and said “That was a nice jump. Hahaha.“
Back in London, Draco shooed them all into the ministry. Theo complained that all of them had to go, but he quickly shut up after Draco shot him a death glare venomously said, they had to come out of principle.
After weeks in the hut, Draco was no longer so condescending and stuck-up. He seemed to appreciate hard work and to overlook the outward appearance of things. He had learned that inner values count. Harry now wanted to test whether this change could stand up to ordinary people outside the small hut.
As he looked around, he noticed that all the suitors he had ridiculed and mocked were present. They had all come to congratulate the Gryffindor King. 'Oh, dear,' thought Draco to himself, 'I hope no one recognizes me.' Shame made him blush. If the former suitors saw that he was now a shabby servant and no longer a prince, they would surely mock him.
“Thank you, Hermione” Luna clapped enthusiastically. “Now, let’s practice. Harry, how about you start with Draco? Say something provocative at first and then rephrase it in non-violent terms. Remember to express your feelings and formulate your needs at the end.”
The rest of dinnertime passed silently until Luna got up and excused herself, “I’m going to look for nargles, now”, and floated away.
He began to shake and tears were running down his cheeks. Exhausted from his rant his legs gave up. I scooped him up and held him close. “You broke my heart today, Harry. Don’t you ever play the hero again.”
“Wow, that’s not as romantic as I expected. I had hoped for something more dramatic, like Potter realizing his undying love for you, so he had to chase you all around the world to rescue you from a marriage you didn’t want.” Astoria sighed and slouched into the couch.
As he held up the snitch in a victory pose his eyes met Dracos. The Slytherin nodded in acknowledgement and smiled lightly. Harry, overwhelmed by a flood of emotions, only grinned back goofily.
Harry grabbed the chart and threw it into the fire. "Have a seat."
“I think, he’s going to look cute in a dress” Harry sighed dreamily. Ron stared at his friend in horror.
Beside him Potter shifted and gave him a curious look. “Malfoy, are you crying? Don’t tell me your icy heart is feeling touched!?”
He rushed to the floor where all unmarried ladies had already gathered, pushing against each other to get into a better spot. Then, Neville turned his back to the waiting crowd and threw his bouquet high in the air.
At the beginning of the match Harry found himself entraced with the beautiful sight of Draco on his broom. He had skill and emited the same elegance in his movements in air as he did on the ground. Harry broke free from his daydreams reluctantly and focused on searching the snitch.
Ron cackled. “Then everything would make so much more sense. Having long hair, wearing make-up. All you need is a skirt and you’d be a girl.”
“He is a donkey”, the prince laughed and turned to his father. “He is a donkey who wants to marry a prince. My father, if your son is to marry a donkey, what are you?”
Draco sighed dramatically. He felt like cotton candy personified. But hell, if he wasn’t the most delicious cotton candy to walk the earth!
McGonagalls hand slamming against the desk made Harry withdraw into his own chair.
“So you were actively ignoring me!” Harry accused him. He already knew it, but it kind of hurt a little nevertheless. “What did I do, that you’re treating me like this?”
“Stay where you are!” Draco cried again. “I'm not letting you go like this!”
“Why don’t you go and ask Malfoy that? Take it as opportunity to start a conversation and then ask him out!” Hermione suggested, smiling rather serenely.
Draco sighed and pinched his nose. “Great. I’m sure they hate me for dragging you into an unwanted match.”
Over the next few days, the entire people of Gryffindor were in excitement. Their beloved king had finally announced his intention to marry. Cheers broke out in the streets. For a long time, the people had been waiting to finally see their king wedded.
The blond took the flower with delicate fingers and said “It would be my pleasure.” Blushing hard, Draco cursed his pale skin. He had blushed this morning so many times already, it was enough red cheeks for a lifetime.
“Harry does that?” Hermione asked. “Yep”, Ron sighed. “He was driving me nuts with all his bitching and moaning. That’s also one reason, why I made fun of Malfoy. I thought, confronting Malfoy would make him finally shut up.”
“Then let us take a leap together. I'll take you as my husband”, the blond prince exclaimed.
Laughing wetly, Harry kissed Dracos temple and got up. Merlin, what a dramatic start into the day. Draco sighed and buried his face in his hands. Now he had done it, he had basically confessed to Harry. Draco peeked through his fingers at the Gryffindor who had resumed tinkering around in the kitchen, humming something that sounded suspiciously like “hoggy-hoggy-hogwarts”.
Ron looked rather ill but quickly nodded his agreeance at Hermione’s glare.
After setting Draco down in the middle of the sparse room, he pointed in the direction of the fireplace and said, "Heat the stove. Cook soup on the cooker and make up our bed where we both sleep".
"If you are still convinced afterwards that Draco has not changed, we will look for a solution. Together. But you cannot leave him alone." Hermione talked Harry into it.
When it was safe to come out, Draco emerged from his hideout. He decided to go look for a drink because he really needed one after that stressful confrontation but didn’t make it far when Potter grabbed his hand.
“Ehm, I’m not so sure, if I’m honest. I’m worried about my parents reaction to the marriage. I would feel better, if I didn’t have to face them alone, but your presence probably wouldn’t help the situation either.” Draco felt a little helpless. He was happy, Harry might give him a new future, but he was so afraid of losing his family.
Draco averted his eyes, trying to snatch his hand back. “Don’t do that.”
Draco tried to express all his anger in poisonous words, but he could not. All what was conveyed was how much he hurt.
As the sun slowly bowed, Draco was sure his feet were bleeding. Heavens, he couldn't stand it any more. "I don't want, don't want, don't want any more!" Draco stomped his foot furiously.
And Potter certainly did not love him back. How could he love someone like him? Both as a prince and as a beggar he was incapable of anything.
“So what, you are friends with him, too?” Harry asked. Nope, he wasn’t jealous. Not one bit.
„Not again, Harry!“, Ron exclaimed. „You’re way too obsessed with the ferret, mate. If I didn’t know better, I would say you have a crush on him“, he added shaking his red head.
But Potter just smiled mysteriously and winked, “That’s a secret”.
A sudden thought made Draco laugh out loud. Startled Harry asked, “What is it?”
“No, just that I’m apparently after your fame and money. I’m surprised, they didn’t accuse me of forcing you into marriage somehow.” Draco shrugged.
Draco knew, he couldn’t avoid Harry forever. At some point he had to see him to collect his things from the flat and to actually break the bond. Draco was glad, Harry was on a week long mission starting today. That gave him some time, to prepare himself mentally and get over the worst of his heartbreak.
“Yes, I would like that. I don’t want to be a burden. When did you learn how to cook?”
Well. Harry felt slightly overwhelmed. He had a lot to process. His friends thought he was gay and had the hots for Malfoy. And if Harry was honest with himself, his reactions to the Slytherin lately made a lot more sense now. He looked up at his friends and was torn between feeling grateful and betrayed. They could have told him this sooner. And not everyone at once confronting him like this.
Carefully, Draco began to speak, "Don't laugh at me."
"Oh, my boy. I'm sorry if it brings up bad memories. But would you bake them again? The King showed interest in food for the first time in days when he mentioned the treacle tart."
“Hey, I didn’t want to see him in a skirt! I just said, the only thing missing from Malfoy being a girl would be wearing a skirt!”
The King nodded and made his way to the small hut to talk to Draco. On the way, he realized that he had overreacted strongly. He owed Draco an apology and an explanation. The time had come for him to reveal his identity and his trick.
“Enough talking”, Draco snapped as Blaise opened his mouth. “First give me the damn hangover potion!”
“I’m sorry, ok? I’m definitely not a homophobe, my brother is homosexual, too. And I know, that clothes shouldn’t be gender specific. Mum used to dress me up in dresses, before Ginny was born, and I rather liked it. I just wanted to mess a little with Malfoy, that’s all. Don’t hit me” Ron held up his hands in defence.
„Oh“, Draco said surprised and blushing, „I thought everybody was already through with showering.“
I grin and bury my nose in the blonde locks inhaling the intoxicating scent that is purely Malfoy.
How dare Voldemort touch what’s mine? How dare he soil my precious treasure? How dare he make my Draco cry?
“Potter, did you just apparated us wandlessly?” Draco asked, voice carefully neutral.
Astoria gave Harry a calculating look and then latched onto Draco. “Actually, yes. But it’s good, that you’re here, Potter, because I can inform you now, that Draco will be staying here tonight. He has some debts to pay, you see.” Draco helped Astoria stand up and she clutched tightly onto his arm.
Before anyone could move or say something Molly Weasley bustled forward hugging a shocked frozen Draco. “Oh, you poor dear. Trapped in an unwanted marriage! But our Harry is quite the catch, so please give him a chance. At least you didn’t get Ron as your soulmate, that would have been a disaster.”
As I contemplated whether moonlight would make Malfoys hair appear more silver than that golden tone like right now I was interrupted from my musing by Ron who sat down opposite me, effectively blocking my view of Malfoy. Now that was just rude.
Harry seemed to consider something before nodding, “Okay. I’m making dinner.” With that he left Draco alone to his confusing thoughts.
I huffed annoyed. First of all, my voice isn’t that high. Second, Malfoys hair was really fascinating. The color always changing with the external conditions.
Slowly a smug grin spread over the prince's face. He was well aware of his good looks and obviously it was still his strongest weapon. With a little flirting he would certainly sell a lot of goods.
“Of course, you’re his family after all. I told him all sorts of stories about you.” Harry smirked, “His favorite story is how Draco the dragon turned into a ferret. Ron got him a ferret plush toy and Teddy calls it ‘Draco’. He loves it.”
The week went by fast. Harry taught Draco how to cook and they visited Teddy often. As promised, Harry took Draco on very fancy dates. But before that, Draco insisted to get Harry a whole new wardrobe, so they went shopping.
The rest of lunch and the day, really, passed uneventfully to Harrys dismay. He tried to strike up a conversation, but Malfoy was back to ignoring him.
'What's going on here? I am confused...' thought Draco and could not take his eyes off the Gryffindor King. He was so dizzy, he felt like he was going to faint.
“Ron, you are a genius!” Harry beamed.
"But he didn't take you," the beggar snapped.
“Owl us, if you need anything, Draco!” Pansy shouted from the door, but Draco didn’t react.
"Hello, you. You seem to be new here. I am Luna. Who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing here? What's your name?"
Harry feared the day of the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin. He was afraid how the now friendly relationship with Draco would turn out when one of them loses the game. Despite being in love Harry wasn’t going to let the boy of his dreams win. He would play with all seriousness.
“Mmh, ‘kay. What are you all doing here? I remember marrying only one of you lot.” Potter frowned. A confused Potter was quite cute, Draco thought absently. Wait.
“Potter, what the fuck!” Finally, Draco didn’t blink anymore. “We are wizards, what are silencing charms for? I’ve put up a dozen before the party began.”
Draco never understood how they could become so distant, after all family always comes first, that’s what he learned from his parents. And his parents even accepted him and Harry, so why would they break contact with Aunt Andromeda? He suspected the circumstances were different then and his parents were too stuck in the pureblood ideology. But they had learned after the war, too. Draco was sure, his parents just were too proud and feeling guilty to contact Andromeda. Well, now Draco had the chance to reconnect his mother with her sister again.
“Sit.” She demanded and they obeyed. McGonagall seemed pretty pissed off and if she was angry, she was even more frightening then Snape.
“Right, uhm. Lunch?” Harry asked. Malfoy nodded.
“But”, Harry peeked out from under the cushion, “what am I supposed do, now?”
In the warm arms of the cook, Draco collapsed once more. He had just lost his home, the place where he could be himself for the first time. And he had also left his first love behind. Only now did he realize the feeling for what it was and that to love sometimes meant to let go. And that was exactly what he was doing now. He had left the beggar because he loved him and wished a better life for him.
“Why do you pity me?”, Draco was genuinely confused.
And true love, he was convinced, could be found in one Draco Malfoy, Slytherins Ice Prince.
The blond looked suspiciously at the hut and turned his nose away. He had never seen anything so disgusting. Even the stable boys in his father's castle had better quarters.
Potter blushed a little and said sheepishly, “I noticed many things about you, back in school. I mean, we were rivals and all that. Guess, I never forgot any of it.”
“No, Ronald we’re not going to hug people. Well, I suppose Luna would hug people…The clubs purpose is to call attention to a peaceful and non-violent togetherness. Maybe you should join, too. It definitely wouldn’t hurt your language.” Hermione said patiently to her boyfriend.
Taking a shaky breath, Draco suppressed the tears that threatened to escape his eyes. Then he straightened and made his eyes steely, his voice cold. “We’re getting a divorce, right now. Or I swear to Satan, I will disfigure you all beyond recognition. I’ll make it so you’ll wish to look like that toad Dolores Umbridge. So, you all better hurry back to your rooms, pack your things and meet me at the reception in fifteen minutes, ready to portkey back to England. Did I make myself clear?”
Soon he noticed that the beggar liked treacle tart especially and the dish became his best practiced one.
After breakfast Harry said, “For today, I thought you could meet Teddy. And tonight I want to take you out on a date.”
The blond made himself a tea and grabbed yesterdays Daily Prophet to read the article about him and Harry. Salazar, he looked silly in that dress. His friends could’ve given him at least something more mature to wear at his wedding. Draco proceeded to read the article dreadfully. As Draco expected, the article congratulated Harry but gave subtle hints about Draco not being good enough for the savior of the wizarding world. But that wasn’t something specific about Draco, they would have written the same about any partner of Harrys.
“Well,” Draco squeaked rather high pitched and then coughed embarrassedly before trying again. “Well, if it’s any consolation to you, all of Slytherin house was quite adamant about telling me to stop moaning about you. Apparently, I’m quite obvious and oblivious, too.”
Shit. King Louis the Greats portrait was now ruined. The red wine ran from the painting like blood. Grandpa Louis had died on the battledfield covered in his enemys blood and the painting showed his final glorious moments. The wine gave the painting an enlivening effect, fascinating indeed. Again, Lucius was interrupted from admiring the results of his sons tantrum when the same began to scream.
“You are aware that clothing and valuing one’s appearance don’t define gender, yes? And calling someone by a degrading name, just because his sexual orientation deviates from your own is the same as calling me ‘mudblood’. So, Ron, tell me, do I have to hit some sense into your head with this book or am I misunderstanding something?” Harry suppressed to comment on Hermione breaking her non-violence-clubs commitment.
Draco was content with ignoring his crush, really. But then Potter had to go and punch him. And Draco could accept having one sided feelings, yes. But crushing on someone who gave a shit to his feelings and punched him, was something Draco couldn’t accept. So, he fought back and then had to held Potters bloody hand the entire day!
Harry followed the snake and gasped in horror as he saw the many red lines cutting the white skin. Draco watched the exchange in silence. When Harry met his eyes, the silver was clouded in sadness.
“What?” screeched Harry. “Why would you tell her? Did you also tell her, what it was about?”
Before Draco could reach me though, he was intercepted by Voldemort. “Potter’s already dead. But I appreciate the enthusiasm. I see, you have found the right way again. You will be a valuable asset in my ranks, Draco.” And with those words Voldemort embraced the blonde boy.
And whenever the DADA professor asked a question, Potter would prompt his own ridiculous answer, smirking sideways at Draco as if to challenge him into pointing out the right answer. Draco nearly cracked and corrected the Gryffindor.
“You look like you fell into a puddle of unicorn poop” Weasley said gleefully and broke out in cackling laughter.
Over summer break Draco had realized he had taken a fancy on Potter. Not only was Potter a boy, which his erotic dreams reminded him daily of, but he was his archnemesis, too. One didn’t fancy ones enemy, is just wasn’t done. Especially not when ones name was Draco Malfoy.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were back at Hogwarts for the so called eight year to finish their education. Harry was very excited, because finally he was once again at home. And without a dark wizard threatening his life at that! So, yey for normalcy!
“I am outraged”, Lord Crabbe laughed hysterically.
I was so lost in my thoughts of Draco and how he is going to torture me if I survived I didn’t even notice all the Death Eaters around me. Only when Voldemort himself started to cackle I was focusing on my surroundings.
“Oh, darling, I am mad. But not for what you did. I mean, I pity you, really. You’re bonded with your unrequited love, that’s shitty.” She patted Dracos leg. “Thanks for rubbing salt into the wound”, Draco frowned.
Potter looked at him sourly and nodded. His partner was full on laughing now.
"Harry, what have you done?" she demanded in a commanding tone.
His two best friends stopped their flirting and followed Harrys gaze.
“Ew, I don’t want to get sick. Whatever makes them so happy all day is surely contagious.” Malfoy grimaced.
A few minutes later Neville and Blaise followed, hand in hand, smiling sappily at each other, eyes shining with tears of joy.
Apparently, Malfoy was in love with me since we met at age eleven. I guess the bullying was his way of showing affection. In hindsight, some of his pranks were really cute.
Sighing defeatedly, Draco got out of the shower and returned to the bedroom with only a towel wrapped around his hips. He got dressed and didn’t notice Harrys hungry gaze lingering on him. Draco startled violently when he looked up and met green eyes.
Harry shrank from her rage. Though Harry had successfully fought a war and defeated the brutal warrior Voldemort, an angry Hermione Granger was more terrifying than all the horrors of the world.
Draco followed the guards who led him to the kitchen through the imposing Hogwarts Castle as if in trance. He paid no attention to all the splendor, for he missed the small shabby hut.
Draco shook his head, searching for a witty comeback. “You have one dirty mind, Potter. I do not appreciate your enthusiasm.” His face lit up. “Oh. There you have your rhyme!”
Confused Malfoy took a seat several tables away from her. “No, Granger. I’m interested in Linguistics Of Various Educationsystems, you got the title wrong.”
Well, wasn’t that a revelation, Draco thought and took another sip. Of course, one notices how ones enemy likes their tea, that’s valued information if you want to poison them.
“Then take me out of here” Draco said suggestively.
Yawning, Harry opened his eyes. Sleepily he gave Draco a sloppy kiss. “G’morning, love.” It wasn’t fair, how Harry never got hung over like Draco.
When Voldemort finally led go, the blonde stumbled shell shocked to his mother. Collapsing in Narcissas arms Draco began to wail. “H-he t-t-touched m-m-me, m-m-motheeeeer. I l-liked this s-shirt.” By now he was full on sobbing. “Now I have to burn it. Mother, please obliviate me.”
“I–I don’t know. It felt pretty good. I was happy he finally looked at me again. I want him to keep doing that. I got this warm feeling in my stomach and my–my heart fluttered when I touched him. I want to keep touching him.” Harry blushed. Figuring out his emotions was hard. There were just so many of them when it came to the blonde.
“It’s nearly 3 pm, Potter”, Theo drawled, barely holding his laughter back.
“If that’s what you want, yes. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.” Harry answered and Draco felt warmth spreading from his chest through his whole being.
Groaning in frustration Draco flopped dramatically onto his bed.
“G’morning” Harry said, voice still gruff from sleep. His hair was sticking up in all directions. Draco blushed and cleared his throat. “Good morning.”
Draco gasped. “Father wouldn’t say such things! He certainly didn’t elope, that’s improper!”
When I came to stand before Draco, he grabbed me by the collar and I leaned in, expecting a kiss. But what I got was a slap in the face. And another.
Meanwhile, Hermione was informed of the events and immediately rushed at the king.
Crabbe only got redder and laughed harder.
Then it all crashed down on him again. He was married to a man, who didn’t love him back. A man, who slept with him because it was fun. Ah, yes. That feeling of humiliation was more like it. How long would it be, before Harry got fed up with him and wasn’t interested in having a soulmate anymore? Draco had hoped that Harry would come to love him eventually. But that wasn’t very realistic, was it? Because, what was there to love? Draco was an Ex-Death Eater, he had bullied Harry in school, he was a spoiled brat.
“No need to worry, Duke Smith. You are definitely not a barrel as thin as you are,” Lucius beckoned the next candidate to the front.
He had never had to cook before and was easily overwhelmed with his task. But he was too proud to ask the beggar for help. Besides, in the castle he had sometimes watched the cook when he sneaked into the kitchen to snack a little something. The whole thing could not be that difficult. He put some millet into the small pot and poured salt into it.
Theo gleefully saying “I’m so gonna buy a pensieve, just to watch this repeatedly” was the last thing Draco registered before he fainted.
“You speak French?” Harry asked incredulously.
The potions class continued rather peaceful. Until Snape made his final round. Malfoy took some fuzzy looking ingredient and tossed it in our cauldron which immediately exploded and covered Snape who just turned in our direction, in stinking green slime.
“Since when were they such good friends, anyway?” Harry mumbled into the table.
Draco blanched, then turned pink. No man had ever spoken to him like that before. "G-go out the door f-first," he stammered. For safety, he added, "And close your eyes!"
“That equations thing?” Ron asked, pulling a face.
“How glorious, son.” Lucius was relieved to finally be able to end the whole circus and shouted, “Oh, take a leap of faith into marital bliss!”
Lucius gasped. “That’s Gryffindor’s king. It’s a peace offering!”, the Slytherin king exclaimed.
“Who?” asked Ron next to him confused. The confusion didn’t last long though. “Wait, don’t say it! I know, because he’s all you think about. What is it this time?” Ron sighed. He really loved his friend, but if he heard “shiny, blond hair; I wonder if his curls are natural; I bet it’s soft” one more time, he was going to strangle him.
). Then Hermione was slurring something (
Zabini approached and once again took Draco's hand. “We could provide you with everything you need and you wouldn’t have to worry about working.”
Malfoy and his friends were already in the dungeon classroom, chattering happily. When we entered the room, he looked up briefly to sneer in my direction. Then made some remark that had the other Slytherins looking up at me as well and break out in laughter.
“Thank you, I’m relieved to hear that.” Draco said seriously and Teddy nodded importantly. “Do you want to see my plush ferret? His name is Draco, too!” The boy wriggled out of Harrys arms and grabbed Dracos hand to drag him into his room.
“Yes, we got into this situation due to shitty circumstances, but you need two people for a wedding. No matter how intoxicated I was, I gave my consent. And true, I want a family, but you said yourself that maybe I can get it with you and Teddy. I would have married Astoria purely out of obligation to my parents. I really am super gay. And, shit, Harry! I like you! I fancy the shit out of you since forever! So don’t you dare lead me on and give me hope that there might be something between us, if you can’t even endure being with me!” Damn, now Draco was crying, too.
Ginny reminded Draco of Astoria – a pretty but fierce woman, who could be very scary when it came to her loved ones.
Taking in the little room, which seemed to be both bedroom and kitchen at the same time, the prince asked in amazement, "I should do all that? Are there no servants?"
"The castle of Thrushbeard?" asked Draco, startled. "I cannot go there. I wronged the King of Gryffindor some time ago."
“Aha. I can see it on your faces”, Draco sayed in despise. “Just put yourself and your wine away. And take comfort in a barrel, because barrels belong to barrels and not to me.”
When Harry just blushed and didn’t deny it, Draco’s laughter died. The blond’s cheeks coloured bright red.
Draco was on guard. He really was. But then Potter asked him what kind of hair care he was using. And stupid Potter sniffed at Dracos head, wrinkled his nose amused and announced that it had to be something extremely extravagant, because Draco was such a ‘posh git’, right on time when professor Slughorn entered the potions classroom.
Potter put his hand on Draco’s waist and the Slytherin immediately protested. “Potter, honestly! I vividly remember your two left feet from the Yule-Ball in fourth year! I will lead, naturally.” Draco put Potter’s hand on his shoulder and grabbed Potter by the waist. “Besides, I’m taller, midget.”
“Exactly. I like the thrill and I need the adventure.”
„He’s ignoring me agaaaain“, whined Harry two days after the significant hand holding incident. He thudded his head against the table.
And really, as if I ever would walk away. Draco was the drug I needed to live, to feel. I was utterly hooked.
Luna shook her head solemnly. “The others already said all of it. I think you should go for it, Harry. You would make a cute couple. It would help with the wrackspurts, too.”
A breath of air made him tremble and he noticed that he was still stark naked. And suddenly he could no longer hold back the tears.
“Come on, darling. Let’s go down to your father. You’re staying for lunch, of course.”
Grateful, Draco took a sip of his perfectly made tea. “Did you sleep well?” Harry asked and Draco got caught in a coughing fit. “What, uhm, what do you mean?” he spluttered, his face was definitely unattractively red again.
Ron was frozen in shock. Then he turned an angry red and spluttered. “Did he just kiss me?” Then he paled. “Does this count as cheating on Hermione?”
Before Prince Draco could protest – undoubtedly with another temper tantrum – King Lucius signaled and the guards captured the prince with a net. Effectively immobilised one brave guard picked up the prince and carried him princess style into his chambers. As soon as a few maids were also in the princes room it was barricaded and ten elite soldiers stood guard.
The next day, Harry wandered the halls of Hogwarts. It was very early in the morning and the probability to run into someone was very low. Harry was dead tired but was too nervous to sleep.
“Yes, that’s what I thought. Turns out, though, it’s a club to make friends and bring love and peace to the students of Hogwarts.”
He then proceeded to punch his fists into my chest. “How could you – leave me like that! – Fuck the world! – Fuck the prophecy! – You are a fucking teenager! You’re not supposed to have all that fucking responsibility! I told you to let others handle this shit!”
Desperately thinking, the prince had to realize that a few hours had passed and he still had no thread. Angrily he had to admit to himself that he had not succeeded in spinning.
Laughing, Harry shook his head. "Potter, the King."
“The flyer says, there is a honeymoon phase. It lasts approximately two weeks in which you have to be in constant proximity of each other, so you can get used to the bond. After that you’re okay with being apart for most of the time but have to have physical contact at least two times a week. If not, the bond becomes unstable and you will feel in pain until you touch your partner again.”
But then Harry pulled the cap off Draco's head and the people were blinded by the shining gold.
Meanwhile Harry Potter, King of Gryffindor sat on his throne in a very very bad mood.
“Ron, you’re a god!”
"Damn! I knew it!" She pulled out a chart. "According to my calculations, this should have happened by now." She showed the assembled Gryffindors a representation of a graph proudly. On one axis was the estimated annoyance of her friends, on the other the frequency of the inclusion of graphs in Hermione's explanations.
“Hey, look. About the bond thing, how about staying at my place for the time being? You’re still living at the manor with your parents, right?” Potter inquired, rubbing his neck.
And Draco could cook to a certain extent. He was confident in that ability at least. So, the castles kitchen it was.
Resigned to his fate, Draco said “I can make badges.”
King Lucius sighed. But much time for grieving the loss of porcellan was refused to him. Prince Draco had reached out for the decanter – filled with very excellent red wine imported from the southern colonies, the best there is, because the prince wouldn’t drink anything else these days. Lucius barely managed to dodge the gush of liquid.
“Great. Hi, I’m Harry.” Potter held out his hand and smiled softly. Draco, taking the offered hand tentatively, said “Hello Harry, I’m Draco.” They held their gazes and squeezed their hands for a minute until it became awkward.
“I’m so sorry, Harry. I will research the bond and find a solution, I promise”, Hermione said and hugged Potter tightly.
Luna pulled Draco to her side and began to make some room at her stand. After the initial overstrain, Draco got back on his senses. "Thank you, but I can do it alone," he hissed and snatched his arm away from Lunas grip. What was this girl thinking of, patronizing him like that?
“But it suits you so well!” Luna argued.
“Because you are so ugly! Farewell”, and laughing, Harry turned around and began to walk out of the hall.
‘The day seems very successful’, the blond found and laughed happily at the thought of what he could buy all of today's earnings. Draco could prepare a real feast and the beggar would be very proud of him.
“You are old enough to act like a mature adult, Draco. You should have married years ago, but I granted you your freedom. I accepted that none of the young gentlemen I introduced to you were of your taste. But now it’s time for you to find a partner as long as you are so pretty.“
Potter looked equally shocked. “Malfoy” he said faintly.
“Hush, Harry. You were confused. Now, I wasn’t finished.” Neville glanced at his paper again. “Where was I? Ah, right. Harry, you are not only gay. You are gay for Draco Malfoy, have been for years. You have suppressed your feelings for so long. Like I suppressed my inner Gryffindor. So, I say to you now, from war hero to war hero: you have to embrace who you are! And in your case, Harry, it’s being gay. For Malfoy.”
Astoria ignored Dracos comment and continued. “However, what I’m mad about is that I missed all the fun. I mean, from an outsiders perspective it’s fucking hilarious. You guys are always doing the cool things without me.” Astoria pouted. “I would have wanted to be bridesmaid. And I would have made sure, you weren’t wearing such a disgusting dress. Eggshell white just isn’t your color, it had to be ivory!”
“Didn’t you hear him firing that servant, Dobby or something, just now? Just because he spilled a little wine at his jacket. He sounded really nasty. And now he’s making us wait for nearly an hour because he has to change his whole outfit. He could just put on a new coat.“ Ron tried to reason with his friend.
Actually, the king was dressed quite simply for a royal. But his attitude and his aura were those of a true king. Unbridled and wild, yet elegant and authoritative.
The form underneath Draco began to wriggle, then rubbed his eyes before opening them.
„My feet a killing me“ he moaned and was promptly swept off his feet.
Draco melted in the beggar's embrace. He was very stiff at first, but the warmth of the other man and the security offered by his strong arms made him relax. He had never felt so secure before. And then the kiss so tender and loving that it took his breath away. He gasped and the beggar took the opportunity to stick his tongue in his mouth.
„Why are your lips tasting like cherries?” asked Ron mortified. His face showed nothing but horror. “Did Malfoy kiss you, too?”
Annoyed, Draco huffed. Why does Potter have to be so bloody irritating and sexy when he opens his mouth. “Well, aren’t you rudeness, and sarcasm and everything – Oh…” Draco faltered and blushed heavily.
But too soon Malfoy packed his school bag and dragged Harry into the Great Hall for dinner. They sat at the Ravenclaw table again.
The king lost his appetite out of all the self-accusations and worry. How could he eat when his spouse was perhaps starving?
After a comforting hug from the cook, Draco set to work, trying not to think about Potter. But he did think of green eyes and a rough voice that softly hummed songs.
Draco felt himself getting used to his new life as the beggars husband and felt happier than ever before. Now he had a purpose and a special someone who seemed genuinely interested in him as a person not as a prince. He would never admit it, but he knew his feelings towards the beggar turned slowly into something that’s called love.
One dance became two, three. Then Draco lost count, enjoying the warmth of Potter’s hand, the solid presence of Potter’s body pressed against his own. Potter’s hand creeped slowly but surely up Draco’s shoulder to rest at his neck, caressing gently his nape.
But when Harry arrived at the cabin, he found it empty. The blond prince was not at home. He waited two nights full of worry, but Draco never returned. Desperately, he searched the whole city for the prince, but all efforts remained fruitless. Draco had disappeared without a trace.
Before I could think of a catchphrase the procession stopped. Voldemort gleefully announced my death and chuckled when all Hogwarts students, professors and Order members gasped in shock and some people broke down in tears.
But the beggar was not disturbed at all. He just pulled more intensely on Draco's hand, which he still held tightly. "Come along, we have no time to rest. There are now two of us and we have to earn twice as much money."
By now Draco just clutched my shirt tightly as if his life depended on it. “I was so scared you wouldn’t come back.”
Hermione seemed to have quite different concerns. "Where is Draco now? Have you taken him to the castle yet?"
Greg just shrugged as he went to bed himself and said matter of factly “It kind of clicked today, seeing you both hold hands. Explains your obsession over all those years. ‘Night.”
Harry gave Malfoy an appraising look. Ah, he finally cracked. “I don’t know, what you mean, Malfoy. I’m just trying to do the adult thing and have a conversation with you. But you keep dodging me.”
Harry let his gaze drift to the frame of the grey eyes. Malfoys face was softer than he remembered. His white blonde hair got a little longer during the summer and was prevented from falling in his eyes by a half bun. One ear was adorned with a silver creole giving the blonde boy a cool and laid-back appearance. The smooth skin was so incredible pale that the red lips stand out. And damn, those lips looked totally kissable…
A girl with golden blond hair and clear blue eyes, who offered very exotic looking flowers and jewelry made of vegetables for sale, became aware of the amazed prince.
"What is there to laugh at? Business is bad. And what have you done?", the black-haired man asked in a crunch.
Draco looked up in surprise “A–a date?”
Harry cleared his throat. “Right. So, how about you moving in here? I don’t have a spear bedroom though… I swear, I won’t touch you, when you not explicitly tell me to.” Harry crossed his fingers over his heart.
“I going to make postcards out of those pictures! The world needs to have ugly Malfoy postcards” Ron chuckled.
Harry also had decided to act on his feelings. He was way too impatient to take his time coming to terms with his feelings. If he wanted Draco, then he wanted him right now. Maybe he should make an elaborate wooing plan, but that wasn’t his style. Being impulsive and a little reckless was more his thing. Though to not be completely unprepared he took his time strolling around to think about what he wanted to say to the blond.
Two mental breakdowns and a very long shower later found Draco in the hotel restaurant with his traitorous friends chatting happily with the Gryffindor trio. Draco was squeezed in between Potter and Greg. Greg took so much space, Draco had to lean into Potter who wouldn’t budge an inch, though he had enough space left to his other side.
The beggar happily made his way into the city and went straight into Hogwarts Castle.
“Oh, yes. That’s because Luna installed that new club that Draco and I joined yesterday.” Hermione piped in.
He felt miserable. Hopeless. He would never find love. All he will ever get are men who were after his name and political influence. He would be damned if he let the tosser with his emerald green eyes and his kissable lips get the better of him.
“No, but I have seen it.” Draco marveled at the italian styled interior.
Malfoy looked up sharply. “Loon–ehm, Lovegood” he nodded curtly in her direction.
“What did you and my father speak about? You seemed to have got on incredibly well, against all expectations.” Draco rubbed his eyes sleepily. When he and mother came down to catch father and Harry for lunch, both men were laughing amicably and sharing a whisky.
“Yes, I am”, said Harry and brought the hand Draco hadn’t realized he was still holding to his lips.
Merlin, Draco felt miserable. He not only lost his virginity to his unrequited love interest, but he lost his family. And of course, he lost whatever little was left of his dignity after war. He lost all to Potter, who didn’t lose anything. Who married Draco on a whim, as a joke, because it was fun.
All Harry saw were coquettish looks, flirtatious touches, blushing cheeks and lips curled into a lascivious smile. And none of this was directed at Harry. None of this was ever given to the beggar in the hut. The rage in Harry piled up as he watched as strange men tampered with his Draco, his property.
And with that Draco strode into the hall, nose high in the air and sneer in place. He came to halt next to King Lucius.
Snape paired us off for brewing a highly explosive potion. Luck was on my side and I was paired with Malfoy.
Draco shook the hand, swallowing. “Pleasure.”
“I overheard you talking with Bill and Hermione. You said, you want to break the bond, so you can finally free yourself from the burden that is me.” Draco said bitterly. Harry was cruel to make him spell it out.
The king raised his voice and said, "And now, I would like to introduce you to my spouse. This is he." And he took Draco's hand and kissed it gently.
Harry leapt up and took on a defensive stance. But he was sure he didn’t look that impressive because his whole body began trembling. “No.” Harry’s voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “No, I have it under control. I can stop whenever I want!” Judging by the looks on his friends' faces, he did not convey the nonchalant tone he was aiming for.
Draco wanted to say “yes, because friends would never be enough” but held his tongue.
The Prince sighed softly and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck. The last time Draco was kissed like that was with King Thrushbeard. But the king was forgotten under the beggar's dark green gaze. Forgotten the kiss Draco still dreamed of sometimes. The kiss with the beggar was so much better than that dream.
“I'd love to”, Harry replied and did just that. He cupped the blonds cheek and planted his lips on the others. The kiss was soft and tasted oh so sweet like treacle tart.
“I don't want him to laugh“, hissed the blond prince.
With these words, music resounded and people danced. But the king indicated to the servants with his hand that they should serve the food. In the middle of the movement, however, the king paused and suddenly stared intensely at Draco.
Harry grinned triumphantly and embraced Draco. Slowly, almost shyly, he gently put his lips to the prince's. After a moment Harry became bolder and pressed against Draco's lips with more pressure. Carefully he ran his tongue over his lower lip.
“Draco, please call me Luna. We’re all friends here.” Granger snorted. Then her eyes widened. “Please tell me, the club isn’t about Nargles and Wrackspurts and you chose the name LOVE because it’s short for your last name!”
Draco wanted to protest, but he felt too weak. Hermione barely managed to drag him into the waiting area when his knees buckled.
What would a beggar want with a proud prince? Even beggars are not that stupid. Draco was quite pleased about this fact.
The End.
Draco couldn’t help the tears that were flowing. Lucius wiped them away with his thumb. “I expect you to be more open and honest with me and your mother, from now on, Draco. It will take time to get adjusted to your newest lifechoice and it is hard to bury longheld animosity. But we will make an effort to welcome your partner into our family.” Lucius said gently. “If Potter behaves, that is”, he added. Draco laughed and kissed his fathers hand.
„Thank you, `Mione“, Harry sighed relieved to know that he wasn’t the only one noticing things about his school rival.
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I’m so selfish! You have no obligation to stay with me. If you want I–“ he swallowed heavily between hiccups, “I’ll kill myself to set you free.”
„Harry, you’re doing it again“, Hermione nudged me gently with her elbow.
Harry's sheepish grin and the way he rubbed his neck was confirmation enough. Ron rolled his eyes and struggled not to faint. "Please, not the Ferret!"
But Lucius remained stubborn in his decision.
“Gentleman, I had hoped that with aging you would become more mature. But apparently, despite adulthood, you have the mind of a kindergartener.” McGonagall admonished the boys. “Maybe you should be treated as such.”
The employee said eagerly, “Of course, Mr. Potter!” Draco said “tch”.
Draco was stiff as a board as Voldemort hugged him. His face flickering from disbelief to disgust to horror.
In class Malfoy would shush him, and in between classes he dragged Harry into the library where he chose a table directly in front of Madam Pince who hissed menacingly every time Harry made to ask Malfoy something.
Finally he kissed me. He poured all the desperation he felt into that kiss, while I tried to reassure him, that we were both alive and safe.
The Slytherin slowly advanced, backing Ron up against the wall like a lion – how ironic – it’s prey. He grabbed Ron by his robes and then smashed their lips together. Letting Rons lips go with a loud popping sound, he grinned smugly.
“Sure”, Draco grinned. “Tell me about the movie we’re going to see.”
Draco groaned and buried his face in his hands. Harry outright laughed. “You alright, Draco?” They were standing in front of the door now.
“Shut up, Potter!” Draco sniffled and blinked some more but accepted the handkerchief Potter offered. “Malfoys don’t get touched and cry at weddings. That’s merely an allergic reaction to all the love in the air, I’ll have you know. Love is disgusting, really.”
“Thank you, Mione. I think it’s better, if you give us some time for ourselves now.” Potter said and gently ushered her and the rest of their friends out.
Harry made an angry sound and fisted Malfoys robes. He drew him in to…to what exactly? Punch him again in front of McGonagall? Harry wasn’t so sure anymore. Malfoys minty puffs of breath were really distracting.
“Could I see both your hands, please?” the ministry worker performed a spell over their hands and nodding to himself made a few notes. He looked up at them, beaming. “Congratulations, Mr. and Mr. Potter, you’re legally bonded. That’s the strongest marriage bonding spell, I’ve ever seen.”
Harry looked up into silver eyes as the needles bore into his chest. „I love you“, he said to the blonde man who smiled back and whispered „I love you, too. Forever“ while the stars of the dragon constellation were engraved on Harrys skin.
“So you are not made of flesh like me, you are made of iron?”, Draco asked.
"Harry, when you married him, you took responsibility for him. Go to him, talk to him. Maybe everything is different than it seems. Give Draco a chance to explain himself. You can't just abandon him like that." Hermione was convinced there was a logical explanation for Draco's behavior. She knew that her friend had a terrible temper. But he also had a big heart.
“I won’t make any such promises. Obviously I drank so much, I have no recollection of what happened. But judging by there being a stranger here and my arse hurting that fucking much, I just lost my virginity on my stag night! I’m surprised I’m not panicking yet. Now, help me get rid of the man in my bed!”
Draco just looked confused between Harry and Astoria who were glaring at each other. He had the feeling he was missing out on something. “If you want to gossip and know all the details, I’ll tell you another time, when the bond has settled, okay? But for now, Harry and I are going home” he said and pulled Astoria into a hug to say goodbye. “What are you doing?”, Draco whispered to her. “He’s jealous and I’m having a little fun with him” Astoria grinned mischievously and gave Draco a wet kiss on the cheek.
"I heard that they are still looking for a kitchen help in the castle."
Harry, mildly miffed about everybody just talking above his head, assuming things and not listening to his denials, sneered “Malfoy.”
“Ok, let’s try” Draco said softly and Potter let out a relieved breath.
This year King Harold turned twenty one and his counselors urged him to get married. Harold, too, longed for a partner. He had very good friends and wasn’t feeling lonely, but he wished for someone significant who could stand at eye level with him, who didn’t worship him as the savior he was. Even his friends treated him as someone almighty from time to time.
“Oh, Draco just lend me his chapstick before you came in”, she pointed in his direction. Malfoy sat a few tables away from them and looked up. Spotting the trio, he smirked. Malfoy blew a kiss at Ron and winked.
How could the blond do this to him? Harry thought the prince had changed, but apparently he still craved luxury and being spoiled.
“They kissed. He’s in love!”, Lucius said delighted. The Slytherin king was already counting the treasures of Hogwarts he could gain from this union.
Potter, there was no denying it now, looked sleepily up into the curious faces of the Slytherins surrounding him. Draco was close to fainting.
“Don’t worry, they are very forgiving. And you are family now, they will welcome you warmly”, reassured Harry.
Draco could smell Harry and Salazar, was this intoxicating. This wasn’t good for Dracos heart. Or other body parts, for that matter. He could feel the rippling muscles beneath him. And, shit, something hard pressed against his hip. Draco wriggled again in a poor attempt of getting up and his own morning erection brushed against Harrys. The blond moaned and immediately froze in shock.
That was rather anticlimactic. I guess my magic hit him before I could.
Fake gasping and widening his eyes in shock, Malfoy pushed me in the chest and screamed “Potter, I said don’t touch anything!”
“Oh, that’s probably because I told Pansy we’re doing an intervention for you.” Hermione said.
The beggar would soon realise that he was useless and that he was just a clog on the leg. Then the beggar would kick him out and he would starve and freeze to death.
The first thing Draco felt as he slowly awoke from his peaceful slumber, was the warm body, that was wrapped around him. Sighing contently, he snuggled closer into the warmth. He took a deep breath, relishing in the familiar scent.
The prince looked Harry up and down. “Kiss me, my friend”, he demanded.
Slightly confused – what was the Gryffindor doing in Slytherin? – Ron replied, "She's in the library, as usual", and followed Harry, who hurried straight to the aforementioned place.
on it– grew hot and burned into his finger. Mortified, Draco stared at it, remembering what a heated ring meant. Harry was in severe danger.
“Well, it’s an unfamiliar house and bed. I was wondering, if it’s okay or if we should change something, so you feel more at home. Sorry, I forgot to ask yesterday.” Harry gave him an amused look. Did he notice anything from earlier?
The next morning Draco awoke from his restful slumber most involuntarily.
Potter seemed angry – jealous? – but Draco didn’t have the time to think about it further because he spotted a woman with a black bob.
“It’s also natural to be attracted to Malfoy. He is very handsome with that blond hair and aristocratic bone structure.” Hermione sighed dreamily and Ron made a noise sounding like a dying whale. Hermione cleared her throat. “Anyway, we are your best friends, of course we support you, even if you want to get romantically involved with Malfoy.”
“Nonsense. Potter isn’t in Vegas…” Except, a memory flashed in Dracos mind of Potter, Weasley and Granger at the casino bar. Potter was in Vegas!
“Tell me Draco, does he make you truly happy? You must have been desperate not to marry Astoria if you resort to such actions.”
So, Draco did the sensible thing and fled. He ran straight to Potter, clutched onto his shoulders and hid behind his back.
“Yeah, I know. But I have to talk to her properly, she’s still my friend and I owe her an explanation.” Draco shrugged.
Harry forgave Snape the unfair treatment the instant he was paired with Malfoy for the potion they were supposed to brew this lesson. He was very excited to observe Malfoy more closely. Harry had full intentions of testing whether the Slytherins change of heart also applied in close proximity to his school rival.
Draco blinked. “Oh. So, you’re really here because of nightly disturbance?” If that was true, he needed some punch.
“The name’s ‘Potter’ now, thank you.” Draco couldn’t resist the snippy reply and promptly hid himself behind Harrys back.
Draco wondered who the owner of this beautiful land was. The beggar noticed the enchanted look of his husband and explained to him that they were passing through the land of Gryffindor.
“Oh. Will that be alright, though? The Weasleys and my family don’t have a good history, as you know.” Draco was really nervous. What if they rejected him outright? He already had to deal with an unrequited love, being rejected by his husbands family was just too much.
“Yeah, you’re really dedicated to the cause, Draco. I bet you had some sleepless nights because of me in fourth year. You had to be quite infatuated with me to supply the whole student body with badges of my face.” Harry smirked.
Harry grinned, “Princess.”
“Well, well, it speaks!” Harry exclaimed, his insides feeling all warm and fuzzy. Finally, Malfoys voice was directed at him. Gods, how he missed this.
Sighing, Draco said to the Aurors “Alright. The real Aurors: stay here, I’ll be right back. The Stripper-Aurors: come with me.” He shooed the strippers down the hall.
All night long Harry and Draco were pottering. The prince never tired because he enjoyed his work. He forgot all his pride. And when morning came, the jugs were ready. And what was left of the clay stuck in the Prince's hair and in the beard of the beggar.
But of course, Potter’s glaring had no effect on his stupid friends. They were fearless Gryffindorks after all and approached Draco shamelessly.
Turns out, Ron was the expert on feelings in the trio. He was very perceptive when it came to others feelings (just his own feelings were a bit problematic, just look at him denying that he likes Hermione). Hermione was the cleverest of them but tended to analyze feelings on a too logical level. Also, she had Arithmancy now, so Ron would have to do, Harry thought.
The Gryffindor King took a shaky breath and drew up a plan.
The beggar opened the door of the small, shabby hut invitingly and said with a bow, "Enter, my darling!”
"I don't want it. I want you.”
Shortly after, the Aurors barged into the hospital, carrying a bloodied and unconscious Harry. Draco felt his stomach churn. When he wanted to go after Harry though, the chief healer stopped him. “No working on personal cases, Healer Potter. Go and try to rest a bit. Your husband is in good hands.”
“Yeah, no. Potter, we’re not soulmates. We are totally incompatible, that stupid spell must have gone wrong. We were all drunk after all.”
I tried to look around Ron to the object of my obsession but was disappointed to find the blonde had already finished breakfast and left the Great Hall. So I leant back on the bench again and tried to resume eating while ignoring the exasperated looks of my friends.
Damn, I'm hooked.
Voldemort was just pathetic, really. Couldn’t get it done twice now. And then he lets someone check whether I’m dead. So, he himself doesn’t believe in his magic. How someone so low level could become leader to a bunch of stuck up bigots puzzles me.
„Malfoy, are you using chapstick?” Ron asked incredulously. He knew Hermione would scold him later, but that opportunity to make a little bit of fun of Malfoy was too precious to waste. That was going to be fun.
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy. My office, now.” McGonagall said icily and stomped away.
But even those disgusting noble men had pride. And Draco planned to hurt that stupid pride so badly, that not even his beauty could compensate it. The blonde prince was a master of nasty words and he was going to use this talent until no one wanted to marry him. He just had to be careful not to accidentally start a war. But even that was only a small price to pay if he could accomplish his freedom.
Panicking, Draco sent his Patronus to Hermione, who came rushing to the hospital. She explained she got a Patronus from Ron, that their mission went awry, when they found the targets sooner than they thought and engaged in battle. They managed to capture the culprits, but Harry was hit with something. They already were on their way to St. Mungos.
The jugs smashed on the ground, the plates broke. What was not yet in shards was crushed under the horse's hooves.
“Wha’ ifff”, Ron gulped and took an in contrast to his crude eating habits delicate sip of pumpkin juice. “What if you ‘accidentally’ push Malfoy a tiiiiny little bit, so you have to hold hands again?”
The man gave Draco a lascivious grin and demanded, "Take your clothes off!"
“What did I do?” Neville cried out and rubbed his chest defensively. Harry took a seat at the table in the Hogwarts greenhouses where his other Gryffindor friends were already gathered for Neville’s stag-tea party.
While they carried the food through the castle, the prince marveled at the decorated corridors. Festive music emanated from the banquet hall and colorful, richly dressed nobles decorated the dance floor.
“There, there. Good boy.” Harry said and before Draco could protest, carried him to the fireplace. Quickly he threw the floo powder and shouted “The Burrow!” while holding Draco close.
Draco smiled invitingly at the two men and asked "Would the gentlemen like to buy some plates or cups?”
Draco could not resist the pleading look from the bright green eyes. "All right. I'll kiss you if you'll teach me something."
The day was long. But one time the lamentations will end. And because the prince was so naked and the beggar had to come home soon, he looked for a way to cover his body. He found an old blanket of rough, hard cloth and dressed himself with it.
Full of self-confidence he had promised Potter this morning to sell everything. Now most of the merchandise was destroyed. Draco had sold quite a bit, but he felt like he was empty-handed. All his work, and that of the beggar, had simply crumbled to dust.
Harold never got the chance to speak to Draco. But when he heard, that King Lucius was searching a befitting husband for his son, Harold saw his opportunity of wooing the angelic prince.
“Oh, I didn’t notice.”
Draco very carefully handed him the old clothes through a crack in the door and now he had nothing on anymore.
A great feast was announced. Not only in the castle, but also in the whole city was to be celebrated. Everyone was invited. And so, kings, dukes and noblemen from all countries streamed in to congratulate the Gryffindor king.
Buffled Harry gaped at the snake tattoo that was wrapped around Dracos left arm protectively, shaking its head threatening.
Shit, I already felt the pleasure pooling, ready to explode. Draco noticed my thrusts becoming erratic and hissed “Don’t you dare stop, Potter. I’m so fucking close.” He slung his arms around my neck and bit my shoulder. I thrust frantically, desperate not to come.
“Gosh, Draco, sweet, sweet darling. Aren’t you a sight to behold! I knew the dress is made for you!” Blaise giggled and held his stomach.
Draco had already experienced many festivities in his father's castle. But he had never seen such splendor and could not help but marvel.
Suddenly wide awake, he wrenched his eyes open. Fuck, what time was it? They had to pick up Teddy from Andromedas, to get the adoption settled.
“Don’t you look absolutely dazzling”, Pansy greeted, taking Dracos disheveled state in.
Wait, his bum felt very warm and there was a certain pressure. “Are you groping my ass?” Draco asked incredulously.
Draco paled at the accusations, but there was a glint of something in his eyes. “Now rephrase it” he urged Harry in a soft tone, Harry never heard before.
Annoyed Draco replied, “Seems like a Potter-look-alike to me.”
Noticing the other approaching, the blond looked up and his pink lips quirked up slightly.
“My, all the fucking last night and you still don’t have enough? You’re insatiable, dear” Potter grinned and fucking winked at Draco. The blonde flushed a bright red. He was going to hex him. Fuck all those muggles around him, he would hex the living daylights out of Potter.
Days and weeks passed. The king was on the lookout for a beggar. But no one came.
“So, what. Am I supposed to give in, then, oh almighty Chosen One?” Malfoy spat angrily.
“Kissed?”, the prince huffed. “Hah, he stabbed me with his pointy chin. I will have bruises on my face. Where did you get such a pointed chin? Such a chin, that should be forbidden.”
Later at the feast the royal couple performed their first wedding dance. Harry spun Draco across the dance floor so that the beautiful dresses Draco was now wearing were whirling in a storm of white and gold.
“He is a little spoilt, I give you that. But that’s nothing he can’t grow out of. When we`re married I will teach him how to handle the personal properly, don’t worry. And I can wait. I don’t have a sense of fashion whatsoever, but I respect that Draco is a man of taste.“
Harry mouthed “Gladly” and grinned, when Malfoys face turned red.
Harry gulped. Then he walked towards the sitting boy determinedly.
Granger narrowed her eyes at Draco but nodded. She huffed indignantly and Draco knew he had won the argument. Granger would never be accused of discriminating against others.
When Harry saw the treacle tart, he was overcome with nostalgia. It looked just like Draco used to make it. Oh, Draco, his sweet prince. Harry missed him terribly. Would he never see him again?
When she finally let go, she said, “Let me tell you, what I have in mind for the club. Firstly, we will be symbols of peace and love. So no violence! That means no violence in acts and no violence in communication! Is that clear?” She looked at them both sternly. They nodded obediently.
Shit, Draco couldn’t say no to that puppy look. And he had to make amends! So if Luna wanted him as a friend, then dammit, he would be the best friend there is. Even if it means to “spread love”. Draco shivered. “Alright, Luna. I’m in.”
Harry seemed to consider this, undoubtedly remembering how scary an angry Hermione and Ginny could be. “I’d very much like to decline this most tempting offer, but I also want to get my soulmate back in one piece. So, I guess I have to use that Gryffindor courage of mine and be your saviour.”
After he had returned to the castle in a rage, he had worked off his frustration in sword fights with his soldiers. Only when the supreme captain poured a bucket of ice cold water over his face did his anger evaporate with surprise.
“Uhm, uh. I guess, yes.” I answered very eloquently.
He entered the classroom and sighed. Hermione Granger was already there, parchment and quill ready to take notes. No surprise there. Well, another person Draco wanted to make amends with, so two birds with one stone, he guessed.
Hermione swished her wand and a big banner with the title “INTERVENTION” unfolded itself above the hearth.
Draco discovered his love for cooking and with the book the beggar brought him one day, he improved his skills more and more. He enjoyed trying his hand in the kitchen. Especially the different reactions of amazement and admiration, which the beggar showed him with every new dish, pleased the prince.
“Oh, but he did.” Harry grinned. Then his expression got serious. “Your father really loves you, Draco. He was so sad, you wouldn’t get your own family, when you stay married to me.” Harry grasped Dracos hand and squeezed it. “I told Lucius about Teddy, my godson. He is your cousin, you know? He’s the grandson of your aunt Andromeda. I planned on adopting him, when I got more stability in my life. If our relationship holds, we could be a family together. Teddy won’t be a child of your own, but he shares your blood.”
Harry looked at his friend seriously. "He's in the little hut where we used to hide from Voldemort. I want to let him live in poverty for a while longer, then he'll forget his bad habits. As a prince he was too much pampered. The way he is now, he does not make a good partner for me. But I want to give him a chance. I love him very much."
Ron and Harry met up with Hermione in the library. Hermione was hidden behind a stack of books, murmuring softly “Marshall B. Rosenberg, what a nice guy” and making notes.
When the Gryffindor couldn’t get a reaction out of the Slytherin he changed tactics and took his potions homework out. Potter read it to Draco, who started every time Potter read false information aloud. Salazar, Potter was horrendous at potions. Draco flinched so often he was afraid he took permanent damage.
“Sorry, that’s not possible. My husband has to stay very close to me most of the time in the beginning of the bond. So, you can’t have him.” Harry said sternly and grabbed onto Dracos other arm.
Then she distributed more badges amongst the scarce club members. On the badge was a picture showing two figures fighting each other. Then they changed, shaking hands and smiling at each other while a heart popped up above them, reading “make love, not war”. If Harry squinted and turned his head just a bit, the figures almost looked like him and Malfoy.
Breaking free from his state of shock, Draco fell to his knees in front of the ruins. How could this happen? What could he do now? What would the beggar say?
I just shrugged. Cause really, I don't even care if he’s gonna be the death of me.
“Maybe you could accompany me to the manor, but wait for me outside?” Draco suggested.
“Relax, Draco”, Potter stopped Dracos hand from removing his wand from its holster. “It’s all in good fun, no? We’re married for a couple of hours, so what?”
“Draco”, Harry said softly. Draco shook his head. He felt fingers gently prying his hands off his face. He looked at the floor. “Draco, look at me, please.”
“Oh, please call me Luna. Any friend of Harrys is a friend of mine”, she said, solemnly smiling.
“What was it about? Did they make you realize your undying love for me?” Draco joked and his smirk stretched wider into a cheeky grin.
When they sat in the living room, Draco was too nervous again. Where should he even begin?
“I hate that I love you so much. It hurts.” Draco whispered, voice cracking.
Luna came very close to his face. “Your lips are a bit chapped, Draco. Here, have my lip balm. It’s cherry” she said cheerfully before getting up and leaving him to his own devices.
“It’s very delicious, Mrs. Weasley” Draco said shyly. “And I have to apologize for my behavior towards your fam–hmpf.” Molly had shoved another pastry in his mouth and smiled warmly. “Let bygones be bygones, you were just a boy. And please, call me Molly. Well then, I’m going back into the kitchen, there’s much to do. Ronald, behave!”
“Relax, it’s going to be fine.” Harry ruffled through Dracos hair affectionately when the door opened to reveal a middle aged woman with wild brown locks and a little boy with turquoise hair at her hip.
„Yeah, he beats you there. Finally one thing you’re not first place at“, the blonde Slytherin grinned amused.
“Dear Prince – hoho –, I heard of your beauty and offer you a joyful life by my side. My servants in the courtyard are loading a huuuundred barrels of the most wonderful wine into your father's cellar. Hehe.”
She looked Harry up and down. “Marriage suits you. Just look at you, all well groomed.”
Quickly one after another fled the castle. Such when Draco returned to the hall a little out of breath from chasing a Count named Creevey with a young childish face all around the castle in a game of tag while constantly throwing insults, only three candidates remained.
At least he was in his own hotel room judging by the suitcases and scattered clothes. Finding his wand, he conjured his Patronus and send it to Blaise, so he would come and rescue him with hangover potion and disposing of the man in his bed.
Harry laughed and gave his Draco a kiss.
“Well, I think, you two look really good together, whatever your relationship is”, Luna winked at them, then took a bite of pudding and sighed contentedly.
Draco didn't even notice he was crying until a gentle hand wiped a tear from his cheek. He looked up and saw Luna kneeling before him with a sad, dreamy look.
Confused Draco looked at Harry, “The what?”
Shit, he was crying uncontrollably now. It was clear from the start that Draco could not have a happy end, because he did not deserve it. He should have known better. “Merlin, I was so stupid for hoping I could have a family, with Harry and Teddy. I was so happy, you all welcomed me and I found a home here, too. But I knew I would never fit right in. You’re all better off, without me.”
“Well, Father, here we go. Did you find some more foolish people to marry me?” Before Lucius could answer Draco rushed the next words out haughtily.
“Let’s start our meeting!” Luna exclaimed. “Remember, we’re all being friends here, so please call everybody by their first names. I would like to greet our newest member: welcome Harry!” Luna clapped her hands in applause.
“Definitely. Scared, Malfoy?” Potter smirked.
“Wow. Look at you!” Potter whistled in appreciation. “Aren’t you sugar and spice and everything nice?”
