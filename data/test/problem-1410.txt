Draco decided that he would make the most of having Teddy this weekend because he wasn’t sure when he would get the opportunity to do it again. He’d take him for ice cream at Fortescue’s and he’d let him get whatever he wanted at Quality Quidditch Supplies. Fuck the rules, if his son wanted a broom in his first year, he’d have a damn broom. Draco would just be careful to make sure he didn’t boast about it. He was sure Teddy would be sorted into Hufflepuff; he was so kind and giving and loyal there was no way he would ever hurt a fly. Draco found he didn’t much care what house Teddy was in, so long as he was happy. He was sure Harry had already talked to him about that, but if Teddy brought it up at any point over the weekend, he’d make sure he knew that Draco would love him no matter what happened.
‘Me? Why? What did she tell you? Wouldn’t tell me a thing no matter how much I asked her. She’s been driving me around the bloody bend.’
‘Draco, I’m your friend here. I’m asking you because you’re the most skilled potioneer I know. You also come highly recommended by people I happen to trust with my life. You don’t have to take the opportunity, and I will not blame you if you choose to turn me down, but I’m offering the contract to you first and foremost.’ Draco was gobsmacked. Someone at the Ministry recommended him? He could hardly believe it. Who would stick their neck out for him? Harry certainly wouldn’t. Not any more at least. Was there someone in the auror department he didn’t know he knows?
‘I’ll figure something out. I’ll- I’ll- offer him money or something. That’s what people do isn’t it?’ Draco bit back a soft smile. Harry was so honest he didn’t even know how to bribe someone.
“I’m uh- I’m not sure that’s a good idea right now.” He glanced at the clock on the wall, “it’s half past four in the morning.”
“Is there something on my face?” She said suddenly, putting down her tea and smoothing her hands over her cheeks and forehead. He almost laughed at the rare display of insecurity, but he refrained.
‘No.’ He pulled him off him. ‘You can have all the hugs in the world, if that’s what you want, but you have to tell me first.’ Teddy pouted but nodded.
Twenty minutes later he’d calmed himself down enough to resume his work. He refused to leave his office for the rest of the day, but it worked out quite well because he ended up collecting the evidence he needed to prove the pills Harry received from the clinic fit his theory on the cause of the magic core separation. He sent the results off to Macmillan, since he’d be avoiding dealing with Harry as much as possible in the future. When he went home that night, he sent an owl to Pansy asking if there was any possibility that she could get a last minute international floo. He didn’t think he’d make it through this week without some moral support.
A startled movement next to his bed drew his attention to the rest of the room. Regulus’ room was the kind of tidy only accomplished in a room that was no longer lived in. Books were aligned perfectly on the shelf opposite him. All the drawers were properly closed and there wasn’t a single thing out of place on the dusty surfaces or scattered on the floor except for a thick hardback book which was faced downwards on the bare floorboards. It seemed Lyra had stayed with him after he was moved; she was sitting in an armchair positioned next to his bed, her eyes wide with fear, until she realised it had been Aspen making the racket. Her shoulders slumped and she reached down to pick up the book she must have dropped in her shock.
They didn’t stay at the chateau long – Blaise had always been too fidgety to stay in one place, he thrived in the bustling streets of the city. Draco had always thought he would be like that but since he’d settled with Harry he’d realised he needed the peace a lot more than he cared to admit. It had suited them well, since Harry had always been running from the next press scandal. Come to think of it, they’d spent most of their marriage running from something or other.
‘Where do you think he gets his intensity from?’ Harry smirked at him over his shoulder as he opened a cabinet on the far wall. A compromise. Harry had wanted a television in their bedroom and Draco thought that would be the beginning of the end. They got the television of course, Draco could never say no to Harry, but he made him install it so it could be hidden as much as possible. He could only stand there staring like an idiot.
What Draco had failed to remember was, that occasionally if one was to apparate close to the end of the dosage of a potion, such as Polyjuice, it could sometimes trigger a reaction. So, when he and Harry landed in the office, Draco was no longer accompanying the smarmy git from HR, but the heroic git that is Harry Potter. Without thinking about it twice, which with hindsight is what Draco really should’ve done, he grabbed Harry by the collar, shoved him against his office wall, and kissed him.
“P-Potter! What the hell are you doing here?!” It was disappointing that the serenity was gone, but Harry sort of liked the fierceness in her grey eyes as she glared at him. It also felt like some kind of spell had broken, although there was none involved but the weather jar. Having Malfoy stare at him in irritation reminded him that this was
before he got his call. It was completely illegal considering they hadn’t actually charged him with anything, but as an ex Death Eater it would hardly make any difference even if he did complain. Which he couldn’t do from a holding cell anyway.
Really, he should’ve gone back to work, but he didn’t feel like it and it wasn’t as if they could fire him. Without his potions genius, the business would’ve folded a long time ago. He was surprised to get a floo call from the Ministry though.
The real world was a nasty shock to Draco’s system. The smell of the hospital hit him first, although he daren’t open his eyes. He’d spent enough time in St Mungo’s over the years to know when he was in hospital. Harry had been there so often he even had his own bed. Funny that the tables had turned again. He had an odd kind of feeling that was like he was running through water – he assumed that must be potions in his bloodstream. Why did he always have to be on potions? He lay there for a long while, waiting for the feeling to return to his body.
Draco made a point to go to Hermione’s office just before their regular lunchtime catch-up that day. He wanted to go somewhere outside the Ministry so that he could talk to her in relative privacy.
‘A-a- a what? You’ve got to be kidding me. Draco, why didn’t you tell me? They shouldn’t even have put you on trial. The ruling doesn’t stand if the council weren’t aware of your medical history.’ Harry became frantic, as if the ruling from the bloody Wizengamot bothered Draco now, it was a decade ago.
Harry was surprised at first, but after a few seconds returned the kiss as though he needed the air from Draco’s lungs to breathe. His fingers skimmed up Draco’s sides with such a featherlight touch that Draco's skin tingled in their wake. Heat radiated through his body from where their lips touched all the way to his toes and he wondered why people didn’t live like this. It was euphoric.
‘And can I assume,’ he began slowly, ‘that my involvement in this case can be taken as reassurance that I’m not a suspect?’ He hated how much he sounded like his father, but he was not about to play games.
Two things happened immediately after Draco regained consciousness. First, he sneezed. It appeared his nighttime foray into the grounds during the storm really had cost him dearly. Second, and as a result of the sneeze, he became aware of a rather large lump on his forehead, presumably due to his head hitting the ground. He could feel the lump but couldn’t touch it. It was then he understood that his hands were tied.
‘Thank you for coming to get me, and for letting me put the star on the tree. I love you.’ Teddy slipped under his bed covers.
‘Have you changed your mind about talking to me about Harry?’ Smith asked him ten minutes in. He’d been told if he walked out of another session before his hour was up, he’d be going back to the ward and would not be allowed to leave until his next healer appointment.
“Yes, I can do that. I’m not an idiot.” He snapped. He didn’t actually know for sure that his plan for escape would work – he was making an educated guess based on his existing knowledge of property magic.
‘I see.’ He choked. He snatched up the half-destroyed paper and turned to leave. The air was thick, and his head spun with hurt and confusion. Had he really just been a charity case these past couple of months? He’d thought they’d been adjusting as well as possible considering the circumstances…
Two hours later and Harry is about to lose his mind. Malfoy has given him the few English volumes that he thinks are relevant, but even those are heavy reading and some of them are in such old English that they may as well be French, or, in the case of one in particular dedication to disembowelling curses, German.
‘It seems they found out you were on the case somehow. Turns out they were trying to find a way to kill off muggleborns without there being any direct contact involved between the neo-Death Eater movement and the general populous. You moved right into the area of their supplier and suddenly you take ill with the worst case ever? Not a coincidence.’
‘You’re right, I’m sorry.’ Harry took a step back and Draco lowered his wand. The Ministry was beginning to fill with people and they didn’t have the privacy Harry apparently wanted. He motioned Draco into an empty conference room and Draco didn’t have the energy to argue.
‘You said eat. I’m eating. What do you want from me?’ Harry’s lips twitched into an almost smile and Draco knew he’d won. They said nothing as Draco forced each mouthful down his throat, his body tightening with worry as the minutes ticked by. He could show Harry around, tell him all about the history of the place and everything he’d done here. Except it would be pointless, wouldn’t it? The whole time he’d only be thinking of everything they had to talk about, everything that needed fixing.
‘Look at me.’ Draco’s lifted his gaze. He wished he knew how Harry’s eyes could always burn with intensity. It was like nothing else he’d ever seen. ‘I’ve known you had that mark. I saw it myself. Every one of our friends knows you took the mark and we all care about you anyway. It might go away again, we don’t know. What we do know is that you’re a good person with or without it. Ok?’ He removed his hand and with it the last of the bandage slipped. He’d known what it would look like, but it still took the breath from his lungs to see the ugly black snake coiled on his inner arm once again. It was unmoving, thankfully, but it also had the inky vein markings around it that had appeared on his chest.
‘Don’t panic, this isn’t what you think.’ He passed Draco the box which he opened with trembling fingers. Inside was silver ring with an engraving on it. He looked incredulously between Harry and the jewellery. ‘I’m not asking you to remarry me if that’s what you’re thinking. I just thought- well, it’s been a horrible year and all, but it brought us back together and I want you to know how much it means to me that you’re still here. I know it’s only been a couple of months, but I never stopped loving you and well, I wanted to give you something to say I’m glad we’re starting anew. Maybe this time will be even better than the last…’ Draco was blown away. A single tear fell from his face but once it dropped it was like a waterfall. Twice in one day too – honestly, becoming a Potter was a nightmare. What happened to his cold Malfoy façade?
He picked up the vial of Polyjuice he had left on the table and trying not to think about the colour, downed it in one. Despite the number of times he had brewed it, he had never actually drunk it. It tasted like burnt caramel. A burning sensation radiated out from his stomach towards his fingers and toes as if he’d just swallowed acid. He fell to his hands and knees as his skin bubbled and shifted. His hands thickened in front of his face; his fingers shorter and hairier. His centre of gravity shifted – this muggle must have been a good few inches shorter than him. Presumably less conspicuous because of it.
‘I think this is the best birthday party I’ve ever thrown.’ Harry said with a beautiful grin. He showed Ron and Hermione to the floo, as if they didn’t know where it was already, and disappeared out of view. Draco knew he should be heading off soon, but he didn’t really want to disturb Teddy too much.
There was a pause after he’d finished, and he watched Pansy slowly absorb the information he’d overloaded her with.
‘Hello stranger.’ He hugged Teddy as close as he could, memorising what it felt like to be with his family, his whole family. He looked up at Harry who was looking at them with tears in his eyes. It had been a tough few months for all of them, but something as simple as standing in a room together somehow made it better. After a few seconds, Draco realised Teddy’s shoulders were shaking underneath his hold.
Helen wasn’t in yet and Draco was silently grateful since it took a lot of energy to maintain civility around her. Especially when her default tone had become so overly professional with him. He’d just finished his last batch of scrambled eggs when a flash of dark curls appeared in the corner of his eye and made him grin.
He apparated to the doorstep of the house and knocked on her door. He cast a cooling charm quickly since it was a scorching hot day and even in the few seconds standing with his back to the sun he was feeling it. The downside to having a pasty complexion. He wasn’t waiting long when the door opened, and his heart sunk in his chest.
In his heart he knew the responsible thing would be to turn the fox over to the Ministry. It was impossible for him to know where it came from or what it was capable of, and he certainly didn’t have the skill to look after it.
It seemed to be going well. There was actually a flicker of hope inside him that he hadn’t messed the whole thing up – at least, not to an unsalvageable extent, but there was something about that Latin phrase that was putting him off.
It seemed Harry could feel Draco’s hand skimming lightly through his hair because he unconsciously pulled Draco closer and nuzzled his face into Draco’s neck just like he had when they were married. Draco’s heart was ready to explode with need and want, but then the spell was broken.
“Some people do,” Harry concedes, “but you can add your name separately, so lots of people choose something that matches what they want to post about. Maybe you can think of something bookish?” He suggests. Draco bites his lip and frowns in concentration as he thinks about this. His father always taught him that branding is everything, so it’s very important to get this right.
‘Of course.’ He said with a fake air of nonchalance before smirking at him. ‘Now, do you want to tap the bricks?’
He knew he shouldn’t. He really didn’t care, but he found himself turning to page six anyway. He dropped the other copies on the floor when he saw the host of photographs someone had taken. In the first one it looked as though they were holding hands, but it was also a wintery day and half the crowd was huddled against the cold so it could easily have been the angle. Draco knew how clever those photographers could be when they wanted to. The second photo was glaringly obvious. A piece of Harry’s hair had flopped down over his face as it was wont to do – much to Draco’s annoyance – and Wood was pushing it back off his face, obviously using it as an excuse to run his fingers through his hair. The final one, the one which had Draco’s heart beating at a hundred miles an hour, was of the two of them with their heads bent closely together, almost as if…no. They couldn’t be. Draco wouldn’t be duped by that bullcrap.
“Draco, darling, I know you’re taking this hard, but has it occurred to you that maybe Potter doesn’t
Draco was blown away. He knew the decision had been unfair, but once the goblins made their choice, no force on earth could usually sway them. Included in the envelope, were the deeds to the Malfoy property in France. Draco hadn’t realised that his father had already transferred ownership to Draco by the time of his arrest. Of course, Draco shouldn’t have been surprised – Lucius had always been ruthless and calculating when it came to the Malfoy Estate. Vault 726 was the vault his father had set up for him when he was a child. It was customary in pureblood families to do so as although Draco was already set to inherit the Estate as the sole heir, it was assumed that the money would be used to keep his bride until such time that it was necessary for him to take over.
“I don’t know what you mean,” she said slowly. He turned to find her staring blankly at the tapestry, he fixed his eyes on the fall of her blonde curls.
His arms shook had he lent against the bathroom sink. He stared at his face in the mirror, noticing only the bags under his eyes and the grey pallor of his skin. He was getting thinner by the day, his bones protruding sickeningly. He thought of the bruise he had on his hipbone from when he’d accidently walked into the table in potions – it had felt like someone had snapped the bone in half. His lip trembled as he held back a sob. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t kill Dumbledore. The man was batshit crazy, but he didn’t deserve to be murdered. But what would happen if he didn’t do it? The Dark Lord, he was going to kill his family. His mother. The only person who ever loved him for who he was, not what he should be.
‘Mother?’ He asked disbelievingly. Even his voice sounded as if it was underwater; muffled and warped and it completely contrasted with the fire in his veins. The figure turned, and Draco realised that it was indeed his mother. She was foggy and not totally in focus, but she was there, and just like that he remembered.
He was in a narrow hallway in pitch darkness although he could see perfectly well. He couldn’t remember how he got there, but he let his instinct guide him. He sniffed around the room, picking up the smell of oak from the floorboards and something more man-made; sweet and aromatic like vanilla and star anise. The room wasn’t familiar at all, but he recognised the scent faintly, as if he had smelled it before but never understood what it was. There was a door to his left, and he tried to stand up and grapple with the handle, but he hadn’t yet mastered the lack of opposable thumbs. When he couldn’t get the door open the regular way, he started scratching at the edges, hoping it wasn’t pushed closed properly and he could nudge it. The door creaked open slowly and for a split second, Draco thought he had been successful, but then a figure appeared on the other side. He yelped in surprise and scrambled away, his paws slipping against the smooth surface.
“Ron?” Harry called through the door. There was no sound even as Harry pressed his ear firmly against the white-painted wood to listen. He knocked loudly for good measure but quite frankly he had more pressing issues than forcing Ron out of bed. It was the weekend after all.
“Yeah, well, I’m sure as hell regretting it now!” He snapped back. Putting his phone back in his pocket, he took his wand out and, checking around to make sure no one would see, which they wouldn’t because they were in the middle of nowhere, he conjured a patronus asking Hermione to send them help. As soon as he had done so he ushered both of them back into the car and out of the rain. Draco was shivering as he slid back into the driver’s seat, his hair matted to his forehead. He looked small and scared and Harry felt terrible for putting him in this position.
The reception area was empty, as was the kitchen and the offices where the social workers came and went. They headed up to the first floor, where they found a few of the children sitting around being very quiet. Draco wasn’t very hopeful that the situation was under control. It must be bad for the staff to have abandoned the other kids in order to help.
‘Draco, did you just perform magic?’ He opened his mouth to say something but snapped it shut a few seconds later when he realised, he had no idea what to say.
He was nervous as he got ready to go to Harry’s. He knew now he was able to apparate in and out, but it didn’t feel quite right to do so. It wasn’t his home anymore and his mother always told him it was rude to apparate into other people’s homes.
What other life was he supposed to have? He couldn’t work anymore, could he? He was only here because he had to be, he didn’t believe for one minute that this child understood anything of what Draco had been through and what’s more, he didn’t think it was relevant to his current issue in any way. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want his magic back. His life was difficult enough already.
“You. You were ill this morning too.” She didn’t pose it as a question, but he knew what she was asking. He was not ill really, or at least he didn’t think he was. Whatever happened in his dream has started something, and he wasn’t sure what was real and what was not. He sat up and turned to face her as if ready to engage in the uncomfortable topic of conversation but instead he changed the subject on her.
‘Thank you, Mr Harry,’ she said timidly. Draco thought she was unbelievably cute, and it struck him how differently she viewed him to Harry. She would never have called him Mr Draco.
The effect was instantaneous. No sooner had his front paws landed in the dirt and he’d swished his tail once, than the world around him began to blur again. He couldn’t exactly explain how, but the settling of his and Granger’s spell had coincided with his first animagus transformation and something had clearly gone awry.
‘Daphne no I couldn’t with all good consciousness let you do this free. It’s Boxing Day for crying out loud.’
Hermione’s office was easy to spot. There was an entire floor of the Ministry dedicated to the Minister’s offices and his advisors, and as his new PA, Hermione’s office was right next door. Draco smiled at the gleaming gold plaque which now read
‘Open the paper and tell me what I saw isn’t real.’ Draco’s voice wavered and Harry went very quiet. He unfolded the paper slowly and turned the pages over as though trying to put off the inevitable. The room was very still, so much so that they would have heard a pin drop. Harry’s face was blank as he stared down at the photographs on an endless loop.
September last year.” Granger’s voice became strained and Draco could see how hard she was trying to keep it together.
coffee shop. Laughing away on their little date. I mean, he can date whoever the heck he wants but does he have to pick someone who looks like the female version of me? And in my favourite place as well? Talk about a kick in the teeth.’ Draco mumbled the last bit. Hermione looked dumbfounded.
He couldn’t look at her. “That doesn’t matter. We’re doing this and we’re doing it today. Like we planned.” She watched him for a long while and he expected her to argue but she didn’t.
‘Damnit Harry!’ Harry’s head snapped up from the papers at Draco’s raised tone. He jerked backwards when he realised how close to him Draco was, as if he hadn’t even noticed him before. It stung.
The weeping branches of the willow obscured them enough from view that Harry felt like they were the only two people in the world, and from here he didn’t have to worry about Draco’s silky white skin burning under the harsh sun.
‘Teddy, you know that just because you’re going to Hogwarts soon, doesn’t mean that you can’t talk to me all the time. We’re all just an owl away. Harry will love sending you owls, he never got very many when he was at school.’ Draco remembered how Harry’s eyes would light up whenever he got an owl. Of course, Draco had hated him back then and he was obviously only watching him to make sure his mail wasn’t plotting Draco’s demise.
‘There isn’t much we can do for you at the minute I’m afraid, your recovery will mainly be a lot of rest to restore your magic levels. I need to do a few tests now that you’re awake and once I’ve got the results through I can come back and discuss what happened. Is that ok?’ Draco nodded again, not in the mood for talking all that much. Lockhart-a-like gave him another blinding smile and started waving his wand in some quite ludicrous movements. Draco wasn’t sure if he really was that incompetent or whether he was just trying to show off to him.
Harry kept quiet because he didn’t know anything about such things. He briefly wondered whether his grandparents had ever had one like it, being purebloods. They wouldn’t have burned his dad out for marrying his mum though. They took Sirius in all those years ago after all.
‘Does it feel too fast? We’ve known each other since we were eleven.’ Harry regarded Draco carefully and he tried his best not to give away how scared he was of making another big mistake. Harry couldn’t be a mistake though, could he? Draco loved him with all his heart.
She turned the top page over to reveal a page full of snippets of transcripts with long sections redacted. “They have nothing on you, you know.”
He was glad to step inside, the icy winter air finally shielded from him. He had paper fine skin after all, which his wrinkled frequently reminded him. He anxiously pressed at the corner of his eye as if he could smooth the skin back to how it had been when he was twenty-one and hadn’t even heard of moisturiser.
Harry was still awake when he stirred again, as he’d half expected. They were still wrapped around each other as they had been when Draco fell asleep which was odd since he usually woke up as far away from Harry as possible. Harry was running his fingers gently over his spine and he really didn’t want to move. He lifted his head slightly so that it rested in the crook of Harry’s neck. He briefly wondered, if it all really were to go to pot, if it would be weird if he started wearing the same scent.
‘Yes, he did. I think you should go. I have some time off from work so if you want to I’ll stay, and we can go together. Luna will be there too, and Granger. You won’t be alone.’
‘Oh for heaven’s sake Pots, you know he hates surprises. Stop tormenting the poor bugger.’ Draco’s head snapped towards the far corner of the living room where Pansy was perched against one of the side tables. He’d been so busy staring at Harry he hadn’t even noticed her.
He slipped the ring on, the cold metal stinging his finger just a bit, and he hauled himself into bed, fully clothed. He fell asleep dreaming of jet black hair and green eyes.
Harry to know? There had definitely been a moment at the open mic that Harry couldn’t explain, but Malfoy didn’t seem to want to talk about it, or even acknowledge it for that matter.
He cleared his throat and stepped in front of her, effectively putting an end to their conversation. He placed his palm flat against the intricate designs and felt the thrum of magic beneath the surface. Since taking over from his father, Draco had discovered many hidden corridors and rooms around the Manor that he hadn’t known about before. It certainly explained how his father had always seems to know when Draco had misbehaved, and why
The door clanged open, making him jump. Harry was staring at him, his expression cautious, as though approaching a spooked horse. He hated it when he looked at him like that. He nearly always did it now, like Draco was fragile. He wasn’t fragile, he just destroyed the room without even trying. Except it was accidental magic – random, uncontrollable. It was like being a child all over again. Not that he’d ever had bouts of accidental magic even then, his father wouldn’t allow it.
‘Really Granger? You’re going to complain about your relationship with Potter to me?’ Hermione looked at him sheepishly.
“Yes. But not just sunlight. All light.” Harry qualifies. “And electrical!” Although it’s unlikely anything in this library will mention electricity.
‘Keep it simple. Something that’s second nature. Don’t draw too much power. Even if it is back, you haven’t used it in a long time, and it might be unpredictable.’ Harry was always so cool in a crisis. Draco envied him that.
‘I think this rose window is my favourite,’ he mused as they stood beneath the South window. There were three rose windows in the cathedral – one of which was half covered by the organ – a shame, but it wasn’t Draco favourite anyway.
Harry never caught the look on Sirius’ face, because it occurred to him in that moment to search the tapestry for something else. He looked back at Narcissa and followed the silvery branches one more time, but instead of thinking of Lyra, he thought of the man in the arch who looked just like her.
“Can I help you?” He asked when the man continued to stare at him through the bars. His vicious smile faltered a little, but he didn’t rise to Draco’s bait.
“He’s definitely not an animagus!” Luna giggled. Both the fox and Harry were much less amused, and the fox leaped into Harry’s arms so fast he barely had time to catch him. Harry’s heart was almost fit to burst. He had never really had a pet before, except when Sirius was in his dog form, and he couldn’t believe how much he had missed.
As Harry spoke, he couldn’t help but notice a slight tremor in Sirius’ hands. It added to his feeling that something was off. He had already checked that he hadn’t forgotten Sirius’ birthday, but that was definitely November.
‘I promise nothing ever happened with Teddy. I’m just on edge because he went to Hogwarts. He doesn’t know a thing I swear. Please don’t take him from me.’
‘Don’t be sorry. We’ll get through it.’ He felt heavy in Harry’s arms, but he didn’t want to fall asleep, there were things he wanted to say, things he wanted to do. He’d barely done a thing all day, he didn’t have the right to be tired.
“Failsafe,” Granger said in a low voice, “stops you getting out once you’re in. There’s no way of knowing which door will be the right one, but I’ll know it when I see it.” Draco’s stomach plummeted to the floor. He had imagined this would be much easier than this.
‘Well yes, quite. That’s why everyone at the practice had had their licences revoked.’ Harry said smugly. ‘I don’t know the particulars since I’d left before they’d cracked it, but it turns out they got them on the money trail. They didn’t cover up their tracks very well and there was a clear money exchange all the way from the clinic back to the supplier. Turns out they weren’t the brains of Britain.’
‘Daddy…’ Teddy turned back towards them with the wand gripped tightly in his hand. ‘I already have a wand?’
‘No. It’s fine. You were right to tell me.’ He said, although it didn’t really sound like his own voice.
Harry stood in the middle of the kitchen; his eyes glued to the jut of Malfoy’s hipbone through her thin shirt as she leant against the kitchen table. “Yeah, I know. I actually wanted to see you.” He said, rubbing the back of his neck. Without the buffer of Luna or Aspen, things were stilted between them. Harry desperately wanted to ask her why she went to such pains to stay out of his way whenever he was around, but the room felt claustrophobic as it was, and he didn’t want to make things worse.
“Where are my manners? Let me take your robes.” Malfoy seems overly polite considering he has hated Harry for the better part of two decades, and Harry fails to stifle his laugh as he removes the outer layer he’s required to wear when he goes anywhere on official business.
When he stepped out the front doors, he was hit with a wall of heat completely uncharacteristic of Scotland. There were clusters of students taking shelter around the edges of the courtyard but beyond that the sprawling grass was still relatively quiet. He walked across the sloping green down to the lake and around the edge to the far side. There he sat near a large weeping willow, not to be confused with its whomping cousin. He sat just beyond the reaches of the tree’s branches so that he could feel the sun on his face. Draco wasn’t there yet, so Harry prepared himself to wait.
He didn’t want to appear too eager to know the details, but in truth he was terrified. “Where?” It was difficult to keep his voice steady but he just about managed. Surely, it couldn’t be good news if Potter had been separated from his wand? He could picture green eyes and messy black hair. The honeyed sound of Potter’s laugh echoed in his ears and made his chest ache. He had gone about this all wrong and Potter could be lost to him forever. To them.
‘And you must be my most special client so far. A little birdie told me you’ve never had a haircut before. I have to say, I can’t tell. Your hair is beautiful, just like a princess.’ Ella preened at the praise and did a perfect little twirl, her long curls looking like they belonged in one of those shampoo commercials Draco had seen on the television.
‘What the hell Draco, there are hundreds of these- you know what, never mind. Now isn’t the time.’ He propped Draco up enough that he could down the potion and Draco flopped boneless back onto the bed. He felt the potion run through him and it almost made him feel a little drunk.
Hermione tucked a thick curl behind her ear as she thought about what Draco was saying. She looked particularly well today, purple robes really suited her complexion. Draco would know, he spent hours as a child listening to his mother tell him all about how different cuts and colours suited people in different ways.
He collided with Harry violently, Harry’s arms bracketing him like he knew he wanted to run. He beat against his chest and if he’d had the presence of mind, he’d probably have known he was leaving bruises Harry certainly didn’t deserve.
‘Anytime. Come on then, let’s get you that ice cream. This is going to be your favourite weekend ever.’ Draco said, jumping up with feigned enthusiasm. Teddy’s grin lit up his whole face.
‘Because of all that Oliver Wood drama I saw in the papers. You really don’t know? I’d have thought it would’ve been something you’d talked about if you’re having another go at it…’ It would be Wood, he’d hated seeing that git’s smug face at the quidditch shop. Draco shrugged. He knew first-hand how much rubbish the
When she spoke next her tone was flat and cold. “Don’t say that to be polite, Potter. I don’t need validation from you.”
‘Don’t Harry. You don’t owe me an explanation. You’re entitled to date whoever you want to. If you can’t take Teddy I’ll see if Luna will. It’s not a problem.’ Ugh. Draco hated how cold he sounded.
“Oh, yes. The Ministry were dubious when I first applied for muggle identification so I could enroll, but I constricted a particularly watertight argument about why my studying amongst muggles was actually beneficial not only for their, and my own, reputation, but that it would also do wonders for cooperation efforts.” He scribbles some more notes down and then turns the page delicately with both hands. It amazes Harry that someone usually so bold and dismissive could also be so gentle and careful. It was like seeing a whole other person.
‘Stay there.’ He said sternly and walked out of the room. Draco’s heart rate picked up and his fingers started twitching. He felt like an eleven-year-old boy in detention with Hagrid all over again.
The aspen trees were a long way from the Manor itself but having spent so long beneath them that is where he wanted to be when it finally happened. Covering himself in the best weatherproofing charms he could do with his wand dampened, he ran out into the pouring rain. The cold water pelted at his thin nightwear and although the fat droplets hurt as they made contact with his delicate skin, he was otherwise impervious.
‘You’ll be awake properly now, I should think. Oh Draco, we were all so worried. I tried my best not to bring the kids, but it’s been so long I couldn’t face lying to them. You’ve baffled everyone. It took them weeks to figure out what was wrong.’ She held his hand tightly and brushed the hair back from his face.
forget to take your Polyjuice before you leave. I don’t need you popping up in the Ministry like a human lumos.” Was that a dig at his hair?
‘Before I- before it happened, I saw my father. It wasn’t really my father, just a ghost of him I guess. When I was unconscious, I saw my mother. She told me that all I had to do was let you in. I don’t think it’s all that simple, but I can’t tell you how much I’ve missed you. I’ve missed you so much even though really, I should hate you. Even after everything, it’s always been you.’ Harry didn’t say anything for a while and Draco thought he’d said too much, but then Harry was lifting his chin, forcing him to look at him.
“Have you told the Weasleys about all of this?” It was a tricky situation. How much could they feasibly say? Granger flushed slightly.
“There isn’t a spell for fixing clutches you idiot! You know magic doesn’t work on muggle tech!” Harry pulled his phone out of his pocket and of course, like every clichéd muggle film he had ever seen, he had no signal. So much for calling a breakdown service.
‘I’m fine.’ His voice was a little choked, but he forced it into some semblance of normality. ‘Go have fun, we can have a nice trip out together tomorrow.’ Harry crossed the distance between them and kissed him fiercely.
‘Whaaaat.’ He heard giggles and he realised Teddy was trying to wake him up. He supposed it was only fair, he still got excited for Christmas. He blinked his eyes open slowly, trying to ignore how much they hurt and found Teddy nearly sitting on top of him, grinning down at him like a lunatic, his hair a vibrant shade of green.
That was where he had seen them before. Aspen, Lyra, and Draco all had the same shade of silver-grey eyes. How had he never noticed that before? His heart was in his throat as four faces loomed above his head and the fox sat whining on his lap. What was supposed to happen now?
‘Draco,’ Pansy started carefully. Draco knew from experience that when Pansy’s voice takes on a soft tone, you’re in trouble. ‘Did you expect him to stay alone forever?’ She asked him gently. That took the wind out of Draco’s sails. He stopped pacing. He felt cold all over, like he’d been drenched in ice water. Pansy said nothing.
“How long do you reckon we have before that patronus gets wherever its going?” Harry could see a devilishness glimmering in Draco’s eyes and for the first time Harry wondered if he might love this impossible man.
“You’re in Azkaban, boy, where you belong.” Suddenly his senses came into sharp focus and Draco realised that everything was so dark because he had just been deposited inside a cell. It shouldn’t have surprised him. In fact, he had predicted this very thing from the beginning, and yet he was still overcome with the urge to cry. Maybe part of him had thought Granger would have been able to pull it off after all.
He turned to Pansy to wait for her judgement. She stood gawping in front of him. “Well…” She paused as if she couldn’t find the right words. “No one’s going to suspect it’s you anyway.” With Pansy being no real help, he strode over to the nearest mirror and got a shock.
‘If you would kindly let go of me, maybe I’ll tell you.’ Draco told him calmly. It seemed Harry hadn’t actually realised he was still pinning Draco to the wall as he shook his head and released his collar. ‘Thanks.’
‘It’s your magic.’ Hermione told him sadly. ‘Children can always feel magic, even if they don’t understand that’s what it is. That’s why muggle children are so willing to believe in witches and fairies and the like. He knows there’s something different about you.’
The Autumn was perishing in Paris. Draco grabbed the thick woollen cloak he’d last used as part of his disguise in that strange London clinic. He jumped as he heard a clatter and he looked down to find the bottle of pills Harry had been given when they’d gone. That was strange, he could’ve sworn he’d checked them in as evidence. He looked at the bottle and noticed some of them were missing, which were probably the ones he’d had sent to the lab for testing. He slipped them back into his robe pocket and made a mental note to owl them to the Ministry the next day after he’d bought himself a new night flying friend. He’d finally decided he had enough money to bother investing in a new owl.
‘Clever? Why?’ He watched Harry unbutton his shirt and put it in the laundry and he tried very hard to remember his train of thought. Harry ran a hand through his hair and Draco watched as his back muscles flexed. He was always confused at how Harry had maintained his muscle mass after he quit the aurors – he never saw him work out.
His steps fell perfectly in sync with Ron’s without him really trying, their boots echoing around the cobbles and around Harry’s head and his ever-building headache.
Happy New Year everyone! This will be my last update of 2018 although for many the new year has already started.
was something that had been drilled into him anyway. There was a reason he’d survived the war and heaven knew it wasn’t anything to do with looking after himself. No, Harry didn’t like it when Draco was out too long without him because Harry wouldn’t be there to protect him. Harry had hoped that by now suspicion over Draco’s affiliations would’ve been less of an exciting topic, but just last month the
‘I was thinking about it and I realised how easy it would be to go too far the other way. It’s important to make sure wizards understand muggle culture, but that doesn’t mean we should forget about wizarding culture too. I thought maybe you’d like to teach them some of the things you were taught when you grew up. Maybe it’s a stupid idea, I don’t even know what growing up in a magical household is even like. I just thought it was something important to you…’ It was, and Draco was blown away by how much thought and care Harry was putting into this. It seemed like he’d finally found a way to save people without putting himself in danger.
‘Will you manage the apparition back? Or do you need longer to calm down?’ Draco didn’t really care. They’d had a great day so far and even if the apparition made him sick, it wouldn’t dampen his mood.
“It will all be alright you know. Granger’s bloody brilliant.” He said to her after she drank three cups of tea and spent five minutes staring down at her plate without eating so much as a morsel.
Granger stared at him like he was an idiot. “Because next time it might be someone who doesn’t deserve it.” She seemed taken aback by her own harshness, but it was true. He would be lying if that didn’t sting a bit, but he sort of did deserve it.
‘What? I needed it ok? The couple who were looking to adopt Ella have withdrawn their application. They’re being relocated to Austria. Ella’s inconsolable and they’ve tried everything to calm her down. She says she only wants you…’ Draco felt a rush of warmth. He had no idea he meant that much to her.
‘You obviously already know why I didn’t change it and why I didn’t tell you Harry, why did you even come here?’ This really was getting ridiculous and Draco was done. He wasn’t going to play along anymore.
“It’s you. And you’re a Slytherin. So yes.” Harry adored it when he got to see the affectionate side of Draco, but he also knew that it didn’t make an appearance without a reason.
By mid-afternoon, his broom brought into the house and placed in the corner of his bedroom ready to be serviced, he forced himself to focus on the task in hand. He therefore found himself seated at his research desk next to Granger and opposite Pansy. He hadn’t asked what had been said between the two of them while he had been in the lab, but whatever it was it seemed to have taken a toll on Pansy. Possibly no one else would have noticed, but Draco had been Pansy’s closest friend since they were four years old, and he could see the tiny make-up smudge under her eye she would never usually let slip, and the slight trembled of her lip she fought to control. She had obviously already cried this morning, and that was not what he wanted for his best friend.
‘Are you sure? How?’ Harry looked as alarmed as Draco felt. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears as the overwhelming feeling that there was something he was forgetting became more and more prominent. He burned with the desire to know, to understand. He vials on the shelf began rattling and he could feel the itch of magic crackling across his skin. This was it, he just knew it.
‘You’ve got to be kidding me. How did you even pull it off?’ Draco asked him before he bit into a cinnamon roll. He held back a moan, knowing it would sound highly inappropriate in front of Teddy. The bar was set incredibly high this year.
Suddenly the crack of light burst open, flooding the darkened hallway with yellow light. Another figure appeared next to the first one. By then Draco’s vision had adjusted to the light and he could see a mop of brilliant red hair. His heart sank.
“I hate to say it,” Ron said sheepishly, “but I agree with Malfoy. You can’t go alone. This place could be anywhere mate.” Lyra made fake gagging noises at the prospect of her and Ron agreeing on anything.
book said that it was important to prepare the mind. This involved trying to envisage what sort of animal he would be, what form he would take, whether it be small, or large, or scaly, or furry. If he could see the vague outline of his form, it would help his body shape itself better. It made sense in theory, but practically it had been useless so far.
‘What happened? Please don’t tell me it was because of me.’ Hermione pushed some hair away from Draco’s forehead and he was surprised by the gentleness of the gesture. He and Hermione had been good friends for a long time, but physical contact beyond the occasional hug was never much of a thing.
‘Oh?’ Harry said without taking his eyes away from the dishes. It was so domestic Draco was thrown back five years to a different time.
“Is it exhausting being so dramatic all the time? Is that why you sleep so much?” Ron asked him. He was lying flat on his back on the picnic blanket with his eyes closed. Harry had thought he was asleep until then. Draco rolled his eyes like he’d heard it a hundred times before. Which he had.
Today however, he was taking a break from his writing to take Teddy shopping in muggle London. Draco liked to avoid Diagon this close to Christmas, but Oxford Street would still be relatively quiet in the middle of the week according to Harry, who said muggle children stayed in school until right before Christmas. Draco thought that was mean, Christmas was about spending time with family and people couldn’t do that if they were at work or school the whole time. He’d already bought presents for everyone except Harry, but he liked to shop with Teddy just to let the kid run wild for a few hours. Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t join them like he sometimes did, but Draco supposed that might work in his favour on this occasion.
‘Mr Potter,’ he found himself correcting automatically. He didn’t really care, but she’d had her face within an inch of his own for the past fifteen minutes and she had the direst case of halitosis Draco had ever had the misfortune of encountering.
His instincts told him this was now or never; he could not let this moment pass. He had always been told to trust his instincts, so he did, and he closed the small gap left between them.
It was like something in his chest exploded that he hadn’t even known was there. It was too much – the worry over Teddy, the stress of his lack of magic, mending things with Harry, the orphanage, Pansy coming back. Something had to give. The explosion was literal as well as metaphorical as the bottles on the shelves expanded, sending shards of glass and pieces of plastic everywhere, their contents soiling his clothes and his hair. Then, the shelves themselves rattled and crashed to the floor. Draco could do nothing but shield himself with his arms, his heart beating wildly in his chest, and wait for the onslaught to end.
‘Do I wish you’d felt like you could come to me? Of course. But honestly, all that matters to me is that you do what’s going to help you. I’ll say it a hundred times if I have to – all I want is for you to be happy.’ Draco needed to tell him how much he meant to him, but he didn’t have the words. Instead, he gripped Harry’s shirt and kissed him. It was a slow kiss, the kind that made Draco feel like he was melting into a pile of feathers. Harry held him with such care that he felt like he was some kind of coveted prize. He released Harry’s shirt and his hands came to rest and the base of his neck, his thumbs pressing lightly on his collarbones. The slight scratch of Harry’s stubble catching his chin was a delicious contrast to the softness of his lips and when he heard Harry's low groan when he pressed against him further, he knew they’d have to stop before he got too distracted.
Just then they heard echoing footsteps behind them. He turned to see a wizard with a long beard and pointed ears strolling towards the door with his robes billowing out behind him. Before he could move Granger was shoving him face first through the door and into the narrow room beyond.
‘Ted, would you mind getting dressed? I need to talk to your aunt for a bit.’ Draco shot Teddy a pointed look. Teddy wandered off to the spare room he usually stayed in where he had a few clothes.
He felt an unfamiliar twist in his chest as he realised that Harry was with someone. A woman. Draco shouldn’t be surprised, but it was easy to forget that Harry was equally as interested in women as he was in men. It felt like an extra twist of the knife lodged in Draco’s chest to think that Harry now hated him so much he was back to dating women.
‘Sorry love.’ Harry pulled the muggle phone out of his pocket and stood up to answer it out of earshot. It clicked as he flipped the screen open and Draco winced. He hated that blasted phone with a passion. If they hadn’t been split when Harry bought it, he would’ve screamed blue murder until he put the damn thing back. He had been contemplating getting Ron to add extra warding to the house so it wouldn’t work when they were home. Harry had bought one so that he’d be contactable by muggle means of course. It made sense, but that didn’t mean Draco had to like it.
He looked up and let out a cry of pain when he saw Harry and the man in a tight embrace, locking lips like there was no one around. Harry’s arms were curled into the back of the man’s coat like he was holding on for dear life.
‘See you at home.’ He doubted Harry had heard him since he’d already started walking away, but he needed space. He didn’t know why, but that morning when he’d woken up, he’d actually thought he might’ve had some good news.
Here he sat and tried to pick apart the wards. He needed to temporarily transfer some of his magic to the house so that it would look as though he was still there. The threads of magic were unbelievably tangled, and it took him a long time to isolate and snap the thread he had been trying to find. This should have been something he tackled during his house arrest, but he really hadn’t thought it would be so bad.
Essentially, Harry knew make up was no more or less an artform that brushes on a canvas, but what Harry couldn’t
‘You’re serious about it? Draco, when I said do something different I meant buy a new flat or get yourself out on a date, I didn’t mean run away.’ Pansy’s tone shifted to something a lot softer, which was so much worse than angry.
‘You know that no one can actually take me away from you, don’t you? I nearly died when you started screaming like that, and I’ve seen a few things…’ He looked troubled and Draco's guilt over having woken him up flared again. Harry had been the one to suffer nightmares at first; Draco’s hadn’t been really bad until after the divorce when…He couldn’t actually remember what he used to have nightmares about.
He drummed his fingers on the countertop nervously. He couldn’t sit still. Harry had only been gone ten minutes and already Draco could explode. He didn’t know if it was more nerves or excitement anymore, it hardly even mattered.
Granger had files scattered across her side of the table, each covered in leather wallets embossed with the logo of the law firm she worked for. They’d sat in awkward silence for the first fifteen minutes and he was yet to figure out what she was doing here. The files had remained closed the whole time.
‘Hey, hey,’ he shushed the crying boy, ‘it’s ok. I’m here, I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be here when you need me, ok?’ He looked over Teddy’s head at Harry who was standing with his hands in his pockets, smiling encouragingly.
‘Of course not.’ He lied. ‘As if I would ever come back here voluntarily.’ He sauntered off to get a drink, it was going to be a long evening. He found Pansy picking up an overly full glass of wine and he prayed this wouldn’t end with her making a fool of herself as she usually did when she drank too much.
The coin was the only thing keeping Draco sane. Draco’s cell was high up in the island prison and would have been streaming with sunlight most of the day if the sun could shine on such a tower of despair. The walls were slick with damp and the air smelled like decay. It was easy enough to understand why people went mad in this place even without the dementors, let alone lack of human contact and poor living conditions.
‘Hm. Really? Sure feel like one to me.’ After a few minutes of pretending to be annoyed, Harry caved and returned to his default – running his hands gently through Draco’s hair.
The war had taken its toll on his mother, but the death of his father had really finished her off. She hadn’t been the same after they’d had the patronus telling them his father had been found dead in his cell in Azkaban. The Ministry made it sound like Lucius had taken his own life in shame, but Narcissa and Draco had known Lucius was far too proud a man to have died in such a way. It would have brought shame to the family, as if he hadn’t already brought enough of that. Still, they hadn’t been in a position to challenge the ruling at the time.
‘I don’t make the rules, love. I tried to tell him, but he wouldn’t listen. You’ll find a way though, won’t you? You’re way more clever than I am.’ He smiled at him, but it was all wrong. His eyes were panicked, and his posture was unsure.
“Fox? Seriously Potter, even you can do better than that.” Malfoy seemed impatient even though it didn’t have anything to do with her.
Granger looked at him like he was losing his mind “As familiar as one can be with the third declension. It’s not a particularly difficult concept.” He couldn’t tell if she thought he was insulting her intelligence or not, but he just wanted to be sure what she was saying.
The day dawned bright and cold and as soon as Draco opened his eyes his stomach filled with jittery nerves. Harry was still asleep next to him and usually Draco would enjoy watching him sleep for a few minutes but today he needed Harry awake to stop him having a meltdown. He knew it was ridiculous for him to be so scared, he should be excited to have Teddy home. Still, he knew it would be a long day for them.
The wand was placed on the ground between them at a safe distance. “So that the two separate parts of the spell don’t interact with each other.” Granger clarified. Draco stepped forward and cleared his throat, praying that his Latin translation was close enough.
“Are you ok?” He asked her. He could see he was making her nervous. She’d started shifting her weight from foot to foot and clenching and unclenching her fists. It wasn’t his intention to make her uncomfortable.
‘YOU CAN’T MOVE TO FRANCE!’ Hermione shouted in Draco’s face. He’d asked her to have lunch with him to tell her about his plans for project
The envelope was much heavier than he expected, although the letter was written on the same thick cream paper that Draco himself used. Used to use. His fingers already left dirty prints over the pages and he realised that this was the kind of dirt he might never be rid of again. It was from a
Draco hated his mind healer with a passion. He didn’t need to “relive his childhood trauma”, he didn’t need to discuss “the issues which led to the breakdown of his marriage”, and he certainly did not want to discuss how he felt about losing his magic. His mind healer didn’t seem to care about any of that.
His mind healer had recommended he write a journal. He said it would help Draco “process the changes in his life” and give himself some” perspective on the events which led him here”. Draco understood the theory, it was just that he felt a bit of a wally writing in a journal, even though Harry had bought him a beautiful dark leather book with the crispest white pages. He’d even invested in a muggle fountain pen and Draco had to admit it made quills look quite antiquated.
“There’s not Draco Malfoy,” she said, her eyes boring into his own, “just me.” She said it in the most un-Malfoy-like way he had ever heard her say anything. With an openness which verged on vulnerability. Suddenly he realised that her standoffishness wasn’t born out of dislike anymore, but fear.
‘Well, it’s common for magic to become a little unsettled after a divorce. Mostly because the bond you forged when you got married linked your magic together. Often it only lasts a few months and isn’t really noticeable, but between you having been a horcrux and Draco taking the dark mark, you two aren’t exactly the common example.’
Malfoy leads him to the back of the house into a large living room. There’s probably a fancy name for it like a parlour, or a drawing room, or something, but Harry’s never got to grips with all of that. It’s a very fancy room with ornately gilded sofas, armchairs, and coffee table, and he’s sure the art on the walls is original. A pang of longing strikes him suddenly. Not for the Manor, but for the history, and the long line of ancestry Malfoy is surrounded by all day that Harry doesn’t and will never have. It must be nice to belong to something as established as that.
The following week, he started his new job at the ministry. Harry had given him his own lab in the bowels of the Ministry. Draco would’ve thought that Harry was being generous in giving him the most state-of-the-art lab money could buy, but he knew there was no coincidence that his lab was as far away from Harry’s office as physically possible.
He’d considered getting rid of his current flat after he moved considering he hated the place, but since he’d paid for it outright, it didn’t make sense to sell it just yet. Yes, it would’ve paid for his settling in in France, but if he kept hold of it he could be back when Teddy was home from school with as little disruption as possible. He hadn’t quite worked out what he was going to do about telling Teddy, but he was sure he’d be able to come up with something.
He eventually picked up the gifts for everyone and as he made his way to the fireplace, his attention was caught by the parchment left on the coffee table. It had writing on it again even though he was sure he had heard Harry explaining to Teddy how to use the map properly as he’d gone upstairs. Since he of course couldn’t ever let anything slide, he paused to read what the words said.
“And I’m sure none of us will be able to sleep until we know what’s going on. You took quite a turn, Harry. I’m not sure you realise…” He looked at Sirius and imagined the same look on his father’s face. Sirius was the closest thing he had to a father, apart perhaps, from Arthur Weasley, and Harry probably owed him the truth.
He spotted Harry and Teddy loading Teddy’s trunk onto the train. He was clutching onto the owl Draco had bought him from Eeyelops which Teddy had named Eltanin because it was the brightest star in the Draco constellation. He’d been ecstatic when Draco had bought him the eagle owl and hadn’t stopped talking about him since. Draco was just glad he’d have a well-bred owl that wouldn’t drop his letters in the river like Draco’s first ever owl had.
‘I’ve gone and done it? All I’ve done is present you with something the whole world has clearly already seen. Do you have anything to say? Or are you going to feign ignorance?’ Harry shook his head.
‘It’s good to see you, Draco. You have a lot of our lunch dates to catch up on. With interest.’ She walked off, presumably to use the floo, he didn’t really know. His mind was racing, filling him with guilt. He was so useless at being a parent, at keeping a family together. No wonder things with Harry so quickly gone off track. He never thought about anyone else.
He’d charmed little orbs of light to float around within. They twinkled against the glass which was also charmed so that one could see out without anyone seeing anything from the outside. The flagstone floor was covered with thick antique rugs and there was a real-wood fire, not currently lit, which was the focal point of the room. He’d had indoor climbers installed which trailed up the glass panels and added a sense of warmth. He hadn’t done much with the place really, only had a couple of well-worn sofas and a bookshelf, but the affects were something else entirely. A person could disappear in here and forget about the entire world around them.
Harry decided to take a quick shower and dress before calling Luna, the one friend he knew would definitely know what he should do. There was always Hagrid, but Harry didn't much feel like having a conversation with Hagrid about what to do with a wild fox, especially since Hagrid didn't have a good track record when it came to taking in strays.
‘Every couple of days or so. More often than not you weren’t very lucid, but you always seemed to know when he was here. Reached right for him every time. Oh, you two are perfect together. You must really love each other.’ Draco nodded, unable to explain how much he’d messed up. Harry had done him wrong though, hadn’t he? He’d slept with another man right under Draco’s nose. He couldn’t even figure out if it was cheating, or if he was just so angry that Harry had never told him. They hadn’t technically been back together, that’s true enough. Yet Harry hadn’t even said. It hurt his head to think about it.
‘Then I hope they’ll all be happy.’ His voice was strained but he held himself together. They had far worse to talk about than that. He could compartmentalise, assess it later.
Now, contrary to popular belief, Harry wasn’t an idiot. He wasn’t under any misguided belief that make up’s only purpose was to make people look pretty or to help them hide themselves. He had seen the way Luna used those magipowders on her eyelids to make each blink look like fluttering butterflies. He’d seen the way Hermione meticulously chose the exact shade of lipstick that would match her outfit because it made her feel organised and powerful; he knew that Dean’s amazing ability to always produce the most symmetrical and precise winged eyeliner was his way of expressing his creative drive.
They stumbled to the man’s room, dropping items of clothing throughout the house as they went, and Draco found he really didn’t give a shit about much else anymore. Why had he gone out in the first place? He really couldn’t remember. All he knew was that this stranger knew all the right things to say and all the right things to do, as if he could read Draco’s mind and it was absolutely thrilling. As they tumbled into bed together, Draco didn’t have a care in the world.
‘Pansy is fitting in well at the Ministry trying to sort of the process for registering orphaned children. It’s complicated magic, but it builds on the same blood magic that works with the magical register and the Hogwarts register, so it should be possible to do the same thing. We don’t know how that’ll work on the muggle side of things, but it’s a start. Erm…I spoke to the board, they’re unconvinced about you teaching. Mainly because it’s well, you. I think they’ll come around though. Oh, and Ella told me to give you a big hug and a kiss and to tell you she’d going to be an angel in the nativity play, so you can’t call her a sausage anymore.’
‘You’re going to be ok, aren’t you? Every time I go to school you get sick…’ He hated that already school had become so synonymous with his magic issues – he’d never wanted that.
Most days after he had left the Ministry, he had come out to the Aspen trees, cleared his mind, and tried to form an image. After he had taken the potion, he had started to feel the pull towards alternative form than he one he inhabited now, but so far he hadn’t figured out what it was.
‘No. I mean both of you are good and bad but you’re useless on your own.’ Draco snorted at the idea that Harry was useless without him. He’d set up a damn orphanage for crying out loud. He appreciated the sentiment though.
“Oh come off it, Granger. You know what I mean. Early modern if you will. There are manuscripts in this room that date back to ninth-century France, the seventeenth is absolutely modern.”
“You don’t want that?” Harry asked, his voice almost breaking. Draco’s eyes flickered from Harry’s eyes to his lips and back again and Harry couldn’t help but lean in just a little closer.
It was a fairly ordinary thing to do – to sit in the kitchen and talk over tea – so why did it feel like Harry was forgetting something very important? As they sat down at the kitchen table, Aspen kept very close to Harry, sitting quietly by his feet, which was very unusual. He even let Harry run his fingers gently between his ears, something Aspen loved but was very particular about.
‘Draco…’ Harry edged towards him, his feat crunching on top of the mess on the floor. He stayed very still, wondering what Harry thought he was going to do.
He was waiting in the reception area of the private wizarding clinic in Harley Street. The whole building was under muggle repellent charms which acted much like disillusionment charms except they didn’t deceive witches and wizards.
As he stood, the icy wind came whistling through his cell, blowing right through his thin clothes and making him shiver, but he didn’t let it stop him. He thought about how it had felt the first time; the low centre of gravity, the ruffle of his fur as he moved, the unusual sensation of having a tail offset by enhanced hearing and sense of smell. He imagined fur the same colour has his hair, maybe a little darker. It wasn’t easy when he still wasn’t entirely sure what animal he had become, but it was working.
‘You’re my daddy and I love you and some people don’t like you and that’s ok because no one has to like everyone, but I do like you and I should tell you more often because that’s what you do when you love people.’ Draco thought he’d been heartbroken when he’d gotten divorced. He was wrong.
“Draco! There you are!” His eyes snapped open. Sensations started coming back to him – the feeling of the sun edging out over the cover of the trees, the birds singing and small animals rustling in the hedgerows. Pansy was marching towards him across the grass with purpose, a look of exasperation on her face.
When Draco stirred the following morning, his warming charms had dropped overnight, and his body temperature potion had worn off. Hermione was already up and dressed and finishing her morning tea, eager to get home. He didn’t blame her; international portkeys were a drain on your magic and she probably missed Hugo and Rose terribly. Draco was the same with Teddy when he was that age.
ago.” If Draco had a wand, he would have hexed her right there and then. But he didn’t. So, he imagined it instead. Whilst that time he made her teeth grow in school was hilarious, now he’d go for something a little more mature – like an instant scalping hex or maybe even
Harry passed Ron’s bedroom on the way to his own room. The door to Ron’s bedroom was still firmly shut; a sign Ron was still sleeping since he was incapable of closing a door behind him when he was awake.
‘I do apologise. I seem to have given you the impression that you have some sort of choice in the matter.’ He strode over to the other side of the room. Draco wondered what he was doing until he spun the desk chair around. Harry had been in the room the whole time and Draco hadn’t even noticed.
Kissing Malfoy was nothing like kissing anyone else. It should have been fierce and energetic like they had always been with each other – competitive like they had always been. But it wasn’t. She tasted like the tea she had been drinking earlier, but there was an aura about her that reminded him of vanilla. Not the overly sweet kind that made your teeth rot, but something spicier. She let him take over, but she gave as good as she got. Before he knew it, his hands were in her hair, unravelling the bun she had wrapped it in and running his hands through those perfect curls he was so obsessed with.
The label on the vial was almost worn off and every time Draco reached for it he reminded himself he needed to make a new one – he never did. He tipped the silvery memory into the bowl and watched it swirl around, waiting for him.
“Lord Malfoy.” Knock-Off Crabbe grunted. “Requested by Head Auror Robards.” Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. To have a warrant out for his arrest authorised by the Head Auror himself was not to be taken lightly. Of course, no one wanted to be the face of the DMLE when that meant taking responsibility for a missing Harry Potter, so Draco presumed the Head Auror was taking a hands-on role. That didn’t bode well.
“Harry, Miss Malfoy,” Remus greeted them politely, as if they weren’t the architects of the entire affair, “it’s nice to see you again. I must apologise for my poor state of dress. Things have been… difficult, these past months.” He spoke slowly, as if he had to think about each word carefully before he said it. Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Lyra jumped in before he could utter a word.
‘My apologies, Mr Potter. I’m going to need to adjust your dosages slightly; you need less Vitamix and more Regeneration…’ she trailed off as she began checking off various different factors she was supposed to monitor during his appointments. He had almost zoned out when he realised what she’d said.
‘Of course, Draco. I designed the contract to make it as flexible for you as possible. The immediate danger appears to have passed and I don’t intend to force you to be here if it will damage your health. All I ask is that you remain until the end of the week while I make some arrangements, can you do that?’ Draco hadn’t felt so much relief in a long time.
Not that he was maudlin. Of course not, he’d never do anything that would make his father even remotely proud of him. Draco surreptitiously pulled his wand down his sleeve and cast a disillusionment charm over himself. Harry and his lady-friend had sat at a table so that Harry was facing the door and there was no way Draco could leave now without being noticed. Disillusionment charms were great, but they couldn’t make a door open and close without anyone noticing. Draco wondered whether Harry told this new woman why he had to face the door. If she knew about the war and how Harry always had to have his main exit in his eyeline in case he had a panic attack.
‘For the love of god Malfoy, why do you have to be so defensive all the time. I’ve left you alone, I’ve made an effort to make sure I give you space, I’ve never once got in the way of you spending time with Teddy.’
“I thought about that, but I also think burning people from a tapestry because they don’t share the same ideals as us is a dangerous route to take. I never got on with my family, and you both know how much of a disappointment I was to my mother, but I want to remember how far we have come since then.” Harry had never really thought about it that way, but he supposed if people forgot why the war happened, there’d be no reason why it couldn’t happen again.
‘I love you too,’ he said with a roll of his eyes and just for effect, reached over to kiss him quickly.
Harry re-arranged them carefully, trying not to hurt him too much, until Draco was cuddled into Harry’s chest. Draco should’ve felt babied by Harry, but there was nothing infantile about this situation. Harry ran his hands gently through Draco’s messy hair and Draco breathed in the familiar scent of Harry – cedar and grapefruit – and clutched onto Harry’s shirt and tightly as he could without the feeling in his fingers.
Now with ice in his chest to match the dull ache in his bones and a numbness in his toes and fingers, he stumbled through to the box room he’d turned into a tiny potions lab to get his daily potion dosage.
‘Sommeliers all over France are weeping right now,’ he said instead. Harry’s hand came to rest on his hip and he almost forgot to be pretentious for a second.
, he was Dumbledore. He knew that the only reason he had ever been able to defeat Voldemort had been Tom Riddle’s resulting miscalculation over the owner of the Elder Wand. If Lyra had never become a Death Eater, she could never have been given that impossible task. She would never have been at the tower that night. She wouldn’t have disarmed Dumbledore. The wand would have been Snape’s…
‘Well, no, not quite,’ Hermione said, flushing, ‘I am going to be his PA, but it’s with a move to…I don’t know how to say this. It’s with a view to becoming the next Minister…’ Draco’s jaw nearly hit the floor.
‘Take some time to think about it. I don’t want you to feel rushed into anything. There’s so much else we have to deal with.’ This was one of the things he loved and hated about Harry. Everything was always
‘Actually, I think I should head home. I have some stuff to do.’ He pulled away from Harry and stood up carefully.
“Obviously everyone is comfortable enough in my home to drop in unannounced,” he gave Pansy the side eye, “but if you don’t mind, the first thing I want to do is shower.” No one tried to argue with him, so he walked right past them and up to the West Wing where his rooms were. After even a couple of days in a cell at the Ministry, the landings of the Manor felt miles long. It was good to stretch his legs.
He pulled away from Lyra too sharply. It was no longer possible to look her in the eye and not see Draco Malfoy in every way. But it didn’t make sense. He was here, right in front of a woman whose name was Malfoy, who he could touch and talk to. Their eyes were locked as if they were about to parley and he didn’t know who would come off worse. There was no mark on her arm. She had not become a Death Eater. His stomach plummeted to the floor.
“I think abandoning the Dark Lord in the middle of the biggest battle the wizarding world has ever seen is probably enough for a hefty singe. Luckily for me there’s no one left to do it.” The casual way in which she said it while leaning one shoulder against the windowpane was at odds with the way the blood froze in Harry’s veins. He shot across the room with such speed that the room span so fast his head might have toppled right off his shoulders.
‘Well, I probably gave Harry quite a shock. He’s very good in a crisis, that’s why he’s Head Auror, but it’s different when he’s not at work, he’s not thinking the same way.’ Draco explained more to himself than to Teddy. Teddy wasn’t convinced – he’s particularly switched on for an eleven-year-old.
He traced the scar lightly with his index finger. Harry was always funny about letting people touch his scar. Teddy had been fascinated by it when he was a baby. Obviously, he didn’t understand what it was or what it meant, he just thought it was a funny shape. Still, Draco had taught Harry that he didn’t have to fear his scar anymore, it was a symbol of survival, not just of Harry but of everyone, and not just because it made him famous.
Draco felt a hell of a lot better about leaving his flat after that. He supposed it was because he had some sort of closure. He could leave knowing everything between him and Harry was out in the open, even if Draco didn’t want to pursue anything.
“This door is as old as the land itself,” he told Granger to force his thoughts away from his father. “This land was gifted to my ancestor Armand Malfoy by William the Conqueror after the Norman Conquest. The door was carved from the trees that were felled to build the main house. It’s imbued with so much magic I’m not even sure how much of it is really wood anymore.”
‘You harm so much as a hair on his head Oliver and I swear I’ll obliterate you. It’ll be like you never existed. I don’t know what you think you’re going to achieve with these stupid games, but I promise you when he’s strong enough they’ll come to an end.’ He’d never heard Harry talk like that before. He wondered if this was the side of him criminals had seen when he’d been an auror. No wonder he’d been so good at his job – his demeanour sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
‘That’s not what I meant! Why do you always have to twist my words? And I was NOT the one that left!’ Harry never was good at controlling his temper, so Draco cast an extra silencing charm around the conference room. They had in-built charms for the purpose, but Harry was known for defying the impossible.
‘You ok?’ Harry asked him quietly as Draco wrapped his arms around his waist and tucked his head under his chin. It was a little awkward since they were similar heights, but Draco didn’t care. Harry held him tightly and he felt like he could melt into him.
“Whether Harry goes alone or not, we all need to sleep before we can make any decisions. What you’ve said has given us all food for thought, Harry, I’m sure we could all use some time to mull it over.” Something about Remus’ tone didn’t sit well with Harry, but he knew he was right. Harry was exhausted and he’d been out cold for hours, never mind the others who hadn’t slept at all.
‘Since October? But I moved in October.’ He protested. Surely Harry would’ve told him if he’d been planning on leaving the force.
“Hey…” Harry approached cautiously; afraid he would lash out. “It’s ok, Luna is our friend. She doesn’t want to hurt you." Just like before, Harry carefully ran his index finger between the fox’s ears and down its back. The first time he did it, the gnashing stopped but the fox was still cowering at one side of the table. He tried it once more, secretly marvelling at how soft his fur was. It wasn’t every day Harry stroked a fox.
he thought when he went over their last conversation. There was nothing left to say between then, and although Harry knew nothing of his plans to move to Paris, Draco was sure he’d be more than happy to get Draco out of the way now that their somewhat tenuous arrangement was no longer necessary.
‘Oh, it’s from Hermione. She told me to give you her love, but you may as well just read it yourself.’ He gave the letter to Harry and reached forward to take one of the wine glasses. Hm, Gamay, not one of his favourites. A little too fruity for his tastes. Still, it would do.
Harry had been puttering around the house and driving Kreacher mad for days. He knew he was supposed to be figuring out the starting line-up for the Harpies – the season started in less than a month and he was currently still a chaser down. It wasn’t like he
It was all going well until Potter left Draco in the living room. The only thing worse than being in a foreign body in a foreign place he didn’t quite understand was being abandoned there. It was a weird feeling being stressed while in his fox form. The instincts of the fox were to move and keep moving, to get out as soon as possible and find open space. Draco’s own instincts were to be responsible and wait for Potter to return. And if he didn’t return, be grateful for having a semblance of a bed. The fox took over and Draco went flying. Cushions ripped, plants were knocked over, in the kitchen pots and pans clattered to the floor and he slipped and slid across the polished surfaces. He tried to claw at the windows but of course he couldn’t get out.
‘He is a trained professional. Maybe he knows something you don’t. You’re welcome to stop by my office any time, you know that, but don’t you think you should check in with Harry? He’s been worried sick you know. He wouldn’t tell the healers a thing about what happened other than you were trying to practice magic. I’ve been his best friend since we were eleven, I know when he’s not telling me something.’ She gave him a pointed look and he had to break eye contact. He always managed to forget how fierce she could be. In the best way of course.
I'm so sorry this update took so long. I have been busy, but this chapter has also been the hardest I've written for this fic so far. It didn't turn out the way I wanted, even after a hundred edits, but I hope it will do. Feelings are not my forte...
‘For Christ’s sake Draco, I wouldn’t even be here without you. When did you become so bloody Gryffindor?’ He couldn’t say anything to that. It was highly insulting after all. Gryffindor his arse.
He led them out through the back of the chateau and across the immaculate lawns. Spungen couldn’t manage to maintain the gardens on his own, not that Draco had expected him to, and whilst the lawns were kept to perfection, the flowerbeds were dry and desolate. They said nothing as they walked. Draco kept his hands clenched into fists in his pockets so that Harry couldn’t try to hold them.
‘Don’t talk too much darling, you’ll strain yourself. You’ve been a terrible friend, forgetting about me, but I forgive you. I’ve actually been rebuilding the bridge I burned with my mother so I suppose I should thank you really. Awful business the whole thing – that’s family for you.’ Draco was about to respond when a mediwitch came over to them.
‘Only time will tell I suppose. I don’t know what I expected, considering I live here now, and he was going to figure it out either way, but I thought we’d have more time than that. I thought we could tell him all of it slowly – break him in.’ Harry sat on their bed much the same way he had just found him sitting on Teddy’s. They both should be tired by now, yet somehow Draco felt like he’d downed an entire vat of black coffee.
“Yes?” They were interrupted as Tressy, with three other elves behind her like a tiny angry mob, appeared in the room with a crack.
“I like it. It feels different.” Harry cast a warming charm over the both of them and suggested they head home with a nod of his head.
“Mate I really don’t think this is a good idea. Shouldn’t we call someone to take it away? It could be diseased.” It was very unlike Ron not to want to help, but he had been having a horrible time of it recently and Harry understood that this was probably the last thing he needed.
She sighed. ‘I know. It sounds terrible. But in medieval wizarding communities divorce wasn’t a thing the way it is now. Couples separated of course, but they didn’t go through any sort of formal settlements, they didn’t divide their possessions, they just…started living separate lives.
‘Family hug?’ Teddy asked, looking hopefully between Harry and Draco. Draco’s insides squeezed uncomfortably, and he looked to Harry for a clue as to what to do next. Harry glanced sideways at him and shrugged a shoulder almost imperceptibly.
, Harry was conscious about have anti-apparition wards around the house to stop the crazier fans from trying anything.
Taking two floo trips in one day on top of the stairs had Draco clutching the mantelpiece when he stepped into the house. The warm tones of the living room which glowed in the summer sun looked insipid in the pale winter sky. Draco wasn’t having that, if he let his life become physically dull, who knew what mess his head would get into.
The following day was a Friday, and Draco kept his head down at work and tried his best to avoid Harry at all costs. He didn’t want to play with Harry’s emotions any more than he already had done. The only thing getting him through the day was the thought of having Teddy for the weekend.
They walked arm in arm down the street and Draco wondered how long it had been since he’d felt this relaxed around Harry. He wondered if it really had been so simple as telling him how he felt, although they were still no closer to figuring out why Draco’s mental state was affecting the dark mark. He pressed his left arm a little closer to Harry, as if his presence alone would siphon the dark magic away.
A noise startled him as he was waiting for the kettle to boil. It was a strange scuffing sound coming from the hallway. Harry was certain he’d locked the front door before they left so it would be worrying if something, or someone, had gotten inside.
‘No.’ He said, his voice wavering. Of course he hadn’t. He couldn’t ask Harry to stay sad and alone forever just because Draco couldn’t be what he wanted.
‘Christ, Draco. Will you get your act together? This is important.’ Harry said, turning to Draco. Draco looked at him and came right out with it; they were running out of time.
Draco looked up to the top of the tree. Since Teddy had been old enough to hold it, he’d been the one to put the star on the top. Harry had told him his aunt had always insisted on putting an angel on the top, but Harry said they didn’t need an angel to watch over them. He said it was more important to always look for the light. This year was the first year Teddy hadn’t decorated the tree with Harry.
Whilst the trip was supposed to be an important chance for them to talk, Draco had hoped that it would be an opportunity for Draco to show Harry the more elegant and respectable side of his heritage – expose him to some French culture.
‘She must be locked in her room or something.’ Harry mused. There was a crowd of people outside a particular door, each cooing pitifully against the wood as if coaxing out a spooked horse. He could see Susan and Helen among them, although Helen seemed far less concerned and far more annoyed than the others.
“I can’t believe you let this happen!” Harry watches Draco pace up and down the living room in agitation. He feels truly terrible for putting Draco in this position, but he absolutely didn’t do it on purpose.
He was just about to give up hope when he saw a figure in the distance. It was strangely ghostly and for a minute he wondered whether he really was stuck between the planes of existence. He walked towards the figure. Or at least, that’s what he thought he did. He couldn’t tell if he actually had any arms and legs and he felt like he was moving through something that was much thicker than water but just as cold, but he got closer to it never the less.
‘Draco, I’m your-was your husband. I know this.’ They both winced at the slip and Draco’s heart twisted uncomfortably.
‘Of course.’ Harry said stiffly, not looking at Draco. Draco supposed he should take what he could get.
‘I wouldn’t expect anything less,’ he said cheekily as he strode off towards the library where he knew he would find Ella. She was only five, but she was desperately trying to teach herself to read. She reminded him a lot of Hermione. Or at least, how he imagined Hermione might have been at that age, since of course he hadn’t known her then.
‘He what?’ He swivelled round on his chair to find Pansy propped up against the metal table behind him, staring at him intently.
He slowly made his way to the kitchen door, his hand hovering over his wand, ready to attack an intruder. As usual the ancient door creaked as Harry slowly pushed it open, and he was sure he was about to get smacked on the head and dragged out into the night. Of course, the universe was out to make him look like a fool, as he stepped out into the hallway and discovered the scratching sound was coming from a fox!
Teddy’s presence only made him more confused however. Draco always had Teddy on the weekends, since he lived with Harry, but Draco didn’t remember bringing him home or remember them going to bed. Draco glanced around for any evidence of what might have happened, trying his best not to jostle Teddy.
“You’ll love this part. You have to make a username – it’s what people will see when they look at your profile.”
sure you can get out of here, aren’t you? I will not have you mess this up for me any more than you already have.” There was a steely look in her eye much like the one she’d had when they’d been in that interview room together.
He glanced at the clock on the mantle. 9:26pm. Draco had promised he’d be back by 7:30pm and there was no sign of him anywhere. Harry had already sent a patronus to Hermione, asking her if she’d heard from him. The response had been “Bugger off, Harold. You know Friday night is date night. It’s not my fault you’ve got blue balls, his arse will be exactly the same at 9pm as it would be at 7pm.”
‘Yes. I have an apartment ready for me whenever I’m done with this case.’ He straightened his tie unnecessarily. Pansy just stared at him open-mouthed. ‘What?’ He said, a little too defensively.
“I can’t believe you did this behind my back.” Harry hissed quietly enough that Sirius couldn’t hear.
He was dizzy when he stepped out the other side of the floo, but he’d expected that. He took a deep breath and gave himself a minute to re-orientate himself. He hated coming to the Ministry. Ironic since he’d spent years coming for lunch dates with Hermione and of course he’d worked here before the…incident. Still, it wasn’t one of his favourite places in the world. He made his way to the lifts and up to Hermione’s office.
She pursed her lips in thought. ‘I’m not an expert on this, Draco. Having said that, I’m not sure anyone is. It’s practically unheard of. What did Smith say about these memories?’
That night he didn’t sleep well at all. He woke up every hour with nightmares of his last night with Harry and the look on Teddy’s face when he told him he was moving away. Thankfully the night before he’d had time to brew a fresh batch of potions and they helped somewhat. Draco went to the Ministry with tired eyes and a buzzing in his ears from lack of sleep. He was hardly keeping his eyes open as he made his way up to Kingsley’s office. He’d only been there once before just after his trial when Kingsley promised he would be exonerated.
‘It takes ages to go through the vetting process, maybe by then your magic will be better anyway. That reminds me, I’ve been meaning to ask you about that. What happened to your wand? I haven’t seen it anywhere near you recently, and the last time you cast you borrowed mine…’ Draco looked at him bewildered.
“Oh for the love of- of course it had to bloody rain too.” Draco complained, getting more exasperated by the second.
‘Here. Let me. You’re shaking.’ He held onto Draco’s hand to steady his arm and took over what Draco had started. ‘I take it it was you I managed to bring home last night.’ He said, not looking up from Draco’s arm. ‘Did we…?’ He trailed off awkwardly. Draco wasn’t sure why Harry was quite so bashful, it wasn’t as if they hadn’t slept together before. Yes, it wasn’t the wisest decision Draco had ever made, but he’d rather have had a one-night stand with Harry than a stranger. Judging by the familiar ache Draco had, and the fact he’d been completely starkers when he woke up, there was no question in his mind what they’d done.
‘Da-Draco,’ Teddy said after he was done discussing house quidditch, ‘I get why you like potions so much now.’ Draco’s head shot up from his plate where he’d just finished the last of his food. He hadn’t expected that.
He was half way to Hermione’s office when he was suddenly reminded of the fact that she’d been in the process of moving the last time he’d been here, and he’d completely forgotten. He got a few strange looks as he abruptly turned tails and went in the other direction. It was more nerve wracking to have to go to the Minister’s offices to see Hermione, but then the Minister had always been kind to him.
‘We should get on with it.’ Draco said abruptly, and the moment was lost. Harry’s face shuttered but he nodded.
“So,” Malfoy begins brusquely after he has poured their tea, “what kind of help is it that you need?”
‘Well, we never really discussed our relationship like that. We made it clear to each other that we both still had feelings, and after a while we started behaving a lot like we had when we were together, and it just sort of…fell back into how it was before. I thought maybe if I hadn’t said that I was in it for the long run that maybe he didn’t think it counted…’ Smith was nodding vigorously and scribbling away in the notepad. Draco wasn’t even sure if he was listening properly.
He ran to the hallway where they always apparate to, but there was no one there. They’d made a pact after first moving in together that they’d always apparate to the hallway because they’d both been jumpy after the war, and they’d occasionally given each other a nasty shock by popping out of thin air with no warning. Draco hadn’t complained that time Harry had apparated directly into the bathroom, desperate to pee, and found Draco in the shower having a bit too much fun. Ignoring the surge of interest that came with that particular memory, Harry went to the kitchen. He thought maybe that would be the next place Draco might apparate to. There was no one there either, even Kreacher appeared to have gone to bed.
