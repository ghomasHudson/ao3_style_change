“Yes, I know, I saw him this afternoon, he didn’t mention feeling off.” Narcissa replied.
It made her smile.
“Draco! DRACO! Come quickly!” Narcissa shouted.
Although it was well past the stage where they were probably needed, Draco continued to pay the midwife and the healer to stay at Malfoy manor and monitor the health of his mate and their baby.
Could they not have waited another hour or two?
Of course Draco still wanted to marry Harriet, he just wanted to do it on his own terms, not the rest of the world’s, and certainly not his parents’.
Draco’s sneer turned into a guilty frown as he reached out and took the basket with a nod, “Thanks….I’ll give it to her when she wakes.”
—————————————————————
Draco did not try to hide the anguish on his face as he implored the muggle in front of him, “My name is Draco….Smith. I need to speak with you immediately.”
The sight of Harriet in front of him brought him frighteningly close to spilling over the edge.
“Alright.” Draco nodded in agreement.
Why did Potter have to make everything so difficult?
Harriet frowned as he leaned down and kissed her forehead.
Harriet seemed a bit surprised but a small grin lit up her face.
The woman’s eyes immediately fell on Harriet’s rounded middle and the omega subconsciously placed a hand on her belly as she nodded at the woman and smiled, “Hello. I…….um, I’ve come looking for a gift for my husband.”
From where Draco knelt, he placed the ring on his beloved’s finger and then quickly stood to claim his prize.
After several hours of eating, dancing, talking, and drinking, the Malfoy couple were glad to leave their party, hand in hand, with Scorpius clutched in Harriet’s arms, dressed in miniature-sized formal wear, amidst their guests who cheered for them.
Harriet blinked in disbelief.
“Your mother and I have spent a great deal of money and time setting everything into place and now, you’ve ruined it all!” Lucius growled.
Harriet looked so beautiful, so sweet, and so lovely that when the officiant started speaking again after the couple had both spoken, Draco placed a dangerous amount of confidence in his subpar listening.
Draco frowned and wondered if Harriet was rejecting him because of where he came from?
Harriet stripped herself and crawled inside her comfortable nest that she had made that smelled like Draco.
Hermione didn’t know if she should ask about the baby or not…...it was making things even more awkward that Harriet hadn’t said a word about her pregnancy.
Draco took Harriet’s hand out of instinct. He was trying to protect his omega from an environment which he deemed hostile and dangerous.
At the end of the article, there was even an entire subsection dedicated to baby Scorpius. That portion of print told all about the youngest Malfoy, and speculated as to what his abilities may be one day given the esteemed heritages from his famous parents.
She would have loved to have been able to spend the night in that beautiful place with her alpha, but that wouldn’t work, it wouldn’t…….
Scorpius hadn’t heard his parents’ first, brief escapade either……..or their second.
From the second they left the hospital, Draco hovered over his wife like a mother hen and Harriet was so exhausted and frightened that she let him dote on her without protest.
“Why?” Draco demanded in a tone that Harriet found arousingly harsh, like velvet over steel.
Draco sighed in disappointment as he lay on his stomach to cuddle up to Harriet’s bump and place the side of his face against the swell.
As Draco sucked and thrusted and teased at her sensitive, exposed bud with the tip of one skillful, velvety finger, Harriet’s mind went blank as she felt her arousal coil in the base of her swollen belly.
The midwife smiled at the couple while she prepared to examine Harriet, amused by how soft Draco’s grey eyes were as he gazed down at his wife and lovingly stroked her hair.
Draco brought Harriet every letter as soon as the owl landed on the window sill, but Harriet neglected to answer. As the days passed, she even began asking Draco to open them and read them to her, which he gladly did.
Draco felt that going shopping for their baby was a good device he could use to continue his efforts.
Harriet blinked in disbelief as she looked at the baby.
The delight in her eyes was evident as she counted their newborn’s tiny eyelashes while he clutched her breast and enjoyed the leftover richness of his mother’s meal.
“Really well.” Hermione answered with a nod.
He was so annoyed that he forgot to keep his voice low for the baby.
“I think the little one is too.” Harriet added with a laugh.
For once, Draco was eager to be the hero.
The shining stars in the sky illuminated the waterfall behind the man as he stood in front of its rushing current.
“Oh, we can’t lose this game.” Harriet said as she looked at George with her green eyes wide.
The only time she had left his grasp since then was when she was forced to visit the restroom or needed to care for Scorpius.
Draco looked up at her and blinked, “I wasn’t kissing you, Potter. Why do I need your permission to kiss my child?”
It was almost as if as the baby grew, so did Draco’s strength.
Lucius and Narcissa blinked in surprise.
It came to a head one afternoon when Draco found Harriet lying on the nursery floor beside Scorpius’s intricately carved crib, staring off into the distance as she lost herself to her own thoughts.
—————————————————————-
As she tried to recover from the last contraction and deal with the tremendous weight that threatened to snap her pelvis in two, Harriet had little memory of being moved.
“Come on, then.” Harriet said after she wheeled the trunks into the center of the room and held out her hand to Draco, “Let’s be off.”
Harriet had no idea babies required such heavy equipment.
As the couple walked along, they glanced at each other incredulously.
Harriet’s hands should have been fastening the buttons to his shirt while he purred to her, nipping at her lips.
Ron was worried that he sounded insulting, but Hermione fretted that he sounded daft.
“You know, Mr. Malfoy……” The jewelry shop’s best salesman nodded at his prestigious and very wealthy customer after he had shown Draco a selection of materials that weren’t to his liking, “We have the highest reputation for quality jewelry in the wizarding world. If you don’t see anything you like here, I’d be happy to help you design something entirely customized to your tastes.”
Draco traipsed into the Malfoy family library once more, climbed the mahogany ladder, and began to peruse through all of the many, ancient volumes that sat at the top of the tallest bookcases.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Ron asked with a frown, “They both said they weren’t together, but their mates…….but they aren’t together.”
Draco’s facial expression had nothing to do with Harriet or his feelings for her, but he was eager to stop verbally sparring with his father and focus on the day that laid ahead as he answered, “I apologize, Father, but with all due respect, this is one of the happiest days of my life. I’ll thank you to stop berating me, it’s really hampering my smile.”
“Then read the letter~.” Draco coaxed.
“I don’t think that’s safe right now, love.” Draco whispered in a bittersweet tone as he let his fingers trail across the inside of Harriet’s legs.
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy sat at the heavy, black-lacquered dining table enjoying their dinner that evening when Draco came barging into the room.
Harriet nodded and she placed her hands on Draco’s chest while she pulled herself up and threw her head back to stretch.
“WWWWAAAA!”
Chubby Scorpius was a true joy to hold.
He smiled lovingly at his mate and watched in happy anticipation as she raised her arms and pulled her nightshirt off………
“Are you upset that it’s a boy?” Harriet asked Draco as they both stared down at their baby.
Being an auror made her happy and he wanted her to be happy.
She raised her wand in the air and left the room with a loud pop, eager to find her alpha and see if anything in particular had delayed him from returning to her side…...
All Harriet could really hear was the blood pulsating in her own ears as she took a deep breath and bore down again.
No matter what was coming, the sensation of Draco showing her his affection in such a sweet and loving way, that made it all seem so much…….better.
No, he decided that the safest place for his mate was the womb-like seclusion of his childhood home.
As Scorpius smiled back at his mother, Harriet marveled at how much he looked just like a miniature version of Draco.
What would they look like?
—————————————————————
When she was satisfied with how she looked, she stepped out of the lavatory, and walked back into the bedroom.
Harry was too preoccupied with his task to worry about if his excited grin had offended his wife or not.
She hoped that she would be lucky.
Slowly, she turned her head and dismay gripped her as she saw Ron and Hermione gaping at her with wide eyes.
Why should she be nervous about the next day?
Harriet looked out the window and tried to forget the hypnotizing touch of the blonde alpha she had fallen into bed with those few months ago.
The next five years passed by in a happy blur for the Malfoy family.
Although Draco could smell her sweet scent, the feisty omega didn’t seem interested in receiving any more of his affections.
“Draco, please…...” Harriet begged in a desperate sigh.
“You don’t know where she’s living.” Ron reminded his girlfriend.
No matter how much she tossed and turned, she couldn’t find a comfortable position.
Ron rushed over to his mate’s side, in a hurry to take the heavy tray out of her hands.
Draco sighed again and looked over at Harriet as he huffed, “No, Potter, of course I still want to marry you! But surely you can see, our wedding is going to be little more than a circus! Where’s the meaning? The entire thing is only for my parents to strut around telling everyone that their son’s mated with ‘The Chosen One’ and how redeemed House Malfoy and House Black have become! I want to marry you to show my love for you, to make that commitment to you, not to glorify my family names! It’s a mockery! I meant it as something beautiful, but they’ve ruined it now and it makes my stomach turn!”
“Sissy today, Daddy?” Scorpius asked Harry.
Draco and Harriet glanced at each other before they slowly stepped into the room.
Nonchalantly, Harriet dressed herself for work.
She had been lying there, suffering for hours.
That was the heartbeat of his son or daughter.
Harriet saw a muggle car parked by the side of the road on the outer edge of the land behind the waterfall. She watched blankly as the man walked towards it for a moment before she turned to Draco and cried, “Are you mad?!”
Draco couldn’t feel Harriet’s skin under his hands and she couldn’t fully feel his touch through the fabric.
The two couples met for meals and on occasion in the library or at house parties, but the dwelling was so grand that Draco had no trouble keeping a respectful distance from his parents, although the flat that he and Harriet had purchased still offered more privacy.
Nearly a month after they cared for Rose, Draco still brought up his desire to become a father on more than a few occasions.
Harriet had heard about the educational programs the hospital offered for new and expecting parents, but she hadn’t given them a second thought.
It was his turn to blush then.
“We’re expecting!” Draco exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement any longer, as he glanced between his mother, his father, and Harriet.
Draco Malfoy wanted what he wanted and Draco Malfoy wanted to feel his baby.
She feigned being inconvenienced by the hastiness of their departure, but as she stood there with Draco, preparing to go on their romantic adventure together, she wouldn’t have preferred it any other way.
Harriet didn’t have the slightest clue what her alpha was up to or that he had even left her side whenever he returned, since Draco chose to carry out his secondary conferences with Ron and Hermione mostly either late at night or at dawn, during which Harriet was asleep and Scorpius lay snoozing as well, tucked into his little crib.
Even while he and Harriet kissed, Draco snaked a hand between them and let his fingers splay protectively over the place where his unborn child was growing.
With an exasperated sigh, Draco placed a piece of parchment down on his desk and picked up a quill. He glanced up and saw that the enchanted owl he employed to carry his daily message to Harriet was already waiting outside on the roof of the manor.
“Correct as always, Granger.” Draco said with a taunting smirk as his eyes flickered between Ron and Hermione, “Of course I would have brought Harriet, if I wasn’t intending to speak about her with you two. What we’re about to discuss is not to leave this table, is that understood?”
He glanced over at the nightstand and saw that a letter from the previous morning had been left unopened.
“Problem?......What problem?” Harriet mumbled, lowering herself down onto the sofa.
Narcissa and Ron clapped with joy.
“No, I expect you to quit and stay home with me and the baby.” Draco replied, laughing with Rose as she giggled at him curiously, “I run the family business. I can do that from the manor. The income from my father’s many companies in a single year is enough to last a generation. You don’t need to work, you never have.”
He knew that it would be considered unmannerly if he were to pounce on his new bride in front of others.
Harriet winced and tried in vain to maneuver herself so that her alpha could slip inside her, but her patience didn’t match her will. She grew tired of her mate’s skillful dodging and gave in as she cried out, “Fill me, Draco! Fill me up!”
However, on the morning of the Malfoy company board meeting during Harriet’s seventh month, she was glad to see Draco go.
Harriet wasn’t one for showy, pompous affairs, but having a day to spend partying and laughing with all of her friends and introducing everyone to her new son, well……
Draco’s grey eyes soft and sad as he stared down at his omega. Carefully, he swept Harriet up into her arms and gently carried her over to bed, after which, he placed her in the nest as gently as if she were made of glass.
The more desperate Draco became, the more he would make love to her and that was Harriet’s favorite pastime, making love to Draco~.
Harriet looked at Draco while she walked and the bright smile that spread over her lips as she gazed at her groom made his breath hitch as it hit him squarely in the heart.
Those-
Draco sniffed and rolled over.
Harriet soothingly stroked the back of Draco’s hand with hers when she looked up and saw that his jaw was clenched.
When the push ended, Harriet gasped in exasperated anguish and felt lips press against her leg, just above her knee.
Harriet let out a small gasp as Draco grabbed hold of her hands and faced her as formally as a soldier standing at attention.
—————————————————————
“Won’t you two come in?” Ron whispered, “Sorry for the quiet, Rose just went down for her nap.”
Absolutely not.
Draco stood from his seat on the chaise lounge in his room and knelt down beside Harriet as he asked softly, “Is there…...anything I can do?”
“You’re going to give me another baby to carry, Malfoy.” Harriet laughed as she gasped for breath, letting her hands roam through Draco’s short, blonde hair.
As he read, a wide smirk spread over Draco’s pale face.
“....That’s because I take pills so I don’t have the bothersome things.” Harriet shrugged.
Hermione frowned as she watched the new family.
He had no problem flirting with her and expressing his blatant interest.
Six months was enough.
“That’s not her, Hermione. She’s on holiday, remember? I’m sure she owled you about it too.” Ron said, dismissing his lover’s claim.
Her heart sank when she saw that her suspicions had been correct.
“Because we’re not together.” Harriet sniffed, “That’s what you said.”
He kept track of how much water they drank every day.
Draco had his arms up in celebration as cheers erupted after he worked with one of Slytherin’s beaters to nearly send a bludger whirling out of the stadium when he saw Harriet dive low.
Once Draco left her body, Harriet sighed as he peppered her face with soft, gentle kisses, content with a morning well spent.
“I can’t…....” Harriet whispered into his ear.
Harriet didn’t slap Draco, or scream at Draco, but she did pull him down until his lips crushed against hers.
Normally, she loved it when her husband chose to keep his grey eyes adoringly fixated on her, but that night, after what they had learned from the midwife, Harriet knew Draco wasn’t giving her the kind of attention she hoped to receive.
His mouth was half open as Harriet sighed once she was finally comfortable, her swollen breasts and belly heaving right in front of his face, before she lifted her hands and began to comb gently through his short, pale, blond hair.
As soon as the midwife left the room, Draco turned Harriet with a scowl towards and hissed, “Potter! Really! Are you trying to-“
The room was elegantly decorated in a fashion that was worthy of Slytherin royalty.
—————————————————————
The day to day hummings of the magical world had been rather dull since the conclusion of the war.
Harriet had fully embraced her bond to her mate and they spent their days side by side, with their baby between them, in complete, domestic bliss.
When Hermione pulled away, Harriet asked her with a sweet smile, “Would you like to hold him?”
“But you don’t have to…...because I’m here, Potter~.” Draco replied with a smirk.
They had barely finished eating when Harriet crawled on top of Draco’s lap. Between the look in her eyes and the thick, sweet scent that continued to pour from her glands, Draco helplessly surrendered to his omega’s demanding needs.
By the time they both found their release, Harriet was gasping for breath and Draco had managed to claw the top of her dress down far enough to bury his face in her ample cleavage.
————————————————————
No matter what happened between her and Draco, Harriet would always be the mother of a Malfoy.
She charged towards the bedroom she shared with Draco and burst through the door, expecting to find him either asleep or violently ill.
“...........Because I’m not.” Harriet replied.
“I’m sure he’s perfectly fine. He’s always been sensitive like you, Cissa.” Lucius sniffed.
————————————————————-
She remembered feeling exactly like that as the nurses had helped her onto the bed to deliver Scorpius.
“Pictures?” Draco asked.
She had tried to speak civilly, but her patience was short.
Draco, the proud alpha, was having a very difficult time being ignored.
It was even better than Draco remembered, of course, the first time, Harriet hadn’t been so deliciously tender~.
Harriet glanced up at him angrily with the front buttons on her dress open, revealing an obscene amount of cleavage as she met his gaze.
—————————————————————
“Wonderful!” The officiant nodded, “Shall I escort you two back to our humble establishment?”
Draco scowled back before the elder Malfoy lurched away.
—————————————————————
Hermione let Harriet clutch her close sympathetically and Narcissa frowned, but at the foot of the nest, the midwife and the healer were hard at work.
The baby girls giggled at Draco and he smirked as he picked them both up. He held Lily in one arm and Narcissa in the other.
Draco remembered staring into the void as the secretary attempted to make small talk with him to pass the time, but he didn’t remember what she said, nor did he really hear.
Hermione and Harriet exchanged happy smiles with one another.
Dr. Krause giggled at the ignorant alpha and looked up at Draco with a warm smile as she informed him, “That’s your baby!”
“Goodness.” Draco laughed as he placed his hand over Harriet’s, “Active today, aren’t they?”
“You can’t hear a heartbeat yet either, Malfoy.” Harriet chuckled in amusement.
“We’re going to give Harriet Potter a proper welcome to the Malfoy family.” Narcissa replied.
“Ron and Hermione are coming back today.” Harriet informed her husband with a groan, thinking that truth would offer him the same level of relief that it did her.
“I don’t see it.” Lucius murmured stiffly.
—————————————————————
Both of you earned exceptional honors on the quidditch field during your school days.
“Not if I prove that child is mine.” Draco scowled dangerously at Harriet, “I will not allow a Malfoy to be traded off like some unwanted mutt! And those are the strangest clothes I’ve ever seen, those people must be a bunch of beggars.”
Married.
“That’s for the best. You’re going to need it, love.” Harry said as he bent his head and kissed Draco’s cheek, “Call me when you need me, alright?”
—————————————————————
Careful not to hold her breath in, she inhaled and exhaled slowly while she tried her best to relax.
Draco was already there, waiting for her and the baby, with a blanket across his legs, fluffy pillows stacked against his chest, and a warm cup of tea on the wooden table in front of the sofa.
Draco’s mother immediately rushed over to the pained girl.
She grinned when she saw Draco waiting on her, already changed into his dapper, new suit but he didn’t return her smile as he gazed back.
Harriet wasn’t the only witch who had been raised in a muggle family.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“So, Granger and Weasley are leaving their baby with us for the entire time?” Draco huffed, sitting up in bed with a scowl as Harriet hurriedly dressed.
He honestly wanted to hear about how the pregnancy had gone, about how and what his darling Harriet felt.
That should stop her tears~.
Harriet looked over as her door swung open suddenly.
Draco frowned as he watched her chest heave and fall. He lovingly kissed her cheek again while he urged her, “Then I’ll let you look through the boxes and whatever you don’t like, we won’t keep. How’s that?”
“Perhaps later.” Harriet nodded.
“Buy whatever you want from the trolley, son.” Draco nodded at Scorpius while he handed him his trunk and his owl, a beautiful, black feathered bird with bright, yellow eyes.
Harriet cleared her throat and looked away.
“You two have done very well.” The midwife praised the happy couple after she looked over Harriet and ran a few tests, “Mother and baby are doing fine. I see the time off work has been most helpful after all, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Harriet was certain that Draco would have noticed the way her breasts had swelled and her lips pinkened as her heat approached.
Harriet didn’t smile back at her husband. Instead, she stared at him from behind her glasses and replied in a fierce warning, “You….wish…..”
Both she and Draco quickly discovered that caring for a baby was more than just cuddling and admiring.
He had been raised to believe that he was special.
Dear Harriet Potter,
The night before the Malfoy wedding, Draco and Harriet spent the evening apart with their separate entourages.
“Well,” Draco purred, before he glanced down at Harriet’s nightgown and tried to pull the garment down so that he could get a glimpse of her perfect breasts, which he happily noticed had stayed a bit larger, even after Scorpius had weaned, “ I was going to make love to my wife……..if that’s alright, Mrs. Malfoy?”
Draco’s head snapped up and he grimaced when he noticed what had startled Harriet so.
“Yes, Weasley.” Draco answered, irritated that he was shaken out of his pleasant thoughts, “I really do.”
Draco scowled as his polished, black shoes glinted in the streetlights.
To Mr. Draco Malfoy and Mrs. Harriet Malfoy, known widely as Ms. Harriet Potter,
Harriet groaned longingly at the contact but Draco clenched his jaw and hissed his repeated command, “Say it, Potter!”
The all-inclusive resort had seen to it that their guests needn’t leave the privacy of their exclusive quarters to have quality meals. All Harriet or Draco had to do was tap their wands on the kitchen counter and under the bungalow’s enchantment, whatever they wanted to eat appeared on plates, in bowls, and in cups, ready to be consumed.
If she asked for something, he brought it without delay.
Draco leaned in and whispered his request to the salesman, whose eyes widened in shock even though he stayed true to his word and remained silent.
The sweat had silently dripped down his back while the healers examined Harriet.
“Of course, Mr. Potter!” Dr. Krause smiled at Draco, “You two get to keep the pictures, that’s half the fun!”
“You can take the potion with you!” Draco offered his omega once she was dressed.
From outside the room, he heard Harriet open the front door. He heard the whispers of voices as she, Ron, and Hermione started to chat.
Draco thought it was cramped.
He groaned when she cut him off and leaned down to him instead.
Harriet laid the letter back down and stretched as a gentle flutter rippled from her abdomen. Her green eyes glanced down and she spread her hands on the sides of her rounded belly with a resigned sigh.
“You’re having a baby with Malfoy?!” Ron asked Harriet in complete disbelief and utter disgust.
She could return whenever she wanted, after all, she was Harriet Potter, the Chosen One, the defeater of the Dark Lord…..but the Chosen One wisely realized that her little boy’s baby days would only last for a short while and she wanted to be present for them.
Harry grabbed a towel without hesitation and positioned his hands directly under Draco as he urged her on with a gentle smile, “Go ahead and push then, love. I’m not going to leave you.”
Harriet wasn’t willing to admit it to her alpha, but he was right.
Draco’s eyes narrowed as he noticed the woman didn’t appear to be in pain, but she did have a covering over her head, nose, and mouth as she lay on the table.
What could they possibly help Draco Malfoy with?
Every time Draco looked at his son, he saw himself, but when he looked at his daughters, he saw his wife,
While Harry had cooked breakfast, Draco had been trying to understand what was going wrong.
Draco was going to contact someone…..about a portrait…. or…….something…....
Draco sat up on the mat and opened his arms to Harriet. He placed one of the practice pillows against his chest and opened his legs to allow Harriet to snuggle against him, which she did with a reluctant huff.
Harriet looked up from the baby and met her alpha’s gaze with her own as Draco swallowed and nodded, “We have a son.”
Draco’s affection was deep, sweet, and loving and once he finally pulled away, he and Harriet were both breathless.
Harriet’s closed eyelids fluttered and her kiss eventually slowed until Draco pulled away and gently pecked her forehead as he whispered, “Rest, love.”
“AAAAAAAGGGGHHH!”
Her mate would be there beside her.
“Yes, my letters. I have a hunch that you’ve received at least some of them.” Draco said suspiciously as his grey eyes flickered back down to her belly.
Once she was satisfied with her meal, the subtle groan of relief that echoed from Harriet’s throat caused Draco to smirk in triumph.
“The pamphlets say two weeks early isn’t anything to worry over.” Harriet sighed.
“The pains are nowhere near close, Mr. Malfoy. If your wife wants to labor here for a while, I don’t see the harm.” The midwife said a half an hour later as Harriet squeezed Draco’s hand and fought her way through another pain after the woman finished examining her.
“No, of course not.” Draco said seriously. He cleared his throat as a slight blush covered his pale cheeks.
Without hesitation, he apparated away from his desk and landed in the hallway of the Auror Department, within an arm’s length of Harriet.
Draco had Lucius, Narcissa, and several of his old Slytherin housemates to keep him company.
No, the movement in the image wasn’t the special part about that picture……..
“Good morning.” Draco replied dismissively.
Narcissa and Draco looked at each other and Draco reluctantly nodded, “Of course…...but I’m staying right outside the room, alright? Please don’t ask me to go any farther than that, I really can’t right now.”
When Draco straightened up, he felt Harriet staring at him.
Harriet stared at Draco incredulously while he looked at her, then at the baby, then back at her.
His tone was rude and curt and Harriet decided she had had enough.
Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff hadn’t been selected to play in the game, but no one seemed particularly bothered by that.
“Good evening!” The man greeted Draco in a friendly tone, “May I help you, sir?”
Draco drew in a breath at how fair and lovely Harriet’s face looked, as she closed her eyes, under the glow of the moon that trickled in through the curtains.
—————————————————————-
They entered the street from a non-conspicuous alley and side by side, they walked down the street, masquerading as an ordinary muggle couple.
Both of his parents were a bit envious of his blissful rest as Harriet laid him back down in his bassinet.
“Is my omega carrying twins?!” He demanded as the midwife handed the baby to Harriet, who gladly accepted her newborn with a tired cry.
“Are you still working full time, Mrs. Malfoy?” The midwife asked her expectant patient.
“.......Alright?” Draco asked after a moment.
Unless she was at the office, wherever Harriet was, Draco was by her side.
Harriet nodded at the woman as she approached and turned on one of the machines that Draco was so suspicious of, “Hello, it’s nice to meet you as well, Dr. Krause. This is my mate, Draco.”
A soft, happy smile crossed over Harriet’s lips as she nodded at Draco and gave her alpha the answer he so longed to hear, “Yes, Draco…...I’ll marry you!”
Harriet’s face fell as her happiness faded and the reality of her situation pressed painfully upon her.
Draco was livid when he realized that on the other side of the tarp, the woman on the table was…….awake.
Once she was finished reading its contents, she picked up her wand and placed the tip against the parchment. Harriet watched as a tiny flame burst from the wand’s tip and very gently turned Draco’s letter into ashes, which she gathered in her hand.
For an expectant father, Draco actually slept quite well.
He didn’t care.
“Don’t worry about all of that now. Madam Pomfrey said you sustained a serious concussion…….She said you’re lucky that your skull didn’t crack open like an egg!” Harriet told Draco in a loud whisper.
Draco stepped back and Harriet slipped into a pair of black shoes before she quickly scurried over to hold Draco’s hand.
“Thank you, Weasley.” Draco nodded, “Potter and I are very proud.”
“Are you Mr. Malfoy?” The healer asked.
“None of your business, that’s what it is!” Harriet cried as she roughly pushed Draco’s hands away from her round belly.
Clothing hurt her skin, the friction was too constant, too close, but there in her bed, she felt safe and warm. Lying amongst Draco’s things, Harriet snuggled down and breathed deeply, trying to pick up enough of her alpha’s smell to satisfy herself until her blonde mate came home.
—————————————————————
The baby whimpered under his grandfather’s steely gaze and Draco shifted nervously on his feet as he watched every move Lucius made.
“A-AAHHH! AAHH! DRACO!”
“It’s nearly eight!” Hermione retorted, “I thought everyone would be up by now!”
The woman behind the counter began to think as she studied Harriet.
Draco’s heart clenched in his chest.
He wrapped his strong arms around her and as she laid her head on his firm chest, he covered them both with the soft layers of her nest to guard against the early morning chill.
As they left their bungalow a few days later, the Malfoys accepted with a sad resolve that their notions had been incorrect.
A triumphant smirk lit up Draco’s handsome face as he lowered his wand.
Once the spasm ended, Harriet sagged back against him with a gentle sigh, but Draco was not nearly as relaxed.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked in concern.
“-But,” Draco interrupted, “I have as many rights as you do to that baby. When I prove I’m the father, the court will turn them over to me. If everything else fails, then I’ll bide my time for the next eighteen years and approach them as an adult. No child of mine is not going to realize they’re a Malfoy.”
Narcissa stopped in her tracks, turned around, and blinked at Harriet in surprise.
To her delight, Oliver Wood had come back as the team captain, George Weasley was a beater once more, and Katie Bell had also returned to her position as a chaser.
She didn’t allow herself to consider how good the alpha looked, standing there, tall and fit, in his black suit.
“I am.” The man replied with an apprehensive nod.
Draco didn’t want Harriet to feel forced or pressured. He was trying to be considerate by giving her space.
Of course the Potter omega had always smelled lovely to the Malfoy alpha, but when Draco opened his eyes that particular morning, he was positive that he was no longer in his own room.
Yes, as a matter of fact, he was going to get down on his knees and ask Harriet to marry him, until she had to pipe up and say something about it.
“I’m not the one that just gave birth.” Draco frowned, “You need the rest, don’t worry about me.”
Draco offered her his hand and he kept the other on her back as he helped her stand from his writing desk. His motions were soft and gentle as he brought Harriet into the bathtub with him and cleaned them both.
Draco and Harriet shared parenting duties as much as possible.
It wasn’t spoken as a question, it was asserted as an undeniable fact.
“Get your hands off of me, Malfoy!” Harriet hissed, “I beg your pardon, but I don’t need your protection!”
Draco woke up to the sound of his wife being ill, and in the middle of her retching, Harriet heard him come racing into the bathroom.
“Draco, where are you going?!?!” Lucius called.
Panic flooded through Draco’s veins when Harriet’s eyes failed to open.
She was all pain and all work.
He even knew when Harriet used the lavatory and for how long.
Shortly after Draco and Harry had gotten married, Harry had managed to find and contact Dobby, knowing that he had survived the wound Bellatrix inflicted on him during the war. The house elf bore a scar from his struggle but that did nothing to dampen the smile that broke out on his face when he had seen Harry Potter again.
He assumed that his parents must have arrived home, but why were they so noisy?
The noise was loud and demanding and rhythmic.
“I’d love to.” Draco answered instantly.
As Harriet entered her last trimester, fueled by the nervous happiness that only expectant fathers knew, Draco began to make preparations for the birth. While Harriet took naps, he took lessons from the healer on what his omega’s labor would be like and what he could do to help.
Draco could take a few years off and return to his potions once his son or daughter enrolled at Hogwarts, Lucius wouldn’t mind.
That tiny baby was the living product of his love for Harriet, an eternal representation that she was his and he was hers.
Harriet’s heart thudded in her chest as her hormones once again consumed her and she shifted uncomfortably in her nest, impatient for Draco to come over to her and give her what she craved.
Every day, Draco and Harriet went through the same routine.
Harriet could nearly see the sand through the waves.
“Do you think Harriet’s with him?” Ron asked Hermione.
Harriet’s face looked so soft and lovely like that. The gentleness in Harriet’s eyes melted Draco’s heart in his chest. As if Harriet wasn’t enough to ruin him, Draco scanned over the baby girl and he marveled at how small and adorable she was, staring at the miniature socks on her miniature feet.
Harriet and Draco ate their meals together in the bungalow’s living room.
“Well, I’m sure they’re offices are all closed now, Draco. I’ll make one in the morning.” Harriet retorted.
Harriet’s chest heaved as she looked up into her husband’s darkened face. Her cheeks were flushed and her green eyes were begging him silently to just give her what she wanted.
“That better not be how you ask me!” Hermione hissed to Ron in a warning tone.
But Draco Malfoy had never been known for his kindness~.
“What’s gelato?” Draco frowned.
Draco thought their innumerable amorous frolics should have been more than sufficient to launch them along the road to parenthood.
Lucius scoffed, “I’ll have you know that was for the betterment of our family’s business! I see no reason to sit back and-“
Love,
So much for easing the tension……
“Later.” Draco murmured irritably, without looking up.
The Malfoy’s company profits skyrocketed and Lucius couldn’t have been happier.
His steely stare skimmed over Harriet’s messy, dark hair, tousled and wavy as it hung over her shoulders, trailing to her full breasts and the mound of her tummy, splendidly highlighted by the green dress she wore.
—————————————————————-
Her night robe was the only thing she wore and that was fastened tightly to support her swollen breasts.
The middle-aged woman beamed down proudly at Draco.
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Draco blinked incredulously at Harriet.
—————————————————————
The Malfoy family healer remained stony-faced through the tender scene.
Once the girls and the elves had left the room, Draco looked down at Harriet and offered her his hand.
The next sentence from the Malfoy heir’s mouth shocked his parents more than anything else he had told them that night. Out of anyone he could have named, neither Lucius nor Narcissa expected Draco to look at them and say, “Potter…….My omega is Harriet Potter.”
It was odd, really, almost as if the child sensed his father’s plans and schemed their chance meeting from inside her womb……….
“It’s not Harriet’s fault. It can take some time, Malfoy.” Ron replied, “You being so mental about it isn’t helping.”
Draco flipped over as they rolled in the sheets while his hands swept over her body. Neither of them really remembered how they got there, but in the midst of their passionate flurry, Harriet found herself sitting on top of her alpha, with him seated inside her and his hands possessively gripping her hips.
—————————————————————
Draco helped Harriet sit back down at the table.
Harriet felt her temperature raise and her skin burn as her core heated and the area between her legs dampened. In desperation, she looked around and tried to decide where she wanted to be.
“You’ve finally decided to bear pups for me, Potter?” Draco growled as he positioned himself over top of Harriet.
The way Harriet had run and hid, yet still allowed him to come back into her life, and their baby’s….
The overpowering beauty of the ocean and the sky placed them in a stark yet comforting void that made Siren’s Slip seem like the true world and everything else seem false.
Harriet whimpered and wound her hands in his hair as she called out her lover’s name again.
The shot had been taken by a magical camera, which had been operated by a wizard, so it was no wonder that it moved.
“Would you shut it, Potter?!” Draco hissed as Harriet continued to laugh, although his narrowed eyes softened when he saw the way that she cradled her belly.
“That’s right, Harriet!” Hermione said enthusiastically, “Don’t forget that! I’ve always wished that I had your confidence!”
“You can’t call me that anymore.” Harriet laughed quietly.
Draco kept stealing glances at Harriet over the candlelit table but he was reluctant to gaze too long at his omega. He could feel Lucius’s stare boring into him.
Draco nodded and glanced nervously towards the doorway.
“I can hold him so you can go back to sleep?” Draco offered as he watched tears well in Harriet’s eyes.
“No, no, I’m fine, that was……..that was brilliant…………..Now I’d really like to sleep, though.” Harriet said with a yawn.
Draco looked down at Harriet and kissed her cheek while she slept.
The relief in her eyes when she saw Draco melted his heart.
She felt safe and at ease…....
“You really love her, don’t you?” Ron asked Draco in a much gentler tone than he had used moments ago.
She leaned in to kiss Draco’s cheek but instead, he caught her lips with his and pulled her in close.
Draco knew that, but to him, it would be worth it.
From inside the covered carrier, a tiny whimper rang out as the little one inside woke.
Dr. Krause glanced between Draco and Harriet as she asked, “Would you two like me to tell you the gender?”
While Narcissa and Hermione cradled Harriet and stayed by her head, Draco was holding Harriet’s leg for her, both so he could support his lover and so he could watch the birth of his son or daughter.
Harry let Draco brace himself against him but the panic in her voice worried him.
Thursday night, she startled wide awake in bed and glanced around.
“Why?” Draco asked as he bent down and kissed Harriet’s forehead, “How am I supposed to help if I’m asleep?”
Harriet didn’t want her future mother-in-law to walk in on her as she mated with her son.
Her baby.
As Draco’s thin, elegant fingers fastened the buttons of his shirt, Harriet tried not to notice the way his eyes were fixated on her while she wriggled into one of her few dresses that still fit.
Draco would have gladly let his languid kisses with Harriet flourish into a lovemaking session but he was too attentive to his mate’s needs to push her any further when he sensed her enthusiasm lessening.
Harriet’s eyes widened as Draco moved from behind her and swiftly knelt in front of her as she sat on the bed, gazing at her with awed admiration.
“Both of you, out!” He snapped at his mother and Hermione.
Draco grit his teeth as he found his release, holding onto that memory……
The past and the present were reality, Siren’s Slip, that was the dream.
As Draco paused for a moment to gather his words, Harriet yawned and took a languid stretch right in front of him, letting her alpha have a good eyeful of the intriguing curves that her changed body boasted.
Whether Lucius believed him or not, Draco had told his father the truth.
As the next couple of weeks passed, Draco’s progress towards securing Harriet’s affection and trust remained slow, but somewhat steady.
Since they became engaged, Harriet and Draco felt that their lives had turned into whirlwinds of anxious activity.
“Potter…” Draco breathed as he looked into her eyes, “I want you to take this, go into the lavatory, and spend some time preparing for this evening.”
“Sssh……..Potter, I’m not laughing at you.” Draco whispered while his elegant fingers drew soothing patterns over Harriet’s swollen tummy, “I’m not laughing at you at all. I want you to be happy, but I want you and the baby to be healthy too. Am I not allowed to want that?”
“Sorry about that, like I’ve said though, he’s been a nightmare since we started trying. It was really good of Ron to go and chat with him.” Harriet apologized to Hermione.
Harriet enjoyed making her alpha happy and the many rewarding moments that came with having a family.
She could no longer have a simple conversation with Draco, all he wanted to talk about was the baby.
Draco had grown up very sheltered, spending his days at either Malfoy manor or Hogwarts. During his time as a Death Eater, he rarely had to leave the familiar confines of either.
“Is that Harriet?!”
Draco let a hand fall to Harriet’s hip and before they got any closer, he raised his wand and apprated them both straight to the restaurant at which he had made reservations.
Instantly, his grey eyes snapped up to his wife and he blinked at her, trying to maintain his focus.
Harriet brushed her hair and looked at herself in the mirror to make sure her clothes were on straight.
She was aware that her belly started to ache but the pressure in her temples overpowered it.
“I expect if we do, you’ll have to hear about it for the rest of the week, eh, Potter?” Oliver asked. His question earned him a chuckle from the rest of the team. It was no secret that Harriet and Draco were happily married.
Harriet turned to look at her husband and he smiled up at her softly with his grey eyes meltingly loving.
Draco had been anxiously waiting for his mate to conceive.
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Harriet asked.
Draco’s grey eyes snapped up to her face and he started to speak, “No, love! Wait a moment and I’ll—“
Before Draco could protest or stop her, Harriet apparated away from The Three Broomsticks and arrived back at her apartment.
Harriet wouldn’t make eye contact with Draco, fearing what would happen between them if she gazed into his frosty, gray gaze that she knew was surely heated with lust.
She had made a mistake and so had he.
The Malfoy alpha was embarrassed by how soft and needy his voice sounded.
Since they had started their classes, Draco was often up late pouring over the plethora of pamphlets and educational booklets they had received.
Mr. Roberts was surprised that such a dapper gentleman would ask a ridiculous, naive question, but he was kind and patient.
She needed to be on the bed she shared with Draco, even though he wouldn’t be beside her until later.
Harriet’s eyes softened as she looked at the picture and read over the letter’s words for the hundredth time, finding peace and comfort.
Lucius himself nodded at his son in approval.
—————————————————————
Harriet thought the Weasleys’ cottage was charming and quaint.
Draco looked at Harriet, staring at her with his handsome, grey eyes as she cleared her throat, “Well, I mean, yeah, technically we did…….er, you know…….but we’re not…um, together.”
Draco found happiness in simply being around Harriet. It didn’t matter if she was pregnant or not, if they were talking or arguing, Harriet was his mate and all he really wanted to do was just be with her.
“Well, I’m not certain what you intend to find for a baby in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.” Harriet shrugged, “I didn’t know any of the merchants there sold nappies.”
Boldly, Draco leaned down and placed a kiss on her forehead as a sign of love and reassurance.
Draco sighed as he rubbed his pale face.
He half sat up and stared at her incredulously, “Aren’t you going to ask me what happens if Slytherin wins?!”
“Daddy, what’s wrong with mummy?” Scorpius asked from the doorway, frowning at the upsetting scene in front of him.
—————————————————————
After her little digestive system righted itself at last, Harriet changed her one more time, dressed her in clean clothes, and laid her against her chest.
“I know, love. I’m sorry.” Narcissa replied with a pout, “Your father and I had to ask them to make their rounds with us a bit sooner. The linen traders are coming this afternoon instead, so we’ll be spending that time selecting the tablecloths and the napkins and the draperies……”
A spoiled only child, Draco Malfoy was not used to being denied what he wanted, and what he wanted was for Harriet to return his feelings, acknowledge the fact that they were mates, and let him be a part of his child’s life.
Little Scorpius had no idea about the magnitude at which he was being spoiled, but Harriet surmised that she would have to curtail Lucius and Narcissa’s doting at a point…….the last thing she wanted was for her son to grow to be as vile as Draco had been in his adolescence.
Harriet had never imagined that she would end up in the arms of Draco Malfoy and she honestly didn’t understand why she had.
As she admired the quality of the garment, she realized that Draco meant for it to be a very special evening, indeed.
—————————————————————-
“What’s the matter with her?” Hermione asked while the midwife and the healer parted Harriet’s legs.
Draco reached out and let his elegant fingers ghost along his wife’s tender glands, scowling as he cruelly pinched the rosy tips that fattened under his tantalizing attention.
“Biscuits and quail make him that happy?” Lucius asked sarcastically as his eyes scanned over the food on the table.
She didn’t want to wake him, but she was filled with an anxious energy.
All she needed to do was find it. That sound, that high-pitched whizzing, that minuscule golden streak in all of the commotion, that’s what she needed to do.
“I wish you wouldn’t look so grim.” Harriet said with a wry smile, referring to the melancholy frown that was plastered on Draco’s face.
All Draco was interested in hearing was that somehow, some way, his lover and their baby would be alright.
House elves had many tasks, some more pleasant than others, but transporting giggling babies was always an elf favorite.
“...........Do you want it to be?” Draco smirked.
The bed was a mess, Harriet had pulled his clothes and blankets and a few other soft things to make it into…….to make it into……
Did that receptionist not understand that she was working in the emergency department?!
The door opened slowly and a small, frightened house elf peered inside the room.
Draco remembered seeing two nurses walk past, laughing and giggling with each other as if they didn’t have a care in the world while his world fell apart.
The furniture was ornate.
The sheets came next and then the blankets were thrown on top, only the softest that the Malfoys owned, of course.
Draco loyally accompanied his wife to her appointment with her midwife during the first week of her seventh month.
Narcissa smiled widely and grabbed Lucius’s hand, which earned her a scowl from her alpha.
As soon as his grey eyes cracked open and he saw Harriet lying on her back with her hands covering her belly, he sat bolt upright in bed and demanded, “Potter?!?”
A part of Harriet was foolishly worried that her friends may resent her son or daughter due to their paternity, but as Hermione gazed down at Harriet’s son and he gazed at her with his adorable, huge eyes, a warm, genuine smile lit up her face.
“No.” Draco hissed in an irritated tone, vexed that the man had spoken and interrupted his special second with Harriet, “No rings.”
Harriet cradled Draco’s head in her lap as worried tears filled her eyes while some of the attending faculty hurried to get medical help on the scene.
“I saw a photograph of them.” Draco replied, “They’re only muggles, I can find them with a tracking spell.”
He hoped that Harriet would continue to acknowledge him as her true mate.
He didn’t dare look over at Lucius and Narcissa to see their expressions of mortification.
Harriet pulled the covers up over herself and Draco stood to answer his door with a frown on his face.
Narcissa didn’t care that it was Harriet Potter her son had chosen, she was only glad that he had taken a mate and so kindly made her a grandmother~.
Harriet opened her emerald eyes when the sunlight fell across her face as it drifted over the soft bed where she and Draco lay.
Was his dream really that unreasonable?
Draco noticed she was bald with large, green eyes.
Many toddlers had a favorite word, oftentimes that was “no”.
In some places, they reached the ceiling.
The primal groan that left the blonde’s lips made Harry frown but all Draco felt was pain and anger as she bore down.
“I promise, as soon as the baby’s born and you feel up to it again, I’ll claim you as much as you like~.” Draco smirked.
She had heard plenty of stories about what omegas endured, but she wasn’t entirely certain about what to expect.
“Don’t you think it’s about time?” Lucius asked sharply as his grey eyes narrowed disapprovingly at what he could see of Harriet’s belly over the table.
Harriet blinked as Draco reached out.
“But, sweetheart, your letter said you had gotten her back, that she was staying here.” Narcissa frowned incredulously at Draco.
Ron held his second daughter in his arms and Draco cradled his little son in his.
On one particular morning, Draco traveled to Hogsmeade on a quest to pick up his mother’s order from Honeydukes.
It would have been impossible to surprise him otherwise.
As uncomfortable and unsightly as the end was, Draco was happy that Harriet’s body hadn’t had any problems resuming its natural rhythms once she stopped taking her pills.
Draco was surprised when he quickly followed his love into unconsciousness, cradling her on his shoulder while they both dozed in the warm light of the afternoon.
He immediately sat bolt upright in bed and threw the covers off of himself. With his eyes wide, Draco dashed down the hallway and threw open the door to his bedroom.
“Excellent work, Mr. Malfoy!” The instructor said with a bright smile, “Everytime I make my rounds through class, you’re always doing such a good job supporting your omega!”
Instead of carrying their purchases around with them, Draco arranged to have their newly bought wares delivered to an address that several prominent wizarding families used for such purposes, with the intent of sparing their homes from discovery.
Once Draco’s letter was destroyed, Harriet walked into the kitchen and let the ashes fall from her hand into the rubbish bin.
“You nearly woke the whole house! Harriet needs her rest!” Draco snapped.
“Let’s go see Mummy, shall we?” Draco asked Lily and Narcissa excitedly.
Draco kissed down her jaw line and opened his mouth to clamp down on the sensitive, inner area of Harriet’s neck and shoulder.
A small amount of her appetite gradually returned on its own. Draco breathed a sigh of relief when Harriet started to eat more than the bare minimum of what was necessary to survive.
Draco felt his trousers grow even tighter as he watched Harriet lie there and wait for him, with one hand wrapped protectively around her belly and one across her her heavy breasts that heaved with the movement of her chest.
But that didn’t happen.
Draco moaned at the sudden, satisfying feeling of that terrible pressure being mercifully released.
When Harriet was finished at last, she sat back, trembling and bewildered.
“Arrive where?” Harriet blinked.
The couple entered The Three Broomsticks and were discreetly shown to a private table in a deserted portion of the pub.
Draco frowned as Harriet draped her arms over his shoulders and nuzzled into his neck.
Later in the first week of Harriet’s stay at Malfoy manor, Draco woke to a loud scream.
“You two know Potter better than anyone else.” Draco went on, “I need you to tell me how I should propose to her.”
After Draco read the owl’s letter and learned that his darling Harriet was being transported to the hospital, his heart dropped into his stomach.
Harriet protested Draco’s every advance, Draco’s every flirtation, but even while she put up a fuss, she never took the obvious steps available to her as a means of repelling him either.
She thought back about how to win….
Harriet gasped as she looked over at Draco and to her bewilderment, loud pops rang out around the room as the guests that had been invited for the memorable moment arrived right on time.
Harriet held onto her patience.
Lucius and Narcissa looked on in horror as their son removed the knowledge of his impending fatherhood from each of the reporters’ minds.
Draco was as furious as he was frightened and without a word, he silently crept back down the hall. As he entered his bedroom, his pulse quickened when he found Harriet sitting up in bed and blinking at him.
Harriet knew that the Malfoy heir would have no interest in mass-produced, cheap, plastic goods, no matter how practical those things were for a baby. She had been careful to choose an area with shops of which Draco may reluctantly approve. Everything in the boutiques carried a heavy price tag and everything was of the utmost quality.
Draco bent forward and gave Harriet a gentle hug in her sleep. He blinked when she whimpered and cuddled into him.
Much later that morning, Draco and Harriet both finally woke up. Draco’s eyes opened first but Harriet’s did the same a few moments later.
The midwife swaddled the baby quickly, but Draco’s eyes narrowed once he got a closer look at his infant.
Did she call his name?
“Good morning, love.” Draco cooed to his omega while she reluctantly opened her bright, green eyes.
As Harriet was pulled off of her listless, unresponsive alpha so Madam Pomfrey and an attending nurse could begin to administer emergency care for him, all Harriet could think about was Draco.
—————————————————————
Draco Malfoy had fathered an heir.
To Harriet’s regret, Draco didn’t seem to be all that enthused with the prospect as he looked down at their intertwined fingers and wondered, “But you were in heat……..”
“Good.” Draco replied with a small, arrogant smile, “I need you both to help me with something.”
He had taken the classes, he was ready, but the sudden gush of fluids that burst from Harriet and soaked his pants still took him by surprise to an embarrassing degree.
The Cesarean section video made Draco regret his decision to come to the muggles for help with preparing to meet his baby.
His bed, usually expertly made with the finest sheets and duvet available, was rumpled and messy.
Surely he had found the pictures, but Harriet thought he would come back right after seeing them?
The doctor nodded, took the wand off of Harriet, cleaned her patient’s belly, switched off the machine, and stood with a nod, “Give me a moment and I’ll have your pictures ready.”
When Harriet and Hermione were finally alone, the two women gazed at each other and both of them gasped with tears welling in their eyes as Hermione rushed forward and gently sat on the side of the bed.
He knew it.
Harriet thought it felt lovely after so many years of loneliness and sadness, to lie there with her alpha, no matter who he was, to be held close by someone who loved her, someone she loved. It felt so lovely in fact, that Harriet could scarcely believe it was real as she listened to Draco’s steady heartbeat.
Harriet stayed silent and looked away.
It certainly made the omega feel better that her mate still found her desirable.
The midwife was standing over her, with the top of her wand against Harriet’s covered belly. As his paternal instincts raged, it was all Draco could do not to slap the midwife’s tool away from Harriet.
Draco fell silent.
“Much better.” Harriet nodded as she slowly stood from the bed, “Thanks, love.”
“Do you think I’m that dull, Potter?” Draco scoffed.
Shuffling noises took over the room while the class’s instructor popped the video tape into the vcr.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Draco said nothing in response, but Harriet felt him bristle at her words.
Draco placed his letter in an envelope, sealed it with the Malfoy family crest, and sent it with one of many Malfoy owls.
A house elf appeared at the end of the long hallway and as soon as Draco saw the familiar family servant, he ran towards the elf as Draco called out, “Go and sit with your grandparents at the table! Mummy and I will be right there!”
A moment of silence passed before Harriet asked quietly, “..........May I go home now?”
“Sorry, love.” Draco apologized when Harriet turned to take the trousers from his hands when she had a place ready to put them.
Seeking to protect his suffering mate, Draco stood from his chair and crawled onto the bed.
Draco knew they weren’t together, that Harriet didn’t want him, but that still didn’t remove the pain of hearing her say that out loud to others.
Draco had been terrified that Harriet would push him away, no longer needy for his touch.
“Their clothes are perfectly fine for muggles, that’s what muggles wear. Not that I expect you to know that, though.” Harriet replied.
While Harriet drifted off, she knew that Draco couldn’t guard her entirely from the pains of labor or the responsibilities that came with becoming a mother.
It was much lovelier to hold Harriet than it was to hold his pillow and dream of her instead~.
Harriet stood and looked at the cashier as if the woman had assaulted her.
Harriet had never been displeased with any of their encounters before, but there was something about lying there in her nest, flushed and sore and needy, able to feel Draco’s strong arms around her and his breath on her neck while he used all of his strength to give her what she craved………
“You look stunning, love.” Draco purred as he cleared his throat.
He must be lying in a candy shop, somewhere.
Both of the young women shared a laugh and Harriet asked Hermione, “How have you been feeling?”
It was Draco’s wide smile that triggered Harriet to return that same look of blissful happiness.
A loud pop rang out from downstairs in the foyer and the sound quieted Draco.
Harriet noticed that Hermione had let go of her and Narcissa had stopped rubbing her back as their attention became focused on something other than her.
Harriet noticed something.
Once his suit jacket was in place, he reached out his hand to Harriet and asked, “Well, Potter? Are you ready to marry me?”
Draco’s blonde head slammed into the side of the stadium so violently that the sound echoed across the stadium.
Draco feared that Harriet was probably relieved to see him leave.
That took a lot of effort, but Hermione was up to the task.
“Is that all I am to you, Father? Your failed son, now a chance for ‘wonderful publicity’?! Potter and I aren’t engaged!” Draco exclaimed in exasperation.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
A smirk danced across his face as Harriet let out an exasperated sigh and he dared to plant sweet kisses along her jawline.
Harriet rose from the sofa and embraced Hermione in a warm but gentle hug as she whispered excitedly, “Congratulations!”
Harriet hadn’t forgotten that.
Draco looked at Harriet for a moment and she cleared her throat before she asked hesitantly, “Would……..would you like to come with me?”
Draco’s head snapped over towards the bed and he blinked at Harriet, who was sitting up against the pillows, already holding their little baby against her breasts once again.
He jumped as a loud noise rang out in the room and a blurry figure appeared on the screen.
Harriet didn’t complain and it did comfort her greatly to see the fierce determination in his eyes.
As slowly and quietly as she could, she left the bathroom and stepped out into the bedroom.
By early evening, Harriet was struck by such a white-hot surge of agony, that she ended up on the floor, perched on all fours and keening like an animal. She had shed her clothing long ago and as Draco kneaded at her back while she moaned and spread her hips, he wondered if it was time for him to go ahead and call the medical staff back in.
“I know, I know, my love…...I’m sorry, that was inconsiderate of me. I’ll return all of this and we’ll start over, alright? You can make all of the decisions.” Draco coaxed as he kissed Harriet’s cheek.
Considering how far Draco had come with Harriet in a few days, he calculated that was more than enough time to win his mate’s heart.
Draco inhaled through his mouth as he tried to steady himself. His voice came out like a strangled growl when he asked, “Potter……..are you…are you…....in heat?”
Draco insisted that the classes were beneficial for them and that they kept Harriet active.
“Wonderful.” Narcissa replied with a smirk that was reminiscent of Draco’s, “He’s going to have the best engagement party ever.”
The promise of more sleep was discarded as Draco sat up against the headboard and carefully but quickly scooped Harriet into his lap.
Trapped there in his omega’s nest, focusing his efforts on pleasing her and helping his uncomfortable mate relax……..squeezed to breathlessness by the tender flesh of her creamy thighs…..it wasn’t the worst death that Draco had ever imagined for himself.
His brow creased with worry as he watched Harriet sleep fitfully in her nest.
—————————————————————
It didn’t bother Harriet that Draco’s family looked at her, they had always looked at her, but the expression in their cold eyes was different now.
She knew her alpha was about to make love to her and she wanted as badly as he did.
He did look weary, but the soft smile on his face also seemed…...happy?
Draco did not appreciate the ominous, threatening tones his letters were written in compared with the sweet words of concern that embellished Harriet’s parcels.
Narcissa certainly didn’t approve of her son’s chosen mate, but she would rather he be united with his love than as miserable as he had looked a few moments earlier.
Draco blinked as the doctor closed the door but when he felt Harriet squeeze his hand, he turned towards her.
By the third day of Harriet’s heat, Draco had accepted his duties and the tumultuous schedule that an omega in her condition kept.
Although they did exchange a fair amount of banter, both always enjoyed their conversations.
She squeezed Draco’s hand tightly and she smiled through her joyful weeping when a choked sob tore itself from Draco’s throat despite his tremendous effort to contain the noise.
“Nothing.” Harriet whispered in aggravation as she took one of her hands off of Scorpius and clumsily wiped at her eyes, “...........I’m fine.”
“I suppose…..” Scorpius replied with a sigh, “I was very busy playing with the pixies in the trees though…....”
A soft groan of disappointment left Harriet’s lips as Draco slowly released her tender breasts from his warm hands, but holding them just wasn’t enough for the smitten alpha. Harriet sighed as she felt Draco pull the thin straps of her nightdress down to openly expose her magnificently swollen glands to his view.
“...........Fine?” Harriet cautiously responded.
“There’s no need.” Harriet said as she yawned and pulled the covers over herself, “Gryffindor will win.”
Did he enjoy seeing her in so much pain?
“Take me, Draco.” Harriet whimpered, gasping for breath as her nipples rubbed obscenely against the insides of his fingers with the rise and fall of her heaving chest, “I need you~.”
Later, when Harriet finally opened her green eyes and blinked up Draco from where she lay on his chest, he smiled gently.
Lucius scowled at Draco.
They were so round and lovely that Draco felt himself throb at the sight.
There was one particular shot that Draco liked best~.
She stopped bursting into tears and throwing emotional tantrums.
Draco turned back to Harriet and the wedding officiant nodded.
This was all wrong.
“Sorry, Potter, I couldn’t resist.” Draco shrugged, “You looked too gorgeous there for a moment. I just had to have a taste~.”
Draco had been a wonderful aid to her recovery but his scrupulous attention couldn’t completely erase the aches of pregnancy.
Draco curled on her side and tried to breathe.
Draco could still taste the dirt from the field in his mouth as he slowly and painfully returned to consciousness in a dimly lit room.
Draco immediately began his search for the efforts to win his prize.  The crowd from Slytherin’s section roared as he whizzed past, but Harriet found herself being humbled.
“That’s what happens to pregnant omegas.” He said, with an unusual warmth in his voice, as he kissed Harriet’s cheek, “How are you feeling now?”
Harriet moved away from the mirror and entered an empty stall. Instead of swallowing any of the pills, Harriet let them fall from her hand into the toilet, which she promptly flushed.
“Sorry, can you give me just a moment?” Draco said hurriedly to the man at the counter, as Harriet stepped forward to the register and nearly threw her galleons at the clerk.
It was over.
Oh yes, her nightmare…...
The man stared at Draco incredulously but Draco saw sympathy in his gaze.
As Harriet’s second heat came to a slow and gentle close, she lamented the fact that it may be months or years before she had the opportunity to spend such primally intimate moments with Draco again.
“Congratulations to you both! Oh, Draco, love, how exciting! I can’t wait to be a grandmother!” Narcissa beamed, then she turned to Harriet and asked urgently, “Harriet, dear…...how far along are you?”
Baby Malfoy
Maybe Draco wouldn’t be opposed to a little getaway with her?
Draco’s stomach was a sloshing pit of mortal dread.
Kisses and hands covered her belly reverently, after they had trailed down her side and over her arms and legs.
Special setting?
“I can brew some fertility potion for us~.” Draco mused as he slipped his hand away from Harriet’s and pulled her into his loving grasp.
He monitored everything that he and Harriet ate.
—————————————————————
Harriet blinked as she prepared to respond but Draco didn’t give her the chance.
On top of bonding with each other and raising their baby, they had a very large and very magnificent wedding to put together.
If Harriet saw what awaited them in the dining room, if their story was smeared all over the front page of the Prophet, it would be over between them.
Harriet could wait until the birth but she saw the curious delight glittering in her alpha’s grey eyes and she nodded silently to give her permission.
Draco smiled bitterly to himself as he marveled over the fact that he wasn’t surprised his mate was already up and gone for the day.
Draco watched in awed horror.
Really, based off Rose’s current appearance, since she lacked Hermione or Ron’s hair, her parents could have been several people…...her mother could have even been Harriet~.
Narcissa saw Harriet on the bed, hunched over with a hand on the side of her abdomen.
Draco glared right back at the healer but he reluctantly stood and obeyed. Perhaps he had overestimated just how lovely it was to have an old fashioned family healer after all.
—————————————————————
Narcissa frowned as she thought about the frown on Draco’s face.
Two weeks went by and there was still no change, however, Harriet’s hours did increase at work and for that, she was grateful.
During her time with the Malfoys, she had become surprisingly close to Narcissa, and while it seemed like a good idea at first glance to advise Draco to spurn his parents’ help, reject tradition, and do things entirely differently, Harriet could understand how such actions would come across as…….terribly rude.
Draco’s owl was indeed able to deliver his letters to Harriet. With little difficulty, the bird had located the flat in Hogsmeade that Harriet had rented.
Narcissa Malfoy recalled that same feeling herself on a warm June evening nearly nineteen years ago……….
It was Draco who flushed the toilet and helped her clean up.
Draco watched while she rummaged around in the pocket of her robes and took out a photograph.
“I’m not ill at all.” Harriet huffed.
“I’ll see you this evening!” Harriet called to her husband as she apparated away.
Draco’s face lit up in a smile as soon as he heard the sweet little voices cry out, “Daddy!”
Despite her previous reluctance, Draco’s omega understood that the fact she had birthed his son would become public knowledge at some point, with or without her consent.
It was an unspoken, mutual agreement between the two of them that they were comfortable going public with their relationship at last.
The healer ignored Draco and Harriet’s disagreement as she sat her bag down.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
She and Draco both had forgotten to draw the curtains the night before, but as Harriet sat up in bed and watched the sunrise, she was genuinely glad about their mistake.
Every nappy, every onesie was folded, stored, and in place, patiently awaiting the one who would use them.
“Potter….er, Harriet Potter…..” Draco began as he looked up into Harriet’s green eyes and pulled out a black, velvet ring box from his suit.
Harriet’s face lit up in a bright smile as she saw the swell of her friend’s pregnant belly.
The alpha sought to give his darling a peaceful place to labor in, and so, after he closed the curtains and made sure the room was warm but not too warm, he crawled into the nest and cuddled Harriet up with him.
“She’s looking right at me.” Draco panted, “.....I don’t think Scorpius really opened his eyes for most of his first day.”
“So we’re going out, then?” Harriet asked.
Anxious excitement danced in his grey eyes, but he concealed it well from Harriet.
Draco watched his pregnant omega roll over with a scowl and his fear heightened.
Harriet blew out a breath before she reached up and grasped his palm.
“Probably more than I should~.” Harriet replied as she leaned in to kiss her alpha sweetly on his lips.
“Good morning, Potter.” Draco smirked at his omega for a moment. He paused to admire how beautiful she looked before he bent his head and placed a kiss on the curve of her belly, “Good morning, my little one.”
“That’s it…that’s it......good girl.” Draco commended Harriet with a gentle smile of reassurance.
“And your eyes are closed in this one. He must get that from you, Potter.” Draco remarked as he pushed another picture over to the side as well.
Harriet looked over at Draco with a pout.
Dobby yelped and grabbed Scorpius by the hand before he darted down the hallway with the little boy, hurrying to take him outside and play just as Harry Potter had requested.
In his mind, all Draco could only hear the scuffling, the shuffling, and the conflicting, shouted orders from the medical team as they tended his darling omega.
Before she could use any magic, Draco asked her incredulously, “Where do you think you’re going?”
As the wedding officiant opened his mouth to declare Harriet and Draco officially married, Draco leaned forward and captured his wife in his hands, dipping her for a deep kiss as shocked gasps issued from the audience.
Harriet’s hair had always reminded him of burning embers and he enjoyed that very much.
As he walked down the long, dark hallway of Malfoy manor, he pondered the different ways he could approach his current situation.
Unfortunately, as soon as Harriet was sitting on her bottom, another deep pain began and she whimpered. The midwife smiled softly while Draco let Harriet brace herself against him and hold his hands for support.
“It’s nothing too formal. Your father and I just thought we could share a family meal.” Narcissa said with a shrug.
She contemplated asking Narcissa, but she had been assured by her care team at St. Mungo’s that it was safe to apparate, even in the late stages of pregnancy.
She couldn’t get him to let go of her hand either.
“Could have at least brought the little tyke along.” Ron said with a frown, “I haven’t even gotten to meet him yet.”
Three days.
She laughed until Draco managed to maneuver her shirt down low enough and find her breasts with his mouth.
“-I can have anything you want to eat or drink brought to us right here.” Draco said as he smoothly interrupted his omega.
As soon as Harriet took her hands away from her face, Draco dove in for a kiss. It was a deep, romantic kiss and he cupped Harriet’s face with one hand while he snaked the other down to cradle her belly protectively.
————————————————————-
Draco and the Potter girl?
Draco had been honest with Harriet.
Harriet’s attention was called away when Draco announced, in a voice that was to his humiliation, choked with tears, “We have a son, Potter.”
He couldn’t detect it in his mate’s scent, but as he walked over, slid into the nest beside her, and held her in his arms, he could feel it…….something was very, very wrong.
He hoped that he hadn’t imagined the strides he felt they had made in their relationship.
“These are women’s matters.” Healer Marigold snapped. She opened up her bag and pointed towards the door, throwing a glare at Draco as she ordered him without hesitation, “Out!”
And the night before……..
Harriet sighed when Draco raised himself up and kissed her shoulder gently.
The photographer completed his work relatively quickly.
—————————————————————
Draco watched the baby start to whine, push his little face against his chest, and he realized it was time to return his son to his mate.
He knew that Harriet had felt it too, that connection between them when he took her as his mate…….
Draco groaned in response.
The lid came off of the box and Draco tossed it carelessly onto the top of his desk before he peered inside at the box’s contents.
Lucius and Narcissa were due to return home very soon. Both were eager to be present for the arrival of their secret grandchild. Harriet paid little attention to that fact. As Draco’s son or daughter grew heavier, she had really started to notice the increased strain on her spine.
When her fingers ghosted below his belt, Draco growled and flinched, but he grasped Harriet’s hand in his own before she could let her touch any further.
Glares and sneers somehow boiled into passion that night and led to Draco pressing the Potter girl firmly against a stone wall.
“Good morning, Harriet. It’s nice to meet you! My name is Dr. Krause, I’ll be doing your ultrasound today.” The physician smiled at her patient, glancing down at the omega’s chart before her eyes moved to Draco, “I see you have a guest with you!”
They were careful to keep their voices hushed and their steps quiet so they wouldn’t wake their little boy, but Harriet and Draco walked over to the canopy bed that held their nest and together, they snuggled under the multitude of blankets.
With his mother, Hermione, the midwife, and the healer waiting outside, Draco was finally free to see to Harriet’s needs.
“Would you like to…..would you like to feel?” Harriet asked Narcissa slowly.
She smiled at the additional scented candles that lit themselves as she moved along.
“I’m sorry I troubled you last night.” Harriet apologized as she cleared her throat.
Four?
Thump-Thump
—————————————————————
When Rose cried in the night, by the time Harriet stood up and walked down the hall into the guest room they had placed her in, Draco was already pacing the floor with the little baby bundled in his arms.
He had been hoping the healer would say that there was some harmless, simple explanation, that Harriet’s episode wasn’t anything more than an abrupt rush of anxiety.
The door burst open and Harry charged across the room. He didn’t look worried but when he saw the state his bride was in, he seemed surprised and…...focused.
As they laid together, both of them wore frowns that neither could see.
The wide, toothless grins he got from his twins  in response were all he needed for reassurance.
The bag was already packed, they could be at the hospital in a moment.
“It’s too fast……” Draco exhaled.
His~.
Ron nodded as well but his mouth was too full for him to speak.
Harriet looked at Draco standing in front of her, handsome, strong, commanding…... It made her heart flutter in her chest.
“Relax……….Focus on your breathing.”
Was this how his mother’s care had gone before his own arrival?
She threw her alpha one last glance before she picked up the box, which was unwieldy but incredibly light in weight, and walked into the bathroom.
His stay with Harriet at Siren’s Slip was splendid.
Harriet laughed out loud at her alpha’s snide remark.
“Do you not have anyone else to ask about this?” Ron blinked.
Harriet’s thoughts were called away by the teacher’s voice, “Alright, class! Today we’re going to see something a little different! If you have a weak stomach, I implore you to turn away when you need to do so. This is my fourth week with you all and we’ve managed to go over quite a bit of information.”
The machine Dr. Krause had turned on began to beep and whir as it loaded the computer program she was going to use. Draco grabbed Harriet’s hand again and in his seat, he crouched beside her as he watched Dr. Krause wash her hands and dispense some kind of clear fluid on a towel as she moved towards his mate.
—————————————————————-
Harriet frowned as she wondered…...wasn’t it a bit too early to be thinking about schools?
Of course Draco had missed mating with his omega, but that wasn’t really why he was so painfully wanting and sweet that night.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
“DRACO!” Harriet screamed as she hovered over the ground, jumped off her broom, and ran towards her husband, “DRACO!”
On her back, on her side, up against a wall, Draco didn’t care what position he had Harriet in, as long as he was able to invade her sensitive center and she enjoyed it, that was all that mattered to him.
The baby cooed at his grandmother softly and Narcissa lovingly pulled the blanket he was wrapped in a bit tighter around his miniature frame.
While Draco watched, Harriet undid the knotted sash on her robe and let the garment slip off her shoulders to fall effortlessly on the floor.
—————————————————————-
“Alright.” Harriet replied with a deep sigh.
Undeterred, Draco pressed his forehead against hers and whispered, “I know that you care for me too….and our little one.” His gentle voice was even softer as he splayed both of his hands over Harriet’s tummy that proudly protruded between them, “We can live every day like this, you and I…..and our son or daughter. No more wars, no more pain, no more-“
Scorpius’s grey eyes widened.
When I carried you….
Under Draco’s intoxicating affection, Harriet dropped her guard for a moment and revelled in the feeling of lying in her alpha’s arms, safe and secure.
“NO.” Harriet stated flatly.
“G….mornin’.......” Harriet mumbled while she yawned sleepily.
Draco instantly pulled back. His grey eyes were narrowed in rage as he hissed, “Damn it, Potter! Why are you being so obstinate?!”
When Scorpius started to fuss, Harriet moved to stand from the bed, but Draco quickly sat up and stopped her.
Narcissa blinked as her husband chased after their son with his black cloak swirling behind him as he stalked out of the room.
Harriet wasn’t in the mood yet to face her friends again. She wasn’t ready to sit down and give them a long explanation about what had happened and what was happening……..the omega was still processing that herself.
Once Harriet was dressed and ready, she sat down for a few minutes and closed her eyes in silence.
Draco’s grey eyes were full of hurt and confusion but he obeyed his omega’s wishes and turned his attention towards the screen.
Harriet was ready to spend a quiet afternoon with her husband, but she learned that he had other plans.
“Why didn’t you take me to the hospital?!” Harriet asked groggily, raising a hand to her head.
“Fine, brilliant.” Harriet said hastily, “And you two?”
The healers had said intimacy was allowable as long as she felt well enough for it.
A couple of days later, after Harriet had again given him her permission, Draco apparated to his office to retrieve a few files and several documents that he could review while he sat with Harriet.
They were only boxes!
Surely it had been a long time since the last pain, right?
—————————————————————
The next morning, her heat crashed into her like a tidal wave.
She was already Mrs. Malfoy.
He could only use the sparse, fleeting moments of spare time he had every day to conduct his investigation, but eventually, his efforts became worthwhile.
Eventually, Harriet sighed and began to plead, “Draco, I-“
She put her hand to her throbbing head and inhaled in an attempt to ease the intense pain.
Draco’s handsome face was still twisted as he snapped back, “-She can, actually. My mate is more than capable of seeing to our son’s needs. Stand back, both of you! If she needs your help, she’ll ask for it!”
Narcissa and Lucius exchanged a look of unsatisfied surprise.
She looked over at Draco and grinned.
“Potter!” Draco called out as Harriet looked over and reached her hand out towards him.
“Mother! Father!” He cried, his face a mask of angst, “I need you!”
“I’ve done no such thing!” Draco scoffed, “I came to escort you to the paternity test, wherever that will take place......and I found you unconscious in that shabby little flat of yours, with which I was very disappointed, Potter. I imagined you would still have enough left of your father’s gold to afford something better….Anyway, I saw you weren’t well and when I was unable to rouse you, I brought you here.”
“Harriet’s going to be a Malfoy!” Ron exclaimed to Hermione in disgust.
Harriet……..through the many, moving bodies dressed in white, shouting orders back and forth, Draco caught a glimpse of his unconscious mate lying limp on the hospital bed like a defeated rag doll.
The healer’s question was unnecessary, he knew of Lucius’s son.
After dropping his bombshells on his unsuspecting parents, Draco quickly left the lavish Malfoy dining room with a tortured sigh.
The guests all broke out in smiles and happy chuckles as Draco stepped forward again.
“I’m sorry……...I honestly didn’t mean to make it any more difficult. Can you forgive me?” Draco asked as he kissed the top of Harriet’s head.
Draco lifted an arm to cover his squinting eyes from the blinding cameras. Without hesitation, he raised his wand in his other hand and set to work.
“I now pronounce you, man and wife.” The man declared quietly, hoping not to break the reverence between the newlyweds, “You may kiss and make your union known.”
Everyone knew that most years, either Gryfindor or Slytherin won the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. Everyone also knew that those two houses shared the fiercest rivalry at Hogwarts and that was what everyone counted on to make the day’s game entertaining.
Narcissa nodded back in silent response before she turned and walked away.
“I’m hungry too. Let’s continue our day, shall we? Perhaps you could show me something muggles like to eat.” Draco suggested, “Is there anything that you’d prefer right now?”
Draco looked at her with his brow furrowed and something in his expression made Harriet force back the tears that threatened to gather in her eyes, choosing to squeeze his hands instead.
Their love was real.
Draco imagined that it must be very tiring to carry a Malfoy baby.
His wife’s tears weren’t something that Draco Malfoy was very used to encountering.
Draco’s face lit up in a smile when he heard the sweet little voices simultaneously cry out, “Daddy!”
When Draco’s spell ended, Harriet came back to him with a great cry and she fell against him once more as she wept to purge the last bit of crisis from her soul.
The worry was still on Draco’s face as he watched his omega cuddle against him and close her eyes very tightly as if she were trying to escape from some disturbing mental image.
Draco was surprised when he made it back to his bedroom and found Harriet already awake from her nap, sitting up in bed. His omega seemed to be eagerly anticipating his return as her green eyes landed on him when he stepped into the room.
“I know.” Harriet replied, clutching Lily’s hand in hers while the little girl looked around the busy train platform and blinked curiously. Harriet held her composure while she explained, “I’m proud of him, that’s all.”
Over the secretary’s shoulder, Draco peered into the room and as he did, the scene in front of him broke his heart.
Draco frowned while he brushed his teeth.
Draco heard the door to their bedroom close as Harry left and a moment later, from down the hallway, she smiled softly as she listened to Scorpius’s sweet little voice chatting to his father.
He smiled as he ran.
To tease her further though, Draco pulled back from their kiss and whispered against her lips, “Don’t you want to be here with me, my darling~?”
…..Who he came from?
Harriet calmly led Draco out of the alley and past the span of buildings to enter the medical center.
“That’s exactly why I sent it.” Harriet said with a sigh as she rubbed her hands over her face.
The damask estate was covered in banners and balloons.
Sandwiched between his parents, Scorpius squealed with delight and Hermione wiped away tears as she watched the happy couple embrace.
“I don’t want a healer.” Harriet murmured, “I’m fine.”
“Why are you crying?” Draco asked softly.
“Are you going to cast the charm?” Harriet asked as Draco smirked and moved in to capture her lips.
Harriet saw it, but only for a second.
She hadn’t because she really wanted Draco to step in and save her, to be there for her, to be a father to their child, for them to raise the baby together…...
The quaffle and bludgers were released and the game finally began.
Draco frowned at his father and blinked, unsure of what would be the acceptable answer, “...........the imperious curse?”
Harriet said nothing to Draco about her excursion but she was bursting with excitement to hand him the finished product.
When he saw that Harriet was finished with her nightly routine, he called out, “Do you really want to shut me up, Potter?”
Harriet quickly put her hand back up to her face to wipe away the fresh batch of tears that sprung to her eyes against her will.
That struck him as odd.
Draco grit his teeth as a dastardly smirk curled his lips and he contented himself by replaying in his mind the spitefulness the receptionist had shown him.
In Ron’s arms, Scorpius giggled.
Draco scowled at his mother incredulously, “Thank you……..we’ll, um, we’ll be along very shortly. She’s napping, just now.”
“Draco!” Harriet snapped.
That wasn’t true.
People complimented her in the hallways at the Ministry and she masked her suffering with polite nods and falsely happy smiles.
Draco capitalized on that statement as he hissed in reply, “Then surely, Mr. Roberts, you can understand my pain! Would you not do the same if one of your children was trapped in a similar situation?”
“I can’t help it, my love. I’m your mate, it’s my job to fuss over you…….I’m your alpha, and this is my, our, pup.” Draco whispered.
Draco closed the door and glanced over to Harriet. When he saw the covers over her head, he assumed she had fallen back asleep and he walked into the bathroom.
—————————————————————
Draco couldn’t bury his emotions any longer.
“I…..I don’t know.” Harriet stammered.
When Scorpius cried in the night, Draco always beat Harriet to their son’s cribside.
And she was no longer in her apartment…….
While Harriet and Draco enjoyed their mating cycle, Lucius and Narcissa kept a respectful distance on their side of the house.
It was an odd thing, life.
The muggle doctor had been kind and she had taken good care of his mate and pup. Such good care in fact, that Draco could almost forgive her for her mistake…...Dr. Krause had called him and Harriet by the wrong last name.
Harriet paused for a second to collect her thoughts.
The elevator doors opened and Harriet stepped out, but behind her, Draco clutched onto the machine’s walls with his arms spread and his grey eyes wide.
Draco’s father tried not to think about the technical mechanics of what his son was doing with the Potter girl, but Narcissa decided not to focus on the gory details of her son’s…...private life.
On Tuesday evenings, Draco and Harriet attended their childbirth class.
“I’m talking to Rose, of course.” Harriet replied, turning her attention back to the child in her arms when she felt the baby start to wriggle in her grasp.
Harriet thought Draco’s hunger that night was because he had missed their intimacy, that must have been why he clung to her so desperately, that must have been why he kissed her so ravenously.
The omega grit her teeth and squeezed Draco’s arms while she widened her knees and bore down hard, following her instincts’ command.
When Draco saw the bewilderment on Harriet’s face, he grew angry and shouted at the two women attacking his beloved, “STOP!”
Harriet met up with her teammates in the player’s section of the stadium, underneath the stands.
“DRACO!” Harriet cried, “NOOO!”
Harriet folded the baby’s clothes again, Harriet rearranged the plush toys and restacked the bins that were already in straight rows.
It was a bold move and Draco knew that, but he, Ron, and Hermione had discussed it in depth.
“Things are different in the muggle world, Draco. They have medications but the other treatments has to be performed by hand.” Harriet explained.
The nursery had been prepared weeks ago. Nursery or not, wasn’t a single spot in Malfoy manor with a speck of dust or dirt.
Draco had his eyes squinted and his hand outstretched. He was going to catch it, he was going to catch the snitch, end the game, and win himself a baby.
Hidden concern, that’s what Draco heard in Narcissa’s voice.
“SHE’S HERE!” The new father repeated with glee while he watched the midwife hold his child and reach for a towel.
—————————————————————
They laid there for half of the morning, not making love, just cuddling and kissing.
Draco was too exhausted to care anymore about his father’s ideas.
In the aftermath of destruction and pain, hate had blossomed into something entirely different between the two former enemies. Not long after, the handsome, platinum-haired alpha had happily claimed the last surviving Potter as his mate the day that he took her as his wife in a lavish ceremony in front of hundreds of guests.
Headstrong and brazen, Harriet was a very different omega. She insisted that Draco didn’t pout when she had to work late. Aurors rarely kept decent hours and Harriet was particularly hard-working at her career. Draco filled his time studying alchemy and partnering with his father to run the family’s business empire.
Harriet didn’t allow herself to think anything else.
————————————————————
Perhaps he hadn’t recognized her…….
—————————————————————
“I suppose…..” Scorpius replied with a sigh, “I was very busy playing with the pixies in the trees though…....”
“Yes, I need you to calm down and relax. You’re not doing anyone a favor by staring at me.” Harriet replied.
Harriet changed out of her wedding gown into more comfortable traveling clothes while Draco held Scorpius and let the baby pull playfully on his black tie.
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy, but babies arrive on their schedule, not ours. At thirty-seven weeks, your baby should be able to safely arrive if he or she chooses. Labor can start anytime after that point.” The midwife nodded.
“Not even to Malfoy?” George asked with a smirk.
Harriet grabbed hold of him and pulled him closer to her in a frustrated growl, which caused him to laugh in amusement.
A week after the alumni game, he was much better, but still recovering at home.
————————————————————
—————————————————————
Harriet whimpered when his elegant hands kneaded her breasts and his lips wrapped so carefully around her tender nipples.
The classes and the books all mentioned what a delightful, blissful time for Harriet and Draco the first few days of their baby’s life would end up becoming.
“What do you want from me, Draco?” Harriet spat.
Draco looked at Harriet and raised an eyebrow.
“AAAAAGGGHHHH!” Draco cried out, wrapping her hands around her tense belly.
The jewelry salesman could imagine his commission rising and rising!
Harry chatted with Dobby and Scorpius while they all ate a few minutes later, as relaxed as any other morning until a shrill cry ripped through the air.
“......What do you mean?” Draco blinked.
“I am, yes.” Harriet replied with a nod, “I enjoy my job very much.”
His eyes narrowed as he found the entry he sought and stared at the page.
Draco left their bedroom and walked to the Malfoy’s family library.
“Scorpius didn’t come this quickly…….” Draco panted.
Never before had Hermione seen that side of Draco, but she didn’t need to explain that to Ron.
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
It was unfortunate, but in his rush, Draco had gotten sloppy.
Ron and Hermione thanked Harriet and nodded politely at Draco for looking after their small daughter. Harriet waved goodbye to her friends as they walked out of the flat, but Draco stood with a frown on his face.
Anxiously awaiting our new arrival,
Lucius and Narcissa were elated to meet little Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, a name suggested by the infant’s father.
Draco was there with her, on the verge of a tranquil slumber after a night of wonderfully exhaustive love-making…….
Harriet couldn’t hide from him any longer.
She barely heard the barrage of footsteps that came racing down the hall as four different women charged towards the room.
Harriet flashed Draco a grateful smile as she joined him on the sofa and cuddled against him.
Vulnerable and frightened, Harriet may have pushed him away if she wasn’t so upset, but instead, she didn’t protest at all as Draco pulled her into his lap and wrapped his arms lovingly around her.
It didn’t escape Draco’s notice how Harriet dodged his assessment of her true feelings.
Harritet knew she must be ridding her system of everything she had ever eaten in her life as that sickly, cold sweat caused her to tremble.
Harriet’s first noticeable symptom made her pregnancy seem more tangible to both her and Draco.
The trio sat and chatted for hours by the fireplace in the wing of Malfoy where they had been temporarily housed.
Close to dawn, as Harriet laid against Draco’s sweat-dampened chest, she raised a hand up and felt the heat in her cheeks.
Every night, while Harriet snoozed in her cozy little nest composed of Draco’s scent, he laid awake on the opposite end of the hallway, wishing that he could hold her close instead of a pillow.
Clearly, mating wasn’t a bonding experience for omegas only.
—————————————————————
Draco scowled over at Ron but Ron kept looking across the landscape as he refused to meet and return Draco’s hostile glance.
“That’s what I’m counting on, love~.” Draco replied with a wolfish grin as he dove forward and pulled Harriet into his arms.
Dr. Krause opened a drawer under the exam counter that the computer sat on and handed Draco several brochures as she explained, “The hospital gives several free classes every week. You two should attend, most pregnant couples do.”
When he felt eyes on him, Draco halted and looked over at Harriet as he gripped the broomstick.
“Would you like to feel, too?” Harriet asked quietly.
“What baby stores are in the wizarding world?”  Harriet asked with a huff.
As their lovely afternoon melted into a long, luxurious dinner by the fire, Draco and Harriet got a taste of what riding out a heat really entailed.
No more letters.
The couple may have had their opinions asked on a few minor details, but the true mechanics of the operation were being dictated by Lucius, Narcissa, and the worst of everything……..tradition.
“Now, you listen to me, Potter.” Draco said warningly. His voice billowed from his throat in the low, commanding growl with which only an alpha could speak.
Draco flashed Harriet a grin and pressed a tender kiss to her soft lips.
Draco accepted his loss and he hadn’t mentioned anything about it to Harriet, yet he couldn’t free himself from the feeling that he had been……..cheated.
The majority of the alumni present regarded each other with nostalgic rivalry, eager to have fun while they enjoyed an honor that few others had received.
A sly grin of confidence slipped across Draco’s lips.
Somet thought it was sweet.
“What do you mean ‘something more’?” Draco asked as he narrowed his eyes to slits at the healer.
Neither Harriet nor Draco heard the couple allow the reporters from the Daily Prophet to enter the house and set up all of their cameras and media equipment in the Malfoy dining room.
Harriet looked at Draco over the soft mounds of her breasts and she laid a hand gently across her flat belly as she answered his question silently.
“........Alright.” Harriet nodded in reluctant agreement.
Harriet watched as he looked down at their little boy lying in her arms and whispered, “No one will know we’ve left until we’ve already returned.”
An exaggerated pout formed on Scorpius’s pink lips.
Draco pushed his chair back to hide himself so Harriet wouldn’t be able to see the way he tightened his grip on his manhood and stroked himself harder.
In those pictures, Harriet was posed and pouting, smiling and holding her belly, lying back with her creamy thighs exposed, looking right at the camera with her thick, effortlessly tousled hair, calling Draco to reach through the picture and touch her.
Hermione calmly turned back to Draco and scowled at the look of amusement on his pale face as he watched Harriet’s friends interact.
The next three weeks passed by in a tiring but happy haze for the new family.
“I don’t want to leave Scorpius.” Harriet blinked at her sleeping baby as Draco started to walk out of the nursery.
…….that was a heartbeat.
What if she did something wrong?
Harriet appreciated her mate’s loving ways and the love in his actions made the aches, the pains, and the inconveniences that came with late pregnancy worthwhile.
Draco slowly drug himself out of the covers and walked into his marble bathroom to clean up.
Harriet wanted to frown but the way that Draco’s grey eyes smouldered as he glanced from her belly to her face made her smile instead.
Draco marveled at the way her swollen womb had felt under his hands during those brief seconds before she had slapped him away.
“AAAAGGGHHH!” Harriet screamed as she spread her legs wide and bore down.
Langston heard a click on the other end as the phone hit the floor and Harriet tried to hold onto consciousness.
“I see you received your present, love.” Harriet cooed to Draco as she looked at the open box of photos on his desk, next to the picture he held in his hand, “I was genuinely hoping that you’d enjoy your surprise, though perhaps not quite this much.” She finished with a chuckle.
Harriet scowled as she heard that odd sound once more from one of the bedrooms that was close to hers and Draco’s.
Draco wasn’t entirely shocked.
Draco Malfoy
Draco was fascinated by everything that they learned but Harriet was exhausted.
The secretary stepped back and yanked him out of the room.
—————————————————————
“Right, we’ll be off then.” Hermione nodded.
What kind of bakers came to a family’s house at dawn to peddle their products?
But how was he going to get her to say that?
Muggle food that the Malfoy house elves couldn’t prepare.
To assuage Hermione and Ron’s fears, that night, Harriet sat down at Draco’s writing desk, picked up a quill, and penned a reply:
“Not yet.” The midwife said as she turned Harriet onto her side and began to soothingly knead her patient’s back, “If you would though, Mr. Malfoy, please light a candle or two that holds her favorite scent…...and make sure the dawn doesn’t disturb her when the sun rises, mothers labor easier in comfortable, dimly-lit environments.”
“What do you mean?” Draco frowned.
She was weak, light-headed, thirsty, and hungry……
Although Draco remained unmarried, it was clearly evident that he would soon no longer be the youngest Malfoy. Although the obvious implications of the situation seemed to be of no consequence to Healer Marigold.
His hand usually slipped off of her sometime in the wee hours of the morning, only to resume its position as soon as he woke.
Draco’s handsome face was a mask of horrified shock and awe.
She also found the wedding planning frantic and stressful.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter!
Harriet blinked up at Draco and Draco gazed down at her.
His happy smile faded as Harriet became more and more vocal about the unpleasant sensations running through her body, but every time he looked over at the midwife, the healthcare worker kept a calm, relaxed smile on her face.
Draco smiled softly as he watched Harriet close her eyes.
“What is all this? Why are we here?” Harriet asked.
Scorpius, with his belly full and his body warmed by the blankets that Harriet had wrapped him in, had fallen back into the careless, deep sleep in which only infants could partake.
Harriet didn’t break their kiss while she reached between them and vanished her undergarment with a murmur.
They were going to kiss once more.
Shuffling into the living area to answer the muggle phone that Harriet had spelled to work without an outlet, she answered it hesitantly, “.......Hello?”
Harriet felt the area between her legs begin to tingle as Draco’s icy eyes bore into hers.
He watched as Harriet sat up to stretch, careful not to miss the subtle bounce of her breasts or the outline of her small bump that made his chest swell with pride.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Unfortunately for Draco, Lucius and Narcissa assumed the best……...
When Draco lost his battle against his own fatigue, he and Harriet slept side by side through the night, cuddled together.
Harriet didn’t want to voluntarily acknowledge it, but it was rather…...nice, being cared for by an alpha, even in that small way.
“....But it’s what you meant.” Draco determined with a nod.
“Thanks.” Ron replied to Draco sheepishly.
What he had mentioned to Harriet during their languid moments in bed that one morning had been true.
Those other omegas…...the ones that said pregnancy could be difficult…...they were just being dramatic, right?
He was a newborn and as such, he brought all of the challenges that came with his kind, from frequent feedings to messy diapers, but he was a happy, cuddly, little baby that loved to be held and only cried when he was in need of something.
Harriet had forgotten he’d never seen a muggle hospital.
The couple watched the pleased look in her eyes when she saw them both sitting up in bed, wide-eyed, and very awake.
Harriet had pushed her friends away, claiming that she struggled with trauma from the war.
Harriet frowned and rolled onto her side as Draco slipped out of her nest and grabbed his wand, hurrying to send for the midwife.
“-She’s a pregnant omega.” The healer cut in as he interrupted Draco, “Her coworkers who brought her here today spoke to me about how dedicated she is to her job. Perhaps that’s the source of her fatigue, or perhaps her symptoms are a precursor to something more.”
His unborn child.
Draco knew his baby’s arrival was steadily approaching, but he felt a bit…….anxious.
Harriet yawned nonchalantly as Draco scanned over the bullet points and information listed.
Harriet sat on an ebony chair, dressed in a glimmering gown of gold and red, much to Draco’s contempt, while she held little Scorpius on her lap, and Draco stood behind them both, in one of his usual, black suits.
Draco watched the muggle medical staff enter the room, then he watched as they placed a tarp in front of her, and set about their work.
Draco pulled the blankets over herself and shivered in the morning chill as she thought happily about how their little family was growing.
He held his beloved’s well-being in the highest of regards, but Draco was nearly positive that if his delicious mate came any closer, he wouldn’t be able to control himself from showing her just how much he did want her.
Gryffindor had won the alumni game fairly, he admitted that, but Draco didn’t feel that his wishes for a family were that unreasonable.
Narcissa frowned and Hermione blinked pleadingly at Harriet. Draco glared at the other two omegas in the room and explained, “I’ll call you both when we need you. Please…….send the healer and the midwife in.”
Draco sadly pulled back for a moment and tried to remind himself to stay on task, “People are already wondering...as Scorpius grows, they’re going to wonder more.”
Draco didn’t reply but his frown deepened as he stared up at the healer.
—————————————————————
He flicked his wand to confirm that his office door was locked and then he hastily unfastened the fly of his trousers.
“I love you too,Mr. Malfoy~.” Harriet replied with a wide grin.
Harriet let out a deep, guttural groan as Draco sheathed himself inside of her in one, low thrust.
“What’s…...what’s the matter?” Harriet asked in confusion as she looked around.
“Thanks.” Draco mumbled numbly.
That surely must have been how things had always been, all of the past and all of the real world…….that was only an ugly dream.
That, combined with Draco’s heated stare, made Harriet glow with pride.
There were several paintings on those walls that captured the likeness of Malfoys who had lived before cameras were in existence.
The midwife was completely calm as she replied to her pregnant patient while she continued her soothing rubbing, “Relax, love, it’s normal to feel some pressure as the baby moves down. Mr. Malfoy,” The midwife said, glancing behind Harriet, “I think we need to go ahead and move to the-“
She stopped pestering him about making love.
Harriet rustled around to peer at her husband over the covers of her nest with an exasperated sigh.
Despite the social pressure of the situation and the imposing intrusiveness of the many photographers' constantly flashing cameras, Harriet and Draco managed to push all of it out and focus on each other while they let the officiant lead them through their second set of vows.
At last, after an agonizing sentence to a private, mental prison of doom and despair, the door that led to Harriet opened and a flurry of healthcare workers spilled out into the hallway.
He liked to whine until he got his way.
The midwife gently palpated Harriet’s belly while the new parents stared down at their little one in awe and…...surprise.
Draco couldn’t take her to St. Mungo’s, that would attract far too much publicity.
Those-
Time was not something Draco had in ample amounts. It took him only a few seconds to whirl on his heel and face his father with a grimace.
When she walked into the room, her green eyes widened in disbelief.
“I’ve packed everything you’ll need.” Hermione told Harriet as she and Ron stood in the Malfoys’ small living area.
“My ‘unfortunate mistake’?” Draco asked as he echoed Lucius with a mirthless chuckle, “Tell me, father, is that how you intend to address your granddaughter or grandson?”
He listened closely and calmly to everything the midwife had to say, but under his black suit, inside his ribs, his heart pounded nervously.
“Ultrasound”, is that what Draco had said?
“It’s your baby.” Harriet stubbornly insisted.
As Draco kissed his way down Harriet, she sighed happily, looking forward to their early morning frolic.
“Of course.” The woman behind the counter smiled, “I’m assuming you’re interested in our maternity package?”
“We’ve bought everything for the nursery, we just need to place it.” Harriet nodded.
The next morning, a flutter against Harriet’s rib cage caused her green eyes to crack open. Instinctively, she placed a hand on her belly and blinked when she noticed that something was already covering it.
Enraged by his parents and still reeling from the nauseating realization of how close he had come to losing Harriet forever, Draco chose to act boldly as he stomped into the damask dining room.
“You and I…...are together…...right?” Draco asked rhetorically as he dared to nibble her tenderly.
Did he really think his wife would abandon her deep affection for her only child?
Draco’s grey eyes narrowed for a second and then they widened as he realized what his little omega was going after.
Harriet grabbed him to pull him down beside her, but he caught her hand and replied, “I’ll be in soon, I have a bit of reading to do first.”
And the day after.
“Good morning.” Draco greeted his wife very seriously.
“Perhaps later?” Draco murmured.
“I…..I didn’t mean to lie! It was never supposed to be like this!” Harriet said defensively to Hermione.
“I had trouble getting you out of the nest with the girls, too. Perhaps it’s twins again!” Draco mused as he pushed the covers of the way so Harriet could have room to stand up. As he did, his grey eyes hovered reverently over her swollen belly.
When Harriet was finally alone in the living room with the baby, she was briefly seized by a disturbing wave of terror.
Draco was less than pleased that his mate was suffering but he did enjoy having the strong, independent omega rely on him to such a great degree.
—————————————————————-
“What do you want?” Draco asked curtly, “I’ve already written to you about why she hasn’t replied. Give it a few weeks and you’ll get your precious meeting.”
Harriet was certain that her husband would lick his wounds and after a few days, she wouldn’t hear anything else about him wanting a family.
A sense of unease prickled up his spine and Draco was suddenly gripped by the instinctive feeling that something was wrong.
“.....What’s his name?” Lucius asked slowly in an irritated tone.
—————————————————————-
Harriet had no qualms whatsoever about the bet she had made with her husband.
The baby girls giggled at Draco and he smirked as he picked them both up.
She would no longer have a need for Draco and she no longer carried his son inside her.
Draco brushed a stray strand of hair out of Harriet’s face as they both silently remembered what had happened between them the last time they had been together on Draco’s bed…..
As the class waited for their teacher to finish preparing the video, Draco’s hands snaked up to Harriet’s belly and splayed lovingly over the bump that seemed to grow everyday.
“Good afternoon?......How late is it?” Harriet asked as she groggily rubbed her face.
Harriet was so lost in her own world that she barely heard Draco bellowing for help.
For Harriet and Draco, that was one of the best years they had ever known.
Harriet’s alpha was devastated.
“We didn’t mean for this to happen on purpose, did we?!” Harriet hissed back.
Three weeks passed and then four.
That week turned into two.
Harriet whimpered at the word and sat up in bed, exposing her swollen breasts and flushed skin directly to Draco’s view. His grey eyes widened as they greedily consumed the sight of his wife in such a vulnerable condition.
Harriet felt eyes upon her and she turned around. She nearly started when she saw Draco standing in the doorway.
His breath was as labored as Harriet’s as he made sure the curtains stayed closed before he fetched her favorite lavender candles.
Harriet smiled as Draco turned his attention back to her belly. He began to kiss and nuzzle against her womb like he was trying to visit with their unborn son or daughter.
Both women were a little uneasy as Narcissa slowly walked back to Harriet, but the softness in the older woman’s eyes as she gazed down at Harriet’s mounded tummy made the expecting omega much more comfortable.
“I came back early!” Harriet lied pointlessly. Even if that statement was truthful, that did nothing to explain her condition, of which Ron and Hermione were in absolute disbelief that she hadn’t mentioned anything about it to them previously.
“I…..didn’t say….you had to….t-to return everything.” Harriet replied as she wiped her eyes with a hand and sighed.
How was that going to help their fertility problem?
Perhaps Hermione had a point.
When Harriet saw him staring at her though, she shook Draco’s hand in hers and pointed towards the screen as she whispered, “Draco, I’m fine! Look!”
Draco happily spent that time with his mate and his son.
“It may get his mind off of it for a while.” Hermione shrugged, “And you both may be surprised at how much better things can work if someone’s….relaxed enough.”
Harriet was terribly frightened for Draco as she dashed down the hallway with her eyes wide and her hands trembling.
“You heard me, Potter. Why not?” Draco repeated.
When the midwife confirmed what Harriet already knew to be true, Draco came racing out into the corridor and threw his arms around his mother.
“I don’t want to.” Harriet sighed stubbornly as she laid back against the pile of soft things in which she was happily entangled.
His grey eyes glowed as he looked at Harriet with a smirk and greeted his bride, “Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy~.”
He did not particularly enjoy business negotiations.
—————————————————————
On that night, they were no longer enemies, they were alpha and omega.
Draco would have preferred to have made more concrete strides in charming his omega, but he wasn’t complaining.
—————————————————————
Draco tried his best to bat away his all-consuming instincts and stay level-headed with Harriet.
Despite Draco’s tender attention, Harriet couldn’t hold back the moans and whimpers that left her throat.
…….Or three?
“You know what I meant!” Harriet laughed in feigned irritation.
Draco was a little overdressed in his dark suit, but Harriet looked perfectly normal.
—————————————————————
“Draco?!” Harriet asked in disbelief as she laid a hand on the underside of her belly.
The house elves quickly scurried over to take Lily and Narcissa from Draco’s arms.
Draco shrugged as he responded, “Suit yourself, then, keep thinking that.”
“I give you my body, Harriet Potter,” The man nodded at Draco.
He was too excited to sleep.
She and Draco had changed out of their wedding clothes before they could be seen, but both the bride and the groom were so very tired they nearly felt ill.
…..But Draco sucked in a breath as Harriet rolled onto her hands and knees and offered herself up to him, feeling a blush spread across her cheeks as she felt his eyes take in the view of her rounded rump.
Hermione had sat her baby down in her carrier on the coffee table right before she had started giving Harriet a crash course in infant care for nearly a half an hour while Ron brought in bag after bag of supplies.
“Well, do what it takes to see that that doesn’t happen again.” Lucius huffed.
Malfoy manor had been silent that afternoon, until Harriet heard the faint sound of glass clinking from down the hallway and she abandoned her inspection of the table’s contents to investigate the cause of the noise.
Ron stood outside in the hall while Hermione helped her into her very expensive and very grand wedding dress.
He gasped as he sat bolt upright on the bed with his grey eyes wide.
They never really expected the article to turn into front page news, but that was exactly what happened.
“You’ve done so well.” Draco said proudly as he sat back and smiled while he admired the sublime scene of his beloved mate feeding their little one.
Her plan backfired. The  iciness in her voice was doing things to Draco that he didn’t understand.
Harriet glared over at her husband and he glared back for a split second before their eyes turned back to the snitch.
“Well….have you ever had gelato?” Harriet asked.
She hoped she was as ready to meet her baby as her baby was to meet her.
Harriet blinked at the way he grabbed her hand and squeezed it very tightly, as if he were trying to apologize to her.
Draco drew in a shuddering breath of uncertainty as Harriet climbed into the chair with him and settled herself as best she could in his lap.
Well, really while Harriet chatted with the hosting couple.
Harriet sniffed guiltily.
If Harriet looked uncomfortable, Draco did everything he could to help her into a better position.
“What do you mean not quite as-!” Draco was in mid sentence when the muggle elevator shifted underneath their feet and lifted the couple to the fourth floor.
She thought a holiday with Draco would be fun.
Draco followed the muggle man inside the house. They walked through a narrow hallway until Mr. Roberts paused and ushered Draco into what the Malfoy heir realized was a small living room.
“Yeah……..” Harriet said absently, grimacing as low cramps curled through her abdomen, triggered by the baby’s hungry motions.
He blinked up at Draco curiously as if he were trying to determine whether his father’s claim was legitimate or not.
No, what bothered Harriet was how overbearing the Malfoy family had become ever since they thought that she would be bearing a new Malfoy.
Harriet had learned over the years that advice from Hermione Granger was usually top quality.
Perhaps not even then…..
The bathroom door opened and Draco stepped out, staring incredulously at the scene in front of him.
His face was so serious that Harriet scowled back at him.
Sincerely,
“We’re going to get married right now?” Harriet blinked incredulously.
What a wonderful press statement it would be if it were announced that Harriet Potter, the Harriet Potter, had chosen his son as her alpha and started a family with him!
“You’re scared that you’ll fail us, aren't you?” Harriet asked quietly.
That wasn’t true at all!
—————————————————————
He wouldn’t even let Harriet walk. Instead, he insisted on carrying her while he apparated them back to Malfoy manor and carefully tucked his omega into her nest.
A new life.
Even under the blanket of evening stars, the stark beauty of nothing but the calm, black sea and the gentle glow of the moon was breathtaking,
Draco was more than glad to assist whenever and wherever with Scorpius’s care and his desire to help extended far beyond changing and burping his small son.
As Draco walked out of his father’s study with his son’s fussy whimpers quickly turning into hungry cries, he smiled as he made his way back to Harriet.
“That’s not what I said, Draco.” Lucius replied dryly.
“I’m right here, love.” Harriet faintly heard Draco call.
One warm, summer evening, Draco stood at the manor’s back entrance with a scowl marring his handsome face.
Harriet looked angry and sad all at once and Draco frowned as she placed her hands on her belly.
The decorations were all relaxing, oceanic shades of blue, green, and white.
“I’ve got it all right here, Ron.” A voice came from behind them in a hushed tone, “It’s fine.”
Draco’s pulse quickened when he felt its rigidity under his hand.
Rita Skeeter and a crew of her fellow, vulture-like journalists pounced on the opportunity and wrote a short novel on the dramatic, passionate affair against the two enemies-turned-lovers.
Draco smiled softly as he admired his slumbering love.
While Ron and Hermione had Harriet cornered, Draco appeared with a pop in the bathroom of the gelato shop. He flushed the toilet, and turned on the water to pretend he had finished what business Harriet thought he had excused himself to take care of.
This was the suit that Draco was going to be wearing when Harriet agreed to become his wife.
“Of course.” Harriet replied, “Just for a moment...that’s all.”
Draco rubbed a hand over his face and looked away for a moment before he heaved a great sigh and glanced back over at Harriet as he admitted, “I have to save you, Potter, because the truth is…... I need you far more than you’ll ever need me and I don’t think there’s anything that can ever change that now.”
The next three days weren’t necessarily easy, but Harriet tried to view them as a learning experience.
“Full head of blonde hair!” The midwife announced before Harriet whimpered and curled forward to push again.
She had intended to meet with Ron and Hermione before the little one arrived but as the baby’s birth approached, Draco insisted that if she left the manor, he was going to follow her.
Minutes before the ceremony was slated to begin, Draco stood at the front of the ballroom, next to the wedding officiant, trying not to fidget as distant relatives, friends, dignitaries, government officials, and numerous journalists stared at him anxiously from their seats.
“Nothing happened and there’s nowhere to go.” Harriet replied coldly.
While he assisted Harriet, he scowled over at the healer and retorted, “I wasn’t a hindrance when my baby was conceived. Tell me, Healer, how many wild thestrals have you brought to drag me away from my mate? That’s the only way you’ll get me to leave her side now.”
He noticed the way her hand gently rubbed her belly while she gazed at the other woman’s newborn.
Draco tried not to stare as he began his work once more.
“I give you my body, Harriet Potter.” Draco repeated, and as he did, his grey eyes shimmered at Harriet in the moonlight and she grinned.
The Roberts family did.
Draco was alone in his office, and Harriet was too far along for him to go and bother her, but……but his pulse was racing and his trousers had become so tight that he had to seek out release.
Harry had delivered quite a few babies in his time as a healer, Scorpius being one of them. From Draco’s primitive cry to her posture to the look on her wan face, Harry knew that they weren’t going to have the leisurely wait for the baby they had imagined.
After hours of traipsing through the streets, in and out of shops, Draco and Harriet had succeeded in gathering nearly everything that any baby could possibly need.
Ring, Ring.
Hermione just frowned at her friend. Although she did seem to process the shock better than Ron as her brown eyes returned to their normal size and she spoke, “That doesn’t matter now, Harriet. Look at you, we’re not stupid, you know. Why have you hidden from us?”
He meant well……
She let go of Harry in a rush as she widened her knees. Her hands gripped her thighs and she stared at Harry, a tear dripping down her cheek as she roared, “I HAVE TO PUSH!”
“Do you feel that you’re still capable of maintaining your usual hours?” The midwife asked, “I can write a letter for you to hand to your superior. Under magical law, a woman in your condition has the right to request a leave of absence or…….perhaps a reduction in the amount of time you’re in the office each day?”
Those thoughts swirled through Harriet’s mind just before she lost her battle and drifted away.
Draco worriedly stayed close by his omega at all times, even when she visited the bathroom, he was never more than a short distance away from the closed door.
“Oh, that’s alright.” Harriet huffed, “I won’t be this size forever.”
Harriet was glad that her other best friend was finally being introduced to her son, but Hermione was busy admiring how handsome Ron looked holding a baby~.
He scowled nervously as he handed the wailing baby over to his mate and looked on as the midwife and the healer began their attempts to assist Harriet with giving her tiny son his first dinner.
Both of the elves wore bright smiles as they carried the giggling Malfoy girls off to the dining room.
Draco held her close and whispered soothingly to her for a while until she quieted and wiped her eyes.
He and Harriet were already married, he didn’t have to be-
“I want you to run away with me.” Draco said flatly.
If Harriet took a shower and he deemed the temperature was too warm, he would throw a fit until she cooled it down to a temperature he felt was suitable.
Draco carried his little ones out of their nursery and across the hall. He mumbled under his breath and handlessly opened the door to his and Harriet’s bedroom.
—————————————————————
With a gentle purr, Draco left Scorpius’s cribside, bounded over to Harriet’s nest as stealthily as a panther, and promptly crawled in next to her.
—————————————————————
Lucius smirked to himself, amused by his own foolishness.
—————————————————————
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Pregnant omegas were always hungry.
Harriet repeated to Draco with complete confidence, “I’m fine.”
Lucius Malfoy would never admit it, but secretly, he thought that whatever it was called…..
After he had made his purchase, he apparated to Diagon Alley’s finest dining establishment, and then he came to his final stop for the afternoon.
His heart ached as he dared to glance over at those chubby, red, little faces.
If she woke in the night and attempted to reposition herself, he was awake too, ready to do whatever she needed.
Regardless, if healer Marigold wouldn’t allow Draco to remain with Harriet during a simple examination, she probably wasn’t going to allow him to remain with Harriet during the birth either.
Harriet and Draco barely heard them.
“That you, Harriet Potter, are bone of my bone and blood of my blood.” Draco nodded.
After Harriet stepped into her dress and slipped her arms through the gown’s short, lace sleeves, she put her hands behind her back to fasten the buttons.
When she and Draco heard only shuffling from the other side, the secretary gently turned the knob and cracked the door open.
“Thanks, Harriet!” Hermione whispered as she hugged her friend back.
Harriet looked over at him with a glare but Draco just laughed as he grinned and said, “I love you, Potter.”
Harriet sighed as she laid back on the bed.
A machine for her to ride at will?
The way she had clung to him the night before as if he was her very life force itself……
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
And Harriet didn’t know how to explain…..
During the times that Draco did have to make his rare monthly appearances in the office at his father’s company, the employees tried their best to discover when he planned on arriving so they could avoid passing him in the hallways.
When Draco flipped the black, velvet ring box open, the glint of the chandeliers above the gothic dining table hit the brilliant ring inside with a blinding flash of light.
“Mummy’s going to be fine.” Harry nodded confidently to his son, then he turned to the house elf and ordered, “Dobby, take Scorp to play outside.”
The sudden rush of fluids that poured from her center caused the midwife’s eyes to widen and Draco’s mouth to fall open.
That was a lie, despite their awkward exchange, she felt amazing. Still pleasured and relaxed from Draco’s satisfying attention the night before, for an omega so far along in a pregnancy, Harriet may as well have been floating on a cloud.
Draco understood what Harriet wanted better than she did.
“Oh, really?” Harriet asked incredulously.
He was angry.
Draco Malfoy was a man of fine breeding.
Slowed down by his own need, a silent thrill ran through Draco as his pregnant wife grabbed hold of the arms on his chair and stared into his grey eyes as she spoke, “We could have one go at it, you know. That won’t hurt~.”
Hermione’s eyes widened and Ron’s mouth fell open in shock.
—————————————————————
The child would have a good life because she was making the right decision.
From his bed, covered with duvets and blankets that were all Slytherin green, Harry Potter opened his eyes and glanced out the window to admire the bright sunlight of the day.
…..Something was wrong with Harriet and she left him, going somewhere far away, hurt and in trouble…..and he couldn’t find her.
The sight was more than tempting to the alpha and his grey eyes scanned over her predatorily for a moment as he allowed himself to indulge in selfish fantasies.
Ron’s eyes were glued to Harriet’s rounded belly as he repeated, “You’re supposed to be on holiday!”
The tie itself sat high on top of her belly.
Then she would take the bare minimum that she must and be right back to work.
Harriet knew her alpha loved the enhancements that nursing their little one had brought to her body and the gentle way that he liked to remind her of that was in no way unwelcome to the omega.
Raising a hand, Draco knocked on Harriet’s apartment door and waited patiently.
As he laid in bed and thought about Harriet, Draco groaned, snaking a hand down to wrap around his arousal. He closed his eyes and remembered the way she melted under his attentions, arching herself into his touch as if she was aching for him.
—————————————————————
Harriet collapsed with a groan.
They followed the directions and walked down the hall until they came to the elevators. Harriet stepped inside and Draco closely followed her. The door closed and Harriet pushed the button to go to the fourth floor as she looked at Draco and warned him, “The motion in muggle elevators isn’t quite as smooth as the ones in the Ministry, alright? Hold on.”
From his bassinet, Scorpius whined in displeasure at the unwelcome noise though his grey eyes remained closed.
Harriet’s eyes widened as Draco rushed into the room.
They both sniffed as Draco closed the distance between them and captured Harriet’s lips in a deep kiss. He melted against her when she wrapped her arms loosely around his shoulders.
As the owl landed right on her open windowsill a short while later, Harriet frowned and took the letter from its talons.
To reward his obedient omega, he affectionately kissed her exposed shoulder which her thin nightgown failed to cover.
Not realizing that Ron and Hermione were staring at her, Harriet rose from her seat to reach over and grab a napkin.
Draco smirked at his omega arrogantly.
Draco was positive she had all day to wait.
The warmth in his grey eyes made Harriet feel like she had a great, comforting blanket wrapped around her.
Draco’s grey eyes widened in shock before they narrowed in anger.
Harriet could have just taken Draco’s hand and laid it against her bump, but she chose to coax her alpha to open up to her instead.
Gasps erupted as Draco pounced and wrapped his arms around Harriet. He dipped her down for a deep kiss, much to Harriet’s sheepish embarrassment.
Harriet looked surprised, “H-How?”
The Malfoy house elves had a salary, medical care, holiday time, room and board, and even retirement plans which Harry had set up for them at Gringotts.
He wanted to know exactly how he should look after his little one and he wanted to know exactly how he should care for Harriet before and after the birth.
And Draco……...Harriet was fairly certain that if she bore Draco a dozen children, he would love them all as ferociously and as deeply as he loved baby Scorpius.
Harriet opened her eyes when she felt his ministrations halt. She blinked as she saw their instructor standing close beside them.
“MALFOY?!?!” Ron squealed.
Draco swallowed thickly as Harriet laid a hand on her abdomen and moved onto the bed to straddle him.
Her nightdress was loose and flowing.
A plan.
Draco gasped in exasperation, “Perhaps not to our extent, but Potter’s wealthy from her father’s inheritance! She’s not going to-“
While they waited for the healer and the midwife to come in, he kept his omega on her side where she was comfortable and whispered to her soothingly while he gently rubbed her back and arms to help her relax.
By the time Harriet finished speaking, silent tears were pouring down her cheeks as she thought about the last year.
“It’s…….It’s……..” Harriet stammered as she struggled for words.
How were Harriet and the baby?
The thought amused Draco, that he and Harriet had mated and had their first child together, but that evening was their first actual date.
nor Harriet heard Lucius and Narcissa apparate into the estate’s parlor.
The omega’s eyes widened as she realized what was ultimately on her husband’s mind.
Later, at dinner, Harriet and Draco sat across from each other while they shared the evening’s meal with Lucius and Narcissa.
“My mate won’t even eat enough food to feed our son!” Draco retorted, “I’ve seen it myself! He cries for her breasts and when she nurses him, he cries afterwards with an empty belly!”
Instead, she cleared her throat and put on her outfit for the day, brushed her hair, and prepared herself for the slew of meetings and testings that would come too soon.
Once the girls and the elves had left the room, Draco looked down at Harriet and offered her his hand.
Regardless, his words were like music.
Regardless of the hastiness of the motion, Draco saw the glimmer of happiness in his father’s frigid, grey eyes as he stared down at the little blonde boy.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Didn’t his omega understand that the last people he wanted to see, especially then, were Granger and Weasley?
—————————————————————
Harriet’s words hurt him more than she realized.
Draco watched as Harriet leaned in closer to him.
A thousand tempting fantasies ran through Draco’s mind of all the ways he could dishevel his lover, but they would have to wait.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
As he began to disrobe himself, he watched his omega lay back and spread herself wide for her husband.
“It’s not the war, Draco!” Harriet retorted, “It’s everything! My family, your family! The implications….I….I think it would be better if the child was raised to be blissfully unaware.”
“Potter?” Draco repeated as he stood in front of Harriet with his brow furrowed in concern.
Harriet furrowed her brow just a bit as she listened to Draco and she watched while he took his hand in hers and held it tightly.
Draco didn’t trust a spell or a charm to look after his little family, for that task, he only trusted his own eyes.
Why wouldn’t Harriet be hungry?
“You should have let me take you to the hospital when you first woke me.” Draco reprimanded his wife, although his tone was gentle and soft.
In a frantic rush, Gryfinndor’s and Slytherin’s teams scrambled to take their places on the field.
However, Draco did notice what exactly Harriet had her vision focused on.
—————————————————————
His pounding heart raced faster when Harriet took a deep breath and he unashamedly watched the subtle movement of her breasts that the simple motion elicited.
“I don’t want to impose any longer than I must.” Harriet responded quietly.
—————————————————————
“No, it’s not, it’s the baby’s! Stop being so loud, I can’t hear it as well.” Draco replied with a scowl.
The needy way she breathed in his ear at the contact sent fireworks exploding in his mind.
“........Good morning.” Harriet replied hesitantly as she narrowed her eyes at him.
“My nest is the only place I feel comfortable at this stage.” Harriet huffed as Draco stood and draped one of her arms across his shoulders.
He made his way to Knockturn Alley and went to see his family’s favorite tailor. The elderly wizard blinked at his young customer and the hurry that he was in, but he quickly measured Draco and took down his order for a new, black suit.
If only he could get that acknowledged in a muggle court.
Harriet scowled at Draco in silent irritation.
“Harriet! Are you alright?!” Hermione asked worriedly. She deliberately chose to ignore her old enemy and his mother.
“You know, Potter,” Draco huffed, looking at Harriet directly, “You’ll be weak after the birth. You don’t have to run as soon as the child’s out.”
That night, though, his eyes narrowed in concern when he saw Harriet wrestling around in bed.
As Lucius spoke, he could almost smell the metallic scent of glittering, gold galleons, “On the contrary, Draco, I’ve come to urge you to fight for what is yours.”
She stopped in the yard one evening and watched her alpha zoom around in the air for a moment.
Before Draco could respond, Lucius placed the bundle back into his arms.
Harriet hadn’t fallen back asleep at all.
Together, he and Harriet moved on to look at something else.
Draco and Harriet said nothing about their tumultuous situation.
“W-What are you doing?” Harriet asked Draco as he held the ring box in one hand and went to open it with the other.
“Mother…..” Draco said flatly.
While the midwife began to help Harriet with the afterbirth, Draco watched as his newborn began to squirm fussily in his mother’s arms.
“Where did you run off to?” Harriet asked with a yawn.
The lights were too bright, the walls were too bland, and there were so many irritating beeping noises that he didn’t know which way to look.
The shock from her changed figure caused Hermione to cry out, “HARRIET!”
She watched in amusement as he grit his teeth.
Draco frowned like a punished child as Harriet finished writing and placed her reply in an envelope.
Harriet Potter
She had never been a weepy girl, so why was she crying?
Rose curled up sweetly and fell asleep almost instantly.
“What, love?” Harry asked, withdrawing his fingers carefully.
—————————————————————
Draco’s face tightened in concern when spit dripped absently from her open mouth along with tears from her eyes.
“Draco……..it’s alright.” Harriet chuckled at the unnatural pallor on his face.
—————————————————————-
No, he couldn’t.
Draco and Harriet began to establish consistent, daily routines and from the morning's tea to their last kiss before bed, the two of them settled into their patterns as if there was no other suitable alternative.
“Good morning.” Harriet mumbled.
“Not much, Mr. Malfoy.” The midwife shrugged at Draco, “The first weeks are often difficult, her body will adjust as time passes.”
“Darling….?” Narcissa asked Draco gently.
“I have my last ultrasound next week.” Harriet told Draco plainly, “They don’t usually do them this late, but since I missed a few doctors appointments, they want to have another look. I cast a spell earlier today to retrieve the messages left on the muggle phone line I had in my apartment.”
Harriet saw the small sparkle of excitement in her alpha’s tired eyes before she reluctantly stood from the bed and walked towards the cavernous closet in Draco’s bedroom.
Fueled by hormones, Harriet generously allowed one of her walls to come crumbling down.
Besides those humble cabins, it was all sky and sea in every direction.
Those other omegas were trying to gain their alpha’s sympathy, that’s all they were doing.
And the day after that.
As stubborn and determined as Harriet was, the life inside her didn’t have the same level of patience.
It was late afternoon when Draco and Lucius finally apparated back to Malfoy manor.
—————————————————————
Draco had started asking Harriet about using a fertility potion.
Harriet blinked at Draco as he kissed her lips gently.
The snitch came rushing behind Draco and Harriet caught it instinctively in her hand but she paid it little mind.
He pulled the covers up over himself but his eyes didn’t close. He was too busy thinking about Harriet and his baby to sleep.
Her and Draco hadn’t conceived a child together and they wouldn’t have one.
Her eyes widened as he latched onto one of her tight nipples and began to suckle greedily. Harriet instinctively spread her thighs and the readiness of her wet center allowed him to all but slip in, despite his adequate size.
She walked over to open the box but just before her fingers graced the lid, Draco swept over to her side, and grabbed her hand.
Harriet gained back the weight she had lost but it was the change in her scent once she was nearly twelve weeks along that really commanded her alpha’s attention.
Draco wasn’t sure who he was more worried about, his unborn child, or the omega with whom he was so deeply in love…..
Harriet frowned as she contemplated that idea.
Harriet noticed that Lucius and Narcissa weren’t helping the situation.
She felt like she was in prison.
Harriet didn’t care about being active, she just wanted to cuddle up amongst her soft things that smelled like Draco and rest.
“What is it, love? What do you need?” Draco’s answer was swift and immediate.
The Malfoy heir had no intentions of forcing motherhood onto his wife, but as he rolled over in his lonely bed, he frowned to himself as he thought.
—————————————————————
But that didn’t seem likely to happen at all.
The healer and midwife went to leave but as they walked towards the door and Draco remained with Harriet, the Malfoy family healer glared over at him as she stated, “A man has no place in the birthing room. You need to leave, you’ll only be a hindrance.”
Wedding receptions are more often about the guests than the couple and as Harriet and Draco made their rounds greeting and mingling with everyone, they discovered that to be true.
Draco was worried about the baby, but Harriet’s headache had nothing to do with her pregnancy. Her headache was from imagining how she was going to explain everything to Hermione and Ron.
Draco was more than happy to fill his lover, but he needed his rest too.
Harriet didn’t say anything. She didn’t want a confrontation, she didn’t want to explain, and she certainly didn’t want Draco to find out about…..
As they embraced, both women closed their eyes for a moment.
Draco’s grey eyes widened as he looked at his bare wife.
“Draco………mm…...what are you doing?” Harriet mumbled drowsily.
“I was only joking.” Harriet replied with another shrug.
Lucius and Narcissa exchanged a surprised glance.
Draco barely heard their exchange as his mind raced rapidly.
Draco knew that Scorpius would be thrilled to spend a moment in the company of his favorite house elf. He watched as the creature led Scorpius down the hallway towards where Lucius and Narcissa sat waiting at the dining table.
Harriet sighed deeply before she answered him, “What’s it going to take to get you to shut up about this?”
Draco hadn’t expected that either of his parents would heed his words and actually attempt to welcome Harriet properly. Before Narcissa uttered a word, though, Draco knew by the smile on her red lips that he had been wrong.
“I don’t remember uttering lies, Potter.” Draco shrugged haughtily as he began to eat his ganache cake with a glistening, silver spoon.
Harriet rolled onto her back and murmured under her breath to crack the window open slightly with a spell.
Draco lifted his gaze to meet hers.
“You haven’t had any better of a night than I have.” Harriet sighed, “I wanted you to get some sleep for a moment, anyway.”
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
He had spent the last six months writing her a pining letter every day and all she had to tell him was that their mating had been a……..mistake?
The door closed behind the Weasley couple as they left.
“Mr. Malfoy, a numbing agent is given to the patient before the procedure begins.” The teacher calmly informed her distraught, prized student, “I apologize, everyone. I was told this video showed the administration of spinal anesthesia before the surgery.”
One was delivered in the morning, two were delivered in the afternoon, and several were delivered in the evening.
A pained look crossed Draco’s face for a split second and then he forced a snide grin on to his lips as he stealthily placed the box back in its original storage place without her notice.
Ron and Hermione said reluctant goodbyes to their little girl and then they went on their way.
That meant that she could concentrate on her own.
She was the better flyer.
“Alright, alright…..” Draco said soothingly as he took Scorpius by his little hand and led him back into the house, “You can play with the pixies again tomorrow, how does that sound?”
Harriet shrugged and replied, “I was only asking.”
The air between Draco and Harriet filled with icy tension as she dressed, washed up, and apparated off to work.
Harriet blinked at Draco.
Draco’s father, Lucius, and grandfather, Abraxas,  had their own family portraits on display in that hall too, also taken when the Malfoy men were in their infancy.
“Nothing, right now. I’d like to rest for a bit if I can.” Draco said quietly, “Go and tend Scorpius for awhile.”
The warring alpha and omega didn’t have any longer to harass each other.
Harriet narrowed her green eyes at Draco for a moment but when she saw how peacefully he was resting, she decided not to disturb him.
“Potter, what did I just say about wanting you and the baby to be healthy? I can’t claim you right now, we’ve been over this.” Draco scowled.
“Are you ill?” Draco asked urgently, “I bought some anti-nausea potion for you. It’s right here on the nightstand, I can-“
“I think…. it’s time…….” Harriet gasped, “It hurts……...it really hurts!”
“What else happens?” Draco asked.
“Scorpius!” Draco shouted as he gazed out across his estate’s grand terrace, “I’m not going to call you again! Dinner is ready!”
Harriet‘a cheeks burned with anger, shame, and guilt. Had someone dug a hold outside the gelato shop, she would have walked out and crawled in it.
It really alarmed Harriet one evening as she sat with her future in-laws, her alpha, and her infant son, at the dining table, eating dinner, when Draco suddenly paled and turned a ghastly shade of green.
Draco was interested in his omega and her happiness too.
Draco frowned and walked over, assuming his omega had a bad dream.
Under the table, Narcissa kicked her husband with the high heels of her boots, earning her a warning scowl from her alpha.
Harry laughed at his wife’s irritability and moved his hand to rub gentle little circles into her lower back.
“I…..I don’t know a Draco Smith.” Harriet replied in annoyance. She swallowed thickly when her throat began to  tighten.
Left alone, Narcissa sighed to herself.
She was in Malfoy manor and Draco was sitting by her bedside, tenderly petting her rounded womb!
Sometimes she was nauseous, other times she was stricken with sudden, intense cravings for one food and one food alone.
“Your alpha?” The woman asked with a knowing smile.
There was a hand on her thigh, or so she thought……..was that him?
Those classes would be nothing but a waste of her time.
“You don’t have to worry about any of that.” Draco whispered to Harriet. He kissed her ear tenderly as she slowly fell asleep, “I’m here, Potter, I’m here~.”
Lucius walked back over and sat down at his desk again as he remarked, “Name him and he’ll be a Malfoy.”
—————————————————————
Where was her son?
That wave of excited energy left her as she walked back down the hallway and yawned to herself.
Draco was alone.
“That’s easy for you to say.” Harriet chuckled, “Perhaps I can…..”
“Prepare yourself, Potter. I always get what I want~.” Draco grinned.
Harriet was irritated that she felt strangely…...sad and rejected.
“Nine weeks is practically tomorrow!” Draco exclaimed in a terrified tone as he looked down at Harriet.
Harriet bravely wiped away her tears and looked at him with red, watery eyes.
As they stood there and stared each other down in that muggle gelato shop, Ron, Harriet, Hermione, and Draco all endured what may have been one of the single most awkward moments of their lives so far.
Why wouldn’t people be interested in knowing about his tortuous path to win over his beautiful omega and keep his adorable son?
And Draco?
She wasn’t awake to hear him anyway.
Draco’s neglected manhood strained against his trousers, but he had no interest in watching his omega serve him…..,,he wasn’t finished with her yet.
“We’re going to make your alpha like you even better~.” The photographer replied with a knowing smirk.
Draco knew he should probably ignore the temptation, but he chose to allow himself a small indulgence.
“Let’s go see Mummy, shall we?” Draco asked Lily and Narcissa excitedly.
“Good morning, Potter.” Draco replied, although his gaze hovered protectively between Harriet and the baby, “I didn’t even hear him cry this time, why didn’t you wake me?”
Harriet had already welcomed him into her bed, given him her heart, and borne his son.
Ron and Hermione slowly sat down across from Draco as he peered at them both with his icy, grey eyes.
For the moment, all Harriet could focus on was how good Draco’s lips felt against her skin~.
Draco’s sneer slipped into a dangerous grimace as he glared at the expecting omega, “Potter, why do you insist on making this a battle between us?! I thought that we-“
There was no more discussion of a baby and the Malfoys were happier for it.
“Most mothers have an easier time in the birthing bed if they’re comfortable while they do their work. We’ll wait outside, Mr. Malfoy, when you need us, just call us and we’ll come in.” The midwife nodded.
An unreadable look washed over Harriet’s face and Draco wasn’t sure if she was sad, nauseous, or regretful, but it passed quickly and she replied to him with a yawn, “.......Good morning, Draco.”
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked.
Draco smirked at his wife as she deftly picked the letter up, though he did twitch when she purposefully let her finger slip across his naked length.
Harriet wanted to scream into her pillow in frustration.
“Our son deserves no less, ‘Cissa.” Lucius nodded.
“Someone help me get her to St. Mungo’s!” One of the secretaries called out as she wrapped her arm around the unconscious omega.
Draco swallowed tightly. Without another thought, he accepted his omega’s invitation and crawled forward on the bed to join her in her nest.
Draco had had enough pretending.
“Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy~.” Draco purred, smiling slightly when Harriet’s attention snapped over to him and she blinked in surprise.
Busy with their professional lives and each other, Draco and Harriet agreed on one issue, no children.
Harriet could hear the tension in his voice and the only thing that matched that anxiety was her own.
Draco left the cameras alone. Pictures of him standing by himself in his own house didn’t prove or hint at anything, so he saw the possibility of destroying the film as a waste of his time.
Longer working hours meant less time she had to interact with Draco each day.
During those occasions, Harriet stood and watched her husband with a frown.
When Draco’s bold display of affection ended, Harriet’s work day ended with it.
Harriet sighed again and laid her head down in the crook of Draco’s neck as she struggled to stop crying.
The soft grass was the first thing that Harriet noticed as she and Draco arrived in a thicket of trees with a loud pop.
Harriet and Draco talked about everything and nothing at all, but they didn’t once speak of a baby, and at last, after months of tense suffering, Harriet saw her alpha smile again.
She stopped when she felt her heart start to pound and a metallic taste flooded her throat.
“It’s not heavy.” Harriet mumbled.
Draco’s grey eyes widened when she pulled him down in the bed with her, though he did nothing to protest.
Draco didn’t appear to feel the same.
Harriet wouldn’t survive this, she was certain.
….And if anyone thought that Draco was going to be more than a meter away from Harriet when their baby arrived, they were mad.
“You’re always giving me dresses, Malfoy.” Harriet whispered.
When he came to a section in one medieval edition on the bond between mates, he climbed down from the ladder and opened the book on the nearest table to inspect its pages and their contents with a scrutinizing eye.
“I apologize, Mr. Malfoy.” The receptionist said with another smile that was sickeningly sweet, “You see, I work in the emergency department, not in the maternity ward.”
The happy, soft smile that he found on her pink lip sent an unexpected pang of arousal coursing through his body as he felt himself start to grow agitated with need.
Draco’s body went rigid as he read the letter and slowly comprehended what it meant……..
“What letter?” Harriet asked as she stepped out of the bathroom.
Draco didn’t bother saying anything else to the healer or nodding to the loyal secretary from the Auror department that he had shared the bench with as he leapt from his seat and charged into Harriet’s room.
Regardless, his lips pursed and his eyes narrowed as he thought about the vivid scene that had played through his mind while he slept.
“Quite.” Draco nodded, “What about you?”
That didn’t matter. Sharing a kiss with his beloved after months of bitter parting was incredible enough. Draco felt like he may actually have a chance of breaking through the icy walls around Harriet’s stubborn heart.
Harriet was going to mention something else but Draco leaned in and captured her lips before she could force words from her throat.
A serene smile broke out across his thin lips.
“Draco reassured me it’s perfectly safe. I wish we would have had something like this when he was born.” Narcissa retorted as she laid against her pillows and placed the ultrasound picture on the heavy, ebony nightstand beside the damask, canopy bed she shared with Lucius.
Draco tried to focus on holding his tortured expression and not slipping into a smirk that celebrated the cleverness of using a pseudonym.
“George, Oliver, Katie.” Harriet politely spoke to each one in turn, “It’s brilliant to see you all again!”
Harriet thought that Hermione may be right.
Harriet glanced over at Draco and she tried not to laugh at the way his frown deepened as the other alpha mentioned his child.
Finally, he had a chance to connect with his mate.
He held the box carefully as he cracked it open and revealed its contents to Ron and Hermione.
—————————————————————
She wanted Draco to brew more of that potion he had given her.
Harriet was still too emotional to reply but she nodded curtly against his chest and Draco kissed her head a second time.
As the baby inside Harriet squirmed about, Draco’s eyes closely followed the movement. Harriet laughed when she realized that in that moment, Draco may well have forgotten that she and everyone else in the world existed.
Regardless, for the past year, Draco and Harriet had been very strict about using the contraception charm when they made love.
Draco stopped his ministrations as Harriet rolled onto her back long enough to look up into his eyes. She held his face in her hands, and smiled as she reassured him, “You’re going to do just fine, Draco. I’m worried about giving birth... and being a mother... and working….and all the other things that come with this, but I’m not worried about your devotion to our family at all.”
Harriet was eight months pregnant.
“Rest, my love,” Draco whispered soothingly as Harriet drifted off for a nap, “Rest~.”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief that Harriet had returned to him and it filled his heart with warmth as he watched her finally get to relax.
“I wasn’t suggesting that we should.” Draco shrugged as he sat back and Harriet relaxed again, “I only wanted a sample~.”
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
She lost track of the dry moans that escaped her throat as Draco finally got to properly appreciate all of the changes in his beloved.
He knew that he and Harriet would most likely be up multiple times through the night. It would be very inconvenient to have to traipse down the hallway in order to tend their child.
“Sleep well?” Harriet replied.
How long had it been since she had played?
The bungalow was polished and welcoming. There was a small kitchen over in the corner and a lovely sitting area in front of two massive glass panes that could be tapped with a wand to disappear and reappear so that the breeze from the ocean may be felt in its entirety.
Harriet couldn’t hear him any more.
The Malfoy heir glanced back at the receptionist and shot her a look of complete disbelief, as if she had betrayed him in the cruelest way imaginable.
Their baby.
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked.
It was a shame, but Harriet was already starting to nearly resent the child that her alpha was convinced she carried.
In fact, she began to begrudge agreeing to babysit little Rose at all. If she and Draco hadn’t cared for Hermione and Ron’s daughter, then perhaps Draco would have left his fleeting thoughts about his legacy as only that…….fleeting thoughts.
He had a son of his own, a little boy that would one day grow to be a man and inherit all that his noble family held.
“You two should go somewhere, just for a few days, you and Draco, alone.” Hermione urged.
“Oh?” Harriet asked as anticipation coiled in the base of her belly.
There may have been a spell to find that out in the wizarding world, but if there was, he had never heard of it.
Harriet had always been very independent, she didn’t need Draco watching her every second of every day.
He wanted his mate to know that she was royalty to him~.
“There isn’t a baby, Draco.” Harriet bluntly announced.
A week after Draco’s visit to the Roberts’ home, Harriet woke up late one morning and blinked as she looked around her humble apartment.
By the week of her due date, Harriet had gotten into the habit of sleeping on her side facing Draco, letting her rounded belly rest between.
As a former Death Eater, did Lucius Malfoy approve of his son siring a child with the Dark Lord’s defeater?
A smile lit up Harry’s face as he slipped two fingers gently in his wife and hit something…..firm.
The wounded expression on his face made Harriet frown and her heart twist in her chest.
During the weekends, Harriet was able to sit in the nursery and rummage through a couple of the boxes of items that Draco had purchased and stacked around the room.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Profits had dwindled since the war. It turned out that supporting a failed fascist movement which promoted racism and endorsed genocide was unpopular with many customers in the wizarding world.
That was a rare occasion, when Draco had visitors to his office.
It was difficult to say if Scorpius leaving for Hogwarts was harder for Draco and Harriet or himself and Lily.
Draco didn’t trust himself completely.
Gently, Draco rubbed the omega’s swollen womb until he felt a small jab land against his palm. His breath caught in his throat, but Harriet seemed too busy eating to notice.
Draco was cut off by the most heart-wrenching cry he had ever heard. It was primal and deep and it made him tremble in mortal terror for his lover as she nearly convulsed with the pain that came far again far too quickly for his liking.
Draco had to fight his mother, the house elves, and the slew of people his parents wanted to hire to do this and that for his nuptials to spend any time at all with his infant son.
His face was tense with anticipation as he heard commotion come from inside the dwelling.
Whether their baby had already arrived or not, Draco would certainly not be attending the next Malfoy board meeting.
She was completely reliant on Draco to take her back to her humble flat.
Draco heard his wife breathe easier as she laid her head against his chest.
“You’re not the one asking for forgiveness, love.” Draco whispered to her.
“Draco……” Harriet whimpered as she let out a tense breath.
“I’ll be in soon.” Draco nodded reassuringly.
“I hope it’s still here, anyway.” She mused as she led Draco by the hand down to the end of the street.
“I suppose we’ll find out in a little more than eleven years.” Harriet countered.
Since Draco had watched several educational videos, he had seen enough that he had become familiar with the concept of muggle television.
“What classes?” Draco asked as he narrowed his eyes at the muggle doctor.
Draco had charms on both himself and Harriet that documented the quality of their sleep each night and a special one just for her that dictated every available detail about her next cycle.
Before Ron could protest, Hermione dragged him up the steps to the shop and barged through the door.
There coupling had been an expression of romantic bliss, their kisses had been genuine and their loving gazed had been honest.
Draco was right.
Harriet and Draco both scrambled to sit up in bed as their soothing promise was ripped away.
If only-
It wasn’t that Draco had anything against the svelte waist that Harriet had possessed before their original passionate night, which had ended in Scorpius’s conception, but there was a part of him that missed her rounded belly.
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy.” Harriet replied with a soft smile.
Harriet had been wrong.
Potter was his, he knew it!
Slowly, Mr. Roberts stepped aside and welcomed his unexpected visitor into his home, “Well, Mr. Smith, won’t you come in?”
Let Draco practice.
“Why?........What’s happening this evening, Malfoy?” Harriet asked curiously.
————————————————————
“Well, we were going to, but things got so busy we decided to just show you.” Hermione beamed.
————————————————————
Draco crossed his arms and looked down at the miniature version of himself as he asked, “I’m terribly sorry to disturb you, but do you think you can be bothered to come in and share a meal with your family?”
That letter was not from Draco…….nor had it been delivered by an owl.
The way she writhed underneath him and pulled at his shirt, blonde hair when his lips found her aching nipples made his trousers tighten, but he ignored the sensation.
Harry’s voice was soft and sympathetic as he cooed to her, “I know it is, sweetheart. Let’s get you to-“
The fourth week after the alumni game, Harriet began to notice a change in herself.
Everything was finally ready, even the baby in her womb, which gently tightened underneath Harriet’s hand while she slept.
The clothing and the dinner reservations were easy, but the custom ring he had designed for Harriet required three long weeks to be crafted.
Harriet and Draco both acknowledged that the secret Malfoy was the best to have ever happened to them.
Regardless, amidst the publicity frenzy over the Malfoy bombshell, Harriet and her alpha faced a daunting task.
When it was finished and Harriet was satisfied with how it looked, Draco gathered the courage to wrap his arms around his mate from behind and nip at her earlobe as they stood together.
And Harriet was the only one that ever would.
She hoped that he wasn’t ill.
She felt her alpha pull away from their kiss.
Those sweet, whispered sentiments were the first sounds that Harriet heard as her green eyes slowly fluttered open.
Draco pounded down the hallway so quickly he could feel the impact from every step shooting up through his legs. Hermione followed breathlessly behind him and as he reached the bedroom where his mother’s voice had come from, he realized she was there, but he paid her no mind.
Harriet stood and tied her night robe loosely around her swollen middle. Using magic, she carefully unlocked the bedroom door and silently padded out into the hallway.
