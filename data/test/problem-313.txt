Draco frowned, his eyes wandering as Harry walked towards the wardrobe. “What are you doing?” he asked curiously, eyebrow raised. Harry looked at him as though he had two heads. “Getting dressed, why?” he asked, opening the wardrobe door. Although they spent every single night sleeping in the same bed, Draco must’ve missed the memo when Harry moved all of his clothes into his room. The thought caused his cheeks to stain with the pinkest blush.
Harry nodded in agreement, he wandered over to the heater on the back wall of the living room and turned the dial. “Should come on soon,” he smiled, returning to the sofa. Once sat down, Draco shifted closer to him and pulled the blanket over the other man, covering almost the entirety of his body.
“Nothing.” Harry replied simply, turning his body towards his desk. “Right well, I briefed Kingsley, you did the field report, we’ve sorted the evidence out. I’ll ask Dean and Seamus to assist Auror Endelton to the Cabin for investigation, I’ll ask someone from spell damage to go with them just incase,” he ran a hand through his hair, he seemed to be picking the habit up from Draco. “If you go down to International and maybe see if they’ve reported any of the Celtic Serpent group in their countries, maybe we can figure out if it’s worldwide, uh.” he trailed off, frowning. Draco stood still, listening to Harry intently, he nodded his head in agreement and waited. “I’ll speak to Hermione, I know the Unspeakables can’t tell us anything but if we share it with the Department of Mysteries maybe they won’t be so…”
----------------
“Litter?” he frowned. Potter shook his head, causing Draco to huff. “Loo?”
“Oh hush Draco, you’re such a boring bastard,” chided Louisa, swatting his arm with the back of her hand. Louisa was just lucky he loved the bloody wretch. “What’re you having?” Louisa asked, looking towards Weasley, a smile never leaving her face.
Lavender walked through the side door, her eyes resting on Harry. “What’s wrong with him? Is he hit?” She asked frantically. Dean shook his head, patting Harry’s shoulder.
, Draco.
“I have no idea, Dean and Seamus ran off about twenty minutes said it was important, Brown and Henderson got called into the Minister’s office and I think I just saw Draco go in to your office.” he said slowly, looking up at Harry with a frown. “Why?”
. It is shining brightly while my quill is scratching over the parchment. I need to
I’m thinking that you’ll need to give me some extra special TLC when I’m at last in your arms. Every part of me, body and soul is crying out to be with you. I can’t wait to wrap my arms around that newly ‘rounded’ waist of yours (I’m sure Pansy was only being honest!) and show you exactly how much I’ve missed you…
I love you,
“I did actually notice, Potter, thank you,” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. Walking forwards, he didn’t bother to check whether Potter was actually following; he just wandered over to the counter to order two cups of the usual lacklustre, really quite dire tea. It reminded him a bit of Aunt Bella’s tea, except less poison and more sugar.
“This is brilliant, Malfoy!” Potter praised, a smile appearing on his rosy lips. Draco couldn’t help but lick his own lips, soon realising what he was doing and quickly ducked his head down. “Oh, okay then,” Draco said quietly, he could feel the heat in his cheeks - he’d been thinking all night about his conversation with Hermione. Why was Potter asking about him? It was slowly driving him around the bend, he was sure.
Over the next few days, Harry and Draco got together to carefully plot out their plan to stake out the warehouse. They’d found it on the first day after following the man's colleague Mandy, she wasn’t exactly very covert, the sound of her high heels echoed throughout the entire alleyway. If they were
“That’s not how you buy pizza, Potter.” he scowled, wandering over to the kitchen. Their apartment was a breezy open plan, although it was above a dominos Draco had worked tirelessly to extend the apartment, they’d bought it several months after renting it and it now resembled nothing of the rundown dingy place it once was. The walls were a soft cream colour, the entire flat floored with laminate. Floor to ceiling windows adorned the area, the kitchen dark wood and marble tops - Draco was proud of the kitchen, he’d learnt to cook pretty relentlessly. There were so many times Harry would come home and see Draco leaning over a cookbook, scowling and swearing about that bloody Jamie Oliver.
Once all four of them arrived back at the Premier Inn, as fate would have it once again there were only two rooms available. Draco definitely didn’t want to share a room with Louisa and Weasley, of course he loved her to bits but there were certain parts of that woman even he didn’t particularly want to experience. So in one room housed Louisa and Weasley and the other Potter and Draco.
“I’ve been asking myself the same question for years,” came Harry's reply.
“You really should start dating again, Draco,” Hermione said, looking at him with a pained, sympathetic expression on her face. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t
“Sir, I have a memo here from Kingsley.” Endelton smiled, handing the piece of parchment over to Harry, who smiled in return. He began to scan the file in front of him, a frown appearing. After, he looked to Draco and nodded towards their office, thanking Endelton.
Potter’s eyes widened, he nodded slowly and cleared his throat. The other man was clearly awkward too, why the hell did he keep doing this? Draco was about to pull his newly returned wand out and just hex the bastard, maybe if he threw a few unforgivables around he’d get put in the Janus Thickey ward, because obviously he was losing his mind.
it before.
Exiting the bedroom, Draco locked the door behind him and walked down to the lobby, where he met a rather dishevelled looking Louisa. The look on her face was pure elation, it made his heart skip a little. When he first met this woman, she was suffering pretty badly, he’d seen her turn into this confident beauty in front of him.
“Except we didn’t, we didn’t find out anything - we got trapped in a supply room and talked for the better part of five hours,” Draco pointed out, nudging Harry back in response. “Not only that, a visit to the Ministry and St. Mungo’s and they took my bloody book.”
And I didn’t reply. I was too busy looking at you lips while you spoke. How red they were, Draco. How soft they looked. I didn’t reply because all I could possibly think about was kissing you.
” he drawled. Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Thanks.” Endelton grinned. Henderson jogged towards Draco, kneeling down beside the blond. “I think we need to get Auror Malfoy to St. Mungo’s now.” she said, a note of worry in her voice. Harry had bound his perp, unfortunately the other two had gotten away. The anti apparition charm had been broken the second Seamus had brought down the back wizard. The other Celtic Serpents that had been behind had vanished too.
A quick chat with Hermione, and Harry was on his way back to his office with what was the onset of a migraine. He could feel it pounding against his temples. He stopped as he entered his department, raising an eyebrow as Robards stood over Lockwood’s desk, eyeing it suspiciously. “Everything alright?” Harry asked, walking towards the older Auror. “Hm, fine.” he huffed out, walking away from Harry. Looking down at the desk, Harry noted that it was encased in a warding spell, he could feel the delicate tingle of magic wash over him as he got closer. He mentally filed weird the encounter in his ‘weird things Robards does’ area of his mind, before entering the office to find an impatient Draco.
“At least we have three.” nodded Lavender, they made their way towards Draco and levitated him up. Harry bit his bottom lip hard. “I’ll take Draco to St. Mungos, Dean, you and Seamus take him to the Ministry” He gestured his head towards the man they’d taken, with Seamus’ impressive crotch Stupefy. “Lavender you take Lockwood, Endelton and Henderson take the one back there. Put Lockwood in maximum security, the rest in the holding cells.” He pointed over his shoulder at the perp he’d taken down. Watching the expressions of his team, there was no way he could keep any of them out of the loop now. He’d told Kingsley his team worked better when they were all together. Without Lavender today he’d not have been able to do what he had. She was an invaluable member of his team. He smiled fondly at the woman beside him.
“Auror Lockwood said something to me the last time I spoke to him, he said ‘I wonder how the guys are doing with those crop circles’ and I just shrugged. I didn’t like him very much, he was a bit of a pompous prick,” Draco’s sentence was a said just a little faster than his usual tone, he was surely excited about this find. “I never thought about it at the time, but he inadvertently slipped up, or maybe he meant to do it but I just didn’t think about it.”
Lavender’s eyes wandered to Harry, she looked as though she was going to say something so Harry waited expectantly. However she ducked her head down and began scribbling something on a scrap of parchment that lay next to her. Once she’d finished, she walked quickly over to Harry and passed him the offending parchment. He nodded his head and stepped back.
Potter let out a snort, pulling Draco out of his comfortable musings. “What?” he asked the man, frowning. It seemed his eyes were no longer focusing properly, most unfortunate. Potter had a wide smile on his face, he looked very handsome like this.
Sorry it's so late, I've had quite a few personal problems lately. Next chapter is coming very soon.
The fifth time it happened, it was about two weeks after the last incident and Draco by now was entirely convinced Potter was a raging homophobe, deciding to ignore and avoid him over a bloody book. It was not as though Draco was trying to jump his bones or something.
Dear Harry,
It wasn’t that Draco was jealous, but he worried about Louisa. It had only been two days since she’d met him, but then again Draco was a natural born worrier.
“Are you straight?” she asked, her eyes never moving from Potter’s face for one second, the man’s cheeks pinked slightly, he ducked his head down and cleared his throat. “Err, no.. I’m not.” he stammered, rubbing the back of his neck.
Seamus grinned enthusiastically and grabbed his robes, which were slung over the back of his office chair. Dean was immaculately dressed which always impressed Draco. “Right, coordinates are here, I’ll meet you there.” Draco said, before disapparating.
He definitely likes me, he mused.
Louisa cleared her throat and fiddled with the hem of her top. “Maybe.”
watch that movie without a lot of sweets.
Harry watched him intently, they’d been this close together before - but it had never felt like this before. He could see all of the flecks in Draco’s eyes, all of the marks and blemishes on his face, he smiled.
A glimpse of green light had Harry immediately draw his wand from it’s holster, alerting the other two who followed suit quickly after. “Did you see that?” Harry whispered, inching closer to Draco who nodded. “Seamus, left - I’ll go in first, Draco to the right.” they all nodded in unison and Harry began walking forwards, quickly disappearing through the trees. Seamus walked off to the left and crouched down, eyes scanning the forest floor. He began casting for spell traces again, his eyes landing on a steady flow of magic leading further into the forest. He inwardly groaned as he stood up, quietly walking in to the forest clearing.
“I love you too.” Harry said, leaning forwards he pressed his lips to Draco’s, the blond’s eyes widened, he smiled against Harry’s lips his eyes drifting closed.
“I wondered if maybe I could assist with the cabin?” she asked quietly, looking down at her feet. Harry thought for a moment, but shook his head. “Actually, I have another task for you - I need you and Henderson to go to the murder victims house, we found something at the crop circle area, I want to double check all the areas just in case we missed something there too.” Lavender’s eyes widened and she nodded. “Yes sir, does that mean we’ll be going back to the warehouse too?” she asked hesitantly. Harry thought for a moment then nodded slowly. “Yes, I still have the warehouse secured, but that’ll be tomorrow now.”
“Alright then, let’s go see another Quidditch match.” he said after a few moments, sounding utterly defeated.
“Lockwood, you fucking traitor!” Seamus growled. Dean moved closer to Seamus and whispered “There’s an anti apparition charm all around this area, I tried to side-along Draco, but it didn’t work.” he kept his eyes on Lockwood at all times. Seamus idly wondered if the cloaked person casting in the back had set up the anti apparition charm. He cursed under his breath.
“What we watching today?” Harry asked, squinting at the screen. His box of chow mein had been so hot it steamed his glasses up. “Something about dolphins.” Draco mumbled in response, sticking his fork into the clear plastic container. “Cool.”
It had been six hours since Draco was admitted to St Mungos. Harry had paced up and down the corridor, consumed more coffee from the lackluster vending machine than he should’ve and had several visits from different people. The first being Lavender who’d come straight to the hospital from the Ministry.
“Did you catch my pumpkin thief? Was it Jim? I told you!” she pointed at them, shaking her finger. Harry bit his lip, trying to hold back a laugh. Draco cleared his throat and nodded his head. “We caught the pumpkin thief, it was apparently Tommy Jenkins, is that name familiar to you?” Harry noticed Draco had tried to sound as professional as possible but really, it was a case about a missing batch of pumpkins.
He would complain, bitterly.
On this very occasion I don't find you ridiculous, I'm not rolling my eyes (though perhaps a little impressed by this vocabulary, I'm clearly rubbing off on you in more ways than one, wink) I'm actually smiling. The week before Brighton, when we planted flowers in Grimmauld you picked up a white rose, held it to my head and said "Look Draco, I found you in flower form,"
“If we win, I’ll buy you a drink.” winked Potter.
"Well, if you're not busy, maybe you want to help?" he offered hopefully, a small smile gracing his lips as he read Draco's extensive notes; they were very well detailed descriptions of random strangers he'd come across. "Can I read this?"
I have some great news actually, I secured the contract with St. Mungo’s on the Wolfsbane Potion, so we’re going to be supplying them with the majority of their Wolfsbane supply. Obviously Theo is extremely happy about this, it means Daphne will stop whining at him about wasting his time with something that won’t pay him enough galleons. Honestly, she wasn’t this exhausting and ghastly at school.
“Draco.” Harry breathed, waving his hand for him to come over. Draco walked towards him, looking at him expectantly. “What?” he looked in the direction Harry was fixed to, his eyes widening. “What…” he breathed, he held his hand out to pick up the object but thought better of it.
spell you use smells a little too much like tulips to hide the truth. Well, I truly don’t mind, love. The idea of you lying there lonely in our bed for the next few weeks is an awful one for me to bear.
“Tell me tomorrow,” Potter whispered, leaning a little closer. Draco’s heart almost stopped, he slid down the bed and cleared his throat, turning on to his side away from Potter. “Okay, goodnight Potter.” he said quickly, closing his eyes and pulling the duvet up to his neck.
Maybe Draco was just overthinking it, like he usually did. He inwardly cursed himself - he always did this. If Harry had an ounce of interest in him he’d have told him years ago, after all he had the Gryffindor courage, not Draco. Sighing, he nudged Harry gently. They had work tomorrow and he knew if he let him sleep on the sofa he’d have a cranky Harry in the morning. The last time they’d done this he’d woken up with a stiff neck and he’d never stopped banging on about it all day. It drove Draco around the twist.
Advancing quickly, Harry quickly cast an anti-apparation barrier around the warehouse and entered the side door, inside the warehouse was pitch black, he squinted waiting for his eyes to adjust to the new lighting.
Love,
- Pansy told me she was playing bloody footsie with her under the table. It seems this whole date thing will happen way sooner than anticipated. However, I really don’t think you should become a journalist Harry, could you imagine yourself hounding other people for stories? You’d probably apologise for coming within thirty feet of someone. I think you're probably best suited to your current position, even if I hate it.
Draco could almost feel the angst radiating off Harry’s body, he cleared his throat. “Harry, what aren’t you telling me?” he asked, narrowing his eyes. He could tell there was something
Walking next to him, Draco looked as lost in thought as Harry was. Since they’d found the Celtic Serpent trinket box in Lucius’ vault, the other man has seemed distracted, on edge. Draco worked damn hard to prove himself to the Ministry, they were ready to throw the towel in and declare him more of a nuisance than he was worth. After all, how could the Ministry of Magic protect people if those people didn’t trust them? For all Draco had proved himself, there were people who didn’t quite agree with an ex-Death Eater being a part of the Ministry.
Draco looked down at his arm. He began to tap lightly on his wrist and nodded his head, as though a deeply intriguing thing had just happened. “It’s quarter-past the freckle.”
Potter merely shrugged his shoulders, mimicking Draco’s movements and taking a sip of his own drink. “Of all the people in the world I never would’ve expected
“I see..” Potter said, nodding his head, as though trying to convince himself of something. Draco snorted and shook his head at the dark haired wizard, he picked his glass up and took a sip. “What?” he finally asked, looking up at Potter expectantly.
“Yes well, semantics.” Draco declared, shaking his hand in a circular motion. “Put your bloody clothes back on you heathen.” he shook his head, trying to sound as put out as he possibly could. Harry just laughed and unbuckled his belt, tossing it onto the sofa.
“Right, well we haven’t had any more cases come through our department, yourself and Brown are free to get lunch.” he offered her a weak smile, she nodded curtly at Harry, then Draco before exiting the office closing the door behind her.
Harry nodded and waved him off, watching as the blonde exited the office. He sighed and looked down at his case pile, it was going to be a long day. The top folder was purple, which meant it was from their Spell Damage department, he remembered getting the folder detailing Ron’s spell damage, it was so extensive they thought he would lose the use of his leg and for the Wizarding World that was rare, especially with their advances in healing and spellwork.
you know the look.
“Well, Auror Potter, we better get back to the office and type up this report about the pumpkins.” Harry teased, grinning at Draco, who looked utterly confused, all of a sudden it clicked and he blushed, his eyes widening a little. “Shut up, you idiot.” his features changing to a scowl, shaking his head. He took off a little ahead of Harry and stood at the gate, his arms folded.
Harry stood up too, a little closer than intended and he offered Draco a warm smile. “Time for bed I guess.” Potter said, looking towards the bed, then back to Draco. They stood awkwardly for a few moments, before Draco let out a laugh.
Potter rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help but smile at Draco’s ridiculous statement. “Alright, you got me, but really, what time is it?” Harry nudged him lightly with his elbow. Draco shrugged his shoulders and sighed, leaning back into absolutely nothing. “Fuck I keep forgetting this shite Cafe doesn’t have proper bloody chairs.” He slapped his hands down abruptly, causing Harry to jump in surprise.
What he didn't expect to see though, was Harry Potter stalking around a street corner with quite a lot of concentration and intent etched onto his features. He'd bulked up a lot, his muscles now more noticeably defined through the tight black v-neck t-shirt. He was also wearing a pair of extremely tight black jeans and some beat up looking trainers. 'He'd look smart if it wasn't for those trainers,' Draco thought.
When they left Gringotts, trinket box safely shielded and removed from the vault, they apparated to the Ministry and immediately made their way to Kingsley’s office. It was about 6pm now, so Harry knew most of the Auror’s would’ve gone home. Once stood outside the office, Harry gently knocked on the door. Hearing the boom of Kingsley’s voice, they entered together and shut the door behind them.
Draco’s head snapped towards Harry, who had put on Whitney Houston. A tsk escaped Draco’s lips before he could reign it in, causing Harry to chuckle lightly. “Come on, give her a chance Draco,” Harry said, shaking his head at the blonde.
Draco was feeling a mix of discomfort and vulnerability, there was something oddly intimate about sleeping in the same bed as someone else, like you’re sharing the same space, for all Draco knew Potter could kill him in the night. Draco could hear a low, consistent thump from the next room, he squinted into the darkness of the room. “What’s that noise?” he whispered to Potter, trying to place it in his mind.
Caught off guard, Draco looked up and shook his head. “I hadn’t planned on it,” a frown creased his brow, he began to aimlessly chop his pancakes up on his plate. “Why do you ask?”
I love you, now and always,
I’m glad to hear about Pansy though. She might be the snarkiest witch that we know but she’s been a good friend to us both. You know, I wouldn’t be terribly surprised if she and Ginny were to follow us down the aisle before much longer. Now that they’re together I should think that things will move speedily along. Merlin, but she’ll be a bridezilla and no mistake! She was forceful enough when you and I got married. All that fuss over the right colour for our robes. I still can’t tell the difference between Egyptian white and ivory. No doubt that her and Ginny’s ceremony will be the wedding of the wizarding year.
“Have you seen this one?” Draco asked, trying to make conversation. Draco was a serial talker, he would talk through any movie whether he’d seen it or not, often asking the other person what happens next or making up wild theories in his head then expressing them in vivid detail. Bethany had said it was the most annoying thing she’d ever seen in her life, and she had to put up with periods. Draco had cringed at that.
Draco rolled his eyes as she turned her back and sent a wicked smirk Harry’s way. “Touch the chocolate digestives and I’ll break your fingers, Potter.” he sauntered in the house ahead of him, leaving Harry at the doorstep. “Oh no you don’t Malfoy!” he shouted as he ran in after him.
“Oh, but what about dessert?” suggested Louisa, giving Draco a pleading look. For such a petite woman, Louisa didn’t half know how to eat. Whenever they were in company they didn’t know so well she’d order a salad, but in private they’d gorge themselves on pizzas, kebabs, burgers, well anything really.
As for your lack of faith in my journalistic abilities, Draco, I think I might have to concede your point. Last night I ended up apologising to Ron because he woke me with his snoring! I wouldn’t last six minutes at the
“Oh?” Potter replied, a slight smile forming on his lips. “Why would you want to see me, Malfoy?” he asked, his eyes flicked towards Louisa once again, Draco frowned. He wasn’t surprised Potter would find Louisa attractive, the woman could pull any man she wanted to by just clicking her bloody fingers. It was a trait Draco wished he had for himself. The last Draco had actually heard from Potter was he was dating Ginny Weasley, who was also part of a Quidditch team. Holyhead Harpies, as he remembered it.
They sat in silence for around twenty minutes before Healer Jenkins and another healer Harry hadn’t met before entered the room. The woman walked towards Draco’s bed, pulled her wand out and cast an incantation, Harry watched confused and awed at the same time. His entire body illuminated with specks of gold and silver, before dulling down, turning to a deep red.
Pulled out of his musings, Harry looked towards the front door as the doorbell rang. “Pizza,” Harry smiled, he nudged Draco who shifted away slightly. Standing up, Harry made his way to the front door, looked through the peephole before opening the door. Draco quickly cast an accio to a blanket from the bedroom and wrapped it around his body, smiling gratefully as Harry returned to the sofa with two boxes of Domino’s pizza.
It stands to reason, I think, that you got pregnant so quickly. Whenever we’ve cast magic together or brewed potions the results have always been spectacular haven’t they? We’ll have to be a little bit careful in the future though, love: I read in one of Hermione’s books that once a wizard has gotten pregnant, their second baby can happen awfully quickly. Something to do with the fertility potions remaining in your magical core. The language was all a bit wordy for me, but you get the picture. I mean,
Running a hand through his hair, Draco looked down at his sad excuse for a plate of pancakes and sighed. The past few nights he really had not been able to sleep, tossing and turning for hours. It was driving him a little bit insane if he was honest.
“So?” asked Draco, who’d begun chewing his lip a little harder, though he stopped once he could taste the metallic flavour of blood, something that seemed to become more and more familiar with Draco. However, he wasn’t sure when he had developed this anxious tic.
though. Dropping a whole case of Wolfsbane? Not using even the simplest of levitating spells? That isn’t like you at all, Draco. You should have told Theo to sod off when he called you names! It make my hackles rise to even
Harry had wandered a little further than he’d previously intended but he was convinced he’d seen the dark figure of someone running through the forest. He heard a rustle behind him and turned around swiftly, his eyes settling on Seamus who looked at him sheepishly. “Sorry I didn’t know where I was going, everything looks the bloody same.” he whispered, Harry nodded in agreement and motioned to the north. Seamus nodded too. “Have you seen Draco?” Harry whispered back, scanning the area. “No, not yet mate.” he whispered back.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted, stalking out his bedroom and towards the offending coffee table, he kicked the leg and picked the wand up, holstering it. “Fucking stupid thing” he groaned, turning around to face Draco, who’d followed behind him. Draco sighed and apparated.
Potter let out a breath and smiled. “Do you want to go with me?”
“Unspeakable Zabini is one of our deep undercover Unspeakables, his cover being Gringotts.” he started, Harry’s eyes widened his head immediately snapping towards Draco, who looked equally shocked. “Unspeakable Zabini has a lot of connections, as well as a lot of skills that we do not like to announce to the public.”
My beloved Draco,
“Where’s that tea you promised me anyway?” Harry asked through a mouthful of food. “You better not have lied about that you know, it was a deal breaker.” he grinned. Draco rolled his eyes and stood up, walking towards the kitchen. He washed his hands under the tap and set to preparing Harry a cup of tea. After he’d finished, he walked back to the sofa and handed the cup to the raven haired man, who wiped his hands on the sides of his jeans.
"Alright Malfoy?" Came a voice from beside him, Draco spun around and fixed Potter with a scowl. “What have I told you about heart attacks, Potter?” Draco spat, brushing down his suit jacket. He’d opted for a regular charcoal suit today; he’d given up on robes quite a while ago. Not for any other reason than societal norms making absolutely no impact on Draco these days.
“Have you got a camera?” Potter replied, a cheeky smile on his face. The edges of Draco’s mouth turned upwards into a slight smile, he rolled his eyes. “What are you having?” asked Draco, gesturing towards the menu. Pursing his lips, Potter snatched the menu out of Draco’s hand and began scouring the list.
Kingsley walked forwards, towards the staircase in front of them and turned his head. “Well, now is as good as you’re going to get.” the Minister stated, before he walked out of sight. Harry looked around, scanning the faces of Aurors around them. He wandered over to Henderson who was appointed to guard the front doors and leaned forwards “Henderson, please send an owl to Narcissa Malfoy about Draco’s state, mention nothing but request a firecall with her.” it came out as a whisper, she nodded and turned on her heel.
“I suppose not, no.” Potter said, he looked perhaps disappointed. Draco chewed the inside of his lip and let out a sigh. “So, you wanted to watch movies, yes?”
“I don’t know who left this here, but there’s been another murder.” Draco sighed. He picked up his wand from his desk and waited for Harry. Harry quickly ran to the other side of the office, grabbed his supplies and nodded towards his partner. “Lets go.” he said simply. Draco looked down at the parchment once again to get the coordinates and held his arm out for Harry to side-along. Harry gave Draco a reassuring smile, before they disappeared with a pop.
” she exclaimed, pointing through Draco’s black tinted windows at the man standing beside the black Bentley. Draco turned his head, he rolled his eyes. “Well, it seems we didn’t need the tickets to see Potter.” Louisa shot a sideways glance at Draco, a scowl on her face.
had hit me directly in the chest.
Draco.
And yes, I bet you never imagined you’d be hearing those words escape from my lips.
“S-She, well, my father was, he was put in Azkaban, my mother, she hated the Manor so she bought a cottage and I was helping her plant some flowers, but because nobody really likes us anymore, with us being well, you know,” he said awkwardly, the discomfort was evident on Draco’s face, he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, knocking against Potter. “I-I she has some health issues, so I’ve been brewing her potions, and I-I read.”
“Yeah?” he asked, but he really wasn’t paying attention - looking down at Draco’s lips they were perfect, it hadn’t been the first time Harry thought about kissing Draco, but he’d never come this close to actually
“Right..” Harry mumbled, looking back towards the television. Suddenly, he didn’t really feel like watching anything so he turned the television off and stood up, straightening himself out. He looked down at his pyjamas and bit his lip. Maybe if he made a little more effort, he thought.
Louisa blushed, ducking her head down. “Yeah you could say that.” she smiled. “Ron and Harry have gone off to do a match, they left pretty early though.” she shrugged. Draco nodded, that explained quite a lot, though he did wonder why Potter hadn’t told him about that.
“Uh, hey Malfoy,” Potter said, sitting on the bench across from him. The other man looked awkward, out of place and entirely uncomfortable. “How are you?” he asked finally, his eyes fixed to Draco’s plate of pancakes, avoiding his gaze.
“Five minutes, I’ll see you there,” Harry said, before jogging out of the department.
. Spilling my words on the verge of my wedding. Tomorrow Draco I’ll meet you at the Altar and I need for you to understand.
When you go to sleep tonight, I want you to close your eyes and imagine my arms wrapped securely around your middle. My face will be nuzzling your silken blond hair. Both of our bodies will be pressed tightly together, love. We’ll be one long line of heat that stretches right down to the very tips of our toes.
Draco wandered over to the sofa and sat down beside Harry, throwing his snacks onto the coffee table. Chewing his lower lip in thought, he turned his head towards Harry and took in a deep breath, exhaling slowly. “I don’t think it was the paper that cursed me,” he said, knitting his brows together. “The box, the one in my father's vault, I felt something on it, I used wards but if it was blood magic it would’ve gotten through.” he said.
Looking up at Harry with teary eyes, Draco let out another shaky breath, tears began to pour down his pale cheeks, glistening in the harsh light of their office. Harry placed his free hand on Draco’s cheek. “You’re okay.” he whispered, nodding his head. He offered Draco a sad smile, he knew his partner was hurting.
“Oh well,” he laughed. Lockwood leant forwards, licking his lips again. Hermione felt deeply uncomfortable, she turned her head towards Wilson who was the epitome of cool and impassive, she couldn’t help but feel impressed by her colleague. “Yes, I suppose I am.” he finally said, he eyed up Hermione - she felt suddenly sick, as though he was eyeing her for his next meal. Lavender had written the exact same thing in her report of their capture. It was an accurate description of this man.
Yours forever,
Harry replies from his safe-house in France.
“Morning,” he smiled, kissing her on the cheek lightly. Louisa smiled in response, brushing a strand of her golden blonde hair out of her face. “Sleep well?” he asked, his eyes drifting around the large lobby towards the reception desk. “Yes, actually.” Louisa nodded, a light blush stained her cheeks.
It’s daft really. I’ve never been as sure as anything in my life as I am about marrying you, yet sleep is eluding me. I’m lying here in the Weasley-Granger’s spare-bloody-bed (and yes, I can assure you, it’s as uncomfortable as we imagined) and you, my love, are all I can think about.
“No wards?” Potter asked, closing the door behind him after he entered. Draco merely shrugged his shoulders. “Not really much point, I live in muggle London and I’m rarely in the Wizarding World,” he walked inside, through the corridor and into the kitchen, pacing the pizza box down on his kitchen counter. “I can’t say anyone has ever really tried to find me.” Draco finally added. He turned around to face Potter, who was looking curiously around Draco’s kitchen.
Sighing dramatically, Harry nodded his head and folded his arms, putting them on the table in front of him and slumped his chin on top of them. “I know, but I wish I wasn’t," he mumbled.
anger Harry, but it was the fact Draco had not told him that hurt the most. It was written in perfect handwriting, not too different to Draco’s but Harry had spent enough time and read enough of Draco’s writing to know it wasn’t his.
“Much better than
“Nothing.” he said between food, earning a grimace from Draco, who promptly scolded him for his terrible table manners. Something he did frequently. Draco hummed and began eating.
“Wanna watch a movie then?” Potter asked, gesturing with his shoulder towards the square television. Draco nodded, feeling somewhat awkward again. The alcohol had helped loosen him up, but now he was sobering he felt the effects of his anxiety come back tenfold. It was really an annoying trait of his.
okay?” He whispered into his neck. The action startled Draco, he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and closed his eyes. “Yes,” He replied simply. “You look like shit.”
Had I known you’d have this sort of reaction I’d not have told you until you returned, I was just so excited. I hope you’re okay to continue the mission - I don’t want you distracted and ending up dismembered or dead, if you die Potter I’ll bring you back just to kill you myself!
“You hated Drag Me to Hell more though.” Harry smirked, they began to walk together towards the forest boundary keeping an eye out for any movements, though all they’d noticed were a few birds and a deer poking its head out of the trees. “That one was pretty bad, that crazy gypsy lady? I wouldn’t have said no to her, Merlin.” Draco sighed, shaking his head at the memory. “I don’t know why you insist on watching those movies, I much preferred Titanic.” Draco stated, narrowing his eyes at the raven haired man.
“Your face, it’s -” Harry trailed off when the witch behind the counter handed them two scalding cups of tea, Potter had specified he’d like quite a lot of milk, however she’d not listened clearly. Perhaps Draco had imagined Potter asking, he wasn’t quite sure where his brain had wandered off to.
“They found the pumpkin thief.” he said shaking his head in disbelief. Harry raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Who was it?”
“We meet every Sunday for coffee, Potter,” Draco said, correctively. “It’s not the same as having an actual friend, you know, to actually talk to. I heard you and Luna are very good friends these days.”
Draco held his breath, staring up at Harry with such intensity. When Kingsley had explained the details Draco had clammed up immediately. His thoughts wild, intense and terrifying. There was nothing scarier than the threat of Voldemort, especially for himself and his parents. But now everything had changed, the only person in the world Draco wished to protect was the man in front of him. Nothing else mattered but Harry. He’d come to this startling realisation when they’d entered that house, he shivered at the thought.
There was a distinct difference between Draco and Harry when they got up in the morning, for one Harry would shout and swear at his alarm, whereas Draco would just turn the alarm off as he got out of bed. Harry would likely fall out of bed and after yelling obscenities for about twenty minutes, you’d hear sound of his en-suite shower. Draco was naturally always ready before Harry, even if Harry put very little effort into his outward appearance.
he’d done it, but nevertheless he did.
Our case is close to finishing soon, I’m sure of it. We’ve nearly got enough evidence to put before the Wizengamot and be guaranteed of a conviction. Those Horntail eggs that I told you about? They were 100% genuine. The smugglers are convinced that Mils and I want to buy them. Once the eggs hatch, then the final counterfeit transaction can take place. That’s when we’ll make the arrests.
Harry,
Your poor owl, Draco. If bird’s faces could show shock or surprise then I think his would do so right now. Hercules knows that something had changed, lovely. He’s flapping about in a very agitated manner. As for me, I’m going to have a very strong coffee, tell Ron our fantastic news and then I’m going to compose you a real reply that isn’t just the inane, foolish ramblings of a wizard that has just been given the best news of his life.
Draco cleared his throat and dove into the inner workings of a Quidditch match, explaining what the quaffle did, the goals, it essentially wasn’t that different to football, except obviously the flying and the bats.
It was odd, although Draco didn’t actually have very many friends, he’d made rather an unexpected friend in Hermione Granger, completely by accident of course. By extension of that, he’d made friends with Weasley. Every Sunday, they’d arrange to meet in a random cafe and chat about nonsensical rubbish, but it gave Draco the little bit of human contact he actually needed. Or rather, he wished he didn’t need.
I slept in, I usually sleep like actual shit.” Potter said, shaking his head. Flashing Draco a small smile, he shoved his hands into his worse for wear looking coat.
“So seems like we have had a super productive day then.” Draco scowled. Harry nodded and leant back in his chair, letting out a breath. “What do you fancy for dinner tonight?” Harry asked, mentally going through their list of choices. They couldn’t have Dominos two days in a row, although Harry wouldn’t protest Draco certainly would.
Draco lifted his wand towards Lockwood, his hands clenching the wood as though he’d drop it any minute. He could feel his headache increasing, his vision blurry. ‘Do not pass out’ he willed himself. “Petrificus Totalus!” he bellowed, hitting Lockwood in the back before he succumbed to the darkness.
her the proof, but as fate had it, Louisa’s older sister Bethany was a muggleborn witch, it was evident she loved her sister with her whole heart, Draco sometimes wondered what it would be like to have a sibling, or maybe someone who loved him as much as Louisa loved Bethany.
Draco thought for a moment, before smiling. “I don’t know, farmers?”
“Same as the other one.” she said when she caught Harry’s eyes on her. He nodded. “Right.” Harry walked towards the bed, settling on Draco’s right side. The sides of his hair still covered in blood, but he was now wearing St. Mungo’s pyjamas. Harry frowned. “Why didn’t they clean him up?” he asked, his eyes narrowing. Hermione sighed, “They probably didn’t want to touch the wound.” she offered, sitting down on a wooden chair near the window.
“Don’t you like chocolate?” Potter asked, he’d never once left his side, which Draco had decided to over analyse the entire time.
Potter let out a noise of approval and nodded his head. “That’s cool, I obviously joined the Montrose Magpies,” he said, looking down at the dessert menu. Draco stole a quick glance in Potter’s direction, it seemed he was as uncomfortable as Draco which offered some comfort at least. “I was with the Cannons for a couple months before that, though.”
“Where was I?” she asked, picking up another cup she passed it to Draco who took it appreciatively and began to sip, he pursed his lips and placed it back down on the tray. “Thank you, it’s lovely.”
“We’ll figure it out.” Draco sighed, rooting through his paperwork. “What you got there?” asked Harry, who’d turned towards Draco and wandered over to peer over his shoulder. “Nothing interesting, holiday requests.” he shrugged, pulling out his quill from the drawer in his desk. For holiday requests, there was a special quill and ink in scarlet red, they’d changed the procedure after Aurors were caught forging holiday documents for extra time off.
“I think that yourself, Auror Malfoy, Finnigan and Thomas should be the only Auror’s working this case.” Harry frowned. Endelton, Henderson and Brown were important parts of his team, but he couldn’t disagree that the spy may be within his department. Dean and Seamus were inherently trustworthy and would stick by his side no matter what. Kingsley had been skeptical when Harry first told him Draco would be his deputy, but the sheer volume and quality of his work spoke more than his past.
They wanted to fix each other.
However, rereading your letter, I think that I ought to be more worried about
Jeanette Henderson was quite an excellent Auror, although she didn’t possess much muscle, she was a wicked shot in a duel, her duelling skills were unparalleled. She was about five foot seven, petite with long curly blonde hair usually tied up into a pony-tail.  Obviously a quite attractive woman, Harry could appreciate, Jean was far too quiet for her own good. Perhaps that was why Harry was so shocked to see her converse with Lavender.
Harry felt uneasy lying to the other Auror’s about this cases existence, he knew Lavender was itching to do more than what they were doing - although Endelton was the most irritating man he’d ever met, the man got things that needed to be done, done. Henderson was quiet, but her duelling was vital to their operation and Lavender’s sheer strength was always comforting.
They sat in silence for around thirty minutes before only the sound of their ragged breaths sent Harry into sort of a half panic; he felt unbelievably claustrophobic these days. “I hope someone comes to save us,” Harry said. He began rolling his shoulders to get the knots out of his back as his hands were bound behind his back, causing his shoulders to stiffen up.
"Hmm, this one." Harry mumbled, tapping his finger on the notebook. Draco looked down and briefly read the description. 'Sandy blonde hair, about five foot three, petite, wears ridiculously annoying high heels. Heard her talking to someone who addressed her as Mandy.'
Draco scowled at him. “I didn’t
I know that but today mother turned up at Grimmauld with a crib! Apparently it was mine when I was a baby, she said “Any Malfoy deserves to sleep in this, it’s a family heirloom you know!” As if I didn’t already know that, considering I’m sure even
Draco moved away from Harry and towards Seamus, spotting a figure in the corner of his eye Draco pointed his wand to the third hooded figure, who began screaming “LEAVE, NOW.” in a thick Irish accent. The hooded figure duelling Seamus immediately disapparated, furious, Seamus swung round to the man Harry was currently duelling, who with a sadistic smirk also disapparated. Draco, caught unawares was hit by a stupefy propelling him through the air and down onto the forest floor with a thud. Harry’s eyes widened, the third figure quickly disapparated. Seamus immediately began setting up traces and Harry ran to Draco’s side. Groaning, Draco stood up slowly and gave a sheepish smile to Harry. “Caught me off guard.” he winced, he quickly cast episkey on his finger which was bent the wrong way and he groaned as the hot feeling enveloped his finger, before snapping back into place.
You’re actually pregnant, Draco. Quite honestly, I’m still
Potter let out a rather loud, enthusiastic laugh, his smile almost reaching his hairline. “I already have a beard Malfoy, you didn’t notice?” It was weird, Draco hadn’t really had a civil conversation with Potter, actually to tell the truth he wasn’t sure he’d ever actually had a
“Mm, yes?” he asked quietly, looking into those blazing green eyes. He felt his heart rate speed up, he inwardly cursed his rogue body.
Draco nodded his head, frowning at the pizza box in front of him. “So?” Draco asked, opening the box up. He took a slice of pizza and brought it up to his mouth, sniffing a little before he took a bite.
In Harry’s breast pocket was an owl from Narcissa, he’d received it about two minutes ago but not yet read it, he needed to be bang on the right time for apparition, he didn’t intend to lose another team member today.
the matter with the man, but Harry didn’t like worrying other people, which made them worry more.
-----
with his life, which wasn’t completely unlike Draco, however when Weasley spoke of Potter, he brought up Potter’s conquests which he couldn’t help but turn up his nose at.
he wasn’t even sure if there was actually a person out there for him.
snogging Ronald Weasley. Draco often wondered if he hated the ginger git because he wanted Potter as his own friend, or because he was a Weasley, or an idiot. The thought plagued him for a few drunken moments before he turned his head back to an amused looking Potter.
Louisa immediately followed suit, brushing down her skin tight jeans from invisible dust. Pushing her own sunglasses up her nose, she moved quickly around the car and stood beside Draco, folding her arms.
I’m going to sent this reply back with Hercules now, exactly as it is.
“You going to dance with me, Draco?” Harry winked again.
As soon as Harry found himself able to stand, he was apparating to St. Mungo’s. The sickly feeling returned as his eyes adjusted to the bright white light of the hospital. Making his way down the corridors with impressive speed, he flew around the corner narrowly missing a Healer, he quickly apologised before slamming through the doors to the ward Draco was currently residing on. Unsure if it was the anxious panic attack he’d had earlier, coupled with the fact he’d hardly eaten anything and a hint of worry for Draco, but he tried to put that all out of his mind.
“Heya Glen, thanks mate.” he reached over to the small telephone table stood beside the door and fished through it for the bank notes he left in there, purposely for the Chinese. Taking the bag, he held out the money to Glen, tipping him an extra £10. Glen winked at him and waved a hand towards Draco, who was watching with interest.
“Ronald will receive his full pension, as well as a monthly retirement package, the first Auror to receive this package since it was introduced two years ago.” Harry turned his body towards Ron, who was standing next to him was definitely looking better, still stood with his cane but otherwise he was himself again. The look of sadness etched onto his face saddened Harry greatly. Nevertheless, he picked up a purple ribboned medal and placed it around his shoulders.
good enough. Definitely not, of course he had to start making his own marbles.
It worked like a charm, every time. Hermione coughed and narrowed her eyes. “Harry isn’t like that, is he Ron?”
“Cold?” Harry asked, placing the boxes down on the coffee table, he opened the lids and pulled the sauces out of the cut out holes. “Yeah, it’s freezing in here,” Draco moaned, shaking his head. “We need to keep the bloody heating on.” he said, picking up a slice of pizza.
“Spag bol sounds nice though.” he added, turning his attention back to the television. Draco tsked and began to pack the food away in to the fridge and cupboard above the microwave, which Harry aptly named Draco’s shit cupboard. It was honestly just full of absolute junk.
Draco
Sorry. I’ve just read that last bit back to myself. I sound a bit sentimental, don’t I? I’m not going to
Harry
“Merlin she’s a delight isn’t she?” he mumbled, shaking his head. Hermione just chuckled. “She’s lovely actually.”
“Well, I thought about it but Ron got offered a place with the Magpies, they already had a seeker but a few months after I joined the Cannons their seeker retired, so here I am.” he said, shrugging his shoulders. Draco chewed his lower lip in thought, before nodding. “Okay.”
“Who’s requesting holiday this time then?” Harry asked casually, walking back over to the corkboard. He frowned and stared at the crop circle, he knew there was something that he was missing but he just couldn’t place his finger on it.
They’d talked about it in detail once before, what would happen if one of them died in the line of duty almost like a married couple would do. The thought caused Draco’s stomach to flip violently. He could remember the pained expression on Harry’s face as Draco explained things he wanted done on the event of his death, he was sure the man was about to throw up.
The obnoxious sound of Draco’s alarm clock beeping woke Harry up from his peaceful sleep. Admittedly the most peaceful sleep he’d had since well, probably the last time he’d slept with Draco beside him. He opened his eyes and squinted at the clock, it was 6:45. That was why Draco was always ready before him he thought. Nobody needed to be up at 6:45. They didn’t start work until 8:30.
Bang on five minutes, Harry apparated to the coordinates just East of the first warehouse, he could feel his heart begin to beat rapidly in his chest. Quickly taking in his surroundings, the place was deathly silent, not even a bird in the sky. He took note of this quickly, walking slowly towards the warehouse.
I miss you, I think Orion does too. The damned Crup has been whining since you left, I’m too soft I think - I keep feeding him whenever he looks a bit depressed. I might have to put him on a diet actually, yesterday he tried to get up off the floor and I could swear I heard a Harry style grunt. An actual grunt, from a Crup, can you believe it?
I ache for you, Draco and I’m counting down the days until we’re reunited.
In actual fact, Draco had found out the name of the man in question two days prior. Not only that but he’d found out what illegal potions the man had been supplying and what the woman, Mandy’s, role in the operation was. It wasn’t lying, he was merely.. omitting the truth.
My darling Draco,
Harry shrugged his shoulders, then pulled his trousers down when the last button was undone. “Someone who doesn’t want to be muted, here you go, come bite my dick off then, I dare you.” he winked. Draco looked at him for a few moments, jaw gone slack and made a beeline for Harry, who started to move too. “No! No!” he exclaimed between laughter, he began running around the sofa, past the coffee table and towards the front door in just his boxers, Draco hot on his tail.
“Mm, I’m going to bed I think.” Draco sighed, rubbing at his temples. “We have that stupid Illegal Potions shit tomorrow.” standing up, he turned to Harry who had finished his tea and placed the cup down on the coffee table. “Mm, true.”
Potter seemed genuinely interested in his recovery, which surprised Draco somewhat, he’d never thought himself and Potter would have a civil conversation but it went smoothly.
He’d brought the novel with him, it sat beside his plate for the world to see, or rather anyone who walked past him though nobody paid much attention to him anyway.
“Potter,” Kingsley said, eyeing him closely. “Are you alright?” Harry nodded slowly, he attempted to get up but found his legs were like jelly, he let out an exasperated sigh and rubbed his face with his palm.
“Yeah, so? That’s 10 galleons that is one hundred percent mine.” he grinned. Nobody could take this moment away from him. Dean turned his attention to Lockwood, who Endelton had bound with an Incarcerous. “Good work Josh.” he said, nodding his head. Endelton wasn’t his cup of tea, the man was just far too irritating for Dean’s taste and that was saying something.
“So it’s like football-tennis?” she mused, once she figured the rules of Quidditch, Draco could tell she was enjoying it a whole load more, but he couldn’t help but notice her eyes following Weasley’s brutish form throughout the entire match.
Placing the cake down on the side, he carefully cut two slices and plated them up on small side plates, sticking a fork in the top of each one. He walked back over to the table and placed it in front of Harry, who eyed the cake. “Mm, I love this one.” Harry commented, leaning forward in his chair. He grabbed the fork and started stabbing the cake, shovelling it into his mouth with impressive speed. Draco shook his head.
“I-I” Harry started, he had a million and one things to tell the other man, his thoughts were whirling around his head like a hurricane, his heart hammering in his chest. He wanted to tell Draco he loved him, he wanted to tell him everything he loved about him, how he wasn’t sure how he’d live life without him, but the words were caught in his throat.
Harry chuckled and shut the door behind him. “I went to the Department of Mysteries, showed them our paperwork, got a scowl off Wilson and came back here.” he countered, slamming down on to his office chair.
before that? I told you not to worry! St. Mungo’s would have been utter fools not to have gone with Malfoy & Nott for their suppliers. Not only is your product the best quality on the market, but you’ve worked hard to keep your prices reasonable, especially since Lycanthropes still suffer so much prejudice and struggle to get jobs. I’m more than proud of you, Draco. Just be careful, though. There is so much Aconite in Wolfsbane (
Finding out that I was a wizard, aged only eleven? Discovering that I was able to cast spells and that there was a whole world outside of everything I’d ever known? All of that pales in comparison with your news. Your beautifully formed letters have created the most wonderful, welcome sentences that I think I’ll ever read in my entire life. Every fibre of my being is desperate to return to your side. I want to look after you, Draco and tend to your every need.
I’ll be sure to pass on the message regarding that awful excuse for a newspaper. I heard from Daphne (I think she’s feeling bad, she came in with a care package earlier, I thought that was quite kind of her) they’ve agreed to go on a date, so I’ll be your eagle eyes and gossip queen for this particular situation, I assure you. Although it seems rather sudden, I need to do some further digging and find out what spurred this on so quickly. After all, we've been waiting for far too long already.
As for the Wolfsbane Potion? What was the last thing I said to you before I left? Yes, I know it was ‘love you’, but
“You’re mental.” Draco said, shaking his head. Louisa made a noncommittal sound, shuffling around in her seat. Granger had given him really good seats, obviously not in the box where he usually would’ve been, but they were excellent nonetheless. “Oh it’s starting!” Exclaimed Louisa, a bright smile on her face. Draco narrowed his eyes, he really loved this daft woman. Often, he wondered what his life would’ve been like had Louisa been his sister, they shared a connection unparalleled. Actually, he’d quite like Bethany as his sister too. It was funny to crave something you never had.
headlines already, Draco.
My belly is full of Nargles. A thousand thoughts are cascading madly through my brain.
Harry nodded, gathered his bearings and looked towards his partner again, a silent agreement between the two of them. They walked through the large arched front door into the passageway. The smell hit him as soon as he entered, he gasped. “Fuck.” he cursed, moving slowly through the passageway. The floor was covered in blood, smears as though a body had been dragged along the carpet. As the two of them walked into a small living room, Harry’s jaw dropped. He felt the bubbling in his stomach intensify as his eyes locked to the horror in front of him.
The fourth time it happened, Draco had been staring at a sausage on his plate for a good twenty minutes, often he’d zone out and start thinking about something that carried his attention off somewhere else. On this particular occasion, Draco had gotten a little stuck thinking about a book he’d been reading, he’d taken a particular liking to muggle romance novels, a man in his latest edition called Thomas had fallen in love with a local drug dealer (to which Draco had to search the definition of) the story itself was fascinating and he found himself spending all of his waking moments reading or thinking about it.
It always brought him back to his younger self, how prejudiced he was against muggles, had his younger self met Louisa he’d never have looked at her twice, the thought of his life without this ridiculous woman gave him indigestion.
They entered the restaurant together, he glanced around the room quickly - eyes resting on the dark hair of Potter, he was early. “Malfoy, over here!” Potter bellowed, gesturing his hand wildly. Draco let out a huff and held his arm out for Louisa, who took it with a smile.
“Uh, Robards weirdly enough.” Draco laughed and signed the document accepting his holiday leave. Robards was only a part timer now, after his position had been filled by Harry. The Auror seemed grateful Harry hadn’t asked him to become his deputy, they never did decline any of his requests for leave - during the course of their training Robards assisted with many cases, and saved their hides just as many times. Harry believed it was duty other than actual care - the man was grumpy and drove Harry round the bend most of the time.
“Didn’t he just request holiday last month?” asked Harry, frowning. His concentration was fixed to the crop circle, he barely heard Draco’s reply of “Yes, a week.” Harry then spun around fast his gaze snapping to Draco’s face. “Murder is murder, illegal potions are illegal.” he said slowly. Draco raised an eyebrow and smirked “Generally yes, fantastic thinking there, Potter.” he chuckled.
Admittedly, I have to agree. I didn’t realise it would happen this fast either. I spoke with the regular Healer, Trish. You know the one I’m talking about, curly brown hair - reminds me of an unkempt Hermione in second year? Well Trish told me apparently when you’re
As they began to walk, Draco felt the jittery feeling once again, it was really becoming quite the issue.
Draco bit his lip, acutely aware of how close he was to telling Harry the truth. His heart began to beat rapidly in his chest, his palms clammy under the fleece blanket. He placed his hand on Harry’s chest. ‘Just a little closer’ he thought.
It wasn’t that Draco didn’t
“I could always get it out,” he winked. Draco swatted his arm and rolled his eyes. “Don’t be such a slag Potter.” though his voice held no malice.
the words though. I think, while you’re taking those potions, and doing something that is really brave for our family, you probably need to hear them.
What Harry didn’t expect, is Blaise Zabini to saunter in the room like he owned the place. Harry quirked an eyebrow up. “What are you doing here?” asked Harry curiously. Blaise merely smirked. “Well, Potter..” he started, eyeing Hermione with caution.
After scrolling through various different channels, Draco rested on another documentary, this one about Polar Bears. As it happened it was very interesting. Draco’s eyes widened as he learnt the Polar Bears natural habitat was melting. Harry could see the tears forming in the blond’s eyes when they explained a lot of the bears were dying as they didn’t find enough to eat before they went into their long hibernation. It never failed to amuse Harry, other people expected Draco to be this cold and callous Slytherin, with no compassion and no love.
“That’s hilarious, you, Draco Malfoy didn’t like another person because they were a pompous prick.” Harry chuckled, shaking his head in disbelief.
When their reports were filed and everyone had cleared off, Harry held out his hand for Draco, who blushed lightly. “Chinese, tea, bed.” he smiled. Draco took his hand and smiled in return, before Harry side-alonged the two of them into the middle of their living room.
Clearing his throat, Draco turned his attention to Potter and sighed. “I work in a Dentist’s office.” he watched Potter for a few moments, trying to gauge his reaction. The man was shocked, surely. “A Dentist?” Potter asked, raising an eyebrow.
“That’s good.” He finally added, he wasn’t sure how long it had taken him to reply, since he woke up he found his mind whirling with different things. It was funny how easily something pieced together when you took a step back and thought about it for a while.
“You’re getting old.” Draco smirked, standing up. He brushed down his Auror’s robes and wandered over to the corkboard, he then began pinning a copy of the report he’d made on the cabin, as well as a picture of the sticky note and turned his head towards Harry. “Seamus came back whilst you were away, spell damage reported nothing out of the ordinary, though they did trace the sticky note to Lockwoods desk.” he sighed.
“I think we should give up and get trashed instead.” Harry concluded, nodding his head as though his mind was made up. Draco snorted, shaking his head. It worried him a little, he seemed to spend his life drifting from one moment to the next with little interest or motivation to find something better. The last week he’d spent with Harry actually felt
I know the work you do is important Harry, I know that I’m being too
In front of him was the newest edition of the Daily Prophet, with yet another headline depicting the Saviour of the Wizarding World’s antics. “Every fucking day, all the bloody time - can’t they just leave me alone for five minutes?”
“So, yeah I guess so,” Potter nodded. “I don’t think he’d care that Louisa is a muggle, nor your best friend.” he added, as though it was a silent question. Draco smiled.
I’m glad I can get such a reaction out of a simple letter, perhaps I should write to you more often. I wish you were home, it’s quite lonely here without you. Orion is still whining like an old bint. I fed him a sausage, I’ve never seen anyone eat it as fast and as messily as he did and I’ve eaten at a dinner table with Ronald Weasley.
“Aha!” Draco exclaimed, pulling out a heavy file. He dumped it on his desk and began leaving through the contents. Harry turned his head on its side and frowned. “What?” he asked again, this time he walked up behind Draco and peered over his shoulder. It was a little difficult as the other man was a little taller than him, but not so hard since he was hunching over a little.
interested in anyone before.
This case is getting more and more complicated! Hooray for undercover ops. <3
“Do you want to share this one?” Louisa asked Ron, who looked down at the menu. The item in question happened to be thirteen different flavours of icecream in a boat, topped with smarties, flakes, chocolate sauce, wafers, M&Ms and Merlin knows what else. Weasley’s eyes lit up like Christmas, nodding enthusiastically.
” he moaned. Of course Louisa would have to choose Ronald Weasley as the hottest man on the team, if the world wasn’t torturing him enough. “Oh you know him then? You can introduce me.” She said, a wicked smile appearing on her ruby red lips.
subject.
Kingsley sighed. “We need to talk to her anyway Harry, you know this.” Harry nodded, he felt guilty. He’d not even told Narcissa that Draco was in hospital yet. He’d told nobody, he didn’t want to, he just wanted to be with him. “I haven’t told her he’s in hospital yet, neither Andromeda.”
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s forehead, then moved towards the seat beside his bed, plonking down into the cushion. Draco began to explain what the Healer’s had told him upon waking up, there wasn’t much of it he really understood. Something to do with curses that tie to your dark mark, some malarkey. To be honest, Harry didn’t care either. The only thing he could think about was taking Draco home, locking him in the flat and then never leaving the safety of their comfortable place again.
Pictures adorned the entirety of Harry and Draco’s feature wall, really. Most of them taken during eighth year as well as Dean and Seamus’ annual eighth year reunion, which was really just an excuse for an all out piss up. The two of them had gotten together during eighth year which was really no surprise to anyone and they seemed pretty happy. Auror partners and life partners. Draco turned his head towards Harry and wondered if one day that would be the two of them, silently cursing himself over his unending crush and unrequited love.
It simply said, ‘Malfoy and Endelton are to die tonight, traitors.’ the twists and turns reminded him of Tom Riddle’s diary, Harry couldn’t help the sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. He wondered if Endelton had received a similar piece. The thought that Draco’s own mother would’ve done something like this was absurd. He thought back to that night in the forest, his skin prickling. Although it was complicated, he was sure Narcissa was a competent witch. The thought of it being her made him feel uneasy however.
Draco must’ve zoned out somewhere, because he was suddenly being nudged by Potter. “Malfoy?” Potter asked. Snapping out of it, Draco blushed scarlet when he noticed all of the tables occupants now had eyes on him.
Harry let out a sigh and shook his head, tracing the rim of his cup with his fingertip. “No, but - well I don’t know what else to do,” he admitted, scrunching his face up. “I didn’t join up with the Aurors, I haven’t a clue how to actually investigate.”
“Is,” Draco began, looking up at the green eyed man beside him. Biting his lip, Draco felt a blush creep onto his face, he felt irritation rising, unable to place just
Draco sat down on the sofa, crossing his feet and watched Potter with interest. It was almost as though the man was absorbing everything that was
------------------------------
“Just,” Draco looked down at the hand placed on his lap, he covered her hand with his own and smiled softly. “Nevermind, it’s just difficult after all this time.” he gave her hand a gentle squeeze before moving both of his hands to the steering wheel, he turned the key in the ignition and reversed out the space.
Ron raised an eyebrow, pursed his lips and nodded his head slowly. “Actually-” he started, but was cut off by Draco who let out an exasperated huff and held his hand up in protest. “No, not you as well, I won’t have it,” he demanded, shaking his head. “I’d rather not have another boyfriend that cheated on me with
“Oh Draco, you’re such an idiot,” Hermione scolded gently, a small smile playing on her lips.
But let me change to happier subjects. I have every belief that the raid will go exactly as planned.
“Fuck sake, what the hell?” he muttered to himself, shaking his head. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, Draco looked in his rear-view mirror and pulled off, unable to shake the uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. It was a mix between anxiety and irritability. What should’ve been a quick and relatively painless journey seemed to turn his head upside down instead.

“Didn’t you say you come here everyday?” Harry said, shaking his head in disbelief. Draco scowled in response. “The guy is right there, Potter,” he sighed, gesturing with his head towards the man who accurately resembled Harry’s original description. “Oh, cool,” replied Potter, who smiled.
“I bet you did, do you want some food, good puss cat?” Draco cooed, he leaned forwards and rubbed his face on the cat, causing Potter to let out a chuckle. “I didn’t realise you liked cats so much, Malfoy.” He said, moving towards the two of them.
Harry stopped outside the last door at the end of the corridor, taking in a breath he reached out and turned the door handle, stepping inside the room. His eyes immediately rested on Draco’s frail, unmoving form. Harry felt sick, just yesterday they’d been having an albeit weird, but lovely day together.
Harry pressed his forehead against Draco’s and let out a shaky breath. “Draco,” he whispered softly, he hesitated for a few moments, thoughts wild. “Draco…” he repeated, unsure. “Yes?” replied Draco, in the same hushed tone.
“If you keep winking at me like that Mrs. Dunn is going to definitely think we’re shagging.” Draco teased, looking at Harry with a playful look on his face. Harry nudged him with his right elbow as he knocked on the door with his left hand.
When Draco came to, the first thing he noticed was the absolute stench he could smell. It smelt of sulfur, rotten eggs, perhaps a gas leak, something of that sort. Opening his eyes, he let out a groan - there was a dull ache in his head, as though he’d been hit over the head by a spade several hours prior.
Potter looked at him with a raised eyebrow, scanning Draco’s features. He then shrugged his shoulders. “Ron was devastated when he broke up with Hermione, they don’t really speak much now either,” he sighed. “He dated Pavarti for a little while after, but she left him for Dean so that was even more awkward.”
When they finally arrived home, Harry had begun to strip his robes off in the living room, he tossed them carelessly onto the floor beside the coffee table, pulled his t-shirt over his head and started unbuckling his belt when he heard the protest from Draco, who’d entered a little slower behind him.
I think Pansy has finally mustered enough courage up to ask Ginny on a date too, I went out with her last night for drinks (don’t worry, I had orange juice) I think she may have been drinking enough wine for two to compensate on my lack of drunkenness, well finally I got her to admit she does like Ginny, so she’s going to ask her to the Ministry gala in two months. I suppose two months is better than the eight we’ve spent trying to get the two of them together, right?
Seamus could feel his heart hammering in his chest, adrenaline kicking in. He had no idea how they were going to get out of this one. From the distance he could already see at least six of the Celtic Serpents gaining. He shook his head in dismay.
Have you told Cissa about the baby yet? I’m thrilled to see what her reaction will be. She’ll be ecstatic. Her broomstick will fly over the bloody moon. Of course, you’ll never be rid of her once you tell we’re expecting. I suspect she’ll make noises about moving into the spare room...
Harry rolled his eyes. “At least it wasn’t me in St. Mungo’s this time, and you’ll get your book back you know.”
After eighth year, Hermione and Ron had moved in together - Ron had immediately proposed to Hermione. Harry moved into a flat above a Domino’s Pizza in Muggle London, just outside Diagon Alley with Draco.
The motion gave Draco all sorts of unwanted mental images, well he was sure they were unwanted. “The other person who works on the desk with me?” Draco suggested, smirking at Potter. Harry just laughed. “Touche.”
Draco had planned to meet Potter at the Hungry Horse which was about a mile away from the arena, an hour after the match ended. Draco secretly hoped Weasley would accompany him so he could show Louisa that he really wasn’t anything special - but another part of him wanted this to be over quickly so Draco could retreat back to London to the comfort of his flat, where his cat Meowth would be waiting for him.
“Ugh, I’m sorry. I wish we had more on this fucking case.” he cursed, shaking his head in dismay. He really thought they were getting somewhere with it, yesterday they’d gone back out to the crop circle area. They’d received Dean and Seamus’ report a couple of days ago in regards to the cabin. No spell traces were found and the cabin itself was clean, though they’d found traces that their wards had been tampered with.
“Sure,” he finally said, wandering over to the television. Pressing the large button, Draco chewed his lower lip as he flicked through the different channels, resting on a movie he found familiar. “Oh, it’s Alice in Wonderland!” he exclaimed. Draco was always happy when he got something muggle right, Louisa called it an ‘endearing trait’ which he’d always assumed was code for you’re a bit of a plonker, aren’t you?
“Well, we have one more connection I suppose.” Harry sighed, standing up and wandering over to his wooden cork board, he’d brought it in when they moved in to the office, he found it helped. “I still don’t get how they’re connected though.” he stared at the crop circle, it took up the majority of the field and was an absolute pain in the arse to fix. The farmer hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary and it had occurred overnight, they’d checked all the outbuildings of the farm for clues and ran extensive traces, but it was as if nobody had ever been there. The same for the older lady who had been murdered in her home in Diagon Alley. It caused widespread panic and the Prophet had reported for weeks that the next Dark Lord was imminent, the population of the Wizarding World were never going to get over that threat, which stressed Harry to no ends.
Second: I know that three days without word was too long. You’ll have been anxious, though you must know that I always take every precaution. I care too much about our lives together not to come back home to you in one piece. Much of those three days were spent undercover with Mils, using polyjuice to convince the gang of our secret identities. Don’t worry though! Ron has a remote viewing spell on us the entire time and if we were compromised, we could be out of the there in seconds. I have a tricky little Portkey disguised as a ring. I keep it in my pocket, near to my heart.
It was painted quite nicely, a simple white - all the kitchen counters were black marble top but the cupboards themselves were white. There was illuminated lighting underneath the cabinets, with a microwave, toaster and a large range cooker in the middle, surrounded by a kitchen island.
“Ready?” He asked, giving Draco the goofiest grin, he could feel his heart melt a little for this strange man.
“Mm,” Draco said, chewing the inside of his mouth.
Draco ran his hand through his hair and looked around the area, there was nothing out of the ordinary, the wheat field was high enough so the farmers wouldn’t notice them in the middle, the nearest building an old dilapidated barn, beside that a horse stable and to the far left the farmhouse itself. Biting down on his lower lip, Harry went through a mental checklist of where they’d looked at the last time they were here.
“Night Harry.” Draco smiled, before he walked to his bedroom and closed the door softly behind him.
Lockwood growled, turning towards the man. “It’s done when I say so.” he spat, glaring daggers. Harry frowned, he had no idea how he could’ve ever missed this. Lockwood was clearly deranged but in the office he seemed so mellow, normal, he had been a decent enough Auror - though Draco often moaned about his ‘shit paperwork skills’ he’d never had a problem with the man before. Harry was sure after all of the dark wizards he’d encountered during the war he’d be able to spot another one, he felt a pang of guilt.

“Mm, I think you’ve earned yourself detention, Potter.” Draco stated, shaking his head. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and you have to order takeaway for the next fifty years too.”
“I bet you 10 galleons 8 months ago that I’d hit someone in the dick with a Stupefy. You owe me 10 galleons now Deano.” he put his hands on his hips, looking proudly at his boyfriend. “You idiot, your money is my money.” Dean rolled his eyes again.
“Ron and Harry came to the Premier Inn for a room too, apparently their usual place was full,” Louisa said, her eyes sparkling with mischief. Draco knew that look all too well. “I saw Ron in the lobby after you’d gone up to your room and well…” she trailed off, looking up at Weasley for confirmation. The brute nodded in agreement.
“I’ll have that one.” she smiled, pointing at the mess of red hair, freckles and pearly white teeth smiling back at him. Draco cringed, turning his head towards his best friend - the look of disdain evident on his face. “Are you serious,
Knew that we could be real.
---------------------------
As Draco arrived outside Thistle Do Nicely, he frowned at the sullen look on Harry’s face. He sat down quietly beside the other man and chewed on his lower lip. “Are you alright?” he asked, immediately regretting the decision. Potter looked surprised Draco did indeed ask, but he studied Draco for a moment before shaking his head. “Not really,” mumbled Harry.
The blond looked towards him, a frown on his face, replaced by a soft smile. “Hey,” He said, taking in Harry’s dishevelled appearance. “Are you alright?” He asked, a little concerned. Harry let out a choked laugh, he rounded the bed and immediately wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him closely into a tight hug.
I love you with every part of my being,
wouldn’t mind. You know what I’m like, Draco. I’d love a whole Quidditch team of children running underfoot but I expect that you’d have a few things to say on
“Tommy Jenkins.” Draco frowned, staring at the memo. “Guess we better break it to poor Mrs. Dunn that it wasn’t that bloody Jim.” he teased, grinning at Harry. The look on Draco’s face made Harry’s stomach jump, he returned the grin, nodding his head. “Yeah.”
“You’re pissed, I’m pissed, they’re going to shag again… I vote for pizza, hotel, movie.” Potter nodded his head, looking thoroughly pleased with himself. Draco let out an over dramatic sigh and smiled weakly. “Fine, you win, again.” the blond whined, though secretly a little pleased.
Harry had been accepted into Auror training along with Draco, Ron, Lavender, Dean and Seamus. Neville had been accepted as an apprentice to Professor Sprout, Ginny had gone off to join the Holyhead Harpies, Luna was editor of the Quibbler, Hermione had joined the Department of Mysteries, which to this day none of them really knew what she did, only that she was an Unspeakable. Harry was a little disappointed that Draco wasn’t his Auror partner, but overjoyed when he’d found out he’d been assigned with Ron. Draco’s Auror partner was Tracey Davis, which he’d worked very well with. When Harry was made Head Auror, he’d asked Ron to be his Deputy, but Ron had declined the offer ‘too much paperwork mate.’ he’d said, Harry often wished he’d accepted. Instead, he’d asked Draco who agreed almost immediately. Tracey had been reassigned to Ron. Harry knew Draco had been close to Tracey, but he didn’t want to press the situation when Draco had discovered his ex-partner had been killed in the line of duty. Eventually, Draco had opened up and told him he was pretty devastated, they’d toasted her life with a bottle of Ogden’s which resulted in a hefty hangover in the morning.
” Harry winked.
“Are you in love?” Draco asked, he knew it sounded utterly ridiculous coming out of his mouth, but in his defence he was in uncharted territory and way out of his comfort zone. He idly wondered what his cat was up to.
was when I knew I loved you, it was so utterly silly, so utterly you and I felt my heart leap in my chest.
Brought out of his thoughts by the return of Draco, he looked up at the other man with a smile. Draco’s perfect hair was now mussed, which Harry had come to learn was a habit the blonde had of running his hand through it when he was stressed. It was weird to see a dishevelled Draco, he’d seen it thousands of times before but it never got old. “Problems?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at the scowl on Draco’s face.
“You know he’s single, yes?” Hermione pushed, batting her eyelashes at Draco, who scowled in response. “Once again, I’ll pass, thank you.” Draco said, picking his cup of hot chocolate up. Hermione let out an exasperated sigh and leant back in her chair, staring at Draco thoughtfully.

hair. They’d be better off ginger.’ Ron can be a cheeky swine sometimes. Personally, I just don’t care. I’d love it if our little one had your gorgeous hair, but if they inherit my untameable locks then so be it. We’ll love them in all their knotty glory.
Harry then began to explain to Kingsley and Dean about the crop circle, what led up to them investigating, the boundary, forest and cabin they’d encountered whilst they were out on the field. Kingsley asked very few questions and Dean stayed silent throughout, only nodding when he heard keywords. After Harry had stopped talking, Dean turned to him and cleared his throat. “Is, er, is Seamus alright mate?” he asked, a blush raising up his neck. Harry let out a laugh and nodded. “Of course, he’s a good Auror.”
Harry growled. “Now.” his hand then slammed down on the lockdown button. Kingsley nodded.
Tapping her fingernails against the desk, Unspeakable Wilson gathered the paperwork up and waved her wand, they instantly disappeared. Harry didn’t bother asking. “Like I say, I know you can’t talk about anything you do, but in the interest of cooperation and catching these guys I thought it was important to share it with you.”
He heard a thunk from behind him, he turned around his eyes resting on Draco who had slid down the door and brought his knees up to his chest, burying his head. Without thinking, Harry ran over and knelt beside Draco, placing a gentle hand on his back. “Are you alright?” he asked cautiously, he knew Draco didn’t like to feel vulnerable, but he hated even more when his vulnerability was shown around others.
The case was getting more and more complicated by the second. There was a lot more to it than he’d originally anticipated and if they did have a mole in the department he needed to tell Kinglsey as soon as possible. Sighing, he left the office and made his way towards Kingsley’s. This was not going to be an easy meeting.
“What do you mean we can’t interview them?!” exclaimed Lavender, she stood in the doorway of Kingsley’s office, frazzled and tired but she refused to budge - to go home. Lavender had never seen such a destroyed Harry Potter in her life. Not at Hogwarts, not during training, never. This was important and she would see it through to the end.
Draco snorted. “I very much doubt that, Potter, you’re the most famous wizard in England.” He shook his head. It was true, Draco was pretty sure Potter was more famous than bloody Merlin himself now, but he wouldn’t admit that to Potter.
“It’s what, Potter?” Draco sighed, picking up his cup and saucer, he made no effort to wait for Potter once again, before exiting the Cafe to sit at his usual spot outside for another daily dose of people watching. Potter quickly sat down beside him however, a deep frown marring his forehead.
“Harry!” Hermione called, running towards him full pelt. “What’re you doing here?” she asked curiously, a frown on her face. Harry had walked in to the Department of Mysteries ten minutes ago and spent that entire ten minutes arguing with the witch on the desk. Every time he came here, same with International Cooperation he had issues with the staff. He wondered if Kingsley purposely hired people for these desks just to piss him off.
“Shall we?” he asked, gesturing towards the path ahead. Potter nodded.
Harry let out a choked laugh, unable to hold back the tears that stung his eyes. They fell down his cheeks, pooling on Draco’s neck. “Thanks.” Harry said, he stood holding Draco close for close to ten minutes before the blond pulled back, looking at him with an even more concerned expression than earlier.
Harry nodded, he couldn’t disagree the work Unspeakables did was not only dangerous, but of course a secret. He’d been friends with Hermione most of his life and she was yet to tell him what she actually did within the department. Not even Ron knew.
Draco cleared his throat and scratched the side of his face awkwardly. “Oh, well, I-I’ve been helping my mother a lot,” he said, hoping that put an end to it, unfortunately Luna gestured for him to continue.
You’ll have got my other letter by now. You’ll be glad to know that I’m back to a state of (relative!) calm. I can actually form whole words with my mouth which is a definite improvement on earlier today. I’m still utterly overawed, and overjoyed by your pregnancy but I’m valiantly fighting the powerful urge to Apparate home to be by your side.
Harry closed the door behind Draco and immediately passed him the parchment. It was a standard report, however it was filled out by Auror Lockwood. Yesterday. “Hm.” Draco hummed, he made his way over to his desk and sat down placing the parchment in front of him. Fishing through the files in the filing cabinet to his left, Draco finally found the piece of parchment he was looking for and set it down beside the new one.
Looking at Malfoy’s hand, Harry looked from the marbles, to Draco, then back to the marbles, then to Draco, the most puzzled look upon his face, before he burst into a fit of laughter. “Wh-” he choked out, shaking his head and holding on to his stomach. “What..” he wheezed, a tear forming in the corner of his eye.
I’m finally,
“Yes.” agreed Draco. He stood up, straightening out his robes. “Why are we wearing suits, we’re only going to Gringotts.” Harry sighed, running a hand through his messy damp hair. Draco shrugged his shoulders. “I always do, we could always go somewhere after to put them to good use.” he winked.
The lady that owned the Cafe looked as though she could be closely related to Ollivander, haggard looking and probably past her sell by date. When he’d first came to the Cafe, he’d winced upon seeing her, his mind flashing back to when Ollivander was indeed in the Manor's dungeon. Of course Draco had often taken a biscuit or two down to the prisoners, he remembered the beating of his life he’d received when Fenrir Greyback caught him trying to sneak down there for the fourth time in one day.
***********
“They’re trying to recreate the Deathly Hallows, but in mass. So they can equip all of their followers to be the ultimate masters of death.” Wilson continued, ignoring Harry’s question. Zabini let out a sigh. “You’d think it would be impossible, but they’ve created an exceptionally powerful weapon already, we seized an early copy of it from a wizard that under imperius entered the Ministry of Magic in an attempt to kill the Minister.”
When they’d arrived outside Mrs. Dunn’s cottage, Harry looked down at his watch and tapped it lightly with his finger. “Home after this.” he grinned, giving Draco a wink. Draco ducked his head down, a blush tinging his cheeks.
"Do you think I could get a new broom?" a hopeful young blonde girl asked shyly up to her mother, who narrowed her gaze. Draco snorted, he remembered asking his own father for a new broom - he wasn't met with that much disdain, more of a 'If I buy you it, will you fuck off?' kind of look. "Maybe if you're good," came the reply; Draco rolled his eyes. He brought the cup up to his mouth and sipped lightly, his lip curling at the taste. Not only was their shop horrendous, the tea wasn't much better. This didn't put Draco off though.
Louisa clapped her hands enthusiastically, like a child.
I'll leave you here, dad.
Draco smirked at her, turning the wheel as they drove round the roundabout, signalling off at his junction. “Buckle your tits Louisa, you’re about to see some hot sweaty men with wood between their legs.” He winked.
know that. It's gilded too, it looks more expensive than our entire home. Mother has made me put it in the room across from ours, she even looked disgusted when she'd realised we haven't decorated that room yet. How dare she!
“I apologise, Mr. Potter.” the man stammered, passing the chart in his hands towards Hermione, who took it willingly. She began to scan the chart, eyes widening. Harry rubbed the back of his neck, waiting for her response. “Mr. Malfoy is stable, but he’s not out of the woods yet.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, eyeing him with suspicion. Draco nodded, chewing on his bottom lip. They’d been friends long enough that Harry knew him by heart. All of his tells, he couldn’t lie to the other man. Though one of the best things about Harry was he’d never press. They walked into the Auror department side by side. Harry’s eyes wandered to Lavender who was looking at a piece of parchment, a report by the looks of it. Harry frowned. Lavender’s eyebrows were raised, eyes crinkling at the edges.
Once dinner was prepared, Harry began to set the small circular table near the window. Draco had frowned deeply and watched him for a few moments. The question was on the tip of his tongue, there was definitely something wrong with Harry. Draco had made such an effort to learn how to cook and he was very proud of himself, but Harry
Nodding in agreement, Draco quickly arranged a place to meet Potter after the match and they went off towards the arena together, leaving Potter stood beside his Bentley looking utterly confused.
“What about our flat?” Harry suggested, turning his head to Draco. Draco’s eyes widened, they’d never used their flat for work before, it was a safe place for him. Harry took the hint and shook his head. “Hm. I’ll get back to you on that one.” he mumbled.
Harry is overjoyed by Draco's news.
“Shall we go to the Horse now, or?” Louisa asked, her heels clicking against the pavement - Draco chewed his lower lip, debating on if that seemed maybe a little too eager, then shrugged his shoulder. “I suppose, couldn’t hurt to get some food before we drive back,”
Draco x
“I’m going home, we’ll try again tomorrow,” Draco said quietly, standing up from the table and nodding towards Potter, who sat frowning, and apparated away.
Even Bethany, who he didn’t know
“Whatheactualfuck” Potter said, somewhat mashed together. Draco raised an eyebrow and pulled his hand back, pocketing his prized marbles. As the train came to a halt, Draco pulled down his suitcase and left a hysterical Potter behind.
“Do we have any idea who they are?” asked Dean, who had been uncharacteristically quiet. Harry shook his head and let out a groan. Sitting back down on the armchair, he was hunched forwards, brow furrowed. After a few minutes, his eyes rose to meet Kingsley’s. “Well, I better fill you in on what we just encountered.
His mobile phone pinged, he looked down at it and smiled. The reply came “Yeah, meet me at the usual bookstore at 6?” Draco quickly replied “See you there” and threw the mobile down on the empty passenger seat.
I’ll admit, I’ve never received a parchment with such life changing news as that which came tied to the leg of your owl, Draco.
Harry looked furious, his cheeks blotchy red with anger. “Where the buggering fuck is Endelton?” he shouted as he wrenched the door to Kingsley’s office open. Kingsley stood up quickly, wand drawn. The Minister’s hand hovering over the Ministry’s panic button, which was installed just after Harry’s visit to the Department of Mysteries. It was an amusing story really, apparently a group of teenagers managing to get into the Department of Mysteries was unsettling, but the Dark Lord himself was enough cause to install it. Upon pressing it, the Ministry would be enveloped in a site wide Anti-Disapparation charm, as well as horribly loud alarms that gave Harry a bloody headache.  “Harry, you nearly gave me a heart attack.” the man stated, shaking his head. “Please don’t do that again, I haven’t seen Endelton, why do you ask?” he let out a breath, if a little shaky.
“Mmm?” Harry mumbled, sleepily. Draco smiled at the other man, his head was still on his shoulder, but he’d somehow wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist, he’d not noticed before. He bit down on his lip and braced himself for the awkward moment he was about to have, but it never came. “What time is it?” Harry asked, moving closer to Draco, if that was even possible.
The eighth time it happened, Draco was sat at the furthermost table in The Three Broomsticks, he was staring down at the table, his eyes trailing all the different shapes and patterns in the grain of wood.
Harry nodded, chewing his bottom lip in thought. Hermione let out a sigh and looked up at the Healer. “I talked to Dean while I was in the Ministry, he said Malfoy was hit by a Stupefy.” her brows furrowed, she shook her head. “This is curse damage, there’s no way that was from a Stupefy.”
coming home.
Biting his lower lip, Draco opened his eyes and let out a sigh. He'd already been here for a couple of hours. Lifting himself off the seat, he slipped the iPod back into his jacket pocket, leaving the headphones in his ears. He was used to the strange looks, or the glares, but people were much easier to cope with when he couldn't hear what they were saying. He began to walk down the cobbled street taking note of the passersby, a tall bearded man wearing an expensive set of robes. He'd seen the man a few times this week and had noted the man always went into Gringotts around 11am.
Harry frowned and shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know offhand but I could check.” He rounded the desk and opened up a green filing cabinet at the back of his side of the office, this particular filing cabinet was only for death related cases. Once he found the file he handed it to Draco, who began to read it.
“What’s wrong?” Louisa asked, placing a hand gently on his knee. It was something she did quite often, Draco still struggled to cope with emotions - something that the PTSD support group had managed to help with as well as his muggle psychiatrist, but there were times where he’d have a relapse, or he’d struggle.
The next few hours were a blur of questions; they’d been taken to the Ministry almost immediately and pushed into an interrogation room, asked endlessly what they were doing in that warehouse, what their connection to some crime group Draco didn’t quite catch the name of was, why he was bound together with Harry Potter - Draco answered to the best of his ability but in the end Harry was his saving grace, by answering that they were investigating people for fun. Eventually, Draco surrendered his book and they were allowed to leave pending more questions. Harry had taken Draco to St. Mungo’s a few minutes after they exited the Ministry and he was ushered straight into a room, probably because St. Mungo’s didn’t want to be seen treating ex-Death Eaters, Draco assumed.
“Oh yes, he’s very handsome,” she commented again, not taking her eyes off the billboard. Draco knew Louisa preferred redheads, but the thought never occurred to him she’d be attracted to Weasley. Draco wasn’t even sure Weasley was single, he knew he had broken up with Granger, who was now with Viktor Krum. It seemed Granger really had a thing for Quidditch players, it was certainly an awkward conversation when he’d asked Granger to send his apologies to Weasley, for as he so ineloquently put it ‘Bad shit I did wrong’.
talking to other people, it was that he preferred not to. Gone was the days where he wanted attention, now all he wanted to do was disappear into the shadows. He’d only returned to Hogwarts for his mother, she said he needed to continue his education, to finish what he’d missed.
in a weird way. Draco felt like his existence actually meant something, he had begun to worry what would happen after Harry got bored, or if they figured out what the man was up to.
“Potter,” Draco started, staring at the television from across the room. “What the fuck are you watching?” he asked. Harry shrugged his shoulders and held the remote up in the air. “Some shit, what do you want to watch?”
After exchanging pleasantries, they checked out of the Premier Inn and made their way down the street towards a small Cafe named ‘Luxe’. Once inside, Draco took the window seat, Potter sitting down opposite him. At least when the man was beside him he didn’t have to constantly look at him, it seemed fate really intended to conspire with him. Louisa sat down next to Draco, opposite Weasley.
Draco mumbled something that Harry didn’t quite catch and shifted. “Draco why does your alarm go off to fucking early?” he moaned, grabbing a pillow and shoving it over his head to muffle the noise. “Cause else I’d be late.” he yawned, turning over to face Harry, he opened his eyes and laughed, pulling the pillow off Harry’s head. “What are you doing idiot?” smiling, Harry lifted his head up and Draco pushed the pillow back under his head.
Potter looked up at him, still beaming. “You’re barmy.” he said, shaking his head. Draco frowned, then offered a small smile. “I’m glad someone noticed, maybe now they’ll put me in the Janus Thickey ward, I hear they have excellent bingo there.” his smile widened.
They all nodded in response. Harry let out a deep breath. “Come on Draco, let’s go.” he whispered, his voice quivering. Now it was all over, all he could feel was worry. What if Draco never woke up? That was the constant question going through his mind as he apparated to St Mungos.
Lavender had come to report straight to Harry about Lockwood. Once she’d entered the Ministry, her plan was to take him straight to Auror holding, however she’d been intercepted by Unspeakable Wilson. Instead of Auror holding, she’d taken him straight to the secure facility within the Department of Mysteries. Lavender had protested, but Kingsley had informed her that was where Lockwood would remain. The other two perps were in Auror holding, but Lavender had explained to the Unspeakables that one of them was far more advanced than the others.
Draco nodded, he was so engrossed in reading he’d completely missed Harry’s question regarding handwriting, after he’d finished he jogged over to the filing cabinet beside the door and yanked it open, sifting through it in a very un-Draco-like way. “What’s up?” Harry asked, his eyes rested on the sticky note memo, he wondered if Draco could tell who wrote this particular piece of evidence.
“No, I mean, the crop circle doesn’t really tie in to illegal activity, unless they were doing something in that particular field and they had to cover it up, so they burnt the crop circle in to the field.” Harry bit down on his lower lip and jogged over to his desk leafing through some of the paperwork on his desk. Pulling out the sheet he was looking for his eyes skimmed the words until it landed on what he was looking for. “Yeah, here, look.” he held the sheet up and jogged over to Draco’s desk thrusting the parchment into his hands.
“Sorry,” Harry said lamely, ducking his head down a few inches. “So what you’re saying is, Lockwood was with the Celtic Serpents at least three months ago?” Draco just shrugged “I’m not sure - who was Lockwood’s partner when he was training?” Draco asked, looking at Harry expectantly. “Uh, er…” Harry frowned, racking his brains. He knew Lockwood’s partner hadn’t managed to complete their training but he would be damned if he knew who it was. If he could remember correctly, they were exceptionally lacklustre.
Draco smiled sadly at Harry, he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s hand, which was still resting on his cheek and closed his eyes, leaning in to that touch. Draco was terrified, he knew he was a good Auror, he’d worked incredibly hard to get where he was. He’d done it all with Harry, who made him strong, brave and better. Draco often regretted the decision to avoid a Mind Healer, he’d announced to everyone he planned to do it himself. Neither him nor Harry had attended.
Draco’s heart leapt. "Why is that excellent?" he asked, turning his head towards Potter once again, the look of pure confusion on his usually impassive features.
The healers levitated Draco out of his arms and moved him through the stark white corridors and through teal blue double doors off to the right. Harry followed them, but he was stopped by the Healer in charge. “Please wait here, Sir.” he said, before disappearing through the doors.
And, as we kissed, I knew that I’d fallen in love with you.
“Did you have a nice time with Harry?” Louisa asked, looking at him with that searching look he knew too well. His emotions must’ve been written all over his face, but nevertheless he shrugged his shoulders. “Yeah, fine.” he said, waving his hand.
“I would like to take the artifact in question so that myself and Unspeakable Granger can inspect it.” she said evenly, eyeing Kingsley. “That will be fine.” he nodded in agreement. Hermione bit her lip and turned her head towards Draco. “If it’s okay, we’d like to seize the vault so we can look through it a little better.”
“Before he left, however. He burnt a mark in to his desk.” Kingsley held up a photograph of the celtic serpent, his eyes studying Harry with intent. Harry’s eyes widened, he stood up and leant over to take the picture. Studying the mark, it was definitely the same mark they’d encountered recently, not a piece out of place. Harry would know, he’d spent the better part of hours and hours studying that blasted mark.

Scouring the reports he had laid out on his desk, Draco picked up one that was set aside and frowned, scanning the words. It seemed that someone had placed it there in a hurry but didn’t want it to be mixed up in the active reports. Draco murmured a quick spell to check there was nothing amiss, before turning his attention back to Harry. He had a slightly worried look on his face, that Harry instantly recognised.
I screamed, you laughed, then you kissed me. A wonderful, cold kiss.
“Are you sure?” Harry frowned, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Biting his lip, Draco looked at the hand on his shoulder and let out a sigh. “I talked with her family, it’s weird. I spent so much time with her and now she’s gone.”
I can’t tell you where I am- that would compromise you and I’m not willing to take any chances on your safety- but I’m still based in northern France. Millie, Ron and I are holed up in a filthy safe-house with only each other for company. Suffice to say, once I’m back home I’m intending to spend several hours letting you cleanse and groom me with the myriad of posh potions that you so adore. Then I’m intending to spend several more hours enjoying your company within our soft, white linen bedsheets… How much of that will be spend sleeping I will leave to your very vivid imagination!
Immediately, eyes rested upon Harry. Some were that of disdain, others wary. He let out a huff and linked his arm with Draco’s. Looking down at their linked arms, Draco bit his lip and walked up to the Head Goblin. “I have an appointment.” he declared smoothly, the Head Goblin looked him over and nodded his head, gesturing off to the right.
“Okay so where will we be meeting then? I have a feeling the others might get suspicious if we just walk in to your office at all hours of the day.” Dean sighed, turning to Seamus who shrugged his shoulders. “What about the safe house? You know the one we used when we were investigating those exploding cauldrons?”
“Stupefy!” Came the voice of Lavender, Harry hadn’t even noticed she’d entered the building. Backing up, Harry exited the side door, closing his eyes briefly. The light change dazzled him, he slumped down against the side of the building and took in a deep breath. He could feel the panic rising up in his chest, almost unable to breathe.
“Stupefy!” Seamus bellowed, hitting the person in front full pelt in the chest, he propelled backwards hitting the grass with impressive force. Seamus turned his attention to the man to the left, who seemed to be coming towards him. He quickly cast another Protego around him and shuffled towards Dean. “I’m going to need your help.” he shouted, eyes wild.

“She’s alright, I only like one song though,” he replied, studying Harry’s face. “I prefer Mariah Carey.” A slight blush tinged Draco’s cheeks as Harry let out a barking laugh. “Mariah Carey? Really?” Harry asked, almost disbelievingly.
Potter flashed his pearly white teeth in a grin and patted Draco on the shoulder. “Excellent!”
It was the first time Hermione had ever seen Unspeakable Wilson show any sort of emotion. The woman had immediately dived down, uncaring for her personal safety to attend to her friend. Hermione often wondered if there was more to their relationship than meets the eye, it wasn’t rare for Unspeakables to have personal relationships - they spent a lot of time together and really the only people you could talk to about the job were each other.
Merlin. If I’m this protective now, I can only imagine how bad I’ll be when it’s finally confirmed that you’re expecting our baby. Your every whim will be my command! I’ll probably end up growling at people for coming too close or something equally embarrassing. That’s why I’m loath to criticise Narcissa too much. I know that she’s overbearing but she’s only showing how much she loves you in her own
A gentle tapping on his office door pulled him out of his thoughts, he snapped back abruptly, staring at the door. The tapping was a departmental memo, he looked down at Draco who seemed to be mentally putting himself together. He cursed his luck, shaking his head. This was a conversation for another day.
“Oh this is exciting!” Louisa exclaimed, her head following the mess of red hair flying around the pitch. Draco was so busy in his own head he’d not even realised the match had started, he turned his head towards Louisa, a fond smile appearing on his lips. Draco felt a slight pang of guilt for not bringing her sooner, since Bethany was a witch Louisa wasn’t totally excluded from the Wizarding World, it was just that she couldn’t enter it without someone else.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed and looked around, noting the small TV sitting on a wooden cupboard just off to the right. This room was quite a lot nicer than the one he’d been in last night, but obviously the lack of two beds posed a problem. “Do you think the Premier Inn would mind if I transfigured their bed?” Draco asked, frowning at the bed sheets.
Looking down at his watch again, Seamus realised one thing. Auror Lockwood would’ve had one too. He thought back to the meeting they’d had when they were told how to use them, he remembered it registered coordinates of other Aurors at all times whilst the watch was being worn. Which meant Lockwood always knew where the others were. No wonder they always got away. A shift beside him caught Seamus’ eye, Draco began stirring. Dean quickly removed the stasis charm and knelt next to his fallen friend. “Are you alright?” he asked quietly.
Harry exhaled, turning his head towards Draco. “Nobody saw him get hit by anything though.” Harry frowned, he tried to think of everything that had happened today, the previous day, his mind spun, he sighed. “I found this in Mr. Malfoy’s robe pockets, perhaps it may help you?” Healer Jenkins offered. Passing over a piece of parchment, Harry’s fingers curled around it, crumpling it slightly.
And while we’re on the subject of food, Draco: I reckon that my mother-in-law brought you cookies because she’s precisely the same tricky Slytherin that you are. Where they those toffee and banana ones from the Elf bakery on Diagon Alley? With the ginger icing? They bloody
Shaking his head, Draco picked his own fork up and held it in his hand for a few moments. “You don’t help cook, nor do you set the table. We rarely bloody sit here, what’s wrong?” Harry shrugged his shoulders and shovelled a forkful of spaghetti in to his mouth.
Draco’s scowl deepened, he really didn’t want to think about Ron Weasley pounding his best friend. That was an image that he really didn’t need. “Lovely,” he drawled. Acutely aware he wouldn’t be getting to sleep anytime soon, Draco let out a sigh. “Do you want to play eye spy?” he asked, causing Potter to erupt into laughter. The man seemed to be fit to burst at any minute, it made Draco wonder what the bloody hell was wrong with him.
“Mrs. Dunn’s reported someone’s stolen her aubergines this time, there’s a witch in Hogsmeade that’s reported someone broke into her house - also there’s a crop circle here.” Dean shrugged, handing the reports to Draco who accepted them eagerly.
He decided on "When You Were Young" by the Killers. (when he'd told Pansy of his new iPod and music, she'd called him 'dreadfully edgy and not at all strange.' He turned the music up to full and closed his eyes, leaning his head back as though he intended to sleep.
“Another day in the life as a fucking Auror.” Draco whined, his head dropping down on to Harry’s shoulder. Harry pressed a kiss to his forehead, stunning Draco. They stood like that for about five minutes, Draco’s thoughts going wild.
After they’d finished watching the movie, they went on to watch a documentary about camels, which was in itself the weirdest experience of Draco’s life. He’d not watched many documentaries, nor did he really know much about camels. It was at least something to talk to Louisa about.
------------------------
Mrs. Dunn walked back through with a tray of cups, a pot of tea and a little bowl of sugar. She put it down on the small coffee table in front of them and smiled at Harry. “Could you tell me when you first noticed your pumpkins missing, Mrs Dunn?” Draco asked politely, giving her one of his classic fake smiles. Harry bit his lower lip.
“What does the snitch do?” Louisa asked, clapping her hands at every quaffle that entered the goal. Louisa enjoyed football, often Draco would find himself in a Wetherspoons watching a match with Louisa over a gin and tonic, it wasn’t unusual the woman would enjoy wizarding sports too.
I actually do have more gossip on the whole Ginny and Pansy front! Apparently they met up for lunch yesterday to discuss
“Do you know why Seamus and Dean ran off earlier?” he asked Draco, slightly confused as to what the other man was doing. Draco shook his head and frowned, slipping down from atop the cabinet. “No, let me check the reports.” he said, knitting his eyebrows together.
------------------
Harry and Draco stepped inside the vault together, their eyes wandering around the contents. Draco had never seen this vault before in his life. There were hundreds of paintings, scattered around the back wall, units as high as the ceiling ram packed with different artifacts. He stepped towards the first unit, frowning.
“Harry?” he called out, his eyes still adjusting to the darkness of the room. He couldn’t make out any defining features of the room, just that the ground he was sat on seemed to be broken shards of concrete, the floor powdering beneath his fingertips. “Yeah, I’m here,” came the distant reply of Harry.
“Mm, Mrs. Dunn has lost three of her prized pumpkins, apparently it’s quite the scandal in the Wizarding vegetable competition community.” the sarcasm and amusement in Draco’s voice made Harry laugh. “Wizarding vegetable competition community.” Harry repeated, shaking his head. “Who in the bloody fuck made that ridiculously long name, and also, who the fuck decides that growing vegetables is a really great hobby?”
“Draco, I could tell you liked him, why didn’t you ask him out?” she asked curiously, looking over her shoulder as they walked down the street. Draco let out a huff and shrugged his shoulders. “Heroes don’t end up with the Villains my dear Louisa.” he sighed.
