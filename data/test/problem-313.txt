“Argh!” Harry yelled, pulling his arm in to his body. He doubled over in pain, forcing his watering eyes to remain open.
The three of them trudged after Snape, a chorus of commiseration following them out. Snape led them to his office, where he sat behind the desk and gestured to three wooden chairs in front of him. Once they were sitting down, he folded his hands together and stared at them all.
Muted but urgent conversation broke out all over the room. Harry headed straight for his room and retrieved his Cloak. A few minutes later he handed it over to Snape when he entered the room. Snape cocked his head.
“Farley, Nott, what the fuck are you doing? We've missed three shots at goal due to a Bludger attacking us!” Flint fumed.
“Possession of a cursed object, knowingly giving a cursed object to a minor, and attempted murder,” Draco said quietly.
Back in the dungeons, Harry made straight for his bed while Draco rounded up the other boys. Something made Harry pick up Tom's diary to say a quick hello before heading down to the Quidditch pitch.
“They're, er, well... They're little tubes with electricity in them, that Muggles use to make portable electric devices work,” Harry explained awkwardly. He only had a basic understanding of them, himself.
They heard footsteps behind the curtain before it was yanked to one side to reveal a small, mousy looking man. His dark eyes lit up when he spotted his customers.
“Yes. If you're unable to serve us without gawking at him we shall take our business elsewhere,” Mrs Malfoy said disdainfully.
“Fine! Live a life full of awful poetry and stalker midgets and see if I care!” Draco sped up and moved to the front of the group.
“There's a legend that Salazar Slytherin built a chamber in Hogwarts, which the other three founders had no knowledge about. He'd left the school after a disagreement about letting in Muggle-born students, and supposedly left a monster in the chamber, which would purge the school of Muggle-borns.”
“I think that's casual clothes covered for now. I'll get Ainsley to try you for a set of robes – you can't wear your school robes in public, you know – and some winter coats. And I really must go help Draco with the jeans he promised you he'd buy.”
Harry read the instructions carefully. “It'd be the powdered dragon bone, wouldn't it? Too much of it, no, wait, it wasn't prepared properly?”
“Look out!” Gemma nipped in front of him and belted the Bludger towards one of the Gryffindor Chasers, only for it to once again change direction and head back towards Harry's head. Gemma frowned and swung her bat at it again, sending it off towards Wood.
Harry drained the glass and screwed his face up as steam billowed out of both ears. “How long will it last?”
Harry thought about all the times Draco had gotten mad recently. “No. He's been especially rude to Daphne lately.”
He led the way back out the front door, but instead of going down the drive, took a smaller path that followed the circumference of the house. As they passed through a formal garden filled with white roses, Harry thought happily how jealous Aunt Petunia would be if she could see it.
“Poor chap must be delirious, he clearly doesn't know what he's saying,” Lockhart said to the gathered crowd.
“Well, when Blaise tried to get in last year he got thrown out before he took two steps down the corridor,” Pansy giggled.
Harry groaned. “We've been over this already. Even if Hogwarts is unsafe, it's still more fun, and more of a home, than the Dursleys' ever will be. So why are you trying to get me gone?”
” Draco said impatiently when Harry had slowed to a stop. He spent the rest of the trip allowing Draco to pull him along as he listed all the possible ailments Harry might have contracted.
Harry frowned. “Er, well, since I was a baby, I guess, up until I got the spare bedroom upstairs when the Hogwarts letters started arriving.”
One morning during the last week of term, Draco received a letter from his mother that, for once, wasn't accompanied by a large box of sweets. He read it, pocketed it and stood up abruptly.
“I'll be down in a bit,” Draco replied. Harry shrugged and followed the others back to the dungeons.
Harry looked at the ceiling in confusion. It sounded like it was heading up somehow. He spun around and dashed up the stairs. He couldn't hear anything in the Entrance Hall as there was too much noise coming from the Great Hall. He swore and went up the marble staircase.
Harry blinked and turned away from the wall, just as the sound of excited voices came echoing towards them. Before they could move, a crowd of students came around the corner. When they saw the scene they came to an abrupt stop.
And so began one the most boring evenings of Harry's life. He ignored Lockhart's pronouncements about fame as best he could, thinking longingly of the detention he and Draco had had with Snape last year when they cleaned cauldrons. As he watched the clock tick forward far too slowly, he even began to think that he'd rather be in the Forbidden Forest facing Voldemort again.
Mrs Malfoy shook her head. “It slipped his mind, I daresay. No matter. That is a useful gift you have there, Harry. Now, am I right in assuming that these snakes will not harm us?”
“You're going to listen to the Valentine I have for you,” he said angrily before clearing his throat and singing in a gravelly voice:
Harry watched in amazement as the ashes wriggled. Soon enough, an ugly chick was sitting there. Dumbledore picked him up and put him back on the perch.
“Last Halloween you were more concerned with saving Miss Granger from Mr Weasley and a troll. What changed?”
They followed him into the infirmary, where Pomfrey was bending over a Ravenclaw girl. Harry barely registered their presence as he and Draco rushed over to the next bed. Hermione was lying on it, unmoving, staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling. Draco put his hand on her arm as Harry stood next to him. He felt a painful jolt in his stomach as he stared down at her.
Harry looked up from his trunk and glared. “How dumb do you think I am? Of course I'm not going to tell anyone else.”
The Gryffindors' glares intensified, but they moved down the table. Draco sat back in satisfaction. “I didn't think that would actually work. I'm going to have so much fun with this.”
“I didn't mean to upset you,” Harry said awkwardly. “Let's start over. I'm Harry, and this is Draco. What's your name?”
Harry let out a shaky breath as he got to his feet. This was not good, not good at all. He looked around him, but there was no one in the corridor. He could hear the muffled sounds of nearby classes, but he was alone in the corridor. He could run and deny ever being here – but he should get help. Or would that still make him seem guilty? He stood there trying not to panic, when Peeves burst out of a classroom next to him.
” Harry cried. A flash of red light, and Draco's wand was spinning out of his hand. He shot a surprised look at Harry and went to retrieve it. Harry took the moment to look around the hall. Pansy seemed to have succeeded, as Millicent was wandless and currently had Pansy in a headlock instead. As Harry watched in amusement, Snape made his way over to them.
Two days later Harry was doing his Charms homework as he waited for Draco to wake up, when Tilly popped into his room with Hedwig perched on her arm.
Harry stared at him in horror. He couldn't think of a single way out of this. His only hope was that someone would come after him, but he didn't even know how they'd find out where the Chamber was. He had to get his wand back somehow. He might not be able to save himself, but maybe he could stop Tom from fully escaping the diary.
Harry looked at the store doubtfully. It was small and dark, and he could just make out the sign above the display windows.
Ginny sat down between him and Neville. “Not bad, considering. Mostly embarrassed. Dad was pretty annoyed that I'd kept the diary in the first place. But I tried to get rid of it a few months ago, so I've been back to normal for a while now. I feel pretty guilty about everything, though.”
The entire staff was looking angry, even the normally cheerful Flitwick. All except Lockhart, that was. Dressed in pink robes that precisely matched the shade of the decorative flowers, he was getting to his feet.
“Ten points to Slytherin,” Snape said, before moving off to separate Greg and Vince, who were wrestling on the floor.
“Yeah...” Harry looked at Draco for help, but the blonde was busy avoiding his eye by patting Fang. “We wanted to ask you, er, well... It's about the Chamber of Secrets.”
“Just go back to sleep during class,” said Draco dismissively. “Listen, we've got a double free this afternoon. Come help me practise for the Quidditch try outs.”
Draco laughed. “Relax, Daphne, we've burnt all his old clothes. He'll just have to get used to the attention.”
Draco shrugged. “Ask if I can take the credit? I like the idea of the school being afraid of us. Think how easy Quidditch will be if our opponents are too scared to come near us!”
Draco was sitting against his pillows, and closed the curtain again when Harry sat at the foot of the bed. He was already in his pyjamas, and had sheets of parchment scattered on the bed.
Hagrid looked down at his hand as if he'd forgotten the rooster was there. “Summat's bin killin' me roosters. This is the second one this term. It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear, but I need Dumbledore's permission to put a charm around the chook house.” Hagrid paused, and leaned a little closer. “Yeh sure yer all right? Yeh look mighty annoyed about somethin'.”
Draco threw down his quill. “It probably is. Maybe I'll just have to memorise it better. How do you do it?”
Miles consulted his notes. “Your friends, actually. Nott and Zabini bet on the Dark Lord, and Crabbe and Goyle on his mum.”
Daphne made a face. “Ugh, boring. Maybe I'll catch you later,” she said, then returned to her family. Harry saw a younger girl who had to be her sister; she looked like a miniature Daphne.
As they walked along the village street, Harry couldn't help but look in every window at his reflection. He'd worn one of his new outfits out of the store, and was amazed to see how much better he looked in clothes that fit properly.
Harry skipped dinner, choosing to ensconce himself on his bed with the curtains drawn and the last of Hagrid's fudge. He upended his schoolbag onto his bed and picked up the diary. As distracted as he'd been by Hermione's revelation, he hadn't realised what had been bugging him about the diary, but now it was obvious. Unlike the rest of his books, which had been covered in ink, the diary was ink free. Harry frowned. The diary had been with his other books; there was no way the ink could have missed it.
“No second year could have done this. It would require advanced knowledge of Dark magic to do such a thing,” Dumbledore said firmly.
Harry tried to back away, but Greg and Vince were blocking the way. As he tried to squirm through them, the dwarf grabbed hold of his bag and yanked. His bag split and all his school things fell to the floor, where his ink bottle smashed and drenched the lot.
The class was lined up outside the classroom waiting for Lockhart to arrive, listening to Draco raving about the Nimbus 2001s that Mr Malfoy would be buying for the entire Slytherin team. Harry wasn't listening, as he had a perfectly good Nimbus 2000, and looked away to notice that the Creevey boy was staring at him. A group of equally small Gryffindors stood behind him.
That turned out to be a mistake, as the Bludger chose that time to rocket back towards him, and it smashed through his forearm at high speed. There was a sickening cracking sound.
“Good. Managed to score a goal, actually, before the Gryffindor Beaters realised that both of ours were hovering around you,” Draco replied.
“Come along, Mr Potter,” Snape said. Harry swallowed a sigh and followed in silence as Snape led him through the deserted hallways to his office. He sat down behind his desk and waited as Harry sat nervously before him. “What was that?”
“Apology accepted,” Draco said, and stuck out his hand. Harry ignored it and pulled Draco into a hug. Draco was stiff at first, but soon returned the hug.
“Gringotts it is then,” Draco said. He'd only taken a few steps before there was a loud squeal of “Draco!”, and he was enveloped by a large quantity of brown hair.
Gemma looked at him askance before looking back at the teachers. “It feels wrong not to be betting on McGonagall this year... She's so uptight, she's got to crack sometime.”
Altogether, Harry wasn't as happy as he'd been last year to sign up to stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. At least this year he'd have company, as Draco and Hermione were staying too. Mrs Malfoy was in the midst of redecorating Malfoy Manor, and Draco declared her to be unbearable during such times. Hermione just wanted to stay for the library. Greg and Vince were also staying, as they wanted to try the food at the Hogwarts Christmas feast.
“I'm sorry, but that won't be possible this summer,” Narcissa said apologetically. “In light of your father's trial, I've decided that we need to spend some time together as a family.”
Hagrid shuddered. “No' yet, but I'll be right after some chocolate. Maybe a drink. I better go see Dumbledore.”
“The match has been cancelled. All students are to immediately return to their house common rooms, and remain there until their Heads of Houses arrive to address them all. As quickly as you can, please.”
Harry walked to the sink she'd pointed to. Sure enough, there was a thin, battered book lying in the water on the floor. He bent down to pick it up and turned it over.
“Of course, sir!” Tilly disappeared, and returned a minute later with a silver tray. There was a matching jug, a mug, and a bowl of marshmallows with a tiny pair of tongs.
Harry looked at Draco in alarm before replying. “Someone threw something at you? Are you hurt? We can help you to the hospital wing if you – oh,” he trailed off as a ghost emerged from one of the toilet stalls. She looked like she was only a little older than them, and dressed in an old Ravenclaw uniform.
“It's going to kill someone!” Harry shouted and ran up yet more stairs. He burst onto the second floor and ran down the corridor.
As they set off, Harry couldn't stop the grin from spreading over his face. “Thank you for coming to get me.”
It was only when the bewitched ceiling was showing the grey light of dawn that Dumbledore called an end to the feast. As the sleepy but cheerful crowds made their way to the dormitories, Harry tugged on Draco's sleeve.
Harry nodded. He wanted nothing more than to collapse into bed. Snape frowned briefly at him, but swept out of the room without saying anything else. Not a minute later Draco burst through the door with the rest of the second years trailing after him.
“What? Can't it be with you? You're our Head of House, aren't you in charge of punishing us? We could clean cauldrons!” Harry said desperately.
“Aha! I knew she'd remember!” When Harry looked up at Draco's exclamation, he held up a box of green apples. “From the orchard at home. Mother always saves the last of them for me.”
. I mean, I didn't even know I could speak it until you pointed it out to me. So... I'll try, but don't get your hopes up. I've never taught anyone before, I'll probably be pants at it.”
They crept forward and peered around it carefully. It was the corridor where Mrs Norris had been found, and Filch was stomping off the other way, swearing loudly. They waited until he'd gone and moved forward. There was a large puddle of water spreading across the corridor, seeping out from a closed door.
Theo rolled his eyes. “We know you're full of it Malfoy. And the Dark Lord was pretty active last year for someone who's supposedly dead, so it's not that far-fetched. You've still got good odds, so what's the problem?”
“Perfect,” Harry muttered, opening his trunk. He carefully pulled out the preserved daisy chain Daphne had given him last year and hung it from one of his bed posts. He could redecorate, too.
have blocked you if I'd wanted, as you telegraphed your move rather obviously, but for demonstrative purposes...”
“Oh, you survived,” came a glum voice. Harry looked up to see Myrtle staring at him mournfully. “I'd hoped you'd become a ghost and share my bathroom.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly. Do you two really think anyone is going to look a thousand years into Draco's family tree? Face it, as far as the students here are concerned, you two are guilty simply for being Slytherins caught at the scene.”
Theo nudged Harry. “Don't worry, Snape'll eviscerate him!” They sniggered and ignored Daphne's glare.
Draco sighed. “He did, yes. But he was acting odder than usual last night, so I commanded him to tell me what was wrong. He can't disobey a direct order from anyone in the family, you see, so he had to tell me what he'd done here. Naturally I went straight to Mother, and here we are.”
“Good. Want to visit Ollie?” Harry didn't know what Draco's problem was this morning, but he figured speaking Parseltongue to Ollie might cheer him up.
Mrs Malfoy retreated to her study after dinner, and the boys to the lounge. Draco was reading a wizarding children's series that Harry had never heard of before, while Harry was methodically working his way through his snake encyclopaedia. It was slow going but completely engrossing, and he didn't hear Draco quietly get up and leave.
Harry laughed. Two of the beds had posters of what Harry assumed to be wizarding celebrities plastered around them. He caught sight of Lockhart's toothy grin and looked away to Hermione's bed, which was surrounded by piles of books and neat stacks of parchment and quills. There were two picture frames on her bedside table. One showed a Muggle photo of her with her parents, and the other had a moving photo of her with Harry and Draco.
, he thought, as he listened to Draco reel off another incomprehensible name. He greatly enjoyed his first taste of wine, though.
Hermione took a sip of pumpkin juice and nodded. “And of course the story's spread all through Gryffindor, probably the whole school by now. Some of the other Gryffindors have been more vocal than usual about their opinions on Neville and I being friends with you.”
Hermione squeezed in between Harry and Neville as Pansy resumed the tale. Harry grinned down at the table. He hadn't realised this at the time, but he'd missed this when he was possessed: just sitting  with his friends. He felt like he hadn't seen them in months.
“Okay...” Harry was trying to figure out what any of this meant, but his brain was refusing to cooperate.
He grabbed his mail and settled down on the bed. He hesitated a second, then called out uncertainly.  “Tilly?” He smiled in relief as the little elf appeared by his bed.
“It doesn't change things,” Draco added. “Either way, we ended up stumbling across a Petrified cat before being found by the entire school.”
“Given that you're talking to yourself, I'd say insanity is a distinct possibility,” came Draco's sleepy drawl. A second later he opened his bed curtain, smirking at his own joke. He took one look at Harry and his face fell.
Harry and Draco quickly went and grabbed the last book on their lists and paid, before making their way back to Mr Malfoy. Hagrid and the Weasleys had all disappeared by the time they returned. They followed Mr Malfoy in silence as he led the way out of the shop. When they got outside he looked at Draco. “Have you anything left to buy?”
, he thought. Not only did he like the green and white stripes, but they actually fit. That would take some time to get used to.
“No. I'm afraid that Professor Lockhart didn't break any school rules. While I understand it led to an uncomfortable night for you, you're all right now. So no harm done.”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry. “Mr Potter, you are not responsible for what you did whilst possessed by Riddle. Now, what happened in the Chamber?”
Harry could feel Draco fuming as they made their way back to the castle. “What's wrong? I thought that went well, considering.”
Draco gave him a polite smile and continued. “Hagrid had told Harry and I that the last time the Chamber was opened, a girl died. And I thought that it might have been Myrtle, the ghost who haunts the bathroom on the first floor. So we went and asked her about her death. She told us she couldn't remember anything except for glowing yellow eyes, and Professor Snape said that sounded like a basilisk to him. She pointed us towards a sink, and it opened up when I spoke Parseltongue to it. And that's all I can tell you, I'm afraid,” Draco broke off, shooting a dirty look at Snape.
Harry looked up at Ginny. “You can sit down. I just wanted to know how you were doing. You know, after the whole possession thing.”
“I don't know,” Draco huffed. “But I have a really bad feeling about all of this. I think I'll write to my father and try to make him change his mind about Hagrid. I doubt it'll work, but it can't make anything worse, right?”
Draco snorted. “No, he still doesn't like her. I haven't mentioned her to him at all this summer after what he said the first time I did so.”
. He and his school mates will, in fact, be getting the real, magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”
Then an owl swooped in through the open window, deposited a letter on Mrs Mason's head and flew back out. The Masons left in a barrage of shouting and screaming, and Harry carefully positioned his mop and bucket between himself and the Dursleys. It wasn't much, but it made him feel marginally safer as Uncle Vernon advanced on him.
“And apparently they take security a bit more seriously than Slytherin. Big deal.” Harry flopped onto his bed and sniffed his hands, pleased when he couldn't smell any trace of vinegar. He looked up when he heard a hoot, but it was Thoth and not Hedwig who flew into the room.
Mrs Malfoy nodded once and raised her wand, which she hadn't put away. Given the shouting still coming from downstairs, Harry couldn't blame her. She silently unlocked the lock on Hedwig's cage, then aimed her wand at the window. The bars outside disappeared with a bang.
The Great Hall was mostly empty when they arrived, so when they saw Hermione reading at the Gryffindor table, they joined her. She looked up, startled.
Draco shook his head. “No, I'm sorry for getting cross when we got home. When you said I was a you-know-what.”
He quickly grabbed a new bottle of ink, dipped a quill in it, and let some drops fall onto the first page of the diary. They gleamed on the paper for a moment, before sinking into the page, leaving it blank. Harry stared at the diary for a second then quickly re-inked his quill.
“Potter! We've got Quidditch try outs tomorrow evening at seven, and I want you there. We need to replace Higgs and Shabes, so let your friends know we're looking for a Chaser and a Beater.”
As his friends laughed, Harry looked down at his schedule and groaned. “We have double History of Magic first thing tomorrow. How is anyone supposed to stay awake for that?”
“We have. Like last time, it was Voldemort,” Dumbledore said, ignoring the way Fudge jumped at the name. “Only this time, he was working by proxy, though this diary.”
Bag finally full, Harry locked the door and pocketed the key. “Don't worry. It's nice that you don't think of me as some tragic orphan.”
“Yes. If I hadn't found him...” McGonagall trailed off as they all stared down at the unmoving body.
He was in a large stone cavern. There were pillars lining the room with stone snakes twining around them. Harry was lying at the base of one. When he craned his head, he saw that it was a gigantic statue. With a sinking feeling, he realised that this must be the Chamber of Secrets, and the statue must be of Salazar Slytherin.
Mrs Malfoy surveyed the Dursleys coldly. “Mr and Mrs Dursley, when Draco told me what little Harry had told him of his upbringing, I thought he was exaggerating.” When Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, she held up her hand. “You will not interrupt me. As I was saying, I thought my son was exaggerating. I didn't think it was possible that two people – people with a child of their own – could force their nephew to live in a cupboard. But as it turns out, you could, and did, do exactly that. And then when he returned from school, you locked him in his bedroom. Did you know that this past June, Harry nearly died facing down a corrupted professor who was attempting to resurrect the Dark Lord?”
Given Hagrid's history with dangerous creatures, Harry doubted that, but decided now wasn't the time to press the issue. “Alright. So, they thought it was your spider. Did they ever find out what it was? Or who was behind it all?”
and the claims Lockhart had made in it. It was only when an excited Theo had spoken to him after class that Harry had learned what he'd missed.
“You don't remember? I had you write your own death notice on the wall before you came down here. The school should be in a state of panic by now.” Tom smiled. “Through the diary, I've taken strength from both Ginny and you, allowing me to leave the pages at long last. I imagine you have less than half an hour before you lose consciousness. Within the hour, you'll be dead and I'll be fully corporeal.”
” To his surprise, a long black snake exploded out of his wand and landed heavily on the stage. It raised its head as it looked around at the crowd, which was quickly backing away.
“I'm going to go talk to that Hufflepuff from last night. Tell him I told the snake not to attack him.”
Draco shrugged. “Well, the school's full of morons then. Have you heard of this Chamber before, Hermione?”
Draco gave her a withering glance. “But we're all you have. Unless, of course, you want to spend your days gossiping with Brown and Patil about boys.”
“Come now, I expected a better show from you than this!” Lockhart called from behind his desk. He raised his wand and shook his sleeves back with a flourish. “
Harry stared blankly at Pomfrey as she fussed around him asking questions and checking him over. Finally she handed him a large glass of Pepperup potion. “You're just coming down with the flu, dear. Nothing to worry about.”
“It won't come,” Tom said in amusement. “I have to call it, and I don't want it killing you when I need to feed off your energy.”
Herbology lessons with the Ravenclaws had gone back to normal. Harry and Draco were once again sharing a table with Padma and Morag. Not only had they apologised for thinking that Harry and Draco had been responsible for the attacks, but Daphne wanted to share a table with Stephen Cornfoot. The four of them spent their lessons watching Daphne and Stephen flirt with each other as Tracey and Anthony Goldstein tried in vain to get them to pay attention to their work station.
When the train pulled up at Hogsmeade station they piled out onto the bustling platform. Harry looked around and spotted Hagrid and waved.
Harry quickly grabbed the Walkman and biscuit tin from under the floorboard, then gathered up his drawing supplies from his bedside table. “Everything else is in my cupboard under the stairs,” he said awkwardly.
Harry twisted around to see Neville standing behind him. “Me too. Sit down,” Harry said, shooing Daphne, Greg and Vince down a seat.
,” he sang quietly as he hung his new robes and matching cloak in the closet. They were a dark green, and one of his favourite new garments. “
“Weren't you the one who told me to ask for help instead of blundering in on my own?” Harry asked with a grin.
McGonagall gave them a disbelieving look but didn't say anything, merely looked over their heads at Snape and then at Dumbledore.
“I'm not entirely sure I'm the best person to be talking to about this,” Hermione said slowly. “I think you should talk to Draco.”
“I dunno. Just... Something seems off about all of this. I don't understand how someone could have done all of this, you know? And if he's so good at fighting Dark creatures, why is he coming to teach at Hogwarts?”
“People see what they want to see, Mr Potter, and you were already under suspicion. I dare say that after tonight, many people will be convinced of your guilt.”
Harry whacked him with a pillow before flopping down beside him. “You know I was right about Quirrell.”
“Pansy, you're fantastic. Thanks,” Harry said gratefully. He scanned the Hufflepuff table, but couldn't see Justin.
Harry forced down the potion and winced at the foul taste before Pomfrey took back the beaker and retreated to her office.
“No. We got to the Entrance Hall and saw the feast was nearly finished, so we decided to go up to the Astronomy Tower for a bit, and get food from the kitchens later,” Draco explained. Harry quickly nodded.
Harry couldn't help the goofy smile that spread over his face as he read the note. He put it down to open the small parcel it was attached to. It turned out to be a beautiful silver cloak pin, fashioned into the shape of a loosely curled serpent with tiny emeralds for eyes.
As the staff exchanged worried glances, Harry lay back and stared at the ceiling. He had the feeling that both Dobby and Dumbledore knew more than they were letting on, and while he knew there was nothing he could do about Dumbledore, he did have leverage over Dobby. All he had to do was tell Draco that it was Dobby who had tampered with the Bludger, and Draco would immediately write to his parents.
“Well, I've written to my parents asking if they know anything about the last time it was opened, so that might help,” Draco said.
Dumbledore looked at McGonagall. “Minerva, please fetch Miss Weasley and take her to the hospital wing to get checked out, then inform her parents. And then, if you would be so kind, alert the elves that we will be having a celebratory feast in, oh, an hour's time.”
“I was a Death Eater, Harry,” Snape said. Harry looked at him blankly. “One of the Dark Lord's followers.”
When Harry and Draco had a firm hold on either hand, Mrs Malfoy gave a quick glance around them. The next thing Harry knew, Mrs Malfoy's hand jerked away from his grip, and he tightened his hand as he felt as if he were being squeezed through a tight tube. There was pressure all around him, he couldn't breathe properly and his eyes were surely being pushed into his skull and -
When their names were mentioned Flitwick hid his face in his hands and Snape exchanged a dark look with McGonagall.
The wall slid open again. Harry stepped through, frowning. So the wall opened to Parseltongue. Well, that was good to know. No more worrying if he couldn't remember the password. He ignored the few students sitting in the common room, and made his way to the notice board to check the password.
“It's so good to finally meet you, Harry,” she said warmly. “Though I do wish the circumstances were a little happier.” As she said this she gazed around the room. When she saw the abandoned can of soup and the bars on the windows she breathed in sharply and narrowed her eyes.
“No, I wouldn't say that. You've already picked up some things. Why don't you have a look in the library and see if there are any books on creating a writing system?”
Draco took Harry's shrunken possessions out of his pocket and placed them on the bed, and pointed to the doors on one wall. “That's your bathroom through there, and that's the closet. A house-elf will be up later to unshrink your things and put them away for you. Now come on, I want to show you my room.”
“You couldn't. We do change our passwords, you know, and boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorms,” she said at once.
Lockhart heard the commotion and looked up at Draco, before his eyes landed on Harry and he leapt to his feat. “It
Snape narrowed his eyes. “I did not brew the swill you had to drink last month. That was a commercial brand that somehow got left in the infirmary's stock despite its inferior quality. Can you tell me what was wrong with it?”
“Dead or not, its gaze remains deadly,” Snape replied. He conjured up a leather bag and levitated the diary – still with the fang stuck in it – inside it, before shutting it and slinging the strap over his shoulder. “Let's get out of here.”
Draco started getting dressed quickly. “I'm taking you to Pomfrey. You must be coming down with something.”
Seeing Pansy beginning to glower at Hermione, Harry hurriedly asked Neville how his summer had gone. The rest of the compartment seemed content to let the subject drop, except for Hermione, who pulled out
“Come to the kitchens and then go for a fly?” Harry asked. “I don't feel like being glared at all through breakfast.”
“Yes, stay here.” Draco covered his head with his arms and ran to retrieve the glasses as the rest of the class headed for the door. Harry was putting his now cracked glasses back on when Lockhart stopped by the door.
“Oh, so you are aware of what the Dark Lord was like? Did your sister perhaps tell you tales of the atrocities he and his followers committed? The nephew you have had locked in his room is the only reason that the Dark Lord wasn't resurrected two months ago.” Mrs Malfoy sighed. “I had hoped to appeal to your sense of decency or, failing that, to talk to you as rational human beings. I can see that neither is an option, so let me resort to a cruder method. Harry will be staying with us for the remainder of the summer, and will then spend the rest of the year at Hogwarts. He will then return to King's Cross Station at the end of the school year. You will be there to pick him up. You will bring him back home for the summer. He will be allowed to sleep in his bedroom upstairs, and fed adequately. He will not be kept prisoner, and nor will his owl. You will not lock up his possessions where he can't access them. And you will treat him civilly for the summer. He will be allowed to correspond with his friends. And then you will take him to King's Cross Station when it is time for him to return to school.”
“The woolly bear caterpillars need to be sliced, Mr Potter, unless you wish for the potion to become a powerful depilatory,” Snape said as he moved about the room.
Harry didn't give them a chance to reply, but turned around and stormed out of the library, ignoring Madam Pince's glare. He wasn't looking where he was going, and just walked blindly down a corridor until he ran into something large which knocked him to the ground.
He'd been feeling off for a few days now. He'd only smiled weakly when Dumbledore had  announced one breakfast that Lockhart would be indisposed for the rest of the week. He'd nearly fallen asleep during Defence, despite the fact that Snape had taken the class. Struggling to stay awake, he hadn't realised that Snape's lecture had systematically destroyed
Draco led him out into the deserted grounds and made for their usual spot near the lake. Harry leaned against the sun-warmed rock and waited for Draco to speak.
Harry spun around to find Ron sneering at him. Next to him was a girl who must be his sister. She was standing next to a cauldron and staring wide eyed at Harry. Draco stopped laughing and stepped up beside Harry.
Draco was frowning too. “Doesn't this mean that you'll be blamed this time, too? I mean, most of the students think it's Harry, but if the staff know that you got expelled for the last time...”
As Gemma explained the rules to the people who hadn't been involved with this tradition before, Harry studied the staff table. Snape was waving his hands more than usual as he spoke to McGonagall and Flitwick, who were both laughing; Lockhart was talking to a bored looking Pomfrey who certainly seemed to be drinking a lot; and Hagrid was singing carols with Dumbledore. At the end of the table, two teachers Harry didn't know (one of whom was missing an arm) seemed to have collected all the jokes from the Christmas crackers and were reading them aloud through gales of laughter.
Gemma studied him through narrowed eyes. “Fine. I'll focus on the rest of the team. No offence, Theo, but I'm more experienced.”
Harry paused in the corridor to look up at the wall. Under the original message about the Chamber was another, written in a different hand.
Harry wondered. He might have a broken arm because of Dobby, but he still didn't want to get Dobby into trouble with Mr Malfoy – who knew how he'd punish the poor elf?
“And now allow me to introduce my assistant here, Professor Snape. He tells me he has a little experience in this area, and has kindly agreed to join me with a brief demonstration before we get started. But don't you worry, I'll leave your Potions master in one piece!”
Draco waved a hand impatiently. “Gryffindors being idiots isn't anything we didn't already know. But this news is terrible!”
To Harry's delight, his potion had turned out perfectly, and he packed up in a much better mood. He paused as he put his hand on the doorknob. “Sir? Could I help with your brewing another time?”
Draco snorted. “Of course they did. Why on earth is Hawthorn on here? Surely this would involve breaking far too many rules for him to have done it.”
“It's wee Parselmouth Potter! Hiss hiss hiss, give a snake a kiss!” Peeves cackled, before he caught sight of the figures lying frozen. He came to an exaggerated stop in mid-air. “ATTACK! ATTACK! POTTER'S ON THE RAMPAGE! NO ONE IS SAFE, NOT EVEN A GHOST! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!”
Harry dug through the mess on his bed and handed it to her. She turned it over curiously, jumping a little when she pressed the eject button and the tape compartment popped open. She delicately closed it again then waved her wand over it before handing it back.
Draco glared at him. “Yes, I do. Remember when I told you that you're hopeless when it comes to noticing when someone likes you? You haven't gotten any better.”
Dobby jumped off the bed and came over to Harry. “Dobby has come to warn Harry Potter, sir. Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!”
Snape just poured a goblet of cider and pushed it across the table. “Eat, Mr Potter. You'll need a clear head to bottle the Pepperup.”
“No, I'll be too busy. Do well in school, and you'll get that broom if you get on the Quidditch team.”
“Please, between her and Creevey, it was hard to tell who's more in love with Harry. I wouldn't be surprised if she'd attacked Creevey to get rid of the competition.”
They said one last goodbye and boarded the train. Halfway down the carriage they found an empty compartment and entered before a group of Ravenclaws could claim it. They ignored the glares as they got settled in, and were soon joined by Daphne and Pansy. Daphne sat down between the two boys and turned to Harry.
As usual, they found Ollie sunning himself on his rock. He opened one eye lazily when he heard them approaching. “
Mrs Malfoy smiled slightly. “You're welcome to stay here next summer. In fact, I doubt Draco would forgive me if you didn't.”
“Right,” Harry said, hiding a grin as he scooped up the chopped starfish and checked the instructions again. The potion now needed to boil for twenty minutes before decanting, so he started to clean up his work bench.
Harry shrugged. “We should probably give Lockhart a chance to prove he's not as much of a wanker as he appears to be, but sure.”
Harry nodded as Draco glowered up at Snape. For his part, Snape simply resumed walking towards the dungeons. They found the common room packed with the entire house in attendance. Some people were on the couches, others standing or sitting on the floor. All of them were talking in tense groups. They quickly fell silent when they saw Snape enter.
“Yeah, she's adorable,” Draco said distractedly. He was sitting on Harry's bed, with his drawings scattered around him. “Harry, these are really good.”
He wasn't surprised when Draco ignored him and pulled the curtain back. He was, however, surprised to see Snape standing next to him.
“Uh huh, sure. Come on, let's go tell the others about this,” Pansy smiled up at the glowering Millicent.
Harry carefully selected his best shirt and jeans; he had a feeling dinner with the Malfoys would be a fancy affair. He was trying unsuccessfully to flatten his hair into something neat when there was a knock at the door.
“Ah, I take it you've never seen a wizarding department store then?” Ainsley asked Harry as he squeezed past him. “More variety than any shop in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. Now,” he turned his attention back to Mrs Malfoy. “How can I help you today? A new set of formal robes, perhaps?”
Draco grimaced. “Yes. He claimed to have been coerced into it, but I've had my doubts for a while. What I learned tonight has pretty much made up my mind, though.”
Harry cut him off by jumping on him and giving him a fierce hug that half-buried him in the pile of pillows. He pulled back to look at the snake book as Draco sat up spluttering. Harry glanced at him before returning to the book. “Sorry, didn't mean to crush you like that. It's just, this is really thoughtful. I love it.”
“I was rather enjoying having the school think it was me! No one's going to think that anymore if my own friends don't bet on me!”
Harry watched as Wood ran after McGonagall, clearly complaining about the cancelled match. Draco gave him a shove. “Come on, Harry.”
At the end of the hallway Tilly opened the last door and handed Harry the bundle of meat. “Can Tilly do anything else, sir?”
Mrs Malfoy sighed happily. “Well, Harry, I expect you're eager to get home and look at your new purchases, but how about we have lunch first? There's a bakery not too far away that does the most exquisite pastries, and Draco's fond of their milkshakes.”
Flint scanned it quickly. “Great. Training tomorrow straight after breakfast, tell Malfoy and Nott.”
Hermione looked at him. “You know what they're like about Neville and I being friends with you. How do you think they're going to react when two Slytherins are found next to a Petrified cat?”
“And Harry!” Daphne let go of Draco and hugged Harry. She pulled back and looked him up and down. “Wow, Harry, you look great. Really great.”
Harry held out his arm in silence. Snape took hold of his wrist and checked his pulse before releasing it. “Follow my finger without blinking,” he ordered. Harry watched as Snape moved his finger from side to side in front of his face.
When Harry finished at the sink, he found Snape sitting at his desk, which had been cleared of its usual assortment of books and potions paraphernalia. Instead there were two bowls of pumpkin soup, a plate of crusty bread, and a pitcher of apple cider.
Harry smirked and deliberately jostled the bed more than necessary as he sat back against the pillows. “I got a letter from Hermione this morning. She wants to know if we can meet up in Diagon Alley. She's going there next Wednesday.”
Draco wandered over to one of the bedside tables and sifted through the drawings on it as Harry watched Tilly pack his trunk. In just a few minutes, she had his books stacked neatly on one side of the trunk, with his tightly folded clothes on the other, cushioning his more delicate potions equipment.
At that, Ron launched himself at Draco, sending both of them crashing to the floor. A few students shrieked, and Vince started chanting “Fight!”
“Please tell me you won't be challenging Blaise for the title of vainest Slytherin,” Draco drawled after a while of this.
Lockhart got to his feet looking shaken. “There, now, that was a Disarming Charm. If someone has seen my wand – ah, thank you, Miss Brown. Yes, capital idea to demonstrate that, Professor Snape. I, of course,
“Don't fret. There's a simple charm I can perform later, that will allow your device to work as normal. And it won't require batteries, either.”
“Humph! I can mend bones instantly, but regrowing them is a much slower, and more painful, business. You'll have to stay overnight,” she said grumpily, and passed him a pair of pyjamas. She and Hermione walked around the drawn curtains as Draco helped Harry get changed. His useless arm was difficult to force through the sleeve.
As the crowd applauded wildly, Lockhart dumped his entire works into Harry's arms. Harry took the opportunity to escape and quickly headed back to Draco. He found him pink in the face from laughter.
“Thank you, Gilderoy,” Dumbledore said and led them through. Harry caught sight of Hermione's pale face as they went past. They were followed by Lockhart, Snape and McGonagall. When they entered the dark office, Harry caught sight of a few of Lockhart's portraits ducking out of frame, with their hair in curlers.
For the first time Harry had found it awkward sharing the Cloak with Draco. They'd shared it enough that they walked together effortlessly. But tonight Harry had been very aware of Draco behind him: the warmth of his body against his back; the gentle puff of breath in his ear whenever Draco whispered to him; the occasional brush of an arm or leg against his own. He didn't know about Draco, but Harry had been tingly and jittery by the time they got to the Defence office, and it had had nothing to do with what they were about to do.
“They were discovered in the vicinity of the library,” Snape said. “This was found at their feet; have you any idea of its significance?”
Even Herbology, which they shared with the Ravenclaws, was somewhat of an ordeal. While not as overt as the Gryffindors, they still made classes awkward. Harry and Draco had spent the start of the year working in a group with two Ravenclaw girls, Morag MacDougal and Padma Patil, and had gotten along fine with them. But the first lesson after Colin's attack, they'd suddenly found their table now contained Daphne and Tracey instead. Harry tried not to let it rankle, as both girls were good at Herbology, but it still upset him that people he'd liked were now avoiding him. Even Draco's threats of Petrification to anyone who annoyed him were now starting to sound slightly defensive.
Flitwick came racing out of his classroom. “Stop this at once!” he shouted, and let out a loud bang with his wand. When Draco and Ron broke apart and got to their feet, he glared up at them. “Ten points from both of you for fighting! All of you get to class right now!”
“That will never work! Do you want to make a laughingstock of the Ministry?” shouted the man in the suit.
“Yes, Master Draco,” Dobby said, then paused. “Dobby is happy that Master Draco and Harry Potter are safe,” he said before Disapparating again. Draco frowned after him.
Snape rolled his eyes. “Mr Malfoy will forgive you, I'm sure. Especially once you tell him I've received complaints about the way he has been behaving recently. I was almost at the point of having a talk with him about it. Besides which, after the school witnessed you conversing with a snake about to attack Finch-Fletchley, you'll have bigger problems.”
“Once Mr Malfoy was secured and hidden, I entered the Chamber. I found Mr Potter sitting on the ground, clearly weakened, as Tom Riddle stood over him.”
Harry shot him an exasperated look. “It won't be that bad. And it's better we just ask him than try to snoop around ourselves like we did last year with Quirrell.”
Draco followed him into the cool hall of Gringotts. A few minutes later, they were squeezed into a cart along with a goblin, and were travelling at breakneck speeds along the twisty track to Harry's vault. The ride was even more enjoyable than last year, since he didn't have a queasy Hagrid in the cart with him.
“Draco, you were hysterical over Harry disappearing, made Gemma summon Snape and then left with him and didn't return,” Pansy explained. “We all thought you'd been attacked, too, but the Prefects wouldn't let us leave the common room. Not until McGonagall came down to tell us about the feast.”
Harry lifted his arm and considered it. “Sort of like really bad pins and needles at the moment. Pomfrey says it'll get worse, but hopefully I'll be asleep by that point.”
“Right, well, I think that's enough excitement for one evening!” Lockhart said shakily. “Off to bed now, everyone.”
“Like what?” Draco shook his head. “Whatever. I don't think they'd normally come here. I mean, they didn't after any of the other attacks. I think Dumbledore sort of runs this place however he wants to, I don't think the Ministry has much to do with it.”
He could hear Blaise telling the others about the latest girl he was seeing. Apparently they'd almost gotten caught snogging by Filch the night before. Harry didn't take much notice when the laughter suddenly died, figuring the others must have gone out into the common room.
The rest of August was less eventful than their trip to Diagon Alley. Harry and Draco spent most of it playing Quidditch or hanging out in Draco's room. Harry had started trying to teach Parseltongue to Draco, but it was slow going, and all he'd learnt so far were the most basic phrases. Mrs Malfoy took them out to lunch a few times, and one night, they visited Stonehenge. It was the first time Harry had ever been to a national monument, and he couldn't hide his excitement.
Harry stared at her. “After seeing that? No thanks. You'd beat me in four moves! Besides, I know how much Draco has missed this. And I have a stack of mail to go through.”
Harry got his Walkman out and finished that week's assigned reading as he waited for his friends to wake up. He wasn't sure how much he took in though, as he couldn't get the image of that Hufflepuff's face out of his mind. Finch-Fletchley, Snape had called him. Harry sighed and put away his books and Walkman when the others started to wake up.
“Harry, I...” Draco stopped, looking upset. Behind them, the goblin cleared his throat impatiently, and they scrambled to get back into the cart. They hurtled back up to the main hall, where Harry made sure to exchange some of his coins into Muggle money. He wanted to have some money for next summer.
“Precisely. The dragon bone must be ground until it is the consistency of fine ash. Which is what you'll be doing now.”
“Wow.” Harry put the box carefully back on his bed before launching himself onto Draco's, sending piles of presents flying onto the floor as he hugged him. “Thanks Draco!”
What he had been expecting to be a small back room was instead a large, well-lit store. It was easily as big as the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and filled with neatly ordered clothing. Jeans and t-shirts took up as much floor space as the full wizard robes did, and mannequins were displaying a mixture of both styles of clothing. Shoes of all sorts covered one wall, and there were accessories and pyjamas as well.
Hermione's response was drowned out by the entrance of the rest of the Slytherin team, who were bearing a pile of sweets clearly pilfered from the kitchens.
“That Parselmouth book isn't very long because there haven't been many of you,” Draco explained. “But the snake book looks at every species of snake, both magical and non-magical. And there's a section at the back that lists their uses in potions, and –”
Harry ignored the look Madam Pince gave him as he entered the library and focused on the students sitting in groups at the study tables. There was a group of Hufflepuffs sitting at one in the back, and Harry was heading towards them when he caught part of their conversation. He ducked into the row of books next to him and listened in.
Harry stared at him as he left and shut the door quietly, before turning to the clothes and shrugging and picking up a pair of jeans.
“Should we get his wand back?” Harry whispered. Two pixies still in a body-bind were clutching the wand between them.
At Hooch's whistle the teams soared into the air, where it quickly became obvious that the Slytherin team had vastly superior brooms. Harry flew a quick lap around the pitch, waving at his friends who were, as usual, easily identified by the small patch of red in the Slytherin stand. He'd just swung his broom around to focus on searching for the Snitch when a Bludger went rocketing by him. He shot forward, only for the Bludger to swing around and come back at him as it began to rain.
Lockhart shook his sleeves back with a flourish. He pointed his wand at Harry's arm, and a second later Harry felt one of the weirdest sensations of his life. Before his eyes, his arm shrank in on itself, until it resembled nothing so much as a large, flesh coloured noodle. He dimly noticed Colin snapping more pictures before he passed out again.
Harry frowned. In his opinion, the magical world was far too fond of not naming its villains, which made things all the more complicated.
“Ah, there you are. Come in, come in,” Lockhart said, opening the door. “You'll think twice before you mess with pixies now, won't you?”
He found Draco sitting there, clearly bored as he watched Vince and Greg shovelling pudding into their mouths. “God, can we go? These two haven't said a word for ten minutes.”
They walked into a cramped hallway. Ainsley squeezed past them, unlocked a door and held it open for them. The Malfoys disappeared inside, clearly used to this routine. Harry followed and stopped on the threshold.
Mrs Malfoy was still tense, but smiled down at him. “Thank you. And no, it wasn't true. While I do have a lot of friends in the Ministry, I would be arrested if I raised my wand against the Muggles, except for self-defence. But I didn't feel the need to tell them that.”
“It was in me third year, that the Chamber got opened and I was expelled for it,” Hagrid said quietly. “They snapped me wand and I had no where ter go – me dad died the year before – but Dumbledore arranged for me to stay on and become gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”
“I'm not going anywhere! And you're going to stop trying to make me, or I'm writing to Mr Malfoy.” Harry glared stubbornly at the elf, once again hoping he wouldn't call his bluff.
“Break it up there, gents,” he said, and then pulled the two men apart. Both of them were dishevelled; Mr Malfoy had a cut over one eye, and Mr Weasley had a split lip. Mr Malfoy was still holding the book he'd grabbed out of the cauldron.
“Next time you find an object that, like the diary, appears to have unusual magic, bring it to me so that I may determine its safety. I promise I'll return it to you if it's safe.”
They straightened their clothes and walked through the empty common room. The school was eerily quiet as they made their way to the Great Hall, when Harry stopped suddenly.
Tracey led Harry to the corridor that housed the girls' dormitories. He'd never been down here before, and got some strange looks from a group of older girls they passed.
“She did? Well, then you can't blame me for doing the same, it must be genetic,” Harry said with a grin.
“But Potter's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear,” the redhead said. “How can he be bad if he did that? Plus he isn't a pure-blood.”
Harry groaned. “It's hard enough teaching Draco. Besides, I'm always telling you and Tracey about Muggle stuff.”
As soon as Harry knocked on the door Fang started his usual wild barking, and Draco's expression relaxed slightly. Hagrid opened the door with one hand holding back Fang by his collar. “Hullo you two. Want a cuppa?”
Harry bristled with annoyance as Mr Weasley came over. “Boys! Ginny! What are you doing? It's mad in here, let's go outside.”
Draco raised his head. “No, actually, we've to ask you what really happened, because neither Harry nor myself believed what my father wrote. But now most people think Harry's the heir of Slytherin, so we want to know as much as we can about the Chamber, and the monster.”
“Please, Harry. I'm taking lots of pictures of Hogwarts for my dad, and I know he'd love a signed photo of Harry Potter,” Colin pleaded.
His message delivered, the dwarf got off Harry and set off to find his next victim as the crowd laughed. Harry gave a weak chuckle as he gathered up the rest of his things and rejoined his housemates. He noticed vaguely there was something strange about the diary, but couldn't think what. Draco took a look at his face and glared over at the line of first years.
“Ah, excellent! A bit of house rivalry, how about that?” Lockhart chuckled as he waved the two boys on stage. Harry smiled apologetically at Hermione and Neville as he climbed the short flight of stairs to face off against Ron.
Snape nodded. “I realise it is beyond anything you have brewed so far, being assigned to third years, but I thought your skills might benefit from the challenge. In addition, having an extra set of hands will free up my own time.”
Harry looked at the ingredients. “Er... The salamander scales and peppercorn together can melt weaker metal at high temperatures?”
“Yeah, fine. I never want to go through that again, though,” Harry replied. Blaise grimaced in sympathy.
Harry huffed in frustration as he tried to remain calm. “Look, I don't want to – to hurt him, or anything, alright? I just wanted to tell him that I told the snake
The next morning, Harry was woken up by someone calling his name. He reached out blindly for his glasses and put them on, blinking down at the house-elf by his bed before he remembered where he was.
“Yeah, okay. But still, I changed my mind about him pretty quickly. This guy just seems like a massive wanker.”
When he was a couple of metres off the ground the Snitch levelled out, and Harry forced his broom after it, grimacing through the pain. He pulled his left hand reluctantly off his now slippery broom handle and reached for the Snitch. As his hand closed over its fluttering wings, he over-balanced and he went tumbling forward. There was a fresh, bright stab of pain through his arm as he hit the ground, and then he passed out.
The next morning, Uncle Vernon arranged for a man to come out and install bars across Harry's window. He put in a cat flap on Harry's door himself, and Aunt Petunia pushed his lunch – a cold can of soup – inside for him. Harry gave Hedwig the few bits of meat in it, ignoring her glare, and drank the liquid in one go, grimacing.
“It's been opened before?” Harry held his jug out of Dobby's reach. “Okay, so you can't say anything about that. Fine. Do you know who opened it?”
“Oh, Harry, I do hope you're thinking of buying that one, it suits you so well,” she gushed, then came into the room.
“No, I should have thought before I said something like that when your dad could hear me,” Harry replied.
“Dobby thought that if Harry Potter thought he had no friends, then Harry Potter wouldn't want to go back to Hogwarts.” Dobby's tone made it clear that he thought this a very straight forward concept.
Draco looked at him and switched the earphone to the ear further away from Harry. “They're... They're good. Although it is entirely unnatural to have the music playing inside my ear.”
Harry stopped himself from rolling his eyes with some effort. “Well, I was wondering if anything was going to happen with the complaint I made about Professor Lockhart.”
Harry followed the elf as she led the way down the corridor, down the stairs and through the foyer. As they walked down the corridor where the Malfoys had their studies, Harry noticed that Mr Malfoy's study had light coming from under the door, and resolved to be extra quiet on his return trip. He really didn't want to see the man alone at this time of night.
photo of Harry and Lockhart was stuck to the wall next to every bed, with an enlarged version next to Harry's bed. As he watched, photo Harry elbowed Lockhart in the side and darted out of frame.
A few minutes later they were sheltered behind a rock overlooking the lake. Draco was busy pulling a picnic large enough for ten people out of a sack from the kitchen. Harry looked at Hermione expectantly.
“And you decided the quickest way from the dungeons to the Great Hall was via the second floor?” McGonagall asked sceptically.
“For fuck's sake!” Flint strode forward and grabbed them, pulling them to the front of the crowd. “You can't bet on yourselves, obviously, but you can place a bet on anyone else you like. Or, you know, tell us if it's one of you.”
“Love you too, Mother,” Draco replied. His face was red when she eventually released him, but he looked pleased all the same.
“Aqua vitae,” he said to the stone wall. It didn't move. “Aqua vitae!” The wall continued to act like, well, a stone wall. He'd forgotten to check the new password before he left the common room that morning. “Great. That's just fucking great,” he said angrily. “Er... Green and silver? Er... Cunning and ambition? Merlin. Salazar. Slytherin's monster.” The wall stayed shut. “
Harry wandered back into his dorm and found everyone else still asleep. He frowned at them blearily before he remembered it was Sunday. “Because yesterday was Quidditch. And after the match we had a party. Didn't we?” Harry trailed off as he realised he couldn't even remember the outcome of the match. They'd played Ravenclaw, that much he was sure of. “What's wrong with me?” he muttered.
“After I wrote back to my father,” Draco spat the word, “telling him Hagrid was innocent, it seems he was displeased. He's pressured the Minister for Magic into arresting Hagrid. He's taken him to Azkaban.”
“You are not responsible for what Riddle made you do. The headmaster said as much, and neither the Minister nor the Aurors said anything about holding you responsible.”
He stepped onto the path and looked for the grass snake he'd seen the day before. Sure enough, it was lying on the ground next to the path. There were at least ten other snakes scattered over the lawn. “
“Well, I suggest you start,” Hermione said briskly. “One way or another, the two of you need to sort this out, before it ruins your friendship.”
Snape took his bag off his shoulder and levitated the diary onto McGonagall's desk. “By means of this diary. I am unsure how, but Riddle was draining Harry's life force and using it to become corporeal once more.”
“Yes, sir. When I told Hermione that you'd told me a bit about my mum, she borrowed every book that mentioned both me and Voldemort. It was little creepy, to be honest.”
“But then they'll just get out again,” Millicent objected. “Hitting them was fun, but I've got better things to do with my time.”
“It could be worse,” Draco said. “We didn't lose any house points. And we could have separate detentions with him.”
“Got some final tests after breakfast, but I should be,” Harry said, spooning his porridge in quickly as Pomfrey came bustling over.
.” He didn't actually know if that was true or not, but he didn't think the Dursleys would be very pleased if their orderly garden was overrun with them.
Hermione was busy telling Draco and Neville about her family's holiday to France. Harry was only half paying attention to her, as he was watching the busy corridor outside their compartment. He'd watched Daphne pounce on Stephen and drag him off somewhere, and Theo and Blaise had just walked out of Flint's compartment clutching a large bag of gold. They'd won the betting pool and were laughing as they discussed their plans for the money. Harry gave them an amused smile before he caught sight of a flash of red.
Harry picked up Hagrid's tin of fudge from the fireplace. “Now who's being paranoid?” he asked as he popped some fudge into his mouth. “Just face it: Hufflepuff has defences that we don't. And from what Neville's told me, Gryffindor's the same as Slytherin. Besides, you won the bet yesterday with Kettleburn.”
Harry was slightly calmer as he walked off down the corridor. He shivered; there was a broken window and an icy breeze was blowing down the corridor. Most of the torches had been blown out, and in the gloom Harry tripped over something. He rolled over to look at what he'd tripped over and froze.
The corner of Snape's mouth twitched. “I would advise you to simply weigh up the situation. Is socialising with Miss Granger worth running the risk of being Petrified?”
“I'll make it, I've done it a hundred times, I could brew a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep,” Lockhart announced.
“Go yell at Vince and Greg. At least our bet has some chance of being true,” Blaise said dismissively.
It was slow going at first, leaving the Chamber, but Harry's strength was quickly returning. By the time they walked out into a roughly hewn tunnel he felt almost back to normal, if a little tired. He gasped and stumbled as they turned a corner and saw a large shape lying across the tunnel.
“I can see that you've all bought the complete collection of my books. Excellent! I thought we'd start the class with a little quiz. Nothing stressful; I just want to know how closely you read my books, how well you remember my exploits!” He handed them all a quiz paper. “Your thirty minutes start now!”
Harry nodded again, then settled down to watch them play chess, idly flipping through his book. Finally, Mrs Malfoy looked up at the clock.
She scanned his face before giving a small nod and hugging Harry. “And Harry, I'm so glad you're all right. I'm sorry my husband's actions endangered you like that.”
They found Mrs Malfoy waiting impatiently with Dobby standing beside her. “Draco! Oh, darling, I've been so worried about you,” Mrs Malfoy cried as she enveloped him in a tight hug.
Draco led him into a large dining room. There was a marble fireplace along one wall, and a long table that could have easily seated twenty people. There were four places set at one end of the table. As Draco and Harry took their seats on one side, a house-elf popped up beside them and poured them each a goblet of iced water before disappearing again.
Hagrid shook his head. “Nah. All I know is, whatever it was, Aragog was dead scared of it. He wouldn't tell me what it was.”
Draco rolled his eyes and took a seat behind the white pieces. “You're forgetting that I managed to beat McGonagall's chessmen. That should count for something.”
They followed the confused crowd back to the castle. They'd just reached the top of the stairs when Snape came stalking across the Entrance Hall. “Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, come with me,” he said with an odd twist to his mouth.
Harry pulled the door open and stepped inside, with Draco right behind him. They found themselves in a bathroom. A girls' bathroom, to judge from the lack of urinals. It was dark and gloomy; it looked like the walls had been drenched in water, extinguishing the candles.
The door to the office slammed open, and Mr Malfoy strode in with a bandaged Dobby at his heels. He faltered slightly when he saw the Minister for Magic, but recovered to glare at Dumbledore. He took no notice of Draco. “So, Dumbledore, you're back, even though your suspension still stands.”
Ginny shrugged. “It's okay. It's good to talk to someone else who knows what it was like. These two have been treating me like I'm made of glass.”
“Now is not the time; I need to get you to McGonagall. Say 'close' in Parseltongue,” Snape ordered, as Draco shoved the Cloak into his pocket. When Harry did so, he spun around in time to see the hole they'd emerged from close up as it was replaced by a sink.
One evening in January, Harry and Draco were standing under the Invisibility Cloak outside the Ravenclaw entrance. After the debacle getting into the Hufflepuff basement, Draco had insisted they research Ravenclaw before attempting to get in. They'd followed Morag and Padma after dinner, and the two girls were currently standing before a door with no handle. There was a bronze knocker shaped like an eagle in the centre of the door.
Snape opened the door and looked down at them and frowned. “Madam Pomfrey hasn't sent you here for a pain potion, has she?” At Harry's confused look, he continued. “For your arm, Mr Potter.”
“One moment, Minerva,” Snape replied. He guided Harry and Draco to the empty chairs in front of McGonagall's desk and gave Harry a glass of water off McGonagall's desk. “Drink it all, slowly,” he said, then turned back to the assembled adults. “It was actually Mr Malfoy here who figured it all out and came to me.”
“Yes. Our new Defence teacher must be a fan, I guess. I just hope they have enough copies left,” said Draco.
In the end Harry took Burbage, while Draco went for Kettleburn. “You'd want to get drunk if you were missing an arm, wouldn't you.”
“No, I don't want to scare him off. It's going to be hard enough by myself, I think,” Harry said as he stood up.
“If Harry writes one word to my son that he has been mistreated as he has this summer, I shall return, and I shan't be nearly as pleasant as I have been today. I will likewise return if Draco writes to Harry and does not receive an answer from Harry. Believe me when I say I am quite capable of making each of your lives as miserable as you have made Harry's. Believe me also when I say I have many powerful friends in high places, and I am not afraid of reprisal for anything I may do to you.”
Even Vince and Greg looked a little unnerved at the attention. “Is this because of the snake thing?” Greg asked.
Mrs Malfoy just smiled and walked out, shutting the door quietly. Harry immediately dived onto his bed and rummaged around until he found his headphones. He quickly pressed play and grinned when the music started as normal, before returning to his shopping.
Harry nodded once and left fuming, giving Hagrid a quick, grimace-like smile as he passed him on the stairs. He was late for Charms now, but didn't feel like going to class. Figuring he could always tell Flitwick that he'd been held up by Dumbledore, he headed straight for the Slytherin common room. There were a few students out in the corridors at this time, and they all shied away from him as he passed, doing nothing to improve his mood.
Harry watched him for a second, wondering just how one person could get so many things. His thoughts were interrupted by Hedwig flying into the room with a small envelope clutched in her beak.
Harry let out a groan and went to leave, before whirling back around. “You know, I just realised why none of you were sorted into Ravenclaw. You're all bloody idiots.” Ernie opened his mouth to argue back, but Harry raised his voice. “Yeah, I made Voldemort disappear somehow. I don't know how, because I was a fucking
The grounds were covered in snow, and they chose to give a wide berth to a group having a snowball fight. As they curved their way around to Hagrid's cabin, they could see smoke rising from the chimney.
“Silence, Peeves!” McGonagall snapped, and the poltergeist flew away backwards, sticking his tongue out at Harry.
Draco spent all of Herbology ignoring Harry, despite the fact that they were working at the same workbench, and would only talk to Daphne or Tracey. As soon as the lunch bell rang, Harry took off for the castle, and was able to snag Hermione as she and Neville were making their way to the Great Hall.
“Er, okay.” Harry had never given much thought to what colours suited him. He was mostly happy when Dudley's hand downs were only six sizes too big instead of ten.
Dumbledore nodded. “Very well then. Mr Malfoy, I hereby award you one hundred points for the bravery and loyalty you have shown tonight. You and Professor Snape will both receive a Special Award for Services to the School, and – ah.”
Colin produced a camera from his bag. “I've heard all about you, how you defeated You-Know-Who when you were a baby, and I was hoping I could get a photo with you, to prove that I met you. A boy in my dorm told me that if I develop the film in a special potion, the picture will
Made of grey stone, the house that loomed at the end of the drive was the largest Harry had ever seen. The double-storeyed front doors opened by themselves to show a large marble foyer. Harry didn't have a chance to have a look as Draco was impatiently pulling him up the wide staircase. He dragged Harry down a dimly lit hallway. Its walls were lined with portraits of pale faced blondes who murmured as the two boys rushed past. Finally Draco slowed to a stop.
He disappeared inside the shed, emerging a minute later clutching his broomstick and a small trunk. “Ready to lose?”
“What? Of course I do! I have to go to school. And it's more of a home than this place could ever be,” Harry said, bewildered.
Harry entered a little cautiously. He'd never been in a girl's bedroom before, and he wasn't sure what he was expecting. To his surprise, he found the room to be pretty much the same as the boys' dorm, except with only four beds. And a little better smelling, if he was honest.
Harry looked around in confusion, to see most people looking at him with similar expressions. Hermione looked betrayed as well as confused, as did his Slytherin friends. In fact, only Draco looked normal; he had a wide smirk on his face as he watched Snape vanish the snake.
“Of course I did, you prat. You should have seen your face! Of course, you'll get to see it tomorrow in the
” he quickly added, laughing nervously. He watched the snake to make sure it wasn't going to attack Ron, before smiling at the Hufflepuff boy. Instead of the relief he expected to see, he was faced with a terrified confusion.
Draco shook his head as he stood up. “She came over and told me she's spending time with the Weasley girl. Apparently they've become friendly this past week.”
Draco snagged the letter off Thoth's leg and stroked him distractedly as he stared at Harry. “You don't think Snape set you up, do you? I mean, yesterday you as good as told him we've snuck into Gryffindor, and now when we try getting into Hufflepuff we get drenched in vinegar...”
Harry had just pulled a black jumper over his head when there was a soft knock on the door. He opened it to find Mrs Malfoy smiling down at him. Her smile widened when she saw his outfit.
Hagrid waved back. “Alright there, Harry?” A small boy next to him whipped his head around and stared at Harry.
“Oh, no. Master Draco doesn't know Dobby is here, sir. Dobby will have to punish himself when he returns home for coming here.”
They all followed his gaze to the staff table, where Lockhart – now with a full head of hair again – was blithely reading what looked like fan mail, and nodded. Things could have been much worse.
When they walked in to the lounge, they found Mrs Malfoy staring into the fire, the chess board set up before her, and Mr Malfoy flipping through Harry's snake encyclopaedia. Draco took his seat across the board from his mother, leaving Harry to sit awkwardly next to Mr Malfoy.
Dumbledore sighed. “Thank you, Cornelius. I'll walk you to the gates; I need to talk to you about releasing Hagrid. Severus, if you'd bring your students to the feast?”
Out in the corridor Millicent kicked the ground angrily. “Detention with that dickhead! What a nightmare.”
Harry rolled his eyes and reached for the last parcel. “I'm sure I'm going to like yours just as much.”
He didn't think he could have imagined a place that they were less likely to shop at. The clothes inside were outdated and crushed messily onto the shelves and hangers, with no organisational system he could figure out. There was also a pervading smell of mothballs. He frowned and moved closer to Draco as Mrs Malfoy stood in front of the dingy counter.
Some of the tension left Snape, and he gave a small smile. “I'm pleased to hear it. One final matter, Mr Potter.”
Harry swayed a little as he read the words and Draco grabbed his waist to steady him. “Holy shit,” Harry said quietly.
Finally, Snape seemed satisfied, and returned to his seat. “You seem perfectly fine to me. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that the... Emotional stress of the day has simply exhausted you. I suggest the both of you go straight to bed, and if anyone asks, stick to your story about the Astronomy Tower.”
Classes that day were a complete write off, as all anyone could talk about was the prospect of finally finding out who had been attacking everyone. The betting in the Slytherin common room had reached fever pitch. Oddly enough, Harry and Draco were no longer favourites, as most people figured they wouldn't have attacked Hermione. Lockhart was now the front runner, given the inappropriately cheery mood he'd maintained throughout the entire ordeal. Harry became disgusted with the whole thing, and retreated to his bed, planning on telling Tom about the impending revelation.
Daphne rolled her eyes. “You know you look good. But now Harry does too, and I wanted to give him some positive reinforcement.”
Harry nodded. “Tom was a memory, sir. He'd preserved himself in the diary somehow. During the year, Ginny Weasley then myself wrote in the diary. He used it to gain strength from us, and at the same time, possessed us. It's us who have been opening the Chamber. I'm the reason Hermione was hurt.”
At eight o'clock that night the second year Slytherins made their way to the Great Hall in a group, talking excitedly about the Duelling Club.
“Perhaps by sleeping the night before, instead of wandering around the castle after curfew,” Snape said pointedly before moving down the table.
Draco sighed. “Potter, you're the Boy-Who-Lived. Why do you think Fudge and those Aurors came to the school? Because it would've been a disaster for the Ministry if you'd actually died.”
Harry looked past Draco to see a tall blonde woman standing there. He'd seen her once before, from  a distance. Close up, there was a strong resemblance to Draco, though her eyes were blue rather than grey. She was wearing an elegant Muggle dress that Harry would bet cost more than anything Aunt Petunia owned, and had her wand out.
Snape stood there with a stack of schedules, which he started handing out. “Mr Potter. Managing to keep out of the paper today, I see.”
“What, and ask him if he's fallen back into his old habits of setting killer monsters loose in the school?”
Hermione glared at his back before turning to Harry in mute appeal. He raised his eyebrows unhelpfully and followed Draco.
“Ah.” Dumbledore studied him in silence for a minute. “Well, Harry, there isn't anything we can do about that.”
“Yes, that's the exact impression I got when you ignored us for two hours,” Draco said sarcastically.
“Flint's yelling at Wood right now, he's convinced the Gryffindor team did it,” Gemma said as she sat next to Hermione.
Draco let out a frustrated sigh. “I'm trying to write down the Parseltongue I know, since it's hard to just remember it all. I've been writing it down phonetically, I guess you could say, but I think I need to make up some new letters, because some of the sounds don't really fit any of ours.”
“Ah, you three look like you know what you're doing. Just pop them back in the cage, then,” he said, and closed the door behind him.
Harry jerked his hand back as if he'd been burnt. “Sorry, sir,” he said, blushing when he saw Theo staring at him. He picked up his knife, but it was no use. He was acutely aware of Draco's presence next to him, even though they hadn't spoken all lesson. For the first time, Harry left Potions class feeling certain he'd failed to brew something correctly.
entrance isn't booby-trapped, but Hufflepuff's is? In what universe does that make sense? They're Hufflepuffs!”
Draco shrugged. “No, she acts the same when I'm talking about Hermione as when I'm talking about one of our Slytherin friends. And she was quite impressed by her solving Snape's potion puzzle last year. It just depends on which one of them will be taking us to Diagon Alley this year.”
“I think he must have been coming to visit Potter. There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” McGonagall said.
“Now then! In my class you will come face to face with some of the most evil and terrifying creatures that roam the earth. But I assure you, no harm can come to you while I'm in the room! Just remain calm; screaming may provoke them.”
“What terrible planning. You would think they would wait until the Hogwarts rush is over, considering most students buy their books here,” grumbled Draco as they squeezed inside.
“Well use your bloody brains, why don't you?” Harry snapped. “The snake was about to attack him before I spoke to it, and then it immediately stopped. It shouldn't be that hard to work out!”
“Right, okay, Ginny,” Harry nodded. “Draco's pissed at me because of her, or something. I don't know.”
“Oh, no, sir. I'm actually here to...” Harry glanced at Draco who nodded slightly. “I'd like to make a formal complaint about Lockhart.”
“Can we not talk about this right now? It's the first day of holidays, and we've arrived with good music and sweets to save you from a tower full of Weasleys,” Harry said firmly.
Harry didn't see either of them in the common room, so wandered into the dorm. Theo was reading on his bed. Harry noted with amusement that the clipping of himself and Lockhart had been taken down from beside Theo's bed.
Back in his room, Harry stared at his trunk in dismay. True, he loved his new clothes, but he hadn't thought of how he was going to fit them all in his trunk. And the Lockhart books took up more room than the rest of his books combined. Sighing, he started gathering all his things and putting them on his bed in neat piles.
“But – why'd you take so long to buy nice clothes? And there are so many things you don't have that you should buy!”
The mood in the school had begun to lighten slightly as the weather slowly warmed. There had been no further attacks – something for which Lockhart took full credit – and the Mandrakes were close to being ready to harvest. Apart from Peeves, whose song “Oh Potter, you rotter” now came with a dance routine, most people had lessened in their suspicions of Harry. Padma even helped him with his shearing technique one Herbology lesson.
Breakfast the next day was a subdued affair as the entire school discussed the latest attacks. Up at the staff table the teachers were all clustered in twos and threes over copies of the
“It would be incredibly boring for you. The only reason you could possibly have to take that class would be to get easy marks,” Draco said dismissively. Pansy nodded her agreement.
“Yeah, I guess. Look, I need to get my Charms book for next period, but I'll come down for tea on the weekend. I'll bring Draco and Hermione, too.”
Harry looked up to see the Weasley twins standing in the doorway. They were looking at Harry and Draco suspiciously.
They fell silent as they reached the top of the staircase. “Tiddlywinks,” said Hermione, then stepped through the now open portrait hole.
Finally, on the last night, everyone sat down for one last dinner. Harry had grown used to the fancy food the Malfoys liked to eat, and was happy to see that quail was being served, as it was one of his new favourites.
Harry exchanged an incredulous look with Draco. In the row in front of them, Theo was muttering to Tracey.
Harry looked between the two men who were glaring daggers at each other, then turned to Draco and gave him a questioning look. Draco frowned slightly and shook his head as his father pulled an old schoolbook out of the Weasley girl's cauldron.
Draco smirked. “She is rather fierce when she's cross, isn't she? You should have seen her when my father said he wanted to send me abroad for school, instead of Hogwarts.”
Draco sniggered. “Trust Hermione to sneak two boys into her bedroom and then want to solve mysteries.”
“That's one way. You can also Apparate here, but you have to be quick, as there's naturally a lot of traffic,” Mrs Malfoy replied.
“Just a friendly warning, Harry, that it's not a good look to go handing out signed photos to your fellow students. Makes you look a trifle conceited.”
Draco kissed his mother goodnight, then he and Harry did a final check in the room for any forgotten possessions. Harry picked up his book, but Mrs Malfoy hesitated before handing over the drawing to Draco and sighing.
Business done, Ainsley escorted them back into the Muggle store in front, before bowing them onto the street.
“Very well. Oh, and Mr Potter, give this to Flint when you see him,” Snape said, and handed over a piece of parchment. “Good night.”
Harry read the letter and gulped. It was from the Improper Use of Magic Office at the Ministry, and clearly stated underage wizards shouldn't do magic outside of school. Shit.
Dumbledore gazed at Harry and Draco before nodding. “Of course, Severus. Argus, come and have a drink in the staffroom...”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You have no idea. Draco's mad at me now, and I don't know why. Something to do with the Weasley girl, I think.”
“Isn't that a good thing?” Harry asked in confusion. He liked his new gloves; they were dark green and very soft.
to attack him last night. You were all there, you saw the snake lie down and leave him alone after I spoke to it!”
“And all of Lockhart's possessions should be sinking beneath the surface of the Black Lake as we speak,” Draco said smugly.
“But he's the one who let the pixies loose and then left it up to us to catch them again!” Draco sulked.
“Nothing of the sort,” Narcissa replied. “I don't have long. My husband's going on trial for attempted murder, you see, and I have much to do.”
Finally, Mr Malfoy departed for his study, and Mrs Malfoy rose as well. “Darling, I thought we might take a trip to Amesbury tomorrow, so make sure you're up at a reasonable hour, please. Good night.”
“No need for that, no indeed. Come through, come through.” Ainsley recovered his composure and held open the curtain for them.
Tilly beamed at him. “It is being Tilly's pleasure to serve Harry Potter!” She looked at Draco, and when he didn't give her any orders, disappeared with a soft crack.
Harry grinned and returned to prising fudge out of the tin, when the sound of Draco swearing made him look up. “What's wrong?”
Flitwick ignored his two colleagues and beamed at Harry. “It's so nice to see students interested in learning. You must have a flair for Potions for Professor Snape to spend extra time with you. It's not something he does often.”
Harry grabbed one, feeling a slight pang of guilt over abandoning his old broom so easily. Still, the new model was a better flier, and any advantage helped.
“Indeed. But the point I wished to make was that Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth; that's why the emblem of Slytherin House is a serpent.”
“Excellent!” Harry quickly settled himself next to Draco and they had breakfast before turning to the mail.
The rest of his response was cut off as Harry launched himself at him, hugging him fiercely. “Thank god you're here!”
Snape gave a dismissive glance at the other end of the stage. “If you can disarm Mr Malfoy you can do the same to Mr Weasley.”
They'd Apparated into a clump of trees in a small park. They straightened up their clothes and quickly left the park. Mrs Malfoy strolled alongside them as Draco pointed out various shops to Harry.
“Towler. Fourth year, I think. Weedy sort of kid. Lighter than McLaggen but doesn't look that confident, so you'll have no trouble with him. Now, it looks like a storm's coming, so let's make this a quick one, all right?”
“No! I can see the Snitch!” Harry ground out, and yanked his broom down with his left arm. Cradling his right arm towards his body he dove after the Snitch. Luckily the Gryffindor Seeker hadn't seen it, as Harry didn't think he could handle a race for the Snitch with a broken arm.
Harry tried to push himself up, but was still too weak to do so. Snape clasped his hand and pulled him to his feet, grabbing him by the shoulders as he swayed slightly.
Harry groaned a little, as now he was awake he realised how cold it was, despite the fireplaces being lit. As he scrambled to get into his dressing gown and slippers, Draco went to wake up Vince and Greg. By the time Harry had warmed up a bit, Draco was sitting back on his own bed ripping open the first of a very large pile of presents.
“Er, well, Draco's dad sent him a letter saying that you got blamed for it last time,” Harry said, wincing a bit.
“Mother has some salve that will get rid of them, don't worry,” Draco assured Harry when he showed him his stomach.
“It wasn't him, Headmaster! I was with him just before the attack, he had no time to do it!” Hagrid yelled. Dumbledore raised his hand, but Hagrid continued ranting over him. “And he
“Professor!” Harry stared at his teacher in shock. Along with his own and Harry's wands, he was carrying a large mirror.
If Harry had thought the Green Bedroom was large, that was only because he hadn't yet seen Draco's. Located next to Harry's, it was even bigger than their dormitory at Hogwarts. Harry stared in awe. There was a large four poster bed against one wall, covered with silvery-blue bedding and a mound of pillows. Like the Green Bedroom, there were two doors on the opposite wall, and two large bay windows looking out over the grounds. Bookshelves ran along one wall, and there were more shelves covered with toys and ornaments between the bathroom and closet doors. Harry grinned when he saw that the white crown Draco had taken from the chess match had pride of place. But what really grabbed his attention as he stepped onto the grey carpet was the wall behind Draco's bed.
When they walked through the gates, Harry felt a hand grab his upper arm, and a second later came the horrible twisting crush of Apparition. They reappeared in an alcove in the Leaky Cauldron. Mr Malfoy handed Draco a bag of coins. “I've errands to run. I'll meet you two at Flourish and Blotts in two hours.”
Harry walked over and picked it up. It showed the three of them sitting by the lake laughing at something. As he watched, he saw himself throw a bread roll at Draco, who then tackled him to the ground as Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry watched the full loop a couple of times before putting the frame back down.
"Be that as it may, I'm sure you have grasped the implications of this evening's events,” Snape said.
Hagrid released Fang after he shut the door and went to put the kettle on. “What brings you two here? Thought you'd've bin up in the castle stuffin' yer faces with Christmas goodies.”
He pushed open a door, and the room within lit up at once. Harry's first thought was that the room was very aptly named. A pale green rug covered most of the hardwood floor. The wooden furniture was pale as well, and the bed and armchairs were covered with a matching pale green fabric. Darker green drapes were pulled open on the windows, which showed the vast gardens outside.
Mrs Malfoy glared at the Dursleys as they took in her words, then put her hand on Draco's shoulder. “Come along, boys. The sooner we're out of this place, the better.”
“I discovered that the Dark Lord was targeting your family. I couldn't stand by as he went after the one true friend I'd had, and so I went to Dumbledore that night to warn him,” Snape replied.
Hagrid shook his head. “Aragog escaped into the forest, and the attacks stopped, so that was that. I was lucky I got off with just being expelled and not sent to Azkaban, so I didn't wanna make too much of a fuss. And Aragog was happier in the Forbidden Forest than the castle.”
“Stay there, Mr Weasley, I'll get rid of it,” Snape said idly. It was clear he was enjoying the look on Ron's face as he stared at the snake.
Suddenly the knocker came to life. “I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. What am I?”
“Because it's Draco!” When he was met with two blank expressions, Harry went on. “He's used to getting what he wants. If he liked me, he would have said something.”
Mrs Malfoy nodded thoughtfully. “Yes, I remember that painting. You should cultivate that friendship, Harry. The portraits at Hogwarts can be very helpful if you wish to learn more about the castle and its inhabitants.”
They chatted about Stonehenge for a while. According to Draco, it was a source of powerful magic, but difficult to harness for most wizards.
am the Potions master at this school,” Snape said venomously. Lockhart gulped slightly as Snape turned to Dumbledore. “If there's nothing further, I'd like to escort my students back to the dungeons.”
There was a beat of silence as the entire Gryffindor team turned to look at Harry. It was broken by Gemma.
“Good, 'cause this really hurts. Though it's still better than being locked in my room,” Harry mused.
“I don't know, Wood's pretty hot,” Gemma replied. She looked up in the following silence. “Ugh. I hate being the only girl here sometimes.”
so much as we might not need to as often. Still, we should go up sometime this week to find out what their next password will be; no point losing that knowledge. But perhaps it's time we tried sneaking into one of the other Houses.”
“Do not allow your resentment over the way some students are treating you to drive you to act foolishly,” Snape said sharply.
Mrs Malfoy's face took on a curious expression as she replied. “It was nothing, Harry, really. The clothes those Muggles had forced on you were atrocious. It was about time you got to choose something you like. In fact, when we get home, I'll destroy your old clothes for you, if you like.”
Beside Lockhart, Snape was looking at the new professor with an expression usually reserved for students who melted their cauldrons. Harry and Pansy were still giggling when McGonagall brought in the Sorting Hat. They eventually stopped when Reed glared down the table at them, and they watched the Sorting in silence. Harry found out that the boy who had stared at him at the train station was Colin Creevey. He seemed to be arguing with the hat, and was eventually put into Gryffindor. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and the rest of the feast went by uneventfully.
Mrs Malfoy smiled. “I don't need anything today. We're here for Harry. He needs a full wardrobe, as his existing one is unsuitable for him.”
Peeves was still hanging overhead, grinning at the mayhem. “Oh Potter, you rotter, oh what have you done, you're killing off students, you think it's good fun!”
“No! You're involved in this somehow, aren't you?” Draco demanded. “You – oh! You gave the diary to Weasley, didn't you? That day in Diagon Alley!”
This proved impossible to do during class, given that they were in the front row under Snape's sharp gaze and Hermione was ignoring them in any case. As soon as the bell rang, Draco leant over and grabbed Hermione's bag.
Susan looked a little doubtful, but Ernie shook his head stubbornly. “All we have is your word on it.”
Back in the dorm, Harry pulled out the photo album Hagrid had given him the year before, and sat on his bed with the curtains drawn as he slowly flipped through it. His parents smiled and waved at him from every page, and a pang of loneliness swept over Harry as he stared down at them.
Draco nodded and began to explain about how Harry had been hearing a mysterious voice no one else could, but eventually Draco had heard it too, causing Hermione to rush off to the library. “It was the monster. It was a basilisk. Harry's a Parselmouth, and he's been teaching me over the year.”
The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk as Dumbledore placed the rigid cat down on it. He and McGonagall leaned close as they inspected the cat. Harry shuffled closer to Draco as they stood nervously, with Snape standing close behind them and Filch sobbing in a chair. Lockhart was bragging about how he could have saved the cat if he'd been there in time. Harry tuned him out and watched as Dumbledore and McGonagall completed their inspection.
The boy went bright red, but walked closer. “Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor, although I wanted to be in Slytherin like you, but the hat wouldn't let me.”
“Not really,” said Harry with a wry grin. “Draco mostly kept us safe from the other pieces. Although Hermione got to kill a pawn.”
“That... Makes sense.” Snape started walking back to his office. “Before this evening, had anyone else been aware you're a Parselmouth?"
With a sigh Harry rolled out of bed and started getting dressed. He mustn't have been as quiet as he'd thought, because Draco immediately emerged from his own bed fully dressed.
Theo nodded. “And Snape's deputy. It could be much worse, at least we've got two competent teachers in charge.”
Mr Malfoy picked up his cane and held it so that the snake headed handle was in front of Harry's face.
“But it's a hell of a lot more innocent than what Blaise wanted to do,” Harry replied, causing them all to laugh.
“Because I do not want you using it to visit Miss Granger. I recall your attempting to visit Mr Potter in the infirmary last year, and under no circumstances are you to repeat that behaviour this time.”
Across from them, Pansy grimaced. “She won't shut up about him. I've half a mind to ask Snape for  poison when we get to school.”
Draco had gone pale. “This is from my father. He... He says that Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”
Flitwick and Sinistra carried Justin to the infirmary, but the ghost was a bit more problematic. Eventually, McGonagall conjured up a fan and directed Ernie to use it to blow Nick to the infirmary, leaving her and Harry alone in the corridor.
“My father has a mutual dislike with Mr Weasley,” Draco said. “Apparently, Weasley thinks Father is a Dark wizard, or has Dark artefacts or something, and Father thinks the whole family are blood traitors.”
At a clap of his hands, a dozen grumpy dwarves trudged through the door from the Entrance Hall. Each was wearing a pair of golden wings and carrying a harp. Harry couldn't think of anyone who'd seemed less frolicsome.
The feast went on into the small hours of the morning. It was three o'clock when Dumbledore stood up to announce that Slytherin had won the House Cup again. The cheering of the Slytherins was nothing compared to the cheers that followed the news that Lockhart had quit, or McGonagall's announcement that exams had been cancelled as a school treat.
The Slytherin common room was noisy when they eventually arrived, and Harry quickly walked into their dorm room and stopped.
On the bed was the frozen body of Colin Creevey, with his hands holding his camera in front of his face. Harry bit his lip to keep quiet as McGonagall returned with Pomfrey.
in the well-lit library was quite different from trying to follow a photocopied diagram by torchlight. It didn't help that he didn't have any of the suggested tools. He was making do with some bobby pins and safety pins he'd stolen from the bathroom cabinet.
Harry shrugged. “You're forgetting that I'm the one letting the monster out. It's not going to hurt me.”
“Shh!” Draco glared at him. “And, well, yes, I suppose it would. But don't mention that while we're here, alright? I don't want my father thinking that!”
Snape snorted and walked further into the room. “I simply thought you might want to help me brewing some potions for the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey informs me that her stock of Pepperup Potion is getting low, and flu season is upon us.”
As they trudged down to Herbology, Harry glanced at Draco. “Not that I don't appreciate you standing up for me, but did you have to be so mean to her? You don't know she arranged that.”
Draco looked uncharacteristically unsure of himself, which Harry found oddly endearing. “I was hoping you could teach me.”
Draco grimaced. “They still don't know what happened, by the way. Wood denies touching the Bludger, and you know Gryffindors, they're more likely to just knock you off your broom than do something sneaky like this.”
Draco looked at Dobby in confusion before he turned pink and shot to his feet. “What did you do, Father?”
“I told you that I had preserved my memory in a more lasting method than mere ink. What I didn't tell you was that I've also been slowly draining you of your life force.”
“Yeah. I've already waited a day to let Hermione know I'm free from the Dursleys. I don't want to know what she'd say if I left it much longer.”
Hagrid dropped his arms, causing more feathers to flutter to the ground. “Right, then. I'll, uh, wait outside then.”
“Yep, definitely. And you were brilliant, Mrs Malfoy. Was all that stuff true? Can you really get away with hexing them or something next year?”
Harry looked around him as they waited. Mrs Malfoy's study was a bright, spacious room decorated in white wooden furniture and dark green fabrics. The large windows were opened to let in the summer breeze, and Harry made his way over to them to look out. Draco followed him.
“I understand this may be somewhat distressing,” Snape said quietly. “There has been a further attack. I regret to inform you that Miss Granger has been Petrified.”
“Wizard prison, of course. It's horrible, out on this rock in the middle of the North Sea... I'd rather not talk about it. We're celebrating your freedom, not getting us both depressed. Here, open your presents.”
Harry tried not to let it show as he felt his heart sink. He'd been looking forward to going back to Malfoy Manor for part of the holidays.
Harry put his brush down and straightened his shirt before following Draco out into the hallway. He was suddenly nervous about dinner. While Draco's mother had been perfectly nice to him, he wasn't looking forward to meeting his father. He remembered what Snape had told him about Mr Malfoy's attitude to Muggle-borns and half-bloods, and shivered.
“You're letting them out?” Theo said in disbelief. Beside him, Tracey started shoving her possessions into her bag. Harry nudged Draco, and they started doing the same.
“Learning about my family from library books,” Harry said, then looked down. “I much preferred hearing about Mum from you.”
They obediently let her continue filling in Hermione and Neville. Blaise was telling Harry all about the latest girl he'd been seeing, when he heard someone clearing their throat behind him. He looked up to see Justin Finch-Fletchley standing there.
Just as Harry was about to shove Draco back, Mr Malfoy strode into the foyer, buckling his cloak around his shoulders. “Come along, I want to get this over and done with.”
He was startled when a hand gripped his shoulder and spun him around. He looked into Draco's amused eyes and blushed.
“Learning to pick locks. And I walked, Blaise. Apparently it's easy enough for boys who aren't there to snog the girls.”
“Ignore the last few. People started adding their friends to the list. And obviously the last two entries are completely impossible,” Miles said.
She smiled down at them before clearing her throat. “Better get a move on if you want a good compartment.”
Tracey looked up from studying Harry's work. “Maybe the protective spell reads intentions? Harry's not up to mischief, so it let him in.”
“I wanted to talk to Professor Snape, sir. About tomorrow?” Harry looked at Snape, hoping he hadn't changed his mind.
Hermione snapped back to the present as he broke the silence. “Snape's theory might explain your hearing something on Halloween, but not in Lockhart's office. It's just so odd that Draco didn't hear anything either time.”
A look of distaste flashed across Tom's face. “You cannot imagine how dull it was listening to her. So dramatic and over-wrought, and yet she had nothing of substance to say. Until, that is, she began to write of her infatuation with the famous Harry Potter. She certainly piqued my interest with that.”
Harry set off for Fortescue's, trusting that Draco would follow. He could never resist anything sweet, and Harry thought it was just the thing to snap him out of his sour mood.
He closed the door, went to collapse onto his bed and only just stopped himself from crying out loud. There was a house-elf sitting on it. It was wearing a filthy pillowcase, not at all like the clean liveried pillowcases the Hogwarts elves wore. Looking at its green eyes, Harry realised he hadn't been imagining things at the hedge that morning.
“Isn't he the bloke who wrote almost the entire book list this year?” Harry asked, fishing said list out of his pocket.
“Excellent work, Mr Potter! Ten points to Slytherin! Now, how about something a bit more interesting?” Lockhart smiled at the crowd before turning to Ron.
Sure enough, Draco had perked up by the time they finished their sundaes. “I want to look at Quality Quidditch Supplies. Supposedly, they've got the new Nimbus 2001 in.”
Whatever the spell was, it didn't work. One of the pixies grabbed the wand and got into a tug of war over it with another pixie as sparks shot out the end of it. Millicent had an entire bottle of ink dumped down the neck of her uniform and swore loudly. She stood up, grabbed one of her books and started thumping the pixies with it. By the time the bell rang there was a small pile of unconscious pixies littering the front row.
Draco grinned and launched into a detailed explanation of exactly what a Malfoy bonfire consisted of as Harry sat back in satisfaction. Shopping was marvellous.
Harry ducked out of Lockhart's hold to pick up his bag where he'd dropped it on the floor, and stalked into the Defence room without another word. Luckily, Draco had saved him a seat in the back row. He had no desire to sit anywhere near the front of this class. He slumped down into his seat and glared at his desk.
Harry stared at her. “I don't understand how you're even in that house, they all sound like idiots. I'm so glad the hat decided to put me in Slytherin.”
Harry quickly stood close to Draco as the teachers moved through the crowd. The rest of the second year Slytherins carefully gave Vince and Greg a wide berth, as they'd all seen first hand their clumsy wand-work. Harry winced a little as he saw Hermione pair off with Neville.
Harry took a deep breath. “We really did fall asleep, Professor. And we did intend to go to the feast.”
“Of course, it wasn't just you. I had started the process with the Weasley chit. But then she stopped writing to me, and I worried that I had lost my chance. But then you wrote to me, Harry Potter.”
While the other three walls were painted a pale grey, this one had a large mural on it. It showed a lush green mountain with a forest in the distance. In the foreground was a large pale green dragon. As Harry watched, it lifted its head and stared at him.
“That's good. It can't be fun for Hermione, stuck in that tower. Imagine sharing a room with Patil and Brown.”
“Because I needed to borrow some hairpins off Daphne. If that's okay with you?” Harry asked sarcastically.
Another house-elf popped up next to Mrs Malfoy. “We'll have the elf-made wine, with half-glasses for the boys.”
Harry looked around him curiously as he tried to quash his rising panic. This must be Dumbledore's office. The walls were covered with portraits of previous heads of school, all of whom were currently sleeping in their frames. There were a number of strange instruments around the room, on tables and shelves, and Harry couldn't figure out what any of them might be for. The Sorting Hat was sitting on a shelf behind the desk, but it wasn't moving.
“Yeah. Not the easiest thing, but I'm getting better at teaching. And he's making progress with creating a writing system for it, so he doesn't have to just memorise everything now.”
. They were saying they were hungry, that they wanted to kill, and that they could smell blood. It sounded like it was above us, so we ran up the stairs, and then we found... What we found.”
The basilisk started towards them. Harry scooted back as quick as he could, making sure to keep his face turned away from the basilisk, but his strength was failing quicker now. He was only ten metres away when the basilisk slammed into Tom – and went straight through him.
Flint frowned at them before heading over to Hooch, where they watched him gesticulating angrily at her.
“Likewise, I'm sure,” Mr Malfoy drawled. “You're staying with us for the remainder of the summer, I understand.”
“That's what house-elves are for. Honestly!” Draco shook his head. “Forget about your hair, we don't have all night.”
“I see. Are you aware that Lockhart returned to his office to find most of the furniture in flames?”
Lockhart beamed down at everyone. “Good evening! Can everyone see me? Yes? Can everyone hear me? Good. Now, the Headmaster has graciously allowed me to start up a duelling club, so that you're all well prepared if ever you should need to defend yourselves – as I have on  many occasions – but then you all know that, having read my books!”
Harry watched as Draco read the story. His face gradually went completely white, before angry pink spots appeared on his cheeks. “Son of a banshee,” he snarled.
Draco started off for the dungeons before he realised Harry wasn't following him. “Potter! Come on, you prat!”
Theo shut the door quietly. “I've figured out how we're doing this, and it's all thanks to you, Harry.”
“Because the monster is said to be controllable only by the heir of Slytherin,” Hermione said quietly.
Harry grinned and went back to his bed. Draco had just opened an anthology of historical figures so evil they were known to both wizards and Muggles, like Vlad the Impaler and Rasputin.
“Flint, one of the Bludgers has been tampered with, it won't leave Harry alone. Get Hooch to look it over,” Gemma replied angrily.
Draco began the tale again, though Harry noticed with amusement that this rendition contained a lot more swear words than the version he'd told in McGonagall's office. Harry half listened as he loaded up his plate; he was absolutely starving now that the shock was wearing off.
They Apparated onto one end of platform 9 ¾. “Come along Harry, you don't want someone Apparating on top of you,” Mrs Malfoy said as she gently guided him forward.
“Because,” smirked Draco, “Harry and I are the only students who know the full story of what went on tonight. How would you like to be our official spokeswoman? You'll get to tell everyone.”
Theo nodded. “He's been packing ever since by the looks of things. Filch has been carrying his things down to the Entrance Hall all night.”
“Jealous of a little attention, are you?” Draco sneered back. “Must be hard, having so many siblings. I bet mummy and daddy just forget all about you.”
” Harry shouted, grinning as Ron got knocked over. He got to his feet as Seamus handed him back his wand.
Pansy gasped and Daphne burst into tears. Blaise put an arm around her as Tracey grabbed Theo's arm.
Draco shoved him back. “You were acting like a Gryffindor last year when we went after the Stone...”
“Should be over there, we can cut through the line,” Draco said, and proceeded to do just that. Harry followed him in time to see Draco collide with a photographer who was focused on Lockhart.
They both nodded as Mr Malfoy walked in and took his seat at the head of the table. “Narcissa. Draco. Ah, and this must be Harry Potter.” His cold grey eyes surveyed Harry.
“I don't know, do I! I was sitting in the U-bend when a book landed in me. I didn't see who did it,” Myrtle sniffed. “It's over there now; the water washed it out.”
“It's fine,” Ginny said firmly. “They were perfectly nice to me. When they were speaking English, that is.”
“When young Harry here – stay still!” he hissed at the squirming Harry and cleared his throat. “As I was saying. When Harry walked into Flourish and Blotts, he only wanted to buy my autobiography,
Harry grinned. “My aunt hates it. Too much long hair and baggy clothes for her, I think. She caught Dudley watching one of their video clips and actually told him he couldn't listen to them, so I decided I would. Turns out I like them.”
“If you'll just sign here, Mr Potter, I'll owl this to Gringotts to settle,” Ainsley pushed a piece of parchment over to Harry. He signed quickly, trying not to think of the price. Still, it wasn't everyday he bought an entire wardrobe, he thought, as he pocketed the long receipt.
With two cracks, Dobby Disapparated from in front of Mr Malfoy, to pop back next to Draco. Mr Malfoy's cane swished through empty air, and he glared at Draco.
“Yes, though not to the same extent as you or – or your father,”Snape replied. “That's ground finely enough. Add it to the cauldron and stir thrice clock-wise before setting it to simmer.”
“Not about that. He was just happy to get out o' the castle, to tell the truth. 'Sides, he couldn't have. The way that girl died, he couldn't've done it. An Acromantula kills someone, well, there isn't much of a body left to be found.”
Snape finally looked at him again. “If you're staying at Hogwarts over the Christmas break, I will be amenable to a visit on Boxing Day.”
Pansy shrugged. “Him or you - I haven't made up my mind. Perhaps I'll poison both of you, and then myself for good measure.”
to say anything, Minister,” Draco snapped, and Harry realised that the man in the suit was the Minister for Magic, and wondered what he was doing here. Fudge turned red at Draco's answer, but Dumbledore held up a hand.
“Of course. I'll just run up and get my scarf and meet you back here,” she said before trotting off.
They splashed through the puddle until the shadowy figure came into view. It was Mrs Norris, her stiff body hanging from a torch holder.
Fudge drew himself up to his full but unimpressive height. “Lucius, you're coming to the Ministry for questioning. Aurors, if you would.”
“Of course that's not why I –” Mr Malfoy cut himself off when he looked around to find both of the red-robed men had their wands aimed at his throat.
A second later Draco appeared as he ripped off the Invisibility Cloak and launched himself at Harry, hugging him fiercely. “I thought you were dead,” came his muffled voice.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the afternoon playing one-on-one Quidditch with the Quaffle and one Bludger. Each of them had a Beater's bat, but even so, they were considerably bruised by the time they stopped. Tilly had returned at some point and set up a small table with fresh apple juice and some sandwiches, and they tucked in as they compared bruises.
Half an hour later Harry made his way back to his own dorm. Tracey had insisted on him unlocking each girl's trunk as well as the dorm door before she declared him free to go. She'd been demanding, but Harry had to admit that she'd been very helpful.
“Colin,” Hermione said. When Draco frowned, she continued. “Alright, yes, it's a bit creepy but... I liked the photo and convinced him to give it to me. So just leave it, please.”
Tom twirled Harry's wand thoughtfully. “Blood magic. Of course. That gave you a powerful protection. Too bad it won't save you now.”
“Well Parselmouths are rare, there's probably a better chance of someone from another house finding out the real password than speaking Parseltongue.”
The Gryffindor captain landed and strode towards them. “Flint! This is our practise time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!”
“Piss off,” Draco said, his lip curling slightly. By this time there was a small crowd of students watching.
Harry gave him a small smile. “I'm fine now, though.” When Draco still looked upset, he tried a joke. “My handwriting's never been neater.”
Soon they had all the pixies rounded up in the cage. Some were immobilised from the boys' spells, while some were simply knocked out by Millicent's book.
Harry left them to their chess game and returned to his room. He changed happily into his new pyjamas, wondering how long it would take until he stopped grinning foolishly every time he put on his new clothes.
“Besides which, I think he'd be more than capable of detecting a poison you tried to give him,” Hermione was saying. “Have you read his books? I'd be very surprised if there weren't some Dark creatures looking for revenge, he would have considered the possibility of being poisoned.”
“My mother died when I was a baby, too. From having me, actually,” Theo said. “My father doesn't like to talk about her much.”
Even though this was the first he'd heard of Colin coming to visit him, Harry still felt a pang of guilt. Colin might be annoying, but he meant well.
Hagrid's face was covered with a fuzzy balaclava, and he had a dead rooster in one hand. “Hullo, Harry. Why aren't you in class?”
The candles were nearly burnt out when Harry was jolted out of his bored stupor. Over Lockhart's prattling and the scrubbing of Draco and Millicent, was a cold, hateful voice.
There was no movement in the dark room. Harry quietly crossed to the windows and yanked the curtains back, letting sunshine fill the room. There was a groan from the bed. Harry sniggered and ran over, throwing himself bodily onto the empty half of the bed. There was a louder groan as Draco attempted to roll away.
Snape nodded. “The diary has been destroyed, so you should now be regaining all that Riddle siphoned from you.”
They sat up, and Draco handed back Harry's glasses. He looked over and giggled. “Your hair's all messed up.”
“Yes, sir. Dobby has heard of Harry Potter's greatness, and his goodness. But Dobby has never been asked to shake a wizard's hand before.”
Harry held on as tight as he could as they started to rise through the air. They moved quickly, but even so, it took a while before they got to the top of the pipe. They emerged into Myrtle's bathroom.
Draco put the trunk on the ground. “Tilly!” A small elf popped up next to him. Like Dobby it was wearing a filthy pillowcase, but this one was even smaller than him, and had brown eyes.
He watched through barely open eyes as the basilisk looked down at the floor. Tom stopped laughing and made an abortive lunge towards the diary, but it was too late. One of the basilisk's fangs pierced the diary as the giant snake's head slammed into the ground. Two of its fangs broke off with the force of it, one of them lodged in the diary. The book began emitting a high, unearthly scream as torrents of ink poured out of it. Tom writhed in silent agony, clearly screaming as he jerked around, before he disappeared.
“Mr Potter. Come with me,” Snape said. As he walked out, he shot a look at Blaise. “Try to keep your romantic activities confined to the common room after curfew, Mr Zabini.”
Resigned to a year of being stared at by new first years, Harry followed as his friends headed towards a line of horseless carriages that would carry the older students to the castle. Harry spent the trip watching the castle grow larger, determined not to ask how the carriages were moving. He didn't want a lecture on
“These romantic chaps will be roaming the school today, delivering any and all Valentines you wish to send! And may I take the opportunity to now thank the forty-six people who have already sent me one so far today! But that's not all! Why not ask Professor Flitwick to teach you an Entrancing Enchantment? Or ask Professor Snape to brew you a Love Potion!”
The hall was empty when Snape finally led Harry off the stage. He paused at the doorway and waved his wand a few times, replacing the stage with the usual tables.
“Er, I wanted to borrow some hairpins from you, actually. If you have anything that looks like this?” Harry showed her his photocopied instructions.
“Maybe because I've met you, last year, and you're not that scary any more? You're not even properly alive.” Harry spoke with a bravado that he didn't feel. He was trapped here with Tom, who had his wand, and he was beginning to find it difficult to remain sitting up.
When they reached the Great Hall, they found it decorated with the usual giant pumpkins, with live bats sleeping under the rafters. Students were noisier than usual, looking forward to the feast to come. Harry sat quietly, sipping his tea as he waited for the others to finish eating.
Harry gave a breathless, relieved laugh. “Good. Er, what do we do about that? I kind of promised to free it if it killed Tom.”
They walked forward slowly. There was something shining on the wall at the end of the corridor, reflected from a puddle on the floor. Coming closer, they saw there was water leaking out from a door, bouncing torchlight back onto the walls. There was something written in large letters.
With that Snape took off for the nearest pillar as Harry shut his eyes. He heard a scraping sound far above him before a colossal weight hit the ground close to him.
Hermione narrowed her eyes and huffed, but didn't say anything. Draco smirked and walked into the kitchen, leaving them alone in the corridor.
“All because of you,” Tom hissed, and his eyes flashed red. “What did you do to me all those years ago?”
“I dunno... I set a snake on Dudley at the zoo last year... And I convinced a bunch of snakes to invade the Dursleys' front garden over the summer,” Harry said with a fond smile.
With that the elf ran out of the room and down the stairs. Harry swore and took off after him as quietly as he could. He found Dobby crouching on top of a kitchen cabinet with Aunt Petunia's pudding floating in front of him.
Pansy nodded. “Yes, Justin. Hufflepuff in our year, Muggle-born, pretentious wanker. Should be in Herbology with the Gryffindors this morning.”
Harry craned his neck to see which one it was. It was one he'd drawn last week, showing Draco and his mother playing chess in front of the fire. It was one of his best so far, and he was rather fond of it himself.
What followed was one of the oddest meals Harry had ever experienced. Mrs Malfoy dominated the conversation, and several times she gave Harry the impression she was steering it away from certain topics. Mr Malfoy was talking about people at the Ministry Harry had never heard of, so he concentrated on his food, which was better than even the Hogwarts food. Draco was telling him about each dish that was served, most of which consisted of food Harry had never heard of before. He was fairly certain a lot of the dishes were French.
He trooped outside, and Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk. Harry stood there nervously; watching Fawkes had made him forget why he was there, but now all his anxiety was flooding back. Dumbledore pressed his fingers together as he watched him, and Harry had a ridiculous urge to laugh; he looked like Mr Burns from
Gemma shook her head. “My dad's bald, so it doesn't count. Now, we have more important things to talk about.”
“But I did it! I let the basilisk out. I should have fought back or something, but I just let him take over.”
He found Draco sitting up in bed, surrounded by piles of letters and parcels. There were two breakfast trays next to him.
Five minutes later they had the heavy cage sitting on the desk in the office. Harry looked around the office with distaste. The walls were covered with portraits of Lockhart, all of whom were watching the three students with interest.
“She may have mentioned it,” Draco replied distractedly. He was lifting up the discarded wrapping paper in search of undiscovered presents.
“Yeah. I stayed at Draco's house during the summer, and his parents found out then. Draco knew last year. He actually told me how rare it was, before that I just assumed everyone could do it. So now I'm teaching him.”
Snape sighed. “I understand how if feels to fear for a friend, Harry. But rest assured, Miss Granger will make a full recovery as soon as we are able to administer the Mandrake Restorative Draught.”
Harry filled the bath and added some bubble bath, which turned out to create sparkly bubbles that floated across the surface of the water. He got washed quickly and then swam around until the bubbles had all disappeared before finally climbing out. He wrapped a large fluffy towel around himself and padded into the closet, where the house-elves had evidently unpacked all his clothes.
Lockhart looked at the others, then back at Harry. “There's no one here... Well, look at the time! I've kept you too long, you're tired I expect. Fame does have its drawbacks, you know. Off to bed with you, then.”
The other girls and Blaise followed her out of the hall. Theo looked around himself before leaning over the table towards Harry and Draco. “You know that favour you both owe me? It's time to pay up.”
“Quite a bit, as a matter of fact,” Snape said quietly. He started to unbutton his left sleeve. Draco's eyebrows shot up, but Harry just looked on in confusion as Snape rolled back his sleeve. There was an ugly, faded tattoo on his left forearm of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth.
“Because I knew that if I did not, he would most certainly follow me down into a Chamber where I had good cause to believe a basilisk lay in wait for us,” Snape said slowly, as if speaking to a small child.
“He tried to shut us down, and some people took that as an admission of guilt,” replied a sixth year. “But most of the serious money is one or both of you.”
Draco muttered something under his breath, causing Hermione to turn accusing eyes on Harry. He met her gaze placidly before looking back up at the ceiling.
The two teachers strode to the far ends of the stage before turning to face each other. Snape jerked his head at Lockhart, who was bowing elaborately. They straightened up and held their wands up like swords.
Snape gave him a doubtful look but let him go. When Harry didn't immediately topple over, he turned around and surveyed the dead basilisk. “
Between the two of them, Harry and Snape related the events to their audience. When they finished,  Draco was pale and gripping the arm of Harry's chair tightly, McGonagall and Dumbledore looked grave, and Fudge and his companions tense.
“It could be both of them,” the blonde girl offered. “They're always together, maybe one of them is the Heir, and has convinced the other to help him?”
“Oh, I'm sorry, were you hoping to snog?” Hermione asked, arching a brow at Draco. Harry watched as they stared at each other. To his surprise, Draco blushed and looked away first, and Hermione smiled oddly. Whatever had just happened, neither one seemed to want to tell Harry.
“They couldn't have done it, Minerva,” he said quietly. At Filch's angry sputtering he held up a hand and continued. “We will be able to cure her in time, Argus. Professor Sprout has some Mandrakes on hand. Once they're matured, they will be used to create a potion that can cure Mrs Norris.”
Harry jumped back from the door, checked that the loose floorboard was properly flush with the rest of the floor, and sat down on his bed. Outside, the footsteps slowed and then stopped. Another lighter set came up the stairs more slowly, and then a woman's voice said something too quietly for Harry to make out.
“You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school. Forgot to mention it... Slipped your mind, I daresay...” Uncle Vernon grabbed Harry by his collar and started dragging Harry upstairs. “Well, I've got news for you, boy... I'm locking you up... You're never going back to that school... Never... And if you try and magic yourself out – they'll expel you!”
Snape flicked his wand at the blackboard, causing the instructions to appear. “Fetch the ingredients.”
The two red-robed men bound Mr Malfoy's hands together. The taller one took his cane, and they marched him from the room.
Harry followed her in silence to an ugly gargoyle. “Sherbert lemon!” This was obviously a password, as her words caused the gargoyle to leap aside and the wall behind it to open onto a moving staircase. They stepped onto it and were carried up a narrow tower, like a spiral escalator. They stepped off at the top and McGonagall knocked on a door with a griffon-shaped door knocker.  It opened at her touch, and she curtly ordered Harry to wait there before she left.
Harry chatted with Draco and Adrian as they finished breakfast. Finally, Flint shut the strategy book he'd been going through with Miles and stood up.
Harry frowned at his photocopy in frustration. This had all seemed so simple in the library. He was discovering that looking at
Blaise looked at Draco for a few seconds before answering. “Nothing, Harry. Nothing at all,” he said in a tone that implied Harry was being extremely thick.
“Er, thanks.” Harry shrugged self-consciously. “There isn't really much else to do at the Dursleys'.”
He carefully folded up his photocopy and put it in an old biscuit tin along with the pins, then stashed the whole lot under the loose floorboard he'd prised up. He flopped onto his bed and pouted at his ceiling. All his plans for the week were ruined.
Draco rolled his eyes as they stepped through the entranceway. “So you're never using the actual password again?”
“Yes,” Snape nodded. Harry smothered a laugh and looked at Draco, whose lips were twitching through his frown.
Harry put the letter down and checked the time. Eleven o'clock was more than enough of a sleep in for Draco, he decided, and headed next door and knocked. He waited a few seconds before knocking again, then opened the door.
“I'm beginning to think someone doesn't want me playing Quidditch at all,” Harry replied. “Last year Quirrell jinxed my broom, now a Bludger decides I'm the only player on the pitch...”
“Release your owl, Harry, and she can fly to the Manor. No doubt she'd like the chance to stretch her wings.” As he did so, Mrs Malfoy shrunk down Hedwig's cage and handed it to Draco, who put it in his pocket.
Draco shook his head. “I'm not. Just before the match, the three of us were in the Entrance Hall. Harry heard that voice again, only this time, I did, too. Hermione said she thought she knew something, then said she had to go to the library. We didn't think anything of it, really, as that's normal for her.”
“Because Parselmouths are often Dark wizards. The last known Parselmouth was in fact the Dark Lord.”
“Yes. They're something of a family tradition, though my father has improved the breeding program, I think. He no longer gets coloured peacocks, in any case.”
They looked up in surprise, having forgotten where they were sitting. A group of older Gryffindors were glaring at them.
“Er, yeah. But I need to go to Gringotts. I don't have much money on me,” he said awkwardly. “I'm sorry to be a bother.”
Draco jumped a bit when the music started playing in his ear, but was soon relaxing against the headboard on Harry's bed, watching him sort out his clothes. Harry noticed out of the corner of his eye that Draco was tapping a foot in time with the music. When he finished he flopped onto the bed and grinned.
She opened a box on her bedside table and rummaged through it, before dumping a mess of pins in his hands.
Harry laughed. “You'll be fine. Besides, if Flint does get angry, he'll just take it out on Wood, not you.”
Draco shook his head and tore his gaze away from the door. “I'm fine,” he repeated, then crouched down. “Dobby, are you all right?”
Draco sighed. “Yes, but I wanted to apologise to her. She started to come over to us during the fight and I had to make her stay away.”
Mrs Malfoy swept down the stairs a few minutes later, and clicked her tongue irritably when she saw Harry alone. “Tilly.”
Mr Malfoy was cut off as Mr Weasley gave a yell and tackled him. They knocked the cauldron over and crashed into a bookshelf, showering books down on the witches still in line. The twins were yelling “fight, fight!” as the two men rolled around on the floor. Harry and Draco jumped backwards as an assistant came rushing towards them to break up the fight, and then a shadow fell over them. Harry looked up to see Hagrid walking through the crowd.
Dobby spun around and looked at Harry with a guilty look. “Harry Potter! Can Dobby do anything for Harry Potter? Maybe send his mail for him?”
All too soon the train pulled into King's Cross. The Weasleys said goodbye and ran off to their parents, and Neville walked over to his grandmother.
His spell must have hit Tom, because Harry couldn't hear him anymore. There was a scuffling sound followed by footsteps, then the sound of something very large sliding across the stone floor. Snape swore just before there was a loud bang and a tumble of rocks.
Harry blushed and looked around for an escape route. The corridor was too crowded though: apart from his own class, the Gryffindors were making their way to Charms, and there was a line of first years watching wide-eyed.
Harry awoke on Friday in a good mood. Both Draco and Theo had gotten onto the Quidditch team the night before, he'd enjoyed the classes he'd had so far, and not even the sight of the remaining newspaper clippings on the walls could bring his mood down.
