"So warm and…" He seemed to look for the right words. "Just warm."
"That's completely unnecessary," Haley hissed, although she felt already much warmer. "Besides, stop trying to distract me. You still owe me an answer."
Draco. Such a pretentious name. Well, I guess, he didn't chose it himself. I glance at his hand sceptically. It would seem weird not to take it, right?
Haley froze. "J-Justin," she whispered almost soundlessly. She wasn't lying but it also wasn't the whole truth either.
"Did something happen?" Hermione asked, worry evident in her voice now. Haley looked at her for a silent moment, contemplatively. Maybe she could voice her thoughts without dropping Malfoy's name.
"Wow, not even Hermione has ever looked this happy over a book," Ron commented when she returned.
It's a kind of corridor. A long hall with doors all around us. And they all look different. The doors, I mean. There are so many colours: green, bottle green, orange, silver, black, burgundy, yellow, red, gold, periwinkle, sky blue, pink, violet…
In response, he only pulled her closer, squishing her face against his chest.
Draco couldn't help but snort because of her choice of words. Well, she was right. He wasn't that kind of person. He rarely did anything without knowing where he would end up or what he could gain from a situation. Usually he avoided uncomfortable or dangerous situations before he even got involved in them. This wasn't him at all. So, why was he treading on such an uncertain path when he had no idea where it would lead him in the end?
She starts her one-woman sparkling show again and I almost laugh. Almost.
"Merlin, Potter, you're infuriating." There was an intense look in his eyes that seemed a little wild but he was smiling despite his words. The smile was reaching his eyes and Haley felt something flutter inside her stomach at the sight. She liked seeing him smile like this. Liked it a lot. And she liked kissing him. Maybe that was enough? His thumb stroked over her cheek gently before he leaned in to kiss her again. Softly… but with an underlying passion that made her think he had been wanting to kiss her all day. Haley closed her eyes and stopped to think. As two arms made their way around her waist and pulled her closer, her own arms came up to rest on the boy's shoulders almost on their own accord.
Fifth year… fourth year… third year.
Haley didn't answer. What was there to say?
That muggle sounded truly awful. Did he get mad often? At Haley? He didn't know what to feel. But he did know that he had to do something to cheer her up. He got up from his seat and walked over to her, standing beside her chair.
" he presses, staring at me intensely. Seems my transformation has worked.
DRACO
"If you can't picture that, maybe you should say no," she advised thoughtfully, "but if you can..."
"About what? How my godfather was killed? Do you think I want to talk about that?" She spat.
"Goodnight, Malfoy," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She let go of his hand. Then she turned around and made her way toward the Oak Doors.
. It's almost like the girl hung the moon or something.
"Shut up or say it again?" He sounded amused.
"You mean about me being less than a human being?"
"Ah." He said, watching Luna fill another mould with chocolate. How many was she going to make? And all of them were for her friends? How many friends did she have?
"That boy you mentioned earlier… do you have an idea why he is giving you so much trouble?"
Nothing helped.
"You think you can fight me?" He asked in that mocking tone again, his own wand, gently rolling back and forth in his opened palm. He remembered the duelling club in second year and how quickly the potion master had disarmed Lockhart with no more than a flick of his wand. Although, he was most definitely a better wizard than that narcissistic fool, he suspected his chances weren't much better. His wand would likely be gone the second he drew it.
"I'll do it." Draco said. "I've already lost my magic. How much worse can it get?"
There's a knowing look on mum's face. "He sent you a package, didn't he? That's why there were so many cinnamon rolls missing." She chuckles. "I'll tell him you liked it."
"A gobstone. Chose any you like."
Like a sleeping monster that only waited for the right moment to tear out her insides when she felt most vulnerable again and again.
A warm feeling crept up in Haley's chest. This was too sweet. Her dad was really the best.
Haley shook her head. "Just thinking," she offered, "you should try that, too, once in a while."
"What if I am? I've got you, don't I?"
"Uh..."
The person sat down to her left, leaving a few inches between them. They stayed quiet, leaving her in peace at least.
Since everyone was busy eating in the Great Hall, Gryffindor tower was completely deserted. At least no one was staring at her that way. Inside her dorm, she found herself alone as well. She threw herself onto her bed in frustration.
"I said
He seemed to be fighting with the next words, his gaze drifting somewhere off to the side. "I felt…
"Huh?" He obviously hadn't expected something like that.
Malfoy shook his head again but there was definitely a hint of pink, dusting his pale cheeks. That told her everything she needed to know. Haley suddenly jumped forward and reached for his pockets. To her dismay, Malfoy stopped her by grabbing her wrists. She glared at him.
He couldn't just sit here and do nothing! If there really were Death Eaters involved, she was in grave danger.
HALEY
Malfoy swallows nervously, before getting up and making his way toward the other end of the room. While he passes through the rows of students the snickering and pointing increases more and more until the noise reminds me of the buzzing of a busy beehive. It's obvious that Malfoy is trying to keep up a somewhat confident appearance but the laughter of the other students visibly gets to him. The sight makes me feel a twinge of sympathy. This is not right.
"I was mistaken," she whispered against his ear. "It's not
"We're not following the path," he interrupted her, grabbing her arm and pulling her into the undergrowth. It was a good thing she had decided to wear trainers.
"Snape?"
"I… I never thought you weren't interesting. I… it was the opposite. I always wondered how someone as amazing as you could ever like
I nod in answer, but she still doesn't let go of my arm. "If you touch that you'll get an electric shock."
"What did you do to me you prat?" She squeaked, sounding terribly close to a mouse.
– flies a circle around me. That's when I realise that I'm not falling any longer. I'm floating now, caught somewhere between falling and flying.
He took the blanket and unceremoniously dropped it onto the grass. Where it unfolded by itself like some super magic blanket. If it was also capable of flying she'd really be impressed.
"That's rubbish!" Haley argued. "You didn't take anything away from him! Least of all me! I'm not a thing, damn it!"
"You know… will… will we see each other before?"
"Let's see who has the last laugh," the Slytherin says in reply. He seems surprisingly determined.
"This essay is insanely complicated! I was about to give up," she admitted. Draco had to force himself not to run to her side and offer to be her tutor or something. It was all due to the desperation in her voice. But at least he was able to help her indirectly. With the book. He'd even marked the most important passages.
After raising it up to his mouth and taking a careful sip, he cleared his throat and finally began to speak. "Surely, you are wondering what it is that has brought me here." He didn't give him a chance to reply and instead continued speaking, "There is an urgent matter I need your assistance with."
mention that blasted name ever again," he concludes, fixing me with a sharp glare. There's a storm of emotions raging behind his grey eyes. I get the feeling that there might be more to the story.
Two minutes. He waited two minutes until he followed them. That bat-bogey hex was something else. First a pumpkin and now those flying beasts. This day was getting worse and worse. The forest, Luna had said. So, to the forest he was headed. Although that was really the last place he wanted to go. He still remembered going in there his first-year. The thought made him shudder. But he had to pull himself together. For Haley.
"That witch is hardly my favourite teacher." He rolled his eyes, flicking at a stray leave that had sailed down from above.
"Draco."
"It may be hard to believe but he's trying, you know? He's trying to be something more than what everyone expects of him." She was obviously trying to stay patient.
"Don't be stupid. Of course I remember her."
"Oh right! Of course! I'm super-mega-famous!" He exclaims and proceeds to bang his head wildly. Instead of waiting for the singer to finish I grab the guitar and start plucking the strings. It sounds awesome if I may say so myself.
He puffed his cheeks out and released a heavy sigh. "Why do girls have to be this complicated?" He grumbled, shuffling his feet on the ground.
HALEY
All the best, Feather :)
"I know."
She imagined telling him. Looking into his sparkling grey eyes and telling him she loved him.
Madame Pomfrey pursed her lips, seeming slightly disgruntled. Then she stepped back at last, smoothing down her robes. "Fine." She looked at Haley as if telling her to keep an eye on her impatient patient.
"Yes!"
“When have you ever seen me with my brother?” I want to know. Simon’s never been to Hogwarts.
Haley nodded.
The Slytherin sneered at her. "Have you gone mad? What are you talking about?"
He cleared his throat importantly. "Well… I take it, you took her back safely?"
"Yes." He admitted reluctantly. "It can happen." It usually didn't happen though. He hated being cold. But he had been so eager to meet her that he had barely remembered pulling on his cloak. It wasn't something he planned to tell her.
I get nauseous from watching this… this whatever
"That wasn't me! And don't call me
It was quiet for a moment. Neither of them knowing quite how to continue from there. There suddenly was so much distance between them. It felt more daunting than it had before, towering higher with each thought and doubt they kept to themselves, unspoken. Perhaps it was time to be brave enough to give them a voice.
"Why don't we finish this conversation somewhere with less curious people around." She sang sweetly, after having noticed how suspiciously quiet everyone around them was. Even Neville was among the listeners. She shot him a glare before impaling one of her peas with her fork. He looked away guiltily.
Haley should have anticipated something like this. Of course, he was going to ask her on another date. She wasn't exactly an expert on dating. But as far as she could judge their date had gone surprisingly well. They had laughed and argued and held hands and even kissed… She felt heat rush to her face at that particular memory.
Haley sneezed. Violently. She didn't know where she was. Everything was dark and she felt terrified. Her heart was thudding in her chest like she'd just run to the forbidden forest and back. Draco. Where was he? Where –
We stop in front of a… well it's not really a door. It's more like a hole in the wall that resembles the night sky. Kind of similar to the ceiling in the Great Hall but much smaller. Is that the girl's 'dream door'?
"Didn't mean
"Do you know about the dream corridor as well?" She asked, wondering if the bird dreamed like Hedwig did.
Haley said nothing. She had just noticed that he was wearing his new gloves. The one's she had made for him. And although a part of her felt happy and warm at the sight, another much bigger part desperately hoped Hermione hadn't noticed them. But that was stupid. He was so far away from them, there was no way, Hermione could have recognized the gloves. Right?
"I was ten. My parents went to visit some important ministry official and took me along." He explained. "It was horribly boring. So, I sneaked out when no one noticed and explored the town."
"Oh right. I almost forgot." She replied. He'd gladly forget about it as well. Why did he even mention it?
He absolutely didn't sound like a four-year-old. Absolutely not.
He grimaced, pulling up a shoulder. "With assistance." He turned to lie on his back. Facing the ceiling instead of her. "Obviously, I can still chop stuff and throw ingredients into a cauldron." He almost growled. "Lighting the fire though… casting necessary spells… I can't do that," he whispered, his hand balling to a fist. "Pansy always does it. Although she thinks I'm just too lazy," he admitted somberly.
"I…" He started to say once more but wasn't sure what he actually wanted to say. Haley finally removed her face from his chest and looked at him, her eyes warm and soft and sparkling like emeralds.
"I guess." He chuckled. "But not as happy as you." He winked at her, before stepping to the side. It was weird. But somehow it did make her happy to be able to talk about this. To share her excitement with someone. With a friend.
"Or perhaps," she added thoughtfully, "you weren't using your time for
And with a
idea.
"Exactly! That's what I thought, too," I agree. It's a thought that I cling to with almost painful determination. It's a much more bearable thought than the alternative.
"I'd like to… you know?" He trailed off, gesturing toward his hair.
"Haley?" A voice asked from the armchair to the left. Damn. The room hadn't been as deserted as she had thought. Maybe she could slip through the portrait door quickly…
"No, we can't. I lost it… I… It's gone! I can't find it… I can't–" He suddenly looks up at the girl in alarm. "You can't tell her. She'll be mad. She can't know – ever – she can't–"
“You’ve never been to the prefect’s dining hall?” He asked in mock-surprise.
For a second it seems she is going to continue arguing but then she sighs and something in her expression softens.
"Professor! That's not-" The boy protests but I continue without letting him finish.
"Come on," Hermione said with a sigh, pulling her friend toward the class. It was strange. Nowadays, there was this permanent feeling of impatience and frustration whenever she looked at Haley. She simply couldn't understand what had gone wrong with her to be… drawn to someone like Malfoy. To some point, she could even understand Ron's cold behaviour toward her. Although, she knew it wasn't the right thing to do.
"If you ever dare dream of me again, I'll make sure you regret it." I growl, narrowing my eyes at him. "That's a promise."
"But it's a good thing that you're learning to defend your mind, isn't it?" Hermione whispered. She had said that almost a million times since the night before. Haley suspected she was a bit envious that she was learning about such an advanced branch of magic. Well, she would gladly swap places with her.
Haley wrenched her arm out of his grasp. "If this is a stupid trick, I'll –
Draco didn't get a chance to calm down from the shock, because he had to quickly and inconspicuously follow the girl that was hastily disappearing to a different – probably more quiet – corner where no one would eavesdrop on her conversation with the boring Ravenclaw.
"Haley?" Sirius asked. "You took it from him, didn't you?"
"Weasley." Malfoy interrupted him in a rather neutral tone.
Haley remembered how disappointed she had felt when Michael Corner had dumped her for Cho Chang time and time again. But it had only been a stupid crush, so it hadn't hurt too badly. She tried to imagine what it would be like if the same thing happened with Draco and some girl… The mere thought sent a sharp pang of pain through her chest.
, a voice asked mockingly. She shook her head. This wasn't right. He had only asked because he had been worried.
"Why?" Luna asked her eyes even wider than usual.
Haley stared at the girl in confusion. “You’re Colin Creevey’s sister or not?”
Draco shot her a sceptical look. She shrugged. She did that a lot, he noticed.
Malfoy was awfully quiet. Why didn't he say anything? It would be better if he told her that he didn't like the present. Or perhaps it was because of the colour? Or the shape?
"Amazing? If I sang by myself perhaps. Your singing voice is decent, I guess."
I want to push him off her. He has no right to smile at her in such a creepy way.
There was something conflicting in Luna's eyes, when he glanced at her for a second.
I land on top of something soft and fluffy. Hedwig. She saved me. And as if it could not get any more surreal than this I suddenly hear a very familiar melody that seems to come from everywhere around us.
Ron stepped right in front of her, in his blue eyes she saw something between confusion and annoyance. "Then who were they for?"
In that moment, high wailing sounds disturb the air. Simon is running toward the climbing frame, demanding his sister's attention at once. Dear Merlin, he's so tiny. He can't be older than five.
He had been afraid at first. Afraid that Potter would be able to see through him completely. See everything he wasn't ready to show her. He had been afraid that once she found out how he truly felt about her she would reject him after all. Or worse, feel disgusted by him and run away. But when he had looked at her after pulling away, he hadn't seen anything like that on her face. If anything, she had seemed somewhat confused…
(fine I'll come up with something later)
"Then why did you hurt her in the first place?" I ask, the question fuelling my anger again.
But now he was at a crossroads.
He left a trail of lingering kisses from her chin to her ear. It tickled. It filled her chest with a strange ache. Git. How did he just make her irritation dissolve into nothing with nothing but a few ridiculous touches? She felt less angry, already.
(See the end of the chapter for
Haley felt like something in her vision was righting itself all of a sudden. Something that had been upside-down for a long time was now standing right-side-up in front of her. It was a thrilling, exhilarating feeling. Like suddenly anything she could imagine was possible.
She took the quill from his hands and carefully checked if the midnight blue feather was undamaged.
"Oh." Haley was surprised and possibly a little bit disappointed.
She shook her head stupidly. What else was there to do?
I shake my head again, trying not to grin.
"Ron, you're hurting her! It's enough!" Hermione cut in. Haley wondered why it had taken this long for her to say something. Perhaps, there was a part of her that was curious about Haley's answer as well?
"Yeah, I just… just want to check something," she replied, scanning over the words quickly. Before she could read more than a few sentences the book was snatched out of her hands.
"You'll write, won't you?" She said, watching his eyes searchingly.
Haley took her time, slurping the noodles into her mouth and splashing sauce everywhere, before answering. The boy watched her with a strange expression that was partly disgusted and partly amused.
"Sure," Draco agreed. "I'll go first. Wait a few moments before you follow me."
"I was scared," the other girl admitted quietly. "Of being right."
She was starting to relax into the embrace, when the sound of his voice shook her to the core.
She shook her head stubbornly. He was already unbuttoning his coat. "No, you don't have to – I don't want your stupid coat!"
"Who would have thought," Hermione replied nonchalantly, bumping her shoulder lightly.
Haley grinned. She knew for a fact, that Neville already had plenty of Morganas. But she appreciated the effort he made, instead of asking her whether she was all right. She must have heard that question at least a hundred times already!
"Who's crying?" Haley replied weakly. But she nevertheless circled her arms around his back.
Lovegood was raising her eyebrows at him in amusement. This was so embarrassing!
So much for getting past him.
broken heart?
sister..." He muttered.
"All right, all right," Simon said from his room. "Bishop to F9." He was sitting in front of his own chess set. They were playing chess across two rooms with two sets of chess. It was absurd. But at least it kept her from worrying herself to madness. And like this she could keep an eye on Baz. Somebody (read: Simon) had to watch over Neville. And since Haley didn't want to leave Draco's side and didn't trust that little devil in a room with her baby brother, they had found themselves in this impossible chess arrangement.
"But why would someone be following you?" Ron wondered.
"Come on. I'm not trying to turn you into a cat two times in a row. That would be much too predictable." She grabbed a chocolate chip muffin with cherries, bit off a chocolatey chunk and offered it to the boy.
," Haley commented.
"Another?" I ask.
I look up at the stars that are shining brightly above us now. I wish it could always be like this. No irritating friends. No exams. No one who’s judging or accusing me of something. No strange complicated feelings that don’t make sense at all. No pretending. No barriers. Just this. The feeling of lightness and ease. A moment where nothing at all matters and everything is incredibly important at the same time.
"I was being sarcastic."
"What?" He asked. "No, that's not true – that's not – Hermione, she – what about Luna?" he finally blurted.
Thank you lots and lots for reading :) Comments and kudos and bookmarks make me happy :)
"Probably? Are you going to make a habit out of this now? Telling people about us without checking with me first?" She had meant for it to come out as a joke but now she realised that the whole incident still bothered her somewhat. She crossed her arms.
"But he's not innocent either! He was there that night!" She fired back. "He
Haley groaned. Hermione drew the curtains open but before she could slip through them, Haley stopped her by calling her name.
Draco found the part about transportation especially interesting. He circled it. Along with the section about protection. It was a pity he didn't know where they had actually gone. He'd worry about that later. In another paragraph it said, that he needed desert rose petals in order to bring the golem to life. But where could he get those from?
"Sure, if you're not a guy," muttered Ron grumpily.
"Where are your manners? You're scaring away our guest," mum's voice admonishes. But she's nowhere to be – there. The dragon wings. She is still as small as my thumb and cheerfully painting colourful patterns onto the cookies with a toothpick airbrush. Did I imagine it or did she just wink at me? Has everyone gone insane? I march over to where Simon is cutting out the next batch of biscuits.
, Draco thought with a shudder.
On the other side of the door we're greeted by an onslaught of colours and light. This is not the dream corridor.
"Haley."
"So, what's with the broomstick," a familiar voice asked to his left. He turned his head, quickly shoving the balled up letter into his robe pocket. He hadn't even heard anything. Then she suddenly appeared in front of him, as if she had apparated. She had done something to her eyes. Was that make-up? He suppressed a grin.
"I'm here. You were having a nightmare."
"Don't worry about it. I'll talk to her when I'm ready," she replied with a soft smile.
"I had the impression you were kind of… distracted. Are you even trying to find out or is there a different reason for your dream visits?"
"I don't want my hands to get oily after all."
"But… I've never really played… not a real game… I – what if I mess up?" Emily asked in a small voice.
He shook his head lightly. "Don't worry about it. I'm fine." He assured her with a kind smile.
HALEY
Haley shrugged helplessly. "It was a foolish hope anyway." She smeared at her face. "And even if it wasn't… it doesn't seem right. To get him back… at the cost of you. Doesn't there have to be another way?" She chuckled but it came out more like a sob.
"Hey what are you-" She sputtered, trying to remove the flower Malfoy had stuck into her mouth.
"So, we were just talking about the party we're throwing next weekend. If you could invite anyone," he pauses dramatically and looks right into my eyes. "Who would you invite?"
Malfoy was stroking his thumb over the back of her hand now. His hand wasn't as cold any more. She wondered whether there was a reason why it was always so cold in the first place. It couldn't hurt to ask, right? It wasn't like he was going to tell her he was a vampire or something.
"I'm sure there are also other things you're good at," Malfoy reasons.
"It's not. I was referring to the bit about bravery."
"What do you want then?" Pansy wanted to know. She still seemed upset. Her eyes fell on his notes. He hid them behind his back.
know that," Draco answered haughtily, snatching back the magazine and shoving it carelessly into his bag. He did know he shouldn't believe any of it. In theory… But some parts of the 'interview' just wouldn't leave his mind. Like the parts about Potter's preferred hair style. It couldn't be completely made up, right?
"Sorry." Draco kept chuckling. "It just sounds so funny."
And just in that fitting moment, the doorbell rang.
personal – I couldn't think of anything more personal – I…" She raised her hands, waving them in front of her defensively to emphasize her point.
"I'm not going to eat you, don't worry," Malfoy whispered once she had reached the class room.
but the quiet and peaceful cat suddenly turned into a wild beast, biting and clawing at Narcissa who she had not so much as hissed at before that day. On top of that, the cat also tore apart her handkerchief. And this," he said, turning over the painting and removing the backing paper. There was a beautifully made piece of cloth hiding behind the painting. "This is all that's left of it."
"Yes?"
"Did you tell her?" Hermione asked as soon as she had arrived back at her friends' side.
Following an impulse, she took a step toward him, making him step back in turn.
I can't remember. It probably wasn't that important in the first place.
Draco grinned, taking back the necklace and reaching up to fasten it around her neck.
"I could escort you if you wanted to," Luna suggested, "I never really know what to do in Hogsmeade anyway."
"I'm not in the
Her heart was pounding furiously in her chest. And he was still leaning closer!
For some reason Potter grinned. "Well, I guess I know now why they call you the
Anyway, I know you're all interested in the continuation of this. So. I've been thinking of two possible plotlines. One is, Draco and Haley staying together and facing the madness of 6th year together. The other is them breaking up for real and basically all of the dark stuff we know from HBP happening on top of it all. I would really like to try and explore both of these plotlines. But I think I'm going to start going for the somewhat lighter version. For those of you who are also interested in the darker version with Draco as a Death Eater, I will probably start posting that at a later time. So, stay tuned for news on that.
The letters on the page were starting to blur. What was it? A

Before Haley could blink, she was harshly grabbed by the wrist and pulled into an empty class room behind her.

He had slipped the chocolate frog card back into her pocket. His eyes lingered on the card in her pocket a while longer, almost longingly. She raised a questioning eyebrow.
"But that would be useless!" He argues. "She'll never forgive me.
Which maybe hadn't been the best of ideas.
"Certainly." He gave a quick nod and left the headmaster and the sleeping man behind in the dark.
feel this way… about me?"
Hermione shook her head slowly, looking at her hands. "I – It's fine. We were never… I mean we definitely had a good time together but… it's been months since I last saw him and it's not like a few kisses made me believe we were in love or something."
"Hey, you never-" He started to protest, when Haley pushed him away from the door.
unlike a certain sixth year Hufflepuff was honourable and most importantly he had standards. As soon as the Hufflepuff came into sight, Draco would-
? This doesn't look like a simple note book," Hermione mused as she picked the book up from the ground and started to leaf through the pages.
. You need to wake up or I’ll be late for Potions!” The surprisingly high voice continued to torment her. The hand shook her shoulder again.
He glared at her in annoyance. She was really pushing it today.

," Haley said, causing the portrait to swing open. She only had to tip-toe quietly through the common room and up the stairs to the girls dormitories. That shouldn't be too difficult.
He shook his head but his wrist… he was holding it in a strangely protective way. She reached for his right hand and touched it gingerly. He pulled away with a grimace.
"I don't believe this." Haley gasped out as if he'd just showed her a real life basilisk or something.
Haley whispered an almost inaudible "Mischief managed marvelously," and made the writing on the map vanish. Then she pushed her treasure into the inner pocket of her robes, picked up the cupcake and jumped to her feet. Not a second too early it seemed, as not a second later a figure rounded the corner. Quickly, the girl reached for her hood and pulled it over her face. The figure seemed lost in their own thoughts, walking past her without giving her a second glance.
, Haley thought in relief. Then her eyes widened in alarm. No, no, no, this was bad! What if Ron hadn't found a suitable object yet?
"I don't know…" Luna shrugged, glancing out at the moon. "I don't think I'm the right person to judge that."
Haley turned around with a triumphant smirk.
Cool. I put the guitar back and reach for the handle. There's no turning back now.
"Yeah." She nodded. "Sometimes I think she's too clever for her own good." She chuckled softly. "She… wasn't too happy about it, though. But… I think she's trying… to come to terms with it. More or less. At least she's still talking to me." She added with a sad little laugh. It was quiet for a moment, while Haley did nothing but stare at the ground and listen to the soft sounds of their breathing.
him even. How could they ever…?" She shook her had, looking like the world had gone mad.
The title is inspired from the song "Crueler Kind" by San Fermin. If you add a comma after love (Love, the enemy) it completely changes the meaning of the sentence, which I find really interesting. Feel free to interpret that however you want.
Then he suddenly wraps me up in his arms and kisses me, taking all the air from my lungs and making me feel even more breathless than before. Am I falling? Or flying? Is this a dream? Or reality?
If Haley was an emotionally unstable teenage boy who'd had a fight with his girlfriend… where would she be? Sulking in her dorm? Hiding in a secret tree house? But then… he had to be hungry. So… maybe the kitchens? She was already halfway down the stairs, convincing herself he'd be there, when another thought entered her mind.
She hated that she had to make him go through this alone. She reached for his hand, squeezing it softly. Reassuringly. "Look, maybe… if I catch the snitch really quickly – I can come back and–"
"What?" Draco echoed, a tad disbelieving. A tad hopeful.
"I- we didn't- nothing! - I mean-" She stammered, exhaling audibly. "Why do boys always have to be perverts?"
Quidditch was not Haley's favourite pass time, if she was honest. It was mostly her brother and her dad who were the quidditch fanatics in her family. But there had been a free spot as Seeker in her first year, and everyone always said what a fantastic Seeker James Potter had been and that surely she would have inherited his talent… So, just like everyone expected she had tried out, coincidentally caught the snitch and had been accepted without further questions. Since then, no one had dared kicking her off the team, not even on her worse days.
"Of course, why wouldn't-" From the corners of my eyes I notice him gesturing at something behind me. Oh right. I've still got my butterfly wings.
"But-"
"He's probably in his dorm, having a first-year deliver him food. He's not been in the Great Hall for a day. So what? Honestly, don't you think he can take care of himself? He's a wizard after all."
"You did," Ron insisted, nodding, "Ginny told me how her house mates treat her. It's not right. At least we, as members of the same secret organization, shouldn't treat her like that."
"Did you already forget the incident on the train? Or when you were being an insensitive prat only one week later?" Haley interrupted his excuses.
Black seemed entirely focused on the note now. He was not seriously planning to…? Well, what did Severus care? Perhaps he was going to use it and Severus would finally be rid of a loathsome old acquaintance. Served him right for trying to get him killed by a werewolf all those years ago. Severus had done what he came here for. Now, there was a headache potion waiting for him in his office. And a foolish girl to look for. Of course.
Once he was finished with whatever he'd been doing, he carefully walked back over to where she was sitting. 'What are you doing?' Haley wanted to ask but seeing what Malfoy was doing silenced the words in her throat. He was kneeling down in front of her, reminding her of that time in the class room earlier this week. He'd knelt down then, too, picking up her wand for her. What he was doing now, was even more shocking.
in it, I wanted to puke."
Draco nodded absently. It did make sense. He sometimes thought of her as Potter, too. But it was becoming less and less.
Neville listened attentively.
"Yes. That's why I need to wear the object on my skin, so the memories of me will get soaked up inside the gobstone."
But first I want to see more of the corridor. There is one door that I am especially curious about. I wander along the corridor, making a game out of guessing whose door I may be passing along the way.
tired.
He looks like he wants to protest. To explain perhaps. But I'm not done with him yet.
He sighed at her stubbornness but nodded nevertheless. Haley smiled. Then she removed her arms from him and gently rested her left hand against his cheek. He shuddered pleasantly, her touch leaving his skin burning. She raised herself up on her tip-toes and dropped a butterfly-soft kiss on the corner of his mouth. Draco's heart stopped. This was the first time
"Oh and it's not even full moon yet. But you could try again tomorrow if you wanted."
Haley thought, biting back a grin,
She clucked her tongue impatiently. "Yes. He did that because you threw him at Malfoy as if he was a blasted basketball!"
He wanted to talk to her. Or just… be close to her. Make sure they were okay. Before two long months of summer would separate them.
But the days had went by without only the slightest inclination from her that she wanted to as much as talk to him. Like Luna had advised he was trying to give her time. But it was so so hard.
"The boy you're dating." He mumbles. I pull away, scrunching up my brows. It's an easy question. But the answer is not easy at all. It's messy and confusing and complicated. Why did I even start talking about this?
stupid," he clarified, "Why red? Don't you like brown or green or…
"I can't taste anything!"
"Stop that, it's just rain," she argued in a whisper, removing his hands from her face.
As she kept glancing at the people below them in fascination, his eyes wandered all across her familiar silhouette. Violet definitely was a good colour on her. And why wasn't she wearing dresses more often? The lightweight fabric, accented with ribbons and little fabric flowers at the seams made her look even lovelier than usual. She ducked down slightly, so she had a better view of the other students. That way he could admire the silver clasp her hair was held together with, which was decorated with little flowers as well. Had she put in all that effort for him?
"How dare you!" I growl, summoning all the anger and frustration I've felt for the last months.
"He kept asking, too. So, I said yes. If only to stop him from bothering me." She seemed to be lost in a memory again. A memory Hermione couldn't see. "He surprised me in the end. In a positive way. In many ways actually." There was something gentle and soft about her face.
The rich taste of the soy sauce accented with countless spices left an explosion of flavours and pure delight on her tongue. She closed her eyes, seeing herself in London with Simon. The both of them trying noodle soup for the first time. Her trying to forget her broken heart. She was in the kitchens with the house elves, abandoned by her closest friends. She was in the kitchens with Malfoy, slurping her noodles while he pestered her about one thing or another. Or maybe just… keeping her company. When no one else would.
Hello dears, I know y'all curse me because I left you at that kind of place... and I don't even have an excuse. It seemed like a reasonable place to end the chapter. Don't you agree? I don't know if I've mentioned it but we're kind of slowly nearing the end... Just to give you a heads-up. There will be a few more chapters of course and I'll probably write extra stuff even once the main story is done but... yeah there are a few more chapters to come. Thanks to you all for hanging in there and leaving me your thoughts!
, he thought,
He rolled his eyes. "I've known that since – "
they were going to meet.
The redhead looked almost panicked at the sight, did she think she was going to slap her?
Although the expression on his face was carefully neutral, as soon as Haley recognized him, she dropped all of her laughing lemons.
, he all but agreed to do anything I asked him to."
"I – um… uh – actually – I – uh..." What? Now she couldn't even form a proper sentence? Well, too bad, she hadn't been able to come up with a good excuse.
was with her now. They were talking about something but Draco couldn't hear what it was. He had to get closer. Before he could get up from his seat, though, he saw a group of students enter the library.
"The school grounds," Luna explained, in her soft dreamy voice that always put him in some kind of strange trance. "I've seen them head toward the forest just now." She pointed toward the window, which Malfoy was still leaning against. He seemed to be unconscious.
"I can't tell whether you're impressed or trying to catch flies," Malfoy disrupted her staring, sounding annoyingly amused. She closed her mouth, which had apparently been hanging open.
It wasn't a date! Haley wasn't nervous at all. She was mostly curious because she had no idea what she was supposed to expect. All he had told her was that he would come get her once she had got rid of her friends. Whatever that was supposed to mean. Was he hiding somewhere near the Hog's Head?
"I don't remember owning a red robe, you know? And I don't even have a white beard."
"Morning Potter," Angelina Johnson greeted Haley at the breakfast table on Wednesday. The words were friendly but the glare on the older girl's face was anything but. "Do you know which day today is?"
Soothingly, Haley stroked Hermione's hair. She had never seen the girl break down like this. It made her feel terrible, the girl's sobs echoing in her ears. She wanted to blame someone. But there was no one to blame.
"Haley, do you understand?" Sirius, repeated his question, urgency colouring his voice.
Draco only watched her, speechlessly, hanging onto her every word as if she'd put him under a spell.
Is it suspicious that I'm wandering around the Transfigurations class room with a massive black hood covering my face? Probably. But on the other hand nobody seems to notice me anyway. They are all busy trying to turn a pine cone into a hairbrush. It's not the most complicated of spells. But for some reason McGonnagall is walking up and down the rows, checking how everyone is doing and correcting them if necessary.
Haley could only gape at her. Why was she behaving like this?
He removed her other hand from his shoulder and cradled it in his own hands as well. He didn't look at her. He was too busy watching their hands. But that didn't mean Haley couldn't look at him.
He reached for Glory's leg and untied the note that was bound to it.
. I'd never do something like that," Haley replied, chuckling. It was too funny.
said and done to make him feel like this. Hurt. Betrayed. Like a stunning spell had hit him right in the heart.
"Right. Well, we just wanted to say hi. See you later, everyone!" Parvati said, waving one more time, before she pulled her friend further along.
No, that's not possible. Malfoy can't kiss me! Why would he? But this feels like a kiss. And now his other arm is wandering down to my waist, pulling me closer…
He walked around her and hesitantly tugged at her hands. She didn't budge.
"Now, I'll do yours," he announces, biting his lips excitedly. It's endearing. Especially seeing as he looks more like an elf than a rock star with his new hair style.
"Um – you go first," Haley offered. She didn't even have an idea what she had been about to say.
It was pathetic, really, how relieved he felt. She had made the mittens
Haley didn't understand. What did that mean?
DRACO
Haley grinned sheepishly. Hermione chuckled and patted the space next to her. She crawled onto the bed and sat down beside her friend.
Evans had been her name. The name of the witch from the memory. The one he'd desperately tried to impress. The one who looked so much like Haley… Her mother. There was no doubt about it. She didn't even spare the boy a single glance. It was obviously a one-sided attraction.
"Then simply keep your word," Haley said sweetly.
"Well… maybe not the first half. I think… it could have been a real memory. It all seemed so familiar. And I do remember giving my gobstones set to some boy when I was younger. I just never… connected that boy with Malfoy."
"I cannot say yet. I have never encountered something like it before. He is not responding to any spells I have tried. It will need some more time." Severus explained.
"Miss me?" The blond asked, smug smirk in place.
HALEY
"You're saying?"
Haley stared at him, the words silently replaying in her mind. She didn't know if she could do it. Only the slightest doubt? Wasn't it normal to have doubts?
"What? No…" Haley frowned. What was he talking about? "I remembered… this is where we first… you know…" She felt heat rush into her cheeks. This was the unused class room where they'd had their first kiss – turned snogging session.
I almost expect the Slytherin to stay silent this time as well. But then right when the singing part starts I hear… something. It's not singing. More like someone hesitantly
"There's a chapter on
“The one who always has her nose stuck inside a book.” The girl elaborated. Hermione then. Interesting. That was almost as good as an apology.
DRACO
"She's the reason you're helping me, isn't it?" Draco interrupted him. "She's the reason you haven't told anyone about Haley and me. She was Haley's mother."
. "Well. The person who wrote this will be leaving the country soon anyway. So, if it's urgent, I'm afraid you'll have to make do with someone else."
"Yes." Haley said, confidently. "But… you probably shouldn't try today. You'll feel even more tired. Dream walking… it's much more exhausting than normal dreaming." If she was honest, she was relieved about it. She didn't know if she was ready to let him into her dreams. It seemed like such an intimate thing. And wasn't that hypocritical of her?
"Malfoy – he–" Sirius eyes widened. "He's dangerous – you have to stay away from him – you hear me? He's evil – he–" The shadow figure was back. Haley turned around, reaching for her wand. Ready to fight. But she couldn't find it. The figure came closer. She could see blond hair and grey eyes. Then wild black locks and eyes filled with cruelty and madness. Then the features vanished and the figure turned to stone… or clay. And a brisk wind took it away.
"Well," he scratched his neck, somewhat sheepish. "It's not like I think he's going to tattle… It's just… it felt like this wasn't my story to tell."
"Oh, really now," he scoffed. "That's nothing you couldn't have found out through watching me."
"Here," he said, holding the quill out to her. She took it out of his hand but before she could turn to leave, Draco grabbed her wrist, effectively stopping her.
"What were you doing there in the first pla-"
"Yeah," Haley whispered, turning the gobstone around in her hands experimentally. What did Malfoy carry a gobstone around for? And why the leather band?
"I didn't
"Do you remember Pettigrew? Crookshanks was suspicious of him since the beginning, right?"
Was he annoyed with her? She sighed, taking his hand gently. He let her. He always did.
With a small satisfied grin the Slytherin closed the potions book and dropped it next to her bag. He stretched his arms over his head and looked at her expectantly. Haley glanced over at the book, suddenly suspicious. Maybe she should check whether the boy hadn't completely made up the last passage. Just to be sure. She grabbed the book and flipped the pages toward the chapter dealing with
He'd been eager to help Montague and make sure he was fine. After all, he was their quidditch captain. With him, the odds of winning the quidditch cup were excellent. But now, he kept going over the moment in Professor Snape's office in his mind. Why hadn't here been a cauldron? Or potion ingredients? Or at least a potions book? Was Snape really tutoring Haley? Or were they doing something different? And if so… what were they really up to? Nothing made sense. And then the Pensieve… He had the feeling the so-called lessons were related to it somehow… But how?
"Even now… you're still defending him. Although, he was trying to take away your magic." It didn't make sense. Why was he behaving like that?
Mum laughs at me. I really feel the love.
"You know when you're the most beautiful?" He tilted his head to the side thoughtfully. "When you're angry. Your nose scrunches up and you turn red like a tomato. And the wrinkle," He chuckled and lifted his hand to her face, tapping his finger against her forehead gently. "Right here, your skin wrinkles up and I always want to reach out and make it smooth again."
"That's me," Sirius stated with one raised eyebrow.
Shit. Why was she imagining Ron's voice now? The girl pulled away and opened her eyes, slowly turning her head… and looked straight into her best friend's horrified blue eyes.
Draco wanted to ask but he wasn't that much of a jerk. Not any more. Still, that didn't stop the feeling of panic that was creeping up inside him. It was true that he enjoyed Lovegood's company. Kind of. Sometimes. And he might have admitted to himself that they were friends. Sort of. But that didn't mean he was ready to go around and tell everyone else about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
How was it possible to feel this much just because of a stupid Gryffindor? But it wasn't just any normal Gryffindor that was leaning against a shelf a few rows away from them. It was
Draco watched her suspiciously. "Wait. How do you know about that?"
He couldn't keep looking at Potter. Potter with her honest green eyes, who made him feel like gloves and biscuits were the best Christmas presents one could ever wish for. Never would he have imagined that something so trivial could make him feel this much. Was it because of her? Because she had given them to him? Or was it the fact that she had put so much thought into the present and had actually made it herself? He wasn't really a fan of self-made things. Or so he had thought. Then why did this touch him so deeply? And Potter thought he didn't like, even hated the present! He didn't think he could ever hate something from her. Even if the biscuits tasted awful they would make him happy.
especially – tend to want it even more… which is why…" He stopped there, letting the sentence hang in the air unfinished. Haley's heart beat painfully in her chest. Did that mean what she thought it did?
, along with a few hisses coming out of his mouth. Wait… Did that mean… Was he a cat? There were delicate white paws where his hands used to be. And for some reason he had the urge to lick himself. He suppressed it. No, no, no, that couldn't be true. That couldn't… Haley finally looked at him. He returned her surprised stare with a glare. This was so humiliating! He even had a tail! Which was currently swinging back and forth to underline his agitation.
"I…did?" Haley offered. Since when did he remember things like these?
"You wish," she retorted. Then she noticed a silver hand mirror in his left hand.
That made him chuckle. Haley couldn't even complain because she kind of deserved it. Instead she sighed, her gaze dropping to the ground again.
"Haley, I," Hermione paused, biting her lips, "I'm sure it's not. You know I never got why you were so caught up with Michael Corner but... this seems different. Whoever it is you're going through all that trouble for surely is not a mistake. If it's someone who genuinely likes you and makes you happy I wouldn't care if you dated Crabbe or Goyle or – I don't know... Moaning Myrtle."
He thought he'd never find another opportunity to speak to her before the summer break. But that evening, after the end-of-year feast, he saw her wandering off toward the two oak doors, away from her house mates, who were returning to their tower. Where was she going? This was his chance!
in here." She seemed very excited about that.
What? What kind of strange parallel universe had he stumbled into now? Draco eyed the cup sceptically. Then he pulled it toward him. At least it warmed his cold hands.
"What do you mean 'we're here'?" Haley asked suspiciously. She was slowly growing anxious. What was the Ravenclaw planning?
sick!" Haley said triumphantly, never minding that the two Slytherins now knew she had been eavesdropping on them.
But then, she turned sideways a bit more and leaned her back against his shoulder. He barely felt the pressure of her weight. It was like she was still holding back. Sharing a little bit of her pain with him but keeping most of it on her own shoulders. It was a small step. But Draco counted it as a win anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What stopped you?" The ghost asked, a tad more gentle.
"Do I seem like someone who needs protection?" He asked incredulously, feeling offended. He wasn't a little child who needed protection.
HALEY
He raised an eyebrow. "Why are you grinning then?"
interwoven in an artful manner.
"Oh?" Now, he was the one sounding hopeful.
"Get away from her, you bastard!" Ron thundered, taking a step toward them, his eyes filled with fury. He didn't get far though. Because Hermione appeared from behind a tree and held him back by his arm. Hermione was here, too? Haley didn't know if this made everything better or worse.
"I'll help you find out about your heart's desire," the girl whispered.
The owl turned its head and bit her fingers softly.
Travelling with floo powder was so much more pleasant than apparating. One second she was in her living room. The next, she stumbled out of Professor Snape's personal chimney in Hogwarts.
But to my disappointment, it has stopped working on her a long time ago.
Potter looked in his direction for a second. He quickly hid his face behind the tree again. Had she heard him? Damn, if she came over now…
"Haley? Haley! Come on, we've gotta go. Now!"
Snape rubbed the bridge of his nose for a moment as if he was fighting a headache. Then he sighed. "Very well, very well. Potter," he said, already halfway through the room, "we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening."
and… as far as we know this could all be a trick. A trick to find out what our side is planning and to-"
"Don't push it, Potter."
"No – I understand. You don't – you don't trust me."
She nodded.
He nods, not meeting my eyes and continues. "I stole that scarf you bragged about to everyone in third year and…"
"He's evil! Stay away! Stay away!"
"Fine," she sighed. "I can read minds."
. Malfoy. For some reason, he's also wearing his quidditch robes.
Haley shook her head tiredly, covering her face with one of her hands. "He doesn't understand," she whispered. "I only said the truth… I mean, it's not like his father is such a charming fellow. Why'd he have to overreact like that?" She really didn't understand it.
Instead, she looked away. "Don't look at me then." She whispered, leaving him to look at the back of her head.
Potter's eyes widened considerably. Did the mere thought of telling someone about their date seem this absurd to her?
"What's there to explain? He obviously hexed you somehow. Or used some blasted potion or curse, what do I know! He deserves to pay!"
The eagle owl tilted its head to the side and regarded her curiously. Haley stuck out her hand and stroked its soft grey plumage gently. She really loved owls.
"Really? It tried to put you in Slytherin?" He all but cackled in her face.
"You know… about Malfoy..."
"Mum – C-Can you–?" She waved over her mother frantically. That blood on his fingers really unsettled her.
He shook his head again, willing the thoughts to leave him in peace.
"I don't know what you're-"
just a boy. Haley had dealt with far worse than that.
I can't help the laughter that bubbles out of me. This is why I came here. My adorable little brother who even in his dreams cares about nothing else but food. You simply have to love him. I kiss the top of his head and loosen my death grip on him. He frees his arm and promptly continues to eat.
"What do you think?" He asked, raising a dark eyebrow.
"Does that mean… you're not going to tell anyone?" He shouldn't have asked it. Even if Snape agreed not to tell anyone, how could Draco trust him? The Slytherin's eyes wandered toward the inner pocket of his robes where his wand was hidden.
Keep reading and stay safe :)
"Almost ten," he answered after a glance at his pocket watch. A bloody
"You think so?" They did have a similar taste in music, so… She lay down on her side, using her arm as a cushion.
"It feels like… I'm always apologizing to you…"
"No, what'd he call you?" I'm already getting angry even though Simon hasn't told me the insult yet.
"Interesting," he commented with a chuckle. Haley rolled her eyes. As if he looked any less strange. The only familiar thing were his tailored robes. Did the guy never wear normal clothes?
"Oh… I – I'm still working on that," I admit, biting my lips. I forgot to ask him again!
come closer," Malfoy orders in a voice that sounds close to panicked. He tightly grips the wand in both his hands. Neville marches on regardless of his words.
reason of course.
Neville shrugged. "Maybe."
Unlike Professor Snape earlier, Haley did stumble into her living room through the chimney. But she chalked it down to her nerves. She really was afraid they had already started or worse finished! If she was too late to support Draco, she would really feel miserable.
"What now?" He asked almost impatiently.
"What?"
He frowned slightly and shook his head. "I was just going to." He mumbled almost inaudibly.
"That night at the grave yard…" he began quietly. "You were tortured."
She leans toward me and I automatically mimick her posture. Our faces are only inches apart and I feel almost as if I am looking into a mirror. Well… except that she looks older. And she also doesn't have to wear glasses.
"Are you not feeling well?" A voice to her left asked.
Haley chuckled, shaking her head. "Where's my muffin?" She asked instead.
Haley sighed in relief. At least he didn't ask her questions she couldn't answer. "Well, then…" She reached for the door, when –
"What the–?"
And just like that Neville was hit with a spell that made it impossible for him to stand, let alone walk.
"Wait, where are you going? The Great Hall is that way!"
Haley chuckled to herself. Her godfather was clearly still trying to talk her out of seeing Malfoy. Well, if Snape told Dumbledore or anyone else, they would have to stop meeting up anyway. At least Sirius would be happy then. And what about herself? How would she feel?
"I… I – It's – I can't…" she began unable to finish. Her hands started to tremble. She was done for. She knew it.
She cleared her throat again, feeling her face heat up. Then, taking a deep breath, she raised her hand to remove the hood. For a long moment the boy only watched her in obvious surprise. Then an amused smirk appeared on his face and he stalked over toward her.
In her haste to get out of the hall, she stumbled over a bag that lay carelessly between the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables. Luckily she caught her balance before she fell. But her foot caught on one of the side pockets and caused something feathery to escape. A bird? No. It was a snitch. Haley reached out to catch it but the little girl on the bench in front of her was quicker.
We both sip at our butterbeers in silence.
She cleared her throat and turned around, a fiery blush dusting her cheeks. She had no right to look this cute.
Draco glared at her. She was too cruel. Would it have killed her to at least pretend she was a little jealous?
"I'll help, too." Ron called, following them, although he glanced back to the others almost regretfully.
"Wow. On top of a liar you're also a thief." The words hurt. They hurt worse than Haley liked to admit. Was that really… what he thought of her?
"She'd never let you." He scoffed.
"Me?" The other girl asked.
Of course he had. Luna was one of his students as well. "You want me tell you who wrote it," he guessed.
"I think I've seen that before." Ron said, interrupting her panicked thoughts. "Isn't that yours, Haley?"
Haley bit her lips. She couldn't bring herself to repeat the words.
"Looks like your plan didn't work out after all." Haley said smugly, her eyes resting on Malfoy's while she grabbed one of the treacle tarts and slowly took a bite, savouring the taste.
Hufflepuff
Malfoy shrugged nonchalantly. "You know… a respectable wizard doesn't kiss and tell," he replied, grinning smugly.
"Your sandwich!"
I snort. “It’s the other way around, actually,” I tell him, cackling amusedly.
Emily trudged back to her with a sigh. "I'm sorry I followed you, okay? I just… saw you in the hall. And then you went down to the dungeons – it… didn't make sense – I wanted to make sure you're not running off. Didn't you get your things done? Where's your… your… you know…" She made a vague gesture that could have meant anything.
This had been a waste of her time from the beginning. How could she have been so stupid? What a fool she was. What was she still doing here? Shouldn't she leave already? What was she waiting for?
How strange.
"I mean, it also considered Ravenclaw – what?" I narrow my eyes at him. "What's that supposed to mean?"
(See the end of the chapter for
At least he was
Draco sighed, raking his free hand through his hair. "So, what did your friends say?"
"No, not yet" Haley replied, squeezing his hand reassuringly. "Maybe I'll ask Pomfrey for another spoonful." She joked.
"I – I mean – you – you won't miss me anyway." Simon admitted, looking at his feet sadly.
It was a good thing that at least Malfoy wasn't wearing the gloves when they finally reached their classmates. He looked away, almost the instant he saw her. But Haley had seen the hint of a smile for a split second. She snorted, looking around for Hagrid. That's when she noticed the thestral. It was beautiful. In a disconcerting way. But it had something elegant and mysterious about it. What had Ron said? Only Neville had been able to see it? Then Hagrid told them that only the people who had seen death were able to see thestrals. Haley's heart sank. She tried very hard not to take that as a bad omen.
He shook his head again. "No. Just tired." His fingers found her chin and lifted it to make her look at his face again. "Nothing you need to worry about. Though it
Draco snorted humourlessly. "Who is?" He shook his head tiredly. "I know you're judging him for being a Death Eater… But he's still my dad."
"Is it… really that easy?" Draco asked hesitantly.
, the voice whispered.
"You were working on a potions essay earlier, weren't you?" The girl inquired.
"You're not… on here though," she wondered. Her godfather chuckled darkly and pointed to a burned hole on the tapestry.
. He remembered a different girl with green eyes. Her face was framed by long red hair and she was smiling. Always smiling. Until she wasn't any more. How ironic. Of all the people, he might be the one person who understood best that it was only too easy to be enthralled by these lovely emerald eyes. He witnessed something bloom on the boy's face like the first flowers opening their petals in spring. Had he realised the truth behind his words only now?
"You know, what she replied?" Haley didn't even wait for him to answer. "She said that people with cold hands are the kindest, because their hearts are warm."
In exactly that wondrous moment the door creaked open behind them.
"No." She shook her head, wondering if this time he
"It's a bit weird, though, isn't it?" She asked, feeling his fingers draw circles on her back soothingly.
"Yes?" He urged, his fingers coming up to trace the outline of her lips, as if the words were written there.
With three spoons of sugar in Malfoy's case. Haley grinned softly, as she absently took a bite from her treacle tart. Treacle tarts were usually really sweet but she imagined Malfoy's tea was even sweeter. By now he was at his fifth spoon of sugar! Did he have a sweet tooth? The thought was strangely endearing. Either that or he didn't realise how much sugar he was spooning into his cup. Haley felt herself grin as the boy lifted his cup to his mouth and took a sip. It didn't seem like he was surprised at the taste.
Hermione's eyes widened as if she had heard her thoughts. "I didn't mean – I wasn't implying that you…" She chewed on her lips unhappily.
"Ron and Hermione," Ginny stated without hesitating, at the same as Haley said,
"What did your acquaintance say, Sev?" Lily asked, stirring her blueberry porridge absently. "Why did he never use magic again?"
"Why else would a guy tell you to meet up at night in a

"What do you mean she's coming here anyway?"
at him.
. She sighed dramatically. Well, maybe she could do this one little favour for her loyal fans. "Fine. I'll have a look at it." She stretched out her hand.
"Well, I don't want to boast or anything buuuut", Myron singsongs, "I do enjoy the majority of our music. And some of our new tunes are really catchy, you know. People love them. They go absolutely crazy about the hippo-" He stops himself and turns accusing eyes at me.
It's funny how hard falling asleep can be after someone tells you to do so. After what felt like hours Haley finally sunk into a deep sleep.
They had barely started on their assignments, when Hermione had declared she couldn't answer one of the questions without looking up a date Binns had mentioned in their fourth year. And being Hermione, she had of course kept her notes from all of their previous years and brought them with her to Hogwarts. It hadn't been more than five minutes since she had left to fetch her notes from their dorms. Naturally that resulted in Ron, dozing off on the table and Haley absently doodling on the margin of the parchment.
"It was less complicated before you started to like him, wasn't it?"
He didn't want to go through that again.
"Do you remember, when I told you about that mean boy from our rival team who always kicked me off my broomstick for fun?"
All of that was not important because something else was demanding her attention. It wasn't something blatantly obvious or physical even.
Sirius cleared his throat importantly. "First, you contact me at least once a week so I know you're still alive." She rolled her eyes but nodded once. She could do that.
"On the train? No, Diagon Alley?"
"Tomten?"Ron echoed. "What's that?"
"It's not that I think no one could ever care about him. I'm sure his parents do." Hermione sighed. "But why should
"Ah, it's you. Teenagers. You should be long asleep, you know. I should make you sleep out here in the hall." The Fat Lady said disapprovingly.
He grinned, excitement filling him up. She was so competitive. He loved it.
"Wow, thanks. I know exactly what you're talking about," I reply with a snort.
"It was actually his idea," he admitted quietly.
"What, so now kissing is okay again?" Haley asked against his lips.
"What are you –?" The girl started to ask, as Draco handed her the box, so that he could wrap the treats up inside a handkerchief. It didn't look as neat as his mother would have done it but it would do. With one hand he took the wooden box from Potter's hands and placed his little snack package inside her open hands. Once the box was safely stored inside his shoulder bag again, he looked up at her.
"Why do you hate him so much?" I dare ask, before I can stop myself.
Clearing his throat, he turned around to where a blanket had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and sat down on one end of it, gesturing for Haley to do the same.
No. That wasn't possible. It wasn't…
"Supper?" Haley exclaimed perplexedly. That meant she had slept for… at least twenty hours!
"I knew it." Haley giggled triumphantly.
"I said
His motto? What could that be? Then something rings at the back of my mind. There were a couple of words inscribed to the back of his special pick… Could it be…?
She pulled her hand out of his grasp and looked away.
Malfoy smirks at me. "Wrong," he says. I get the feeling he's enjoying this immensely. This is weird. I was so sure it would be that song.
So, of course she was surprised, when he addressed her out of the blue.
and not with her friend.
Did she also plan on telling him that it wasn't fair?
"Are they? I kinda sense a story there," she noted, raising an eyebrow.
HALEY
"I guess," she gave in at last. Her heart was beating furiously in her chest. She felt herself losing control over the situation. How was Malfoy doing that?
What did mum say? If my intentions aren't bad, the fire won't hurt me? I take a deep breath and close my eyes, reaching into the cauldron again until… I feel a cool liquid on my skin. At the bottom of the cauldron I feel dozens of keys. Which one is the right one? Should I just pick one and try it out? There is a magnetic pull that leads my fingers to a key somewhere on the left. It's warm to the touch so I close my fingers around it and pull it out of the cauldron.
face.
"No?" Haley echoed in surprise.
That night he couldn't sleep. No matter how many house elves he counted. The thoughts were simply too loud in his head. Had it always been this stuffy in his dorm? He needed some air. The air was always best on the Astronomy tower. Crisp and fresh. Surely, he'd be able to find some sleep after a few deep breaths of night air.
"The hair gel was getting tiresome, you know. Don't think I changed my style because of you or anything." He said in a rather bored tone.
"Oh. I guess, that's where it was."
"And it won't make a difference anyway," Haley said resignedly. "The prat has probably memorised the whole book by now."
"My hair is
"But," He spluttered. "How could she not know? I asked her to go to that couples place together! I wouldn't do that if I didn't want to go out with her! She has to know that!"
"But-"
This time only the second half of the sentence vanished.
Title is inspired by "Will you love me tomorrow" by The Shirells
"Um… how do you know – I mean… since when are you friends with Luna Lovegood?" Haley felt kind of stupid for asking that. It seemed like something she shouldn't have to ask. Something she should already know.
She snaked her arms around the boy, melting further into the embrace. No. Her godfather was wrong. He wasn't using her.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Other things? What kind of other things?"
her, obviously," he drawled, glancing at the girl briefly, curious about her reaction to that. He wasn't hoping she would say something like
So she placed her hand in his and did just that.
For a moment his eyes glow dangerously. Then he spits out one word. "Longbottom."
"No, he isn't," he protested with a frown. "And why would you think my favourite singer was the password?"
"It was a trap." She started to say, glancing at the huge crescent moon, which was her namesake. "We were lured there to get a prophecy."
He was right of course. She wouldn't be able to keep her secret forever. One day, she would have no choice but to tell her friends the truth.
Something fell out of a shelf behind Luna. (His best friend.) Reflexively, Draco looked up from his book and was faced with a sight that gave his heart a painful squeeze.
"What's wrong, dearest brother?" I ask after a moment. He mumbles something unintelligible into his pillow.
Haley sighed. "What now?"
!" She called, shaking his shoulders like mad. When he didn't show any reaction she turned to the two adults accusingly. "What's
"Oh… Yes! Thank you!" He said, taking the remembrall and frowning at the red smoke billowing up inside it. "If only, it told me exactly what I forgot!"
"I can't breathe…" He complained uncomfortably.
"Thought what?" She enquired playfully, leaning in close. He turned to face her again, mouth plopping open and gaze caught in her own.
"I – I wasn't watching Potter!"
"That's how you found out about Malfoy's crush? You've been doing this the whole time? Is it dangerous? How does it work? You should have told me! I mean, you know, it's highly immoral what you did – wait, did you spy on me, too?" Hermione was spewing questions at her like she was some kind of human gargoyle.
"Uh – I –" she started, fumbling with the note in her left hand nervously. She looked to the ground, but of course her words weren't hiding there.
And then Haley was finally off.
Haley sighed. She searched out Neville, who would surely offer her an understanding smile. But the boy wasn't looking at her at all. His gaze was fixed on something behind them. He was worrying at his lip like he was deep in thought.
"Now you have something that belongs to me so you'll be able to visit me in my dreams," she smiled.
Picking up her Magnificent Marauder's Map just in case, she tip-toed out of the dorm. She didn't really have a goal in mind. Somehow, it felt like she was sleep walking. Her mind was foggy and unfocused. Maybe she was still dreaming.
That night when Haley entered the common room after another session with Umbridge, she hadn't expected anyone to still be up. Yet, here they were, two figures sitting in front of the fireplace. At the sound of the portrait opening, they had looked up so Haley recognized the alert faces of Hermione Granger and… Ginny Weasley.
HALEY
"So, do me a favour and
"Went up already," Hermione said around a yawn, "I told him there was some girl stuff we needed to discuss." She grinned wickedly at that. Haley could only imagine how quickly Ron must have left at those words.
The fingers disappeared from her mouth.
Hello angst my old friend, it's you again... Right. I'm not sure if this chapter or the previous one is more angsty... well. There's a bit of fluff in here as well. And some humour :) Anyway, sorry for taking so long to update. It's like I've got no time to write at all :/ (master theses and everything...) Well, let me know your thoughts :)
"Why can't you just..." The Slytherin muttered, raising his left hand slowly until it hovered in front of Haley's face. The way he was
She had never smiled at Draco like that. They were looking at each other for a moment that felt like it lasted for hours.
"Are you hungry?" Haley asked, as the boy sat down next to her. "I brought some sandwiches from the kitchens." She unpacked a couple of sandwiches and additional sweet treats Dobby had practically forced onto her from her bag and spread them out in front of them.
"You were the one who told me not to say her name," Lovegood reminded him, "Besides, I thought it was fitting. Did you know that some people call you the
"I'm going to let you borrow my notes this once but don't just vanish the next time. We were really worried when you didn't show up for Charms."
, Haley thought, as she arrived in front of the doors that lead to the Great Hall. After entering the hall, she made a beeline for the Gryffindor table.
"You know, I can think of one good thing your father has done."
"Fight?" He echoed, raising an eyebrow.
"Um…" Haley said hesitantly. "Is everything-?" Hermione finally looked at her, stopping Haley from continuing to ask her question. There was something hard in her friend's gaze. As if she had erected a wall between her and everything else. Including Haley.
"That yours?" He asked, turning a little paper note around in his hand. Haley froze. It was
was still lying on the table, whereas the one Luna had been studying was gone. It was the one with her golem notes stuck inside it. Her golem notes and the new letter from Sirius Black. Well shit.
"It's not that blasted interview I'm upset about! I – " He sighed, taking a deep breath. "I just wanted her to take my side for once. Just once. And she couldn't do that."
She pinched his cheek. "Bet yours is twice as big, that right?"
"Picturing what?"
"Sorry? What did you say?" Hermione asked.
"Overboard? How?" Lily asked, tilting her head to the side.
"Stop laughing." Neville protested but he had never been able to resist her contagious laughter.
Sirius paused, staring at the ceiling, as if the memories were playing there like a film. "Anyway, Narcissa was showing off her brand new handmade handkerchief – a birthday present with her initials and ornaments and daffodils everywhere… It was exceptionally beautiful, come to think of it. I only found out later that Andy was the one who made it." He tilted his head to the side like the information surprised him still. "In any case, it was apparent that Bella was jealous of her sister's present. Narcissa had always been the most beautiful out of the three and consequently she had always got everything she wanted." Sirius walked toward the opposite wall, where a painting of a snow white cat with big blue eyes was hanging. Haley wasn't sure if she should follow him.
"So what? Look at what he's done to Haley! Look at what he's done to you! We have to do something to make him stop once and for all."
Haley believed him. He sounded so convinced of his words. She felt his lips in her hair and the gesture was so tender that it touched something inside her. Made her feel lightheaded and jittery in a way that had nothing to do with the anxiety she had felt only seconds before.
"Yes," it seemed her non-aggressive reaction was encouraging him, "last year. Don't you remember how I helped you get through all the tasks? Why would I have done that if my goal was to harm you?"
But what? What was she supposed to ask? And did she even have the right to ask him about anything, after the things she'd said to him?
"I just don't want her to get hurt, I guess," she replied with a shrug. It hurt more than it should have. The girl's careless remark about how much of a villain she thought he was. Did she think he would betray his friends at the first chance he got? Did she think he would betray
. She should have known it would turn out this way. Should have listened to her inner voice.
"Don't you think," Hermione leaned close to her, making sure that no one else could hear them. "Don't you think your spell might have worked after all? Maybe it worked and… and damaged something inside him."
Lovegood trained her round, blue eyes on him like she always did.
"I didn't know – I –" She felt so helpless.
"For Slytherin's snake!" Luna agreed with an amused smile.
"What's wrong? Why are you so – I don't know…on edge?"
She scoffed, crossing her arms. "How would you know? You weren't even there."
"Morgana again?" He asked, "How many does that make now?"
"More for us then," Simon chimes happily, stuffing his rosy face with popcorn. He smiles at me and in that moment the sun rises an inch, giving his face an iridescent glow. It catches on the bracelet he's wearing. Isn't that one of mum's? It's got a tiny red dragon charm on it. But that's not important now. I need to focus. I feel like we were talking about something very important just now.
"That's true. But since he's not on the run any more–" She stopped, suddenly afraid she had said too much. What was she thinking, telling him all of these details?
DRACO
"What… do you mean?" She asked cautiously.
And luckily there was a small opening between two shelves that he was able to squeeze through. Another step to the left and he was mostly hidden from the view of anyone who was possibly coming to his and Lovegood's corner. And just in time it seemed.
"What in Merlin's name-!" She glared at Malfoy who was standing in front of the thick root she'd caught her foot in, and smirked lazily at her.
"You should do that," she encouraged him instead, "That way everyone wins."
"I think we've missed our chance with the glumbumble." Neville said with a heavy sigh.
"As much as I'd love to blame Longbottom for this…" He shook his head. "I know it was my own foolishness. I should never have carelessly tried out a spell I knew positively nothing about."
The girl bit her lips but the smile came through anyway. "I told you. It's special wool that keeps your fingers extra warm." Looking at the boy who seemed so delighted over a pair of knobbly mittens, Haley felt a warm pull in her stomach and a sudden desire to keep seeing that expression on his face. She liked being the one who put it there.
He only hoped he hadn't come to that decision too late.
"Shush. We've worried enough for a decade. We should do something fun now." She looked at his red, shadowed eyes that screamed SLEEP DEPRIVED. "Feel like taking a nap?"
a child?
Storming out of the Great Hall was both stupid and overly dramatic. Dramatic because everyone was eating and she was running toward the doors like a lunatic. And stupid because she had no idea where she was going or where to begin looking for the boy she was in search of.
. Did he seriously want to know? It was strange. Being asked so suddenly… She couldn't think of an answer.
"Exactly," Haley said, as she placed a slice of blueberry pie onto her plate. She picked up a piece with her fork and brought it up to her mouth. It tasted delicious.
Hedwig clucks her tongue impatiently. "Have you found out yet?"
," he objected, "What a
"I didn't…" Had he said that out loud? He shook his head. "It's nothing."
"Oh?" Luna said, raising an eyebrow. It oddly reminded Haley of the way Malfoy always raised his blond eyebrows at her. "That's ironic," Luna said quietly in a way that didn't sound amused at all.
There was weariness in Malfoy's gaze as he raised his head and looked at her. "What is that supposed to mean?" He asked, mildly disconcerted.
The question was easy. The answer was anything but.
"Look," she sighed. "there's no time. I'll explain later, okay?" She turned around, hoping he'd leave it at this. Of course, he didn't.
"You're cheating", the girl said, giggling, "It's not my fault you're rubbish at this."
His body, too, slowly dispersed into tiny grains like it was made of sand…
Draco squinted his eyes slightly at her. "That doesn't make her my friend though. I could have threatened her… or blackmailed her even." Well, that sounded reasonable enough to his ears.
"You absolute git!" She screeched, getting up from her seat. She wished she could simply vanish into thin air. But perhaps dramatically rushing out of the Great Hall would be enough for the moment? She proceeded to do exactly that when a voice stopped her from taking even one step.
"I figured." He sent her a sympathetic look. "Do you want me to talk some sense into him?"
is disgusting?" He questioned. Then his gaze hardened to grey steel. "Trust me, you don't want to find out just how disgusting I
"And finally," Sirius said, pushing his goddaughter slightly away so he could look into her eyes. "I want you to think about whether you're really sure about this. About him. You know, as well as I do that his father is a Death Eater. He's a dangerous man and if you ever," he paused, his grey eyes full of urgency, boring into her green ones like he was trying to look into her soul. She swallowed nervously. "If you ever feel only the slightest doubt about him or his intentions, you can't hesitate. You have to end it immediately. Do you understand?"
The tears didn't stop. She kept crying until there were none left any more.
I try not to roll my eyes. "You're already sleeping."
"This is stupid!" With a sweep of his hand he made her chopsticks whirl all across the table. "I thought you'd be – It's not supposed to be like this! You were so much more fun in my dreams." He muttered that last part in a way that seemed like he hadn't meant to say it out loud.
"Shit," He whimpered, hissing in pain. Merlin, she had completely forgotten about the boy who needed her support. She reached out for him, before he lost his balance and steadied him, winding her arm around his waist once more.
"Well, what can you do?" Ron mused teasingly.
He nodded once. "Alright. Something simple." Then he pointed his wand at a miniature guitar, hanging above the desk. She hoped he wasn't going to
"Huh?" Haley asked in confusion.
I can't believe this stupid trick has actually worked a second time. The boy jumps forward in surprise only a bit but it's enough to reveal what he's been working on. And what I see then, nearly takes my breath away.
Was he worrying about her? What a ridiculous thought.
Haley raised an eyebrow at that.
I don't know why or what exactly triggers it but suddenly I'm in her lap, clutching her tightly and sobbing into her shirt.
"I don't think you will." Draco said mysteriously, before reaching behind his neck and fumbling with something that looked like a silver necklace. After having unclasped it, he pulled the necklace out from under his robes and held it up for her.
"I never thought, I'd ever have a reason to feel bad for Snape." Haley continued. "He didn't do
Draco clears his throat. “One… is the person I… resent the most and the other…” He stares at my arm. I think I know what he’s going to say. “The person… I care about… the most.”
"You could… say that." Snape confirmed.
Malfoy scoffed. "But it's December! Surely, we could have found a different place? Something indoors? Where it's warm?" He argued, completely ignoring her second statement.
"No, of course not, but-"
"Do you.. dislike me then?" Malfoy asked.
"You tripped me!" She accused him, pushing his hands off her.
"What if she didn't?" Haley mumbled mostly to herself.
assignment!" He exclaimed in horror. He bit his lips, probably wondering if it was worse to arrive late to Umbridge's class or to be on time but without an assignment. "I should probably go back to the tower and get it. Sorry." He added, looking at her apologetically.
But no. She couldn't think like that. She needed to keep up the wall that kept everyone out. Numbness was the path she'd chosen…
He rose to his feet again. "It's the password."
Before she could do anything to stop it, the Slytherin raised his hand and squashed the cupcake against her forehead, smearing it all over her hair. Haley closed her eyes and balled her shaking hands to fists. She wanted to
"We should invite Neville," I propose casually. This could either be a big mistake or my chance to finally get some answers.
"The snitch!" I exclaim excitedly, pointing toward the window on the opposite wall.
"I…" She started to say, looking for the right words. "Because I…"
. Or more accurately:
down. Somehow, she was more upset than him, it seemed. Or maybe it had been the sight of her distress that had brought him to his senses.
The boy just stared at her in confusion.
I know, I know, I took forever again. But look at that! It's a chapter that's 9,700 words long! The longest chapter I wrote to this day. Impressive, huh? I think it's one of my favourites :) Fun fact: There was this one scene where Haley and Draco were fighting that reminded me so much of Ygritte and Jon Snow and I wanted to use the line "You know nothing, Jon Snow!" so bad but I couldn't because well... it wouldn't have worked as well as it does for Ygritte... But I still think Draco should have just said it. "You know nothing, Haley Potter!"
"What?" She said, when he placed his left hand on her cheek, making her face him. He angled her face every which way, frowning slightly.
There was something in his voice that sent shivers down the girl's spine. What was it he wanted to show her? Or even worse, was there nothing he wanted to show her at all? Had he just said that because he had recognized the letter? Because he knew it was actually an
There was a big black dragon in front of her… her mum and dad were waving at her from the other side of a magical mirror… Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground, all the light gone from his eyes…
As soon as I would leave her office I would feel someone's eyes on me." She shuddered.
"I'm sure you'll get your letter soon," I give his hand a gentle squeeze.
Then the Fat Lady gasped loudly. "Don't tell me you're meeting
Hearing a suspicious noise really should have worried Haley. And it did worry her but at the same time she felt relieved for the distraction it provided. She liked kissing Malfoy. As crazy as that sounded she could admit that. And she had already admitted it to herself. But… from the looks of it the boy had been about to tell her something… something that she wasn't ready to deal with yet. So she had been glad at the chance to escape his intense eyes for a moment. It was eerily quiet in the hall that opened toward the observation deck and the moonlight didn't provide much light. Where had the noise come from? She had almost reached the stairs when she spotted something shiny lying in front of one of the windows. Carefully she approached the thing and knelt down in front of it. It was a telescope. Nothing more, nothing less. She sighed in relief. Someone had probably forgotten it on the window sill during one of the Astronomy lessons and the wind had caused it to fall down. Right? That seemed logical enough. From the corner of her eyes she registered a sudden movement. What was-?
"Did you think owls can't dream? Or even speak?" Hedwig asks, sounding offended.
As soon as the door was shut, Haley sank to the ground, suddenly bereft of all energy.
"About yesterday," he whispered. He was half-sitting, half-leaning against one of the desks, while Haley's back was pressed to the wall opposite him, next to the door. Ready to bolt.
Finally, everything was back to normal. Haley was having breakfast with her best friends. At her own table. Everything was like it should be. She didn't have to look in the direction where Neville was sitting. She didn't have to bear the endless questions of the Creevey siblings. She could simply enjoy her breakfast in peace. All was well. Peachy even.
"I don't know, is that what it's called?"
. Draco Malfoy was
He snorted again. "Very funny." Haley sighed.
"Really?" Haley rolled her eyes. "She'll wonder where I am."
That smirk. He was such a disgustingly posh prat. "I'm not your house elf."
Ron nodded, stifling a yawn.
"Some Gryffindor, you are," he said with a snort. "They're just fairies."
Malfoy shakes his head, his eyes are so wide, they might pop. He bites his lips again. "Can I touch them?" He asks. He deserves a slap for such an incredulous suggestion.
Of course Draco was aware of that. Wasn't there a bloody spell for everything?
For some reason the thought made him feel sick. He'd always wanted to be just like his father. But now he wasn't sure about that any more.
Draco is a pining mess
"But – who?"
"If what?" She asked expectantly.
"You're not planning to fall asleep on me, are you?" Draco asked softly.
Draco seemed slightly stunned as well. He looked around wildly as if he was searching for something to grab and throw against a wall. When he didn't find anything, he ran his hand through his hair in frustration. "You don't know what it's like," he growled in a low pained voice. "Getting my hopes up and having them crushed every single time." He ran his hand through his hair in frustration. "You want to help me? Then don't make me go through that torture again."
As he kept looking for
Feather :)
"So… you weren't sleeping," Potter questioned, biting her lips like she was trying not to grin.
"I found it. It's just been up here waiting to be found."
She raised her eyebrows. Was that all? No other reaction?
Hey everyone! So, finally, there's a confrontation! And a... resolve :D I bet you didn't expect that, did you? Let me just tell you, we're moving into the next arc now and there's still a lot more to tell. In case you were wondering. Glumbumbles are an actual thing. I found them in Phantastic beasts (book) and found them quite interesting. And what did you think about the Neville/Malfoy scene? Any suspicions or ideas? As always leave me your thoughts and thanks for reading :)
Haley shook her head, trying not to grin. "What did you do to my boyfriend?" She muttered, frowning in mock-confusion.
Was it possible that her mum had already found a solution to the problem? Impossible. But clearly, she wanted to talk to her in person about it. So, before going to sleep that night, Haley armed herself with her mum's hair clasp and a portion of optimism.
"Hm." Professor Snape hummed thoughtfully. "I wonder… have you noticed anything else unusual about Longbottom?" He didn't sound accusative at least. Just… curious.
"Definitely." She agreed. "Just a little less wild and… er… more boyish and…"
The girl cleared her throat. "It's Creevey. Not creepy. Also, that's a pretty old joke." She sent Haley a glare. Hm. It looked as though she wasn't as much of a fan of Haley as her big brothers. She'd have to be more careful with her.
This was not what Haley had thought her first real kiss was going to be like. Whatever she had expected it was certainly not this: Spread out on a picnic blanket with Draco Malfoy. Well, the picnic blanket was not the unusual part. It was a rather comfortable picnic blanket.
that." Weasley scoffed.
," she added, almost as an afterthought, vanishing the milky mess around them.
Haley stopped. She'd walked past a room that seemed as inconspicuous as any other room on the floor. Maybe it was that fact that made it all the more suspicious. There was no light shining through the door gap. It wasn't even closed properly. Usually, closed and barricaded doors were the most enticing. Doors screaming "
"Completely. The only side effect is throwing up hairballs," he added with a grimace. Haley lifted an eyebrow and slipped the candy into her pocket.
, Draco thought.
"This doesn't make any sense without Hermione. What's taking her so long anyway?" Ron mumbled, as he frustratedly shoved his assignment for History of Magic away from him.
"Morning." Ron seemed nervous for some reason. "Can you believe that Hermione already went to the library? Before Breakfast?"
"And the brooms? Might as well tell her that I'm incapable of riding a broom without falling off." He hadn't meant to say that. His voice sounded self-pitying even to his own ears. He wished he could remove the memory from his brain. And preferably from Potter's, too.
"Sorry. Did he wake you?" She asked, slowly pulling her left arm out from under Draco's body.
"Thank you," the Ravenclaw answered with a cheerful smile. Ron dropped one of the turnips. He didn't even seem to notice.
George followed her eyes with an amused grin. He chuckled. "Come on. We'd never use the spell on a girl, jokester's honour," he assured her.
, was it 'partnership' or 'defence'?"
Haley shared a panicked look with Hermione. What was she supposed to do now? Her friend made a gesture as if she was stroking something and Haley started to stroke the girl's long red hair tentatively. It seemed to calm her somewhat. When it seemed that she had cried enough Ginny pulled away from her, brushing away the last few tears with her sleeve.
"I also found some crumpled notes that looked interesting but there wasn't enough time to go through them."
"Really." Haley reached out her hand and helped the other girl up. "With this, there's no way, we'll lose."
The boy shrugged. "Does it really matter? I'm not
"Perhaps…" Hermione started, but she interrupted herself, "Merlin! Do you know how late it is? We should have gone to sleep ages ago!"
And aside from that… Haley didn't know why the thought of Malfoy crossed her mind just then.
Draco snorts, leaning away from me and dropping his hand. "That's a pity. Maybe you should dye it then."
"Ravenclaw?" I test the word on my tongue, liking the sound of it. Maybe he's right. Draco smiles at me and nods, brushing away a strand of hair from my face with his other hand. His fingers trace along my cheek with a gentleness that startles me.
"Maybe we both need a Reverse Fool Potion," the girl commented. For once Draco wholeheartedly agreed with her.
Also, in case you were wondering, why I left so many questions unanswered... I mean there has to be some interesting stuff left for the sequel - or threquel at this point - or not?
"So…there's a Hogsmeade trip coming up next weekend. I thought you might like – I mean -" He stopped when he saw the unimpressed expression on her face.
"I'm fine. There's no need to get into a fight because of me." She lifted her head from where it had been resting on her arms and looked at her two friends in a way that was meant to be assuring.
"Are you… laughing at me?" The boy inquired, still glaring at her. Haley just shrugged, trying to stop herself from laughing. But that was easier thought than done.
"I'm just asking. Am I not allowed to ask?" Hermione rolled her eyes.
"You weren't exactly friendly though," Ron argued. What even? He was such a hypocrite!
Haley sank to the ground, leaning against the tree and sighed. She couldn't deal with the suspense. She still didn't know what her friend
Stay positive and happy, everyone :)
"I knew you were all talk, Pot-"
"I promise," Haley reassured her. "Gryffindor's honour." She reached out her hand and with positively shining eyes the little girl took a hesitant step toward her.
"You-" He exclaimed, reaching for her hand. "Give that back!" But the girl was already jumping backwards. She held the small festively wrapped up box up in the air and shot a triumphant grin at him.
Draco's hands clenched at the mention of that prat.
"Tonks' mother made this?" She asked, quietly. The needlework was truly beautiful. From what she could see.
I should take to my heels and run.
all over it. And they're
I want to push him away but there are ice cream cones in both of my hands. Sneaky bastard. How bloody convenient for him.
"Quick, take their wands," Umbridge instructed. Pity, that none of the spells had hit
For a long moment he stared at the yellow hair tie thoughtfully. Then he sighed tiredly and slung his arms around her, pulling her into his lap. "Just don't lie to me." He whispered into her hair like he was telling her a secret. "I've already lost so much… I don't want to lose you, too."
"See? I told you it was going to work." Called a voice from above.
Haley had the urge to do the exact opposite of her words but it was obvious how much effort it took the other girl to even admit she was worried. To seek her out first. Coming from Hermione, this was almost as good as a heartfelt apology. And Haley was tired of fighting anyway. So, she swallowed down her pride and scooted over to the side.
over something like
Had she gotten it all wrong? What was she supposed to ask? What did any of this mean?
I can tell he's just teasing but that doesn't stop me from teasing back. "You dye it first," I challenge, lifting an eyebrow.
She slapped his hand away. Lightly. "You didn't see yourself. After you took the potion…" She closed her eyes, trying not to actually bring the memory back to the surface. "It was terrible." She continued in a whisper. "You weren't breathing… I… of course I was worried." She gave his shoulder a shove. For good measure.
She didn't know why she was hesitating. Or maybe she did know but it was hard to admit it. Hidden under her Invisibility Cloak she could watch the boy all she wanted without having to fear being caught. Did she like him? As a friend? Or as more than that? She wasn't sure. Didn't know what to call that prickling feeling that arose every time she saw him. It was so different from anything she had felt before.
"Okay," Potter whispered and made Draco's heart sink like a stone that was trying to reach the bottom of the Great Lake. "I'll think about it," she added.
Haley pulled at a loose thread on the coat she was kneeling on. "I really like…" she started to say, looking up at the boy who was staring at her expectantly. She grinned. "When you're wearing your hair like this." She nodded at his blond locks that were framing his face softly. Devoid of any gel.
"See? I'm good with children." Haley beamed, clutching Draco's arm tighter.
“Returning the favour,” I grin, wondering what his favourite animal might be. A snake perhaps? I make sure he doesn’t peek and start drawing. The snake turns out looking especially cunning. What about the other? The way he’s pouting in that moment, he reminds me of one of Simon’s kittens. I try not to smirk as I sketch a little kitten on the boy’s arm. It’s one of those Persian ones that always look like they’re offended. It suits him, I think.
"Sorry," she whispered. "Are you okay?"
"When?"
"Um… it looked fun… It's a shame I never took Ancient Runes," Haley replied, opening the thick volume that was titled
She turned to Draco in confusion. "What kind of password is that? And how'd you know it?"
So… what to do? She was sure with Hermione's help they'd be able to fix Draco's magic in no time. On the other hand… would Hermione even help her? Currently, she was in OWL mode and exams and revision were the only thing she wanted to talk about. She had been quite mad already when Haley explained to her where she'd been the previous afternoon… and night.
(See the end of the chapter for
She couldn't imagine ever having despised this boy. His eyebrows were scrunched up in concentration. They were so white. Almost invisible on his pale face.
"He–" Neville rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, it's not like he didn't have a reason – I mean, it's understandable – he wanted to ask you out and I – if it had been me–"
She took another look around the hall as if any moment someone was going to show up next to her and tell her what to do. But no one did. Everyone was too busy with their own food. Well, except a scrawny cat, slipping into the hall and slinking her way past thousands of student feet. Mrs Norris.
“Why?” She asked cautiously instead of answering because she didn’t know what else to tell him. This wasn’t exactly a topic she wanted to talk about with her ex-boyfriend. Especially, while they were still testing out how to be friends again.
"There
"Who built this?" She burst out curiously.
I place my fingers on the strings and begin to pluck the intro to
"You can stop with the pretence now. Nobody's watching." Haley said, not backing down. She didn't understand why he was still keeping up his pointless act. They were alone, weren't they? There was no reason for him to still act that way. Unless… But no. Any second now, he would tell her she'd been right. Maybe he was simply afraid, she was still mad or something.
This time though, Haley made an effort not to turn her head in a crazy manner. Instead, she turned her head slowly and with more dignity. For a second her eyes stopped at Ginny's expression of surprise and – was she blushing?
Professor Snape picked up his fork once more. "He wanted to get rid of the follower who had betrayed him, of course. In doing that, just like you, he came across the forgotten notes of a student who had a fondness for experimenting with the Dark Arts." His gaze seemed far in the distance somewhere.
"Really? I didn't know that. That's fascinating. But – uhm… so I wanted to ask you something," Haley said, trying to steer the conversation toward the topic she wanted to talk about.
The question threw him off so bad that he answered without thinking about the words.
Hello hello! I know, this is terribly short but my original draft was so freakishly long that I had to cut it off somewhere. To make up for the short chapter I will post the next one within the next few days, so stay tuned for that :) And i can tell you that some things you guys have beeen waiting for are going to happen in the next chappy ;)
"What?" She asked in a dangerous voice.
"I know." Haley sighed.
He rolled his eyes. "Right back at you, Potter. Are you all talk or shall we get started?"
Haley shrugged. "I mean, there have to be people who read it, right? At least they're not writing all the rubbish the
"You're incredible." Draco interrupted her.
"Well, why did you do it then?" The atmosphere around them felt electrified, as they quietly stared at one another.
"All right. I won't ask. You don't have to say anything." It hurt seeing her like this. Distraught and panicked and out of her depth. It didn't suit her.
"Well, someone asked whether he was the chief editor of the
Or maybe even,
"I know you didn't mean it," she stated, determination, making her words sound more powerful.
He shook his head. Then he leaned in to kiss her gently. Too gently. She pulled back, looking up at the ceiling that was made of glass. It was already getting dark.
"Hello Haley!" Someone called her name. She turned in the direction of the voice. Colin Creevey. The president of her own personal fan club. Well, actually he was the president of the Gryffindor quidditch team fan club. And since her dad still counted as a legend, the worship had somehow transferred to her.
"Stop looking at me like-" She started to say but stopped herself because her voice now sounded deep like Uncle Vernon's.
"Er…" She had noticed Ron's strange behaviour around the Ravenclaw, of course. But she hadn't thought… that it was something as serious as Hermione had phrased it.
I flex my fingers and get ready to play the solo one more time. It's a tiny bit too slow but beside that it's flawless.
"There are more of them in my bag. I've been using them to practise the
"So?" She pressed impatiently.
"To be fair, Haley didn't know about the interview until the moment, she saw us sitting around a table with Rita."
"Hedwig!" I yell in exasperation. I can't believe this. She is flying with her back to the ground now. And her soft chuckling tells me that this is purely intentional.
No wonder she had been confused when Draco wasn't giving her a chance to understand him. He hadn't even been able to properly confess his feelings to her. And then it happened seemingly all on its own. All of the walls he had so carefully constructed were crumbling down around him and suddenly there was nothing but
The way she was smiling up at him looked slightly forced. Something was off about her today. Was she still troubled because of her friends?
. There's nothing else between us. Nothing!" She was starting to get an idea why her friend was so invested in this.
I reach for the acoustic guitar that's leaning against the door and strum over each string once.
Hello everyone! So now you hopefully have an idea how the whole dreaming thing works! I hope the whole POV and tense change is not too confusing but I wanted to create a different feel for the dream world and the real world. Next chapter it's time to get back to Hogwarts! Thank you so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos! It really means a lot!
"I don't even know why I'm laughing about this." He finally said, after the laughter had gained a slightly hysterical touch. "I mean, it's hardly fair that you know all about my dreams and I don't even know when you were there stalking me and when you weren't."
"Nothing," Haley repeated, swiping at her face. "It's just… watching those two… I…" She shook her head. "I… remembered something."
They were sitting on the mossy ground in one of the green houses late at night. Most of the plants seemed to be sleeping. It was calming somehow.
"Then why…?"
"Isn't that a hobby of yours?" He asked. "Painting?"
Her friend took a step back, clouds darkening his eyes. "No," he whispered, shaking his head. "This doesn't make any sense!" He shouted. "Why him? He's a Slytherin! Have you forgotten everything he's done to us? What he called

"Oh, I see. You have already given up then? Well, infatuations like these come and go-"
"This is a dream. You can stop trying to fall asleep now." I tell him patiently.
"What was
"Mum?" I ask, using my hand like a fan to make the steam disappear. Slowly, two figures become visible. Two figures, standing in front of a huge cauldron. One with red and the other with black hair. Through the fog, I can hear soft chuckles.
"Do you," Draco whispered slowly, "do you think it's too late?"
Mum has her back to me. Her hair is up in a messy bun and she's wearing pastel orange coveralls that clash terribly with her hair. She's sitting on the floor, cross-legged with a huge paint brush in her hand. The wall of the room in front of her is already partly painted a deep sky blue.
I frown, shaking my head. "This is so weird," I whisper in return.

"But what if something
But perhaps it was the reminder of the houses. Their rivalry. Maybe it had worked like a trigger, reminding him that they weren't supposed to get along. Hufflepuff. Ravenclaw. Slytherin. Gryffindor. Those houses. Hermione had always thought that it was stupid to split everyone up like that. To squeeze people who were only children into categories and put labels on them. To divide them and make them compete against each other. Wouldn't it be better to encourage unity and togetherness? Especially now, it was important to stick together and not let marginal differences further divide each other. It was always us and them. She wondered if there would have been a war, without the constant rivalry and animosity between Slytherin and the rest of the houses. Perhaps. Perhaps not. But the way it looked, they were just at the edge of a second wizarding war. Unless people started to learn from the past for once. But maybe this was a sign.
"Are you okay? Did he hurt you? What happened?" He asked, looking her over worriedly.
I want him to always smile like that. I don't want him to wake up and long for a dream he can never achieve.
Another heavy silence followed and Haley already regretted having said anything at all. She noticed Ron sending Hermione a pointed look that Hermione answered with a similar one. She seemed both frustrated and helpless.
She hadn't even made the decision but somehow she was kissing him. Her arms wrapped around his neck and pressing closer, closer. There was no space between them. There was too much space between them. He was all around her and she was drowning in him. In his love for her. Or maybe… in their love for each other? Did it matter? As long as he made her feel like this, what else was there to worry about?
Instead of answering, Haley pushed her brother into her own room and shut the door between them.
Haley wondered what this fresh new promising Thursday was going to bring. It seemed that everything was possible. Suddenly, spring was in the air and there was a bright glow about the whole castle. Not even the Creeveys annoyed her. Much. She even found their current topic in History of Magic interesting (something about a group of magicians who invented the branch of culinary magic). Or less boring than usual. After the lesson was over, she got ready to have lunch with her best friends. Maybe it was even warm enough to eat outside? That would be nice.
"You wait," he said, ignoring the surprised expression on Haley's face.
." She whined, turning her rat translucent instead of camouflaging it. She could see its tiny heart like this, thumping violently behind a pale ribcage. Did her own heart look the same? "He didn't even
"Ah, making sure, nobody can overhear this time. That's thoughtful," George commented. Ah. So he had sound-proofed the room.
Hermione didn't have to do more than glance at her wrist pointedly. Even though she wasn't wearing the leather band, she pulled down the sleeves of her robes swiftly.
DRACO
Haley placed her hand on his mouth, trapping the words, that only brought him down further, inside.
"Are you looking for this?" Neville asks with a smirk.
"She liked… to try out all kinds of things…" Luna explained, a soft smile on her face. "She would invent new potions or create new spells…" Her smile turned slightly sad. "One day one of her experiments… went terribly wrong."
"I don't caaaare," Haley sang, echoing his tone. After another moment she finally released him.
"I'm bored" Sirius complained for the umpteenth time. "Wish it was full moon."
" Haley frowned.
"Don't be foolish. I don't hate it," he whispered, almost tonelessly.
The Great Hall in Malfoy’s dream looks so much like its equivalent in the real world that I wonder whether I’m dreaming or not for a confusing moment. But it has to be a dream. I walked through the boy’s dream door only a second ago. Automatically, my feet lead me toward the Gryffindor table but then I realise that the person, I’ve come to visit most likely sits somewhere else.
DRACO
She bit her lips, trying to ignore the blush she felt creeping into her face. And weren't his cheeks reddening as well? Haley snorted. They had to look like two shy third years who were dancing around each other. A crowd of people was already forming around them, staring at them curiously. She reminded herself that she was the one in control here. She could handle this. Whatever he wanted to tell her. Sooner or later she would have to confront this anyway. It was best to just get that conversation out of the way, she decided.
Her throat was starting to burn.
"I mean… did it really surprise you that she mentioned your father?"
," Malfoy whispered with an amused grin. Haley rolled her eyes over his childishness. For a moment it seemed as if there was something else he wanted to say but he stayed silent.
"Was he bad at kissing?" Haley questioned, slightly confused.
"Malfoy?"

Hermione frowned. "You have to admit it's a little strange that Malfoy suddenly shows interest in you. And his father

"So, what do you think of this?" He asked, pointing at their surroundings. "Could use some colour, don't you think?"
