"It's for your own good, Harry." Bill said. He was leaning against the door frame as he was looking over at us with guilt in his eyes.
"I suggest for you not to touch the knife, Professor Hagrid." Malfoy moved it away. "This is an ancestry knife, and only the ones with the blood of the Malfoy clan can touch it and if it is then held by someone less, the blade will automatically cut the holder."
"How-" I began to utter but caught myself from asking. I blushed as I realize I was about to open up, of all people, is with Malfoy.
"What's wrong, Mom?" Fred asked as he straightens up from his chair. The usual sleepy atmosphere was gone in a second.
"I don't know, Harry," Remus said as his eyes evaded eye contact with mine. My eyes narrowed in suspicion.

"Now, now. Mr. Finnigan. You don't have to be so impatient. I will explain them to you all. I just need the others to also listen. This is, after all, a class." Malfoy sneered at us.
Day and night were the same to me, the only blessing to my mind is when I was too tired that I knock myself to sleep.
"Don't!" I screamed as I tried to scramble from my weak legs, standing in front of Harry trying to protect him then I took a run to grab onto Malfoy's arm. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have worked! But this...I just don't know what to do anymore! Please, Malfoy help us!"
Oliver and Angelinarace over to take the notebook but Angelina was faster to grab it with force and started flipping the notebook. "So, you Ravenclaws have been spying on us. And this little notebook contains all of our strategies that you all have gathered. When did the Ravenclaws act like a Slytherin?"
The three of us had no choices but to run into the dark tunnel and as we enter in our absolute dismay and horror at the end of the dark, the wide and concave tunnel is a dead-end.
As soon as I saw his face, memories started to flood in and I remembered what happened. Seeing my confused state, Malfoy patiently waited for me to caught up. An act that I appreciate, especially, coming from him. As flashes of memories start to overflow and almost overpower me, Malfoy slowly made his way towards me. Then, surprisingly, he places his now healed hand over my forehead.
"Father" Draco uttered with a strained voice. "You promised that you wouldn't do anything unsightly just for this day." Draco, with a bored look, talking down to his father like he was scolding an infant. "This is an important day, Father." He stopped to emphasized. "If you can't do that. You can go home. I will tell mother that you can't come because of an -" He halts for a second to think of a word. " itch, you can't suppress."
"That's true," Draco said as he runs his fingers through his hair in a relaxed manner. "You should also sleep, Harry. You need to rest."
Those three words felt like more of a goodbye than its real indication. His acceptance of his end. The satisfaction of his act of love for me. I stared at him, gnawing pain and realization dawn unto me. More tears fell from my eyes. A cry of mourning escape from my lips.
I relished the taste of the meat inside my mouth, I was in bliss and disgusted with myself but my hunger overpowered my rationality. Enjoying it, I chewed at it, slowly. Then suddenly, the demon laughed.
"What I do know is I like you, not in a friendly way, more of..." I trailed off as I could not put the right word into it.
"I took these books under the permission of Professor Dumbledore from the library." She uttered as she places the stacks of books on the wooden small table and took one for herself then began scanning it. "Here, Harry." She said as she took another book and gave it to me. "We need all the resources, we could get to find any clue or any information on regards to your condition."
Now, that I think about it. There was something different about him. He still got the arrogant aura, aristocratic robes, slick smooth down white hair that seems to have grown out to shoulder length since the last time I have seen him. His face that still had the sharp edges, had become more adult-like, more of his mother than of his father. He was the image of his father with the mellow and softness of his mother. But what was so different was his facial expression and his stormy grey eyes - held sincerity and the sadness in them instead of the usual smirk and presumptuous look. I wonder what had happened.
I took a moment to rearrange my thoughts and inhale air and slowly release my breath as I also try to release my nerves with it.
'I... I don't know anymore what to do. I am lost. I need... I need help. I don't want to do this match. I just want to... stop this! I need a break. Hang on there! Hermione and Ron are still there by your side...' I muttered repeatedly inside my head as I stood still in the midst of my teammates. It was a good thing, that all of them were nervous that even the twins: Fred and George, had not noticed my weird behavior.
'Thank you, Malfoy for saving Harry! Thank you! Thank you!'  I continuously thanks Malfoy, my voice cracked and my sobs suddenly erupted from my body, as at last the reality of almost losing Harry hits me hard.
“I would! I like to!” I answered with so much vigor that made him, laugh at my antics. Yet, his laughter made me feel so hazy from its sound, and a small electric tingle passes by my whole body with so much glee. ‘Shit! I feel like I just like those squealing girls. This is so embarrassing!!!’
But instead, Hermione lowered her head, feeling sorry for him. Ron looked even ashamed and awkward. Neville, Seamus, and Dean took the moment to slide to the edge of the room and quiet down.
"Hey!!!" Ron complained but seemed to lighten up as the misunderstanding on his part had been cleared. "Sorry, Harry. I guess I was just tired."
"Your intention is good but the result will be devastating." He said seriously. "Your goal will cause death for the house-elves. Their extinction."
"No," I said, with a bitter tone to it. "They seem to end our relationship with just this..." I pointed myself as I was sure my features were already changing. My eyes were still green but a red hue appeared in the middle of my iris seems to remain, skin paled but unlike Draco's, mine was more of a greyish hint that looks so unhealthy, my height shot up which I enjoyed as a side effect of my transformation but my ears and teeth have lengthened and my nails stay sharp even if I cut them every day. "But who I am kidding. Why would they remain with me when I am becoming a horrible monster. As for Sirius and Remus, I'll talk with them when the time comes."
We had a productive afternoon that day as we actually listed down and summaries the things about the possibility of what creature I may have become and the list of the observed abilities that I have again. Hermione jots it down on a long parchment- written with remarks on parenthesis. I took it to re-read it again, not wanting to miss anything.
I stayed like that sit bent and hidden in my hands for how long, I don't remember. I just cried my heart out in front of Hermione and Draco.
She got up from her seat, coming to me and tug my sleeves. I frowned at her as I was still angry at her for that incident.
"What do you think is the meaning of these dreams?" I asked. I had to admitted I am greatly disturbed by the constant visit of these dreams but also it was weird, scary and it felt real.
“Okay. Wear something warm. Draco said we will be going outside, today. Something about testing your abilities.” Hermione uttered. “See you in the kitchen. We’ll be having breakfast first.”
Silence reign over. A minute had pass by. Yet no one spoke. No sound can be heard except for the sobs that once in a while came from Ginny as she embraces my right hand, hard.

Tears flowed from my eyes, as grieve and relief flooded within me. I return her embrace. "Sorry! Sorry!! I am so sorry, Hermione!!!" I choke within my tears and cries. "And thank you!"
"Remus about those ruins, I wanted to talk about it. Everything from what and why Sirius and Bellatrix were there? What was the thing that we saw in there?"
"So, what is this experiment that both of you are talking about?" I asked at last as I couldn't handle the quietness and my curiosity is killing me.
Hermione, from my side, raised one of her eyebrows in confusion and skeptically looks at me which made me calmed down. I scold myself for making an uncomfortable scene.
Then Professor McGonagall unrolls a large scroll of parchment and began. "When I call your name, you will sit on this chair" She pointed to the four-legged chair in front of her then continued. "I will place the hat on your head and the hat will announce your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table."
I was lay at the center of the queen-sized bed, still in a daze. I slowly stood up and walk up to the door then I realized that I don't have my wand in my person. I started to contemplate what should I do when I don't have anything on me to defend myself or anyone to tell me what is going on.
"E-Excuse me!" I shot up from my seat and headed out to the nearest comfort room. I almost didn't reach it as I stumbled on the way. Fred and George were already on my side and helped me until I reached the toilet bowl and I gave a heaved. I sank to my knees, feeling weak. Tears begin to form. My throat hurts from the acid of my stomach. My stomach kept churning and twisting. One hurl after another, it keeps coming. Until I could feel relief as all the contents of my stomach were out.
I saw what she meant, at the table in front of Malfoy, is a single flower - a white lily tied with a silk black ribbon. A symbol of mourning. I totally forgotten my sinking feeling of disappointment for Sirius' letter not arriving, it was nothing to what Malfoy should be feeling right now. His brother, who died long ago. Murder unjustly by a group of muggles. Then now somebody disrespected his brother's grave and even had the tenacity to steal his body.
"Anyway, I would want to say my 'thanks' to you, Malfoy, for helping us." I desperately trying to change the direction of his gaze. "Thank you," I said, sincerely as I looked at his eyes.
As I have cooled down from my rage, I let myself walk for a while as I return to the Burrow. I wanted time to think before I would make my decision. I going to find Sirius whether the Order would agree or not.
On the second day of Harry's seemingly coma state, I began to worry as there were no signs of him waking but Malfoy has a different option.
"Now, I know why Draco loves to tease you, Harry. Your reaction is so funny." She gasps as she slowly sat after finishing her giggling.
Sighing, Malfoy slowly turned away from us and headed the hallways, which leads to the Potion class without speaking a word, behind him was his usual groupie. Suddenly, Michael muffled sounds of anger broke my daze. My body made a rash decision as I called out for Malfoy's name.
I stared at the white ceiling of my temporary room as I recalled the whole day. After finding out my chosen and specific food which is magical creatures it also includes wizards and witches in the menu, ('Horray!' I screamed sarcastically.)  the rest of the day was spend on re-evaluating my skills. so far, all of the previous data was still the same except for my regeneration ability, according to Hermione, I healed 5 times faster than an average human being.
"Really? I think you look dashing oddly, " Draco said as he raised my face, lifting my chin gently. "If not, I would have not kissed you."
I’ve never thought of him dying, that right now the pain is unbearable. I would not have imagined it to be like this.
'Malfoy making this house-elf serve me. Doesn't he know that I was campaigning for the rights of the house-elves?! When I see him, I tell will him a piece of what's in my mind. Even he did save us!'
"But before that, Tiffany please take the things from Granger. She might drop it from shock." He said in an annoyed tone as he took a glimpse at me. "And Granger, pick up your jaw, would you?! This is becoming a habit of yours."
I choked as his words comforted me more genuinely. I felt like crying and for some reason, at the same time, happy. My chest lightens up, all of a sudden.
Sighing, the Headmaster Dumbeldore slowly stood up. 'Harry, do you recall anything when you fell from the pit?'
With a moan choking in my throat, salivating and rejoicing in ecstasy as I bit thru the hard flesh. The blood exploding in my mouth and the meat as hard as it was, I was able to easily tore it from the limb. The screeching pain from the creature wasn't able to reach my ear as I pushed my mouth deeper into the flesh. The creature resisted me, I laughed and spoke in an unrecognizable voice. "More...Blood. Flesh to chew on. Come to me."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know I am being a hypocrite with my growing affection towards Draco but Ginny is my first love and my girlfriend. That's why, I want us to be together then maybe, this crush that I have for Draco will vanish or turn into a love for a friend.
"I think it was his way of thanking us for not revealing the things that had to happen in Headmaster Dumbeldore's office." She answered. "He just didn't want to say it at us so he uses action. You know man's pride. And all about that Pureblood's superiority."
“My. My. Hermione, I won’t even suggest it. If, I didn’t know how to. To answer your question. Yes, I do know-how and to answer the question: where. We’ll just have to find them, right?!”
"I had been meaning to ask, Draco why are you here?" I asked as I put down my fork and tried to focus on his hands rather than his face.
The female with the bush brown hair stood there. She was afraid as her scent tells me but at the same time determine to communicate with me. My lips pulled back, as I snarl at her - exposing my teeth as a warning. But she steps forward with bravado, even the others scream for her to run away from me.
"Sorry about that,  Harry. I want to make sure to keep us both safe. Don't worry, I will remove those chains when I am sure that you are in full control of your urges." Hermione said she came sitting beside me.
We continue to wander inside the cave as Hermione explained. "According to Scandinavian legend, it a hodgepodge of various creatures, usually described as being the size and shape of a large dog, with some cat-like features such as the head, ears, and claws. It is also shagging and it has a tail of a fox or a dragon."
Hissing through my mouth. menacing as it sounds like a snake that is about to attack. Ever muscles in my body bunched and arched, twisting up from the cold ground. I flipped off my back in a spin, crouching in a defensive stance as I glared out in the open field in search of danger and prey.
I felt blazed with embarrassment and I silently was calling myself - Idiot - inside my head but soon as I saw Malfoy's face, all my flustering vanished. Draco Malfoy gave me a tiny smile at the corner of his lips then he quickly made a u-turn towards the dungeon, leaving as fast as he can.
Looking over at him, he was wearing a turtle neck white sweater, gray khaki pants and to my surprise, he was bare-footed. My face must have looked ridiculous as Malfoy raised an eyebrow at me and Hermione giggled at my side. I started to get embarrassed as I realize that my mouth was wide open from being caught off guard. Then suddenly, I remembered Malfoy's hand.
Laughing the both of them, Fred and George started to hop and jump up and down around me and Ginny. "We won't - " George started. "- Promise, Little sister" Fred finishes then they started to run towards the boys' tower as Ginny chased them as she flares up.
"I can see that" Sirius teased me. "Was it Ginny?" He wiggled his eyebrow suggestively at me then to Ginny, who also blushed.  The Twins sniggered at the side. All attention was drawn at us, even Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. And it is very embarrassing. Sometimes, Sirius could be such a child.
"Draco." Hermione, who has been quiet this whole ordeal, spoke at last. "Thus, this means Harry can only replenish himself by eating creatures with magical abilities?"
"What's wrong with being with Draco, even he is an arse. Being with someone who can understand you, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter as long as you are happy and safe. I am absolutely fine with it." Hermione said. "And an affair? I don't see any sort of affair here when the partner that you speak of has already discarded you, Harry."
Panic and fear erupted from within me. It was true that I was weakening, my heart was in frantic beating and my breath was about to halt. Maddening dread course within my every vein. Despair keeps me locked in. As I could feel my body becoming cold-like icicles had sprouted within my flesh and my heart slowed from beating. Darkness came invading my mind. That's when I know - that death was upon me.
"It's n-not Harry's fault" Still trembling, as I spoke and unsuccessfully trying to control my eagerness to help my friend and my fear from my not so long time ago terrifying experience. "He just went out of control from the Acromantulas' attack."
Hermione froze as well. Her back was straight as a rod, her fists clench so tight that it turns her knuckles' white and her face promise a clear sign of pain for Corner.
Walking through the dim-lighted hallways and towards the exit, the way to Hagrid's hut. As the cold morning breeze swipes through my body and my face, I felt relaxed. I started to run, the wind twirling around, rustling my hair across my face.
Then, Draco began to struggle from my embrace as he turns his face away from my kiss, gasping for air.
Hermione and Draco could not see very well like me but at least, Draco brought two pair of his enchanted dark vision goggles for them to use. They also held their wands with their dominant hands.
"Ah. Mr. Sirius Black. I heard of an unfortunate event that had happened. I thought you were dead. Pity..." He said politely but dripping with a sarcastic and demuring message.
The next day as the sun starts to rise, a small ray of light was able to pass through the gape of the tent's entrance - the ray of light-filled my face with its warmth, waking me up from my slumber. It had been 4 days straight that the rain poured, denying us of the heat and light. It filled me with happiness to finally have a bit of the sun. As I stood out from my bed and change my clothes, I went over to Hermione's bed to find out she wasn't there anymore. Sensing some movements from outside and smelling her scent, I assumed she must have awoken earlier than me. I slowly went outside and shield my eyes from the sun's ray as I was adjusting to the brightness of the daylight. Walking more, I soon spotted Hermione sitting against a tree as she was reading some thick book.
"Draco!!!" Mr. Malfoy appalled by his son, interference. He reached out and grabbed Draco's shoulder turning him. "What are you doing?"
Madam Hooch flew by my side and saw the Golden snitch inside my clutch hand. "With 210 points. Gryffindor WINS!" She yelled. As soon she speaks out, the whole Gryffindor cheered with shouts and howls.
Malfoy just stood there. Not speaking, but his eyes speak another. His stare was so cold and the anger in it is freezing like ice. Ron also sensing that this wasn't the usual Malfoy, took a step back. After a minute, under those gazes, my body started to sweat. Then he looks away to face Hagrid. That's when I realize that I was holding my breath as I started to gasp. I also notice that both Hermione and Ron were breathing heavily.
"Mate, You look like a man who hasn't eaten for a long time," Ron said, seeing a surprised expression on him.
"I think... They are not following us." I said as I still listen for any movement out of the ordinary. "I can't hear them anymore."
"Not that!" I grumbled, in panic. "In a romantic way. You're making it that, I just only want you for your body."
I stood there, mesmerized and nervous as I clasped my hands together, staying like that for a while. Draco finally stirred from his seat.
“I would pretend I didn’t hear that for the sake of Harry, Draco,” Hermione warned as she sips her tea, staring at Draco with a reprimanding tone.
"Not fair?" He asked in a gruff voice then laughed in a cold and unhappy tone. "When does our world had the complete concept of justice and fairness? Did you not know that you also belong in that particular group - the light."
As we exited the beautiful tiny mansion, what greeted us was the warm ray of morning sunlight and the overgrown yet elegant garden of Draco. An aroma of herbs and flowers gently float over us as the fresh and cool wind had blown towards our direction. Just beyond the makeshift fence, made of the stock up white stones, were rows of pines and wild bushes - a formidable barrier, if I say so myself as it did its purpose of hiding the whole infrastructure.
Little that I know that these were the start of my upcoming doom and I wasn't ready for it when it finally came at me.
"What do you mean 'I guess'?" Hermione snapped at me. She suddenly grabbed my shoulder and urge me to stand up. "Let me see them. Let's go to Myrtle's bathroom."
"Maybe it's about that terrible accident that was in the news on the Daily Prophet." Hermione huffed weakly as she moved her enormous handbag beside her.
"Granger, you should sit down before you fall asleep on your feet." Malfoy quietly spoke from the doorway, as he stood there observing her and Harry.
I took one of the offered chicken legs and took a small bite. As the cooked flesh touched my tongue, an irresistible urged to vomit shook me. The chicken leg tasted so awful like it was sand that was inside my mouth instead of food. I felt my whole body broke a sweat as I forced the food down my throat. Then I hurried gulped down for water.
I heard her. Her voice had a tinge of concern as her eyes wandered over my face. Then my mind raced. Should I tell her or should I hide it? Hermione is a friend of mine, someone I could trust with all of my life. But I felt a pang of strong guilt within me. I have been giving both of my best friends troubles ever since we have all met. Will, I bring yet again another problem?
I desperately took a hold of his jacket and yank it with so much brutal strength, that I have never known that was in me. "I'll do anything for my best friend," I said, harshly.
I don't know how many days had passed by since the day that I have left Hogwarts. I always find myself laying on the forest floor, as I struggled to control myself from the painful call of my hunger, grunting, grinding as starvation hits me. I fought with myself - in keeping my humanity as every single day, my resolve slowly fades from the pain, hunger, and the betrayal of my friends.
With that, Draco turned to Sirius. "Uncle Sirius, I apologize on my father's behalf. Could you let it go?"
Professor McGonagall turns to us. "Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger will you be needing me in this discussion?"
Sweating and feeling cold, I looked down at my food and pretended to be interested in it. "No, I'm fine"
"I say it like that because usually, half-borns don't get any Inheritance even they are at the right age." He answered me willingly.

The rain still poured as the carriage had arrived at the vicinity of Hogwarts castle. Leaning against the window, the castle had its windows lighted and shimmering - a welcoming sight. Our carriage slowed and halted before the great oak doors, which stood above the plight of stone steps. Its magnificent size and features that were oozing with mystery and magic always left me - wondering and smiling. Me, Ron, Hermione, and Luna quickly jumped from the carriage and run up the stairs, away from the rain and under the shade. Inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its grandiose marble staircase.
"One of my hand is still missing, so, if you be so kind, Granger please levitate Potter. I'll lead the way to my cabin." Malfoy said as he started to walk ahead of us.
"Harry." Hermione spoke for the first time after I have started running with her in my arms as we were trying to escape the Acromantulas that are still chasing us. "Are you all right?"
"I guess the golden trio isn't much of kind and generous heroes as they say. You can turn away people that are in need if you don't like them" He said as he gazed at Hermione with accusation in his eyes.
The reality was harsh as the hunger pains again awaken me. Inside me, something is ripping me - breaking my whole being and replacing it with someone new. It felt like my whole body is being sawed into half as the twisting and flipping motion in my guts tells me to eat.
After all the classes ended that day, Ron and I walked back to our dormitory. Changing into a more comfortable attire and out from our uniforms. Both of us went down to the common rooms to do our due assignments. We found ourselves a table near the fireplace and started our divination assignment coming up with different predictions for the upcoming month. After an hour, we made small progress although our table is full of scraps of paper full of symbols and bearing symbols.
"That's new." Someone sneered at the back of the room. I glanced at the speaker, expecting it to be Malfoy but then I remember we were having a class with the Ravenclaw. The one who spoke was Michael Corner. Confused, I raised my eyebrow at him as I couldn't remember offending him for me to be treated in such a manner.
"Oh, well. I bare good news that might brighten your day." He said casually, like he speaking about the weather today. He then took my hand and pulled me towards the couch to sit beside him.
Sirius raised his fist but was held back by Remus by an arm around his waist. "Let Go, Remus!" as he grabs Remus' hand trying to remove it. I can hear cheers of  'fight' and egging from the twins and Ron.
Billy and Charlie came in the middle of us having breakfast as they were wakened by their mother as she asked them if they could help her to send us off, which they willingly accepted. but Percy, apologizing, said that he is needed in the office. He, immediately, apparated.
With my enhanced vision, I saw him muttered a spell as a gush of wind slice the great moose's neck killing it instantly as it fell.
I drank and I drank. Easily finishing the two acromantulas. But I wasn't satisfied, the taste was lacking. Then I started to indulge myself with the flesh of the others that were brave enough to attack me. Abruptly, a  blast of cold came out of my body, making the temperature go down a few degrees. And with the show of power, the other acromantulas flight in fear, leaving me alone with nothing to eat.
"With all of these happening to you, what are you planning to do?" He clarified as he set down his cup and face his whole body towards me. Giving me his full attention.
Roaring in pain, the beast pawed on its eyes as the spell has injured it - distracting it. Ron, Hermione, and I scrambled for the next tunnel to our left, squeezing ourselves in the small space as the size of a grown man, surely this time the said creature wouldn't able to follow us.
I tensed as I heard him. My heart slam against my chest and my throat dried up, almost immediately. "What have I become, Draco?"
The wind blew from the other direction, shifting the scents away from me. Freeing me from the inviting smell of my prey - that had cleared my mind.
Romilda Vane is a Gryffindor. That giggling girl, who has large, dark eyes, long curly black hair, and a prominent chin. She is pretty but very conceited and often does speak in a dramatic voice. I remember that time when she tried to give me gilledwater spiked with a love potion. Shudder!
I sat there, listening absent-mindedly to Hermione as she retells how she and Malfoy had spent the time together researching and finally coming to understand each other while I was in a deep sleep for the past 3 days. The conversation soon started to go into a more serious topic and my mind went into an alert mode. Apparently, Malfoy let Hermione took the initiative in slowly revealing the cruel truth of the possibility of me becoming a dark creature, specifically, maybe a strigoi but there was no certainty. He left the room, giving the privacy we need.
"I'm..." I stuttered as I searched in my block mind for any excuse. "- just not that hungry but the food is great, Mrs. Weasley."
“I-.” I started as my voice crack and my heart galloped a mile away. I cleared my throat as I felt the warm blush crept over my cheeks. “Mione and I already tested it out”
"NO! Stop that Malfoy. I am not that kind of person." I shouted as I felt so embarrassed. I cleared my throat then I speak again. "So. In my dream, this female demon was urging me to just let go of my self and let her take control of me."
"Let's get our things, Harry. I felt an alarm that I have set eight meters away from us was triggered by someone or something. It's best if we get on packing before they could reach us." She whispered with authority as she moves around with agility.
Then slowly, the headmaster walks up to me and laid a hand on my shoulder, and as I look up to his face. He let out a reassuring smile.
'Somebody please save us.' That was my last thought as the Gulon reappeared with a deafening roar behind us. The smiling face of the Gulon was replaced by a blasted face, a crooked mouth curve in anger and eyes that redden, promising true terror as it seeks me. 'YOU...KILL. I KILL YOU. I EAT YOU!!!' It lost its grace as it came down toward us like a rhino as it tears and bulldozed the obstacles along its path.
Laughing a bit, as happy as I can make my girlfriend flustered and be in dazed, I do pity her if she became a mess in front of her brother, who I know is going to tease her relentlessly.

Said a quiet musical and child-like voice. The way my name was spoken was sensual, soft, and spine-chilling. As if a child had mingled her voice with a snake – hissing like a soft satin. “I see that you are relishing my gift to you.”
' I did say you were dead but now you're alive. I made you possible to be alive. After all, we made a deal.'
After finishing the porridge and drinking the potion, I decided to go down to deliver the used plate, utensils, and glass. Upon exiting the said room that I was staying in, I found myself walking along a beautiful hallway with high ceilings, floors and walls made up of white wood. The walls were decorated by paintings of different sceneries of nature - varying from mountains to ocean shores, each piece was wonderful and majestic but also mysterious. Some corners have pieces of furniture with the same color scheme as the room that I was staying in - pale, light, and cream. After a while, I came upon a stair that leads down and I took it. Reaching the bottom, I find myself again admiring what seems to be the living room - simple but elegant - the very first room that I saw before I pass out.
Realizing that he was voicing out his concern for me, it was Malfoy's turn for his whole face to turn red. His face became more alluring as his face is being beautified by his blush. Oh, God, I must be going out of my mind!
I already know Hermione's opinion on Ginny's reaction towards me when I turned into this creature in front of them but I could understand Ginny's shock and terror because I do fear the creature that I have become.
I couldn't fall back to sleep anymore. After hours of trying to calm down and fixing the broken mirror as well as my eyes returning to its natural color along with me finding out that the source of blood around my mouth was from my hand that I was biting in my sleep. All I could do is blankly stared at the night sky from the window next to my bed.
He looked at me as one of his eyebrows was raised and his lips curved into a half-smirk. Sighing, he said to me. " I guess I have to make the first move."
"Really, Severus. Stop bothering them." Malfoy spoke maturely. "I thought we are to discuss an important matter with the Headmaster."
As soon as he said those words, all the cheers died down. The murmurs of worries started to escalate in all the team members as well as Michael's side.
"You too" I patted his chest as I was still chuckling and swipe the formed tear under my eye from laughing so hard. The relief - I felt made me relax and feel free as I amuse myself with the old jokes that Sirius cracked for the twins: George and Fred, good stories from Remus shared with Mrs. Weasley and Mr. Weasley. Two of my best friends beside me as they snided and flirt with each other. And My girlfriend, Ginerva holding my hand with a beautiful smile on her face.
We lurched into one another as we landed in different parts of the forest, under us were dried up leaves with brown, black, orange, and yellow in shades. The woods were thick as they grew near each other and even though it was morning, almost no light can pass through the dense canopy above us. I began to breathe in the cool air of the forest, the scent of the earth, and could hear the slight sway of the branches felt heavy on my ears. I couldn't anymore hear the heavy footsteps, only the forest's sounds.
"Huh?" Confused, I went to him as he kneeled and turn the moose's head to bring the sliced part into my view.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We started to walk towards the door to wait outside when Malfoy said. "Why not let them stay to listen. Whatever decision that this meeting will come up anyway will surely spread around the school after a few hours. Why not let them hear it out so the word will spread faster but this time maybe, it would be more accurate than the widely spread rumors that will be mixed with lies. Right?" Malfoy said in a bored tone.
Then he left. Walking away as he took his bottle and his bag, towards the castle, followed by his butterflies and oddly, followed by his housemates.
After seeing my grotesque abdomen as it was paled with purple patches and flesh that bulged forming an eerie screaming face of a woman, both - me and Hermione, decided to go straight to Professor Dumbeldore and made our way to his office. Unfortunately, Oliver had happened to appear at the next turn of the corridor and took hold of one of my arms.
"Malfoy. I got it." Angelina Johnson, another team member said with an impatient tone in her voice. "Give me a notebook."
My blood boiled in anger, like magma churning deep within me. I want to punch somebody but I know I shouldn't. My anger is a hunger for release - to have destruction or pain. The pressure was too much to handle as the raging sea drives me crazy and numb. I could felt that my breath came fast and heavy. My whole face was hot and my eyes, which I took a glimpse from the reflection of the mirror in one corner - showed glaring red with rage. I want to let it out - curse at them, be violent and just...
"We didn't. But it is an essential matter, that is why we need to discuss it with the Headmaster." Hermione bubbled as she again raised her head to face Professor Snape.
"Then, be best to go now. So, you won't be late. Tell Lyra that I say Hi" Sirius simply said as if all the anger from the earlier events had disappeared.
His eyes surrounded by those thick and long light blond lashes were flushed with a light more dazzling than any star and full of resolute. He spoke, "It does not mean that the title of 'the boy who lived', that it's a must for you to need to carry a burden of being perfect and having absolute power. No one is perfect, believe me, I know. So, you don't have to be responsible for everything and everyone.
Malfoy raised his sliced hand towards the tiny butterflies. Little by little, they land on his hand each taking time to sip his blood. I grew jealous of the butterflies as they fed without care. Slowly, my hunger faded as the smell of blood also disappears, confusing me. As my bloodlust vanish, my focus returned, only to be mesmerized by the most beautiful and disturbing scene in front of me.
With the question at the tip of my tongue, I silently pass over my plate towards him. He reaches out and places it on his side. “Tiffany, can you get the cooked bacon over the sink?”
"Captain Wood of the Gryffindor," Malfoy called in his most regal tone. He waited for Oliver to turn his head to pay attention to him as the rest of the team started to arrive.
Around us, a whole population of different hues of colors - red, blue, yellow, and green. Mingling in the air, the scents that made my hunger stir more. I want to eat so badly...
"Well, it's not so bad... our schedule for today," I said as I examine the column of subjects under Monday, tracing my finger until it stops at a subject in the afternoon. "Double Divination, Ugh!"
"I'm fine. I still do have them but they have been appearing less since our unfortunate adventure but sometimes there were ones that made me woke up  in the middle of the night and couldn't return to sleep." She smiled wearily.
I looked at them. Remus, brown ruffled hair, is still tall, lanky, and a bit slouching but seems healthy enough compared to the last time we have seen each other. As for Sirius, black nape length hair, had more muscle in him as I noticed as I had hugged him earlier then Remus but still supporting that dark eye bags.
Ron's face went to a great color of red as he went on and left. I shut my eyes. I felt the uneased feeling started to fade. I slowly got up to look at myself in the mirror.
"Y-you, two. Hurry up and eat! Where are those girls?" Mrs. Weasley stuttered. It was still evident in her voice that she was still shaken from the news she had received from the call.
"I will start with what had been reported to me. Mr. Malfoy, you are accused of inflicting injury to a fellow student, who is in Gryffindor, am I correct?" Professor McGonagall asked.
As I reached the Burrows' door and knocked, the door opened immediately as Mrs. Weasley came out and as she saw- she rushed to enclose to her arms.
"Yes," I answered as I refocus my mind on Hermione, away from the negative thoughts that have entered my head.
"Thanks," I whispered. After a while, he waves his wand again as he fixes the broken mirror - restoring it to its original form.

"Oh little master, you have arrived." The she-elf cheerfully greeted Malfoy, with its surprisingly clean light blue dress. "Almost, little master," it answered the question that Malfoy had asked with glee.
The owls encircle the tables searching for their owners or to the person they are to deliver. On the other side of the hall, there was fussing that was going about, instead of his usual eagle owl that had delivered the parcels and some sort of letter to Draco Malfoy. It was a small albino dragon sitting comfortably on his shoulder. Malfoy, unabashed by the commotion, he stoically started opening his letter and disposing some of his sweets to Crabbe and Goyle. The miniature dragon started to eat on his plate that he had abandoned.
I froze in my seat as I tried to process the story. Beside me, Ron muttered. "Bloody hell" Malfoy cut off someone's tongue? Wasn't that a bit too much? I mean I know Malfoy is a bastard and a meany, but he wasn't a sadistic maniac to be able to cut up a girl. This is not Malfoy that I know of.
I leaned back against my chair, letting the noise of the whole class and the drone-like voice of Professor Flitwick drown my head. The discussion was interesting and exciting. It would have been if I'd been able to really hear it. Instead, I was preoccupied with early events. My hands gripped under the edge of the table as I tried to hold myself in my chair. It's a good thing, Charms is with Ravenclaw. If it would have been with the Slytherins, I shuddered and shivered - fear of what could have happened if it were. I could still feel it - my hunger and my blood lust - for his blood. It wasn't getting any better. My stomach is still twisting in hunger.
I shrugged as I really didn't know what kind of creature Malfoy brought with him. I turned to Ron to ask him if he knew but Ron just raised both his shoulder and had the 'I don't know' expression.
"Ah...Well, they left me with no choice, so I run for it." Hermione blushed as she sheepishly twirls a bit of her hair.
"You two! Stop teasing Harry. All you do the two of you are fool around." Mrs. Weasley gritted her teeth as she marched towards them. "If THE BOTH OF YOU put your time to study more than do those pranks and those... stuff then I would be happier."
Malfoy released his hold and went up to Parkinson. "It's none of your business, Pansy." Then he walked past her and continue towards the hallway. Parkinson runs after him, calling out to wait for her.
"Do we have to climb those damn stairs every time we have a Divination class?" Ron grumbled breathlessly.
The dream started with me, opening my eyes, as I again was laying down. I was facing the grey sky, dull and lifeless. Then a single snowflake slowly descending towards me. I raised my hand up to reach for it and as I did, my attention was drawn at something in my closed fist. I open it then blood started to flow. Startled, I abruptly sat up. The splashing of something was heard, echoed throughout the wide horizon of black and white.
It hurts! I gasped as I forced my lungs to take as much air as it could handle. The ache shoot from my legs as I ran as fast as I can - blindly scrambling away from the creature. I could hear my heart pounding loudly that I could feel it slam against my chest walls.
I came to realize her inquiry as I stared at my hands and taste it in my mouth. A panic surge within me then denial.
"I guess I have start all over?" I asked them as I also took a serious stance and then leaned back on my seat, trying to relax as much as it simply allows.
"That kind of hurt a bit, Johnson," Malfoy said but was easily ignored by Angelina as she was facing the Ravenclaws that were looking worried and in panic as they were busted of spying - underhand method.
2. Harry's decision in not telling the adults of his situation will later be tackle. Please wait for it because there is a reason behind his stubbornness.  If I reveal it now, it will destroy the play of my story.
"Oh, shut up, Malfoy" I retorted in an annoyed tone. Then, a sharp pain erupted on the top of my head. "Ow!"
Everbody left as Ginny held onto me, not before the twins exchanged mischievous stares at us, while Hermione with mother-like concern and Ron with a complicated brother-complex and best friend worry. As I lay on the sturdy lounge, I shut my eyes and breathe slowly. Ginny seated near my head and had a novel book. After I have rested enough, I got curious and asked her what she is reading. "It's a muggle story about a boy who hearing things in his mind, it says he has a split personality. Hermione recommended it."
"Yes, indeed. Albus." Snape sneered at the headmaster. He turned towards the door while he slowly pulled Malfoy to leave.
"Harry, rest for the meantime." Moine always the mother hen. "Will be going to Diagon Alley, today."
"That is something you have to discuss with Sirius, himself. It's about his family" Remus said in a serious tone that I couldn't disagree with. "It is something personal for him. Please understand," he added, seeing my reaction.
"Then why are you terrorizing them in this very minute?" Malfoy said coldly. A perfect imitation of his father. "Aren't you the adult one, Severus?"
"I apologize for being here," Michael smirked in my direction. " But Potter butt in, an issue that he doesn't have any concerns"
"I don't know, Ron," Hermione said seriously. "I need to research that locket even Britain's old council of wizards and witches."
"Stop doubting me. Let's say. Some of the pureblood families have creature blood - like the Bulstrodes are said to have giant's blood that can be seen with their physical attributes or the Zabinis are rumored to have sirens' blood that is associated with their allure. So, I know things, Granger." He stated nonchalantly.
"I can't." I said, quietly. I couldn't continue. I'm still unsure and fear this situation. I don't know how will Malfoy react.
Emerging the dark woods, nine figures came with grunting and with their clubs. One of the hobgoblins, was leery over us as he held his enormous club high up then settling it over his shoulder with confidence and glee.
"As I was saying it all started when Sirius went missing and we stumbled upon runes inside a cave." I said and started to reminisce about that particular event.
Malfoy stared at me, long enough to make the skin of my whole body and my face - warm and weird that I cough out loud to break the awkward silence between us.

Sighing, I took a spoonful and took a bite. I gasp in surprise. Immediately, the taste of flesh and blood took over my mouth. The slight thick consistency of the blood with a metallic tinge in it, followed by the soft and mouth-melting meat, it was pure heaven. I almost purred with happiness.
"I have brought them," Malfoy said as he took out a large crystal bottle from his bag. Inside the bottle were tiny red butterflies that were fluttering around inside the bottle. It seems to be the bottle itself held a large magic space to accommodate a small garden and 25 butterflies within it. Magic is so amazing!
A voice with a sing-song tone said. I blinked open my eyes to stare at our room's ceiling, as I am still bunking with Ron. The dim light that is passing through the curtains of our window indicates that it is still early morning, maybe, around five to six o'clock. I slowly sat up and went to find the eyeglasses that I usually set on the bedside table before sleeping but halted. I realized that instead of a blurry vision, I am seeing clearly without them on. What the?!
Blushing the both of us, as we stumbled in our feet. "Don't you dare say or do anything?" Ginny grumbled as she glared at her brothers.
Hermione started marching across the woods, thinking deeply. I followed behind, listening to the sound of her voice - it reassured me beyond my imagination. Trying to contribute a bit, I told her. "You forgot about my enhance senses or what could have really happened to me when I attack Michael Corner after I went down?"
The hobgoblin beside Draco chortled in triumph and grinned evilly as he raised his club for the kill. My blood boiled and anger flowed within me as I saw Draco was in grave danger. I gave a ferocious scream as it tore from my chest and run out from my mouth. A kind of sound, which I might never able to make if I were still a human, startling the creatures as they turned towards me. They made a guarded stance as they were alerted by my presence. I stood tall and straight as all my fear and hesitation disappeared that instant. Replaced by energy waiting to burst out, as I growled in an animalistic way. The remaining hobgoblins realized that there was something wrong as they slowly back step away from us.
I swallow with great difficulty as I shudder at the idea of eating any part of my best friend. I'm suddenly felt disgusted with myself and felt bottomless despair as there seem to no cure to this curse.
Waving my wand like a lasso, as I release a series of countless spells hitting each acromantula that keeps on coming, encircling us slowly. "Expelliarmus!" "Rictusempra!" "Bombarda!" Stupefy!" "Reducto!" "Arania exumai!" "Maxima Bombarda!"
As if the human girl had understood that it was no avail to hinder me with words, she runs. As fast as she can. But not fast enough to out-run me. I leap with force as I run after my prey. I can imagine it now, how the blood would flow - spurting and gushing as I bite and tore the flesh on her neck. I snicker in excitement and anticipation. Then the human girl turns and waves the stick in her, shouting: "Petrificus totalus."
"Yes," Hermione answered, slowly. "It's fine now. I have been having a few but it gradually decreasing. How about you, Harry?"
I blushed at the sight of him as I felt my whole face burn, hotly. Dumbfounded by his beauty, I stood there like an idiot.
Draco was ecstatic, one of his arms was wrapped around my neck and refused to let go while his other hand rubbed my messy hair, continuously calling my name by my ear." Oh... Harry...Harry...How can you be so cute?" He laughed in a breathy tone as he teased me relentlessly.
"They are called FRIENDS. Unlike the people behind you, who you considered as part of YOUR gang." I said with much more bite in my voice. I stood up and faced him with a much rage within me. He was getting on my nerves. Talking shit about me is fine but to talk bad about my friends is another thing.
Nodding to Hermione as thanks for understanding and eventually returning his gaze at me, he gestured me with an urging nod to take a bite at the meat which was put on the top of my bread. Gulping, I, courageously, took a bite.
The other professors were already settled and were all chatting with each other. Hagrid, who landed the job as the professor of care of magical creatures, was talking animatedly about something to Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher and the Head of Ravenclaw house, that Hagrid's movements made Professor Flitwick bounce in his chair just from the force of it. A funny sight if I am honest to be.
Confound by the overbearing pain in my stomach - like a bottomless pit that is aching to be filled. Terrible pain, constant, grinding. I seek to relieve it. I seek food -anything just to alleviate the hunger that I feel.
"Gulon is notorious not for its features but its symbol." Hermione grumbled as she also tried to climb over the rock after Ron.
"Thank you, Malfoy for enlightening me," I uttered after inhaling and exhaling as I come in terms of my arrogance and lack of knowledge.

"Inheritance is something that you have accepted from your magical blood either a trait, a creature power, or a level up. Basing from your family background, I suppose it came from your Father's side as he was from a pureblood family - the Potters. An Inheritance may come to you by age due to the strong magic that had to linger in the blood or the heir of the family that naturally happens to the pureblood family. While in your case since your mother is a muggle-born. Thus it only came to you because you have unnature high magical power." He explains it to me with detailed entail that almost all my worries had been washed away.
Me - Bloodshot eyes, sharp razor teeth gnawing, wild from insanity and hunger. Darkness and madness.
"I know. You were too tired and you needed the sleep." She said as she sat across me, between us was a small table. "No harm is done."

Then a burst of laughter came from behind. Charlie and Bill, both who had just arrived with Remus, were seated on the chairs of the diner table. They have those teasing smiles on their faces. Bill or should I say, William Weasley, is the oldest among the Weasley children, is a curse breaker in Gringotts in Egypt. He looked more like a singer of a rock band instead of an office guy and Charles Weasley, known as Charlie, works with Dragons in Romania, had a bulky body, the one you usually see as an average bouncer.
We reached King's Cross safely. I was already used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. As for me, Hermione and Ron walked by the group, walking straight through the barrier between platforms nine and ten. We have to do it in an unobtrusive way to avoid any attention from the muggles. Chatting and being relaxed is the best way to do it.
Okay... so this is not a dream. Wow! Hermione and Draco are actually having a normal conversation without killing each other. Just Wow! I continue to stare at them.
In the midst of being chased by a horde of giant acromatulas and the fear of death as well as my abomination transformation and all that shit, I felt intoxicated from the adrenaline that was pumping in my veins - the thrill that sings in my every fiber of my body and the power that I could feel in every stride that I take. That made me question my sanity.
"Really?" Malfoy's face had turned into a fake confused state before smiling and then he spoke in a sweet sickly fashion at me. " I glad for Potter. Really! I do. So, where are they?"
"Yes..." Malfoy said slowly, like how the snail moves as it creeps over the leaves and grasses, a manner that wasn't unnoticed. "So, Granger, as much as I would let you indulged yourself from wanting to stay look stupid as your mouth is still hanging open for any bug to enter it, I would rather not let you as I am seeing the back of your throat quite disturbing."
Ï wish I could just ask Hermione what to do. But then, again that would be a bad idea. I could just imagine Hermione recommending a book to me, which is entitled 'How not to fall in love with your ex-rival.', right?
Standing straight with the aura of regal, the blonde turns to the female saying. "What benefit would I get out of this and why should I help you?"

Seeing his calm but the concerned face, some of my anger faded. I was able to calm down. "What it is, Malfoy?' I said in a gentle tone.
"Hmm..." I replied nonchalantly as I slowly sat up to give her space to sit on the bed. Hermione sat beside me as she offered me the other mug.
Malfoy took the cork out of the bottle and let the butterflies loose. Many screamed in fright but the creatures didn't attack anyone but instead, all of the butterflies were hovering over Malfoy except for one peculiar large patterned one as it had landed on Malfoy's head.
Shaking, I inhaled deeply and realize that my every encounter of the house-elves that I tried to save clearly fear it and I am angry with my ignorance and arrogance. Now, I know what was Malfoy was talking about. I was only seeing the light side, My own point of view.
"It's Draco." I finally said. As the intensity of Sirius' stare bore a hole on me. I continued. "He was different today. And who is Lyra?"
"I see. The mongrel has the audacity to spew unbelievable things about you and his even trying to elicit the sympathy of the general public." He said with disgust in his voice. "Basic tactics. Boring..."
Sighing, I finally took pity on Ron,  as I turn to him again. "I'm hungry, Ron. Let's go downstairs."
"I guess I will be expelled today." Malfoy said with a weird expression. "If I am to be expelled then I could do anything to Ms. Romilda Vane  now, right?"
Quidditch against the Ravenclaw will be a week after. Shit! A match when I wasn't really feeling it.
It made me forgot the intense hunger that I felt instead it was replaced by the aching hollow inside my chest. Then someone out of nowhere came to a voice shouting with accusation. "MONSTER! ITS A MONSTER!"
'Hermione, what do you mean to leave you? I'm still here.' I wanted to say but my whole body just won't move even my mouth was heavy as if something was placed on it.
Professor Trelawney was smiling at me as she looks at my cup in a loving manner, which was extremely disturbing. Whatever Jade means, it seems to be something Professor thinks of as precious in the way how her face glows with the prospect of it. Lavender suddenly giggled and then whispered something at seatmate, Padma Patil Then they both burst into feminine giggles.
There was a margin of silence with a solemn aura engulfs us before Hermione spoke again. "But not all was a lost cause. At least, you have Draco to focus on."
"Run." Draco hissed harshly, as he pulled Hermione spurring towards the direction of his tiny manor. I followed after as I jammed my feet from the ground to help me have a good kick start. Draco suddenly whips his wand with a spell, firring, "Bombarda." with such accuracy, killing off, one of the Hobgoblin and injuring another.
"Why, Granger! Do you have to ask? That would be the ancient Dragons and the Great snakes." He guffawed mockingly.
"Slow down!" He spoke in a fast, hasty tone as he presses one finger from his uninjured hand on his lips; a gesture to indicate to keep quiet. "You don't want your friend to go loony just after I made him go to sleep."
This is a Deja vu. Like the situation, when we met at the Diagon Alley. I couldn't help but become more amazed by Malfoy's change of attitude. He had indeed matured and the funny part is: he is scolding THE Professor SNAPE, in front of us - just like what he did to his father, the last time.
Settling down on the cushion chairs, laid on the table where a pot of steaming chicken soup and a basket full of warm bread. I sat beside Hermione while across us is Draco, and yet again shocking me out from my system, sitting beside him, is his House-elf, Tiffany.
I tensed myself for the first leap and my muscles bunched in preparation. The hunting instinct and yearning to eat ruled me completely. I singled-minded took off and landed on the prey as it screams and scrambled away from the sharp nails of my hands. The hunger got worse, it was so painful as it erases any other thoughts and conquers my mind to end my hunger as it urges me to take a bite.  My hands held him down by his neck and my mouth opened in anticipation as I brought it, near the nearest flesh. I was suddenly alarm by the presence that was behind me. The pull of my hunger and the irresistible scent of my prey warred with the impulse to defend myself and my intended prey.
“Hmm… Somebody woke up at the good side of the bed, today.” A voice uttered from the stove, stirring at what was supposed to be a pot of soup, as he looks up when I entered.
Giving in as I pulled his face over and kissed him deeply, pushing my tongue into his mouth aggressively. Draco moaned softly in the back of his throat, as I lightly chew on his lips and suck on his tongue. Eagerly responding to my touch and kissing, tangling his tongue with mine.
"Har...ry, let me b-breathe..." He whispered in a breathy and raspy tone as his lips were so red and pulp from kissing.
Cursing, I am truly unfortunate as if all the gods and goddesses had been playing with my life. In all the time for my hunger strike to come back in a form of full-blown pain is this TIME... Really when will fate give me a break!!!
"What is it?" Hermione turned towards us, as she eyeing our join hands with mischievousness and amusement. I coughed out in embarrassment.
"Stupefy!" Hermione shouted, successfully knocking down one goblin near her. Making it, only four remaining to face off.
To keep my mind from thinking, away from the worries and the fear, I took the liberty of taking a long bath and changing my clothes. I need to do something, to save me from becoming insane with my current situation. A morning run can't be that all bad.
The Gulon, it was still following us as its smiles in glee and giggled like a hyena. 'One...Two...Three...' It sang as it pounces onto us. Even with its size and weight, it still manages to glide with agile in the narrow tunnel of the cave, not hindered by the stalagmites and rock pillars. It could morph its shape to enter any small spaces.
"Harry!" Ron called out of nowhere. I immediately snap out into attention as the call, wake me up in my daydreaming. I look around to see if I miss anything, I saw Ron flying towards me.
"Harry, I am so sorry," Hermione whispered as she tried to approach me. Remorse was painted on her face as she drew closer and patted my back.
"Morning, Harry," Hermione greeted as I went down the stairs as I only just wake up. "Had a good night?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RED. That was the only thing, I saw as I took a swing at her. Smashing the blasted mirror. Pain erupted as my fist got pierced by the broken pieces of the glass. Her laughter fading slowly.
"There is some truth to what you speak but do you know that you are also robbing them of something else when you asked for their freedom?" He spoke gently but his eyes tell me of something else as he glare at me.
I obediently laid down on the bed. Still unbelieving of the events unfolding in front of me, I slowly slip into a dream state as I saw him leave the room.
"Bring out your teacups and sprinkle your grind tea leaves then put 2 drops of spring water. Concentrate your mind. Use your inner eye." She said as she took out her teacup. We followed the instructions she relayed.
Message: I recently received a helpful piece of advice and I want to thank that person for pointing it out for me. I am going to try to type faster and compose more diligent with this story with more ideas and with a  more wholesome approach but I still couldn't promise if it will satisfy all the readers.

"I don't know," I answer with honesty. Ginny, even though she had shunned me, was still my girlfriend. "I still need to have a talk and a closure from Ginny. I can't just let her hanging there."
"Hmm..." Ron took my teacup and stared at it. With his blue eyes, he observes the shape formed by the tea leaves trying to make up something of it.
Ron jumped out from his sit, making an angry noise, and marched towards Ginny. Ginny did likewise. They both started to bickering with each other, steaming with so much anger. I rolled my eyes at their antics.
“What?!” I shouted in shock as I returned my gaze on the meat, with disbelief. “For real? Is there such a creature?”
'Oh, I just hate seeing through your eyes with those hideous things. I just have to fix those iris of yours. There are no visible changes. So, stop with that panic look.'
Recognizing the voice, I woke up from my dazed state as I stood up and scramble to my feet as I look at our savior.
"Sucess? Experiment? What the hell are you two talking about?" I complained as I getting irritated about being left behind by these two geniuses. "Do care to explain, Hermione?"
Hermione's whole face turned to crimson shade as she looked down and murmured. "I'm sorry, Professor." Apparently, being caught breaking the rules really do get  Hermione. It was really our fault but he didn't have to take a jab at Hermione.
"Oh. It's not only Potter's concern. Actually." He pauses as he dramatically drops the next words. "It is, after all, you - Gryffindors' business," Malfoy smirked in the most confident and eerie way as he fans gently the notebook near his face.
During the ride, the rain again poured down this time harder and heavier. The long procession of the carriage was rumbling and splashing its way up towards Hogwarts Castle. Luna cracked the window open and she looks up to the sky. She said in a serious tone. "Look at the sky, Harry. It seems that the dragon is crying."
The pang of starvation, the dry yearning of thirst...its making me lose control over my body, my mind and myself. And the bullshit bloodlust is pulsing all over my body. I started to shake, I fell on the floor, on my knees and my head bow as I pant harshly.  Hermione was busily brandishing her wand to add more support to the erected barrier, her sweat poured as she was giving her best effort to protect both of us.
"What is happening, Harry?" A voice from above us asked loudly as the wind interferes with the sound to be heard. Oliver Wood.
I remember the entrance to the place was really creepy not because of the features but because of the aura around.
"Hell!" I answered with a grunt. "Surprise that I am in control for the first time but still disgustingly hungry."
Snickering, Malfoy raised the said small notebook above his head as his stance changed. His manners seem to remind me of that arrogant brat that I am used to seeing. "I like to see you try."
Casting down my eyes as I hummed in agreement with his words. I doubt that it would be any simple as to what was said in the letter that was sent to Draco. People will still fear me even though I have proven to them as many times that I want to defeat Voldemort, the Dark Lord, and not I am seeking to become one.

"Am what?" I muttered as I was in a confused state as to what is the meaning of the word was uttered.
"Potter, I didn't know that you have become an animal." An arrogant voice said. "Seriously, you should have chosen a better meal."
"See yeh at the feast." Hagrid smiled as his gigantic silhouette loomed over the first years. It was a tradition that the first years reach Hogwarts by boat guided by Hagrid.
"Might you, Draco. That was quite, an extreme way to get revenge on someone," Hermione scowled at Draco as she was reminded of that scene at Professor Dumbledore's office.
“Satisfied?” He asked in a whisper tone that had an additional effect on me as it brings more - the disturbing tremors in my body. I felt drunk, fulfilled, and overloaded in all my five senses, and crazily, I was bursting with happiness that I couldn’t describe what was happening to me. Confused, I bow my head and muttered: “Yeah.”
I, with Ron and Hermione, followed her and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors. "Thank goodness, it's warm inside," Hermione muttered at my right and I hummed into agreeing. It was freezing outside.
"So, what creature did you bring in Malfoy?" Ron snapped. "The Dragon! We all have seen it this morning when you were probably bragging it around."
"Hermione, since you are a genius..." Draco smiles slowly at her while he was dragging his voice in a teasing manner. "Would you be a dear and please explain it to the knucklehead."
"Okay," I muttered as I kneel beside him and bend my waist to bite on the open flesh of the animal. It was disturbing but for the sake of our safety and my sanity, I have to do this. As I suck on the animal's blood, I felt little satisfaction as I try to savor the taste of blood but to my dismay, it has no great effect on me. I raised my head to Draco as my bite my lower lips and I felt inside corners of my eyebrows slanting upward.
"Mr. Weasley, please do pick the cup of Mr. Potter and tell us what do you see?" she said in a faked high misty voice.
"Deserve it?! Mr. Malfoy, It outlined what you did to her!" The Gryffindor head stood up abruptly from her sit with much force. "You literally cut off her tongue. If her friends were not able to call for Pomfrey, immediately, to attached her tongue then it would have been worst - she might not have her tongue back."
She was smiling friendly at me like she was fascinated by the view. The view of me, soaked with blood. Me, who is becoming addicted to the taste of blood in my mouth.
"The reason for living and the source of their power." He said. "House-elves have been in slavery for too long, Granger. As you are trying to change the whole reason for their existence and the rules of their society. It is a vast and heavy blow in their history and the way of their living. What do you expect for them to do after attaining their freedom when they don't know where to go or what to do after being put out on the streets without any home, food, and, water? There are only a few who would hire a house-elf, Granger. Especially, in our today's and perspective view.  Luckily, Dobby was put in Hogwarts and that is only one, house-elf. What about the rest, Granger? Will you able to support them? Provide food, water, and shelter? Along with it, is their source power, which is very unknown by a lot. Especially those, who isn't a pureblood - that an ancestor house has a magic core which also provides power and vitality to the house-elves that serve the masters of the home. No home, no magic, and no power. So, basically, you are sending them to an early death, Granger."
And it's not helping that we are being chased by giant man-eating spiders and Hermione, who is in my arms has a mouth-watering scent that it's making it hard for me to focus enough.  I forced myself to keep going on, weaving through the trees, avoiding the pincers and the legs of the Acromantulas that did manage to get near us.
Draco was already panting in pain and anger as he stops in his mid-sentence. It was too much for him to relay to us - the pain was there I could see it too well and I could understand it very much.
The first thing that I did hear was crying. No. That was wrong. It was more than crying, it was the kind of desolate sobbing that comes from a person drained of all hope. But who? I still feel heavy and I can't open my eyes. So I waited and listened more. Beside me, I heard some footsteps near my head then a warm hand resting on the side of my neck, like this person was feeling my pulse.
"He needs strength, Granger. After rampaging like that and his very first-time real meal, his body is adjusting." He said confidently with a book in his hand as he sat on the lounge of his living room.
I hated my life for what Fate took from me. First, my parents, who I never met and only knew through the stories of others then my childhood, which I spend with unloving relatives that prefer to make me feel unworthy of anything, and now, my life that I just earn recently by turning me into this monster that craves to eat even my best friends and my adopted family.
I almost smiled with his casual greeting when it's dripping with sarcasm. Instead of feeling irritated just like I usually feel, what I felt surprised me - I felt happy just to see him. Like I have become one of his butterflies, wanting to swarm around him.
We all settled in for the night, there had been an awkward silence after the talk about the Malfoys. As we have learned some things about them. Before Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley were friendly rivals in politics but never had that level of animosity between them that they have now. But after the death of Mr. Malfoy's heir, Lucius begins his mission to get rid of all the muggles from the wizardry world, calling them dangerous, barbaric, and animals, that Mr. Weasley opposed as being unfair. Resulting in their fight, thus Mr. Malfoy started calling the Weasleys - Blood traitors. While Mrs. Malfoy, who had some sort of relationship with Mrs. Weasley also became cold towards them and Draco a sweet polite child turned into a rude cruel teenager, a part which Ron and I couldn't imagine. All the younger Weasleys had no idea regarding this manner since it was a personal issue and painful to talk about, that's why it was avoided to discuss.
Michael's whole face turns red as he balled his fist, angered by my lack of attention. "Nightmares. I heard that you have been having them. I guess you're getting scared of our match next week. ha!?"
I stared at the creature rampaging the bushes just 3 feet away from us as I convinced myself that I needed to do this now as a big step in accepting my reality. I have to eat to satisfy my urges which leads to preventing any unavoidable accidents, that might happen. I cannot drown myself with self-pity because nothing good will come out of it and lastly, I need to be strong for the people, I love, especially Hermione for sacrificing so much for me along with Draco, who is becoming important to me as well.
Thankfully, Mrs. Weasley took over the situation, since all the males are all frozen in place. "I also would like to apologize for this childish banter on our part"
But then I wanted to laugh. The years that I had been in the dark, not knowing anything about my parents, to their deaths, to my heritage, to my magic, to my godfather, to what is my purpose. Physical pain, mental anguish, humiliation, hopelessness, and helplessness that I both received from my own relatives, from people that I don't know, from Voldemort, and now from my loved ones.
'Oh, feisty.' She giggled in my ears. 'But I can't leave you alone, Harry because I love to stay and mess you up.'
"If you want Harry. I could you some of my chicken?" Ron offered as he moved his plate towards me. "Mum is right. You didn't even finish your pumpkin juice."
Malfoy suddenly spoke. " Granger, are you thinking about where you will be staying then have no fear, I have a cabin, which I am staying in right now. I'm fine making accommodation for both of you.
I felt peace for the first time since my unfortunate transformation. My body felt free with no pain or unquenching hunger.
His thoughts shifted and without speaking, without any warning, he turned his head, fixing his gaze steadily on me.
He was dragging a large glass bottle and he pulled the stopper as he did so, a flock of butterflies flew out from the bottle. Ah, I remember the blood dragon butterflies. The butterflies swarm around Malfoy, dancing and fluttering.
"Because I care for her. She had been with me since I was 10 years old." He said with very intense emotion within his voice. "Just because her nature is to eat flesh and drink blood, should I abandon her? Even if she never inflicted any pain to others, should I fear her? It's just a part of her and not her whole being."
"I guess?" I answered with a question. I seriously have forgotten that I was injured since it wasn't hurting that much.

After, what seems to be an eternity of waiting, Draco finally looks at me and chuckles breathlessly. "Do you still want to kiss me?"
A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting outside the station. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reached for one and as they open the door of the carriage, somebody was already there. It was Luna Lovegood.
Hermione suddenly sat up straight then lean forward the table as she tries to reach my fidgeting hands. "What do you mean 'getting worse', Harry? You said that they have been subsiding? How worse? What kind of nightmares?"
My demon must have found it amusing the panic state and my denial that I was in. As she continues to giggle at the back of my mind. 'I told you last night, Harry. That I'm close, right?'
I mined my head with anything, I could reply with. I was still in mid-daze as no thoughts came at me. Then in a panic, I found myself muttering: "Thanks."
Cold but beautiful that was the first thing that has entered my mind as I have seen the speaker. Draco Malfoy. Again, he was not wearing his usual snarling face instead of a calm and neutral one. His free-flowing hair that had to seem to have turned more silver in color, eyes that house the shade of ocean grey-blue, his smooth and soft cornered face along with his near statue-like posture. A beauty to behold. Not that I will tell him that!
But one scent remains, the aromatic one - that was far more appetizing. Promising a delicious meal, flesh, and bones. I turn around in search of that smell.
"Ah...Well, they left me with no choice, so I run for it." Hermione blushed as she sheepishly twirls a bit of her hair.
I don't exactly know what happened after the first two acromantulas rush onto us, clicking their pincers rapidly but what I do know is before any of them was able to touch Hermione, I got to them first. And I also know that for the first time after being condemned in this hellish situation, I am free at last.
A heavy silence reign the Great hall, as the speculators that had been watching me and Michael - expecting a fight and they are now more interested in Malfoy's interference. I could see Ron, Fred, and George's mouth were all wide open, shocked as I am. Malfoy, lately these days, he had become good at surprising people.
Blushing as she was embarrassed with my praising, she just shyly pats my right shoulder. "Stop that, Harry."
My mind can't seem to process what had just happened. Especially, the part where Draco smiled at us or even the part he apologized. And what so weird is the part that both Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Remus, and even Sirius seem to understand the whole situation.
The Great hall was splendid as always, it was lit by thousands of candles that were floating in midair over the four long tables, where some of the students already had seated. Golden plates and goblets shimmer as the light of the candles illuminate them. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. As usual Professor Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster, with his silver hair and beard that was so long that he tucked it into his belt, sat on the center of the table and to his right side was an empty sit for Professor McGonagall while at his left side, sat a shoulder-length, greasy black hair, thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose and yellow, uneven teeth were seen as he sneers at the upcoming students that entered the hall, Professor Severus Snape, the potion master, and the Slytherin house's Head.
"Then, tell me, Hermione. What will you do if you ever meet Corner again?" He asked with a wide smile that was too far from a kind one.
2. Vampire (Cool but no. I'm good with the sun by Harry) (No sunlight reaction, yes to Hunger for blood, Not pale or gaunt, no fangs by Hermione)
My entire body moved by instinct as I run in front of Malfoy and caught the raging Michael. I tried to shove him off with all my strength but instead, I was brought down with his weight. I can hear all the cheers and the egging from the boys and the shout of protests from the girls for us to stop. As I fell on the ground, Michael made to punch my face. His fist hit my jaw with full force that made my head sway and swims.
"I could tell by how you reacted and based on who you are, Potter." he smiled at me, in a lazy and kind of affectionate way,  that it made me squirm uncomfortably as I realized that it felt strange within the pit of my stomach, not horrible but more of a pleasant feeling. "I could easily guess how your brain works weirdly." He smirked in a teasing way.
"It was by the use of the twins' pranks, right?" Ron smiled as he remembers that. "Mom got to compliment them for that."
I still find Professor Dumbledore's office the most unique one that I have ever seen. As I glanced around, I can see it was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noise. Weird silver instruments stood on the spindle-legged table, as they emit all kinds of sounds, whirring and forming little puffs of white and black smoke. The wall was almost covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, that were either watching us curiously or snoring quietly in some wonderland. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and sitting on the shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.
"But it's true. Very true" Sirius jolly blabbers. Mrs. Weasley's face was adorned by blush as she smiled brightly.
"We need to talk about those but first, we need to find a perfect spot to put the tent and set-up alarms, concealing charms and maybe - add a bit more of anti-detection charms." She breathed as she grew tired from the hike.
"That's good and all but that doesn't explain why are you tampering with my food," I said, still confused with the whole situation.
"Stop being stubborn, Granger." He said as he rolled his eyes at me. "Rest. One, dead last, and the troublesome brat are enough. I don't need another Gryffindor to drop dead on me."
"They left earlier but they will be back. Unfinished business they say." Ginny smiled, sweetly at me as caress my hand under the table. I smiled back as well as I squeezed her back. Ginny fluttered her eyelids at me, which made me wish we were alone instead of eating breakfast together with her family and offered me pumpkin juice which I accepted. The twins hooting and whistling as they saw us, making both of us blushed.
Closing my eyes, trying to control my emotions as breathe in through my nose and breathe out through my mouth. The only good thing in the article that I have read is the Weasleys decline the interview and Professor Dumbledore denied all the lies that particularly, me becoming a dark wizard. No word referring to Sirius and Remus, which means they haven't come back from their mission.
Timidly reaching for the book, I also began flipping the inside of the said book. After a few minutes, I laid the heavy tattered book on the table with a sigh. "Hermione," I called out and waited for her to look at me, away from her book. "I am not even sure of what to look in these books."
"You say it only came to me?" I asked for further. I couldn't believe my luck! All along with the explanation to my problem is just within my reach.
It's a good thing, that there were no classes this day. I could lay down here as much as I like. A moment of peace and silence.
"Stop! This is not going to lead me to hear you out that the dream turns out to one makeup session because I don't to hear the rest of the story" He said in must force and fake disgust in his voice.
I took him in my embrace in an eager, passionate way and my tongue seemed to disappear inside his mouth as he let my tongue slip past his redden lips and I dive desperately as if I needed a part of him to breathe.
"What do mean 'you can't' ?" Malfoy asked as he slowly turns to me, curious about what I have to say.
"What?" Hermione asked as she gasped for air. It seems Hermione wasn't able to hear it from this distance.
"I wrote to Severus, a letter explaining your stay with me during my vacation leave that leads him in informing Dumbeldore. So, the headmaster is aware of your situation." He said as he was playing with my fingers, fiddling them while gently squeezing them.
The irony, the book kind of like talking about me except it's not a split personality. It is another creature inside of me. "What's its title?"
"There is still some." Hermione said as one of her eyebrows raised up and with a 'You're weird' expression on her face as she stared at Ron. "Here, I saved some for you guys."
I open my mouth and took a bite. Heaven. That's the word that entered my mind as soon as the flesh and blood entered my mouth. Bite after bite, my consciousness slowly returns to me. I was becoming aware that I was eating Malfoy's hand and he offered it to me, with no fear in his eyes or disgust. Even though, I vaguely remember his conversation with Hermione, his eyes that were watching me as I feed was my only concern. That emotion that he was showing had hit me so much that my eyes unwillingly let out tears.
Malfoy turned his head slightly towards me but he didn't let his eyes wander off from Harry's enraged state as he held onto his wand tightly and pointed it at my friend.
"These butterflies are called Hemotropic butterflies or Darah Naga, which means Blood Dragon. As you can see, they are crimson in color." Malfoy pointed out. "They originally came from Zevil Island and got transported here by illegal catchers, thus now they are most likely can be seen at the heart of the Forbidden forest. Their main food is blood."
"Hmmp...that's not the reason, why I am worried about it." Hermione gave a nasty glare at Ron, which made her almost lose her footing.
"Bastard!" Ron hollered in anger. His whole face turns red, making him look like a tomato. "Are you saying I am selling my sister to Harry?!"
“How? Where?” Hermione asked in a surprised tone. She was just as bewildered as me at the thought of us hunting in the deep forest.
Some reacted immediately upon hearing the food of choice of the butterflies. The girls that were lingering close to the bottle, backed off a yard away. Some took out their wands in a ready stance. But almost half of the Slytherins were relaxed and didn't made a move or flinch like they already know about it.
I dropped his arm suddenly as if I was stung by his words, blood started to climb up to my cheeks as I heard his accusation. "No, it's not." I weakly denied it.

She grinned at me,  as she knows why I still irritated at her. Dressed in her light brown hunting gear: long sleeves shirt with black leather armor patches on her vital areas and tight leather pants with a dragon -scaled boots, courtesy of Draco, she was sitting down in one of the cushioned-sofa as she was waiting for me beside was Draco with his black turtle-neck long sleeves shirt emphasizing his pale skin, skin-tight cargo pants - leaving no need for imagination what was beneath them, and a  half-metal chest plate covering only his left pectoral as the leather straps tied and wrapped his upper torso enhancing his muscles.
"Hermione!" I grumbled at her as she suddenly laughed. Forcing her to set her mug down on the bedside table as she laid down on the bed, trying to control laughter.
After that, the mood carried on for the rest of the journey. We didn't talk much as we change into our school robes, and we were still quiet when the Hogwarts express slowed down at last and stopped at Hogsmeade station.
Remus' facial expression changed, abruptly, when I ask the last question. The flicker of the emotions was so fast but I caught one in particular which is - off guard.
He leaned close to me as his face was an inch away from me. "Harry, If you don't like this, just push me away." He muttered as his lips descended on my own. Soft and sweet with a hint of mint to it, that was Draco's taste as he kissed me into total oblivion.
I don't know how long I stood there, motionless. I don't know what was happening to me but I know one thing that is for sure that my heart was breaking into pieces.
In an instant, I was nothing but a beast hungry for the blood and flesh that I sought. No trace of theme, Harry Potter, the human being. No shred of human remains within me.
He slowly took the newspaper from my hands as he remains by my side and his eyes run all over the article as he finishes reading, a flash of disdain and grimace was etched across his face.
Unconcerned by our reaction, Draco continued. "Could you let go of Father's insult, Uncle Sirius, just for the day? He isn't in the best condition these days. I would much appreciate it."
'Hmm... Your down-fall? I'm not sure. but for now, I am going to enjoy You, Harry.' She giggled and her voice faded in the back of my mind.

A burst of hot searing anger filled my lungs as the air that I breathe in, turns painful. I just want to punch his stupid face. To fucking hit so many times. To see blood flow from every hit I inflicted on him. To make him feel pain. I felt my whole body quiver in ecstasy as the mere thought of making Michael bleed. Then I step towards him with much interest to make it all happen.
Leaning against the door, with his blonde hair free-falling from his head, was the immaculate Draco Malfoy.
"Harry lay down for a bit," George said as he stood outside the comfort room. There was a gentle patting on my back, Ginny was already by my side, comforting me.
"Yeah..." I said, absent-mindedly as I followed him as he took his undetected wand and cast the levitation charm on Hermione and we took her to her bed. We took off her slippers and put her comforter on her but Hermione did not even wake up from all the movement. "She must have been too tired."
"You should give it up as I did, Harry," Hermione said as she pointed her fork at me then took some jam and started spreading on her toast. "It's a nonsense subject. You should get some sensible ones like Arithmancy or Advance Alchemy."
George started to look bashful as he put both of his hands in his pant's pocket. "Yeah, I'm fine now." He said with a goofy smile and swoon voice. Then they started laughing again.
Looking down at the grass near my feet, avoiding Malfoy inquiring eyes. "I can't eat. Everything that I eat is tasteless in my mouth except when..."
"What did you think I was talking about, Harry?!" Hermione answered with another question as a smirk appeared on her lips. A familiar smirk that I know too well.
'Yes, that's is correct.' She said sensually. 'Its good thing your too stubborn not to let others check you when you started having your nightmares and now I almost completely merge with you. Only what is left is half of your mind and the soul. Hehehehehehe...' She triumphs said with such vigor and happiness that made me hate her so much and at the same time made me feel terrified of what she said.
Before I could take a bite, Draco called out for my attention. “Yes?” I asked as I was holding the croissant before my lips. I was seriously hungry.
Noticing the dark sky and the moon and stars have already risen, I realized that it must have been hours since then. I blushed in embarrassment. "Sorry for you to see me like that."
Out of nowhere, ropes encircle me, bounding me to the nearest tree, strong and tight. I snarl in frustration as I snap my jaws at the newcomer. Angry for hindering my mealtime.
"Ah. Tsk! Tsk! Let me finish first before any of you, starts to complain" He said as he wiggles his finger at us, as he has notice Hermione started to open her mouth, with her alarm expression.
The blonde sighs. "Alright. But be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
Laughter invaded the whole common room as relief and gratitude spread in my chest. I'm really blessed to have them.
"Darah Naga" I muttered, quietly. As I felt a tinge of jealousy directed to the Queen butterfly. 'Good for you! Someone is caring for you, unconditionally' I whispered to the butterfly on Malfoy's head.
"I have been researching these past few days before I escape from Hogwarts. In those books, there have been clues on what might have happened and what have you become, Harry." Hermione stated as she absent-mindedly reminisces her facts hunting in the library. "I tried feeding you fresh animal blood and it seems like it kind of work out. And I am here because I am your friend, Harry. What a silly question!"
I can tell that Ron was trying to rack his brain for something to cheer me up as I saw his reflection from the window's glass pane, fidgetting his fingers and shifting his weight from one leg to another.
"I really want to tell you about our experiment when you are done with your food." Hermione sighed heavily. "Draco, you should have waited."
'Go away, Demon!' I tried to shove her away from my mind. Why would she choose to show herself right now? I am on the verge of dying right here.
After two weeks of being confined, it felt good to be outside again.  Hermione came by my side with the same relief smile as mine. We both gone through the same ordeal so we understand each other the most these past few days. Being under the surveillance by the adults, who either think that I'm too fragile to even hold a glass of water by myself or thinks I'm too unsafe to sleep in the same room with my best friend, it was so suffocating and frustrating. It was almost a miracle they let me and Hermione be out in the open.
"I wish we could forget the outside world. Stay as we were." Hermione muttered as she flips the pages of the book without actually reading it. "Grow old, the three of us. Together."
Ginny run-up to my side, trying to see if I was seriously injured. She whispered. "Are you alright?" I whispered back to her to spare her from worrying so much. "I'm fine"
As if inspecting me, he took his time searching through every feature of mine then he grabs my arm and pulled me towards the bed.
We dashed as fast as we can, following behind us closely we're the hungry creatures. I saw a flicker of movement to our left, then a giant hobgoblin appeared, apparently, its target was Hermione as it reached out to grab her hair. Draco immediately reacted by pulling her but was a bit slower than the Hobgoblin. I raced over and brace my body as I smashed my back and shoulder to the snarling Hobgoblin then we came tumbling as we lost balance.
Taking a sip from my cup as I try to feel comfortable with the tension of attraction that sits between us. I felt awkward about how to go about this situation but at the same time, I felt impatient as I just really want to touch him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malfoy gripped his hands, and then took a hold of my shirt. Angerly, he shrieked. "I don't need your pity, Potter!"
"It's fine, Harry. I know that you are still having problems with whatever that is bothering you. Nightmares? That's suck." Ron said as he was hovering beside me with his broom. I can see he was trying to understand my current situation. "Hermione had told me, all about it. Just remember, we're here for you. For always."
"I know! But Harry is HARRY!" Hermione shouted more as she put more force but she was held by the twins as they also came running to restrain Hermione.
I slowly came into consciousness from my deep sleep and started feeling my whole body. My senses took over as it tells me that I am safe wherever I was. I felt the soft satin mattress underneath my body on where I lay, caving in from my weight, and the fresh cool breeze that came from (I guess) a nearby window as it gently tangles up my wild hair. The fragrance blew by me was a mixture of pines, lavender, and freshly wet earth that told me that I am still near the woods. I could hear the birds' chirping, the rustling of the leaves of the trees, creaking of the branches, and the muted voices of two people that I could distinguish that belong to a girl and a boy.
Pansy had found him as she appeared from the doorway with a worried look written all over her face and gestures. "I've been looking for you. Why are you here?"
"We should do must we could do." Ron said as he yawned then stretch both of his arms then slightly curved his back backward.
I felt relief that I almost sagged against the tree. Deeply breathing in and out as joy swam inside my chest.
As soon I heard her voice, I turn to her. Staring at her pale face, as she forces a smile. I asked her. "Are you alright?"
After hearing that name, both Mrs. Weasley and Mr. Weasley along with Remus and Sirius's faces morphed into shock then into an unreadable expression.
I inhaled deeply, shaking my nerves desperately before releasing slowly. "Okay, I will tell you everything but first, we need to help Harry. I promise you that. So, please help us.
Disclaimer: This scripture was based from the characters and scenes from the astonishing novels: Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and as an aspiring writer, I have no rights and claims to these fantastic novels but I dare say, what I only own are the ideas in this tale: HUMAN
I laughed as the scene unfolded in front of me. The adults smiled as if hearing my chuckle assured them. With so much energy, Sirius jogged beside me and swing his arm over my shoulder. "It's nice to see you being so well"
"Well then, I will be leaving first." She said as she turns towards the door and closing it afterward.
Michael Corner with his friends, he was sneering at me with transparent hate in his eyes. For the past 3 weeks, after the whole discussion with Professor Dumbeldore. Corner had been acting more like a bully to me more than Malfoy and his merry men - who were in fact had been weirdly quiet after his issue with Parvati. It seems to be that Corner took it upon his self: the task - that Malfoy abandoned, which is being a bully except his cruel jokes and upfront animosity is only towards me.
"You do look horrible, Harry" Hermione observed as she sat across me. "I think you should go to Ms. Pomfrey. You have been acting weird lately." Then she added in a hushed tone.  "It's been weeks since we met the Headmaster, Harry. Are you still having the nightmares?"
"Y-you know Potter, a-as I like to laugh at yo-your being foolish. Hehehe... You really need to eat. I don't want to be accused of preventing the golden boy from eating thus YOU fainting from hunger." He said as he had to finish his fit of giggles.
"Really?" Ron asked as his blue eyes grew wide. "Blimey...I think I should also start working out. That's why you got buffy this year."
"Close your mouth, Granger! It's very unladylike," he grumbled as he saw my face. "Here -" He places the tray on the bed beside me."- eat and take this-" He spoke as he drops a vial at my lap. "Don't worry it's not poison. It is Pain relief potion."
"Really, Weasley!" Michael snapped at him. "Your pretty good at playing suck up, Huh?! Sucking up to Potter even now. When you have already used your sister!"
Mr. Weasley came rushing in and grab the two -mirror from Mrs. Weasley. In a hushed voice, he talked to the person on the other of the mirror. "Yes, what happens?"
Maybe, Yesterday's event had something to do with it. Whatever it is, I'm grateful that Malfoy had invaded my thoughts. He seems had driven my demon away last night. I got up and made way to the bathroom - to freshen up and got dressed up for breakfast after all Sirius and Remus are still here, I still have to ask them about that incident. After the excitement from yesterday, I temporarily forgot all about it.
Out of nowhere, a large Acromantula about half the size of an adult elephant leaped unto us. It's a good thing, my instinct had kicked in as I automatically skidded to my right thus I was able to avoid being crash to the ground. As the black acromantula realizes that his prey escapes him, his pincers clicked more vigorously in anger then came for us. Behind it, were others racing to reach us as well.
'Hmmm...He knows about it but he won't tell you.' The demon whispered in my head. 'What could it be? That he couldn't tell you, his best friend's son.'
The voice said. As another quake shook and the ground under Hermione began to crack open. Hermione screamed in fear as she started to fall between the cracks on the ground. Being near her, I jump towards her then grab her hand but the shaking of the ground was too strong, making me difficult to maintain my balance and to lose my grip - the only way to save her was to pull her out with my strength and then throw her against my weight but as soon as I did that - I will be the one to fall into the pit that had formed.
"So, what questions you might have for me, Granger?" He asked as he arranged himself then made a cue at Tiffany to get him some tea.
I rose from my slumber trying to leap up and twist to turn away from her but my body wouldn't budge from where I lay. As I open my eyes, I saw thin silver chains had wrapped around my body, which was hindering me from moving.
3. Jiangshi (I am not hopping around, Moine by Harry) (Stop that, Harry. not to Undead that hops, I don't know with the taking life force from the living creature by Hermione)
I don't really know if they are really treating me as an adult - only in times that I have to face the Dark Lord and always as a child with any other decisions in my life?
"Yes, Harry. I also want to hear about that?" Hermione took a serious tone again as she also sat down beside me this time.
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger. What are you all doing here?" She asked in a surprised tone as if she didn't saw the three of us as she entered the room earlier.
Even his words are still full of sarcastic aura, I could identify his concern for my well being. Maybe I could tell him about HER...
"Hmm...resting in one of the rooms." He answered slowly in a relaxing manner which helps me release the tension in my shoulders that I didn't know I had.
"Are you done?" A voice came from behind me. I turned immediately and saw  Draco Malfoy from the door.
Everyone's attention turns to us as soon as I spoke. The whole class has gone quiet and been looking over our table as Professor Trelawney speculate my teacup in wonder, turning it over and over - trying to decipher the image in the cup.
"Harry, dear, what's wrong?" Mrs. Weasley asked as she seems to have noticed the untouched food on my plate. Frowning, she pushed it towards me. "You're not even eating, dear. Is the food not to your liking?"
And as I waved the snitch to the Gryffindors, loud cheers burst from the crowd. I slowly landed on the ground as my teammates' run-up to surround me. Almost breaking my neck as the twins lunged at me than settling their arms on my shoulder. Ron also came with a wide grin as if it was about to slip his face into two from being too wide. Ginny slide between the cheering guys and landed a kiss on my cheek that invited teasing yaps from them. The festive vibe erupted in the middle of the field as gleeful shouts, merry hollers, and delighted squalls can be heard from the distance.
Turning away, He walks at the center of the field, holding the bottle filled with butterflies and placing it in front of him. Waiting for the whole class to pay attention to. As the others gathered around him. Malfoy began his lecture.
I jerk up, awaken suddenly, as the sound of the rustling of the leaves and, a group of footsteps can be heard. Every thought of mine was in high definition as my eyes focus at the entrance of our tent unto the thick woods of the forest of Dean. My heart was pumping, my mind was empty as I was still dazed from being startled awake but my instinct was at its edge. As my head loses its cloudiness and everything became clear. My newly upgraded senses tell me that we, Hermione and I were not the only ones in the woods, right now. I could hear it from the outside of the tent, the sounds of breathing that wasn't mine or Hermione's. I don't know how did they have found us even with Moine's quick thinking that we should set-up a tent surround by concealing charm. I listen intently, as I slowly move to Hermione's sleeping area to wake her up.
"Granger, can you hear me?" Malfoy spoke gently at me as I stood there, staring at them in a complete daze. Blinking to awareness, I moved towards quickly.
Sighing heavily, he took his coffee-sipping silently before speaking again. "Granger, some people are a strong believer of light and dark.  For them, there is no space for the gray side. If you are evil then you're only evil. If you are good, for them, you are only good. There is no neutral. For them, there is only black and white. Do you get what I mean, Granger? That is the philosophy of the society that we are living with, today."
"Laugh if you want" Malfoy uttered. His body unconsciously stiffens as if to guard himself against us, to whatever taunting he had expected.
Sighing heavily while rolling his eyes, he made an expression that looks like 'I am talking to idiots.' He turned to the Ravenclaws as well. "I think it will turn better for anyone, especially to your team, Corner."
By the long run, the Acromantulas were still on our tail and Hermione did her best to distract them with her spells, blasting them off. As I try to focus on escaping and suppressing my blood lust. It was getting harder and Hermione seems to have noticed my suffering as she did her best to help me. Muttering encouragement and trying to soothe me. But I was so bloody hungry I felt stoned. The numbness was slowing and creeping through-out my body and I fear that the longer this chase will be, I would lose control sooner or later and I might give in to the bottomless dark hunger within me that I just want to bite off the flesh from Hermione's neck.
"Harry," Moine spoke in a hard but warm tone at me. "I want you to listen to me, calmly and don't let your emotion best you."
But what got me in contemplating is my demon. She has been showing less and less, the last time she appeared to me is when Draco almost saw her through the mirror, which was a month ago. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy for her to just disappear and never come back but I feel that the more she is away, the more she is preparing a bigger and nastier surprise for me.
"Anyway, what's their use? To beautify you!" Seamus said as he, Neville, and Dean were standing near us. "I can't think of anything that could make you bring any creatures for Professor Hagrid but for you brag it about."
In my horror, the news was referring to me. Apparently, Rita Skeeter got a hold of an interview with a few of the students of Hogwarts, retelling her the events that happen on that faithful day. The story scaled from facts to absolute made-up details as my appearance as one commented - was randomly changed into a more monster-like feature and I can really tell that Rita was having a field day as she added more and more - making me look like a demon. Unknowingly, as I was listening to the news; my fist balled up and I was unconsciously growling under my breath which I did only notice after Hermione change the station of the radio. Like waking up from being trance, I look up to Hermione and she gave me that apologetic smile.
"I don't know" Ron croaked out, awkwardly. "But my guess is it's very bad. Mom and Dad are both shaken from whatever news they heard about Dad's workmate."
"Who's there?" Malfoy shouted as his whole body made a stance, guarded, and ready to fight. The queen also hovers, ready to protect Malfoy for any threat.
"Unpleasant? Hmm... Like SOW. Are you talking about yourself, blood traitor?" Mr. Malfoy went further with that then Hell break loose. Sirius and all the Weasleys, even Mr. Weasley went for it, stomping toward him with their raised fists and angry faces. I also couldn't stop my anger as I marched towards them. I can hear the girls telling us to stop but Mr. Malfoy was asking for it. Then unexpectedly, Draco Malfoy steps in front of his father, shielding him from us. Sirius almost hit Draco as he was standing between Sirius and his father. It was a good thing Sirius was able to stop his strike.

Then out of nowhere, the alarms sound out. Hermione and I were on full alert as we immediately stood and pulled out our wands.
"I didn't see any creatures or trace of a nest, Professor," Hermione said. "But I saw a graffiti or runes of some kind."
Additional note from the author: This chapter is representing the level of relationship of Harry's friends with each other. This is intended for the sole purpose of you feeling the emotion that Harry is actually feeling in regards to his friends and loved ones.
I couldn't tell him the reason because only a lunatic can see another person in the mirror and even hear voices in one's head.
I struggle to come out of words that I could say to her but it seems to be I run out of words itself. Then again, I need help and what are the best people to talk it about but my best friends.
She took a step forward and I notice that she wasn't wearing anything. She was truly beautiful with her body- she was lean, had the right muscles, pale and soft looking skin, unmarred, smooth, and flawless. Her voluptuous body, Slender and narrow-waisted, lascivious curves with ever nooks and corners. I admire the body but I couldn't desire it instead I fear it.
I sat up immediately as soon as I heard her voice. I knew who was it - My demon. "Shut up!" I yelled openly and unrestrained. I had enough! "Leave me alone!!!"
The smell of flesh attracted me as soon it was on my sight. My stomach didn't only grumble in hunger, it also twisted in pain. I immediately seized for the chunk of meat and loaded it on my plate. I took a sizeable amount in my mouth and the taste was instant - it was marvelous. If only it was rawer, it would have been better. I begin devouring it with vigor even ignoring the other menu. As if there was an empty pit in my stomach, an insatiable monster that was only into eating flesh and -
I smiled at her then decide to make her twirl. Gasping, she manages to catch up with what I was trying to do. Jokingly and awkwardly, trying to dance with her like the rhythm of the song speed up. Taking turns to make each other twirl into the music, jumping and bouncing like a couple of children. Laughing once awhile as we trip with our careless steps. And as the song slowly comes to an end, we end-up embracing each other; knowingly trying to comfort one another.
My demon spoke in my mind than like an electric zap in my head and booming pain spread through me. I clutch both my hands over my head as I gasp in pain.
After an hour, Professor Trelawney slowly walks table to table to check on the activity that she instructed us. Commenting on the results and the figures in each teacup of each of her students. I felt a sudden burst of irritation as she reached for us. I'm sure she is going to say something about my untimely death. Again! Just get on with.
"Shut it, Ron." Ginny barked as she stood from her seat, making my arm fall off from her shoulder. "I can do what I want to do!"
"He is dangerous, Hermione!" He replied as he was still staring at me, with - some kind of emotion - disgust!
"Harry, I am so sorry," Hermione whispered as she tried to approach me. Remorse was painted on her face as she drew closer and patted my back.
Amazed by his proposal. All both opposing sides started at him, unbelievingly. Fred reacted faster than any of us. "Are you crazy, Malfoy?"
I almost smile at Hermione's chattering. Trust Hermione to be calm in these kinds of situations. "I am not silly, Hermione." Then I froze. "Escape?"
I was flabbergasted by the fabricated lies that were written all-over the newspaper that when reached the port of Corner's interview, I have almost torn the newspaper into pieces.
"Sure," I said as I re-adjust my eyeglasses. I still wore them, not to elicit suspicion, instead, I removed the graded glasses and replaced them with ordinary ones.
Message: Thank you for staying in tune with my story and if I am bothering you with my style of writing, I am sorry.
I took a single breath and glanced at Hermione as she nods with much determination. "Let us hear them, Draco."
"I have to stop Draco influencing you too much, Hermione. You're becoming more like him with your everyday interaction." I muttered as I was annoyed by it.
"This had been going on for the past two weeks, Harry." She gingerly whispered. "It's worsening. It's odd."
"I don't know, Ron," Hermine said seriously. "I need to research about that locket and even Britain's old council of wizards and witches."
"The Daily Prophet's headlines were about Dead-eaters attack a small muggle village a little far from Hogwarts" Hermione muttered as she straightens up, she took one of her books, to have a light reading. "But that was two weeks ago."
From afar, a female voice cried out. "Harry!" She weeping as she walks weakly towards me then abruptly running towards the blonde male. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, the ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have work. But this...I just don't know what to do. Please Malfoy help us!"
I straighten from my crouched and release Michael, who was beneath me. He had scratches from my nails but I was stopped by Hermione from doing more damage.
"Mr. Malfoy!!!" A younger male voice, like a first-year, called out. Then a female with must older sound, like the 6th year. Then another sounded out. It seems the whole Slytherin was trying to find Malfoy and from the tone of their calls- they are worrying or some of them are in panic tones.
Still, dazed, I look at the tray - a bowl of porridge and a glass of milk and I look at the vial at my lap, I smiled. Would you look at that! Who might have guessed that there was a cute side on Malfoy?
It's been more than a month ever since 'that incident' happen at Hogwarts, Hermione and I have been able to settle down here at Draco's tiny manor.  A lot has happened since then. Doing trial and error of what to expect from my change or speculating where did this curse come from for me to change but there's one thing for certain: it's high time now that Draco goes back to school.
"No, I'm just got dizzy, Mrs. Weasley. I'll be fine in no time." I said as I gently stood up, assessing the strength of my legs.
"Yes, we do need to." Professor McGonagall pinched both of her lips intensely patient. Then she saw us in the corner of the room.
Screams and yells in horror followed and fear to reign them all. Others came in to surround me with their wands up and on defense while others run for their life into safety. All the suddenly, From being their champion, that they cheered and revenue and now I am a horrid monster that they are trying to get rid of.
Note: I am sorry for the delay. Busy as hell because of the Quarantine And COVID cases uprising here in my place, especially when you a health care provider. Oh well! On to the story.
"Good afternoon to all of you, young minds" A wishy-washy voice came about. Professor Trelawney had arrived with her huge eyeglasses, threatening to fall from her face. "Today, we are to unfold and clear the paths of our future, take a glimpse of whatever lies within our souls."

"Hmmm..ahk...mmh..mmmmmh...agh!" I could hear his muffled moans and his ragged breaths as he shuddered continuously while I licked every corner of his sweet and seductive crevice. His legs were shaking as he sliding down to the floor. I released my hold on his face and grasp his hips as I raised him and made him leaned against my body, creating no space between us. I shiver with anticipation as I move forward to make him mine
Hesitating and unsure, I clobber down the stairs as I peek out the window. It was already late at night, the stars and the moon were already high above the sky.
"Demon. Like the creature in the Church had been talking about or the Gulon?" Hermione confirmed as she stood up to sit beside me.
"What do you mean 'why I am here'? This is my cabin, Harry." He answered with one of his eyebrows raised.
"Well then, I will be leaving first." She said as she turns towards the door and closing it afterward.
His soft blonde hair that wasn't gelled back, his elegant pose as he sips his chocolate drink looks beautiful and sexy, his skin that was healthy pale and smooth as I had felt when I've held him, his grey eyes that brightens in interest or darkens with desire when we kissed and those lips...
That's the last thought in my mind as darkness invaded and I heard Malfoy's shouts as I fell asleep.
"You better be!" She giggled as she pretended to scowled at me then walk away. Ron stood between the door and the bed where I laid. As he can't decide if it's okay to leave me and go after Hermonie or should he stay with me as a good friend.
My whole body was shaking as my stomach felt empty when I just had eaten something so delicious. As I reach out, slowly I pulled the blood-soaked cloth as I saw what underneath it.
"Hoy, Malfoy. Get out. You're not welcome here." Ron stood from his seat as he marched up to Malfoy. Malfoy stood there without a word, a bored look etched across his face as he stared down at Ron. Then a commotion was heard outside.
Pain and anger crawled around my chest on all fours until I was panting from the ugly, familiar feeling. Then in vengeance, my hunger kicks me in the guts, hard and fast. With the swirl of anger, pain, and hunger, I swayed then shifted as fast I can to maintain my balance.
I sighed again as I climbed down the stairs and reached the living room while I re-arrange my dark grey shirt, black baggy cargo pants, and laced up high cut hunting boots.
My eyes turn to bulge as the offer was given by no other than Draco Malfoy, the heir of a pureblood family, that hated muggles. Especially, since, I have come to know the reason behind the said animosity. With no other choice and I am too stunned to say anything, I just nod my head at him.
With much force in my legs, I push forward and raised my left claw as I reach for her, hitting her by the left shoulder. As I have hit hard, she stumbled and fall to the ground. Seeing that she had let go of that dangerous stick, I took and throw it.
"Molly" Mr. Weasley beckoned, breathlessly. "I have to go. They need me there. I have to stop him before he does something drastic from his anger."
"Granger, you should sit down before you fall asleep on your feet." Malfoy quietly spoke from the doorway, as he stood there observing her and Harry.
Fred stood up and imitated Ginny's walk, exaggerating his version of Ginny's hip swaying. "Are alright now, Harry?" Fred said in a fake feminine voice then he futtered his lashes towards his twin.
Then in one crazy second, my reflection smirked at me and all I could do is stare at it. Slowly, The image in the mirror morphed into her. My nightmare was slowly creeping to my reality.
"Mate! MATE! HARRY!" Ron's recognizable voice bellowed as he too came near me, he must have been kneeling above my head as his sweaty scent, a mix of pumpkin and meat, tingle my nose. "Professor, he was healed already then why?"
"Mom, Its summer. Let them relax a little bit." Ginny came out as she walks to me. "Are alright now, Harry?"
"Potter, you're really a piece of work, aren't you?" He grumbled as he walks towards me, kneeling in front of me, and took my injured hand as he examined it. He took out his wand as he uttered a spell to remove the debris of glass shards, cleanse it, and lastly, healed it with a potion from his pocket as he added a few drops on my hand. Hissing as the potion took effect, the flesh mended together then he finally let go of my hand.
Realizing what I have said, a sudden burst of fear erupted inside my chest. I look up to see her face - it was filled with confusion and worry. I sighed relief at what I saw. Hah! I have been doing that a lot - sighing.
"How-" I began to utter but caught myself from asking. I blushed as I realize I was about to open up, of all people, is with Malfoy.
"They have realized that it was not your fault, Harry. Finally!" He sarcastically rolled his eyes. "That, your transformation might be trigger from according to Dumbeldore's words 'by a certain accident' and he would like to help you. He is also willing to take you back to Hogwarts with Hermione to continue your studies as they will clear everything to the school and the public of what really happens. He also said that he informed your two guardians and a message was sent to them to return as soon they received the note."
"Come on, Harry," Hermione said as she tugged on my sleeves as she rushed me and Ron. We headed towards Headmaster Dumbledore's office. It was a good thing, it was weekend therefore almost all the students as well as the professors - were off somewhere to relax rather then they stay on the hallways which helped me that much since I really want to maintain this topic as a secret.
"WEAK, POTTER!" He smirked at me, as he panting heavily. I growled and stood up abruptly, my blood thumping with vengeance. With my own two hands, I grabbed his head and brought my knee cap to his nose, there was a blunt crack and I released his head. Crimson leaked from both his nostrils and his nose was twisted, crooked - broken.
"Ron..."Hermione grumbled. "I was helping Harry. He had a nightmare and got sick." She helped me as we made our way to my bed. Ignoring Ron as he skidded over. " Unlike you, who is sleeping beside him, slept through his screaming like a dead pig."
I held up my hands cause I didn't know where to put them in case, I might accidentally place them somewhere inappropriate.
In my last-minute decision, I did what I had to do. Throwing her out - to be able to save her then I fell into the dark hole. Knowing I saved my friend, I turned towards the pit, complete darkness engulfs me as I fall further than I slowly lost my consciousness as I hear the voice again.
I felt miserable. As I felt my fears, worries and I am beaten-down inside. I am sick and tired of all of this. I want to have some peace. Tearing up as I face down with my palms covering my face.
"Malfoy, either explain to us the commotion outside or get out and go to them to make them shut up," Hermione said testily, look up from the book, she was reading awhile ago.
"We were to discuss an important matter with the Headmaster. But I guess it could wait." I said, unsure as I glance back and forth from her to Malfoy.
I open my mouth but no sound came out as I wanted to reassure her that I wasn't mad at her but no words came out from me. I could not form a convincing sentence to let her know that I wasn't affected by the news because I already expected it that much.
Someone nudged me. "Harry, it's almost finished. The sorting" Ron smiled at me. "Food please hurry up"
"For this matter, I will be the one to send the result and explanation regarding the situation to the Malfoy's family." Professor Snape spoke after a while.
I sighed again as I climbed down the stairs and reached the living room while I re-arrange my dark grey shirt, black baggy cargo pants, and laced up high cut hunting boots.
After a long discussion with both respected team's captains, Oliver Wood and Roger Davies, they came up with an agreement of keeping the commotion quiet with a bargain that the Ravenclaws giving up their practice slot to us, Gryffindor. Captain Roger Davies apologizes for the inappropriate action of his team members since he wasn't aware of what we're doing. Of course, it also goes that both I and Michael can't go to Pomfrey for our injuries.
I stood thinking deeply as to what to do and to reassess the current situation as Harry and I, both, lost our belongings from the spiders' attack along with our food and water supply as well as our tent.
"That's good, Harry. We get to go back," Hermione laughed as she jumped out of her seat out of excitement.
"So, do tell of these - experience and theories," I said as I gritted my teeth together as I tried to lessen my irritation.
It was Michael Corner. I still remember his face frozen from the terror that came and had taken his life, mouth open from the screams - blood oozing from his body, that was brutality torn apart. But the one that had me, shaking from fright and guilt was his hollow eyes that were staring blankly at me.
"No, your not." Hermione was in full-blown panic as she tried to climb down from my arms. "Let me go, Harry. I can run. I have to set a barrier. PLEASE!!!" She was desperate as I tried to ignore her cries. Finally giving in to her pleas as I nod my head at her. Then slowly I let her off and I took out my wand as I protected her while she prepares her spells for the barrier.
"Hmm... You right. His actions are very unusual but I have a theory for that." She said confidentially.
I look up at my savior. It was Draco Malfoy. He held out a hand and I took it. I slowly stood up and as I rise, all the blood had seemed to have vanished. Puzzled, I again faced Draco to ask how and why he was here in my dream but as I saw the same sincere look on his face, I just couldn't. I was mesmerized and have become speechless.
I started to wander will my suffering ever ends. Sometimes, I wish for any beast or creature in the forbidden forest to just end my misery but alas, they seem to avoid me in fear that I might feast on them in my burning hunger.
After giving me the small leather pouch, he walked away from me. Inside the pouch, were the same blood pebbles that he was feeding his butterflies.

More of the distress had sketched though Mrs. Weasley's face. The twins, who were just jostling around earlier also had tone down and were listening.
"Yes, he added a few drops of his blood a while ago," Hermione answered as she was still reading her newspaper. Her eyebrows were drawn in together as she was contemplating the latest news that Draco's eagle owl delivered this morning. "I guess somebody gossip to the tabloids our situation, Harry"
I just want to grab his hand and start drinking from it. Next, I will bite the flesh, pulling from the gap then chewing the -
Professor Minerva McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor house had come to guide us into the Great Hall. She was a tall, black-haired witch with a stern expression, who always wore her favorite emerald green robes.
"He's not worth it" Remus gritted. "Mr. Malfoy, I would appreciate if you would stop this and be best be in our own ways"
"Ever since that incident, both of us." I pointed at Hermione and then myself. "We were having nightmares. Am I right, Hermione?"
Immediately, Hermione took hold of some plates from Malfoy and started helping him in preparing the table. I stood there helplessly as I witness yet another shocking event that is happening, in front of me. Malfoy! He was setting the table and being nice to the house-elf.
