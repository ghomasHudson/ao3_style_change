There has to be something they missed, Ron. I am fairly certain. Even if there isn't, perhaps muggle depression is-"
"Even when I am like this?" he gestured to himself. Harry couldn't help but smile as draco's insecurity FINALLY made him resemble his Draco.
He grabbed the box, determined not to eat even one of the delicious treats and raced to their bathroom, where the blonde, as promised, was waiting, but hidden underneath the sinks, chatting with Myrtle excitedly about something and gesturing to a paper in his hand, then clutching it tightly to his chest as a content sigh left his lips.
When kreacher showed up with two plates, Draco shot an accusing look at Harry, who beamed at the first emotion Draco had displayed that day that wasnt entirely negative.
"we hardly made a good couple, potter." Draco said, trying to reel in his emotions, and Harry was frightened by how much Draco seemed to believe his twisted version of the story. There was only one thing to do right then. Afterall , if the blonde doesn't believe Harry's words, he can hardly deny his own memories.
“A curse was thrown at Ron, and Harry tried to push him out of the way, but- it hit Harry, instead,” she said, then added softly, “He’s going to wake up soon. This is just how the body deals with pain at first. They’ve given him the antidote, so he’ll wake up when his body feels well enough.”
"yes." he said softly and Draco looked about ready to say no to the proposal, "But losing you entirely will make me a lot more unhappy a lot faster, trust me."
Only then he Harry realize his mistake. He needed to work on that if he didn't want to be caught. He didn't want to risk losing whatever trust Draco still had in him, even though it felt nonexistent.
" Thank you for saying that." the blonde told him, smiling. "Anyways we need to get some food for you Pronto. And I won't take no for an answer. Kreacher!"
Draco looked at the floor and for a single gut-wretching second, Harry thought he would revert back to not talking to Harry anymore. Then, he did.
"what part of I want the sodding lights off during sex don't you understand?!!" 16 year-old draco had yelled at Harry, making him recoil. Harry reached out and put a Hand on Draco's knee, making him wince, courtesy of one of his father's cane punishments. Harry seemed to understand instantly and a dark shadow crossed his eyes.
Draco heard the incantation and suddenly ran to the door, trying to pry the knob off it, and started clawing at the wood frantically, while screaming at Harry to let him out. That's when the tears finally fell down Harry's cheeks.
" I won't say a word." she assured him, then grabbed a chair and sat next to him, looking him in the eye.
Draco was immediately reminded of all the times his hair was used against him. Images of Jashua dragging him through the halls to the bedroom by it, when it was way longer, hit him instantly and he had to suppress a sob. Fear gripped his entire body and took complete hold when he realized he was even more afraid of Harry noticing what was happening. He knew his work was getting sloppy and scrambled in his mind to remember how to give proper head but came up blank.
"do you want to send a letter to your boyfriend to let him know you're alright?" he asked, trying to sound causal. But draco immediately stiffened.
does something so revolting in my apothecary. Didn’t think you’d get caught did ya? Well them magical cameras ain’t for nothin’. Get out,” the old man gritted out, pointing at the door. Harry held his hands up in surrender and sighed, then rubbed his temple. His headache just wouldn’t go away.
“Yes, writing down orders and taking them to tables needs a lot of skills. They should compensate me as they would any muggle with my expertise,” he joked, waving the brunette’s concerns off. Harry only frowned deeper.
With that Harry pulled Draco out of the office and shut the door behind them. The blonde noticed the glares he was getting from everyone around them, but he didn’t care. He was more worried about Harry and his sudden surge in confidence. The blonde was almost certain that Harry hadn’t told anyone about his sexuality. Why would he do and say these things right now?
When Harry looked up, he saw that the blonde's gaze wasn't on him anymore. It seemed the worst had happened. Harry was so sure that Draco might say yes this time, but the blonde had seen and there was no way to take it back now. Harry followed Draco's eyes to see the stacks of books about depression and notes he had about Draco's condition, Draco's whereabouts, Draco's pain, everything about him and his progress.
End of the first part! Hope you liked it! Pleasant surprise/ obvious fact: the whole second part is up and has been since the first part was even a thing, so if you're interested in what happens next it's there. Thanks for sticking by the story and for all the comments, kudos, and such. They really do make my day.
“Y-yes, s-sir,” he stuttered out, trying to get his breathing under control. He wouldn’t have a breakdown again. He could easily be replaced at this new job in a heartbeat if he made any trouble for the boss. He just needed to get through the day and, then, it would be fine. He could cry about it when he gets home. For now, he needed to stay calm and avoid the many noises that surrounded him.
"What if I promise to oblivate you of me completely? If things don't work out? Would that make it easier to be my friend?"
He was snapped out of his thoughts when Harry suddenly jumped awake searching frantically on both sides of the bed with his eyes and hands for Draco. The sight made Draco's decision even harder on him.
Pomfrey seemed to deflate, then said" very well", left an envelope next to the unconscious blonde, and exited the room. Harry wasn't so easy to fool. He had seen through every lie the man had told. But, come to think of it, Draco really was never around on weekends.
"I-I U-Under-stand" he stuttered out, then gets up to leave. Only then dod Harry cast locking and silencing charms all over the house.
But they wouldn't stop. Harry had been listening to Draco's thoughts for two hours on end. At first he was curious, then worried, and that worry started to escalate into horrifying realizations. Draco had felt this horrible even when they were together. And Harry had thought his need for reassurance was cute? Draco's attitude was destructive and Harry hadn't done anything to help, even though now, 6 years after third year, he still had no idea what to do.
“You tolerating my presence shouldn’t be described as us getting closer!” the blonde gritted out, though he knew that’s not what Harry meant. He and the brunette had been having many moments, but the blonde would rather pretend they didn’t just to avoid any unnecessary stress from their already painful situation.
"W-what?" he asked frantically, not knowing how to phrase his question, too confused by the blonde's behavior and words. All he wanted was to get back to sixth year and stop Draco from breaking up with him. All he wanted was to turn back time for a second so he could change everything, but he couldn't. The ministry destroyed all time turners and it's too late eitherway. He could feel his Draco slipping through his fingertips and he was once again powerless to stop it.
" w-what are you talking about?" Draco said aiming for confused, but achieving a high-pitched whine. Another thing Jashua hates: emotions.
"I am really happy to hear that, Draco." Harry whispered, reaching out and taking both Draco's hands in his. He was just about to lean in for a kiss when Draco beat him to it. And, for a moment, Harry thought Draco had changed his mind. He thought that everything would turn out like he planned. That is, until Draco pulled back and gave him another sad smile.
And, sure enough, the red-head’s eyes instantly snapped towards the blonde, giving him a knowing look, but, to Draco’s surprise, he did nothing, merely looking away and shutting his eyes.
Harry's eyes shot at the floor, where many broken bottles lay, the ones that, presumably, caused Draco's injuries.
"You can take the cloak off you've hardly been careful with it today anyway. I sensed a presence the first day young Draco was here and every day since, but I would've never guessed it would be you."
It was a glimpse, but enough to instill the horrifying truth that he so desperately wanted to avoid: his draco was dead and the man he was seeing was merely a corpse.
Draco cleared his throat, then maneuvered backwards until his back rested against the tub, and his knees were up against his chest with his arms curling around himself.
As the potion started to take effect, Draco felt unbelievable pain in his abdomen, but refused to make a single noise or move. He deserves this. He was killing his own child. Father would be so disappointed.
"Alright. You can do the spell." draco said without even realizing it. Then looked up to see Harry wiling widely and nodding his head. He realized Draco and Harry's emotions vanished from within the Blonde. But, he still felt something linger: happiness with the choice. He didn't know if it was harry's or his own.
Harry could see Draco going through the memories of the last three days and cross-referencing them with everything he believed about Harry beforehand. The blonde seemed to deflate at the realization that he was, in fact, being manipulated by Jashua.
“Is there something else you wanted to talk about without insulting my mate?” Draco asked, still a bit annoyed by the elf’s earlier remark. Emmyl just shifted his feet and looked at the ground biting his lip.
Draco blinked, not fully comprehending what was happening, until he noticed he was shaking. He had given himself away. If only he had stayed in control for a few more seconds....
Draco hadn't thought about his shard for months, until he remembered.. Harry. His mind had cleared enough to think rationally. Jashua had lied to him in the past to keep him chained here and he wouldn't fall for it again. That would be foolish. Draco didn't want to be a fool anymore. He'd been one for long enough and he refused to do it anymore. Harry was alive. He had to be and Draco had to warn him.
"But you aren't! And we can be lovers again! Who said I don't like you? " Harry yelled back. He wasn't sure why. He felt like  if he shouted it loudly enough, Draco would finally get it through that thick head of his.
“Mate,” Ron said firmly, “we’re Aurors. Our job is to catch bad guys like the Dursleys and make them pay so they, and everyone else who thinks to act like them, would know that they won’t get away with it.”
He only knew that when he woke up, a full day later, Draco's bed was empty and Harry only stared at it in shock, tears spilling constantly down his as he laid still on his side, haunted by the made-up blankets on the bed that was previously occupied by Draco.
“I can’t do anything for him, Harry, at least, not directly,” the witch said, but continued quickly when Harry slumped against the wall in defeat and seemed ready to leave the room, “
"Bullocks! Who did this to you?" he asked angrily, gesturing at his face and hoping for Draco to just drop his mask already, but knowing he wouldn't.
The witch’s eyes snapped up to meet his. Harry squirmed as she glared at him for ten whole seconds with her mouth agape.
Draco buried his face in his hands and sobbed violently, but kept Scruffie in his lap. It was a good thing he couldn't see Harry because Harry thought he would've looked like a ghost. He couldn't think. He couldn't move to comfort the blonde. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't do anything but replay Draco's words in his ear. Jashua had seen him. Had drugged Draco repeatedly. Had raped and impregnated him. Had beaten him up. Had broken his legs. Had read him hateful words from the only person Draco had left in the world. Then, he had locked him up for five weeks. And it was ALL HARRY'S FAULT! Draco had asked him to leave multiple times. The blonde was terrified. He was fucking shaking! But no! Harry had to stay and yell and catch the attention of the whole goddamn supermarket. What if Draco had died that day? What if he had tried to kill himself again and was successful? Was if Harry had never gotten this amazing chance to see him again? His Draco would've died broken, pregnant from a man he despised, alone, depressed, and thinking Harry loathed him.
"Alright, Draco, I'll fix it." Harry said, deflated, then quickly cast a reparo on the letter, which Draco instantly folded and shoved down his trousers' pocket, clearly afraid that Harry would change his mind, then he opened his mouth and started to chew the cookie slowly.
Harry looked at him incredulously for a second, then the widest of all smiles plastered on his face. Draco thought he would say or do anything to keep Harry smiling like that.
He grabbed the pencil and notepad that the boss held out for him and smiled at the guy, then turned around. There were a lot of waiters, trays, customers, people... Where was he supposed to go? What was he supposed to say? What if they ask him about things he doesn’t know? What would he do then?
The blonde doesn't remember much after that. He just recalled pain as he clawed at the carpet with his hands, dragging his limb body across the sitting room, carefully avoiding Harry's eyes, and into the bathroom. It must've taken him half an hour to get there. When he finally made it to the toilet, he jolted himself up to his knees, stuck two fingers down his throat and coughed up all the remnants of the potions. He hoped it would be enough, but wasn't sure.
He reached upwards and tweaked Harry's nipples, then attacked them with his mouth, earning him a moan from the other man. Then, suddenly, he was being lifted and thrown onto his back on the other side of the bed with Harry on top of him, straddling his waist and taking off his shirt. He didn't need to worry about the scars or the mark or the way his wrists looked. The light was off, just like Draco had requested from Harry all those years ago.
"Of course he would!" Harry suddenly yelled, "That's the problem. The guy is insane. I would never do anything to you like he does. It's horrible. Please! You can't go back to him, please."
"To be perfectly honest, Mister Malfoy, I cannot detect a single thing wrong with your son." she started and the older Malfoy breathed out something that sounded like 'incompetent'.
"I know what I am doing, Harry. Don't worry." he said, then turned again. Harry couldn't stop himself.
“Harry, he has, presumably, been living this way his entire life. He is probably used to it by now. I know a life of pain doesn’t seem like one that could ever be good, but the human body can adapt to so many things, you’d be astonished. He probably doesn’t suffer as much as he used to anymore.”
"I don't know!" Draco yelled back, then the entire room suddenly went silent with the implication of his words.
" Alright..." Draco said tentatively, but seemed to have calmed down enough and Harry had counted that as a win. He gathered some shredded papers, two pens and an empty jar, then set them on the bed, called for kreacher to bring up two plates of food, then set about writing everything he thinks might help draco during this day. Even more, the things that could convince Draco that he should stay.
"What's wrong with eating out?!" Harry snapped, not knowing what he did to cause Draco to climb back into his shell. Draco mumbled something inaudible.
He simply didn't want draco to leave. He opened his mouth to say as much only to have draco cast a silencing spell on him. Upon realizing he couldn't speak, Harry started to sob silently, trying to understand what he had done wrong, what he could do to make draco listen to him. But it was too late. Draco had left the chambers, left Harry on the floor a sobbing mess.
He briefly recalled the blonde at age 15, sitting with Harry in his dark cupboard, telling him about his father's abuse, the darkness offering a weird sense of security, and how, as a child, he could only deal with it by hiding in small spaces. Draco always used to do that, though Harry never pointed it out. He just noticed the weirdness of having the blonde leave the entire castle and the safety of his room only to feel safe under the sinks in the bathroom, or, once in sixth year, though Draco refused to tell him why, under his bed in the room.
Zombies was a better description than patients when it came to the people being 'treated' inside the ward. You'd almost think it was a prison with the bars on every window and the guards at the exit. Every single spot of the ward was under surveillance and there were no gardens like the movies represented. The place was entirely closed off, the people inside doomed to become even more depressed. Harry heard a patient begging to use the phones with the nurse refusing and others were jittery and unstable from withdrawals. That was nothing compared to the showers and toilets that didn't have doors with nurses watching over the patients who used them.
"He loves me, Harry. I could never be a burden on him." Draco winds up saying, but Harry looks sad enough to have heard his while internal monologue.
It didn't work out. Privacy was another luxury he no longer had. After surviving two weeks on muggle streets, not bothering to look for any sustenance, he finally found it: that shard of glass. He still has it. He needs it. No matter how much time goes by, he always will. Draco ducked behind some dumpsters next to a hospital, hoping they could use his organs after he was gone. At least that would be one thing he could do for someone before he leaves the world. That's where Jashua found him, bleeding and unconscious. He brought him in and treated him, then insisted on taking care of him further. Draco still don't know why he didn't try to do it again. Maybe having a person who knew nothing of his past helped. Jashua didn't judge him. He loved him unconditionally. He took care of him and refused to let him even think about leaving his home after correctly assuming Draco had nowhere else to go. Of course, that was all a lie. Draco discovered a few months later that Jashua knew everything. He was a wizard and he was a muggleborn and he sometimes speaks of the horrors of the war and the death eaters without giving thought to how much it hurt Draco to be reminded of his actions. Draco didn't mind. He liked it. At least Jashua was being honest, not too gentle and coodling like Harry. He didn't give Draco what he wanted or needed. He gave him what he deserves.
After Draco stepped into the light, Harry spared no second in grabbing his hand and apparating them both straight onto the couch, where they were greeted by Scruffie who started to lick Draco's wounds? Harry gasped.
Harry immediately gasped as he was assaulted with what seemed like thousands of horrible thoughts and feelings all at once. Some from letters, some Draco's own, some in a voice he did not recognize. But they were all hateful, further destroyed and burying his draco. He felt cold and depressed and tired and restless and panicked and mortified and a thousand more, yet he could make out the thoughts as clear as day, though they didn't make him feel any better.
"I cried when I thought you died. It was worst day of m'life. We werent togetha bu I still love you."
"I've already made Jashua that promise" the blonde said quietly, and Harry instantly let go of both his hands and moved away from him to the other end of the couch, his eyes never leaving Draco's.
But Harry couldn't leave it alone. He left the journal behind the sinks in the bathroom where he had found it and, determined to put the whole thing behind him, he didn't say a word of it to anyone. But, a week later, the journal was gone from the bathroom and Harry still couldn't get it out of his mind. He started to look at Draco. Really look at him and he started to notice the tugging of his sleeves, and the silence. It seemed every word out of Malfoy's mouth was either an insult, an agreement to something his friends said, or nothing. It was as if he was programed not to speak a word of his own opinions, not to share his feelings, not to tell anyone anything. Only then did Harry know that whatever feelings Draco had harbored while writing to Harry, he still had them, and they seemed to have gotten worse.
Frightened that he would lose control of his tongue, spill a secret to a wrong person , and regret it forever.
"want me to show you?" Harry asked, and started hissing upon Draco's hesitant nod. As the sinks started moving, Draco jumped back, terrified, but Harry caught him.
He had to keep that in mind when he cast the spell, checked that it was working, and ap parted Draco back into the alley next to the supermarket. So much had happened since he had picked the blonde up there three days earlier, but he knew he had to put everything at the back of his mind now. If he thinks for a moment about what he had learned, how broken Draco is, and what his Draco was going back to, Harry would embrace him, take him home and lock him in there forever, away from the cruel world that did this to him. But he couldn't do that, not if he truly wanted Draco to be whole again. He had cast the spell again and what he heard from Draco's thoughts had crushed him. He needed Draco to trust him again. This was the only way.
“Don’t pity me! It’s not like that. I’ve just been very stressed lately and the wedding is planned smack down in the middle of the most important case of my Auror career and Ginny is freaking out about the planning which means we are driving each other crazy and sometimes that can hinder attraction. I won’t need those after the wedding. Ginny is perfect for me.” The brunette said harshly, then slammed the money on the counter.
Draco said nothing even though it pained him to be hurting his Harry. He couldn't keep his frustration with the brunette at bay, though.
"be careful over there. Don't drink anything he offers you. Try not to upset him too much. Be convincing with the story. Please don't get hurt." Harry said in one breathe. Draco looked at him, then laughed and shook his head.
So the brunette cast the best glamour he could given his limited experience and allowed the blonde to be taken away without a single word. He knew this was the only thing he could do with the older Malfoy standing a couple of feet away, but it hurt no less.
"But I confuse things... I remember things wrong and then I find out that they were right but that can't be right because right was wrong and wrong was normal and... I am not making any sense, am I?" he finished bitterly. Harry shook his head and, for a moment, Draco looked crushed, but then Harry took his free hand and looked him in the eyes.
The blonde’s features softened again as Harry’s hands squeezed his. The brunette furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. Does touching him lessen the pain somehow or was it something else that made Draco’s...episode go away?
"Y-you know what, H-Harry? Fuck you! You have N-no idea how hard it is f-for m-me. The th-thought of losing you… It Keeps me awake almost every night. You- danger always follows you around, Harry! You can't deny it. And-and it only got worse during the summer because I just-I knew. I could tell something was wrong and I was powerless to stop it and then you show up h-here looking l-like you've been starved and I've had nightmares about finding you dead or hearing about it. It's awful. And-and then you come here and laugh at m-me and s-say I am overreacting. I-I am not crazy, Harry! I am just someone who l-loves you and would rather kill themselves then see you get h-hurt!"
Harry just stood there, a few inches from the doorway, gaping at the blonde whom he had known ever since he was 11.
Draco simply shook his head frantically and desperately wiggled out of Harry's hold, clutching his head and trembling all over. He wasn't saying anything and Harry needed to know what was going on in his head. He needed to. Draco had that same look in his eyes, that same crazy look he had had the day before when he was threatening to take his own life and Harry was going mad trying to speak to him. His words were falling on deaf ears and Draco seemed to not be there anymore.
I know the tags say 'angst with a happy ending'. This isn't the end of the story, only the end of the first part. I've turned it into a series and, fair warning, the second part won't be published anytime soon. Thank you all for sticking with the story so far. I hope you enjoyed the first part!
The final scene was a day after the bathroom incident. Draco had been under an imperio and woke up not remembering what had happened, only to have Harry approach him on the astronomy tower at night. Upon seeing his face, Draco was ready to apologize and tell him everything and beg for his love and forgiveness.
" I need you to listen to me very carefully, potter." he whispered, though Harry flinched at the name," you have done nothing that warrants forgiveness from me or anyone else. You have done nothing wrong and you owe me nothing. Understand?"
Draco’s body was shaking a bit; he was hating the attention this guy was drawing to the blonde with the loudness of his voice.
Ron was talking down at him. He wasn't convinced Draco would get better. That didn't matter. What does Ron know anyway? What does anyone know? Even if specialists haven't made progress, Harry would. No one would be as determined as he was at the moment. Perhaps the matter was a bit more urgent than Harry thought, but he would make time. He would do his best.
I... Not him. Not draco. Draco never asked Harry to leave him. Jashua did and Draco was afraid of him.
To his surprise, Draco's face was expressionless and he said nothing. For a moment he wondered if the blonde had even heard him. Then, he decided there was only one way to find out. Holding his breath, Harry started to ask.
That's how Harry justified the second decision he wasn't really proud of. That's when he cast another wordless, wandless spell at his broken ex-lover, allowing Harry to hear his thoughts and feel his emotions, because he simply couldn't read his Draco anymore. His draco had been destroyed.
Harry hadn't seen that coming. Sure, the blonde had been very reluctant to share so far, but him staying so silent while his thoughts ate away at him was more than Harry could stand for.
He knew it was low. Draco had shared and Harry was using his worries to get him to eat more, but Harry didn't care. Perhaps part of his negative mood was lack of food? Maybe? Hopefully?
"N-no qu-questions." the blonde stuttered out and Harry's heart sank lower. Draco simply couldn't go back to that man. He recalled Draco's question about whether Harry could handle the friendship and, only then did he know, the answer was a definite no. But he couldn't tell draco that. Not yet. He would need to convince him to stay later, but there were more pressing matters to be dealt with at the moment.
"Harry, if I don't get that potion, I am going to kill myself. There's no other way." he said with a steady voice, as if talking about the weather. "if you force me to stay here, I promise the moment I am out of your sight, I'll do it. I swear it. And it will have to work this time. It needs to."
" I would NEVER send something like that!" he shouted and Draco flinched, then shook his head and began to sob harder.
“So, if there is no problem with...physical arousal, just with being attracted enough to my partner for the physical arousal to happen, this potion should work, right?” The brunette whispered, looking down at the ground in shame and shifting from one foot to another.
His thoughts were all over the place. He tried to remember everything he wrote in that blasted notebook, carefully laying out perfect lies to cover every topic. But, he had been writing in it since he was eight and he couldn't remember all the secrets the journal held, only the major ones. He decided that, if the worst does happen, he'll tell his father that the journal isn't even his.
The tactic worked and Harry blushed then started stammering awkward thank yous, not knowing what else to say.
The blonde almost jumped upon hearing Harry’s voice, before calming down a bit and answering the brunette.
Harry got up, ignoring the whispers of the audience and the glances people were throwing him. He turned towards the officiate.
" we..." he whispered, not even realizing he had spoken. Draco suddenly jumped as of he had forgotten Harry was there altogether.
Harry sighed, leaned against the wall, then sunk down to the ground and pulled his knees up to his chest. At that time, he felt a pang at the back of his head, telling him Draco had been hurt, but not badly hurt, not enough to die. As much as he wanted to, he couldn't stomp over and take the blonde back. He was again without hope and didn't have any sense of direction in regards to what to do.
“Fine,” Harry said, then grabbed the officiates’s arm and apparated them to his house, Grimmauld Place, which Ginny absolutely refused to move into. Their house was closer to the burrow, which Harry didn’t really mind.
Draco looked so frightened, so small, so panicked, that Harry knew he had to tell him the truth. The blonde couldn't get away without a wand, so Harry could just cast a locking charm on the bathroom if needed and get Pomfrey to collect Draco from there. An image of doctors having to drag Draco out of the room forcefully and him withering and panicking, trying to get away from them before inevitably collapsing in their hold, assaulted Harry's mind and he had to bite back a sob at the thought of doing this to his angel, but a frightened, upset Draco was better than a dead Draco.
“No. That won’t work, either,” Harry murmured to himself, looking at the ground. Hermione’s loud words snapped him out of his thoughts.
The blonde’s eyes started to tear up as soon as the third person he came up to told him he didn’t know. It was hopeless. The place was charmed to repel muggles. None of them would know where it was. Draco wanted to go home, but he didn’t want to just sit there and wait. He could be waiting forever for news. He felt so helpless as he let his tears fall to the ground next to his shoes, wondering if this is what it would feel like if he stayed after the birth. Had the twins caught a magical disease and he’d needed to get them to St. Mungo’s, he would’ve failed. That’s all he ever does. Fail. Fail. Fail. No matter how many steps he could take out of the house, whether he could talk to others or not, Draco wasn’t fit to be a parent, a friend, or even a functioning member of society.
Older draco wished that Harry hadn't shown him this memory. It was one of the actions he had most regretted, but he understood why Harry did. The only feelings radiating off Harry were sadness, desperation, love, hopelessness, and concern.
Harry arrived late to the alley. He had been spending the entire weekend bent over the books trying to figure out what to do with the situation. According to the hospital records, all treatment options listed in the book didn't work with Draco at all. Harry thought it made sense that therapy wouldn't work. If draco had started speaking about the Wizarding world they would've kept him there forever. Harry's eyes darkened at the thought. That place was horrid. Harry imagined spending one more minute in that place would've made him go mad. They had kept hid Draco there for months while Harry was crying over the unanswered letters thinking draco hated him.
"I'll eat later, Draco. I am not really in the mood now." Harry told him with what he hoped was a soothing voice.
Draco stood in Jashua's house, in the middle of the living room, staring at the wall, thinking about how he never wanted harry to see him like this, never wanted to hide his feelings around him again. Harry was the one person Draco told everything to for such a long time. He always saw right through Draco anyway, so there was no point in trying to hide.
understand. The brunette simply grabbed his wand, sent his friend an apologetic look, and apparated out of the house, already thinking up ways to apologize to the red-head when he next sees him. He wound up in a muggle bar, not wanting to go anywhere where he might be recognized as ‘the great Harry Potter’, and started downing shots.
"Here is what we'll do." Harry started, hoping his technique would work, "You said you wanted me to be happy today, right? Well, let's make this the perfect day. We'll both put ideas in a jar and draw randomly until the end of the day. Doesn't that sound fun?"
Harry nodded quickly, frantic to get the blonde out of there and into the warmth of Grimmauld Place with Scruffie and Kreacher, since he and draco get along for some reason, and everything they have worked so hard to regain. Harry could see his Draco coming back to life. He couldn't lose him now, not for any kinds of answers. Harry could wait. He'd waited three years before that, afterall. He could wait a couple of days.
"Jashua isn't very nice." he whispers. It's almost inaudible. Almost. Harry has to suppress a grin at the fact that draco is finally sharing! Without Harry having to access that horrible, dark, twisted place that is draco's mind.
With a sigh, Harry argued no further, turned on his heel, pulled out the boxes of chocolates he asked Kreacher for, then sat down next to draco and put the boxes in between the two of them, opening Draco's favorite and taking out the long biscuit one that they always used to split in Hogwarts when Draco's mom sent boxes over.
"Sorry. It's just the last time I said something even close to 'muggles should be treated as humans' father used the cane and my knee popped right out. Not to mention how he would react to the other things. I can't-"
Only that statement could've snapped Draco out of his thoughts about harry's dishonesty. He had started to shake his head wildly at the thought of hurting Jashua who had been nothing but honest with him since he told Draco he knew who he was and didn't want to scare him off by telling him so soon after an attempt.
"I am a lot to deal with..." Draco continued, ignoring Harry's words and looking at the floor once again.
The blonde was a complete mess. Hair patches torn out and quite visible, a black eye, a jagged scar down his jaw, a clear limp, and blood all over his damn clothes and a box.
Draco nodded slowly, then started to uncurl himself, only to stop when he heard Harry's loud gasp, and resume his position in a ball.
Draco finished reading the entries from fourth and third year, then skipped over the anxious ones of fifth year and found blank pages afterward. Draco wrote nothing past the summer before sixth year. That was strange. He always used to write before bed. But, he was especially tired that year. Then it hit him.
"I am sure I don't know what you mean." he said calmly, then tried again to leave the aisle, only to be held back by harry's hand tightening around his arm. He winced, but covered it with a cough. Harry didn't miss a thing.
"yes." he cries, his jaw still sore from yesterday's punch. At least it was glamoured thanks to Jashua.
Before Harry could approach him, Pomfrey returned and tried to wake him with a spell. The blonde's body twitched and the witch sighed, looking defeated. Just then, the older Malfoy entered the wing and Harry had to bite his tongue so he wouldn't start screaming at Draco's father for doing this to his son.
Harry tried his best to look interested in some books in front of him, glancing at Draco through the corner of his eye. The blonde didn't beam at the books and start demanding that the employees educate themselves better on proper literature. Neither did he even glance at the classics section, which Harry knew was Draco's favorite. Instead, he started to rearrange the books that were out of place and crossed his arms on front of his chest as he looked at the shelves and deemed them fixed, then he turned and sat on the reading couch in the middle of the room, waiting, presumably, for Harry.
Harry's eyes shot to the two empty vials on the kitchen counter. One was a severe sedation potion and the other....
Draco, determined, finally wiped around and looked Harry in the eyes, willing him to understand the seriousness of the situation.
Draco realized Harry had been asking him to stop for minutes, but his body was still responding. There was still hope. So, Draco swallowed Harry's cock like his life depended on it, willing Harry to just come already. But he didn't. Instead, Draco felt himself being shoved violently to the foot of the bed, as far away from Harry as possible and heard Harry shouting in a voice that didn't even seem like it belonged to the brunette. Draco couldn't even recognize it but he knew it couldn't be anything good.
Pure and utter dread and hatred filled Harry as the potion's effects seemed to wear off with the blonde's consciousness. He looked... Terrible. His eyes had bags underneath them that looked to have been permanent. His robes hanging off of him held up solely by his shoulders. His trousers only held up by a very tight belt that Harry was sure Draco had somehow fixed so it would encompass his small hips. Harry was right. This had been a terrible idea and his Draco looked dead within his arms.
Draco blushed and smiled, looking at the floor for entirely different reasons. Harry finally did it!
"I really miss your cooking and baking." he said with a certain longing in his voice, "I remember that your cookies used to make me feel better no matter how bad of a day I would have. I wish I had them during the last six weeks. And the three years before that when I half thought you were dead."
But Malfoy had apparently gone to Ron, panicked, claiming that Harry never came back to work. So when the red-head had apparated into their shared house and found Harry crying into a pillow on the couch, the brunette could only groan and mentally slap himself for having his breakdown in his own room so he could be left alone.
Draco calmly walked to the store and started to plead with the mannequin in the shop’s window. Then, he was finally given permission to enter, and walked into the reception of St. Mungo’s only to realize he had no idea how to get to Harry.
He had meant it to be hurtful, to push Harry away, but all he felt from Harry was a sudden sense of understanding.
For the first time in his life, Harry thanked every God and everything on the planet that the court had stripped Draco of his magic. He couldn't even imagine what it would be like to see his magic go. Frightening, no doubt. And not knowing when or if it would return...Ron's story and sentiments made a lot of sense, but, thankfully, Draco wasn't like that."
"I thought you were going to throw it away." he says quietly, "I didn't know you were still hungry."
"Y-you can d-drop the act, M-Malfoy. I know you don’t care about me!" Harry screamed, both his hands clenched at his sides, then looked at the ground and sniffled.
The brunette was determined. Something had to be done. He had to take back his rejection. He had to do something. Harry wouldn't leave the blonde to suffer in silence, not again.
t was magical, having him back, even if he was drugged out of his mind. If Harry closes his eyes for a few seconds and cuddles against the blonde, he can almost pretend that everything was the same, that Draco never broke up with him after bathroom incident, that he told him about Voldemort's tasks and threats and Harry had done everything in his power to protect Draco. Then, nothing would've been taken and they would've still been together and Draco wouldn't have two harsh heartbreaking lines down his arms reminding Harry of his failure to protect, of his failure to help Draco.
"Yeah.." he started, "Everyone I met during these two years pressured me to just be normal. It's clear you're not comfortable with me like this, but you let me be. I really appreciate that."
He got up, not wanting to smother Draco but being unable to sit still and wait. It was about 9 pm and neither had had breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Suddenly, Harry had an excuse to be near the blonde. Food!
Afterward, Harry didn't know what to think or how to feel. Ron had abandoned him, just like eleven year-old Draco had once warned Harry, and Harry felt like he was breaking down. Everything was too much and he needed to see Draco so the blonde could make it all better. He had wandered into the bathroom and waited, leaning against the walls, far away from the sinks. Draco showed up seconds later and he looked infuriated but sad.
“I asked for the day off,” he said casually, like any other person in his position would do the same. Draco’s heart swelled at the statement. He felt the back of his eyes burn, but willed himself not to cry.
"H-harry?" he asked quietly, but Harry had heard him and turned around, almost hopeful for something, and not knowing what.
“Harry, please,” he said quietly, his eyes darting to a place behind the brunette’s head then back to Harry again.
"What do you want for a meal?" Harry asked, standing up and already making his way to the kitchen, but stopped abruptly when hearing no response. He turned around to find Draco sitting in the same position and looking at the floor. He wished he could give Draco some truth serum as well and start his own line of questioning, but he still had the third day for that. At least he had earned the blonde's trust.
"what did I do, Draco?" Harry cried out, trying to get Draco to talk to him. "I don't understand why you're so upset."
Draco waited another minute in silence before sighing and making an attempt to walk out of the bathroom but stumbling slightly. Harry had had enough. He wasn't going to let Draco leave anyway, but having to catch him only made him realize the graveness of the situation.
"That would work." draco said with a faint smile. Harry exhaled in relief, but one more thing was knawing at his insides.
"oohhh dracoooo. You shouldn't scare me like that!" exclaimed the ghost, then saw the panicked look on her friend's face and rushed over to him. "What's wrong?"
Harry got up and cast an alohomora on the lock, which clicked open instantly. He pushed open the door to find his draco curled up in a ball laying on his side on the cold tile floor in the middle of the bathroom.
“No!” Harry said instantly, then more calmly “No. I don’t want to. This doesn’t bother me, Draco, honest. Or, it does, but not for the reasons you’re thinking. I-I just hate the fact that you’re in pain. I just want you to get better, alright? It’s not about my comfor-”
Harry knew he wouldn't be able to sleep, not after what he just saw. He was sure Draco was distressed. Who wouldn't be after having to relive it? He instantly felt guilty about forgetting the spell and, more, about casting all the other spells on Draco without his permission. How was he any better than Jashua?
Suddenly, Harry understood. At least, he hoped he had. The last thing he wanted was to make things worse.
At the sound of the door lock being clicked open so draco and Harry could get to the apparition, the brunette couldn't take it anymore. He didn't know how it happened or why, but, suddenly, Harry was on his knees, clutching Draco's waist roughly, sobbing violently into his right thigh as the blonde looked down at him in horror.
Harry instantly looked down at himself, not seeing anything alarming or out of order, he shot a confused look at Ron, who rolled his eyes and immediately conjured a mirror.
He sat down on the couch next to the blonde, who instantly looked up at him and forced a smile. Harry swallowed.
Harry had so far done everything on the list but the second and he didn't think it would be a good idea, considering the blonde shared a house with that horrid man. None of the things seemed to help so far. The seventh one, which he refused to even acknowledge, asked Harry to be patient, but how could he be patient when he was watching his Draco slip through the cracks of life? How was that even possible. No. The books were useless. The doctors were useless. Even Ron was making everything worse, walking on eggshells around Harry at work as if he would break at any moment. The brunette had even taken several separate cases to avoid his best friend. This was up to Harry and Harry alone and he would help Draco if it's the last thing he did.
The bitterness in Ron's voice at the last three words told Harry he was crossing some sort of line into rage territory. He faked a laugh to fill in the awkward silence, then murmured "right. Was just wondering" and went back to the notebook. The next page was tear-stained and Harry's suspicions were immediately confirmed.
Harry's heart clenched. Everything suddenly started to make sense. The beliefs. The writer's friends. The fact that Ron never mentioned him. The owner of the journal was Malfoy. He couldn't stop reading. He had to know Malfoy's perspective, how deep Harry had hurt him.
"It's alright. I like it when you're honest. I thought Jashua was honest for so long... It doesn't make sense."
Harry didn't have a moment to think about it. All he knew was that the universe had given him a second chance and he couldn't blow it again, so he cast the locator spell wordlessly and wandlessly with only one thought in mind.
"I am not trying to bum you out, Harry, but that ward and those people were just... I don't want you to get too attached. Bill was crushed. I don't want anything bad happening to you. You've seen enough death as it is."
Harry stood there gaping at Draco like he's lost his mind. This was his chance. He could ask everything he wanted to know, but then Draco would feel betrayed and he might even not want to stay, or worse, do something to himself like he's been threatening to do all night.
And, there he was, a week later, approaching the same neighborhood. Draco had to suppress a growl. His Harry was too stubborn for his own good.
Draco didn't even realize he was trying to shake his head, that he was shouting at Jashua, calling him a liar, telling him Draco wasn't his, that he was screaming and attempting to kick the larger man. Only when the lights came on and he caught sight of Harry's lifeless eyes and his motionless body sprawled across the balcony with his limbs twisted in unnatural angles, did he stop for a second, a loud scream threatening to erupt from his throat. It never got to. Jashua seized the opportunity to shut him up with a potion. Draco didn't recognize it, but that was a bad sign. He could almost taste it on his tongue. A distant memory. A potion he wasn't aware he injected. The fertility potion....
He knew he shouldn't, but he wrote draco a letter anyways, too deeply hurt and betrayed to feel bad about breaking his promise. Draco had broken his as well, right? With a frustrated grunt, he tied it to the owls leg and sent it off, not that it made him feel any better. He layed awake at night cuddling a pensieve, living through every single moment in that market again, hoping against hope that he would be given some clue as to why Draco was treating him so horribly. Only one answer came to mind as he left for work the next day, the same three words Draco had written him every month for the past two years:
Draco insisted on going to a muggle bookstore, not wanting to risk being seen and sent to Azkaban. Harry quickly agreed and they apparted to a bookstore that Harry knew was far from Draco's house. He didn't want to risk Jashua seeing them. He didn't know want he would do if he saw the large man and wouldn't be held accountable for destroying him.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by the screams that tore through Draco's throat. There was tears constantly flowing down his cheek and he was utter loud piercing cries, but Jashua didn't stop pounding into him. Only then did Harry remember that he didn't have permission to see this and that he was powerless to stop it, that all he could do was stand by, listen, and watch as his sobbing ex-lover got pregnant against his will.
Draco finally discovered the reason behind the brunette’s absence when Harry’s owl brought ‘the Daily Prophet’ into the house. The blonde didn’t usually read the magazine, since they were only interested in publishing absolute rubbish in there, but that day, he needed a distraction.
"Don't do that!" Harry snapped and felt instantly guilty when Draco flinched. His tone didn't change, though. "Don't act like you don't know what I am talking about, you manipulative bastard! How could you do that to me? A threat to your life is the one thing I could never stand and you know it. You're no better than some dementor, sucking happy memories out of people and using their fears against them. Let me help you out if you're so adamant on pushing me away! You're an addict and I am not letting you go out there until you agree to go to rehab. And like it or not, there's nothing you can do about it."
"Killed by an angel" Harry continued to whisper, unable to stop the words from leaving his lips. Draco's overreaction, his embrace, the kiss, everything about the situation was so... Like Draco. Like his old Draco. "My Draco, my angel, back to me, finally. I missed you."
When Pomfrey came in, Harry gave her no attention at all until he heard her say the words he was so desperate for.
Something darkened in Malfoy’s grey eyes as they flicked over to where the camera was then back to Harry’s face. The blonde sighed and started speaking slowly.
"I-I w-wanted t-to s-see you, Harry. I-I swear it. Y-you have to b-believe me. Th-the p-prophet ph-photos of y-you. E-everyone th-thought y-you were h-happy, but I-I knew you w-were sad. Then, y-you were f-finally h-happy w-when y-you saw m-me for s-some r-reason and I-I thought m-maybe I was w-wrong, th-that y-you s-still c-cared a-about m-me even though I-I w-was w-worthless. B-but he-he was upset that you were there and he slipped me ver-vertiserum and I-I couldn't n-not t-tell him! I tried s-so hard, but I-I am W-weak and I-I c-couldn't and th-then he g-gave me th-the other p-potions and then h-he.. He.. I-I c-couldn't w-walk, b-but I-I w-would've c-crawled t-there, Harry. A-anything to s-see you h-happy again. I-I th-thought w-would N-never s-see y-you again a-at all and I h-had to get to y-you bef-before you left f-forever, b-but th-then your l-letter c-came and I-I should've known it wasn't from y-you. I should've, but I w-was exhausted and s-so s-sad t-that y-you ch-changed your mind s-so I started t-to cry. H-he hates I-it when I c-cry so h-he beat m-me up and l-locked the doors and l-left me w-with my l-legs broken. I-it w-was l-like m-my soul b-broke t-too. I s-still w-would've f-found a w-way to c-come I-if I h-had k-known y-you still w-wanted me to."
"Harry, you-you can't be seriously considering competing!" Draco shrieked out, taking Harry's hands back in his and looking into his eyes pleadingly.
Harry never stopped going to the alley, even when he was almost certain Draco wouldn't show up. It was the only constant. It was the only place his Draco went to when he needed Harry. Harry couldn't fathom the thought that the blonde might show up needing him, but leave if Harry isn't there.
“It won’t. I can do this. I’m sure it won’t be this draining after the twins are born,” the blonde said firmly, keeping his eyes on his food and away from Harry’s pleading ones. He wouldn't let the brunette talk him out of this. He needed a reason to leave the house every day, or else he’d never step foot outside.
Draco put his head in his hands and exhaled shakily, but Harry didn't even think about comforting the blonde. No. He was focused on that one word more than anything else.
"Yes, that was unpleasant and I've since then spoken to him about it. It did help with the pain from the lack of preparation, though."
Humiliation and Shane suddenly flowed through Harry and he was very tempted to take the spell off but he didn't. He had to know.
The blonde looked taken back by the suggestion. Harry knew why. The brunette would have never suggested such a thing if he couldn't hear Draco's thoughts.
He felt cold, hopeless, depressed, and empty, but he didn't stop the spell. How could he? Draco has been living like this for years and Harry couldn't take a few measly hours? He was too weak and draco needed him to be strong right now and fight this. Maybe the spell could help him figure something out in a twisted sense. Listen to the thoughts to find out what can destroy them. Keep the enemies closer.
"And didn't you think I deserved more of than explanation than 'leave me alone'?" he snapped. For once, Draco didn't flinch or draw back. He blinked, then stared at harry open-mouthed, confusion clouding his dull gray eyes.
"I am NOT hiding. I am... Waiting for a friend." draco told him, looking away and blushing more at the use of his first name by his nemisis.
Please don't hate Harry too much. Just. Put yourself in his shoes, yeah? This is the third time he's almost lost Draco and this time Draco was completely aware of Harry's feelings and didn't care enough to take care of himself, unlike other times when he just thought Harry hated him. (That's Harry's pov, of course.) this attitude and the scene is what will start Draco's recovery, so you guys can look forward to that, even if it will be a bit angsty at first.
"W-what do you need?" Harry asks, trying to bite back a sob at seeing his perfect Draco so broken and sad.
"You aren't even listening to me now, Harry. Don't you see! I told you it doesn't matter what you think. I will believe that I am a burden regardless. I will not be made to feel that way again. I am sure you don't like me anymore. My presence is causing you some sort of pain, even if you deny it."
“Harry, I would never lie to you, ever. I-” Draco started, putting a lot of effort into not touching the sad brunette at all. His heart was breaking with every second that passed without him making his mate feel better.
“Isn’t that the place you’re asking for?” he asked, then gestured at a near, dark alley that held the store. Draco could have kissed him!
"what if he doesn't mean it?" he had once asked after receiving yet another of harry's fateful letters. "he really did love me in school. Would you let me arrange to meet him? With you there, of course."
"umm...Are you sure?" he asked in disbelief. Harry was sure the look on his face was comical, but Draco was frowning and looking him up and down.
Draco had to bite his lips after he spoke. He felt a need to just offer to make Harry something, anything that would take the brunette's pain away. Although Harry always looked satisfied when eating Draco's food, the blonde was certain that he was the happier one about it. Seeing Harry that happy just made him feel like nothing else in the world mattered.
"I am so sorry." he wailed, approaching draco cautiously. "I am sorry for what I did to you for everything that happened in that bathroom."
“Well, they’re not going to wait for me. The whole world won’t wait for me to be able to be bloody functional! They’re due in three months, Harry and they’re going to need someone to take care of them, not- not some child who needs you to hold his hand just so he could muster enough courage to walk out of the house.”
“Weasley, I know you’re with Potter, but the wards of St. Mungo’s just detected that someone with the dark mark has entered. I need you to investigate and bring that person in, whoever it is.”
The scene shifted, and suddenly, he was seeing himself mortified after having kissed a crying Harry at the beginning of fourth year, after his so-called best friend abandoned him, and Harry looking at the blonde, astonished.
"There's something else you can do." he whispers as he looks up at Harry, who also has tears in his eyes for some reason. But before he can continue, he is interrupted by Harry's sobbing.
“I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” he mumbled and prayed to Merlin that his friend would leave it alone.
"Going to make breakfast." Draco told him slowly like it was the most normal thing in the world for him to make Harry food while crying his eyes out.
The brunettes eyes were wide and pleading and all anger seemed to have left him entirely. His sudden change of mood made Draco not notice his suspiciously on-point words.
"I missed you so much." Harry breathed out without thinking it through. Draco blushed furiously and Harry had to stomp down that same jittery feeling in his chest that he got whenever he thought of Draco. He got up to hug Draco but the blonde moved away, looking all red and furious, yet somehow small, as a child would before they stomp their feet.
“Is everything alright?” He heard the brunette ask. Draco’s head snapped up and he looked around. They were in the alley. Harry had already apparated them to the muggle world and Draco hadn’t even noticed it. The blonde wanted to kick himself for not paying attention to Harry. The veela business would have to wait. He had an amazing second date to get to.
"I simply didn't know I was hungry until you left." he grits out, his voice void of any feelings and considerably louder than the hushed noises he has been communicating through lately. "You have a bloody house-elf, do you not? You could ask him for more, then, instead of crying about a few missing spoons of rice."
"you can't heal me, Harry. Not from this. Not this time." he had whispered, looking at his left forearm and sniffling. Harry followed his gaze and moved to yank back the sleeve only to be held against the walls with a wand to his throat.
"I won't buy you anything! Never. I won't do anything you don't want to do. And I definitely won't come on to you. It's your life, Draco. You should have full control of it."
"You said you were fine, that your summer was fine, that you were happy. You look like you were thrown to the wolves, Harry."
“But I am not angry with you!” Harry said frantically. Had he not been holding the blonde’s hands, he would’ve shook the blonde to try to get some sense into him. Why would he think that Harry was mad? When did the brunette ever insinuate that?!
He didn't ask draco, only watched as his eyes glazed over and became absorbed in the memories Harry was so concentrated on showing him.
Harry stared at Malfoy for a while, mouth agape, unable to decipher if what the blonde was saying was true or not.
“If that is all, I need to take my leave right now,” the officiate said, sounding professional again. Harry nodded and murmured, “Thank you.”
“Of course I would!” he said cheerfully when he realized he hadn’t answered the brunette yet. He then jumped off his chair, took off his Auror robes, and threw them on his desk. He blushed deeply when he felt Harry interlocking his left arm with Draco’s right one.
"but could you promise me not to believe a word Jashua says about me? The guy doesn't even know me and I am certain he is filling your head with all kinds of lies."
2) I know Harry is being very emotional and he's crying too much. He isn't normally like this, but I imagine this is how one would react when they have never had depression and were suddenly assaulted with it all at once. Draco's feelings and thoughts are too overwhelming and Harry feels completely useless and guilty at not knowing how to help. I guess this is the kind of chapter that shows how any relationship is affected when one person becomes depressed and even more so here because Harry can literally feel what's happening to draco and can't do anything about it.
"Draco, wha-" Harry started, but stopped upon Draco shooting him a pleading look. Harry cleared his throat and asked "What could I do to help."
Only then did Harry hear quiet sobs from regulus's old room. He checked to find that there was no one in sight, so he bit his cheek and layed down on his stomach next to the bed, only to see a small bundle at end. Draco was huddled into a ball in the corner, knees drawn to his chest and crying his eyes out, clutching something for dear life.
Hurriedly, Harry crumpled the papers and vanished them, determined to make this day perfect and convince Draco to stay.
The blonde's words didn't hurt Harry, not in the way Draco intended. Harry knew his Draco only turned to insults when he felt completely vulnerable and hopeless. But he hadn't resorted to it with Harry since that day in the bathroom and the realization of what a major stepback had occured dawned on Harry, making him since. He looked away, unable to meet the blonde's eyes.
“If that were true, you wouldn’t be in pain at all,” Harry joked, then groaned when Draco recoiled again. He closed his eyes, sighed, and was just about to let go of Draco’s hands and demand that they go to a healer. The blonde’s next words stopped him in his tracks.
"Would he be upset if you take this home?" the brunette asked gently, gesturing to the plate and coffee cup, which were now in take away boxes.
Draco clamped his lips shut tightly, determined not to get a single drop of that potion into his system. He tried to breathe out of his nose and calm himself down to think of something, anything he could say that would get Jashua to let him go for the day. His search came up completely blank and he started to panic even more at the idea of all his greatest fears coming true at once.
"It's negative." he whispered, barely able to contain the cheerful tone at the thought of Draco being able to get away from Jashua, which just warrants the question. Just what exactly was going on there?
"Harry, you can tell me the truth. Do you have some kind of fatal muggle disease that's taken over your appetite?" he choked out, his horribly sad, wet eyes never leaving Harry's. Harry got so lost in them, he forgot to answer the question entirely and the blonde seemed to take that as confirmation as he tried and failed to hide the horrified look in his eyes.
He nodded slowly and Harry grabbed onto him, forgetting the bruises he had noticed. By the time they arrive  at Grimmauld Place, the blonde was screaming loudly, pericing Harry's ears. Harry lets him ago after a few seconds, when he suddenly remembered that Draco was hurt. It took him a while to calm down, and Harry spent it telling him that everything would be alright, even though he had no bloody idea if that was  true. It had to be, though.
Draco was ready to apologize for being so moody that morning. Surely, he must’ve scared Harry off. No one took that long to borrow a pen. The blonde had a perfect view of Ron’s office from his chair, but the brunette had shut the door.
"could you.. Umm...cast this spell on me?" he asked hesitantly, pushing a small crumpled paper to Harry with a spell written across it in handwriting that looks like catscratch.
"Draco, please. I don't want you to be in pain.". Harry urged, not taking no for an answer. Draco mumbled something inaudible.
I would like to thank nightskywithrainbows (or JJ) for their amazing work and help beta(ing) this chapter and the ones after that. You really motivate me to write better and more. Thank you so much!
Harry glared at his best friend, even though Ron was fast asleep. Did he know how much his rejection had hurt this person? Did he even care? Why was everyone treating this sweet child like that? Surely, he couldn't be that horrible? He hadn't even done anything wrong!
The worst were the isolation rooms. Harry saw a patient screaming as the doctors dragged her through the hallway telling her to calm down and then locked her inside while she banged on the door to be let out. The room had no windows. It was a prison, Harry decided. A new patient complained about her dog, and how nobody would feed him while she was there. She was crying and begging the nurses to let her call someone, anyone, so the dog, scruffie, wouldn't die while she was in the ward. The nurses ademantly refused. Harry's heart broke. He listened in while she told them her address, determined to help that poor creature. As he made his way to the door, he saw another horrible sight: the nurses holding a screeching patient down, strapping him to the bed and forcibly injecting him with something that made him sleep. They then proceeded to undress him and made notes of his self-harm scars, then dressed him once more in plain, uncomfortable patient clothing, and left the room, locking the door behind them. Harry bolted from the ward, not being able to stay there for a second longer.
"Because I wouldn't agree if I didn't know about your feelings and, after today, I can't know about them."
The slight catch in Harry's voice at the end of his rant was the only thing that could've made Draco look up. He didn't even know he was speaking until Harry shot him a confused look.
“Bloody great, Draco. You’ve managed to piss off the nicest guy in history. This is a new record,” the blonde murmured to himself, falling back onto the bed and looking up at the ceiling. He wanted to apologize, but his heart was still racing from their argument, from Harry’s words. They both needed to calm down before seeing each other again. The blonde waited for an hour, mindlessly creating more bubbles with Harry’s wand and popping them with his fingers.
Harry trailed off upon seeing the blind panic running through the blonde's eyes. Once again, he didn't understand any of it.
There it was. That sad smile again. Harry was surprised that the awful emotions draco felt when giving it were the same as what Harry felt whenever he saw it.
Instantly, Harry cast a windgardian leviosa on a box of tissues and was intended on levitating it to Draco, who shrunk back at the thought of anything entering his safe space.
Sorry for the delay! I almost got locked out of my google account, in which I save all my stories. Thank god I recovered the password. I'll be posting the final two chapters today. Thank you all for reading this story. I hope you've enjoyed it!
“I’ll go look. If I don’t find them, whoever they are, within ten minutes, I’ll send a patronus back to Robards telling him to bring over a team.” the red-head said firmly, giving the blonde a look. Draco sighed in relief. Ron was giving him ten minutes with the brunette. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing.
The whole event couldn't have lasted more than a few seconds, but the memory was instilled in Harry and, upon remembering how Draco looked, Harry had the horrible thought that the blonde, indeed, would die today, away from Harry and it would be Harry's fault for not forcing his hand.
"Did you see my father, Harry? Oh it was wonderful! He was so proud of me. He left me a letter in the hospital wing-" Draco stopped, letter in hand, the other hand gesturing towards it. He had finally noticed how pissed Harry was.
"It's not my choice. I've been chosen. I can't get out of it!" Harry told him frantically, pulling at his hair.
He tried to will himself to stop crying and be fine just so draco's thoughts would stop, until it occured to him that that's exactly what Draco has been doing as well. He's trying to be normal so Harry won't hate him apparently. But Harry could never hate him. Even when his wand was pointed at Dumbledore, he still loved draco and knew there had to be an explanation for that.
It together forever, but, finally, he took another shaking breathe and, his entire body trembling, he continued. "I m-meant what I s-said. Y-you... You have control. I-I won't stop you from leaving or from choosing to lose those memories even if I don't support it. It's w-entirely upto y-you. If you agree to the s-spell, I'll cast it. I-if you want to buy the potion, I'll give you the money and come with you. I-if y-you w-want me to ob-obliviate you, I'll do it."
“So, you’ll report them?” Ron asked enthusiastically. Harry finally looked up. His friend was already deep in thought, presumably coming up with plans to investigate where the money went and prove that it wasn’t spent on Harry in court.
But as the days passed, and the blonde remained unconscious, Harry's resolve faltered. He would sneak into the wing every chance he could, not wanting Draco to be alone when he wakes up. He would whisper things into Draco's ear, careful not to make his presence known under the cloak. Draco didn't show any signs of improvement.
He didn't have time to dwindle on the thoughts, though, because Jashua immediately jumped on him, tackling him to the floor on his stomach and whispering in his ear.
Harry couldn't believe it. The stupid doctors had actually made his Draco worse. That didn't even seem possible! Harry couldn't stop himself. He had to see what it was like, what they put Draco through. He snuck into the ward that was listed as Draco's. Ron's description seemed almost positive compared to what he saw.
"H-harry?" the blonde asked when he saw Harry give no sign of having heard the request. "Are-are you alright? Are you hurt?"
The unrealistic idea that Draco was now completely fine, though, disappeared in the morning when the blonde started to shake with Harry on top of him. After Draco rolled them over and took charge, Harry had just attributed the shaking to pleasure, but soon it became apparent that something was wrong. Draco's tears were falling onto Harry as the blonde continued to suck him off, determined that Harry finish even though he, himself, seemed miserable, and not stopping even when Harry asked him to.
“It’s kind of complicated, Harry,” the blonde said, looking down at his plate. He hadn’t looked Harry in the eye since after their ‘date.’ He continued, “Do we have to talk about it right now?”
“It should work, then.” Harry murmured to himself, not realizing what his words implied until he had said them. He looked up and saw that the blonde had a look of sadness on his face.
Draco's thoughts stopped as he encountered the very last page of the journal, which had more of Harry's catscratch writing.
"Alright, how about this?" Harry asked, conjuring a vial of vertiserum and downing it without thinking it through. He could fight the effects anyways but he hoped he wouldn't need to. "Ask me anything."
The elf popped into the room, eyed Scruffie with distaste, then listened intently as Draco listed all of Harry's favorite dishes, and vanished, only to come back with all of them and set them in front of the two men and Scruffie, who panted harshly at the smell of the food.
There. He hadn't lied exactly and had achieved his desired effects. Draco beamed at the dog and had that look on his face that he used to have whenever coming across one of Hagrid's creatures. Though he used to deny it, Harry knew Draco loved any and all creatures that weren't human and Harry couldn't say he blamed him. Harry, himself, wasn't a big fan of humans, muggle or magical, at the moment.
“Ginny…” he yelled out after her, but before he could take a single step down the aisle, Ron’s fist collided with his cheek so roughly, it caused him to collapse on the floor entirely. Luckily, his glasses were charmed to stay on his face no matter what, so he could glare directly at his so-called best friend, who said nothing to him before joining his wife in an attempt to comfort his baby sister.
Moving from his kneeling position to a standing one, Harry slowly reached for his wand to cast locking charms on the doors and floo, only to have the blonde cry and whisper pleadingly.
"I am going to throw away anything you don't eat, just to be clear. Maybe just to spite you. So, it's your choice really."
Harry was at loss as to what to say. So, he waits for Draco to speak, the ticking on the black family clock very loud in his ears, reminding him that every second that passes is another one in which Draco is in pain and he is not helping.
" No. I have nowhere to go." Harry said stubbornly and laughed at the furious look on draco's face, thinking he was even more adorable.
Harry regretted the question the instant Draco's smile vanished and he dropped his hand. He needed to know, though. Even if it pained him to see Draco upset again, he needed to know why Draco seemed to have completely forgotten about their wonderful time together and apparently hated Harry again.
Harry wanted to cry and older draco couldn't help the tears spreading down his cheeks at the scene. It was entirely different than he remembered. He remembered being pitied, humiliated, disgusted with himself, hurting Harry. But... This was different.
"Potter, you absolute imbecile!" Draco yelled, but his tone gave him away. He was suppressing a laugh. Then, Harry found himself buried in meat sauce with Scruffie rushing to lick it off. They continued the assault with the Entertained puppy running between them, wagging his tail, as they both laughed. By the time both the plates were empty and Scruffie was stuffed, Harry's stomach growled and he smiled up at Draco, expecting him to say yes immediately.
No. He could no longer be burden on anyone, especially Harry after the war. He knew that's what Harry wanted just by looking at him. He was yelling at Draco, but the blonde knew he was just trying to get him to stay with him. He couldn't have that. It was his time to go, so he could no longer be a burden, so he could truly and physically be nothing. So, with one last look at his eyes, Draco walked away, thinking he would never see them again.
Draco wasn't lying. The potion wasn't a drug. Draco wasn't an addict. This is how he truly is, how he feels, and Harry has no idea what to do to make it better.... Again.
Harry knew it wasn't true, that Draco simply had a disease he wasn't given treatment for. It still stung to hear the seriousness in the blonde's voice and for the first time, Harry truly thought about the answer to his question. Would Harry be able to remain by Draco's side, even if he was miserable and beaten, to support him going back to Jashua? To not be able to touch him or take him away? Would he be willing to watch his Draco walk into his own doom time after time again until Jashua inevitably kills him. The answer was a hesitant no. He didn't want to be around for that, but it would be worse if he knew what was happening to Draco yet left the blonde behind to fend for himself. It was an impossible decision!
"You moron! You self-centered, stupid, freak of a prat. Spawn of the devil, Draco malfoy!" older draco yelled at his younger version, only to have a hand grip his shoulder tightly and turn him around. Older harry was shaking his head at older draco, tears in his eyes and he was completely silent. Only after Draco felt hopelessness and a loss of the will to live did he understand. Harry was asking permission to reverse the spell and see the events from the blonde's perspective.
Draco immediately stiffened upon hearing Jashua's voice and words in his mind. He tried to continue his work, but he could feel Harry's hands on his shoulders, trying to push him away.
Second (SPOILER AND TRIGGER WARNING) : Draco comes from a pureblood, traditional background and he, in this story, is a very sensitive person who has been depressed for a long time. That causes him to blame himself for everything. In this chapter draco reveals that the potion is for an abortion and spends a lot of it hating himself for 'killing his baby'. This isn't my opinion of abortion, but eitherway if that would offend you, I suggest you skip to the summary at the end.
The blonde slowly turned around to face her as if just realizing what he had said, then sighed and slumped, feeling terrible.
"Because you keep putting yourself down and I care about you! How.. How do I make you feel like you're not a burden! I have to help!" Harry screamed and pulled at his hair.
" He killed you today.. " he heard the blonde murmur as he shifted and Harry caught the reflection of the light off the item he was holding. His heart stopped. The entire world seemed to stop for a minute.
He willed himself out of Draco's mind and came to in the bedroom hearing more of Draco's screams at having relived the memory.
Before he could think about it too long, Draco was suddenly yanked into one of the waiting rooms, only to realize it wasn’t a waiting room at all; it was Harry’s room. The brunette was there, unconscious on the bed, with a red-eyed Ron sitting next to him with a guilty look on his face, and Hermione standing next to Draco with her hand still on his arm, gazing at him with a sympathetic look.
"You finally know what I feel like, then." he joked, hitting Draco on the arm playfully. The blonde smiled, capturing Harry's hand as it brushed his arm. He leaned down and quickly pressed his lips against Harry's, willing his entire glamour to fall. He wanted to feel this. Even if it was only 0.01% of what he had felt when kissing Harry in Hogwarts, the brunette was making him feel again, finally and he was going to enjoy every second of it that he could.
He found Draco in the sitting room observing the vial that had had the abortion potion. A sickening thought went through Harry's mind.
"I've seen it done to people in my chambers and did nothing to intervene." the blonde said. Harry couldn't tell if he wasn't trying to get Harry to let him leave or seeking out Harry's comfort. Harry went with his gut.
Draco looked up to find Harry frowning at his still full plate. Harry's was empty. The blonde had fallen asleep, seduced by the warm and comfortable cushions of the booth and the safety of having Harry next to him.
Harry couldn't hear his own screaming pleas or how violently his hands were yanking his hair. He couldn't feel the tears running down his cheek or even the potion Pomfrey forced into his system.
“I did as you asked, Draco. Even though bastard Potter doesn’t deserve it.” the elf squeaked when he apparated into Draco’s room half an hour later, then muttered to himself, “Accusing you of such horrible crimes when you’ve been nothing but kind to him.”
Harry was jolted out of his thoughts by a horrible pain radiating off the back of his head. He instantly knew what it meant. His vision went red. Jashua had hurt his Draco. Badly. Harry needed to intervene. The spell alerted him to injuries that would cause permenant damage if not treated properly. But, of course, that ducking monster wouldn't heal Draco. He probably just left him there and Harry needed to know where.
He smiled sadly and left as Draco returned to his sitting room feeling more confused than he ever had before.
"W-why didn't y-you tell me?" he whispered a moment later, "Why d-did you just l-leave me like that?"
The blonde jumped back violently, causing multiple items on the shelf behind him to fall. He seemed to panic even more at that and looked around for the thousandth time.
Harry started to pull at his hair. He didn't know what else to do. Draco was lying to him. His draco had never lied to him. Or maybe he did have a substance abuse problem and just maybe that problem was behind all his horrible thoughts and feelings. All the addicts he had come across in investigations and such felt the same. Harry never thought he'd say this, but he really hoped draco was an addict and that he would be fixed after withdrawals.
"Don't look at me like that! You must know what I mean! You were mine to keep and to codle and protect and spend time with and laugh with and make love to and I was the same to you. I want to protect you from these awful thoughts that keep telling you I am lying and that you're a bad person. I would if you let me. I want you to be better so I can have you back, even if not romantically. I just wanted you to be here. It's what I've always wanted. And now that you are, you seem to be analyzing and distrusting of every single thing I do and say. You're making me crazy, Draco. You're making me doubt everything with your question. But I don't doubt my feelings and my intentions. I am sorry you misinterpreted them. Next question."
Harry knew Draco could tell that he was getting annoyed. How dare he question what Harry was so sure of? What was wrong with him? Was it that difficult to believe that Harry loved him? Suddenly, he realized that, for draco, it was.
People were rushing over. Harry didn't have time to think. He only knew things would somehow get way worse if the blonde was discovered.
"I am so sorry. I am sorry. How could I be so stupid. Obviously that guy spiked it. Oh wait until I see him again. I'll teach him to mess with... Illegal potions. I guess I can't but I'll teach him a lesson anyways. Oh God if something happened to you, I would never forgive myself. Not after all this time."
As the end of the game neared and Harry and Draco were flying side by side, chasing the snitch, Harry could tell Draco's resolve was wavering. The blonde was swaying on his broom and seemed about ready to collapse. But, he was, indeed, faster by all accounts. With a surge of what Harry could only describe as superhuman strength, Draco flew past him in an instant and his hand gently grasped the snitch, but as the announcement made itself known that Slytherin had won, the blonde promptly fell off his broom with a smile. Harry didn't think twice. He raced towards the falling blonde, cursing himself for letting this happen, and, before Draco hit the ground, grabbed him hurriedly, then slowed down enough to lower the both of them to the field.
Jashua took a deep breath, then looked his lover in the eye and said "of course not, darling, I love you and will always be honest with you, which is why I am telling you that I fear I might grow to feel that way if you don't get better soon."
Draco looked to the side to see his eleven year-old self, frowning down at him and mouthing 'you deserve this'.
The thought was a terrible one and Harry only knew he needed to get to Draco as quickly as possible. He ran up to the dorms, threw his invisibility cloak on and sprinted to the hospital wing, where Draco lay, alone and unconscious, under a heave of blankets.
Suddenly, it clicked. How thin he was, how poor he was, the colors on his arms, how shaky and emotional he's been everytime Harry has seen him. Draco was addicted to muggle drugs and was now exploring the magical versions.
"I could unpack it and you could eat it here. It's fine. I can wait. I want you to eat it." Harry told him with a wide smile on his face and a speck of hope in his beautiful, green eyes.
"You… you're laughing at me." he said in a small voice, then shrank back within himself. "You-you know how terrified I am over losing you and you're still laughing about it."
"After Jashua found you and took you into the ER after you... Did the doctors give you a name? A diagnosis? Anything to help you get better?"
They weren't much, but Harry knew these weren't things Draco wanted. They weren't things he could even do. Draco had written down all the activities that Harry liked in order to please Harry.
“Mr. Potter, if you’re having erectile dysfunction issues, these potions won’t help you. They only serve to increase your lust for the person closest in proximity to you until you’ve consummated. If there is an initial problem with physical arousal, increasing your attraction or psychological arousal won’t solve the issue.” Malfoy said in a completely professional tone, looking Harry in the eye.
“And ruin their childhood?! I- I want them to go to the park and make friends and go to nurseries. I want to be friends with the other mothers and have breakfast with them while we talk about how our babies kept us up all night. I w-want to have a job eventually so I am not burdening you. I want to be able to protect them from people who might bully or hurt them, but I can’t! Merlin, I can’t even think about doing any of that, about being around other people. It’s all too much! I can’t. I can’t even teach them spells. When they see me using your wand and ask me why I don’t have one, what am I supposed to say, then, huh? What excuse can I give?”
"You needed me, and I left you. And all this time you wanted me back and I-I thought you hated me. And then you thought I hated you. I didn't mean for you to think that. I could never hate you, Harry. I am so stupid."
"Now I know you're my Harry!" Draco squeaked between laughs, "Y-you're positively seething with rage, yet you're trying to make it sound like you're casual just to respect my wishes even though you're bloody gritting your teeth. Do you even realize what a horrible liar you are? This is so bloody funny!"
Draco stole quick glances between Harry and the plate. Harry felt like understood the blonde's reasoning, but be also wanted Draco to say it so Harry could jump in with an argument. But it looked like draco wouldn't speak, so Harry continued anyways.
He often stayed up thinking about it, about what could've happened to Draco. But, he would never know. His owls were never delivered for the first few weeks. The first returned had his heart leaping in his chest. It only held three words that he would keep seeing after every subsequent letter: 'leave me alone'. Any further attempt he made to find Draco was in vain, until today.
The day went smoothly after that, with Harry sending calming thoughts and emotions through their link as Draco silently approached customers and quietly asked what they wanted to have. The blonde hoped that his exhaustion wasn’t apparent by the end of the day. He couldn’t believe he had actually made it through the 4-hour shift without collapsing. His feet were killing him and he felt faint, but he smiled at the brunette nonetheless, telling him they could go now.
The brunette was cut off by a slight hiss of agony that the blonde tried to cover with a cough but failed. Harry’s eyes widened. Draco’s face was contorted in pain and his hands were starting to clench into fists again. The brunette instantly reached out and grabbed both of them, not knowing what else to do.
As soon as the brunette suggested this to Draco, though, the blonde looked absolutely frightened as he shook his head frantically. Draco pulled away from Harry entirely and wrapped his arms around himself.
"So, how did you meet him?" he asked suddenly. It's the question that Draco had been dreading but he saw it coming from miles away. So he told the story, leaving out the details that he knew would upset Harry, but it seemed he had failed yet again. By the end of it, Harry was in tears.
"please" the blonde cried out quietly and Harry panicked upon seeing that he actually had tears in his eyes. He knew only fear reduced Draco Malfoy to tears.
Harry murmured a thank you but didn't let go of draco's arms. The blonde had to pry harry's hand off his arms so he can lay down on the bed as fat away from him as possible. Harry wouldn't have that. He quietly and finally u cast the spell and scooted over to draco then wrapped his arms around him, ignored how he stiffened under his touch. Harry pressed his chest against the blonde's back and finally felt draco relax. He fell asleep trying to pretend, if only just for a moment, that everything was fine, that his draco had come back to him, normal, and would stay forever.
Harry’s thoughts came to a stop there. Why couldn’t he remember what had happened that day? He was in the apothecary and he purchased some potions, but then he somehow left without them and woke up the next day in Grimmauld place, not remembering how he got there. Had Malfoy obliviated him?! That bastard! What the hell had he done to Harry?
Draco immediately beamed and started scarfing down the food on the plate. Harry couldn't decide whether he should be glad that his lover was eating or worried that he was only doing so because Harry wanted it. He decided something was better than nothing and smiled at the blonde.
Harry lead Draco into the bathtub, then left and closed the door behind him, casting cushioning charms everywhere and undoing the thoughts spell. The blonde looked like he could barely walk and Harry didn't want him falling and breaking his neck. He was snapped out of his thoughts by a loud scream erupting from inside the bathroom.
"Y-you're w-worse than them, you know?" he shouted, "Y-you- at least they were being honest about hating me! And - and at least Ron is trying to make me feel better, even if he’s doing it in the crappiest way possible! But you h-have t-to play all these m-mind games with m-me and g-get me to l-like you so it would h-hurt worse when you-you betray me!"
But Harry had spoken first, desperate to know what draco was thinking and thus dooming any chance he had at getting the blonde to talk.
Harry looked back at him with a smile and continued to drag him away, meeting no resistance from Draco. Draco could only catch a few words of what Harry was saying, too lost in the feel of his hand and his wonderful smile. It felt like… home.
“Are you deaf, too? Wow, deaf and stupid. You must’ve been a real handful for your mommy,” the guy said loudly, causing the others on his table to snicker. Draco’s stress levels went through the roof, but the blonde was still telling Harry not to do anything.
He still couldn't move, not until Harry cast that damned spell and saw Draco's bruised and broken body, along with the scars from the bathroom incident that seemed to hold Harry's gazr for too long before he finally rested his eyes on the mark and the two slashes from his attempts. Only then could he turn to rest on his side, pull his knees up to his chest and weep in a ball, no longer giving a damn about his perfect day.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes pleadingly. Only then did Harry see that Draco was still crying. The blonde cupped harry's cheek with the hand not holding onto his waist, then swiftly let it go and returned to hugging Harry's chest. For once, Draco's thoughts matched his words.
The blonde smiled. Actually smiled then erupted into full blown laughter with occasional wines that suggested his ribs were bruised. Harry just gaped at him, waiting for any explanation.
The blonde gulped as he once again faced the tables. He saw that a couple of teenagers had just walked in and approached them very slowly, only to be side-tracked by a familiar voice calling to him.
“Our job isn’t just ours. It’s everybody’s. It’s everyone’s job to report the bad guys and if they don’t, we’ll just stay in our offices twiddling our thumbs while the bad guys keep wronging more and more people and these people won’t report it, either. Pretty soon, the whole wizarding world will just be one big lawless, dangerous battlefield. And, I hate to say it, mate, but it would be the fault of the people who didn’t report the bad guys in the first place. Do you get what I am saying?” the red-head finished softly, but his words cut through Harry like pieces of glass.
He's so frustrating and confusing. Draco didn't know what to make of it. Why couldn't he be like normal people and tell him to piss off if he doesn't want him around? Why does he pretend? Why is he doing this?
Younger draco buried his face in his arms tightening his hold on himself and attempting become one with the walls.
"Thank you, Harry. I really appreciate what you've done for me, tonight." Draco whispered, then began heading down the stairs that lead to the sitting room, with Scruffie in toe.
He didn't know what to make of it, of any of it, but he had made the mistake of being too pushy and loud with Draco far too many times and he swore he wouldn't do it again, even if every step out of the store felt like he was sinking deeper into water, unable to breathe. He briefly looked back to see that Draco was no longer in the Aisle and that his shopping was left behind. Exhaling loudly, he left the store and apparated back to Grimmauld place, only to return at 1:40 am, too eager to wait another second. He ran through all the questions he had, all the scenarios that could take place. Whether he was allowed to invite Draco back to his place since it was freezing and there was nothing open. He normally wouldn't have thought of it twice, but draco had looked so scared....
Suddenly, Harry's hands were on Draco's chin and Draco was forced to look into his green, wet, serious eyes.
Draco didn't speak. He stared at Harry, mouth agape and stood still for a moment, then he felt something shift and heard Harry murmuring a spell.
“Honestly, Harry. Do you really think I could figure out what’s wrong with him in a single second and cure him before he goes home for the day?” she asked in an indignant voice.
As he went through his stuff, he kept racking his brain, thinking about every single event of the past few days, wondering if anybody had been acting differently around him because they
Although the blonde, by all appearances, seemed fine, Harry couldn't, for the life of him, stifle his worry. He had never pulled at his hair as much as he had during these three days while he was desperately waiting for Wednesday to arrive so the blonde would just bloody hell eat something.
Harry got his answer on the next page. The page that broke his heart then stomped all over it. He was in the library 'studying' with Ron and Hermione, when he reached that dreaded page. It was tear-stained and marked with...blood.
"H-how is it f-fine when you could've d-died?" he chokes out, then mumbles "when you w-would've l-left me."
"Everything is fine now, though." he said softly, trying to coax Harry into calmly down. He didn't know what set him off until Harry spoke through sobs.
“Hey, blondie! You done talkin’ to your boyfriend yet? I’ve been waiting for almost an hour here!” a young man shouted from across the room, causing all eyes to turn to Draco. Harry felt the blonde’s distress through their link and quickly tried to remedy the situation. That customer had only walked into the cafe a few minutes earlier. Harry wouldn’t let him get away with humiliating Draco like this. But, just as the brunette was about to stand and yell at the guy, Draco stopped him.
“I know,” the blonde said quietly, then continued when he noticed that the brunette only looked more confused, “I-I mean, I know, but I don’t really know. It’s complicated, Harry. I-I think my illness has taken a turn for the worse.”
"Piss off you mudblood's son! Don't touch me!" he yelled loud enough for his father to hear, which seemed to satisfy the older man as a faint smile made itself known on his face. Draco's eyes said 'sorry', but Harry didn't care about the empty insult. He was more worried than he had ever been about his friend and it took everything he had not to drag Draco off the field and to the kitchens. He could give Draco this game. The blonde promised everything would change afterward. And he promised he wouldn't go through with it if he was feeling too sick. Harry believed him.
“I’m fine. Let’s go before our lunch break ends,” Draco said, then grabbed Harry’s hand and quickly dragged him into the nearest pastry shop.
I know the chapters are short, but keep in mind, this year passed as a blur to Draco and he wasn't really there for most of it, so that made Harry too confused to be able to get moments with Draco. Even the guilt Harry feels will be short-lived. This is happening during the beginning of a war and Harry isn't too busy for Draco, but he caught on that there was a serious problem too late and Draco was gone before he could do anything. Anyway, I think the last chapter will wrap up the story pretty well and set up the transition for the second part even better.
"I'll kill him!" he snapped, unable to hold back. He stood up and started pacing around the sitting room, oblivious to the frightened expression on the blonde's face. "who does this guy think he is? Fucking jackass, monster rapist who beats up his partners? That's just weak. He's... He's... Gods, I don't even know a curse strong enough to describe him. I'll go back there then grab him by his pretty hair and smile when he screams no, then I'll drag him all the way to the aurors office. I'll fill in the report and watch him and his reputation be destroyed in front of the entire Wizarding world. He won't feel so powerful then. I'll spit on his face, I will and I'll tell the guards to keep his clothes from him for a while, just so he can feel what it's like to be on display. I'll love every minute of it!"
“Yes,” Malfoy said firmly, still keeping his professional tone, “It was often used by homosexual male purebloods so they could bond with a female and produce heirs. That was before the birthing gene was found to be present in both genders, rendering the whole process of false marriages and the potion useless.”
The brunette looked back in an instant, failing to see what could be petrifying the blonde at first. Luckily, his Auror training came in handy. When he inspected the area closer, he noticed it: a wizarding camera, pointing right at Malfoy. The blonde was under surveillance, knew about it, and let it happen? Why would he do that?
He ran inside and yanked back the curtain to find Draco curled up in a ball on the floor of the tub with the water hitting his bruised skin. He was whimpering and letting out soft moans. It was clear the water was causing him pain.
"it's funny." draco said loudly, breaking his hysteric laughing, "I used to think so, too. Somehow, I thought when it was all over, we would have so many and I would come home from work and find more kids running towards me than the entire weasley clan and they would look up at me with green eyes and say 'daddy's home!' and we would build a fort together. Gods, I was so stupid."
He had never told his friends about how bad things were at the Dursley's because.. Well how can he just bring something like that up? Harry remembered all too clearly all the reactions he had gotten from the other kids in his room the say his uncle had landed him in the hospital.
The sitting room, main bathroom, and all of the bedrooms were clear, which only made Harry panic more. Was the locator spell off? Did Draco really leave? Harry's chest constricted. That spell was everything! Everything! He may never find his Draco again if it stops working!
"Are you daft?" he yelled. He didn't mean to. He was just too upset and frantic and would've done anything to prevent the blonde from walking away from him again. He was too much in thought to notice Draco flinching at his words. "They've emptied out your vaults. They've taken the manor. Your parents were sentenced to the kiss. They took away your wand. You have nothing!"
Harry was still smiling hours after Draco left. For once, the blonde hadn't needed coaxing to eat and didn't give any negative comments about himself throughout the entire night. Harry called it progress, even if it was a bit forward and Draco would likely return to his usual state afterwards. But maybe he wouldn't? Maybe this was some kind of breakthrough? Maybe after a few more dinners and get togethers, Draco would finally stop being so harsh on himself and start actually enjoying life as opposed to letting it pass by him.
Tears started to flow down Draco’s face when he received no reply from the brunette through their mind link. He didn’t even feel anything from Harry’s side of the bond. Did that mean…
"Liar!" Harry shouted. Draco's eyes widened further and his tears finally started falling. "You could just fix it here! No. You're lying, like you did when you said you'd back out if things got too much. You're just trying to get away from me and sodding die from hunger somewhere and you're using a fucking letter as an excuse. Well, I've had enough of your lies, Malfoy! You're not leaving until you eat!"
“No. Who cares if they see? It’s none of their business. Besides, they’ll all know sooner or later. I don’t plan on letting you go anytime soon.”
Harry swiftly left the wing and raced to his room, where a box of cookies was already sitting on his bed.
" There. Everything is unlocked. You can leave if you want to. I am not keeping you prisoner." Harry said softly with an edge to his tense voice. Upon seeing the hurt and understanding flash across Draco's face, he quickly added "But I don't want you to, just to be clear. I want you here even if you drive me crazy. It's one of the things I love about you. I still find it cute."
“Harry, I don’t know who or what you’re talking about and why you’re this upset, but if you tell me, I promise I’ll do everything in my power to make it alright again.” Draco murmured softly after Harry stopped crying.
Well, that's it. I am sad to see this story end, but it was time. Thank you so much for everyone who has followed it so far and bore with me when it took me more than a week to update at instances (I know some authors might do that and I am not judging, but I just don't like to). A special thanks to JJ, who betaed a huge chunk of the third part and motivated me to update more often. I hope you all enjoyed it up until the end!
