Her expression slipped into her normal exasperation at him not knowing something he should have. “In History of Magic, of course. Grindlewald used one in the Battle Under Paris only a few months before Dumbledore defeated him.”
“Try not to scream, all right?” Bill murmured, and then he was pulling Harry up with a sharp tug.
Harry ducked as the jet of red slammed into the tree over his head. Another stunning charm whipped toward him and this time he managed to throw up a shield. It hit the center of his chest and made him stumble, but he had his wand out and ready just as—
Robards nodded. “Thank you, Andromeda. Bill told me you treated Harry.”
Taking a deep breath, he turned back to Kingsley. He waited, watching the Minister for Magic, a man he’d once thought to be impenetrable and unwavering walk up to him—and Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more separating them now than just space. More than sides in a war he seemed destined never to leave.
Robards inclined his head, gave Harry another long, searching look. “We’ll be in touch, Mr. Potter.” He turned on his heel for the door.
Harry exhaled a laugh.
Andromeda didn’t meet his gaze as she began healing his ribs. Harry grimaced through the few minutes of spellwork, but when it was done he could breathe easy again. His lungs didn’t hurt every time they expanded, anyway. She backed away when it was done, her expression closed off and impassive. The kettle began to whistle and she looked like she was rooted to the spot before her eyes closed and she left again.
“Don’t leave. Don’t leave me—”
Harry couldn’t just stand here, watching. He couldn’t—
“Patrick.” She looked up at him expectantly, as if Harry was supposed to have exclaimed out loud. “Oh, but you know Patrick!”
looking far too alive for someone who had stood at the center of a blast which had broken apart stone and taken out a good chunk of the courtyard, stood on the other side of the small circle which had formed around Bellatrix. He held out his wand with a kind of ruthless challenge, his eyes burning, a trickle of blood running out the side of his mouth and down from his left temple. His grip was steady and sure, and a reckless light burned in his pale eyes now.
After fumbling around for his glasses he opened his mouth to call for Kreacher, only to go still at the sight of a steaming cup and a spread of bread and jam on a tray sitting next to his bed. Concern wormed its way into the back of his head, but he ignored it for now. He was starving, and he couldn’t think clearly.
He was a bit lonely, sure, but every time he thought about Ginny these days, it was just a small sadness. Followed by a healthy amount of self-loathing, but still, only a bit sad. He missed her, but only because she was brilliant and he liked spending time with her.
He was not so happy when Ron unceremoniously kicked him out two days after his birthday—a quiet affair with Bill, Fleur, Ron, George, and Angelina. Harry had worried someone might think it odd that Ginny wasn’t with them but no one brought it up. Harry didn’t question it, he was just relieved he didn’t have to explain anything yet.
Malfoy’s confusion had turned into a strange kind of amusement. “They were at Hogwarts during Snape’s tenure. They followed orders from the death eaters who taught them. They’re
Except…that was wrong, wasn’t it? The door to the Chamber of Secrets had looked a bit like this. Where the box was decorated in roots and branches and leaves, the door had been entirely covered with snakes. But the way it opened was…similar, for some reason. A coppery taste filled his mouth as his tongue seemed to want to form words in Parseltongue, even though there was no snake to talk to.
Harry cast around for a quill to respond, but the piece of parchment was ripped from his hand, disappearing once more into a puff of smoke. Another ten seconds, and one more, slightly larger, piece of parchment popped in to Harry’s lap.
Eventually the sounds of the house grew a bit more intentional. Light was coming in from the drapes. Nearly dawn, then. As if summoned by the thought, a few cracks of people apparating sounded outside the house, followed by low, murmured voices.
Harry just stared at him. The image of Malfoy Manor was burned into his psyche—the dark, shadowed hall, stretching out farther than he could even see until it was swallowed by a thick, cloying darkness, the sound of screaming somewhere beneath his feet, a smell rank and sharp that seeped up through the wooden floors. And when the screaming stopped, overwhelming, suffocating silence. He’d been in the house for less than an hour, and it still disturbed him.
A surge of self-loathing ripped through him, anger on her behalf. She’d lost her sister, and she was here, coming in to the same building where the aurors who’d killed Ravenna were working.
He’d looked into it himself, managing to convince a bright-eyed and overeager receptionist who clearly wanted to do nothing more than help Harry however he could to let him into the Ministry records, and he’d been right about the severity of the punishment. While there were no laws in place that prohibited this kind of deterrent with this level of severity, it’d been struck from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s policies over a century ago. More than one Head Auror had seemed to find punishing children distasteful in their written files surrounding the change.
His voice ricocheted off the high ceilings of the main staircase, shocked by the violence of his final word. He hadn’t meant the last to slip out. He hadn’t meant to crack open in front of Draco Malfoy. He took a jerking step back, tripping over the stairs, dropping his gaze as he worked through the panic overwhelming his anger.
She blinked, caught off guard. “I…” The girl swallowed, nervous, but stared with determination up at Harry. She was very short. It made her look a lot younger than seventeen. “I wanted to thank you. The interview you gave—it was kind. I don’t know you, obviously, but… It was… Thank you.”
Voldemort snarled, stabbing his wand forward only for it to glance off the concave shell of Harry’s shield. “I am the master of
He didn’t know why them wanting to make him feel better was a bad thing. Maybe he wished it wasn’t necessary in the first place.
And how had Goyle thought Malfoy was somehow working with Harry? Because he’d turned against the death eaters in the final moments of the battle? Because he chose to surrender after instead of run? That had nothing to do with Harry.
Kamau drew in a small breath as she looked at Harry, brow furrowing in alarm. Robards was as stoic as Harry had ever seen him, though there was a distinct air of grim calm to his person that hadn’t been there during his questioning. The young woman’s eyes widened behind her glasses, and she muttered something under her breath.
“I thought their house was searched when Lucius got arrested.”
“Nothing,” Ron repeated. “Okay. Sure. Because it’s always
The world was breaking all around him, and all he could hear was the sound of his own ragged breath.
Right. Kids should be with their families, shouldn’t they? They should be with the people they love and who love them.
Harry took another step, and another, until he slowly, steadily, walked toward Voldemort. The closer they got, the more the golden cage bristled and crackled. The bead between them slipped another few inches. Voldemort snarled and surged—it nearly made Harry stop as he felt the fear now choking out the rage.
Harry didn’t head for the Floo Hub.
A shape pressed down against his back, a lean, long shape that was firm and taut and smelled of decay and ash. Arms wrapped around him, drifted lower to press against his stomach, to cage him between the ground and the pressure at his back. Fingers dug into the flesh of his waist. Soft lips brushed his ear. A hum vibrated through his chest, content and predatory. It was all Harry could do not to buck at the sound, at the
When Hermione remained silent, waves of tension pouring off her, Harry inclined his head. “Daphne.”
good. He’d always felt protective of his friends, he’d wanted to live up to Dumbledore’s expectations, but he’d never felt both at the same time. He had sacrificed himself to save all those people, but it hadn’t felt as desperate at this. This violent, overwhelming urge to shield something so much smaller and more fragile than himself. A need to be good enough, not to set an example, but just to be worthy of having the responsibility. All those lives had been precious and important, but Teddy felt like
His tangled mess of thoughts was impossible to unwind—how he knew what it was like to grow up with no parents, no idea of where you came from except for pictures and other peoples’ memories, how lonely and horrible it was to think you had no one to turn to, no one who would be there for you if you needed it, no matter what. He couldn’t bear the thought of any kid experiencing that, especially not Teddy, who, in his biased opinion, might be the best toddler in all of England.
After a few days—or maybe just one, he couldn’t remember—he found himself crouching in the small clearing Kreacher’d made for him in the center of the attic. His empty plate of sausages and eggs sat on Regulus’s table. He was eating. He’d keep eating. Even if he couldn’t really taste it anymore. He’d been drawing in the dust by one of the older stacks of parchment, finger tracing the triangle, the circle, the line, when he froze.
Andromeda reached over and took his hand, dragging her thumb over the cut on Harry’s palm.
in the middle of an empty flat.
“Felicity is one of the Magical Law Enforcement’s senior hit wizards,” Robards supplied. “She’s here because… Well. I suppose we should get to it.”
The need to talk to her should feel more urgent, shouldn’t it? Shouldn’t he want to hug her, touch her, make sure she was all right? Ron and Hermione hadn’t let go of each other’s hand for hours. Harry should want the same. He
Hermione said nothing, eyes hard. Her brow furrowed and he could see how much she wanted to scream at him. He knew exactly how angry she was, and he hated knowing he was the cause of it, but he couldn’t do nothing because he didn’t want her or Ron to be mad or because he was worried what other people would think. She shoved a curl which had come free from her bun behind her ear, rolled her shoulders back to launch into another argument. Harry braced himself.
Robards was just as professional as he had been last time, nodding his head toward Harry. “Thank you for meeting me so early, Harry.”
“Sorry, Professor,” Harry muttered, anger nearly choking him. “Turns out you were wrong after all.”
“Yeah, they’re both in Azkaban,” Bill said. “Robards thought it would be a death sentence to throw them in with the other death eaters while waiting for their trial, but he was shouted down. Yeats wouldn’t hear it. Wouldn’t be surprised if they get moved, though, after the trials.”
“Ravenna Lamar was only fourteen.”
“You think I need your charity?”
he whispered, fixing the target in his mind, not giving it words, just an image and a location and an urgency he hoped would be conveyed through the spell. He’d never done this before and he had no idea if it would work. He had no idea what he’d do if it didn’t.
He felt their eyes on his back as he walked through the pub. Bless them both, neither Bill nor Charlie brought it up again. Harry assumed Bill had warned Charlie off. He hadn’t told Bill he and Ginny had split up, but he probably guessed when Harry spent a full month at his house and didn’t seem to mind the fact that his supposed girlfriend never visited or floo-ed except to check in with Bill.
After draining his third cup—Kreacher had realized quickly that Harry liked it strong and sweet, and now Harry was in danger of developing a habit it was so good—he sat there listlessly, staring at the peeling wallpaper and hazy light filtering in from the front sitting room. There was less dust today. Come to think of it, he hadn’t coughed once since he’d gotten back.
Malfoy staring up at Harry from the base of a broken staircase like he was desperately searching for something, ash and blood caking his face.
The moment his eyes had widened. The moment he realized he’d lost.
He had known Harry was alive in the courtyard, and if his plan was always to attack Voldemort, he had done it
Harry scowled, taking a sip of his mostly untouched ale. It was lukewarm. He hadn’t been paying attention to whatever Ron was talking about, and it looked like he was about to be given shit for it.
Harry jolted as a jarring sensation filtered through his chest. Fear and disgust so strong it made him stumble backwards. He looked up, eyes going immediately to the other figure standing in the open circle.
But if these were Regulus’s notes in the weeks leading up to his death, Harry guessed what they must be about, and if anyone deserved to read them, it’d be him.
“But—,” he started, eyes burning, a heavy weight pressing down on his chest, “I—I killed someone, Bill. I can’t… I
That’s how strange she thought he was acting. They’d been on opposite sides of an argument before, obviously. They’d butted heads, shouted at each other—fought when neither one of them had been willing to give ground. But to dismiss him entirely…
Malfoy staring at him, his gaze heavy and probing, making him feel uneasy. What the fuck had come over him today? Maybe it was just being in the Ministry again. It’s not like this place conjured warm fuzzies for him. Or maybe he was just reacting normally to someone he hated looking at him like he wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch Harry or—
“You knew Ginny and I—”
Why was he trying to convince himself this was normal?
Harry leaned back and rubbed his face. This was insane. All of this was done. Voldemort was dead. It didn’t matter anymore what he knew about horcruxes.
He kept losing his train of thought, drifting, staring down into his drink and thinking of children with metal cuffs on their ankles and blank, dead eyes.
“Dora was just like him when she was his age,” Andromeda told him over tea one day in the sunny kitchen of her small cottage outside of Oxford. She had moved after the war, telling him quietly on his first visit that she couldn’t handle the memories in the old house all on her own.
He stopped when the crowd parted to reveal Malfoy leaning against the fountain in almost the same position Harry had seen him a week ago—staring right at him. Malfoy looked every bit as polished as he had before, though there was a restless light to his eyes, a tension in him today. Dimly Harry noted Zabini try to get Malfoy’s attention, another figure, Nott, take a few more steps toward him. Malfoy didn’t so much as acknowledge them.
Still burning with rage, Voldemort’s eyes narrowed. A harsh, choking scream escaped from his lips.
He didn’t know where the last had come from. His anger was built over regret and frustration, but he hadn’t realized how much saying it out loud would hurt.
Harry shook his head, eyes locked on the far horizon. If he kept looking, he would find out how to get there. To cross the expanse and just fly off the edge of the world. There had to be something better out there, something easier and warmer. Something that didn’t make him hurt just to feel alive.
Harry could feel the tension rolling off Malfoy even without looking at him, could practically hear the beating pulse of his blood as he forced himself not to rise to the bait.
It was easier to affect the state of something if that thing was rid of anything else which might interfere with it. The difference between mopping a floor with all the furniture in its usual place, and a floor with everything moved out of the room.
“Great,” Harry said, hurriedly shaking her hand and adding, “pleasure to meet you, I mean, m’am.”
And it was all his.
Hogwarts had been turned into a war zone. Maybe it was better for everyone to take a year to heal. Maybe everyone else would rather be somewhere else, with their families.
He stared down at Regulus’s notes, rereading again to make sure he wasn’t misconstruing something. A soft, persistent ringing began somewhere between his ears. Like he’d been hit by a bludger, his vision swimming and his world knocked sideways as he fell into the uncaring air, but without the pain to let him know he was still conscious.
There was a moment of silence as Harry felt them share a look.
“I could teach you so many things,” Tom murmured, snaking his other hand around Harry’s waist. The nail of his thumb pressed into Harry’s wrist until blood welled up and dripped down his forearm, black and shining like the pupils of Tom’s eyes. It hurt, but it didn’t matter. None of it mattered.
he told himself. Molly and Arthur were the closest things to parents Harry had, and he’d basically ignored them all summer.
For a moment, Harry couldn’t look away. For one infinite moment, he didn’t want to.
And Malfoy was still staring at him.
After the second, more insistent tap of the owl, he moved to the window. With a small pang of heartache he fished a treat out of the little jar he kept there, stroking the bird’s head as it munched happily and gave him a soft hoot of thanks. It’d been over a year now since Hedwig’s death. He still didn’t know if he wanted to get another owl. Every time he really thought about it, it made him feel horrible. Like it was an insult to her memory.
“He’s Lucius Malfoy’s son. He took the dark mark the summer before our sixth year at Hogwarts.”
Kreacher blinked up at him, expression crumpling.
anything in jail, after all.
He pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes to stop himself from crying and fought to hold himself together. He wanted to break apart, to smash something, to shout at the top of his lungs until his voice was gone and the pain was just physical. Until he couldn’t worry anymore because he was too tired.
Another hot tear scored down Harry’s cheek. “I haven’t been a boy since you tried to kill me seventeen years ago over the corpse of my dead mother.”
“I don’t like it,” a deep, vibrational voice cut through the window, making Harry hesitate.
The feeling was odd and slow—standing in the center of the parlor on the ground floor, a shimmer in the air around him as a string of pearlescent beads of light floated out of the tip of his wand and sank into the walls and the floor. Just like in the cleansing ritual, he felt the outline of the house, the shape of its staircases and foundations, the pipes that hummed like veins in the walls. Where before he’d been wrestling with it, trying to purge whatever darkness had lingered in the house over the years of neglect, now it felt as simple as casting
White sparks engulfed Bellatrix and almost knocked her forward onto her face. She spasmed, her face gone white with pain. A shriek of fury spilled from her lips when saw who had attacked her.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry caught Bill’s sad smile. “I… It’s okay, Percy—”
“Ah, Kreacher,” Harry started, pulling his eyes from a stack of parchment so old it looked like it might burst into dust if he so much as breathed on it, “when I said I wanted to organize, I more meant cutlery or clothes or—”
“Right,” he laughed, “because why else would you ask me down here if the court had no interest in what I had to say? Believe me, I’d prefer if all of you pissed off and left me the bloody hell alone, but you’re not going to do that, are you? You care what I think, so I’m going to give you my unvarnished opinion. To do otherwise would be tantamount to lying, and I shouldn’t tell lies, should I? I thought you people frowned on that sort of thing.”
And they would lose what little peace of mind they’d been able to regain since the day he’d killed Voldemort. He could take that away from them. He could make them afraid again. Again, he could pull them down into his world of death and dark magic and make them live through it just like he had to live through it. It was bad enough knowing Bill and Andromeda knew pieces of it, knowing they were worried about him. That they were in danger because of him.
A flash of red fire arched over the golden dome, sparks raining down on Harry where it brushed the crackling light.
“I’ll put out the good china for you.” Malfoy gave Harry a final searching look. “Be seeing you, Potter. Probably soon. I’ll be the one in the defendant’s chair.”
Pain stabbed through his stomach just below his ribs. He wasn’t hearing any spells, how was Goyle managing to— He gasped, the wind knocked out of him as Goyle’s knee came down on his hip. Something fragile cracked. His vision blurred as involuntary tears leaked from his stinging eyes.
Sharp and subtle, this intruder. He knew without knowing how that it wasn’t the first time they’d visited his dreams. Or perhaps it was the other way around. He couldn’t say what the difference was, really.
As he watched, the boy beside her reached up slowly and took her wrist, pulling it down to rest on her knee and cover it with his own.
His mouth opened before he realized what he was doing—
Harry stared for a long time at Andromeda’s neat handwriting, unable to stop rereading, like if he set it down the words would vanish.
“Interesting,” Hermione repeated. “I suppose that’s one way to put it.”
The reassurance was enough to get him through his fireplace and into the Ministry of Magic, and after, well—he had plenty of practice being the center of unpleasant attention.
And if there was a small part of him that thrilled a bit at the idea of doing something reckless, something he knew without a doubt that both Ron and Hermione would soundly oppose, Harry didn’t much care right then.
But you’ve already helped so much!”
Ron exhaled slowly, closing his eyes as if for patience. “Fucking hell, Harry, this is a lot. Even for you.”
Regulus had stuck on a passage focused on the nature of ghosts and the departed souls of those who had died, how they needed to prepare themselves for remaining on this plane before they died in order to exist outside their own body when it failed them. The author had also warned would-be necromancers to ensure that the soul had truly left the body before attempting to reanimate it, as the base nature of an intact and unbroken human soul defied cohabitation within the same physical form as the spark of false life one needed to conjure to animate a dead body.
“Harry, come on,” Bill said, reaching for him.
He’d never been in a stable before, but of course he had—why was he being so unreasonable?
Harry held Draco’s gaze as long as he could. A flicker, maybe, somewhere behind his ribs—or maybe he was just looking for something anywhere he might find it. He held it until the crowd pulled him away. Until he was forced to let it go.
The effort to move managed to consume all his higher faculties. He focused on getting up, on standing, on holding back the noises he wanted to make when he felt where Goyle had—stabbed him? Harry hadn’t seen a knife, and he hadn’t heard Goyle cast anything else. What the fuck had he done, and how had it happened so fast? How had he been able to overpower Harry so easily? Time flipped forward and back, and he tried to gauge how long it had been since Goyle’d sent the stunning spell. Five minutes? Less, more? He didn’t know how long he’d been on the ground unable to move.
fault you went and blew your own life up! You lose it in front of the whole fucking Wizengamot, then you shut yourself in here so you don’t have to deal with the fallout, because apparently you’re too much of a pansy to face up to the fact that you just
Not this world, though.
Charlie took a long drink, shooting Harry another oddly furtive look. “You thinking about it, though?”
He saw the vague impression of the person beside him—with fine ankles and pale, nearly pearlescent skin. He knew that if he looked up they would vanish, so he kept his eyes forward, took in what he could from what he could feel.
Harry knew one moment of unadulterated fear. He opened his mouth to scream.
was doing. How disappointing for you—”
A small, painful knot squeezed in Harry’s stomach. He remembered their frustration and anger when they found out Kreacher had taken something and hidden it, how he’d believed Sirius when he said that Kreacher was a mean, spiteful thing who only wanted Sirius to go away and serve his dead mistress.
Two days later he was kneeling on the cold, damp floor of what might have once been the cellar of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, but seemed now to be a breeding ground for every kind of spider Harry could imagine.
“You can delude yourself all you like about the radical changes they’re making here. I’m sure it sounds lovely and they’re desperate for you to think they’ve gotten their act together, but don’t be a naive idiot just because it’s easier. Of course they’re bringing in the children of pureblood families who might have sympathized with the likes of me.” Malfoy laughed, the sound hollow and tired. “Because terrorizing a generation of kids won’t lead to any utterly predictable consequences when they get older and more cynical.”
“You’re one to talk,” Charlie said with a laugh.
Sure they would. If it fell in line with what they wanted. Of course they’d want Hermione to support them. All of Britain knew she was clever and brilliant. Her vote of confidence would be nearly as powerful as Harry’s.
In a moment of self pity, he wondered what his parents would have thought of him turning on the Ministry. The only first hand experience he’d had of his parents was filtered through Snape’s memories, and they weren’t even in the same country as impartial. He had stories from their friends, sure, and everyone who’d known them thought they were good people, moral, brave people, who didn’t deserve what happened to them. Maybe they’d understand.
Malfoy was just on his mind. That was all. Had been all summer but that was understandable, considering what’d happened after the Battle at Hogwarts and then the trials and Goyle…
she said quickly, watching Harry with hard, frantic eyes.
Absolutely not.
Harry knew, somehow, that Malfoy was looking directly at his parents when he whispered, “I’m—
“Hello to you too, Malfoy.” Harry considered standing up, feeling strangely imbalanced while looking up at him, but then he thought—no, better to do nothing and make Malfoy do all the work. “I step on a cat or something to offend the universe and summon you out of your hell hole?”
Playlist on
A fog of confusion settled over him. Not unconsciousness, just disorientation. Time slipping around him, behaving in strange ways. One minute he thought he could hear Kreacher ranting, his voice sharper and angrier than Harry had ever heard it, and then there was crying, someone whispering into their hands around choked sobs. Laughter brushed through his mind, followed by the tinkle of china and the warm sounds of conversation. His own voice shouting through the cavernous house, panicked and asking for Sirius. The sound of a door slamming.
“This isn’t the Burrow or Shell Cottage, Bill,” Harry said, voice stronger than it had been in hours. “Anyone could find me here right now if they wanted to, if they were really serious about it. I’m not staying here with my godson in the next room. Not when people are—are destroying
“I—can’t. This isn’t… You’re not—”
A strangely distant thought drifted through his mind,
He turned before he could see Kingsley’s reaction. He walked away and he forced himself not to feel guilty, like he should take it all back and try to be someone Kingsley Shacklebolt could admire. It was still there, that purpose, that path. Robards would give him a job. Kingsley would help him. The window on that opportunity was closing, but he could salvage this. If he wanted to.
Harry knew a few of the words, but he was saved the trouble of translating himself by the second line. This one done in elegant, scrolling script, slanted and slashed across the paper with a flourish of the ink at the end, as if the person had been taught to write deliberately, for show.
A light flickered on in Kreacher’s eyes and he sniffed. “Kreacher understands. Master is remembering people he lost, just like Kreacher.”
The silence held. He seemed to be weighing his words carefully, waiting. Harry wasn’t going to help him along, so he just stared.
startled him. He blinked as he was jerked out of his head, realizing with discomfort that he had been staring too hard again. His eyes were burning. His neck ached and his entire spine throbbed as he lifted his head. The fingers of his left hand were stiff and frozen, the bones cracked a bit when he tried to stretch them.
Malfoy looked away after a while, tension in the way he held his arms, crossed stiffly over his chest. His fingers clenched under sleek black leather gloves. All the tension in his eyes seemed to drain away until Malfoy looked—tired. Just like Harry. Until he looked like he was trying to go somewhere else, be somewhere far distant from this place.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. The same anger and defiance Harry had seen in Malfoy Manor flickered to life when he’d realized Malfoy knew exactly who Harry was. His left hand moved. His long fingers brushed the end of his sleeve.
Harry tried not to think how she must be feeling. He’d brought this into her life—into
His mind flickered back on slowly, images slotting in as he thought through the last thing he remembered. Cleansing Grimmauld Place. The…
“This is stupid,” he muttered under his breath even as he edged forward on his knees until he was sitting in front of the box. “You know this is stupid. You shouldn’t mess with this.” Magical items that opened at an offering of blood sat firmly in the list of things Harry knew, from experience, would later come to bite him in the arse. Riddle’s Diary had sucked in thoughts and feelings and life, hadn’t it? But if this box were a horcrux, shouldn’t he be able to tell?
so badly. Long fingers sank into his hair as he was turned, guided. Harry couldn’t breathe. His heart was beating so fast he felt like he was flying.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione murmured, reaching across the table and taking his hand. “Why didn’t you say anything? Does Ron know?”
Ron laughed, eyes wide like he thought Harry was putting him on. “Yeah, cause he was too much of a coward—”
“Died in the war.” His brow furrowed as he looked down into his tea. “One of the best aurors I ever trained.”
When Harry finally succumbed to sleep after a harrowing twenty-four hours of Skele-Gro, fending off Kreacher’s attempts to force feed him, the disorienting experience of passing out in thirty minute bursts only to wake with the bones of his hand attempting to wriggle out of his skin, reassuring Bill that he was, for the tenth time, perfectly fine and able to be in the house on his own, he dreamed of a white beach.
“One man lost his right foot, and an old woman a few fingers, but otherwise, none of the tenants were seriously wounded. Before I left I heard one man complaining about losing a chunk of his hair. The dark witch, however, lost her wand arm and a good portion of her face. Not badly enough to kill her, but she’s in a secured room at St. Mungo’s right now. The healers say she’ll live, though I’m not sure what’s going to be done with her. The small failsafe is designed to consume the caster should they try to reverse the spell. Frankly, she shouldn’t be alive. I’m inclined to think the spell was improperly cast, if she could do anything to it at all.”
Harry stared, his mind unable to keep up with what was happening right in front of him. He opened his mouth but before he could say more than, “Hermione, what the—,” she had her wand pointed directly at his chest.
He could barely stand being around anyone these days, even the people he cared about most in the whole world. If he couldn’t trust Ron and Hermione, if he couldn’t manage to love Ginny, if he couldn’t be with the only people who actually cared about him, the closest thing he would ever get to family…
“He’s staying here,” Andromeda said without hesitation. “I’ve activated the wards around the house and set up the alarms on either end of the street. You’ll need to disapparate from the hill across the road, and I won’t let anyone else in without you informing me first. I don’t care who they are.”
Of course he knew. He’d killed someone, hadn’t he?
“I’ve seen you write messages before, though.”
It was a receipt. On one side was a small list of things purchased from a gas station. Crisps, gum, a pack of cigarettes. On the other side were two lines of text. The first was big and blocky, rough, the pencil having ripped through the thin paper.
“Do you really want to do this here? In front of a hundred reporters and the entire Ministry of Magic?”
to. It also didn’t make a lick of sense but it was harder to convince himself of the truth of his feelings when her tongue was in his mouth and that sweet, flowery smell of hers was making him want to open a window just to get some fresh air. When her grip turned hard, just shy of desperate, and he felt any interest in what they were doing slip away the more he knew she was trying.
if it wasn’t a hell of a lot more
Another tear slid from his burning eyes, and this time the figure kept their hand on his face, stopping his head from turning. A thumb moved gently across his cheek.
Harry, who would make a scene and do what Kingsley, as Minister, could not do.
Bill frowned into the silence. “The things on cars, you mean?”
The silence became too horrible, so Harry did the only thing he could think to do and whispered, “I’m sorry.”
“I mean Ron and Hermione,” he said gently. “Though, I can’t help but think they’d both bolt over before you even finished explaining. That would ruin your plan to lock yourself away on your own.”
He looked around the courtroom, seeing the shocked, frightened, angry faces of witches and wizards who were older and wiser and
Ron nodded, scowling. “Merlin’s pants, you’d think they’d know better by now. He’s got a bleeding
Kingsley made a soft sound of confirmation.

He fought the urge to snap the Elder Wand in half, throw it off the bridge leading into the castle, be done with it—and never think about it again. He didn’t want the thing. In fact the more he held onto it the more he felt it tainting him, the death and power seeping out through the wood to make him furious and volatile.
It was petty and cruel and selfish, and Harry wished more than anything that he didn’t care who Ron chose. He wished it didn’t feel like he’d chosen someone else, over Harry. He wished it didn’t hurt that Ron had only come and confronted him now, after he’d publicly exploded, rather than at any point in the last few weeks.
“I have a place,” he said, trying to straighten up. He shrugged Bill off as gently as he could. “I’ll—I’ll go there. It’s in London. Kingsley knows about it. Bill too. I’m not trying to skip town, I just…” He looked at Bill, saw the struggle in his eyes. “Until we know if there are more people trying—to get to me, I’m not staying anywhere near anyone else.”
A broken, empty laugh reverberated across the silent coast.
— I’m so sorry—”
Before he could stop himself, he reached down and smoothed a few pieces of blue hair back from Teddy’s forehead.
Kids were forced to torture their friends, to watch as death eaters destroyed their home and killed their families, and you wonder why they decided not to act? I saw what happened to those who fought back. How
“Oh, no, it doesn’t have to be, if they’re the good kind. I don’t have my spectrespecs with me right now, I lent them to Rolf, so I can’t tell for sure. Do you feel an unusual amount of gloom lately?”
He wasn’t. Or if he was, it didn’t bother him. He’d gone hungry enough as a kid not to notice it anymore, and for some reason he didn’t care about the physical needs of his body right now. He wasn’t punishing himself, but eating and sleeping felt like something only people who weren’t murderers were allowed to do.
The memory of Christmas night standing in front of his parents’s grave stood out sharply in his mind.
He glanced at Narcissa but her pursed lips betrayed nothing. Lucius, Harry saw with a small twist of satisfaction, was avoiding his gaze and looked ready to bolt.
More people were muttering now, the noise lifting and swirling around him like a whirlpool. Water laced with ribbons of red. Blood. His blood. Blood of the kids in this room and Ravenna Lamar and Colin and Denis and Lavender and Fred and all the others who died to protect their home and their friends, to fight, when they should have been learning how to live.
Harry blinked, startled.
—that night in Godric’s Hollow.
“Vinnick’s still out?”
Chapter 8 Songs:
The night Harry realized this, he spent longer than he would have liked trying not to think about Malfoy, and how similar they must have been. Regulus was only a teenager when he’d signed up. Even younger than Snape. Malfoy had been every bit as confident as Regulus sounded at first. The bloke on the train who casually hand-waved about taking the dark mark might as well have been a different person than the boy Harry caught crying in the bathroom. Regulus was every bit as confident, gloating, even, as he wrote to himself about how he was the only one who’d figured out what Voldemort’s plans really were. There was none of that by the end. By the end he sounded scared.
Ron’s mouth was hanging open when Harry turned back around. “The bloody hell is wrong with you? You’re not actually upset about this, are you?”
“Let’s move on to another peer of yours,” Robards said, cutting Proulx a look when he opened his mouth to object. “Please tell us the details of your relationship with Gregory Goyle, who is currently at large and wanted for the suspected murder of three muggles.”
He’d saved Harry’s life a few times too, hadn’t he? That changed how you thought about a person. The war had changed all of them. It just put Harry off, that was all, and his life was an unmitigated disaster at the moment and he was…
Harry—”

and what he was doing more than—
“He didn’t have to walk me down here, did he?” Harry asked.
“No, no,” Harry said quietly. “No, I won’t punish you. If there’s something dangerous you’re hiding, as in something that could blow up the house or something, I’d ask for you to let me know, but otherwise…” He sighed. He couldn’t exactly tell Kreacher to turn out his pockets for anything dark. Harry was a fucking horcrux, after all. “Look, I just want to make this as easy on us as possible, yeah? You, me…the house,” he added, stopping himself from eyeing the rafters. “We’re all stuck here together. I don’t want to make it worse.”
“Draco,” Lucius said in a voice which cracked. It was so unlike his wife’s Harry struggled to think how he had once feared it. It sounded so weak now. So scared. “Come
His stomach turned the moment he thought of Malfoy, halting his fork and knife altogether for the first time in thirty minutes.
“The trick is to watch for the kettlefoxes,” she said, nodding sagely. It looked as if there were streamers tied into her hair, except they were wriggling slightly, like long worms, but not…entirely disgusting. “They know when the buzzsprites all come up from underground. Kettlefoxes do love buzzsprites. I don’t know why—they taste too much like those muggle spark plugs Arthur Weasley has in his shed. Horrible things to eat. We tried putting them in a pie once, but it was no good. Daddy thinks it was probably the type of jelly, but I think they’re just unpleasant. All that anger makes them too spicy, you know.”
He rubbed his eyes, wincing as tension began to tighten at his temples. His mind seemed to throb in fatigue, shutting down before he could overthink himself. He felt wrung out and tired.
Regulus abandoned this line of thought when he circled back to the physical creation of a horcrux. Essentially, it seemed to be the same process a person might go through to ensure their ability to become a ghost, with a more sadistic and cruel bent in the form of blood and other dark substances being consumed to ensure the soul was at its weakest before you attempted to slice a piece off. You had to prepare your body for the soul’s departure, to be able to catch it with the horcrux, somehow, and hold it before it went…somewhere else. Beyond, presumably.
“Of course I bloody knew,” Ron spat, offended. “You pop off for a month to the coast and Ginny spends all her time flying and visiting friends and being anywhere except with
And as the seconds drew on and Malfoy didn’t look away, Harry knew Malfoy could see he was alive.
He smiled down at Teddy, who seemed determined to entirely soak the stuffed elephant Harry had bought for him with his own saliva. “I keep thinking he’s gonna grow another arm or something.”
breaking. Except Dumbledore wasn’t there to put him back together again and steer him off toward his death. No one was going to put him back together again.
Felicity Burbage leaned forward, an awkward twist to her mouth. “This is where I come in. Not just here for kicks, right?” She cleared her throat and continued, more solidly, “Four hours ago, at approximately one in the morning, our office received word that a small explosion had gone off in the center of London, near St. Andrew’s Gardens.”
But he had saved Harry. More than once. That had to mean something.
“A metamorphmagus,” Harry said, voice croaking. “Yeah.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. His eyes burned with tears and his head pounded and somewhere in the distance he swore he could hear someone screaming. He could smell rust and ash and he wasn’t in a park in London anymore, he was—
Dust and smoke still rose up in the air like specters of the people they’d lost, painting the dawn and the morning hazy and soft, growing dull and yellowed by noon. A little after, Luna covering for him when no one was watching, he slipped on the invisibility cloak—and walked out into the grounds on his own.
Voldemort’s curse hit Harry’s shield and detonated. A massive wave of air and force sent those nearest toppling over into their fellows. Green shadows danced up toward the sky now turning a violent shade of orange and red. Draco looked up in panic, stumbling as he came back to the battle. He looked like he had no idea where he was or what was happening. He looked young and scared.
She gaped at him, crying silently, sagged against the door. She looked so small, smaller than she’d ever looked, and Harry hated that too because he’d caused it. How many times had she saved him and now he was shouting at her in a bathroom—and she was looking at him like he was a stranger.
of him.
went through, or Hermione or any of the other kids who spent the last year of their lives in hell! But you want to use me to boost your propoganda, to make you all feel better about yourselves? You want
He didn’t stop to think about what lay under his nerves—some part of him recycling the same images of Ravenna Lamar, his imaginary version of her, anyway, dead with her big, lifeless eyes staring up at him.
Goyle on top of him, pure hatred in his manic eyes, lank hair falling down around his dirty face.
“There,” Voldemort said quietly, taking a step toward Malfoy and opening his arms, “you see, Draco, how forgiving I am? You have erred and betrayed my trust but I will allow you to repent, as your father repented for failing me.” His voice raised as he called out to the rest of the gathered crowd. “I will forgive any witch or wizard who fought here today in service to a craven boy who valued his own life over yours. Perhaps you came here in loyalty to an old, dead wizard. Albus Dumbledore is gone. Harry Potter abandoned you and now you will—”
His mouth opened but his mind had been wiped blank. He wet his lips. “He’s—informing? Helping you, I mean?”
Harry had to reread it, and then read it again, before he began to understand.
It was perhaps the strangest thought he’d had in hours.
He did manage to pick out a few interesting books after a while, however. One ancient-looking spellbook full of charms pertaining to the hiding and guarding one’s effects. A cursory flip through told him it was very advanced stuff, far beyond the level he’d learned in school, before he landed finally on what Harry realized in surprise was the Fidelius Charm. A quick read through made him pause. He’d always thought the Fidelius Charm had to be some seriously complicated bit of magic, but the instructions were relatively simple, if vague, like they were missing half the instructions. Frowning, he checked the publication date, only to find there was no publication date, because this book had been made before the invention of the printing press. In fact, as he tried to decipher the handwriting in the front, it had been scribed and bound by a wizard named Bede at the Jarrow monastery…in 686 AD.
He didn’t know this woman. He had no real idea if she was fair or petty or impartial. All he had to go on was her policy of terrorizing children, of retribution. But he did recognize the tightness which crept over her features when he said nothing and the silence in the room remained oppressive. He’d seen it quite a lot the last few years.
Bill took a deep breath and said, firmly,
Harry fought the urge to reach out to her, to try to comfort her. He’d never spoken to this girl before, he probably wouldn’t have recognized her were it not for Ravenna’s face fixed in his mind, Malfoy’s mention of her.
with you, right? You seriously expect me to believe that?”
The pearls multiplied until he felt them settle, hovering in the air and humming at a frequency he could only just hear as a distant ringing, like the sound produced from running a finger around the mouth of a glass. He stood in the middle of a furiously bright room, the beads of light refracting like tiny stars.
“Hi,” he said, voice rough from so much talking. “Can I help you?”
“I’ll wear a tracking cuff, if you want me to. If you’re going to put a curse in it, though, you might as well throw me in a cell.”
“What is this, Kreacher?”
Harry nodded, because it seemed like something he should do. It was all going to hit him soon, he knew that, but for the moment he felt like he was floating through air, watching the ground pass under him, getting ever closer with every beat of his heart.
People swarmed in around him, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, George, Molly—all the people he had fought to protect, weeping and shouting and roaring with relief.
Kingsley blinked, a slight furrow the only sign of concern on his face. “I see.”
He could sit here for the rest of his life, which was suddenly, horrifyingly wide open now, or he could start moving. Walking seemed better than not. Walking would lead him to food. He was starving. That was something he could deal with. Maybe he’d grab a coffee after and just ride the Underground until morning, because he knew without a doubt that he wasn’t getting any sleep tonight. He could pop into a cinema, maybe. He’d never been before. He’d never had the time or the opportunity. After, he’d find somewhere high enough that he could see the sunrise and sit for a while until his head was clear and the sun warmed him up. As if the new day would make any of this more bearable.
He nodded. Hit wizards had taken Sirius in after Wormtail framed him. They’d responded to the riot during the Quidditch World Cup.
He didn’t need help for this. He didn’t want help.
His wand. He needed his wand. But all he had was a handful of flowers that began to crack and age in his hands. The petals grew black and withered, the stalks going limp. They were dying, the forest was dying. A cold wind cut through him like a knife and he braced himself against a hollow numbness crawling up his legs.
Robards’s eyes narrowed as Kamau actually smiled. “No,” Robards said after a long pause, “no, I don’t think that will be necessary, Mr. Potter. If I thought you were a flight risk, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. You’re not being charged with anything, so I can’t force you. You’re a free man.”
“Right. Sure.” Harry stopped himself from loosening his tie when an old witch with violently red hair actually walked backwards to gawp at him. “Don’t I get to know who’s questioning me?”
Dueling
He was alone in the house. Living, because there was nothing else for him to do.
Harry didn’t know the Malfoy he had seen on the battlefield.
been there. Once.
Harry took his reassurances with a tight smile, well aware that Robards thought he was telling the truth. But when he saw Malfoy walk in every night, passing Harry on his way out, sometimes followed by other Slytherins, some from his year, even—Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott—he wanted to march up to the Aurors’ Office and shout Robards down, to find this Yeats woman and ask her how the hell she thought this was all right.
She sagged a bit as she closed her eyes.
Just like the one over Harry’s heart, the one carved into Harry’s forehead.
He hated this place. He hated it so much he wondered why he’d ever thought he could work here.
of those kids were just caught up in it.”
He glared at her. It wasn’t the same. Malfoy wasn’t—
that made him want to hide from his own embarrassment. Perfectly reasonable to drop it like it had burned him. Also, perfectly reasonable, to keep an eye out for more. Maybe they’d be worth something if he could find the whole set.
A flash of white at the far edge of the room caught his eye—the shape indistinct but tall and thin, a person, maybe—but when he turned to look it was gone.
It’d take even the smartest and most enthusiastic of bibliophiles years to begin to make sense of everything hidden in this attic, but Harry started. And after a while he stopped thinking of Hermione every time he picked up a book he thought she would like, which was most books, granted.
When they were on solid ground again, Harry looked around and felt his shoulders sag.
He was still alone, but he could pretend it meant something. For a little while, at least.
Robards stared at him, eyes narrowing.
Harry registered how funny that warning was, but in the moment it took for Bill to apparate, his eyes were drawn to the path. Beyond the little copse of trees in the shadows, he saw a figure, far clearer than he should have been able to make out from this distance. Familiar.
Harry watched Malfoy take three strides away from him. A weird, sudden desire to explain himself took over, before he stood. “Malfoy.”
He felt Kingsley’s stare heavy on him. Harry looked up to find him focused intently at Harry’s right forearm, where a long, straight scar now sat.
But he wasn’t going to say that out loud. He had a feeling they would only try to reassure him, convince him it was a fluke. The product of two kids succumbing to hate.
She went bright red and spluttered. “I—I’m sure you’re thinking of someone else, young man. And I must say, this is no way to—”
He looked up. He stared at his own reflection. Without his glasses he was just a blur of colors. A shivering mass of shapes. He knew what he would see, though, if he could. Red-rimmed eyes, shaking hands, face screwed up as he cried into a sink. He didn’t have the same pale skin and white-blonde hair, but he could have been Malfoy—leaning over a sink in the bathroom trying not to fall apart.
A number of expressions twisted Malfoy’s features before he settled on wary. “It was.”
Harry grinned. “You’re a little bastard, aren’t you?”
When Harry let his mind go quiet after hours and hours of trying to figure out how to work this spell, he could feel the house more clearly than ever before. There was a presence in it, beyond just the malevolent energy left by Sirius’s mum and the Black family over the years, beyond the grime and the disrepair.
Of course, it didn’t last. Harry had almost managed to convince himself he was feeling better, more like a person, when news came that sent a crack through his seaside life.
Voldemort shot every ounce of cruelty and malice he had into his curse, and Harry knew he would start to feel it if he didn’t end this soon. It was too much, even for him. He wouldn’t have the element of surprise for long, and Voldemort was not newly reborn and still regaining his strength. Whatever life-saving power Harry had brought to the Forbidden Forest, he no longer had it. He couldn’t chance it again. He couldn’t hope that he would win out in the end just through love, and sacrifice, through being
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked with a frown. “I’m not…”
“I was gonna ask,” Harry said, grinning. “You haven’t been to the Burrow yet, have you? Looks like you’ve still got some left on your head.”
“Hogwarts, yeah.” Bill turned back slowly and asked, “Is he dead?”
The next few days of questioning went by as slowly as the first, except now Harry had lost whatever good will for the Ministry he’d managed to drum up over the last few months—making the whole process that much more painful. It didn’t help that Proulx seemed determined to provoke Harry whenever he could. Kamau and Robards continued to be friendly but firm, though Robards seemed to sense Harry’s lack of enthusiasm and was doing his best to reassure Harry that his department was aware of their past failings and committed to reforming. More than once, he admitted its flaws, and hinted heavily that he’d need new blood to shake things up. Young people who understood the risks, knew firsthand how to defend themselves.
The sound in the bar went suddenly static, like all the air had rushed into Harry’s ears and started screaming. His grip tightened on his mug. His heart pounded.

And then nothing.

“Like Snape reminded me every time he saw me I was talentless and stupid because he hated my dad so much and was obsessed with my mum and looking at me was a reminder of her?
to them!”
Their eyes locked, pale grey to bright green. The hawthorn wand crackled with life as if it rose to defend its old owner. Something bright and warm and brilliant cut through Harry’s chest right where Voldemort’s Killing Curse had hit him in the forest. It filled him with lightning and cleared his sight. For a moment all the noise around him faded, retreated.
Andromeda walked up next to him, a hand pressed gently to his shoulder. “Looks like you’re not the only one.”
with him?” Hermione asked incredulously.
the Ministry agree with me. I wasn’t the only source in the Quibbler article. I’m not the only person in this building who disagrees with your new policies. I’m just the one who’s come forward, probably because no one wants to make a fuss so soon after the war. Because the policy of your department is apparently to inflict the most psychological trauma you can on a bunch of kids and then
Ron made a noise of disgust. “That evil little toad’s been hiding your—”

before Harry’d learned who the Half-Blood Prince was. Hermione would have said it was too vague, the theory behind it thin and subjective, at best ineffective and at worst dangerous—there were too many risk factors involved with such a simple spell.
The feeling stayed with him all day and well into the night.
“Harry, look at me.”
The silence was thick when Harry finished. All three aurors stared at him, waiting.
He leaned against what was left of a wall.
“Hey, Harry, sorry,” Bill said as he jogged over, grimacing. “Had a situation in one of the vaults we’ve—” He stopped, brow lifting as he spotted who was with Harry. “Oh. Wotcher, Draco.”
She stared at him, big blue eyes startling in their intensity. “Have you been spending a lot of time in Wiltshire this summer?”
Harry opened his mouth to call out but no sound came. The dream vibrated and he felt something pushing,
After a long pause, Kreacher snapped his fingers and a stack of books appeared on the desk, followed closely by a few reams of parchment.
With a growing sense of apprehension, Harry began. Regulus’s handwriting was small and compact, neat and sparing. He recognized it from the scrap of paper in the fake locket. There was no obvious organization to them, just lines and lines of cramped script interrupted at times by lists. He saw with a frown that much of it was written in other languages. French, he could recognize, and German, he guessed, but there were a few more he had no idea about. He thought he saw a bit of Russian, maybe. Or it might be Polish, he couldn’t be sure.
The entity—which now had the vague outline of a person, a body, at least—sank lower until it was almost kneeling in front of him. Something brushed his cheek. An old, horribly tired sigh broke the silence.
There was someone waiting for him.
He followed the motion of Charlie’s throat, watching the knot dip and the muscles flex. There was another scar on his upper arm which looked freshly healed, bright red amongst the bevy of freckles.
He looked smaller now. More normal. Like all the other seventeen-year-old kids who had gone through a war. Seventeen. Bloody hell, they were all
That was a word for it.
Of course, Dumbledore thought Harry would die in the attempt. Dumbledore had
“He’s a gem of a boy, really. I must insist on giving you his information. You’d get on so marvelously. And what a quidditch player! Now, I don’t want to step on your toes, Mr. Potter, but many have said that he’s got the makings of being the finest seeker Hogwarts has ever seen! I fully expect him to make the team when he tries out once school starts up again. And he’ll have all next year to practice, oh, yes, I expect him to give you a run for your money!”
“Yeah, I don’t know that drugs would be a good idea for me.”
…whatever it was, could stop him.

a kid, and Bill was older and knew what to do. In that moment Harry wanted nothing more than to just do whatever Bill told him to do. He wanted absolution from making any decisions. It was hard to admit, but Harry still wanted someone to tell him he was going to be all right, that he was going to be safe.
A hollow laugh broke from Harry. “Sure, I imagine she’s happy to let me off. Because she hasn’t—”
“Oh, yeah?”
Harry would never be good enough for Teddy. He would never deserve this, but he wanted to try.
And he’d been brought in to comprehend Goyle and Millicent’s final ravings. He’d come in for Geraldine and Bradford too. A sin eater for Slytherin House.
“I don’t know why I’m here,” the figure whispered, his unsteady breath brushing Harry’s lips. “I don’t know why I’m letting you— I have to—stop.”
Ron scoffed. “Yeah, but that’s a formality, right? They’re probably polishing up your Order of Merlin right now. You’re the fucking Chosen One, mate. What are they going to do? Make you interview?”
“Kreacher is trying but Kreacher is only one elf! Master must know that—”

Harry looked down at his ale, an unpleasant twist in his gut. He hadn’t known she was going for that, actually. It made sense, though. She’d certainly talked about it enough when they were still together. And the year off while Hogwarts was closed would give her plenty of opportunities to get some real life experience. She was good enough to play professionally.
“How did you find me?” Harry’s voice was breaking, rough. The ocean waves crashed and the gulls over his head cried out in bell tones that something was different, changing. “Why—why are you here?”
Harry’s brow lifted. “You can’t—read?”
Her eyes brushed over him and rested on Hermione, something speculative about her gaze, before she turned again to Edlefina. “I think you’ve bothered the Gryffindors enough, don’t you, dear?” she said primly, her voice perfectly composed. “You’ve said what you meant, and now it’s best to leave things be.”
He was so distracted by this, he nearly missed the last and worst detail of Regulus’s notes.
Right. Because it wasn’t bad enough, being harassed by an overzealous grandmother. Something had to show up and make this day even less enjoyable. Something in a sleek black suit and robes that looked as if dust and lint had never dared go within five feet of it. In fact, they were probably charmed to do exactly that.
. He was clearly in the wrong.
Under his right hand, where his fingers had been absently moving, tracing along the table, a small circle stood out. Inside, there sat a patch of gleaming, freshly cleaned wood. Where the rest of the table was worn and scuffed, covered in the remnants of countless layers of ink and damage, the circle was clear, the wood under all of it a deep, dark reddish brown.
Malfoy had sat down and gone through the last records of someone he’d once spent nearly all his time with. Harry might have once thought Malfoy’s relationship with Crabbe and Goyle to be that of master and henchmen, but with what happened in the Room of Requirement, how unhinged and furious Goyle had been in the park as he beat Harry to death, he knew it had to have been more than it seemed. They must have been friends. Of a kind.
“There’s a place up north called the Ring Castle. It’s mostly political or non-lethal prisoners in there. Not as cruel as Azkaban.”
Still, that didn’t bother him nearly so much as who must have looked through these pages, who must have been called in to give his opinion…
“Use it for kindling for all I care. I’m done with it. I’m—done.”
“It is over,” Harry said quietly, heart calm for the first time in hours, maybe days. The song and the light dimmed, encased him and Voldemort in a calm little bubble outside of time. “This is it, Tom.”
would turn out to learn the one secret he never could, to achieve the one thing he’d wanted more than anything.
He looked back down at Malfoy’s now hidden ankle. He could understand requiring anyone under suspicion of allying with Voldemort to remain in the country, even putting them under house arrest. Surveilling them, bringing them into question—sure. He understood that. If they were dangerous, and they might hurt someone else, he could understand holding them somewhere safe.
I have to disagree. Why else would you invite me to testify in front of the full Wizengamot if you didn’t want me to honestly recount what happened to me and other Hogwarts students during the war?” He couldn’t help but look at Kingsley, finding an impassive, intent mask.
split apart your soul and take someone else’s life. You couldn’t
Harry rose when he heard Bill come back into the kitchen. He said nothing about what he’d heard as he sat in silence through dinner. He didn’t even know if there was anything he had to say. His brain seemed to have stalled, stuck on the image of that girl on the ground, eyes blank, just like Cedric’s had been.
Fucking hell. A year.
It was like his whole chest had been wrenched pleasantly around. It was the longest he’d gone without seeing Teddy since meeting him, and it was almost painful, the flaring of joy he felt.
Malfoy’s brow arched and he asked almost flippantly, “Was there something you wanted?”
Now that he had nothing to work toward, he could let the austere melancholy of it take him.
“Well,” Ron managed, his voice tight, “at least you finally admitted it.”
He had no idea where this room was in relation to the rest of the house, if it was sitting in a courtyard or maybe looked out over a back porch, but he could make out vague shapes through the warped grass. They looked like trees, but he didn’t know how that could be possible. Unless there was a full forest sprouting within the center of Grimmauld Place. Which, to be fair, didn’t sound particularly impossible anymore.
“My flat,” Harry said raggedly, voice small. “I had a flat in the building. I just bought it. Before the trials started.” He shook his head, chest constricting. “I hadn’t even told anyone yet. I didn’t think…”
He looked down, guilt and shame bubbling up inside him, murmured, “All right,” and quietly left.
“These trials sound like shite, honestly.” He threw back the rest of his ale.
“Don’t play dumb,” Ron snapped.
He took a deep breath, exhaled—and his mind went very quiet. He stared at the words, that impression of clean wind and lightness and relief from a great burden stirring under his nose. His fingers twitched again, like they were already mimicking the patterns he’d been practicing without any kind of intention, moving on the desk as he focused on the sheet. The words sat on the tip of his tongue, sounding them out in his mind like he was trying to remember a language he’d never learned. He saw again the tree in his mind—swaying in a sunny breeze, small cones dangling and jostling, clacking together softly amid the bright green leaves, the trunk splashed with faint white patches all along its length. It stood on a hill, one of—
He’d ripped his tie off the moment he got let out on the atrium, shrugged off his outer robes and sat down, and here he was nearly twenty minutes later. He checked his watch—the one Molly and Arthur had given him for his seventeenth which made him feel a bit sick with guilt—and exhaled slowly through his frustration. He still had thirty minutes until Bill was due to meet him.
The pressure on his throat vanished. Goyle’s body was no longer weighing him down. He breathed, panic and air filling his lungs as he coughed violently, blood coating his lips. His head swam and stuttered as he tried to sit up. It hurt. It hurt so badly he nearly blacked out. He turned, shaking, as his hip pulsed in protest.
Harry nodded, his own smile growing.
As a result, he wasn’t sleeping much.
In fact, the more Harry thought about it, the more appealing it sounded.
—but he ended up just sitting in Sirius’s old room, listening to records and thumbing through photo albums and ticket stubs, letters stuffed into the bottom of drawers. He found a whole chest of clothes hidden behind a false wall in his closet, band t-shirts and ratty jumpers and pants that had so many holes in them he struggled to think why Sirius hadn’t just chucked them. He stopped when he found a black leather jacket, running his thumb over the initials stitched into the collar—
“Sixteen.”
Harry’s brow lifted. “I didn’t know it was the oldest.”
“You look like a fucking ghost, mate.”
He straightened up and wiped away his tears, breathing shakily as he bent to the task.
Tension built in his chest, expanding through the back of his mind.
“Everything’s gonna be all right.” Bill murmured, squeezing, rubbing a comforting hand down his back. “Promise, Harry.”
Harry stared, his mouth hanging open. “But I…” He hesitated when he looked around the room and everyone else seemed unperturbed as well.
He’d watched the life vanish from Voldemort’s eyes. Stared down at his motionless face.
No one would help him kill Voldemort.
After a while, though, the anger faded and he studied Malfoy’s face. He sat on the other side of the Great Hall, so Harry couldn’t see his expression well, but he knew the typical sneer and haughty disdain which had sat so easily on Malfoy’s face for so many years was gone, absent—just as it had been every time Harry had seen him over the past year. He hadn’t seen Malfoy sneer since sixth year. Not since Harry had ripped him apart in the bathroom.
“If master wishes, he may start here. Kreacher is not being able to help much with the library, as Kreacher is not being able to read.”
Sorry for getting this one up later than I planned! Please take this long-ass chapter as my apologies. Also, Draco's in this one! I swear one day there'll be more than just actual tension between them.
Hermione pursed her lips. “He’ll have wormed his way out of it, of course. Claimed he was too young to know better.”
“I know. I’ll be fine. Just,” he sighed, hands shoved into his pockets, “don’t have the best memories of this place.”
He did as she said, because he didn’t think he could refuse anyone anything right now.
None of it reached him here in the shadowed nook. He’d set himself apart from all of that. But…had he ever really been
His head turned and his vision split like a mirror swinging toward his face.
He was just about to disapparate on the spot—when the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Gooseflesh prickled up over his arms and it was like his mind roared to life. His senses seemed to shift and heighten, his eyesight growing sharp, his ears suddenly hearing a full wealth of noise which had been inaudible only a moment before. The bark under his fingers was rigged and digging into his skin.
He’d never really seen the appeal of Hermione’s obsession with knowledge, but he started to understand—spend enough time in someone else’s head and you start to forget your own problems.
So when he woke to a new copy of the Quibbler sitting on his back porch, on the cover a somber, simple illustration of a girl sitting on a bench with her face hidden and a manacle on her ankle, he was relieved. He read through the article, surprised by the addition of an anonymous source from the Ministry itself which confirmed everything and lent support for Harry’s condemnation of the practice. He wondered who it was—if it was Arthur or Bill, maybe Percy felt bad enough to throw him a bone. He hadn’t seen Kingsley since the trials started, but he knew it would be too much to hope he’d read this and realize he was feeding into the same cycle they’d gone through during the war.
So. He’d done something approaching what he’d meant to do. Now he just had to do it to the rest of the house.
“Of course, Gawain.” Andromeda’s voice was cold and clipped. “You know you’re welcome here.”
Malfoy stepped back, sliding his foot out and hiking up his left trouser leg.
He’d certainly believed enough in Grindelwald’s vision of the world. Grindelwald, the boy he’d most likely loved, and who had, before Voldemort, been the single most destructive wizard to hit Europe in centuries. You didn’t just fall into love with someone like that. Not someone as clever as Dumbledore. Even as a teenager, he would have known Grindelwald was dangerous. Maybe that’s what he’d liked about him. Perfect Albus Dumbledore, head of his class, the brightest wizard of his age, destined for greatness and hungry for it after a childhood of poverty and disappointment and death.
It took him a moment to find his voice. Bill was being genuine, he knew, but he couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed. Maybe it was just the conversation he had overheard between him and Kingsley but Harry had to fight the urge to frown.
“Please,” Malfoy snapped, anger flaring, “shout it louder so everyone can hear, because there couldn’t possibly be anyone who might take issue with me cooperating with the people throwing them in
Bill’s expression tightened, but he was clearly trying to be a comfort. He pressed a hand to Harry’s shoulder and squeezed.
“What is it, exactly?”
The path leading through the park was empty, secluded in the very center where there was only grass and clutches of trees. He’d come here once when he was younger on a school trip and gotten lost, only to end up trailing around a small herd of deer. His teacher had gone mental, of course, and the Dursleys had locked him in his cupboard for nearly a week, letting him out only to use the toilet and drink from the faucet, shoving some bread and crushed crisp packets at him before kicking him back in. Thinking back, it was almost comical to realize how many little, impossible things had popped into his life before he understood what they meant. A doe in this park. A snake in that zoo. It was all so bloody clear.
to fight fucking Bellatrix Lestrange and
Ron looked like he was trying hard not to slam his fist into the wall. Or into Harry’s face. Ugliness seeped into the twist of his mouth. “And apparently my
Voldemort.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, as if he were actually considering the problem like he was about to help—
“I…” The room felt like it had just doubled in size and twisted to the left. “I have no idea.”
Tears still tracking down his face, Harry felt a strange, confusing sorrow. The thing which had bound him to this man was gone, or…he thought it was gone. He could no longer feel it, like he had come up for air after drowning his whole life, only to find the air cold and unwelcoming. Empty, when it should have been filled with relief.
, Potter. You ruined
I don’t want to, don’t make me,
With a steadiness he’d thought himself incapable of, Harry slid his hands into his pockets as he faced Hermione, and waited.
“Are you waiting for me to tell you how clever you are?”
“Harry?” Luna said, eyes wide and smiled even wider. “Why, hello, Harry! This is a wonderful surprise!”
He must have been doing a good job hiding it, though, because while Hermione and Ron kept hovering near him, they didn’t shared frightened, tense looks. They didn’t push him to explain. Hermione hugged him so fiercely he thought his ribs might crack and sobbed into his shoulder. Ron called him a stupid git for not saying anything but he cried too. To them, it was over. They didn’t ask why he’d gone to the forest on his own. Maybe they were too busy with their own grief to care. Maybe they didn’t want to know. Harry wasn’t sure he wanted them to know, either.
“When you’re feeling better, floo me. If it’s been more than three days and I still haven’t heard from you, I will find out where you’re staying and I will come myself.” She studied his face, something like fear tightening the fine lines around her eyes. “I mean it, Harry. I understand why you feel the need to leave and I won’t keep you here, but I—” She exhaled softly. “I’ll feel better if I know you’re healing properly.”
He couldn’t bring this kind of trouble to them as well, ruin their lives because more people wanted Harry dead. They didn’t deserve that. The war was over for them. He wouldn’t pull them back in just because Harry didn’t know how to exist in this post-war world. If he wasn’t allowed to have a normal life, he wasn’t going to take that from them too.
“The best?” Harry said sharply. “The
He looked around, suddenly registering the fact that he was lying in the middle of a park, hurt so bad he probably couldn’t walk—and there was a dead body in front of him. There was a dead body in front of him and he was—he’d almost—
“Okay, okay,” Bill said quietly. “Okay. I’m going to apparate you somewhere safe. I’ve done what I can but you need someone better than me to fix your hand, and I think…it feels like there might be something internal. If you need to go to St. Mungo’s, we’ll go, but right now I just need to get you out of here—”
does. It can’t be dispelled or countered, you see. You just have to get people away as fast as you can and minimize the damage.” She shot Robards a dark, haunted look. “By some miracle, though, the witch who cast the curse didn’t seem to understand what she was doing, because the moment I arrived, seconds after the complaint had come in, I saw her panic and try to stop.”
Arguments popped up in Harry’s mind, but they sounded weak even to him. At the time, he’d thought nothing of McGonagall sending all the Slytherins out. Of course they’d side with Voldemort. Pansy Parkinson hadn’t waited a minute before shouting for Harry to be handed over once Voldemort gave his ultimatum.
He looked away when Bill, frowning, caught his eye. He’d—mention it later. To Bill. If no one else had seen it, he might be imagining it. He’d slept maybe three hours a night the past two weeks. He’d just killed someone, had a breakdown that afternoon.
He was doing this. He was moving a dead body.
It didn’t make Harry feel better. It didn’t make him hate Malfoy any less.
Harry thought for a moment. “Don’t think so.”
anything.
The same age he was when Voldemort came back, when he watched Cedric get murdered. Had the other two—Geraldine White and Bradford Belmont—seen her go down? Had they watched her die?
Harry smiled grimly at the confusion in Malfoy’s eyes. He tossed the wand onto the ground at Malfoy’s feet. His mother tensed again but Malfoy didn’t flinch this time.
Bloody hell. Had it really only been three weeks? A life should have taken longer to fall apart.
This was wrong. It was wrong to make children responsible for a war they hadn’t chosen to fight in. It was wrong to treat children like soldiers, to punish them like criminals because of their parents’ actions.
Harry had never before wished he’d paid more attention in History of Magic. He sat there frozen for a while, wondering if there was something to the idea that the initial spell, this ancestor, had been far simpler than the one he’d heard about, the one Dumbledore had cast on his parents’ house and Grimmauld Place. He closed the book carefully and set it aside for later perusal. He’d thought about figuring out how to hide this place again after their disastrous escape from the Ministry last year. It was still unplottable and warded, presumably, but he didn’t know how thoroughly. Now that he seemed fated to live here, at least for now, it was something to look into.
A cry of fury ripped his calm apart. Harry was pulled forcibly back to the fight. Voldemort had seen him. He dropped back into the battle with a piercing regret and faced his last task.
“Thank you again, Andromeda,” Robards said quietly, his stoic expression creasing into something like a smile as he dipped his head. The imposing man turned back to Harry. He met Harry’s gaze with a frank sigh. “I realize we’ve gotten off on the wrong foot, Mr. Potter, but you should know that my offer stands, should you ever decide you want to become an auror. What you did in the Wizengamot was brave. Brash and explosive, but…” He trailed off, sharing a solemn look with Kingsley. “Well. I think we could all benefit from a little more courage. I know I could.”
“So you don’t bite your tongue off, mate,” Bill said with a tight smile. He was still unnaturally calm, but his hands shook slightly as he pressed Harry’s shoulders down gently. “Not pleasant to grow back, let me tell—”
“Yeah. They’ve got a cottage outside Tinworth, in Cornwall. It’s on the coast. Right next to the sea. It’s really beautiful, if you ever want to take Teddy on a holiday or something.”
Harry gently nudged Kreacher around, trying to stop another fit of crying before it began. “All right. I trust you.”
Then again, it was Luna, who was kind and probably not at all interested in Harry’s failure to please a woman sexually.
Bright green and white trees swayed in buttery sunlight, dappling the ground covered in leaves and flowers. He picked them as he went, his bare feet soft in the grass. The hum of bees and the distant chirping of birds made him smile. There was peace here. Cleansing and cool. He knew it was a dream—nothing could ever feel this simple in life—but it didn’t stop him exploring. The forest went on and on, he walked for hours.
“Wait!” Harry cried, but they were gone, so quickly he wondered if he hadn’t imagined them.
“…Is Master wanting Kreacher to keep his letters? Master is getting a few every day, and Kreacher is putting them in a box…”
The feeling in the room shifted slightly as a few people frowned. Yeats seemed to disregard her former dismissal as she said, “Mr. Potter, the witch and wizards being sentenced here today were of age when the Battle of Hogwarts took place.”
“Help
The golden light flared and soared upward to form a glittering, flashing dome. A cage around the two wizards connected by the same phoenix’s life force who no longer sat in their wands but lived inside them. Once again, he was alone with Voldemort. Once again, he was facing off against the man who had killed his parents, his friends, the people he loved. The man who wanted nothing more than Harry’s death. But this time Harry wasn’t fourteen and afraid. He wasn’t young and weak and desperate for help.
Malfoy’s jaw clenched, feathering the muscles of his gaunt face. His nostrils flared and his throat worked. A glassy, horrible light burned in his eyes as they held Harry’s.
Harry didn’t know why that mattered, but it did. It also made it impossible for Harry to look away.
the same people who would kill him, or worse, if they won. He did more to win this war than anyone in the Wizengamot, but because of who he is and what he was forced to do you’ve decided point the finger at him, the easiest person you could find. He was forced to take the dark mark at
Harry nodded.
“What? No, no of course—”
Goyle was going to kill him.
decent of you,” Harry said slowly. “That’s all I meant. I think you’re doing the right thing.”
It was the first thing Kreacher had hidden when Sirius came back to his old home. The first of many, it seemed.
Felicity nodded, her expression grim. “We normally don’t respond to random emergency calls—we’re trained to take down threats and neutralize attacks which could get out of hand quickly. Volatile dark wizards, riots, that sort of thing.”
Harry watched her face closely, but he saw nothing in her eyes. After a tense silence, he directed his attention toward Bill.
Be he didn’t. He wasn’t supposed to ask. He simply did was he was supposed to do.
trial, Minister?” Harry kept on, voice cracking as he shouted, the room throbbing along to the quick beat of his own heart. “Did they get to tell their story? You know I’ve been in this courtroom twice before. Dolores Umbridge used to sit up at that table. The same woman who forced me to carve words into my own hand to make me stop talking, to stop me telling the
“Hey,” Bill said softly, gripping Harry’s shoulder, “you’re just answering questions, right? That’s all it is.”
“Harry, are you—”
They looked different anyway, the skin around the circular marks taking on a darker, more yellowish hue than his normal light brown skin. The marks on his chest were newer, but the first was more like a burn, red and purple and warped a bit where Salazar Slytherin’s locket had burned into him. The other over his heart, from Voldemort’s second attempt in the forest, was just like the scar on his forehead, right down to the slight green tint it sometimes showed in the right light. Just like the scar on the palm of his hand.
“I don’t think anyone knows what Harry did that day. Albus might have. He told me what happened the night Voldemort returned but I don’t think it was anywhere near as powerful as what we saw. Albus said more than once that Harry was singularly equipped to fight Voldemort. Maybe this was what he was talking about.”
is the only person you’re talking to now.” He shook his head, desperation and pain in his eyes. “Seriously, Harry, this isn’t like you. You don’t hurt people just because you’re upset.”
for him was never the limit he thought it was. There was always something worse.
“They are, but sometimes they come together to make a tree. It’s how they make love.”
The unreality of it slammed down on him as he sat in the growing dark. Goyle had been wanted for his suspected murder of three muggles immediately following the Battle at Hogwarts. Unlike some of the other death eaters or students who’d fought with them, he’d fled. At the time Harry had thought it made no sense that Malfoy had stayed behind and Goyle had left without him.
“Ah, yes, and this is the part where you tell me how lucky I am you were there to rescue me. Like I couldn’t have saved
“Master should be having this, then,” he said quietly, holding out his hand as a shimmer of gold appeared in his palm.
He didn’t break it but he wanted to. Seemed like a petty thing to do. And even now, after everything, he couldn’t break it knowing what it meant to Dumbledore.
He took a deep breath and looked up to see the blurry outline of someone wearing a bright yellow dress with what might be feathers sticking out of her shoulders. He couldn’t be sure, because he didn’t have his glasses on, and he considered just keeping them off to save himself the coming conversation.
He went back when he knew his absence would be noticed. Sure enough, Molly pulled him into a tear-filled hug, berating him for wandering off on his own and praising him for saving everyone at the same time. Her grief was painful, like being dunked back into a cold pool. And the whole process started up again. Everyone wanted to touch him, to thank him, to tell him the names of their dead like confessing to a priest. Endless gratitude. Endless grief. The Weasley family enveloped him as they sat together and bore the shared weight of their loss.
“Good.”
“It’s all right.” Bill gave him a long look. “I just invited you out for drinks when this is done. Charlie’s in town for a few weeks and Ron and Hermione want to meet up at the Leaky Cauldron for supper.”
Malfoy’s head tilted and a flicker of his old cruel amusement lit in his eyes. “No,” he drawled, “of course not. Can’t have anyone else stealing a bit of the glory, can you? It’s the Chosen
He pressed his fingers to his scar, to the slight ridge of hard skin where the lightning bolt crossed his forehead, but it didn’t hurt. He kept very still for a full minute, counting the seconds, waiting for his mind to be dragged back into Voldemort’s head. But it was just him. Standing in the ruins of the Astronomy Tower. Alone.
Just wanted to pop in here first to say there's a lot of semi-graphic violence in this chapter, but I don't intend for this fic to be chalk full of these kinds of chapters, so if this isn't your thing don't worry <3
Where’s Dolores Umbridge now? In the cell next to Geraldine or Bradford? Does that seem fitting to you? How many people in this room sat in these very same seats and watched that woman silence anyone with even a shred of muggle blood? How many of you told yourselves it wasn’t your fight, that it was fine because it wasn’t happening to you, because it was easier for you to do
Andromeda held his gaze for a moment longer, and Harry saw with a stab of pain that was entirely emotional that her dark eyes were also shiny with tears.
All throughout May he gave statements to Ministry officials filling them in on what he and Ron and Hermione had been doing—the bare details, mind, just enough to make them stop asking questions—shuffled from one place to the next, trying to figure out how someone existed as a normal person again after so long on the run. He was so numb he didn’t mind so much that he frequently forgot what day it was or where he would spent the night. The pieces of his life had been so thoroughly shattered and scattered, he was left with the simple task of putting himself back together into some semblance of a functioning human being.
Bill rolled his eyes. “Stop reading gossip mags. You’re as bad as Mum.”
Harry remembered hinkypunks from third year, of Remus animatedly telling them how to avoid them.
He’d just killed someone’d he’d gone to school with and he was worried about whether or not he fancied blokes? The fuck was wrong with him?
Ron was staring at Harry like he was speaking a different language. “I still don’t see the problem.”
The language was still entirely illegible, but there were symbols on most of the pages, lines around them which looked almost like diagrams. They didn’t look like wand movements, but for a book this old, which it had to be, he could almost feel the age, there might not be wand movements anyway. Most Wizarding cultures had only adopted wands in the last few centuries, and there were still parts of the world where wizards didn’t use them at all.
Harry’s grip loosened on the third impact.
Harry ran, pushing back, trying to find the source of the voice. He had to find the voice, a different voice than one he’d heard plead with him when he was trapped in a cave with dead all around him, but it was just as urgent, just as horrible to hear it now, like this, because he
“And screaming at Hermione in front of the whole bleeding Ministry? Screaming at
And it wasn’t as if Ginny asked him to stay. She had never asked him for anything, really. Maybe that was why he needed to leave. Because out of all the things he had abandoned in his search for the horcruxes, all the things which seemed to be lost for good, his feelings for her, his
Harry thought for a moment the woman might start shrieking at him, but she merely drew herself up and huffed.
“Do you have any opinion on the severity of the sentence handed out to your classmates, Ms. Granger?” the new Head of Magical Law Enforcement, Prunellia Yeats, asked in a ringing, glass-clear voice. “Understand this won’t have any effect on the sentencing, but I believe the court would value your opinion.”
Harry stared at his godson for a long time, a looming sense of consequence crowding around him.
Alarmed now, Harry reached out tentatively. “Kreacher? Kreacher, can you hear me?”
Maybe his wand wasn’t so whole after all. He shook his head, unable to stop a pained smile.
Then he remembered. He’d nearly killed himself with blood magic. Right.
Harry waved his wand at the light on the wall, lighting up the hallway so they weren’t just talking in the dark.
The problem was, after that, he had nothing else to do. He stood around for a few minutes in silence, his awareness of the empty house growing taut. He could try to find a book to read? Desperate times…
Kreacher looked for a moment like he was going to argue the point. Harry almost wanted him to for the novelty of it. But he seemed mollified. For now. “Is there anything master is wishing to be eating for lunches and dinners now that he is awake and feeling better?”
Harry nodded, knowing already a few people who might come up first. Sure enough—
He swallowed tightly. “Yes. No. Sorry.”
Harry dreamed they were together in the Room of Requirement, staring out over the mountains of lost things, forgotten secrets. Abandoned and alone, they were just two more vagrant souls thrown into the uncaring mass.
“You didn’t have to give Xenophilius Lovegood, of all the ludicrous—of all the people you could have spoken to, an exclusive. And you didn’t so much as mention this to me! How do you think I felt, reading this this morning? How do you think
“Oi,” Harry said harshly, anger flaring up past his fatigue. “Don’t talk about him like that.”
He’d thought he’d known her. Or maybe his transition from a teenager fighting a war to this…exposed nerve of a person he was now had changed everything, a divide expanding between him and them, making it nearly impossible for either to bridge, making them strangers. Maybe that’s why Ron had avoided him all summer, why Ginny’d been so upset when things fell apart, why Bill was always there to check in on him, to watch over him when everyone else kept their distance. Maybe everyone else had changed, moved on, and he’d been stuck behind. And they all knew it.
Harry’s whole body went cold. Ravenna Lamar. He had heard that name before…and fourteen? She must have been a student at Hogwarts but he couldn’t…
They were all from Slytherin, now he thought about it. Geraldine White—Gobstones Club, wasn’t it? And Ravenna Lamar had been serving detention once when Harry had tried to corner Slughorn about the horcruxes. Short brown hair with big eyes, freckled.
“Did you know about the mandatory check-ins for Slytherin kids?”
He took them from Robards, thankful for his downcast gaze. Robards might be stiff, but he seemed kind.
“Er, no? I did spend a month with Bill and Fleur down in Cornwall, and that’s pretty close.” He hesitated, wondering if he shouldn’t chance asking. “Why?”
“I know no one named Patrick.”
too much, but he could do it. By the end, he wasn’t even trying to, but it was still happening. He shouldn’t have been able to possess him in the first place, if Harry wasn’t… If Harry hadn’t…
“Yeah.”
“I won’t, Bill,” Harry repeated, slowly. “I’m not letting anyone else—”
reason, the goblins didn’t want everyone to know that a few teenagers were able to infiltrate one of their most secure vaults, only to break out on what was their oldest dragon.”
“Well you grew up in the suburbs. They only live near the roots of the cornflower trees.”
Another brush of…something…at the back of his head.
Harry paused in taking his drink. “Aren’t your parents back? You said they were fine.”
He wondered what Dumbledore would have wanted him to do. He wondered if Dumbledore would care.
Her dark eyes were nearly obscured in the darkness of the room, the only light a small slice coming in from the hall, but as she held his face he knew she was crying too.
kill someone. What happened to Goyle wasn’t a fucking accident. Harry had killed him. He didn’t know how, and he hadn’t meant to, but it wasn’t an
why he was here.
He moved fast, too fast for Harry to follow. A flick of his arm—and a wand slid from Malfoy’s sleeve. He gripped it in his long, pale fingers, knuckles standing out white. He wrenched back from Voldemort as if propelled by an invisible force. Before Malfoy opened his mouth, a look of pure and unadulterated hatred twisted his fine, pointed features into a snarl. He leveled his wand directly at Voldemort’s chest.
The ever-burning lamp cast a pale, flickering blue light over the pages. As if he were underwater, far, far beneath the surface of a dark lake. And there were dead here, too, just like those who still waited in the cavern where Regulus had met his end. There were specters in the books all around him, on the pages in front of him. Memories of people who were long gone, whose names were forgotten. But he wasn’t home here among them. He was something else. Something that shouldn’t exist.
Harry gestured to his wand sitting on the table, nestled between full cups of cold tea and the crumbs of a discarded biscuit. “Of course.”
The only family Goyle had left was an aunt who wanted nothing to do with him.
A tightness settled into Malfoy’s face, a remoteness. Harry felt an echo of that weird desperation he’d felt in the aftermath of the Battle for Hogwarts, like he needed Malfoy to be angry and cross, like he needed the world to go back to the way it used to be when they were two people on opposite sides of a war that hadn’t yet started. When it was easier to remember who he was supposed to hate.
He couldn’t help it. He laughed. “I’ll get right on—”
Harry didn’t reach for his own wand. Maybe he was too surprised.
she murmured. Her hands were remarkably steady and the magic that washed into him was soft and warm.
Bill wasn’t bothering to hide his frustration and misgivings, but he looked resigned. “Were you planning on apparating to—”
“I meant—I have nothing to do and I can’t leave for a few days. Is there anything I can, I don’t know, organize? I don’t want to clean anything out or throw it away,” he added when Kreacher’s face twitched, “I swear. I just need something to keep me busy. I can polish dishes, if you like.” He softened his voice, bending down to pat Kreacher on the shoulder. “I just want to help. That’s all.”
“Percy,” Harry said firmly, not sure if he was moved or just embarrassed, “it’s all right. We all make mistakes. People can change, can’t they? And you did it all on your own, so you don’t have to apologize to me. Only thing we can do is try to learn from our mistakes so we don’t make them again.”
Apparently, he wasn’t doing a good job of pretending either. The moment Bill left to get another round, Charlie gave him a sympathetic smile. “I hope you’re not here for my sake. I promise I won’t be offended if you bail.”
Harry hadn’t balked. He’d gotten angry, sure, shouted a bit, destroyed a few of Dumbledore’s trinkets, but it only took a few minutes after hearing the prophecy for Harry to accept his role in all of this. And he hadn’t felt much of anything when he learned where Dumbledore had led him. He’d swallowed whatever objections a healthy, happy person might make at learning the only way to finish it was to die, and he’d walked into the forest. He hadn’t even considered an alternative.
As if in answer to his thought, Hermione’s voice cut over the crowd to his left.
The silence in the remnants of the entrance hall rang with all these branching choices, a web of glittering threads resonating and winking at him where the path shone clear. The waiting, hopeful eyes of his loved ones sat heavy on him. The ghosts of the people he had lost tonight and every other night since he was a baby crowded near.
“Mr. Potter,” Yeats said loudly, her composure breaking, “you will be found in contempt—”
It would be over. For good. He could move on.
Better to just stop thinking about it, really, because he’d been through a lot recently, and he was allowed a few moments of lunacy. He’d earned them, with the kind of life he’d lived.
Robards said, “I’ve already informed the Minister, and he’s elected to allow me to conduct this investigation in secret, for now.”
“I only have a handful of aurors working on this. Might take a while to make sure you’re out of the woods.”
Ron just blinked at him incredulously, but Hermione frowned and said, “No. He was putting you on.”
All at once his mind grabbed for something, tightness and heat building until his legs were trembling and his toes were curling. The motion of his hand became detached from the feeling. The water insulated him and a heady, strange disconnect brought everything into focus, like he was imagining someone else’s hand in its place. Someone else jerking him off like this. He bit his lip, closed his eyes. He was close.
Chest rising and falling, fingers trembling, Harry simply stared at Tom as he lifted Harry’s wrist, splayed his bone-white fingers along the back of Harry’s hand until they were lined up with his, his thumb resting across the veins beneath Harry’s palm—the palm with the lightning scar.
empty than it should have been. The walls were higher, the floor a bit wider, and where there had been a tattered and faded runner of indeterminate color, there was just wood floor—rich and buttery and gleaming like it’d just been freshly polished.
Bill just grinned and winked, the effect somewhat lost in the scarring over his right cheek.
Harry found himself sitting down at a table covered in food fifteen minutes later, leveled by Kreacher’s baleful, expectant gaze. Andromeda had sent over a letter with Bill. Her status as a Black, even one considered to be a blood traitor, gave her more than enough influence to get Kreacher to do what she wanted. Harry could order him not to, of course, but he didn’t have the heart. Plus, the food looked every bit as good as what he’d been treated to at Hogwarts. Better even, because now that Kreacher was exercising his full skills and talents, it turned out he was more than capable of providing feasts fit for kings—or highly discerning racists who liked to scream at people who dared intrude on their home. Same thing, really.
He was staring so intently at the cover his eyes started watering before he realized he hadn’t blinked.
He probably wouldn’t even come back, now. Harry thought he’d done enough damage to possibly crack that bridge for good.
“I know,” Harry sighed, leaning back in his chair, “I know, and I’m grateful, really, but you can’t expect me to eat all this. This is enough for ten people. It’s amazing, really, I’m—this is beyond what I’d ever ask of you, but I can’t eat anymore. I’ll get sick.”
The notes began rather like a school paper, a record of his musings as to what Voldemort was up to. Apparently, Regulus had gleaned a lot about Voldemort’s comings and goings on his own, his travels, his penchant for experimentation. Harry had to stop a few times. The callous, cold words about killing and maiming and performing dark arts made him want to pitch the lot of it into the fire. After a while, though, he thought he could sense a forced quality to them, as if Regulus were trying to play at being the good little death eater, trying to see the worth in what Voldemort was doing, and near the end, trying to convince himself.
Robards leveled him with a hard glare. “As you’ve no interest in Ministry protection, I’m not inclined to share details of our investigation until it’s concluded. We’ve handled it.”
The idea of doing the same for people Harry knew, for Gryffindors, was… He couldn’t imagine needing to sit down across from someone he knew personally and try to convince them that no matter what they’d gone through, how much they’d lost, they couldn’t fight. He couldn’t imagine being called in to look through the last notes of Hermione or Ron, trying to figure out what’d gone wrong and when, without even getting an answer as to who…
“Draco Malfoy saved my life
Harry gave his new plant another wary look. It seemed perfectly content to remain here, snuggled up in its pot like it was a dog in a blanket. His hands were oddly tight and itchy, the remnants of the magic he’d used to cleanse the plant lingering in the lines of his palm and under his nails.
“Of course not. She just came home and burst into tears and blamed herself and told me you wanted nothing to do with her and I, that you picked a fight with Kingsley over
within ten feet of Malfoy made the languid sludge of his emotions surge back into life. “You worked it out. Bully for you. I don’t care.”
“Sorry, Teds,” he whispered, voice choked.
A fog covered his senses as he swam up from what felt like a deep, horrendously dark pool. Watery sounds rushed around him, muted and echoed. There was something around his ankle—a hand, a manacle? A voice, low and lovely and unnerving whispered into his ear. A dull, aching sense of approaching consciousness swelled but he didn’t want to go back, he wanted to stay down in the water—and then he woke up.
Harry closed his mouth with a snap, blinking furiously.
He leaned forward and braced himself against the shower frame, bringing himself off slowly, almost leisurely. Indulging in a way he really hadn’t thought he’d needed to, before. Images flicked through his mind—guilt following after immediately because thinking about Ginny now felt weird. He frowned in frustration and just let his mind drift, hand moving with more intent as he reached below and brushed his balls, exhaling sharply as he tugged, rolling back his foreskin. For a while he didn’t think of anything in particular. He just let himself feel. And
wand—digging into the small of his back where it stuck out from his pocket. If he could get away from Hagrid, he could put on the cloak and get clear. Maybe he could draw Voldemort off…
“Was there something you wanted?” Hermione said coldly.
“You also wore someone else’s face, to be fair.”
Why he should have that information so readily available only Merlin knew but he did.
And perhaps worst of all, Malfoy had let Harry take his wand. He must have. The realization had come on slowly as his mind processed—there was no way Harry had overpowered him in his house. You didn’t learn how to duel like
Malfoy reluctantly looked away from Harry, and nodded. “Bill.”
“G-Goyle,” Harry managed. “Gregory Goyle. Kid from—”
Should he go to the Ministry? Could he even get up and walk, in this state? He wouldn’t be able to apparate. He wouldn’t even be able to heal himself.
“I just intervened on your behalf. You should be thanking me.”
The beach again. Waiting for someone.
“Wasn’t Voldemort sixteen when he murdered his father’s family?” Hermione asked.
He frowned, checking his appearance in the mirror of a bathroom which had only appeared two days ago on the ground floor—he was averaging two or three new rooms a day, which was both disconcerting and strangely comforting. Grimmauld Place didn’t know who it was supposed to be either.
“Right. So. You want me to use this bathroom?” he asked, feeling like the world’s biggest prat for thinking his
like that without work.
Harry extracted a piece of his hair from Teddy’s mouth, more as something to do than an actual deterrent. If the kid wanted to eat his hair, he was going to eat his hair. And it wasn’t like Harry couldn’t stand to lose a few inches anyway.
I don’t care—” The door lit up with purple light, followed by a sharp yelp of pain from the other side. Ron was actually trying to break in. His muffled voice shouted in frustration. “Let me in! Come
All that talk of love and purity, of Harry’s innate
Harry fought the urge to loosen his tie, wishing he had just ditched the whole thing and worn a bloody t-shirt. “I was was there, yeah, in the Astronomy Tower. I saw it.”
It was nicer. Harry couldn’t deny that. But he also couldn’t deny that without the shroud of darkness this house had lived under for lifetimes, without the ominous presence—it felt more like a house. Just a house. A house who still seemed to be perfectly capable of some degree of sentience, but it was still unfamiliar. At least the house in which Sirius had lived and died a little every day until his true, final death had held something of those he’d lost. Like the two-way mirror. Even shattered, it reminded him of Sirius. It might have been broken but there were still traces of his godfather in the cracks.
“You’re just a
It wasn’t that Harry had forgotten about the trials, but they seemed so far away now. They seemed to have happened to a different person, one who hadn’t killed a classmate and found out he’d been dead the past seventeen years.
Because he wasn’t one more mourner. He was still Harry Potter. People still looked at him like he was their savior. He had hoped it would stop once Voldemort died but the divide remained. If anything it felt worse now.
“I know you… I understand. You don’t have to apologize for not…” She sat up, pulling her clothes on to hide her face. When she finally stood and looked at him, her face was set and she looked almost defiant as she met his gaze. She looked older and more confident and he wondered then if maybe that was the trick, maybe he was stuck thinking of her as younger and softer…
Their laugh gusted out into the air. Harry nearly reached out for it, wanting to hold it and listen to it again and again. It was so soft, surprised. Like a white feather.
“Maybe. I don’t know.” Harry closed his eyes. “I’m not exactly popular with a lot of people these days.”
“Excuse me, are you Harry Potter?”
“Yes, yes,” the woman began digging in her bag, which was the exact same color as her lipstick, “of course!”
Thinking back now, he wondered how much of the purge had been them making the house safe and how much had been Sirius trying to burn away the memory of his family.
He rubbed his eyes from under his glasses, scowling at the throbbing of his brain. He didn’t have a headache, exactly, but he felt wrung out and fuzzy and a bit nauseous even after the food.
Harry frowned. “No. Why?”
He left without looking at any of them, not caring if they followed. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Charlie get to his feet and walk toward him in alarm, but he seemed to think better of trying to stop Harry.
Harry sat there for a full minute, waiting.
The dream fractured, a crack in a mirror that split Harry’s mind in two and vanished the drugged-out bliss of the moment before.
“Me too, sweetie,” she said with a raspy laugh. “You can relax a bit. You’re not on trial here.”
He took a deep breath. Waited. Blew it out. His hearing came back slowly, the tension leaking out of him into the air like a toxin.
But how many times had heard about the cruelty of Slytherin House before he even got to Hogwarts? Hagrid, Ron, they’d both come right out and said that Slytherins were evil, no question. Getting to know Malfoy and his goons had only confirmed this, and Snape had set out to make his life hell the moment he walked in the door. The rivalry, the antagonism—his first year at Hogwarts had been framed by it, and every year since. Slytherin versus the rest of the school, the rest of the world.
“Exactly! What’s the point?” Harry asked. “I mean, if anything kids need to see Hogwarts how it used to be, before Voldemort. They need to know Hogwarts is still there for them, that it wasn’t lost to the war. Shutting it down for a year will make it that much harder for everyone who does go back.”
He wondered if Andromeda knew…but she must have found out. Surely someone had told her. Probably the same day she learned Tonks and Remus had died.
“I can’t risk them getting hurt,” Harry whispered, wincing at the sounds of Teddy eating in the kitchen, the clatter of his spoon and the squeak of his high chair. “If…anyone else is involved, they’ll go to Grimmauld Place first. Assuming they know about it. But it wouldn’t be too hard to trace me back here, if they had a reason to go looking. I’ve already… I won’t put them in danger, Bill.”
“My grandson speaks so highly of you, I’m positively chuffed to meet you.”
“Unless you can think of a reason besides revenge,” Kingsley said quietly, “I think we might need to accept that there
Harry?”
Another tense silence passed. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if the entire room had had a Statuary Jinx placed on it.
“You want my wand? Or did you want to disarm me yourself? Maybe you should go out there and ask those aurors to come in and take care of me, strap me down and figure out what’s wrong with me, because there has to be something wrong with me, right? I can’t just
“Yeah. No, I mean… I’ve thought about it.”
Another voice, pulled up from some well buried deep in the heart of his mind, said,
The trees grew wider, darker, their fragile white bark gnarled and creased with age. Sap dripped down from their knots like blood and he could taste it on his tongue—sweet and heady and sharp with rust. The whole forest was dying. It was always dying, decaying, breaking, burning, raging against the end of all things.
But it was just a memory. He was fine.
Robards sighed. “Gregory Goyle has no surviving immediate family. His mother—we think his mother took her own life shortly after the end of the war. We were able to notify his aunt in Germany of his death, but they weren’t close.” A pause. “She was satisfied with the results of the investigation, and will not be seeking any further answers.”
“Well. I’ve got to be going. I’m sure I’ll see you again this week, and if you need anything, Harry, don’t hesitate to ask.”
Malfoy had stopped a few feet away from Voldemort. His gaze, dark and shadowed, seemed fixed on the ground. His expression was blank and dead. He held himself in a permanent cringe as if bracing for an attack.
told you? Since when do you listen to
Kingsley’s voice pulled him back out of his fog. He frowned.
It might have taken only a few minutes or an hour to find them all and to grasp them, but Harry kept on until every single bead was connected to the tip of his wand. He felt them all hanging there waiting, a brilliant, refracted mosaic of white light.
Harry found himself mimicking the finger poses absently, trying to contort them into something resembling the diagrams. It was hard, as it seemed like he kept hitting a wall where his fingers would not move like he wanted them to, and the diagrams grew impossible to read. Really, some of them looked downright impossible unless he was supposed to detach them and move them that way.
Harry watched, transfixed, as Tom Riddle kissed the inside of his wrist. The contact made Harry’s eyelids flutter as a heady wave washed over him. It was nothing, barely a whisper, but it vanished any more doubt from his mind. He wanted this, wanted
“Where was
“He’s—” Harry stopped himself from calling Malfoy a cruel, stupid ferret. Somehow, he didn’t think it would be appreciated. “We never got on. I don’t have the best opinion of him. But I do think he was reluctant, maybe even forced to follow Voldemort against his will, by the end. I know—” He exhaled and adjusted his glasses. “When Voldemort had taken over his home and he didn’t go back to school, I know he was forced to do things, terrible things, against his will.”
Another five heartbeats of silence.
does he seem to be the only person you’re talking to right now?”
He wouldn’t be surprised if they brought him in for something. A firm scolding, maybe, or some kind of public rejection of what he’d done. They had to see that getting the Famous Harry Potter to sign on to their agenda at this point was laughable. They’d probably just want him to go away, stay quiet, so they could move on.
Bill’s warm hand closed over Harry’s knee. “You can’t do it all on your own, Harry,” he said quietly. “Not even you.”
If you want to be like this, don’t be surprised when you decide you’re done destroying yourself if you’ve got no one left! You want to be alone? Fine by me!”
Maybe Andromeda would let him stay with her and Teddy. If she didn’t think he was mad as well.
The full gravity of his choice slammed down around Harry.
“They’re not just rounding kids up at random, Harry.” Something cold slipped into her eyes as she frowned. “Ron’s right. All of them are Slytherins, all of them are from families who were fine with letting people like me get killed. It’s not the same. You know it’s not.”
Malfoy’s nostrils flared. He looked like he was trying to control his temper. Which was, frankly, confusing, seeing as how he’d never bothered before. Quite the opposite. He muttered, “You understand nothing, Potter.”
There was something…bright about them. The small fluctuations in finger movements staccato and slight, like a bird flitting around the diagrams. By the time he got to the end of the book, his hands were cramping up and there was a throbbing between his shoulders from his hunched position. But he couldn’t stop. He felt like there was
More tears built behind his eyelids. His fingers dug into lean muscle under fine cloth as he framed the shape of this person, this visitor, fit his hands over ribs which were heaving. He found an elegant neck and a chest that tapered smoothly into a firm waist. He smelled deep, warm spice and dark berries like wine and it was all he could do not to press forward and bury his face in it, in
“You’ll be checking in with me twice a day,” Bill said giving Harry a look of bare frustration, “so I’ll be more than happen to pass that along. If you like,” he added to Robards.
Harry blinked a few times, moisture swimming in them, then nodded.
Well. He had a good reason to feel a bit of conflict when it came to Malfoy.
“Drowning in sugar, I know.” Her lips pursed in distaste as she went into the kitchen.
“Merlin’s beard, Harry
“Oh, yes, next to the second dining room.”
Or maybe the house was finally warming up to him. He didn’t know what to think if this was true, because while he didn’t hate the house anymore, it still didn’t feel like somewhere he’d chose to live for the rest of his life. This, crazily enough, made him feel a bit guilty.
Part of him wondered if Bill was right, but he knew Hermione and Ron would drop everything if he asked. Even after his fight with Hermione, he knew that. How many times had they done the same? How many times had they insisted on joining Harry even when he knew they’d be safer if they just kept away? Wasn’t that the reason he’d broken things off with Ginny in the first place, why he’d kept quiet about the horcruxes even when people he loved and respected tried to help? He’d sent Remus away for the same reason, refused to tell Bill or Molly or Arthur what he’d been planning.
The effort to remain standing became too much. Harry sat down hard, the dust and rubble kicking up around him like smoke. He tucked his knees into his chest and bent over, curled into as tight a ball as he could, and cried. And cried, wringing himself dry.
Harry should have been used to this by now. He’d never harbored any affection for Millicent or Goyle, he’d only ever seen them as adversaries if he thought about them at all. This shouldn’t be hitting him so hard. So many people had wanted him dead over the years. Why was this two too many? Why was this the question he couldn’t bear not to answer?
“Yes, obviously,” Hermione said at the same time Ron said, “You could have hexed him. That would have shut him up.”
us? We were KIDS!”
He didn’t know how, but he’d
He couldn’t walk around outside anymore—too many people were recognizing him now. His second day out, crossing through Piccadilly Square, a wizard had actually grabbed and stopped him and attempted to regale Harry about his own monumental efforts to stop the war. Harry had needed to shove him off or get hit by a muggle bus. He had even spotted someone who might have been hiding in the bushes outside his building. It had been fine when he was out with other people. Potential gawkers tended to leave him alone when he was with friends but for some reason every bloody witch and wizard in London seemed to want his autograph or their hand shaken or to tell him about someone they had lost in the war. After the first few days, the photographers had started showing up and stalking him and Harry had had quite enough of being photographed to last a lifetime. Whatever that meant when it came to him.
It was beautiful on the coast. The beach quiet and white and lonely but not in the way that made him sad. More like it filled him with an indescribable longing, the endless water and the soft susurration of the waves against the cliffs like a lullaby whose tune he couldn’t quite recall. He didn’t feel the need to pretend here, not like he had in the Burrow. He didn’t need to constantly present himself as being Okay and Fine.
“You know my mum’s been out of her mind worried about you, right?” Ron added. From the look on his face even he knew this was a low blow. “She’s been asking me all summer what’s wrong with you, why you fucking left the Burrow for Shell Cottage. She thought she’d done something to scare you off!”
The sun had only recently set so the dusk was still fading out as he followed the path down into a little patch of trees between two hills. The sky was soft purple and indigo, small traces of pink and red still hovering over the horizon. It was second nature to look around, the practice ingrained in him since he’d spent a year camping in various forests all across England. The absence of Hermione and Ron felt all the more potent as he stopped and leaned against the trunk of a huge, gnarled oak, letting his head fall back and his eyes close.
“YES!”
He wasn’t the same person he’d been in school, relying on his natural talent and ability to skate by. He’d worked hard, of course he had, but he’d never devoted himself to anything unless there was a concrete reason. He’d learned how to cast a patronus because he didn’t want to hear his mum’s dying scream in his head every time he looked at a dementor. He’d mastered
Voldemort seemed to catch the shift in Harry’s eyes. He had his wand up in a flash. Harry watched Voldemort’s lips as he mouthed
He walked quickly away down the length of the Great Hall and out the broken doors through the groups of people he’d saved and fought the urge to sprint. He didn’t know where he was going but he knew he needed to get out. Maybe he’d go find his old room in Gryffindor Tower. Maybe it had survived most of the—
only to get caught off guard when someone tried to knick your wand without using magic.
though…that was all Narcissa.
Finally, everything seemed to go quiet. He could hear his own shallow breathing joined by Andromeda’s, which was far heavier. He looked for her, and saw her forehead beaded with sweat and a drawn, tight look to her face.
for once.”
Harry could almost feel something building within him, something violent and raw—
“It’s wrong.”
Harry was crying when Teddy finally squirmed awake, his big brown eyes blinking slowly open until he saw Harry, and then he smiled.
there. Something which felt like Parseltongue, like an innate ability to do…
As Harry met his gaze, Kingsley’s eyes tightened long enough for Harry to see the guilt flash through them. To see the regret in those steady, unbeatable eyes.
“Where were they
It took a great deal of effort not to laugh out loud at this. “If you say so,” he finally ground out.
The silence around Harry shivered to a halt. For a moment there was utter nothing. The world shifted, like he’d been thrust onto a high-speed train while Harry remained motionless.
It’s not like Harry didn’t understand. He just didn’t like being reminded of the fact that his two best friends were in love and he was…decidedly not. He was thrilled for them. Really. He just wished he was better able to appreciate it.
Tall and handsome in his pristine Hogwarts uniform, black hair sleek and eyes intent. The pale young man’s mouth twitched, like he was about to smile, a playful glint to his black eyes.
Harry’s heart leapt into his throat.
It tread very close to what Dumbledore had believed about Harry’s power over Voldemort. How his love for the people in his life was what kept his soul whole. How it made him stronger, better than Voldemort, whose soul had been broken and splintered into different vessels and whom Dumbledore believed was incapable of love.
“Maybe it’s better we don’t know,” Kingsley said quietly. “Has he said anything—”
Harry stared at the scrap of parchment, feeling oddly bereft.
to,” she said waspishly. “I’m holding out for the day I find something that doesn’t taste like piss or nail polish remover. There’s got to be some reason everyone’s so obsessed.”
“What’s his problem?”
Yeah, he was going to count this as a win, even if he had no idea what he’d actually done to gain the house’s respect. Beggars, choosers, all that rot.
Tom Riddle was still there, leaning against the tree across the path, his smirk private and taunting. The nails of Harry’s left hand dug into his knee.
“It shouldn’t have been done in the first place!” He rubbed a hand over his chin, trying to control his anger. He lowered his voice. “Why would I think they’d react any differently than they have in the past? Why would I be that naive? And bugger their respect, I don’t want it if they’re willing to do this.”
would think. They’d be angry. Some might think he was betraying the people he’d fought for. They wouldn’t understand, but he didn’t blame them. People were still hurting and they wouldn’t want to hear about this, on top of everything else. He knew a lot of people he didn’t even know would get mad, but he couldn’t do nothing. And honestly? It was fine, if those people would just leave him alone. If the world could move on and stop bothering with him. If he could have a bit of peace and quiet to figure out what the fuck he was supposed to do with his life. The world could hate him for all he cared. Not like it’d make much of a difference.
So he lay down but didn’t try to sleep, staring up at the canopy of his bed with dry, gritty eyes. He couldn’t move. He just watched the light creep back through the crack in his curtains, forcing himself to breathe. To keep breathing.
An echoing, beautiful sound emerged from the tip of Harry’s wand. He had last heard it almost a year ago, soaring above the grounds on a warm spring night, the stars in the sky winking in sorrow down at the body of Albus Dumbledore where he lay spread out on the ground beneath the Astronomy Tower.
“No.” Kingsley’s tone went hard, causing the hair on the back of Harry’s neck to rise. “Believe me, when I find out who was using lethal spell-work in that firefight, I will put them behind bars myself. There was no reason to use a Killing Curse, I don’t care what that girl was doing.”
“What about the other kids?” he asked when it looked like Ron was going to interrupt him. “What about the eleven- and twelve-year-olds? Even the ones without parents who were death eaters have to come in.
He hated that it was a lie. He hated that he understood with perfect clarity exactly what Kingsley meant when he stood there looking like the weight of the world rested on his shoulders. He didn’t want to sympathize.
Malfoy hadn’t gotten on a lift with the other Slytherins. He must have hung around after Hermione dragged him into the bathroom. Wanted to see Famous Harry Potter fight with his friend, probably. Have a laugh after with his mates when he saw Harry had been crying.
Grimmauld Place didn’t scare him, not like it used to, but he could feel its outline, the skeleton of this house, caging him in. Even a lovely house could be a prison.
Fourteen.
A strange panic and helplessness rose up inside Harry, knowing with absolute conviction that this situation was wrong. A vital part of the world order had slipped out of place and everything had taken on a weird, unsettling filter. All of this was wrong.
“I’m coming in there one way or another even if I have to blast this
Feeling like an idiot, he contacted the woman who sold him the flat and made sure she wasn’t sharing his address with anyone. When she assured him that all of the other tenants were under the same magically binding contract which prohibited any of them from sharing any of their names or addresses, he felt slightly better.
Harry smiled before he could stop himself. “Okay.” He looked pleasantly at the old woman who was gawking at them with a growing anger. “So I do know Parker, then.”
He walked steadily through the mob as copies of the Quibbler were shoved into his face. Bulbs flashed, blinding him a few times. He shoved and maneuvered, finally needing to cast a Nudging Charm every few feet as he made his way down to the atrium. The press wasn’t allowed to cross into the Ministry proper—Kingsley had banned them from the proceedings entirely.

“Gotta say, he’s the most surprising thing to come out of the war.”
Goyle.
But I suppose you haven’t gotten enough of that hero worship, have you? Never enough for the Chosen One. Bloody savior of the world. You’re going to have to find another dark wizard to kill soon or they’re going to stop kissing the ground you walk on, because what else are you good for, really?”
The warmth he had always felt when he stayed at the Burrow seemed to dim every day. It didn’t feel like it used to. Safe and comforting. Like he had been given a gift he’d always wanted—a bright, warm house full of people who loved him, people he loved. Like he was living in the dream of someone else’s life.
Nothing about its contents or why Regulus had deemed it worth including with the others. Harry frowned, wondering if Regulus had known about this second book. If the attic had been this chaotic when he was here, probably not.
A way to be sure you couldn’t be disarmed…
Meanwhile he still looked like he’d been sleeping on the ground for eight months.
“I’d like a word,” Harry said quickly, catching the urge and holding on before he could think better of it. “Alone. If you can spare the time.” The last was petty, but Harry wasn’t exactly interested in being polite at the moment.
He had at least another week of this. The time off this summer should have prepared him, but he felt just as tired and anxious and unpredictably angry as he had the whole bloody year.
You’re not the only one with scars, Harry,” she said, voice choked. Her hand jerked, almost as if she was going to clutch at her forearm where Bellatrix had cut into her skin.
“I didn’t say she was happy about it.” Kingsley studied him, a crease forming in his brow. He was looking at Harry like he could see something just beneath the surface, as if Harry was so transparent. “Did you mean to kill Goyle?”
Harry’s throat burned, and he was unable to stop the small motions of his hips as he chased that feeling, that cold, clawing hand pressing ever more firmly against his lower back, caging him in place. He wanted to.
“I was younger than that the first time I fought him.” His voice came out hard, the words said before he realized what they must sound like. “He didn’t much care, funnily enough.”
He felt a little twist of frustration as Robards turned to Kingsley, as if yielding the floor.
Harry gritted his teeth as the pressure on his mind increased. A surge of magic rushed through him, the same kind of magic he’d felt when he’d killed Goyle. A searing white to cut through the black entity trembling and shifting, form splitting apart only to come together again, losing a bit more of itself every time.
It complicated things.
Harry’s eyes were burning and his temples were pounding and the thought of reaching toward Goyle and seeing if—if he was—
Harry frowned, discomfort rising in his throat.

“How many of you kept your heads down and worked your jobs every day knowing witches and wizards were being marched down here to have their wands taken and snapped and their identity stripped away until they were just names on a fucking registry? How many of you watched your colleagues disappear one by one, comfortable because there was always someone else lower on the list than you? I saw what the Ministry looked like under Voldemort’s rule and it wasn’t a battleground. It wasn’t a war zone. How long did it take the Ministry to fall when Voldemort made his move? A few hours, if that? You
The banging grew more urgent and Harry forced himself to hobble out of the attic and down to the house proper. As the banging grew louder, he wondered if the house had changed its mind about him, its good will toward him finally run out and it was attempting to collapse the whole thing on top of him.
Right now, though, all he felt was a little nervous.
he was so determined to be cooperative.

The house was trying. Harry could do at least as much.
And the worst part was he couldn’t
“Unsafe learning environment, my arse,” Harry spat, glaring down at the paper. “The castle was rebuilding itself before we even left. There’s no way it isn’t all fixed by now. And if McGonagall says it’s safe, it’s safe.” Real anger rippled through him for the first time in months. “I get letting kids stay home with their families if that’s what they want but to shut down the school?”
The whole bloody world was waiting for him to lose it, and he was starting to wonder why the fuck he was trying to pretend otherwise.
Flipping through the other books Regulus had collected, he saw some of the same theory popping up around the art of dueling and defense, of warding oneself against outside interference or attack. They were all old, at least five hundred years, so Harry assumed the school of thought had gone out of style. He couldn’t exactly deny that giving a bunch of eleven-year-olds the instruction to cut themselves and direct the magic in their blood might be somewhat jarring. Not to mention alarming to their parents. And it seemed like easy magic to get wrong if you didn’t do it confidently. Easy magic to abuse, too.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted. “If you don’t want it, why did you take it in—”
But there were still hundreds of people out there waiting to grab any piece of him they could snatch up and slap a headline on. -
Her eyes narrowed at him, and he had the uncanny feeling that she didn’t believe any of this. “How odd.”
“Sorry, I’m lost,” Bill said slowly, hand resting gently against Harry’s shoulder. “How does this—”

“You think this might have something to do with the Death Eaters? Retaliation?”
“Harry, you must not—” Hermione exhaled. “There must be more to the story. He was lying to you. He must have been.”
Harry turned back to Robards, whose expression had shuttered again to a remote and cool consideration. “I give you my word I’m not fleeing, or anything.” He hesitated.
Percy looked like he was trying hard not to say something stuffy, like Harry shouldn’t joke about getting sloshed while reporting to the Ministry about war crimes, but he kept quiet.
“I don’t have a stubborn bone in my body.”
Harry knew at once that something was wrong. This new place felt strange. Dreams always wiped clean your sense of doubt. You were where you needed to be because the dream put you there. You weren’t supposed to feel out of place. He had enough awareness, though, to recognize that it wasn’t the same feeling he’d had every time he dipped into Voldemort’s mind. He’d always felt like he belonged there, as horrible as it was.
Harry cleared his throat. “He was a git.” As if that made any difference. It still didn’t explain why he’d felt the urge to step in. Harry forced himself to meet Malfoy’s gaze, to not be even a little embarrassed. “Just because it’s
Bill was watching him with a tightness to his eyes. “It’s not forever, right? Hogwarts will open again.”

and none of it was her fault. But she probably guessed as much. She had always been smarter about this stuff than him, anyway. She was probably better off. She could find someone who loved her like he’d thought he could and she could be happy. With someone normal. Because after everything she’d been through, she deserved a normal life.

He was older than Cedric now. Older than Cedric would ever be.
Voldemort cried out, in defiance, or fear—Harry would never know.
running around killing and hexing innocent people.”
So now they didn’t want his opinion. Lucky for him, he had a lot of practice ignoring what the Ministry wanted.
Not the monster he was at the end, nor the unsettling child in the orphanage. He dreamt of Tom Riddle, the handsome schoolboy, with his devilish smile and glittering black eyes.
“And he did all of this to you in only a few seconds?” Robards asked, eyes hard as they remained fixed on Harry’s face. His quill continued to scribble in sharp, compact cursive. Harry’d given up trying to read what it said after a few seconds. He’d just have to hope that Robards was more dedicated to the truth than Rita Skeeter.
Harry blinked. The image shifted. Amidst the fire and smoke, over the popping of his own skin as it burned and sizzled, another form materialized, more slender, brighter. He saw grey eyes, wide with alarm and desperation, with
that if he’s cooperating, he’s genuinely cooperating. If it means protecting his parents, he’s not bluffing. He was never very good at it, anyway. If he didn’t want to work with you lot, he wouldn’t. He’d find a way out or he’d go to Azkaban. Assuming you’re not coercing him.”
Robards cleared his throat.
Harry forced himself to sit back and breathe out some of his tension. It helped that Teddy was trying to abandon ship and squirm to the floor, having sucked all the flavor from the leather jacket. “Okay, Teds, I hear you,” he muttered, setting Teddy down and letting him crawl across the rug, watching carefully in case he cracked his head on something.
Robards waited, but Harry kept his mouth shut, his jaw clenched tight against the chaos of thoughts battling it out in his own head.
Well, it had opened with his blood. Maybe it wasn’t so far fetched.
And there was a strange sense of urgency when he thought of marking the house, claiming it with his own blood. It felt…well, it felt rather stupid when he stopped to think about it. Stupid and troubling. If he’d heard of anyone else using blood magic to make their house more comfortable, he’d probably think they were dangerous and most definitely involved with the dark arts. That or they were just mental.
He’d managed to deflect Harry’s spells—probably because Harry was having a hard time focusing on anything except his own shock and the scarred flesh of Goyle’s face. He was shaking and he couldn’t get his bearings, slow to react and dragged down by flashes of a different day, a different fire—
Harry snorted.
“Really?”
“They are threatening kids,” Harry said steadily. “They are using teenagers as collateral to make sure their parents behave. Most of whom didn’t even fight during the war. How can you justify that?”
no greater motive here.”
Yeats was speaking and voices were raising around the room. From the corners of his eyes he saw figures gathering, darkness coalescing, but he didn’t care. If they wanted to arrest him, they could bloody well try. He’d welcome it, if only to break the feeling caging him in place, to shake him out of his furious paralysis. The pounding in his head rose and he felt his wand give off sparks where it was sitting on his hip and he wanted to blow this entire fucking building apart. He wanted to smash all of these sycophantic adults like Dumbledore’s glittering instruments and glass cabinets. He wanted to take all of them by the collars of their robes and shake them until they saw what they were doing. Until they fucking
Maybe it would have been better if Harry had died with his parents. He was a

“Harry,” Hermione said sharply, her eyes fixed on the table, “stop it. You know that’s not what Ron meant.”
A hand caught his wrist. Pale fingers tugged—
So he looked even worse than he felt. He didn’t know if that was good or bad. Luckily, he didn’t have the energy to care.
He was saved the trouble of responding when he turned and left without another word. Gawain Robards seemed like a decent man. In another world, he might even have wanted to work under him, to learn from someone like him.
“If you take issue with the laws in place in this country, I’m afraid this trial is not the place to—”
Most of the atrium was staring at them, though a few had the grace to look embarrassed or turn away when Harry noticed them. Of the Slytherin girls who moved as a group toward the lifts, only Millicent lagged, her eyes hard and angry, before she stalked after the others. Between them Harry thought he spotted Zabini as well. Were all of them here today, then?
And it was day
Goyle slammed into him. He was big, much bigger than Harry even if he was noticeably thinner, and Harry went down hard under Goyle’s bulk. They rolled back onto the path, Harry’s face scraping over the dirt and digging his glasses into his temple. His skin burned and the pain cleared his head.
Harry watched him in alarm, mind spinning off in a slew of confusing tangents—and then he saw the metal ring around Malfoy’s ankle. He stared for what felt like a long time, not understanding at first. Some part of him was trying to figure out why Malfoy was showing him his bare ankle, if it was some kind of power play or method of distraction, until it clicked. A chill sank into the pit of his stomach.
And if he started worrying about not doing things that risked his life, he’d probably have to legally change his name.
In between fevered scribblings on other sources he might consult, he had stopped to write out a short list of items Voldemort might have chosen to create his horcrux. Regulus hadn’t guessed that Voldemort might try to make more than one horcrux, the idea inconceivable even to Regulus, so his list was short. There was the locket and the diary, the latter of which had apparently been gifted to Regulus before Lucius Malfoy had taken ownership of it. A few more things Harry had never heard of—a selkie shroud which had belonged to Merope Gaunt’s mother, a pair of gold bands which had been a gift from Bellatrix. Regulus seemed to come to the same conclusion as Harry on these two—that Voldemort hadn’t cared about his grandmother or Bellatrix Lestrange. They were both meaningless to him. All he’d wanted was to prove he was better and more powerful than every other wizard alive. He wanted prestige and recognition. Not anything that reminded him he was just a sad little boy with no family, a man who refused to admit he was in any way weak like the people around him.
It didn’t help that Ron and Hermione had left after a few weeks. Ron was spending most of his time in London with George, helping get the shop back up, and Hermione had gone to retrieve her parents from Australia with the hope that she could restore the memories she had taken, and Harry was just…waiting. The war trials were due to start at the beginning of August. He had already been told to prepare himself for days of questioning and testimony but beyond that, he had no idea what to do. He had always wanted to be an auror but the idea of working at the Ministry right now felt about as stifling as the heat in Ron’s attic room. He didn’t know what he wanted, only that he wanted to move, and keep moving.
No, not on his own. With the
He looked up and met her gaze. Dark like Bellatrix where Narcissa had lighter, more grey eyes.
“Right. Thanks.”
I walk outside and I can’t go two paces without someone coming up to tell me about their dead gran or kid, or about all the horrible shite they heard about what happened to me, or asking me what it was like to
Kreacher shook his head with a watery smile. “Oh no, no, this plant is being a part of the house, Master, and the house is needing no water or light. It is only dying because of my Mistress, my Mistress…”
“Kreacher,” he said before he could think better of it, “do you—”
He leaned against the doorframe, closing his eyes and tamping down on the mingled relief and fresh, taunting pain.
Harry nearly flinched.
He was fighting to stay up but he no longer knew why. It was so nice. It felt so nice to be touched like this, like he was wanted, desperately. He was being wrapped in a warm, loving caress, pulling him down into the forest floor to sleep amongst the dead leaves. He belonged there. Just another dead thing buried by time and dirt.
Harry looked between them, then back down at his drink.
thing. You could trust him.
“I have to leave,” he murmured, his feet already pushing himself up from the couch. His legs protested and he winced, though most of his pain was still centered in his hand and chest. He wavered on a moment of vertigo, good hand reaching out for balance on the arm of the couch. “I can’t be here. Can’t—stay here. Not with—”
Harry smiled and shrugged. “It’s nice.”
He’d seen Millicent that morning. She’d glared at him from the group of Slytherin girls, tall and imposing and stone-faced. He’d given her five seconds of thought, maybe. How had he missed her intention to…
“I don’t see why not,” he said, “though I’m not sure you’ll find any answers in there. Our consultant was very thorough.”

a dream, not like how it used to be when Voldemort was still alive.
It was exhilarating as he continued to study the book. He felt, impossibly, like the more time he ran his fingers over the pages, the more time he casually attempted to replicate them himself, the more he could intuit the meanings held within.
Kingsley waited, his patience an eternal thing.
“Are there more rooms like this, Kreacher?”
This only made Harry want to do it more.
Harry cleared his throat, trying to wipe his face of tears. “Yeah, I’m awake.”
They weren’t as vivid or frightening as they used to be. Voldemort didn’t feature in them, not specifically, and he never woke up with his scar burning or to the sound of his mother screaming or a wall of green light. He never remembered the details, only the sense that something was watching him, or present. Something he couldn’t see. His own brain waiting for him to crack, most likely. Inventing danger. Seeing people who were dead. For good this time. He was visiting a strange liminal space in his mind every night and every morning he woke to a lingering sense of dread. Like he was leaving more and more of himself every time he fell into his dreams. It got harder to shake himself out of it, harder to get out of his own head, without Ron and Hermione to distract him, to help him.
