draco laughed. harry cleared his throat and fiddled with his hands, ignoring the way his heart tightened at the fact of draco laughing, kissing, smiling at someone that wasn’t him.
harry had won in the end by a close margin. the two boys ended up on the pitch, laying on the grass, watching the night sky and the stars. it was serene, calming in a way, to be laying on the grass with your ex arch-nemesis beside you. harry ignored the way his heart beat faster every time draco’s fingers brushed against his. “how’s it going anyway? the courting?” harry had asked, turning around to get a better look at draco.
harry had arrived a bit later, clearly panting. “sorry i’m late, bumped into some prefects on the way.” draco only smiled. they had agreed on a quick round of quidditch, first to get the snitch wins. it was exhilarating to be able to fly around with potter, watching the boy laugh as they darted around, trying to catch the snitch. it made draco’s heart swell seeing the other boy so happy.
“i guess i should’ve just told you the truth from the start. but better late than never, right?” harry heard draco take in a deep breath. harry didn’t realise he’d been holding his own. “i love you, potter. salazar, i love you so much. i like your mop of a hair... although i really think that if you just combed it...” harry glared at draco, which only made him chuckle. “...i like the way your eyes light up when you talk about quidditch, i like the way you bite on the tip of your quill and how your eyebrows knit together when you’re focused, i like the way your eyes sparkle every time you stare at the stars in the sky. i don’t mind begging the kitchen elves to make treacle tart so i can bring them to you just so i can see your face light up, and that’s coming a lot from a malfoy. i want to bring you to hogsmeade on dates and i really like seeing you in my scarf. although i think i’d prefer it more if i saw you in nothing at all.” this earned draco a slap on the chest from an
"Will the two of you dumb oafs let me go?" Draco shouted, trying to wriggle his way out from Blaise and Theo's iron-like grips. "This is the best for you, Draco! Please trust us," Pansy had pleaded, her eyes boring into Draco's. Draco raised an eyebrow in suspicion before sending a wandless stinging hex to Blaise and Theo, causing them to yelp in pain and let him go. He snatched the newspaper from Pansy's hands and let his eyes rake over the front page. He could hear Pansy protesting and Blaise sighing in defeat.
, Draco had to be good at it, had to be able to pick up what the other was feeling by a twitch in their expression, a raised eyebrow, lips curling. "It would prove useful when you grow up to work for the Ministry," his father had said. What a load of crap that was.
Draco can't bring himself to read the contents of the article, can't bring himself to read about how Harry- no,
Harry ignores the ache in his heart and the pitying look in Hermione’s eyes. She opens her mouth as if to say something then decides against it. Hermione cleared her throat.
“You do. Just the other day, you flooed over just to talk about how much of a git Malfoy was at work today. You went on and on about him.”
“draco, hi. i’m actually supposed to meet hermione but guessing that you’re here, i’ll leave. no big deal, really–“ draco squeezed onto harry’s wrist tighter. “i asked hermione to get you here. i need to talk to you, harry.”
harry frantically looked around for a place to hide but to no avail because draco had grabbed onto his arm before harry could even make a run for it.
Harry cleared his throat. “You know, I saw this thing once. The muggles do it. You throw a nut into the air and try to catch it in your mouth.” To demonstrate, Harry threw a nut into the air and tried to catch it, only for it to hit his nose and fall onto the floor. Malfoy snorted.
Harry turned around, glancing at the clock in panic. Sure enough, the clock striked 4 and the bet was over. “You know what that means, don’t you, Potter? You have to go on a date with me.”
It seemed like Malfoy had done everything in his power to make it the worst night Harry will ever have. First, they stopped at the Leaky Cauldron– much to Harry’s dismay. Malfoy had refused to floo over or apparate as well, so Harry had to
Ron threw his hands up in defence. “Well, obviously, I don’t like the idea of you liking Malfoy. Honestly, there are many other blokes out there, mate–
harry found it nice actually, finding out that draco had gone to about almost the entire hogwarts, apologising to everyone he had hurt whether it be physically or verbally. harry had been the last one on his list. in all honesty, harry found it quite endearing to see draco fumble on his words, a light tint of pink dusting his pale cheeks,
The two jumped apart, making Harry tip over and fall backwards over his chair. Robards appeared with two other Aurors behind him. “Found two Aurors to replace the both of you. Sorry to have wasted your time, gentlemen. You may go home.” Harry nodded as he scrambled to get up from the floor while Draco grabbed his things, a flush evident on both of their cheeks. “Thank you, Robards.” By the time Harry was done grabbing his own stuff, Draco had already fled from the rooftop.
Malfoy only grinned wider. “If you win, I’ll do your paperwork that you hate so much. For two months.”
“Say, want to wager a little bet, Potter? Whoever captures more dark wizards by the end of this month wins.”
hermione had to spend 5 minutes trying to break the two apart from a fight before being able to resolve draco’s issue.
quite a lot. draco cupped harry’s face in his hands and looked at him in the eye, clearly using his extra few inches to an advantage.
“i don’t think he’d appreciate me courting him the way a pureblood would. i don’t think he fancies me at all.”
“You,” Draco sighed. “You and I cannot be together, Harry. You’re the poster boy for everything good and I’m not. Can you imagine what would happen if word got out that we were dating?
. but he saw how excited draco had looked if the little bounce in the way the latter walked didn’t show it, and harry didn’t have the heart to say no.
“go to the astronomy tower tonight. i’ll get him to meet you there.” draco forced a smile– a genuine one– before thanking granger and scowling at weasley, earning him another middle finger.
. harry pushed back the tears. “sounds like a great guy and if he doesn’t see your worth, then he’s a bloody dumb git.”
“Now, Potter–“ Malfoy took out a ring, probably the tackiest ring Harry had ever seen in his entire life, and got down on one knee. Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. Malfoy’s eyes shined with mirth, a corner of his mouth quirked up in amusement. “Will you go on the worst date ever with me? You have to say yes.”
when harry heard footsteps, he had fully expected to see hermione. instead he saw platinum blonde hair and squeaked.
” draco rolled his eyes, slowly putting his arms around harry’s waist and pulling the boy closer. “seriously, i think i made it pretty obvious that it was you. you’re pretty clueless for someone who saved the wizarding world.”
Hermione twaddled out of the kitchen carrying Hugo, looking equally tired and amused at the scene that was playing out in front of her. “He’s right, Harry.”
Harry shrugged. “Just trying to make small talk. Is that not what purebloods are good at?” Draco smiled. “Mine is grey.” continued Harry.
Draco laughed, and Harry relished in the fact that he was lucky enough to hear it. He found himself wishing that he could always hear Draco’s laughter. Draco took a deep breath and Harry could feel him shaking and it terrified Harry, that maybe he had done something wrong, that maybe he was taking it too fast and that Draco just wasn’t comfortable yet–
the second time draco came to him, harry had already braced himself for it. hermione and ron certainly wasn’t any help when he told them about his inner conflict, the both of them only exchanging knowing glances before telling harry, “don’t worry.” harry had no idea what they had meant by that.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry outstretched his hand that was holding the bag of nuts and motioned at it with his head. “It’s low calories, if that’s your thing.” said Harry.
It's two years and three months into Draco and Harry's crumbling relationship when Harry finally leaves, and takes Draco's heart along with him.
” The office erupted into another round of cheers and laughter as Malfoy slipped the atrocious looking ring onto Harry’s finger. Harry tried his best to glare at Malfoy, but Malfoy only winked in return.
in his second year, when he didn't die by the hands of the Dark Lord while he was under the roof of Malfoy Manor, when he had been pulled and saved from the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, when Harry had testified for him during the Death Eater trials, when he was granted a much lighter sentence by the Wizengamot compared to the rest of the Death Eaters, when Harry had offered him an olive branch during their Eighth Year and shook his hand,
– until they stopped by Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour and Shacklebolt’s patronus had come prancing down towards them. “Sorry to cut off your date gentlemen, but I’m afraid I will be needing your assistance in a stakeout around your area.” he had said.
“i... i didn’t mean for it to get this way. really. i’m sorry if i hurt you.” harry shut his eyes tight.
Harry scoffs, raising his head from his desk to look at Malfoy. He was twirling his wand in his hand with a smug grin on his face. Harry swore he saw his eye twinkle.
Harry broke into the widest grin ever, his eyes crinkling. He was mildly aware of the fact that he must look crazy right now with how much he was smiling, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
As if sensing Harry’s confusion, Hermione continued. “Remember sixth year?” Ron nodded along in agreement. “You were obsessed with him, mate.”
Hermione turned to Ron, a pleading look in her eyes. Ron merely shrugged. “Look, mate.. I’m sure you can find someone better than Malfoy. Plenty of other fish in the sea. If you want, I could hex him for you. Or get Ginny to, she’s been really improving on her Bat-Bogey hex.” Harry kept his eyes down at his lap, fiddling with the hem of his shirt. As if on cue, Hugo’s cries could be heard from upstairs. Ron scrambled to get up, leaving Harry and Hermione alone downstairs.
“Are you going to keep staring into space or are you going to finish your paperwork any time soon? Maybe if you’re lucky, you could finish it before your hair goes grey.”
Another comfortable silence settled over the two again, the only audible sound being the howling wind as they sat over the rooftop. Harry could see Malfoy smiling in a certain way that made Harry’s heart beat a little faster than necessary. “Don’t you think we should start calling each other by our given names? We have been partners for a while.” asked Harry.
Malfoy laughed. “Don’t get so ahead of yourself, Potter. If you would be so kind to look up from your desk for a minute and look over to your right?” Malfoy quirked an eyebrow, taunting him.
), harry had to watch draco fall deeper in love with someone that wasn’t him. merlin, there was only so much one could handle.
draco took in a deep breath, peering around the hallway and seeing harry talk with his friends. “you sure this will work?” he asked, turning to blaise and pansy. blaise merely snorted and put a reassuring hand on draco’s shoulder. “what better way to court him than literally ask him
“It doesn’t matter. Who cares about what other people say? Everyone knows I can throw off an Imperius. I wouldn’t be with you if I didn’t want to!”
Harry was mad, angry. Seething was the word. Ron stood on one end of the couch, hands held up while Harry stood on the other, wand brandished at Ron.
Harry’s job used to be tolerable, likeable even. He’d go out onto the field, duel with some dark wizards, capture them and be patted on the back for doing another great job, yet again. It didn’t matter that Malfoy was the one beside him through it all instead of Ron, Harry loved the adrenaline. He liked the fast-paced nature of his job, he liked doing what he did best. Sure, some would call him weird for actually enjoying dueling dark wizards but defeating Voldemort at age 17 just does that to you.
Harry stood up, grabbed his wand and headed for the door. “I cannot believe the two of you! I can win this bet, I won’t get distracted and I will win it. It’s just a few more days until it ends anyway. I’ll show you!”
draco hated wandering around hogwarts at night. really, he hated it. there was just something so eerie about the place. but harry had suggested a week ago that he should indulge in something that his crush liked to show that he cared. and what better way than to ask harry to play a quick quidditch game with him? so here draco was, in his quidditch robes at the quidditch pit with his broom, waiting for the stupid green-eyed boy to arrive.
He screams and throws the newspaper to the other side of the room, his Dark Mark showing on his left forearm as if it's taunting him. His vision is blurring and his head is spinning and Draco is letting out heart-wrenching sobs as he feels his heart break even further. He's mad at the Weaslette, at Potter, at himself that he let it get this far. Mad at himself for falling in love with
Harry could see Draco gulp. “It seemed like a good idea at the time. Our kiss– whatever happened on that rooftop– it was a mistake, alright?”
Draco knows he's a lucky man, it's been proven to him countless times throughout his life; when his father didn't punish him after he found out Granger had surpassed him in studies yet
harry buried his head in draco’s chest, feeling his entire face grow hot. he could smell draco’s cologne and the faint scent of peppermint. harry found it intoxicating and found himself liking the smell of
but the stupid green-eyed boy with an absolute mess of a hair that made draco’s stomach turn and fill with butterflies.
Malfoy turned to face Harry, an alarmingly soft expression plastered on his face. “Do you not like being an Auror?”
Harry wouldn’t lie to himself. Malfoy did age well after the war and any person with two functioning eyes could see that the young Malfoy heir had obviously grown into his features. His face wasn’t as pointy as it was back in school anymore, his facial features filled out over the years and he no longer slicked back his hair with gel, instead letting it down freely. Harry noted that whenever Malfoy didn’t slick his hair back, his hair often curled into soft waves that framed his face really well. It would be much easier to keep hating Malfoy if he didn’t change his ways but he did. He had apologised to Harry after the war, thanking him for speaking at his trials. He’d donated to charities, gave money to the restoration of Hogwarts and tried his best to clear the Malfoy name. It took a while for the Auror office to stop giving dirty glances at Malfoy whenever he walked past but they slowly got over it and by the second year that Harry and Malfoy were partners, everyone seemed to warm up to him. Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy really was making a good name for himself and as much as he didn’t want to, Harry quite liked the new Malfoy.
draco smiled bashfully, looking down at his feet. “he’s a good guy. sometimes, i think i don’t deserve him. that i don’t deserve him and everything that he is because i’m me and he’s, well,
as softly as draco could say it, to the point that harry almost missed it if he wasn’t pressed up so close to the other boy, draco whispered. “do you still love me?”
“Harry! Nice robes!” said Seamus. They made their way over to the table and Harry glared at Ron which made Ron sheepishly glance at him and wiggle further into his seat. Malfoy had seated himself beside Harry, a bit too close as their knees occasionally bumped into each other. Harry hoped the dark atmosphere of the Leaky Cauldron could hide the blush threatening to show on his cheeks. They spent about an hour there talking and drinking and Harry actually had a good time, being able to catch up with his friends as Malfoy spoke with Zabini and Nott in hushed whispers until Malfoy had grabbed Harry by the arm, pulled him out of the booth and announced that they were leaving. Harry didn’t miss the small wink Zabini had given Malfoy, and the faint blush that spread on Malfoy’s cheeks.
harry whipped around, seeing draco walk up to him. “what’s that ferret coming over for?” ron had asked and hermione had smacked him lightly, before pulling ron away to give the two some privacy, not before sending harry a wink that certainly made him blush. “malfoy? what’s up?” harry noticed the faint blush on draco’s pale cheeks, the shy smile on his lips and heard draco’s question loud and clear.
. but i see him laughing with his friends sometimes, or when he smiles at me in the corridors or at classes, and i find myself wishing that i could see it every day of my life. he’s a mess honestly, literally, but i find it endearing. he’s an idiot though, constantly throwing himself at danger firsthand which makes me so worried i could throw up. but i want to be enough for him. i want to show him that i can make him happy if he’d let me.”
Maybe it was because Harry didn’t want just a quick shag. He wanted something real, something intimate. He wanted to be with someone who saw him as
Harry was snapped out of his daydream to find grey eyes looking right at him. A smirk was playing on Malfoy’s lips as he leaned back onto his chair. Harry’s cheeks reddened. “Shut up, Malfoy.”
" He hears the three of them sigh in defeat and the floo flaring to life with them disappearing into the green flames and finally, Draco lets himself fall to the ground on his knees and sobs.
It didn't come all at once, the signs. It started out small at first, so small Draco hadn't even noticed until it was too late. Harry would start coming home late with a different mumbled excuse time and time again, Harry would leave early in the morning even before Draco had woken up, Harry had started forgetting dates, anniversaries, he had stopped sneaking his arms around Draco's waist and nuzzle his face into the crook of Draco's neck as he brushed his teeth or poured himself a cup of tea. He had stopped snuggling up to Draco's sleeping body when he came home, instead opting to stay on his side of the bed, facing the wall instead of Draco. He had stopped eating breakfast with Draco, had stopped eating dinner, started working on weekends, going on long Auror raids, had stopped waiting up for Draco on nights he got caught up at St. Mungos, had stopped asking how his day was, had stopped ruffling Draco's hair in the way he knew Draco secretly loved, had stopped playing with the soft curls at the nape of Draco's neck, had stopped whispering soft "I love you"s into Draco's ear. The house he shared with Harry that was once vibrant and warm and lively stopped feeling like a home.
“That doesn’t mean you had to constantly stay up looking at your map and stalking his name, Harry. It looked pretty obsessive to me.” Ron shrugged.
It was nearing the end of the month and by the second day of Harry and Malfoy’s little bet, the entire Auror office found out. There was even a pool going around on who would win. Apparently, more people betted their galleons on Malfoy. Which was fine, really. Harry was used to people underestimating him his entire life and if the Aurors didn’t think Harry could outdo Malfoy then so be it. He’d show each and every one of them that he could.
, mad at himself for even thinking that he deserved Potter, who was kind and soft and all things good, everything Draco was not. Draco was mad that he still loved him, that bastard. That even after everything, Merlin, Draco still loves Potter with every fibre of his being. He doesn't think he'll ever stop loving him.
draco startles at blaise suddenly walking in and settling at the armchair near the fireplace. pansy merely nods at blaise’s statement. “seriously draco, all you have to do is court him.”
“I never apologised properly, did I?” At Harry’s confused expression, Malfoy continued. “For stomping on your face and breaking your nose in sixth year.”
, as harry relished in the way draco smiled into the kiss and the way the boy’s soft lips felt against his, harry couldn’t feel happier. because draco loved him,
Harry almost missed the faint, “Because it’s the colour of your eyes.” before he felt a pair of lips softly pressing his. The smell of Draco was intoxicating and the feeling of his own lips pressing against Draco’s made him dizzy in a way he couldn’t explain yet all Harry knew was that he wanted
“how’s the courting going, oh dear one?” pansy asked which prompted a soft smile from draco. “it’s going good, i guess. he still hasn’t figured it out though. i’m afraid he still thinks i’m courting someone else.” at this, blaise raised an eyebrow. “did you do anything to make him think this?” draco shook his head. “not really, i don’t think so. he suggested to start calling him by his first name the other day which i did, but he still didn’t figure it out.”
and not as the Boy-Who-Lived. He wanted what Hermione and Ron had. It was getting awfully tiring to constantly have to third-wheel the two of them whenever they met up.
It’s not like Harry couldn’t get himself in bed with someone, he could. If anything, he was the most eligible bachelor in all of Wizarding Britain after he broke it off with Ginny. He had come out to the Prophet years ago, telling it to the world that the
Malfoy twirled his wand around. “Ah, but there is where you’re so dearly wrong. I forgot to mention, Antoinette has accomplices–“ Malfoy leaned in to Harry’s ear, his lip brushing across Harry’s earlobe, making a shiver run down his spine. “–Three accomplices, to be exact.”
Harry watched as Malfoy dipped his hand into the bag and popped one into his mouth. He watched the way the moonlight accentuated Malfoy’s features perfectly and the way his lips moved as he chewed on the nuts.
She shrugged, putting Hugo down in his cot before lowering Harry’s wand. At this point, Harry didn’t know whether to feel betrayed or mad. They didn’t think he could win over Malfoy? Of course he could win over Malfoy. Harry was the one who spent most of his childhood trying to avoid getting killed by a dark wizard anyway.
- had proposed. He can't bring himself to look at their happy faces as he crumples up the paper in his hands. Draco tries his best to take a steadying breath, making sure his voice doesn't break. "Leave." Pansy, Blaise and Theo are standing behind him silently, shifting from side to side. "Draco-" Pansy tries to take a step closer, tries to hold his arm but he shakes her off angrily. "I said
pansy only laughed before sitting next to draco and patting his back. “you should tell him. i think he fancies you too. maybe court him or something, malfoy style.”
apologising to almost the entirety of hogwarts was one of the hardest things draco ever had to do. seriously, swallowing up his pride? that wasn’t what malfoys do. but it was nice to have people forgive him and put the past behind, and so draco mustered up all his courage and apologised.
harry was a patient boy, he really was. but people snap. and so, that was what harry did one night. he snapped.
Draco closed his eyes and released a trembling breath, his hands still clutching onto Harry’s robes tightly. “I want to be with you too.”
, exceptionally good. Needless to say, it pissed Harry off. Not to mention the fact that Malfoy seemed to enjoy doing paperwork. He’d come in and walk over to his desk opposite of Harry’s, set down his bag and go over to the cafeteria to make his coffee the way he liked it before coming back to start on his paperwork. Two sugars, two creamers and stirred exactly five times. Not that Harry was paying any attention to Malfoy or anything, mind you. He had this obnoxious hum every time he sat down to do his paperwork. He’d play with his quill, biting on the tip of it with his mouth as he filled up his paperwork. It made Harry all sorts of bothered.
Draco isn't stupid. He knows things, knows when to take hints, when he isn't wanted anymore. That was the thing really, he was always good at social cues. After years of being trained harshly and relentlessly by his father so he could always appear as the
Tapping his fingers on his lap, Harry cleared his throat. “What’s your favourite colour?” Harry’s knees bumped against Draco’s.
to wear that on their date along with the atrocious looking ring. Harry hated it, he really did. He stood in front of his mirror, clad in the hideous dress robes Malfoy had sent him with his hair neatly combed to the side. Ron and Hermione had flooed over– it took 10 minutes for Ron to stop laughing at Harry’s outfit– and Hermione had insisted that despite the nature of it all, Harry still had to look good. “Don’t you want to look good for your date with Malfoy, Harry?” she had said with a knowing look in her eyes.
– that’s what he considered at least. draco had come up to him one night and apologised as sincerely as the slytherin could, fumbling over his words and holding a crumpled up parchment paper in his hand, his eyes occasionally darting to it so he could recite out the contents.
Malfoy took a nut into his hand and threw it up into the air, catching it effortlessly in his mouth. He looked up and raised a taunting eyebrow at Harry, his mouth turned up in a smirk. “Whatever.” Harry grumbled, and Malfoy laughed. It wasn’t a mocking laugh– not much like the ones Harry’s used to hearing– it was an actual laugh, one that Harry only heard when Malfoy was around Zabini and Nott. It did things to Harry’s heart in ways he couldn’t explain.
harry smiled, the best smile he could come up with, because he wasn’t the boy draco had fallen in love with. no, instead he’s giving draco advice on how to court someone else.
It’s a year after Draco and Harry’s break up when he reads the headlines on the front page of The Prophet, and his heart breaks all over again.
The sound of the doorbell broke Harry out of his trance as he stumbled out of his room heading for the front door. Kreacher apparated right in front of him with a loud
it’d been two weeks since harry had given his first suggestion. harry had been on the lookout ever since, taking extreme focus into whoever draco was interacting with to find out who the
“what? didn’t take me for the gay type?” draco had asked, raising an eyebrow. harry quickly shook his head. “no, just surprised. i’m not homophobic, i swear. i like both too, actually. i sway both ways. men and women–“ draco laughed at harry fumbling over his words. harry thought that he’d want to hear him laughing every day. “just messing with you, potter.”
Draco scoffed. “You don’t need to remind me, I saw that atrocious performance at the Yule Ball. Come on, I’ll teach you.”
Draco was surprised at how easily he had been accepted into the group. He had sent most of them apology letters, as part of his self-imposed penance back when everyone was still freshly grieving. Not to say it wasn’t awkward to begin with, but they seemed to trust Harry’s judgement, and Draco tried his best to show them that he really was trying to change. He ended up spending most of the night with Luna Lovegood, faintly amused by her outlandish conspiracy theories and inspired by her unwavering optimism.
Malfoy had no snarky response to this. He just sort of stared at Harry for a bit, into those same eyes he was blabbering about earlier. And Harry started back, and then they were leaning in, and then they were kissing.
He held out a hand, and realised a second later how it mirrored their first meeting. This time, Harry took it without hesitation and Draco smiled.
After thanking the elves, they hurried straight to the Hall as to not miss any of the fun. Lunch was just starting, and the hall was packed.
Of course, this also meant that Harry was single, something Draco didn’t think would be of any relevance to him until Harry kissed him after the second time Draco joined their pub night, and- oh.
Draco Malfoy was sitting on the floor of Andromeda’s living room in her little cottage outside of Devon, playing with Teddy. At the sound of Harry’s name he had stiffened up and was now staring intently at a patch of carpet.
After a while of painful conversations with bureaucrats, he spotted a familiar dark bob and excused himself from a droll discussion on the rise in price of potion ingredients.
“He’s been popping over for months now, I’m surprised you haven’t run into him sooner. We’ve been to the Manor a few times too, to see Narcissa. It’s been lovely getting to know her again. Draco is Teddy’s cousin, you know. Well, first cousin once removed.” Harry had never quite got the hang of family trees.
Draco arrived perfectly on time, which was to say fashionably late. The gala - for some charitable cause or another - was already in full swing, politicians and Aurors and other notable figures chatting to one another around the ballroom.
Pansy rolled her eyes, before her features softened. “The war is over, darling. Nobody’s out to get you anymore. Live your life.”
Draco scoffed. “I’ll say. The only thing overshadowing your tardiness is those god awful robes. Really, did you find them on the floor?”
Andromeda interrupted his train of thought. “Nonsense, Harry, you’re always welcome in my home. The more the merrier. Are you hungry? I was just about to start dinner.”
“I see you’re feeling better then, Mr Malfoy. I see no need for you to remain here any longer. Off you go, the both of you!”.
on is eyes, such an intense shade of green you feel as though you’re about to fall in, and the way his hair is so messy but he pulls it off so effortlessly, and oh Merlin, have you
supposed to know the answer?) or his personal life (which, really?). He was proud that he managed to keep up what Hermione referred to as his ‘PR smile’, so they didn’t peg him as rude and run off to the Prophet with tales of the bastard-who-lived.
Malfoy let his face slip into a half-smile. Harry realised how open he’d been here, in a way that he never had at school. He didn’t think Malfoy was capable of smiling like that, soft and sincere.
Madam Pomfrey was using the look usually only reserved for the worst of troublemakers, mixed with something that could almost be perceived as… pride?
Andi’s dining table was set up across from the sofas and coffee table that made up the living room. The cottage was cosy and modest, yet somehow not cramped. Harry supposed you wouldn’t need that much space if it was just you and a baby. His heart ached for her. She had lost her husband and daughter in the war, yet was strong enough to keep going and take care of Teddy. After the final battle, Harry had dragged himself back to Grimmauld Place, collapsed onto Sirius’ old bed and didn’t leave the house for almost a week.
“I’m just worried about you. His sister was one of the victims in the final battle, you don’t know if he holds that against you,” Draco murmured, voice laced with concern.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco asked, and that sealed it, didn’t it? Harry never could back away from a challenge.
“Uh, yeah,” Harry continued feebly. “And I guess that I... um, kind of feel the same way about you.”
Harry took another glance at Malfoy, who had eased a little but was still tensed up. Teddy had started tugging at his fingers. “I really don’t want to impose, Andromeda-”
“Potter. Thank you. For speaking at my trial, and my mother’s. I- I can’t imagine where I would be right now without that.” His voice was low and genuine.
“That was a bit weird, don’t you think? I mean, everyone already knew it apart from them, but, you know, uhh...” Ron glanced at the two and instantly regretted it, as they were passionately making out.
“Silence!” yelled Headmistress McGonagall, in a truly terrifying manner that shut everyone up out of pure fear. “If those affected could please stand up and make their way to the hospital wing that would be much appreciated.”
He lowered his voice. “I know that. But there are people out there who got hurt and might not be as forgiving for the mistakes we’ve made.”
Harry was surprised at how much he had changed. Draco seemed to really want to help people, and he was shocked to discover how much he actually enjoyed being in the Slytherin’s company when insults weren’t being hurled. He stuck around for a cup of tea and biscuits after dinner, enjoying the atmosphere.
Andromeda and Harry moved about the kitchen in comfortable silence. Before too much longer, their shepherd’s pie was in the oven and Harry was sent to set the table.
“Oh my fucking god Seamus, I am extremely in love with you,” blurted Dean Thomas from just down the table. Harry and Ron shared confused looks, whilst Hermione just rolled her eyes.
His mother had not been so lucky, and was sentenced to two years of house arrest. And so the role of regaining his family’s favour had fallen to him, attending every ball and social event he could get an invitation to. Which, of course, was difficult when you had been a Death Eater.
He could remember what had happened before he even opened his eyes. Fuck, he was so humiliated. He would be laughed at and disowned by all of his friends. Maybe not all, as Pansy had told him that she was a lesbian in their sixth year, but still. What would his mother say? And Potter would hate him even more now!
It was then that he noticed the warm hand holding his own. He opened his eyes slowly, to see none other than Harry James Potter sitting next to him, holding his hand, asleep no less.
“Are you okay with that?” Harry asked, voice laced with concern. “I know you weren’t sure when we discussed it and I don’t want you to feel-”
“You heard me. Move in with me. I mean, you already spend most nights here anyways, and now that the rest of the wizarding world knows there really isn’t anything stopping us.”
“There’s Veritaserum in the soup!” she exclaimed, with the air of someone yelling “Eureka!” You could hear so many spoons clattering down at that exact moment, it was almost comical.
Draco sat up quickly, swiping his hand away from Potter’s. He woke up with a soft grunt, which Draco found adorable, goddammit.
It started off with Seamus Finnigan enchanting the tables in the Great Hall to float upside-down, a classic prank executed with a powerful bit of magic. It was quickly followed by many others, each more outrageous than the previous.
Draco was surprised at how easily she had managed to move on. Her family weren’t quite as involved with Voldemort as Draco’s, but they were still known to be sympathisers, and many remembered her for the spectacle she had made of herself on the day of the final battle. However, she had managed to secure a job for herself at Witch Weekly - she always had been one for gossip. Most of her articles were still minor ones tucked away at the back of the magazine, but she was slowly but surely working her way up to bigger things.
Harry laughed again, a sound Draco was sure he’d never tire of hearing. “Are you sure? I’ve always been a bit of a shit dancer.”
The truth was, Harry actually had no idea. He had rushed straight to the hospital wing as soon as classes had finished. He had then waited there for several hours (it was now past dinner) and had evidently fallen asleep. He could have used those hours to think up something to say when the sleeping beauty finally arose, but instead he was stuck spluttering here like an idiot. This was why he wasn’t in Ravenclaw.
Speaking of. Draco walked through the ballroom, careful to smile at the right people and avoid eye contact with the wrong ones. He got himself a drink at the bar nestled in the corner, before taking a breath and resigning himself to a night of restoring the family name.
“Harry! I wasn’t expecting you today!” Andromeda wandered over to the fireplace and greeted him with a warm hug.
Harry snorted. ‘Differences’ was putting it lightly. But still, he thought. The war was over, as Hermione and his mind healer had reminded him frequently. He trusted Andi, and Malfoy seemed to have spent enough time here to get to know her and Teddy. Surely it couldn’t hurt to give him another shot?
And it was truly the best thing either boy had either experienced. That was, until they were interrupted by a polite cough.
“Mm. Reminds me of Christmas at the Weasleys,” said Harry absentmindedly, levitating two mugs towards him.
Harry, Ron and Hermione came into the hall slightly late, covered in snow after walking from the Herbology greenhouses. They took their places, still faintly shivering.
He led them to the centre of the kitchen and arranged Harry’s other hand on his waist. He would have to lead, although a glance at Harry confirmed that he didn’t mind.
Harry gaped at him for a second. They had discussed coming out to the public, but Draco didn’t seem that enthusiastic and Harry didn’t want to push.
The band started to play a song, and it took Harry a moment to realise why he recognised it. It was the one they first danced to at Grimmauld. He met Draco’s eye and it was clear he was thinking of the same thing.
“Dinner smells good,” Malfoy said tentatively, as though not quite sure whether or not he should speak first.
Teddy started babbling and crawling towards Malfoy’s half empty mug of tea that rested beside him. In one deft swoop he took the mug out of Teddy’s reach and gave him one of the toys scattered around the carpet. Teddy seemed satisfied with the replacement.
After the Battle of Hogwarts, even with all of their losses, it felt like a large weight had been lifted from the shoulders of so many. When term started back again in the following September, nobody was quite right (especially the returning eighth-years), but if you looked closely enough, you were always likely to see a smile in the courtyard, or laughter echoing in the halls. There was also an abundance of practical jokes being played, especially by the older years. They had been forced to mature so fast, yet now there was a chance to become children yet again.
Malfoy smiled and let himself into the Three Broomsticks, letting the door close behind him. Harry shook his head and resignedly opened the door for himself, the comforting smell of Butterbeer and warm food washing over him as he entered the pub.
Harry had noticed, of course he had. He noticed every little thing Malfoy did, though he didn't quite understand why.
A flurry of falling snow hit them as they left Spintwitches, wind whipping the flakes into their faces as soon as they opened the door. Malfoy was smug and tossing the practice Snitch from hand to hand, and Harry was angry at Malfoy's contemptuous treatment of the kind, if outspoken, shop-owner. Harry snatched the practice Snitch and examined it, again, to see what made it so different from a regular Snitch. Malfoy looked at him oddly. Harry felt annoyance swell in his stomach, and he said, "You really shouldn't have thrown them at her, Malfoy. It was rude and arrogant."
Harry watched them rant and rage, feeling completely out of his depth. He took the Snitch right from Malfoy's hand and inspected it as they continued on, oblivious to him:
Potter seemed to ponder this. "You know, I think she might be. Don't you dare tell anyone I said that, though, Malfoy. Or I'll hex you into tomorrow," he threatened.
"Yes. Fine, Malfoy. I'll meet you in the Entrance Hall, on the first trip, which is . . . November the twenty-third."
They walked in silence for a while, and it was when they reached Hogsmeade that Malfoy broke the silence.
Harry spun around, cursing, and saw that Malfoy was already several metres in front of him, speeding after the Snitch. Harry pushed his broom as fast as he could, catching up to Malfoy swiftly. They were right next to each other, and Harry shouldered Malfoy out of the way. Malfoy shoved him back, and it was then that the Snitch decided to switch directions. A little blur of gold, it shot straight down, right towards the ground. Nearly eighty feet up, Harry heard Malfoy swear as he shifted on his broom in unison with Harry, and then they both hurtled downwards. Harry was right behind Malfoy, in hot pursuit of the Snitch. He caught up to Malfoy and saw his pale face grow even whiter as they rocketed toward the ground- twenty feet, fourteen feet, nine feet. Harry noticed Malfoy's broom jerk, as if he were doing his best not to back out. Then Harry saw Malfoy's eyes steel, and Malfoy reached his hand out for the Snitch, close enough to touch Harry's own outstretched fingers. And then they both grabbed wildly at the Snitch, moments before crashing. Harry felt his fingers catch one of the frantically flapping wings, and saw Malfoy's slender fingers close on the little golden ball. In the seconds before they hurtled into the earth, Harry noticed that Malfoy's finger-nails, far from the perfectly manicured specimens which Harry somehow would have expected, were bitten to the quick, with little scabby scraps of skin around the edges. He was jarred, for whatever reason, by this surprisingly human and . . . vulnerable characteristic on the otherwise perfect Slytherin. All these thoughts passed through his mind in an instant, and then they slammed into the deep snow with a soft flump.
"No, I'm just . . . Don't you ever have to change yourself to fit what people want or expect you to be?"
And it seemed Harry wasn't the only one enjoying the company of a Slytherin. Hermione had happily informed him that she'd be meeting up with Pansy Parkinson at Madam Puddifoot's next Hogsmeade trip. Likewise, Ron had grudgingly acknowledged that he'd be accompanying Blaise Zabini on a mix of errands and more fun things- they planned on picking up some potions ingredients from Dogweed and Deathcap, purchasing Blaise some dress robes from Gladrags, and then on visiting Honeydukes together.
Malfoy sighed, setting down his glass. "You know, Pansy often says I have many different sides to me. I suppose I'm just different here than I am at Hogwarts."
Harry shook his head. "Are we really going to get into this? No, you wouldn't have. Scabbers was in Ron's family for years. He had no reason to suspect anything."
Malfoy looked up in interest while taking one of the salmon pasties. "The kitchens? How do you get in there?"
Malfoy stared at him blankly. "Obviously, Potter, I have an image, a reputation to uphold. I have expectations I must live up to."
"You make no sense, you know that, darling? If only Potter could see this side of you . . . Carefree, innocent-"
Draco couldn't keep a triumphant grin off his face, watching Pansy and the girl she secretly, yet somewhat obviously, took a fancy to walking down the street together.
"We fight because you are arrogant, and you act superiorly towards people. It's not really because of me. I just don't believe in that sort of thing. That's the only reason we're not friends now. And even if I'd chosen to be friends with you back then, on the train, I'm almost certain I wouldn't be at this point anyway, because I want to be friends with people who don't discriminate as you do. I'm friends with people who have the right values- like kindness, and acceptance, and equality."
At this point, they had reached the front of the line. Filch checked their notes, muttering under his breath. He scanned Draco's with barely a glance, but glared suspiciously at Potter's for a long moment as though he suspected it of being a forgery.
"-stopped all my messages, so I got nothing from Ron, Hermione, or anyone. That was the worst birthday, because I thought everyone had forgotten me. I'd never had any friends before, so it was awful. Then I was locked in my room because Dobby-"
"Well?" Pansy's voice came from the deep green armchair next to the fire. Draco turned and saw her, her eyes glinting in the firelight, head propped up on her arm, eyebrows wiggling. She smirked. "Did you find out?" Draco flopped into the squishy armchair opposite Pansy and sighed.
Harry thought for a moment. "What could you possibly want to know? Everyone knows all about me already."
Harry sighed. "Hagrid said they were proud, and intelligent. You should've known better. You did a good job getting him to bow and all, you just shouldn't have pushed it."
"N-nothing," Harry stammered in surprise, then cursed himself for stuttering. He'd just been watching Malfoy! What was the big fuss?
Pansy considered this, then said, "You know, I don't think he really hates you. He seems to almost enjoy bickering with you. Like an old married couple."
"Though, I don't really want to stop bickering with you. It sort of brings some . . . excitement to the place. Hogwarts doesn't really need more excitement, of course, but . . ."
"'Urry up and snog, a'ready! I got ter get me ter the 'Og's 'Ead fast-like fer a meetin'!" one abrasive man with a ruddy red nose shouted. Draco felt his face turn warm as he met Potter's gaze. He was surprised at Potter's soft expression, and stopped by the way the light flickered across his bright green eyes. Potter's lips parted, and, as if in slow motion, he leaned forward and- Draco's eyes widened, and he leaned forward just a tad, lips slightly parted, and- Potter's head turned, and he kissed Draco's cheek.
"More luck. If Fawkes hadn't come and gouged out the Basilisk's eyes and given me the sword, I never would have beaten Riddle."
He and Malfoy drifted around for a while, searching wildly, to no avail, until Malfoy suddenly hurtled straight at Harry. Harry, startled, jerked his broom away and caught sight of a golden flicker at the edge of his vision.
"This has been . . . fun. You're not a git like you usually are. You're behaving like a normal person for once."
Draco turned to look at Potter, who hadn't moved from his wide-eyed position. "Are you quite alright, Potter?"
That was true. Many people didn't really know Harry. And people had all these false impressions about him- look at the rubbish that Rita Skeeter was putting out there. Harry picked up a kipper and chewed it before answering.
"Very good, dear. Now, I'd like to say I am so very pleased to see so many of you coming to my shop. I just had the little Irish fellow and the tall, dark lad in here, and your friends, the one with the bushy hair and the one with the very short skirt. I'm simply so proud. You're so brave to be out in the open like this. I know there are so many horrible, judgemental people out there, and I want you to know that Madam Puddifoot's-" She jabbed her ample chest with a stubby thumb. "-is a safe place for all members of this community. Do you understand me, dears?"
"Malfoy, I didn't ask for that. The only reason I'm famous is that Voldemort killed my parents! Who'd want-"
"Yes, well, your friends did. They harrassed me in the kitchens to make two more drinks, and to serve them to your table." She shrugged, clanking the mugs onto the table, then making her exit, squeezing between a cramped table and the approaching Pansy and Granger.
Malfoy glared at Harry, then sighed. "I know," he muttered quietly. He looked dejected, like there was even more to that soft 'I know' than Harry understood. Harry was struck by an urge to give him a sort of sideways, one-armed hug. But that was ridiculous- this was Malfoy. He was rude and arrogant to Harry and his friends for no reason other than social status. But still . . .
Harry felt a funny little lurch in his stomach, looking at the witty, handsome, funny, intelligent boy in front of him, and he realized that he was in a world of trouble.
"Naturally. Now, they didn't want to tell you, so how did you find out? I'm catching little things, like Hagrid, and something called a Hedwig, and I know that Hagrid brought you to Diagon Alley, as I saw you there, and I know he gave your cousin a tail. Care to explain the whole thing from the beginning, Potter?"
Snow flurried through the air, crystalline flakes whirling and swirling on the bitter wind. The sun shone bleakly through grey clouds. Potter asked if he fancied anyone. And of course the answer was yes. and of course it really was Potter's concern.
Draco nearly dropped the fork he'd previously been mutilating the table with. His neck cracked as he whirled around to stare at Potter owlishly. Potter was determinedly examining the ceiling for faults, and clearly would not be surfacing soon. He seemed not to realize the effect which his nonchalant declaration had had on Draco.
Draco cast a helpless look at Potter as Pansy dragged him away. Potter laughed at his dilemma and followed.
"Yeah. I remember that. You were a self-satisfied, pointy little git. Bragging about your broom and your blood status. I had no clue what you were on about, but I despised you right away."
For reasons he knew not, he found himself counting the days until the next Hogsmeade trip. He was merely going through the motions of classes, homework, and conversations with all but Ron- who he was now on good terms with once more- and Hermione. He could hardly wait for the moment he would see Malfoy again. Of course, he had seen the enigmatic Slytherin several times in their shared classes, or in the corridors. He sought Malfoy out between classes just to get a rise out of him. They bickered and insulted each other as usual, except Harry thought he saw a twinkle in Malfoy's eye even as he smirked, tossing out rude comments like rice at a wedding.
Harry patted the snow, searching for his glasses without relinquishing the Snitch. Then he felt Malfoy's hand leave the tiny golden ball, and felt his glasses being gently rested back on his nose. One arm of the glasses poked him in the ear, and Harry released the Golden Snitch and righted it. The blond blur in front of him revealed itself to be a smirking Draco Malfoy, who laughed at Harry's expression, brushing some snow out of the dark fringe of hair that concealed Harry's scar.
Potter stared at Draco incredulously, so Draco felt as if he were being scrutinized intensely. Of course Potter wouldn't tell him- Draco hadn't told Potter if he fancied anyone.
Malfoy glanced at him while taking another pasty. "That's not true, Potter. People think they know you. There's a difference. Do they know the things that make you you? Or do they know surface facts- Quidditch player, Gryffindor, famous?"
As Harry watched him swish away, Malfoy turned his head, just slightly, to glance back at Harry. He called out, his eyes sparkling with glee, "I suppose I'll see you in Hogsmeade, then, Potter."
When he asked Malfoy, Malfoy looked at him disbelievingly and said, "Potter, who wouldn't enjoy the attention? Teacher's pet, can't go anywhere without making the front page; 'Harry Potter walked into a bookshop today!' 'Harry Potter went to the toilets!' It's ridiculous."
Potter blinked, then replied, with a self-conscious glance around the steamy little tea-shop, "Well, er, it's just- Don't you get the feeling they have some sort of ulterior motives? I mean to say, they drag us here, and then they just vanish. I dunno, it seems odd."
"Try . . . to get along. A little. I sort of want to try to be less, you know, constantly fighting, if you could try to be less judgemental, and less hateful."
"What are you thinking of, Potter?" Draco asked. Potter shook his head as if clearing it, then fixed his gaze on Draco. Draco was unsettled by the intensity of those green eyes. Then Potter sighed. "Just . . . memories. Family things. You know, er, it's hard to explain."
Potter glanced at Draco, then shrugged and took his own mug, nudging the other one toward Draco. Draco made up his coffee- a little sugar, a little milk, and a little cream- and listened to Pansy and Granger's light banter, with Potter putting in a word now and again. Draco sipped his hot, steaming beverage, the drink warming him up almost as much as the ridiculous Gryffindor squished up beside him.
But no. It was not meant to be. As Potter attempted to leave the shop, he was pushed back by an invisible wall. Draco shoved him aside and tried to exit as well, but to no avail. Finally, he turned to Pansy and sent her a murderous glare. She smirked. Granger had her face in her hands, but Draco could see her peeking through her fingers. Potter coughed quietly.
After leaving the Three Broomsticks, Draco saw a sight even stranger than Potter insisting on paying for their drinks: Pansy and Blaise, who should have been off on a date, traipsing along in the company of Granger and Weasley. Weasley and Blaise were lagging behind the girls, Blaise speaking smoothly, his face cool as ever, while Weasley looked surly, casting frequent glances at Granger and Pansy, who were up ahead, giggling together. As Draco watched, Granger buckled over laughing, and Pansy, under the guise of propping her up, sneakily and expertly slipped her arm around Granger's waist. Granger looked flustered, yet pleased. Pansy just looked smug.
"Er, Malfoy, we're, er, holding up traffic." This was true. There were several people trying to leave the shop, but being shoved back by the enchanted mistletoe's field.
Harry felt a scalding stab of anger. "Actually, no, Malfoy. I don't get presents, at least not from the Dursleys. My eleventh birthday was my first real birthday. I got Hedwig from Hagrid, and a cake. I also was told I was a wizard, and that I could get away from the Dursleys and attend Hogwarts. Then, when I was twelve, Dobby-"
"You go through a door in the entrance hall and take the stairs down. There's a corridor with a painting of a bowl of fruit. You tickle the pear, and it giggles and lets you in."
Pansy groaned and shoved Draco from her lap, inciting a muffled protest as he fell to the floor in a heap.
Hermione took Ron's arm and pulled him toward the hut, as he seemed reluctant to leave Harry and Malfoy alone together.
"Er-" Potter looked a little overwhelmed at her brisk manner, but he didn't have to search long for what to say, for Puddifoot cut straight across him and continued speaking.
Malfoy laughed shortly, then replied, with a perfectly straight face, "Yes, Potter. I want to get you on your own so I can kill you and hide your body in the Shrieking Shack." His voice was dripping in sarcasm.
Pansy snorted. "Like you don't like getting a rise out of him? Draco, darling, look at me." She leaned forward and grasped his face, squishing his cheeks until he was looking her in the eye. "I'm telling you, he will say yes. And if he doesn't, you ask again another time. Alright?"
He knew that he wasn't exactly straight. He also knew, however, that he was not gay. He'd definitely fancied girls- in fact, he thought Cho Chang was quite something, though whether he fancied her, he wasn't quite certain. But Harry was not straight. He'd definitely noticed other blokes in a way that was more than just friendly appreciation of a good-looking guy. As a matter of fact, he'd noticed Malfoy that way more than most, but he couldn't possibly- did he? Harry's mind was awhirl, swirling as fast as the flurries of snow in the sky. He glanced over at the rosy-cheeked, handsome, blond boy lying next to him in the snow. Malfoy looked peaceful, his face relaxed and not curled in a sneer. Harry thought it might be possible he did like Malfoy. Possibly in that way.
Draco sneered, "I was just surprised that the famous Potter would want to look at another hovel- thought you'd have seen enough of them during the breaks."
He stopped talking and stared up at a patch of ceiling like it was the most interesting paint-job in the world.
He saw Potter turn, saw the blurry outline of him, hidden by the constantly moving streaks of falling snow, saw him glance around for Draco. Draco saw Potter notice Draco, still standing in the doorway, and saw Potter begin making his way back to Puddifoot's. And Draco looked down at his own hand, feeling surprising warmth at the simple kindness of the girl he'd been nothing but cruel to for years, and went out to meet Potter in the storm, hopeful for the promise of the crackling fires and loud warmth of Hogwarts.
"Okay . . . well, I think I rather prefer the civilized, friendly-ish Malfoy over the arrogant, rude one any day. Why do you even act like that in the first place if it comes so naturally to be like this?"
"I mean, she and Blaise are dating, but . . ." Draco trailed off, watching Pansy and Granger, while Blaise snuck a glance at Weasley, eyebrow raised. Weasley scowled, ears pink.
Draco considered this carefully. "That might work. I mean, the first part is entirely true- ow! Don't hit, Pansy! No hitting, my father will hear about it! Ow. Yes, so that's true, and I'm sure I could actually get Crabbe and Goyle a detention. I could frame them for some sort of transgression. It would be quite easy."
"Potter, do you have any idea what I could buy for ten Galleons? It's a ridiculous price. A practice Snitch isn't worth that. Hell, a real Snitch barely is." Malfoy sounded exasperated, and Harry just felt irritable.
Potter blinked. Draco felt a dawning sense of understanding and horror. She didn't think- not that he'd be complaining, in any case, but-
"Shh, don't interrupt me, darling. You're adorable. I'm sure that if Potter knew you, as opposed to just one side of you- your much more sarcastic, grouchy, and, admittedly, cooler side-"
"Are you . . ." Potter still was looking up at the ceiling. He breathed in and out deeply. "Y'know, gay? Or something of the sort, I mean, er-"
"Yeah, you reminded me of my cousin, Dudley. Spoiled rotten, except you were more arrogant. And perhaps slightly less stupid." And far better looking, Harry added mentally.
Eventually, when they'd all quieted down, paid, fixed the damage done to the table, and felt quite prepared enough to brave the storm once more, they stood and began the arduous task of putting on their winter layers and pressing through the cramped shop without being caught under mistletoe. They had almost escaped the confines of the little shop, and then it happened.
"Actually I think it does, as I'm the poor person you're antagonizing about it. I think I at least deserve to know why you're interested." Harry retorted.
Draco stood there, under the mistletoe by himself, for a long moment, watching the retreating forms of his- his friends.
"Oh, just walking along with my enemy . . . to Hogsmeade . . . to catch a Butterbeer, or to visit Zonko's. You know, the usual." Malfoy glanced at Harry.
"What do you mean, Potter?" Malfoy glanced up from his drink, normally pale face flushed from laughter- Harry had told the story of when Hagrid had given Dudley a pig's tail. He hadn't explained it all, just that Hagrid had visited Harry to give him his Hogwarts letter, and had gotten angry at Harry's cousin. Malfoy hadn't asked why Hagrid had needed to personally deliver the letter, and Harry hadn't volunteered the information.
"Hurry up, you filthy Squib!" Draco snapped. "Stop trying to find something wrong with Potter's note and let us through. You can see it's perfectly in order. My father will hear about this! This school is going to the dogs. You're holding us up for no reason. No, get your grimy hands off me, you daft-!"
They both had their hands still locked around the Snitch, and Harry ducked as he saw a fist fly towards his face. He kicked his knee out, jabbing Malfoy in the stomach, and heard a satisfying oughf. Malfoy's fingers scrabbled for purchase on the cold surface of the little Snitch, and Harry locked his grip tighter on the wing. He could feel the Snitch beating wildly at his hand like a trapped hummingbird. Malfoy's elbow hit him in the stomach, and then a leg flew over him and flailed around, kicking his back. Harry scrambled at Malfoy, fighting for the Snitch, and soon they were just a messy tangle of limbs in the cold snow.
"Malfoy." Harry responded. Malfoy glanced up at the sky for a moment, a brief gesture of irritation.
"Ah. Makes sense," Harry said. Then he furrowed his brow. "But Wood has us practice with the Snitch all the time. How can the Snitch for the game know who touched it first if we use it for practice?"
"I was wondering, Potter, if- well." He stopped, then tried again. "As you will be going to Hogsmeade this year, I was wondering if I could- this is ridiculous. I wanted to know if I could accompany you to Hogsmeade."
"So I spent the first eleven years of my life in a cupboard, underfed and being bullied by Dudley, my cousin. Oh, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon love Ickle Diddy-dums. He's the light of their life. They coddle him so much, it's embarrassing. He's spoiled rotten, fat, and ugly. He looks like a walrus masquerading in a blond wig as a teenaged boy."
And so Malfoy took his exit, leaving Harry suspicious and bemused, with his wand still halfway out his back pocket.
"I can and I will. The only reason I'm alive is because of my mother. Not because I'm special. She sacrificed her life for me, that's why Voldemo-"
As they spoke, casting glances around the shop from time to time, trying in vain to spot Granger and Pansy in the crush of people, a stout little woman with a shiny black bun squished beside their table and began speaking rapidly.
It was the first time Harry had seen him since his trial almost a year ago. At the time he was gaunt and pale, robes hanging off of his thin frame after his short stint in Azkaban. He seemed better now, healthy, whole again. His face had colour about it, and he had grown into his pointiness. His hair was the same white blonde, but it was no longer slicked back and as a result looked fluffy and soft, with a slight wave to it. It suited him.
Immediately upon arrival most eyes were on him, as per usual. He really should be used to this by now, he thought, as a particularly daring witch asked him for an autograph. He shouldered his way into the main ballroom, attempting to find his friends whilst still keeping his head down.
Draco just looked at him for a second, bedhead and all. He realised how content he was here, in Harry’s bed, in a way he hadn’t been in years. “It’s very hard to say no to you, you know.”
Dinner was not as bad as he expected - a bit stilted, but not uncomfortable. Andi kept the conversation going by asking them about their lives. Harry didn’t have much to offer, other than the fact that Auror training was difficult and exhausting, and complaints about the many public appearances he’d had to make. Between the two, his social life was practically non-existent. Malfoy didn’t have an awful lot to say either, but Harry had discovered that he worked at St. Mungo’s, doing something with experimental potions. Malfoy ended up explaining an aspect of potions theory that went right over his head, but Andi nodded along with him.
“Not everyone is still clinging to the past, Draco,” she said pointedly. “People are capable of moving on, you just need to show them you’re willing to change.”
He steeled himself a little before walking through the door. It was just Malfoy, right? He had no reason to be nervous.
Harry thought about Grimmauld Place, and the cold and empty dining room waiting for him there. He didn’t particularly want to spend an evening with Malfoy, but another glance around the cosy room and at Teddy made him stick it out. Besides, it would be a good idea to see what Malfoy was up to nowadays, he rationalised. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t wondered. “Okay then.”
