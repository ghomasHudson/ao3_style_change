“This is the Hospital and Haven for War-Damaged Beasts,” Æthelflæd stated.
“Neither.  I will be mellow with the monkey, and the monkey will be mellow with me.”
“With Dobby.”
“Good. Come with us.”
Parvati sat and put an arm around her shoulders. “I love you, Lavender. You’re my dearest friend.”
he thought, and laughed.  He felt a bit giddy.
Harry Potter gazed at Draco, open-mouthed. “Yours, am I?  Your what, exactly?”
, Harry Potter.
The slow liquid crooning was a song Draco now recognized, and his memory filled in the words.
Someone must have spiked Draco’s punch too.
“You’re interfering with the treatment of a patient, is what you are.” The woman glared at him.
A serendipitous source of information, perhaps. “Have you, by any chance, heard of a dragon called Zmey Goryn… Zmey Gorny….”
Harry turned toward the newcomer and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy. Malfoy started, sloshing the liquid that hissed in a goblet.
“I’d been with Andromeda and Teddy before.”  It had been an adventure, the first time, and Draco had been nervous, but he wasn’t about to tell that to Potter.  Harry.  Whoever.  Andromeda was comfortable in the Muggle world, because her Muggle-born husband Ted had been close to his family.  She’d been willing to help Draco get his feet wet there.
“Kreacher is being a member of the House Elf Lending Library.”
Harry’s words died in his throat.  Having spent so much of his childhood locked in a cupboard, he couldn’t pretend not to understand.  “No,” he said raggedly, “neither do I.  Can you see where we might have a problem here?”  He unlocked his door and pushed his way blindly inside, as twigs began to snap from the blue gum trees and whirl across the yard.
It turned out to be a small plant with pale green leaves and a cluster of star-shaped reddish blossoms with a faint scent.  Puzzled, Draco looked at Potter, who shrugged.  “He just said it’s called centaury.”
“Really? No one else?”
always tucked it in somewhere, and it always said you weren’t in danger of dying at the moment. So that was a relief.”
“Birds?”
There were scorch marks on the huge wooden door.  He had a flashback of this hut blazing, that terrible night he had fled with Snape, trying to escape what he had done by letting Death-Eaters into his school.
Over lunch Draco learned that Merfley had volunteered for this position because he liked animals. He had been unhappy in his previous household, where he had been mocked for, among other things, his devotion to dance. In the end he had defiantly danced through all his duties and been dismissed, only agreeing to leave when he was presented with ballet shoes. Now he required Tuesdays off for ballet lessons, which Draco readily consented to.
When Draco was settled and looked over, Potter’s cheeks were flaming and his face had a mixture of fear and defiance that was totally characteristic but, just now, unexpected.
Sobbing… thorn bushes… rain… “The Augurey! It’s found its voice again!” he exclaimed, just as the rain picked up. “My potions worked!” He had to raise his voice over the sound of raindrops bouncing off the Umbrella Charm Potter had hastily put up to cover both of them.
“Are there any chips or samosas?  Or groundnuts?”  Draco asked, turning to him.
“I certainly did.  But on my first trip I almost didn’t make it onto the train!  I didn’t know the secret to get to the platform.  Then on the train I made friends with Ron, and ate pumpkin pasties and chocolate frogs, and started learning about Quidditch, and…  well, I hadn’t even known about the wizarding world until a few weeks before, so it was all very new and exciting.”
The bear turned to his uncle.  “I’ll pay you.  Make you rich.”
At the tiny shop run by Harry’s teaching colleague, Mrs Kaliwa smiled warmly at him and exchanged greetings in Chichewa.  Harry tried to buy something there each time he came to market, but the inventory was so small that it took some ingenuity.  Meanwhile Draco admired her roly-poly baby son.
Draco was still talking.  “His brother Regulus is a star in Leo somewhere.  Andromeda is a constellation of her own – you can see her low on the horizon sometimes – she’s my mother’s sister.  And Aunt Bellatrix, who unfortunately was the one I actually knew.  She’s in Orion, not hard to find, but let’s not look for her.”
, yet another humiliation.  His mother was awaiting him downstairs; she seemed to have a difficult time looking at him.  They took a carriage to the gates of Hogwarts, and then she used Side-Along Apparition to bring him to St Mungo’s.
“Did you enjoy the Chaucer, Harry?”
Behind them was a sudden loud rustling as the Hippogriff shook out its wings. Luna turned. “Oh, what a splendid Hippogriff! I haven’t seen one in so long.”
“O Wizard of My Dreams,” Harry prompted him.
Outside crickets were calling and the first faint stars were pricking the sky.  Fern prowled through the grass.  A movement caught Draco’s eye, as an owl swept low and silent over the ground.  Fern saw too, and ran after it.
His thoughts were interrupted by the call to come have tea, and he returned gratefully to the Burrow to bask in the Weasleys’ affection.
Harry answered before Draco could start in with his stories.  “Just someone I knew from my school days.”
Sometimes Fern scampered along the towpath, stretching her legs, while Gabriel flew overhead.  The boats moved at a walking pace, no more than 4 miles an hour, so there was no danger the animals would be left behind unless they went into the fields to hunt.  They seemed to understand that they should keep the boat in sight.  The only difficulties came when they encountered dogs, but the combination of cat and owl was enough to keep them at bay.
“Awk!” said her raven.  Padma smiled.
He let Andromeda know that he’d be there soon, sent Potter an owl to explain, and changed to more child-proof robes.
Or rather, he was.  He was on a date with an owl.  As chaperone.   To his cat.
Draco spun around, wand out and cursing, because there was the last person he wanted to find him like this, Harry Potter.  Then they were both firing hexes and jinxes, dodging, smashing lamps and bins and cisterns until the floor was flooded, but never managing to hit each other.  Desperate, Draco seized on the most extreme curse he dared.
“Princess Millicent,” Pug-nose breathed.  “Isn’t she splendid?”  And she hurried off to the troll princess and left Harry by his lonesome.
“Mother – you heard what he said.”
Still half drugged with sleep, Harry found himself kissed and stroked and rubbed and grasped and licked and sucked into such arousal that he was moaning toward a climax when Draco, laughing, whispered, “Shhh.  I hear your neighbors walking by just outside.  Probably on their way to church.”
The healing sunlight fell on him, and the salt air of this foreign shore lifted shame away.  He brought Harry’s hand over his heart and held it there.  Harry gathered Draco in his arms and kissed him, and they fell backwards.
“Yeah, those public appearances are draining sometimes, aren’t they,” Harry said as he came over to rub Draco’s shoulders.
“If by ‘often’ you mean ‘ever.’  Not in my own home, though.  I wonder if I can talk to it?  I haven’t had a reason to use Parseltongue in years.  Do you think it’s safe to Rennervate it?”
Padma threw her arms wide and declaimed:
Malfoy frowned.
“He likes cats,” Harry offered.
“Into a Muggle university, so clearly you’re not a Muggle-hater any more.”  Harry’s voice softened.  “That must have been such a difficult transition for you to make, Draco.”
“Well, a few things have happened since the last time we played Quidditch against each other,” Malfoy said quietly.
Ruthie!”  Draco’s face lit up with wonderment, his awed voice trembled.  It was very satisfactory.  Rutherford gave him an affectionate blink but decided to conclude her business with Potter first.  Let Draco see how seriously she took her work!  Rutherford shook the leg with the parchment at Potter.
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“What do you mean?”
Ron was clearly sorry he’d ever asked about rhymes. “Anyway, Malfoy, I’m more than just
“I know that your mother saved my life once.  And I know that you are not your father.  And I’ve always known who your father was.”
Draco paused to think that through.  “Is that where the Snatchers found you?  The Forest of Dean?” he asked quietly.
“Not just his clothes and armour, Potter.  His horse is green.  His hair is green.  His SKIN is green.  Overall enker green.”
Harry and Draco arrived together, late. No one took much notice of them at first. Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and Harry could see the tension on his face. Impulsively he turned to give Draco a quick kiss, which turned into a longer kiss. When they finally pulled away, they faced a sea of astonished faces.
Draco was silent a moment.  “And I suppose all the house-elves love you, Potter?  Including Kreacher?”
“We can apply heat to raw food and often achieve an edible result. But we usually don’t have to, because my sister is a professional kitchen goddess.”
Bellatrix always says he’s weak.  Maybe so.
“Longer than that?  You’re going off on some secret dangerous mission.  You have to tell me something, Harry.  Harry – look at me.  I want to come with you.  I want to help.”
Harry began to stroke and watched Draco’s mouth fall open and his gaze go soft.  With a surge of protectiveness Harry moved to kiss him.  “You show me now,” he ordered hoarsely, and followed the lead of Draco’s fingers over his own.  Draco’s eyes fell shut and Harry began to kiss him all over his face and throat.
Harry’s lips met his and opened to him, and sunlight poured over them like a blessing.
8888888
but even unlikelier that he chatted with Luna.  Holding someone prisoner in your family’s dungeons wouldn’t seem a promising way to begin a friendship.
Potter reached up to him and Draco hauled him up behind onto the broom.  The peacocks swirled up around them in a noisy storm and Draco shot up higher.  Fortunately their tails weighed them down and they were rather clumsy flyers.
“Thank you for that,” Draco told him.  His powers of speech were returning.
“I believe you’re going to win this time, Weasley,” Draco finally said.
“The marriage to the troll princess with a nose three ells long?”
They sat quietly for a bit, watching the stars come out and listening to the water lapping against the boat.
“Nope, you’re a monkey too.”
“What did it look like?” Dean asked.
“Why would she mind?  And I think in some ways a Muggle cat-tail is more attractive.”
“I’m not afraid of a Malfoy, you worthless little traitor.  I’ll kill you later.  But first, Potter, you die.”
“To amuse the hatchlings,” Draco confirmed, setting his tuba down.
But he turned back to look on his way out.  A feeling came over him that the cabinet held a secret to his future.  In the dimness of the shop, the opals gleamed, and the shriveled hand seemed to beckon him to return.
“We’ll just get our things stowed, then,” Malfoy said.  He picked up Fern and carried her aboard, then returned to levitate their luggage onto the small deck.
Draco’s breath caught.  “Breathe,” he said, for both of them.
“Hmm.  Maybe after I finish this chapter,” the lassie said.
“Never even heard of it before.”
“But what happened?  And why are you a bear again now?”
.  He tries again and again and again, but all he manages to produce is silvery mist.  Once, he sees the faint shape of something, not a stag but a four legged animal, and then it’s mist only, mist only.
"Mr. Malfoy, I believe I told you to move," Professor Mason interrupted, glancing at Neville's empty seat next to Harry.
Harry felt the urge to moan when the Malfoy's mouth finally sealed over his and provided a delicious amount of friction and pressure that made his head spin a little bit. He slid a hand into the hair at the nape of Malfoy's neck and tugged his head back. Draco brought a hand up to flutter along Harry's jaw and cheekbone.
Rosemary smiled fondly and saw its reflection in the other woman. Unexpected guests were a happy occasion.
"Yes," Harry answered shortly.
Harry's grin spread. Neville and Lavender's booth was illuminated by a pulsating gold-tinged rose globe. He didn't know what that meant, but the sight of it warmed and soothed him, and so he could guess at the activities going on inside.
It was interesting to watch the war waging between Malfoy's pride and the potion in his system. When, predictably, the Veritaserum won out, the Slytherin released a breath and turned his face away from Harry before answering.
They came to a cross in the corridor and Ron paused. "You coming?"
He cleared his throat. "You mentioned a cave."
"Are we doing the same thing next class?" Draco asked him, and if there was a hopeful note in his voice, Harry told himself he imagined it.
"No," Harry corrected. "I meant what are you doing here. In this tent. There was no magical energy above it. For all you knew, no one was in here."
Harry shook his head and looked away. "Whatever, Malfoy. Can we just go back to not talking, please?"
"Each of you please take out a coin and choose who will flip and who will call." Professor Mason instructed as she walked through the aisles. "The person who calls correctly shall be on the receiving end of today's lesson. If the caller is incorrect, than the flipper shall be the recipient instead. Today we begin practicing manual stimulation, involving the utilization of one partner's fingers to caress the other's genitalia. Boys with female partners, do not be discouraged if your partner does not reach climax. This sort of thing takes practice."
"What?" he asked, surprised.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his sweaty hair before looking down at his own neglected member, pressing insistently against the cotton of his bottoms. With a shrug and a mutter about ungrateful prats, Harry walked over to the sofa he'd left not long ago and set about dealing with the problem himself.
"Ah, yes," Dumbledore smiled grimly. "My home away from home these long six months. Before then I'd been tracking Voldemort across the entire U.K. There were many reports, of course, but only a handful of them sounded promising. Due to Voldemort's terrible cleverness, however, those that were genuine were sketchy at best, and morsels of real information were difficult to pick out amongst the gossip. When I found him at last in early spring, I had to be careful to disguise my presence. The cloak helped."
"Right. That." Malfoy nodded and looked away.
"Well, yes, but that was different. That class was purely elective, and I had more than enough classes to fulfill my requirement. But Sex Magic isn't even technically on the roster. You require the professor to sign a form in order to add or drop the class." Hermione explained.
Harry glanced at him but Ron just shrugged sheepishly and looked away. Faintly intrigued by the strange display, Harry tore the ribbon from the roll of parchment containing his Seventh Year schedule. Unrolling the crisp, yellowish paper, he scanned the line of familiar courses; Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, until he found a new addition to the list. His eyes bulged from behind their round, plastic frames and his mouth fell open in shock.
"What!" Harry squawked loudly.
Harry stopped, feeling frustrated and angry. Draco was staring at him with a pleading look on his face, silently asking Harry not to bring this thing between them here, out into the open, where it would be more real somehow. This wasn't class, nothing was expected of them, it wasn't okay to do this here.
"I'll see you in class tomorrow, Potter." Draco mumbled, looking at the floor the entire time, before he pushed the flap back and was gone.
Without meaning to, Harry had blearily made his way to the seventh floor corridor. He ran his fingers along the stone wall, visibly swaying with exhaustion, and his fingertips encountered a familiar doorknob. Looking up, he saw the door to the Room of Requirement, already manifested. It was enough to startle him awake.
"Don't pout," Harry snapped. "I guess I realized at the end of fifth year that I didn't hate you anymore. I know why things changed for me, but what about you?"
He sighed, laying down his quill and rubbing the ache out of his hand, and glanced around the room sleepily. His gaze lighted on Lavender and he watched her chew the corner of her mouth as she concentrated on her Charms textbook. He smiled. It was nice to see her at ease for the first time since school had started. When she glanced up he gave a small wave. She frowned, her eyes going distant as she froze. Then, with a sudden burst of movement, she snapped her book shut, rose from her chair, and turned to flee.
McGonagall didn't answer and her eyes slid to the side, silently indicating the two boys nearby. Nodding her understanding, Mason stood and motioned the Transfigurations professor to one of the booths. A marvelous insight on her part to have made the curtains soundproof.
"I think you were hoping that I'd be here." Harry told him, leaning closer, so that his cheek pressed against Draco's and his words were murmured into the curve of his jaw.
So Professor Mason had told her assembled students when class had begun twenty minutes ago, and yet somehow Harry and Draco had wound up on the sofa, both of them shirtless and out of breath from a heated bout of snogging. Malfoy half-sat, half-lay on the sofa, one arm braced on the cushioned end, the other draped over Harry's shoulder as he clutched at the back of his neck. Harry knelt over Malfoy's torso, his hands digging into the other boy's scalp as he clenched his fingers in his hair.
"No!" Draco shouted back, tugging back.
"No," Harry answered automatically, not knowing that it was true until he'd said it. "I used to. But there's a lot of other stuff going on that's more important."
Neville's head drooped and Harry glared at the freckled boy. "Nice going, Seamus."
"Yeah," Neville muttered back. "I'm sorry, Harry. About Malfoy, I mean. Tough luck."
"Please, one of you move to take your seat," Professor Mason said cooly, undeterred.
Harry didn't stick around to hear more, and let the portrait fall shut behind him with a bang.
Both boys moved forward a few paces and sat down in the nearest available open space, on separate pillows. Harry looked over to where Neville and Lavender were sitting to see his friend attempting to coax Lavender to lay her head on a pillow he'd placed his lap. When the girl stubbornly refused, he leaned in close and murmured something in her ear. She stiffened, but relented, curling up on her side with her head resting comfortably in Neville's lap. The boy looked over at Harry and smiled before placing his hand on Lavender's shoulder and rubbing in small circles.
He was pleased to see the shock register in her eyes, and when he turned to head back to his essay there was a smug spring to his step.
"Stay back, or I'll be forced to hex you. I think you'd be surprised at the array of spells that Professor Snape has authorized Slytherin Prefects to use against students... especiallyGryffindor students."
Draco merely raised an eyebrow at Harry's limp member in reply, making Harry blush scarlet and zip himself back up in embarrassent.
"Lavender! You're not thinking of-"
"You thought I'd come here, and we'd have a hot little wanking session?" Harry asked viciously.
"How do you know that?" Ron asked.
"Thanks," Draco muttered dryly.
There were two choices that he could see. He could decline, and continue in his seduction efforts, which may or may not prove to be successful. Or he could agree to Malfoy's terms and try his damndest to win the Slytherin over to their side in the short months they had left.
He nods at her, cordial; bends his head against the fine drizzle that’s dispersing through the already cold night air, and heads for the castle.
She blinks; a flash of red-gold eyelashes in a cutting sweep, and then she’s darting away, presumably to the Headmaster’s office.
“You’d- take me.  Into the Chamber of Secrets.”
So, I'm actually sort of on the fence about Hermione and Ron.  On the one hand, they can be pretty... gross, and this was supposed to be a story of Harry sort of casting off the blah Gryffindor boringness of the Chosen One, but on the other hand, this is a tale of Harry embracing his Slytherin side- that
Malfoy has an odd expression on his face, something queer and fey, all the angles of his face drawing towards the center in heartbreaking desideratum.
After all, Dumbledore only ever calls him ‘Tom’ to his face, and that seems akin to poking a rabid dog- dangerous and illogical.  To Harry and his friends it is always ‘Voldemort’ or ‘the threat of Voldemort’ or ‘the unimaginable danger of Voldemort’.  He only ever calls Voldemort by a dead man’s name to provoke him, perhaps to cite a closeness that existed, if ever, only in the realms of fantasy.
, wasn’t it
“Yes, Professor?” Harry says- quiet, polite.  He has to- he-
Harry straightens immediately, spine stiffening on instinct; he can figure this out himself, no matter how much his head is aching (it feels like there’s something in his
Harry did not seriously think Malfoy was inviting him to move in.  “Where would I go?”
Lavender leaned into her. “But, but…will anyone ever kiss me again?” Tears ran down her face, crookedly because of the scars. She’d been pretty, once, before the battle, before the werewolf. Now people sometimes flinched when they looked at her.
“I want to go up to Draco again, and be with him tonight.”
“I don’t go around changing my glasses like I’d change a shirt.  They’re part of me, it’s personal.  You wouldn’t understand.”
“This is slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry,” Draco said. “You don’t seem in any danger, Pansy. Perhaps I could wander on home now?”
They’re not sure it’s you.  Somehow they have doubts.  As if anyone else would wear those hideous specs.  So now they’re asking me.  Damn you Potter.
Potter read it over dubiously.   “And what are your qualifications for this position?”
“It’s the oil,” Draco told him.  “It’s a – not a love potion, but a lust lotion, or something.  I felt it too. I know it doesn’t mean – I won’t tell anyone, it’s all right.”
Within half an hour the barn owl was back with a longer letter.
Potter had a date tonight?  Somehow Draco had imagined they could relax after dinner for a little.  Though, why would he think that?  Potter was squeezing in time for Draco at dinner, between the other things in his busy schedule, before he went out with his date – dancing, maybe – anyway, it didn’t matter, Andromeda needed one of them to mind Teddy and it might as well be Draco.
“I know what it means.”  Draco held his eyes in a level gaze.  “So you decided to lock yourself in, Harry?  Taking lessons from your benighted Muggle relatives?”
With an awkward 3-way Side-Along Apparition, Harry brought Luna and Æthelflæd to the meadow near his campsite, where he’d left the Mooncalf. The animal was where he’d left it, still immobile.
“Go away and stay away,” he told the owl, giving it the parchment. From the room where he’d pent her up for safety, Fern yowled.
“And just what does this partnership involve?”
“They’ll need it,” Draco finished quietly.  “Hermit, eh?”  He raised an eyebrow at Harry, who gave him a half-smile and a shrug.
“He laughed at my name.”
“I meant cartomancy.  Fortune-telling.”
“Really?”  Boy Draco looked impressed.  “But he’s old!”
Draco thought.  Harry slid off and lay next to him, reaching a hand to stroke Draco’s now soft cock.  He turned to look at Draco with a question in his eyes.
“I’m named for a constellation, Potter.  Half of my mother’s family are named for heavenly bodies.  The night sky is like a Black family genealogy.”
Just then the Floo roared to life and Hermione appeared. Harry held out his arms, grinning. She gave a little shriek, dropped a couple of packages and dove at him. Harry laughed as he hugged her and then caught his breath at the sweetness of feeling so loved. She squeezed him hard in silence and then words came tumbling out, a mixture of welcome and reproach. “I haven’t heard from you in forever, Harry!”
“Nah, he’s not my type.”
“Revenge of the Mudgleborns, Malfoy?  It would serve you right if it were,” she said.  “This castle needs lifts, like the Ministry has.”  But the castle had a hundred and forty-two staircases.
Draco nodded, still pink-cheeked.
“It says the world’s biggest gathering of garter snakes is in Manitoba and if we hurry we might be able to catch them coming out of their winter dens where they all sleep together to stay warm.  In spring they have mating balls.”
Draco gripped the edge of the sink, shaking.  He stared blindly at the grimy basin, now streaked with his tears, and heard in memory the taunting malice in the Dark Lord’s voice.
“I guess I just don’t think of myself as a wizard here most of the time.”
Harry had slipped out while Draco was sleeping. Left the bed, the flat, the country. Left everything except a word.
“Yeah, I used one.  Third year, with Hermione. We saved Buckbeak and Sirius.”  How elated he’d been. “But then Sirius died anyway.”
Padma raised her eyebrows, but said, “Let me think….”
But once again, Draco was fast asleep.
“I hope so,” Draco replied, his heart sinking.
“You can call me Hairy,” Potter said.
“We’ll have to go. Do you fancy using Gillyweed, or a Bubble-Head Charm?”
“Did you know that 500 years ago, the most important part of Timbuktu’s economy was their trade in books?” Padma said.  “Can you imagine a city like that?”  She and Hermione both had dreamy looks on their faces.
But Potter was looking at Draco, with a fond smile on his face.
“I can’t,” Harry replied.
“I just wanted to let you know that Gabriel is here,” Malfoy said.
A tawny owl appeared at the window and tapped.  “You’ve got an owl here,” Harry called.
Harry thought. “You’re doing it,” he said softly, and sat down next to Draco.
8888888
“Surprise me.”
“So how did my glasses end up with you, anyway?”
“Because of the after-effects of the war, Harry Potter was taking a therapeutic walking tour, in the course of which the Mooncalf was accidentally injured. So it was a late casualty of the war.”
Draco doubted that asking a house-elf “how” would be productive.  “Kreacher,
“Going to let a butterfly knock you off your broom, Potter?”  Draco teased.
Harry shook his head. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think people would be so worried, once Voldemort was gone.”
“He stopped to protect me, cast a spell to keep me from moving under the invisibility cloak – that’s why you had time for
“You seem very calm about this, Malfoy.”
His parents would have been horrified. But following their path had led Draco to far greater horrors than laundry lessons, and besides, they weren’t here. His father was in Azkaban and his mother, having seen Draco safely through his own trial, had finally given way to nervous exhaustion and been sent by her Healer to southern France, to recuperate in the care of distant cousins.
“Yes, riding naked on her horse.”
“How do you know these things, Hermione?”
“He’s changed, Ron.  Have you talked to Bill?”
“Impressed, I think.  I don’t know how you managed.”
Spoiled rotten, more like, Harry thought.  “What kind of coffee do you want, Malfoy?”
“Listen to his breathing, it sounds so strange. What’s the spell for this? Or is there a potion I could make?” Draco asked urgently.
?  Fascinating stuff, but much harder to read in the original, unless you speak a northern dialect yourself, perhaps.  It’s alliterative, which makes it easier to look things up in the glossary, but still…  Chaucer would be much easier to start with.  And he’s so likeable.  Funny and humane.”
Harry wasn’t as close to Ron and Hermione as he’d once been – they’d become absorbed in their own lives, he supposed, and then Ginny and Ron had squabbled a lot.  After Ginny left, Harry hadn’t much felt like seeing anyone. But Ron and Hermione were his oldest friends, and he didn’t want the distance to grow.
“Malfoy, wake up, it’s all right.”
“A truth universally acknowledged,” said the man standing in the doorway, broom in hand. It was Draco Malfoy, though whether he looked cool or challenging or amused, Harry couldn’t quite tell.
“Oh, nothing,” said Hermione, still smiling.
“Trust me, just for a moment,” Draco said, pulling an astounded Harry into the chariot.  Rosemonde turned and rose.
I must go to Britain, as quickly as I can.  It will be dangerous.”
“I seriously doubt that,” Pansy said. “But you’re on.” She turned to Draco. “Set something up for me, there’s a dear.”
“I like,” said Harry, grinning back.
“Hey, you’re talking to the man who ran away to be a hermit.”
When he arrived at the front gates of the Manor Draco could hear the screeching of angry birds mixed with Potter’s shouted spells.  He hurried through the unlocked gates and waded through the weeds.
Draco slanted a suspicious look at her and she smiled brilliantly back, then turned and walked off, calling over her shoulder. “Owl me the details.”
“No.”  Another volunteer had described them as the basic snack food – greasy, crunchy, good with salt – but Harry couldn’t ignore the little dusting of insect legs left on the hand, no matter what a good protein source they were.  “I would’ve thought Malfoys didn’t eat insects.”
“Now?”  She bounced.
Malfoy’s jaw dropped.
His eye fell on the sturdy little centaury plant, with its cheerful red flowers.
“Oh, but I forgot, that would be beneath your dignity as Ambassador to the Centaurs or whatever it is.”
Potter looked at him, amused. “Don’t be a Fluffengrumple, Malfoy.” His eyes were warm and his smile was relaxed and it was altogether a charming expression such as had not been directed Draco’s way before.
Potter laughed. Nicely. Draco offered him another biscuit too.
“Does that mean the wyverns have all died off, then? Could they be hiding?” Harry asked.
“Yes, Father,” Draco replied evenly.  “I am Draco, your son.”
? I may have been all kinds of horrible to you, Harry Potter, but when have I ever been indifferent?”
“You’re planning something.  Are you going away somewhere this summer?”
Harry tried to catch Ron’s eye, remembering all the dreadful prophecies from Divination class. But Ron was getting a second slice of cake, and Lavender captured Harry’s teacup. Fortunately she did not see any portents of death. “It looks like there is romance in your future!” she said, eyes twinkling.
So Draco kept busy, but there was always an undercurrent of worry about the war, and Harry, and his family and friends.  On Beltane he felt particularly homesick.  It was a holiday for which Draco felt a special affinity, since his wand was hawthorn, the May bush, Beltane’s sacred tree.
“Teddy?”
Harry explained as politely as he knew how.
“Funny, you look kind of goofily happy.” Draco’s voice was teasing, his face aroused.
Draco made his way slowly through the skeletal beasts, who stared at him with unnervingly blank eyes.  Luna unwrapped a packet of bloody chopped beef.  He took some and held it on a flat outstretched palm.  The elderly horse accepted it delicately, and then her warm tongue gently licked the blood from his hand.  It was unexpectedly comforting.
“Less well these days, apparently.”
“This Draco.  Think there’s any chance of a happy ending for him?”  Harry turned and lay Draco gently down on the sofa.
So Harry was a bit choked up when it came time to sing the national anthem, but Draco had picked up the words and tune from overhearing them at the school assemblies, the combined voices of several hundred students having carried easily across the road to Harry’s little house.  Now Draco’s clear tenor blended into the seemingly effortless beauty that is Malawian choral singing:
His mother’s sisters were his only living relatives with counterparts in the sky.  Bellatrix was in Orion, the Hunter – too close to Sirius for his own good.  She must have taken particular pleasure in killing her own cousin for the Dark Lord.  It was a chance to prove her fanatic loyalty.
“Well, I’ve never been to that castle myself, but you might ask the East Wind.  She’s very keen and far-sighted, and maybe she could blow you there.”
“Is this your brother, Mr Potter?” asked Madalitso.
They arranged to meet at Grimmauld Place for dinner the following Saturday evening, and Potter left.  Flying.  Maybe someday they would get to compare brooms….  Draco sighed and started trying to transfigure some protection for his garden, while Greg stirred four spoons of sugar into his tea and ate all the biscuits.
Pansy propped her chin on her hands.  “So, what is this paragon like?”
Draco observed.
“It’s a wyvern,” Malfoy said absently.
“I agreed to an interview, Malfoy, but not with one of those lying Quick-Quotes Quills!”
“You’re the only bee I care about right now.”
“Did you understand what Slughorn was saying in potions class today?” Potter asked.
“She was insane, frankly.  But yes – family feud.  And there’s nothing civil about a civil war.”
It was likely to be short, so Draco nodded.
Harry watched woefully as his strawberries disappeared into the kitchen, but was appeased when they returned washed and accompanied by cream and sugar. For a few minutes they ate strawberries in happy silence.  Then Harry remembered his question.
“As a matter of fact, I do.”

Harry couldn’t help himself. “You’d think the buzz would have died down by now.”
“I don’t suppose you have a spare broom?” Harry said, watching Gabriel fly lazy circuits over the grass.
Please wake up and let’s go home!
Draco let out the breath he had been holding.  “Who’s there?” Dumbledore said.  “Ah –  good evening, Draco.”
8888888
“So are you offering yours?”
Since he was alone, he let himself cry until he fell asleep again.
“But your plan
“What are
“We did it!” Harry was flushed with passion and excitement.
Stung, Draco groped for a response, but by now his father had turned away to negotiate with Borgin over the articles from home that he wanted to sell.  Draco turned blindly back to the shop’s dusty displays.
At the cabin Draco waved Harry in, pointed out the bathroom, grabbed a paperback book and left.  Harry looked around.  One bed had slightly rumpled sheets and a few things by the bedside stand, and the mosquito net was hanging down.  Clearly Draco was sleeping there.  On the other bed the sheets were crisp, the stand was empty, and the mosquito net was tied up in a bundle above it.  Harry untied the net, kicked off his flip-flops, and put his glasses on the bedside stand.  He hesitated a moment, then took off his khaki shorts and peeled off his sweaty T-shirt, and climbed into bed in just his pants. In the familiar tropical ritual, he lifted the mattress on all sides to tuck in the mosquito net until it spread above him like a gauzy tent, then lay back to sleep.
“So you never really answered - what
“Timbuktu?”  Harry asked.
“We can make it up as go along,” Harry said.  “Just try not to fall off the bed, it’s a long way down.”
“Is there something about a knight with green skin?”
“Is that an invitation, Potter?”
you.”
“I don’t believe I ever thanked you properly, Headmistress.”
doing here?” Malfoy continued.
“Demons?  No pandas?  What kind of book are you reading, anyway?”
“Yeah, Padma…” Hermione paused, her face lighting up as she searched for words. “You know, we just understand each other so well. With most people, I have to think about how to explain or present myself, but with her I can skip that.”
“Have you now.”  Potter’s eyes gleamed.
But nothing woke Draco up.  Finally poor Harry climbed into the bed, and if he cried a bit before he fell asleep, no one could blame him.
The hand at his waist moved to splay out over his abdomen and press him back firmly.  He heard Draco’s breath catch.  “There?” Draco whispered, turning his face toward Harry’s, so close.
“Yes,” Malfoy said briefly, no longer smiling. “What do you want, Potter? Here as a junior Auror, are you? Where’s the uniform?”
“It’s been a while since you called me that.”
“Because it’s a challenge?  Because it’s fun?  Because they can’t help it?”
Merfley brightened. “A shampoo! And maybe a trim?”
!” said Pug-nose.
Draco thought.  He ached with a need for things he could not do on a public beach.
“They’re for Kili.”
“What did you say?”
“We’re short-staffed, Granger speaks well of you, I need you on a project.”
“I still can’t believe you stole my family’s house-elf.”
“And no singing!”
“Yeah.”  Perhaps Harry should have asked him about the reasons for that.  “Anyway, I want to quote something as a comeback.  Preferably from a language he doesn’t know, so it’s new to him.”
“Did the Humdinger Attractor work out?”
“Yeah,” he said raggedly. “But we’re both here now. So how about that snowball fight?” And he scooped up a handful of snow and rubbed it on Potter’s head, just so he could touch that hair, even with mittens on.
With difficulty Harry held himself back, then wrenched himself away and stumbled five steps to the pantry, grabbing the vegetable oil.  When he returned Draco was shedding the last of his clothes.
“No, your first one.  I know you wanted it back, but….”
“Do you think - there’s room?”
“They follow the line of the hillsides.  I hear they’re beautiful from above, all green and silver, sun glinting off the water.”
Mme Maxime told him that the Ministry in Britain had begun imposing new restrictions on Muggle-born Wizards, and he volunteered to join the Reseau – the French side of the refugee escape network that smuggled vulnerable witches, wizards and their families out of Britain.  To help them with clandestine communications, Draco used the Protean Charm again to make coins such as Dumbledore’s Army had used.  He told the French wizards what he knew of Voldemort, and counseled the refugees that passed through Beauxbatons on how to adapt in France.
“There will be a good dinner when we get to the castle,” said the bear.
“You’ve met centaurs with axes?”
Potter was smiling steadily now and Draco felt himself about to fall into those green eyes again, when a shadow passed overhead.
“Charming,” Harry said dryly, but Malfoy just nodded, looking toward his cat with a slightly melancholy expression.  Fern was now sitting next to Gabriel with a foreleg draped over his shoulder.
just passing through.”
“Astronomy.  Muggles have enormous telescopes, some of them out in space, and they send photos of more galaxies than we ever dreamed of.  There’s a group of us who volunteer to catalogue them through Galaxy Zoo, helping to map the depths of the skies.  Some of us found these small round green galaxies – we call them green pea galaxies – that turn out to be rare and incredibly active at forming stars.” Draco smiled. “We call ourselves the Peas Corps.  Give peas a chance!”
Draco thought with a little ache of their midnight expeditions to the Prefects’ Bath, where he could float and swim and move with ease.  They’d laughed and wrestled and spun together in the water like otters.  Harry was always relaxed afterwards, and willing to let Draco touch and tongue him all over.
From farther back in the woods came a whinnying sound.  The child turned her head and called back, “It can talk!  And it smells good!  But it only has two legs, and they’re funny, and no tail.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. “Are you sure you’re alright?” he said finally, with a slight flush.
Draco nodded to an old woman swaying down the path toward them with an enormous bundle of firewood on her head.  She bent her knees slightly in response, in lieu of nodding her head.
2:04.
“Those are bee feet, Potter.  Someone must cure you of your obsession with feathery millipede legs.”
He padded down the long hallway to the front door and opened it to find an eager-faced young house-elf, cradling a bedraggled Puffskein in his arms. Opening a door for a house-elf—just one more way the world had gone topsy-turvy.
Draco nodded.
“Well… I was visiting Charlie Weasley at the dragon reserve in Romania. I didn’t know what to do next. He told me about Chinese dragons, so I decided to go there to see them. Then…” Harry trailed off. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. He tried to ignore that; Teddy deserved an answer. “It seemed like a good place to clear my mind and try to learn some things. And then… I lost track of time.”
Harry snorted.  That might give the best chance of success. “How far back would you go?”
“Buliga ako!”  she said to Draco, then whinnied in Houyhnhynm.
“I want to taste it,” Teddy announced.  “And to see a moose.  And ride in a dogsled.”
Grimmauld Place was a depressing house to be in, and not just because it was dusty and dilapidated.  Bitterness seemed to leak from the walls of the most noble and ancient house of Black.
Now McGonagall’s saying the same.
“Under the right circumstances.”
“I will, soon, just not today.  I don’t want you to miss your match.  Thanks for thinking of me, though, Ron.”
Potter looked startled and impressed.
“You mean he won?”
Harry rolled to the side. He caught a glimpse of black eyes in a small, heart-shaped white face, watching him from the back of the sofa.  He jumped, then realised who it was, and laughed softly.  Owls were so damn quiet in flight.
Potter yelped as some snow went down his collar, then stooped to arm himself, swearing revenge. Draco backed away, running and laughing. Soon the snowballs were flying and Draco was full of that exhilaration unique to going one on one with Harry Potter.
Rutherford liked Harry Potter.  He gave good owl treats, and didn’t hold it against her that she so often delivered rubbishy verse to him.  She decided he deserved the longer nicer poem, so she folded and rolled it up tightly and, using her beak and one foot, tied it to her other leg.  She sailed out the window toward Harry Potter’s house.  She knew the way very well by now; in fact, she knew a number of different routes, being an owl who liked variety.
Draco swung a leg over his broom and pushed off.  “Potter, here!”  Circling overhead, he stretched an arm down to the besieged Boy Wonder.  One of the demented birds leapt up and snapped at Draco.  “Come on!”
“How fortunate that summer holidays have just begun,” Draco said.   He didn’t bother to contest the notion that Hogwarts had ever been a safe place for students.
“I can still see it.  I mean, you calm me down.  After you annoy me, that is.  And I am known for a stinging wit.”
Harry laughed.
“Changed, sure.  I’ll believe that when I see it.”
“I don’t want to discuss it.”

^(OvO)^
Arthur began walking towards it with Harry. “It’s his,” Arthur said, waving toward the shed. “We were just looking at the carbelator.”
“Hmm,” Draco said.  “I could do research there myself; Sichuan has some specimens of magical bamboo that grow nowhere else.  But isn’t the food there blisteringly spicy?”
Malfoy was giving Harry’s loins a rather predatory look.  Harry felt himself redden, above and below.  Malfoy sauntered closer and put his hands on Harry’s hips.  “Maybe I can help.”
“Hello Draco!  Didn’t know you were home!  Mind your head!” Draco’s reply was drowned out by another shower of falling slates. Mercifully, Greg had sent them well off to the side, but the rosebush would probably never be the same.
Potter shrugged.  “Not feeling very festive.”
“Oh, I’m not harassed as much these days, so it’s easier to go out,” Potter said.  “People seem to have moved on.  New generation of heroes now.”
before beginning to practice, but he usually played for himself, a soliloquy.  This was the first time he had specially invited Draco to listen.
Harry dropped down to the deck and turned with his arms extended.  “Here.”
Potter said nothing, just looked and trembled.
“No, I’d better get back,” Malfoy said.  He raised a hand of greeting to Hermione, glanced about to find the dish of Floo powder, tossed some into the fireplace and stepped in.  Harry waved goodbye as Malfoy disappeared in a whoosh.
He switched into languorous and sensual music. Stirred, Harry lay watching him. “That must be for mating,” he said when Draco finished. Draco smiled and raised an eyebrow.
“People do,” Malfoy said gently.
Weasley was happy that Harry agreed to go out, Draco was happy to be alive, and Harry was happy that his old friend and new lover were on speaking terms, so a good, if occasionally awkward, time was had by all.
“You need to swallow more blood replenishing potion and get your rest.  Other questions can wait,” Madame Pomfrey said firmly.
I traveled as far as the four winds blew,
“Oh, er, that would be nice, but we have one in London too,” Harry told him.
Draco was left to think about how little he wanted to discuss the events of that day with Dumbledore or even Snape.  How much had Potter heard – did he know what Draco was planning?  Had he told Dumbledore that Draco was about to use an Unforgivable on him?  Life imprisonment was supposed to be the sentence for use of
are over-rated.”
used to put it on the front page, but gradually moved it to the back and finally dropped it.
The real apology was long overdue.  Harry took a breath and met Malfoy’s eyes.  “I’m sorry I used that curse on you.  I didn’t know what it did.  I would never have done that on purpose.”
Harry, both wildly uncertain and strangely, deeply sure, still could not speak. Lips and tongue found other ways to answer. Draco gasped and then kissed him back. So they began a call and response of kiss and caress, of need and desire, fumbling at first but growing in ardour, until finally they were tumbling into bed together, a tangle of discarded clothes behind them.
Potter held out a biscuit too. Old Timer didn’t seem to notice.

“Your penises?  How many cocks do you have, O Wonder of the Wizarding World?”
“More adventures with cutlery?”
Herman slowed but continued moving fitfully through the water.
“Well, if anyone has earned a vacation from responsibility it’s you, Harry. I know you hate being called a hero, but…”
Never would Harry have guessed that Draco Malfoy corresponded with Muggles by computer, but that was just the beginning of the wonder.  This man mapped the universe and looked at the birthplace of stars.
Harry had testified for Malfoy’s trial because he’d believed that the worst of what Malfoy had done in the war was under compulsion. He’d thought Malfoy had, in the end, been looking for a way out of Voldemort’s service. He’d hoped that given a chance, Malfoy could change. But it seemed not.
“And a bit – scarred.”
He thought he caught a smile on Harry’s face in the dim light.
“That’s fine.”
“Bear!” Harry said.
“You cleared out your mind? Like a cupboard? Did you throw away the things you knew before?” Teddy frowned. His godchild. How could Harry have abandoned him for so long?
Draco chuckled huskily and waved his wand vaguely in the direction of the mess. Once clean, he turned onto his side and propped his head up. Harry glanced his way and ran his eyes slowly down the other boy. Draco might not have known it, but he'd struck an alluring pose with one leg tucked up and bent at the knee, modestly covering himself but making his arse curve in a very enticing fashion...
"N-! Damn it! I didn't! Not until yesterday! With the whispering..."
After several more minutes of shouted curses and inventive, painful ways of attempting to force the gargoyle aside, Harry slid, sweaty and exhausted, into a slouch at its feet. Taking off his glasses to wipe at the sweat stinging his eyes, he stared blurrily at the semicircular trail of dust and broken cobwebs before him. He knew that someone had been inside the Headmaster's office. Heknew it!
"I'm afraid Harry will have to complete the course," Deputy and currently acting Headmistress Minerva McGonagall told the trio that stood in front of her desk.
"Here? How? Why now? Is something... did something happen?"
"Yeah," Malfoy nodded. "Okay."
Over the course of the next two lessons, Harry became increasingly impressed by the ingenuity of the Room of Requirement. Far beyond conjuring mere walls, the Room could also reproduce places, sounds and even scents with amazing accuracy.
Draco studied Harry with an unreadable look for several moments before speaking.
Harry choked on his half-chewed mouthful, and couldn't tell whether his face was more red from lack of oxygen or embarassment. "Wha-? That's totally- You... how did you know?"
Professor Mason sighed. "That'll do for now, I suppose."
The coin smacked heavily into Malfoy's palm and he whipped it onto his outstretched forearm with more show than was strictly necessary. When he lifted his palm, there was the engraved image of Gringotts with a crescent moon of numbers above it, indicating the Goblin who had cast the coin. Draco made a quietly outraged noise before snatching the coin back into the pocket of his robes. Giving Harry a cross look, he stood.
Harry chuckled, and Draco's eyes cracked open to glare at him heatedly. But then Draco was already turning the tables on him.
"But I didn't send in any application! My friends-"
"I want you to GO AWAY!" Harry screamed.
He felt used. Used and uninformed, just as he had back in fifth year. He was a tool. A bargaining chip that Albus Dumbledore would use again and again.
The Slytherin nodded, and Harry felt his hand speed up, gripping just a bit tighter. He breathed in sharply as the first jolt of pleasure hit him, and reached down to grip Malfoy's wrist. Guiding Draco's hand encouragingly, he urged him to grip higher, and then harder. He made a strangled noise as Draco obeyed and the palm of his hand slipped over the damp head of his cock. Draco quickly repeated the motion, and Harry squeezed his wrist so hard he felt the bones shift under his fingers.
He waited, his heart hammering against his ribs, as he listened to the goings on just outside the door to the booth. The voices rose, obviously in heated argument, and Malfoy laughed disdainfully. He heard him taking points away from every house but Slytherin, and then Lavender and Padma's angry protests. Neville remained silent, but Harry knew he would be glaring.
McGonagall sighed. "Do you remember in your Fourth Year when we asked underaged students not to give their names to older students to put into the Goblet for Hogwarts Champion?" she asked him. "It would have been pointless. The Goblet makes its decisions based on the magical signature that is specific to each witch or wizard. Having an older person put their name in wouldn't have made a difference, because it was still their name. Similarly, for purposes of this class the Goblet was specifically attuned to perceive an applicant's willingness to participate in the course. The Weasleys might have transferred your name onto a piece of paper that you did not sign, but the hand that wrote the signature was your own, Harry. Now I know that you resent being uninformed of your enrollment, and that you dislike your partner. But unfortunately, you do have to go through with this."
At that, Lavender turned an even deeper shade of pink.
"I was only trying to stop you squirming!" Harry exclaimed, thrilled that it was true. "It wasn't my fault that you started pressing back against me! I couldn't help but get distracted."
There had been no impromptu snogging this time. Mason had said that they could do whatever they wanted, and Draco had made it clear that he did not want a repeat of their last lesson together.
Harry shifted on top of Malfoy so that he settled comfortably between his thighs. He gasped against the other boy's mouth at the feel of the hard line of an erection pressed into his hip. He couldn't blame Malfoy, he was halfway there himself.
Harry sighed, rolling his eyes. "Continue. Fifth year?"
When she left, Harry cracked the book open and peeked inside. The contents were fairly straightforward, and he began to understand just how important Mason's talk with him had been as he read through it. Malfoy certainly would have loved to put a submissive Harry into a humiliating position. He might've enjoyed it so much that he ended up hurting him.
He was about to turn his attention back to his own dreadful Potions work when he heard the painting swing open and two tittering female voices approaching. Lavender and Parvati were in good spirits, it seemed. He grinned slightly, happy that he wasn't making Lavender miserable anymore.
"Mason said we could do anything we want," he told the other boy.
"Too far, gentlemen," she told them. "I understand that it can be hard for the both of you, with this being the first time that you're experiencing these feelings, but I need you to practice some control. You're already far ahead of most of the class."
Harry's wand hadn't been in his hand, and then it was. He wasn't even aware of reaching for it.
"No, we won't," Draco fired back. "We will be attending class, shagging when required, and leaving. After the year is over, I don't plan on spending another minute in your presence, if at all possible."
"It was," said McGonagall with a loaded look in her eye. "We have a guest."
"On the couch."
Harry squeezed the cock pressing into his palm, sliding his hand up and over the head, smearing the wetness there down the shaft. Draco's face averted from him, hiding his flush of shame as he allowed Harry to pull him off with slow, tight strokes. Harry revelled in the way that Draco's hips jerked into his hand, seeking a faster rhythm that Harry wasn't ready to provide just yet. Draco whined and reached down to grip Harry's wrist, attempting to force his hand to move faster along his cock. Harry stopped entirely.
Harry fought to keep his breathing at a normal level. He didn't want to be partnered with anyone! He just wanted to leave this frankly terrifying class and never return. He raised his hand once more but Professor Mason had already brought out a rough wooden cup that was crackling and spitting blue sparks, and set it on her desk. Small pieces of paper, knotted together in the middle, began to fly out of it and Harry lowered his hand as she began to read them out loud.
The boys rose from their seats, glaring daggers at one another as they walked by her. Looking up toward the heavens, Rosemary Mason heaved a great sigh. "Well, that appears to have been productive."
More names were read, and with each passing couple Harry became more agitated. He was working his third nail down to a stub when he heard the names Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson called out. Swiveling around in his seat, Harry grinned nastily at Malfoy, who appeared as though he'd just been struck in the face.
"Mr. Longbottom, would you care to explain why a ball of pink energy just flew from your tent and straight through the side of Mr. Goyle and Ms. Parkinson's?" she raged.
"Yeah?" Draco swallowed.
"I want to try something," he mumured huskily.
If one thing could be said about Hermione, it was that she handled such things with grace. Whereas Ron would have exploded at such a revelation, she merely sighed and looked genuinely disappointed.
"Yes, ma'am," the two of them muttered.
Harry cried out in surprise as the stone against his back moved suddenly and he fell backward. Stunned, he jerked his head up and peered at nothing. The air seemed to be swirling. He squinted at it, only succeeding in making himself dizzy. Fumbling for his glasses, Harry shoved them haphazardly onto his nose in time to see the shimmering effect of an Invisibility Cloak being removed. Tattered robes around a wizened form appeared, before a wrinkled face surrounded by wild, frizzy gray hair.
"Peasant," Draco sneered at the calloused state of Harry's skin.
"Yes," answered Draco.
"Call," he ordered, taking the coin between his index finger and thumb and flicking it into the air.
"Doubtful," muttered Harry.
"No, most definitely not." Draco snorted softly, and gave Harry a look. "But it is interesting to note your inventive wanking habits."
"Uh... The same thing, only in other places," he replied, clearly uncomfortable.
"Sorry," Harry mumbled.
Malfoy jerked his hand out of Harry's grip. "If you mean mucking around in the dirt like a Weasley, then of course not!"
"Why would you want to?" the darker girl asked, her nose scrunched up in distaste.
"Okay. I'm sorry," said Ron, holding up his hands defensively.
"And that's my fault?" he asked bitterly.
Neville's brow creased in contemplation for a few moments before responding. "Why do you act so ditzy all of the time? You're smarter than you let people believe."
Lavender huddled behind Neville and blushed to the roots of her hair, attempting to make herself appear very small. Pansy glared venomously at her, and Harry could have sworn that she looked jealous. Goyle appeared to be staring at Neville as though seeing him in a brand new light.
"No!" Ron denied hotly. "No, that was all their idea! They told me they were going to help you meet girls. I had no idea that this was what they meant! The two of them only owled me about the Sex Magic part before I left for school this morning, and by then it was too late to do anything about it!"
Hermione made her way up the steps to the seventh year girls room with an armload of books and a head full of troubling thoughts. Harry had been absent at dinner, along with Lavender and Parvati. Had it not been for the fact that Neville had been there, distant and closed-mouthed as he may have been, she might have thought that their Sex Magic class had run over. When the boys asked Neville how the class had went, he ignored them and drew into himself miserably.
"I've had the house elves deliver some sandwiches. You'll be completing the day's lesson after you've finished eating," she said, beckoning them out into the empty classroom. The rest of the students had left for dinner in the Great Hall.
Harry breathed deeply with his eyes closed for several minutes. Unlike Draco the night before, he felt like relishing his first other-person-induced orgasm. When he forced his heavy eyelids open at last, Draco was staring down at him with painful expectation. Harry realized that he was waiting for a reaction. Well... for a secondary reaction, anyway.
He cut himself off. Despite the fact that he currently had Lavender Brown- the most popular girl in Gryffindor, if not in the whole of Hogwarts- backed up against a stone wall and completely in awe of him, his heart was in his throat and his stomach was near full of butterflies. His bravado had its limits, and the urge to run back to his homework was strong. Still, he stuck it out, looking down on Lavender's beautiful upturned face longingly.
"Misters Malfoy and Potter, we are once again waiting on the two of you," said Mason. "Please do not continue to hold up my class."
Tuesday night found him writing an essay for Advanced Herbology on how the restorative properties of Mandrake Root and the detoxifying properties of bezoars could be combined and used as a highly effective cure for hangovers. He'd likely receive a few curt lines from Sprout about it. He and his semi-mentor didn't quite see eye to eye on the use of the plants that they both loved. She was always pursing her lips disapprovingly at his ideas for the use of powerful herbal remedies for common ailments. He could see the message scrawled in the footnotes now... "Honestly, Neville, Mandrake and bezoars? Would you waste such highly difficult to procure ingredients on the effects of stupidity and personal vice?"
"Good. Here you are," she handed each of them a small, plain leather-bound book. "You are dismissed, Mr. Malfoy. I want to have an additional word with Mr. Potter."
Harry tugged the front of his robes away from his body, his cheeks burning with embarrassment as he attempted to hide the evidence of just how advanced their assignment had gotten. Draco sat up and hugged his knees to his chest, staring toward the back of the booth miserably. His profile was to Harry, but his hair had fallen forward, curtaining any indication of what he was thinking.
"Horribly," he answered, secretly grateful that the Veritaserum had worn off. The thought that he was lying followed close behind, and Harry growled angrily into the pillow.
Draco was startled when a wall suddenly materialized between himself and Potter. For several moments after Potter had isolated himself, Draco stood at the wall, shouting demands and threats to take away House points for its immediate removal. Frustrated and a little insulted, he'd given up, flinging himself into a chair dejectedly and wondering why Potter had put the damn thing up in the first place.
Several people in the Gryffindor common room jumped and turned around, seeking out the cause of the disruption. A few people close by gave him confused, yet slightly interested glances.
Harry looked away, his jaw clenching as he glared at Fawkes, sleeping peacefully on his perch. When he looked back at Dumbledore with the question that he had to ask on his tongue, his voice wavered.
"She can't do this!" Hermione told a stoic Harry, who was laying on his bed and apparently quite happy to stare at absolutely nothing. "Look, I don't care if she does use the Goblet of Fire to choose names, you didn't put yours in!"
Hermione stared at him perplexedly for several moments before her mouth fell open in a small circle of surprise.
Draco nodded fervently, tugging on Harry's wrist and thrusting his hips forward.
Planting soft, open-mouthed kisses over the firm skin of Malfoy's throat, he worked his way down to his collar and back up. When he reached the highly sensitive earlobe, he drew it into his mouth and ran his tongue over. Draco gasped loudly and shifted beneath him, his body jerking with each lap of Harry's tongue. Too pleased with the reaction he was getting out of his partner to stop, Harry added a gentle nip. Draco fairly writhed underneath him, his chest heaving with shaky, stuttering breaths.
When Hermione and Ron glanced at each other before turning to look anywhere but at him, his stomach lurched disturbingly.
“You do not trust me.”
“It’s just a quotation,” Harry explained, but Malfoy didn’t appear to be listening.  He was prowling slowly around Harry, blatantly checking him out.
“Bye Mummy.  Bye Mr Potter.”
“I was a coward,” Harry said.
“Back we go.  Should I set you down, or do you want to stay in here with me?”
“What do you do with a computer anyway, Malfoy?”
Finally Draco said, “I think home will have to be somewhere with an orchard where my-cousin-your-godson can climb my apple trees.”
“What else can we do, then?  Take them home?”
Padma picked up the take-out bags and peered inside. “It should taste fine. Eat dinner with us, Harry? There’s plenty of food. Parvati always packs enough for leftovers because she knows we can’t cook.”
“You’re sure? There isn’t any lion-clawed scorpion-tailed human-headed beast coming to eat me?”
Potter came running.
Malfoy ‘s hand intercepted Harry’s.  His eyes bored into Harry’s face. They stood motionless until Malfoy’s face softened slightly and he moved Harry’s hand gently but firmly away.
“Oh, and I can get a bar of laundry soap from Mr Kaliwa’s shop.”
Potter rolled his eyes and headed back toward his room – but the door had vanished.  He groaned.  “Damn room, my door’s gone.”
When he came out a few hours later, Potter waved to him from the garden.  “Hey Malfoy, Neville left something for you.”
Time to go hunt up a nice plump English mouse.  Because really, there’s no taste like home.
“The war taught us that, I think,” Potter said slowly. “How to go away, to somewhere bearable, at least for a moment.”
“Well, goodhearted magical freaks are always welcome here. Let’s make a toast,” Andromeda said, “to the black sheep of the family!”
“Oh,” Draco breathed, as a tingling warmth bloomed inside him.
“You’re as bad as Hermione.  Go on, open yours.”
And revealed itself to be a dragon, a large green one with fiery batwings and three heads no less.
Then that nightmare strength savaged Draco’s family, trapped him in a spiral of torture.
“Just as well, I’d already used one of the best rhymes.”  Draco’s voice trailed off as he thought.  “Granger, danger.  Stranger, changer….arranger!”
Draco shrugged disarmingly. “Practice is necessary for any musician.”
.  I didn't invent the star names, though no one seems to know how Eta Draconis came to be called Booboo!
“That’s better,” she said.
Draco couldn’t help but be a little apprehensive—he didn’t look forward to dealing with any giant snakes or Hippogriffs. But surely the veterinarian would be trained in handling whatever turned up. And the treatment of their first patient seemed to have been a success. The Puffskein was busily scavenging up a meal of crumbs and dead spiders with its long pink tongue, and rooms were noticeably cleaner already.
He stroked Draco’s arm to get his attention.  “Where
Draco left his books in a corner and went for a fast walk, then came back and wrote feverishly.  When Harry brought him more treacle tart to refuel, he talked excitedly about a break-through on his thesis.  He’d gotten ink on his nose again.
“Let’s see how you handle my broomstick, then, Potter.”
Draco shook his head slightly. “It isn’t that. Just, uh, my thoughts went elsewhere.”
The view out the window mocked him – air, light, freedom.  He grabbed his wand and tried to spell a curtain across it.  Nothing happened.  Draco swore and the door swung open.  Through the door he saw Potter, also sitting on his bed.
“Is this… a delivery?” Potter asked, while Draco stared.  Potter tried to untie the parchment, but the knot had tightened so much he had to use a spell.  Rutherford left him to read it and flew to Draco’s shoulder. His hair needed preening.
“While you wait for your mer-centaur, how about a lazy liaison with me?”  said Harry.  He trailed a finger down Draco’s chest.
.  At first I thought she meant a story about an adventurous small dog, but it turns out to be someone named Darwin who got all excited about finches.  They had self-transfiguring beaks, or something.”
The moon rose over the horizon. Quietly the other Mooncalves emerged. The young Mooncalf with them stood quivering at attention and then stepped out from the shadows.
“Life treating you well these days, mate?  You look great!” Ron greeted him.
“Er – thanks,” said Harry, wondering what he would do with it.  “I guess I should return that laddie’s horse to him now.  Unless you want to ride it over and play a game of chess with him?  He might like some company.”
“You were working for Voldemort.”
Draco smiled.  “My mother used to sing it to me.  We called it the glow-worm song.  She thought there was more to it, but that’s all she remembered.  What did your – your aunt? –  sing to you at bedtime?”
“So what… are those feelings these days, exactly?”  Draco regarded him with grave eyes.
“Doesn’t the Ministry give you any funding for that?”
The Hippogriff snuck over to the food table and made off with some rock cakes, which made Hagrid laugh.
I need air. Shall we talk outside?”
Draco glanced at his friend, who was sprawled out on Draco’s couch with his feet up, reading.  A toe was poking out of one sock.
“Let me take my shoes off first.”
“Kreacher likes Harry Potter and the young master of the house of Black.  Kreacher is helping them.”
He felt obscurely angry. “You came back.”
“Ah!”  Understanding shone in her eyes.  “Did you ride, then?  Or do you drive?”
Harry looked more carefully at the mansion. He’d never seen Malfoy Manor from the back, but that could certainly be the house. Luna must have got the animal hospital’s coordinates wrong.
About a week later, Draco entered the Owlery and found Potter waiting as promised. “I got your message,” Draco said. “Why did you want to meet?”
Later, when they were alone, Harry murmured, “So, can I help you scratch that itch?”
“You know,” Harry said slowly, “I’m kind of an expert on scars.  And I think – I hope – that scars themselves are not ugly.  The curses that make them are.  But the scars just show what we have managed to survive.”
After that they had gone to Paris, and one evening as they were strolling and rolling along the streets, Harry had stopped, raised his head and said, “What’s that?”  They had followed the sound to a street corner where a lone musician played the sax.  Harry listened, entranced, and finally said, “I want to do that.”
It occurred to him to say so.
“No, not even Fern-green.  It’s pea-green like a galaxy.  Ahoy, Wuffley!”
Potter was laughing.  “I don’t really do that, it’s a poem.”
Harry came around more often. Draco was subdued.
Those gleaming eyes again, and laughter like the sun breaking through clouds, and Harry ran out of words.  All his brain could supply was
Malfoy glared at him for a few seconds longer, opened his mouth as if to speak, closed it again, then shut his eyes and sighed.  “Well.  It was a year of doing regrettable things.”  He looked down, then studied Harry’s face.  “Why would you want to see the scar?”
Harry shrugged his own cloak on and slung a scarf around his neck.  “Come on, you,” he said, handing Draco the package to hold and wrapping an arm around his waist. They both gripped the Portkey and activated it.
Harry bent over the headmaster, who was telling him in a faint voice to go find Snape and bring him there.  Harry ran down the stairs and disappeared.
One day Rutherford returned with a message.
“I turn out to have a talent for fixing magical objects, and I’m using my powers for good, Potter.  This way I can think of Katie Bell as ‘the witch with the broken Magic-wave oven and the bratty niece,’ instead of ‘the girl who I almost killed with a cursed necklace.’ I do Magical Repairs and Reparations.  Doesn’t have to be fixing appliances – I can do research and development, consulting, whatever.  I offered my services to anyone I felt I owed, from the war; some people took me up on my offer, and others, like you, didn’t.”
Harry just looked at him.
“Wait, Neville has a Thai boyfriend?” Harry said. Was everyone coming out now?
“How about you, Cousin Draco?”
“She had to leave to look for Blibbering Humdingers.  It’s their mating season in the Canary Islands.  She told me to start work on your roof when we got a stretch of sunny weather.”
“No, I think you only defeated the evil maniac because you had the luck and gall to steal my wand when I was injured.  Don’t fish, Boy Wonder.  And don’t look like you half believe what I just said.”
“You’re probably not, actually.”
Draco narrowed his eyes, recognizing a challenge.
“She’s in Australia,” Potter said finally. “With Ron.”
“Right, but there’s Medieval literature in French, there’s Latin…”
“So you’d appeal to your father’s bigotry.”
Malfoy leaning up on one elbow, haloed by bright hair, grey eyes questioning, luminous.
Oh.  Draco had never heard his name spoken with such awe, such need.  Heavy-lidded green eyes, gazing with such naked want, brought an answering ache of desire in him.
“No,” said the lassie.  “Why do you want to go there?”
“I’d love to,” Draco said.
The bear stretched and ambled forward.  After a while Harry rubbed it behind the ears, as he used to do with the neighbour’s dog, and it sighed.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Twinky.”
Harry bade her farewell, got on the new horse, and rode on until he saw a golden-haired lassie sitting and spinning a golden spinning wheel without any thread.  She had a dreamy look in her big googly blue eyes.
“Mostly monks,” Harry said. Well, and there had been a spry elderly Buddhist nun in a cave to the west of his hut, but he didn’t think that was what Ron meant. “How are your parents?”
And then he turned abruptly and squeezed his way into a single empty spot in the stands, leaving Harry to find his own place to sit, some distance away.
Harry hesitated. The Mooncalf needed help that he didn’t know how to give. And if Luna trusted Malfoy and this Æthelflæd person… But did she? Or had Luna not meant to send him here at all?
Draco looked doubtful.  “Why would you want me there?”
Then he saw a photo of Ginny in the sports pages. She was with some blonde girl – a Dutch Quidditch coach – and they were turning toward each other, laughing, wind ruffling their short-cropped hair.  When did Ginny cut her hair, he wondered, as he waited for the familiar dull ache of confusion and resentment and loss. It didn’t come.
“Why don’t you stay in for a while, Gabriel?  Here, you can have today’s copy of the
Draco leaned over Harry, pressing slow kisses. “But once caught… we Snitches have… flesh memory.”
“He who… something eye… something gent…”
Potter shook his head. “Not a thing.”
The eyes of Draco Malfoy were upon him, grey and gleaming.
8888888
“Outnumbered by Gryffindors three to one…”
Draco realised.  “Not funny,” he explained, and flicked the counter-jinx at her.
Yet somehow they had both come through it all, to stand here, brooms in hand in the spring sunshine.  Words left him.  Harry met Malfoy’s intent and silent gaze and held it until he felt something open inside himself.  As though he were soaring like a hawk on an air current, effortless, floating.
“I could have
“Not so successfully, no.”
It was good to sit with one of his oldest friends. It was hard to answer her questions, though – Harry had got used to living alone on a mountain with his nearest neighbours being monks and hermits. Long stretches of time went by when he didn’t talk with anyone, and when he did, it was in his broken Chinese. Now normal English conversation felt rushed, and by the time he had gathered his thoughts, Hermione or Padma were already filling the silence.
At which the contrary hero-he-was-tired-of-being-grateful-to opened the door again.  “Then what are you doing here?” Potter demanded.
“I need to talk with you,” Draco said.
“Decorate a lot of cakes, do you?”
“There were little wyverns engraved on the valve buttons. So I bought one.”
stupid, Potter.  You were deeply annoying, but he was….   I don’t even want to talk about it.”
“I’ll have to do
It was early enough not to be too hot yet, birds were singing, and a young man in dreadlocks, one of Malawi’s rare Rastafarians, was pushing off from the lakeshore in a dugout canoe.  Harry looked out past the green leaves and tropical blooms to the silver blue of the water, the soft blue of the sky.  Nkhata Bay was picture-postcard beautiful, but few tourists made it this far off the beaten track.  Most of the other guests at the small beachfront hotel and cabins were backpackers or, like Harry, volunteers taking an in-country holiday.  And most of them weren’t up yet – there’d been a lot of drinking and loud music ‘til well past midnight. So this morning was still peaceful, and with no lessons to plan or papers to mark until the next term began, Harry could relax.
“I couldn’t sleep.  I was just going out to look at the stars.”
Draco blinked.
Dumbledore had informed his Order that Draco and his family were to be protected, so after the funeral arrangements were made to hide them both.  Snape told Voldemort that the Order had learned of Draco’s intention to kill Dumbledore, and that they had lured Narcissa to Hogwarts on the pretence that Draco was ill, then killed both of them in revenge.
Feeling unexpectedly comfortable with this starlit Draco, Harry waved an arm at the sky and asked, “Where are you, then?  Up there, I mean?”
, Harry?”
Potter was surrounded by a ring of snowy white peacocks in full display, shaking their feathers menacingly and screaming.  He was firing off spells, which would only antagonise them further.  The ones behind him darted in to nip at his heels.
“Scared, Potter?”  No answer.  “Come on, that’s your cue to say ‘you wish.’”
A few things.  The last time he had played against Malfoy had been during their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry realised.  Before Sirius was killed.  Before Malfoy’s father was sent to Azkaban.  Harry’s last match against Slytherin, sixth year, had felt curiously flat without Malfoy on the pitch. Then came their confrontation in the bathroom, curses flying, Malfoy falling, his blood soaking into Harry’s clothes.  And after all that, the war.
“But is that what -”
“All right, get ready and get your pyjamas on.”
If we are the ones to hand him over, all will be forgiven.
But Malfoy had said something and now seemed to be waiting for an answer.
Like Snape had once been.  Harry remembered what he’d seen in the Pensieve, just before he gave himself up to Voldemort.  Snape, who Harry had been sure was his enemy, confronting Dumbledore - appalled that Dumbledore’s plan would mean Harry’s death.
“Yes – anything.”  The cacophony of rain loosened Draco’s restraint and he cried aloud in passion as Harry’s hot mouth closed over his straining cock.  He came quickly, slumping against the wall, eyes dark, face softened.
“Why does that not surprise me?”
Malfoy regarded him thoughtfully.  “Now and then, Potter, you actually have an interesting idea.”
Lucius Malfoy rose from a chair by the marble fireplace.  Physically, the man looked as Harry remembered first seeing him – tall and impeccably dressed, supremely self-assured, his hair a silver river down his back.  The sallow, shaking man he had become under Voldemort’s displeasure was sleek once more.
June 5, Mer-Castle Courtyard
pressuring Potter, was probably a better question. “Don’t read the newspaper, you’ll feel better,” Draco advised.
“What’s he doing with…”  Draco began, annoyed, but stopped because Greg was looking so distressed.  “Never mind.  It’s good you’re here.”
“Well, we know about ‘Sex After the Hex’,” Harry smiled, quoting the title of Draco’s workshop. He opened the case, got out a reed, and dropped it into a cup of water sitting on an end table.  “I thought we could also have sax before the sex.”
They chatted some more as they ate and then Padma excused herself to let them catch up.
And then Harry found himself back out in the darkness of the hallway.
"Like what?" Lavender evaded, hoisting her book protectively to cover her chest.
"Give those over!" Ron demanded, plopping down into the chair across from him. "I'm so buggered for this test. Do you know how long it's been since I've studied Charms?"
Harry looked away, suddenly uncomfortable.
Dumbledore's head shook, but with no neck it looked a bit strange. "It is not his tactical qualities that are of use to us, ladies, but his influence. You've seen the way the other Slytherins in his year defer to him. Where he goes, they will follow. If we can convince him to stay, the others will be no mean task. We cannot afford an entire generation of Death Eaters to swell Voldemort's ranks!"
"Great, after I got her to stop crying." Neville answered flatly, and Harry burst out laughing. Neville joined him after a moment and the two of them laughed together until their eyes watered. Harry shook his head and wiped away the moisture on his lashes.
Lavender shrugged and gave him a smug smile. "It's like having a secret identity. I like being mysterious."
"I never said you did," said Harry.
Draco's jaw clenched and he looked away before speaking. "Sorry. Old habits."
Harry's head snapped up suddenly and his eyes were hopeful. "Can you ask him for me? If I can drop the class, I mean?"
Harry swallowed and nodded, walking out of her office and on toward the Great Hall with a feeling of numb detachment.  He was going to have to shag Malfoy. Repeatedly.
"What? But Professor," Hermione stared at her incredulously. "Harry never gave his permission to be enrolled!"
"Uhm, no?" Neville ventured.
Harry clapped his hand into Malfoy's outstretched palm and gave it a hearty shake. The Slytherin used his grip to tug Harry closer and kiss him. Harry blinked, moaned, and closed his eyes. A cooperating Malfoy was definitely a much better Malfoy.
"I'm not scared," he said bitterly. "Of Voldemort, his army of Death Eaters and Dark Creatures, the war. None of it really frightens me. But this... this thing with Malfoy. It terrifies me."
Padma Patil's hand went into the air and Mason called on her to speak.
Something in her tone put an end to Malfoy's infuriated tantrum and he swallowed and nodded, gathering his books with halting, jerky movements before he slumped into the chair next to Harry and immediately scooted as far away as the table allowed. Harry sat down slowly, staring at his white-knuckled hands on the table in shock.
He hadn't truly realized what he'd said until he heard Malfoy's quiet "okay", and felt a warm pressure settle onto his lap. Jerking his arm away from his face so quickly that he almost hit the other boy, he stared incredulously up at Malfoy.
Unnerved and deeply shaken by the openness that they'd just shared, Harry sank lower in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. After a few moments, Draco shifted in his seat, the creak of springs loud in the silence.
Peering through the crack he saw McGonagall and Professor Mason sitting in front of the fire, seemingly deep in conversation. Another, deeper voice came from the direction of the fireplace, and Harry leaned to the left in order to see Dumbledore's flaming green head sitting in the hearth.
The flap to their booth lifted and emitted a slender pale form. Harry stared in growing apprehension at Malfoy for several moments, weighing the possibility of reaching his Invisibility Cloak before the other boy's eyes adjusted to the dark. No chance. If he moved he'd be heard, and Malfoy knew about the cloak.
Closing his eyes, Harry clenched his traitorous jaw closed and tried not to think about what he'd just revealed. When no scathing retort came from the other side of the room, though, he quickly snatched up the opportunity to return the humiliating favor in kind.
Harry chuckled and Draco squirmed, the sound vibrating warmly close to his ear. "That's for next week."
"I have very sentitive ears..."
Harry and Draco looked at one another, both of their expressions defiant. Neither wanted to be the one to assign themselves the 'girl' role in this exercise.
"Come, come! You're in a Sex Magic class. If you can't handle a little hand-holding, then I dread how you'll feel about the rest of the assignments!" Professor Mason scolded them.
"In you go, Mr. Potter," she sighed. "He'll inform you of your instructions."
"Hm?" Harry murmured distractedly. "Oh, yes. The- the kissing."
"Lemon drop," a thin, reedy voice said from above him.
"Oh, clever," Draco grumbled, turning and walking over to their booth.
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "That'd be just like him."
He paused, looking grave as he formed his next words. His eyes met Harry's and the younger man felt something inside of him recoil at the grim solemnness in the once twinkling gaze.
"Harry, are you...?"
Harry winced. Sometimes Neville's grandmother could be a real hag.
"Well, that all changed when you got my father in jail," Draco paused and made a disgusted sound. "You know, as if it wasn't enough that you had to be so bloody perfect! Better at everything, getting away with breaking rules, the famous Boy Who Lived making the front page of the Prophet every other day... Then you had to go and take away the one thing in my life that made me feel that I had something over you."
"That was harsh, mate," said Ron from where he sat cross-legged on his bed.
He heard Draco shouting at his back in a high, trembling voice, deducting the maximum points possible as a Prefect from Gryffindor.
Nodding mutely, Harry followed him up the winding staircase to his office, which was as oddly quaint as always. Harry had to turn away when Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk, so out of place did the frail, gray old man look amidst the clicking, sighing shiny objects and colorful portraits around him. He might have been a pile of ash against the bright red leather of his chair.
Harry blinked, thrown, before answering. "I honestly didn't think to bring it up."
"Yes. I mean, you were. Warm, that is," Harry said lamely, and felt the rest of it coming before he could stop it. "And you smelled good. And I just wasn't comfortable that it was youpressed up against me. It was weird, and sort of scary."
"Let go!" Harry shouted, heaving backwards.
"Me first, Scarhead!" Draco shoved in front of Harry and stood in front of Professor Mason, arms crossed over his chest as he stared at her angrily. "I demand a partner change."
by the terrible force of his want- is this what Vernon felt?  Because he might understand, might possibly- if Malfoy were spread out under him- could he? Would he?  And Harry’s running.
He memorizes Dark curses, spells for expelling entrails, spells for leaving the victim drowning in their own blood.  When he coughs, he half-expects to leave Darkness behind.
“We were in Slytherin’s Chamber, it seemed appropriate.” Harry quips, and his eyes fall on the cave-in. He’d cleared away the rubble, but he couldn’t grow the walls back again.  “Lockhart tried to attack us,” Harry continues, words cool, “Tried to wipe our memories and erase our minds, it was the only thing he knew how to do, really-”
She gives him a sharp-edged smile, the sort he’d been taught to craft at the tender age of six,

Potter’s voice is amused.  “I assure you, I’m not.  We’ll have to be quiet- Myrtle can get kind of loud.”
Harry slips out of his shirt, the thin cotton twisting between his fingers, and observes the bruises on his body.  Not above the shirt, never above the shirt, no one can know.

“And where, exactly, did you hear that?” Blaise asks, ever the skeptic.
Potter leans in and-
Harry swallows, dry.  Should he say something?  Maybe-
It doesn’t work at first, it needs more of a kick, so Draco casts a Dark Magic stasis charm, one intended for preserving bodies, and the bruise slows and settles finally, peevishly.
“Oi, I’ve got it.  That nasty git, Kreacher, might’ve done something- wouldn’t be the first time a house elf blocked Harry’s mail, would it?”
This is madness, but Harry’s never been one for rationality.  The whole Chamber is heavily warded, Harry tells him, so any sort of magic, even Unforgivables, can be performed and the general Hogwarts wards won’t catch it.  He sees the silver gleam in Malfoy’s eyes.
and then it’s over and Harry’s shaken and hollow and slinking to the back of the classroom, his cloak of Notice-Me-Not’s settling over him like driftwood.  It doesn’t have to make sense, he thinks. Just-

It sends a sweeping flood of desolation over him because hasn’t this happened before, innocent men in Azkaban, the Ministry’s creeping fug of riddled corruption and plump greedy hands grasping for public approval?  He feels a spurt of desperate longing for the Muggle world with its checks and balances and judicial votes and multitudes of different newspapers that aren’t bought out by the government.

(Kreacher Silences the area around them.  He will save the screams for later, perhaps keep them in a vial of a sort and gift them to his Master for Yule.)
Harry inhales, sharply, pulse juddering through his throat, mind going blank with desire.
Harry says inwardly, and takes a seat.
- He’s half-arched up the bed now, hips canting up as he fucks into his hand over and over, eyes slitting shut helplessly. A film reel of images- Potter by the lake, Gryffindor tie slung casually around his neck, the collar of his shirt undone and hanging loose, collarbones golden and arching in the sunlight; Potter diving for the Snitch, hair wind-slaked to his scalp, robes slick against his skin with rain; Potter under the Hogsmeade sunlight, smile warm and easy and open, an arm slung around a friend’s shoulders.

When you live a miserable childhood, you separate, perhaps subconsciously, your existence into ‘life’ and ‘not-life’.  Harry does not count the Dursley’s as his life.  They did nothing for him, he learned nothing, he accomplished nothing, he felt nothing. (Feels nothing.) A miserable existence spent in misery, an ever-extinguishing equation of dull discontent.

It comes out huskier than he means it to, rough and low and loose, and there’s a flush on his cheekbones and really, this could have all happened at a better time, when he’s not easy and relaxed with the heady rush of not a single person recognizing him running through him like particularly fine wine.

Saorise hisses in delight and leaps on it, her fangs ripping the tissue-thin petals to wet shreds.  Draco stares in silence, and then shrugs.  It doesn’t matter that much, does it.
Harry pushes them down; he doesn’t need them now.
(Exhaust, he thinks.  He’s exhausted.  He’s never liked children. He loathes them, actually; in every one of their cocksure smirks he sees James Potter and Sirius Black, in every one of their idolizing gazes he sees Peter Pettigrew, in every one of their stuttering cowardliness he sees Remus Lupin and the yellow seething eyes at the end of the tunnel, roaring for blood denied and fought for, in every radiant beam he sees Lily Evans, before she was polluted by the besotted cloying arrogance of Potter, and it is exhausting.  He has had enough of his past, had enough of remembrances, had enough of figurines that moved in predetermined pathways across the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, had enough.  His life is a tragedy in its emptiness.  There is nothing here to give light, has never been for over two decades, and he looks at his students with the cold pitiless eyes of a crow and carves his mark on them with his hooked nose and yellow-stained fingers and uncaring brilliance.)

Malfoy’s eyes widen.
She emits an annoyed hiss, and Draco laughs, conjures a few white mice for her.  He has to get back to his poisons, he has to plan.  He’d originally thought of the lemon drops that the old fool is so fond of, but he offers them to every student who enters his office, and Draco is many things, but not a murderer.
Draco watches as the right side of Sev’s mouth drifts up in unwilling amusement.  He slams it down as soon as he sees Draco’s grin, scowling.
Draco breathes.  He- he breathes.  The bruise feels like it’s constricting sometimes and he can’t- Bruise-Healing paste, even at ten times the strength (courtesy of Severus) only fades it a tiny bit.  (He counts it as a win and vows to apply it every night, because a little bit is still something, but. Still.)

Harry closes his eyes, running a absent hand over the wet, prickling, grass.  “Kreacher,” Harry utters tonelessly.

She looks up. “Might I be able to meet your snake?”

A hissing laugh; “Rise.” Draco concentrates on his Occlumency barriers, smoothing on curses; here, a curse that’ll freeze the blood in your veins; here, a curse that’ll turn every bone in your body to dust.  His face is expressionless; the consummate pureblood son.

Draco tells himself, and he doesn’t even blame Potter- he’s disgusting, a monster has touched this skin, bruised him, Marked him.). Still, how had he been so foolish, how could he?  He’s a fucking Death Eater, and he’s just kissed (admittedly, it’s not likely he’ll tell, like that’s any sort of condolence) Harry fucking Potter. He- Circe and - and - Merlin. Merlin.
Draco does not envy the Dark Lord a lot of things, but for Parseltongue.
Because there he is, Britain’s Savior, perched demurely at the Ravenclaw table, engaged in a conversation with Luna Lovegood.

Blaise and his mother are both lilith, which are cousins of the veela, with a powerful, dangerous, allure- not one that controls attraction precisely, but that wreaks havoc on the mind, the senses.  Draco supposes he should be grateful for the fact that Blaise stopped it before it got to his other senses.
Well.  To those people, I say, first of all: how 'bout you put your mailing address in the comments so I can mail you a nice big basket of

He feels something of Tom in him, a lazy unbridled satisfaction.
Potter raises his wand, the levering of his wand arm akin to the raising of a drawbridge. It’s abrupt, and Draco starts.
“Alright-
“Stay here, Saorise.” Draco murmurs, glaring at her when she hisses.  He doesn’t want the Dark Lord to know about her, something about the idea of a Parselmouth he does not trust- trust

and Malfoy is standing in front of him, critical laconic gray eyes sweeping the area.
- and calls for Potter.
“Thank you, my Lord.” Narcissa says smoothly, and Lucius echoes the statement, albeit more stiffly.
“God, stop,” Draco chokes out, pressing the flat of his palms against his eyes, because this is utterly mortifying.
?  He’d fallen into the Veil, and Potter had almost followed him so distraught he had been, wasn’t that so wonderful?
“Stop,” Harry murmurs over and over and over, pressing his knuckles into his mouth and relishing in the bite of teeth on skin, the shocking sting, teeth cutting past skin

The thought or Sirius makes him feel simultaneously angry and empty- emptier than the norm, that is.
Eventually, they select one snake.  She’s bright yellow and about as thick as three arms.  Harry bends down, making eye contact.
“It is almost being time, Master Potter!” An elf squeaks, and Harry gets up, hurriedly sweeping crumbs off his lap and attempting to clean up after himself- the elves flood around him and rid the mess with a few brisk snaps.
Draco remained quiet and under any other circumstances, Harry might have let it get by. If the two of them hadn't ingested a truth-telling potion. The stray thought that perhaps Draco wasn't saying anything because he couldn't without revealing more than he'd like squirmed into Harry's mind and wouldn't leave. "You do, don't you?"

Draco remembers the dementors, remembers hearing of Potter’s fainting fit.  They’d all felt it, even the Slytherins, that sense of dull horror-

While he is, he contemplates the problem that is avoiding his two very best friends, who constitute basically his entire social circle.

Harry sits up, curls up in his nest of blankets.  He is shivering; he’s not cold.
(Blood magic is how he’d segued into the Dark Arts- he’d been looking for a way to protect himself without his wand, his wandless magic not being impressive enough to protect him at all hours of the day, and he’d stumbled across a book on blood magic in the Restricted Section, back in third year.  Blood magic was ‘Dark’, was ‘evil’, but if it protected him, how evil could it be?  Harry had made a duplicate of the book and hidden it in his robes.  After that, he’d kept going, wandering to the Restricted Section in his Cloak as soon as he’d determined that Ron was asleep, devouring books on the Dark Arts, making copies of absolutely everything relevant and tucking it in his trunk.)

Harry swallows and nods, drawing his wand from his waistband.  He feels the leaping magic at his fingertips, rushing into his wand with eager avidity.  Harry opens his mouth, closes it. Nonverbal.

The Potions classroom is dark as ever, but slightly cleaner, the desks shinier and the walls practically wallpapered in posters of famous celebrities, who’d attended Slughorn’s ‘Slug Club’.  Slughorn’s aesthetics, Harry can only imagine.  (He wonders what Snape would think and scoffs to himself.)
“If you touch me in this room,” Harry spits, “You will be burned.”  He adds a silent

Blood, blood and Potter’s eyes so green so
He plays favorites like you wouldn’t believe; he hates Slytherins and purebloods, though he comes from an ancient line himself.  He claims to be unprejudiced, but Draco knows better.
Vernon is getting hungry again; Petunia is going away for a week to see an old friend and Dudley is hardly ever in the house anymore.  He’s been relying on the locks on his door but Vernon could break down the door easily and it’s for that reason that Harry’s erected rudimentary blood wards around his room.
“I’m just.  Going to-” Even as he coughs the words out, he knows it’s no use.  Hermione’s wand is quick as a viper and Ron knows the passageways just as well as he does; he’s not getting away from them anytime soon.
Harry knows how that feels.  He used to feel the same way, like he- or, rather the mask he wore - was close to breaking- on the brink of breaking- broken.  Now that it is, what is left is a total absence, a desolated plain, and it’s freeing.  He wonders what Malfoy would look like, free.
Okay, some people might wonder:
He remembers the first time.  Aunt Petunia and Dudley had been out of the house, shopping for his new Smeltings uniform (since his diet, his physique had changed considerably), and Harry had just ventured out of his room for a piece of toast- and then Uncle Vernon was there, a strange glint in his eye, a magazine full of lurid busty women in his paws, a bulge in his gray slacks.
Vernon doesn’t come that night, although Harry stays awake all night for fear of it.
Draco inhales, want shuddering through him like blood in systole. He responds in a slick, smooth, hiss, and Harry-
