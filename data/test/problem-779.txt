“I’m joking. I’ll be nice about it,” he said. He kicked at her trainer playfully. “You’re sure there’s nothing else? No other massive bombs to drop on me? Did Al join a cult or did Lily get her bellybutton pierced or anything?”
“Yes, me too. I missed the purple couches so much.”
Draco shrugged. “Tell him. I think it will put this in perspective.”
“Now answer again with a lie. Do you have any children?”
Harry went to visit the property on Tuesday, and it was nearly as breathtaking as the Sanctuary in Romania. The mountains weren’t as dramatic, and the trees weren’t dense pine spread so thickly over the land that you could hardly see the sun when you were underneath them, but the sky was open and blue overhead, the mountains stretching for miles in every direction, the ground soft and green, the lake cold and clear. The castle was like something out of myth, jutting out over the lake, its pale stones glowing pink against the setting sun. Harry spent the whole day there and didn’t see any of the Hebridean Blacks, but he did learn that there was a monster living in the lake, and he thought he possibly caught a glimpse of its sinuous back as it dove. It looked like it was covered in purple spikes.
but they’re definitely together. They’re just complete commitment phobes. They live in an enormous house in the country these days, and throw a lot of great parties.
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I?”
Harry told Pansy the whole sob story over negronis, which were one of Harry’s favorite cocktails to make when he felt like getting fucked up. During negroni number one, Pansy cried out over the injustice of Euri storming out and told him Euri was a fool for not letting Harry do things at his own pace. Harry, in turn, found himself in the bizarre position of arguing on behalf of Euri, explaining that they had been spending a ton of time together and he could see how Euri thought it was getting serious.
The day of the thirtieth finally arrived, full of sunshine that betrayed the danger awaiting them. It was a typical summery day, hot by midmorning, with barely a breeze to be found. After breakfast, Draco approached Hermione where she sat with a book on hand-crafted cauldrons, of all things. She looked over at him, surprised, when he sat down next to her on the sofa. “Sorry to interrupt your reading,” he said quietly.
“You should go for it. You’re not getting any younger, you know.”
“I almost died, seeing you like that,” Harry said against his mouth. Draco was running his hands over Harry’s muscled back, along his hips, back up to his neck; he wanted to touch everything, anything, all of it. “In the pink water, your face tipped back and your mouth open, your body spread out like that, touching yourself. Thinking of me. God, you’re so fucking beautiful.”
“Oh,” said Harry. “It is?” He’d imagined it would be the opposite of hot.
? That’s a
“Shit, sit down, okay?” he said, guiding Harry to a chair. “It’s okay. It’ll be okay.”
He could almost make out the shape of things based on the intensity of the vibrations. It was like the thermal imaging spell that Aurors sometimes used, though the image was just in his mind, based solely on sensation.
Before she fell asleep, she thought about whether she would ever be loved in the way Daphne’d described. She wanted to be. She really did.
Draco blinked at her. “You’d do that?”
“Not all of us get to have perfect relationships and fancy engagement parties that feature in the society pages of the Prophet.”
Draco and Harry visit the site of another portal, and catch a glimpse into another world
Harry didn’t bother replying, but sent a wandless, wordless
“Oh? And what would you have done?” Draco asked, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, sorry. But you’re the only one I can really talk to about it.”
He put on his shoes and socks while he was waiting for the doors to open, and when he got on, he pulled out his phone.
He cooked up some spaghetti Bolognese and when he came back out to the living room to tell them it was ready, Charlie was seated on the ground by Draco’s head and he still had his hand on Draco, petting him gently, and they were talking quietly.
They had reached the rose garden, spelled to bloom all night tonight. It smelled divine. Pansy’s stilettos crunched along the gravel path that wound through the garden as she tried not to sink into the soil beneath. “So, spill.”
“Good evening, spirits of the Family Black,” intoned a voice from the other room by the floo.
“You – you did?” Draco managed.
“Temper, Draco,” she said, laughing. “No need to throw a strop.”
“One what?” asked Draco.
Potter smiled. “No, you prat. I just wanted to talk to him.”
At half past two, there was a knock on his door. Unspeakable Lewis, most likely, checking on Draco’s progress.
lovely, so thank you, I suppose. But that’s not why I’m here.”
a lot worse.
“The rest of the herd charged, heads down, aiming for flesh. The creature was rolling, spreading, and roaring through its cavernous mouths. The unicorns only fought harder. It was a vicious scene, and soon the surface of the beast was painted with its own green blood and the bright silver blood of the unicorns.
“Oh,” Draco said archly. “You mean you’re not going to fuck me in front of a dozen of our closest friends?”
They told the truth. Mostly. They left out the part about their affair during the campaign, because, well, it wasn’t exactly a good look.
“Of course,” he said, tilting his chin up.
“And who are they?”
“Potter, who you fancy is your own business. I have no right to judge it, and even if I did, I wouldn’t find it unacceptable. I don’t think it’s…I don’t have a problem with it. At all. So.”
“No. I didn’t. Not then; not until after I asked. I brought it up because I could tell Harry liked
“Draco, wait! Hang on,” Harry called.
“But I really do like him. He’s incredibly sweet, and he’s handsome, and he likes me and I never have to worry about whether he does. He wants to be with me.”
“So –” Draco began.
Harry stared out at the yellow glow of the nearest streetlight and for one moment, one brief, unguarded moment, he wished he hadn’t done what he’d done. Wished he had waited like he’d said he would. Wished Draco was here with him now, in his arms.
“No, no," Draco said. "I’m not “The Dragon”. I simply said that my name means dragon. It’s…I was just being silly.” Merlin, he could kick himself for it, too.
They decided on curry and brought it back to Harry’s, where they ate on the couches and watched a couple of movies on Harry’s television, which Seamus, who was quite good with electronics, had fixed to operate on magic instead of electricity (since Godric knew, Grimmauld Place did not have electricity, and the house probably wouldn’t allow it to be installed, even if Harry ever wanted to take on that task.).
“I know,” Harry said, yawning again. He gave Draco’s head a kiss and reached over and clicked off the little reading light he kept clipped to the headboard. “Oh, hey, I swear I’ll do the dishes in the morning. I was too tired tonight.”
That wasn’t entirely true, though. He still thought of Harry plenty on those nights that he wasn’t sleeping. He’d taken to sleeping in a guest room, and Astoria hadn’t asked why. He wondered if she knew why. He wondered why she hadn’t said anything.
“Yes,” you say, thinking this is probably the most he’s said to you since Hogwarts, when you were screaming at one another to fuck off and die several times a day. “Yes, please.”
Crave you back with me
The pretty witch at the stand gave him a grin. “I know who you are, Mr. Potter, goodness. Right this way.”
“Uhhh,” Harry said, pushing him gently away after a moment. “What are we talking about?”
“Oh, no, that’s fine,” said Harry, practically running out. The sun had set, so it was less bright out on the balcony than it was in the house, and cooler, with a slight breeze. Harry slipped between a few people he didn’t know and took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of night-blooming flowers. He took a sip of his drink and leaned against the railing and willed his heartbeat to slow.
“Yes, of course,” William said, smiling over at him. “Don’t all men?”
“You liked it?” asked Draco.
“You think I want you just because your life’s not perfect at the moment? You don’t think I just…want you?”
He wanted to see Rom and Hermione. Not to talk about this, but just to see them, to feel the camaraderie and easy company that had carried him through the last seven-plus years. Only they were probably in Ron’s room, which was also Draco’s room, which was also Blaise’s room.
?” she said, kissing his cheek. “I was worried sick! I was two seconds away from owling your father.”
“It’s not a common thing, Granger. You shouldn’t have. And besides, feeling guilty isn’t going to help him.” He leaned close, and said, quietly, into her ear: "I think we should try this." For whatever reason, the fact that this fellow was wizard-adjacent made Draco feel much more confident about the whole thing. He understood, at least. He would understand what Harry was.
, and glanced down over Malfoy’s long limbs again, taking in the graceful shape of them, the angles of his hip bones, the breadth of his shoulders.
“I know,” Harry said, pressing his forehead to Draco’s. “I meant it, too.”
“Divya looks beautiful,” whispered Hermione.
Up above ground, the sun was dizzyingly bright and everyone was talking. It was rather chaotic.
Draco looked at her, puzzled. “No?”
“The basis of all human fears, he thought. A closed door, slightly ajar.”
“I can’t help you if you’re not honest with me,” said Hermione, peeling his hands away.
It was mad, to think that they might be friends now. Madder still, to consider that they might be more than friends, although Harry wasn’t sure of that. He’d never been very good at these things. Ginny had to practically hit him over the head with it to get him to understand that she liked him. And Pansy had come straight out and propositioned him, which certainly cut through the confusion. And Cho…Harry shuddered, thinking about what a disaster that had been.  No, Harry wasn’t very good at matters pertaining to the heart, at understanding what things meant or didn’t mean.
be drawn to Fodor’s, the git. That’s what the Dursleys had always preferred, despite not having the money to stay at any of the hotels listed inside. Draco could, though. He could afford, probably, anything in there, and even better. Harry realized, with a start, that he probably could, too. He always forgot about that, that he had plenty of money now.
Draco grinned wickedly, pushing his hair back. “Clubs. Bars. You know. Places to cause trouble. There are a few nearby, but Pansy says they’re rather tame.”
And Malfoy must be really fucking strong to do that, too.
Draco stared at Potter open-mouthed.
“Oh, hey,” Harry said, looking at Charlie’s broad smile. It looked the same as ever.
“Went to Blaise’s. He had a big to-do.”
She smiled. “I am, a bit.”
“Because you look like you’re from the mountains,” said the man, smiling. He had a very nice smile, to go with the rest of his very nice face.
“I thought maybe…” Harry looked at him. “Maybe we could talk about it. Since the Draco thing doesn’t seem to be working out.”
“Date,” Potter grumbled. “That wasn’t a date, Malfoy. That was a booty call.”
“Have you seen him much?”
on,” Harry said, having to bite the inside of his cheek again. “I can’t. I never would’ve jeopardized our friendship if I’d been in my right mind.”
“I’ll do some snooping. Find out what’s going on with Draco.”
Kerrick nodded.
“You want me,” Potter murmured, his mouth brushing against Draco’s skin, making him shiver. He slid his fingers over Draco’s hole, and Draco let out a cry. “Tell me you want me.”
“Because she’s a fucking slag?” Draco said, jumping up so that he was of a height with Potter. It felt better, to be at his level.
“I hate that I don’t have a good reason to punch you in the face anymore.”
“Sure,” he said, kissing her. She grinned and collected some pajamas and walked back with him, holding his hand. And then they’d opened the door, and there was Draco, sitting on the floor against his bed, and he turned, smiling tightly, and then saw Ginny and Harry. Harry knew the exact moment Draco saw their joined hands, because all the color drained from his face.
“Haha, very funny,” said Ginny. “He punched him in the face because he thought he was trying to take advantage of me, but Draco’s gay. He wasn’t doing anything wrong. I’m the one who was tickling
“Hi,” Draco said, looking everywhere but at Harry. He cleared his throat, and Harry thought he meant to say something, but he didn’t. They walked through the office together, out into the cold night, slipping on their jackets once they felt the chill in the air. It was mid-April, but it had been a cold spring so far. There was fog spreading over the streets, casting the world in a gloomy haze, dulling the glow of the streetlights. Harry could feel it on his skin when he walked, wet and thick.
“You are,” agreed Harry, passing the not-cigarette back. “Dean loves you. He’s not going to get sick of you. But he might eventually get sick of all this drama.”
“I love seeing you too, mother,” he said, standing and giving her a kiss on the cheek. “Thank you for tea. And for the talk.”
“Lumos,” he whispered, even though he could mostly make out the shapes that were lying motionless on the concrete.
“Please don’t,” Harry said into the pillow, giggling. “I need to feel a little more than your eyes on my arse at the moment.”
“Yeah, I think….” said Draco.
“No, you,” said Potter, looking at Draco earnestly. “I don’t mind the floor. I swear.”
an anxious wanker,” she continued. “And he
Live while I breathe
His ears were ringing as he made his way down the hall. He’d only been in Malfoy’s sitting room last time, but the hall was much the same, with blindingly white walls and bright, colorful paintings. There was a long Persian rug running the length of it, and a bookshelf at the end, full of muggle books, of all things, and photographs. Malfoy with Pansy in many of them. And Goyle and Zabini and some other Slytherins that Harry recognized from school.
Edwin’s eyes narrowed. “What did you let him do to you?” he asked, his voice menacing. “Did he have you suck his prick? Did he fuck your little cunny?”
“Mostly, yes,” she said, and he could hear the smile in her voice. “In my estimation at least.” She patted his head. “But we all have our shortcomings. You included.”
“We’ll work our way up to the crypts. Or down, as it were.”
“Okay. Nap first,
Potter frowned. “I dunno. Probably?”
“Would you please come here,” Blaise said again, patting the spot on the bed next to him. They were in their room, alone. Granger and Weasley left after they brought Blaise back from his visit to Madam Pomfrey, and Justin Finch-Fletchley was, as usual, nowhere to be found. Draco was fairly certain that Finch-Fletchley and Hannah Abbott had broken up, so he had no idea where he went nowadays.
“So,” echoed Malfoy.
All my favorite people make me mad (so mad)
“But why is it so hard to forgive?' Mrs. Conners asked.
He pulled away. “I need to kiss somebody, Pans.” She smirked. “Not you.” She stuck her tongue out at him. “Or get fucked in a loo, maybe.
“Are you sleeping any better, Harry?” Hermione asked, as she cut her slice of pizza into meticulously uniform bits.
“Fine. Weird, definitely. Haven’t seen him since the trials, you know.”
as though you were fourteen, did you?”
The guy grabbed his coat, looking none too pleased.
It was foolish, Draco thought, because the men on the edges and in the rear quickly formed walls with their shields, so all the Stags managed to do was thin their lines. In a mock battle, if you reached the end of the opponent’s line, you won. Edwin had just managed to cut the Badgers’ work in half.
Malfoy sighed. “I understand.”
“You know I do a lot of my research in the Time Room, yes?”
They shook hands firmly. “You ought to get out there, by the way. Guests are beginning to arrive. I’ve got to go, too; bridesmaid duty calls.”
“Like sex?”
“God, could he have been more obvious?” Harry huffed, seriously annoyed. “And what am I, a light fixture? He didn’t even acknowledge me.”
It started to rain after a while, and he kept walking, despite his exhaustion. The water felt good on his hot skin.
Malfoy shrugged and played with the hem of Harry’s shirt, and Harry couldn’t help but brush back a stray lock of white-blond hair that had fallen into his eyes. “I’m not saying I think it will necessarily work out or anything. I just don’t have any desire to let that stop me from finding out.”
“You certainly are,” Draco said. “And I don’t know where you get off being such a sanctimonious prick. You were
, Draco thought.
. But I need to know the answer, and I need you to tell me the truth, okay?” He looked at Draco, green eyes burning. “Do you still have feelings for Blaise? Yes or no?”
“Jesus,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair, certain he looked like a complete disaster. He looked down at the tray and sighed happily. A lovely fry-up, eggs over medium, just the way he liked them. “Thank you,” he said, taking a bite of bacon. It was thin and crunchy, which he’d actually grown to like during his time in Chicago, even though it had seemed strange at first. “When’d you get up?”
“No word yet?”
(although Draco had, admittedly, snogged the intern later that night under the same mistletoe just to even things out).
“Your revenge plan that is not in any way making you happy? The one that you no longer need because you’ve already moved on from Ernie? That plan?”
“Understandable,” she said. “He’s wonderful.” Now, finally, she looked a tiny bit emotional. He was watching her closely, otherwise he wouldn’t have seen the little flinch or the way her eyes went shiny for a moment.
“Come for me, Harry,” Malfoy said gently, and something about the way his name sounded on Malfoy’s tongue had Harry rushing towards his edge, and a moment later, Harry was coming and crying out. Malfoy came immediately then, like he had been waiting, and Harry felt the strange, beautiful sensation of being filled with his spunk, hot and wet and dripping. He shivered and let out a long breath and and pulled Malfoy towards him, holding him close.
“You alright there, mate?” asked Potter, looking amused.
“You didn’t,” Charlie said quietly. “It seemed at the time like it would be sort of awkward, you having just broken up with Ginny and all. But later, I heard that she and Neville were getting serious pretty fast, and so I thought, maybe it wouldn’t be all that awkward after all. I thought when I came this time we might, ah, talk about it. Or do something about it.” He smirked. “Whichever.”
But Draco was just shaking his head. “Don’t make this worse. Please, do not. I don’t want to
She liked Draco, or at least what she knew of him. He came off as serious and a little stuffy, but last night he’d let loose a bit and Sarah’d caught a glimpse of how fun he could be. And she’d seen how he was with Harry, which, she had to admit, was very cute. But she worried. She was scared for Harry. There were so many ways this could go wrong, and the chances of it going right were pretty small. But for Harry’s sake, she hoped the two of them defied the odds and figured it out.
Felix and his friends found a vacant space against one of the glass barriers that overlooked the lower level, and, still chatting and laughing, began to dance. Penny was floaty, just like she had been downstairs, and Eloise began to dance very low to the ground, shaking her arse in a way that was quite unexpected, and sort of explained her x-rated artwork. Within moments some muscley, tattooed guy was dancing close behind her. Robbie and Felix moved around the way blokes tended to, but they didn’t look half bad doing it.
“I’m only offering you the same hospitality you offered us.”
!” he cried, letting her pull him back into the writhing crowd.
“Well, do you feel better now that you know for certain that you aren’t taking advantage of me?”
you, you tosser.”
Draco looked at him in dismay. Of course Potter’s magic had overpowered Draco’s.
“Okay. But maybe it is, though, at least a bit. I have some interest in you and Astoria being okay, like I said, and I have a fuckton of interest in whether Harry’s okay. We may not have talked much the last few years, but he’s still my best mate. He’s still a brother to me. I love that git more than I love most of my own brothers, actually. So, maybe it is kind of my business.”
Unfortunately, he was positive it wouldn’t play out like one of them. Not with the way things were between them.
“Probably,” said Ron, laughing. “Knowing us.”
, with her ever-expanding cleavage.
He sighed. “That’s intense, for a Saturday night.”
“So, Lavender wants to hook us up because we’re both bi. Sorry. I know it’s weird,” he said, quietly. He was a strange guy, Harry’d always thought so, although he hardly had room to call anyone strange considering his life nowadays. But Corner was always quiet like this, always intense, his dark eyes sharp in his pale face. Attractive – Harry understood why Ginny’d had a bit of a thing for him at one point – but in a very particular way, sort of vampire-meets-opium-fueled-poet. He looked like someone who spent a lot of time brooding in vaguely Victorian, candlelit rooms.
He floo-called work on Tuesday and asked Ron’s assistant if he could speak to Ron directly. “Hey, mate,” said Ron, his face appearing in the flames. “Tell me you’re not calling in sick again.”
“I’m afraid I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco said.
But the karkadan was faster than she was; it leapt away, easily avoiding the blade. It huffed again, plumes like smoke drifting up from its nostrils, and then it let out a low whinny.
Beside Harry, Draco was humming with purpose. He had to break things off with Astoria today. He could hardly believe what Harry had said.
Harry’s mind whirled. There were reasons, he was sure of it. “Maybe we could date, I don’t know. Maybe it would be fine.” He had the sneaking suspicion that it wouldn’t be.
“Oh, they will!” Parvati said. “You’ve just got to give them a little nudge in the right direction.”
He thought about the night before, about Malfoy riding him, and was instantly hard again. He groaned and his head fell back against the wall. Fuck, Malfoy was so sexy. Everything about him, his expressions, his mouth, his shoulders, his hair, his clothes, his long limbs and his lean muscles and his thick pink cock. Harry wondered, if he were to start dating Malfoy for real, whether he would ever stop feeling like this. It felt like it might get exhausting after a while, to be this damn horny all the time. Maybe they’d have to fuck constantly, several times a day, just so Harry could function.
screamed Thera. Winter understood her words and raced up the side of the creature, dodging its mouths. Its flesh was worse than the spongy ground of the bog: it sucked at Winter’s hooves with a frightening strength.
“So, what do you think?” Greg asked, wrapping his arms around her waist.
He couldn't stop thinking of it, and that was how he found himself inappropriately hard at his desk when his secretary, Bea, told him they were being called back out to the floor.
Ilana tilted her head again. “If your quest is a noble one, and if your heart is pure, they might. But they will not come out of hiding unless they’re called.”
He thought it was a pretty good list. Certainly he could find somebody who met all his criteria, especially at a gay club.  Pansy flooed over to Grimmauld Place at eight, and he showed her his list, and she laughed all over herself, so he snatched it back and shoved it in his pocket and called her a bint.
It was something they’d done as children, he remembered, but having people imprisoned down there during the war had effectively killed the allure of the cellar for him. “Upstairs. We can play with my new chess set.”
“Malfoy,” Potter groaned.
“Well, I’ll give you my number then. If you do end up getting one, shoot me a text.”
“What?” asked Harry, looking towards the kids, who were playing in the meadow. It was a Saturday in the middle of May, and Harry was at the Manor with Pansy. Besides the usual crew of Scorpius and Harry’s kids, Daphne’s twin girls were also there that weekend, since Daphne was out of town with a new boyfriend. The twins were Scorpius and Albus’s age, but were being very nice to Lily and trying to include her in everything. Lily seemed positively thrilled by their attention “Oh, that’s fine,” Harry said absently. “A toad won’t hurt him.”
In the end, it wasn’t even close: Draco and Harry had 71% of the vote, while Davies had only 23%.
Draco leaned over and kissed him, and it felt like everything was warm and slippery and perfect, Harry’s mouth and his cock, and his firm body beneath Draco’s, his legs spread open, his feet tucked back around Draco’s calves, helping him move. He removed his hand, letting their cocks slide between them, against each other, holding Harry closer.
“No, I mean it. You need someone who’s made of stronger stuff than I am. Someone as confident as you. Someone who can stand on his own two feet. Even if we made it through this year, eventually you’d have gotten tired of my shit. You realize that, don’t you? On some level?”
Astoria let out a snort. “Maybe I should have a potentially marriage-ending fight with Draco every few months.”
“No,” Potter said, honest as ever. His green eyes flicked up towards Draco’s. “I feel like shit.”
“At a
“It is,” she said emphatically, “you marvelous man, you.”
But Merlin, he was glad he’d seen. He wouldn’t trade that for anything in the world. It was worth the humiliation, the utter embarrassment of Malfoy knowing he was a peeping-Tom-pervert.
Harry, of course, took this as a challenge, and dug his fingers into Draco’s sides until he was howling with laughter, and kicking. “Careful!” Harry yelled. “If we’re going to do that again, I need all my bits intact.”
,” Harry protested. “You were the cocky one!”
He blinked his eyes open and Ernie was there, sitting on the bed beside him. “Hi,” Draco said, his voice froggy. He smiled up at Ernie, forgetting, for a moment, that they weren’t together anymore, that Ernie had broken up with him. Forgetting about The Plan and about Potter.
Under the stairs, simple enough
“I barely slept,” Harry admitted. He didn’t say where he’d been. “Tossed and turned.”
“I know. I mean, I knew that, somehow. Why do you think I snuck into your bed that first time?”
what to do, and that’s to stay away from Draco. He was a fucking mess last night, thanks to you. Not me,
Astoria flicked the wand at Draco’s restraints, and he rushed over and pulled at Harry. Harry struggled against him for a moment and then sagged and stumbled away, falling to the floor, breathing hard. Nott was bloodied and broken on the ground, lying perfectly still once more.
“Ugh…” Harry let out a low growl. “Fine. But I don’t like it. I don’t like that you have to do this.”
Draco closed the gap between them and felt Potter’s warm chest against his own. He saw Potter inhale rather shakily as his eyes moved over Draco’s mouth and then his collarbone. The shirt had been a good idea. Draco shifted so that his mouth was no more than an inch from Potter’s. “Unless you don’t want to,” he said, low and soft.
“I love a lot of your clothes now, I suppose. At least the ones I picked out. Oh, and I love the way you use your mouth on my cock. And I love that you planned this party and made all the decorations yourself. And I love that you don’t really care that our three closest friends just walked in on us fucking.” He let out a soft cry as Harry plunged into him fully. “I love that you stay over here almost every night,” he continued. “And I love that you cook breakfast for me. And I love the way you kiss me. And the way you do what you’re currently doing to me.” Harry was fucking him properly again, and everything was wet and good and perfect. “Mm, that feels so good, Harry.”
He laughed, a panicky sound. “Harry,” he said. “Fuck.”
Lia said something that sounded like ‘Big Ham’. “He’s a big ham?” Draco asked.
“Thank you,” he said quietly. “I don’t know that I deserve that from you, but thank you.”
“What?”
Draco nodded, tensing. His father was moving ahead with things, he just knew it.
“You were dreaming again, darling,” she whispered. “I didn’t want you to wake up any of our minders with your yelling.” As she spoke, her bottom lip cracked open, a thin line of blood showing starkly against the dry whiteness of the rest.
Draco wasn’t sure what to expect after he and Harry talked to Dumbledore. They left the Headmaster’s office and stood facing one another a bit awkwardly. “Thank you again,” said Harry. “Thank you for doing this.”
“Oh.”
“So, how’d you meet Astoria? That’s your fiancée, isn’t it?” Potter asked, abruptly changing the subject.
. Then, just as he was about to bring it down, Frankie rushed in front of him and stabbed the man through the throat.
“Or a relationship,” Draco said, his gray eyes on Harry’s.
Draco resisted rolling his eyes. “No. They work for certain types of magic, like, obviously, runic magic, and elemental magic, things like that. The sort of magic that was popular before wands came into vogue. It’s different, but it’s not dark or light, necessarily.”
Harry thought about that a lot that night.
“Are there more than one?”
Nott smiled tentatively. “I’ve already done so much for you already, you know. They’ve wanted to kill you for years. I wouldn’t let them. I said we owed it to your family, to the Malfoy name, to spare you.”
“Stop looking so pained, Draco, you bloody drama queen. At least you don’t have to share a room with
He’d been in such a fury all these months, so eager to get everything he could from Draco, to touch him, and now he could. He could, and it felt like the whole world was opening up in front of his eyes. Somehow, he found himself wanting to move slowly and carefully, savoring it. He’d learned how lovely kissing Draco could be, how it could mean as much as sex, sometimes, if you let it, and so for a while, they did just that, kissing slow and soft, reveling in one another’s eyes and mouths and throats and hands.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Blaise looked at him, jaw clenched, for a moment, before whirling around and standing stock still, his arms crossed, his long body rigid, shoulders heaving.
It made him want to rip his hair out to think he’d jeopardized their relationship.
she never married? He supposed if he’d guessed at it when they were younger, he’d have thought she would marry some insanely wealthy pureblood and raise an heir or two and host a lot of luncheons. “I dunno. Why?”
Draco took out a bottle of firewhiskey that he’d nicked from the kitchen and took a few swigs. He was going to need a little liquid courage to make it through the night.
And then in an instant, it was all rushing back over him, all the want and heat and frantic desire, everything he’d kept (often unsuccessfully) at bay for all those months. Soon, Harry was spinning and breathless.
Harry banished their clothes.
“Schedule another. And I’m supposed to go boating with my banker at one. And then I’m supposed to have dinner with some friends, and then go out tonight. You could schedule a Portkey for the morning. I can help get you one.” Just because he had jack-all to do with the Chicago wizarding community didn’t mean he didn’t know the Magical Mayor of Chicago well enough to call in a favor.
“Blaise is good. We’re going to Milan tomorrow to see his mum.”
Harry could only laugh and shake his head and kiss him back.
Thankfully, mid-summer, some nutter up in the Highlands managed to disappear all the water from Loch Ness, and the papers, ever fickle, began covering
He sighed. “Fine. Okay. I know you’re just trying to be nice. It’s…it’s fine. What’s his name?”
“Oh, no, not just Ginny!” Harry said. “No, she’s beautiful, obviously. More like…women. In general.”
. Draco was just another potentially fun sexual encounter to him. Thinking otherwise was idiotic.
Harry barked out a laugh. “No, you git. I don’t. And so I don’t want to mess around with you.”
“Hello, darling,” said a voice behind him.
“Define swear,” Pansy said, arching a neatly-shaped eyebrow. “Are we talking unbreakable vows here?”
They had a wonderful day, flying around on the Malfoys’ brooms – even Pansy – and taking a tour of the stables. There were horses and also a cockatrice, a half dozen fire-breathing chickens, and two winged horses, an Abraxan and an Aethonan. There was also a crup named Mitzy who trotted along happily behind them as they wandered the grounds. In the afternoon they went fishing in the pond, throwing back all their catches. Pansy was squeamish about the whole thing, shrieking anytime anyone pulled something up. It was rather cute, to see no-nonsense, hard-eyed Parkinson freaking out over carp.
“She’s alright,” Harry said, smiling at Sarah.
Draco grinned. “We’re full of surprises, the two of us.”
Draco was shaking his head. “One, if we win, you’ll deserve to be in that position. And two, I want to do this with
“I wanted to see if you’d done any research, I guess,” Harry said, shrugging. Honestly, he’d just wanted to come. He’d just wanted to talk to someone, to the only person he could really talk to about this.
He tracked down his professor in his study. He hadn’t talked openly with Snape about his defection, though he was certain that Snape knew, either from the Dark Lord’s side or from Dumbledore. “I want to know where Harry is,” he said.
“You fucked me over, Draco! How am I to be your friend
“I’m on Pansy’s team!” Draco cried. Pansy kicked everyone’s arse at darts.
Draco’s fingers clutched at the blankets. “You – you want to try.”
“But the criminals in this instance have people in the Ministry.”
, but…” he took a big swig of his drink. “If Harry fucked him, it’d probably be over in a blink. But since he’s
“You…no. But. You don’t kiss me. You kiss Katie now.”
Draco climbed onto the stool, reeling. He’d missed Potter, somehow. Probably he’d come too late. And the now he wouldn’t see him until the train, and by then, he’d already be with Weasley and Hermione, and everything would be the same disaster it had been the first time around. Draco’s throat felt tight and almost painful as the witch pulled a robe over him and began to pin the hem. It was hard to breathe, and hot, and he wanted to run out onto the street and look for Potter, find him
A little smile. “Thanks.”
“We do not,” said Harry.
Harry was reeling in light and sound and laughter, drunker than he’d been since the first night of mojitos. A group of American witches had pulled Harry and Ron and Theo and some of the other boys out onto the dance floor, which was so packed that Harry didn’t really have to worry about looking like an idiot because he could hardly move. And besides, one very pretty witch with spiraled brown hair, wearing a magenta tube top, was grinding her arse against Harry’s crotch, a development that he couldn’t entirely hate.
“But we
Frankie glared at her. “But it’s
She shook her head. “No. A bunch of them have Neville’s stag tomorrow night, so Ron wanted to stay home and rest up.”
The door clicked behind him, and he and Potter both lost it, holding onto each other and laughing until their sides hurt.
Blaise never did, but this time, he swallowed, and then he was back on Draco, kissing his mouth, and it was dirty, and heated, and all of it felt far more intimate than usual. After they’d kissed until their mouths were red and swollen, Blaise summoned lube, and Draco knew he was going to try to fuck him. And he also knew he wasn’t sure if he wanted that. And besides, “I have a meeting. With the SASS group. I’m going to be late.”
“I will,” said Draco, running a hand over the nape of his neck. “Tell him…when he comes back, tell him to come to my chambers, won’t you?”
did –”
Blaise came over and asked Draco if he could have a word, and Harry tried not to mind. Draco came back ten minutes or so later, looking contemplative. “What?” Harry asked, trying to not be a big, jealous baby. But he was. He was the biggest, most jealous baby of all, and he desperately, desperately wanted Draco to tell him he had nothing to worry about.
Harry snorted a laugh and considered this. “Alright, deal. But you’re coming to the Gryffindor tower. There’s no way I’m setting foot in the dungeon.”
Draco put his hand onto the silver handprint.
“Because I’m usually a prat about these things and you expected I’d do everything in my power to get Hagrid in trouble.”
“I dare you to flash your tits,” said Padma, grinning.
“Oh Merlin, yes. He’s totally adorable. Don’t tell me you don’t find him attractive.”
He leaned closer, wanting, wanting,
Harry kissed him. “It was mad. It was wonderful. I loved it. I want to do it again.”
“Are you asking me to come with you to London?” Harry asked.
A shrug. “They have an alliance. William keeps their lands safe from the False Queen and leaves them alone, and they allowed him to claim Rodderem as his own. It was originally an Etherean city, the first city they built. By the time William’s father fled to it, though, it was mostly Marchmen living there. The Ethereans could make a claim to it, but they’ve agreed to cede it to William. They seem to retreat further into the mountains with every generation anyway, so I don’t think they care very much.”
. Stop making this weirder than it has to be. We both enjoyed our little hate-fuck last night. There’s no reason to pick it apart.”
after all.”
He took a deep breath and pretended he was wearing a red and gold tie, that he had iron in his veins.
“No shit,” Harry said. “That’s why I didn’t want this to happen.”
But Harry held him still. “We don’t need to stop because of Seamus,” he said, loudly. “He’s just jealous.” He laughed, and then continued, in a mock whisper, “I dunno if you know this, but our dear Seamus is
William nodded. “The loser is always on the wrong side. Because the winner is the one who tells the tale.”
? “Maybe he can come back another time, okay? But he can’t be here when nobody knows where he is.”
“Try again,” Harry said.
He tried Seamus’s, but the only thing he accomplished there was seeing Dean and Seamus back in love and being positively sickening about it. He tried the Ministry, because there was some tiny chance that Ron had come in to catch up on paperwork.
You want to take him by his stupid silver shirt and shake him until his eyeballs pop out. Or, alternatively, shove him up against a wall and devour his face. “Well,” you say, and even as you're saying it, a voice in the back of your head is shrieking that it's time to shut it down -- ABORT, ABORT!! it screams. But you ignore the voice, because you recognize it as the voice of common sense, and you always ignore that one. “Maybe there
Malfoy nodded tersely.
“It’s
The food came and they both sort of just stared at it. “So, can we try being friends again? Or, maybe not
“Here I am,” said Harry, suddenly appearing behind Draco. He was in swishy pants of his own, and one of those hooded sweatshirts muggles favored, with the pocket on the front. Considering what he was wearing, Draco was certain Harry wasn’t supposed to look nearly as good as he did. And yet he did.
“He wanted to,” Daphne said miserably. “Especially when we found out I was pregnant.”
“You wish,” Draco said, and then Charlie left his side, wandering into the crowd.
They’d probably shagged, though. Malfoy seemed to imply that in the Slytherin dungeons, everybody shagged everybody. Harry suddenly had a ghostly vision of Pansy’s pale breasts against Malfoy’s pale chest and nearly had a stroke over it. “It’s hot in here, ‘Moine. Merlin. Open a window, why don’t you,” said Harry.
“Ungh,” Harry said eloquently against Euri’s mouth. “Um. Shit. I really have to go.”
The flirting between Charlie and Draco got worse after that (or better, depending on how you looked at it). Draco still flirted with Harry, obviously, and still took advantage of their nights together, and still looked at him in a way that made Harry melt a little, but now he looked at Charlie a bit like that, too. And Charlie was the same with Harry. He still loved Harry and acted like it every day, but now he was doing some of those little considerate things for Draco, too: fixing him tea in the morning, rubbing his shoulders at night if Draco complained of a backache, and buying his favorite biscuits from the shop. Draco and Charlie were closer, and spent time together, on walks or lounging in the living room watching movies, or sometimes running into the village together for groceries.
“Only Ethereans are welcome there,” William said. “And even then, they don’t let everyone enter. People like Laurel and Lia, who’ve committed themselves to this war, are prohibited from entering.”
ran into Malfoy, towel wrapped around his waist and nothing else, pale skin still glistening from the steam, hair still wet. He smelled really good, Harry couldn't help but notice. He didn't want to notice, but it was positively wafting off of Malfoy's body, this good, clean smell. It was almost minty-ish. “Morning, Potter,” Malfoy said, nodding. “How’d you sleep?”
“Hey,” said Harry, some of the anger he’d felt last week dissipating. Ron was avoiding his gaze. “Mate…” Harry began.
“I definitely am. Don’t worry, I’ll just fantasize about the Harry part. Not about you.”
He was tired, too, from the long morning. Perhaps she ought to take him home. He didn’t always take an afternoon nap anymore, but occasionally, it was necessary.
Harry found himself wondering, for the hundredth time, whether Draco had confronted her. Whether Draco was angry with her or whether they’d made up. He wondered whether they still slept together, and (much too often) wondered whether they still fucked.
“Yes,” he said. “That was the goal, anyway.”
And now I'm just a-rollin' home
Draco felt along his coat, his fingers sliding over the outline of the black comb that would bring him back when he was done. “Yes, indeed. I’m glad someone’s keeping track.” He looked at Hermione, at her small, serious face, her riot of curls. “I wish you’d just run alongside me instead. We’d be a sure thing.”
“Well, yeah, that sounds brill,” he said, nodding.
It was fascinating, actually, how terrible Harry’s hair could get. It was always a mess, but in the mornings, it achieved seemingly impossible feats, sticking straight up in places – literally straight up in the air -- and snarling in great messy knots in others.
He found himself clutching at Charlie, pulling at him, trying to get him deeper and closer and harder. Charlie wasn’t being quiet, either. He kept saying lovely things, calling Harry sweet names. Harry felt bizarrely, wonderfully adored.
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around, and say
“Good,” he said.
, and then Draco’s hot wet mouth was engulfing him, and Charlie was pounding into Draco’s arse, and all of it was so good and Harry knew he was going to last about five seconds, but he really didn’t care, because he wanted to do it all again and again and again.
“And Pansy?”
“And Astoria, have you known about Draco’s sexual orientation for a long time? Or did you just find out recently?”
Potter stiffened; Draco could see the line of him go taut. “I suppose that’s unacceptable in your little pureblooded brain.”
"The trees themselves seemed tense, waiting."
Then, finally, mercifully, Harry began to tug at Draco’s pants, pulling them off agonizingly slowly, his eyes fixed on each inch of skin that was revealed as he tugged. When Draco’s cock sprang free, pink and aching and leaking, Harry licked his lips. “Beautiful,” he murmured. “Of course it’s bloody gorgeous, just like the rest of you.” Then he bent down and licked a hot stripe along Draco’s shaft, and Draco cried out in surprise, and felt his hips buck up towards Harry’s tongue.
Draco clutched his wand and they peered out. The fire was between them and the outside, and it was good, because animals were afraid of it, and bad, because it made it harder to see.
Harry was a terrible friend.
He apparated into Diagon Alley and made the short walk to Pansy’s. The day was bright and hot already, summer in full swing. James was coming home this week, and he’d be at Harry’s this weekend. Harry couldn’t wait to see him; Christmas seemed like a very long time ago. He wondered, not for the first time, whether it was entirely healthy for a child to be at boarding school at such a young age, away from their parents for so much of the year.
“What!” exclaimed Ginny. “Sweet Merlin, Harry!”
But Potter was hope, too, all those nights Draco’d thought the world would end, that Voldemort would kill all of them, just for sport. Draco’d always known Potter was the last line of defense, their only chance of making it out the other side. And he hadn’t disappointed, had he?
“I think that can be arranged,” Harry said, suddenly sounding breathless.
happy. He would have to tell Lysandra, to make sure she knew she wasn’t the
“No, I’m not okay, if that’s what you were going to ask. Everything sucks and most of it is my own damn fault, but it still sucks.”
“Look into it,” Harry said. “Just look.”
“Can I kiss
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Don’t feel that way anymore, honestly. I feel like she doesn’t love anything but her job.”
If you get in with me
He yanked a picture of himself and Minister Shacklebolt in a glass frame off the shelf and threw it at the door, feeling a sick thrill of satisfaction when it cracked along the corners and then broke into smaller pieces as it hit the floor. He flicked his wand at it, then flicked his wand at a stack of papers on his desk and yelled
“That you told him to ask you out to make me jealous. So that I would agree to your…terms. For getting back together.”
“What? Queer? It’s kinda weird that you wanted to live on the North Side, but not
There was nothing on the other side.
“I’m not asking Draco out. We’re
“I think you know why I want to know,” Draco said. “I came across an old treatise by Cedrella Talpin that discusses it. It wasn’t always a purely muggle concept, apparently.”
He thought, then, as Draco held him close, his breath tickling his hair, that if Draco would let him, he would love him forever.  Maybe even if Draco
I know I need to feel released
Draco couldn’t help but smile back, even as he rolled his eyes. He kissed Potter again, pulling him wonderfully close. “It won’t be boring, that’s for certain.”
“Yes, I’m yours,” Draco said, pulling Harry’s mouth back to his. Harry pulled back a little, gazing into his eyes. “I’m all yours. As long as you want me.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“I like what I like,” Harry said stubbornly.  “I’m not a fickle bastard like you, growing up with tea and then abandoning it for the first fancy caffeinated beverage that came along. I’m
Finally, Draco was done with the sabre and pulled an attractive young guy onto the stage. The man was obviously besotted, touching Draco at every possible opportunity, his gaze hot on him otherwise, except for when Draco made him laugh. Draco was good at that, too, at building little bits of comedy into his routine to lighten the mood, like with the bathtub last time. Harry tried not to feel jealous or too turned on by what was happening, by the way Draco straddled the man and rolled his hips, or tilted backwards and pulled the man’s head down to his bare chest. But despite his best efforts, Harry felt both of those things, in spades. He wanted to punch the poor dark-haired bloke in the face and also wanted them both to yank off their clothes and fuck so Harry could watch.
He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and willed his fingers to stop shaking as he felt the leather leave his hand.
“I—I was going to visit Harry in the Hospital—“
Professor Flickwick fainted, Professor Sprout hurriedly went down to his side. Snape seemed to stagger, gripping on the back of a chair so tight that his knuckles went white, his face carefully blank. Madam Hooch grabbed him to steady his sense of gravity.
No sooner did Draco try to stomach down a few bites of food that the daily flurry of owls swooped in with an unusual amount of
“How I know doesn’t matter, what matters is that he
"Wait, what's that?" Past Harry, Draco saw a clearing and the moonlight was making something seem to glow on the ground. "I think it's the unicorn!" Rushing past Harry (hearing a sad sigh behind), he went to look at the unicorn. It was beautifully sad.
Draco scoffed and shook his head. “Michael, sometimes I wonder what goes—“ He faltered when he noticed no one was walking beside him anymore. “Michael?” He turned around to see the boy passed out on the floor. “
"Yes, it's been a tiring year don't you think?" Draco tried for a joke, turning towards his godfather with a trying grin but was wiped away with an unimpressed stare. "Sorry."
Draco looked away, thinking of where to start. “I wasn’t lying. It sort of is. A pure bloodline that can be traced down for generations. My father has a powerful influence in the Ministry and bends the law for his benefit. Getting away with basically anything with enough money. Everything waits on you hand to foot. How do you not grow up thinking that the world answers to you? That you were better than everyone else, even when you are not.”
He sifted through each envelope: Terry bored out of his mind at home, Anthony asking Draco’s opinion on prefects, and--from what Draco could make out from all the hasty scribbles--Michael screaming about how he got tickets to the Quidditch World Cup. The letters shifted to more recently after finding out that Harry, Ron, and Hermione also managed to get tickets to the Cup. There was a letter from an embarrassed Hermione asking what
"What?”
Buckbeak relented and started to bow in return, but stopped to hesitate, taking in Draco almost unnoticeable fidget.
. He couldn’t imagine doing that. There was no way he could go back to not being by Harry's side.
“Don’t do that, you’ll ruin the new paint job.” Draco bent down to drag the cat away. “Gryffindors aren’t allowed in our common room, you know?” Crookshanks walked up to the door all the same. "Blasted cat," Draco muttered under his breath.
“Yes.”
“Oh, what’s it like?” Ron grew excited. “Have you seen those tellies Dad’s always on about?”
Tonks noticed the workbook on the table and laughed. She picked up the dormant songbird. “Couldn’t speak French? Yeah,” She placed the bird down. “Mum had to stick me to the chair for my lessons when I was a kid. Literally, I wouldn’t be able to move for hours.” She sighed, scratching the back of her head. “But...
"Of course not, yes. That's obvious. Um, where's a quill and ink?" A
"Did you need to talk to Harry about something?"
Draco walked back to his dormitory and found Michael and Terry playing Wizard Chess on Michael’s bed and Anthony laying down on his own bed, reading a book.
“Harry!” Hermione suddenly shouted and went down to the floor, inspecting an unconscious Harry but Draco was still trying to collect himself. His chest was minutely coming loose, waves of chills still shuddering through his body.
"Dinner!" Mrs Weasley called out. "Hurry up now!"
Mounting brooms, they all flew up into the sky. Madam Hooch’s whistle shrilled and they sped off to their positions.
“It’s not cheating! We’re using our heads,” Ron said.
“Seriously, it’s fine,” Harry insisted as he sat beside Draco. “I’m not going to let something like this get in the way of my friendship with Draco. He means more to me than that.”
of December and a
!” Ron misjudged Draco’s weight during the swing and he dropped the blond onto the floor.
Lucius walked away, not bothering to see if his son was following him.
“Hey." Harry cleared his throat. "So, I, er, I saw one of the Beuxbatons students talking to you during the feast.”
“This is important! Moody—“
"Anyhow, those reports are the most boring. ‘
“They do? How?” Draco asked.
“Lady Narcissa told Dobby to come up.”
to Professor Lupin that he’s letting us know?”
Draco felt his heart flutter. He gave one last kiss (and another, and one more because he couldn’t help it) before stepping out of Harry’s arms. “I should get going. It’s late.”
This couldn’t be happening.
He isn’t going to be doing it again.
Hermione nodded. “Good. That's good. That is good, right?”
"Brilliant! We’ll have this potion ready by next week!” Weasley exclaimed.
of all people.) It was an enlightening experience. When the two made eye contact once more, they shared a laugh.
"Jus' go ter lunch," Hagrid said. "This'll all be forgotten soon. 'm sure of it."
“Do you accept?” Dumbledore asked Mrs. Krum who accepted readily.
Draco continued his rampage, not answering his friends' calls.
“He had business to attend to," Narcissa said too curtly.
Draco hefted his school trunk down the stairs towards a frantic Narcissa pulling on dragonhide travel gloves.
Moody slipped his wand into his hand and pointed it at Draco. "
There was a muted, unified sound of heads turning to him.
Draco rubbed his eye with the heel of his hand. "No, no, I'm fine now. What was it?"
“What a gentleman,” Terry said.
"Did we get everything?" Harry lifted the books in question.
Edward eyed her briefly, cast a glance at Draco, before heaving a breath. “Alright, alright. Guess you should probably come in then.” He opened the door further.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “I am all those things…”
Terry forced a cough. “So… So Anthony! Your family--Some of your family from America are coming over?” He asked Anthony.
Draco tilted his head. “Are you Dora?” He ventured.
"It seems, the last two students have arrived. They missed the train and had to go another way. Please excuse the disturbance.“ Dumbledore turned to the professors shifting in their seats. "Well, we'll just wait for Severus to get back. In the meantime, dig in!" Food materialised in front of them.
"How are you feeling?" Terry asked softly.
Eager to leave the stifling atmosphere of the table, Draco stood.
“Oh.” Harry echoed. “Right. With the Dementors. That’s what you’re talking about.” He shook his head. “Uh, yeah, it was so strange. There were Dementors swarming me and Sirius. Hermione didn’t know how to help, then Snape just...  appeared. I thought the last thing I’ll see was Snape trying to save my life. Which is weird. He managed to cast a large Patronus that repelled them all away. Did you know his Patronus is a doe?”
Lucius blew out a long breath, then sat on edge of Draco's bed. "I am what others do not expect in a father, Draco. I think you've come to realise this. But, this year, I've come to some terms with myself. I've had a sort of revelation. I'll try to be better." Lucius shook his head. "I'm not saying that I'll be a completely different man. It's not that easy, but, Draco, son," he placed his hands on either side of Draco's shoulders. "I'll try to do everything in my power to never have that happen to you again."
“No, this is fine.” If Draco attempted to move he might leave his resolve in the room.
“To once again swear allegiance… To that...
He definitely remembered her. Wearing all of those bizarre clothes and never seemed to get in trouble for it. Seeing her wander around the castle humming to herself or her nose up in that bogus magazine her father worked for. He was amazed when he figured out that she was a Ravenclaw.
“Oh, get your heads out of dragon dung, will you!" Vector snapped. "Love has implications outside of romance, you know.” She cleared her throat. “Now, I want you to write your name you’re thinking about and either put ‘hates’ or ‘loves.’ Then, write your name.”
“Now, when you awaken, you’ll be in the water, so make sure you keep your head up as you reach the shore.” Dumbledore stood and walked over to Gabrielle's side. He pulled out his wand. “Do you accept, Miss Delacour?”
“Oh, not much. Scorpius came over last Tuesday for a playdate.”
“Draco hardly needs the extra money,” said Dominic, scowling at Harry. “He’s not wanting for anything.”
“Did you offer it to him?” asked Draco.
Instead, he left his eye peeking open, and listened to the lovely sounds Malfoy was making, the soft, urgent intakes of breath, the little moans, the sighs.
“I’m not from the mountains. I’m – we are – from somewhere else,” he said. He took a bite of the bread. It was delicious, and tasted a little like honey. Potter took a bite as well, looking unsettled.
Maybe he wouldn’t tell her.
“You’re my favorite, too, Pans,” he said, meaning it with his whole heart.
just because you think that’s what counts as fun!”
William nodded. “I’d love to have you and Kerrick put the fear of the gods in him. But if you cannot stay that long, I’m sure Kerrick will manage.”
Fresh out of ideas, Harry took out his phone to call Draco, and saw that he’d missed a dozen texts from the night before. He hadn’t even thought to check that morning.
Ari mixed up drinks for everyone. He was looking especially cute tonight, in a dusty, pale pink suit over a blue shirt. Harry was in a blue suit, and it was almost like they’d coordinated on purpose. But she highly doubted Harry would’ve gone for that, so it was probably coincidental. Pansy found herself feeling one of those urge-to-punch-Harry moments coming on.
they both think I’m conspiring against Fudge. Which is--is
Ron yelped with Black stepped away from the corner.
"What?" Michael asked.
Leaning back in his seat, the blond glanced at the ceiling. What was he supposed to do this year? He knows so much. Too much. What should he do? Tell someone? No. Not yet. He had to get closer to Potter first, even if that meant befriending Granger and Weasley.
During this time, Anthony only sighed at the Christmas garnish and, dutifully, lit a candle each night on his small menorah that was on his bedside table when Hanukkah started early in December. When Draco got ready to sleep he could hear Anthony’s low voice in the dormitory as he mumbled prayers in Hebrew.
“Aye, and yer a good kid fer doin’ so.” Hagrid sniffed.
The blond almost choked. “Where did
"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid said as Draco easily slipped into a boat, closely followed by Weasley, Potter, and Longbottom.
Maybe he didn’t need to be friends with Potter, maybe he didn’t need to help Potter, maybe he didn’t need to be here at all.
“D-Don’t you want to sit here to relax?” Harry called after him. “Just for a moment?”
“Okay!” Creevey only grinned again, unknowing of the current rift between Harry and Draco. The Fat Lady’s portrait closed.
“Sorry, sorry.” she sniffed, rubbing her sleeve against her eyes. “I didn’t mean to blow up like that. Just… I’ve been going through a lot lately.”
Draco gasped as his head broke the Black Lake's surface. He rapidly blinked water out of his eyes as he coughed, his robes weighing him down along with Gabrielle’s strong grip to keep herself afloat.
"What are you doing out of bed?"
“You’re at my house,” Ron answered.
“Yes, sir.” Draco kept his eyes downcast as if to not aggravate the lifeless glass eye.
"They must be terrible people." Draco suddenly thought that he didn't know much about Harry's life outside of Hogwarts.
“Harry, wait!” Anthony called out.
"Something the matter?" Ron asked.
“Right… Corner, wasn’t it? One of your Ravenclaw… friends.”
Fragile steam rose from two teacups. Professor Lupin pushed one saucer towards the blond uncomfortably sitting in one of Lupin’s chairs.
“Nothing. He asked if I was alright.”
Draco noise of alarm was too late their heads as Lupin groaned, grabbing at his stomach.
Draco heaved a sigh and massaged his temple. “When’s your detention?”
But Draco’s mouth didn’t seem to work properly with his brain.
“I’m doing this because I care, Draco.”
“Michael! Where have you been? We missed you at breakfast. And lunch.”
While trekking back upstairs, Draco paused. “Anthony,” he said.
When Dumbledore rose to give the Welcoming speech, his eyes drifted to Snape, who was staring at him intently. Draco's eyes didn't linger there long and they soon landed on Professor Quirrell. Draco winced painfully.
“Yes, I know he’s a werewolf.”
"Can I see?" Draco stared at the thin face, the messy, black hair, and the broken, round glasses being held together by what looked like Spello-tape.
“What’s going to happen to me?”
“Madam Pomfrey! Madam Pomfrey!” Ron called out, dragging Draco in haste. “We need your help!”
"Er," Potter began nervously, but Draco cut him short.
He was laying in his bed, staring at a piece of parchment that was scribbled with ideas and possibilities he made while in the library.
“How did you know then?”
“I can’t go home. I
"Uhm, yes, thank you, Luna." Draco tried to stop shaking as he took the diary out of her hands. “I've... been looking all over for it." He wanted to shove the diary back at her and run in the other direction as fast he could.
. Draco ran a hand through bright blonde hair, not stopping it as it swooped back in its place, his gray eyes still looked too old for himself. Just when he stopped looking at the prospect of friends without disinterest, the sudden thought of how he still fit in his school robes when he felt like he was supposed to have grown. His voice was going to break one of these days.
“Well, who else in Ravenclaw would have a connection to Sirius Black?” Hermione asked.
Anthony grinned and climbed to sit opposite of Draco.
“It’s fine, really,” Harry cleared his throat. “But I really do need to tell you something.”
He wanted to ask her if she knew how he managed to get into the forest when the last thing he remembered was a Death Eater staring down at him with a backdrop of flames, but it was unlikely she knew.
Draco rolled his eyes, waving an unbothered hand. “Don’t put him on a pedestal. Always bothers me when people do that.” Draco glanced out the window to see the train finally picked up its travelling speed. “I’m actually pretty good at Quidditch.” A brief silence pulled Draco away from the window to see the dubious looks from the other boys. “What? I am!”
“But there has to be a reason!” Hermione insisted. “Black must know that Harry’s in Gryffindor and if he’s after him…” She shook her head. “Maybe there’s something that’s only in the Ravenclaw Tower. An object that Black could’ve hidden back in his days at Hogwarts or an heirloom of some kind.”
“Who knows,” Harry said.
"About what?"
"Mrs Weasley was very much against us sitting in on meetings, especially Harry. She thinks we're too young. Sirius thinks that Harry should be part of it since it's about... You-Know-Who."
not awake at the moment. Do you want to see him?"
Draco smiled and deeply nodded. “I’m honoured. Thank you for letting me practice my French with you. My aunt would’ve been livid if I forgot everything.”
"Something's amidst here at Hogwarts. Dumbledore sent for me to make sure you all are prepared. This Triwizard Tournament can be dangerous and not just for the champions. So. Keep Potter safe, Mister Malfoy."
Fletcher noticed a particular blond approaching and his mouth curled into a smirk. “
“I swear, I’m fine.” Draco felt like he was repeating himself. He sighed. “I’m not going to be long. I'll see you soon.” He didn’t wait for a response and left.
"Horrible—well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. I wish I had wizard brothers."
Draco almost blanched at the bold lie Harry was telling Terry.
“He is? Why?”
"Harry, keep your voice down!" Hermione whispered and pointed to Fleur walking out of the library with books held close to her chest. "Champions aren't supposed to know about the First Task."
them was a misunderstanding?!” Harry shouted, his sadness gone and replaced with sudden anger.
"What was that?" Michael whispered near his ear, not wanting to sound loud to the hushed tones in the Hall. He didn't answer as Dumbledore raised his hands and everyone fell silent.
wouldn’t know what to do with himself if magic was taken away from him.
Harry shrugged a stiff shoulder. “Just happened to see it that's all. Who's she?”
“Oh, it’s nothing important. I was wondering if I can talk to you."
"Draco!" someone hissed in front of him and he jumped.
“Draco?” Harry recoiled at the sight of the blond’s frazzled state.
"Er, yeah." Draco turned to face the window as the door squeaked shut and Lovegood bounced on the seat across from him.
Draco snapped to himself.
“Fred and George. They gave it to me last year.”
Hermione straightened. “I… I accept, then.” She blushed and coughed ducking her gaze down to her school bag. “I-I think I hear Crookshanks.” She got up and rushed up to the girls’ dormitory (but not before Draco saw a shadow of a smile on her face).
The next day, Draco was frowning at a letter from Tonks as Terry and Anthony were filling up on lunch. He asked her about her thoughts on Moody and him teaching at Hogwarts and he didn’t like the response.
Lockhart's bottom lip trembled as he was turned out of the room, muttering incoherently as McGonagall shoved him out and closed the door.
A manic man shoved between them and Draco was sent to the ground.
After their dance, Patil seemed annoyed with Harry’s clear disinterest and bad dancing that she walked away. Harry didn’t seem bothered and sat down by himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why not? I’m the one who’s seen it! He can’t say those things to me. It’s not right."
Dumbledore waved his wand near Draco’s head. An overwhelming sense of weight made Draco's limbs sluggish and his eyes drooped as everything went black.
“Anthony’s right,” Hermione nodded. “It’s not a party trick. And it’s Draco’s decision to tell us anything. The future is something very fragile.”
Narcissa." the man mumbled and his wife placed a comforting hand on his leg.
shocked and--and worried we were?" Micheal had a deranged facial expression of someone rudely disturbed from sleep. Terry was still trying to blink the sleep away from his eyes as he slumped on the bed across from Harry and Draco.
Andromeda, who was at the table and reading the newspaper, clicked her tongue. “She’s probably running around with those chaotic Aurors now. She’s probably getting into all sorts of trouble.”
"Oh, him, I mean yes, that's me." The Weasleys gawked at Potter, causing the boy to turn red. Draco bit back a smile. He was 'nice' now, but that didn't mean that he couldn't enjoy seeing his supposed-to-be-arch-nemesis suffer.
was of receiving turnabout treatment of the cold shoulder.
“I thought there was no one left in the world who hasn’t read my book! Every day is something new! Worry no more, I’ll sign one and send it over right away. Good-bye!” Draco’s ears picked up on Lockhart’s voice, but that didn’t shake the image of
"'Course I made it!" Tonks said and wrapped an arm around Draco. "Brought someone with me! Hope you don't mind that I brought him along."
“The one where they discontinued it because it was
"Maybe in passing--" Lockhart fumbled.
"It's a little bad," Terry noted, cramped in the corner, his eyes closed as if to catch more sleep.
Draco blew out a long breath to gather self-control. “Well… She likes to study…”
” She hissed at him before turning back to Harry and Ron. “It’s why he always knew everything. Because he already saw it. He was
“Mate, you suck at this.” Terry only said, tucking away the unmoving Snitch into his pocket.
There was a bang, then a giggly voice.
”I need to lay down. Goodnight,” Draco snapped and climbed back into his bed, yanking his canopy drapes closed.
“Yeah, anything exciting happening?” Ron asked. “Tell us a prophecy you have or whatever you call it!”
Michael flashed Draco a fleeting smile before dashing out after them.
Draco sat up in a flourish, finally processing the lowness of the sun. Did he just sleep the day away?
“No, I want to know--”
“Thank you.” Draco looked up to at all three of them. “And thank you for the gifts. I didn’t think you would after how I acted… I’m sorry. I said that I wanted to be a good friend, but I’m… not.” He really wasn’t. How was it so bad at it? How was is it so
"She does?!" Hermione shouted, turning pink when a pair of two years passing by her were startled. "How do you know?"
Draco was left alone in the dorm room. He smoothed back his hair behind his ear and let out a long breath. He thought of where Harry could be at that moment before leaving the dormitory as well.
"How about we talk about how am I supposed to go against a
It was the fastest. Though, he didn't really pay attention the first time. He was busy getting attacked by Weasley.
"Trust me, by tomorrow everything will be back to normal. That seem fine?”
“Yeah.”
"Carry this? I need to look for the rest of my spellbooks." The blonde passed the books towards the boy.
“Uh, sure?”
"Okay." Like the good, empty-headed goons Draco remembered, they didn't question him. "We'll be in another compartment. If you need us, just come and get us.”
. Still, he went along and decided to show them a simple spell. "
himself being too dramatic.
Edward turned directly towards Draco. Before he could react to being caught, Edward gestured his head back to the living room. Draco understood and returned back onto the couch.
"Good boy." Lucius patted his shoulder and walked off the other direction. He huffed and look at the object in his hands.
"Nothing, nothing."
“It’s not a problem, Narcissa. Draco’s always welcomed here. He can even stay here tonight.”
"Harry... you idiot!" Draco punched him roughly in the arm.
“No, no, it’s quite alright,” She gave Mrs. Weasley's hands a definitive squeeze. “Thank you for everything. You’re a good friend. Let’s go home, Draco." She helped him to stand. "Put your arm through mine. We’ll Apparate.”
Harry's grin faded. He wetted his lip as he checked to see if Terry was still asleep.
“I’m okay, Mrs. Weasley.”
It went on for a little while, Harry
“Very good, Miss Granger." Professor Vector praised Hermione's answer that Draco didn't catch. "Now I want you to look at the chart on page 86. You’ll take your name and correlate each letter with the numerical value it was placed… Hurry along Mister Murphy.” She added, looking at the Hufflepuff boy. "Then, you'll want to..."
“What do I think of him?”
Ron held out his arms to create a barrier between Draco and Harry. Draco tried to reach over Ron’s arm. “
“Malfoy!” Terry slapped his shoulder.
a name there; T. M. Riddle.
What was Harry talking about? He liked him? How was that possible? That’s not how things were supposed to go. It was all wrong. Harry’s supposed to have feelings for someone else. What did Draco do? What did he say? He searched his memories to find a cause.
Merlin, Draco's heart was about to explode. He took a huge gulp of air. “I… I think… I think I might—I mean, I don’t think you’d—I want to… I like—“ Draco wanted to sink into the ground. He was
“Are you sure this is only about Potter?” Anthony suggested.
He wasn’t focused on her but rather Moody. Mad-Eye Moody? As in,
“I want us… I want us to be more than friends,” He rushed out before turning back imploringly, lightly grasping at Harry’s shirt. “Oh, Harry, can we be more than friends?”
“What do you feel about escalators then?”
When the bowls reached the bottom and the dishes cleared, the Order started preparing for a meeting.
have the time of your life,” Harry said disappointedly. “I’m not going. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission form.”
Narcissa stopped in front of one of the unassuming houses. Her eyes flickered over the face of the home. The mailbox said it belonged to a family called the 'TONKS.'
“No. No, I rather punch you and see what happens.” Fletcher raised a fist above his head before being yanked back abruptly, leaving Draco to collapse to the wet ground. “What the--“ Fletcher's hat pulled over his face. “Hey!“ he fell forward. Snow kicked itself an over Fletcher's scrambling body.
“The Weird Sisters are the exception.”
He turned and saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione running towards him. “What are you doing out here?” Why did he feel like he should know the answer already?
“Come on!” Harry cried out, yanking them into the chaos.
"Now what do you mean not the real you?”
Ted turned towards him, giving him a long look before turning back to the road. “Well, alright…”
Despite the intention of leaving his thoughts home, the movement and silence of the car made Draco drift back to questioning.
“You can’t think that I’m good enough for—“
“Let me, my dear child. Your Inner Eye is suddenly cloudy.” Trelawney spoke quietly, appearing out of nowhere. She gently eased Harry’s cup out of Draco’s hand as he tried to picture anyone that he would have caught their interest.
"No?"
Draco thought from his place on the ground. “What I hate more than anything is the sight of blood,” he explained, backing off to have an annoyed Anthony hoist him up.
"When you said to have a chocolate frog last night, it reminded me of Dumbledore's card I have. Turns out, Flamel has a Sorcerer's Stone!" Harry whispered so no one walking by could hear.
“I’m sure you will do fine,” Draco soothed. “And you must get going soon.”
to tell us that Hogwarts is
"Alright, alright. Come on let's meet him." Draco ground out the words.
Draco continued to follow Harry up the stairs and trailed after the boy as he pushed a cracked door open to reveal Ron and Hermione.
"Harry?" Draco said hoarsely. He pulled away from the hug and saw Draco's grey eyes stare back at him
"That is too much like her. Don't tell her I said that, please."
“I like you, Draco,” Potter repeated. “Like, as
That night, Draco was treated with a free pass of not participating in the games of Wizard Chess that his dorm mates played late into the night.
“What do you mean?” Draco looked down at his clothes.
“I think I understand,” Harry said.
“You looked like you needed the extra minutes. Something tells me you didn’t go right to sleep after our talk.”
After a minute or two of yelling, the rattling stopped. Draco couldn’t hear momentarily, but then slowly could hear people laughing as talk started up once more. “Man, that Gryffindor got it good. Don’t you know them, Draco?” Anthony asked.

“Hey,” Anthony said. “How’s it going?”
"Well, when I took the job, I didn't expect that I'd--"
This time, he aimed after Nil, who was laughing at Harry the entire time but stopped when Harry was steering his broom directly at him. He saw Nil lean out of the way and Harry reached out with the good arm he had. He dove completely down until he rolled onto the soggy ground and stayed there. Draco’s feet instantly started moving down the row to get down to the field. An odd part of himself needed to know that Harry was okay.
, Hermione,” Draco repeated, turning her palm upwards for the next reading. Changing the topic, he asked, “What did you do for Christmas?”
“So, you already have an idea of how the future can be like?” Hermione asked.
“He was with us actually…” Ron said, looking out towards the compartment window. “I thought he was right behind us.”
have it said out loud. I absolutely despise my full name! It’s—OH, YOU PRICK!” He tore his hands away to wipe at his licked palm.
Draco turned to Hermione for an explanation.
the second half is not too far off!!
The owl was frosted at his wings and crooned half-heartedly as he dragged a large package onto the rug where Draco was once sitting.
As they walked, Hermione huffed again. "I can't believe the nerve of that woman! Inventing some stupid, non-existent love triangle between me, Harry, and
The blond laughed. “Don’t worry. In due time, they’ll ask you.”
and give it love!!!!
“Terry, we’re sorry that we didn’t listen but is this really the time?” Michael groaned.
“What?"
?” Michael saw Penelope grab a first year that managed to sneak past her by the collar. Various of older students shouted similar questions at Penelope.
“Both Ron and Hermione got prefects. So… it’s just me.”
“Of course, professor.” Harry frowned as if he just remembered that he had detention.
"STOP BEING MODEST, HARRY!" Oliver was shouting, unaware. "DON'T YOU WANT TO WIN? PUT ASIDE YOUR PINING--"
. But I’m picking the wine.”
By the time they finished their tempura ice cream at the trendy sushi place that Ginny had selected – which was better than average, he had to admit – Draco had come to a stunning realization, one that shook him to his core.
He wished, suddenly and fiercely, that he’d never come here, that he was at home in his own bed, curled up with Astoria, Scorpius slipping in-between them in the middle of the night, his small body burrowing into Draco's side, his tiny hand reaching backward for Astoria’s hand. They were a family, the three of them.
, Mr. Malfoy?”
They grabbed a late dinner at a Mediterranean place that was pretty fancy so far as Harry was concerned, although Draco griped about the fact that there was no roe on the menu, and also remarked that their olive oil was shitty. He did like whatever wine he’d picked out. Harry did, too, but he supposed he’d like any wine, since he was used to drinking firewhiskey and gin and the occasional pint.
Now he was here, in Harry’s house, all the way across an ocean, and he wondered what the hell he’d gotten himself into.
“Yes, yes, you spoiled brat. You can pick the wine,” Daphne said, rolling her eyes.
Potter’s grip tightened on the arms of the office chair that he was sprawled out on, but otherwise, he didn’t react.
quite pretty.
He tried not to think about Draco too much and mostly managed it. He considered texting him but then decided against it. He still showed up for his afternoon meeting with Horace Krump, a member of the Wizengamot, and talked to him about the Malfoy estate. His mother was from one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and he had gone to school with Narcissa Malfoy (and, as soon became apparent, had a massive crush on her), so he was sympathetic and it went well. He said he would vote in Draco's favor.
“What are you talking about?” Malfoy asked, his eyes narrowing.
And even here, as topsy-turvy as this place was, it wasn’t as though Potter had declared his love for Draco. He hated Draco less, surely. He liked him, even. But there was no reason for Draco to think it was anything more. He was doing that thing where you projected your own feelings onto someone. He felt such intense desire for Potter that he was convincing himself that Potter felt the same.
you. Because of your fucking
“Want to get some of each? We can share with everyone else.”
“I’ll miss you, too,” he said.
Draco, who knew what these things were because of his potions research, was intrigued. Scarab beetle parts were used in a variety of potions; they were very potent and contained a great deal of magic. He also knew exactly what a Sator Square was, since he had done some research regarding whether it was actually an ancient Roman recipe for a potion that extended life. He couldn’t say any of that, though, without revealing too much of himself. Instead, he licked a slow stripe along the shapes, and then bit into Potter’s skin. Potter huffed a laugh.
Then Harry blinked, as if waking from a dream, and shot up out of his seat. “I should go. I should – it’s late. Thank you for the tea. And for the talk. I promise I won’t act like that anymore. You have my word.”
He stood there for a moment mourning the loss of it, and then he decided he had to find Potter. This was stupid. The fact of the matter was that they could not afford to split up. If he needed to, he’d apologize even though it wasn’t his fault (it
“Yeah,” Draco said, nodding. He tilted his head, staring up at the soaring towers. “A bit like that.”
Harry huffed. “It’s not as though any of those are of actual concern. None of them have a chance in hell of passing.”
“Thank you, Hermione. You look sad,” said Luna, petting Hermione’s face.
Harry blinked at her. He hadn’t considered any of this. The way he figured it, they weren’t, like,
Draco, and my first instinct is to protect him. So. Maybe you shouldn’t have come to me if all you wanted was sympathy. I’m not terribly good at that anyway.” She sat back against her headboard, crossing her arms.
“Ugh, fucking Potter. Tomorrow night, then.”
Harry jumped forward, nearly knocking maybe-Tessa over, and yell-mumbled something about a drink, and then fled to the loo.
An old house elf popped into the foyer, twisting her hands around a handkerchief, her big eyes worried. “Greetings, Mistress Astoria. And, oh! Mister Harry Potter! Welcome to Greenbrush Manor! Pipsy is being pleased to be at your service. Such an honor to have you here, Mister Harry Potter.” She turned back to Astoria. “Master Blaise is with Mistress Daphne in the library. They is…they is indisposed at the moment.”
“Tiny, huh?” Potter said, smiling for the first time that morning.
Ron was back at work the next day, looking pale and hollow-eyed. Harry said hello to him coolly and they didn’t say more than two words to each other all day, which was difficult, given that they were partners. But they were in the office most of the day, and it was much easier to give Ron the silent treatment there than it would have been out in the field.
him. But in this bizarre post-war landscape, where Potter asked Draco whether he’d listened to yesterday’s Quiddich match or whether he had weekend plans, Draco found himself utterly lost. Because once the rivalry and that tangled mess of resentment had disappeared, he found he didn’t actually hate Potter at all. He was jealous of him, a bit – hard not to be, since he was the wizarding world’s brightest star – but even that was a sallow, impotent feeling. A bite with no teeth.
, but it was not the waterfall. It was only more of the courtyard. He let everything go and the door disappeared.
“You too,” Harry said, sitting. “So you found the place easily enough?”
, Hermione. Do try to keep up.”
It was rather unnerving to see the train suddenly appear at the station, blowing it’s horn loudly, without warning. Not to mention, the train was hideous, decked out in red, white, and blue stars and stripes with a giant eagle painted on the caboose. Draco felt his lip curling. Ugh, Americans, imposing their gauche nationalism on their poor Canadian brethren.
“I’ve got to, um. I’ll be right back,” Harry said. “Just wait here a second.”
"Draco!" He relaxed when he heard Michael's voice and a hand clamping down on his shoulder. "Where were you? We looked around, but I guess not hard enough." Anthony and Terry surrounded him as well.
"Right!" Ron nodded. "So... Do you know what it is, then?" he asked Draco.
Tonks yelled as she ducked, the wall behind her receiving scorch marks of a burning hole. She straightened to stare at the state of the wall.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Why're you so smiley?"
Draco couldn’t argue on that’s what it looked like. It was far from the truth, but if the idea worked…
Shivers shocked him as he stepped out into the doorstep.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, realizing that he hasn’t spoken to his godfather personally all term.
“I know, it doesn’t make sense,” Draco said lowly, aware of other students. He remembered that another--very different--tower was attacked first. “Black tried to break into the Ravenclaw’s tower? Wouldn’t it make more sense to attack Gryffindor because that’s where…” Draco trailed off. Such a bizarre change made the blond hit a wall of reasoning.
was changing and it was leaving Draco confused and his chest squirming with warmth.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Ron abruptly emptied his seat next to Harry and moved beside Hermione.
“Oh, okay.” Draco stood up. "Thank you, Luna." He excused himself from Chang.
Now that Draco was going through with the idea that he was a Seer, he needed to read up on Divination and common practices in order to pull off the guise that he was a prophetic being. Yet he wondered if he could stomach the almost ridiculousness of looking at tea dregs and having Trelawaney’s almost scary perception.
And that was the final strike.
The Minister walked out after minutes passed, his listening party following right after him. Draco looked up from his fingers. Madam Rosmerta was the last to leave the room, wiping under her eyes as she let the door swing closed, hurrying over to wait on tables.
“Malfoy, I’m about to tell you something important so listen closely." The man lowered down to make the boy look him in the eye. "Keep Potter safe."
Draco adjusted his posture and cleared his throat. “Sorry, Uncle.”
Granger held open the door as Draco and Harry dragged Ron into the small room, the warm fire making Draco shiver even more.
“I missed you.”
“He’s asked me about her.”
Creevey swung open the portrait and dashed down the stairs moments later, a giant muggle camera in his grip. He said goodbye aloud as he ran down the stairs.
"I'm sure they'll be able to figure out in due time," Draco said.
"Have we properly met?" Michael suddenly asked, turning around towards Harry, wanting to steer the conversation away from him. "I feel like we're aware of our existence, but never chatted."
His mind was muted, a steady stream of simple things. As if his head was underwater and the heavy weight of being a human was upon the surface. As long as Draco kept his head under, then this peace would remain.
