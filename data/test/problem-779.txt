November came and went, and the first week of December brought with it the first snowfall of the year. It was just a quarter of an inch, if even that, and most of the snow melted before it actually hit the ground, but it brought with it the sense that winter was really here and that Christmas was right around the corner.
On Christmas Eve, Draco went to bed early. He’d Flooed to the holiday manor his mother was spending her winter at earlier to drop off her gift, and the dinner the house elves had whipped up had been delicious. Having drunk a little more than usual, he’d collapsed in bed and gone straight to sleep when he’d gotten home.
“Look, the Aurors are here,” Harry said, pointing. And he was right – there was a large window directly across from the bottom of the staircase, and from it, Draco could see small figures in Ministry robes roaming around the lawn, trying to get the fire under control.
Draco wasn’t sure what he was expecting. From their interactions, Harvey hadn’t seemed the type to run from confrontation, but enough time had passed that Draco was no longer sure if anything was going to come of the situation at all. He’d continued visiting Madam Paccat’s on a regular basis, reasoning to himself that there was no logical reason to avoid Harvey, but it was clear from the fact that he hadn’t seen Harvey once in the last seven days when they used to practically trip over each other at the tea shop that Harvey was avoiding him.
“Oh,” Harvey said. “Um, sure. Okay. Why not.” He looked a little uncertain, but Draco, taking his tentative agreement as encouragement, pressed on.
“Not until you accept these,” Potter insisted, and Draco, realizing the futility of arguing with Potter over something this pointless, sighed internally.
Okay, not the reaction Draco was expecting. That had definitely not been a one-sided kiss. “Hey, what’s wrong? It’s okay –”
“Oh, well, there’s a brunch place nearby that I go to a lot on weekends, but I guess we can go for dinner? I mean, I’m not sure what time it’s open until, but it’s probably fine – I mean, I don’t think they would close early or anything –”
The second time, Harvey made him drink some of his herbal brew. Draco gagged and complained the entire way through, but secretly, he didn’t think it was too bad.
The restaurant turned out to be more like a diner – and what Harvey had failed to mention beforehand was that it was located in the Muggle half of the neighbourhood.
Potter, for his part, slowly lost the deer-in-the-headlights look, his expression gradually growing more relaxed as he sipped at his drink. He didn’t end up staying long, but by the time he left, there was a tentative something in the air that Draco wasn’t sure exactly how to describe.
“I normally do, but they’re going out of town until past Christmas this year. They’ll be back for New Year’s, but until then, I’ll be on my own,” Potter explained. He fiddled with the hem of his sweater. “You haven’t answered my question.”
“No, you’re not. You can’t be,” Draco said, even as there was a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. Harvey’s initial reaction to him, his green eyes, the odd meeting with Granger – it was all starting to make a terrible amount of sense. Except – “You’re nothing like him.”
“Me too.” Draco stood up, leaving a generous tip in the box at the corner of the table as he pulled on his cloak. “It was nice to meet you, Harvey Smith.”
Several things happened at once. The door flew up and out of the way, the edge hitting a wall. The vibrations sent the beams crashing to the floor and the ceiling collapsing in. The room Harry had just been in sealed itself off, and Harry landed with a breathless oomph in Draco’s arms, nearly knocking them both off balance.
They still had a lot of talking to do, Draco knew. The last few days had been a whirlwind of activities – being discharged, fending off the media, helping Harry settle into Draco’s home now that Harry’s own house was unliveable for the time being – and they’d barely had any time to sit down and figure things out.
He ignored the logical little voice in the back of his head telling him that he could always do the reasonable thing and ask Potter.
Harry stared at him for a moment, and then he started to laugh too. “I’d love to,” he said. And then he kissed Draco again.
“Er, yeah, that’s right. Of course.” Harvey nodded vigorously. “I moved here in the fall, just a few months ago, but Hermione meant, relatively, of course, that I’m fairly new compared to a lot of people here.” He seemed to be turning an odd shade of pink, although Draco couldn’t determine why. “Not as new as you, of course.”
The inside of the shop was nothing like the outside. The place was much larger than the storefront would have suggested, and not only was it clean, it was also bright and cheerful. Eccentric, mismatching tables were scattered around the store, and Draco was surprised to see that almost every single one was occupied. There was even a cozy-looking loveseat by the window, which seemed to be overlooking a view of snowfall despite the fact that it was rather foggy outside. Celestina Warbeck’s voice wailed happily over the wizarding wireless network.
“You have terrible manners,” Draco informed him, and proceeded to steal one of Harvey’s chips in return.
They both froze for a second, but neither pulled back. Draco had the fleeting, incomprehensible thought that this was like the plot in one of those terrible romance novels Pansy used to pretend she didn’t read – and then he was leaning in kiss Harvey properly with the sudden, certain knowledge that he wanted this, that he’d noticed Harvey’s eyes that first day in more than just an abstract, off-hand way.
“It’s a tea blend with bergamot, cinnamon, and herbs,” Harvey said, taking a sip with flourish. He laughed at the expression on Draco’s face. “What? Don’t like bergamot?”
“Anything to eat with that, my dear?” She motioned towards the giant printout stuck on the wall to her left, proclaiming Winter Specials!.
Work remained fairly busy, for which Draco was grateful – it kept him occupied. He left the house early most days – too early to ever run into Potter on his way to the Ministry – and by the time he got home, it was usually dark enough that he could pretend he didn’t see the other man even if Potter did happen to be coming in at the same time.
“Potter!” he yelled at the top of his lungs, trying to see through the windows, but all he could see were smoke and flames.
“What? Harvey, stop,” Draco said, reaching out for him. “What are you talking about? I need you to explain yourself, because you’re not making any sense. Did I… do something wrong?”
“I’m sorry, I know it’s late,” Harvey said. “But… I have something I need to explain. Can I come in?”
“I’m sorry, Miss, you have the wrong person,” he said, keeping his voice civil but insistent. He turned and faced the counter so that his back was to the rest of the shop until his order was ready, at which point he levitated his food with a flick of his wand and turned to look for a seat. There were two empty tables, but both were made to seat two or three and Draco had a suspicion that a nosy witch or wizard might try to join him if he were to sit there.
His eyes widened as he chewed. It was good – surprisingly good. He’d had no idea Potter could even bake, never mind bake well. Making himself a cup of tea to go with it, he settled himself down on his couch again, sighing as he dug in.
“Since when were you the type to go on suicide missions?” Harry asked, and then renewed his own Bubble-Head Charm.
“Hi Malfoy!” Potter chirped, sounding cheerful and entirely out of character. “I was baking pie earlier for dessert, and ended up making more than I should have.” He whipped his hands out from behind him, revealing a large plate. “I thought I’d bring some over to share. It’s pumpkin.”
“No, it’s really not. Merlin, this is a mess,” Harvey said, eyes wide. He ran a hand through his hair, messing it up even more. “I can’t believe I did that.”
Draco smiled back involuntarily. “So, Harvey,” he said, sitting back in his seat. “Aside from frequenting tea shops, what do you do with your life?”
And so it was with a certain amount of anticipation that he arrived outside Madam Paccat’s ten minutes before schedule. The sky was already dark, and with the end of October just around the corner, the weather was getting depressingly cold. Luckily, Draco’s cloak and boots had been made with self-heating charms woven into the material, and his scarf and gloves, which his mother had sent him last Christmas (both cashmere, of course) kept him nice and toasty.
“No no, it’s not you, I swear.” Harvey stopped, visibly taking a deep breath. “I’m really really sorry, but I can’t do this right now. I promise it’s not your fault, and I promise I’ll explain everything soon but… I just need some time right now, okay?”
“Draco!” Hermione Granger said, sounding shocked. She also seemed strangely panicked, but Draco just chalked that up to her being odd.
The man seemed to hesitate for a second, but then he shook Draco’s hand and smiled. His grip was firm. “Har – I’m Harvey. Harvey Smith.”
He jabbed his wand in the other man’s face and watched with vicious delight as a gust of wind opened the front door, picked up Potter, and deposited him outside. The door slammed with a deafeningly loud bang after him, but it did nothing to make Draco feel better.
“You just got discharged from the hospital three days ago – I don’t care what you say about being okay, you need time to recover.” She gave him a quick peck on the cheek. “Just sit here with Draco – Ron can help me.”
It helped that it turned out Potter was a rather excellent baker (not that Draco would admit it out loud), and he frequently brought over steaming plates of sweet things Draco found hard to resist.
“Draco?” Harry was speaking, sounding frantic. He seemed to be trying to pat Draco down for injuries, but Draco wasn’t exactly cooperating. “Draco, can you hear me?”
“Let’s get one thing straight, Potter. I’m not leaving unless you are too. So you can stand there and wait until the beams fall, and we’ll both die. Or, you can try to get out of that room, in which case we’ll at least have a chance of making it out of here in one piece.”
“It’s not a suicide mission, you pillock,” Draco snapped, ignoring the part of him that knew very well how dangerous this was, and how, if it had been anyone else, he probably would have waited outside until the Aurors arrived. He didn’t have time to contemplate any epiphanies though. This wasn’t the time. “Now hurry up and get out of there.”
“Who?” Harvey asked, a touch too loudly. The couple sitting next to them turned to look at them, and Harvey flushed, sinking into his seat.
He was right, but what other choice did Draco have? Leaving Harry to his own devices wasn’t an option – and for all Draco knew, Harry might be injured or knocked out. “I’m going after a friend,” Draco told the man grimly.
“I’ll be home in no time, and I have at last five other pairs in my house. Clearly you need them more than I do.”
“Look,” Potter asked one evening after he’d come over to share a plate of freshly made banana muffins. “What are you doing on Christmas Day?”
Potter momentarily turned an amusing shade of red, but then, to Draco’s disappointment, he suddenly laughed. “You are still such a twat, Malfoy. You know you wouldn’t do that – you’re my neighbour now. Drawing attention to me would only bring the paparazzi down on you too.”
“You should try everything once? What kind of bad advice is that?” Draco grumbled, but sighed, bracing himself before taking a sip.
The terrible thing was, Draco believed him. He believed that Potter was sincere, and that the other man meant what he was saying. Despite Draco’s original attempts to convince himself that Potter had merely been trying to play him the fool, he knew at the bottom of his heart what type of person Potter was. He was a Gryffindor through and through.
A lick of flame flickered a little too close, and Draco jumped out of the way a second too late. He felt the resulting welt already starting to form, but he ignored it. “Did you think I went to all the trouble of getting up here just to leave you?”
Somewhere behind them, the healers had arrived, but Draco ignored them, focusing his attention on Harry.
Draco, in return, found himself talking about his own life – how he’d decided to leave England after the war and study in France instead for his medical training, and how he’d recently come back to London to work. “I’m working mostly at St. Mungo’s now, but I’ll be the on-call mediwizard for the Hollyhead Harpies during Quidditch season,” he explained.
Draco briefly considered yelling at him and then slamming the door in his face, but the initial rage had passed, and now he was just tired. He sighed. “Do you really think that bringing me baked goods is going to make up for anything?”
Draco watched, half in fascination and half in horror. It was like watching the top layer of a familiar painting being wiped off, only to reveal a completely different picture underneath. Harvey’s hair colour was the first to change, the brown slowly melting into a jet black, and then his face was growing narrower, his lips slightly wider. His brows darkened, and on his forehead, a familiar scar appeared.
“I’d like that,” he said carefully, and watched as Potter tried but failed to hide his pleased expression. “You know,” he continued, munching on a muffin. “This doesn’t mean I forgive you, Potter.”
Draco opened his door in invitation, and it didn’t occur to him until Harvey was seated in his living room that he’d never given the other man his exact address. “How do you know where I live?” he asked, one hand inching towards his wand just in case.
“Good night,” Draco echoed, and following another, strange impulse – he seemed to be having a lot of those lately, where Harvey was concerned – he leaned over and pressed his lips to Harvey’s cheek.
Harry scowled and thought about it. Vanishing Cabinets had been used to escape from Death Eaters, right? But you wouldn't want someone at the other end to be able to accidentally interrupt your arrival, so once the connection was established, it probably couldn't be stopped until everything had come through, which in this case was the entire contents of the lake—
If only he had some means of escape. The window curtains to the right of his bed were open, the solid black mass of the lake pressed up against the heavy glass like a curtain itself, one cut from the darkest, heaviest material there was. He needed a hiding place as deep as that, a place that would black out everything.
“I just--” Harry didn’t know what to say. How could he explain what the Manor had done to him without angering Draco even further? “There was too much death in there,” he managed. “And it was--it wasn’t right.”
The next night couldn’t come quickly enough as far as Harry was concerned. His balls had ached on and off all day, as if they could sense the hours ticking down until they could empty their load down some poor sod’s throat.  It had been so fucking long since any hand but his own had touched him. There’d been a time there, right before the last battle, when he couldn’t even remember what it was like to want to. It was like some tourniquet of dread had nearly killed any desire for touch and now the blood was finally rushing back in, making him go hard at the slightest thought.
“I think it would be a very good idea. There’s so much misunderstanding. So much of a gulf that we haven’t even tried to bridge. The more reasonable faction of the Old Guard would be relieved that the Saviour is thinking of them at all. It would go a long way toward allaying fear in the old families if the things they know were officially deemed worth teaching.” Draco laughed, a suddenly open sound. “I don’t know if you’re a fool or a genius—half the Wizengamot will love you and half will hate you, which is probably normal for you, just this time you’ll have switched which half is which.”
Potter blinked at him, waiting. His eyes without his glasses looked large and unfocused, oddly vulnerable.
Pansy would most likely still be at dinner, but there was a chance Blaise might have come back early—he liked to shower after dinner, Draco knew. With any luck he'd be in the Slytherin common room, drying his hair by the fire. But even if he were, Draco realized, he wouldn't be able to so much as raise his head and look at Blaise, not if anyone else was about. To show a face that desperately needed comfort in the Slytherin common room was as good as signing his own death warrant. The safest thing to do would be to keep his head down and go straight to his room and get in bed and spell the curtains shut. He prayed no one else was already in there.
The next day Harry stood by the lake, shifting nervously from foot to foot, shivering despite his heavy cloak. He should leave. This was a bad idea. There was no situation involving the twins that ever wasn't a bad idea. It was a definitional thing, he was coming to realize. If you took your average dark lord's disregard for human dignity, added a sense of humor, and divided by two, you got Fred and George.
Meanwhile, Harry has realized he’s been too hasty in his judgement of Draco and goes looking for him. When Draco is nowhere to be found, Harry and Blaise become extremely worried that Draco may have done something rash. Harry remembers that Remus gave him good advice about Draco before, so he goes to Grimmauld Place again, hoping Remus will aid him in his search. But Remus is no help at all this time: Harry finds him drunk and feeling sorry for himself in the basement kitchen. They quarrel, and eventually Remus tells Harry to leave him alone.
Remus stood up, rubbing at his neck with a diffident air. “The point is that sometimes the things that seem most true feel that way because they’re what you believe about yourself. They don’t tell you anything about the other person. If you want to know something about someone else, you’ll have to talk to them.”
"Position, Potter. It's like riding a broom. If you don't start in the correct position, you're never going to do it well."
Blaise's mother alone was on a first-name basis with most of the Wizengamot. Theo's father had been a judge and, known Deatheater though he might be, he still knew everyone at court. Marcus's mother was the head of the Witching Circle and the influence of that wasn't to be underestimated. If he was going to get Father out of Azkaban, those were the things he needed to be focused on, not Harry Bloody Potter.
“Right. How could I possibly forget my family in a house like this? All the better that we’re here,” Draco said with a sigh, moving over to the empty portrait and knocking on its frame. “Cassiopeia can help us find the right key. She’s been here so long she knows where nearly everything lives.”
“We’re out.” Harry leapt to his feet. Water was still pouring out of the Cabinet and down the steps of the dais, waves flowing out with ever-greater enthusiasm. It smelled like the sea in here now, fresh and salty, sweeping away the melancholy odor of death.
“I love you,” Draco said desperately. “I always have. The key never changed that. I was bi before, this
But Sirius didn’t. Harry rocked back and forth, feeling young and stupid and in so much pain he could barely breathe. What did it matter if he could levitate a feather? If he wanted a feather lifted off the table, he could pick it up and waggle it about. What did it matter if he could say
Harry wasn't sure which was more remarkable—the sight of an erect cock about to enter his mouth, or the existence of someone who could just up and admit something like that. Seamus's mouth had been fucked. Seamus knew exactly what this was like and he didn't care if Harry and Dean knew about it.
Ron climbed into his own bed with a happy sigh. "Hell yes, Harry. Faster you get out of sight, the better, especially when it comes to the twins. Hang around and they're likely to get a second wind." His face scrunched up in memory. "Or start testing things on you."
"Fuck yeah, yeah, don't stop, suck me you fucking little whore." Marcus groaned and if he said anything else it was lost beneath the pure animal sound that was coming out of his throat. Which was good because Draco didn't want to hear anything more along those lines—that cut too close—at least in this situation. Maybe somewhere else, with someone else that could be fucking hot and his mind unhelpfully supplied the image of Potter, cock shoved down Draco's throat, saying horrible, brilliant, dirty things in a low voice.
"Very funny," he whispered to the Room of Hidden Things. "I get it now, okay? I know what I want. It's not hidden anymore." Well, at least not to himself. He still didn’t see how it was anyone else's business.
"Merlin, Malfoy. Of course I'll stop if you're uncomfortable. That's basic etiquette." Potter shook his head. "I'm starting to think that growing up in your House wasn’t exactly peaches and cream." He settled back, knees bent, stockinged feet flat on the bed. "Okay, ask away."
"You don't waste any time, do you Draco?" His mouth split into a wide grin and he called over his shoulder to the rest of the Slytherins behind him. "Look who's already discovered the dorm cocksucker."
He gripped Harry’s bare arse cheeks, loving the smooth skin under his hands, pressing Harry’s groin to his own, his hips rising up to match the roll of Harry’s hips, his cock thickening beneath him as he kissed and kissed Harry, pulling him down against his body, as if Harry’s weight against him could keep him from the rest of his life.
Harry heard himself give the command to the snake, but the word was in English, not Parseltongue. He tried again.
What a hell of a thing to have etched into your skin for all time. Draco involuntarily touched his forearm through his shirtsleeve. Of course, there were worse things to have burned into you.
Draco nodded again, his mind spinning. He was too nervous to be able to work out what Dawlish was getting at.
Cold and wet revenge, that's what the twins had arranged and they thought letting Harry watch it happen would make a great apology. Maybe he'd have liked it too, in theory, but here, watching it—he was feeling sicker and sicker by the moment. The floor was first slick with water then it disappeared beneath the rushing wave. Malfoy pulled himself to his feet but the water level was rising fast and already it was halfway up the bed legs.
"Of course." Harry had a sudden urge to lean over and kiss Malfoy. "What's the misunderstanding? What does Zabini mean about you telling me something?"
"Greg, that means you get to begin the negotiation." Blaise tapped his wand and a chart appeared in the air. "What's your opening bid?"
“This isn’t about me,” Harry said, feeling like he’d walked into that one, but now he was here, he might as well keep talking. “It’s about Draco.”
Draco was looking a little scared again and Harry willed himself to calm down. He wasn’t mad at Draco, God knows, or even at Cassie, or at anyone maybe except for the sheer weight of history which had been built here, stacked floor upon floor until it inevitably crushed the living.
“Which game?” Draco asked, a soft smile on his face as he inclined his head toward the lifeless, lifelike girl.
But even as he spoke, he felt a tug of guilt in his stomach. How was he ever going to tell Ron how he felt about Malfoy?
A boy. There in the distance! Padfoot bounds toward him, toward a boy smelling of fear and shame and tears and snot, and Padfoot will make it better! Here he is to make it better! He leaps up in greeting, his forepaws coming to rest on the boy’s shoulders. The boy staggers backward under Padfoot’s weight, and Padfoot licks and licks him, cleaning off the tears and pain until the boy’s skin tastes only of astonishment and relief. And then, the boy’s hands begin to pet Padfoot behind the ears!
Thank you, dear readers, for sticking with us during this longish posting pause. Although our posting frequency has slowed significantly compared to what we were able to achieve during the summer, the remainder of this fic is plotted and we will deliver more chapters as soon as we can!
he howled at the fire, but he couldn’t cast it wandlessly and nothing happened. The key blazed up, flames licking at its magic. The emerald embedded in the key’s head began to smoke. Draco hurled himself off the bed and plunged his hand into the fire, his fingers closing around the searing metal. He yanked it out and threw it halfway across the room, away from his burning palm.
“What are you doing here?” Draco snapped out, moving on to the important question. Blaise had moved closer to him, his hand within squeezing distance. “There’s nothing you need to say to me.”
Harry’s Quidditch reflexes took over--no forethought, just pure fluid motion. His left arm shot out and linked through Draco’s as his right arm swept his wand and he shouted the words of their destination. And then the Manor library vanished around them as he and Draco were tugged away, into the stomach-dropping lurch of Apparition.
"That was the first time I ever considered we might be truly different, that day we went to Ollivander's and got our wands. Same wood, same length, but different cores."
"Of course, Harry Potter, sir. Widley will be bringing them at once!" She disappeared with a pop, her toga fluttering as she went.
There wasn’t much to see. Or rather, there was plenty to see, if one liked seeing mist, as that was all there was. There was no visibility past a foot or two—the air was silvery grey, filled with a fine light fog. Light shone from somewhere, enough to illuminate the fog at any rate, though the source was unclear. Maybe the mist itself was glowing? Draco reached out and touched it, cupping his hand around a fistful of fog, which sat tamely on his palm, then flowed off and over it, like fine-grained sand.
“Christ, Malfoy.” Harry dropped lower on his elbows, his mouth coming to rest by Draco’s ear. “Say that again and I’ll come right now. Jesus.” He laughed, a soft, sex-drunk huff, and then took a few deep breaths, obviously trying to last longer.
Nev's cock slipped out of his mouth. Damn. Harry couldn't seem to keep it in his mouth without using his hands but he needed one of them to hold himself up and there was no way he could pry the other off his own cock, not with how very brilliant each additional stroke was feeling. Harry settled for sticking the tip back in his mouth and fuck if it wasn't dripping even more than before. He worked the bell-end with his lips, worrying at it as he felt his own balls draw up—
Draco felt his balls draw up, pleasure building in his cock and arcing deep inside him wherever Harry touched. “Okay,” he said. “You can--” he had to close his eyes. “Put your cock there.”
Fuck, he had, hadn’t he? “I’m terribly sorry, Potter,” Draco said, hunching in on himself as he tried to process Potter’s latest inexplicable reaction. “I was under the impression, based on your barrage of personal questions, that we’d got onto a first name basis. Please pardon my inexcusable breach of etiquette.” At least he’d got Potter off the subject of the key, though.
“Then you should have, to the best of your ability, used your rudimentary command of the English language to tell me so. Or failing that, to gesture and grunt until I’d apprehended the general idea that you wished to leave.” Two spots of color had appeared high on Draco’s cheeks, and his grey eyes were bright with anger.
"Nothing. He said I should talk to you." Potter's hands stilled on Draco's sides. "Are you angry? That I asked?"
The coldness flooded back into Draco so fast he might as well have been back in the Slytherin dorm, chilled through with ever-rising icy water. He didn't want Potter to know this. It was too raw, too humiliating. How could he tell Potter that he was permanently changed? "Did Blaise say anything about that?"
“You should see Hermione’s room now,” Ron went on happily. “That house elf who’s so gone on you--Whidby?--she Apparated my stuff right in, and you know Hermione’s really good with enlargement charms--on the room, I mean--so we’ve practically got a suite to ourselves now. Only problem was the charm faded during the night and we woke up being squished into a filing cabinet, but Hermione recast it with a double duration spell and it seems to be holding fine now.”
Ron was still grumpy by the time they started Potions. Harry had to do all the chopping and dicing and stirring—Ron just sat there, pulling long gray hairs off his wand and
Draco shivered. He knew Father’s answer: he’d rather be dead. Draco also knew his own answer: he’d rather Father was turned. Father would loathe being anything less than pureblood but how could being an ‘animal’ be any worse than being a Death Eater? Animals only killed for food, not crackpot ideology. “You said nothing had happened to him.” As if hours of terror were nothing. “What does it matter, then?”
"You'd fucking own us, that's what's terrible about it." Marcus loomed over Blaise. "Say this, do that, come here, go away. Each little favor might be tiny but with that many of them we'll be dancing to your tune all day every day!"
. He rolled onto his back and let his legs fall open. Wrapping a hand around his cock, he used his other hand to move Harry’s finger a few inches from his hole. Harry was leaning over him now, looking down at him, so Draco shut his eyes. A pillow over his face would have been better because then Potter--Harry--wouldn’t see how badly he was blushing. But the thought only flickered briefly through his mind, driven out by the need that had set every cell of his body alight.
Anyway, if he knew Pansy, there was a Muggle-born punk-rocker in her future or maybe a half-breed who specialized in werewolf outreach that would make her social-climbing mother scream just to look at. Someone as shocking and as loud as Pansy herself, someone who loved her with a passion Draco could never give her. “I do love Pansy,” he said finally.
“But he--” Harry tensed when he heard himself—that so-revealing pronoun. He’d never told Remus about his suspicions that he might like blokes better than girls, and now he’d just spilled the beans. But Remus didn’t look surprised, which was more than a little annoying. Who wants to be known better by other people than you know yourself?
Dean was watching Harry with that artist's eye of his—it made Harry feel more naked than naked, even though his eyes never strayed far from Harry's face.
Nothing happened that night. Of all the things Harry might have imagined, that would have been last on the list. He got ready for bed and the others must have all heard it was him, but no one said anything at all. Ron was awkward, not quite meeting his eye, but Neville was just Neville, completely ordinary, and Dean and Seamus had gone off to some Hufflepuff bash. Fred and George had gone to the kitchens, their mischief being apparently managed, and that was that.
He stunned an official looking merman, pushed off a rooftop, and swam with every particle of strength he had. The closer he got to the cabinet, the easier it was--he was being sucked in, he realized, as surely as if he was being poured down a drain. One last kick of his nearly exhausted legs and he was slamming forward into the cabinet, eyes nearly blinded by its strong blue glow. He raised a hand, unable to convince his body that he wasn't just going to brain himself on the rear of the cabinet.
He shot a look over at Malfoy, whose hand seemed to have left the bollocks and moved farther back. Zabini's hips were tilted up and yes—Harry felt a surge of lust shoot through him as he realized Zabini was getting fucked by Malfoy's hand. As Harry watched, he jammed his arse down, grinding on unseen fingers, while his cock stayed firmly stuffed down Malfoy's ever-working throat.
Fred finished getting to his feet, rubbing his jaw all the while. "You should have asked us first, Harry, we would have told you. I understand wanting to smack someone after getting blinkered by that albino worm but don't blame us—"
thing yesterday. “I’m sure they can’t hurt you,” he said, starting right away on his plan to be more sensitive. “They’re not even very big, as snakes go.”
, McLaggen groaned out, twisting himself on Harry's fingers. A flood of come poured across Harry's tongue and he swallowed it down, still working the cock in his mouth. He was so fucking close himself, he'd been distracted for a moment but he could feel the edge right there—
"The door," Harry said, trying to prioritize with his head rather than his cock. His cock was saying this was a rather brilliant position to have suddenly found itself in, and hey, let's spend a minute or two rubbing up against a tantalizingly wet Malfoy. "We have to get the door open."
He steadied his wand hand and pointed, and on the other side of the Veil, Draco set down the cup and did the same. Watching each other as if looking into a mirror, they called out at the same time, “Expelliarmus!”
Hermione waved that off. "It was the right thing to do. Especially if it was our fault." She turned to Harry, looking more worried. "It wasn't something you did, was it? I know the war was terrible but you wouldn't have deliberately flooded their dorm, would you?"
Harry's heart beat faster. They didn't have much time left but Malfoy couldn't think of any reason this wouldn't work and he was nearly as smart as Hermione. He grabbed Malfoy's hand and tugged him until they stood directly in front of the door. "Get your wand ready. They'll work underwater, don't worry about that, just put everything you have into it."
"Anyway, it's good timing," Seamus said. He looked Harry up and down appreciatively. Harry resisted the urge to cover his cock and cower, like some kind of cherub in an overly pink painting.
Harry moved behind him, wrapped one arm around Malfoy's waist, and covered his hand on the wand. "I think I proved your wand works for me," he said, not able to help the smile that curved his lips up as he pressed them to Malfoy's neck. "Come on now. The wand just directs the magic. We'll let our power flow through it together."
Dawlish’s frown, however, had settled on a kitchen elf who had come to pick up the morning carrots. Draco bit his lip, even more uncertain now. What did Dawlish want, if not to simply yell at Draco? He followed Dawlish meekly as the Auror prowled through the garden.  Dawlish usually called Draco to the headmistress’s office for his probation check-ins. Dawlish liked the trappings of power there. He liked sitting in the headmistress’s chair, filled with the righteous feeling of being on the right side of the desk and the right side of the law. So why had he called Draco to the garden today?
“So, Potter,” he said in the poshest voice he could manage. “Now that you’ve kidnapped me, what do you plan to do with me?”
Potter, thanks to your encouragement that he violate the terms of his parole, which expressly prohibit his leaving--the two of you have nevertheless convinced yourselves that Malfoy has committed suicide by locking himself in the Vanishing Cabinet, the destroyed twin of which is sitting at the bottom of the lake?”
Malfoy hesitated, then grinned. "You want to ask a question? Beat me at a game. Winner gets to ask whatever they want, no holds barred. Loser has to answer."
Draco’s wand was moving already, though. The bedclothes peeled smoothly off the bed, stacking themselves neatly on a chest of drawers. Then the mattress was moving too, sliding off the bed to stand against the wall, taking its bed skirts with it. Harry was too confused, too unwillingly interested in what exactly was happening to pull them away now. Cassie was bouncing up and down in place, excited, hands clapping as the base of the bed was revealed.
“I never--” Draco began, and then thought better of it. If Tonks thought he’d done a good deed, better to let her think it. “Is my father all right?” he asked instead.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand instead of answering. The warmth was returning, but with it came the thudding feel of Draco’s pulse, which seemed to be hammering along at far too fast a pace. “Adders are a protected species now, did you know that? There are so few of them left that it’s illegal to hurt them.”
Neville looked very like he'd rather be about anywhere else, but a glare from Harry seemed to decide him that it was safer to do as he was told. He pulled off his shoes, one by one, and his socks, one by one, placing them in his shoes and then neatly putting his shoes under the bed. Then—after a glance that confirmed he had better keep going—he clambered onto the bed and climbed over Malfoy, apologizing profusely as he went.
He pushed into Malfoy's mouth and for a moment there was more of that uncertainty, then their heads were tilting and Harry was falling forward into a tangle of hands in hair and warm welcoming tongue, and hips that pressed eagerly into his own. There was an answering hardness swelling there and his cock was completely on board with forgetting about the whole death-by-drowning thing in favor of the need that was seizing hold of him, spiraling up from his groin and making him shake with pleasure.
When he could make himself look up, McLaggen was beaming down at him. "Same time next week? I can't give you more than once a week—sorry, Harry, not even for you—there's just too many people who need what I can give them. It wouldn't be fair."
It was dark. Draco blinked as his eyes adjusted, feeling more than seeing Dawlish arrive beside him in the memory. Slowly the space around him resolved into a stone cell. Moonlight, bisected by metal bars, shone through a small window set high in one wall.
“Draco’s not at Azkaban, Harry. Nor is his father. Malfoy senior has been removed from the prison and placed under house arrest in Wiltshire--”
“Of course you were,” Remus said, his words slurring a bit, either from the whiskey he’d been drinking or from the shock. “We knew that. It’s just, you know, being beyond the Veil is the same as being dead, in case no one ever told you that, you stubborn shaggy monster dog. Happy birthday, by the way. You always did have a flair for the dramatic.”
“What do you mean, don’t worry?” Harry resisted the urge to preemptively cover his hair. “You’re not the one with a head of hair that literally everyone ever has told me looks like a bird’s nest. What if it looks like a bat’s nest too? A nice, tempting black-hatched, raise-a-family-of-little-baby-bats-in kind of place—”
"Can you? Can you understand that while sending your child to Hogwarts for a first-rate magical education is necessary, it also represents a very real risk for the upper-crust? Your precious only son, sharing a common room with a half-dozen pureblood girls whose parents are pushing them to lure him into bed?" Zabini twitched his wand and the equation began to spin. "If your son gets some pureblood girl up the duff, Potter, he's got to marry her. You might be able to ignore a Muggleborn's bastard, but if some pureblood's precious flower lures your son into an ill-considered liaison, you're buggered. There's nothing you can do. He's got to marry her and her family—whether you care to be allied with them or not—has just gotten their foot in your ancient family door."
"It's Draco Malfoy," Draco husked, gulping back a yelp of fear and managing to stifle the impulse to reach for his wand. He took a deep breath and glared at them. Bloody fucking Aurors, drawing a bead on the heir to the estate they were guarding. "Auror Tonks sent me," he said, the lie slipping easily from his mouth. "To speak with the prisoner. My father," he added, and then wished he hadn't.
He made it to the gate barely registering the gravel drive beneath his feet or the familiar height of the towering dark hedges. No apparating away from the Manor—he could still feel the anti-casting spells the Aurors had placed-so he had to step outside and walk down the long drive, hunched against the wind, snatches of their laughter falling like blows against his ears.
“You do still love me,” he said softly, slowly, as if trying out a phrase in a foreign language. “After everything. And you’re here. Trying to save me again.” He bent down and picked up the cup, still empty. “Tell me again,” he said.
Another bark. He couldn’t leave a dog alone in here. Draco turned in the direction of the sound, which seemed to be coming from somewhere off to his right. It was slow going—he had to wait sometimes, long spaces of time between barks when he’d start to wonder if he’d been imagining things. Then another bark would come and he’d hurry in that direction, following the ever-louder sound. It was slower going than he’d like but at last in addition to the deep ‘woof, woof’, he caught sight of a darker shape in the mist ahead.
"See? I said I'd show you." Potter pulled Draco's arm a little higher, forcing him into an undignified squeak.
"Having destroyed their home," Professor McGonagall continued, "it is only right that you should open your own to them."
Harry nodded. The water was already at the level of the tiny hole they’d already made. It was squeezing through and trickling down the other side drop by drop. They put their wands together, both of them closing their hands over both lengths of wood.
Padfoot tears across the dark stone floor, the cabinet somewhere in the maze-like recesses behind him, the stink of a house he dislikes clotting his nose but there there
He reaches the Place and noses among the rubbish disgorged by the cabinet. Empty bottles that he knows from experience will sting his nose with their fumes, empty chocolate wrappers, and, when he’s lucky, plates full of food that seem to have been only picked at before being discarded here. These meals he eats gratefully (though they make his shrunken stomach wake up enough to cry terribly with hunger afterwards), but it is not for the food that he comes; it is for the other thing. The dog noses around the edges of the pile until he finds it. A jumper full of holes, covered in his own black hair. He noses at the collar and his body bursts open in feeling.
"You're lying," Harry said, feeling a wild hope ignite inside him. "Ron was the last one out before it was you and me, George. You can't tell me Ron wants to suck cock. I know he doesn't."
Their rude replies barely registered; Draco was used to those now. All he listened for was the 'yes' and he had that—they weren't going to stop him. The image of the bed he'd shared with Harry in the hidden curl of the Gryffindor tower seized him with a physical need. He wanted to be there. He felt, somehow, if he could just find his way back to that bed then he could find his way back to that time when Harry had been holding him, whispering words of love in his ears.
“Fuck off, George.” The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he had time to think. “And you too, Fred. The both of you can fuck right off.”
But there wasn't. "See," Seamus was telling Dean. "You just push right here." He dug his thumb into a spot just below Harry's ear.
"Harry." Ron sat down on the side of the bed. He gave Harry a long, solemn 'Percy Weasley, Prefect' kind of look.
Just like that, he was hard. It wasn't the kind of revelation he wanted, to be honest. He didn't want to be on his knees, clamped in place by one dorm-mate, who was humming something that sounded like 'Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love' while another not-so-gently laved his cock across Harry's tongue.
Harry's fist flared with pain. He yelped but it was lost beneath the din—Fred yelling out, Gryffindor confusion, Slytherin glee. He called his wand and stalked toward Fred, who'd landed on the floor by Neville's bed. A corridor had opened in the crush and Harry raised his wand, his head filled with the image of Malfoy drowning in his own dorm room, blue and cold and alone. If Harry hadn't gotten in—
Finally, there the village was, ahead of him. Vague shadows resolved into clearer shapes of underwater houses, spread apart at first then closer and closer together and he had to be near to where he'd seen the first cabinet fall. The water churned in front of him and a merman appeared, spear pointed directly at Harry.
Draco considered for a moment but he already knew what he really wanted to ask. "How did you inherit the old Black place? The one in London. I've never been able to figure that out."
Harry tightened his grip, solely for the purpose of making it easier to growl in Malfoy's ear. Not to comfort him. "I've come up with four plans and you haven't thought of a single one! So who's the useless berk here, huh?"
something’s happened to him,” said Harry desperately. “He might have gone to Azkaban to try to save his father all by himself, he doesn’t know that Remus sent the Aurors to get the werewolf out of his father’s cell. Or he might have--I don’t know, you know him better. What does Draco do when he’s upset? Like, really really upset?”
They had gone down one final flight of stairs, ending in a hallway where the portraits wore robes that were utterly wizarding in design and yet still somehow screamed Victorian. Maybe it was the generally air of stuffiness: collars buttoned tight and high, the excessively ruffled robes, or the monocle on one particularly irritated-looking geezer who sneered wordlessly down at Harry. Maybe it was the distance they’d come down, about halfway back to the first floor which equated to about two centuries in Malfoy generation time, Harry guessed. Or maybe it was the newspaper the mutton-chopped old wizard in the portrait next to him was holding, dated November 1855.
So of course Neville was here, eyes wide, watching Harry irrevocably screw things up with Malfoy. It was their thing, apparently. Any time there was a contender for Worst Day of Harry's Life, fate sent Neville along to watch it. Poor twat must be about as sick of it as Harry was.
“It will work,” Harry insisted. He just knew it would. It was right because it was his spell. His favorite, his father’s favorite, the spell which had saved him from Voldemort in the end.
Nott muttered, and the stone wall slid open with a hiss. "After you, Malfoy," he drawled, extending his arm.
The shout came from behind Draco. He whirled around in time to see a vaguely familiar-looking Auror with a round face and spiky hair advancing toward him, her wand drawn at shoulder height.
"Right." Potter looked pleased at that thought, for some reason. Then he grabbed his sweater and pulled it off, pushing it past the bed-curtain to flop onto the floor. His hands went to his tie next—that slithered off into a heap next to them—then his fingers went to his shirt buttons. "Come on. You too. We need to get out of these wet things." He flushed, then went ahead and added a
“Wait! Please don’t Incarcerous me," Draco blurted. "I got Dawlish the key because he put a werewolf in Father’s cell, he said Father would be killed or turned if I didn’t give it to him. If you don’t believe me, go to Azkaban and check, please check, the full moon’s tomorrow and the werewolf is still there, and I swear I wouldn’t have violated my parole--”
brought in for violating your parole, they'll let you off, seeing as you've just given us information leading to the arrest of those engaged in prisoner abuse.”
They came warily, climbing in through the portrait with as little enthusiasm as sausages approaching the pan.
“Shit.” Harry leaned back heavily against the wall. “I forgot your contract works differently. I am a prat. But there must be a way for you to get out of it.”
I’ll do anything to free my father, he meant to say. But the words stuck in his throat. Would he really do anything?
George leaned forward. "If you're safe, you leave the room. Eight, then seven, then six, etcetera, until it's just two left."
Actually, Professor Sprout had smiled kindly and said she didn’t want Draco to get hurt, so best they did this part together, right love? Draco remembered it distinctly. It had been the first kind smile he’d gotten since returning to Hogwarts and it had, horrifically, made his eyes well up with tears. Sprout had pretended not to notice, which had earned her whatever portion of Draco’s undying love the smile hadn’t already earned. “There’s nothing for the kitchen in there, sir. It’s really not part of my—”
Anyway, he couldn’t have walked beside them. The corridors they were moving through were narrower, more intimate, the width that seemed to mark the family hallways rather than the more public entertaining spaces, and there was only room for Draco and Cassie to walk abreast. Especially given the way they were jokingly pushing at each other like Draco had reverted back to being six years old too. And now they were nudging at each other, whispering to each other, Cassie tugging at his arm until he bent his head down so she could whisper something else in Draco’s ear—
It takes the boy forever to understand that he should follow Padfoot, but then they’re off, and Padfoot is leading the way! He takes the boy straight to the cabinet, where he gobbles an old sausage in celebration and then retrieves the Remus jumper and worries it back and forth in his teeth because this boy must be made to understand the importance of the jumper.
“He’s dead,” Harry said, his voice just as wobbly as Remus’s. “Truly gone. Finished. I’m going to be an Auror when I graduate next spring, and... oh, Sirius, we all thought—” He broke off, not wanting to cry again, but it was too late; he was already crying. And it didn’t matter, because Sirius’s arms were around him once more.
Draco wobbled. Father was still alive. For all the horror Father had dragged him through, Draco still couldn’t bear to see him hurt. That softness, he supposed, was what had made him such a terrible Death Eater. It could make him a good son, though, if it helped him do whatever it took to save his father, right?
“But if all the cabinets were set to receive only,” Remus said, “how did you manage to get back through?”
Hermione nodded to him, Head Girl to Prefect, and Harry relaxed. Maybe between the pair of them they could keep the Gryffindor/Slytherin murder rate reasonably low. Anyway, it wasn't his problem. What he really needed was to get over to Malfoy—
It chilled him to the bone within minutes, charm or no charm. The token in his hand tugged him downward and he started swimming, letting it guide the way. Harry touched his wand and whispered a spell and his eyes adjusted, letting him see in the ever-more-murky light as the token led him deeper and deeper into the lake.
“What the fuck did you just do?” Harry jumped off the bed, angry magic surging through the room. Draco felt all his hair stand on end.
Harry stared at Remus as he unwillingly felt a creeping swell of self-recognition. Was that what he’d been waiting for this whole time with Draco, a betrayal? Had some part of him  scrutinized everything Draco did, at one level or another, looking for that?
The lip of a glass phial was being pressed against Draco’s lips. Instinctively he jerked his head away, but some of the liquid went in. Draco sputtered and coughed, his mouth burning with what seemed to be pineapple-flavored firewhiskey.
By the time he'd pulled himself out of a fantasy of blond hair, pouty mouth gone thick with drool, and enticing gag noises coming from the back of that over-entitled prick's mouth, the wand was already slowing down.
, it could have been a lot worse,” Dudley pointed out and winked at his brother in law. Ernie smiled gratefully and raised his glass in salute.
“Ten minute walk, five minute cab ride,” Harry told him as he flagged down a cab and held the door for him.
“Hey there, Har. So, you’ve got this ball of energy all weekend?” Thyme snickered, their face alight with mischief.
Raucous, upbeat laughter was exchanged between the two new flatmates as they played Uno and told each other amusing stories.
“We’ll be there. Charlie’s been wanting to check up on Draco. This gives him an excuse to without looking like he’s hovering,” Thyme waved as they went to talk to another parent.
“That’s my friends’ son Teddy. He’ll be six the week before Christmas. His dads are on holiday and we’re babysitting,” Harry explained briefly to Olivia.
“How could I be so stupid?” Draco pushed his plate away and laid his forehead on the table as he began to cry. “When I met Gil, I was a poor and struggling to pay for college. He was one of my professors. I was very, very innocent then.”
“Of course not, you’re an angel,” Harry said sarcastically. “I am rather glad you saved me the trouble of punching him in his bigoted mouth. Asking you all those personal inappropriate questions about your disability.”
“Fine, play that game. I’m calling the store owner, and having you barred from coming back,” Harry warned.
“Harry, we’d better get a move on,” Hermione said from the doorway. “The shelter locks the doors at nightfall.”
“Rolf, have you seen my phone?” Harry called. Draco had messaged him the night before to tell him he was on his way home.
“Draco, please. I know I’m the last person in the world you want to listen to right now, but hear me out,” Liv soothed. “I don’t believe he will kill him. What he needs most is money. You’re a very wealthy man. You could pay his way to a place the American and British authorities can’t touch him.”
“They are rather disgusting with their affection sometimes,” Harry teased. “I’m glad to hear you say that. Remus is the past. He holds a very special place in my heart, and while I do love him, that love isn’t romantic and never will be again. That place in my heart, the one reserved for my soulmate, has only ever been yours.”
“How are you, Dragon?” Harry winced as he moved from his wheelchair to the seat next to his husband’s in the cafeteria. They’d gotten married the weekend after Harry was released from the hospital. It was a small, quiet, and peaceful ceremony and reception. A bright spot in between all the dark clouds.
“Mr. Potter, you did well today,” Lockhart had held Harry back after class. “Very well indeed.” He went to kiss Harry, and Harry took a step back.
“Hello Draco, I’m Dr. Benson. I’m a psychologist and private investigator,” Olivia held out her hand.
Draco reached out and grabbed his wrist to stop him. “Kiss me.” Harry swallowed hard as he leaned in to press his lips against Draco’s. The kiss quickly evolved from the gentle ones they’d shared the previous afternoon to something raw, intense, and passionate.
“It’s a cycle,” Charlie said with a melancholy look on his face. “Gil always says he’ll do better, but then he eventually goes back to controlling him.”
“Why would I be? Yes, Harry told me everything. I also talked to Charlie,” she smiled understandingly. “Want my advice? Ditch that controlling arsehole and see where it goes with Harry. None of his friends saw him as happy with anyone as they did you. Not even Remus.”
“Defense request granted. We’ll reconvene tomorrow at nine thirty,” Liz banged her gavel, dismissing the court.
“It’s a shop that features the books, art, and merch of local queer and trans folks. A third of proceeds go to charity, a third to the artists, and the other third is split between me, Charlie, and Dudley,” Harry said excitedly. “I started working there shortly after I was kicked out. My job and Theo Nott’s YouTube videos saved my life.”
“Sounds good. I want a ham and cheese sandwich, crisps, and orange juice,” Dudley said as he gave him the money to pay for it.
“Let me fix you up,” Sirius said over lunch three days later. “The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.”
“Luna this is Draco,” Harry told her. She pushed him gently aside and grabbed one of Draco’s hands with both of hers.
“I got these out of your suitcase. Mione found it in the bushes. Lunch is ready. I hope you like five cheese lasagna.” He smiled at him once more, and went back downstairs.
“Yeah, I had to borrow it. The battery on mine died,” Rolf replied as he came into the kitchen wearing a wetsuit.
“That was actually part of a prank television show,” Harry told her. “Their friends and the Imagine Dragons made them do it.”
I want everyone who is pro defunding and abolition of police to know that I see you and I hear you. My own work in progress has detectives in it, and going forward I'm willing to create alternative lines of work for those characters. I'm currently and will continue to educate myself.
“It would have been better if he’d disclosed wanting an open relationship from the start,” Draco said pensively. “There’s nothing wrong with non-monogamy, but there is something very wrong about not telling someone that’s what you want.”
“He was in a bad car accident. I don’t know if they’ve tried to resume the adoption process yet or not,” Harry told him. “They were going to adopt a young boy named Teddy. He’s five and in need of a home right away. Most people want babies and toddlers. Remy and Siri don’t care about that.”
“You shouldn’t be walking, love. Those ribs won’t be fully healed for at least another month,” Draco fussed as he gently squeezed his shoulder in lieu of a hug. “I feel a little bit better. I told everyone what he did. Win or lose, I’ll never regret that decision.”
On a lighter note, here's a post I wrote for Draco's 40th: https://accordingtorory.net/2020/06/05/the-serpentine-perspective-happy-40th-birthday-draco-malfoy/
let him keep me from being happy,” Draco said determinedly. “I wanted you before this happened. I still want you now.” Harry took Draco by the hand and led him to his bedroom.
“Harry Potter,” Harry replied as he shook Draco’s hand. “My coworker is my brother Dudley and the shop owner is our friend Charlie.”
“Someplace quiet,” Lockhart replied coolly. He parked his car next to a rundown four door. He reached into the backseat and pulled out a rope and some duct tape. He locked up his car and opened the trunk of the four door. “Come here.”
“Sorry I fell asleep. Did I miss lunch?” Draco yawned. He slowly took the washcloth off of his eyes and looked at Harry. He simply smiled and showed him a set of clean clothes.
The sound of gently splashing water drew Harry towards the center of the conservatory. He pushed back a feathery fern and found himself looking at a simple marble basin, in which bubbled a small, bright fountain. Staring at the water, Harry suddenly felt desperately thirsty. It was a bone-deep need, something which the moment he felt it he realized was normal for him—a thirst that had entered him the moment his mother had fallen to the floor in his nursery, dead in a burst of green light.
Thank you for reading, with special gratitude to those of you who have been following along since we began this fic over two years ago! Real life has intervened a lot since then, with a move across the country for one of us, a couple of job changes for another, and collaboration on the writing and publication (!!!) of an original novel. And then there's the global pandemic thing—that slowed us down a bit as well. But we are happy to report that this fic will be completed just a couple of weeks after this chapter posts. (We promise! the epilogue is already written and is going out for beta very soon!) In the meantime, please come say hi
When Draco looked up, Blaise was studying him. Draco let his hand drop, suddenly self-conscious. Blaise would never say anything, especially at a time like this, but he knew when Draco was hurting. Physically, and otherwise. Draco jerked his eyes away, looking up at the chart instead. He'd missed what Theo had said, but the offer was on the chart already in cool black ink. Two sucks for two favors, medium sized, up to a size of twenty-five each.
An apple, bright-red, gleaming, dangled from a branch. Focus on that, he told himself. Breathe. Don’t panic. His heart wasn’t listening—it rabbited along, knocking out a rhythm that said
The wand began to twirl again, light flashing from one to the next, fast at first then ever slower: Seamus, McLaggen, Ron, Harry, George, Fred, Seamus, McLaggen, Ron, Harry, George, Fred--
“Just take a pinch of powder,” Slughorn continued, steering him into the fireplace as if Draco were a Muggle-born first year who’d never seen a Floo before. “Now stand up straight, that’s it.”
On the plus side, Harry thought as he went into his dorm-room, it meant he had a few free periods with no one else around and no stupid extra duties to attend to. He dropped his books and threw himself on his bed feeling pleasantly free for the moment.
“Wait, no, never mind, I don’t care how they know as long as they know it’s not twilight.” Harry stayed as close behind them as he was willing to get to Wax Girl, while mindful of the fact that the guano might start oozing back onto the path if he waited too long. “Let’s move on to the more pertinent question here, which is why are there bats in your library?”
didn't need to fake his enthusiasm and he didn't need to set a time limit either. He could make every last one of them come as fast as he pleased, whether they wanted to drag it out or not. He might not have gotten much studying in last year but he'd sure as fuck learned how to suck cock.
“No need, no need.” Fred adopted a conciliatory tone. “Harry here has already figured out the loophole, haven’t you, Harry-lad? If you refuse a request and the contract magic starts squeezing your bollocks, there’s nothing says you can’t just hex the bloke who asked you for a suck. When he withdraws the request, your bits swing easy again. Nothing to it.”
Harry glanced at Fred, who was grinning as well, and then at Ron, who shrugged. “If it were up to me mate,” Ron said, “I’d hex ‘em off anyway. It’d serve them right.”
Draco glanced over at Harry, who was now snoring gently at the ceiling. How was it possible that anyone could sleep through the deafening crack of house-elf apparition? On the other hand, if anyone could, of course it was Potter. Draco had been watching him at breakfast in the Great Hall for six years, and he knew what Potter was like in the mornings. The gorgeous git could barely butter a piece of toast before 8:00. If the Dark Lord had scheduled their duel-to-the-death for sunrise, Voldemort would definitely have won hands down.
"I'll take that for a 'no'. What you said is true of course—and deplorable, in my opinion—but deep-seated prejudice is hardly the only pureblood tradition." Zabini flicked his wand and the equation smoked harder then disappeared in a puff of cinnamon-scented ash. Another equation, blue and pulsing, took its place. "Pureblood society is all about breeding, you understand that?"
"Oh, it'll still work," George said abstractly, as Fred levitated the now door-less cabinet over the lake, guiding it toward deeper water. He handed Harry a small metal token. "Take this. It'll show you the way to the treat we've got for you.
Dawlish’s gaze swept restlessly over the garden, presumably searching for anything out of order he could bring Draco to task for. His nose crinkled and for one absurd moment Draco wanted to apologize for caring for the garden so well. If he’d known Dawlish wanted to vent his spleen on someone today, he could have had a mistake prepared. He could have had an unweeded patch, a desiccated fern, or a dying tree.
Blaise was opening his mouth to say something utterly amusing (in his own eyes) when the click, click, click of heels echoed down the dungeon hall. Draco stiffened.  Every Slytherin knew that sound—they could navigate around it in the dark, like bats avoiding a hungry eagle-owl.
Harry couldn't even go back to sleep. It was still dark out—the days got short early in Scotland—but it already had the feel of morning. Harry checked the time, groaning a little when he saw the green numbers that puffed from the end of his wand. It was even later than he'd thought. "Ron. Time to get up."
Anyway, the water was now rippling across Harry's nipples, and it was chilling and scary and uncomfortably stimulating all at once. "I'd, er, rather spend my final moments doing something else. Not that I think these are our final moments, okay? I'm just taking a quick mental break on making plans."
He grabbed his cock. Precome had slicked it up and it didn't take more than three quick, hard pulls before he was shooting long pearly ropes across the wet floor. He groaned, quiet as he could, and shook, and sat back, thinking hard.
Draco realized what Harry meant to do just before he did it. He put up a hand to stop Harry, but not in time—Harry was already leaping through the Veil into the Cabinet. Water sloshed around his waist, but it was pleasantly warm now, and felt weirdly comforting as it soaked through his jeans. Draco flung his arms around him, and for a moment they clung to each other, Draco’s jaw pressed against Harry’s temple, Harry’s mouth lodged beneath Draco’s ear. Then Harry felt the water sloshing against the sensitive skin of his nipples and disentangled himself to move behind Draco, wrapping his arms around him from behind. We’ll do it together,” he said. “Just like before.”
Draco kicked back in his seat, forcing himself to relax as the wand started to spin again. Or at least, to look relaxed. His mind was wandering now, though, turning again and again to thoughts of Father in Azkaban. Had they fed him tonight? Was he cold? Was he in pain? Was he scared?
Draco knew he could beat that offer. Hell, everyone knew he could beat that offer. The things that had been going on last year at the Manor were hardly a secret in Slytherin House—they all knew what Draco'd had to do, given the favors he'd needed just to get by. The question was, how much was he going to have to give in return?
“Fuck off, you.” Draco scowled, trying to banish from his expression whatever Harry was making fun of, but then Harry ran a finger across Draco’s jaw and over his lips and Draco felt his something in his chest go way beyond soft and straight into wobbly.
“What do you think?” Harry asked, moving to stand beside Draco at the foot of the bed, close enough to feel the heat of his body, but not quite close enough to touch. “Do you think it would be a good idea?”
. Which was a stupid thing to think but damn it all, he’d been trying so hard to be good and now the one person who, more than anyone, was supposed to be keeping him on the right track was instead forcing him to break the rules.
The lights were out and Harry was in bed alone. Not that he was disappointed--of course, he was bloody lucky to be left alone. Still, he wondered if that was going to be it. If the whole thing was going to be a laugh that no one ever mentioned and certainly weren't going to do.
Or maybe he could try to take Luna away from Neville? It wouldn't be nice but everyone who'd been there tonight would talk about it and if they were talking about him and a girl, pretty soon they'd forget all about that other stupid stuff he hadn't really wanted to do.
A dry cough brought Draco back to himself. Dawlish was standing at the edge of the grove, looking terrifyingly formal in his Auror robes. He looked like Judgement itself standing there and Draco half-expected him to say there’d been a mistake, that Draco actually had been sentenced to Azkaban, that he was here to take Draco away, to pull out a pair of magic-dampening cuffs and Apparate them directly into a dark cell with his own personal Dementor waiting for him even though you couldn’t Apparate directly into Azkaban and supposedly they didn’t have Dementors there anymore, which was only thanks to Harry anyway.
Draco's cock popped out. Potter stuffed it back in but he couldn't seem to figure out where to put his hands, not and hold himself up at the same time. A graze of tooth—Draco winced—
Potter's eyebrows raised but the sneakoscope had already started to spin and after a second he seemed to get it. "Oh. I see. You're testing to make sure it works."
"That's how the other blokes who suck me like to do it. Don't need a hand to hold yourself up that way. You can do right by me while still getting yourself off."
The sound that went right to his heart though, was a different one—it was the faint scratching of magic across paper on the chart over their heads. Marcus's vote, going to Draco. He had won.
Fred was out. Or maybe that was George. Harry couldn't be bothered to try to check the freckle pattern. He was already leaving the room, giving a happy smack to the back of the other twin's head, which meant it was probably Fred. He gave more head smacks. George gave more head ruffles.
Anger layered on top of incomprehension. Harry balled up fistfuls of leather, sinking his fingernails through the traces of motorcycle grease. “How could you think that about Sirius?” burst out, loud and fierce. “He loved you!”
Which could only mean one thing: once again, Harry Potter had gotten Draco Malfoy into a shitload of trouble that Draco would never have found on his own.
"What favors do you need? What are you talking about?" Harry pushed off the wall too, landing with a thump that sounded angry even to his own ears. "Protection, is that it? Are they fucking with you? Hurting you?"
"So?" Fred—it had to be Fred, his shrug was absolutely infuriating. "The Room of Hidden Things is part of the Room of Requirement. We just required it to stop being destroyed."
Potter's glance strayed to the sneakoscope, which hadn't budged. Draco knew it wouldn't. He was telling the absolute truth about this. He tucked into his pie happily, waiting for the follow-up question.
His father blinked at him, and for a moment Draco was filled with hope. Father had heard, had understood?
Zabini came over and stood beside them. He was wearing nothing but a bathrobe and a pair of shower sandals, and a miniature cauldron of bath products hovered at his side like a well-trained puppy. “What’s going on then?” he asked, looking from Nott to Harry.
"I sure hope so," George said. He pointed at the wand. It had come to rest with its end directly fixed on him. The light shone on him, leaving Harry in the dark.
Potter was running a reverent hand over it, stroking it up and down, watching it grow thicker and purpler by degrees. "Good choice," he said, thumbing the vein over and over until Draco had to pull back with a cry. Pre-come was already beading at the tip and this could be over far too fast if he didn't slow them both down.
In our defense, the full moon in November, 1998 really does fall on the 4th, the day after Sirius's birthday. Clearly the heavens were aligned for angst, so what could we do?
"I'm trying to get you naked. In my bed. After kissing you. What do you think I want?" Potter paused in his unbuttoning, leaving an enticing sliver of chest on view. "Wait, am I being rude? Do you want to be seduced? Here—" He waved his hand again. A box of chocolates shot through the slit in the bed-curtains, sideways on, like a small beribboned missile.
Zabini looked like he might sick up. “He thought about it once. Right after the war. Pansy and I made him promise--bloody fucking hell, Potter, what did you do to him? What the fuck did you do to him?”
3rd November. Sirius would be thirty-nine today if he had lived. Harry’s sides ached with the tears he was suddenly holding back.
“I’ll do one better than that.” Dawlish turned back toward Father. “I’ll give you a chance for it to be neither.”
“I’ve got it,” Draco shouted. He whipped around, his wand pointing out toward the mist. “Accio Vanishing Cabinet.”
He wasn’t going to cry. Only who would have thought that inside all Harry Potter’s headstrong reckless power, his magic that crashed headlong through the world and never looked to see what destruction it left in its wake, who would have thought that inside it was such terrible gentleness, such stillness, such love?
Harry felt himself flush, though he didn’t think Draco could see it in the evening light. “It’s the hotel where Ron and Hermione went to celebrate her nineteenth birthday a few weeks ago,” he admitted. “Just the two of them. It’s… you know. The kind of place you spend a weekend with  your… with your….  Oi, look. Over there. I bet that’s it.”
The Vanishing cabinet was dry inside, for which he felt oddly grateful. He remembered from last time that the connection with the other cabinet could be tricky to establish but once it happened, the transition from one cabinet to the other was very sudden.
Draco turned his head away, trying not to let the surging anger and frustration and sheer need to scream show on his face. It wasn’t
“No.” Harry set down the cup and raised his wand again. “I mean, yes, but not just you. We should do it together, at the same time.”
, a voice whispered inside him.  A tendril of excitement twisted at the thought, much as he wanted to squash it. If Malfoy got picked, then there was no denying he liked blokes as much as Harry did. It was as good as Veritaserum as far as this particular question went and oh, Harry desperately wanted to know the answer.
Malfoy tipped his head, looking for all the world like Neville on a bad Potions day: hopelessly lost, utterly confused. "You really mean I don't owe you a favor?"
Harry settled back on his haunches. "Right, yeah, get your little jab in. That's fine but just tell me what you meant." He gave Neville's cock a little pump, more a promise of action than an actual hand job.
Potter wasn't half bad himself, Draco realized as he finally got the git completely naked. That lovely brown fur ran down and curled around the base of a cock that was temptingly fat. Draco could imagine it stretching his arsehole, making him kick and wriggle and beg for it to stop, all the way up until he started to beg for it to fuck him harder.
The potion burned his throat, but as it reached his stomach, Draco felt it begin to work almost immediately, slowing his racing heart and sending a curious tingling feeling through his arms and legs.
me, Harry, Blaise showed me that, and I love you. I didn’t lie about that. Only I needed the grimoire key for Dawlish and I knew you wouldn’t understand, because you hate my father but it was the only way to save him, so I--”
“Of course,” Draco said and Harry wanted to hold up a hand and fend off this new of course because he wasn’t going to like it and pureblood Studies was a stupid idea because all of this stuff was better forgotten, not talked about and certainly not continued.
"See," Malfoy said as he picked up Zabini's full bollocks and rolled them gently back and forth, letting them tighten in his hand. "A good suck isn't just about going straight for the cock and cramming it in. Start a little slower. Pay attention to other places." He reached his other hand up, skimming it over Zabini's toned stomach and lightly muscled chest. He brushed a nipple and was rewarded with a gasp and a jerk. "Above
“You were going to tell me,” Harry said, his voice low, “how I should get you off. You want me to suck you?”
. It seemed to be Neville's curse to be caught in the background of the most angstful moments of Harry's life. That year when Voldemort had been sending Harry nightmares, Neville had been across the room, watching with scared eyes. Neville had been there in the Hall of Mysteries, watching Sirius fall through the Veil. Neville had been there watching as Harry went out to die fighting Voldemort.
Beneath Padfoot Remus is sputtering, his hands instinctively shoving at the mist-damp mass of teeth and tangled fur pinning him to the floor, but then, one hand shielding his face as if from blows, he grips the dog by the scruff of the neck and holds him, his eyes focusing, and his whole face begins to tremble.
On the whole, though, Draco thought they were probably just stumbling through the mist together. Even as hopelessness congealed inside him, though, shapes began to appear in the mist ahead of them. There was something up ahead.
Sparks flew even underwater. It looked like a video Uncle Vernon had brought home once, something where they were supposed to admire the drills but all Harry had really noticed was the welder's flame, cutting a path through steel with fire.
, Draco translated in his head. Any number of things had been taken during the never-ending post-war searches of his home. Not that he was in any position to complain. “Sir?”
Malfoy let it linger there, hot against his own leg, then leaned forward, smirking. "Already with the mistakes."
The circle exploded. Theo laughed, Greg huffed out in disbelief, and Marcus threw his hands in the air.
Potter nodded and scrambled off the bed, digging through things under the bed and hopping back up with a little brass sneakoscope. Father would kill him—always use your own sneakoscope, someone else's could be tampered with—but he just didn't believe Potter would do that. Besides, he hadn't known Draco would ask for one and how likely was it that he had a doctored scope handy in his trunk?
Harry blinked. "What are you talking about? It was a lottery. Everyone stood an equal chance of losing."
"I told you, the dungeon's all dried out." The girl had to raise her voice to be heard all the way from the second landing down, where she'd heroically retreated. "So you don't need to be here anymore."
"Yeah. Right." Harry took Nev's cock in hand and tried stroking up and down as he sucked, teeth carefully tucked away. It was even easier this way. He didn't have to go so deep because his hand was there too, encircling Neville's cock and keeping the stimulation steady and unyielding.
Draco watched, as instructed. His father crawled across the floor, heading for the corner opposite the person on the mattress. Not a cell-mate, then? His father was pulling himself painfully upright now, for some reason determined to stand in the corner, back to the wall? His legs shook underneath him, skinny pale and sticking almost obscenely out from his ripped prison tunic.
Sirius blinked, startled. “I don’t—I think—yes. How did you know? He didn’t come back with me. I don’t know what happened to him.”
"We're not going to die, you berk." Harry tried to make that sound authoritative. It came out a little squeakier than he would have liked—the water was cold and it was starting to tickle his bollocks. Still, some of his panic had faded away. Malfoy was alive, Harry had gotten to him, no one had drowned yet, and there had to be a way out of this.
"You don't know how the BJ-giver was really picked." Ron patted Harry's leg. "You know it wasn't really random, mate. You've figured that much out, right?"
Draco hung back, uncertain. Potter might be enough of a sentimental bleeding-hearter to want to make things up to the people whose every belonging was now underwater but he couldn't possibly mean Draco as well.  The Gryffindors would probably rather hang him by the neck until he was dead than let him in their rooms and he wasn't sure he blamed them. Maybe he could find some deserted room, some unused cupboard somewhere and set up a bed in there?
“Before, when I said, er, you know. When you said you like blokes. I was... I was just surprised, that’s all.” He stuffed his hands in the pockets of his robes and looked as if he wished he could stuff all of himself in after them. “You’re still my best mate, yeah?”
Hell, he’d already been the Chosen One once. It had to be time for someone else’s number to come up. “I’m in,” he said, before the saner, more sensible part of his brain could stop him.
Harry nodded absently. "It's got a window-seat." Harry remembered that first night he'd spent at Hogwarts. Sitting in the window, looking out across the grounds, feeling happy for the first time in years. He turned and impulsively gave Hermione a little squeeze. "Thank you. I am sorry about all the work I've made for you, asking McGonagall to house the Slytherins here."
The hex caught Harry on the upper arm, a searing pain that streaked from his shoulder to his elbow. “Malfoy, what the fuck?” he yelled, while behind Draco, Nott sank to the floor, his head obscured by the swirling vortex of wasps and blood. Harry clutched his lashed arm and shouted louder, desperate to make Draco understand. “You don’t have to service Nott! You can get out of the contract! Fred and George told me--”
“Well, it was nice running into you again, Draco. Harvey and I actually have lunch plans with some friends – we have some catching up to do, don’t we, Harvey?” She gave Harvey a pointed glance before continuing. “Anyway, we’ll see you around?”
“Of course I have,” Draco said, which was actually a big fat lie, but he wasn’t about to admit it now. “And it was awful.”
Draco discovered, quite abruptly, that while he would undoubtedly run into Harvey again at some point, he didn’t want to leave their next meeting up to chance. On impulse, he added, “Since I’m new here, maybe you can show me around the neighbourhood some time.”
Draco found himself staring at Harry Potter with a sense of blank horror. It took him a second to regain his voice, and then the words were tripping their way out of his mouth. “What the hell is going on here, Potter? Why were you pretending to be Harvey? What have you done with him?”
“You still have time to get out,” Harry said, not meeting his eyes, and Draco was hit with the sudden, terrible realization that Harry thought he was doing this for him. He thought he was buying Draco time to escape.
“I’m not the one without scarves or boots. Honestly, how have you survived all these years?” Seeing that Harvey was opening his mouth again, Draco shook his head. “Just put them on. I insist. And the faster we get to the restaurant, the faster both of us can get out of the cold.”
"Of course," Seamus said. "This kind of thing happens all the time back home in Limerick. I know how to work it."
A host of objections flew into Harry's brain and he reached for one. "That's not fair! What if one of them just naturally comes quicker than the other? That's not about skill of the sucker. It's the bloke's fault."
Padfoot paddles his paws in the nothingness, frantically searching for the floor of the cabinet for anything he might touch or smell.
Anyway, he knew just where Zabini was. The bastard had Arithmancy with Hermione. Harry had seen the color-coded schedule on the wall enough times to know that's where they'd be right now. If he hurried, he could catch Zabini just as it let out.
Holding his breath, Draco tightened his grip on the cabinet door, then pulled it sharply toward himself, snatching his fingers in at the last moment so the latch could click shut.
Wherever exactly that was. Well, it wasn't like he didn't know where it was in general, he wasn't completely hopeless, but he couldn't see it. McLaggen's bollocks were big—of course—and they were blocking the view.
Ron flopped down on the unmade bed and then sat up again, wrinkling his nose. “Harry, mate. If you’re going to be, you know, doing your contractual obligations in here, you might brush up on your freshening charms.” Ron slipped his wand from the pocket of his pajama trousers and waved it over the bed. The scent of lemons and lavender filled the air, reminding Harry of the smell of the Burrow. He felt a sharp stab of guilt, made worse by the fact that Ron didn’t even seem angry with him.
"Yeah? Ask away." Harry wrapped an arm over Malfoy's leg. He noticed Malfoy hadn't pushed him off or made any move to get away. He was going to take that for a positive sign. "Anything."
“And… and tongue me. Under the head of my cock. Like, Oh. Oh fuck, Harry, yeah. Fuck, like that.” Harry had it now. Draco gripped his shoulders, telling him with his hands and with the long sound leaving his throat that it was so good like this, Harry using his tongue and hand together, his mouth so hot and soft and wet on Draco’s shaft. And then before Draco could say what he wanted next, Harry was doing it. He trailed the fingers of his other hand along the seam of Draco’s bollocks, back over his perineum and to the soft hair ringing his hole. He stroked there, light and feathery and perfect, his touch calling forth bright shivers of pleasure from every cell of Draco’s skin. And then Harry’s hand grew slick with a wandless
"The laundry?" Draco echoed, unsure whether he was being insulted in some new way. The Aurors' grins turned nasty. "You didn't think we'd be letting Lucius Malfoy back in his bleeding study," Pribbling said. "Not when it's most likely spelled to the ceiling with Dark Magic. We've put your dad in the laundry room, where he can't get into trouble. Now go on. We've got gates to guard."
"Thank you, Greg." Blaise added a new page to the chart, tallying votes. "I understood but clarity is always appreciated. Draco, I assume you vote for yourself?"
"That's enough, Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said crisply as she entered behind them. "I doubt your House is entirely blameless in this matter, whatever it is that occurred." She raised her hand and beckoned the rest of the Slytherins in.
“Magic contract, I said, right? We snitched one of the originals they really used and there’s a nasty little clause in there about non-compliance—“
Round and round the stairs until finally they spilled out into a round turret room, comfortably furnished with red-and-gold draped beds set around a little stove. Mullioned windows looked out over the grounds, opening to air instead of muddied water. How strange, to be up in the air instead of under the ground—Draco wondered if it scared them, like the lake had scared him the first time he set foot in a Slytherin dorm. Did they ever fear they might open a window when the night was as black as the one when Dumbledore fell and step out themselves, finding the air every bit as deadly as the water of the lake?
See, though, what did that mean? Thinking about Nev getting hard while rubbing off against Luna—that was rather brilliant. But if Harry was getting hard thinking about a bloke and a bird together, did that mean he liked birds? Or that he liked blokes?
Ever since the night of the contract, though, Ron had thawed a little. In an annoyingly superior way, like Harry was a stupid little brother he had to look out for. Reminding him to bring his broom to Quidditch practice. Telling him not to leave his things all over the floor. Checking to see if he really had all the required inches for his Charms paper. Annoying, inexplicable shite like that.
Harry loved him. Draco could feel it as surely as he felt the tip of Harry’s cock pressing into his arse. Draco gasped at the shock of it, the stretch and the fullness. It was almost too big, and it almost hurt, and yet there was room.
of exhaled breath when Harry touched him. The “l” made by a tongue-flick through opened lips. The “f” for fuck. The “o” the sound Malfoy made when he came, long and sweet and aching. And the “y” for yes. Yes to Harry. Yes to this. Remembering it, Harry’s hand was already stroking his morning erection. He and Malfoy had messed around twice more during the night, lying side by side and snogging while they brought each other off with their hands and it had been nothing short of spectacular. It was as if, ever since first year, he’d had an itch that he couldn’t quite reach to scratch, or a stone in his shoe that he’d never been able to shake out, and now he’d finally managed to attend to it.
Malfoy sighed like he did it professionally—long and weary and full of resignation. His chest rose and fell interestingly against Harry's as he breathed.  "Bubblehead charms only last an hour. Imbecile."
It was not a comfort now. As the staircase finally ended in a narrow, dank hall that only became yet another staircase, the air became ever more hot and humid, and the stairs themselves developed into increasingly curving spirals, twisting intestine-like. The steps beneath his feet were slick, his shoes slipping, threatening a long and painful fall. Still, he didn't want to touch the curving wall for balance-it glistened with moisture, pearly and faintly red.
Washing off the thin film of existential dread? Substituting the caress of water for the touch of a human hand? "Ron spilled jam on my pillow," Harry said instead. It wasn’t really a lie. It just hadn't happened tonight.
Harry entered a clearing and stopped. Malfoy was just in front of him, turning over the soil with a well-worn shovel. The early morning sun was dappling his hair, turning it an even brighter gold, and now that Harry was here the awkwardness had rushed back in. How could he say that he had hurried out here to find out if Malfoy liked cock every bit as much as Harry did?
“Which was a London hotel you’ve never been to, whose name you aren’t even sure of? Brilliant plan.”
Malfoy had completely stilled. His lower lip was caught between his teeth and his face had a tentative joy on it that made Harry's heart feel a little funny, in a good way. "You're not changing? You're staying this way, liking cock? Your whole life?"
Harry nodded and lay back down. He hadn't wanted Ron to stay, not really. It was just that a bed that had held two could feel suddenly overlarge when there was only one left in it. Too much empty white sheet, not enough warm flesh, even if it wasn't really Ron he wanted to fall asleep next to. "Got it. Kick 'em out as soon as you can."
On an impulse—probably a very bad, very stupid impulse that prioritized naked skin over naked truth—Draco leaned forward and took the chocolate between his teeth. He let his tongue swipe out and lick along Potter's fingers.
Greg's eyes flicked to Theo. Draco could almost see him think. Greg had always pashed on that cousin of Theo's, the one who went to Beauxbatons, but she wouldn't give him a drying charm in a downpour. Having some favors on the string could get his foot in the door. An invitation to a family dinner. A good word put in.
He swayed, took a few unsteady steps forward onto the garden's gravel path, and collapsed on his hands and knees, his head roaring and empty except for a single word.
Draco stood up with easy grace. He put his hand on Marcus's chest—fingers spread, almost a caress—and pushed him gently back into his seat. Draco waited a moment, just long enough for everyone to be reminded that he was worth looking at, then he sat again too. "Seven," he said clearly. "One per day, every day, each and every week, for every one of you."
The dog looked up at him, a low-pitched whine seemingly caught in its throat, as if pity and love were more than it felt it deserved. Draco gave him another encouraging pat, hoping that if nothing else in his entire useless life he was at least making this one dog a little happier with his company. "So show me everything? Which one do you like best?"
Dawlish’s wand,” Tonks said, ignoring Draco's babbling and reaching out to catch the Auror’s wand as it jumped neatly from his hand into hers. Only then did she turn to Draco, the sharp frankness of her gaze shutting him up as easily as a silencing spell. “I’m not arresting
George moved behind him, not pressed up against him, just close enough to run a hand through Harry's hair and down past his ear. "One by one, the wand picked the bloke who most hated the idea of sucking cock. One by one, it counted down to the bloke who most wanted to get on his knees for the rest of us."
"Thank you, Widley." Harry hesitated but really, what Hermione didn't know wouldn't hurt her. Anyway, the house elves really did love bringing people food. "I missed dinner. Is there any way I could get a little something sent up?"
A low, pained sound came from the shape in the corner. No, not just a shape: the moonlight now illuminated a man, face turned towards them. No one Draco recognized, but he seemed innocuous enough, as cellmates went, and if there was anything in the man’s mild brown eyes as he looked at Father, it was worry.
“But once I’m in, we’ll figure something out.” Harry took another step forward. “Besides,” he added, feeling a soppy grin steal over his face, “that was our first kiss.”
