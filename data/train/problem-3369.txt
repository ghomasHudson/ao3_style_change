By dawn, we were beginning to nod off and agreed that we should call it a night. Or, perhaps, a day. A morning. We didn’t really get into the semantics, honestly. There were tears to wipe away and hugs to he had and piles of scribbled notes to gather together. There were ideas taking root that can build only in dreams. And, in my case, there was a letter to finish.
Castiel was usually pretty quick with comprehension, but something about this statement in this moment in this sunny living room simply would not compute. “Your… what?”
Sam re-emerged when the Dads fired up the grill, and several cars pulled up soon after with Jess’s portion of the wedding party. The house was soon filled with excited chatter as introductions were made all around.
Dean’s response came out in a very small voice. “Hey, Cas.” He had not moved yet, still standing with his now empty hand held slightly out in front of him. He was clearly going to be no help in this state.
In December, when you sent me the phone, you must have gotten an idea of my irregularity in this area. At the time, I attributed my disquiet to the specific gift at hand; an item I deemed a luxury, coming from a relative stranger for no apparent reason. I ultimately allowed myself to be talked into accepting this gift when I was made to see that it is not so much a luxury as a modern necessity for a working professional. The unlimited data you paid for was rather excessive, but the phone itself is a tool of my trade, at least on the business side. It is, effectively, a horrifically expensive school supply, and through this lens I could justify it, understand why you wanted me to have it, and see its function toward my professional growth.
Well. With that all said, I suppose this really is my final letter to you. In case you’re waiting with baited breath to know the tale’s end, allow me to share some exposition from the denouement of my graduate year.
The fact of it is, you are my benefactor, nothing more. And while your request that a writer write to you does, to be frank, invite a certain intimacy, I rather doubt this was your true intention. You wished to be certain your money was being put to thorough use, and perhaps to be diverted by the occasional pun in the process. It was foolish of me to expect anything more personal from a person who can have no interest in knowing the child behind the words.
Sam let out a breath that he hadn't realized he'd been holding. "Great, thanks Cas," he said with a huff of relief.
It took a second for Dean to realize what he'd just said, and a flush turned the skin under his freckles pink.
Dean nodded, feeling heat rise all the way up to his ears. He knew if he opened his mouth he might start crying, and that wasn't cool.
Shaking out her limbs, which she hadn't realized had tensed up so much, Lizzy added as an aside, "You remind me of someone. This guy I met before the whole hunter thing happened. He was also kind of rude."
Around the time that Lizzy stood in the library, clutching a news article about that shooting in her shaking hands, is when she also learned that there was a name for what she was: a medium.
Lizzy processed that for a second, then squinted at the trio and said, "But if everyone knew that monsters are real, the cops and regular people
Cas, his angel. His best friend. His family. The family he chose to love, and who he always knew loved him back.
Dean's expression reminded Sam of another time, another pyre. But when Charlie had died, Dean had the Mark of Cain and a singular goal: Murder the entire Styne family.
"Here," Dean said, gently tossing Lizzy's crumpled purse onto her lap. "We found as much of your personal stuff as we could. Your wallet is there, which would be the most pain in the ass thing to replace. We couldn't find your phone, sorry."
Cas turned back to Dean and said, "Yes, Jack didn't just leave the Empty with me. He also bargained for Gabriel, Balthazar, Gadreel, and Anna."
Blood still dripped from the blade of Lizzy's machete from the two she'd managed to surprise. Unfortunately, the rest of the nest had gotten away, so she needed backup.
Cas' lips turned up at the corners, ever so slightly. "I believe the word you are looking for is 'smote.' She could have smote me without any weapon at all."
Dean didn't even realize he was crying until he felt the wet spot that he was leaving on Cas' white button-down.
Dean entered, clad in his hot dog pajama pants and his Dead Guy Robe, looking more chipper than he had any right to.
She'd explain everything to the Winchesters, in due time. She got the feeling that she probably shouldn't be solo-hunting, and that she might get an earful about it when they got there, but she couldn't just sit idly by when she knew the truth of things!
Dean pushed in, ever so slowly, because he couldn't stand the thought of hurting Cas again. He had a bad habit of hurting him in other ways, but he desperately wanted to be better. Not just for Cas, but for everyone he loved.
Dean shook his head, as if to shake off the very thought that this could be Kaia. "No," he said, voice already growing hoarse with emotion. "It can't be her."
Billie didn't dignify that with a response, she simply continued, looking up at the towering shelves of Dean Winchester's deaths. "You're dead now, of course, but this is not one of the ways it's supposed to happen. That's not too unusual for you Winchesters, and even Winchester-adjacent folks don't always die the way they're supposed to. Yet, here we are."
When Castiel looked up again, there was fury written all over his face. He started walking toward the building again.
Kissing Cas didn't disappoint. Dean had been thinking about it for at least a decade, but it was better than he ever could have imagined. Cas' lips were soft, and when he let out a small moan, Dean seized the opportunity to flick his tongue against the angel's. Somewhere, another innocent lightbulb exploded.
When it buzzed again for the third time, something definitely seemed off. He grabbed his phone from his coat pocket and looked at the caller I.D.
Dean leaned in and kissed the angel, long and deep. His hands ran up the back of Castiel's neck and tangled in his hair. Castiel's hands gripped Dean's hips tightly and pulled them even closer together.
Sam's expression melted into the soft look with the slightly furrowed brow that meant he was about to try and be the reasonable brother. "Dean, Plan B is death. There is no Plan C."
"Sam," Castiel said, relief evident in his voice. "It's me. I annoyed an ancient cosmic being until it dropped me back on Earth, so can I get a ride?"
, and rebel against heaven, he wouldn't have felt like he had to fix everything, save everyone from a God that doesn't care. But he learned that from me.
Lizzy and Claire stumbled out of the house covered in blood, but with the two young victims unbitten and secured.
Some time later, Dean emerged from the room with tears running down his face that he impatiently wiped away. He turned to his brother and just said, "It's done. I'm going to go dig his grave."
"We can't rely on that," Dean said, voice still rough from crying. "We need to have a Plan B and a Plan C."
Dean was possibly a bit delirious from blood loss, so it really wasn't his fault when he said, "Cas, I love your voice. Never thought I'd hear it again. You're hot."
"Hey Cas," Dean said, sounding absolutely wrecked, "Where are you? We...we lost a lot of people, man. We lost Eileen."
A few minutes later, Dean was at the table with his own cup of coffee, and Cas was right next to him, seemingly not wanting to stray far from Dean's side. The three of them sat in companionable silence until Eileen walked in with her hair still damp from the shower.
Green eyes narrowed at that, and Dean reached up to grab Cas' left shoulder, which he squeezed just a bit too tight. It was the same shoulder where Cas had once gripped Dean, so long ago, and raised him from perdition.
Dean removed his hand from the angel's cock and sat up, still straddling Cas' hips, to pull his flannel and t-shirt off and fling them somewhere.
She didn't hear Cas reply, but she suddenly felt strong hands on her upper arms and heard a flap of wings so loud that it was like an entire army of birds took flight at once.
"Yes, it's me," Castiel said again, his eyebrows drawing together in concern as he tried to fight down a tightening in his chest. Sam was acting very strangely, and that usually meant something terrible had happened.
Castiel didn't know how to respond to that, so he didn't say anything. Instead, he said, "I'm sorry I missed you yesterday, I got in pretty late."
That was when Castiel, former angel of the Lord, a thorn in the side of God himself, started openly weeping.
"Hey Cas!" he yelled to Trenchcoat Guy, "Can you go up to the car and grab the ghost supplies from the trunk?"
) Dean probably would have gone after the sonofabitch with his bare hands; and Sam's money would have been on Dean.
At some point, Sam had walked back into the barn, cleared his throat loudly, and announced that he'd like to hug his friend and then head home sometime this century. He even said Cas could ride shotgun. Dean was impressed, and made a mental note to give his brother some extra space the next time Eileen was visiting the bunker. As much as he enjoyed being a little shit and cockblocking Sam, he'd be cool from now on. Well, maybe not from now on. Maybe just for a week.
"Thank you all for coming," Sam began, addressing the room. Dean, Cas, and Eileen walked around handing out some instructions that Sam had typed up the first day after Cas had come home.
Jody's eyes moved to the box that was still sitting on the table. As Patience moved toward it, Jody removed her hand and yelled, "No, Patience, don't look in that! Just...go to your room and stay there, and call Sam and Dean!"
Castiel watched him, noting how Dean's face would go slack and look almost peaceful in sleep. It made him look younger, and Castiel wanted nothing more than for Dean to be able to wear that expression permanently. He deserved to live in a world that was safe from monsters like the ones who had killed so many people they loved.
"Actually, Cas," Sam said, sounding pained, "Dean isn't the reason I'm calling. I mean, yeah, he misses you and wishes you would come home, but something else has happened, and you need to know."
At that, Cas breathed sharply out of his nose in obvious annoyance. "I don't understand this human obsession with harps. None of us have harps."
Dean looked up and to the side, shrugging his shoulders a bit as he made a noncommittal sound in his throat.
Approaching the group again, Sam said, "Guys, I think we have an even worse problem than we thought."
Sam was silent for such a long time, that Castiel was afraid the call had dropped. But he could still hear the steady hum of the Impala in the background, so he waited.
Dean woke up in his own bed, disoriented and vaguely lightheaded. His first thought was that Cas wasn't with him. His second thought was the memory of what had transpired earlier.
Lizzy's head whipped up, surprised to find another person (well, human) loitering in the woods, outside of a ramshackle house full of werewolves.
He took himself in hand and leaned over Cas, capturing his lips in another heated kiss as he simultaneously guided himself to Cas' slick entrance.
Dean was getting close, and Cas was no longer forming words that Dean could understand, other than sometimes his own name. Cas' cock was caught between their bellies, and Dean was so tuned in that he could tell from the swell of the angel's cock, and his attempt to arch his back impossibly more off the bed, that Cas was going to come soon, too.
Dean glared at his brother, but they'd already wasted so much time batting this problem around, that Dean finally conceded.
Sam, Eileen, and Dean had all been sitting around looking for cases, but Dean had dozed off, so they'd just decided to make it a movie night instead. Cas brought in a bottle of beer for everyone, and Eileen said she was going to go make some popcorn.
Cas stood very close to Dean, but still kind of behind him, as he said, "We help people we don't know all the time."
Sam wasn't an idiot. He knew something had recently changed between Cas and Dean. His brother was an outstanding liar, but Sam knew him well enough to know something was up. He'd completely stopped hitting on waitresses, he got a constipated look on his face any time Cas so much as stubbed a toe, and he'd even started drinking less. A little less, anyway, until Cas had up and disappeared with Kelly.
Lifting one hand to cradle the back of Dean's head, Castiel deepened the kiss, causing Dean to moan in the back of his throat. With his other hand, Cas gripped Dean's hip and pulled their lower bodies together so that they were touching from lips to groin, and he couldn't help the small thrust he gave against the growing bulge in Dean's ratty jeans.
They turned to leave, but Lizzy yelled, "Wait! I sense ghosts constantly, like everywhere I go, so what if I need to contact you again?"
Dean swallowed thickly, shoved his despair so far down that he couldn't recognize it anymore, then continued.
Jack snapped his fingers and said, "I'll come collect you and give you back your grace when your time on Earth is done."
Without looking away from Patience's body, Dean said, "Then we say it was an accident with an angel blade. Or...or losing Alex was too much and made her go crazy, so she did this to herself."
Lizzy shook her head, then immediately regretted doing that when the vertigo set in. "Fuck," she said, closing her eyes tightly and putting a hand against her forehead.
Dean could tell that, at first, Sam couldn't see anything wrong. Which was frustrating as hell because it hurt like a motherfucker, and Dean was sure he must have at least
Dean squared his shoulders and replied a bit defensively,  "Well, maybe I'm just being more optimistic than usual."
Maybe it came across like a prayer, Dean didn't know for sure. But in the next moment, Cas closed the minor distance between them and pressed their lips together.
When Dean finally bottomed out, he stayed still to get a grip on himself. He was breathing heavily and was slick with sweat.
"Yeah," Dean jumped in, as he loaded shotgun shells with practiced ease, "Demons can sometimes be helpful, and angels are mostly dicks, except for Cas."
"Why is there a ghost here?!" he yelled, as if this were an unexpected but fairly common occurrence.
"You almost did," Dean said. "I can't even tell you how much that hurt, man. And I can't believe I almost bit it taking out a vampire nest. This was basically a milk run!"
"Okay, okay," Sam said, taking a step back. "We can fix this. Just stay with me and I'll call 911, and then grab the first aid kit, and then pray to Jack. Or maybe I should pray to Jack first..."
Dean turned to him with a strained expression. "You know why, Cas. Revenge and a death wish, all rolled into one."
It rang so many times that he feared he was about to go to Sam's voicemail, as well, but he finally heard a click and then Sam's gruff voice.
Jack brought everyone back, including the dog. Dean allowed himself a moment of joy upon seeing his new friend, Miracle.
"Anyway," Sam continued, "We hunt monsters and anything else that goes bump in the night. Your Uncle really needs to be put to rest before he becomes dangerous, so that's what the salt and matches are for. You said he was cremated, but do you carry around anything of his? Anything that he could possibly be attached to?"
He turned to look at Dean, who finally looked up from his precious caffeine and gave Cas a warm grin.
"Cas is dead. For real dead. Not-coming-back-this-time dead. I couldn't protect him, after everything he'd done for us. For me, personally. I couldn't even protect my own mom. Fucking
Cas sighed. "I don't know what water fowl have to do with this, Dean. I'm much more concerned about your safety. What if something happens to you and I'm not there to heal you?"
He did pause in front of what they now knew to be Kaia. He tenderly reached up and pulled the bolts from her hands, letting her weight fall onto him as he freed her from the rest. Then he pulled her the rest of the way down, and laid her gently on the ground.
Dean looked up at Castiel in a daze. “I took your advice and called him this morning. I left a voicemail.”
Where to start? Well, I left you with very little to go on regarding my final project when I wrote last month, so I suppose I should take pity on you in that regard. Here’s what happened: I, Castiel Novak, writer of strange and snarky short stories, seem to have find my way into entirely new territory.
We’re all looking at our work though this sort of lens at the moment: what is there, what is not, and what could happen if we tried something utterly terrifying? It’s heavy stuff, honestly. At least right now, while it’s happening. A bit like breaking down an okay-looking building to build the home of your dreams, I suppose— you have to be willing to give up on “fine” to create even the foundation of “wonderful”, and with something as personal as one’s art on the line, it can be a paralyzing prospect. But it’s what our professors have all done, and the fruits of that work, of truly knowing themselves, shine through clearly in their bodies of work. I’m ready to take that leap, newly freed to the world as I am, and I hope you will be proud of the results, whatever they might be. You have, after all, made them possible.
“Sure,” Cas assured him. “Your secret is safe with me, Dean. But you might want to come up with a new cover story about Lisa’s absence, just in case she shared her more morbid familial traumas with anyone else.”
I understood this, objectively, from the moment I received Ellen’s invitation. But I don’t think anything could have prepared me for the reality of it. Every single member of the Roadhouse family welcomed me back with honest, sincere appreciation. Every one of them— including Ash, who rarely seems to exist fully on this plane of reality— specifically told me at some point in those first two days that they were glad I was back among them. They remembered things about my life and were actively interested in the progress of those things. They wanted to know about my work and my plans, and when I confessed to being published, Jo immediately found my story online so she and Ash could perform a dramatic reading of it for the entire bar. (That part started out rather embarrassing, but Ash’s delivery of Gabriel’s more questionable commentary was so inspired that I forgot my nerves in tears of laughter.) They so wholly and unblinkingly pulled me back into their world, and it left me, frankly, stunned.
I believe I shared a bit about Dean with you in my last letter. (Oh, who are we kidding? I’m fairly certain I gushed about him for several pages in my last letter.) Well, I’m about to do it again, so brace yourself, Archangel.
Handing the tablet off to the kid, Dean jogs down to the curb, apparently determined to chat with Castiel from across the street. “Whatcha up to?”
Dean looked uncomfortable, and Cas could feel dread rising in his throat like tears. Wrong call, an alarm blared in his head. He had to get away, so he made to stand up, trying to sound casual and no doubt missing by miles. “Well, I—”
Cas smiled reassuringly and resumed his seat across from Dean. “Only when you add together the uncharacteristic silence with the traumatic breakup and the trunk full of suitcases.”
It’s nearly 8:00 on a Thursday night when the doorbell rings. And thank goodness Gabe isn’t here trying to sleep, because he would be livid. Castiel can just imagine the shouts of “who rings doorbells these days?!” that would flow from his brother’s mouth as he stomped across the house to the front door.
Dean looked over at him, eyes still filled with mirth, from his own bed, and admitted, “I missed you.”
Miraculously, Dean doesn’t respond to this at all, except to take a big bite of his burger and start the movie back up. Very uncertain, Cas decides to write all of this off rather than thinking about it too hard. Perhaps Dean is just secure in his heterosexuality in such a way that he doesn’t mind a child implying he has a crush on a very masculine character. That is the only possibility Cas will entertain right now because he is not supposed to be thinking about it too hard.
First, I dispensed with my generic male protagonist entirely, and revisited something from my past. In this iteration, it would be my futuristic collective of lesbian ghost hunters encountering the Ghost Dragon. The same group from the short story that inspired your sponsorship of me in the first place! It was quite fun to revisit them, actually. Enough so that I’m considering doing so again in the future. I’m not sure this exact new story could stand up on its own, but perhaps it will morph into something bigger down the line. Kevin has suggested it would fit as a comic book series or graphic novel. I don’t know that I’m ready for that, but it’s an interesting suggestion, at any rate.
Cas gave his best attempt at a haunted look. “Let’s just say my car stereo was painfully tuned in to my crush on you during the drive here.”
Let me explain. I’m not sure what you’ve learned about me from Dr. Visyak, but my upbringing was not what you’d call “overly pleasant”. I was an orphan, taken in somewhat grudgingly by a strictly pious farmer. When he promptly died, I was left in the care of his rather severe wife, who regularly assured me that she only kept me around to impress the other women at church with her generosity. Eventually, she also came to appreciate the government’s own generosity as regarded her status as foster mother, and she expanded her horizons to take in other children. I became useful, then, as I could be enlisted to look after the younger children. The ones she had chosen.
He still wasn’t sure about this. Now that he was here, it was starting to feel a bit too far on the creepy end of the spectrum, to have showed up, uninvited, at an address to which he has never been invited. But he hadn’t been able to help himself.
It started with Krissy and I. Krissy specializes in young adult fiction—I don’t know if I’ve told you that before—and she has been working on a piece of late that might benefit from some elements of a strong family dynamic among the leading characters. As in, an actual blood-tied family unit with all its highs and lows, rather than something found or built. She and I were both working in the lounge/living room, so I offered to help her at least talk through her frustration.
All eyes were on him. He had no logical reason to object, as far as he could tell. At least, no reason he was willing to share with the class. There was nothing for it but to say, “Sure.”
But Dean cut him off, voice quiet and gaze back on the distant water. “Do you remember the summer when my dad rented that little two-man sailboat?”
“If we’re being technical, I believe the actual subject was how I spent most of high school simultaneously wanting to date you and be you.”
“Come on, Addy, leave the poor man alone. He’ll get enough of your questions once the party actually starts, I’m sure.”
There was a suspended beat as soon as Cas finished speaking, a tiny shift in the air as the tone of the conversation stood on a precipice. Dean leaned back so he could see Cas’s face, and just started for a moment. Then they both burst out laughing.
“Bobby will just give me that silent death stare of his for a few weeks, and then he’ll probably get over it.”
Choosing to let this strange fact pass for the moment, Castiel bowed to his curiosity. “And the others? What do they mean?”
While the Millicent Greenwaldt Memorial Scholarship must come to an end upon your completion of The Garden’s program, Mr. Smith’s support does not, necessarily, need to cease in turn. He sees potential in your work, and should you wish to continue on after graduation in a similar manner, Mr. Smith would be interested in sponsoring your work further. Should you agree, he would be happy to offer a very generous stipend, which should allow you to live comfortably and without need for a secondary vocation as you begin your time as a professional writer. The monthly correspondence would no longer be required, though occasional contact would be appreciated so that Mr. Smith could continue to follow your work.
It does occur to Castiel, now and again, that the mad dashes to the kitchen make very little sense unless Dean spends his days and nights standing on the aforementioned lawn to stare into the neighbor’s house.
“Yeah, I know that,” Dean assured him. “Objectively, at least. I keep running those kinds of thoughts through my head like a mantra, and it helps. But then another damn relative walks up and gives me that same wink, like they expect me to be happily married to my college sweetheart by the fall, just like Sam, and I spiral down all over again.”
Ellen recovered herself first. “Fine, but it is June, son. You couldn’t have mentioned this at any point in the last couple months?”
Down on the bottom floor of the individual student rooms in the North Wing (I was not exaggerating: this place is enormous) we have Garth and Kevin. If this were a late-1990s teen comedy, they would be introduced as “the nerds”. (Though let’s face it: everyone living at the Garden right now is a massive nerd of some flavor or another.) Garth is of the unapologetically perky variety, and Kevin, so far, appears to just be wound tighter than a rubber band ball. Let’s hope we can help him untangle a bit this year.
Well, wasn’t this intriguing? “There was nothing to ‘interrupt’, Dean. Not in the way you imply. Balthazar and I are friends.”
The atmosphere back at the house was giddy as Patience and Kaia shuffled them all through a variety of groupings and poses. They were relaxed, but professional, Kaia’s dry humor keeping her charges from spiraling into annoyance while Patience’s kind words drew more sincere expressions of joy than Cas would have expected in such a still, static session. They captured action shots of Sam and Jess signing their marriage certificate, along with a number of images of the wedding party on the nearby beach in varying states of decorum and hilarity. At Charlie’s suggestion, they even set up a highly entertaining series of images with the Winchester-Singer-Harvelle-Novak clan and their various adopted members posing on the wide front porch like the sort of melodramatic Victorian family portrait you might see on the set of a horror film, all straight faces and haughty expressions. They welcomed the Moores up for some of these last silly photos as well, and the whole thing devolved into giggles pretty quickly. Cas couldn’t wait to see them developed in black and white. He was certain any one of them would look spectacular framed above the lake house mantel, a perfect testament to the love and humor that had radiated through this property since the first time they all arrived.
Bella nodded. “Yeah. I stopped hanging around with them, and they didn’t like it. You know, they actually followed me here, to this con, but I haven’t seen them for a while, so maybe they finally figured out that I didn’t want anything to do with them.”
After “Closer to Fine” wrapped up, Ellie and her husband Trevor stood to say their goodbyes and take Addy home. Cas handed the guitar over to Dean, the true musician of the group, to lead them all in various requests and past favorites.
“True, true,” was Dean’s vague response. He looked a bit lost again, nodding absently, so Cas took pity on him.
Cas could see the wheels turning in Mary’s head, and jumped in with a little logic of his own. “The unbelievable speed with which you two planned this lovely wedding in an admirably-brief four months didn’t leave a lot of time to break bad news without the disappointment spilling over into today. “
As we’ve established, I’m completely fucking in love with my boyfriend. It’s all gross and mushy and feelings. I love it. I love when he’s been up all night working and glares up from the pillow when I kiss him goodbye in the morning. I love when he eviscerates bad movies with his commentary, and the adorable little furrow he gets in his brow when I say something incredibly dumb just for the hell of it. And— no joke— more than anything I just fucking love doing nothing with him. I mean, I love doing things with him too, don’t get me wrong. Sexy things
He was doing everything in his power to remain calm so that Patience could focus. She was sat quietly at the map table, which Charlie had been able to rig to show the progress of their color-coded teams. A satellite phone lay next to her, silent.
"I'm fine," Claire said with a reassuring smile. "I'm just tired from the fight. You take the kids out to the main road, or wherever you're parked, and make sure they get home."
Castiel sighed, "Yes, I am aware. I'm sorry, I hope he knows that I would be there by his side if I could."
After a few minutes of that, Dean guided Cas' right leg up onto his own shoulder, and bent his left leg over his hip. This gave Dean the opportunity to bend Cas more at the waist, delving even deeper inside the angel, and put Dean in the perfect position to also be able to lean down and press his lips to Cas' and steal some of the little "ah" noises escaping Cas' mouth with each thrust.
"We've made them pay," Cas was saying, "We've killed all of those evil sons-of-bitches, and I'm going to find every other nest in this state, and I'm going to kill them too."
Dean had known that he wanted this, of course. He'd known he wanted Cas, like biblically, for a while now.
Dean would have loved to kick the shit out of the new mortal version, but they'd all agreed to leave him where he was and make him figure it out.
Patience gasped and tensed again, staring off into the distance at something that no one else could see.
Once he was within reach, the angel touched Dean's face, said something under his breath, and then Dean wasn't in pain anymore.
In her rearview mirror, she counted four wolves coming up from behind her truck, which meant that there were at least two more hiding somewhere.
Cas raised a shaking hand to the dots as they slowly got closer to the bunker. Just a little more, and everyone left would be back safe.
Frozen, sitting on the cold concrete floor with his back against an equally cold brick wall, Dean started shaking. He wasn't shaking due to the physical cold of the dungeon slipping through the barrier of his jacket and into his bones. No, this was a chill that seeped into his very soul.
With that, Dean started to move, setting a comfortable pace that got Cas squirming around underneath him. Dean found that pretty delightful.
With tears blurring his vision, Dean tried to look over Sam's shoulder without dislodging his grieving brother.
Sam nodded, then turned to Lizzy and started speaking to her in a soft voice, like she was a spooked animal or something. "You know that ghosts are real, but so are a lot of other things. Vampires, werewolves, demons, angels...but they aren't usually what myths and legends make them out to be."
Sam had clearly broken the news about Kaia, since Jody was in his arms basically wailing, and Donna was on a small love seat holding both Alex and Patience against her, as if she could protect them from all of this.
Castiel could see that he was completely losing Dean, so he finally stood and walked as close as he dared.
Dean raised his head to look at Cas, and saw an expression that he, himself, had once worn. He loosened his grip on Cas' trenchcoat and moved to place them on either side of the angel's face.
As he was pulling on his tie, Dean surprised Cas by taking his hand and saying, "Hey, we should probably talk more about this..."
When Jody got home, Patience called from her room, "There's a package for you on the kitchen table!"
When she was 15, she sensed that a murder had happened in a building that she'd never been in before, because she felt the fear and panic of the victims, and the anger of the killer. She only ever told the friend who was with her at the time, and a few years later she came to learn that a shooting had taken place there, ten years prior, when a fired employee came back for revenge.
When Dean appeared in the doorway, Castiel saw the moment that Dean realized what had happened. It was a gasp, a hand flying to cover his mouth, and a single step back away from the scene.
More crashing and twigs breaking, and then suddenly she was looking upside-down at three white dudes. Two were wearing torn up jeans and flannel, and one was wearing a suit and a fucking trenchcoat. They all had on way too many layers for a muggy summer night, in her opinion.
Castiel studied the map table, hyper-focused on the four green blips that represented Dean, Sam, Eileen, and Alex.
He knew his brother better than anyone, so he knew who Dean would blame. There was no where else for his fury to go. If Jack hadn't already proven to be basically indestructible, he'd be in grave danger.
Sam looked at his brother blearily and opened his mouth to comment, but shut it again when Cas followed after Dean, like a trenchcoated shadow.
Dean grinned a bit when he felt Cas' erection against his hip, but he didn't grind down harder to give the angel any relief. Instead, he breached Cas' lips with his tongue and deepened the ongoing kiss until it was filthy, and Cas seemed to lose all control of his body from the waist down.
Dean gaped at him before saying, "It was more than adequate. Where the hell did you learn to do that?"
As the door closed and locked behind them, and Cas began unbuckling his belt, Dean thought that as long as they still had this, as long as they were still
"You're not making any sense!" Dean spat out, angry now. "I watched Cas get an angel blade straight through his heart! I saw his grace explode out of his head! His wings were burned into the ground!"
Castiel's heart felt like it was in his throat. He could still remember when he didn't need a heart, but it was abstract, hazy.
Claire laughed easily, which was strange because she didn't seem like a laughing-with-a-stranger kind of person, but what the hell did Lizzy know?
When Sam and Jack found them the next morning, Dean was asleep with his head on Cas' shoulder, and the angel had his arm around Dean's waist.
Cas nodded. "Yes, Jack wanted my help redesigning heaven to be what it always should have been - a place of peace when life is done, but with no walls. Everyone can be reunited, everyone can find each other. That's why I didn't come back to Earth sooner. I'm sorry."
Dean's eyes widened in surprise at finding himself on his back, but Cas was already pulling off his underwear, so he figured he could deal with it.
Squinting a bit at the woman, Lizzy motioned to her gun holster, the gun in her hand, the machete sheathed at her side, and the silver dagger in her boot.
"Cas," he said, quietly, "I need you to know that it's not only Dean who hates this. You're my best friend, and if we can figure out how to remove the Mark someday, you'd better believe we're coming back for you."
"Well," said Sammy, since Dean was still concentrating, "If a ghost hangs out in the veil too long, it can go crazy. When your Uncle died, he must have ditched his reaper or something. How long ago did he die?"
When the angel seemed like he'd never move again, Sam took him gently by the arm and led him to the passenger side of the car. Castiel made no protest as Sam sat him down in the seat and closed the door. He walked around the car and slid into the driver's seat.
Sam narrowed his eyes at his brother. Then he turned to look at Cas, who was looking absolutely anywhere else that didn't include a Winchester.
"Fuck you!" Dean shouted as best he could through the tears. His face was blotchy and red, but it brought out the green in his eyes, and Castiel thought that Dean had never been more beautiful than he was in this moment. "You bastard! It was supposed to be over! Chuck's gone, and we talked about
Castiel just continued to stare at Sam until the hunter let out another small laugh and started the car.  "Come on, time for you to meet your kid."
Sam had tried to be optimistic. Cas was his friend too, but he knew that Dean needed him to be strong in the wake of this loss. Sam thought that if he could just stay positive and convince Dean that Cas could come back, and their mom could come back, and that maybe they could fix this like they always do...he'd start to believe it, too.
Cas always looked at Dean in a way that Dean knew he didn't deserve. A man like him shouldn't be anything to an angel. Cas made mistakes, sure, but his heart was always in the right place. More importantly, he was powerful and ancient, and Dean should have been about as important as an ant to a being like Cas.
Jack's smile literally glowed (must be a God thing) and Castiel's eyes were glassy with relief when he looked at Dean.
Sam was silent, but Castiel saw the wetness glistening in his eyes, and he knew. Hell, he had already known, since the stilted conversation with Sam on the phone. He just didn't want to believe it.
She quirked an eyebrow at him, and Dean chuckled, "Saving the world means breaking the law sometimes. But the number is real. I'm Dean Winchester, that tall one is my brother Sam, and the handsome angel is Castiel."
A long table, at least long enough for Jody, Donna, and all the girls to eat together, was set up in the center. On that table lay a small human-sized lump, covered with a white cloth.
Suddenly, Cas was back and Lizzy hadn't even heard him walk down from the road. Just like before, he wasn't there and then he was.
Then Cas' mouth was on Dean's cock, taking him nearly all the way down, and this wasn't what Dean had thought Cas meant by touching, but he was
The call ended, and Castiel dropped his phone onto the cold concrete. He wouldn't need it where he was going.
Dean's face was worth a thousand words. His eyes were red-rimmed from crying, but beyond that was the expression he wore when he needed to be pointed at something to kill. Sam's stomach dropped. Silent fury rolled off Dean in waves, and that was a very dangerous thing. If Lucifer wasn't already dead (
Dean prepared Cas for his funeral, while Sam took care of Kelly. Sam had started to ask Dean if he wanted to switch, so that Dean wouldn't have to see Cas' body again, but before he could even open his mouth, Dean had looked at him with an expression of such broken rage and sorrow that Sam knew his brother had to be the one to do it. Dean wanted to be the one to touch Cas' empty vessel gently, to wrap him up in sheets and curtains and whatever else was at hand, and he needed to be the one to carry him to the pyre.
Castiel tried to keep his voice steady as he said, "I can't do that, Dean. I did do this. I didn't mean to, but it happened anyway."
"So, yeah," he said with an intensity that went beyond anything Billie had seen from him, in all the time they'd known each other. "That's what's changed. I'm tired of choosing life. I'm tired of cosmic beings interfering. I'm tired of all of it. I've missed so many people for so long, I don't even remember how not to miss them. With me gone, Sammy can move on and maybe go back to school. He was never as close with mom as I was, so he'll eventually be able to move on from that, too. I'm not a complete idiot, I know he'll grieve. But with time, maybe he can finally have that safe, happy, apple pie life."
"Team Green!" He said, his voice even gruffer than usual, using every bit of will power he possessed to stay in the bunker and not go kill the things that killed Alex. "Get out of there! Alex is down! I repeat
They buried the Ma'lak box the next day, deep in the woods outside the bunker. Dean knelt down and talked to Cas through it until the sun started to set.
Like, he was there one second, and in the next second there was an empty space where a not-insignificant amount of dude had been.
Jody swallowed thickly, then said, "Yes. Yeah. Just...I'm so sorry for making you look. I can't do it again, and I can't let the girls see it. I'm thanking my lucky stars that Patience hasn't had a vision of it yet."
"Dean!" Castiel said, an edge of anger in his voice. "Don't you ever say that! Don't do that! I'm not worth..."
Castiel took a few deep breaths to steady himself, then finally relaxed and stepped back next to Dean.
In front of them was a rusted industrial garage door, and something human-shaped was attached to it by what looked like huge bolts through the body's hands, which were raised above their lolling head. There were also bolts in their shoulders and thighs. Blood poured from the body, but they couldn't see from where. It flowed down from the back of the body, down the door, and onto the asphalt where they stood.
Dean lifted his head and said, "Okay. This is happening. I've got this. Do you want me to prep you, or can you mojo it? Fair warning: I'm not super experienced with prepping someone else."
"So do I," Dean said, stilling long enough to press a kiss to the side of Cas' head, "But it has to be done, and we're the only ones who can do it. You know that. The civilians out there are sitting ducks without us."
That had almost made Dean lose his own lunch (which had been nothing but five fingers of whisky, but still) because he knew about Charlie's heartbreak back in the Apocalypse World. Now, a love ending before even getting a chance to start? There might not be any coming back from that.
"I want everything," he said. "But for right now, what I want most of all is to feel you inside me."
got killed on my watch. I've had friends that I couldn't even burn, because there wasn't enough of them left for a pyre. And now I've had to burn my...Cas."
Castiel swallowed around his own tears and said, "I know, Dean. I wanted forever with you. But maybe I'm cursed, maybe I was never going to get a happy ending. Maybe I rebelled too many times. Naomi once said that I was defective. That I 'came off the line with a crack in my chassis,' and maybe she was right."
Whether it was the silly pet name, or just the simple demand, Dean didn't know. What he did know was that Cas' eyes flashed the bright silver-blue of his grace, and he made a keening sound that was reminiscent of his true voice as he came between their bodies.
Cas' cock was hard and hot against Dean, so Dean made sure they lined up as he pushed his weight down, which elicited a strangled sound from the angel.
Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Eileen had all gone to Brookings together. After they took out the nest, they were going to reconvene at Jody's for Claire's funeral. Jody was beside herself, so they'd been able to convince her to stay home with her other girls. They'd heard that Alex was a mess, too. They needed to be together right now.
Castiel's intake of breath at that was audible. Yet, he hated himself just a bit more due to his secondary thought, the thought that rang out over the initial grief, which was
realize that I feel the same way about you? When I found out you were dead, if it wasn't for Jack, I never would have come back here. I would have been around, for Sam and for Jack, but I would never be able to walk through this bunker again. Because this place is your home, and it made you so happy to finally have a home again. Every inch of this place would be haunted by my memories of you, far worse than any ghost we've ever faced. I suppose I could have gone to see you in heaven, if they ever let me in again, but it wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be what you deserve."
"So where does that leave us?" Dean asked. His eyes flicked down to Castiel's lips, then back up to his eyes so quickly that he wasn't completely aware that he'd done it.
Patience collapsed, sobbing with her face in her hands. Castiel knew enough about humans to know that she wouldn't be okay any time soon.
"Whoa whoa whoa!" Lizzy interjected, taking a step back from the men and putting her hands up in defense, "Why does anyone need a shotgun or matches right now?!"
If there was one thing that Castiel knew in all the universe, it was Dean Winchester. And Cas knew from his tone of voice that Dean wasn't actually doing much better than Patience at the moment.
He had used his own blood to paint a rudimentary sigil on the door that bound him to the room. There would be no way for him to get out and hurt anyone else.
"You were gone," Sam said, quietly. It would have, perhaps, sounded accusatory coming from anyone else, but Sam sounded like he was simply reciting a well known fact. "We saw you die, and we had no idea how to bring you back. We didn't even think it was possible. And then with Jack and everything...there wasn't enough time."
"Cas," Dean said, "You can't do that. That much killing...you'll lose it. I know you will. I've been there. Promise me you won't."
As they watched the flames and said some words (there weren't nearly enough words) Sam looked over at his brother.
He put his head in his hands as the cold touch of loss, worse than anything Billie could have done to him, overcame him.
Sam watched him go, and knew deep down that his brother had been irrevocably damaged. He didn't look like the same man who always said he wanted to "go out swinging." He looked like a broken man who had given up.
Dean made his way quietly from the garage into the main area of the bunker, but paused just outside the library when he heard several raised voices.
Castiel held Dean's gaze as he said, "What difference would it make? We had to put Wally on a pyre tonight. Mary had to call his wife. There are always casualties."
Sam finally opened the door, the creak of the hinges familiar in a situation which was steadily barreling toward wrongness.
Jack's expression became more mischievous as he said, "You're irreverent and kind of an asshole sometimes. Is that better?"
"I understand that," Billie said, "But I also know that he's alive. To be fair, he really was dead until a few hours ago. There's no way you could have known. That means The Empty either really liked him, or really hated him. And from what I know of The Empty, and what I know of Castiel, it was probably the latter."
"What's really interesting," Billie went on, "Is that amidst all of these variables, not a single one of these books says you die today."
in that trunk, not to mention other monsters (or parts of monsters) so he was adamant that there was no way it was happening.
"He killed himself with some meds, so that he could ask the ghosts where the doctor's body was, and where their bodies were. I just had to give him three minutes and then revive him. I timed it perfectly, Cas. At exactly three minutes I gave him the adrenaline, but it didn't work. So I started CPR. But that didn't work, either."
Castiel didn't re-join them. He reached down to grab the door's handle and lift it open. The metal screeched, announcing their arrival.
"Maybe I hit my head harder than I thought," Lizzy mumbled to herself. Then her brain caught up and she said, louder, "Wait, what ghost supplies?"
"Dean," he said again, his favorite word in all of the languages in all of Creation, "I don't even trust myself to hold you right now. What if I did this to you? I can't control it anymore. I'm so sorry, I know I'm letting you down, but the others have to know about Patience, and I have to be held accountable. I can't die while I have the Mark, so you know the plan. It's time."
Sam was slumped at the table in the kitchen, a huge mug of coffee in front of him, not looking at all like the man who used to get up at 6am to run a mile in the woods surrounding the bunker.
Dean tried to grab his shoulder, but missed by a few centimeters. "Cas!" he whisper-yelled, but Castiel didn't stop.
There was a screened-in porch off the back of Jody's house, and Dean followed the sound of sobs and wails to that area.
"I know," he said, finally releasing the angel's face and taking a step back. "But we'll cross that bridge when we get there."
What little color that had remained in his face after the ordeals of the day drained completely away, leaving him ashen.
Sam gave them a guilty shrug, but carried on. "Desperate times," he said. "I made them aware of the situation, but despite the fact that the monster threat will definitely outgrow the U.S. and spread across the world, they weren't interested in helping us."
Dean saw him lean down and whisper something to the dead girl, and that was too much. Dean closed his eyes and turned away, unable to reconcile the limp body on the ground with the girl he knew.
Dean collapsed onto Castiel's chest, pushing his overheated face into the crook of Cas' neck. "You can't just say shit like that, man," he grumbled into the angel's shoulder.
Within the hour, Castiel was buried in the ground, more than six feet under, and it was so dark that it reminded him of the Empty, which made him start to panic, but his spiral was interrupted by an incredibly direct prayer:
"I don't exactly need seven archangels since that was something Chuck made up on a whim, but I wanted to include those who meant well in life and deserved better than they got. I'll ask Sam closer to his time. As for you, Dean, I need someone who will be completely honest with me, even if it's hard. Castiel is too protective, and the others don't really know me yet."
"About that," Billie said, "I know you've done that little trick before. It's here in one of your books. There are so very many ways for you to die, and they appear in writing whether the death sticks or not. So tell me, you've fought so hard and for so long, what's changed?"
Claire made a flippant gesture with her hand and said, "I can take care of myself. They're the priority. Get them back to their parents."
"Okay," Dean said, more to himself than to Cas. "That's something we're doing now. That's good. Totally fine."
"Dean," he said, and Lizzy thought it was weird that in the very short time she'd been around these people, Cas seemed to always defer to Dean. "I have the salt and matches, and I brought the shotgun and rock salt ammunition."
Donna sighed and closed her eyes. This had been a stupid idea. Why would Jody want to go on a hunt, so soon after losing Claire and Kaia?
"We need him to get rid of Michael, and then we need to do whatever it takes to get Jack close to him," Sam whispered under the cover of darkness, deep down in the warded dungeon where Cas had died.
Dean and Cas walked silently to their room, where Dean shed his clothes and left them on the floor because he was too emotionally drained to do anything else. He climbed into bed in just his boxers, and fell asleep before his head even hit the pillow.
"It was just supposed to be a small nest," she went on, as if Sam hadn't spoken. "Three vamps, tops. Claire and I went in armed to the teeth, but there were so. many. more."
Castiel nodded. He heard what Sam was saying, but he didn't think he was fully processing it. He felt numb. He felt more empty than The Empty.
"Cas," Sam said, his voice barely audible as he stared blankly through the windshield, out into the blankness of a back alley at night. "He did it to himself. There was a house full of victims. The ghost of some quack doctor was possessing and murdering people, and they were all stuck there. Tons of people. Some of them were kids."
Dean just watched the angel for a while, and Cas watched him right back. Of course he did, because this was the part where Cas deferred to Dean. He let Dean make the decisions. He let Dean make the first move. No matter how much Dean screwed up, Cas' trust bordered on blind devotion.
Dean placed a soft kiss to Cas' hair, and then gently flipped them again. Now hovering over Cas, Dean said, "I need to know what you want. We could keep using our mouths and hands, and that would be totally fine with me, but if there's anything else you want, you need to let me know."
Once Claire stopped talking and looked to Lizzy for confirmation, Lizzy knew that her mouth was hanging open and that she probably looked like an idiot.
Dean leaned down to bite at Cas' shoulder, enjoying the aborted little "ah" sounds he was making. In fact, he was enjoying them so much, he captured Cas' mouth again so he could steal those noises from him.
It really wasn't his fault that Cas looked so sincere, so full of love, that Dean wanted to explode with it.
to know the one thing we needed to know to break that spell and cure you, I'd be burning you on a pyre right now. And I can't, man. I just can't."
Jody was sobbing on Bobby's shoulder about Alex and Krissy. Jody had only known Krissy for a day, but she'd told Dean that she felt like it was on her to be a mother figure to all of the wayward girls she met. Krissy was no different. And Alex, being taken out by vamps? Jody had emptied her stomach until there was nothing but bile, and she hadn't stopped crying since learning the news.
"He's a good kid. He's...confused. I've done the best that I can with him so far, but after you died, Dean was...hard on him."
"As you all know by now, the number of monsters is increasing exponentially. But that's not even the worst news. They've declared open season on hunters, and have already taken out some of our family."
Alex sighed. "Thanks Donna, we're okay. Just taking it one day at a time. Jody hasn't come out of her room much."
"Please, Cas, be reasonable. Different people do different kinds of good. You're staying with Patience because her powers are an insurance policy for all of us. You know she's not a fighter, and the bunker has already been made by Michael's monsters. You think everyone with that knowledge just forgot? If anyone tries to get in here and hurt her, they won't be able to because you're going to stop them. You're going to protect
He walked toward the one that Dean and Cas had just used, but was stopped by Dean launching himself onto it first.
"Well," Dean said, trying to ease some of the tension from his own shoulders, "I figure with you at the wheel, there's no going back for me this time anyway."
Sam shot him a look that clearly said that he knew Dean was full of shit (which he was) but was choosing not to press the issue.
Dean clutched at the angel's dark hair, and Cas moaned around his cock, sending shockwaves through Dean.
Claire didn't reply, so Lizzy took the kids by their hands and said, "Come on, your parents have been looking for you."
"Yes," she said. "My brothers. My actual brothers, that I grew up with in my family. I'd be happy to see them."
He was complicit in that, and now she was dead and he couldn't even apologize. She was dead, and Kaia was dead, and Jody's house was filled with a bunch of broken people who did have something good, once, before meeting a vamp or an angel or a Winchester.
Early Wednesday afternoon, one Dean Winchester arrived in Boyne Falls, along with his best friend Charlie Bradbury. Contrary to what you might assume based on that name, Charlie is a small, red-haired firecracker of the female persuasion who simultaneously works as a techie at the same company as Dean, and runs the Internet like a hacker Robin Hood. She is also a queen at some sort of Medieval roll play activity that sounds like adult dress up. Apparently, this activity occasionally involves Dean wearing tights, which is an image I might never get out of my head. (No complaints! Though, that can be a challenging dichotomy when the object of such images is someone you are trying to be friends with.)
Now, I’m not some sort of cave person – I know how to work a computer. I am a child of the Internet Age, after all. I grew up working with word processors just as earnestly as I write by hand to you now, and I’ve become quite skilled in the art of internet research as writing has slowly drawn my focus. We did have things like computers and televisions at Angel Farm, even if Naomi wasn’t overly fond of the “idle behavior” they occasionally inspired in her charges. But through all the technological education of my formative years, I never interacted with a cellular phone of quite this breed. Why would I need to? I didn’t exactly attract bosom friends, especially as an odd young farm kid. Who could possibly need to get a hold of me? I went to school and I went home, both of which were reachable by landline. And if something happened to make me miss the school bus, I knew how to walk back to the farm from the town center, so I suppose Naomi never saw any reason to bother with the expense to get me a “for emergencies phone” like some of my contemporaries’ parents. She has never been one for supporting excesses, Naomi. Honestly, I doubt she would have had any inclination to buy me a phone even if I did have friends with which to communicate. It’s just not something she would deem necessary enough to warrant her attention.
It’s not that I suddenly think less of Dean, Archangel. Sexuality is not some magical barometer of “goodness” or “badness”. It is simply a piece in the whole of a person. But I certainly needed to reexamine
Starting to get wound up again by the thousand possible explanations bouncing around in his mind like Power Ball numbers, Castiel decided he needed to get things moving. “I’m confused, Dean,” he began, making sure no frustration or aggression crept into his voice. “The person who lives here – are they in?”
“Uh, no.” Dean finally looked up at Cas and took in a fortifying breath. “No, I’m… I’m not sure where I’m headed, actually.
In all my reading—and believe me, there was no shortage of that pastime in my formative years— the trope of leaving home has solidified itself quite definitively in my mind. Whether the moment depicts an uncertain goodbye from the Shire, a swift escape from Thornfield Hall, or a devastated pull away from Oz, a thread runs through. A breaking with something unspoken and divine. There is a distinct before and after separation, and even if before was unpleasant at times, the narrative tells us that the hero still feels its absence.
He’s shaking. He might be crying. He’s never been less sure that his words are being heard, and that includes both times he was in Purgatory. The weight of being truly free sinks down.
I write this letter to you from a remarkably comfortable lawn chair on a deck overlooking the glory of Lake Charlevoix. It is sunny, though sunset approaches, and a breeze is ruffling through my already disastrously messy hair. My feet are still coated in sand from a dip in the lake this afternoon, and I feel more awake in this moment than I ever did on Angel Farm. The world offers possibilities, breaking in these glistening waves, beaming down from these mountainous clouds.
Greetings from the Roadhouse. I just arrived in East Jordan for the brief summer break, so I am writing to you this evening from “my” booth in the corner after devouring one of Ellen’s spectacular bacon cheeseburgers and a chocolate milkshake. A few feet away, Jo is demolishing some Fudgies at the pool table, and Ash seems to be explaining some obscure concept of Astrophysics to a bemused Rufus at the bar. Perhaps it is strange that I feel so at peace here, but I cannot deny that I do.
I know—it sounds unlikely, doesn’t it? That I, who know so few people in the world, should somehow come to close a circle between two groups of them…it’s like something out of a screenplay. But here I sit, writing to you from a corner booth that I’m told was once the favored after school haunt of one Dean Winchester.
The thing is, Dean Winchester is a hell of a lot more complex than the persona he gives off. I had an inkling of this from our first meeting in November, honestly. He drives an absurd (though, admittedly, beautiful) muscle car, pitches his voice deliberately low like some sort of Eastwood cowboy, and dresses like a Carhartt ad. But if you watch him when he’s listening to someone else explain something, there’s a spark in his eye that belies real empathy. Behind the masculine posture is a true giver, the sort of man braced to leap in front of danger to protect anyone he calls a friend. He’s a fascinating study in contradictions.
“Yep. Matt got an alert about a potential exposure, so he quarantined for the last two weeks, and his tests all came back negative today. So, they’re celebrating as most couples do.” He’s got an amused smile on his face. He really is genuinely happy for them, as best Cas can tell. “Did we scandalize you earlier, with her going next door to her lover?”
“Only from the stands, unfortunately,” Cas reassured him, grinning fully now. “They have real professionals for the kind of photos you mean.”
“Yeah, that was…” Dean’s words died out, as if to suggest that there was no explaining what that had been like.
Cas rolled his eyes as he adjusted the guitar’s tuning. “Raph was hardly a rocker, and definitely not a star. But at least I got free guitar lessons out of him before he turned into a raging misogynist.”
Bobby lit the mosquito lamps as the sun slipped below the tree line across the lake, and it wasn’t long before Charlie ever-so-subtly asked Dean if he had brought his guitar along.
All in all, Mr. Smith is very pleased with your progress, and he hopes you will consider his offer for the future, as he truly believes your career is on track to take off spectacularly. He also offers his sincere congratulations regarding your recent news of publication.
Cas grinned at him, and they lapsed into silence, watching the crowd and listening to Dolly’s voice reverberate around the huge barn. Claire, Jody and Donna’s daughter, was cozied up in the doorway with the photographer, Kaia, and both looked a little flushed as they leaned their heads close to see the screen of Kaia’s camera. Dean seemed to have noticed them as well, and suddenly looked a bit too wistful for such a joyous day.
With a blush, Cas whacked Dean lightly on the arm. “You sap. Okay, sure. I can spare a few days to make out like a tween in your parents’ house, if you want.”
There’s a lot to unpack, there, not least finding out what “fix Heaven” means. But Castiel is uncomfortable and embarrassed and Dean will not have it. He is here and he is loved and he needs to know.
I know, I know, I’m not to expect a response, so questions like this will merely evaporate into the void, unanswered. But I would like to propose a deal. I have devised a rather silly nickname by which I intend to address you hence. If you are opposed, you will simply have to write to tell me so. You need not put in great effort: it can be a blank card that says only “No.” Like a cheap telegram. For that matter, you could dispatch your secretary send it. I’m sure you are a Very Busy Man, after all. The choice is yours. If I do not hear otherwise, you shall hereby be addressed in future correspondence as “Archangel”.  (Get it? Michael? Don’t laugh: I warned you I was raised by Evangelicals. And we have already established that “odd” is my most persistent quality.)
about Dean living in that house. His high school sweetheart grew up there, so it stands to reason that she still does. Why else would Dean be there? Castiel himself is only in his childhood home now because Dad left it to Gabriel when he died, and Castiel doesn’t have a home of his own any more. It could so easily be that the Braedens died or moved to Florida and left the house to their daughter and her daughter’s…boyfriend? Fiancé? Husband?
Archangel, I have to confess that in the hour between the phone call and our arrival at the café I had formed a rather unflattering image in my head of Bela’s cousin. From the way she spoke to and of him, I had invented a man of questionable taste and intelligence who somehow managed to be both unsavory and Casanova himself. He was clearly going to be a mess of contradictions, and none of them particularly pleasant.
“Aw, man, great song choice,” Dean’s voice called. Castiel’s playlist, largely made up of Motown soul, had just rolled over to Ray Charles’ “Georgia on my Mind”. When Dean spoke again, he was closer, right up against the screen door. “Mind if I join you? I brought cupcakes.”
There was a settling sense of déjà vu as Cass pulled into the space next to Bobby Singer’s ancient silver truck and let the engine of his car tick toward silence. It was bright and sunny, and he was in one of his favorite places on Earth, two cars away from a certain Chevy Impala that gleamed in the sun like it was still 1967. What else could possibly matter?
Soon enough, Dean and Cas were effectively the only guests left on the property. The parents would be sticking around slightly longer to close up the house and finish the last of the cleaning, but they waved off all offers to stay and help.
In the spirit of the new year, I’ve decided to take another stab at a diary-entry-style letter this month. I have no idea how this will go, honestly, but it seems like an intriguing enough experiment to be worth the risk. So, I hope you enjoy this month’s series of small ramblings in lieu of the usual extended ramble.
“So, what’s next for you,” Cas asked, hoping to refocus his friend on something more hopeful than lost love. “You said you’re going home to Lawrence for a bit?”
“Yeah,” Charlie agreed, staring at him with impressive force. Dean’s eyes broke away from Castiel’s, and he seemed to engage in some sort of silent battle with her, made up largely of eyebrow movements and looks of desperation.
Beyond that, she simply wants me to aim for something honest in this project. My characters are allowed to act and think sardonically, if desired, (as that is my usual impulse…) but for the underlying tone of the story she wants me to forego sarcasm and parody for the purposes of this exercise. She complimented my work in that particular arena, which has been central to stories like the one about to be published and the one you read last year. But for this project she wants me to explore something else. (Don’t worry, Archangel, I don’t intend to abandon the one style I know you enjoy!) From there, she simply says “let the work expand as much as it wants. Let it have genres, even if it bridges them. Let it build out into the unknown, and do not be afraid.”
“Holy shit,” he exclaimed, turning his attention back to the manuscript with all the reverence of a monk handling the Ark of the Covenant.
(Please don’t panic— I’m aware that’s now how jobs work. But in the glow of this giddy moment I simply cannot seem to let financial uncertainties and other petty realities formulate in my mind. Instead I shall float away on champagne bubbles for an evening, collect my professors’ good will, and get right back to work.)
Mary sighed. “Not ‘til Saturday night when you head off to the Bridal Suite. We have you three, Charlie & Jo, Ellen & Bobby, plus your dad & me. We’re at capacity with Ash on the couch and Garth in the basement.”
The damn cookies are delicious, though Castiel would enjoy them infinitely more if they hadn’t apparently been made by his crush’s wife/girlfriend.
She squeezed his shoulder lightly, eyes soft. “Well, that’s what we get for having a destination New Year’s. And at least we get to see you now.”
The moment sat there – a silent beacon marking the border where before meets so many potential afters. He could just say yes, lie by omission, but—no. He couldn’t. He needed, finally, to be honest. So, would this be an end? Or would his luck finally change? He closed his eyes and leapt off the cliff.
We have reached the final weeks of our tenure here at The Garden, and as you can imagine that means a wide variety of things all happening at once. The final projects are coming to the end of this phase of their lives, final words of wisdom are falling from the lips of our educators like summer rain, and the future looms in the distance, closer every moment. It’s all a bit daunting, but no less exciting for the uncertainty, in my opinion.
I will leave you with that for now, Archangel. I would like to dive into a new story idea this evening, and I must first write back to Alfie, who is struggling to decide on a costume for the school’s Halloween parade. Imagining his intense concentration as he makes this choice is bringing me the closest to homesickness that I have ever achieved, and I want to help him if I can, even from afar. Naomi (!) certainly won’t help—she thinks the only suitable costume for her children to wear involves wings and a halo. (Did I mention she’s a little fixated on this angel thing? Maybe that was implicit in the name of her farm, but it’s far more excessive, even, than that.)
All this is why I took the risk of inviting you in the first place, Archangel. I knew, objectively, that it was unfair of me to request such a thing of you. It was made plain from the start that I was never to know you, and how could I expect someone of your stature and importance to drop everything just to drive across the state to watch some twentysomethings receive a certificate? It is, on its face, an absurd idea.
It’s weighty, this admission, even if there’s a 50/50 chance he’s just talking into the dark. But it’s out, now. It’s done.
Sam deflated a bit, left standing in the middle of the living room looking lost and a little desperate. Hoping to help, Cas approached him.
“Yeah,” Dean answers. “He’s good. He’s out in California. He’s in Labor Law, so. You know. Plenty to do right about now.”
“You know, I’ve never been sure whether she hates my guts or wants to eat me alive, so I guess that makes sense.”
Then Jo’s diverted voice chimed in. “You’re gonna want to lock that up somewhere safe tonight, Winchester. Because I bet the Queen over here would sell several moderately essential organs to get her eyes on that manuscript.”
“Hello.” It’s the only word he can get out. He’s baffled. And possibly going into his version of fight or flight mode (attempting to melt into the floor beneath him in order to avoid both fight and flight).
“Don’t worry,” Mary warned, though the stiffness had largely been released from her shoulders. “I’m preparing the inquisition as we speak.” She hugged him again, then, and Cas could see Dean was soon to be forgiven.
Finally, (FINALLY!) Dean stepped back, though not nearly far enough in Cas’s opinion. He could still smell that woodsy Dean Winchester musk, and it was very distracting. “When did you get here?! And why the hell didn’t anyone tell me?” He punctuated this question by smacking Sam upside the head.
“Um,” Cas shakes himself, realizing that he has now put himself in exactly the position he drove home wanting to avoid: he now needs to tell his high school crush about the dumpster fire that is his life. “Well,” he begins, deciding humor is his best defense, “I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but there’s a pandemic going on.”
I couldn’t quite tell from your note about the Roadhouse whether you actually knew the place or simply knew of the vacant apartment. So, in case you’re unfamiliar, allow me to fill you in on this new world I’m exploring.
When he spoke, Dean’s voice was quiet, but determined. “It was me, Cas. I oversee the estate now, including the scholarship. I was gonna let the school or the estate lawyers or someone pick the recipients for the money after it got handed off to me, but—” He took a breath, fortifying, apparently, and sat up a little straighter. “I’ve been staying here for a while, and they still send the
In the end, it looked like Jess’s fears had been unfounded: as far as Cas could see, Grandma Esther spent much of the evening engaged in delighted conversation with Rick and his own mother, who Jess and her sisters insisted on calling “Grandma Barb” despite her fairly recent introduction into their lives. It warmed Cas’s heart to see these people work so hard to be good to each other. The Moores, he felt, were a damn inspiration.
“Look, I know I don’t do feelings right, but you could have asked. All that shit about ‘not being able to have me’? You’ve had me for years, Cas.”
“Right. Uh. You were so upset in that one letter when you were sick and feeling alone, so the irises were a message of friendship. And then with the sponsorship thing it was azaleas for ‘take care of yourself for me’. And potted, since you said you didn’t have much that was really ‘yours’. Oh, and the daffodils were for, uh, ‘regard’ and ‘new beginnings’.”
Cas had a sudden, vivid flash of a memory: 18-year-old Dean, freshly graduated from high school, sitting in the passenger seat of this very car, belting at the top of his lungs, “Look around, round, round! Dear Prudence, let me see you smile…”
So, monumental conversations, epiphanistic evenings, deep communal barings of the soul—well, let’s just say I’ve always considered them more optimistic plot devices than legitimate, real world possibilities.
Congratulations. You have been selected as the recipient of the Millicent Greenwaldt Memorial Scholarship. This prize is awarded to one University of Michigan-Flint student each year as he or she graduates with a degree in creative writing or poetry, and is intended to be used toward a graduate program of the student’s choice.
“Oh, um,” Dean was rubbing his neck again. He looked almost shy. “They can mean ‘desire for feelings to be returned’, I guess? But also, they’re kind of cheery and yellow- seemed like a friendly thing to have around. I just liked them.”
But this— returning to the Roadhouse, was something altogether new for me. There was no guarantee, when I left in January, that I would ever return. I knew I would like to, but my future was (and, truly, still is) too uncertain to know for sure. And while the Harvelle’s and their cohort had been wonderful to me throughout the holiday season, I couldn’t be positive that a return visit would be welcome even if I could manage it. I hoped, of course, but I could not be entirely certain their affection was genuinely as extensive as it felt when I left. When Ellen explicitly invited me to come back this summer, therefore, I was deeply honored. It put a warmth in my heart to be assured that I was wanted there, independent of usefulness. She and her family simply enjoyed my particular company, and they wished to experience it again.
“Yeah, well,” Dean teased. “I’m pretty glad he snores, really. Means I get you all to myself tonight.”
So, around this time, when I had written several small chunks of conflicted dragon ramblings, Garth made an unexpected suggestion. One of the others had asked over lunch how “the ghost dragon thing” was going, and when I explained about the new POV exercise, Garth exclaimed “that sounds like a children’s book waiting to happen!” Bela nearly choked on her sandwich in her haste to ask what the hell he was talking about, because “what parent wants to read their kid a story about a depressed dragon?” But, ever the earnest optimist, Garth laid out a fairly excellent point about the picture book medium and its potential to cover important topics within a fantastical framework, and how many different sorts of children who feel like outsiders could benefit from the dragon’s experience. By the end of his rant, even the ever-cynical Meg had to admit it was a valid point.
And then, another day gone to star-studded night brought us to his secret hilltop. Side by side again, we lay on a blanket watching the cosmos swirl as the car ticked to cool at the edge of the path, and Dean opened up his heart like a flower at dawn and spoke. Not only had he heard my past suggestions that his brother, Sam, might be within reach, he had taken it to heart. He told me, there in the mid-night glow, that he couldn’t shake my words, that for the first time in so long he saw small glimmers of hope in this particular mess. He shared with me the sort of fears I would not repeat (even to your own trusted ears), and I saw with burning clarity the depth of this man’s pain, the dismissal he automatically applies to himself, the void where his self-worth should shine. I did my best, Archangel, to meet these confessions with the care they deserve. I reached into my writer’s soul and released all the beautiful things he is to my eyes (holding back only the sort of details that could frighten a friendly companionship toward unease). I did my best, and he seemed, at least, to listen. We spoke long into the night, and found our way through strategies and plans he might employ should he opt to contact Sam. I can’t tell you whether he will act, in the end, but if anyone would be brave enough to take that plunge, I truly believe it would be Dean. I do so hope this goes his way. He deserves to gain his family back, however he can.
“Indeed, I do. He doesn’t live right in the city, but I’m confident you’d find Dexter, Michigan more than acceptable for your immediate needs, at least until you have solidified your more permanent plans.”
Cas feels his head tilt, his usual confusion response winning out over the vague dread that had been forming in his gut.
Cas creeps into the house, careful not to wake Gabriel, and tiptoes up to his own room to feed Bela. And, well. The least he can do is change out of this gross, sweaty t-shirt he’s been wearing for two days, right?
“So, you’re adrift.” Cas paused until Dean tilted his head in concession. Cas levelled him with a slightly teasing look and added, “That’s not the same as homeless.”
manners left, so first he adds, “It’s good to see you again, Dean.” Then he turns more fully toward his house, and gives a little wave back, just as awkward as Dean’s had been.
in tenth grade, and I wanted so badly for the voice of this author to be out in the world. And, for once, I could maybe help with that, you know? I had all this money that I don’t know what to fucking do with, and I knew where you went to school, and with Grandma’s name I could actually make sure some money got to someone who really deserved it. I didn’t know who you were or if you even needed a scholarship, but for the first time this estate felt like a gift rather than a curse, and I knew what I had to do with it. I—” He broke off for a minute, staring down at his hands. “I didn’t realize how hard your letters would make it to stay away. I’m a weak guy. In the end I
So many fears and stray pessimisms have bubbled up in my mind since Dean texted the invitation last night. First, there is the fact that I have kept up the charade of having an uncle (you) who sends me gifts for months now, weaving small lies into our conversations to keep up the appearance of family. On top of that, I am clearly feeling my own inadequacies much more keenly by virtue of imagining them through Dean’s eyes. He has risen from living in motels to a life of affluence and stability. Why in heaven’s name should he be bothering with a wayward weirdo like me when he could have anyone? I tutor for a living and live over my boss’s garage. The whole point of rising above poverty is that you can seek out romance with more vibrant and powerful people than you could have before, isn’t it? Maybe that’s a bit extreme. But really, how would I even begin to relate to his life? I know nothing of the normal ways of humans, let alone rich humans. And more importantly, perhaps, my romantic history is pretty much all literary— how can one date when one is an employee in his own home? (Not here! Jody and Donna are wonderful. But Naomi never afforded me luxuries like freedom or independence or visitors.) Alternatively, there is Dean, who was first described to me as a “playboy” by his own cousin. Knowing him as I do now, I can be fairly certain that he is more restrained now in that arena, but I don’t believe Bela was entirely misinformed. He experienced high school and college as so many others do, interacting with new people as much as possible, playing the field, experiencing romance from all sides as I have never had occasion to do.
