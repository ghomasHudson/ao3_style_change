Tony closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. He felt like shit.
He pulled back long enough to say, “Let’s get rid of this,” then pulled Tony’s shirt over his head and tossed it away.  He bent over Tony’s chest, kissed the arc reactor, then licked the scarred flesh around it, worshipping it with his tongue.  From the reactor, Steve moved on to Tony’s nipple.  He took it in his mouth, grazing it with his teeth until it pebbled.  Tony muttered, “Oh god, baby, yes,” under his breath, unaware he had even spoken as Steve turned his attention to the other one.  He caught it between his teeth, then ran his tongue over it.  Tony fisted his hand in Steve’s hair and held him in place with a guttural moan.
“Yeah, he does, but-”
Steve shook his head.  "I'm not."
“Nope,” Tony said, starting to back away. “Don’t say no. We’ll just say you owe me, okay?” He was nodding his head, smiling that same sweet, friendly, wicked smile. “‘Kay? You owe me a coffee, okay?”
“He’s here? He’s here in this house?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked a question at Strange and he nodded.  “I’ll be back in fifteen minutes.”  A look of vague consternation crossed his face.  “Please...be ready.”
Tony tipped his head to rest against Steve’s. He bit his lip. He was breathing hard, almost panting. That hadn’t mattered when Steve was kissing him, giving him his own breath, but now he felt like he couldn’t get enough oxygen. Like he was drowning.
guy.  His best guy.
“He loved you.  He’s always loved you.”
Steve pulled back a little, his eyes still closed, his hand still knotted in the leather of Tony’s jacket.  “You shouldn’t have to touch me while I’m in this thing,” he murmured.  “I’m sorry.”
“Wake me if you need me.”
Tony took a step toward him, reached out his hand to take Steve’s, but then Howard called, “Tony. Time’s up. Get in the car.”
Tony nodded. “Okay.”
Steve didn’t trust himself to speak. He just nodded instead, and Howard followed Tony, pulling the door shut behind him.
The sun was starting to go down.
“See you around, Stark,” he said, and only the tiniest tremor in his voice told Tony he was trying desperately to hold himself together.
“No,” Peterson said, looking relieved by Tony’s calm demeanor. “Just a little engine trouble, but the pilot was able to put it down safely. No one even got jostled much.”
with him, Tony felt a wave of kindness.  Of understanding, and he welcomed it in whole-heartedly.
“And that cow got out and licked Sam’s face.”
“Sam. Drop it.”
“Tony?”
“I think we’re past that point, don’t you?”
“Strange said you needed someplace quiet to convalesce.”
Steve wet his lips again. Tony wasn’t sure if it was deliberate or not. “Or something.”
“That's very nice, Morgan,” he said. “Very...colorful.”
Sam shook his head.  “I asked, but nobody’s seen her.”
Tony squeezed Bruce’s knee.  “Did I say good man?  Because I meant great.”
But knowing that still didn’t stop the nightmares.
She had stopped when Tony said her name, but she was dancing from foot to foot. “Daddy,” she whined looking up at him, but his eyes were on the guy coming toward them.
“Anything’s fine, baby. We’re not picky.”
“I’m-”
“I-I saw, I
.” He sat down on Morgan’s other side. “Not like we haven’t seen it fifty times in the last couple weeks.” He stretched his arm along the back of the couch and rubbed the back of Steve’s neck. “Which is your fault, by the way. Ever since the aquarium, she hasn’t wanted to watch anything else.”
it gets.  And then everything else gets better, too.”
. It hurt his heart, seeing that, but in a way it was probably better. He was pretty sure he would have really broken down if there’d been more to it.
Sam watched them for a minute, then shook his head. “Didn’t need to hear that,” he muttered under his breath.
“Do I?”
“Tell me one.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “Okay,” he said, then gave Steve a playful shove toward the stairs. “Move, Rogers. I’m trying not to lose my shit, but if she opens the door, it’ll never happen.”
“Danvers?  She was here with me.”
Steve threw the cashew at him, then looked at the table. He couldn’t help the way his mouth ticked up into a little smile, though. “We never made out in the janitor closet,” he muttered.
you love me?”
Steve leaned forward and picked up one of the bottles of nail polish. It was a deep, dark red, the color of Bordeaux poured into a crystal glass. He rolled it between his hands like his mother did before she painted her nails, then opened the little bottle. “How’s that going, anyway?” he asked, as he adjusted Tony’s hand on his thigh to a better angle, and swept the color onto the nail of his index finger. It shone in the soft lamp-light. “Working with your father? Is it okay?”
Sarah stood up, wincing a little, then picked up her cup. “More coffee, sweetheart?”
It was only when the bullet punched through his stomach that he realized that had been a grave mistake.
"Thanks for coming to pick us up," Tony said, trying to get him to say something--anything--but Steve kept his face forward. Tony tried to think if he had ever seen him so mad, and he couldn't do it. The image of his little, pleased smile kept getting in the way. He hoped he'd get to see it again sometime soon.
“I know,” FRIDAY soothed.  “But it will be alright.”
Tony bent down and kissed his mouth. Fully and completely, letting his tongue in, tasting him thoroughly. He didn’t care who saw. At the moment, he didn’t care if the whole school lined up to take pictures and sent them all to Howard at his SI office. “Really,” he said. “Please, baby? Let’s just go, okay?”
“But, look,” Tony said, overriding him.  He went to a panel showing a long list of numbers, letters, and symbols, and used his thumb and middle finger to expand it.  Tony took a pen from behind his ear and used it to point at the image.  “Look at that.  Know what that is?”
"Ow!"
“Shhh,” Tony soothed, brushing his fingers through Steve’s hair, kissing his neck, his shoulder. “It’s okay, baby. Everything’s okay, remember?”
isn’t working.  I can’t get it to work.  I don’t know what to say, and even if I did, it wouldn’t be good enough for
Tony helped him onto the bed and kissed his forehead.  “Just close your eyes, okay?” he said.  “For a little while?”
Tony watched as a corner of Steve’s mouth lifted just a fraction of an inch. Just enough to give him some hope that maybe he wouldn’t stay angry forever. He kind of wished he’d been the one to make it happen, but for now at least, he was just glad it had happened at all.
“Wow, Steve,” Tony said, finally applying the flame.  “I had no idea you were such a little youthful offender.”
Tony nodded.  “Yeah.  I didn’t ever get that.  There was always just a party for S.I.  We never did the whole ‘Brady Bunch’ family Christmas thing.”
Once he was satisfied with his rooms, he went down the hall to the kitchen.  It was still early.  The sun was just coming up over the skyline.  No one else had been here yet.  Steve scooped coffee grounds into the coffeemaker and turned it on.  He didn’t drink coffee--the caffeine made him jittery--but everyone else did, and by unspoken rule, the coffee-pot was kept full from dawn until dusk.  Unspoken by everyone, that was, except Tony, who spoke it enough for everyone else combined.
“How do you know I meant a pangolin?  I might have meant a dog.”
“We’re idiots.”
“Okay,” Tony said.  “But I’m here.  And Fury’s not.  So, let me give you a ride, okay?  No strings attached.  No agendas.  No expectations.  Just a ride.  Okay?  Let me do that.”
home--in almost ten years.”
“I barely knew him,” Steve said quietly. “I only met him two days ago.”
Steve squeezed his shoulder. “‘Kay. Thanks. See you later.”
A comfortable silence stretched out between them.  A hundred questions flashed through his mind--where had she been?  When did she get back?  How long was she staying?--but none of them really mattered.  All that mattered was that she was here now.  The sounds of the city reached his ears, but it was far away, unimportant next to the sound of her easy respiration.  He nuzzled the crook of her neck, smelling her skin, taking comfort in her mere presence.
They'd worked their way through
“No,” Steve said, then considered. “Well, yeah, that too, but
“You’re just putting me through the wringer for fun, aren’t you, Rogers?”
of drinks--and sun, and sand, and Gina in a bikini that was really nothing more than a wisp of fabric barely covering the good parts.
Quickly, almost without even thinking about it, Steve leaned into Tony and pressed his lips against his cheek. It was brief, firm, and dry, but Steve pulled away feeling dazed, and a little shocked that he had just done it. But he felt good too. Like it had been the right thing. Especially when Tony’s hand rose to his cheek and brushed his fingers against the spot where his lips had been only a moment before.
have too much in his head.  He
Howard chuckled and sat down in an empty booth in the corner. Steve slid in across from him. When the server came over, Howard ordered a coffee. She told Steve he’d had too much coffee. Said she’d bring him an orange juice instead.
He finally did call him. He had to. He knew it would just be worse if he didn’t. Steve half-hoped Tony wouldn’t answer and he could just leave a message, but of course that didn’t happen. Of course his attentive, loving, meticulous man would never let Steve’s call go unanswered. Of course he would answer on the first ring.
“I didn’t say stop,” Tony said, and grabbed the hem of Steve’s sweater.  “Just take this off.”
Tony.  “I wouldn’t expect someone with your, ah, heritage to understand, sir, but the captain will surely--”
, and Tony responded in kind, kissing back with a fervor that, for all the times he’d kissed Gina, he hadn’t felt in months.
"Even the bad stuff?"
“That’s funny, is it?”
Tony stretched his hand down to touch his cheek, ran his fingers over his beard. “Baby,” he whispered. “Please.” He put his finger on Steve’s plush bottom lip. “Put your mouth on me, okay?” he said. “That’s what I want right now. First. Okay? Please?”
Steve sighed heavily. Tony had heard that sigh before. Seen the way he passed his hand over his face, then up through his hair. He’d seen it many times. It was Steve’s patented Tony’s-testing-me-but-I’m-trying-to-stay-cool gesture. Some tiny part of Tony appreciated that. Even now, in his state of utter distress, a tiny part of him rejoiced at seeing that familiar, sweet gesture. It meant there was still some friendship there.
When not in meetings, Steve kept to his room and the training room.  If he was hungry, he asked if the kitchen was empty.  If FRIDAY said it was, he’d go make something and bring it back to the room to eat.  If she said somebody was in there, he waited until they were gone.
“What are you smiling at?”
The sweet and the sour...
“Steve?” she said, and nodded to Tony’s cup.
“Hmm,” she said, a small, mischievous smile on her lips.  “I
That laugh again, weak but fond, and his hand against Tony’s neck.  “Shut up, Tony.”
“No.”
Right this moment, Steve was inclined to agree.
“Tony told me you weren’t feeling well,” he said gingerly, as if he was picking his words very carefully. “I wanted to...make sure you were alright.”
“You're not going to a hospital, Steve. I promise. Okay? You're with me. You're stuck with me.  I'm never going to give up on you,” he said, then laughed under his breath.  “Frankly, I’m a little offended.  Since when do I give up on something I want?  I mean, come on, you know me better than that.”
When he and Steve had moved in before, the cabin had been one bedroom, one bathroom, a living room, a kitchen, a loft.  Pretty decent, as far as cabin-living went, but now there were three new bedrooms, two new bathrooms, and a lab with all the same toys as the one in the Tower.  He’d left the garage as it was--he liked the old-timey feel of it.  It reminded him of his mother--but had connected it to the house by a glassed-in walkway that stayed warm even in this frigid cold.  He liked walking to the garage in his shirt sleeves and bare feet.  He liked stopping on the way there and looking out at the cold morning through the ice-laced glass.  It made him happy in the same indistinct way solving an obscure coding riddle made him happy.
The counterman called his number--funny, considering it was just him and one guy who looked to be asleep in the back booth.  Tony paid, dropped in a cash tip, and left.
"Atticus killed a dog," Tony pointed out.  "You were okay with that."
Tony stared at Steve’s face, at his body, even thinner than it had been when he’d seen him at Christmas, that old t-shirt hanging on him.  Of course, they wouldn’t be feeding him right.
Tony shook his head. “I thought about it,” he said in his new slow voice. “London or Berlin. But they’re too far away. Staying here isn’t really an option right now, but I can’t be that far away from Morgan either. We’re doing joint-custody, and when she’s with Pepper, I need her to know I can be with her within a few hours if she needs me. And when she’s with me, that she can be with her mom if she needs
“I didn’t expect any.”
Tony shrugged.  “I was in the neighborhood.”
holding Steve’s hand while he drove with him beside him. Steve didn’t seem to notice. He just sat looking out the window the way he’d always done, his head against the head-rest. Looking at him out of the corner of his eye, Tony could just see the way his lips looked, soft and relaxed, his eyes drifting closed, then opening again. Tony watched him as he drove, his hands guiding the car automatically, as if they knew the way all on their own.
you to crush me.”
“No,” Steve said. “At least-” Pause. “No.”
Steve turned on his side, rubbing his eyes.  It was dark.  It was always dark in the hole, and the light from the corridor stung.
"Nat?  Is he…?"
Tony had not asked about Thaddeus Ross.  He had not asked even after they saw a newsfeed about him being found wandering near a hospital in Wichita, incoherent, but with a small smile on his face.  As if he were existing in a state of pure, easy quiet. He had not asked if Steve had anything to do with it. He had not asked, and Steve felt no real desire to tell him.
Pietro shook his head in defeat. “I know you did,” he sighed, and ran his thumb over Steve’s high cheekbone. “But, honey, that’s the problem. Don’t you get that? I can’t be with someone who has to
“No way. I already made that mistake.”
Tony moved closer and put his hand s on Steve’s arm.  “I love you.”
Tony took a step closer, reached out and touched Steve’s wrist. “Maybe I should have waited until July to bring you up here again.”
Steve obeyed, getting his knees underneath him, then allowing Tony to position him exactly the way he needed him to be. Allowing Tony to just take over completely, moaning brazenly as he slid into him. He dropped his forehead down onto the bed where his forearms were braced against the mattress. He could feel the silk of the tie still covering his eyes rubbing against his skin every time Tony thrust forward, and it was both grounding to him, and yet the most freeing experience he had ever had. He was floating. Flying. Tethered to the earth by only the most tenuous of strings--a string of pure silk--and some unknown time later, when Tony came deep inside him, Steve held tight to that string, held tight for fear that he might just disappear into the deep blue of the sky and never return.
Steve shook his head.  “I don’t know.  Nothing, I guess.  It’s not an excuse.  I’m not excusing what I did, I’m just telling you what happened.”
Steve nodded without saying a word.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “I said
Nat and Bruce were the most frequent.  They lived in the city, and it was easiest for them.  Peter lived here too, but he didn’t come much anymore.  Tony had put a restriction on his access during one of his more lucid moments.  The kid did
“I had bad dreams before,” she said lightly.
“Yes.”
Tony had asked Natasha for a visit in a few weeks.  “Give us ‘til July,” he’d said, “then come up.  You bring the beer and I’ll cook the steaks.  It’ll be fun.”  She’d asked if she could bring someone and he’d hesitated only a second before saying yes, sure she could bring someone.  She’d been spending time with Bruce again, but Tony had seen the way she looked at Bucky when they came to visit Steve in Wakanda.  He thought it might be a toss-up between the two.  Or maybe she’d just bring Sam.  Sometimes no pressure was the best choice.
He recognized the near-insanity of his thoughts as he drove back the way he'd come, retracing his route back to the hospital and Tony, and as he neared that place, that shadowy, golden place on the road, that hair-pin turn, he took his phone out and called Natasha.
He hadn’t been back.  Not since Christmas night.
“No.  I don’t care.  Come here.”
“Well?” Tony asked.  “How is it?”
like he was ten.  A good, happy ten.
“No, honey,” she answered, wiping the blood away.  “It’s Natasha.”
“Please don’t tell me you’re upset that we saved you,” Tony said.  “My ego will take a real hit if I thought you’d rather die than be with me.”
Tony turned around so she could see Steve over his shoulder. “That’s okay too. He’s still here. See?”
“Steve doesn’t want me to call him.”
“He never puts on that suit again,” Ross said.  “And the shield becomes government property.”
“There you two are,” Tony said.  “I thought you’d run away together.  Nat and I were just debating whether
He turned back to Steve.  “Hey, you wanna--” he stopped.  Steve was gone.  He was alone in the driveway.
She lifted her chin and stared back, her gaze like a dagger.  “No.  He wanted to stay here.  He didn’t want to die in some fucking hospital room.”
Tony laughed and put his phone back into his pocket.  He leaned over the table and blew the candles out one by one.  He looked at the fire in the hearth.  It was nearly burned out, just a blanket of coals and ash.  All it needed was a log tossed in and it would start anew, the flames rising, blazing to life again.  He started away, then came back and tossed two pieces of hickory onto the coals.
“Steve?”
“You’re smart too.”
“Scott said he was with Peter, that spider kid from the airport, but he said he’d tell him.”
Who sang that?
, he thought as he shouldered his bag and started to climb up the stairs.
“Yeah.”
“Good,” Bucky answered.  “That’s good.”  He glanced down at Tony’s feet, at the name he had almost spelled out, then, using his own toe, added the last letter.  E.  S-T-E-V-E.
Tony sighed. “I know he is.” He kept touching Steve. Kept drawing unconscious comfort just from the feel of him. “But he’s not the only one. Bruce and I went to lunch today, and there was a couple at the restaurant.” He rolled his eyes at the memory of his own reaction. “I...I kind of said some of the same things about them that Clint said to us, and-”
“Did you feel like I didn’t want you here?”
a kid? Would, would, would…?
“Yeah. Thank you.”
“It was the opposite of funny,” Tony said, but his hands had begun to roam up Steve’s back, pulling him closer.  He shivered as Steve’s teeth closed lightly on his earlobe.  “So, this is how you win arguments?  You’re not exactly following the rules of war,
“I don’t think you have to say anything, Steve. I think you did exactly what she needed you to do. You listened.”
“Tony,” Steve said again, chanting it like a steadying mantra.  “Tony, Tony, Tony.”
Thanks for reading! Another nice chapter, then we'll start getting into the real meat of this thing...
Tony eased the door open and stepped inside.  The room was big, airy, with little feminine touches that said the lady of the house definitely slept here, too.  A vanity on the far wall with lotions, and creams, and a monogrammed silver hairbrush.  A vase of flowers.  A soft chenille robe tossed at the foot of the bed.  There was also a duo of picture frames on Thaddeus’ side table.  One was a posed photo of the family.  Mrs. Ross and the daughter, both in pearls, smiling in stiff-backed chairs with Thaddeus standing behind them, a hand on each of their shoulders.  A campaign photo if ever there was one.  The other was the polar opposite.  It was outside, candid, natural.  The photographer--the daughter, maybe--had caught Mrs. Ross in a laugh, her head turned, her hair a light brown haze, loose and carefree.  She was wearing a sleeveless top, and her shoulders were sunburned.  A pair of sunglasses dangled from one hand.  Ross stood behind her, arms clasped around her middle, his head dipped into the soft juncture of her neck and shoulder.  It looked like he had either just kissed her there, or was about to.
“Damnit, Tony,” he muttered, and started for the door to the stairs.  Tony grabbed his arm.
Steve smiled at him, soft and sweet.
“Oh yeah?”
For some reason, Steve felt a blush beginning to heat up his cheeks. Tony’s young, eleven-year-old voice in his ears:
Tony groaned and Steve couldn’t help but smile a little. It would be okay. Tony was mad, but not
“Your convalescent castle awaits,” he said.
hanging there. It felt
“Fuck you,” Rhodey said, and they both dissolved in laughter.
“And you get that I have to be careful? About what happens to her? About who I let in?”
twenty-five years into the four or five he realistically had left.
“You too,” she said, smiling, and kissed his mouth before putting her arms around him.  Tony hugged her firmly, then turned to Sam.
my business.”
They didn’t speak while Steve parked the car. Or while they walked out of the parking garage and into the front door. They didn’t speak while they waited for the elevator. Or in the elevator. Or on the way out of the elevator.
Tony laughed, sliding down Steve’s body to kneel at his feet, caressing every inch of exposed skin as he went. “Mmm. That’s okay,” he murmured. He leaned over to kiss Steve’s flat stomach. His tongue danced across the muscles there as he touched the waistband of his swim-shorts. “You don’t have to spout poetry. But I do need you to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, okay?” He kissed his stomach again, his hip. “Can I take these off?”
Tony had forgotten how long
Tony shrugged.  “Yeah, of course we are, but…”
And now that voice was almost always on his side.  It almost always was a help to him.  Instead of self-hatred, it had become the voice of self-preservation instead.  And it helped.  Especially when Steve wasn’t near him, it helped.
Tony was on his feet and across the room in two seconds flat. He had just enough time to see Steve’s exhausted face light up before he was throwing himself into his arms and kissing him forcefully.
Tony glanced around to make sure they were still alone, then cupped his hand around the back of Steve’s neck. The ends of his hair brushed deliciously against Tony’s wrist. “I would never get upset,” he said. “You know that, right?”
Okay, here's another one that I have to get away from me. This is really only half the chapter, but I'm splitting it up for my own peace of mind. I'll post the next half in a few days. I'm shooting for Thursday. Let's see if I make it.
“Steve?” Tony said.  “Baby?”  He looked at the other three, their worry and fear compounding his own.
“I do understand that, Stephen.  Sometimes I don’t think you realize I do, but I do.  It’s just hard.  We went through a lot to be together, me and Steve, and not knowing what’s going on with him, it’s...it’s just hard.”
He went outside afterward. He thought it was probably bad form to smoke on the church steps, so he took it down the block a little and stood with the other knot of people who had the habit, all of them in their Sunday best, three little old ladies and two other guys, none of them speaking, all of them saving their breath to suck on their cigarettes. Steve didn’t mind the silence. In fact, he liked it. He also liked the camaraderie. Even if they didn’t know each other. Even if they were quietly killing themselves and they all knew it, at least he wasn’t doing it alone.
“Stupid,” Steve spat. “I was so fucking stupid. What can I give you, Tony? Huh?” He pulled himself out of Tony’s arms with a jerk of his shoulders. “God, even with whatever I make in the army, it wouldn’t be enough. It wouldn’t be what you’re used to. It wouldn’t be what you
Tony went back to the couch and sat down heavily.  “Bruce?  Will you get rid of that, please?”
Tony barked shocked laughter and ran his hand through Steve’s hair. “Wow. Okay. I’m definitely using that line next time the board gives me shit about money...which will probably be at the meeting on Friday. Which is why Pep needs expense reports tomorrow.”
“God, you’re a flirt.”
Sam stood by, his eyes traveling back and forth between them.  “Wow.  That was easy.”
They’d made a little place for themselves in a nook between the helicopter pad and the raised ledge of the outer wall.  It wasn’t much, just an old cot, a couple of blankets, and a cooler one or the other of them kept stocked with beer and soda, but it was better than some of the accommodations they’d had while on the run.  And it was
“Mm-hmm.”
“Whoa,” Tony said, holding up a hand. And he thought his head was reeling before. That was a quiet little merry-go-round in a kiddie play-park compared to the tornado that was raging now. “What?”
They’d lie there, side-by-side, and maybe after a while, he’d feel the brush of Steve’s fingers against his own, and he’d lace them together. God, they’d go together so easily. So perfectly. And they’d lie there in that shifting rainbow of shadow, holding hands, quiet in their corner, the lights of the city like the stars at their feet, and it would feel like heaven. Just like heaven.
He wasn’t sure how Steve felt, though, especially when his eyes narrowed the slightest bit. “Why
“More?  He already has so much in his system.”
, how had he lived without Steve beside him, his hands on him, his eyes on him?  How had he not fallen without Steve to bear him up?  How had he not floated away without Steve to tether him?
Tony somehow discovered a way to pull Steve’s arm tighter around himself, and cuddled even closer back against his chest. “That’s nice to hear,” he said. “Sometimes when I’m home, even when Howard’s there, I still feel alone. I never feel alone when I’m with you.”
“It’s okay,” Steve repeated.  He began to move his thumb gently over Tony’s hip.  Just soft, barely-there sweeps, but Tony felt it in his every nerve-ending.
Steve shook his head.  “No,” he whispered with fervid certainty.
“I wanted to talk.”
“I want you, baby.  So much,” Tony whispered, moving to trail hot, wet kisses down Steve’s throat.  His pulse was rapid, almost dangerously fast beneath Tony’s lips.  He sucked on the pulse-point lightly, the tiny noises coming from Steve’s lips going straight to his cock.
“Good.  I lost the radio signal.”
“I’m the Sorcerer Supreme, and I have the Time Stone at my disposal,” Strange dead-panned.  “Nothing’s impossible.”
“Put my next round on his tab,” Tony said to the bartender as he brought Strange’s drink.  “He likes paying for things.”
“Yes.”
“It’s Bruce, right?” Tony grumbled.  “Christ, that guy’s a slut.”
They were quiet. Steve pet Dodger’s head, continuously, softly. He didn’t make any move to talk to Tony. His body was warm, but he didn’t try to touch him, either. The only part of his body that moved was his fingers in the dog’s fur, and finally Tony--who was trying his goddamndest to be patient--couldn’t stand it anymore.
Tony backed toward the bed, tugging Steve with him by the hand.  “We don’t have to do anything,” he said.  “Just lay here with me.  Okay?  Come on, just lie down.  Just-Just be here.  Okay?”
than before.  If he hadn’t been in reasonable shape, he would have been worried about his health.  Even so, he did worry a little.  Exponentially more than he had before.
“Yeah.  It does.”  He glanced up.  “Thank you too, FRIDAY,” he said.  “For keeping an eye out.”
“The light was like hypnosis,” Steve breathed, and Tony began to move again, pulling him slowly but insistently, just the way Steve liked.
“Hmm,” Tony mused. Steve could see a couple of suck-marks on his neck. His stomach roiled, anger and jealousy trying to steal his quiet, but his brain wouldn’t let it. Thank god. He had cursed his brain a million times over the years for not being smart enough, but right now, he wouldn’t have traded it for anything in the entire world. “What if I’d left?” Tony said, and Steve’s brain didn’t waste a single second in answering.
Tony held out the napkin. “Here,” he said. “I expect you to use this.” Steve reached for it, and when he did, their fingers brushed together. Steve felt a jolt of electricity and drew in a breath as Tony hooked his index finger around Steve’s. “I mean it,” Tony said in a softer tone. “I know you don’t like promises. But I need this one.”
“Two weeks.”
"Doctor Strange," he said, "what happened?"
“Maybe I’ll just keep him,” Tony said idly. “Take him to the office with me. Everybody would probably love to see a dog. People love dogs. Like half the internet is about dogs. And kittens. And porn.”
“Ready,” Steve said. “On my mark.”
other pies. Then we can take one to Nat and Sam’s tomorrow night when we go for dinner. How does that sound?”
He led her over to where Sarah stood, and maneuvered her in front of him. “This is Mrs. Rogers,” he said. “She’s Steve’s mom.”
Steve lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “I thought Miss Potts needed those expense reports and stuff by tomorrow?”
Beneath his hands, Steve moved.  He tilted his head, drew in a deep breath.  “Hey,” Tony coaxed.  “Wake up, Steve.  Come on.  Please.”
It landed on Tony’s neck, right at the base of his throat.  Steve kissed him there sometimes.  Lovingly.  Tenderly.  “Not much of a prize,” Ross said.
Strange wouldn’t allow Tony to come around to the facility and watch Steve’s progress, but he would not refuse Bruce.  Tony had recruited him as his spy, and he went as often as he could, gathering intel and bringing it back to Tony--and Natasha.  She wasn’t allowed at the facility, either.
Sarah laughed softly, then lay back. “Promise me you’ll go home after the surgery, okay? It’s not going to do you or me any good to hang around here all day long. I want you to go home. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Okay?”
, Steve, why do you have to make everything so hard? Let’s just go. Okay? Please? Pretty please? You’re making
Tony’s face didn’t change. He kept looking at Steve with his dark, dark eyes. “Are you sure? I mean, it’s not my best subject, but I could help. If you wanted. You could come over after school.” He shrugged, his lips curving just a little tiny bit. “I could...quiz you, or something?”
“Is there anything else, Tony?”
Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath.  No bacon in here.  He thanked the Virgin Mary again.
“Sounds good.”
that would keep it busy.
Steve's lips curved into a small, sad smile.  “Yeah.  For a change.”  He raised a hand and pressed his fingertips to the window.  Even from here, Tony could see the ghostly image of its reflection reaching back, a mirror-twin only prevented from grasping his hand and pulling him away by a thin, icy pane of glass.  “I’m sorry about what I did to you,” he said.
He knew. He knew them all. He could picture the guy who sang it, all chest hair and sexy-seventies mustache. Howard had owned that album. Weird to think about
“So, your sexiness quotient wasn’t high enough already? You have to smoke now too?” Tony asked, eyeing his cigarette. “You really have changed.”
“It’s great,” Steve said, hoping to ease that worried frown. “Just right. Thank you.”
care? Come over here, baby. I want to see you.”
I don’t think we should. Not yet.”
pulled
Steve thought about it for a minute, his tongue creeping out of his mouth to touch his lip, thinking about sitting in Tony’s car again, having him drive fast along the streets until they got to his, no doubt, huge apartment downtown. He thought about going up in an elevator with him, going through his door. He had never been to Tony’s house before, but he’d seen enough stuff on tv about how the other half lived to know that it would be big and beautiful, full of stuff that cost more than anything Steve had probably ever even
There was movement behind her, more felt than heard.  “Sam,” she said, and went to his side.
nice,” Steve insisted. “But we’re over. I haven’t seen him or talked to him in three years. He can do whatever he wants.”
“I didn’t--” he wet his lips nervously, the pink of his tongue, rabbit-quick.  “I didn’t expect to see you.”
Tony looked up, squinting as his eyes tried to adjust. It was harder than it probably should have been. He’d been down here a long time, and he also kept forgetting to put his glasses on when he was doing the small, detailed stuff. He rubbed them with one fist, then blinked a few times for good measure until he could finally see, but when he did, he had another problem completely--now, he couldn’t breathe.
Steve slumped down on the chair in front of Mr. Barker’s desk and put his head in his hands. They were shaking. He could feel them against his own forehead. His mouth was dry. His eyes felt too hot, too big. His head felt too big too. Huge with all the things Mr. Stark had said, and all the implications of those things. Words kept flashing through his mind. Love. Responsibility. Mediocrity. All those things. Those words. They beat inside his head like loud, crashing drums. Like thunder. And he was afraid. Afraid of what it meant. Afraid of what he’d do. What he’d be forced to do.
Steve closed his arms tighter.  “Nobody’s going to...talk about it, are they?” he asked.  “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Steve shook his head.  He finally looked at Tony.  Just a glance, but it was Steve.  Just Steve.  Tony felt everything inside him loosen.  He sat back, threw a leg over the arm of his seat, and sipped his water.
He didn’t always hear them, but when he did, he felt better. When he did, he slept easier. When he did, it settled him in a way nothing else could. Because he was a solitary guy, yeah, sure, but he didn’t want to feel lonely. Those voices made him feel less lonely. They always did.
“I guess I had almost-normal with Pep, but...you know...after that.”  He shrugged.
“No.  Red, I don’t want you to feel those things.  I remember enough of what it was like to know I don’t want
“I don’t mind at all. I’ll see if I can find you something to wear.”
“They  looked into that.  It was clean.”
He didn’t even hesitate before hitting ‘send’.
“Think what you want.  You never were able to see the truth when it came to me.”
Tony and Jen sat at her kitchen table.  They each had a cup of coffee and a piece of banana bread.  Jasmine had made it that morning. It was heavenly.
Tony was suddenly terrified he was going to mention Howard and Maria.  He didn’t want to hear it.  Not now.  Not after talking about Steve.  It would feel like a step backward.  Tony didn’t want that.  He wanted to leave this on a warmer note.
Tony kissed him again, and pulled him into a tight hug so he could whisper into his ear. “Baby, please don’t worry about that, okay? I love you. I want you with me. If it would make you more comfortable to move somewhere cheaper, then we can, but I don’t want money to be the reason that we don’t get to be together. Okay? I don’t want that outside stuff to affect us. ‘Cause it doesn’t matter. Not really. Does it? When you really think about it, does it matter if we live here, or in Brooklyn, or out in Queens or whatever? What matters is us. You and me. That’s what matters to me. That’s
Steve drew in a long breath and hummed it back out as he eased even further into Tony’s touch.
“Yes, I did.”
“I’m not going to stop it.  I’m never going to stop it.”
“Yes, but is your death imminent?”
“Tony?”
He stood up.
“It’s February fifteenth.”
Tony nodded.
“Are you boys ganging up on me?”
"Didn't think so."
Steve ducked his head, hiding it from Tony.  “Get your pizza, Tony,” he said in a voice that was too husky, too raw.
And why was it the only thought in his head?
“It wasn’t what I expected,” he said.  “There were so many people.”  He looked up, his face cloudy.  “They all had their phones out, Tony,” he said, distress outlining every word.  “Why would they do that?  Why would they go to see one of the most beautiful things ever created and then belittle it like that?”
Steve hooked his arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him against his chest. “And I’ve got that stupid budget for the shelter,” he said bitterly, gesturing again to the pile of papers on the table. “Trying to pull money out of politicians is like a dentist trying to pull somebody’s wisdom teeth out through their ass.”
Natasha handed a glass to Steve then sipped her own, eyeing him over the rim. “I was kidding before, but you really were causing trouble.”
“Get the fuck out of here,” Clint said, good-naturedly, flapping his hand at the group like they were nothing more than a bunch of troublesome flies.
Tony grimaced. “Oh. That one.”
“Just dirty, huh?”
Tony’s face went blank, then he nodded again.  “Okay.  Well, that’s good, right?  I mean, that
Tony sighed.  “It’s not ‘drugs’, Steve, it’s an antidepressant.  It’s fine.”
--to come in and help brighten the dark places.
“I know I shouldn’t have hit him,” Steve said, still gnawing at his nail.  “It wasn’t what he said--” he looked at Tony, just a glance, then he put his head in his hand, rubbing at his temples.  “I mean, it
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “I do.  I really do.  But Ross was right.  I’m not really allowed.  I should have thought of that.  This whole thing was all my fault.”
“Don’t do that.  Talk to me.”
“Then maybe we make a little movie of our own.”
Tony went to get his pizza.
“White flag, Nat,” he said.  “I surrender.”
“Do you want...my mouth, or--?”
And there it was.  She knew he’d get her there.  She took both of his hands in hers and leveled him with a gaze that was kind yet stern.  God, she loved him.  It was not the untouchable secret love she kept locked in her heart for Clint, or the beginnings of romance she’d felt for Bruce.  It was clear and fierce, almost maternal.  It had been born when he’d saved her life in Zola’s lab in New Jersey, and had strengthened while they, along with Sam and Wanda, had gone on the run together.  She held onto it now and let it pour from her into him through her hands and her eyes, and hopefully, her words.
Even more complicated...
“Tell me what happened.”
Or maybe, he’d never known.
We're getting closer to the end, guys, but there's still a little ways to go.  Thanks for sticking with me through the ups and downs!
“How do you come back from that?” he asked.  His eyes were downcast, far away.  He was back in that bunker, the shield in his hands, ready to deliver the final crushing blow.  She could almost see him there.  “Is is even possible?”
“The light’s bright enough?  You can see what you’re doing, okay?”
Ross was alone in the house apart from his guards.  His wife was out of town visiting their daughter at school.  They had no other children, and Ross was apparently either extraordinarily discreet with his affairs, or the only faithful man in D.C.  Tony hoped it was the latter.  He’d met the man’s wife before, and she was a sweet, humble little thing with big dark eyes and a gentle smile.  She’d reminded him of his own mother, and hoped Ross treated her with more care than Howared had spared.  For her sake, not his.  He may have a nice woman by his side, but Ross was still a dick of epic proportions.
Steve nodded, but he didn't need to. Another part of his body was already letting it be known just how much Steve liked it. How much he wanted it.
Both men jolted.  Steve’s shoulders came up, snapping to attention, his jaw clenched, fire and fear burned in his blue eyes, darkening them.  At the same time, Tony’s fingers flexed, and he found himself on his feet, waiting for the suit to appear around him.  They locked eyes and Tony read his own thoughts on Steve’s face.
Possibly.
“Right.”
Tony shifted against him, screwing up his nerve.  “So, you’re sure you never fooled around a little?”
He nodded. “I’m sure. I feel better, Mom. Really.”
, Steve.”
“‘Kay.”
,” Tony said, and now he was running his hands over Steve’s body. He hadn’t put a shirt on when he got out of the shower. He’d thrown on sweats, but his chest was bare, and Tony’s hands felt like heaven against his skin. “Talk later, okay, baby? Fuck first, talk later.”
“Steve, listen to--”
“Tell you what,” he said, and settled his head on Tony’s stomach. “
head, Steve."
Sam furrowed his brow, but his lips twisted into a weary smile. One that Steve recognized from when they were kids. “
“--which makes me think he’s using your letters as a way to process things in his own mind.”
“More than anything.”
just tasting it now?”
As if sensing he was being left out of the equation, Sir Purr began to twine around Tony’s ankles, meowing and rubbing his face against his jeans.  Steve chuckled softly.  “Somebody’s pissed I’m getting all the attention.”
Tony nodded. Her words and soothing way calmed him more than he thought possible, but he still wanted to get in there. He still wanted--needed--to see him. But he needed to take care of one tiny detail first. One tiny, monumental detail.
He wrapped his hand over the glass cover of the first and turned it on.  Nothing.  “Fuck,” he muttered, and grabbed the other, praying it would work.  He didn’t want to resort to candles.  He repeated the process, covering the end with his hand, and this time when he thumbed the switch, his fingers glowed a fiendish red.  Tony sighed in relief and edged toward the bedroom.
with you, but I don’t want to be without you.”
He grasped her upper arm.  “Honey, honey, please tell me you’re not sleeping together.”
“Is he okay?”
“It has to happen,” Pepper insisted. “He’s a member of the Clean Energy Commission. We need his approval on the reactor tech or-”
. It was hard to feel cold again after Tony had gotten him so used to being warm.
Clint shook his head.  Not saying no, just that he didn't know.  "I think we'd figure that out when the time came."
Tony nodded. Kissed him. “I mean, I might not have wanted to admit it,” he said, and Steve laughed, low and fond. “But I felt it. I always felt it.”
Tony let out a frustrated breath and leaned forward.  “All your fault, huh?”
“Hey,” Steve said, and his eyes were still bright. Even though he was pale, and they were still hollowed and smudged with tired shadows underneath, they were bright when they fell on Tony. “I was just about to come drag you out of bed.”
Tony drew in a deep, sudden breath. He let it out slowly, frowning, while Sam made a visible effort to get himself under control. It didn’t take long. Sam was a man in control of his emotions. Tony had always admired that, especially since it was so different from himself.
“Hi, Nat,” Steve said from the bed.
What if Steve had left his wallet home one day at Starbucks and the handsome, dark-haired stranger behind him in line stepped up and said, "Just put it on my tab," and smiled.  What if, when Steve thanked him, the stranger said, "Thank me by sitting here with me for a minute. I've got a date, but he's late. Keep me company?" What if they talked for hours, the conversation easy and light and fun, and when Steve walked him home, Tony--because, of course, his name was Tony.  What a perfect name was that for a rom-com guy?--held his hand? What if, at Tony's door, Steve said he was glad Tony's date had been late, and then Tony laughed and said, "I didn't really have a date, baby. I just wanted you to stay." And then, what if Tony had kissed him? Would they be here now, if that's the way things had happened?  Would they be together now? Would they be married in every way but the most legal one, and spend every day laughing and arguing, and every night lying together in a tangle of arms, and legs, and exploring fingers, and soft, gentle lips? Would they be what they were to each other?
“You know who
Steve nodded. “I will.”
"No.  I've just been out here.  Waiting."
“Did they help?”
“Really?”
"Are you alright, Mr. Rogers?"
humor, it would have been fine. They all joked around a lot. But no. This was different. This felt like something more. Not just humor, but humor laced with a razor edge of intent. Like he was flirting.
“Right.  Because you beat my ass so hard last time.”
Steve nodded. “Oh. Okay.” But he didn’t move. Neither of them did.
then?"
“Of course, I know.  I know you’d never do that.  I told them all that.”
kill you, Barton.”
think again.”
It was heavy and rich, not some cheap handbill passed out on a street corner.  This had cost somebody some money.  He unfolded it along the creases and squinted at the letterhead, his eyes just barely able to make it out in the starlight:
“Yeah, Tony,” Clint said. “Water is nice. Why don’t we have a pool up here?”
And now he’d never get the chance.
“Come on, troublemaker,” he whispered, and Dodger hopped down from the bed and followed him out the door.
worry, though,” he said against Tony’s lips. “I
feel bad for Howard.  Because as much as the courageous, stalwart, American icon was Steve Rogers, those other things were also him--
He didn’t ask if Tony wanted anything. He always asked if Tony wanted something.
"Hey, you."
“Yeah.”
“I want you to do it again.”
“That’s where your taste and mine differ, Captain.”
Steve smiled, that warm feeling just getting warmer. “I’m glad you stayed with her. It meant a lot to her.”
He felt a flare of irritation, but it burned away quickly as he watched him in the water. It was dark. Steve--of course, it was Steve--had not turned on the pool lights, but there was enough light from the moon above and the city below for Tony to see him, see the way he moved, the way he slipped through the water in a way that was both efficient yet oddly delicate. A dancer more than a competitor. Art more than athletics. He watched him. He watched him and not only was he no longer irritated, he instead felt a wave of deep homesickness for him. For the way they used to be. A wave of longing. Of want. And he found himself moving again toward the pool, or, rather, moving toward the person
“Oh.  Well, maybe you should ask him about it sometime.”
“Come home with us.”
“That’s why I don’t want you to buy me stuff, Tony,” Steve said. “You already gave me something. You gave me a purpose when I didn’t have one. You made me feel like a man again, and not just a weapon. Not...not just an experiment.” He pressed his face into Tony’s shirt. “I hadn’t felt like that in a long time. You gave me that. You want to give me something real?
He’d meant it. Every syllable. He just didn’t realize how soon he might have to actually do it.
Tony dropped Sam off at his place around nine, then drove home feeling really good, replaying the best parts of the day, thinking the only thing that could have made it better was if Steve could have been with them. It was okay, though. He’d call him when he got home. Talk. Tell him about the date he’d had with “the other man”. Ask Steve about his day. Be angry on his behalf about his jerk of a boss, because god knew Steve wouldn’t do it himself. He never did. He needed Tony to do it for him. And he did. He liked doing it. He was good at it.
After breakfast, Sarah excused herself to go to bed. She’d been up for hours and was sore and exhausted. Steve and Tony flipped through a few more pages of the book. They were to a safer stage now--no more naked baby butt cheeks--and Steve talked a little about some of the pictures. About his mom. About his childhood. He didn’t say much about his dad. He’d died when Steve was five. He hadn’t really known him that well.
And Tony was there.
A thousand emotions ran over Steve’s face when he saw him.  Tony watched them all, named as many as he could--apprehension, fear, worry, longing.  He looked for love, but either it wasn’t there, or Steve kept it hidden.
, in fact, that he would.  Not because Steve had anything to prove, but because he wanted the challenge, wanted the fight.  And he knew he’d win.  Because, of course he would.  He would accept nothing less.  Nothing less than perfection on his part and complete surrender on his opponent’s.
“Twice, okay, smartass? We only did it twice.”
He didn’t really talk at the cafe either. The others did, bullshitting about work and kids and life, and Steve listened, just soaking up the camaraderie. When they said good-bye afterward, he walked home slowly, still thinking.
“I love you,” he said into Tony’s hair. “I love you so much.”
“Nothing.”
“Tony?”
He shuffled his feet a little, embarrassed, but oh, so happy.  “Hey, thank you for that.  The protocol?”
“Yeah,” he answered, blushing, “all words.  All civil.”
Tony ran to the door, expensive Italian loafers slipping and sliding in the muck.  They  hadn’t been designed for this kind of thing.  He’d thrown them on because they were easy, and they looked good.  If he’d known he’d be playing “Survivorman” out here in the elements, he would have worn his Timberlands.
laugh.”
feeling had followed them through the door.  It hung around them in a haze, existed between them like a piano wire tuned two octaves too tight.  Tony fancied he could hear Steve’s heart in his chest thumping as crazily as his own. The scent of Skin Bracer was sharp and welcoming.
“Don’t what?”
When he couldn’t get Steve to give in, Tony kissed his way down Steve’s chest, then rested his cheek against it, lying mostly on top of him and said, “Best. Pillow. Ever.”
"No, Stephen," she said, rounding on Strange. "Don't defend him.  You and Tony, you're always defending him. I do not want to hear it!"
“For anybody?” he asked. “Do they do that for anybody, or do they have to find you and recruit you like they’re doing to you?”
“He thinks you’re going to blow me,” Tony said when they were alone in the cell, then added hopefully, “Are you going to blow me?”
He took it out of the box and slid it over his thumb. He ran his finger across the face of it, the polished metal, the smooth wood. God, how he’d wanted to put it on Steve’s finger tonight.
Steve looked up. “Yeah, Mr. Barker?”
Steve dialed up his voicemail, and listened, his face contorting into a curious frown.
“What is it? Can you tell me?”
, but maybe you could come over here? He’s not really talking to anyone right now, but I think he’d feel better if you were here. You might have to convince him of that at first, though. You know how he is.”
knowing about our stuff.”
…Fine.  Alright?  Fine.
Ross eyed him warily.  “And what, exactly, does that mean?”
Steve watched him as he spoke, a look of wry amusement on his face.  “And, uh, when you were coming up with this scenario,” he said, “was the
“This house contains sensitive, top-secret Avengers-related information.  It is essentially an Avengers outpost.”  There was a gleam in his eye as Ross spoke, one that was dark and capering.  “As per our agreement,  you are not allowed in any building that houses Avengers’ material.”
Graduation came and went. Sarah cried. She sat with Sam’s mother, the two women holding hands and crying together. Howard stood in the back. He didn’t cry. Sarah hugged and kissed Steve and Sam, then left them with Sam’s mother and found Tony in the crowd.
“Whatever you say,” Tony said.  He settled his hand on Steve’s cheek, feeling the beard and wishing selfishly that he was feeling Steve’s smooth skin under his palm instead.  “I’ve grown very accustomed to having you around, Steve Rogers.  I don’t think I can do it without you now.”  Tony slid his fingers into Steve’s hair and tugged it affectionately.  “And I know I don’t want to.”
Tony received several texts after that.  They ranged from concerned--Sam--to indecipherable--Clint, which contained nothing but
“One year,” Ross spat.  “You deserved ten.  You and your whole merry little band.  And that little red-headed witch deserved life.  She murdered-”
He got out of bed, honestly not remembering how he’d gotten
Steve nodded.  “Not for a long time, though.”
Tony pulled back. “Turn some music on, baby.”
Steve smiled a dark, knowing smile, then turned around and fiddled with a pile of cassettes. Tony watched him, the flex of his muscles, the smooth curve of his back.
need you to make it.  I’m playing the selfish-card, Steve.  You can’t go because I need you here.”
“True,” Clint said, and Tony blinked at him, surprised but pleased. He hadn’t expected that. “But that’s not what I meant.”
“Of course, they are.  They’ve been ready for a week.”
Steve took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. “I don’t know,” he whispered. “I don’t think I’m sorry I did it. Maybe just that I did it without asking first.” He thought about it, feeling Tony’s eyes on him, waiting and watching, and then nodded. “Yeah. I’m sorry I didn’t ask. Not sorry I did it.”
“‘Night, Morgan,” he said.
Steve nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”
Steve closed his eyes. Rubbed his face. “I love you,” he said.
was waking up. In fact, he could barely believe that he had just spent the last ten minutes practically groping Steve Rogers, and making plans to do...something...with him later tonight. He leaned against the wall. His hand was shaking, threatening the rest of his coffee, but he couldn’t stop it.
He shifted into first and touched the gas pedal.  The ‘Cuda purred forward, growling like a jungle cat.
“‘Kay,” Steve said and leaned close to Bucky, hooking his arm around him. “Help me, Tim,” he said to Dugan, and between the two of them, they wrangled Bucky up onto Steve’s shoulders.
Steve read them, making sure he was alone when he did. He cried when he read them. He always did. It didn’t matter that they were fun letters with Tony’s personality stamped all over them, he still cried. So, he made sure he was alone when he read them. Made sure he tucked them away when he was done, hiding them along with the letters from his mother and Sam, and the Christmas and birthday cards from Mrs. Perkins, deep inside his footlocker, stuffed under a bunch of shit. It seemed ironic--hiding the most precious things in the world to him under things he couldn’t give a fuck about--but he wanted to keep them. He couldn’t stand the thought of throwing them away. It would be like cutting off a piece of his body and tossing it out with the trash.
“Yeah,” Steve said. “When I first...you know...woke up, they kept me pretty busy. Training mostly. With new weapons. Different martial arts disciplines.” He smiled. “And school. Or
“Can’t tell if that’s a yes or a no.”
, Tony thought, and it wasn’t a flippant, throwaway threat. It was a clinical, methodical thought-process.
“Howard,” Tony said, and went down the hall to his room.
, I wouldn’t have even hesitated.”
Oh, god, he’d try.
“Yeah.” He smiled, ducking his head. “Thinking about July. You know? When we come up in July?”
“I’m already paying for it,” Tony said. “What’s another few years?”
“I don’t know, Tony,” he said.
“Sorry, honey. I was talking to Steve.” Tony flicked his hand back and forth between them. “Steve, Josh. Josh, Steve.”
He reached up and laid his hand against Steve’s cheek, his thumb caressing the top of the high cheekbone.  Steve turned his face into Tony’s palm.  Just a little, just enough to feel his breath against his skin.
“Who’s Don Draper?”
He turned his back and started for the door, but a white-hot lance of pain struck the middle of his back.  It was brief but intense.  He fell forward, barely catching himself on his palms, then rolled over onto his back.
Tony came back to the chair.  Steve stiffened when he took the handles but didn’t say anything.  Baby steps.  They went down to the lake and sat for awhile.  Steve sat in his chair and Tony perched on the edge of the dock, his legs swinging a few inches above the water.  They didn’t talk much, but Steve put his hand in Tony’s hair and ran it through his fingers absently.
Josh tightened his grip on Tony. He was holding him in a death-clutch now, but Steve still didn’t mind. His brain was ticking away, showing him how pale Josh was, how hostile his eyes were. Josh was angry. Josh was jealous. Josh was trying to
“Yes. I guess I don’t want to forget you completely.”
Tony lay back and grabbed his cup of coffee. He drank it. It slid down his throat, hot and good, and he swallowed, feeling the warmth of it bloom in his stomach. He looked fine on the outside. He was a master of that. He could look fine even when his insides were lighting up like fireworks. And they were doing exactly that right now. Exploding with his love for his daughter, exhilaration at the thought that she liked Steve so much, euphoria--fucking
“I will.”

he reminded me of you.”
"Okay," Nat said, and sighed.  "Where are you now?"
Morgan jumped up. “Pancakes!” she shouted, and Dodger leapt to his feet and chased her out the door.
“And I loved you.  Me and Steve...  Not until last April, Pepper.  Please believe me.”
“Are you okay?”
Steve huffed a little.  Tony talked about Hermione a lot.  "This Hermione-thing is
Tony nodded again. “I’m sure.”
Kay, that's it!! Thank you all for reading and for the comments. They really do make me happy. I love connecting with you guys! I don't talk much about my writing with anyone outside of this community-don't know why. Just don't-so it's lovely when I get to talk to you all. Anyway, thank you again! See you...soon? Maybe? We'll see!💙💙💙
Christmas lunch was with the parents, after all.
talk, they all listened. When Steve spoke, it was because it was important. And when he made the occasional joke or laughed at something
Tony put a tentative hand on Sam’s shoulder. “What about you?” he asked, chewing his lip. “You’re going. Do I need to make up with you, too?”
Bucky and Natasha were already there, and they swooped Morgan away. Tony let them take her with not another thought. She loved them, and they loved her. Also, he suspected they liked to practice on her. Just to make sure they were comfortable around kids if and when they decided to have one of their own. He was starting to see that look in their eye whenever they looked at Morgan. That look that said they were gearing up to something. And why shouldn’t they? They’d been married for a while now. They loved each other. They loved kids--at least they loved spoiling
“Sounds like a party.”
"I can sit in the back."
“Yeah.”
Tony was not as charmed as Steve had hoped he’d be. “Uh-huh. Love you too. What’s wrong?”
Tony flapped his hand. “Pfft. I’ll find something. I’m resourceful.”
"Cap."
FRIDAY’s voice was stiff, a bit angry when she spoke.  “I tried.  She doesn’t want my help.”  Pause.  “She doesn’t like me.”
Shaking, calloused fingers moved through blond hair, smoothing it back from his brow.  “Hey, soldier,” he whispered.  “Open your eyes for me, huh?”
“I know.”
Steve didn’t say anything, he just looked pointedly at the paper in Tony’s hand.
She hummed, a pleasant vibration against his chest.  "All lumberjacks are inherently sexy, Steve.  I shouldn't have to say it."
salad, Bruce. It’s just what you eat when the doctor tells you to lower your cholesterol.”
Steve pulled him closer again.  Put his head on his chest.  Tony ran his fingers through his hair, knowing he’d never be able to get enough of it.  Never be able to get enough of Steve’s warmth, his softness, his sweetness, his stubbornness, his anger, his passion, his calm, his brooding, his love.  He could fill his every second with Steve for the rest of his life, the rest of his eternity, and it would still never be enough.
Tony nodded. “It is.”
“Yes, angel,” he said, quietly.
“...’Kay.”
“That’s true.”
Steve laughed low in his throat.  "Yeah, well, you can service me anytime you want."
Steve glanced down at himself, his t-shirt and blue pajama bottoms.  His bare feet.  He needed a shower.  And a shave.  But, he supposed, he could do that at home.
“Captain Rogers?”
Sam nodded at Sarah. “What she said.”
“Wow,” Steve said breathlessly, when he pulled away.  “God, what was
“Baby?”
Steve forgot about his probably-failed pop quiz.
and he lifted his head a little, searching for them, squinting through the dust, his ears ringing but hearing something else anyway. Something loud and piercing, like Mrs. Perkins’s teapot, but more
“Don’t call me that!” Steve shouted, and leapt forward.  As he came, he swung his arm in a short, hard arc, and it was only when the headlights caught on the blade, that Tony realized the thing he’d been holding was his razor.
“Hey.  Hi.”
“How long was I in there?” he asked.
,” he whispered as Steve’s tongue swept across his skin, his breath cooling the slight dampness left in its wake before fire took its place. It was a strange thing, feeling that combination of sensations, so soft and hot and then the scrape of his teeth running gently over the spot. Tony felt his knees weaken a bit, and he was glad Steve’s arms were around him, glad he was holding him up, or he definitely would have fallen.
She bit her lip, trying not to laugh again.  “No, he didn’t ‘like you for a while’, Tony.  He was in love with you.  For years.”  She bumped his shoulder and repeated emphatically, “
“Okay.”
Steve felt the bed dip as Tony knelt on the mattress behind him, then the warmth of him as he pressed against his back. “You know, I had an entirely different scenario in mind for this,” Tony whispered, his breath tickling Steve’s ear. “But…” Steve inhaled sharply as the silk slipped around his neck. “But I think you might need it tonight.” Tony kissed the lobe of his ear. “What are your thoughts on that, baby?” he asked. “Do you want to try?”
be.  I don’t deserve you yet, Tony, I know that, but once I’m out of here, I swear to you I’m going to spend every day trying to.  Okay?  If you’ll let me?”
She curled up on her side and pulled the blanket up to her chin.  “Don’t worry, if we ever see him again, I’ll be sure to tell him you played his wing-man.”
“-you’re right.”
“No, I know.  Me neither.”
Tony stared after him, then reached out and picked up the can of Coke Steve had abandoned on the table. It was still half full. He held it in his hand, then looked at Clint. He looked as miserable as Tony felt.
but smile. “You’re supposed to be taking some time, Rogers. This is a no-contact mission. You don’t need to be ‘kept in the loop’ on everything.”
Steve smiled.  Looks could be deceiving.  “She was,” he said, “except when she was telling me to move my ass or shooting at me.”
“‘Kay.”  He curled his hand into Tony’s shirt.  Maybe that was silly, but it was a comfort to him.  Like a security blanket.  He wondered sometimes if maybe he and Tony were a little co-dependent.  If it was a little weird how much they seemed to need each other around.  How much they touched and kissed and thought about each other.  But then Tony would look at him and smile and then he wouldn’t wonder again for awhile.  He'd just enjoy being with him.  And besides, what was wrong with a little dependency?  “Goodnight, Tony.  I love you.”
“You don’t have to. It’s not like I’ll be charging you rent.”
“You guys should probably just go without me.”
“I want to bring our friends home,” she said, at last.
a fugitive,” Steve said.  “I served my time.”
“Okay,” she said, and pulled him down to hug him fiercely. He let her, putting his own free arm around her waist, hugging her just as tightly. He kept holding Tony’s hand, though. He didn’t let go, even though the hug went on for a long time--a very long time, even by her standards.
“Is it guys in general?” Tony went on, still holding Steve’s shirt. “Or is it just me you don’t like?”
Tony blinked.  This was happening very fast and if he wasn’t so happy, he would be a little irked at the way Strange had taken his plan and manipulated it into his own.  He’d even gotten Wanda here again.  On Tony’s jet.  And made sure she was set up in Tony’s home for the night.  Tony didn’t begrudge Wanda one bit.  He just wished he had been the one to set all this up for her.  Now that he and Steve were truly together, Tony wanted to get to know her a little more.  If she was Steve’s pseudo-daughter, that almost made her Tony’s pseudo-step-daughter, and he wanted her to like him.  And not pseudo-like him.
He did try to look away when the priest said “Til death do you part”, but he couldn’t do that either.
She smiled, and it brightened up the room. Tony heard Steve let out a soft breath. It sounded like pure relief, and that put Tony at ease too. “No,” she said, squeezing his hand in a friendly way. “You’re him. I can tell.” She pulled him closer by their clasped hands and kissed first his left cheek, then the right. “Happy birthday.”
“Like a father.”
“What are you doing?” he finally asked, as Tony moved on to his hands, touching each finger in turn, going from knuckle to nail, then turning each to inspect his palms.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t know. This, I guess. Us. All of us.”
ridiculous?  Perhaps the news about Steve was too much, but what about just calling her?  Just talking to her?  He missed her, missed her poised, polished, steady presence.  Would it be cruel to call her after leaving her to be with Steve?  He didn’t want to be cruel, but…
Pool goes in just in time for a midnight swim!
Steve raised his hand and brushed the back of it along Tony’s jaw.  Tony took it in his own and held it against his cheek, taking in the sensation of his touch, memorizing it, burning it into his mind, into his heart.
“Um. Sorry?”
“Let him in, Tony.”
“I’m never gonna get tired of saying it either. Now that I can.”
“I’m sorry, FRI,” he said.
She looked back at him and shook him a little by his jacket.  “But
here.” He turned back to Steve, a complicated look in his eyes. They were surprised, hurt, and something else. Something that looked hopeful--almost hungry. “What is he doing here?”
“You okay?” Steve mumbled, as Tony wrapped himself up in his warm embrace.
“I mean it, sweetheart. Anytime.”
Pietro laughed a little. “You’re still in the army, honey.”
“Yeah.”
“And you’d be okay with that?”
Tony had watched him use that shield in combat hundreds of times, had watched him wield a god’s weapon in Stormbreaker, and had always been in awe of his confidence with it.  It was only now, watching the way he handled the razor, that Tony realized it had been more than mere confidence--it was almost arrogance.  As if he were willingly tempting the devil himself and didn’t give a fuck if he fought back.  Was
Tony sighed.  “Yeah.”
“I’ll stall them.”
“Yeah. He’ll be a soldier, Tony. They’ll send him into dangerous situations.” He paused. “He could get hurt. Or-”
