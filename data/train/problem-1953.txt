“Everything’s fine” John shrugged “Bill and Mike are fine, helpful as ever, Sherlock’s sister, Eurus is a wonderful friend, so are Molly and Greg, the police officer that works with Sherlock” John continued talking “Sherlock’s parents are a great help, they take care of Rosie every single day, and now we have Mrs. Hudson, the landlady” He explained “As school goes, I’m doing great, keeping my scores and my scholarship, just been offered to be the captain of the rugby team, and received a letter from the RAMC, telling me that my practices have been programmed in the next couple of years at Sierra Leone” He did a quick recount of his life.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and continued walking, his mind lost in those eyes once again. He thought about the information he had gathered on the man. Nineteen; second year Med Student at Bart’s, ace grades through school, rugby captain, got the championship for his team three years in a row -and looked sinful in those white trousers- interested in military formation, had applied to RAMC, was accepted and was supposed to go to training but had asked for a licence to be married. Now his military career was on stand-by because he’s a single parent now. And those eyes… He opened the door and took a deep breath, put his phone to the side and picked his books for the afternoon lecture. Maybe a little distance could help…
“How far?” John asked with a husky voice.
“I can’t” Sherlock tried to articulate… something… the words jumbling in his mind. He took a deep breath and tried again “I can’t keep doing this back and forth… I need to know…” His breath hitched when he felt John’s hand reach for his
Memories flood my mind, so many memories!
“She’s family” Violet had told him when she came for Rosie early the next morning “We can keep her whenever you need to study or to rest. We just love her” She had smiled at him as she held the baby close to her chest. Even though he felt a little conflicted, all he wanted was for Rosie to be happy.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a brief second. Eurus was still there and he hadn’t answered to her, the memories came rushing back again
“I’m sorry” Mary was crying too, her heart breaking at the sight of her friend’s suffering
"Please, God, let me live."
“Piss off” Sherlock looked up and John started laughing
“How is she?” Sherlock asked once he sat and nodded at the baby.
“Haven’t seen you for a while” Mike protested jokingly and John half smiled.
“I’m already done with my lab hours for the term” Sherlock said “If I take advantage of the Saturdays you have lectures I could finish my graduation project in less than a month” He argued, not heatedly but strongly “Besides, most of my lectures are boring” He jutted his lower lip and looked like a five year old having a strop.
“Great, thanks!” John let out a relieved huff “Be there at four” he finished the call and went to look for his daughter. This morning, he had left her with the Morstans, but Rosamund found it very hard to take care of the little baby and generally after a couple of hours, John was forced to pick her up, take her with him to lectures or call favours from friends and family. Thankfully, he had forged great relationships with his fellow students and with his teachers, and Rosie had charmed her way to everyone’s heart.
The last thing I remember is being at Socrates' trial. Sad day for many of us, a true teacher...
The reason behind his enthusiasm was that he was chosen, amongst many, to become the Great Dane, the prince himself, Hamlet. He was overjoyed and began practicing day and night. After this particular performance, he chose to stay a couple more years in University and get another degree in English Literature from the University of London, so he could participate in the London theatre scene. Mycroft wasn’t happy, he was afraid Sherlock might relapse, but he had to admit that since his brother joined the club he was more… manageable… He decided to test his brother and refused to pay his tuition fee, which led us to today and Sherlock performing for a bunch of strangers “a salacious”- Mummy had called it- play… It was “Sweet Charity” and Sherlock loved it.
“Then he left with someone in a black car and haven’t heard of him since. That’ll be about twenty minutes now” John looked at his phone and scowled at it. He left the unopened bottle over the kitchen counter.
“How do you take care of a baby?” He asked at the edge of tears.
I mean, how can we just
“See us again” Henry Watson asked, quite confused by the affirmation.
“April eighth” Sherlock shrugged.
“Thanks” John said to Angelo’s back. “Okay” John said as soon as they ordered “Something to tell me?” He smiled in just that reassuring way Sherlock loves so much.
He climbed the stairs back to their flat, still holding the screaming baby and going nuts about him crying, he cradled him and rocked him while going up the stairs until he decided to play his violin for his son,
“We only have a week, Watson! Captain!” Bill hauled him to the train station. And so it began…
Very slowly, very softly, he got Sherlock ready, arousing him enough to keep the experience pleasurable but not enough to have him come before everything started; one finger, then two, then three; in, out, in, out, slowly, softly, getting the most arousing sounds from Sherlock’s mouth, Everything was silent except for the sounds Sherlock was making, turning John on, more and more with each passing second.
“I’m sorry” John thought of a fast excuse, “I’ve been busy” He lied and berated himself for not admitting he was hurt.
“With Sherlock’s parents for the day” John continued loading the car and clearly heard his mother’s sharp breath intake.
That was it for John; he pushed past Sherlock and left the room, only to stand in the hallway remembering he was locked in the flat… He turned back and Sherlock was standing there, dark and sad eyes fixed on him, as if waiting for something… anything, really… to happen… John sagged his shoulders and crossed his arms over his chest. He knew Sherlock was right, but at the same time there were many things they hadn’t talked, they hadn’t cleared… Sure, Sherlock was right, but at the same time, John had all the right to feel the way he felt… He rested his head on the wall and looked up… Sherlock was still there
How was he going to tell James? He was supposed to help her, nothing more. James had told him to apologise, accept the blame, claim to be the father, assure the family he’ll help Mary in every way possible, promise to be there for her, even give the baby his name and nothing more; marriage was not in the cards, he had just… up the ante… John couldn’t even breathe properly, but he had made his bed and now he had to lay in it.  He scrubbed his face with his hands and when Alex patted his shoulder and said “Welcome to the family, son” all he could do was nod and shake his head, completely lost for words or even a proper reaction.
"Dunno." Sherlock shrugs in that way he has when he's unsure of something but wants to pass as nonchalant. I keep typing our latest case and he snorts as soon as he reads the tenth "brilliant" in my recount of the facts.
“And Rosie?”
, along with
“There is one thing you need to know, John” Violet smiled at him and shook her head when John tried to give her the money they had spent “Our son” Siger grabbed her hand “Is… difficult” She licked her lips “But since he met you, even before you became friends, well…”
“I’ll have to bring John first, but I’m sure he’ll love the place” Sherlock took another bite of his cake and watched as Mrs. Hudson pulled another tin of biscuits out of the oven for him.
“I will love you forever” He answered and looked at him, before reaching for his lips again.
“Why?” Sherlock was seething, his voice a whisper
“Not angry” John clipped and realised too late that he had answered angrily.
“Tell him it's done" he let out a sad sigh, picked his bag up and closed the door to his life
“Oh, I will” She laughed a bit wickedly and Sherlock just shook his head. “Have you told him you’re out of university?”
So… No sex?” Mike was astounded
“I’m going to Belgravia” Sherlock pointed behind him “You’re going to Barbican” He shifted on his feet “I’ll take the next one” He attempted a smile but failed. He was waiting for John’s answer when he saw the inconspicuous black car approaching the kerb and tried not to scowl.
-both shared the same thought at the same moment-
The build-up was there, growing steadily with each movement, until John hit that sweet spot and Sherlock arched his back, a low cry of pleasure leaving his lips that spurred John to move faster and thrust even deeper, hitching Sherlock’s leg up his waist with his arm and moving in him with the need to consume Sherlock until they were fused into one being, wanting to climb inside him and never leave him, wanting to make this moment last for ever.
He felt a few tears run down his cheeks, unable to look up, looking for a pulse and knowing he’ll never find it. She looked pale and rather beautiful, something akin of a smile over her lips, maybe the certainty, even in death; that John will be there for their daughter. Time started again when he looked up and saw all the pale faces surrounding him, Rosie’s cries brought him back to reality and he walked to his brother and held his baby daughter to his chest; at that very moment he realised little Rosie had just lost her mother and they were alone, he was in charge of a baby that wasn’t his but that was his in every sense of the word; she is Rosie Watson, daughter of John Watson, in less than 90 seconds he became a single parent.
Mary felt her life was on track again, she and John had created a routine, he’ll come from school or work and they’ll share a meal, she’ll help him studying and updating charts, John would be there for her when she complained -more like bitched- about David not being there and putting them in this position, and Mary would be there for John when he ran into James at University.
Sherlock shook his head but looked at his phone fondly.
By three he had eaten half a cake and a tin of biscuits and gathered all the information he needed; he prepared an envelope and was right on time to send it by mail to Mrs. Hudson’s lawyer, all the evidence against her husband contained within. As soon as he left the post office he resumed walking towards the yard, his mind on the case; he couldn’t believe how unbelievably idiotic the members of the yard were.
. He smirked at the stranger.
“You did?” Sherlock beamed.
“I see” Julia sniffed and looked away from John’s piercing gaze “Is he…” She waved to the flat; John just nodded “May I?” She bit her lower lip and looked at the door, asking for permission; John shook his head “Why?”
John grabbed Sherlock’s waist and pushed the door closed with his foot while he kissed the young man passionately, his hands wandered over his body, relishing on the feeling of those firm abs and that sweet arse he had seen and craved for what seemed aeons, but were just a couple weeks.
“I’ll get a candle for the table. It’s more romantic” Angelo left them to choose. When he returned with the candle John looked up, trying not to laugh at the smiling man that was sending Sherlock knowing looks and concentrated on the menu.
It was too much sometimes. Rosie a constant reminder of Mary, Mycroft a ghost that lingered in every corner whenever he caught a glimpse of a camera moving, his in-laws, the people he never really got to meet, the nightmares about the girl on the bus that ended up being Euros… And Sherlock, bless him… the man that had given everything up just to make John happy
“She did?” Sherlock opened his eyes and grabbed his tea cup, downing the lukewarm beverage in one go.
“I noticed he lied a couple of times” John bit his upper lip “Did you notice Eurus looking at him every time he said a lie?”
“I’m here, I’m yours. Are you mine?” Sherlock’s voice was so small and John had to open his eyes again
“Are you ready?” Greg asked. He no longer looked as sad as he did a few months ago, he was dating Molly now; she had managed to take care of him, to bring him back to life after… John nodded and smiled at his friend “He’s waiting” Greg nodded to the door and John took a deep breath and fixed his tie for the last time
The police and the ambulance arrived promptly eight minutes after John called. The recently appointed Sergeant Gregory Lestrade, John remembered his name from almost a year ago when Mary had mentioned him as the copper that took her home after James… He took a deep breath and looked at the team, photographing the scene, checking the window and the door, looking at her destroyed dress… Another deep breath and the squealing baby brought him back, He shushed Rosie and heard a deep baritone voice approaching “Come, Molly, Lestrade’s here” The voice said and John looked up right in time to find the most beautiful creature he had ever laid eyes on. He was thin, a bit lanky, maybe sixteen or seventeen, lithe body, raven curls on his head and viridian eyes, his pale skin glittered under the sun light coming from the tinted windows, which gave him an ethereal, almost divine look.
“Great, so great” John’s smile went from wide to impossibly wider and Mike just chuckled, he hadn’t seen John this happy since… well… ever…
“Just finished exams today” Sherlock returned the kisses and held John close.
“Maybe it was someone he knew” Mike grabbed the bottle and opened it, drinking some. John just shrugged.
FUNNY?
That night, Mycroft debugged their bedroom.
While he was with his mother Molly called. She had called him several times but John was angry; she had left his daughter alone with a stranger, a very attractive, sweet, lovely… OH GOD! Amazing, wonderful, incredible… stranger… a beautiful stranger. John sighed and answered, trying his best not to shout at his friend “What?” He barely managed with some grace.
Once she calmed down enough John made her look up “How?” He asked and she understood the whole meaning of the question. She would tell her parents that John was the father; after much consideration she couldn’t think of a better father for her baby, he was sweet, loving, caring, and she knew, somehow, he’ll be there for them, as a father figure for the baby and as a loving and caring friend for her. Mary knew John Watson was the perfect guy-to-go, the one to “blame” for the “little bundle of joy” that was currently growing and residing in her belly.
“House in Sussex and the “lordship” that accompanies it” Sherlock blushed “We’ve inherited a few titles too, my father had a lot of siblings, not many cousins though” Sherlock shrugged, Sherlock had inherited his grandfather’s title, Mycroft had inherited uncle Rudi’s and Eurus held Mamie’s “This is me” Sherlock glanced over at John, briefly, his face said it all, he couldn’t believe it.
- but have shared a bed several times; he could be the man his brother needed, but Mycroft had to be sure; he had to be sure he wouldn’t be leaving at short notice, that he will choose his bother over his duty, although evidence suggested he was even willing to have his heart broken if he needed to do what he considered the right thing.
“I’m curious about Jim” He said “He lied to all of us but was perfectly honest with my sister; is as if they are playing a game and we’re the ones that should loose” Sherlock continued talking, eyes closed, as if remembering the afternoon “I find it hard to trust him, but at the same time I can’t find reasons not to” He huffed “I should call Mycroft and ask”
“Holmes” Sherlock could help but laugh “Sherlock Holmes” he kissed John passionately again “Hungry?” Sherlock panted.
“I’ve also been accepted at King’s for the Forensics’ programme” Sherlock continued “Getting the doctorate there; I’ll study for the next couple of years and get both the forensics and chemistry” John nodded, baffled “Mrs. Hudson is waiting for me at the flat over Baker, already moved a few things” He bit his lower lip, John knew he was pondering about…something “I also got this” He handed John the envelope “Mycroft gave it to me yesterday” He looked down and waited.
“There, there” he tried between bursts of laughter “We knew this was coming, sooner or later” he patted Bill’s shoulder “They grow up so fast” He sniffed and continued laughing.
“Please what?” John took a step back and tried to find the reason behind the anger that had disappeared as suddenly as it appeared “Let’s be friends?” He chuckled humourlessly “Forgive you?” He rolled his eyes and clicked his tongue “Don’t worry” John shook his head and took another step back “Be happy with your fiancé” He turned and left a baffled James gaping. It took James ten more minutes to realise he had a ring on his ring finger and that it had a VT engraved on it.
“What?” He looked at him and thanked the heavens that they started with seemingly small talk “Being a single parent, losing my best friend, or having to take care of a little baby?”
But there are those eye...
John realised how much he loved Sherlock the night he arrived, watching him taking such care of a baby that wasn’t his -or John for that matter- melted his heart; he was about to utter the three words but managed, somehow, to contain himself and wait, even though all he wanted was to yell it to the wind.
And that is how it all began… Many ups and downs later they were finally there, facing each other, bare to the soul. They finally talked to each other. Sherlock told John all about his two years away, his reasons to leave, his reasons to love Mary almost as much as John loved her; how much he loved Rosie, how guilty he felt for taunting Norbury, how his mind stopped functioning from then on, how he lost his mind. He apologised repeatedly, even though John told him to stop.
“What about you?”
The case was easy, in the Sherlockian scale of cases it was a five, and all they had to do was check facts. Greg, already used to the rapid-fire deductions Sherlock made, had his team assembled in such a way that every single one of them knew when to step away; that is, except green Sally Donovan and the new Forensic specialist, Philip Anderson.
“Bring her, it's fine” Greg let out a deep breath, his plan could be ruined by the baby, but if he was right, Sherlock might be on board with the baby.
and handed it to his daughter. The little girl squealed happily and returned to her playing while Sherlock kept trying to shush and calm his son down.
“Besides, Mary invited him to make him feel guilty for leaving John” Molly continued to chit chat and Sherlock forced himself to pay attention “He acted like a real prick” Molly blushed at the word and Sherlock attempted a half smile, watching people pass by their table.
“It’s all fine, Pa” He chuckled and continued watching the way Rosie interacted with Sherlock.
“Oh, you freak!” Donovan shouted and Anderson walked closer to Sherlock.
and is allowed to study medicine. The Legio VII campaigned over Gaul and served Caesar during the entire Gallic Wars. Marcus climbed ranks, finally becoming a Centurion and a Medicus, specialised in combat surgery.
He hit send and watched the city pass by… His phone started ringing it was John, but Sherlock didn’t answer… The cab did a turn and there he was, John Watson in the flesh, leaving the surgery… To his bad luck, the cab stopped and John spotted him, he climbed in the car and Sherlock groaned
Molly pretended to receive a visit from Sherlock while babysitting Rosie and having John picking her up at the same time.
"...if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody’s best friend. Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing... I am a ridiculous man... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship."
He went out, walking his anger off… He ended up back at the train station, he could just go back to London, but what would he do until midnight? No, he was not going back to that room, to Bill and the gang, to the desperate teenager that screamed bloody murder while he fucked her… he needed to take a break from the nonsense, the drunkenness, the fucking…
Things were going smoothly, but the work load increased the more John got involved at the hospital and the more Sherlock helped Lestrade with cases. They created a routine for those days; John managed a schedule that permitted him be with his little family for several hours every single day, and Sherlock would try not to work on fresh cases when he was in charge of Rosie. They both had agreed not to leave Rosie more time than necessary with their parents, they accepted their help whenever it was offered, but tried to parent their daughter as much as possible.
They walked to Baker Street, John didn’t even notice, so enthralled in Sherlock that when they reached Baker Street he looked at the door and was surprised to see the black door in front of him. A lady came out to receive them, slightly older than his mother, maybe over fifty, but with a beautiful smile directed at Sherlock.
Mycroft texted him several times, but Sherlock just answered when it was required and necessary. He hated the way Mycroft worried about him, but he understood why he was that way. After Victor, Mycroft had turned feral, even threatening to kill the young man. Eurus had stopped him and made him understand that somehow, Sherlock needed to learn through heart break. Mummy and Eurus called him, Eurus knew all about John and Sherlock was glad he could talk to her. Eurus had chosen going to Cambridge instead of Oxford and they were too far away, but they managed to communicate every day vial e-mail, texts and calls.
Neither could sleep, too excited about their meeting. John finished his reading and was up before sun rise. He had a lecture in the morning and Molly had offered to take care of Rosie for the time being.
So... I had a bit of time in my hectic day. Working twenty one days in a row is killing me!!! But I do hope you enjoy this chapter and forgive my many mistakes. Thank you for reading and Happy Sherlock!
The anticipation…
“She’s four months old, of course she behaved” Sherlock scoffed “And she is fine” He said, more gently when John turned to look at him “I called my mum and she helped me with her for about an hour” He looked down and blushed the cutest shade of cherry red.
The day of the wedding John was there, holding HIS baby girl and waiting for Mary, his friends, including Victor and his new boyfriend, James -that was one awkward and quite hurtful encounter in their six degrees of separation- were waiting inside the church. Molly was there, her date was smoking a cigarette and he couldn’t see him quite clearly, he smiled at her and Molly returned the smile.
The kiss deepened, tongues battling for entrance, for the first taste of what was craved for so long, shivers running down spines, hands grasping for whatever felt real, jumpers, shirts, skin, bones, hair, hips, fingers, hands… The kisses turned into hunger, in a need that not one of them had ever known before, bodies where pushed through different spaces until those bodies, consumed with hunger and love, fell in the nearest bed they could find.
“Six months ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking” Sherlock smiled lopsidedly and Angelo beamed at him.
At seventeen, a day after his birthday, he finally came out to his parents; he had kept James a secret for almost a year, but it was time to face the music.
"It would seem so." My eyes are still focused on the memory.
He even endured John punching him for coming back, then making him his best man, watching him trying to get off with every woman he saw… but what made him feel the guiltiest was having a romantic relationship with John, entering into an apparently loving relationship with the love of his life…
“No, Sherlock, please” John hurried “I’m sorry, I was angry. I had so many plans” He said and sighed sadly.
To say Sherlock was less than enthusiastic was the understatement of the year, but for his friend, and mostly because he wanted for them to become more, he agreed. By the end of his Hilary he was as enthusiastic about theatre as he was about chemistry; he got to dance, which he loved, he got to perform and pretend, and even he got to perfect his characters.
“Yeah” Sherlock sat next to him and they waited for the waiter in silence. Sherlock didn’t want any interruptions, like last night. They ordered and settled more comfortably before Sherlock started speaking “I’ve finished university, graduation will be in July, after your birthday” Sherlock chastised himself; he wasn’t supposed to know that.
“I think he asked me to move in with him tomorrow” John muttered as he made his way to the fridge to grab a cold one.
“So?” John tried to sound nonchalant.
“Before you go to sleep, say a little prayer” He scoffed again and rocked Hamish softly.
“As long as Sherlock needs to… I’m not doing what that fucker did” He huffed angrily “He was his friend when they were young, since they were five, he was supposed to be in love with Sherlock, but he made a bet with some idiots and started a relationship with Sherlock just to fuck him over and then dump him…” John could barely breathe, his anger rising “I’m not risking our relationship because my balls are blue” That made Bill and Mike laugh out loud “Besides, when it happens, I’m not telling you, those days are over” He grinned wickedly.
But something is different...
Sherlock’s mind was lost in the memory, his eyes wandering over it. He forced himself to listen to what his sister was saying while his fingers danced over the violin strings
Sherlock arrived just in time to Paddington to catch the 12 o’ clock to Oxford. Mycroft texted him but Sherlock ignored the text, at least for the time being, and occupied himself with researching more about John Watson. He should be checking the assignments his teacher sent him, but his mind was too preoccupied with the ash blond, with the blue eyes and sturdy body to think about anything else. He found himself wanting to hear his voice again, feel his hands over his body, kissing him…
The amount of cigarettes consumed by Sherlock the weeks after Victor, had Mycroft biting his nails, he was desperate to find a way to help his brother, but thankfully for him, it appeared in the form of Irene Adler, which became, unknowingly -and probably unwillingly- the anchor that kept his brother afloat. They had met during Sherlock’s first year and she was the only constant his brother had during his early Oxford years.
“Eighteen” John puffed his chest with pride.
“Nice girlfriend” John answered shortly, his face blushed as he tried to contain his anger and jealousy.
Titus turns five the day they arrive to
“Marry me.” John said and watched as Sherlock’s face went through a myriad of emotions at the same time, from joy to utter disbelief, followed by shock and then realisation, all within a few seconds. Sherlock stood quietly, not saying a word, looking like a deer in headlights, John worried; it seemed that he wasn’t even breathing.
"We lived long lives," my John resurfaces from the memory and reaches for my hand, kissing every finger reverentially. I know he can see the disgust on my face.
I was in Egypt then, the year Socrates died, 399 B.C. I have a faint memory of blinding pain in my chest -I guess it was the loss of my future mother- I couldn't breathe for almost a minute, but once it was over I turned back to my papyrus.
By four, he arrived to Chester Square and saw the three story house and was baffled by it. He somehow knew that Sherlock was a posh man but never imagined him having such a nice house in one of the poshest neighbourhoods in London. He rang the bell and his breath caught in his throat when Sherlock, in absolute disarray but as handsome as ever, opened the door and gave him a relieved smile. His dress shirt was stained with baby spit, his trousers, otherwise perfectly ironed looked creased and dirty with baby formula, his hair resembled a black nest of curls recently abandoned because it had been blown by a nuclear bomb. He had never looked more gorgeous to John.
After they put Rosie for her afternoon nap, they finished with the rest of the flat, placing books on the bookcase, finishing the kitchen and babyproofing the entire flat. One by one their friends left them, the last ones to leave Eurus and Jim. Sherlock was intrigued by the man, he found it hard to like or dislike him, but he had to admit his sister seemed happy; he just hoped he was a good man. They shared a few words and Sherlock noticed he was quite clever, his dark humour made him even more interesting. Sherlock tried to read him, the real him, but there were too many signals that he was pretending for the sake of being accepted.
“John” Sherlock took a deep breath
Three weeks later, after a very intense meeting between their parents, Mary and John’s wedding was planned. It will take place three months after the baby’s birth, January 29th, just because that was the next available date they could find, and mostly because Mary turned 18 a month before the baby arrived. They agreed and helped in every way they could while juggling with school, university and a part time job, John had medical school and a small surgery where he helped with patient charts while Mary finished sixth form and a teller job in a bank. For one, she was glad that people would not be able to notice, much, her pregnancy; having a “Valentine’s Day baby” wasn’t precisely how she wanted to be remembered.
“Yes” Sherlock breathed over John’s lips
Well...
Three weeks later, John was in private plane with Rosie going to France. Paris is as beautiful as John imagined, but it turned into something breath taking the moment he laid eyes on Sherlock. He looked more ethereal than ever, the blue scarf around his neck made his pale complexion look even more marmoreal than ever, his eyes seemed as deep as the ocean, and his lips more red than ever. John forgot how to breathe and berated himself for being angry to this wonderful creature for something out of his control.
“You did” John said to Sherlock's shirt and barely held a sob
“Fuck” John exhaled “And this deed here?”
As every first things usually happen, an accidental bump, a stumble and a hand around another, had them holding hands for the first time. The sensation was like nothing either one had ever experienced. The shivers that ran down Sherlock spine felt like electricity; the butterflies flying around John’s stomach made him feel giddy and happy, unable to stop smiling. It wasn’t the first time either had been in love, but it was the first time being in love was this amazing, comforting, safe…
Vivienne, always the perceptive one in her marriage, promptly picked up on her grandson mood and took him away after the third day of watching him fade away. They went to check the covered garden, the first spring sprouts and the first bees collecting pollen from the first spring flowers.
“Hello beautiful” his mother picked Rosie from Sherlock’s arms and coddled her, the baby gurgled and Sherlock reached for her again, Violet obliging her son and handing the baby back “And where is your friend?” His mother asked with that know-it-all tone of voice only she had.
The spell was broken when one of his regulars came and paid Phares for the night. The stranger left, and he couldn't even see his face...
Didn't you know? Soulmates can lose one another, but this happens ever since one soul "killed" the other. Heard of "Cain and Abel"? Different names depending on language and belief system... Which is why I call the dawning of humanity a catastrophe. As soul-kind goes, we souls have a way of doing things, as I said...wrote...?
In the meantime, Sherlock and John raised Rosie, created a routine that worked for them as a little family that was growing together. Being so young they didn’t have much rush to live their lives, they wanted to grow together. Their routine consisted on Rosie waking them up early in the morning, they both getting her ready, whenever time gave them the opportunity; that is when John didn’t have a night shift or Sherlock hadn’t been working on a case. Having breakfast together, no matter how tired they were or how much John wanted to sleep or Sherlock to keep working, they’ll have breakfast with Rosie. After breakfast a quick clean up, followed by Sherlock filling charts about her progress and John taking photos for the baby album.
“Hello, freak” Sally entered the room and looked at Sherlock with disdain “Why are you here?”
“I’m done” Sherlock huffed after an hour of silence
John removed his fingers from Sherlock and prepared himself, he was ready to come, so he took a few steadying breaths and thought about dead bodies, infectious diseases, terminal illnesses, as he covered his length with lube. He managed to keep his eyes open as he entered Sherlock, looking down at that gorgeous face contort with pleasure. The first breach left Sherlock breathless and John stopped himself from thrusting deep and fast, letting Sherlock adjust to the sensation.
Titus sees the blond head walk away and a lost memory of a beach day invades his mind.
“I don’t want to start something that might finish without me there” Sherlock whispered.
“Over dinner?” John asked and Sherlock nodded “Chinese?”
“I should kill Gavin” Sherlock shook his head but couldn’t help smiling.
After the first show, and from then on, John sent flowers to his dressing room, he already knew his name, Mike had told him “The one to the right” and he pointed at the brunette “is… something else” Mike chuckled “His name is Sherlock and I met him at the lab in the hospital, he’s been working with the police” That piqued John’s interest even more “He’s a chemist” Mike continued and John half heard what he had to say, too lost in the movements he was making.
“Sherlock?” John whispered again, his hand going up Sherlock’s arm. He expected the detective to bolt, to run away from him, to say that this was stupid, but this time, he was the one left struck dumb. Sherlock looked at him, cocked his head to the side, picked the bottle of wine and took three long sip  before setting it down with a light thud and he approached John, grabbed his face in his hands and gave him the most amazing kiss the doctor, and even the soldier, had ever received “Is that a yes?” John asked when he could breathe again.
“Boring” Sherlock shrugged and stopped, making John halt and turn to look at him questioningly. “I have to tell you something” Sherlock looked at John in that intense way that made John squirm. John closed his eyes, preparing for the worst when he felt Sherlock’s hand on his cheek, caressing softly, urging him, silently, to open his eyes again “Nothing too bad, don’t worry” Sherlock smiled softly and John took a deep breath.
“Too thin” John mumbled against his lips, running a hand over his bare back before kissing him heatedly again
“What do people normally say?” John smirked.
The file was accompanied by a full blood work, a letter from the army saying that if he was called he wouldn’t be deployed to any dangerous regions -(under MI6-MH-001-Q-003-007/1 request)- and Sherlock and his daughter would be able to go with him during his deployments, provided that Sherlock would marry him- his school transcripts, from primary school to his last exams taken the day prior. According to the many hours of recording he had been faithful to Sherlock, even before they started a relationship, good friend, good father, good student, good worker; his payments were made every day the same day, on the hour, he worked as much as needed and was serious about his career and his loans; he had decided to move with Sherlock before finding out about the money.
“It was nice watching you sleep” Sherlock smiled fondly at John “You look really relaxed” He bit his lower lip, eyes downcast “But I think I should let you rest after this feeding” Sherlock looked at John as if hoping he would say no.
He usually tried not to giggle when the chosen man’s eyes popped almost out of their orbits when he winked and wiggled his arse in an enticing way.
He gave Sherlock a quick kiss on the nape of his next, watched him stir, heard him mumble something and continue sleeping. He rushed up the stairs and found Rosie sitting calmly on her cot, with her bee in her tiny hand, waving it and making buzzing sounds. He smiled fondly at his little girl, she had learned so much in the last couple of months being with the Holmes. When Rosie squealed and clapped her hands John noticed Sherlock was standing behind him, watching them both.
Hanno is running, his lungs are on fire but he keeps on running. His legs are leading him closer to the shore and he just follows, without a second thought. In the distance, he sees two men, one is the famous Malchus; named after his great...something... grand...something...father, the king. His family name is well known, he is a renowned boat builder and owns the largest shipyard in the merchant harbor; building ships both for commerce and war.
“Six months ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking” Sherlock smiled lopsidedly and Angelo beamed at him.
Titus travels to Rome to study Rhetoric, his father wants him to be a good Rhetor, be part of the public life, just like he is. He's learned geography, music, literature, geometry and mythology; over the next few years of his life, which were already planned, he does as father tells, so he goes to Greece to become a philosopher. Titus excels in all his studies. He's become one of the best
“I have work”
“Busy?” Bill laughed out loud, his whole body moving with his laughter “That’s the worst excuse ever” He shook his head and rolled his eyes.
Since that night, and thereafter, Greg became one of Sherlock’s biggest supporters and even offered to off Victor after what he had done, the young man smiled and shook his head softly before going back to his usual scowl and saying “Stop talking nonsense, Lestrade, and get me a cold case”, before turning his back to the soon to be sergeant and running up the stairs to his bedroom.
In his mind, Sherlock felt guilty of everything, even inviting John into his life… If only he hadn’t accepted the phone that first day, none of this would have happened, he wouldn’t have spent two years of his life fighting to keep John alive, he wouldn’t have endured lack of sleep, torture, hunger…
John looked at the stage, a bit disinterested; he nodded and stifled another yawn, covering it behind his drink. John tried not to be bored, he pretended he was interested in what was happening, but watching a bunch of men doing what he considered the straightest play in the world wasn’t exactly his cup of tea. The stage filled with several characters and he browsed the playbill, pretending to be interested.
“Are we interrupting something?” Mike asked innocently and Bill burst into laughter.
He knew he shouldn’t do it over the phone, he knew it wasn’t the correct thing to do, but he also knew that if he faced John he would accept everything and will stay in a loveless relationship with the only man he had ever loved. With trembling hands he composed a text, a reply to John’s excuse…
John looked at the screen and shook his head “Wait until we fall asleep?” John asked and Sherlock nodded.
“Yeah” John smiled, his mind wondering back to last night and how he had to contain himself to not pop the question while they were doing the dishes. “Jus’ thinking” He played with his jacket zipper.
“Congratulations on the engagement” Sherlock nodded at the ring and with a quick movement opened the door to the car and jumped in, leaving a baffled Victor looking at his hand and then at the moving car. Sherlock wished he could have felt something, even anger, but seeing Victor just reminded him of his childhood, the happy moments they had spent playing pirates, of Redbeard and the kiss which un-luckily -not sure if it was lack of luck or more likely the best of luck-, never really was.
John was baffled, to say the least. He thought they were fine, he thought they were going to make it, but Sherlock had decided otherwise. It wasn’t the first time that something like this happened, Sherlock making a decision that ultimately would change both their lives.
Eurus smirked and looked at him intently, Sherlock felt scrutinized, dissected… ‘John must have felt the same way when I deduced him’ he thought and tried to keep calm, his hand was trembling, not knowing if he was afraid of his sister finding out about his sex life, or by the fact that he had a sex life now, he closed his eyes for the briefest of moments to gather his thoughts back
A man beating down corpses; Me? I'm just waiting for my own turn to be beat down. And then, eyes the colour of the ocean look down at me; and I could feel, with my soul, how he mourns for my loss.
As for Mycroft, Sherlock had avoided John meeting big brother since they first got acquainted. Mycroft had teased him the day of the wedding about his “lust at first sight” to which Sherlock had rebutted with a snarky comment of Mycroft being off his diet and how Alicia felt about a flabby stomach, Mycroft sneered something nasty in his direction about Victor dumping him for his frigidness, which Sherlock had returned with the reasons behind Anthea’s refusal to Mycroft’s marriage proposal.
After a late lunch for both of them, Sherlock reminded John that he had a meeting in Baker Street and John was ready to come with him. John helped Sherlock clean the house while Sherlock explained he decided to stay with his brother instead of going home to Enfield with his parents.
I'm a soul in charge to see them, know that they are together... in my particular universe... They sit in silence for hours now, comforting in the presence of the other. The sound of their even breathing losing the battle against the uprising of the home fire.
“Yes” Sherlock cleared his throat and looked out the window, then closed his eyes for a few seconds and focused again on John “I’ve a few news” He bit his lower lip and looked at the candle in the middle of the table “Remember a week ago, I came to visit and I told you about Oxford?” John nodded and the shook his head, as if trying to clear his memories. Sherlock took a deep breath “Remember I told you I was basically done with University?” Sherlock tapped his fingers on the table. John shook his head again “I told you that I’ve managed to complete the entire programme, including my research. I’ve talked to my professors and…” He hoped John wouldn’t be angry “I’ve finished University, graduation could be in July” He gave John an awkward smile and waited.
“Sherlock will tell me when he’s ready” John crossed his arms over his chest “I don’t want to rush him, besides, we’ve been very busy” John took a deep breath.
John approached him during the monologue and placed a cup of tea near him “I hate it when you do that” John huffed “But I love it when you deduce” He sat in front of him and sipped his tea “You kept looking at him” John moped and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
“Mum” John greeted her awkwardly, glancing at Bill and Mike who entered the flat.
“Why are you so tense?” Sherlock approached him and John flinched “Why are you so angry?” Sherlock walked away from John and went to the living room, settling comfortably on his chair in front of the chimney.
Making love
“What I mean, is that neither of us should sacrifice our free time for the sake of being in London” John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and spoke softly “I want you there with me all the time” He said at the look of dismay in Sherlock’s eyes “But I also know how important chemistry is to you, how far along you already are in Oxford” John locked gazes with Sherlock to convey all he was feeling “And how much your family would appreciate you getting your degree in the University you chose” His eyes were so tender and caring that took Sherlock’s breath away.
, the voice inside my head whispers and I shake my head. Cocaine must be to blame.
“What did you say?”
“Water, please” Julia Watson muttered as she held her husband’s hand, trying to bring him out of his astonishment.
. John remembered the first night they had shared a bed and he realised that never, not even when he was lost for James he felt so warm, secure and at home as he felt next to Sherlock.
He went to the Yard to pester Lestrade for a little while. He’d been receiving cold cases every week and Greg was very fond of the little rascal he had met five years ago, a boy he had saved from drugs during a night his brother called “a danger night”. He’d escaped his home after Redbeard was put down, a young constable, that had recently joined the force found him wondering around a bad neighbourhood and had watched as Billy Wiggings, one of the many, Baker Street irregulars offered the boy the solution for his problems and handed him a bag of cocaine in exchange for some of the money he had in his wallet.
. He bent a little and winked at some poor lonely -usually old- man sitting close to the stage.
"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street."
Lunch time came and went and they shared some food in a café near the park and walked some more, Rosie was ready for her nap and they walked back to Baker Street, planning the meeting with the Watsons. They took advantage of Rosie´s nap to make dinner, clean the bathroom and doing the laundry, putting up some more books, catching up on cold cases, with Sherlock calling workers to start on C and John reading some of his medical material.
Luckily for John, Sherlock was finishing packing Rosie’s stuff -at least that’s what John thought- so he didn’t realise Sherlock was standing by the window, witnessing John’s interaction with his mother.
John swore he could hear him huff.
I give what you probably been waiting for the last 30 chapters, some fluff! LOL, not too smutty but here goes nothing...
"I was expensive," I say as way of explanation, "my brother fared it worst, he was... used... by my uncle, then sold to another brothel, he died, eventually, disease ridden."
“Completely” Sherlock whimpered and moved his head to the side and gave John more room to kiss and taste
Marcus has become a strong young man. Uncle Claudius can't be more happy. Marcus has proved, time and time again, to be a good son and a good man. Claudius handed him the farm and its thriving under his watch. At eighteen, he's a seasoned farmer. He's learned all about farming and manning farmers, he's also convinced uncle to go into Aquaculture  and the business has flourished, they are traders and have a growing business, though now they have people working for them, Marcus likes to deliver the goods himself, particularly to the most prominent houses.
. And he winked in John’s direction and he knew tonight was the night…
After almost ten years in the army, Marcus is to retire, but he still has a battle in him, so off he goes, the faithful seventh following Caesar to Africa. In the meantime, year 46 B.C. sees Titus teaching, one of the most sought philosophy teachers in Athens, but his father's death brings him to Rome, as he is to take his seat at the senate.
“And where’re you moving?”
“I’m sorry, John” Sherlock was almost pleading and John felt his heart break “I had no idea… When Mamie summons us, it’s quite difficult to say no” he tried to chuckle but it sounded more like a sob.
“Good bye son” Julia hugged him again “I love you”
“Why didn’t you kiss him?” She demanded, Sherlock had to put the phone away from his ear.
“I’ll be waiting” She patted his arm.
"He's always my brother," I say with a quiet snort. "He likes to play "you poor ignorant souls" once he realises he's my brother," I shake my head, I find it amusing that Mycroft, of all souls, is stuck with me. "I've told you he's always been like he is now."
"Time for food," he announces and distracts me with a kiss; before pushing me softly, so I'm forced to stand up. I see him, fighting the next memory. Sometimes is quite hard.
As soulmates go, sometimes we're separated for longer periods of time than first planned; ever since humans became "sapiens"... as if "just thinking" has anything to do with "feeling"...
, or so he heard that saying that
“How’s the family?” Mike started to walk with John and followed him to wherever he was going.
“I missed you” John whispered against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“But for this man, I’d have gone to prison” Angelo said, serious.
“J’adore” Vivienne smiled at her grandson and walked away.
“If you try, you’ll never see her again, because I’ll take her to her real grandparents” John hissed. After the aftermath, Julia left a very frustrated John that went to the Holmes manor to be with his daughter and her grandparents. They helped him with all the legalities involving Rosie, including the fact that her real father was in jail. He never told Sherlock about the fight, he couldn’t, not when Sherlock was busy with his project and his classes.
Sherlock scowled, John pursed his lips and clenched his fists… they both glared at the physician -who promptly left the premises before his body was one of the most wanted and less easy to find- In the end, baby Rosie -with Hudders and Molls’ help- got her way by clutching her tiny fist in Sherlock’s shirt and falling asleep in his arms. Whenever Sherlock tried to put her down she would cry and he was forced to stay put whit his daughter in his arms.
“Mary, love, you okay?” He asked the closed door and tried to force it open. With no other answer than silence he started pounding and screaming Mary’s name “Open this door young lady” He shouted “Don’t make me force this door open” He threatened and pounded on the white painted wood again.
Enjoy, and as always, love the comments and kudos. I love you all and Happy Sherlock!
“WHAT?” John was enraged; one thing is hate him for what he did and another having Mary arrested for trying to talk to him.
“Fuck!” Eurus took a deep breath “Will you at least think about it, Bee?” She pleaded.
“You really think so?” Sherlock blushed.
Six degrees of separation, every person in everyone’s life is separated from someone else’s in someone’s life by six degrees of separation. John and Sherlock were the “friend of a friend”, separated exactly by those six degrees of separation. Molly was that friend that had a friend that was the friend of a friend, Molly was Mary’s friend at school, they finished sixth form together and she went to study medicine with John at Queen Mary University of London. Yes, John was two years older than her, so when Molly started studying and by the day of the wedding, it was her first year.
Barely able to walk, raging erections tenting their trousers, they ended up in a little hostel near the train station, clothes went flying around, shoes followed trousers, pants followed shirts…. A quick hump to relieve the tension, a quick orgasm followed by apologetic kisses and caresses, the build-up, the want, the need…
“Let us get settled. I’ll get Rosie from his parents and we can plan something; I’ve to ask him first, but I think we could do lunch in a couple of days, you can come and see the flat, make sure Rosie has her own room and maybe help me taking care of her again?” John offered, hoping his mother would say yes.
They arrived to Angelo’s and the greeting was nothing John could’ve expected. A man practically launched himself to Sherlock and the young man simply smiled and tried, quite awkwardly to return the hug, though was more graceful when he returned the handshake.
“I did that yesterday, Sherlock”
“Tonight, you’re mine” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear as he kissed his ear shell and tasted him
“We’ve been busy” John repeated “Managing Rosie, my shifts at the hospital, his cases, school…” John rested his head on his hand “It’s as if the urge is lacking…” John smiled “I can’t wait to be with him, he actually makes it really hard not to be physical, but he keeps me quite satisfied” John chuckled
“Experiment” Sherlock answered plainly
Maybe you've already guessed our punishment. No? We fell on a loop of endless repetition, closer and closer to meet, but never being able.
After that, there's darkness and confusion, a long wait alone, then I was born with a scream and the memory of loss.
“So” John bit his lower lip and locked gazes with Sherlock’s eyes. “Not going with him tonight?” He tried to smirk but his face was too flushed and he was too excited. Sherlock shook his head and in a rush of adrenaline he pulled John to the dressing room and started kissing him, desperately. He had waited for over two weeks to do that...
“Not a peep” John shook his head and chuckled.
“Yes…” John licked his lips again, feeling his nerves crash and burn “Actually…” He looked down at Rosie and tried to gather the courage that was leaving him with every breath.
. And those maddening eyes were devouring him.
“Mum just left” John rubbed his eyes with both his hands “She cleaned my room, said I should find a place of my own” He took a deep breath “She even proposed taking Rosie away from me” He ran a hand over his hair tiredly “Said I should find a nice girl to share the responsibility” He put his hands to either side of his face and looked up, shaking his head and trying to calm down “When I told her about you she threatened me with taking Rosie away, so I had to tell her the truth”
Another wink and he would throw his leg over the veranda and lean forward.
When he was ready, the news went surprisingly… well… Unlike any other parents; they weren’t shocked, they were actually waiting for their son to come out. Violet and Siger were as perceptive as their children and could read a person from a mile away. They actually hugged and kissed him, congratulated him and gave him the embarrassing “safety first” chat. Mycroft rolled his eyes and just muttered “about bloody time” and patted his back “I’ll always be there for you” He whispered close to Sherlock’s ear and beamed at him before schooling his features to the Minor Government representative -yeah right, Sherlock still snorts at the absurdity of the affirmation- he is.
“Close to five” John nodded and looked down at the baby.
Titus feels his heart about to explode. He opens his eyes and finds himself surrounded by several concerned faces belonging to his fellow senators. He's helped home by one of his service men. He asks to be alone to recover. Next morning he doesn't go to the Senate. Last night, he prepared some milk with AKONITON, effectively numbing, and ending, the searing pain.
“Be there in twenty” Sherlock let the breath he’d been holding and carried Rosie to the living room. He sat and took the time before his mother came to truly see the little girl. Her hair was dark blonde, her nose a little button, tiny hands and feet, her lips were thin and her eyelashes long. Sherlock couldn’t stop looking at her, he had never been so close to a baby and he was fascinated. Her rosy skin was soft and she smelled like lavender and roses’ water. Her tiny hand grabbed his index finger and he was lost; he didn’t even hear his mother entering the house and he didn’t feel her stand behind him and surely it went past him when she took a photo of the both of them.
“Then?” He asked nervously.
Sherlock: Bee, short for Honeybee
Marcus Flavius Caelius is playing outside of his house while father checks on mother, she's been ill for a few days now. Since father believes in Rome and nothing else, he doesn't call one of the Greek physicians that offer their services to the town. He leaves the house, pale as death, and little Marcus knows something is wrong. Mother has died of tuberculosis, father is ill and they have to vacate the house. Father dies four weeks later and little Marcus, at his short age of eight, has to go live with his uncle, away from Rome, away from home.
“Hi” He said shyly.
“Hi” Sherlock greeted shyly “Sorry about that” He apologised in a whisper.
“When?” John played with his water cup; he had no idea what else to ask.
"I have a similar memory, a beach, the same year. I guess we truly "just" missed each other." He quotes in the air and he sighs sadly. "But... but I felt a happiness hard to describe. I remember smiling the entire day." And there it is, his luminous smile, my conductor of light.
“So is Donovan” Sherlock took another deep breath and tried to hide his smile behind a huff of disgust at the smell, taking great joy in their befuddled expressions.
John smiled widely at the idea of tomorrow.
John grabbed him by his lapels and shook him violently, he wanted to punch him “Don’t you ever” He snarled
of the Pia Claudia, 8 men under his command.
“No lectures for the next five Saturdays!” John flicked his tongue at Sherlock and lifted his arms over his head in celebration.
. He would walk turn and draw a finger down his chest and look for another one.
But for a while now, things have been different. How, you may ask? Well...
“If you don’t jump…” Bill shook his head “You’ll have a place here, always… well…” Bill rubbed the back of his neck “As long as we’re in University” He chuckled.
“Okay” Sherlock looked down at the baby and she eyed him curiously “I can do this” He looked up and found himself utterly lost for the first time in his life “I hate Molly” He let out a huff and Rosie started crying, he rocked her softly and the baby calmed and Sherlock sighed in relief. “Mummy? You in London?” His voice was small, worried and about to burst into tears, Violet Holmes, being the worried mother she was took a deep breath and tried not to panic.
"We almost met," Sherlock sounds wistful. I'm forced to nod, the memory still lingers painfully on the back of my mind.
“Apparently he’s done with University” John finished his drink and grabbed another bottle.
I look at him as he's lost in the memory and a sudden rush of sadness overcomes me. Suddenly I start recalling what happened to the other me, the first one of me I remember. Sherlock can sense my distress and reaches for me, his hand on my knee helps with the panic and clears the images.
With invitations sent, seat arrangements made, wedding suits and dresses made; bridesmaids and groomsmen chosen, the wedding was at full steam. The night before the wedding Mary and John had talked in hushed tones while Rosie slept between them and they agreed not to interfere in the other’s romantic life. Sure, their situation wasn’t exactly the best or most perfect, but they could manage to become a family and have their… flings… let’s call it flings… on the side.
He waited two days before contacting Greg, he kept calling Sherlock only to find no answer to his desperate calls. He asked Mrs. H to look after Rosie while he looked for Sherlock underground, every hidden spot, every drug den, dose house, everywhere, and he discovered a new Sherlock; a man that had done so much for so many, that demonstrated love, affection, care and many human emotions that had him absolutely baffled
White rage filled his every sense, a searing sensation ran over his entire body and his legs were fuelled with the anger he felt… He kicked the duvet away and pulled open his door… He had to blink twice, thrice, four times, before his eyes connected with his brain, and his mouth stopped gapping and his throat stopped babbling. His brain come to a full stop, he had to reboot his system to completely understand what he was seeing.
Slight change of format for this chapter, texting between my boys
“I haven’t captured anyone” John said, annoyed with the woman and the conversation “Look” He took a deep breath “I have things to do…” He started but Irene cut him off.
“You knew?” Eurus sounded even more disbelieving than before.
Catastrophe struck the peaceful soul-haven. A new being evolved and changed the face of the earth. At first, the changes went unnoticed, a few souls wandering alone, then together once again, then... Then, taking forms, making thoughts, being alone longer, longer than longer.
“John” He sounded resigned and waiting for the proper scolding.
“As I told your brother, I don’t care about his money, or yours, for that matter” John was trying with all his might not to punch this pompous prick, he didn’t even knew his name but he hated him already.
Sherlock ran a finger over Hamish’s little nose and the baby sighed, more calm than before, Sherlock hadn’t noticed he had stopped crying
… “You left your dressing gown…” John stood still, frozen near the bathtub, the Detective didn’t move to cover, his brain trying to catch up with the situation “I…” John stood there, dressing gown falling to the floor; before he knew it, John’s hand was on his hair, fingers grabbing his curls and the other his face, pulling his chin up. John’s lips were soft but firm and the kiss… the kiss was searing, firing up his entire being…
He blinks slowly, as if confused, those mercurial eyes trying to focus.  "I always die," he looks at me with love and sorrow. "But I always come back and always remember that I've lost you..." I see tears in his eyes so I reach for him, the distance unbearable.
, formed a government; but Caesar's ambition was greater than anything else, this is when our story begins.
Three hours later, Sherlock checked his phone; he had a message from Greg
Mary finished with honours and sent a letter to the Cambridge Admissions Committee thanking them for her acceptance letter and basically pleading for a chance to hold the scholarship until the baby was at least a year old. The Committee agreed to wait for her under one condition; she’ll have to work to keep the scholarship.
“Hey!” John practically ran to Sherlock the second he saw him standing outside Bart’s “What’re you doing here?” He asked and planted several kissed on Sherlock’s lips.
As soon as Sherlock saw John, his face illuminated; he beamed at John and practically ran to his side, wrapping his arms around him “You’re here” Sherlock hugged John close and John couldn’t help but chuckle and wrap his arms tighter around Sherlock.
Molly was James’ friend too, they had met at party in James’ house and he had kissed her in his basement, once, during a “seven minutes in heaven” game. She wanted to kiss John, but Sarah had asked for that honour first so she had to kiss James. She saw the opportunity to get to know John when Mary came to study in their school and became friends with John instantly; to her dismay, John was dating James, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be her friend.
“The baby is not his, Molly told me” Eurus countered “But if you want to wait… well…” She fell silent and Sherlock huffed.
They talked, every single day, about their expectations, their needs, their dreams and fears; and even though all they wanted was to ravish each other, they decided to wait, the time will come and it will be perfect. Sherlock had to admit he was scared -terrified is more like it- but he wanted John more than he ever wanted anything in his life; he had no idea how to propose to John to move forward and rush things a bit; he wanted their first night at the flat to be their first night together, but exhaustion got the best of them; after that, there was always something, a case, a night shift, or a day shift, school, practices, family visits, friends coming to study or to visit, and there was always Rosie…
Sherlock rolled his eyes but he was grinning.
Suddenly, John’s hands were on him, fingers running down with feather light touches from his throat to his navel, touching Sherlock’s body reverentially, scorching touches that outlined Sherlock’s newly formed pectorals and abdominals -all the boxing and running-; John looked up, not a question, not asking, just looking, and Sherlock nodded, imperceptibly, a slight movement, a bounce of his raven like curls, and John’s mouth was on his, greedy, hungry, incessant, asking for entrance, which Sherlock readily granted. Then there was a little push as they walked to their bedroom, never breaking the kiss, John’s hands reaching for Sherlock’s body while Sherlock fumbled with John’s shirt buttons.
It all happened in a sweet and sweaty haze at first. They were hugging, John was crying for his late wife and Sherlock had just received a text from The Woman, then they parted, went to a party and…
Tea and cake served, Sherlock gave Mrs. Hudson the latest scoop on her husband’s case. “I just made sure he’s executed” Sherlock said between cake bites “He won’t be bothering you ever again” He gave her a sweet smile and she patted his hand amorously.
“Where’re you going?” She looked over the boxes and bags.
They arrived to Angelo’s and the greeting was nothing John could’ve expected. A man practically launched himself to Sherlock and the young man simply smiled and tried, quite awkwardly to return the hug, though was more graceful when he returned the handshake.
Sherlock was nineteen, almost out of University with his degree in Chemistry when Victor had convinced him to join the drama club. Sherlock was reluctant at first but Victor could be very persuasive… no wander he chose to study diplomacy…
BTW, this chapter has three parts. If you want you can avoid reading about the fight in part two, although it makes no sense at all if you just read one an three... I'm sorry if I offend anyone with my ramblings, but as much as I love these characters, I know they are human and are portrayed by humans. Moffat and Gattiss did say they weren't writting a gay series, they did say they wouldn't end up together. Love what they have given us, love them like you love Ben and Martin and John and Sherlock, and enjoy that open ending they gave to us, that ending that keeps the dream alive and the oportunity for us to create our own universe!
After a month of coward distance, Sherlock was summoned to London by Lestrade, something to do with a cold case he had helped solve; Sherlock texted back a simple “fine”. That Friday, after his last lecture of the morning, he boarded the 1:11 pm to Marylebone; yes, he hated having to travel twenty more minutes to the Yard, but he had to go to Baker Street; he had a client there and was imperative he interviewed Martha Hudson. The minute he arrived to London, another text from Lestrade took him out of his reverie
John was ready for everything; he prepared himself mentally to accept whatever may come his way. He walked slowly, taking deep breaths, thinking of Mary’s smile, of her face when he accepted to help her, how relieved she looked when John held her and told her he’ll be there to tell her parents together. What John didn’t know was that Mary’s parents, Rosamund and Alex Morstan would be so -pissed off was a mild term for what they were- angry, baffled, irate, livid… Alex Morstan even threatened to kill him but John managed to talk him down with just a few words.
“What?” Mycroft raised his eyebrow in mock surprise “Is the young doctor reluctant to live with you?” He pretended concern.
"If I could, I would have killed them all; your uncle..." He pulls me close and holds me, I feel his rage emanating from every pore, his fists clench to my sides as he inhales deeply and tries to calm.
“Thanks” John gave him a small smile.
John was smiling, that dazzling smile he usually had when Sherlock made him laugh; he had his date shoes on, Sherlock’s favourite shirt, the blue one that did wonders to his eyes, those jeans that made him look… Sherlock held a moan by biting his lower lip and looking back to John’s hands where the delphinium lay still.
The code/nicknames between Holmes siblings are as follows:
“John” Sherlock made the name sound like music to John’s ears “I wanted to write to you, but I wasn’t quite sure about what to say” He admitted shyly and John practically beamed at him.
He lowered his violin and bow and looked at his sister. He had managed, or at least he hoped, to deceive her, successfully changing the subject. ‘The game is on’ He thought as he tried to concentrate in what was to come.
John looked as Sherlock climbed in the back of a black sedan; he was confused, hurt and wanted some answers. He took his phone out and called Sherlock but went directly to voice mail and he remembered Sherlock turning off his phone when they sat at the restaurant so he didn’t bother to leave a message. Sherlock should call; the sooner the better.
“Oh, no, not at all” Sherlock grinned and sniffed again “I just realised your deodorant has a very musky scent” He took another deep breath.
“Dinner?”
“You’re a single parent, John” Sherlock rolled his eyes “You’re stablishing timetables and schedules; you need them to function properly. Going out today to your mother’s has clearly tired you, your left eye twitches when you haven’t had enough sleep. Going by Rosie’s age she still feeds every five hours, and you’ve glanced to the right side of the screen almost eighteen times since the call started, clearly checking the time and calculating” John blushed furiously “You look tired, John” Sherlock gave him a small smile “Get some sleep. I’ll call you at ten to chat some more while you feed Rosie”
“OF COURSE YOU’RE RESPONSIBLE” Alex Morstan shouted to the top of his lungs and barely managed to control his urge to punch John in the face. “You’re two bloody teenagers with all your life ahead of you” He continued, fists to the sides and red faced “You’re four months from turning nineteen and she’s barely seventeen” He sounded desperate, sad… massively disappointed… Mary flinched at the last few words and felt her world crumble.
“Chinese?” Sherlock cocked his head.
“You’re not a freak, love.” John was running his fingers on Sherlock’s curls as they sat together on the sofa sharing Chinese
And John had been thinking -for a while he had been thinking about the same thing-; the thought surprised him in the least expected moments, could be his morning shower, while feeding Rosie, while he was in the middle of a class, or during a practice, visiting a patient, while in rugby practices, while he was on the tube or when he walked from Tesco back home. He would smile at the thought, a huge grin that illuminated his entire face; most times he would have to school his features, mostly because people would ask him what was funny about a disease, or if he thought a patient needed such a huge smile when he was giving bad news.
“He cleared my name” John would have laughed but the solemnity in Angelo’s face prevented him.
“Who the hell are you?” Donovan tried to stop John, but one look told her she better scurried out, or else; she froze on the spot and stood there unable to say another thing.
“Gorgeous” John whispered and Sherlock kissed his neck and sucked on his pulse point.
Her boyfriend, David, made his best act ever and disappeared as soon as the lines appeared on the stick… She was devastated and he had said to her that he had no idea how that happened, that she should go and look for the true responsible for the situation and bolted, as fast as he could…
“I’ll be waiting” The card read and was signed “John”. Sherlock smiled and held the card to his lips, it smelled manly and all he could think about was the look in John’s eyes. He changed and cleaned the glitter and the oil from his body, he ran a hand over his curls, trying to tame them and put on his bespoke suit. He was about to walk out of the dressing room when a few knocks startled him “Not going with you tonight, Victor” He said as he opened the door, and there he was, the man himself.
“You don’t seem very afraid” Mycroft tried to loom over him, using his height and weight against him.
John moved up to kiss him until they were both breathless and he reached for what he needed on his bedside table, he took the lube and condoms but Sherlock stopped him and threw the condoms box away. John looked at him quizzically and Sherlock simply shook his head “Just you” he whispered against John’s neck.
. He usually found Victor or another Drama Club friend and felt less embarrassed.
At first, before coming out to his parents, John had met Mary, the young girl, a year younger than him, was sweet and beautiful, every boy wanted her, every girl wanted to be her, well, except John Watson. They became good friends rather quickly; he was tutoring her in science. At some point they seemed attached to the hip, even his parents thought there was something there, but they were just good friends, actually, the best. He had come out to her before telling anyone; she kept his secrets, he kept hers. He told her he was gay, she told him she was in love with David. He told her he loved James, even before telling James, she told him she was ready to have sex with David, even before telling David. He told her all about his first time with James, on James seventeenth birthday, it had been loving, slow, a bit painful, but quite pleasurable. If only she had told John about hers…
John realised that Sherlock was right, that he wasn’t worthy of such a man, such a caring human being, a man that had sacrificed his life for him many times in many ways and not once had asked for anything in return, not even the love he more than deserved. John felt ashamed and decided right there and then that he wouldn’t look for Sherlock Holmes again, that Sherlock deserved to be loved, cherished and cared for and that he wasn’t ready to give him what he deserved
“Nice to see you too, brother dear” Mycroft sneered and gained a redoubled scowl from Sherlock. Sherlock simply crossed his arms over his chest and looked as the cab with John left, today of all days Mycroft had to make an appearance. “I take it was a belated celebration of your two months together”
Sure, the kisses were heated, the touches felt like fire whenever a hand ran over a leg  or an arm, every single touch and kiss leaving a tingling sensation at the base of their spines, but they waited, patiently, lovingly, happily. John was sure that if he waited, when it came it will be the best experience ever, Sherlock was certain of the same, even though the wait was becoming less pleasant and uncomfortable, and a few times quite embarrassing, because of certain dreams Sherlock was having, opening your eyes in the middle of the night and finding yourself sticky, wasn’t something he found as pleasurable as the lasting sensation of a fulfilling orgasm.
“Don’t be crass, Sherlock” Mycroft scolded “And no. You know I’m not like that” He picked on some invisible lint from his jacket sleeve.
“Thank you” He heard John whisper and he just smiled “You should have closed the screen” John blushed and Sherlock shook his head “It was nice having you somewhat near, though” John gave Sherlock a small smile while he juggled with Rosie and the bottle.
“Am I supposed to be okay with what you did?” He kept his voice low, he didn’t want his mother finding about what happened yesterday.
"I'm ready." He says firmly and I know it's time.
“What?” John needed Sherlock to repeat what he had said, he needed to make sure. Sherlock had asked him to move in together but they’d been together for two months, should he move in with him?
“I think we should talk to your parents” Julia looked at Mary and Mary gave her a small smile.
“That’s not what people normally say” Sherlock shrugged and looked away, blushing hard.
John took a step closer and was close to Sherlock’s bedroom door, his smile still as bright as the sun and his eyes, oh his eyes! Sherlock had never seen them so… clear… so full of… sentiment… dare he say love?
I mean, I have "friends" -funny little word to describe beings that were there, are there, and will be there for each other for eons- that simply know me. Ever found a stranger and clicked? Instantly? Well... "soul-friends" do that, more often than not, and these "friends" help us find our mates, they help us look for them... or direct us to them, for example, my "friend" M... And yet again, I'm jumping ahead.
“That’s it?” John tried not to laugh. Sherlock was too nervous, everything was so new and he had to remind himself, constantly that Sherlock had a brain that works in overtime.
They bounced on the bed together, arms and leg flying in every direction. Sherlock chuckled and John laughed, grinning at each other they locked eyes, and this time, John’s eyes asked for permission and Sherlock agreed with a slight nod. John started kissing him, his eyelids, his cheeks, his ears, and then he concentrated all his efforts on his neck, going down until he reached Sherlock’s navel; slowly, he opened his trousers’ button and slid the fabric down Sherlock’s long, pale legs, followed closely by his briefs. Standing, John took a look at the beautiful creature on the bed, his want reflected in his eyes and his cock.
“No” Sherlock looked down and John worried again.
"Sleep sounds good," He mutters, ever since we first kissed, we've been sharing dreams, we're exhausted, many of the "dreams" turn into horrible nightmares of times lost and gone. Everything is coming back to us in sudden flashes... sometimes rushes of happiness so strong that leaves us giddy for days, others, unbearable pain that renders us useless, the dreams rarely bring comfort, or sense of completion; but now...
“The day we met, you had a stain of food on your sleeve. It was clearly hotpot, the smell of baked potatoes told me it was Lancashire. You clearly ate it a few days prior because your jacket still held a whiff of the smell” Sherlock’s eyes were looking at John intently “You had it again today, the same stain on you left sleeve. You also have stains on your shirt indicating that you changed Rosie several times, always staining the same spot and trying to clean it with baby wipes and marginally succeeding” he gave a once over to John.
“Missing an appointment?” Sherlock asked with a snarl as he threw his own phone on the table
Sherlock downed it in one go, the lyrics in the back of his head as a reassurance and as a doubt at the same time “So happy together?” He blinked one more time, his mind coming to term with his surroundings.
“I’m sorry, John” Molly muttered and John just huffed.
"Coffee!" John is cheerful this morning, it's heartening, it means he's feeling well and happy. It could also be all the sex we're having, but I, too, find myself smiling more often than not, much to my dismay, and John's amusement, while in the presence of others. "Making love," John calls our physical encounters, I feel like rolling my eyes, but the giddy feeling in my chest makes me nod and kiss him again. Who would have thought I was so... physical?
. He wiggled in his direction and could see arousal in his eyes.
. He looked at the blond and his mind would wander to all the things he’d like to be done to him by that tongue currently travelling over those thin lips.
“No” John shook his head “We already agreed” John wanted to say yes, but at the same time, he didn’t want to pressure Sherlock.
“So? He likes you!” Molly sounded affronted by John’s apparent disinterest “She told me he’s afraid to start something long distance. He was in Oxford when Victor…” She bit her lip and John could sense her hesitation.
“I love you very much” Sherlock leaned up for a kiss
When John entered he saw him there, sitting at one of the stools, in front of a microscope, his riotous curls falling everywhere around his lovely face, a frown on his brow and that look that said to John he was “busy now, John” and John just stood there, watching him, the way he moved his hands, those beautiful hands that had been all over him last night, John shivered at the memory; his unfathomable eyes rapidly searching for whatever was under the microscope lenses, his pursed lips, beautiful pursed lips that had kissed him… oh how had they kissed him… and then a bit of tongue rushing over his plush lower lip… oh the tongue, swirling, licking… oh dear god! John took a deep breath that made Sherlock look up, his eyes locked with John’s and they simply started at each other, Sherlock’s smile could illuminate the world and John somehow knew that there was no better time than the present.
. A voice whisper inside my head.
“All of the above” Sherlock shrugged, he was feeling uncomfortable, but he wanted to stay and get to know this man, even if it meant doing some small talk.
“You have a light in your eyes” John looked up and locked gazes with Sherlock while his hand wandered down
“More to the point then… We made a mistake by getting together… I made a mistake by inviting you to my life…”He looked down, unable to meet John’s eyes
Hello all!!! So, I'm in my free week so I'm updating all I have of this story... and then maybe... have you wait for about a month, unless I finish it the next couple of days.  Thank you for reading!!! Happy Sherlock!
“How long have you been together?” Henry asked his son, his eyes focused solely on Sherlock and Rosie.
“Yes, she’s been great help” John smiled and his smile turned even brighter when Sherlock cradled the baby better and shushed her softly “it has made it easier to accept Mary’s gone” he smiled sadly “She was my best friend” John shrugged and looked at his coffee “But as I said; I’ve a great support system, but the nights are the hardest, I have to feed her twice every night, but we do manage” He looked at Rosie and Sherlock handed her back, feeling strangely empty.
His mother, on the other hand, blamed television, video games, music, friends, even the air “that has changed so much since we were young, Henry” Julia Watson, unlike her husband, wanted to keep her son close “We can keep an eye on him, make sure no soldier gets his way with him” She had covered her mouth and John had to roll his eyes “You know how those soldiers are, all alone in those tents” She sighed sadly and Henry relented in his heart burning desire of making him a real Watson.
“Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy, darling, darling, darling son” He finished and looked up when he heard a rustle, John, his John, was right there, leaning on the door frame and looking at him lovingly. He put Hamish in his cot, he was fast asleep, and walked to his husband
“That’s… Five conditions!” Sherlock protested and pouted again.
“Saw them at the wedding” Sherlock answered.
“John” Sherlock whispered and John leaned forward to give him a chaste kiss on the lips.
“Hey” John held Sherlock’s hand and pulled him to the café, leaning close and snuggling him.
Sherlock put Rosie on the ground and fetched water for all of them; he looked at John, not knowing what else to do. Thankfully, Rosie broke the ice by calling John loudly “Daddy” she screeched and then giggled, showing John her latest great deed, taking off her socks and wiggling her toes. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and the conversation started flowing around Rosie and what she’d been doing.
Adulthood came rushing to the Holmes house when Mycroft brought his first girlfriend to meet the parents at the age of twenty one. Eurus was curious about this “Anthea” that flaunted around their home with short skirts and tight shirts during summer vacation. She saw the way Mycroft looked at her when she waltzed around holding his hand or kissing his cheek and Eurus noticed the way her brother’s pulse quickened and his breathing changed. Eurus started an experiment of her own, and over the next few days analysed the behaviour of several male members of her family, Papa excluded of course, when around Anthea, and what she found out both startled and relaxed her in a way. Sherlock, her brother, the apple of her eye wasn’t interested at all in Anthea, but his eyes changed whenever silly Victor was around
“You did go to prison” Sherlock clarified.
“Yes…”
"How old were you?" my John's voice sounds hoarse and strange, he might be channeling.
And then, it happened, Christmas Eve, nine months and six days after they got together. They’d just put Rosie to bed and were about to share dinner when a drinking accident happened, Sherlock spilled his wine over his shirt because he got distracted by John’s question about their plans for Christmas day. He pulled his white shirt over his head and went to the kitchen to soak it. John was looking at him with a hungry expression that left Sherlock breathless.
When their minds finally reconnected with their bodies, Sherlock helped John clean up and kissed him chastely on the cheek “Nice to meet you, Mister?” Sherlock smirked.
“Okay…” Bill went over to the kitchen and stood in front of the fridge, being several inches taller than John he knew he’ll be able to stop his friend from drinking the six-pack.
“I could be wrong… but I think that’s none of your business” John clicked his tongue, trying to control his anger.
“Why are you telling me this?”
“Is it bigger than this one?” John had no idea, he didn’t even know if Rosie had her own room, so he assumed it was big enough for the three of them.
Afternoon for John was almost unbearable. He couldn’t believe all the opportunities he had of kissing Sherlock and he had taken none. His mother noticed he was distracted but chose not to ask. His good mood and smiles made up for his distraction. He managed, somehow, to survive the afternoon with his family and plan the best schedule to be with Rosie. His mum fussed around him, asking how he’d been, where he’d been, how was his Saturday, why he didn’t call or came by.
“Then?” He asked nervously.
“I did deduce him.” Sherlock sat up and pouted, looking away from John.
A few months later, John talked to Harry and they finally made up when his older brother understood that John wasn’t different, wasn’t less, wasn’t damaged; he just was… in love… he explained to his older brother that he felt the same way he did when he looked at Clara every time he looked at James, his heart would beat fast, his stomach would flutter, he would feel a rush of adrenaline and love travel through his body. He was in love, just as much as his brother was, the only difference was that he was in love with another man.
He admitted to the affair to Mary’s ghost, the ghost of his past, right in front of Sherlock, the ghost of his present, before either one of them could become the ghost of his future… He was heartbroken, but Sherlock had mended him. They had talked long and hard and in the end, everything fit where it had to fit and they were together, finally!
“You miss him” Mamie caressed his check and ruffled his hair softly before kissing his forehead. Sherlock nodded and hid his face behind his hands “Have you talked to him?” Sherlock shook his head “You had plans?” Sherlock nodded once more “How long have you been together?”
S!, moving in with said man and trying to find a job that wasn’t boring enough to kill him, raising a child and acting in ways he had never acted- failed, crashed and burned, it was keeping Mycroft on his toes, he needed to know if John Watson was right for Sherlock.
John gaped at the man and Sherlock smiled, pleased “I’m not his date” John managed to say and Sherlock frowned; he meant to say “I’m his boyfriend, but the man kept on smiling and talking.
He had to go pick up Rosie from her grandparents, Molly had offered to help and so had done Mike. He was walking to his parents’ house when he heard someone call his name. When John turned he saw James, but instead of his heart jumping in his chest, his stomach churned and he felt a wave of something akin of disgust. He invited John for a coffee; he wanted to talk, “after what happened with Mary…” He bit his lower lip and John felt compelled to comply. “I was just thinking we could, reconnect” He said, looking down.
“I want all of you” Sherlock arched his back, needing John’s touch “in me” Sherlock exhaled loudly.
He loved having different lecturers every three weeks, but sometimes it could be… overwhelmingly… boring changing lecturer every other week. At least he had the distraction and he wasn’t as bored as his first year, seeing the same teachers twice a week for the same subject. Lost in his reverie and the work, he barely noticed the train was pulling at the station in Oxford 4. He climbed off the train and decided to walk instead of taking a cab. It was 20 minutes from the station to his room and he could pick something to eat at the Petit Gateau. He had promised Mummy he would eat.
“I could never leave you” He whispered the words to John’s head, kissing his forehead softly and running his hands over John’s back
They finally opened the door only to find Mary laying on a pool of blood, her wedding gown torn to pieces, her shoes missing, hair in disarray, hands over her head, no signs of struggle, except for the chair that fell with the weight of her body as she fell to the floor. Alex put his hand to his mouth and fell to his knew, his baby girl was lying dead on the floor. Rosamund fainted and Henry could barely hold her before John caught Rosie in his arms, Julia was stunned and nailed to the floor, unable to move or speak.
"Love?"
Instead of Mary walking down the aisle, a very flustered Alex Morstan ran to John and whispered something in his ear. John rushed behind his father in law, followed by a very concerned Rosamund Morstan, carrying little Rosie; after them went the Watsons, questioning and apologetic faces.
After washing the dishes he joined John in the bathroom and helped with Rosie; by the time they were done, baby girl changed and ready to go the park. Their visit to the park was nothing out of the extraordinary, Rosie looking after every insect and flower she could find, John and Sherlock walking hand in hand, pushing the buggy together and talking about everything and nothing.
Mycroft was left dumbfounded; he had expected something else, something different, not this person, this man, that seemed to love his brother, so soon after they first met; could he be right in assuming Sherlock had found the person that was to stay with him for the rest of his life? He certainly hopped so.
“I guess fairly soon” Sherlock sighed again, a deep sigh.
They bathed together, showered together, slept naked, shared small touches, but nothing truly sexual except John’s masturbatory sessions. The need was there, increasing with each passing day, but at the same time, the respect for each other, the knowledge that it will happen in time, and the fact that they already shared more intimacy than sex could bring, kept John happy and Sherlock relaxed.
He left the hospital after a staff meeting with his father and sister, one of his colleagues, Mike, invited him to see a show “I know a few of the performers” He said, and convinced a very tired, very reluctant John to go with him to see Sweet Charity. He sat and waited for the show to start, a brunette waitress tried to flirt with him and he gave her a polite smile and flirted back a little.
John realised that Sherlock was right, that he wasn’t worthy of such a man, such a caring human being, a man that had sacrificed his life for him many times in many ways and not once had asked for anything in return, not even the love he more than deserved. John felt ashamed and decided right there and then that he wouldn’t look for Sherlock Holmes again, that Sherlock deserved to be loved, cherished and cared for and that he wasn’t ready to give him what he deserved
“That can be arranged” Sherlock smirked “The weekend after next” He grinned “Did you checked your timetable?”
John is brilliant, sweet, loving, caring, smart, intelligent, perceptive, a good son, a good brother, a good person over all. John is perfect; at least that is what his boyfriend, James Sholto, says about him.
Please, let me know what you think so far? Is it boring? Is it too slow? Is it really, really, bad?
“I can wait” Sherlock said, his eyes sad but understanding “I know we’ve just met, that we’re getting to know each other, but this” he waved his hand between them “Feels… right” His eyes brightened at John’s smile “I’ll understand if you say no, but you’re the only one that know all about me” Sherlock’s eyes turned sad once again, John nodded.
“The skype sound” Sherlock scrunched his face.
"One I would have preferred not having," I remark; remembering the vile man has shaken me to the core; but my John, my amazing John, knows exactly what to say.
“It’s for men” Sherlock tried not to grin.
“I know…” John breathed Sherlock “I’m sorry…”
“Sherlock” She cooed.
And oh… fun did they have...
“I can’t believe it” John let out in long quivering breath
“Thank you, Sherlock” She sniffled and Sherlock just shook his head “Want to see it now?”
“I’ll call John when she’s ready” He said and turned around, closing the door in Molly’s face.
“I know you wouldn’t” Molly reassured “Would you wait for him?”
“Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy”
“You…” Sherlock stammered “You…” He tried again, his voice low and shaky. He took a deep breath; he needed to reconnect his speech centre with his larynx, tongue and vocal chords.
The second campaign over Britannia is more successful, Marcus' men helped Caesar and once more, he's granted a new rank. The military has also given him another chance, Apart from being a Decanus, he is considered a
"Please?" He mutters as he stoops to pick Rosie up.
She was alone. She had no idea how to tell her parents, her friends… What was she supposed to do now? Cambridge wanted her! She had her future planned, she was supposed to marry a nice man, have children, a house in the suburbs with a white picket fence. She was supposed to graduate this year, she was the girl every girl wanted to be and every boy wanted to be with! She was supposed to be… perfect…
“Yeah?” They both chorused.
Sherlock smiled.
Love you all, the comments, the kudos. Happy Sherlock!
I hear Rosie so I go to fetch her, she sees me and smiles, a warmth spreads over my chest and I reach for her. She immediately clings to me, little hands reach for my neck and hair, head burrowing on my neck, My heart could burst with happiness, it has done so before.
Stories and histories. Stories may be changed, histories stay as they are, stories mark people; histories, the universe; for example, in 9 out of 10 stories the Titanic sinks, in one, it arrives safely to New York; in history, the Titanic sinks and 1.500 people die.
Sherlock left the stage and ran to his dressing room, to his surprise another bouquet was waiting for him and his heart swelled at the prospect of this JW sending him more red roses. It had been almost three weeks since the show started and since the first night he'd laid eyes on JW he was smitten. Flirting back and forth for the last couple of weeks was filling him with raw need.
“John?” Mycroft lifted his head when he heard John walking down the stairs, the baby in his arms and three bags over his shoulders. John looked at him and waited “Need a lift?” Mycroft asked; his voice uncharacteristically small and insecure.
Besides... Us souls have a way of doing, of finding each other, but there is a long way to go still.
in 202 B.C. he barely saw 40.
“And I love you, John Watson, my husband” Sherlock surrendered to the kiss and before John made him moan and whimper he whispered one last word “Forever”
“You’ll have to tell him that” He managed after he swallowed and coughed.
“Fifteen. But I do those in two or three days, tops” He shrugged again and John couldn’t help but snigger. “What?” Sherlock tried to sound angry but he hadn’t enough heat in his voice and chuckled too “I get too bored. I read the material really fast. I could finish school this year if I wanted by taking exams, but I have to complete lab hours” He rolled his eyes “Mummy said she wanted for me to have the full University experience, so I’m pleasing her and the entire family by tolerating school for as long as I find it tolerable” Sherlock sighed deeply “My professors are quite pleased with my work and are willing to help me advance as fast as possible, but I have to complete the laid out plan, even if it means more boring hours than not”
“Waiting?”
“Well” John took a deep breath “Thanks for the cheating” He stood “And the coffee” he left some money on the table, but before he could leave, James stood and pulled him by the arm; John imagined it would feel like a shiver running down his spine, but it felt normal and he remembered the way the brief touch of Sherlock’s arm had felt over his entire body, he turned to looked at James and suddenly, not like in the movies, but pretty close, he felt… nothing. Yeah, this was the man he had, let’s say, loved, for over two years, they’d been together for almost two years, “made love”, had frantic sex, fought, laughed, cried, but he no longer had that spell over him.
You could hear it roaring if you pay close attention. It warms them, their joined hands, their feet that touch every now and then... They rest... timelessly.
“John…” Julia tried again but he stopped her once more.
Yes, he’d been irrationally irritable, mostly because of Rosie and the recent development in his life, and yes, he was taking the edge of his frustrations off with Sherlock; but he was committed to their relationship and he wanted it to work. He was going to therapy. Well, actually, his therapist was going to him and he would contact her whenever he felt he was about the explode
“Dicks” John muttered and grabbed two suitcases “Care to help?” He opened the flat door.
“I’m here out of concern” Mycroft said more serious “My…” He cleared his throat “Contacts…” Sherlock snorted and shook his head “Tell me you just leased two hundred and twenty one b at Baker street” He almost pursed his lips.
Headache gone, body turned to nothing. Disease? Much better, no longer lingering. JUST SHUT UP! Just shut up and let me leave, or live... which one would be this time?
"I was by the ocean, must have been, perhaps, two hundred and twenty one B... C." I smirk and wink and he laughs, his hearty laugh. I love the way he laughs, but he isn't distracted, one look and I know he's determined to hear the story.
They ended up in Liverpool, sharing beers with Liverpool fans and chatting up university girls… Long story short, the heart… well… the dick wants what the dick wants and said appendage decided to follow the girl’s back to Oxford…
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes” His mother let out in a breath.
“That he’s an idiot” John tried not to chuckle “We had to work on an analysis and the moron got it all wrong. I kept saying to him what he should look for, but he refused to listen” Sherlock huffed “It was simple, he just had to check the hands of the victim” Sherlock shook his head, dislodging John’s fingers again “He asked how I knew, so I told him I knew the same way I knew he had failed his exams twice and if he didn’t pass this time he would be out of the programme”
Harry, on the other hand, wasn’t as pleased with what he called “my little bro’s antics”. He married shortly after John came out and simply shut John away from his life “I don’t want a fag close to my offspring” He had said to John after breaking his nose. His parents defended him, but it was too late, the only real Watson, the perfect one left him a little more shattered and broken, his back against the coffee table in the middle of the living room, a bleeding broken nose, several bruised ribs and his pride turned into something non-existent.
By the year 50 B.C. Caesar has conquered Gaul and the Roman Republic is expanding to new frontiers. Caesar isn't happy though, he needs more, so off he goes and proclaims himself Emperor. By year 46 B.C. he's conquered Africa and half of Hispania.
“I was in the lab part of the afternoon. Almost since I arrived” Sherlock shook his head and his raven curls bounced all over “I read the material for tomorrow’s lectures and completed the lab hours for the week” Sherlock sighed “My experiments were successful but I got bored after four hours” He continued, as if rambling “I talked to my sister, my mum and came to the flat at around seven”
“I missed you too” Sherlock leaned close to John and kissed his forehead “Dinner?” He asked and John nodded “Italian?” John nodded again.
“Would you pretend?” Mary asked, a bit wistful and very hopeful
“Delicious” Sherlock kissed the word over John’s ear and with that, John came harder than he ever had, Sherlock’s name in his lips. Sherlock followed shortly after, John’s name tumbling from his lips like a prayer.
He hid in his brother’s flat and walked to his brother’s room, the still lingering smell of Mycroft comforting him somewhat… He reached for the little box he had in his bag and took out the syringe… “It’s over” he said to the darkness and felt his throat close up tight… He was about to push the needle in his arm when he felt a soft breeze, a “don’t” whispered to the wind… the voice sounded like Mary, Mycroft, his parents, John, all at the same time… He threw the syringe away and crushed the ampoule down with his shoe
His mind was swirling with information while Molly chatted what he considered nonsense “John offered to help Mary and pretended to be the father of the baby she was expecting, the arsehole left her when she broke the news to him” Sherlock nodded in acknowledgement “And John was so sweet…” She sighed and smiled like a love sick puppy “But he found himself engaged to Mary, unable to stop the wedding because Mr. Morstan asked him to marry Mary” Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes and nodded again. Molly continued the incessant chatter and Sherlock just hummed, nodded, smiled and occasionally would comment about the story with “oh, really?”, “no way” and “mmm, I see”. Sherlock let her talk for another half hour before excusing himself and promising Molly he’ll be at her house by eleven, an hour before the wedding.
Sherlock is the middle child “which explains everything” the doctor that tested them said. “Mycroft, your eldest, is a genius” The doctor smiled at Violet and Siger “At twelve, he has enough social skills to convince an Eskimo to buy an ice maker, or to run his own country” the doctor chuckled. “Your daughter” His eyes looked at little four year old Eurus and took a deep shaky breath “Is a genius too, and much like Mycroft, she has enough social skills to, well” the doctor scratched the back of his neck “have anyone do anything she might want to” His smile was a bit frightened and he actually shuddered when Eurus winked at him. “Sherlock, on the other hand…” The doctor said a bit… enraged. “Well, though a genius, he has the social skills of a rabid cat” The doctor almost snarled and received a glare from four of the five family members, Sherlock simply stared in the direction of the wall, counting how many breaths his father had taken, how many times his mother’s hand twitched, and just enjoying the memory of the doctor’s face when he had told him all about the nurse he had an affair with, a former male that had him convinced he was a good woman…
“The only one for me is you” Sherlock breathed out and kissed John again
John wanted to bolt his classes and go get his daughter but the professor chose that precise moment to greet him and ask him a few questions about the lecture; he was forced to stay. A few minutes later he received another text.
“How dare you say that?” John was standing in front of him, his voice low and menacing “You’ve never been a replacement to anything” his voice was trembling and rising “To anyone” He managed in a shaky breath
“She’s right” John kissed Sherlock’s cheek “You’re her Dada in many ways” He smirked and gave Sherlock a loving kiss on the lips. Sherlock just gaped and tried to connect his brain to his tongue once again, but he found himself rendered speechless by the events of the day. Sherlock stayed awake the entire night, watching both his loves sleep; he couldn’t believe how lucky he was; he had a wonderful man by his side; he had a daughter -she had pointed him as her dada- Sherlock smiled fondly at the memory; and what made everything better was that he was about to finish school.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock nodded and smiled, John just kissed him and held him close “London is definitely not London without you”
“Irene” Sherlock used his best -you prick- voice “John Watson and Rosie Watson” he pointed at the screen “John. This is Irene” he pointed to the voluptuous, obnoxious, brunette “My soon to be ex-best friend from University” He almost snarled at her when she leaned over again and her entire face covered the camera.
"Oh, love!" John touches my face softly and I feel everything melt away. Now, in this life, he's the only one.
John relented, he had no power against Sherlock’s mighty pout, he found it endearing. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him for a kiss “Fine” He said against Sherlock’s lips “But with one condition”
Mycroft was always worried about Sherlock’s condition. Victor breaking up with him proved to be dangerous; he started smoking like a chimney and Mycroft was sure he will soon turn to something more pernicious to his health, if given the slightest chance. He had to have him followed 24//7.
"Cain" chose to kill and all souls became blind to one another, only able to see the light at the sight of our mate. We're condemned to wander alone until we find each other.
The small, perfect bubble they created over the last 24 hours dissolved the moment they landed in London. A car was waiting for them to take John back to his flat and to take Sherlock to Marylebone Station. The first goodbye kiss they shared was as bittersweet as expected; more salty than either wanted to admit, as fulfilling as a goodbye kiss could be. The minute Sherlock arrived to the train station he texted John.
“Out!” She squealed and put her little palm over the window, pointing out. Sherlock gaped and John’s eyes opened wide. “Out!” She exclaimed again and banged on the window for effect. Sherlock held her tight and she fought her way off his arms to go out until Sherlock relented and she half crawled, half butt-walked her way to the door. Sherlock and John looked at each other, not knowing what to do until she demanded their attention again, her second word being “Daddy!” and pointing at John and to the door again shouting “Out!”.
“Mrs. Hudson said I could move in as soon as I see fit” Sherlock repeated, he tried his “cold and detached” strategy, to avoid the hurt of rejection, but he couldn’t keep the hope from his eyes.
“I could transfer” Sherlock was looking at Rosie with such intensity that made John’s heart leap on his chest.
“It’s more than loyalty” John rolled his eyes “It’s called love; perhaps you should practice it” John walked away from Mycroft and went to look for his daughter.
“Of course I am!” John blurted without thinking.
Much like the hand holding, the first kiss was as spectacular as accidental. The top of the Eiffel tower, the sunset in front of them, a push, a pull, one look up, one look down, the pull of the magnets and two sets of lips meeting and melting against each other; it had never felt so right to kiss that way. In his inexperience, Sherlock managed to give John a wonderful first kiss, lips coming together the way they belonged, tongues dancing in perfect synchronicity, breaths coming and going rhythmically. John gave Sherlock a perfect kiss, by demonstrating that there was no awkwardness in the lack of knowledge, no reason to laugh, no lesson to teach, no lead to follow.
Two versions again!
John simply huffed and left the room, leaving Bill and the gang laughing their hearts out; he’d had to endure a whole day of jokes at his expense, because the young lady he had spent the night with was a screamer… he had barely touched her and she was already moaning like she was about to orgasm… Bloody teenagers…
“This is Angelo” Sherlock finally managed, Angelo finally greeting John.
“Sherlock” the man said and patted his back repeatedly “Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and your date”
“I miss her too” Sherlock kissed the baby’s fringe and she sighed happily, finally fast asleep.
Always get lost with verbs and actions... FOCUS!
“Would you ever tell me what happened?” John asked as he grabbed Sherlock’s waist and pulled him impossibly closer
The ceremony was short, Rosie was the flower girl; Molly and Greg were their witnesses, Mrs. Hudson and Angelo were there as their parents, Harry was back with Clara and in rehab for the last seven months, James and Mike congratulated them. Mike hugged John, James hugged Sherlock and the little event was soon over
It was written.
“This” John read the papers all over again “King’s?” He was processing the information still.
“This man got me off a murder charge” Angelo kept his chatter.
At sixteen, he couldn’t deny it anymore, he had done some research, he had dated a few girls and after seven glorious minutes in heaven, in the same closet, in the same basement, with James, he realised he liked boys much more than he liked girls, and all he wanted to do was keep on kissing those dry lips accompanied by a light stubble on the jaw line, feel those strong hands on his hair, giving him a dishevelled look and have that restless tongue all over the place, or better yet, all over him… John faced his new reality and accepted, for the second time in his life, that he would never be “a real Watson”
John approached him holding a huge delphinium in his hands, the lyrics continued and Sherlock’s brain started dissecting the plant, the lyrics and John.
… They rocked together, the world making sense again. John moved, slowly at first, his mouth hungry for Sherlock’s skin, Sherlock’s hand finding solace in every inch of John’s skin he could reach…
Amazing lyrics by Shirley Bassey and three wonderful performances:
In the morning he prepares his parcels and goes to the well-known route; but today, today he has a new client and he can't be happier, he'll get the chance to see where Paulla, daughter of Livia, lives. As he gets close to the house he hears the lute, and his heart stops. His pulse quickens and he feels like he's floating. The music runs through his body igniting his blood, heart bursting with joy, eyes filled with happy tears. He walks in a trance and catches a glimpse of unruly raven curls, he thinks is Paulla, but when he sees her sitting close to the yard, he looks away from her and concentrates on the angel playing joyful sounds.
“Alors? Mamie looked the same way and her eyes locked in Rosie for a brief moment before turning to Sherlock again.
“I had to…” Sherlock closed his eyes and hugged him tighter “I’m sorry, but I had to… We wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t…” Sherlock breathed John for the first time in months
Mycroft sighed, relieved, not because his brother wasn’t having sex, though in a way he was glad he hadn’t rushed to it, but because John loved his brother enough to not force or rush him; he was willing to wait, as long as needed, for Sherlock to be ready and take that step in their relationship.
“So this is really it…” John could feel his heart breaking and void taking over his stomach and numbness taking his limbs. Sherlock felt the exact same way… He wanted to run, hide, get away from there, but at the same time he wanted to hold John; tell him he loved him; hug him and kiss him, John wanted to do the exact same thing… Sherlock tried to nod, to shake his head; to move, do something to stop what he was sure was going to happen. John could see his hesitation and asked again “Is it really over?”
“Italian. There’s new place over Northumberland Street” He smirked and John looked at him suspiciously.
Sherlock just nodded; his eyes on Rosie all the time. Molly eyed him wickedly and before he knew it, she thrusted the baby in his arms and ran to the door. Baffled, completely out of his mind, he rushed after her and all Molly did was wave goodbye. “See you at three” She shouted and ran down the street.
“He’s brilliant, an awesome friend, he makes you laugh, he keeps you happy, he has manged the distance, and we know you, you’re desperate to be just with him” Mike wiggled his eyebrows and John blushed, hiding his smile with an annoyed eye roll.
He had seen him and his mind was filled with information; suit £2000, shoes £700, shirt £400, watch £3000, silk tie £450, tie pin £5000, ring-less fingers, over twenty five but under thirty, clever, a doctor, probably a surgeon, bisexual, of course -he had seen him eyeing the brunette waitress the first time he’d come to see the show- but his face was unreadable, he’ll direct a polite smile to those who greeted him, he would address the waitresses with the same plastered smile, but he had something that made Sherlock’s body writhe under his gaze, the lick to the lips that would give Sherlock the best wank fantasies, and nothing else… the stranger, this JW was a mystery…
“I was invited” Sherlock ignored the jab and continued looking for clues, he had the case almost solved, it was the usual, a spat between friends, things got heated and the murderer acted in the heat of the moment, blunt force trauma to the head and then rearranged the body to make it look as if he had fallen on the shower.
When John’s turn came he talked about his days at medical school, his days at the army, James, how he felt when Sherlock left, the void and the self-consuming rage, how Mary had saved him, how he really felt when Sherlock returned and his fear of losing everything again if he didn’t act as he was supposed to, how much he hated Sherlock, but just because he was feeling guilty too, how much his love for Rosie had made him realise how much he loved Sherlock, and just how sorry he was for leaving Sherlock on his own for so long. He apologised profusely but Sherlock didn’t want to hear it.
“You mean?” Sherlock took a deep breath.
“Coming, dear!” Bill and Mike replied and laughed all the way down to the car. Sherlock just watched the interaction, feeling conflicted; he was happy to have John move in with him, but at the same time, he knew Mike and Bill were important to John and had been there for him for the last two years and for the past six months they’d been helping him with Rosie, school and many other things.
“Call me” Sherlock leaned close and kissed John’s cheek. John nodded and closed his eyes, he could feel his heart thumping in his chest and his eyes fill with tears “I’ll miss you” Sherlock whispered and held him closer, the least he wanted was leave, much less now that he knew how it felt to be with Sherlock for 24 hours, just the two of them, minding Rosie, going to dinner, having breakfast, sleeping in the same bed…
We soulmates are whispers to the ear, a voice that says no, a last thought, a last word...
"Where to?"
I feel relaxed, that's a first, watching Rosie too, concentrating on her helps with the sudden flashbacks. John sighs and I know he's thinking about the dreams. Ever since we "opened" our eyes -with a memorable first kiss- we've been sharing dreams.
Sherlock arrived to his brother’s house around 10 pm, the first thing he wanted to do was text John, but wasn’t sure, instead he texted Irene and she “suggested” -more like forced- Sherlock to write to John and thank him for the lovely evening.
By fifteen, her heart broke again when she found out Sherlock liked boys too and she wanted to cut her wrists when Sherlock had introduced Victor Trevor as his boyfriend. In time, by seventeen, she accepted her faith and her focus went to Sherlock’s older brother, Mycroft, who had recently broken up with long-time girlfriend Anthea, she found him interesting and charming and she wanted him like she had never wanted anyone. She discovered, with that crush, that she liked older men, and when Mary had told her all about the cute constable that picked her up from James’ house, she made her goal to have him.
They smiled at each other and started a new routine, getting baby Rosie ready for the day. First the morning cuddles and cooing, followed by words of love and prises for being such a wonderful girl and not crying, followed by a nappy change performed by both… something managed a bit awkwardly the first four times but perfected in time whenever they met and had to change Rosie. They changed her into the morning onesie, the one that looked like a bee, which Sherlock had bought for her during their stay in France.
He managed to create a few relationships along the way; Sebastian Wilkes was a dick but an important asset because he surrounded himself with people with the means to procure information. Irene was a great asset too, and he could call her “friend” She’d been there when Victor broke it off and was a constant company to keep him distracted. She was also to thank for not allowing him to indulge in unsavoury situations such as cocaine use and certain abuse. Her girlfriend, Kate was to be considered a friend too. Her sweet demeanour always managed to get the best of Irene, even though she could be as wicked as the devil.
As soon as they arrived to Orleans, a beautiful woman -looking like an older version of Eurus- greeted them.
Sherlock felt his heart stop and start beating fast, running like a wild horse inside his chest and his stomach wildly competing with the best swimmers for a perfect 10.0 somersault. The world went silent around him and he couldn’t keep his eyes off of John; his entire world suddenly brighter just because the man he had dreamt for the last month was standing right there in front of him.
They left Angelo’s with a simple goodbye and stood awkwardly at the door. Sherlock lifted his hand and as magically as everything he does, he summoned a cab “Want this one?” Sherlock asked, not looking at John.
“My dear” His mother hugged him close and John felt the familiar comfort of her arms.
Life the next four months went by pretty much the same. John was working and had been accepted to work at Saint Bart’s, better pay than at the surgery; he had rugby practices twice a week and helped Sherlock with a few cold cases. Sherlock, on the other hand, had managed to get Lestrade a raise and a better office and the offer for a promotion if he continued the good work. He helped him solve crimes and chase criminals.
As soon as Rosie fell asleep, they shared their meal and talked as if the hadn’t talked for months, even though they had talked last night. They kissed like thirsty men in the desert enjoying water for the first time in days and they snuggled close in the bed until they both fell asleep. Rosie woke them up for her night feeding. John couldn’t wait for her to finally sleep through the night, but all the doctors, paediatricians, teachers, everyone, had told him he’ll have to wait at least another two months before she finally slept through the night.
“Okay. When?”
Then another.
By seeing...
“He’s in London!” Sherlock gave another excuse.
Sherlock pouted and grimaced remembering John was still three days and five hours away from him, from them… He was pondering about what would be wisest -if following John to the conference, or calling his mum for help, maybe Mrs. Hudson could do something, or he just could leave them for a few minutes and have a cigarette to calm down, no not that, never that, not again, he had promised John- when Rosie came barging in complaining about her bee disappearing and needing his help. He picked Hamish for the umpteenth time, rocking him back and forth over his shoulder, before following his daughter to the living room to locate the blasted bee…
"Because we had just misses each other" I reply quietly; he sighs again so I decide to tell the story. "My first ever memory of being near you..." I look up and stare at the ceiling for long seconds, reach for my tea with measured movements, as if I were in my Mind Palace, wandering; he believes me, my sweet John, I'm afraid of him finding out why all this happened to us.
“My deodorant?” Anderson looked confused.
“I could get you some off time” Sherlock suggested.
“This man got me off a murder charge” Angelo kept his chatter.
John took his time preparing Sherlock, he did it slowly, knowing how much it might hurt if he wasn’t ready enough; he had experience with that. He shook his head to get rid of the memory and concentrated on his lover, the gorgeous man that trusted him with his life, his body, his soul, and most of all, his heart.
“They might” Mary held him close “After all, I’ve spent here a few nights” She kissed his cheek and held his face in her hands “I know how important James is for you” Her eyes filled with tears and John hugged her, inhaling deeply her violet soap scent. “I’m sorry” She muttered to John’s shoulder and John’s arms tightened around her “I tried to talk to him” She told John’s neck.
Anger
“I cleared it a bit” Sherlock chuckled.
The real lesson to be learnt is that our lives are not our own.
With Rosie settled comfortably in her carrier and snuggled close to Sherlock’s chest, they moved to the kitchen to get lunch ready; every ten or so minutes John would check his clock and would glance anxiously at Sherlock who seemed more relaxed, but the tension was evident in his jaw, his back, his hands, the way he moved as if uncomfortable with his clothes, as if they were itchy, or how he passed trembling fingers over his already tousled locks to hide the hand tremors.
“Sherlock…” John used a warning tone.
“You called me Bee” He chuckled “Have to go, Bug. Miss you”
Souls have memories, old memories that usually come to our minds in a rush. We remember a specific taste or smell, or have the memory of touch or sight. Memories of past lives.
Sherlock was done. He packed a bag, went down the stairs and walked out the flat, not looking back. As he climbed in the cab he received a text, it was him, with the same excuse ‘late because of work’, but Sherlock knew better… John had been receiving texts at odd hours, coming back late from work and had picked a new annoying way to get rid of Sherlock, blaming him for Mary’s death…
“John?” Sherlock put his hand over John’s and John shook his head and started laughing hard “What?” Sherlock frowned and looked at him angrily.
“This was staged” Sherlock rapid-fired and walked past John, brushing his shoulder with his arm and feeling how his body tingled at the small contact, he heard John’s breath hitch and felt a little victorious at noticing the boy was interested in him. He could barely breath, he felt his heart beat fast in his chest, a caged animal trying to run free, a shiver down his spine and the want to kiss those lips, to have his hands travel all over the body in front of him.
John agreed to meet at the coffee shop, it wasn’t a rare occurrence. Greg usually invited him for coffee, talked a lot about Molly, Rosie and… Sherlock; it was the only way he had to find about the young man, mostly because he was a bit of a coward and had no idea how to start a conversation with him.
“How did it go?” John grabbed his hand and started walking to the tube station to go back home.
My "horse"... the horse. How many years does it have now? Thousands, I think... That was the first time I made an attempt to "write" about him and what he had done to the horse... "Experiment" ha called it... Suffice to say it ended up a wonderful red...
“Don’t” He walked away and locked himself in his room. John followed, he knew he should and as soon as the door hit his face, he went to the bathroom and entered Sherlock’s room, he walked to the door and stood there. If Sherlock wanted to leave, he’ll have to go through him… John was ready to fight…
I hear him coming up the stairs, he's bought milk, not a trying day, good mood, he's whistling our tune... Good day to talk...
Greg, in his grief, invited John and pretended to bump into Sherlock. That was an absolute failure.
“He knows” Sherlock shrugged
“There’s an invitation on your bedside table. It has an HW on it and also several wine stains on the side from different days. You didn’t stain it because you don’t drink, but your brother does and it’s straining his relationship with his wife, your mother is probably worried that she’ll ask for divorce” Sherlock looked at the side and John picked his nephew’s christening invitation.
“Yes…”
He says hi to me with that smile and kisses my forehead, then sits right in front of me and he knows, he always knows...
, nothing more, nothing for him to process or think.
“Lord Holmes?” John chuckled, amused, Sherlock simply nodded and John removed the contents from the envelope “You’re joking, right?” John kept on reading “And all those zeroes?”
“I could take the advanced exams and finish early” Sherlock was leaning on the door frame, looking at John intently.
“Close your eyes, have no fear, the monster’s gone…” He scoffed at the thought.
“So am I” John’s smile grew wider and he grabbed both Sherlock’s hands and kissed them “So…”
Washing the dishes and buying milk.
“Thank you” Sherlock whispered.
It was a sweet surrender, and they both were more than willing to fall apart together. Sleep found them in a tangled mess of limbs, arms and legs, fingers, mouths, dark curls and sandy hair. Food forgotten; nothing needed more than each other and what had just happened between them; that sensation of fullness and completeness filling their veins and making their hearts beat as one.
“Not really, you only work while you’re in school because the Doctor at the surgery is your teacher and he could give you the week off easily” Sherlock answered and bit his lip; he wasn’t supposed to know that.
“What are you talking about, are you inventing stuff about me again?” Anderson approached Sherlock, and he stood taller.
BTW, sorry if this chapter offends anybody, I don't mean any disrespect to religious beliefs or faith, I just write with a certain historic accuracy... I love history...
“Cons first?” Sherlock nodded and barely contained a groan “Rosie is six months old” John started
“What did John say?”
“See you, Bee”
“Thank you, Bumble” Sherlock pinked to his ears and kept on holding his brother. They arrived to Mycroft’s flat and Sherlock practically bolted from the car, leaving Mycroft behind, shaking his head with affection.
“Six hours?” John was truly baffled now “How many lab hours you have a week?” He stared, wide eyed.
Here he is, finally! Which century? Nineteen something? No? Yes? Hundred more? Hundred less? Eighteen something? Sixty? Ninety?
“Fine” Sherlock huffed “But I have my own terms” Sherlock pulled John close and John melted into the embrace.
“That’s it?” John tried not to laugh. Sherlock was too nervous, everything was so new and he had to remind himself, constantly that Sherlock had a brain that works in overtime.
“I know” John whispered, kissing him again “No need for words”
Mycroft followed them closely; he had time to get to know little Rosie and grow attached to her; John was unique and Mycroft could see his brother becoming a good man, he knew it was John’s doing, the way he doted on his brother was fantastic, exactly what Sherlock needed. One thing nagged him, though, the lack of physical… activities… between them. Anthea handed him a full report on their non-existent sexual life; he was willing to humiliate himself and find about what was happened between them, but his questions were answered a few days after his impromptu visit and the image he couldn’t shake from his memory, though he also had it well-hidden on his mobile.
He saw him arrive and his heart started to thump in his chest, he could feel his lungs beg for air and he had to concentrate. He had arrived, once more, to see him perform, he just hoped he stayed and introduce himself… He looked a bit tired, but the minute his eyes landed on Sherlock, he smiled and clearly relaxed.
“I thought you and Anthea had broken up and you were dating Alicia Smallwood” Sherlock changed the subject abruptly and studied his brother more closely “Are you dipping the wick in already used wax?” Sherlock smirked and Mycroft scowled.
“But it’s easier” Sherlock looked at John, confused.
The tummy ache -which soon escalated to full vomiting and fever- was diagnosed as rotavirus. They stayed with her in hospital for a few hours until the doctors had calmed her down; after that, they each took turns to stay up with her while the other rested for the next four days. No cases, no studying, no working, just Rosie. Their entire life is wrapped in hers.
“Got the car?” John asked and walked to the kitchen to grab his favourite mug, he tried to act as nonchalant as possible, he already had an uncomfortable morning, Mike and Bill had teased him relentlessly all night, he went to Tesco to buy a couple of suitcases and get some boxes and while he packed, Bill and Mike teased him about their first night together, about the love nest and other things, including having safe sex “You already have one kid, you don’t want another so soon” and “enjoy the honeymoon phase, in five months you’ll be like an old married couple”, John just rolled his eyes and continued packing.
“I don’t want to rush things with him…” John fiddled with his fork.
“Talk to him” Mrs. Hudson gave him a hard look.
“So…” Sherlock smiled.
“Oh, my boy” She cooed and smiled at him “Your plans were to ask him…” She bit her lip in that Holmesian way that identified them “And I interrupted and now he’s not answering” She tried not to laugh “He’s hurt because he planned your stay” She patted Sherlock’s cheek softly and Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes but he hadn’t the energy “When is he free?” She asked and Sherlock looked at her questioningly.
John was thinking the same, it was inevitable, more now than ever given the fact they were living together, they’ll have to plan something, maybe lunch instead of diner, give them time to share with Rosie, be distracted by her. He also knew that at some point their parents would have to meet, a maybe their siblings. He was confident enough that the Holmes will be great no matter the situation, but his parents; it was more an issue of the Holmes liking the Watsons and not the other way around.
His heart was aching, he had no idea how he was going to survive, but he let his anger and frustration fuel him, the least he wanted was to see John Watson, the man he had given his life for and had received nothing but disdain in return. He pulled out his phone again and swiped the call of the screen, John kept calling him…
“Elaborate?” John tried not to chuckle
“One of the nurses got careless. I liked it. Messy, though. People are so breakable…” The word hit him like a ton of bricks, but at the same time it made him feel complete, for the first time in his life… He belonged
The “kidnapping” happened on moving day. John headed to the Holmes’ manor, leaving Sherlock with his friends to unload and unpack; he wanted to enter his new home with Rosie in his arms, together, with Sherlock by his side; he wanted to decided where to place the cot with Rosie in his arms -ever the romantic- John went in search of his -their?- daughter.
“So?” Bill jabbed John in the ribs.
“So…” John licked his lips and blushed a very cute shade of red.
it... Being Sherlock Holmes), a comic relief (Go Mrs. H!!), a fool (Anderson, turn around... you lower the IQ of the entire street); and off course, the main character, death.
“Don’t miss the opportunity just because you’re scared” She insisted “Besides, Victor is an arse”
“It’s not her fault” Sherlock frowned and John couldn’t help but laugh.
“She?” He needed to ask, just as much as he needed confirmation that his sister was just assuming
“She was cute” Bill shrugged, and before John could say anything else, he added, “and you had fun too, Watson... Captain... never heard anyone scream as much as yours did last night… almost killed my mojo”, Bill snickered.
“I…” Sherlock took a deep breath and John just held him.
“Lube” John demanded, leaving his naked body shuddering and wanting more. A shaky hand pointed to the bedside table and John smiled hungrily. When John returned, after a long eternity, he looked at Sherlock and the lust had given way to love, admiration, adoration, a bit of fear and uncertainty. Sherlock reached for his face and smiled up at him. That was all John needed before he was kissing him hungrily again…
“She’d like to meet you too” Sherlock was hopeful “Would you like to come to France?”
“Moving out” John answered in a clipped tone.
“I will” John answered, he would wait a lifetime if it meant he could be with Sherlock.
he sighed and closed his eyes, trying to file away the man with the blue eyes.
Sherlock was… distraught… yeah, that’s the correct term, he was distraught. Hamish had been crying for over an hour and he was being driven up the wall by his incessant cries. But the worst part was that he was alone; John was at a medical conference, away in Glasgow, over five hours away by train, for the next four days…
“You, frigid bitch” Anderson held Sherlock by his collar and Sherlock looked at him impassively. In that moment John made his appearance and walked in the room.
He was also glad that because of Mary’s death -not that he was glad she died- he was able to meet John. After the interview, he couldn’t help but admire his bravery and his sense of duty; he was baffled by the story and even more so when John asked not to tell Rosie’s grandparents that the baby wasn’t his. With Mycroft’s help, Greg had managed to avoid any unpleasant requests from the baby’s father.
“No”, Sherlock pouted and held him closer.
Unlike other children, Sherlock is different, he truly is. The IQ test they had given him when he was five had certified him as a genius with the social skills of a one year old, the next test, at seven, turned even better, he was sent to a special school but his lack of social interest signified a great deal of suffering both for him and his family; the only thing keeping him together, slightly well centred, is Victor, they’d been friends for ever, since they met in special school. Victor has improved Sherlock’s behaviour… mildly… mostly towards him, allowing him to be close.
"Rache."
Sherlock looked at the screen of his phone and clutched it in his hand waiting for an answer.

“Boring or not, you have to finish them” John argued back.
John gaped at the man and Sherlock smiled, pleased “I’m not his date” John managed to say and Sherlock frowned; he meant to say “I’m his boyfriend, but the man kept on smiling and talking.
