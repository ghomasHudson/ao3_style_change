A smallish woman , around sixty years old answered the door , with a pretty purple dress on . “Hello there I’m Dr Hudson , the one to see through you’re time here , would you please follow me to my office “ She politely asked him in a quaint but professional tone.  John nodded . Three times seemed the correct amount to then. He went to close the door behind him . The voice within his mind began to force him again . Twelve times he did it . Twelve times , the perfect number , except it wasn’t ...
As they pulled into the subway car park Sherlock stirred , he blinked a few times getting the sleep out from the corner of his eyes , and sat up . "Where are we ?" He asked the two boys in the front seats who seemed to be arguing . Jim whipped around looking at the sleepy Sherlock behind him .  " Subway , but we just found out between us we have only about £100" to last us the entirety of hopefully forever "?he answered. Sherlock glanced into his bag seeing the stack of notes his rich annoying brother had given him as a bribe ." I FUCKING FUCK have money so we should be fine " he smiled . His shoulder jumping up several times . "Okay then let's get some food " John said , his gloved hand reaching for the door handle he had aggressively wiped down before opening. Sherlock and Jim exited the car waiting for John who had to open and close the door ten times before exiting . "CLEAN FREAK , CLEAN FREAK " Sherlock shouted jus hand running over his tired face after . John growled beginning to walk towards the food place . Jim and Sherlock followed , watching the little man march on forewords as if it was his mission to get a samwitch . "Jim " Sherlock began " can you order for me , I'll just tick and freak the guy out mid order " Sherlock asked , his teeth clicking and shoulder jumping straight after as if to raise his point . Jim
Instead of returning to his overly white clinical room , Sherlock began wandering around the centre , not really sure on where he was heading . Then he noticed a large oak tree towering over a bench like a giant over a boy . Then he saw that it overlooked a playground full of children behind the steel fenced prison which he was in . Sherlock perched on the bench just to calm his racetrack of a mind . His arms suddenly flung out and slapped his chest again . He hated that tic !
It took Sherlock rather too long to realise where Jim had ran off too , and ran towards the nearest bathroom as soon as reality hit him . The sound of vomiting hit him as soon as he entered the baby blue bathroom . The stench of death followed . Sherlock stood silently outside the door trying to fighter out what to say to the poor anorexic boy , he had offended. Jim gasped for a minute emerging from the cold toilet bowl , after throwing up most of the contents of his constricted stomach . He then shoved his skeletal fingers into his throat again , still feeling as bloated as ever . Jim heaved nothing coming up . Sherlock rapped his fingers upon the turquoise door , needing to intervene before the poor boy caused himself serious damage. “ Jim , I’m sorry can you come out here , please stop - he paused to tic a weird squeaky noise - please stop doing that your so skinny honestly it was only a tic “ he said considerately . Jim lifted his heavy head and red rimmed eyes and slightly smiled at the taller boys words . Maybe , just maybe he was a person to trust . Jim unlocked the door -disheveled hair and face flushed - and smiled at Sherlock . The depressed anorexic smiled again , for the second time that day because of the curly haired stranger .
Angered and feeling cornered , John stormed from the room , the words stabbing into his heart like tiny daggers . He grasped the brass door handle and opened the door to storm out . But the ever present voice in his hand forced him to remain with the still shouting man until he opens and closed the door twelve times . When John left and waited exactly twelve seconds he emerged into the room for barely a second and shouted “ and for the record I’m 5’6 not a dwarf “ and exited again .
At four o clock Jim was sweating like an idiot , he turned around after hearing utter silence for  an hour and noticed Sherlock and John were asleep ; John was snoring slightly but amazingly Sherlock was dead Silent , not even slightly moving in his sleep . He must have been knackered Jim thought to himself . He smiled at the opportunity to cool down as he noticed an empty lay-by in a wooded area to the side of the road . He slowly pulled the car over , careful not to wake the sleeping men in the car .  And stepped out into the sunshine . He walked into the wood , stumbling over the tree trunks , hearing the birds chirp in the sun . His skin felt like it was on fire and his throat was dryer than the Sahara desert . After ten minutes he noticed a small lake hidden in the tree sea . Jim quickly glanced around making sure nobody followed him and nobody could see his gigantic slashed body . He pulled the hoodie off from over his head , revealing to the empty wilderness his cut up arms and rolled up his way too baggy jeans up to his ankles , taking off his converse shoes . He placed his feet into the cool water sighing with relief at the serenity of it all , and began to wade in deeper . He cupped the fresh water in his hand and started to wash the scabbed up cuts on his arms clearing the dry blood off , to avoid infection . He winced as his fingertips scraped over the gashes but he knew dying from an infection was not the way he wanted to go ; he wanted it to be instant . He bent down to poor the cooling water over his face and head , and felt his oil pool eyes cloud over with tiny diamonds , revealing to him how weak his body was getting . Jim slowly stood back up from the knee high water , he smiled knowing there was probably not much longer for him  . One last adventure he thought longingly . He wondered back to the river bank to sit down , feeling extremely light headed . When his non existent bum hit the muddy bank he felt something hard in his back pocket . He reached into it and grabbed an old Nokia brick his brother had given him in case of emergencies. When he switched it on he found there was twenty missed calls and five messages . Four of them was his brother asking if he was okay and that Dr Hudson has called him in a panic . He answered him with a single word "yes" that should put the worrier at peace . The last one was from Dr Hudson (Richard must have given her his number ) it read ' Jim i know you have my car , I'm not going to press charges , just make sure you eat and I want it back as soon as possible ' . Jim laughed wondering why Dr Hudson was so calm . Then he heard a gasp behind him followed by Sherlock Ticcing ;" DOCTORS EAT SHIT SAMWITCHES ON TUESDAY " . He whipped around , suddenly self conscious of his cut up arms , yet his face burst into a giggle from the profound weirdness of Sherlock's tic . "What Time is it ?" He asked quickly pulling back on the hoodie , not even wincing at the pain of wet cuts on cotton . "Six " Sherlock said his eyes transfixed on Jim's arms . " Stop staring" Jim whispered." Where's Mr clean freak ?". Sherlock pointed towards a rock which John was stood pissing on . Jim laughed at Johns gloved hands curled around his quite proud penis . " I think we should rest here for the night " He smiled , " also I have something that could help with your tics " he whispered so John couldn't hear them . He pulled out a small baggies of weed and a lighter , a smile on his face . Sherlock laughed yet agreed ; anything to stop the constant irratiability of his condition . " I also got sombreros in my bag because you never know when you'll need them " he laughed .
Mycroft went in with him into dr Hudson’s office the second they got there , yet obviously he was more distracted by his phone . Typical couldn’t the British government just listen for one second . Sherlock tried to concentrate upon her quaint voice as twitches began hijacking his body once again . He hummed like a baby cat painfully pulling his neck . His thoughts spiralled as she really did try to concentrate but when the twitches took ahold of him , Sherlock began imagining how different his life would be if his mother never began to poison her body . Morbid thoughts aside , Sherlock missed his mother with all his heart .
“ I assure you I shall speak to them before they arrive . However it is up to you whether you all get along “ She replied . They walked up fifty sparkling stairs , John counted each one just to make sure it was right .
Sherlock whipped behind him his head ticking to the side as he turned . His eyes landed on a grinning Jim who seemed quite happy with his little stunt . "JESUS!" Sherlock involuntarily shouted . Jim slipped a cigarette out of the back pocket of his trousers and lit it with an unusually pink lighter . "They give the depressed lighters isn't that dangerous ?" Sherlock laughed . Jim took another drag of his fag and shook his skeletal head . Sherlock waited for an answer but his ticks made me shout again , as a parade of swear words left his mouth as his left hand painfully hit his chest . Jim's face didn't show an ounce of sympathy and Sherlock's contoured face may have slightly amused his sadistic emotions yet again . Sherlock waited for the roll of empathy to escape Jim but nothing appeared . " Presumed Empathy disorder" Jim whispered , sounding slightly embarrassed by his lack of feelings . Sherlock smiled and gestured for Jim to give him a drag of the cigarette his hand ticking slightly as he did it . Jim lifted it to Sherlock's  mouth smiling as the taller man actually coughed from a single drag . Sherlock's arm shot out and hit Jim's recent cuts yet again but this Time his tic was much harder and the sheer amount of pressure made a trickle of blood run down from under the t shirt sleeve and down his arm . Jim didn't notice the blood pooling down his  arm until Sherlock jumped . "Jim you're bleeding like EMO FUCK sorry but look" he shouted inwardly cursing himself for the inappropriate tic. Jim's blank eyes glanced down towards the blood following his bone structure down his arm . He didn't register Sherlock's unintentional insult , he just didn't really care . He noticed a black hoodie wrapped around Sherlock's waist and he figured out how to get past the guards . "Since that technically was your fault I need that hoodie " he blurted out . Sherlock hesitated then gave the hoodie blindly to the little Irish man . Jim laughed as the six foot three londener's hoodie reached down to his knees and how the sleeves reached past his fingertips . "So twitchy boy, you wanna take me back to our room !"
Sherlock slowly emerged from the bed looking agast at Jim's manic features ."What about John?" He whispered . His shoulder jumped up as he asked the question . Jim glanced at the sleeping John , who looked almost peaceful as he slept . " I think John thinks this shithole will actually help him " he laughed . Sherlock giggled deciding that escaping could be what he needed , away from Mycroft and it gave him a chance to give his mother what he knew she wanted . "Let's go" he smiled .
John bolted from his bed , utterly confuse at the scenario in front of him . Sherlock seemed to be having a seizure or something , whilst Jim stood there a small smile on his face , totally frozen . John jumped into action , and ran to Sherlock's side . He pulled a pair of latex gloves from the side , before touching the boy upon the floor . "SHIT , NO NO NO " the fallen man screamed as Johns now protected hands grasped his arms stopping Sherlock from hurting himself. " Calm down , Calm down , Calm down " John whispered managing to stop at three repetitions . " Just try and breathe I presume this will pass I'll be right next to you " he said . John felt that wasn't enough and followed through with the compulsion repeating the past three words 11 more times .
Sherlock was led up the harsh silver metal stairs towards his new room as Dr Hudson described details of where he was staying . Sherlock just nodded and occasionally ticked random nonsense, constantly embarrassed by his unwilling outbursts . “ wait I forgot do you have a phone ?” Dr Hudson asked him . “ yes I do !” He ticked , his voice higher than usual “No no I don’t “ Sherlock quickly said . He looked towards the small woman hoping she’d understand that it was merely a tic . She apparently did , judging from her smile and posture , “ good because they are forbidden” she continued. Then the two walked in silence until they reached his new abode .
. A saddened look upon his face as his own brother winced as he ticked upon him whilst hugging him goodbye ( his leg jumping up and a whistling noise leaping from his mouth ) . “Christmas?” Mycroft announced . Sherlock repeated and walked back into the centre .
Nodded understandably,opening the door to the fast food restaurant. When they entered John was already ordering his face red as he repeated that he wanted a foot long turkey sub for the 12th time . A young woman was behind the till , her name tag read Molly , her face looked confused but her face was pinned into a pleasant smile as she began making his samwitch. " What do you want " Jim asked Sherlock , "Chicken tikka with FUCK cheese " he answered his head buried into his pyjama top. Jim smiles and gestured for Sherlock to find a place to sip . He walked towards the till as Sherlock sat at the furthest table in the ghost town of a subway . " Hi " Jim began his stomach grumbled as he began ordering but he ignored it completely . " just one chicken tikka sub with cheese and umm a Diet Coke and a child's salad " , the salad was only 60 calories he should be fine , if he didn't eat it all . Milky smiled and began making the food , after giving John his samwitch . " Are you sure you don't want anything else you look hungry " Molly said concerned . Jim violently shook his head waiting for the food then paying the woman .
Sherlock entered on his own he didn’t really want Dr Hudson announcing him , he wasn’t really sure why , but this way he felt more comfortable. Sherlock entered the pristine room , his violins fingers hidden under the cuffs of his grey trench-coat . Two men around his age were talking upon white beds . The room just felt clinical , especially with the stench of bleach . He cleared his throat ,surprised his tics were staying at bay ,  the two young men turned around and looked at their final roommate.” Hello I’m Sherlock  “ he announced almost timidly .
Dr Hudson lead him into her office . Thankfully her items were arranged in straight lines and no dust clouded the room . She motioned for him to sit upon the black leather sofa in the room . John did so , with a quick inspection for dust , because that could cause illness . He knew that . He’d always known that . He sat upon the sofa near the edge , as Dr Hudson pulled up a black chair , around sixty inches from where he was . “ Hello can you please tell me why you think you are here John , I’ve spoken to Mary before you arrived but I’d like to hear your side of the story “ She spoke reassuringly.
Richard was bringing his little brother to doctor rose after he almost died , after he had found Jim's quivering skeletal body on his bathroom floor , wrists slashed like he was in some sort of horror flick . It pained him to see Jim's undernourished bleeding body but it pained Richard more as he saw the everlasting grin on his brothers face as unconsciousness took him prisoner and he thought he was dead . Although he didn't see Richard sobbing whilst ringing for help
John stood up to storm from the room , an OCD whirlwind trampling his rationality . He ran to the door ready to exit but once again he was unable to do one simple task . He slammed the door once , hoping that gorgeous feeling of relief would flood through him , but no that wasn't enough . It was never enough! His angry exit was transformed into an OCD meltdown. He slammed the door twelve times , feeling the countless eyes all on him . But then he was out . The feeling of disgust and contamination still filled every inch of him . John ran as fast as a cheetah to the nearest bathroom ...
Screaming and shouts could be heard from the end of the hall way as Sherlock made his way to the door of his room . "I saw you putting the bottle in John!" A female workers voice shouted as Sherlock entered the pristine room . The worker was black with a button nose and curls in her hair net . She was a nurse's uniform and smiled at Sherlock as he awkwardly stuck both his middle fingers up at her with a tic . Within one of her gloved hands she held a bottle of vodka , she touched the smaller boy as he went to grab the vodka from her hand .
Sherlock began quietly throwing his belongings into the huge duffel bag he brought with him . Jim grabbed the rucksack he had yet to unpack and fondled with the razor in his back pocket as he waited for Sherlock .
Sherlock freaked what is Jim was to react like his own brother . He jumped backwards scared of what the Irish boy was to say . Jim stood a metre away from Sherlock and just smiled . " Stop panicking cracker boy , and thank you " he smirked , washing his face in the nearest sink . Sherlock smiled 'what a random nickname' he thought to himself . Sherlock shoulder jumped as he admired the Irish boy in the graffitied mirror above the sink . Jim noticed Sherlock's eyes gazing upon him and his heart flutter within his chest . "Come on then , let's go see what mr clean is up too " he laughed . The two young men opened the door ready to forget the past events -if they could . Unsuspectedly , they walked straight into Dr Hudson and a burly looking mn with a grisly disappointed look upon his face . Dr Hudson stared straight into the two boys eyes , as they looking guilty and confused. " Jim you are aware our facilities are monitored by cameras to assure your safety  ?" Dr Hudson said eyes not leaving Jim's face . Jim's. Face set into its accustomed mask but his skin turned deathly pale . He shrugged . Sherlock noticed the sweat beads beginning to form again upon the Irish mans head . Suddenly he ticked "NAZI OFFICERS!" out of nowhere directing Dr Hudson's attention towards him . "Sherlock you can go I have to talk to Jim about his little stunt just now in the bathroom " She said ushering him away . Jim flashed Sherlock an adorably sad smile as he started to walk back to their room As  Dr Hudson started to lead Jim away .
Jim didn't acknowledge dr Hudson , so she showed him to his room which apparently withheld another patient already - his roommate . Jim smiled when she said this - now him jimmy would talk too - he liked amusing himself by centring the spotlight on others .
"What the fuck! That's disgusting !" John screamed jumping from his wooden chair . Panic was driving his mind , Sherlock had contaminated him . He had splattered a Petri dish full of bacteria all over him , he was like a walking grime fest . The guard that was surveying Jim , noticed the commotion and began to walk over . . .
Sherlock sat there ; still slightly ticking a bit , watching the entire commotion and feeling entirely responsible. His condition could never give him a break ! His eyes swirled over towards Jim again who was smirking like he was holding in a laugh . The guard had returned to watch him finish the hotdog but the evidence was hidden . " Done!" Jim chirped showing the guard his falsely empty plate . The guard smiled a congratulatory smile and allowed Jim the luxury of exiting the dinner table ; bag in hand .
Sherlock was placing a circular tin underneath his firm mattress as Jim entered the room his face , a blank canvas . “ If that’s alcohol or drugs be careful where you put that “ Jim said in his sing song voice . Sherlock laughed sweetly “ No no no it’s not that “ . His face slightly scrunching up with a facial tic . Jim smiled and informed his taller curly haired roommate about their lunch date . Sherlock laughed and headed towards the door with Jim in tow . At that precise moment John returned into the room , eyes slightly bloodshot and features tense . “ Alright clean freak ?” Jim smirked , feeling more himself after he cut . John’s heart stung a little more as the words cut him , but then his fucked up mind thought of a perfect comeback . “ Have you been eating more Jim? Your arse looks fat ?” He sassily said . Then the horrified look crossed across Jim’s skinny face as He stared down at his overly thin body and quickly exited the room , crossing past Sherlock’s halted body . Sherlock gave John a look that said it all , as he then too followed Jim . “Stupid !” John screamed to himself , then the voice within his head willed him to continue and for once he didn’t fight it as he began repeating it for at least twenty times .
After the waitress walked away, John giggled again. "I'd like to formally apologize to you for saying the same thing to you when we met."
"Thank you." John's eyes dropped down to Sherlock's mouth before returning to his eyes. "Come sit down."
John scrubbed his hand over his own face. "That's... good, Sherlock. I'm glad. But I don't have a choice. When we're at my place, we'll have to be... more discreet."
John got him dried off, dressed, and into bed in just a couple of minutes. John crawled into bed with him and wrapped his arms around him. They were both asleep almost immediately.
He picked up his chair and set it next to the bed so he could sit by Sherlock's knees and face him. He set his mug of ale on the small table with Sherlock's and retrieved his plate. He began to eat. So did Sherlock.
He dragged himself out of bed and into the shower. He closed his eyes as he shampooed his hair. He saw Sherlock's face. Pain in his eyes. John shook his head and tried to think of something else.
Sherlock grew more and more relaxed and heavy in John's embrace. His breathing was slowing. John found himself drifting toward sleep as well.
“Yes,” said Holmes. “To the lodgings of one William Fisher, full-time pimp and part-time blackmailer. He resides just off Old Compton Street in Soho.”
I strolled on Hampstead Heath, I visited my tailor in Mayfair and ordered expensive clothes – money was no object, as the Irishman’s credit was inexhaustible – I lunched at the Café Royal, and I drove in the Irishman’s carriage. On rare occasions he accompanied me, usually to the opera or the theatre, especially when an Italian singer was presented or there was an offering of Shakespeare, preferably a bloody tragedy.
“No, my dear boy,” he replied. “I have studied the ways of the criminal mind for most of my life and one thing I have learned – no man is irredeemable. Every malefactor has the seed of goodness within him, just as every saint carries the possibility of sin. I believe that you are the Professor’s seed of goodness.”
I tried to discern a purpose in his eyes, but they were veiled to me. “Yes, I have been reckless,” I conceded. “And now I am in arrears. I confess I don’t know where to turn.”
Little did I understand how prescient Lady Percy would prove to be. For that night at her villa on the Esquilino I met the Irishman.
Holmes’ eyes glittered. “Bees are deucedly fascinating, my dear fellow! The order of their society! The logic of their behavior! They are without language, without intellect, and even without souls, all the elements we mortal men deem necessary for civilization, yet bees have something we might call a civilization. They work, they cooperate, each in his own place, and each for the good of all!”
The carriage was large, of dark wood, with a crest on the side. The door opened. “Get in. ’Tis a long walk down to the city.” The accent was now clearly Irish, no attempt at disguise.
But I knew he wasn’t sleeping. For one, he wasn’t snoring. Although I’d told him he snored like a buzzsaw, he refused to believe it. “I would certainly know if I snored, my dear boy,” he sniffed. “And I don’t. So let that be the end of it.”
Although the establishment was in the center of Mayfair, the patrons infesting the place were... well, they were not strictly Bohemian. My friend Holmes is a true Bohemian: a man at odds with the common practices of society, but not in a way that is mere show. Holmes may be an eccentric, but he is not a poseur or a charlatan.
“He can’t stand the sight of blood,” Holmes commented, bolting down the whiskey. He was making a good show of pretending he wasn’t in pain, but I knew him well enough to know the truth. “I could not believe he attempted to nurse me before you came, Watson. Poor Brother Mycroft is undoubtedly sitting in a private room, fanning himself to prevent hyperventilation.”
“Perhaps it seems so,” she conceded. “But they were full of pranks as well. Mr. Sherlock was as mischievous a lad as any in the county. I always thought he had a touch of the devil in him. The old Earl used to say it was because his mother was an American – that she must be descended from a tribe of wild Indians to have whelped such an unruly pup!”
Only in the dark were we able to put aside our exile from each other, and even then furtively, briefly. And never the completed act – that would have been too risky, too fraught with the possibility of discovery.
“What you will see if you go to Naples with Freddy Brigham is the ceiling of a cheap hotel, because he will have you on your back the entire you are there – and he will then share you with all of his equally odious friends!” said Lady Percy. “I hate to be blunt, John, but you need to open your eyes! Did your father not warn you? Have you no elder brothers to guide you in avoiding such men?”
The performers stood and bowed, Thommie gathering up his robe, while the fair-haired man awkwardly scrambled back into his breeches and shirt. The lad straightened the velvet covering and then stepped off the stage. A moment later two young females, one blonde and one redheaded, entered through the side door and began to undress one another.
But the footman remained. “My cousin is valet to Major Griffith who holds Campton Grange,” he offered. “He’s been teaching me how to serve a gentleman. How to brush clothes and lay out the linen. I can tie a cravat four different ways – Alfie showed me!”
I ate a piece of cake and choked down my sugary drink and then begged off, having the excuse that I needed to pack. They all sincerely wished me well and I was touched. There had been no similar send-off for Arthur, who intimidated most people with whom he came into contact, or for another man who had left the week before. I realized, to my surprise, that they had a party because they liked me. They believed me to be a success and were truly happy for me.
But the sitting room was empty. Only his empty coffee cup sat abandoned on the table next to the sofa.
“No,” he whispered. “Never! It was heroic. Naïve, but heroic. You were willing to sacrifice yourself for my welfare. No one in all of my life has ever done that for me, not even my own parents or brother. But you were willing to offer yourself, body and soul, to the man you hated to save my miserable life. That’s when I knew...” He paused, as if unable to continue.
“Yes,” I said. “And I will ask for nothing else from you, for you have given me the only thing I desire – my freedom.”
Holmes shrugged. “All men are dangerous when cornered. That is why I have taken precautions.” He opened up his black frock coat to reveal my American revolver tucked into his belt.
I took Mick’s seat and examined the patient. He was in full fever and there was bright red blood on the blanket and on the front of his nightshirt. Dilly was spitting up blood regularly, a sign the end was near. It was no wonder Lestrade had called us.
“Yes, he’s a bachelor. What of it?” Now Stamford was moving into dangerous territory. “So are many men.”
“Years,” said the Irishman. “Don’t ask me how many. I don’t bother to count the passing years anymore.”
“Yes,” he said. “I liked him from the start. I knew on sight that he was a genius – like recognized like, I suppose. And he was tall and dark-haired, and handsome and witty in a roguish, sarcastic way. Grandfather immediately took a dislike to him. He was from a good, but impoverished family, but he wasn’t...” Holmes paused and glanced at me. “He wasn’t aristocratic enough for the old man’s taste. But since he was a friend of Mycroft’s, he was allowed to stay. Grandfather was away all that summer in France and my tutor and I had the estate to ourselves, except for the servants. We did calculations and talked Mathematics, but also Astronomy and Physics – he knew those subjects inside out. And we also talked of... of crime.”
There is something about a place of incarceration that saps the spirit of all hope, even when one is only a visitor. The very air carries with it the stink of hopelessness and despair. I have entered gaols and prisons many times in my life, always at Holmes’ side in connection with one of his cases, but I have never gotten used to it and I doubt I ever shall.
“Then why are you waiting?” he inquired, reclining on the pillow. “The time is ripe. Why defer the act any longer?”
The house was quiet. Everyone, from Mrs. Hudson and James, to the scullery maid and Gladstone and the cat, was deep in slumber.
“It’s my job, sir,” said the young footman, setting the tray upon the nightstand. “Will you be wanting a bath tonight? Harry and I could bring up hot water.”
“You flatter yourself, Watson. I’m not in your bed, I’m in Mycroft’s bed! Or King James’ bed. Besides, it’s infinitely more comfortable than mine. That feather tester was old when our beloved sovereign was still a blushing girl! But Mycroft ordered this mattress new a mere fifteen years ago. It’s only logical that I should prefer it.”
She sat on the bench and dabbed at her limpid eyes with my handkerchief. “But Dr. Stamford told me that you often put yourself in harm’s way. That your friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, often finds himself in a tangle with all sorts of villains and that you have more than once come to his rescue – at peril of your own life! I fear for you, Dr. Watson!”
Mick and Dilly had not yet come before the magistrate to be charged, so they were in dark, tiny holding cells separated from the general mob of the accused. Because their crime was murder, the pair had been placed apart and solitary, unable to communicate with each other or anyone but their gaolers. Not that Dilly Mitchell was likely to communicate much information to anyone. I found her – him – lying in the straw like a beast in a stable. I knelt beside him, feeling his pulse, which was weak and erratic.
Lady Lee finished the song to much applause. The creature curtsied and blew kisses as if he were on stage at Covent Garden. Then he began another number, even more obscene than the first, this one about a soldier with three legs – except one was decidedly not a leg.
“He and his brother were born in this house, even as were Mycroft and myself,” Holmes commented, rustling the sheets with his restless movement. He was very close to me, too close for my mind – or body – to be completely at ease.
I met Holmes on the steps in front of Campton Grange. The major had not seen him out. In fact, the house, which was full of family and servants, seemed strangely deserted, as if holding its breath.
“There is not, my lad,” said Holmes, puffing his pipe as we stood at the bottom of the gangway. Around us passengers prepared to embark, trunks were carried by, and cargo was hoisted into the hold. “Unless they lay railway track on the surface of the ocean.”
My heart pounded like a hammer. I could picture the scene as clearly as if I had been there. “Did you never tell your brother?”
“Yes,” continued Holmes. “I am happy and glad and grateful and all that Twelve-Step rot that Dr. Watson is my new roommate. He seems quite a decent and intelligent chap, unlike the insufferable lout with whom I was previously paired.” And he smiled disingenuously at Arthur, the Metallica fan.
“Why in search of evidence, my boy,” said Holmes. “I must change now, too. Put on evening clothes. Something suitable for a gentlemen looking for amusement.”
“I’m sure,” Holmes said, looking down his nose. “Poetry to a girl who is not a girl! Letters that never should have been written! A silly boy who should know better! A pretty business, this, what say you, Watson?”
“A fortnight?” I was standing by the fire, but my hands were like ice. “But I have brought no clothes with me. No possessions at all.”
“Poor old Gladstone has little experience of cats,” I pointed out. “He likely thinks she’s some curious kind of dog and is content to leave it at that. Let’s hope things remain at truce between them.”
Holmes peered at me with his relentless hazel eyes. “What is the matter, my dear friend? I have rarely seen you so flustered.”
“I’m the last man to judge, Doctor,” said James, wielding the spoon like a baton. “Besides, I already knew everything... or almost everything. It’s clear as crystal what you two fellows feel about each other – if I may be so bold to call you fellows, Mr. Sherlock?”
“That you are the most loyal, truest, and satisfactory friend and compatriot a man could ever hope for,” said Holmes. “And if I were a man who prayed, I would pray every day not to lose your good will and your constant companionship.”
“Oh, I’m finished with that!” Mick said. “It was fine as a lark, but I’ve my eye on bettering meself.”
“Hold a moment, Holmes! I thought you said your grandmother was French. The sister of that painter fellow.”
The door opened and James came back into the room. “Here’s your bag, Doctor.” He set it on the table. “I fetched it as quick as I could.”
Of course, James was cheerfully polishing a line of boots as he sat on the floor of the sitting room. Gladstone was scratching himself on the rug beside him.
“Ah,” I said. I had noted a marked resemblance between the two young men – they were of an exact height and similar in coloring, which, I am told, is vital for a matched pair of footmen. It also seemed logical that in a country household many of the servants would be related, perhaps family retainers going back generations. “Your mother is a very fine cook indeed.”
But I remembered a lad of ten or twelve – it’s difficult to tell the ages of these boys who live in the shadows and are often the worst for nourishment – not this ruddy-cheeked would-be fashion-plate. I tried to remember that last time I’d seen him, but alas, I could not. The boys came and went, but the Irregulars remained, always perpetually in early adolescence.
At first I ignored it, but as time passed it was harder to suppress the lure of sex. When I was on painkillers they also killed my desire – a desire which Holmes had awakened so keenly. And some days when I walked down the street by one of the pubs or coffeebars where the men spilled out onto the pavement I heard catcalls and come-ons – some embarrassingly explicit – as if I were some loose female available to all.
Returning to London was like being jolted back to life after a long and languid sleep. I was still in some pain, but I did not notice it as much because there was so much to absorb me. It was truly good to be home!
We were able to joke about it because all of the fearful anticipation, all of the awkwardness, dissipated in our fulfillment. It was as if we had been performing thusly for many years – giving and receiving mutual satisfaction, rejoicing in the discovery that our bodies fit together in a way I would have hardly thought possible. In a word – perfectly.
“But you are immortal!” Wilde insisted. “In those pictures you are forever captured at the pinnacle of your male splendor. What a gift that must be!”
“We are fatigued by our journey, so if you’d be so good as to serve us dinner as soon as you are able we would be most grateful,” said Holmes, proceeding up the stone steps and into the entry hall as the rest of us followed in his wake. “We will also be wanting hot baths. My colleague, Dr. Watson, has a bad leg, so he will need plenty of hot water for a long soak each evening before he retires. He is also a late riser, so see that breakfast is available until 10 o’clock every morning. I will be up quite early, as is my usual habit. Coffee over tea. And I prefer a whole-grain loaf for my toast. It has more substance. Watson likes sausages with sage. And he prefers white bread, very lightly toasted. And cut on the diagonal only.”
I closed my eyes, quite exhausted by the events of the day. I could hear Gladstone snoring contentedly as he lay on the rug before the dwindling hearth-fire.
“Never think that, James. No man is better than you, not any gentleman or even a lord for that matter. It’s the character of a man and what is in his heart and not his position in society that is important. It’s taken me a long time to fathom that, but I believe it deeply.”
I went back to the establishment again and again in a futile attempt to find the winning streak that would make all good. But that fortunate hand never came. One afternoon a pair of men, dressed in black with their hats pulled low over their faces, visited me at my brother’s house while he was at his office and warned me that if I did not pay up, I would live to regret it.
The train ride to Liverpool was full of anxiety. At every stop on the way I expected a contingent of constables to enter our First Class compartment with handcuffs. But we reached the seaport without incident and checked into a hotel near the waterfront.
“Because...” I swallowed. The only thing was to be truthful. The Irishman could always sniff out a lie, but the truth he could not deny. “Because I love him. I have for many years. You took us for lovers, but it’s not that. For me it’s much more than that. He is everything to me – my entire reason for being alive. I didn’t make myself face that fact until very recently. And now that his life is in danger...” I paused, trying not to falter. “My own existence is meaningless. I have done nothing worthwhile in my life, nothing to leave my mark on the world. My loss would cause barely a ripple. But Holmes is a different story. His loss would be a great tragedy. His great mind and intellect...”
“No,” I said, unable to contain my emotions. “I would never imagine that you would lower yourself to do my work. I am not a self-proclaimed genius. Nor am I the scion of an esteemed lineage, as it appears you are. I am, in fact, no one at all – less than no one, as our society deems it, having no money, no family, and no position worth speaking of. I’m a doctor, for all that is worth. I know the lives I have saved are few, but it has not been for lack of trying. I am nothing compared to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I will always be nothing. And I have accepted that fate as my lot in life.” I drained my glass of Madeira and stood up. “You still have not answered my question.”
“Thank Christ!” muttered a grey-haired man who looked like a solicitor. “Now we can get on with this.”
“And it certainly worked,” I said bitterly. “Corrupt and cynical is certain. And now all is tainted! All we might have had! Ruined!”
“That’s not the half of it,” Thommie said. “It’s a rum game. Everyone knows he didn’t do...” The boy hesitated. “What they say he did. But who’ll believe the likes of us? It makes me afraid for him.”
At first I was mystified by the attentions of some gentlemen who went out their way to make my acquaintance. The first was an iron-jawed Prussian military man who sat down next to me in a beer garden in Munich. He spoke perfect but heavily-accented English, asking my name and where I was travelling. I answered that I was footloose, seeing the sights, heading perhaps to Italy. He bought me a stein of beer and then another. And another. I soon found myself back at his lodgings. I was willing to share digs for the night, but he had something other than sleep in mind. In my complete innocence, I swear I did not know what it was he wanted. And he was perplexed, I’m sure, by my guileless ignorance. After grappling with me for some minutes, he finally gave up. We were both the worse for drink and soon passed out on the narrow bed. I awoke in the morning with a raging headache – and something else raging in my lower extremities. The military man was also standing at attention. I still was not certain about the situation, but I knew instinctively that it would be best if I were to remove myself, which I did forthwith. I scrambled into my clothes, grabbed my pack, and left Munich immediately, heading south towards the border with the Austrian Empire.
I never slept in that smaller bedroom a single night for the remainder of our tenure at 221b Baker Street.
“No, Doctor. Mr. Holmes had his coffee and went out directly. I had a nice dish of curried chicken all ready for his breakfast, but he turned it down. And you know how he loves his curried chicken.”
“Love!” Holmes almost spat out the word. “Romantic drivel! Thank heaven you and I are men of rational thought, Watson. Neither of us would ever be swept up in such a maelstrom of emotion and disaster.”
“I can sleep anywhere,” James said brightly. “I can lie by the fireplace here and be quite content.”
India is beastly hot. So hot. And the fever is never ending. The fire is inside and outside, with no relief, no respite.
I fear I was almost in tears from shock and embarrassment. “My father is dead and my brother cares nothing for me. I have spent half my life in a Jesuit school and then the seminary and nothing like this was ever imagined there! I... I had my... my first woman only three months ago. I cannot believe I am confiding such things to a lady, but it is true! I have wondered why some gentlemen make much of me, but I never dreamed it was because they wished to... to...” I stopped, unable to continue.
“Thank you, Doctor,” said the lad, brightening. “I’ll tell Mrs. Hudson that you’re ready for your breakfast. I won’t say nothing about you being out all night. She might worry.”
We entered our chamber to find James asleep on the sofa. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Good heavens, Doctor! What happened to your head?”
“Your wound... You... shouldn’t be riding.” My mouth was dry, but my hands were wet, somehow. With mud. And... something else. Something warm in the cold mire. “Oh, God! Where is Moriarty?”
After sending James on his way, I hailed a cab and headed to the gaol to see Mick and Dilly. I found Mick as James had described him – chipper, but frightened underneath.
“And I can move into this room...” I stood in the doorway of the smaller bedroom. Perhaps we could simply be friends – with a congenial fuck only when it was warranted. No emotional attachments, no muss or fuss. That would be the best course of action for both of us. “With no strings attached?”
“I didn’t say it was an expensive stickpin, John,” she said, tapping me lightly with her fan. “An old woman like myself may give gifts to a beautiful young man without fear of scandal, that is the privilege of age. Now go and take refreshment. There is music in the drawing room and cards in the blue salon. Enjoy yourself, my dear.”
“I know about them because I know who sent them – and why,” he replied. “They are little men – or they were, for they no longer walk this vale of tears.”
“Charles is a tender-hearted boy,” I commented. “He seemed more concerned with the fate of his little paramour than he was with his own future.”
“I say, Holmes!” I protested, my cheeks warming in embarrassment at the thought of the ample Mycroft Holmes joining me under the bedclothes. “You go too far!”
I could have argued the point, but I was so glad to be shed of the place that I let it go. I packed up my belongings in the same cartons I’d unpacked only a few months before – my possessions were still as meagre as they’d ever been. I’d passed into my thirties with little to show for myself beyond those boxes, a damaged body, and a failed military career. But perhaps things were looking up – a change of location, a change of fortune?
Besides, I had so many questions I wanted answered. And Holmes was not the most forthcoming person in the world.
I had changed. I once had lived here, ate here, slept here, made love here, if you could call it love. Now I was a stranger. No, not just a stranger, but an enemy.
“Perhaps.” I got onto my hands and knees and peered underneath. It was dark and dusty, but there was no cat to be seen.
And seeing that boy, Young Griffith, brought to such despair that he would wish to take his own life shook me to the very core.
“Holmes has his ways,” I answered coolly. I might criticize Holmes and his peculiarities, but I didn’t like to hear others do so.
“Oh, he certainly resembles a swine,” Holmes agreed. “However, he also knows I’d never survive any gaol in this country. I’ve put away far too many criminals who would love to get their hands on me in a place where there was no escape.”
“Well, Watson. There’s no need to sound so pleased about it,” Holmes said, more than a little peeved. “Besides, Mycroft and I are not bastards. My parents were quite legally wed in the parish church not far from here. My father was the one with the sketchy provenance. My grandfather always claimed that after his noble wife died – of a broken-heart not long after the early, lamented death of their heir at age 14 – he and Mademoiselle Vernet married in Paris. But no one ever saw the proof of it.”
“No,” he said. “I have had enough of that. I want my head to be clear so I can recall every sensation. The pain is not so great – not enough to hinder me.”
The man drove a wide German car and had a posh flat in South Kensington, all mods con, as they say. He seemed well-fixed, but I couldn’t say what it was he did. The place was decorated in that clean, generic way that says nothing whatsoever about the person who inhabits it.
He ignored Fred as a lion might ignore a gnat. “Holmes. Please call me Holmes. And I’ll call you Watson, if you don’t mind.”
As the major blinked and gaped at his stricken son, much of the fight seemed to go out of him, his shoulders slumping in dejection. “Come into my library, Holmes. We will discuss this further in private.”
“They are substantial to me. For they are beyond my means to repay.” My heart was pounding now. The carriage was driving on, out of Kensington and into the northern part of town.
But I was hitting my head against a brick wall. I had always thought Lestrade a reasonable man, but in this matter he was implacable.
Now it was clear. Well, at least he hadn’t jumped the wall and escaped. “So you suggested that I would be a good substitute for your minder.”
“I suppose it’ll be all right,” the warder said, looking cautiously at Holmes. He unlocked the iron door and let us in, locking it behind us. “Ten minutes and no more.”
I pushed my way through the throng and out the door. The fog had become almost impenetrable and I despaired of finding a cab.
Holmes squared his shoulders. “I don’t like to drive in the city. It hinders my freedom of movement. I thought I’d break it out of the garage when I came to fetch you. To carry all your gear and tackle. So much better than a cab.”
“Yes,” said the Irishman through gritted teeth. “Plans have changed. We head for the coast as soon as I finish these instructions for my lieutenant. I have a boat waiting in Sussex to take us to France.”
“Yes, I know.” That was a habit he had picked up from me. I learned to like a good curry when I was in India and passed that love on to my partner.
I shillyshallied over whether to take my medical bag, but decided that I had better. Who knew what I would find in the wilds of America? I might no longer be a practicing physician, but if the need came, I would be ready.
“Don’t fret, lad,” I said to Charles, squeezing his hand. “You will get past this. It may not seem so now, but time is a great healer. I promise you.”
“Dr. Watson, welcome to our home,” she said graciously. “So pleased to have you dine with us. I hope you will regale us with stories of your adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes. We have read of him often in the newspapers and of all his exciting doings.”
“Quite.” Holmes began pacing up and down, glancing up at the ceiling, taking in the appointments of the room. “So tell me, Major,” he said. “Your wife and daughter don’t know what has happened, do they?”
“Look at that fine arse!” yelled one muscular chap with a shaved head. “Speak to me, darlin’! I have something you’d like right ’ere!”
“Laudanum?” Holmes made a disdainful face. “A nostrum for old women! Pour me a finger of whiskey and get on with your sewing, Watson. Perhaps a cross-stitch? With a lover’s knot?”
“It’s only dinner,” I said in exasperation. “I’m not going to run off with the female to Gretna Green on the midnight train!”
But Holmes looked up at me and put his hand on my chest, tenderly. “John, this is not the same thing. Don’t think for a moment that it is the same. Never imagine that what we have done is anything like what my tutor forced on me that night. For I am not an innocent and haven’t been one for a very long time. But that night... I fought. I wept. And he laughed at my shame. The next day I could not leave my bed, I was in such pain. But I dared not tell anyone what had happened. I thought I was as guilty as the one who had... had...”
We were at a reception for an Italian prince in Rome when I was startled to see Lady Percy standing on the other side of the salon. She was observing me and the Irishman. I knew from her expression that she was not pleased. I pleaded a headache and the Irishman took me back to our hotel before she endeavoured to speak with me.
“I will have a hansom sent ’round and then meet you there in an hour or so,” said Holmes. “We’ll make a night of it.”
“Bah!” Holmes ejaculated. “Small fry! I believe from the information I obtained from Wiggins and which was confirmed by some intelligence I gathered tonight, that Fisher was killed by ruffians in the employ of a larger, more sinister gang – the same gang that is involved in crime all over this great city. And who shot at us tonight.”
I shrugged. “Perhaps, but I can afford to be impertinent because I have nothing to lose and nothing to hide. Unlike you.”
John was busy organising his food making sure the individual portions didn't touch and that the meat and peas were on different plates . A coughing sound suddenly interrupted his manic thoughts ; he looked up.  His crazy curly haired roommate was staring down upon him . " Um can i sit here ?" Sherlock asked meekly . John nodded almost happy for company for once . Sherlock smiled at him , casting his eyes down as blush filled his cheeks . John noticed the way Sherlock's cheeks turned as red as a tomato when he looked at him and instantly blurted " I don't like men if that's what Dr Hudson  told you " . Almost immediately he wanted to die (figuratively not literally) , why did he say that ? It wasn't completely the truth .... " No she didn't " Sherlock mumbled in return casting his eyes down to his meal . John continued to eat his separated meal .
John walked towards Sherlock , weary , the gloves upon his hands awkward and an awful first impression , but he just couldn’t become contaminated.
After  Mycroft yelled at him in his reptilian voice that Sherlock was being sent to an experimental treatment ; Sherlock felt like thrown out rubbish that just because of his condition he wasn’t worth anything .
“Praise be to the God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comforts, who comforts us through all our afflictions so that we can comfort those in any afflictions...” the priest solemnly read through Mycroft’s annoyingly religious passage. Sherlock tried to stay silent he really did. He bit down upon his lip, his snow-white skin turning pinker by the second. Funerals were supposed to be silent, everybody knew that, it was common curtesy to not say a word unless it was you speaking on the podium. However, Tourette’s wasn’t an easy condition to manage ...
Grasping back onto the strings of reality Sherlock felt dr Hudson’s prescience suddenly beside him asking him questions which bewildered his shocked mind . Sherlock answered the best he could , but he was mainly focusing on suppressing the beast that constantly lived inside his subconscious. “ Amy whine-house sucks my cock !” He suddenly ticked out of nowhere .  His sharp cheekbones suddenly changed to an alarming shade of red . Dr Hudson smiled “what would you do if you could better control your ticks ?” She asked kindly . Sherlock thought he couldn’t imagine a life where he could . “ Um finish college ?” He murmured realising he never had even been able to do that . Mrs Hudson smiled and decided that Sherlock was the perfect patient .Sherlock just went along with whatever she said and decided he might as well stay and went to tell  Mycroft his goodbyes
Three hours after the news was sent to him Mycroft’s husband Lestrade (Sherlock just couldn’t be arsed to remember his overly ordinary first name but he was pretty sure it was Gareth ) was waving their silver Audi goodbye . Sherlock tolled his eyes and painfully cracked his neck as the urge grabbed ahold of him . He gazed at the everlasting green country fields out of the window . This was going to be a long journey .
So as his brother's car pulled him up towards the facility , Jim didn't care he just gazed down upon the wonderful scars etched onto his skin like drawings on a chalk bored . This wasn't going to help his sick mind it was just going to be an adventure !
Sure, there was different types of medication and alternative healing therapies people could take to help with the tics, twitches, urges and outbursts, but none of these worked for Sherlock. So, he sat there, hands between his knees, in his brothers hand me down expensive business suit. His haystack of curls bounced as his shoulders jumped and face contoured, small twitches were spiralling down his body as he tried to hold in much bigger ones. He bit down harder until that familiar metallic taste filled his mouth. His ocean pool eyes had started leaking, the one day he wished he was normal, the one day he wanted to hold it together, he was struggling.
His body abruptly jumped forward, whimpering like a mouse. Stares of judgement once again turned his way. He had to escape, he just couldn’t take it. Sherlock jumped to his feet, his arms curling and uncurling in awkward angles. He turned and thundered down the church columns to the door. His head shot to the left, his other shoulder hunched up and his right hand pressed to his chin – this particular tic hurt Sherlock like a bitch but by now he was used to it. “Fuck! Fucking fuckity fuck!” he shouted as he stumbled down the pathway. People gasped and murmured as he passed but he didn’t care he just had to get out of there.
The two passed the rest of the centre absentmindedly discussing anything but the reasons they had been sent to Dr Hudson’s centre . That was just something they wasn’t comfortable with just yet .
Sherlock laughed , completely unaware of Jim’s subconscious thoughts . The small Irish man gazed into Sherlock’s ocean waves of eyes as a tic took ahold of his body out of nowhere and his arm flew out and grabbed the top of Jim’s arm . Jim yelped in pain Like a puppy that had just had its tail stood on , as Sherlock’s delicate fingers grasped upon his still bloody cuts . “ HAH FATTY” Sherlock ticked again , absolutely mortified that he was verbally and physically abusing the poor man . “ oh my god I’m so sorry !” He gushed as Jim stared down upon his non existent stomach .
“Ok , follow me I’ll lead you to your room , you shall be sharing with two other boys as the facility is quite full at the moment “ She said , leading him out of the room . John had to open and close the door twelve times before he could even speak - his Ocd was really acting up. “ Are they clean ? becuase I can’t have mess , I can’t have mess .... I can’t deal with mess !” He spoke suddenly nervous as a mouse being chased by  a cat .
Jim and Sherlock were already in the car waiting for John , neither checking if he was okay . John thought better of Sherlock but decided not to mention it . His OCD flared up as he went to open the passenger seat door , opening and closing it a whole twenty four times before he finally entered and sat down in a huff . " I'm sorry I really thought We hit someone" he grumbled .
John screamed his OCD going mental , the woman had contaminated him . He sped to the bathroom throughly washing the germs from his hands .
Jim flew in the first stall , remembering the 2500 kcal meal , Richard had forced him to eat before he entered Dr Hudson’s care , and pictured all the food  swelling up his stomach . He stuck his middle two fingers down the back of his throat , feeling the already destroyed and tender muscle around that area and felt the lovely liquid begin to emerge.
After the blonde man was actually gone moriarty looked upon the finally silent sad looking man upon the bed and looked at the door , and just laughed . He couldn’t help himself the spectacle that had just occurred was the most amusing sight he had seen in years . ‘Maybe this place wasn’t going to be so bad ‘ he thought to himself.
He went over and sat next to the two others . He handed Sherlock the samwitch and hesitantly grabbed the food to the salad. Sherlock's eyes were shocked as he saw Jim take a mouthful of sweet corn and lettuce . John was busy wiping down the side with disinfectant wipes and grabbing a new pair of gloves from his pocket to eat with . They were about half way through eating when Sherclosk arm ticked out and knocked over the drink . Diet Coke began to spill everywhere . Johns face went red as he began wiping the sticky liquid up cleaning the table like a mad man . This took over ten minutes . "Sorry " Sherclom whispered . Jim patted his arm and took another mouthful of the barely eaten salad . A" HA FATTY" Sherlock tickled loudly . Jim abruptly dropped the fork , feeing the disgusting food sloshing around his stomach adding another layer of vile fat to his already growing body . He knew Sherlock didn't mean it but the words hurt just the same . He grabbed another mouthful so he didn't make the curly haired boy suspicious again , and then stood up to ask Molly where the toilets were . " Are you ok ?" Questioned John , Jim just murmured something about needing to pee . He was towards the mousy brown haired woman who had been  watching the events unfold quietly behind the counter . " Where's the toilet he asked politely . He pointed towards a door next to the exit and Jim hurried there thanking the woman . As soon as he entered the stall his bony fingers had been down his throat making every bit of those disgusting calories exit his body . He gagged watching chunks of sweet corn enter the toilet .He did this until he was just dry heaving into the toilet bowl . He exited the stall to see Molly stood there a serious look upon her face . " That's not healthy " Sher remarled her eyes staring down at his arms . In between gushes of vomit Jim had taken his hoodie off to protect Sherlock's property from slashes of vomit . Mollys face was a picture of horror as her eyes scanned Jim's red raw arms , littered with blood and gashes . He quickly threw the hoodie back on . " You need help " she choked out . Jim laughed washing his face in the bathroom mirror . " It's too late for that sweetheart " he laughed . Molly shook her head kindly " It never is too late " . She exited the bathroom to return with a bottle of water and a mint . " At least take this " She smiles . Jim was amazed with her kindness and swallowed the bottle hole at least that was calorie free , and then popped the mint in his mouth to mask the smell . He didn't thank her He just nodded his head and quickly exited the unisex bathroom . Sherlock and John were standing in the exit waiting for the dishevelled looking Jim . As soon as John saw the state Jim was in he shook his head and exited the restaurant after opening and closing the door twelve times , walking towards the car . Sherlock however looked more concerned and his crumb covered hand went down to grab Jim's , as some sort of apology . Jim smiled and took Sherlock's large hand , giving Molly a smile as the two of them left the building . " I want  to drive " Jim announced as Sherlock's hand exited his as he shoulder began jumping again . "Where too?" Jim asked . Sherlock smiled " The beach " . Jim looked confused but he placed his foot on the pedal and set off .
And then John's fingers were tangling in silky curls. He pulled back and opened his eyes. Sherlock looked up at him, eyes blazing with desire. He arched his back and shoved his hips upward as John stroked him. He threw his head back in ecstasy, exposing his neck. John immediately dropped down to lick Sherlock's neck, tightening his grip on Sherlock's hair to keep his head back. Sherlock gasped. "Oh!
John felt like he’d been turned inside out. Sherlock had read him with pinpoint precision and used that information to turn him into a quivering mess of want. He struggled to speak. “You.
real? He watched in petrified fascination as one of the demon’s large, elegant hands rose between them.
, no!" John exclaimed as he crawled back into bed under the sheet and pulled Sherlock against him. "Do you... do you
John was nearly unable to continue, but he took a steadying breath. His knee really was killing him. He shifted and lowered his weaker knee to the ground to ease some of the pressure.
"Okay, okay," John said, sliding his hands down Sherlock's chest. "I've got you." He kissed Sherlock's collarbone. "I just didn't want to push you too much. How far do you want to take this tonight?"
Sherlock shuddered and panted, whimpering quietly with the effort of keeping himself from crying out. After several minutes, Sherlock was trying to speak. "J-John... so... so... clo-close..."
John was leaning against the wall when Sherlock came out of the bathroom. "Better, yes?" Sherlock looked down and nodded slightly, his cheeks still hot. John's feet were bare. He must have removed his shoes and socks while Sherlock was in the bathroom. John took his hand again and led him up the stairs to his bedroom.
John realized he'd been staring. "I, uh, I can step out and let you change. Um, unless you need help, of course. Do you... need help?"
He shoved John’s hand away roughly. “Your danger kink is even worse than I realized,” he snarled. “A
They walked back slowly, and sat in the back of the wagon against the hay. John made sure Sherlock ate this time. "Where shall we go, dear heart?"
"Don't let go," John said quietly. Sherlock gripped the baluster, his mouth falling open slightly. John reached over for Sherlock's left hand and guided it to another baluster.
Sherlock twisted his hand in John's shirt and put his other hand on the back of John's head, his fingers pushing into John's hair. His hair was soft. "Why not?" Sherlock whispered.
When John was clean and his filthy clothes were in the washer, he went back to the bedroom. Sherlock opened his eyes and began to sit up, wincing. John rushed over to help him sit against the headboard.
"Better than all right." John quickly removed his own trousers, smiling to himself when he saw Sherlock's eyes widen at the sight of John's clothed erection.
Sherlock cradled John's face in his hands, stroking his cheekbones with his thumbs. His hands were trembling. "If you're certain. You don't have to prove anything to me."
It was louder than John thought it would be. More aggressive. Then the brass players and the string players put their instruments down, leaving just instruments like clarinets and flutes playing.
Sherlock dropped the shirt on the floor next to John. His eyes were bright with passion as he took in the sight of John standing in front of him. John saw him shudder. "You're stunning," Sherlock whispered.
John took a drink of his iced tea. Sherlock grimaced at him and John snickered. "This is very good." He held the glass out toward Sherlock. "Want to try it?"
He rolled on top of Sherlock, straddling his hips and pinning his wrists to the mattress on either side of his head. Sherlock responded with a gasp of pleasure. His body arched under John's.
John was patting at Sherlock's head again and trying to speak. Sherlock knew John was trying to warn him that he was going to come.
John looked at the concrete floor. "You don't." John took a deep breath and let it out. "You're right. You've got no reason to trust me again. I'm sorry, Sherlock. Truly." He turned around and walked toward the stairwell.
John shuddered and moaned loudly, already struggling with Sherlock’s command to maintain eye contact. Sherlock continued to lick over the entire crown of John’s cock. He then plunged down without any further warning, taking John’s entire length in at once.
John growled into Sherlock's neck and rolled his hips against him again. He moved his hands to Sherlock's hips and under his t-shirt to grasp his waist. Sherlock's skin was warm. John sighed against his collarbone.
Sherlock stared up at John, still finding it hard to believe that John wanted to be with him. He took hold of John's shirt and pulled him down for a kiss.
“Oh, John, the mere thought of it makes me weak at the knees. The next time I touch myself I’ll be thinking of you. Would you like that, John? I’ll close my eyes and put my hands on my body.” He tipped his head back slightly, his eyes fluttering shut, his expression enraptured. “And I’ll imagine it’s you, John. Your hands, your mouth, your thick cock. Oh, John,” he moaned. “I’ll come all over myself with your name on my lips.”
John reacted without thinking, leaping forward and grabbing the man's shirt. He yanked the man back out of the street. The man jabbed his elbow into John's ribs, and they both overbalanced and tumbled down onto the sidewalk. John hit the pavement hard, landing on his left shoulder. He cried out in pain. The man dropped on top of him for a split second before leaping to his feet and towering over John with fury in his eyes. "
The incubus’s eyes began to glow. His entire countenance darkened, even as he seemed to absorb all the light in the room. He growled, and his wings gave a beat against the air. “
"Hmm." Sherlock looked out the window. He took a sip of his drink. He set it down and began fidgeting with the glass, spinning it slowly on the table.
Sherlock ground his arse against John a second time before pulling his mouth off John's and kissing down his jaw and neck. John tipped his head back and gasped for air. "Oh, God,
Sherlock turned to look into John's eyes again. "Like it was yesterday," he said, his eyes shining ocean blue in the warm sunlight. "That was the most important moment of my life." He moved one hand up to John's cheek. "Until this one."
Sherlock took John’s face in his hands and claimed his mouth with a heart-stoppingly passionate kiss.
John turned his back and returned to his bed. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him as he slipped beneath the sheet and settled in.
Sherlock lost the battle. He doubled over and laughed out loud. Mike gave up and giggled. "Don't be angry, John!"
"Well, I'm not sorry." John put his hand on Sherlock's cheek. "We'll build a better one. Somewhere no one will find us."
John let his head rest on Sherlock's shoulder. "The thing is, it would be a while before I'd actually make any money. There are the startup costs, of course, and it would take time to build a patient base large enough to support a practice. Maybe... maybe a long time, given my... reputation at this point." John's nerves were getting the best of him.
Sherlock berated himself for his lack of courage. He hadn't told John how he truly felt about him because he was terrified of ruining everything, choosing to keep his platonic friendship with John rather than risk chasing John away with his... desires. But it was clear to Sherlock now that he was a fool to think that John would stay with him as "just flatmates." John would keep searching for a suitable partner. Sherlock shoved his hands into his hair and tightened his fists in it. Continued inaction could cost him
When John opened his eyes, Sherlock was staring up at him, eyes glassy with pleasure and wonder. John kissed him tenderly and reached into his pocket. He pulled out his handkerchief and gently wiped them clean. He dropped the handkerchief to the floor and finally lowered his body, half on top of Sherlock. Sherlock's arms wrapped around him.
He drifted for a few minutes before opening his eyes. Sherlock was leaning over him. He put his clean hand in John's hair and kissed him tenderly. John smiled. "I love you, Sherlock."
John released Sherlock and unsteadily pulled himself back into his own chair. He folded his arms on the table and dropped his head onto them. He groaned quietly.
Sherlock growled loudly. He smacked both hands against the mattress and lifted his head to glare forcefully at John. "
Sherlock proceeded to thoroughly map John's upper body with his fingertips as John closed his eyes and gave himself over to the sensation. Sherlock found him completely fascinating.
"There's more gold in my hands right now than there is in the entire village." He knelt and put it into Sherlock's pack. Sherlock was afraid he was angry, but John just shook his head and smiled at him warmly when he stood back up. Sherlock smiled back, relieved.
John broke away from Sherlock and put a hand on Greg’s cheek, locking eyes with him. Greg was visibly quivering.
Sherlock squeezed lightly as John began to guide his hand up and down. John was lost in pleasure. He started thrusting gently into Sherlock's hand. "I'm - I'm so close, Sherlock!" He dropped his head forward to look at Sherlock. "Are you - are you close, Sweetheart?"
John watched and listened carefully as the orchestra played the rest of Scheherazade. Sherlock had solos throughout, and he was beautifully expressive each time. John was captivated.
John tilted his head at Sherlock. "Okay, setting aside convincing them that I turn into a baritone when I have sex, you would have me tell them I moan my own name?"
John released Sherlock and collapsed back onto his heels. He put his left arm around Sherlock's uninjured right leg and rested his head against it. He was still breathing heavily. "Oh,
The second guard grumbled, "Why does it matter, as long as you're getting paid? I'm sick of listening to your whining."
Sherlock leaned in even closer, moving his hands to the laces on John's breeches. John whimpered. Sherlock went all the way in, nuzzling up against the front of John's breeches as he began untying them. He smiled again when he felt that John was already fully hard.
Sherlock laughed with him. "Had I known that changing my style of dress would have this effect on you, I'd have done it sooner."
John managed to get Harry out of the kitchen, but his mother wouldn't let him take Harry's place. After she'd hustled him back into the living room, John sat on the far end of the couch and watched Harry talk animatedly with Clara.
John hovered over Sherlock, letting him control the kiss. Sherlock was tense and trembling beneath him. After a few minutes, John took control, kissing Sherlock deeply and settling his body on top of Sherlock's. He nudged his knees between Sherlock's and stroked his hands down Sherlock's sides to his waist. Sherlock whimpered as John rolled his hips against him. John dragged both hands back up Sherlock's sides and over his arms. He gripped both of Sherlock's forearms and pulled them away from John's body. Sherlock made a bereft little noise that turned into a whine of arousal as John pushed his arms over his head and pinned his wrists to the mattress.
Sherlock raised his hand and put it over John's. He took John's hand and kissed it. He turned and started walking again.  Sherlock's leg was already throbbing. He worried that he wouldn't be able to make the journey, but he pushed on, cresting the next hill.
owe you. I'll never be able to repay you for your generosity. But that has nothing to do with what's happening between us." He stroked his fingers through John's hair. "I kissed you because I wanted to. And it's killing me that you won't kiss me back." He tugged on John's shirt a little. "If you don't want me, I'll find a way to deal with it. But I've seen you looking at me, and I think you want me, too."
John breathed a sigh of relief when he caught sight of Sherlock talking to the pretty dark-haired cellist. As John approached them, he could hear Sherlock saying, "Thank you, Molly. Your solos were superb as well. Very lovely." Molly began blushing furiously. She was attempting to stammer out a response when Sherlock caught sight of John.
“Enough talk,” he rumbled. The play of the muscles and tendons under his pale skin as he moved was mesmerizing. Had John been capable of coherent thought, that thought might have been that he now knew what it would look like if a marble statue could be brought to life as pure sex.
John smiled at him. "Yes." He looked pointedly down at his own left hand. Sherlock's gaze followed his. Tap, tap, tap. Sherlock looked back up into John's eyes, a relieved smile breaking over his face. John looked down at Sherlock's hand and saw Sherlock return his signal.
They soon finished eating. Mike insisted that Sherlock lie down on his bed. Sherlock complied, but stayed on top of the coverlet, using his cloak as a blanket. It felt wonderful to be in a bed again. John and Mike went to the barn.
Sherlock smiled shyly and carefully put his legs on John's bed. He settled his left leg close to the wall and laid back. "Come here," he said quietly. He hooked his right hand into John's waistband. John gasped, the shirt falling from his hands onto the floor. Sherlock pulled him against the edge of the bed. "Lie down with me, John."
John smiled. "Yes." He stroked his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "I'd been up in the middle of the night with a nightmare. I'd stood on the roof of my building and looked up here at your apartment, and I'd decided I was going to make you mine."
John untied Sherlock's breeches with trembling hands. He loosened them and pulled them down several inches. He then pulled Sherlock's underclothes down to reveal his cock.
John gave Bill and David a report on Susie's condition and stayed with her as they loaded her into the ambulance. He looked down at Susie. "You're going to be just fine, Susie. This is Bill and David. They're going to take you to the hospital now." He squeezed her hand and stroked her hair one more time before climbing back out of the ambulance.
Sherlock took a moment to look at John before he dropped back down next to him. He put a trembling hand on John's cheek. "You're utterly gorgeous, John." John surged forward and kissed him hard. Sherlock gasped against John's mouth and clutched at John's hair.
John leaned even closer. He heard Sherlock take a sharp breath. "Better make it yours. I have a feeling we're about to make a significant amount of noise."
John dried off and went to the bedroom. After putting on a t-shirt and pajama pants, he grabbed similar clothes for Sherlock. When he returned to the bathroom, he found Sherlock leaning heavily against the shower wall with his eyes closed.
Double update this week due to chapter 9 being so short and so brutal! I hope you enjoy chapter 10. (I certainly enjoyed writing it!)
Sherlock looked into John's eyes. John could feel Sherlock's erection pressing into his hip next to his own. Sherlock's eyes were dark with arousal. He rolled his hips slightly against John's. John gasped at the sensation, his mouth falling open. "
John was still retching, but had long since stopped bringing anything up. He slid down into a heap on the deck. Sherlock was leaning down over him, holding his upper arm. "John!"
The bigger man dismounted, passing his horse's reins to the smaller man. John walked to the house with him and opened the door. The man went in and looked around. He walked out and crossed to the rabbit, pulling a knife from his belt. He cut the rabbit down and took it with him. He tossed it to the smaller man, who put it in one of the bags hanging from his saddle.
John sighed. "My darling, you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen." Sherlock looked down, smiling shyly. John shook his head slowly. "The seasickness must have made me weaker than I thought."
This work is dedicated to L. The journey John takes over the course of this story is one that L. couldn't take. I hope he has found the peace that eluded him in life.
John followed Sherlock to the counter while Angelo disappeared into the back. Angelo reappeared quickly with a very old disc. He held it out to Sherlock. Sherlock took hold of it carefully. He gasped quietly. "
After several minutes, Mike rode in. He dismounted and hugged John. "It's all settled. I've got the clothes. We can leave after supper."
John pulled Sherlock past him into the room and closed the door. He turned, gripped the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, and kissed him thoroughly.
John moaned at Sherlock's words and pushed himself upright, his hands on Sherlock's shoulders. He dragged his hands down Sherlock's body.
Sherlock gaped at him. John's left hand moved into Sherlock's hair. He tugged gently, tilting Sherlock's head to the side and exposing his neck. Sherlock gasped. "Oh!"

"Fine. Don't tell me. But you're not fooling anyone. I've seen that look before. You're in love, aren't you?"
Sherlock took John's hand in both of his. "John." Sherlock looked up into John's eyes. "You've been kinder to me than I could ever deserve. You're an extraordinary man. Today has been the best day of my life."
John was fighting a battle with himself the entire time he was with Sherlock. Every time he locked eyes with him, and every time his gaze wandered down Sherlock's body, he forced himself to look down at the table or his own hands.
change my mind about you. I love you, Sherlock. I'm yours. For as long as you want me, I'm yours." He stroked his thumb over Sherlock's cheekbone.
John grabbed Sherlock with both hands - one in Sherlock's hair, the other sliding around his waist. He kissed Sherlock until he was trembling. Then he pulled at the tie on Sherlock's dressing gown, releasing it. Sherlock sat up slightly to allow John to push the dressing gown off his arms. He dropped back down. The dressing gown was still under him.
Sherlock ducked around the shelves and found one of his and John's personal bottles. When he came back, he found John still resting on the floor, slumped against the pillar. He'd managed to do his breeches back up, at least.
Sherlock pulled back. John smiled up at him. "If I'm going to call you in two weeks, I'll need your number."
John nodded. "I understand why you're worried. Especially after the stunt I pulled last week. If waiting two weeks will help you, then I'll do it. I'd do just about anything you asked of me, Sherlock."
When he'd finished speaking, Holmes turned on his heel and stalked over to a baby grand piano near the living room windows, the silk robe he wore over his clothes fluttering behind him. He began digging furiously through the large pile of paper on top of the piano's lid.
After a few moments, Sherlock broke the kiss, gasping for air. His hands were pushing John's chest upward. John stopped stroking Sherlock and got up onto his knees again, confused at having been pushed away.
Sherlock was startled when John groaned in dismay. He pulled back so he could see John's face. "What's wrong, John?"
John ran to his car and drove to Sherlock's apartment building as quickly as he dared. He took the elevator to the basement first, sighing in relief when he saw Sherlock's car in its spot. He pushed the button for the twelfth floor.
"No, John." Sherlock picked his right leg up and bent his knee so John could pull his breeches and underclothes off of it. Then John very gently took them off his left leg. He then removed Sherlock's stockings, leaving him completely nude.
After a few quiet minutes, Sherlock got out of bed and went to clean up. John stayed where he was, drifting toward sleep.
Sherlock put his other hand on John's hip to keep him steady. He pushed his mouth down onto John's cock and took in as much as he could. The head pushed past the roof of his mouth and back into the top of his throat. John cried out. Sherlock gagged hard and had to pull off, tears springing to his eyes.
Sherlock scrunched up his face. “Every human thinks they’re good at this, particularly the males. The vast majority of them are wrong.” He stepped toward John. “
"The two of you are so graceful together. It's absolutely gorgeous. I can barely take my eyes off you to work."
His rich baritone, coloured by an outlandishly posh accent, was a soothing contrast to the intimidating leathery black wings rising from the backs of his shoulders.
John continued kissing Sherlock, pushing him onto his back. He reached into the bedside table drawer again. He kissed, licked, and nipped at Sherlock's neck and collarbone. He inched his way down the bed, his mouth moving steadily lower on Sherlock's body.
"I'll tell my mother as soon as possible. I should do it in person, so it may be a couple of days before I get the chance. But consider it done. Fortunately, I have a feeling Harry may be a bit more understanding than Mom will be."
John turned, looking back to check on Sherlock. He was standing next to their booth and looking at John with wide eyes. When John made eye contact with him, Sherlock's chest rose as he drew in a sharp breath. John refocused on Susie.
After they crossed the bridge over Brush Creek, Sherlock pointed at an impressive apartment tower. "That's my building," he said.
Greg was pinned, unwilling or unable to look away. His lovely brown eyes were wide. His chest rose and fell rapidly.
"No!" John interrupted, putting his hand on Sherlock's forearm. "No. It's interesting, and you clearly love it."
Sherlock was utterly lost. He gasped for breath when John's tongue darted across one of his nipples and then the other. He whimpered desperately.
John could feel white-hot anger blazing from his eyes as he crowded the man against the pillar, as close as he could get without touching him. "
John rose up on his knees and pulled his shirt over his head, tossing it to the floor. He grabbed Sherlock's nightshirt and pulled up. Sherlock pushed up with his right leg, lifting his hips so John could get his nightshirt out from under him. He was looking intently up at John, eyes alight with passion.
John grinned back. "All right." He stood up slowly and stripped down completely. He began washing himself.
John pushed Sherlock back to look at him. Blood ran freely down his temple, mingling with the floodwater. John's hands immediately went to Sherlock's scalp, checking the severity of the damage. He frantically looked Sherlock over. "Where else are you hurt?"
Sherlock glared upon the skinny boy who was laughing , was his condition really that funny ? “ I’m sorry but man you’ve just cheered up the clinically depressed “ Moriarty spluttered through his giggles . And that statement from the skeletal Irish boy made Sherlock laugh too ; ever so slightly .
Around an hour after lunch at the centre was meant to begin , Sherlock entered the canteen . He stared around the happily painted yellow walls that mocked him as if they were showing him that he was meant to be as joyful as them . A combination of smells filled the rather large canteen - which held space for up to fifty patients - but the stench of French fries overpowered them all .
As Jim entered the pristinely white room the stench of bleach knocked him back , bewildering his shattered senses like an earthquake . He saw a smaller male in the eastern corner scrubbing furiously at the plastic windowsill , like his life depended upon it .
John began screaming his OCD on a rampage , the voice inside his head melting away his sanity . “ You can’t go to the bathroom in there you have to go down the hall!” He shouted as he heard the sound of running water from the bathroom in front of him . He rapped upon the door twelve times trying to contain himself somehow , still angrily shouting .
" Right who wants to drive " smirked Jim as he loaded the boys bags into the boot of the silver priyus . Sherlock shook his head , with a quick unconscious squeak escaping , as he opened the back door and threw his zombie like the figure and eased his sore body onto the three seats . "I'll drive " offered John , climbing into the drivers seat . The opened and closed the door twelve times almost screaming in frustration at the annoyance of his OCD. Jim smiles sliding into the front passenger as soon as John had finished . His skinny face glanced towards the backseat smiling at Sherlock's fast asleep body curled into the leather seats . " Alright Clean freak where are we heading " Jim smiled , trying not to laugh as John was wiping the steering wheel with a clean tissue and his handsantiser before he could drive . "Not funny " John huffed " but right now I could do with a subway " Jim looked confused at Johns request . " They wear gloves there and a lot are open all night now " he smiled putting the car into gear . Jim's ginger presses the button for the rock station on the radio as John began to , very cautiously , drive out of the centre .
Moriarty smirked at the new arrival his beady black eyes judging his smart clothing and uncomfortable posture as Sherlock sat upon the final bed . The final piece for his forced holiday .
It was around twelve am when Sherlock was unpacking his bag , whilst Jim  was in the rooms bathroom .
John stood there for a minute his hands wiping the trauma from his face trying to stop himself attacking the skeletal creature in front of him .
The two of them arrived at a room at the end of an everlasting corridor. Dr Hudson passed John a silver key , making sure her hands didn’t touch his . “This is where I leave you , John I’ll be back when the others return “. John thanked her , and entered his new abode , twelve times .
Muttered his face an alarming shade of red embarrassment . Jim smirked with a hint of pity and asked the troubled obsessive the one question on his mind " isn't there supposed to be another roommate here ?"
His sister , Mary, pulled up in the cobbled drive her hazel eyes brimmed with worry . “ I’m sorry John but this is for the best ,I can’t deal with you repeating the same thing constantly , trapped within nightmares even when you’re awake , you need help !” She said , kindly enough but to John it just felt like poison in his ears .He Stepped out of the brown Volvo, and closed the door . Once . Twice . Three times . His mind still wasn’t satisfied . Animalistically he grunted , with frustrations , was it ever enough ! John repeated the action another nine times , eyes clouding with anger as Mary’s sympathetic features became etched within his brain .
Tics still exploding from him , Sherlock was getting mad .Why couldn’t John understand that he had to regain control of himself alone ? Suddenly a marvellous idea entered his head , he knew it was wrong to play on his roommates OCD but desperate times caused desperate measures . Sherlock began to blow raspberries upon his forearm so John would think he was contaminating the bathroom .
"DEAD BABIES ON THE ROAD !" Sherlock ticked as the car began moving ; John just glared out of the window .
Sherlock became lost within his own thoughts , thinking about what this place would do to him . He didn't want tests that would apparently cure him , like he wanted to be cured he just wasn't some fucking gerbil to be played around with .
Jim put on a random station this time on the radio and Home sweet home by Motley  crue came on , Sherlock began singing along . Jim smiled and so did John ; he looked at peace when singing he didn't tic and he could actually sing really well . Jim joined in smiling lightly at how he sounded like a drowned cat . John didn't he just sat there watching the road making sure nothing was hit . It was around six am now and they felt far away from the centre . The boys all looked pretty tired as the first rays of sunlight hit their eyes . " Which beach did you want to go to " Jim asked Sherlock his eyes glistening from the light. Sherlock's mind ran back to the memories of his lovely mum skipping along the shore line shouting out to him . The one with the stripey lighthouse . John grunted and rolled his eyes . " How far away is that " he stopped " How far away , how far aw..." he stopped mid tangent and looked out the window , slightly embarrassed as he heard Jim bark a laugh . " Ages , about SHIT. two days more heading south " Sherlock answered his neck twitching . Jim smirked and continued driving .
“Get your shit together we are leaving, couldn’t even make it through your own mothers funeral pathetic!” he glowered. Sherlock wanted to protest, several Oscar worthy comebacks coming into his mind but his twitches were making it impossible to talk. Before he knew it, Sherlock was pulled into Mycroft’s absurdly expensive posh and being driven away …
After half an hour of John holding Sherlock's ticking  muscles and whispering quiet words of help , at quarter to three am , Sherlock's body fineally calmed down . His shoulder jumped twice before he managed to sit up and the bags under his eyes and sweat dripping off his entire body , mad him appear like a sad sweaty panda . "I'm sorry " he whispered, sounding completely drained of energy . John was sat there smiling "It's okay" John said sadly his hands now tapping the floorboards in threes . Jim who was still stood in the door way , looking lethargic , piped up " Welll ... are we still going to leave before daylight then ?" .
"Hi my names jim moriarty and I'm guess I'm staying with you ? " the intruder spoke in an Irish accent .
Sherlock went to talk but his jaw snapped before he was able . He sighed sadly and began again " Yeah , I don't think I can stay here ... John want to  come ?" He Choked out . John looked around at his yet to be unpacked pristine white mini suitcase , and the probabaly   False promises that went along with it . " Why not , someone's got to help you out " he said . Johns gloved hand reached down and grabbed Sherlock's shaking one and his tiny frame somehow managed to pull the very large man of the floor . Sherlock stumbled as he went to leave the room , his head ticcing side to side as he fell . Jim's bony arms managed to catch him , wincing in pain as Sherlock hit his cuts .
“May I ask, mister Holmes, how did you know my last name? When we came in, I mean.” He had gathered the courage to speak at least, and Sherlock looked up to him, surprised he spoke after that afternoon. “He probably deduced your family history or something, right father?” Rosie answered, since Sherlock just stared at the boy. Sherlock stood up, gave his plate to Rosie, gave John a kiss on his cheek and said; “Nope, just follow you on Instagram, Rosie.”
4 years after the first meeting and dinner, Tim goes to Baker Street to ask John and Sherlock a big question.
When Tim gets out of the cab, he feels his hands slip of the door handle, he feels a drop of sweat make its way from his forehead, to his right temple and his cheek to finally fall down on his collarbone. He steps on to the sidewalk and stares at the famous green door.
Sherlock and John were standing in the kitchen. John was making risotto, while Sherlock pretended to read his book to make sure John wouldn’t feel watched.
Sherlock still hated food, and he always thought of it as just a fuel. According to him there just was no point in making it delicious. For him food is food, however John loved to cook. Since they were together, Sherlock began to eat more and more, just to watch John cook. He loved to watch him sing along softly to the music coming from the speakers while slicing the carrots. He loved it when John was stirring the risotto, while absentmindedly moving his hips along with the rhythm. He even loved it when John dropped a pot, and swore loudly.
“All right, a nice cuppa for the young handsome bloke in my living room and one for the anxious boyfriend of my daughter.” John smiles and if it wasn’t for the nerves Tim would have laughed at the joke but now, he just can't. He looks down to the cup of steaming tea in his hand. He can't look them in the eyes. He isn’t even sure if he can talk. Tim opens his mouth, here it goes…
If you liked it, please let me know in the comments, and if you have tips or anything please let me know!
John watched as Sherlock sat in his chair, screaming at the telly for thinking the women killed her husband. He loved to watch him, even after the 20 years since they had first kissed. He thought about that night often, the first night after ‘the incident’ with Euros, Sherlock was upset and John had hugged him to comfort him. Somehow, they ended up kissing and the next morning would be the first of the many more to come.
“Thank you, John. I wanted to talk to you both, before we went on the trip. I, uhm, I want to ask you something. I… You know Rosie and I have been dating for 4 and a half years now, and, uhm, I love her very much. I mean I could not imagine my life without her. I love her, and I, I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Hmm, yes, yes, so what I’m trying to say is that, …, I, I want to marry your daughter. If I can, I mean. I’m asking for your blessing to, uhm, propose to Rosie.” Tim looks up to the two impressive men sitting in front of him. He feels as if he's going to die, right here, right now.
They walked on the side walk laughing, which attracted a few looks from some tourists but they didn’t care. “I’m pretty sure at one point your father implied that I’m a virgin, who only wants to shag you. And that ‘getting ice-cream’ was a cover.” Timothy managed to get out a few words before bursting out in laughter again.
“Hey, Rose, wait up!” Rosie turned around to see her Timothy run after her. He kissed her on her cheek, she smiled. “Wanna catch a movie?” he asked. “Yes, sounds fun. I’ll just drop my stuff off at my place, so I’ll meet you there.”
The sound of the door opening and voices that came with it, interrupted his train of thought.Rosie was home. “She’s with her boyfriend” Sherlock had looked up from the telly and turned it off. “Sorry, what” John asked, still a bit absent. “She. Is. With. Him.” Sherlock looked up to John and smirked at his irritated face. “Yes, I heard you, love. Are you sure?”. Before Sherlock could answer the door swung open, and Rosie entered with a handsome young fella by her side. “Hi dad, hi father! This is…” “Timothy Durling” Sherlock had cut her off and walked around him.
“Hey, are you okay?”, once they were outside Rosie took Tim's hand and placed it on her shoulder. She looked up to his eyes and saw that they were still filled with embarrassment and fear. She laughed a bit when Tim looked at her and gave her a look, which said enough on its own. “You know, I think it went well, or at least as well as it could have gone. I could tell they liked you. They just didn’t want to show it.” “Well, then they can hide it really, really, really well, Rosie. I’m pretty sure they only made fun of me…” He looked sad, and she almost felt bad for him, almost, if wasn’t also really funny to see him like this. God, she was mean, the man she loved felt humiliated and all she could do was laugh. She gave in to her urge and laughed. First Tim looked at her accusingly, but then he started to join her.
Tim feels as if he's going to throw up, and it doesn’t help John takes a long time cleaning up. After what feels like an hour, it probably wasn’t though, John comes down again now fully dressed and decent. “Come in”
She began to walk to her bike, when he grabbed her arm and pulled her close. She could feel his breath against her the top of her head. They had been dating for 6 months now, but every time he stood close to her, she could feel her brain get all fuzzy. “How come I never get to go to your house? We’ve been dating for so long and I have never met your parents. Why?” Rosie sighed, she knew she would have to answer this one time. Might as well be now.
They didn’t hear the front door unlock, they didn’t hear the footsteps of the two people walking up the stairs, they didn’t hear them walking though the door. “Oh god, dads, please. Don’t!” John broke the kiss, and stood up. He felt as a teenager getting caught by his parents. He and Sherlock looked at each other, before looking at their daughter and blushed.
“Right, yeah France, of course. Let me just, uhm, clean up our, uhm, experiment and then you can come in, okay?” Before Tim can answer, John closes the door and he hears him running up the stairs again.
When Rosie and Timothy are out of the door, John finally gives in to his urge to laugh. It doesn’t take long, before Sherlock begins to laugh too. “His face!” John manages to get out two words before collapsing again. After ten minutes of discussing and making fun of the fear in the face of the boy, they calm down a bit. “I think, this is a keeper though. She really likes him.” Sherlock is the first to speak normally again. “Yes, I think so too…”
Well, so that is the end of my first ever fic. Thank you so much for reading and I really hope you enjoyed it!
After the movies, it was still pretty early. It was half past eight, and they began to feel hungry despite the big bag of popcorn they had shared. “Do you maybe wanna join us for dinner?” Rosie asked, when they turned the corner on Baker street. “You know, I do, actually. I think I can manage to sit and get humiliated again if it means I can spend more time with you.” Rosie felt her stomach get warm, she never thought she would ever meet someone so sweet so soon. She kissed him, “I love you, weirdo.” “I love you too, crazy.”
The truth was that she had very peculiar parents. The fact that she had two dads, was not the problem. Everybody knew and it was not the problem she was dreading. The problem was that her dads were, well, very protective. And when normal people are protective, you can deal with that, but she had a retired army doctor and a consulting detective as her protectors. She loved them very much, but every time she brought a friend over, her father began to deduce every single bit of their lives. It didn’t improve since her dad just loved to watch Sherlock deduce the shit out of people. She smiled at the time her ex-boyfriend had actually ran away crying because her father had said he was going to die in two weeks. In fact, he was not, but it turned out he cheated on her. He had gone off to a mental hospital for three weeks to recover from his fear.
I have only seen 1 James Bond film, so my information about the films is probably shit. I know that there are 24 films or something right now, so I imagine that in 17 years there will be about 45 ;)
He still remembers the first time he saw the door, now almost exactly 4 years ago. He remembers walking up to the door, with a nervous and excited Rosie by his side. He sees himself walking up the staircase, so nervous himself he would’ve rather just fallen down and broken his leg than taking another step. But he took the other step, and every step after that until he was at the door. Rosie had told him what he should definitely not say, but he had only half listened, to busy with gathering the courage of walking up the stairs. When Rosie opened the door, he saw them for the first time; the famous detective and his doctor. He didn’t remember what happened next, it was all just a blur, although he remembers Sherlock saying something about the old condom in his wallet.
“How do you…, you know what? I’m not even gonna ask” Rosie said, she turned to Tim; “I’m just gonna get changed and drop my books upstairs, and then we can get going. You two, behave, please.” She turned to her dads and gave a smirk, that resembled Sherlock's an awful lot. She ran upstairs too scared to see what her dads were going to say. Secretly she loved that they knew everything. She loved to see them impress her boyfriends, just to see how brave they were. But she would never let them know that, she couldn’t, they would be way too pleased with themselves.
And now, he is going to ask to be part of that family forever. He feels nervous, he is scared for the rejection, for the humiliation. He is scared to be outcasted again, he has worked so hard for their trust and it all comes down to this moment. This is the moment of truth. Tim takes a deep breath and walks to the door. He takes another deep breath and rings the bell. No answer. Ring again. No answer. They're home, he sees that the door knocker was straight, which, Rosie had taught him, means that at least John is home.
“We like you, Timothy, we really do. And we know you can make Rosie happy and take care of her. We are never wrong, or at least I never am.” Sherlock answered, and John smiles at the look of affection on Sherlock’s face, and knows they have made the right decision. Tim would make Rosie happy; Tim would make them happy. “Right, well, this calls for another cup of tea, I’ll put the kettle on.”
To Timothy’s relief, Rosie enters the room. “So, did you three behave?” She exchanges one look with her father to know they clearly did not. “O my god, what did you say?” “Nothing darling, just getting to know Tim over here. Making sure he brings you home before ten.” Sherlock sits down his chair again and smiles at his daughter, who looks sceptical. “We get along great, right Tim?” John looks at Tim, who shifts a bit uncomfortable in his chair. “Yes, well, we better be off if we want to catch an early movie, Rose.” Rosie looks at her dads and bursts out laughing; “Liars! Stop frightening him, he is sweet.” She kisses Timothy on his cheek, walks over to her father, kisses him on the cheek too. When she gets to John, she gives him a kiss, and says; “We’ll probably be home before dinner, so maybe, if it’s okay and if Timmy wants to, we’ll join you two.” “Off course darling. Have fun!” “Though not as much as ‘Timmy’ wants.” Sherlock says from his chair and gives a small smile to Timothy, who relaxes a bit more.
“Uhm, hello Rosie, you still with us?” Timothy looked a bit worried at her. “Yes, just lost in thought.” “So, can I please come with you? I want to meet the people who gave the world so much beauty.” She laughed and kissed him. “Fine, but I should warn you, they are weird. Like super weird, lovely, but weird.” He laughed and took her hand. “Well, luckily, I am too!”
When they had finished dinner, John and Rosie began to clean up everything. Rosie had done most of the talking during dinner by telling everything she had done that day and why Marissa and Cody were fighting again. John told stories from the surgery, and Sherlock complained about Mycroft and Greg wanting to come and visit Saturday. Tim had just sat back, listened and enjoyed the delicious meal and peaceful family. His own parents were divorced and he hated his new stepmom and sisters. His own mom was never home and most of the time he just ate alone. He watched how Rosie interacted with her parents, who still loved each other so clearly it almost hurt to look at it.
The priest was on about everybody coming together or something like that but Sherlock couldn’t concentrate, the urge to twitch was burning him up inside, he was a volcano about to erupt. “Shut up, you fucking paedophile!” Sherlock flooded with embarrassment, regretting the words the instant they escaped him. He winced at the harshness of his tone pushing his hands further into his knees, hoping he’d sink into the floor. Another twitch ran over him forcing his body to scrunch and shiver. His face glanced towards Mycroft *the perfect brother * and he saw the expression of embarrassment over his features. He carried on chewing his lips to shreds, eyes brimming with tears. His musician’s nails dug into the oak of the bench as he rocked himself needing some kind of control as another urge built. After the inevitable awkward silence because of his untimely outburst the priest continued to speak. Sad but sweet words about how she was always there for those that loved her. Sherlocks face scrunched and a piggish snort and whistle entered the quiet space when Sherlock heard his name. Quickly he shook his head, to blur the images and expressions spreading across the priest’s face. “Cunt licking fucking faggot!” An annoying tic then brought itself to the surface as Sherlock through his arms and legs out in a childlike motion. “You dye your hairy pubes ginger!” Sherlock gulped. Mycroft tugged his tie face turning beetroot, the funeral guests whispered remarks of anger and judgement and Sherlock felt like an outcast. He motioned for the priest to continue.
The room which he was in – the chapel – held at a maximum twelve people, but his brother was still embarrassed. To Sherlock it was expected, Mycroft was basically the British government and he was merely a broken boy.  The two young men were only five years apart but it felt like a lifetime. The Holmes brothers were sat on the same, wooden bench but a few empty spaces were between them. Mycroft wasn’t processing any emotion at all towards the death of his once treasured mother, it was surprising though. The man was a reptile!
John was searching the street screaming like a maniac . " What's happening here then ?" Jim cackled pilling a cigarette from his back pocket and lighting it in one quick flick . " Oh my god , I hit her , it was a person , probably a pregnant woman and I killed the baby too !" John panicked , running down the empty cobbled road . " John it was just a FUCK FUCKETY FUCK pothole " Sherlock said calmly as Jim leaned against the car bonnet admiring the situation .
An few hours later , Jim was sweating like an animal in a cage , beads dripping down his tight forehead . Sherlock watched him curiously wondering why he was still wearing his thick hoodie in this heat . He was about to ask when the car bounced over a pot hole in the road . " STOP THE CAR " John screamed as Jim immediately pulled the car to a holt . "HELL IS FOR HORSES " Sherlock ticked as it skidded to a stop . Jim laughed as John frantically ran into the road .
Sherlock began to tuck into his fries his oceans of eyes casting over to the small Irish boy that was stuck in his mind . He watched Jim's skeletal hands pick at the small portion of food in front of him , judging the meal as poison . Sherlock noticed Jim's bird like features turn in his direction and began to set his face into a smile . At that precise moment a tic seized ahold of him , slightly jolting his throat and throw his head to the side . A fountain of food splattered the table , in Johns direction .
“Why are you here ?” John stated abruptly , but he needed to know why this adorable curly haired man was in a place like this .
He stared around the area after he had his food with him , looking upon each table of strangers who he deduced as soon as he saw  - Table one , schizophrenics and bipolar disorders , Table two eating disorders , Table three the depressed and last but not least Table four where only John sat . Sherlock walked slowly towards table four .
John gulped as Jim plopped his slender frame upon the single bed next to his own , without taking his befouled shoes off . Trying to ignore the voice screaming at him to do something John perched upon his own bed and opened his cherry red mouth . " um hello Jim I'm John Watson , John Watson , j-(John stopped himself from repeating himself again as if by magic and a slight smile formed upon him ) , and yes you seem to be " . Jim laughed and subconsciously itched a little at one of of the barely healed over cuts on his right forearm . John looked away slightly feeling like he himself was the intruder in that situation. Whilst looking away John glanced at Jim's shoes again , the voice bubbling inside of him . " Jim can you take your shoes off , and put them away , they're dirty , they're dirty , they're dirty...." John kept repeated as Jim looked flabbergasted and confused - he slightly wanted to watch and see johns OCD show to amuse his sadistic nature . But after Johns eyes began to water as he repeated the words for the fifteenth time Jim snapped out of his trance of excitement and took his shoes off and neatly stacked them under his bed .
Johns eyes gazed over the two laughing men by the riverside , and then he looked down at himself , he felt left out . Alone . He didn't want him and his condition to interrupt them so he slowly walked towards the car . After opening and closing the door twelve times - the perfect amount - he sat in the front seat and turned on classical Fm for him to fall back to sleep .
John began walking towards the bright blue door , he counted the squares on the pavement, careful not to step on any cracks ; or else what happened in the past may reoccur . He physically shuddered , sweat began to glisten his milky white forehead as he thought of that memory . He gulped the thoughts back down or else a flashback may happen and he really didn’t need that .
The room was white , but not white enough , he grunted and entered the rooms bathroom . Under the sink he noticed a bottle of bleach . Drink it ; his mind murmured . “No! “ John shouted aloud , there were some compulsions he just wouldn’t do . But then his eyes reviewed his new room , complete with two wardrobes and three single beds . It wasn’t clean. John gazed down upon the bleach within his hands and grabbed a towel . He calculated that he had at least an hour before his roommates arrived . An hour to make sure everything was just right .
Three weeks later it was when Jim was declared healthy enough to exit the hospital but Richard had sent him here to doctor hudson which merely flew past him ruined skull .
Sherlock's mind clouded over , anger swarming his head like bees as his tics were taking control of the situation , instead of himself . The man in the long grey coat did the one and only thing he could do , so Sherlock does to the rooms ensuite and shoved his head under a tap streaming water to try and stop himself from ticking anymore obscenity's .
John opened his cherry lips for the first time since his arrival . He cleared his throat . “ Hi , um I’m John Watson , I’m here becuase Mary made me but um i suffer from PTSD and Ocd , Ocd , Ocd” - not now he thought . “ I suffer from Ocd “ he repeated . Not good enough the voice told him . “ I have Ocd” . John cleared his throat three times . “ I have Ocd , I have Ocd , I have Ocd” . The voice vanished . Dr Hudson smiles sadly at him , and made a note in her notebook . Was she mocking him ?
He said angrily; the last thing John Watson needed was pity . “ I’m not John , i promise but I think you need to figure out how to better control your illness” She said . A faint smile tugged upon John’s lips - “ That would be nice , nice nice “ . Three times worked ; better . Dr Hudson smiled , her approach had worked , she had a new patient .
Sherlock  consumed the cheesy chips placed in front of his slightly shaking hands and then followed his roommates actions . His stepped from the room , thankfully not ticking like a crazy person again (though he guessed that was what he was due to Mycroft's reactions to him ) .
Dr Hudson’s-behavioural facility ; John read the title with increasing disgust - 11 vowels,  one off the perfect amount , well nothing about where he was going was perfect  . He didn’t want to go here . Nobody did . But his demons plagued him , constantly he counted to figures of twelve until he felt good , at peace with the world . But it was fucking irritating , like can you imagine constantly doing rituals , following an endless loop ?
They reached the cafeteria when Jim piped up “ And finally the sweet smell of gourmet shit “ he sang . Even the smell of food was making him nauseous he was looking fat apparently and he just couldn’t eat . He couldn’t . He wouldn’t !
Sherlock noticed Jim straight away he was squared away from most of the other patients , placed next to a fifteen year old girl on a feeding tube and a heavily overweight boy that hid himself away from Sherlock the moment he looked at him. A guard was watching over the three individuals like a hawk ,obviously making sure they devoured the correct portion of hot dogs and chips that was in front of them . Jim beamed a sweet smile though as soon as Sherlock clasped eyes upon him . Sherlock laughed to himself his throat jumping making squeaking noises as he ordered some cheesey fries .
Sherlock was leaning against the back of the wagon. Glowering. John got food and water out for them both. He held Sherlock's plate out to him. Sherlock didn't look at John and kept his arms crossed. John set the plate down on the back of the wagon next to Sherlock and took his own plate around to the front of the wagon. He ate slowly. When he was finished, he went to the back of the wagon.
John crouched down and pulled Sherlock's right boot off. He set it down next to the pack. "Do you want to sleep again, or would you like to sit up?"
Warmth filled John's heart. "Yes, you do." He tenderly pushed Sherlock's hair back from his forehead. "Better than anyone."
"What are you talking about, Sherlock? You looked like a model and I was wearing ratty old jogging clothes!"
"You're going to have to start trusting me, you know. If I'd wanted to rob or hurt you, I'd have done it already."
"That's what I thought, too, but it turned out Mom had a friend and her daughter Clara over. Clara and Harry couldn't take their eyes off each other."
When he heard Sherlock's knock, he got up and opened the door. He looked up at Sherlock and gasped, his mouth dropping open.
John nudged Sherlock's right knee. "Her handsome prince gone? How could she be glad of that?" He smiled encouragingly.
He leaned all the way in, but stopped just short of contact. He kept Greg suspended for a delicious moment before giving a teasingly light brush of his lips against Greg’s. He flexed his fingers in his hair, clutching at it with barely-restrained lust. “Take us home,” he repeated quietly, and kissed him. He let the kiss bloom slowly, taking the time to let Greg open for him.
The bigger man rolled his eyes. "If you see anything unusual, there's a reward being offered. The King wants him brought back."
Sherlock could see John trying to calm himself. He wanted nothing more than to take John into his arms. His heart, and even his arms, ached with need. He closed his eyes.
Sherlock's eyes were moving over John's body again. John knew his jogging shorts didn't leave much to the imagination. And he knew he was... generously proportioned. "Do you mind if I sit with you for a minute, Sherlock?"
Then Sherlock was at the rail a couple of feet away from him. He hadn't been sick, but he looked pale. "You all right?" John asked him. Sherlock nodded slowly and leaned against the rail.
John guided Sherlock down into his bed, crawling on top of him. Sherlock pulled John down and immediately wrapped his legs around him. John moaned quietly at the feel of Sherlock's warm body underneath his as his hips instinctively pushed forward against Sherlock's.
Sherlock nodded helplessly, a whimper escaping him as John ducked back down. John shoved Sherlock's shirt up and freed him from his underclothes. He grasped Sherlock's cock and ran his tongue up the entire length. Sherlock choked back his cry of pleasure, struggling to keep quiet. John showed no mercy, taking Sherlock's cock into his mouth and stroking with his tongue.
“See what?” Sherlock teased. He settled his body against John’s, heavy and hot. He nuzzled into John’s neck and inhaled deeply. He hummed in appreciation as he took in John’s scent.
John put his hand around his dog tags. Sherlock moved over him, holding himself up with both arms. John looked up into Sherlock's eyes and let go of the tags. They fell onto his own chest as he wrapped one arm around Sherlock's waist. He put his other hand in Sherlock's hair and pulled him down into a deep kiss.
Sherlock was sitting up, looking down at his own knees. He'd pulled the sheet up to his chest. "Do you want me to go?" he asked quietly without looking up.
Sherlock let out a low, dirty chuckle. He tipped his head back and moved both ebony-tipped hands up to his collarbone. He began caress his own body devastatingly slowly, starting with his long, elegant neck. His leathery wings unfurled, their dark peaks and curves framing his alabaster body. As he moved down to his pectorals, he brought his head back down to make eye contact with John. His eyes burned with desire. John’s mouth dropped open as he strained against the ropes. An agonized noise escaped him.
Sherlock looked up from the record crate, turning to face John. "I want to hear you say it. Why do you have to be careful?"
"And they just happened to fit you perfectly? Stop it, Prince Sherlock. I know it's you." John crossed his arms and stared sternly at the prince.
Sherlock pushed John down gently so he sat on the bed. "Don't care." He bent to pull John's shoes off, then sat next to John and started taking off his own shoes. "Take your clothes off."
John's eyes fell closed as he moaned softly. "Yes, Sherlock. God, yes!" He opened his eyes. Sherlock looked into John's eyes for a moment before lowering his gaze. He reached down and passed his graceful fingers lightly over John's cock. John gasped in pleasure. His cock twitched toward Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head insistently. "No. No, that puts you at risk. It's horrible enough that I've endangered John. I won't endanger you, too."
"Showing up with a male partner in tow will cause a problem, Sherlock." He looked down. "Believe me," he added darkly.
When they were cleaned up, they went into the living room and collapsed onto the couch. John pulled Sherlock close. Neither of them had bothered rebuttoning their shirts. Sherlock rested his head on John's uninjured shoulder. He put his hand on John's chest, toying idly with his dog tags.
John and Sherlock stayed at the restaurant until it closed. John kept catching himself gazing at Sherlock instead of eating. He was transfixed by the way the light from the candle on their table played across Sherlock's face and caught in his eyes with a verdigris glow. He was admiring the graceful curve of Sherlock's neck when Sherlock brought his hand up and rubbed at it as though the muscles were cramping. John's breath caught. As Sherlock lowered his hand, he dragged it down through his open collar. John felt his cheeks going pink. And then he saw the wicked little smirk that passed briefly over Sherlock's face.
John sighed against Sherlock's shoulder. "Neither have I, Sherlock." He lifted his head and put a hand in Sherlock's hair. He drew Sherlock in for a tender kiss. Then he put their foreheads together for a moment, stroking his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
John spoke quietly. "We can't use your real name here, darling. If anyone hears it, they could tell the King's men."
"The office was meant to be the second bedroom. If you're worried about what people will think if you live here with me, we can make it your bedroom."
John took half a step back, his hands still on Sherlock's waist. Sherlock's chest rose and fell rapidly as he gasped for breath. John looked up into Sherlock's eyes. They were filled with desire. John was trembling with need. He knew what he wanted to do. He hadn't done it yet because he'd been nervous and, frankly, intimidated by Sherlock's considerable skill. But, looking up into the heat in Sherlock's eyes, he knew it was time. John smiled wolfishly and dropped down onto his knees, eyes still locked on Sherlock's.
John was gratified to see the spark of attraction in his eyes as they swept over him. It always did his ego good to be able to hold his own next to Sherlock, with those sharp cheekbones and those mysterious eyes and those miles-long legs.
John squeezed Sherlock lightly and dropped a kiss on the side of his neck. He stood up and held out his hand to help Sherlock up. "Come on. It's not far now."
The sky was pale with the approaching sunrise when John opened his eyes. Sherlock's head rested heavily on his chest. John held him a little tighter for a few minutes, memorizing the way Sherlock felt in his arms.
"Gorgeous," Sherlock whispered reverently. John watched as Sherlock reached up with both hands and put his fingertips against John's collarbone. "You're absolutely gorgeous, John." Sherlock trailed his fingers down John's chest and over his stomach.
John couldn't keep the grin off his face. "Sherlock." He stopped in front of him and leaned heavily on his cane as he went down onto his stronger knee.
John looked at Sherlock again. He saw Sherlock picking his crutches up and moving to stand. John started to help him, but another bout of nausea hit him and he had to return to the rail.
John opened his eyes. He pulled Sherlock more tightly into his arms. "God, no, of course not." He felt some of the tension leave Sherlock's body. "Not with you. Victor, however, I could murder with my bare hands."
As Sherlock watched, John put the bag of flatbread into a pack which clearly already had several items inside. Sherlock quickly closed his eyes when John lifted the pack. He listened as John placed the pack under the foot of the bed. Sherlock kept his eyes closed for several minutes.
John grinned. He picked up Alice Cooper's new album, "Lace and Whiskey." He held it out to Sherlock, fully expecting the same disgusted expression that the iced tea had inspired a week ago. "I was thinking about getting this one. What do you think?"
"John." John's eyes opened again. "You are magnificent. I've never seen anything as beautiful as you are."
John's hands seized Sherlock's hips. He trailed his tongue down Sherlock's stomach, stopping only when he reached the waistband of Sherlock's trousers.
John snickered again and pulled the glass back. "Sorry. Couldn't resist." He set the glass down. "So, what do you do, Sherlock?"
“Is that meant to be better?” He scrubbed his hand over his face. “Full marks for creativity, I suppose. I haven’t heard that one before.”
John dragged his hand down Sherlock's neck and over his chest and stomach. He wrapped his hand around Sherlock's cock and held it firmly. Sherlock convulsed in pleasure. His mouth broke away from John's as he cried out loudly. "Oh! Oh, God!
After a few minutes spent reviewing his biographical details, Holmes leaned forward and spoke quietly and earnestly. "When I met John Watson, I was 32 years old and had long since given up on love. I didn't expect to have any type of meaningful relationship, let alone find a lifelong partner. Having him with me for the last 38 years has been more than I could ever deserve. And he -"
"Hear me out. I want to make it clear that I don't want you to do anything you aren't ready for. Say the word and we stop. No matter what. Promise me that you will tell me if you want to stop or take a break. At
The bell on the door at Angelo's jangled as John walked in. He looked around. No Sherlock. John was a little relieved, actually. He could use a few minutes to settle his nerves. He started poking through the record crates, seeing a few discs that caught his interest.
John was surprised by how shocked Sherlock seemed to be that John had made crutches for him. How was it that he seemed so unused to people doing things for him? Don't princes have things done for them constantly? There was so much he didn't know about Sherlock.
The glow from Sherlock’s body surged as John’s pleasure reached its peak. John thought for a fleeting moment that he felt Sherlock trembling with it, but in the grip of his climax he couldn’t know what was real.
"Well, then. I'd have to say... since the lab at Bart's." John looked up at Sherlock. His cheeks were now quite pink.
"This is incredible." John took the glass and crossed to the window. Sherlock followed. "I can understand why you don't want to move out. You can see for miles from here. I can see my apartment building." He pointed to the east, across Brush Creek.
"Yes." John smiled at Sherlock. He hoped Sherlock wouldn't see the pain under his smile. But when he saw the concern still clouding Sherlock's face, he knew Sherlock
John clutched at Sherlock's shirt, still unsteady on his feet. He took a half step back and leaned against the table, breathing heavily.
John closed and camouflaged the hatch. He walked a slow circle around his house and went back inside. When he went in, he and Sherlock smiled shyly at each other. The fire was dying.
"You'd better start this car and get us out of here, because I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to keep my
"Of course not. You've been on the run and had a traumatic injury." John gave him a reassuring smile and lifted the fur coverlet so Sherlock could slowly turn his body and put his legs under it. He put his hand on Sherlock's back to steady him so he could lower his upper body back down into the bed.
The audience quieted while the orchestra tuned. When they were finished, Sherlock took his seat. Lestrade walked onto the stage. The audience applauded and the entire orchestra stood. Lestrade bowed and stepped onto his podium.
"Oh, yes, my love." John's hands passed Sherlock's waist. His left hand gripped Sherlock's hip as his right grasped Sherlock's cock.
Sherlock's expression went soft. He began to relax. "John... I love you so much I don't know what to do. I don't want to... mess this up."
"Yes." John rolled his eyes with a quiet groan. "I've told her a million times to stop setting me up, but it's no use."
Sherlock untied his own breeches and tipped his head back, sighing in relief as he took himself in hand. The ache in his jaw only increased his arousal because it was a reminder of what he and John had just done.
John rolled toward Sherlock and put a hand into his hair. He pulled Sherlock closer and kissed him deeply. He drew back and looked at Sherlock. "I love you so much, Sweetheart."
"We need to keep moving," the bigger man said. "I'll need to take a look inside the house. And we'll take the rabbit."
"Not at all. Please." Sherlock took a step back so John could come in. "I'm glad you're here," he added quietly as John passed him. He closed the door.
John’s cock throbbed under the demon’s scrutiny, harder than John had thought was even possible. His head fell back, eyes falling closed as his vision began to go fuzzy around the edges.
John chuckled quietly and gave Sherlock another squeeze. He opened his eyes and turned to face the window again. Sherlock's arms were still wrapped around him. John took another deep breath and let it out slowly, willing his fear to dissipate. He opened the envelope and pulled out the ticket. TWA. Kansas City Mid Continent to London Gatwick. First Class.
In the blink of an eye Sherlock was on top of him again. He seized a handful of John’s hair. John yelped in pain and shock.
Intense pleasure washed over John. He moaned loudly, his eyes rolling back. To his dismay, Sherlock immediately let go. John whimpered at the loss.
John smiled wickedly and sat up. Sherlock huffed out an impatient whimper as John slipped out of his grasp. He pushed his legs back and forth for a moment, looking up at the ceiling. He grabbed the baluster again with more force than was strictly necessary and gave John a pleading look.
Sherlock shook his head again. "No, you were incredible. You had everything under control before I could even process what was happening. And the way you kept everyone calm... You're truly extraordinary, John."
John had never felt such intense pleasure. It spiralled out endlessly. Animalistic moans he had never heard himself (or anyone else) make escaped him uncontrollably. Sherlock looked up at him from under his lashes. His eyes had begun to glow brightly. John gazed back in wonder. Then something else occurred to him. Sherlock’s eyes sparked with amusement when he saw John realize that Sherlock had not yet come up for air.
John finally found his voice. "Thank you, Sherlock." He paused again. "I suppose I should get you back inside." He closed the cellar hatch and recovered it with leaves. He began leading Sherlock back to the house by another route.
Sherlock tilted his head downward and forced his eyes to focus on John's. He shook his head. "No, no,
John had expected to finish embarrassingly quickly, but Sherlock was incredibly skilled at pulling him back from the edge of climax before he could fall. He thought distantly that it must be another of Sherlock’s many gifts.
John's eyes softened. "All right, Sherlock." He took his hand away from Sherlock's. The top of Sherlock's hand felt cold without John's. John took a small bite of stew. "You, too," he said, gesturing at Sherlock's plate.
John grabbed Sherlock's left arm with both of his hands and deliberately slid off the edge of the bed to the floor, turning around as he dropped. He landed on his knees, facing Sherlock. He looked up. Sherlock was wrecked. He'd seemed completely in control as he'd touched John, but now that John had come, he was falling to pieces.
John giggled, turning to look at Sherlock. "We smudged your eyeliner." Sherlock grinned and let his head fall back farther, closing his eyes. John continued more soberly. "Thank you for... trying to be quiet."
John laughed. He and Sherlock sat and talked until the cafe started to fill with customers for dinner. Their waiter had been to their table a few times asking if they needed anything before giving them up as a lost cause.
"I know. I've got you." John licked his hand, pushed it into Sherlock's open trousers, and wrapped it around his cock. He dragged his thumb across the head. Sherlock shuddered and moaned loudly in relief. John didn't try to make it last, knowing that Sherlock was already incredibly close. He stroked Sherlock steadily, twisting slightly over the head. Sherlock buried his face in John's shoulder, crying out, "John, John, oh God,
This is the first fic I've ever written, so it probably isn't very good. If you have tips, or anything, please let know! I would love to know what you think!
“I’m honestly not surprised; did I ever tell you what they did to my ex? They got him ended up in a mental hospital, because my father ‘deduced’ he was going to die any day now?! He definitely was not; he was just an arsehole.” “They did not!” “Hmm, totally did, still don’t regret it either. Though, I don’t either…” They laughed even harder.
“Did you have fun at the movies?” “Yes, we, uhm, we saw James Bond, Fly again.” Tim shifted in his chair. “O, is that number 45 or 46?” John had never kept track of those films. He poured some more bouillon on to the rice to make it absorb more liquid. “Awfully inaccurate those movies. He should have died in the first movie, let alone the rest of them.” “Father always says he hates something while he secretly loves them, he has seen them all. Just won’t admit it.” Rosie smiled at her father who looked at her as though she had said something ridiculous. “She is right, you know. Sherlock loves all crime and action films, and then complains they are inaccurate.” “Dickhead” Sherlock murmured under his breath, and pretended to read his book again. “Love you too, darling”, John smiled and Rosie offered Tim a drink.
