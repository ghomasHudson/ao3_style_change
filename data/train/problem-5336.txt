“Aha!” Dean says as he pulls out clippers, turning around to brandish them at his small audience of two. “See? We’ll get rid of these lice in no time.”
“Neither of us can account for the future,” he starts, “but I…well.” He pauses for a second, considers his words, then says simply: “If you don’t understand my commitment to you by now, you’re an idiot, Dean. Whatever happens, I will stay by your side as long as you’ll have me. And if I am taken away, I won’t stop until I find my way back. Do you understand that?”
“But you said—” Cas stops himself, working to reign in the irritation in his voice. The “bitch factor,” Crowley had called it once, which only made him feel bitchier. Still, there’s no use getting irritated now, and he can tell that Dean is already on edge from this conversation. “I didn’t mean it like that. Enjoying your cooking is one of the few things that comes easily to me as a human. I only meant…”
Dean gives no reaction. He just continues to stare, the pinched and slightly consternated look on his face holding fast. “I know.”
*    *    *
“I take it you appreciated the compliments,” is the only thing he can think to say.
Cas is committed to trying out Dean’s theory, and when he commits to something, he refuses to “half-ass” it. This is something he knows about himself. Nora often told him that at the Gas-N-Sip, commenting on his “commitment” and “follow-through.” And he does follow through; he even looks up Pavlov. Conditioning, it’s called. Dean neglected to tell him that the original study was done on dogs, but that doesn’t bother him as much as he thought it would. Humans are just another form of animal, and he’s just another form of human.
Love, he thinks. Affection.
“Me?” For a second, Cas doesn’t know what Dean’s talking about and he really doesn’t care. But Dean looks at him expectantly, so he stops to think for a moment; he has to tilt his head to help collect his thoughts. “Oh, the affirmations?”
Dean shakes his head, eyes fixed on the ground. “No, but you don’t
Dean grins. “I used to talk to him while I ate, try to convince him it was good. Just me knocking back a can of peas, going—” he mimes eating out of a can with a spoon, and Cas feels a twitch in the corner of his mouth— “
Cas smiles, holding Dean’s face in his hands like a precious object, until the rest of the conversation finally comes back to him. “You really thought I was lying,” he sighs.
“Is that so,” Dean mutters, running his own hands through his hair in a pantomime of Cas’s touch. The need to itch is gone, he thinks bitterly, but fat load of good that did; it’s already been replaced with a much heavier longing. With a sigh, he eases himself off the chair and turns around to find the angel standing face to face with him.
“Me neither,” Dean sighs. “I wanted to tell you—”
as Dean takes pictures of his hair half-dried and half-soapy, sticking up all angles. There’s no real heat in his thought-voice.
“Yes,” Cas agrees. “I am.” Maybe Dean misunderstood?
The ghost, an old woman with frantic eyes, corners him after his slip-up, but Dean is on her in a second, slicing through her wispy form with a crowbar.
It's Dean who seems more put off by the whole thing, which doesn’t make sense considering it was his suggestion. Another missing piece of the puzzle, Cas thinks.
The first time it happened can be chalked up to bad luck, unfortunate but nothing personal. The second time is pure cosmic punishment.
“Yeah, neither do I, sunshine, but that doesn’t mean—“ He huffs. “Look, it’s fair game, okay? An eye for an eye for a positive reinforcement or whatever. Fair game.”
One minute Cas is floundering, and the next there’s two hands clutching at his t-shirt and a warm mouth on his. He doesn’t know what to do for a second; he keeps his eyes open, while Dean’s are screwed so tightly shut that he’s afraid Dean is trying to block out the whole experience while it’s happening. And then he remembers—
“Mhmph,” Dean mumbles. “Go to bed.”
Cas seems almost frantic as he rushes into the room where they’ve been waiting, but luckily, Dean notes, it doesn’t look like he smashed through glass to get here.
He burns the eggs and gets a spoon stuck in the garbage disposal. “This is good,” he says out loud, but all he can think about is how he should be healing Dean.
“I didn’t say it hurts. Just itches,” he deflects—and crap, now he’s thinking about the itch, and how he’s been trying not to scratch it this whole time since he doesn’t want Jack to feel guilty again, but hell, it’s less the itch and more the fact that he has bugs in his hair, little bugs just crawling up there! Little, tiny bugs that he can’t pick out because they’re too tiny!
Sam is up in an instant, jumping out the chair and putting space between him and Dean. “Oh, no. No, no, no. Not again.”
“Bullcrap.”
Cas feels his mouth pull into a deep frown; he tries to conjure his signature expression, the one that says “the literal meaning of this sentence is stupid,” but it’s tinted with too much heartbreak.
Love and affection and
He has some carry-overs from Jimmy, a bit of muscle and neuron memories, but not all of those are good—the penchant for red meat, for one, and the twinge in his lower back. He doesn’t think lower back pain is the answer that Dean’s looking for, though.
Jack, who’s still sitting at the table, looking completely unbothered by the whole scene.
Sam eyes the clippers warily, probably worried about his own luscious locks, but nods in agreement.  “Dean’s right,” he sighs. “If you want, we can go buy lice shampoo and a comb, but we really need to get back to the books soon. And as long as you’re staying in the bunker with us, you can’t just keep the lice in your hair.”
“And I’m not leaving,” he finishes, never taking his eyes off Dean. “I’m not leaving you.”
Jack doesn’t respond, talking instead to whoever’s on the other end of his call: “Yeah, he’s gonna cut his own hair, too.”
Jack looks up immediately. Dean continues: “It’s fine, okay? Don’t feel bad. This is a minor issue—actually, it’s not an issue at all. We’ll just do what me and Sammy used to do as kids, just chop off the hair and start again.”
Dean sounds confused, so Cas looks up; and yes, he is confused. His eyebrows are all knitted together and Cas wants to smooth them out with his thumbs. He settles for trying to explain instead. “If this is a Pavlov thing, I don’t need it. I was making mistakes yesterday, but it’s okay. I’m learning and I can adapt. You don’t need to stroke my ego.”
“You’ve seen grown men with dried shampoo in their hair?” He has no idea why that thought makes him feel jealous.
Cas blinks. Dean has stopped, and now he’s just staring. He doesn’t usually stop when he gets himself worked up like this. Cas isn’t sure if this is one of those moments where he should push Dean, or wait and see if he explains himself. He tries the first: “Dissect your what?”
in his face, to his utter irritation. But in the end, the evidence was surmounting, and it all pointed to one conclusion.
“Don’t make me say it.”
Cas nods and returns to his plate; he chooses to be content with how the conversation ended and to consider the matter settled. But when he looks up a minute later, he finds the blush still there on Dean’s cheeks.
“...Kids,” Sam finishes slowly.
“Buddy, I’ve seen grown men with dried vomit in their hair. Far as I’m concerned, you’re ahead of the game.” Cas must not look convinced, because Dean sighs and puts a hand on his shoulder, leaning in almost conspiratorially. “I mean it, Cas. Who cares if you don’t have your beauty routine figured out yet? You’re still a damn smart guy. You were the one who identified the spook yesterday, and that matters. Just... just take the win and move on, okay? Over and out?”
*    *    *
Dean is still waiting. He can’t go into all of it, the sleepless nights and days without food, but Dean is making an effort, so he does the best he can with the words he knows.
For a moment, Cas isn’t sure if that counts as permission. But Dean is looking at him so expectantly that he feels he has to do something, so he closes the remaining distance and tentatively offers out his arms.
“I know.” He gives one last nip to Dean’s jaw and pulls back. “Was it really so bad?”
“It’s because I feel love and affection for him,” Cas finishes, like it’s the easiest thing in the world to say. “That’s why I talk the way I do. That’s why I’m protective of him.”
“It’s, like—
And just like that, the hands pull back from his hair and there’s a light tap on his shoulder.
He pushes it too far the next morning.
Now, he lies in bed with Dean snoring at his side, watching his hand as he combs through Dean’s hair in slow, leisurely strokes. Tomorrow, these two hands will pick out food at the market with Sam, and then they will make scrambled eggs with Dean at his side to teach him, and then they will be free to do anything and everything they want.
Dean doesn’t bother responding; at this point, he’s afraid of what noises might come out of his mouth.
The fingers in his hair are light and exploring, running up the sides of his head and coming back down to scratch at the nape of his neck. The touch is soft, too soft, enough to make him want to shiver. He tries to hold himself tight against the onslaught and wait for the eventual smiting, but it never happens—Cas just keeps coming back for more, dipping his fingers in and out of Dean’s hair.
The biggest thing egging Cas on is that Dean never tells him to stop. In fact, he’s spending more time with Cas than ever, and he seems to have more energy, too, always helping out around the bunker. Cas is quick to praise him on this, of course; he never misses an opportunity. They continue their noontime meals as well, and Cas pleased to notice that the dish is more elaborate each day.
“This is good,” he whispers, smiling to himself in the dark.
On top of it all, Cas tries to be kind to himself. He starts condensing his affirmations into a morning session and a night session—just a few quick lines in his head when he wakes up and goes to bed. He’s forgotten twice already, though. It’s not that he wants to abandon the original purpose of this test, he assures himself; he just has other things on his mind now.
Cas nods again. He’s heard that advice before. He just hasn’t found it very helpful.
“Holy crap. Did you Pavlov me into cooking you breakfast?”
*    *    *
Cas has to stop himself from smiling.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut, but angels are falling all around him. He opens his eyes and the angels are still there.
,” Dean continues, and with such gusto that Cas is worried he’ll stop there. He opens his mouth to protest, but thinks better of it—if he waits, Dean will likely explain.
“I’m just pissed in general,” he says instead, “because of this whole—” Dean waves vaguely at his hair, too worked up to finish the sentence, but the line of confusion across Cas’s forehead only deepens.
“I don’t know, Cas! You tell me. Because you wanted to see how I would react? Just like all the other times?”
Cas frowns. “I like your cooking. That’s what I’m trying to say. It’s
Dean takes a shaky breath. Cas’s gaze shifts, watching his Adam’s apple move up and down. “Everything you said… it was all true?”
His final death turned out to be not so final at all, though the “how” and “why” on that are still a bit fuzzy. Dean was the only one on the scene when he reappeared in the bunker, and so far, he hasn’t been very forthcoming on details. Cas can sense some sort of change with what little grace he has left, a shift in power big enough to tear the cosmic order to shreds—but Dean won’t say what it is, only that Sam and Jack are off taking care of it.
Surprisingly, Dean seems to calm down, and Cas lets out a quiet sigh of relief. He spoke too quickly again; he didn’t thoroughly consider the implications and connotations of “lying on top,” even though it was meant to be an innocent offer. The last thing he wants at this moment is to make it seem like he’s taking liberties with Dean or his body, not now that his love sits between them like a—like an elephant, as the saying goes.
“Right, uh.” There’s nothing he can do but shrug. Cool as ever, Winchester. “I mean, sure, if he wants.”
Cas can’t help himself; he leans in, curiosity getting the best of him. “What did you do?”
“Be patient, Dean.”
“Yes,” Cas realizes, and feels that familiar rush of pride. “Yes, I did.”
He sounds nervous, though. “So, you—you, uh, stuck with the truth, or stuff you thought was true or whatever. For what? Didn’t want to tamper the results?”
“Right, well. Thanks received. You’re welcome.”
“Why would I study something I wasn’t interested in?”
“I know it hasn’t been easy,” Dean tries again, but they both know that he said that already outside the Gas-N-Sip, so he switches tactics a third time. “I just, uh, wanted to say, good.... work. Out there. You did good, tiger.”
A finger traces along his ear and he almost gasps. “What are you—? This isn’t—last time when you, uh, you know, you—”
It doesn’t take an expert in human behavior, he thinks, to figure out what’s being unsaid here. He can piece it together from the nervous edge in the other’s voice and the warmth between them and the way that Dean looks like a man at peace, those beautiful eyelashes brushing the tops of his cheekbones, and it’s—it’s unfathomable. That he could lie here with Dean now, knowing that his family never gave up on him; that Dean would take his dying confession and hold it tight for months until it could be safely returned.
“Are you kidding? I friggin’ Pavlov’d that kid. That’s what you gotta do sometimes. Sometimes your body, it...” Cas watches as a furrow appears in Dean’s brow. “It doesn’t know what it likes or doesn’t like, not really. So you have to tell it.”
He and Dean sit in silence as he eats, working the food slowly and methodically between his teeth. Eggs are a strange texture—he feels like he tried them once before, but he can’t remember when. Sometime long before Dean Winchester.
If there was ever something close to truth, a singular universal truth, he would find it in Dean’s eyes. The same defiant eyes that challenged him when they first met, pulling him down to Earth the same way he raised Dean from hell—meeting in the middle, as they always do. Those eyes have never led him astray, not really; they’ve led him where he needs to go.
Cas frowns, twisting his head behind him to look at the way his body drapes over Dean’s, the way their legs tangle and intertwine. “What, is this different from before?” Maybe he miscalculated the angle, or maybe he had his hands positioned differently last time?
Dean follows the movement, too. “Hate to break it to you, buddy, but that’s just kind of how it is. Fake it ‘til you make it, and all that.”
“Maybe. Not the worst.” His voice is unsteady.
Dean freezes, and—well, Cas hadn’t really planned to say that out loud, but he can’t help the twinge of delight when he sees the blush deepen. So maybe he does want to push this a little further; he’s only human, his mind supplies, and for the first time that thought makes him want to break out into a grin.
“Oh.” Jack blinks, head tilted. “Are we not supposed to have little bugs in our hair?”
Sam is apprehensive at first. “You’re trying to… trick yourself into being happy? Seriously? You can’t just gloss over your problems and pretend like they’re not there,” he tries to argue, but one look between them and they both understood the irony of that statement. Instead, he settles on: “And you’re taking this advice from
That was where the story would end if everything went according to plan. As for this recent turn of events, he thinks—well, it’s unexpected, to say the least.
“Yes,” Cas says instinctively. And then: “Except for the comment about the shirt. That was mostly a joke.”
As if reading his mind, Cas drops a hand down to the side of his head and starts rubbing slow circles into his temple. Maybe there’s some grace in his massages, too, or maybe it’s just Cas, because all at once, Dean starts to feel the tension in his body drain out—spilling like an open wound.
Cas can feel a smile bubbling up, but he schools his face into a more neutral look. “That was awful.” He widens his eyes to look even more earnest. “I received no pleasure from that.”
“Dean!” Sam squawked, pulling his arms free. He paused and scrunched his face up at Dean. “Tell me you aren’t,” he said. Dean had no idea what he was talking about. “Tell me you aren’t going to do that to Cas!”
The answer to that last one had better be a straight up ‘never’ or Dean would be having
“And if I’d’ve told you to knock it off, you would’ve right? And you’d never use those words against another person angrily, right?”
“It’s good,” Mary said.
“Jack calls you slurs?” Mary asked.
“I didn’t,” Sam told him.
“Oh,” Jack said. “That’s a good idea.”
Dean put his beer down. “You think your college boyfriend was a-a homosexual?”
“The flat hard backing of the couch leg is much better for his back that a soft, pillow-y cushion.” Cas sounded miffed.
“Great,” Sam said. “You’re here. We can start the movie.”
Dean didn’t even look at his dad. His hands were shaking slightly, so he clenched them tightly around the back of the chair. “Sam,” his voice a barely controlled tremor, “do you want to be here?” Dean realized it was anger. He was feeling anger.
Wednesday, Mary slept in.
Dean put a hand on Jack’s shoulder and gave him a tight smile. “Don’t worry about it,” he said.
“And another thing,” Dean said, incensed. “You picked all these gay ass movies -- what the hell was I supposed to think?”
John disregarded them with a wave of his hand. “No,” he said, “I don’t mean this best friend nonsense, or helping out with raising the child. I mean, a family. I’m sorry I didn’t do better Dean. Didn’t show you better. I know that’s on me.”
“You take that back!”
“This?”
“Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.” It was the first thing Cas had contributed to the conversation. Dean barely resisted plunging his head into his hands. “The world has progressed beyond your small minded and backwards views, Mr Winchester.” This was where Dean realized, with a sickening lurch and a very thoroughly out of a place rush of arousal, that Cas is very, very angry.
“I’m glad too, honey,” Mary told Sam and she was mostly sure it was true. “But I know that sometimes people --” She stopped. “Your brother and Cas. They’re --?”
“Oh, definitely,” Dean said, instantly. “I mean, lavender? Are you kidding me?”
“Sam,” Dean said. “It’s okay. I’m good. You know, I didn’t think I needed to say anything. ‘Cause the last time I saw dad, I told him I had a family. Thought that was enough. And it is. We’re enough of a family. You. Me. Cas’n’Jack. Eileen when she gets up here. Other people --”
“He wore a lot of lavender,” She started, hastily. “My homosexual -- boyfriend. Ex boyfriend. And cried after sex. In a bad way,” she clarified. “I think the sex was upsetting to him. That’s why I broke up with him. I didn’t realize then but. The sex was pretty bad for me too.”
“Mom,” Sam asked, when she got back home, four and a half hours later. “What the hell is this?”
talk to him that way.” Dean pushed his chair back into its place, tucked nicely under the table, the chair squeaking loudly across the now-silent room. “Actually,” he said, “I, uh. I think we’re done here.”
“How did you --”
“I’m going to punch you both,” Sam said. “This is sickening. And it’s sickening you make me watch it every morning.” He looked at Mary. “Oh,” he said, chuckling. “Trying to clean the kitchen?” Mary nodded. “Good luck with that.”
Cas looked displeased. “Jack,” he said. “You do not have to make me a cup of coffee.” Jack’s face fell. Cas floundered. “Unless you … want to?”
The room fell completely silent. Sam and Cas turned to look at Jack while Dean and Mary made direct eye contact with the table in front of them.
“Jesse and Cesar,” Dean said while lacing up his boots. “Got a death that’s honking like a case down around Odessa. Called me for a consult. Me and Cas were going to swing down real quick.”
Of course, it was a lot less cute when they were in the grocery story and Jack was explaining everything to the cashier who looked torn between whether she should call CPS or the police first.
“Oh.” Cas looked around. “I -- yes,” he agreed. “I should check up on Jack afterwards, though.”
“Yeah, buddy,” Sam said. “Just go light on the sex-life-with-my-brother details, kay?”
It looked like some sort of congealed, a green and brown mess. She thought she saw rice in there somewhere. She hesitated. “I have some chips,” she told him, then opened the door. “And I’m in the middle of watching some television right now. If you want to join me?”
“Jack,” Cas said, not quite reprimanding.
shoved out of the way.
He reached out for her hands to steady her and Mary let him. “It’s nothing bad,” she told Sam, who didn’t relax. “It’s just a question. I’ve missed so much and --”
Cas tilted his head. “Do you mean my sexual congress with Dean?”
“And I keep telling you,” Sam said without an ounce of patience, “that it’s about the principle.”
Jack was unperturbed. “Did I get it wrong?” He asked. He pursed his lips. “Sam was explaining to me how Dean hated gay people. I wanted it to be a surprise treat for him. The internet had a bunch of other suggestions, like fruit and f --”
“And,” Dean said, frowning, “I don’t cry during sex. I am great at sex. That’s not a homosexual -- gay -- thing,” he continued, ignoring Sam’s cries -- pleas, really -- to stop. “If anyone cries during sex, it ain’t me.”
“Cas, man,” he said, trying to forestall the argument.
“Dean,” Cas complained, good naturedly, “I do not think I can explain politics. I do not think I know enough about politics. That’s what I was asking.”
Dean laughed loudly. “No,” he said. “You “do not”.”
“Family,” Sam said blithely. He smiled at Mary.
“Dean,” Sam said slowly. “I was joking around. Or trying to piss off dad. And,” he added offhand, as an afterthought, “I mean, it was the right thing to do.”
“No, Dean,” Sam snapped back. “Obviously I don’t know!”
“No,” Sam said. “I -- uh --” The next words that tumbled out of his mouth surprised Sam more than Jack. What Sam meant to say was that no, it wasn’t a human thing, he was just in shock. What he said was: “Dean’s homophobic.”
“Yeah, they’re retired,” Dean said, “and that’s why they’re passing this one along to us.”
Dean laughed. “You know,” he said, pointing at her, “that’s exactly what I thought at first.”
“Yes. Us. I could no more help loving you than you can help your innate sexual orientation.”
“Dean -- what do you mean, you gave mom the talk? As much as I don’t want to think about it, you do have to know how babies were made, right Dean?”
“You and dad were really well matched, huh?”
Sam mulled it over. “Yeah,” he said. “They’re pretty insufferable.”
“No,” Cas said.
So she thought the kids would be safe with John.
So Monday night had not been a resounding success. It had actually left her more confused than before.
“She married dad!” Sam objected.
“See you around, Castiel.”
Cas ignored him, turning instead to Jack. “It is a bad thing to hate gay people,” Cas told the all-powerful being seriously. “They cannot help it.”
“Cooking is not a hereditary trait,” Cas told her and tilted his head to the side. “Though, I must admit. I sometimes wonder about that, with Jack. I’m afraid he shares my ineptitude with humanity.”
Dean turned around into Castiel. “I do,” he said. “I love you. It’s just that you can’t take me by surprise like that.”
“No!” Sam said.
started avoiding
Jack’s voice broke across Dean’s thoughts. It was small. It didn’t sound right coming from the most powerful being in the universe across a poorly repaired mahogany dinner table that looked like it was bought on sale at Lowe’s. “Oh,” Jack said. “I get it.”
Dean scoffed. “It was a Soviet Wall at best.”
“I wasn’t sure,” Mary admitted. “Are you?”
“Don’t hey me,” Sam said. “You’re lucky you didn’t die of cholesterol poisoning.” Then he winced because it might have been five years but five years still wasn’t enough time to get over your own death-on-earth.
“S’nothing,” Dean said.
“Dean,” Cas said. “Why are you making me argue with you before I’ve had coffee?”
They sat in the car to wait for Dean to answer the call of the wild. Mary checked the time again when he got back into the car. Just under eight hours left. Fantastic.
“I’m actually younger than you both,” she said. “You’re both almost forty.”
Cas turned his gaze balefully back to Dean. “I’m not that bad.”
“Of -- course,” Mary said, which turned out to be a terrible idea. Coming back to the Bunker from their run, Mary felt retroactively grateful towards her father for banning her from ever participating in aerobics classes.
“Leaving,” he said, starting to smile with Dean. “We’re leaving.”
unfair.
“Dean,” Cas said. “It’s probably nothing. You said so yourself.”
“I, uh, should get to my room,” Dean told her when they were done. “But.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Thanks for sharing and all that jazz. I’m here for you. If you ever want to talk more about, well, people.”
Mary stared at them. “I’m not a lesbian,” she said.
“Dean,” Cas said. “You make me more happy than anyone else ever has.”
Dean’s smile slipped a bit then came back. “No,” he said. “Or, yeah. But I’m, you know. So you can, you know. If you want. Tell me.” He licked his lips. “I know it’s hard and stuff but trust me. It’ll be better that way.”
“Actually,” Cas said. “I don’t mind staying. If you wanted to spend some time with your mother.”
When Dean -- emerged -- Sam was ready. He’d been thinking it over and he’d gotten a whole speech planned, starting with ‘You’re my brother and I love you’ and ending with ‘and that’s why we always, always lock the door’. It was a good speech. Sam had thought about writing it down, but Sam was a big boy. He was pushing forty. God. He was pushing
Dean shut him down with a wave of his hand. “There you go.” He shrugged, clearly uncomfortable, and Sam didn’t really know what else to say to that. So it was good that Cas took that moment to show up.
John interrupted him. “And this Cas fellow. He’s your father.” Few things with John are questions and only when John already knew the answer he wanted you to give.
Sam made them both green smoothies afterwards that made Mary wonder, briefly, if Sam was trying punishing her. He swore they were good for digestion. All they seemed to be good for was making Mary lunge for the toilet every time her stomach lurched.
"For the love of -- mom wasn't getting off to your weird ass old school girly mags, Dean," Sam hissed.
“What?” Dean yelped.
Dean cleared his throat. “Great job with the table, Jack.”
“God, I should’ve known you would be an asshole about coming out.”
“You really didn’t know?” Dean asked.
Dean flipped him the middle finger without taking his eyes off Cas and Sam grinned back. Sam was starting to feel surprised that he was surprised in the first place.
“I’m sorry,” Jack told him earnestly. “You’re very loud sometimes. I try really hard, though.”
Cas leaned in and kissed the corner of Dean’s mouth. Then the other corner. Then --
“Homophobic?” Jack asked.
“You do.”
Sam left. Mary turned to the kitchen table.
, she thought wryly.
“I have already seen you naked today, Dean,” Sam said in a concerningly high voice. “I think that I have been suitably punished for any transgressions --”
“John,” Mary muttered and glared at her husband. “Shut up.” It was one of the few things she’d said so far. Honestly, outside of the conversation they’d had after dinner with Jesse and his husband on earth, Dean wasn’t sure how his mom felt about all this. And honestly, watching her try to reign John in was a bit like looking into a distorted, fun home mirror of himself, age seventeen.
“Dean!”
“Got turned around,” Mary said, then forced a smile.
“I did yesterday,” he said, brightly.
Mary tried to clear her expression and look innocent. She didn’t think it worked, but he didn’t push, which suited her just fine.
That did not go according to plan. Which just meant she needed a new plan.
“I thought looking at the porn might … help.”
“Why?”
“That’s what I told him!” Dean agreed, loudly. “Still.” He pushed the onions around a bit. “Thought I’d ask. Just in case. You’d -- you’d tell me. If it wasn’t. If I wasn’t.” He cleared this throat. “Right?”
needs.”
Two and half days into Mary's return from her extended stay in Apocalypse World, and she still wasn't sure what to make of Cas. He was around. He often seemed miserable or, failing that, exhausted. Sometimes he would sit at the end of the kitchen table and watch Dean for what Mary had to assume were hours on end. He'd eat Dean's cooking, and let Dean dress him up, and complain about Dean waking him up too early in the morning. And then, sometimes, the angel that lived in their underground Bunker-home and liked to watch her oldest son sleep would forget to change the coffee filter and Mary would lose her mind a little. Two and a half days into her stay and Mary was going to lose her mind a lot if she didn't start getting some answers.
“Let me say this. I want to say this,” Dean insists. There’s no defiance in him now; he looks so beautiful under Cas, so earnest.
“Yeah, I know I don’t have to. I’m just, I’m saying it, Cas.”
I had the lice out of your hair.”
Cas raises an eyebrow. “No.”
“Dean, breathe,” Cas whispers, resting his palms flat on the other man’s shoulders and applying the slightest bit of pressure, letting gravity do the rest of the work so Dean can feel his weight like a comforting blanket. They settle into each other then, tense muscles turning into something softer and more pliant. “I’m here. I’m not leaving. We have time.”
anything while he's in the room.”
Cas rushes to explain before either of them can look too far into that sentence. “Like we did before, I mean. It helped me through that night, so I thought maybe feeling my presence, physically, would help solidify the fact that I’m,” still here, still the same, always and always in love, “alive again.”
Dean’s eyes flicker down to his mouth, if only for a second, and a wave of fondness seems to wash over him. “God, I’m glad you’re back,” he whispers. “I couldn’t—I couldn’t do it without you. Any of it.”
“This,” Cas said gravely. “You emotional “snit-fit”. As Claire says. What is happening?”
“Oh,” Mary said. “I suppose it’s not like they could get married anyway.”
Dean went to get the motel room.
Cas frowned. “I don’t understand. You liked it earlier --” Dean went bright red and Sam fell sideways out his chair. Cas, in a jolt, was at Sam’s side. Along with Dean.
“That’s what they’re called, Sammy. Besides, they were the bunker’s old school ones. You know, the pin ups? With the --”
“John,” Mary hissed.
“Great,” Sam said heavily. “Just great.”
“I could help!” Jack volunteered eagerly.
“And I’m twenty-nine,” Mary said. “Which means I win.”
Dean choked on his beer.
“No, seriously, dude. This is heaven. What, you concerned about the environment? We’re dead. This is as ethical as it’s going to get --”
“I can’t believe you, Dean. I really can’t.”
This time, Dean didn’t push Cas off.
Dean blanched. Mary smirked and dropped her bag onto the couch. “Alright,” she said, rubbing her hands together. “What’s next?”
“It is,” Sam insisted.
,” he added, as Dean opened his mouth. “Can we just watch the movie?”
“Yeah,” Sam confirmed honestly and carefully, looking at Dean. Dean, for his part, was taking another sip of beer.
“Why not?” Cas asked, grumpily. “I don’t think John Winchester should be in Heaven, let alone allowed to speak here.”
Dean forced himself to relax. “Right,” he said. “Sorry.”
“No,” Mary said slowly, “why do you think I’m going to -- come out?”
“Dean.” Sam sounded pained.
“Right,” Cas agreed, after a long pause. “And then the government has people that make choices. And govern, I suppose. And people vote for them? Dean, is that right?”
Dean blinked back something that started to sting in the back of his eyes and agreed. “Yeah,” he said. “After everything.”
“Dad,” Sam started, mystified. “Did you even hear what Dean said?” He turned to Dean. “Dude,” he said. “I can’t believe you said that.”
“Should we pause it?” Jack asked. Wordless, Cas grabbed the remote and paused it on a close up of someone's crotch and backside. He frowned at the TV screen and then the remote.
“I’m going to the bathroom,” Dean said.
“Man, what are you talking about?”
“I thought you did.”
Unfortunately, sleeping in meant that by the time she got to the Bunker’s kitchen for breakfast, her plan to ask Dean about going for a drive with him clutched tightly in her mind’s eye, everyone was already starting to gear up.
“No!” Sam blurted out. “I mean,” he took a breath and composed himself. “No!” he said, hysterically. Huh. Apparently he wasn’t as composed as he thought. Who knew! Who fucking knew!
He tilted his head. “Are you looking for something?”
“Alright,” Sam said. Then, as quickly as he could, he added “I love and accept you because you're my brother.”
“Very good, son,” Cas said in a dazed voice.
“Mom!” Sam said.
Dean hit Sam, lightly, across the chest. “They weren’t even mine,” Dean protested. “Just some weird crap lying around the Bunker.” He thought about it for a second. “And they’re women! What about girly mags screamed homo to you?”
coming.
“Come on, Jack,” Cas told his son. “We should leave Dean be. He’s got a big meal to cook.”
“Yeah,” Dean spluttered. “And -- you don’t do any of the cooking in it.”
“Mom?” Sam asked.
“Okay,” Sam agreed. “That does sound weird. But that doesn’t mean mom’s a lesbian. I mean, you hear how crazy you sound, right Dean?”
“Sammy,” Dean bit back, sharply. “Don’t. Okay?”
“You’d have a lot more than a GED if you put half that focus and attention into something that isn’t porn,” Sam started.
“You?” Cas asked. “We.”
She looked at her adult sons and thought, so Dean’s eyes were still too serious and so Sam’s were still too wide and clouded. So what? Once upon a time, these could have been her kids.
Dean shot him a look. “Dude, it’s Cas,” like that meant something to Sam. It didn’t. It meant nothing to Sam. In fact, it meant worse than nothing because every other time Dean had said this Sam had assumed he meant "it’s Cas" in the same way Sam did. As in,
, according to basic logic, that it would happen to Sam and not to him, who’s kept his hair in a neat trim since high school.
Cas can only nod, one measly movement.
“Of course.”
Scraps of affection. Cas needs a moment to take this all in.
things on his mind. Cas keeps returning to the deal he made with Sam, both thrilled and disquieted that Sam assumed his intentions towards Dean were sexual. It’s the logical conclusion, isn’t it? There’s a tension forming, and Cas is practically dialing up the heat himself just to watch Dean roast. But he’s also being genuine; he almost always is. He doesn’t want Dean to think this is just an elaborate ploy to get him into bed—unless it is just an elaborate ploy to get him into bed, in which case Cas needs to sit down and have a serious talk with himself.
“Then why—”
“Hey, uh,” Dean starts, shifting his balance to avoid his right leg, “How’s it going?”
“I was too harsh back then,” Cas replies simply. “I think I burned your hair.”
The stubble under his chin is thick, like he gave up shaving in the past week. “I haven’t forgotten,” Cas says softly.
*    *    *
in the first place. I didn’t realize you were gonna commit to this. But if it was a thing, I’m damn sure it was about helping you feel better, not me.”
. Everyone is looking at him now. Kevin. Sam. Dean. He’s been careless; he got too used to saying whatever thought popped into his head, hidden under the guise of making Dean squirm.
Dean clears his throat. “You can be interested in something, academically, and not—and not want to,” his voice pitches down, turns sheepish, “make out with it, you know.”
He left not long after Dean stormed off, though it took a few bug-eyed looks from Sam and nervous, stifled laughs from Kevin for him to realize that sitting in the kitchen was the bigger humiliation.
Dean just drums his fingers on the table and rocks back in his chair a few times, an agitated habit Cas has come to know well. “Well, that’s just—you’re doing it wrong, by the way. Unless you’re trying to say you don’t like my cooking?”
because he’s tired and he ends up making Sam and Dean laugh.
But Cas thinks he understands what Dean is saying anyways. The game, the compliments, the so-called “experiment”—it was all wrong. “You’re right. I’ve treated you unfairly. I used your vulnerability for my own personal benefit. I’m sorry, Dean.” He hopes it’s enough.
“That’s cheating,” Dean gasps.
To his credit, Dean seems to be listening. It’s their first night back in the bunker, and instead of dumping him in a room and tossing him some extra sheets like Cas expected, Dean has decided to sit and listen. Cas chalks it up to lingering guilt over telling him to leave, which is fair—Cas would feel guilty, too, if the roles were reversed, though he can’t say whether he would be as gracious of a listener afterwards. It's always a toss-up which of them is more stubborn.
“Dean, it’s not—“
“Yeah, well,” Dean’s blush is back, a little darker this time; Cas thinks this is his favorite one yet. “I appreciate you.”
“No, it’s—just, it’s fine, Jack.” He scrubs his hands across his face in frustration, pushing both palms against his eyes to counteract what’s bound to be a killer headache. He’s not trying to blame anyone, he’s really, really not, and it’s just lice for God’s sake, but
*    *    *
,” he interrupts, throwing his hands up in frustration and turning around. Thankfully, Cas steps back for once, moving out of his space; there are only so many things he can deal with at a time, and an angel standing close enough to breathe down Dean’s neck is not one of them.
Dean seems to come alive under him, tightening their embrace and running his hands in slow strokes up and down Cas’s back. “Don’t want to. Everything’s crap without you,” he mutters, leaning his face into the touch. His eyes flutter and fall shut again—Cas takes this as an opportunity to let a wide, cocky smile spread over his face.
Of friggin’ course this is happening. And on a good hair day, too.
The best defense is offense, humans like to say, but right now he just feels exposed.
They look into a haunting that week. Cas isn’t in top form—he’s still not used to being human, he’s used to his strength being effortless, so he overcompensates, he swings too hard and loses his balance—but Sam is going to burn the remains any time soon and they haven’t had any serious injuries yet.
“This body... feels like it’s more my own than it’s ever been, but less, at the same time,” he admits. “I have no control over it anymore. It wants what it wants, and what it doesn’t want, what it needs—it needs a lot. But it doesn’t always want what it needs? I can't explain it well. I don’t know what I can do for it.”
Dean just stares. For a second, Cas thinks it’s possible that he’s about to get punched, but Dean’s anger deflates and, miraculously, he flops down on the bed next to Cas.
. One and the same. He can no longer talk about his body as an object that he possesses, that he has ownership of, whether earned or unearned.
Dean rolls his eyes. Typical; they want the problem fixed, but they don’t like the solution. “Look,” he says, turning back towards the mirror to plug in his clippers, “I’ll do myself first. If you have some magic powers way to get rid of yours, alright with me. Otherwise, this is our best bet.”
“Almost done,” Cas murmurs, voice low and gravely. His fingers start a wide sweep from back to front that has Dean melting into the seat. “Thank you for being patient.”
It hits him, very suddenly, that he was dead. He had known that as an objective fact, of course, but, well, he hadn’t really considered the actual consequences of it, the aftereffects, so to say, and he finds himself arriving at an obvious conclusion.
Cas shakes his head. “No, this had nothing to do with science.”
“I’m alive, Dean. It’s me.”
“Yeah, well, I ain’t buying the next carton.”
“No, I—” Cas falters. He should fight, he knows that’s what Dean wants, but he hasn’t had much fight in him lately. All that human weariness. Funny; he thought being in the bunker with Sam and Dean was just starting to cure that.
“That’s―great, yeah, good to hear it. So, uh―no, yeah, you’re good, you said you were good.” Dean glances around the room, but if he’s looking for something, he doesn’t seem to find it. “Just thought I’d check in. You know. Knock, knock.”
"I didn't think of it like that."
“You are. You’re friggin’ kidding me.” Dean looks incredulous. “I don’t need to stroke your ego? You’ve spent all week knocking me over the head with what a stand-up guy I am and then you turn around and beat yourself up—and I can’t even give you one lousy compliment?”
,” he whispers, nuzzling his nose against Dean’s stubble and wrapping his arms tighter around his back. “It was terrible how well you kissed me. This feeling of joy in my chest will likely give me indigestion. I can’t believe I waited years for this moment and was completely let down.” He drags his nose down and plants a few kisses on his neck. “I hate it when you’re perfect.”
Sam isn’t far behind. “Is Cas there with—oh. Uh. Jack, why don’t you go grab a shower and give them a second?”
“I think I’m getting a haircut,” Jack says into the phone.
?” Sam asks incredulously.
,” he says, speaking slowly and holding eye contact so Dean knows the words are true, “is good. I like the eggs, and the way you make them.”
He tries again, bluntly: “I have lice. It sucks.”
Dean is staring off at the wall now, lost in his own head, so Cas looks back down at the table where his hands are resting. Hands that, even a few years ago, he wouldn’t have thought to call his own. But they are his now, and—no, that’s not right, he thinks, they’re
Ten minutes later, the front door to the bunker is bursting open, which tells Dean everything he needs to know about his friend’s driving skills. He’s pretty sure it’s impossible to cover that distance in ten unless Cas took a shortcut through someone’s living room.
edit: okay, i ate a piece of fruit, and on second thought i actually like this chapter. self love <3
It was lousy, Cas thinks, but instead he says, “I don’t need it.”
Jack’s face falls, just a fraction. “Oh… I didn’t realize. They don’t bother me at all. I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean doesn’t speak for a moment. And then: “Dude, are you going Pavlov on my eggs?”
And he did take pride in his work. Perhaps the only feeling that he’s really getting accustomed to as a human is pride—which, funnily enough, is different from being “proud” or “prideful.” Cas is learning. He’s been proud before, in the all-consuming way that only few people can understand; he knows the consequences of it and has counted the casualties. But the pride he felt as a sales associate was different. Or at least, he hopes it was.
“Oh, the—you’re a piece of work,” he says, shaking his head. “Jesus, Cas. I mean, look—it wasn’t supposed to be a
Until his eyes shoot open. “I’m sorry, who’s not
Cas blinks again. “My data points?” he says slowly, making sure the words were right.
He’s interrupted from his thoughts by a sharp kick to his chair, and looks up to see Sam, already retreating to his corner again, giving him a deadly glare.
“And did it work?”
“What? Why would I say it if I think it’s not true?” Cas asks softly, eyes widening. He knows Dean has a complicated relationship with fatherhood, and he knows his comment earlier was out of line, but he doesn't understand why—
Dean freezes, turning to see his hand poised in mid-air on a path straight to his head—which, now that he thinks about it, itches like an absolute bitch. “Aw crap,” he says.
He used to feel a sense of loyalty and obligation towards this vessel, a desire to do better that flared up each time he saw the mirrored reflection of Jimmy Novak’s face. But now, he realizes with a stab of clarity, those feelings are unnecessary. There’s nothing to be loyal to anymore; there’s just him.
,” he repeats, forcing the emphasis as much as he can.
The words hang and echo in the empty space, and it makes the fact that they’re alone together even more obvious.
He’s being vague again. Stilted. Sometimes Cas doesn’t mind when Dean is hard to understand, because it feels like a challenge to try and read through the lines; curiosity is what first drew him to Dean, after all, so many years ago. But today he’s in no mood to take blind guesses, wading through the human pop culture references and debating the nuances of “buddy” versus “pal.” Is it his turn to speak? Is he supposed to say, Who’s there?
—what kind of kid likes having a parasite? What the hell is Dean supposed to do with that?
“Can run two evil science labs, or whatever creepy thing you said. Yeah, yeah, I remember, Doc Brown.”
Cas does not respond; he isn’t sure how.
Of course the fatherhood comment would be too far; of course it’s too important for Cas to be lumping it in with little flatteries about his eye color and music taste and egg-frying technique. But Cas hadn’t thought of it like that—that there are some things that are true no matter what, like eggs and the need to wash shampoo out of your hair, and there are some things, emotional truths, that are only true with the right person. And Cas was not the right person to imagine parenthood with Dean. In fact, he’s not the right person for any of things he’s been doing with Dean this week.
“Yes, it is.”
the subject of your little psych experiment?”
,” Cas says, stepping forward, because this is important. He still doesn’t know where exactly their miscommunication lies, or when it started, but he knows there’s a disconnect here, and it feels important that Dean hears this. “Since I came back to the bunker, I haven’t lied to you.”
Dean feels like hyperventilating. “Yup, yes. Go for it, pal.”
“Why not? It’s true, I’m not going to—”
“What the hell?” Dean moans.
He gives up on the affirmations after only a few minutes and falls asleep around 4AM.
“I see.” He did not sound like he saw.
“I thought you didn’t like shoes in the house,” Jack echoed.
“So it was a reverse Soviet Wall or a backwards Mr Gorbechav --”
And Jack looked so miserable, so guilty, so much like Cas, that Dean opened his mouth and found words there, before he could think about it or talk himself out of it. “No.” He cleared his voice. “Jack,” he said. “You’re fine. It’s different.”
“But --”
a lesbian.
“Technically,” Castiel said, “We did not “come out”. You “came in”.”
“You gonna eat that?” Dean asked his brother. “Cause Cas went and got it specifically for you --”
“Okay, fine, so I’m particular. So I care about making it a little nice around here.”
It was Sam’s turn to choke. “Mom!”
Privately, Dean thought his particular problems with time travel would lie closer to the family issues problem then grammar -- no one, bar Sam during a particularly sarcastic period in his early teens, had ever used the words broad-minded or well adjusted to describe Dean’s family -- but Douglas Adams disagreed. No, he insisted: Grammar. How to describe something that was about to have happened to you in the past before you jump forward -- say, five years -- to avoid it. Proper tense usage becomes even more complicated depending on where, or, rather, from when, you were speaking: your present time, a further future time, or a further past time. Or if you were the first born nebulously non-heterosexual son of a complicated but almost definitely at least mildly homophobic semi-present father you had spent the five years avoiding while living and raising a child with a man shaped entity. Being that person would certainly complicate things, though maybe not grammatically.
“So it’s done?” Dean interrupted.
“Sam,” Dean interrupted. “What the fuck are you talking about?”
But Jack’s voice was the clearest. “PFLAG?” he asked.
“Boy --”
“No, dude, I don’t,” Dean objected and then the doorbell rang. “Uh,” Dean turned to Sam. “Expecting company?”
“Well --” Cas started.
Cas entered a few minutes later, harried expression set deep into his face. “Sorry,” he said. “Jack likes to push the button.”
Sam relaxed then. It was fine. Mary should relax too. She tried. Her shoulders still hurt. And when she looked at Sam, she still couldn’t see the face of her baby in the man in front of her.
Dean stared at her. Mary stared at her son. She would not take a step back from her son. Good mother’s weren’t frightened by their children because good people weren’t frightened by their creations.
“Not like that,” Mary corrected hastily. “He was before your father. Long before. My first boyfriend, actually.”
“I know, kid.” Dean smiled down at him.
Sam ignored him. “So, considering you’re already awake and looking for something to do, do you think you’d like to join me on my run?”
“Mhm,” Cas agreed, not really listening and pushing Dean forward against the stove. Cas threaded his hands through Dean’s, gently extracting the spatula.
“I didn’t even know you …” Sam paused. “Swung that way?”
“Yeah?” Dean asked, and this time he looked Sam in the eye. Oh, score, Sam thought to himself. It totally was one of those important things you were supposed to say. God, he was crushing this.
“No, sir,” Dean said and forced a smile. The room fell awkwardly silent after that, as the five of them stood around the dining room table avoiding eye contact while Jack finished setting the table.
“What?” Sam’s voice was loud enough that Mary flinched back. “Dean, what are you talking about?”
, are you gonna tell dad?” Sam asked.
Cas didn’t look at Dean.
“Water,” Jack said. “I don’t think it was a supernatural creature. It’s just hard to remember to flush the toilet sometimes and I think it got too full?”
“If she’s going, I’m going.”
He ignored Sam muttering, “you’re an asshole,” under his breath.
Sam stayed down where he landed, unable to process the images currently playing on a loop in his head. It might be worse than remembering hell. He wasn’t sure. He considered bashing his head against the wall. He considered getting the holy water out and -- nope, nope, nope. Fuck that. Sam was absolutely not under any circumstances going back into that room --
“I told him that he shouldn’t call people slurs. That it’s wrong and hurtful.” Sam spoke proudly and clearly, before Dean could even try to say something, as if he was worried Dean wouldn’t be. As if he didn’t want Dean to need to be. As if he owed Dean -- something. Some sort of protection. As if it wasn’t Dean’s job to protect Sam from John, and to hide the worst of John from Sam.
Cas hums in response, considering the words. Dean can picture the accompanying head tilt with clarity. “I never noticed.”
“Well, yeah—”
It takes a second for his brain to catch up with him, and then he realizes his mistake.
“Cas says to wait,” he says in a loud whisper. “He can fix it.”
Sam looks first to Jack, then back to him, twin looks of confusion dawning on their faces. Dean is about to protest and fire up the clippers again when he’s stuck with a sudden memory—
“Gonna be done any time soon?” he asks, praying his voice stays steady.
Dean’s brain was already dazed and, frankly, barely holding on, but it freezes up completely at the L-word. “Oh,” he says. “Right. You’re saying I’m like a son?”
Cas is the last to look, and the moment they lock eyes, Dean drops the frozen bag on the counter and walks out.
“Not exactly. Lice are attracted to clean skin, and my grace keeps this body spotless. They latch onto me quickly.”
Cas shuts himself up immediately, wiggling a hand out from under Dean’s back so he can draw it across his lips in a zip-up motion and then throw away the “key,” exaggerating each movement to make the metaphor clear.
on bit of a time crunch, in case you hadn't—”
That is, until two minutes later.
“You have a parasite,” Cas says somberly. “Allow me.”
It’s silent for a second after his departure, but soon he hears the sounds of more footsteps hurrying down the hall. “Dean, what the—wait up!” Sam calls. “Are we really doing this now?”
he mouths.
“No way.” Dean is sticking his arm into the back of the freezer now, and after a second, he triumphantly pulls out a bag of frozen bread. “And miss out on this Brady brunch? Sit your feathery—uh, not-so-feathery ass down, bud. I’ll get you some toast and OJ.”
The great experiment continues, and after a few days, the affirmations start to feel incessant, instinctive—something not unlike prayer. It’s hardest at night, when the words swirl around in his head until they turn into vicious mockery. It’s easiest in the morning, when he forgets dumb rules like
“This is good,” he whispers to his hands, testing the words against the cold ache in his chest. “This is good.”
“You called it an
This is very different from the conversation he was expecting. He thought he would be chewed out for taking advantage of Dean’s discomfort with emotional vulnerability just to—just to shower him with the words of a lover and watch him blush. He thought he would be kicked out once again for the cardinal sin of imagining domesticity with a man who had been forced to give it up over and over again.
Oh, Cas thinks. Oh, Dean is
But before he can score another kiss, Dean pulls back. “Dammit, Cas! This was supposed to be about
Dean can tell that he’s trying very hard to be patient with Jack, softening his voice and speaking directly like he does sometimes with victims or the bereaved—but it’s betrayed by the fact that he hasn’t stopped backing away from the kid.
“I love you,” Dean whispers into the top of his head, nose pressed into Cas’s hair.
Cas, stubborn bastard, doesn’t answer, just moves until his face is visible in the mirror, looking right over Dean’s shoulder. “You were staring at yourself and muttering obscenities. Have you done something wrong?”
He watches as Jack gets another kiss dropped on his forehead, Cas muttering something soft that Dean strains to hear but still can’t make out. And then, all of Cas’s attention is on him.
Dean’s face seems to fall even further, as if he didn’t want Cas to actually admit it. “Yeah. You did. Look, I can take a little ribbing. Just don’t—” He takes a breath. “What you said in the kitchen. Don’t say that crap when you know it’s not true.”
Cas seems unphased by his sudden nerves. “You could say that. Sit down,” he says, gesturing to a nearby chair. “Jack, would you mind checking on Sam? Tell him that lice usually don’t transfer without direct hair-to-hair contact.”
Dean is looking somewhere over Cas’s shoulder now, so Cas pinches his side to get his attention. “That wasn’t what I was going to say.”
“It’s done,” Cas says, stepping back. For a second, Dean wants to lean back in the chair to chase his touch—which is exactly why he shouldn’t have done this, should have just ignored Jack and cut off his hair when he had the chance. Friggin’
“Everything I said to you this week. You think I made it up.” Dean’s rant; it makes slightly more sense now. “For the sake of... studying you.”
But his intentions feel decent, maybe half-decent, he thinks, and despite Dean’s ruined dignity, this is good. Dean gets his affirmations, Cas gets an outlet, and the mood in the bunker has been lighter than ever. This is good, so long as he doesn’t push it too far.
Cas averts his eyes from where Dean is bent over, rummaging through the crisper, to reply. “Good morning, Sam. Dean. Kevin. And that’s alright. I can wait to eat until our normal time,” he offers.
He doesn’t know how much time passes, but soon a door opens in the bunker and what sounds like a stampede comes rushing toward their room.
The memory, whatever it is, doesn’t feel very pleasant, but these eggs are surprisingly good and they bring a sudden thought to mind. He looks across the table at Dean, willing his attention; Dean looks up seconds after.
Dean’s head thunks down onto the table, before he realizes that it probably shouldn’t be touching any surfaces in the bunker. He picks it back up again to see Jack staring at him, eyebrows knitted together in confusion.
Before he can react, Cas is stepping into his space again, placing a hand on his head. There’s a flash of light, a mild burning sensation on his scalp, then suddenly, the itching is gone.
“No, Cas,
Castiel’s affirmations are easy that night: he rattles off a few things he’s grateful for, making sure to compliment himself on a successful, if accidental, “Pavlov-ing,” and goes on to list all of the things he’s looking forward to when he wakes up.
Tiger. The words should feel soothing, but Cas isn’t an idiot; he sees the clear discomfort in Dean’s face. He lets his gaze drop and focuses on his hands in his lap. “You don’t have to say that.”
Cas is back.
But that was an hour ago, and this is now: Dean keeps an arm’s length between them on the couch, his eyes trained on Cas like the hunter he is. It’s almost unsettling, Cas thinks—and that’s coming from someone who once won a staring contest with a rabbit—as if Dean is too tense to move, too susipcious to turn his head and let Cas out of his sight for even a second.
the door thudding behind him. He sees Jack hovering not far away, who flashes a quick smile before pushing past him into the room the moment he realizes that it’s his turn to see the good doctor.
Jack doesn’t seem to notice. He just glances up in a vain attempt to see his own hair and uses his fingers to comb through the fringe there, flattening it against his forehead. “Oh, I didn’t plan for this. I just woke up with them a few days ago and thought it was sort of fun.”
“Can you?” Cas muses, stroking his thumb across Dean’s hairline and around his ear, his eyes never leaving the path. “I’ve been struggling with that distinction.”
But Cas doesn’t approach just yet, instead turning his attention back to Jack with a preliminary scan over his head. “Have you decided what you’ll do?”
, dude.”
It’s a life-changing moment, and Cas, to his own humiliation, just laughs. He knew it was coming, but still, the words, hearing them aloud—it moves through Cas like a rush of energy, a rush of bubbling relief, he can’t help it—but then Dean is laughing back, muttering “jackass” and “stop it” under his breath even as a pleased blush starts spreading across his cheeks. Cas has to smush his face into Dean’s shirt to hide his smile—and really, this is embarrassing, he can usually control himself much better.
Dean’s hands immediately fly up to his hair, combing through the short, singed ends. “Did you… did you just smite the lice?”
There’s a confused expression on his face, but Cas holds up his hand before Dean can ask. “
“Dean, I told you, I—"
“Morning, Cas,” Sam says.
Here, at least, the food is better. There’s scrambled eggs on the stove when he enters the kitchen, which is surprising; yesterday, Dean cooked in the early morning and put Cas’s portion in the refrigerator.
"What?"
Still half-asleep, Cas nods. “You’re very thoughtful,” he says, almost dreamily. “You’ll make a good father one day.”
Dean’s eyes are wide and searching, but Cas doesn’t get a chance to read the emotion in them before his face is being grabbed and pulled into another searing kiss. And this time, he’s ready, meeting him with equal force. Too soon, he realizes that he has to stop and breathe; he wants to curse his human lungs, but at the very least, pulling back allows him to look at Dean’s rosy cheeks in all their glory.
Dean kisses him.
“You talked so much before, I could barely get a word in,” Dean continues, and they both smile even though they know the joke is just a warm-up to something bigger.
, he thinks as he lies awake, unable to sleep for the second night in a row.
Cas matches his gaze, and suddenly he feels the full force of his own anger. He’s tired. Dean is hurt. He can’t remember the tune hummed by a man showing him kindness, when everyone else wanted nothing to do with him.
Dean shakes his head quickly, and his chin almost clocks Cas right in the forehead. “No, just—crap, Cas, I can—I can do this, just let me—“
It’s awkward at first: Dean tenses up and refuses to budge as soon as they touch, so Cas has to push him down in the back cushions a bit to get a good angle to swing his legs over. From there’s a clumsy sideways slide, Dean begrudgingly swinging his legs onto the couch at the last minute so they can lie flat across.
“Son of a bitch,” he mutters, combing through his hair and leaning forward to get a good look in the mirror, hoping to catch one of the little buggers. “Son of a
That’s not totally true, if he's being honest. There are always plenty of reasons for Dean to be mad at himself: for attracting the lice, for choosing this particular motel over another, for not being able to suck it up and work through the case. Not that he didn’t try, of course. He and Sam got through about three questions before Dean was scratching his head so furiously that the 90-year-old witness told him to get off of her couch—arguably one of his most embarrassing moments. But what is this, confession? He doesn’t have to admit any of that.
Regardless, Cas begins to look forward to their breakfast time together, even if it’s already lunch for Dean, and he has to assume Dean does too; each morning, there’s food waiting on the stove, and each morning Cas makes sure to give his “compliments to the chef,” as they say. Dean also stops trying to correct him on proper Pavlovian technique after the first day, which Cas is grateful for. Maybe he’s using this exercise as an excuse to pass along more praise to Dean. Who could blame him?
“Are you upset with yourself?” a voice behind him asks.
“So, uh, let’s get ‘er done,” he says, stepping up to Cas and awkwardly tilting his head forward to make an easier target. “Just a quick wham-bam to the head and then, you know, lice-be-gone, right?”
“You don’t—” Dean lets out a shaky gasp, drops his shoulders to a hunch as if the wind got knocked out of him. He looks smaller than Cas has ever seen him before. “Cas, you can’t say that,” he whispers.
Cas feels drunk off of the proximity of their faces. “The blush is back,” he says.
oof this was a grind to write and i definitely did not proofread so... expect a rewrite in like five hours to five days LMAO
“What the
“That’s a start,” Cas says, accepting the work ahead of him—then he’s struck by a sudden thought. “Would it help if I lie on top of you?”
“A little,” he says, then quickly adds, “but it’s not a bad thing. You’re, uh, you’re affectionate with him, yeah? You have a certain voice you use, and—you kind of slipped into it just now.”
“Oops."
, Cas’s attention, all on him, given with no expectations in return. Cas spoke to him with the same rumbling voice that he uses on Jack, someone he feels love and affection for. He spoke to Dean like that. He said he didn’t want to be harsh; he wanted to be gentle, to protect Dean and shield him from pain.
“You don’t have to—”
He watches as a crack forms in Dean’s expression, small at first, just a quick blink of the eye and an intake of breath—then everything starts spilling out.
“Then what—”
He hears Jack talking, too, in quieter tones that he can’t quite make out, but he refuses to slow down. By the time they catch up, he’s already rummaging around the bathroom cabinet.
“Yeah, okay, jackass,” Dean huffs, but he doesn’t pull away, so Cas goes in for the kill.
“Yeah, yeah, I got it, buddy.” Dean says, scrubbing at the redness in his cheeks—and that’s odd, Cas thinks, honing in on the movement. “Still not using it right. The whole point is that you talk up stuff that you actually hate, or that you don’t want to hate, so you can convince yourself to like it. This sounds like you secretly hate my cooking.”
Dean looks winded, staring back with wide eyes and flaring nostrils as he breathes in heavy bursts through his nose, like his final, straggling reserve of energy was just spent up; Cas takes this as a yes, and begins to talk.
He doesn’t say any of that, but rather: “I understand. I wasn’t thinking.”
And returned it is.
. “... to say thanks,” he finishes.
“A little help, Sam?” Dean asks.
“Thank you for breakfast, Dean,” Cas says.
Even through the haze of relaxation, Dean still feels an embarrassed jolt shoot through his body from the praise. He clears his throat, keeping his eyes closed, and tries to deflect. “Yup, that’s me, patience of a saint. I’m not Jack, you know. You don’t have to baby me.”
Cas is discussing grace removal with Dean, and it feels like trying to explain the endless, frightening expanse of the ocean to a dung beetle. He can maybe get the gist across, but what he can’t explain is the overwhelming feeling that you’re about to be swallowed whole. He just doesn’t have the language.
anymore?”
lucky he’s cute.
But no, there’s no logic in Dean’s world. He’s the one currently scratching his head like crazy while Sam gets to stroll down to the store in search of a fine-toothed comb. A lice infestation in the middle of the apocalypse; life just keeps throwing punches.
*    *    *
“Not the point. Point is, I’m not really good at this. Saying nice things. Giving, or, uh. Receiving.” He looks up and Cas catches his eye—he doesn’t look away. “But don’t let my crap infect you, okay? And stop harping on yourself for mistakes I’ve seen 50-year-old humans make.”
“They’re not giving me kisses, that’s for sure,” Dean mutters.
“Oh, you weren’t thinking?” Dean scoffs. “Just like you haven’t been thinking all week? This whole thing is just a great, big accident, huh, Cas?”
“Uh-huh,” Dean echoes. He’s already lining up the clippers, ready to take off a small chunk from the side of his head when—
he thinks when he goes back for one last dip in the grape jelly and Sam asks, “Didn’t you just brush your teeth?”
“What you said, before you, you know. What you said in the bunker.”
follow up scene is cas biting dean for the jack becomes god arc. follow up to the follow up scene is more biting but fun this time
But Dean just sighs, setting his jaw and folding his arms. “Right. Well. It was fun while it lasted, but I hope you got all your data points.”
“Then why?” Dean’s voice has dropped almost to a whisper, and Cas realizes he must have even moved closer at some point, because he can count the freckles on Dean’s face. “Why have you been so nice to me?”
“Dude.” Dean just stares at him, slightly frightened, slightly awed. “Where were you all my life?”
“Jackass,” Dean mutters, but he’s laughing—and trembling slightly, so Cas moves his hands from Dean’s face to the small of his back, steadying them both and drawing them together—
“You would blush whenever I complimented you,” he explains quickly. “It was starting to go away, probably because you got used to it, but now it’s back.”
He’s sitting in the bunker library with Sam and Jack, combing through the extensive books left behind by the Men of Letters. Research is always a slog, but today feels even worse—he can barely sit still, like there’s some itch under his skin making him want to jump up and take a shower. He can’t place it, exactly, but it’s driving him nuts.
“Have I been… babying Jack?” Cas asks.
Jack lights up with a smile as Cas’s attention immediately falls on him, hands cradling his face and lips planting a light kiss on his forehead. “I’m fine! We got Dean to put back the clippers and then Sam ran away—oh, but Dean’s head still hurts.”
“Something the matter?” He looks up from a book on different cultural understandings of the soul to see Sam shooting him a weird glance. “You’ve been scratching at your head a lot.”
“Dean,” he calls as passes the other man’s room, but Dean is already waiting for him when he rounds the corner.
“I was going to say,” Cas continues, “that being in your presence is one of the easiest and most natural parts of my existence. Human or angel. Whatever problems I have with adapting to this life, you, Dean Winchester, are the least of them. So yes, I can focus on two things at once—showing my appreciation for you took no extra effort out of my day.”
Dean stops. He turns around to look at Jack, who’s holding his hand over the bottom of his phone and looking at Dean with wide eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas lifts himself up a fraction and Dean huffs below him, tightening his hold reflexively. “Oh, we’re being rude,” Cas says, even as he lets his head drop back onto Dean’s shoulder like a magnet drawn in place. “You two don’t have to leave.”
Leaving Dean alone in the hall, every thought he’s had over the past ten minutes catching up to him in quick succession.
It played out very simply in his mind: He would confess then and there, opening the windows and drawing the blinds on all his musty, locked-up secrets, finally embracing the supreme joy of a mind and heart at peace with one another; he would watch Dean’s face as he did so, ready to accept with grace whatever response was thrown his way; he would let himself get swallowed whole; he would die with love on his lips and love in his sight.
“We have time,” Dean whispers. His eyes are screwed tightly shut. “Okay, I can do this. Cas?”
, Sam shoots back, jerking his head towards Jack—and crap, the kid looks miserable, staring forlornly at the book laid out in front of him like he just admitted to murder.
“I’m fine,” Cas says.
Dean doesn’t seem to process any of this. He just stares at Cas in a look of dawning horror. “Oh. Oh, crap.”
Cas removes his hand, but doesn’t step back.
“That’s nice,” he murmurs absently, lost in the embrace of Dean Winchester. They’re breathing in line with each other now, a steady in-and-out that continues until Cas hears both sets of footsteps disappear deeper into the bunker. For a moment, all is quiet and warm and good.
“You don’t know that,” Dean interrupts, angrier this time. “You can’t say you’re not leaving when you—you always leave, it’s what you do! And maybe you don’t want to or don’t mean to, whatever, but that just makes it worse. Every time! Every time, Cas! Something always comes up, you’re busy, you’re dead,” he chokes on the word, fists balling at his sides, “you’re missing, you’re whatever. Even if you don’t really leave, you get taken away.”
“I doubt Sam’s feelings are that simple,” Cas offers, but Dean quiets him with a bump to the shoulders.
“For yourself,” Dean offers, and Cas nods. He’s been staring down at his hands, but Dean doesn’t seem to mind. He rolls a wrist and watches as his fingers swing out in an arc.
Dean hasn’t said much at all in the past hour, in fact. Given what they talked about when they last saw each other, it would make Cas nervous if he wasn’t already so confused about being alive.
Dean asked him if his body feels different from when he was just, quote, “riding it” as an angel. He doesn’t know where to begin. He feels as though he’s being pulled in a million which ways; it’s like every part of him, from his eyes to his ears to his pinky toes, has something to say. Often, that something is just a pain receptor going,
“You’re doing the Pavlov thing. With my eggs!”
“And where would lice even come from?” Sam continues, finishing his bun before rubbing his hands together like he wants to go wash them. “We haven’t stopped in a motel in weeks, and it’s not like we’re around any—” He stops all of the sudden, making eye contact with Dean, and the two of them turn in unison to look at Jack.
He manages to wake up early for once, muttering self-worth under his breath like prayer, and when he enters the kitchen, Dean, Sam, and Kevin are all there, talking about their stunted progress in reversing Metatron’s spell. The conversation dies the moment Dean catches sight of him. Apparently, Cas gets “mopey” when Metatron’s name comes up.
Dean raises an eyebrow at him, and Cas nods. Of course it worked; he imagines Dean was very persistent.
“Yes,” Cas says—the crazy bastard.
“Right.” Dean sighs. He gives one swift, resolute slap to the tops of his thighs, then stands up; he’s fixing this. “Jack, look at me.”
“Are you alright?” he asks. “Did anyone lose hair?”
The next day is a bad day. Dean has a few swollen toes, so he rests instead of making breakfast or helping with dishes, and Sam works with Kevin all morning, and Cas can’t heal Dean because he can’t do much of anything these days.
“I can have two experiments,” Cas says mildly.
He throws in other compliments, too. Like when Dean picks up wooden coffee stirrers for Cas or lets Sam drive the Impala. On Cas’s fourth day in the bunker, Dean takes Kevin out shopping in what Cas assumes is a “Sorry you’re stuck here with us, would you like a new pair of shoes?” gesture. When they get back after dark, Cas looks him dead in the eye and says, “You’re a good role model.”
Cas can’t say he fully understands it, Dean’s apprehension. He thinks of all the little compliments Nora would give him at the Gas-N-Sip—“God, you’re a life-saver” or “Such a hard worker” or even a simple “Thanks for restocking”—and how his chest swelled at each one. He felt no discomfort then, only pride.
Dean anticipates him, of course he does: “I mean, I know you can say—whatever,” his voice is weak, frantic, “but you can’t
It all happens very fast: Dean is pushed out of the room before he can say
Cas is sitting in his makeshift room a few hours later, staring into space and trying to remember a song that one of the men in the encampment had hummed, when he hears hobbling footsteps down the hall. Seconds later, Dean appears in his doorframe.
Cas had never really planned his death—his final death, that is—but once the path opened up to him, he knew exactly where it would end.
, his mind supplies helpfully, and it all makes sense. Dean tried to help him through a volatile time in his life and Cas turned around and used it as a flimsy excuse for flirting.
“I haven’t done anything,” he huffs. If he sounds pissy, so be it. Zacariah’s been hounding him all week, the devil’s running loose in God knows where, and there’s a spook in the next town over that he had to put on hold because he has lice, of all things. Friggin’ lice—like a kindergartener!
There’s a moment’s pause, then Sam makes a sound like he’s dying, high-pitched and miserable. He takes another step back as Dean sinks into his chair, feeling utterly defeated; he has to resist the urge to scratch again. “Not, uh, not exactly,” he says.
“No, it’s not.”
Silence settles back in once their giggles fade away, but it’s gentle this time, nothing like the oppressive emptiness that so often fills the bunker. Neither of them move from their position. They should probably kiss at some point, Cas thinks, but right now he wants nothing more than to doze off in Dean’s arms. He might even be able to do it; the couch is so warm and comfortable that even Michael himself could be lulled to sleep.
in the meantime i'm posting this for @myaimistrue's content creator celebration!! woohoo!!
He wants to shout, at Dean, at himself.
, and he surges forward, tangling his fingers in Dean’s hair and kissing him until they both pull away, breathless.
He wonders, briefly, if Dean takes pride in his scrambled eggs, but he doesn’t ask.
that.”
“Oh,” Cas says. “You think I’ve been lying this whole time.”
Cas starts combing through the longer hair in the front, which brings his hands dangerously close to Dean’s forehead and all the tension stored there. “I thought it’d be easier if I waited to smite until
Cas swallows down his irritation and reminds himself that he is in the wrong here. He tries waiting instead.
And there are
Cas turns a pitying gaze towards him. It’s already too much, way too much, Dean thinks; there’s no way he’s surviving this.
He finds a more natural system eventually, only using his affirmations when he feels that telltale prick of shame or resignation at his human state. He doesn’t quite know what his goal is; he’s not convinced he can completely rewrite the narrative, change his first instinct from deprecation to acceptance when he makes a mistake. But he tries anyway.
Still slightly breathless, he opens his mouth to say—
Cas has no follow-up; he knows there’s no way to explain his almost prophetic belief that Dean will be a father one day, that he’ll be loving and good, without digging himself a bigger hole. Once that’s clear, the heads turn to Dean instead.
“That was very good, Dean. You moved so quickly,” he pants as the ghost shrieks out of existence, and Dean drops the crowbar on his foot.
in his head.
“I’m gonna stop you right there,” Dean interrupts, his voice rough, “because if the next words out of your mouth are
Dean gulps; he has a bad feeling about this. “Jack? You don’t happen to have like, little bugs in your hair, do you?”
Cas rests his forehead against Dean’s and lets his eyes flutter close, but they snap open again when he feels Dean freeze in his arms.
Jack sighs. “I’ll get rid of them, but... can you do it? I don’t want to hurt the lice.”
*    *    *
And he does. “Sam used to hate eating his veggies, you know,” Dean says after a moment, leaning back in his chair as he thinks. “Kid would throw a fit over a single piece of lettuce—and pick through his food, too, so I couldn’t sneak anything in. Now look at him, Mr. Whole Foods. You know what I used to do?”
“What? No, I haven’t,” he counters, instinctively defensive. Sam raises his eyebrows, but doesn’t say anything in response, returning to his own impressive stack of books.
“Yeah. Your little project? The Stanford Dean Experiment?” Dean raises his eyebrows. “Let’s see what Mr. Tortured Soul over here does when a few scraps of affection are thrown his way? Ring a few human decency bells and see if he starts salivating? Ain’t that friggin’ fascinating.”
“No punches held back, huh, Cas? Don’t apologize—” he says quickly, and Cas shuts his mouth. “You’re not— you’re not wrong. It’s, uh. Yeah. It’s hard for me sometimes.”
But that’s just the Dean Winchester luck, he thinks; his fault for expecting anything different. Sure, something like this was bound to happen eventually, what with the crappy motel rooms and moth-eaten towels, but he
“Yes, you could,” Cas gently corrects, and then he follows the instinct twitching through his body and lifts his hand up to Dean’s face, brushing his fingers across his cheek.
“Cas, you’re back!” Jack’s voice rings out.
Cas continues talking, still out of Dean’s line of sight. “You know, I don’t speak to Jack like that because he’s a child.”
At one point during the week, he realizes that Sam is starting to look annoyed, but they talk it over and make a deal—moreso, Sam proposes a deal. He won’t comment on his brother’s skittish behavior or their mutual, quote, “fanaticism,” so long as Cas and Dean stay focused during hunts and don’t, quote, “
And then he starts walking straight to the bathroom.
“Why do I feel like
“Dean,” Cas calls, hurrying down the bunker halls.
It still catches him off guard—Cas is gentle, this time. It’s nothing like he remembers.
“Crap.”
He wakes late the next morning, stumbling out of bed after noon. The bunker still looks like a bunker, the same in the day as it is in the night, and Cas is afraid that he could sleep through the whole week here if no one stopped him. That was the beauty of Gas-N-Sip, he thinks: The big windows let in sunlight at dawn and woke him up early, and fear of being caught living in a store forced him not to go back to sleep.
“You’re -- you’re the one who
Unfortunately, that was when John Winchester found his words again. “Boys,” he began. “You’ve been talking your heads off long enough --”
“Dude!” Dean said, from the fridge.
“I got it,” Mary said. “Why don’t you boys head into the living room?”
“Right. And what was this movie rental store place called again?”
“No,” Dean said shortly.
She flipped to the back. There didn’t appear to be any single page pictures of just men but maybe those were in the other magazines. Maybe homosexuals liked the images of men and women?
“Well, Dean kept talking about it --”
“Dean!” Mary couldn’t help the alarm in her voice but she could keep her body from leaping off the bed and flinging the pornographic magazine away from her. Barely.
“I didn’t understand,” Jack said. “I laughed. We all --”
After a few minutes of this, Jack turned to Sam and said, in a low voice, “I don’t understand. Dean is a gay person? Even though he doesn’t like them? Is this what gay people are like all of the time?”
John and Mary, unlike Jack, Cas and Sam, were not early. They were right on time and standing an awkward, forced distance apart and not looking at each other. So, right off the bat, Dean knew things were off to a great start.
“I kind of liked it,” Jack said.
Oh. Mary was starting to see where she’d messed up. She should explain to Dean that she wasn’t dating a woman but that she was concerned that her boyfriend was one of those homosexuals. She still wasn’t sure if she was allowed to say homosexual, though. Maybe queers was okay?
Mary panicked. This potential case was looking more and more like her best opportunity to figure out if Dean was a homosexual. “No, I want to go. I need to get out.”
Of course, this didn’t work. “Dean, are you gonna let this man push you around like that? You gonna let this goddamn fruit talk to you this way? I mean, liking dick is one thing, but do you gotta be such a bitch?”
“Dean, we get out constantly,” Sam said. “We’ve spent most of our lives out. Hell, why don’t you and Cas hang around the Bunker while Mom and I take this one --”
“Right,” Mary agreed. “I guess they could marry other women. If they wanted to. But it sounds like they don’t want to,” she continued, banally, kind of wishing she could stop. She kept her eyes on the road and not on Dean, who she was hyper-aware of in the periphery. She could hear his snort better than she could see it.
“Mom,” Sam started. “You just went --”
Jack frowned. “Do I need a story about gay experiences?” he asked.
“Oh my God,” Sam said. Cas sent him a dirty glare. “No one cares that you’re “particular” --” Mary wondered if that was a new word for homosexual these days “-- we just wish you’d admit it. Instead of standing over our shoulders breathing heavily every time we try and help.”
“Sam. It’s a movie about a lesbian!”
There was a long pause from Sam. “I’ll let her tell you,” Sam said. “But, listen. Dean. I don’t want you to read into it.”
“I don’t know,” Mary said. “What you’re saying makes a lot of sense to me.”
“I think Eileen is going to respect my choices, Dean.”
“No, uh, really.” Dean moved towards them, placatingly. “It doesn’t matter.”
Okay, maybe Douglas Adams had been right all along. Maybe grammar really was the biggest problem with time travel.
“I don’t think you’re supposed to say things like that,” Sam said, frowning. “It’s --” But he pressed his lips shut because he definitely didn’t want to call Dean homophobic for a third time.
Dean’s ears went red. “I’m good,” he said.
“See?” Jack said. “I don’t get it! Sam gets to be mean to Dean about sleeping with Cas but everytime I say cock --”
“I burnt it,” Mary said after a minute. “Sorry.”
“I just thought it might be nice to get out,” Dean responded in a shockingly sulky voice.
Cas didn’t respond. And honestly, Dean couldn’t find it in himself to mind.
“I don’t. The only thing that I care about is offending Jesse and Cesar.”
Somewhere behind her, Mary thought she could hear the popcorn really getting going. She missed whatever Dean said next.
“Okay,” Sam said, through his nose. “This is fine.”
Sam gave Dean the Judgement Face of Judgement. It was also known as the face Sam made when Dean came back to the motel room at two or three in the morning or whenever Dean ate more than three cheeseburgers in one go which, whatever Sam, a man doesn’t always know when his next opportunity to chow down would be. “Dean,” Sam said in a tone that made Dean want to punch his face. “I want to support you. But it’s not fair to Cas.”
Cas slumped. Sam’s face shuttered. John’s sneer, already ugly, turned triumphant. “I died for Dean,” he said. “What the hell do you even do?”
“I want to keep my options open,” Jack told him seriously while Cas shook his head fondly in the background.
“Of course,” he said. Then he turned back to Sam. “I told Dean that you were unaware of our relationship but he didn’t believe me. I suppose this means I have ‘won’.” He was still looking at Dean but the expression on his face was starting to make Sam regret consuming food this morning.
“Dean --”
Mary looked blankly at her son. She pointed to the DVD in his hand, a blue sheet of paper wrapped in plastic over a case. “Obviously.” She did not tell her son that no, they did not rent movies anywhere closer than an eighty-seven minute drive away and no, they didn’t keep normal store hours.
“Yeah, Sammy. This is actually healthier than whatever you’re doing.”
Dean’s face felt like it was on fire. He did his level best to ignore this fact. The spatula nearly slipped out his hand. “Heh.” He adjusted his grip -- firmly -- on the spatula. “Right. Um. You know.”
“Nerd,” Dean smirked but he still wasn’t looking at Sam.
“Jesus, a guy does one genital herpes commercial and all of the sudden --”
“I --”
“You love me, right?”
“Thank you, Mary,” Jack told her. “It is unpleasant helping Dean with the dishes.”
“A homosexual is just a more clinical term for someone who is gay,” Cas explained.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas said, solemnly. Jack followed after Cas, holding tightly to Cas’ hand.
“I want to,” Jack told him. “Dean’s been showing me how.”
“But --”
“I can’t believe you’re bonding over this,” he grumbled. “This is supposed to be my moment.”
in the backseat of Baby.
“We’re just trying to help.”
“I’d say it’s about neutral,” Sam said.
mags. Women," he emphasized. "I’m starting to think mom might be a --”
Dean whirled around. “I don’t care,” he said. “It doesn’t bother me.”
Of course, Sam thought. Sometimes, Jack was an all powerful celestial being. And sometimes, Jack was two. Usually he was both but sometimes he was just two. Of
biggest problem with time travel was how angry John would be and why. There was no doubt in Dean’s mind that John would be angry. He couldn’t imagine John not angry. The question rested with whether John would be mad at him or showing up or mad at him for staying away. Dean was sure that the sooner he could figure out why John was going to be angry, the sooner he could get to work figuring out how to redirect John’s anger.
“I don’t want Sammy hearing any of this shit,” Dean said at the same time, still bright red. Cas, of course, deferred to Dean, completely ignoring Sam now. Sam resisted the urge to impale himself on the counter.
“I get yelled at,” Jack finished.
Sam looked blankly down at the three DVDs in horror. “Where did you --”
“What?” Sam squawked. “No! Why is she talking to you about --”
Cas squinted. “There’s only one kitchen.”
Everyone turned to look at her.
John wanted better -- expected better. Expected the world to bend to him if he wanted hard enough or worked hard enough. Mary wanted -- but Mary didn’t expect. And Mary came pre-bent by the world. Mary wasn’t running towards her marriage; she was running away from her home. She was running away from a life shrouded in blood and violence, into a life of marriage and family and secrets she clutched so tight she couldn’t breath sometimes. John just happened to be the first life raft she’d been able to clamber aboard.
Homophobic? Mary wondered but didn't ask.
“Tell dad what?” Dean grunted.
"Dean, no!" Sam snapped. "I didn't know!"
Mary checked the clock. Nine hours and fifty-six minutes to go. Perfect.
“Okay,” Mary affirmed.
“I -- excuse me?” John looked around wildly. “You’re just going to let
Sam started laughing too. “Oh, man,” he said. “When you tried to make us the -- what did you call it, Dean?”
“I’m not having some kind of cocksucker for a son,” John said, deadly still, looking directly at Dean.
“Gay people?” Jack asked.
Dean nodded in agreement and took them off the highway, down to an empty stretch of road, letting Baby fly the way she was meant to while Mary sat, feeling the music wash against her as they crunched gas down to Kansas. Felt like she was moving and sitting still at the same time.
“Funny?” Dean asked. “This is frigging hilarious.”
“No, uh,” he said. “They can get married to each other. That’s legal now.”
Back in her room, Mary took a seat on the bed and opened up the magazine. Well. Front and center. That was a naked woman. She flipped a few more pages. It was hard to tell if this was the kind of magazines for homosexuals. Mostly it was women, but there were a couple of scenes with men in them.
talk to me that way?” The question, angry and impatient, seemed to demand an answer from Dean, even as John himself refused to make eye contact.
Sam did not say jerk. Sam shook his head and said, “You know, Castiel is my best friend too, okay? And he deserves a lot better than this. I want you to think about that.”
“You obviously do, Dean, and that’s fine --”
Sam clearly doesn’t know how to respond.
“Really?” Jack beamed at Dean. “Did you hear that, Cas?”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Is it --” but he stopped and didn’t finish his sentence. “Cas mentioned --” another verbal dead end.
Sam’s forehead and eyebrows twisted into his ‘understanding and empathizing’ expression. “AIDS was a very serious disorder,” he said. “But it’s treatable. People with AIDS can live long, fulfilling lives --”
“Okay,” Jack told Sam brightly. “I’m glad to hear that, cocksuckers. I’m going to go back to my room and Google more ways to be homophobic --”
It was the exact opposite reaction for them, she knew. She knew because Sam had told her, explicitly, how much it means to him to have her here and even Dean has stumbled through words wrenched from somewhere deep inside himself to tell her how much they had missed her. She heard the stories John told them about her and watched the legend of herself spinning and twisting out of her control.
-- of his room, bright red and rumpled but otherwise no different than the last time Sam had seen him, the toilet was unclogged and Jack was outside doing target practice with the birds. This was a game Jack had invented with Dean where the two of them would lob pieces of bread in the middle of a group of pigeons and bet on which one would get it first. Jack liked to use his angel powers. Dean liked to call him a cheater and punch his shoulder. This, Sam supposed, was the least repressed way Dean could think of to instigate male bonding. It really wasn’t great, Sam thought, but Jack seemed to like it. Then again, Jack didn’t know any better. Sometimes, Sam felt bad for Jack.
