Molly had taken to brainwashing in all likelihood to endure Sherlock, but John would stay strong. He would not fight openly, but he would remain alert, looking for an opening. This thought comforted him, and he thought of Mary and his sister, making a silent promise to return to them the first chance he got. Then John’s spine straightened, and he lifted his chin so that Sherlock would not look into him, crack him open like eggshells. He would not be cowed by those eyes, both brilliant and cold. From within the curtains, Sherlock’s body twitched, twisted. An amused, drawling voice spoke out, ushering John forward.
The young man cautioned, placing it a few inches away from the Dragon-man's hands as he crept closer. It was the most intimate proximity he had experienced with the creature before that hadn't ended in violence. Already John's neck was beginning to prickle with sweat. The creature kept up its stream of growls, but they softened as he licked his lips thirstily and eyed the cube before him. His scales glittered cautious vermilion as he tentatively reached for the gift, eyeing the soldier warily before him and scanning him for the slightest indication of attack. Again the Human stayed slack and relaxed, balancing on the balls of his feet as he sat back on his haunches. A mimic of Sherlock's own form. When the Dragon snatched the ice-cube this time, he found himself rewarded with a word he had never heard used in connotation with himself before.
When John realised the boy was about to start singing again, he immediately clapped his hands over his ears. However what came out of the boy's lips were no silver-sweet words of comfort, nor were they invitations to draw nearer. Rather, what floated on the air was a question, and though it was simple, John understood immediately.
He remembered the creature even years later, mostly because if it weren't for the leather collar circling her neck, he wouldn't have thought her to be anything other than Human at all.
him enough to do this, that there was no one else on the planet that Sherlock could currently imagining enjoying this with. He cried out as John finally took him into his mouth, only a little.
All he knew was that when he reached out as if to touch him, the detective physically flinched away, crossing his arms over his chest.
Sherlock looked up from his chest which he had been in the middle of binding, still holding his breath even as he scowled, the end of a roll of ace bandages curled in one hand. He had accidentally burned a hole through his only binder last night, an experiment with hydrochloric acid gone horribly wrong through careless distraction. As it was he hadn't been forced to bind like this in months, and the result was glaringly poor compared to the professional compression vest he has acquired in his first week of school.
Sherlock gave him an out. His voice was hard, and yet strangely brittle. His shoulders hunched, making him look smaller than he was. The thunder had stopped, turning instead to rain. It was cold on John’s face.
Which was why the detective was rather unprepared when John suddenly tugged on the silk-blue bathrobe he was wearing, playfully yanking it away so that Sherlock was exposed in their kitchen, naked as the day he was born. The detective let out a rather undignified yelp at the cold, and John’s laugh was bright and infectious, waving the blue bathrobe like a military flag. Sherlock stood for a moment, mouth open and cheeks flushed with youthful indignation. John thought to himself he had never seen a lovelier sight, the blush crawling prettily along the man’s collar-bones and chest.
Then again Mycroft supposed he wasn't really one to talk, considering he had just been trying to offer Sherlock Holmes highly top-secret information for his benefit. It was a delicate game he played right now, and he knew that. One false move and they could literally be out of the frying pan and into the fire. Not even Daniel was aware of just how
At first, Sherlock was rather unnerved by the large crowds of people filing in and out of the park, and his lip curled in distaste when the English Dragon timidly chirped a greeting from behind Mike's wider frame. Although he did not appear out of place from anyone else, his posture screamed resentment and mistrust, and his hands twitched in his pockets restlessly. His spine was a straight line of tension that refused to bend, and despite the mental comfort of John's thoughts, the Dragon couldn't help but feel as though his partner disliked this situation with equal fervour. John didn't bother to hide his glare when he locked eyes with Dodge, blue eyes burning with irritation even as his features softened to greet his friend. He shook Mike's hand and nodded to Molly, and finally, he turned to introduce to them his Dragon.
They rode in silence, the two Crates just small enough to fit in the large boot of the car and allowing the people who sat in the back seat access to the two Caged and quite frankly, irritable dragons. Mike whispered soothing words to his obviously stressed Dragon occasionally, her mouth spitting a blackish sort of smoke as she slowly tried to re-light the flame in her gut after being drowned at the Kennels. It would be a few hours still though before she would succeed.
Daniel's voice was small. Very much unlike his usual self. His eyes were rimmed with a haunted expression, and he licked his lips nervously as he swayed in place, seemingly exhausted. Yet Mycroft knew instantly it was not exhaustion that caused the pinched, regretful expression in the man's features. Rather, it was the fact that when his hands lifted to run themselves through his own hair, they stained their own blonde locks dark, dark red.
This wasn’t the reaction Irene evidently wanted. She growled, the noise subsonic and inhuman. One manicured hand grabbed Hawborne by the collar, lifting him into the air. With brutal efficiency, she forced him onto his feet, shaking him like a dog.
, mock-pouting before setting his instrument to the side. The detective jutted his chin towards it, commenting without any particular heat or inflection.
of hot coals, a small cry coming from his parted lips. Before Sherlock could completely comprehend the abrupt change, his
But what if the one they were designed to protect, was the only one that could stop the hurtling missile that Sherlock's absence would create from their life? Sneak's lips turned down in determination. His blue eyes blazed as his grip on the table tightened. His voice was filled with certainty.
“We made a deal with him.” Blue rasped, one hand tugging absently on the nape of John’s sandy blonde hair. She rocked quietly with the motion of it, knees hugged to her chest, curled up tightly as if expecting impact. “He promised he’d protect us, and he did. He did.”
He didn't often lash out, but now his hands balled into angry fists, and he suddenly wanted nothing more than to strike out at something, to make someone bleed. It was a quick flash of unadulterated fury, and it stole his breath away with its potency.
Any credibility he had would be put into question if he just switched to she, people were so cruel, so blind sometimes...Most of the Yard hated Sherlock Holmes to begin with. If it became common knowledge that Sherlock was once Shyla… was
After what felt like an eternity, John breathed. The folds of his jumpers half-covered his hand, which went almost casually to brush over one of Sherlock's. The man's voice was afraid, but determined.
Yet being in the room itself was a salve to the Dragon, who had been feeling John’s absence like a missing appendage. Upon entering he’d nearly felt crippled by the weight of relief, and wondered at once when he had developed such appalling sentimentality.
diversity, a 'melting pot' of ethnicity. People of every race, age and gender crowded the already very busy market, creating a noise so loud that part of John was certain people back home in London might hear it. Despite the bustling activity however, he found that people quickly made way for him when they caught sight of his uniform, glancing at him with as much respect as suspicion as they carried on their way, gathering produce to put on display tables. Much of the market was a bargaining sort of place, and John soon discovered that every coin was bartered for almost ruthlessly, every last shred of fabric or food sold for its worth, nothing more and nothing less. The shopkeepers were as good at bartering as the buyers, and they knew the exact value of their product and could predict how hard to push a customer based on the person before them. It was a complicated, rather fascinating game to watch, and as John wandered through the stalls (waiting for Murray to finish his business with a fruit-seller) he found himself smiling and even chuckling at the liveliness of the people around him. He especially enjoyed watching the small children, clinging to their parents’ robes or skirts, ducking between legs and cheekily begging the shopkeepers out of their goods with big eyes and grabby hands. Despiteof their rather ragged appearances they all seemed joyful and carefree, and John found himself somewhat relieved. To see a bright side to the depressing scenery redeemed an ache that had been truthfully nagging at him for some time now. And although he knew little to no Pashto or Dari, he cheerfully tried to learn, listening to the voices around him.
Shyla looked at themselves in their reflection, taking in the short cropped curls and pale grey eyes that seemed nearly colourless in the bathroom light. The sharp ridge of their cheekbones were prominent, more so than they would have been if she hadn’t been suffering lately under the weight of her own private moments of self-doubt. Though the results could have been much worse, truthfully, if John hadn’t been involved. The thought sent a lingering pang of annoyance through the detective, her lips turning downwards in a small frown. Her reflection stared back at her, for once angles and lines that did not seem too feminine. The detective turned and drew her robe closer about herself, searching instinctively for her companion.
Wasn't sure when he curled into himself, clutching the woollen duvet to his cheek and refusing to allow himself to scream or cry. The irregular pounding of his heart thudded dully in his ears, a constant drum that slowed only when he forced every muscle within his body to relax.
“John, I want you to look around you. What do you see? No sand… no desert. Look at your shoulder, John. It hurts but it doesn’t look wounded, does it?”
John hadn't been able to stop the shift only a block after he'd left the flat, Claude's rampant emotions overtaking even Daniel's iron control, the weight of her sadness hanging heavily in their chests. Alone and frightened, the little girl had been uncertain
Curling into his cot, John vaguely realised that he hadn't heard or seen Bill or Rin since before the battle. Murray's bed lay empty, tucked neatly into a corner like it hadn't been touched since the morning. Briefly, John spared a note of worry, wondering if the pair had been hurt.
“They do when their brother’s are facing eating disorders and admit to having been sexually abused in the past.” John growls, refusing to parse words. He held his ground like a bulldog, stubborn in his determination to gain answers. To his surprise, his retort causes the elder Holmes to flinch if only so slightly, his mask for a moment molding into something less neutral, more pained before sliding into casual indifference. He glanced at his hands, still turning the handle of his brolly without any real destination in mind. Mycroft’s voice was low, even. Admitting defeat even while shifting the blame away from himself.
The voice fades after a while, but the cooling touch stays. It is the only thing that keeps Sherlock sane, the feverish black liquid drowning him, pulling him under. He wants to fight, but he is becoming weaker. He can't keep attacking it.
“Hello.” Sarah murmured, looking at the man. It was very clearly him, although it was like holding up a pale shade against a newer, vivid painting. John Watson was miles healthier looking than the stranger she had bedded from the bar, the haunted and exhausted circles of his eyes faded, bringing out their nice shade. He also seemed to have put on a healthier amount of weight, and the lack of nicotine stains around his nails indicated he’d likely stopped smoking.
“What would you have me do then, Watson? We cannot bring him back to camp, not even for questioning. Within the day, our Dragons would be useless. To leave the creature out here is equally foolish, you know that. Not to mention that even if we were to care for the creature, after the hatching of his egg he would be brought into questioning, his child possibly sold into slavery or used amongst our own ranks.” His gaze was earnest, and John bit his lip, considering the problem. While it was true that the Dragon couldn’t set foot on the compound, there was nothing that stated he could not be cared for off of it, perhaps in one of the old storage sheds no longer being used after the recent attacks from the Draski. John proposed as much, but Benson was already shaking his head, negating his suggestion.
He chose not to think on how as he touched himself a familiar face came to mind, nor on how he could so very easily see himself on his knees, sinking to the ground and pressing himself close to sun-tanned legs, stocky thighs. Not out of obligation or force, but out of something far, far more dangerous.
But then John's smile faded, and his eyes grew serious as he continued with only a small pause, doctor mode kicking in.
” he murmured emphatically, to which the Soldier smirked. Sherlock took some time to observe now, noting the way the man before him sat in a deceptively defensive sort of position. If the personality was telling the truth (which Sherlock was fairly certain he was) then he was sure that Daniel was far stronger than he was openly letting on. The curled position he was in was an act, an attempt to make himself look small and fragile when he really wasn't. After all, John himself had proven himself to be stronger than he appeared. The time he had shot the cabbie had been proof of that. Though now Sherlock wondered if it had really been John at all who had done fired that fatal shot. The thought that it might not have been sent a small note of discord running through his stomach, so he pushed it firmly away.
It took the better part of John’s courage however, to will himself back up the wooden stairs. Candles had long since guttered to the core of their wicks, and the ex-army doctor’s figure cast long shadows upon the wooden floorboards, creating creatures that flickered out of the corner of the eye threateningly.
“Sorry ‘bout that. Jim’s… a handful. I’m supposed to look after the little tyrant, but…” He shrugged, a gesture of defeat.
And Sherlock felt blind panic constrict his chest, because if he stood down, it would mean admitting weakness. Yet if he attacked, not only would he likely be injured if not die, John's trust in him would break.
Play was mingled with learning, Mycroft’s afternoons were dedicated in particular to history and writing. His instructor, an elderly Dragon named Eilonwy, fed his interest in life outside the mountain.
John’s grandmother – bless her soul – had believed in so many things that simply weren’t real. Goblins, Fae folk and merfolk and bloody
“I don’t trust you, John Watson,” was what came out of the man’s mouth. John blinked, he hardly knew this man? He didn’t entirely trust him either. “But the fact of the matter is, Sherlock does. I’m reaching a wall with him, and I fear that we’re running out of time to get past it.”
Even now, he berated himself over the fact that a part of his mind was still focused on the calculus question that had sat before him, solving equations while his sister experienced an existential shift in her very brain that would lead to everything falling apart.
Instead, the detective had chosen to throw himself down the avenue of possible solutions, already feeling a twisting in his gut as he demanded of his brother if there was any evidence of being able to reverse the effects of the
As it was, Sherlock woke on his birthday rather disappointed at first. This would be because as he stretched out his long arms he found only the lonely coolness of an empty bed, John nowhere to be found. This was not entirely out of the norm, for it was hard to break army habits and John rarely slept past seven AM. However, Sherlock felt a small pang of petulance, even though as far as he knew, John had no intention of commemorating the date.
Or maybe it was the glitter he saw in the depths of his eyes when he carelessly deduced him. His life.
“Only on the surface, dear. The truth of the matter is that Humans often have a point to where they will no longer allow themselves to be pushed. If you were to meet a Human for once, get to know one, you'd likely discover your apt at pushing individuals towards that very limit.”
Then Mike and John found themselves the speculation of many glowing, slitted eyes gleaming brighter than the lamps themselves in the dark.
John had heard of the chaos of it, he had expected it even. The soldiers milling about him, holding their positions against the whirling shadows plunging down like bombs from the sky, the destructive hail of their bullets and screams were things he had known he would be expected to experience. But he hadn't known how a thousand Dragons could
I've been bogged down with the unpleasant business of uni applications, but managed to find some time for a chapter :) It's an informational one too~~ gotta love those.
It has always been this way, the constant chattering in the soldier’s head. He supposes that if he believed in a God, he might think that he was chosen for the job because he was the only one that could handle such a racket. To him it was home, and long silences drove him to madness. He was the restlessness in John, the part that itched to be back in a war zone. The half that desired to fix other’s wounds amongst bombs and shrapnel, and become filthy with sand and gunpowder.
who you are. If you’re quite finished gaping at us like we’re the next victim of the murder case, could you please show us the body?”
John was no genius, he couldn’t always read people properly, but he could read his flatmate without even the slightest bit of effort. And Sherlock had been honest.
For a moment, Sherlock found himself gaping, looking at his brother as if he had lost his mind. However the Incubus quickly found his words, and they came with a blazing glare, his wings flaring as he stood to his full height and crowded towards his brother. Sherlock’s long fingers were tipped with claws as he grabbed at his brother’s arms, shoving him violently even as he shouted.
had done to so many innocent lives, to his friends. Now he looked to Mycroft, a mask of indifference affecting his features, even as his insides whorled.
“Watson promise, love. You know my family, we keep our vows.” And John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's temple, hands trying to stroke away the man's past by working their way soothingly down the ridges of his spine.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, but John cut him off with a firm wave of his hand. His friend's eyes shone with earnest pleading.
His steps had been heavy with sleep as he stomped his feet into his boots, trying to tie the laces by himself (because Dad said men knew how to take care of themselves) and Harry yawning by his ear as she pulled on her woollen mittens. Bright red, John had remembered, just like the colour of a fire-truck. She had gotten them just for that reason, so she wouldn't lose them.
She didn't have long to wait to find out the answer. Molly's ears pricked as she heard two sets of footsteps walking determinedly up the stairs. Baring her teeth, she hunched into a small, defensive position away from the door, wine-red wings flared in warning.
John felt the grain of the wood pressed against his forehead, how it dug sharply into his eyebrow, almost drowning out the terrible howling upstairs. He leaned against the edge of the stair well, drawing deep, gasping breaths into his lungs.
It was without thinking that John leaned upwards, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s lips. Still, the detective’s reaction implied that it was far more than John liked to pretend to make it out to be. The fact was, John had yet to instigate anything other than chaste touch and gentle kisses (and no where near the mouth) and though the detective had never complained, to do such a thing now without prompting caught Sherlock a bit like a rabbit between crosshairs.
Mycroft’s hands were instead folded over the handle of the bamboo umbrella he habitually carried, twirling it absently in their wait. Chips of frost shed from it, cooling the ground before vanishing. A show of power, one that the younger of the two ignored as he sipped his wine and wondered again what was taking John so long.  Molly was supposed to have him brought as soon as possible, but evidently that was a flexible command. The Water-Spirit repressed the spark of annoyance that shot through him, his brother’s presence making him tetchy. Mycroft however seemed to notice, his slow smirk mocking even as he casually sipped his tea, honey lemon and starlight whorling in one of Sherlock’s prized pieces of china.
Yet the thing that caught John’s eye the most- the inescapable proof of his transformation, was the unbalanced Gem resting in place of his scar on his shoulder. Bright gold, it blazed like a medal of valour, fused into his very skin and fully formed.
Then she let John click his heels and salute to her before she called him a “git” and gestured for them with an air of resignation to move on out.
The tea was hot, overly sweetened. Greg had forgotten that Sherlock took his like a ten year-old’s, more sugar and milk than tea. Still he drank it politely, turning the cup in his hands as haltingly Sherlock explained his reason for secrecy, his voice hushed and low under the dim sound of the shower pipes running above them. It took time, nearly a half hour actually, and John was just stepping out of the shower-clothed but clean and wet when Sherlock set down his own cup, folding his hands together in his lap. His voice was measured and calm, but his expression was deliberately blank.
John, his leg lifting almost instinctively to curl the creature’s hips closer to his own, was past the point of caring. His hands, once trapped above him were released, only to curl themselves into the sleeves of the creature’s strange clothes. The soldier, losing the last of his reservations found himself unable to resist, the pull of the creature’s own allure and his own personal desperation to feel
“Where am I? What's going on? Don't hurt me....” And then, increasing in volume as those eyes took in Sherlock, and John drew in a ragged breath and curled closer in on himself, sobs coming in soft,
“Friends, comrades, brothers and sisters. Every year we gather for this blessed rain, make our offerings to the Water-Spirit. Pray for more throughout the year. Tonight, we show him our thanks. Our gratitude.” The priest turned then, kneeling in front of the wooden statue even as slowly, a line of apprentices to the temple came to his side bearing the incense and sacrificial water. They handed the glittering bowl of liquid into Raz's hands, stepping aside even as the priest lifted his gift to the Water-Spirit, intoning his praise so that the entire village could hear.
As John turned to go and fetch Molly from her outside sentry duty so that he might shower and go to bed, the army doctor couldn’t help but pause. He wondered to himself if Xavi had a mate, had once had brothers and sisters. If he could remember his own mother. Yet that was not in the end what he stopped to ask.
And with a mighty wrenching of his own thoughts, John stumbled backwards, knocking the rocking chair back and nearly tripping over it. His own loud breathing muffled the creature's infuriated roar. John turned, backing out of the room first at a shuffle than a full run, clapping hands over his ears even as Sherlock shrieked in protest.
“Thought you were finished back there, Captain! Saw the demon as it came on you, couldn’t make it there fast enough though before you took care of it.”
The look Not-John gave him was mildly affronted. His spine straightened as he glared up at the detective, blue eyes sparking mischievously.
. Though he was doing the same to this personality, he couldn't help but want to shiver slightly. Sherlock resisted it.
Sherlock’s hand brushed across the screen, stopping the recording at its end for the fifth time in a row. Each time, the camera cut at the image of a younger John, eyes frighteningly blank as blue eyes stared into the distance. Franklin’s voice echoed in Sherlock’s thoughts despite the silence of the room, a nonstop chant of terrible triumph that made the detective’s stomach twist sourly into knots.
“Give him an hour. In this heat, he'll not be running for too much longer.” Her tone remained faintly amused, as she gazed out upon the barren desert. Even after several months away, she felt her shoulders lower automatically, back straightening as she assumed her customary role of being in command.
Sherlock could hear Xavi’s love in his voice. The Dragon felt like it was an emotion inappropriate to wield in public, not with such ease and grace as his friend did. He was about to hesitantly agree, when Mycroft’s voice spoke from behind him. Sherlock resisted the urge to bristle like a startled cat.
“By your logic, it’s not my world either. Yet most would say with my army record, I’ve contributed to its progression.”
So sorry this is a bit late!! ^_^ Things in this story are starting to pick up and here I am writing essays continuously *cries*
“Go on, my dear. Make some friends. I need to get Sherlock his violin for tonight’s performance.” Heartlessly fed to the wolves, Mycroft had no choice but to take a breath. He forced himself to calm the panicking thoughts in his mind. He hoped his cloak and his circlet weren’t crooked. The group was chatting amongst themselves, but soon eyes found his and they turned as one towards him. Though Mycroft tried to keep a formal exterior, a part of his brain insisted that they could smell his fear. They were all taller than him, and though there were only a few years between them, he felt suddenly small and childlike. He stood like an idiot, his voice leaving him stranded.
It was then the detective thought it was safe enough to move forward, and he was lucky he did. In the next moment John was falling forward, trembling in the aftermath of what could only be shock. Sherlock’s strong arms caught the soldier before he could fall face-first, holding John’s head against his chest so that the man could smell the soap Sherlock used, feel the texture of the worn sleepshirt he wore.
Mrs. Hudson greeted Sherlock with a warm smile even as she carried a hamper full of laundry towards her flat, humming under her breath along with the spiralling notes that filled the building cheerily and intricately. She caught the detective's arm on his way upstairs, her silver-grey hair shimmering slightly under the dim lights as she smiled.
“We promised ourselves that we'd never let anyone take advantage of us ever again, Siggy. If you make this deal, you keep it, luv. Nothing personal, just... business.”
so often. Tired of pretending to be a normal, functioning adult when most of the time he felt like a thousand glass shards kept under compression, waiting to blow.
With no answer to give, the personality kept silent. Yet Sherlock thought he caught a flicker of something within Sneak's expression, something vaguely approving. His words were calm.
from before the War began, as such songs weren't sung very often by Humans any more. Anything that glorified Dragons
inside the cage. Though whatever was in there made no noise, John could see into one of the spaces between the bars of the Cell. He caught a flash of a dark blue tail twitching, quickly shifting from muted grey to deepest black until it hid itself back into shadow.
of acrobats and dancers, spinning and tumbling and falling in place in a seemingly endless and graceful event.
Oddly enough, they reflected the possessive glint in Sherlock's eyes even as the Selkie's command washed over him like the capsizing of a wave.
“Father wishes for me to marry a lord. I told him I wanted to learn, go to school.” That was admittedly, part of her reluctance to get married. The other part was the delicate hand slipping into her own. Kate hummed, the sound noncommittal and good-natured.
Sherlock snapped, his voice reinforced by a clap of thunder. If John hadn’t seen it been done before, it would have been intimidating. Now, it only made his anger spike.
“And if this... condition the good doctor has proves to be too much to handle for you... if it truly risks your life... then I will be forced to bring my hand into it.” Sherlock glared as his brother stated dispassionately with a flick of his fingers against the handle of his brolly.
Mrs. Hudson, having wanted to check in on her “kind soldier” was instead left to face a sight that would make most men cower in sheer terror.
He grew up in school hearing about how to best defend oneself if a Dragon were to attack, curled up to news reports showing the War casualties and how many Humans lay dead in the streets. Especially in the really heavily populated places like New York, where there were actual Dragon Gangs that roamed the streets. Being at War with an entire other subspecies of creatures had painted John's childhood with colourful doses of fear and grudging respect for an animal that could look like a four foot tall woman and yet rip you in half with their bare hands. It was like a tiger, or perhaps a vicious dog. Treat it with respect and distance and he was sure it would do the same to you. That's what the Army did in the end with the prisoners of War they gathered. Turned them into intelligent, weapon-like pets.
“We need to get your Alter's communicating not only with you and me, but with each other. To do that, I'm going to need
, even without makeup. The thought sent the same warm fluttery feeling through the detective from before.
Daniel's voice is a low growl. He steps forward, stopping at the last instant as Mycroft raises a brow in silent challenge. His fists clench and unclench, teeth gritting against one another.
“You need me in one piece because there will soon be many innocent civilians calling your hotline in the future, begging to be saved from the bombs that they will have strapped to their bodies. I have my second in command on standby, so whether or not I leave this office alive today is really just a bonus on my part. Either way, Sherlock will have his puzzle. The question is, will anyone be there to help him solve it, if I blow my head in?”
In answer, a Scottish brogue spoke from the doorway to Mycroft's office. Daniel's voice was uncharacteristically hoarse as he stepped inside, limp unusually present as he stumbled into the room. Mycroft noticed with some surprise and a curling sort of knowing that the plain jumper the man wore was stained on the edges. The crimson shade stood out starkly, rust against pale fabric.
Sherlock felt her gaze trying to take him apart, see underneath his mask of neutrality. John's blue eyes were strangely pleading as he looked the detective over, trying to guess his ulterior motives.
all the manpower we can get and in layman’s terms- that’s you and all the other Dragons on spare. Direct order from both Captain Benson and Wilkes, non-negotiable. M’sorry mate.”
“John....I will not let them take over. Not completely. Can you trust me? Do you think you can trust your memories being laid out like this?”
Yet a name whispered in their minds, and instinctively they reached out for it, their eyes opening wide.
in front of him, leaving only the infection spreading across his skin. The patches of scales slowly faded away, and the long sinuous tail that had been curling protectively about the Dragon's figure vanished. He could now lean over the tub without any difficulty whatsoever, and he lightly stroked the place on Sherlock's scalp where one of his darkly curling horns had been peeking out but a moment before. All he felt was slightly ridged scalp, the same as his own.
John blinked, looking at Sherlock if he had gone mad. The detective rolled his eyes impatiently, spinning to grip John's arms tightly and propel him back towards the chair.
It was strange, how a package delivered to him only a night before could suddenly become a sort of Bible to keep checking up on. Even as John broke out two packets of his best bacon into the frying pan, he checked the pages for
“Is it worth getting illegal testosterone to have people look at me like I see myself? Is it worth it, binding my breasts down- sometimes with tape or bandages just so that I’m not assaulted on the streets? You’re asking me if it’s worth it, trying to mend my body so that I do not feel quite so compelled to
He had eventually introduced himself as Charles. Charles Stamford. The story went that she smiled at him, and in that moment her watery blue eyes had lit up her features to a warming glow, and the young man had realized with a start that he was completely smitten.
John cut off the overly dramatic monologue by flicking Sherlock lightly on his snout, causing the Dragon to snort and sneeze in a rather undignified manner. The soldier giggled slightly, only sobering up when
The detective noted how John's shoulder's slumped in silent relief, and Claude without hesitation leaned forward so that Sherlock found his flatmate pressed against his chest. John's breath was warm and humid with unshed tears, and gripping the collar of Sherlock's coat tightly, his voice was thick and croaky with the unthinking honesty of a child.
“Sherlock-” The D.I tried to interrupt, stop the tide of information, but Sherlock appeared to be having none of it. He flicked his coat collar up against the chill air, leading the way for John with a silent jerk of his chin.
The words running along in John's head fast-descended into babbling, the noise swelling into a mixture of pleas for forgiveness and desperation before the soldier cut it off soundly with
He could never be sure, and he could trust no one with these private fears. Yet he feels like in that moment, that if anyone could tell him, it would be this man. It's what causes him to listen. To pay attention for a change to what is being said to him. To realize that Sherlock is perhaps brilliant, if not mad. He learns that even though he doesn't know Sherlock, he might as well be his closest friend.
And John, finally stumbling into the moonlight with a yelp as his legs all but gave way underneath him, found himself crawling uncontrollably towards his nightmare.
If Sherlock knew, he'd surely turn them in. The thought made her sick. Conrad would never be able to handle jail. Her big sister would cry and cry and hurt them more... She'd never be allowed to play
So he had escaped, if only to look for the boy, see if he still wandered the beaches. His brother's words still lingered in his mind, cautionary and firm.
polite and calm. Out loud, Dodge was conversing with John lightly, ignoring the silent signals that Sherlock's scales were giving. Threatening red, mottled blue and brown. Ugly, seething colours.
“We… we can stop. If you… if you need to. We can stop.” It sounded like such a thing might cause the detective to literally roll off the bed out of sexual frustration, but his stare made sure to John that the man was being honest. If he needed to stop, Sherlock would stop. John breathed deeply, overcome with a mixture of affection, lust and a kind of warmth that took him only a moment to identify.
he whistled low, the sound muted by the wind. “This is…This…” He trailed off, apparently unable to articulate much past swear words and amazement. Greg looked at Mycroft, his cheeks flushed in wonder. “You
Though John truly believed after that point that Sherlock would try his best, he still asked the Dragon to stay in his room until called. The Dragon had grumbled, but didn't put up much of a fight. With the click of the lock sliding home, John hastily made a pot of tea, setting it in the living room so that it could be accessed easily as a way to stall. Much of this would be bluffing, and so the young soldier made sure to keep as many options open as possible. When Dodge and Cerioth had arrived in what seemed at once both an eternity and an instant after, he ushered them inside and offered them something to drink. Both being painstakingly British and neither wanting to seem impolite, John and Dodge seated themselves across from one another, not saying much as they nursed their cups and stared at into the other's eyes unflinchingly. A silence stretched between them as Cerioth took the customary place of a Dragon, kneeling on the floor by Dodge's side. John itched to haul the small creature to his feet. Instead his fingers tightened impotently about the handle of his mug. Tentative of his welcome, he reached out with his mental Thrall to address the slave.
careful with this, and John respected honesty more than careful half-truths. So he didn't hesitate to show the man each of the tabs he had found most useful in his research. John read over his shoulder, a feeling of unease settling into his gut as he scanned over words such as
still lingering within his mind. Though politeness did not come easily to him, Bill seemed to appreciate Sherlock's effort. His freckled face scrunched into a grin, and from it Sherlock deduced within seconds several things.
Violet Holmes suffered a severe depression after the loss of her husband, something Mycroft would later come to understand and eventually, forgive. Yet it did not excuse in many ways the rigid way in which she treated Shyla, put-off by the girl’s rambunctious behaviour, irritated that the girl seemed less interested in her education and more interested in the history of piracy.
The detective felt as if he should respond, but he found himself silent, throat closed despite the roiling and conflicting feelings surging through him. He stood pinned to the wall, heart trembling in his chest, and he counted the seconds that stretched between them as he struggled to answer. A part of him, not a very small part wanted to pull John closer, ignore his question, smother it so it lay forgotten in ash even as he would kiss and lick every line and scar that covered the man's neck and shoulders. The other part wanted to shrink, whispered to him sinuously words that were not his own, yet made him want to cross his arms over his chest, duck his head so that his chin connected with his shoulder. Hide.
“M-Myc..” And the treacherous tears that the young girl hated so much started again to rise hotly to the back of her eyelids, and God she
When John started to sing, it was in part to stop those images, to reassure. He barely realised until he was halfway through the first verse that it was a song his mother used to sing to both he and his sister, and sometimes the little ones she had looked after while parents in the district were away. Its tune was hauntingly sweet.
pup seemed encouraged by John's answer, his hands splashing slightly in the water around him as he seemed unable to quite contain his excitement.
What faced him was a creature that was as impossible as it was lovely. The creature’s eyes were like twin black orbs, deep and reflective in their inquisitive charm. John peered at it with fascination and slight fear, seeing the humanoid top half but disbelieving of the aquatic traits that blended seamlessly with its lower half. Shimmering scales glowed muted shades of blue and green and silver, catching the eye and making John’s vision swim. From the curve of the creature’s breasts John guessed it was a she, though he admitted to himself that there was no real way of knowing in Sherlock’s realm just what was what. Her dark curls fanned out wiry about her head, lips pulled back into a smile that revealed teeth pointed and sharp. The sight should have been frightening, yet John found himself aware of the mischievous glint in her eyes. The word for the creature came to him then, stories of old echoing in his mind: Water Nymph.
crave danger. The true question, was did Sherlock crave it as well, or was his Gem designed to desire something else? John didn’t know, and truthfully, Gem culture was a mystery to most of humanity. Certainly, Sherlock offered no information as to what his purpose would be if living on his homeworld planet. The ex-army doctor somehow sensed that even if he asked, the answer that would pass the man’s lips would be a silver lie, left to hang in the air acknowledged but not addressed.
Irene’s lips parted, ruby-red lipstick making her terror and confusion all the more apparent to her companion.
“And you’re not paying me to stay away from Sherlock Holmes or provide you intel on him. End of story.”
He was so distracted he very nearly tripped on a shadow, curled up against the wall to his left. Greg barely resisted the urge to yelp as a spidery, thin hand shot out from a mass of dark blankets and rags, gripping his ankle in a vice. A voice, low and sonorous and distinctly male clipped out words that were fast-paced, manic and astounding.
As it turned out, the Dragon was only the Human equivalent of someone in their early twenties, and his name was Xavi. He was a Chinese Dragon, and had joined the
He answered in the plural easily, nodding slightly in affirmation as Sherlock took this into account. His dark curls moved slightly as he tilted his head to the side in calculation, reading off of the man a sense of distance despite his outwardly friendly demeanour.
“I’m surprised you trust me, then. My… partner, he didn’t trust me for some time because he’d been treated so badly. He tried to freeze me, first time I met him. Some days, I still think he doesn’t. He’s… difficult. To read. But you don't seem to be angry, not at anything.”
So, instead I suggest you don’t struggle and instead offer the one thing that might make this better.”
That being said, I hate leaving stories unfinished, and still have a good idea of where my unfinished stories are headed. I will try to update soon ^_^
The sound of helicopter blades cut through the desert air like a scythe, louder than locusts and with a wind that tugged at the disheveled scarf around Hajera’s face.
He trailed off slightly, shoulders shrugging as he lost the words he wanted to say. It was hard to be eloquent, when the eyes of a stranger peered at you through the mask of a companion. Sherlock was overwhelmed with a strange sense of loneliness, staring at the blank and impassive face that was and yet wasn’t John Watson. He quite suddenly found himself wishing that Daniel would disappear, and that his good doctor would return to him. These were not John’s kind hands that left him, nor John’s lingering blue gaze. This was strange and new and fascinating, but it also left Sherlock feeling ultimately dissatisfied and worried.
In a way, he meditated on the fact that it could very well mean that he now had a duty to protect Sherlock Holmes.
A shudder went through the prisoners. No one dared to argue. They were swiftly silenced as Irene threw Hawborne’s broken body to the ground, her hands instead gripping his chains. She broke them efficiently, leaving them in the growing pool of blood beneath him. He was twitching, wet noises leaving his lips. Cerioth found himself unwilling to look away, staring into the man’s eyes. It was that, or stare at the terrible gash ripping open his abdomen.
Greg blinked through tears of pain, rubbing his chest and wincing. His eyes flickered from slit-pupiled to liquid brown, He groaned.
It was a few hours later when Sherlock received the phone call that finally allowed him to stop in his frantic searching for John all over the city of London. He was just beginning to come to terms with the fact that John might have very well left the city when Mycroft's number rang him, his brother's imperious voice floating to his ear as he spoke with smugness dripping in his tone.
There was no lingering presence of his grandmother, not even in the tacky wallpaper that lined the hallway.
And though Sherlock's mind was blazing, trying to reign in his anger at whoever made John react in this way to even the hint of failure, the detective managed to stay calm enough to stroke the top of Claude's head.
sorry this is so short ^.^'' school is eating my life and I'm frankly exhausted. Enjoy! Many thanks as always
As the door closed and John moved on autopilot to close the curtains, the image of the seal shimmered, and the man once more knelt crouched and cat-like upon the hardwood floor. Rising nobly, the man wrapped his pelt once more about his hips, not even bothering to bestow John with a glance even as his eyes flicked towards the stairs. Ignoring the ex-army doctor’s cry of protest, Mycroft ascended the stairs without a backwards glance. John was left to scramble after the creature, cursing every step even as he forgot the pain in his leg. He carried the bucket in his hand.
“My brother is… the more musically-inclined one,”he settled as an explanation. He hoped Greg would let it rest at that. Perhaps sensing his discomfort with the topic, Greg seemed to accept the answer.
“No doubt he was reluctant to inform you that I specifically requested I dorm alone? Or that I'm known throughout the school as someone who does not take pleasure in 'niceties'?”
used to such noises from his life with Sherlock as of late. Mike watched with some trepidation and surprise as his friend
It was Bill then who spoke once more, bringing forward an idea that John’s eyes lighting up in hope. “Then we have a barren Dragon care for the creature. John, your friend; Mike Stamford owns one, yes? Meriath I think it is? She could help you, and afterwards make sure that you’re clean enough to return to the compound, since she can smell the hormones but isn’t affected by them.”
But Claude would. Claude remembered everything. Even things that happened when she wasn't alive. Even things that hurt all of them when she had only been an idea.
“You don't have to do that. I....I'm not like them. I couldn't be if I tried....Believe me, I wish I could be sometimes....”
Naturally, John was roused not much later to hear a resounding moan as the bed beside him all but wailed against the creature's panicked thrashing, old springs shrieking almost as much as Sherlock as the Selkie woke with a snarl, eyes open and wild as he struggled to take in what was happening around him. In the dim lighting he was made of harsh lines and pale canvas, thunder and lightning coalescing into something ghastly and terrifying as he arched against the restraints holding him in place. For a moment John did not remember, could only gape at the pale, savagely snarling creature, eyes wide in disbelief as he struggled to remember previous events, how he wound up being where he was. When he
“-But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned. We have what you might call a… difficult relationship.” Mycroft interrupts, jaw clenching.
“I need you to be honest with me here John. As honest as you think you can be. Do you feel you can trust him? Your Dragon? Because if you can't, then you will find the training in Afghanistan to be extremely... challenging.”
“Chances are, no. But tell me anyway.” John remained stoic and staunch, unwilling to budge. Sherlock remained quiet a moment longer, but when he finally spoke, he looked up at John, silently daring him to look away as he stated
The higher-ups had demanded a collection of whatever weapons that were left, which amounted to anything that had been in use during the battle that hadn’t been completely destroyed. This meant that John had to kiss his hand-gun goodbye, at least until an order could be made for more supplies.
“You’re John Hamish Watson.” Sherlock murmured “Captain of the fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, army doctor and partner to Sherlock Holmes: that’s me, by the way.”
Being an ex-soldier made you alert and aware, and even though it was well hidden by soft jumpers and a startlingly gentle smile, he could see those sharp blue eyes automatically mapping out exits and entrances.
“You haven't been this close to the east borders in some time, brother. Is it really so close to the anniversary?”
Irene Adler could make a presence, even in darkness. The lantern she held was blinding, and she lifted it as she approached from the front of the company to show the unimpressed look on her face. Her blue eyes were slit-like, narrowed in distaste as she cast the lantern over the fallen prisoner. Cerioth caught a glimpse of dark, shorn hair. He knew the soldier vaguely, Lieutenant Hawborne. Human.
His voice was smooth and intentionally non-confrontational, yet still John felt his proverbial hackles rising, something decidedly smarmy in Mycroft’s tone.
And the creature's cerulean eyes slitted, cat-like and predatory as his melody became more insistent.
The sudden lunge had cost him, had made his heart begin to pound loudly in his chest, so loudly that it distracted him from what he was doing. Like a dripping tap, it was itching at the back of his head and making his revenge decidedly less enjoyable. Half of him recognized he was partially using the Human to lean on so that his knees didn't buckle.
He deliberated a moment longer, his hands curling and uncurling about the handle of his habitual umbrella. Finally, Mycroft sighed to himself. Best to face the situation head-on. If the Dragon currently being held in an isolated hospital ward was anything like the Sherlock he’d once known, no holding containment would keep him imprisoned for long.
The Chinese Dragon’s bare Human form came hurtling out of the sky like a stone and was expertly aimed to land on top of John, had Sherlock not instinctively folded his wings mid-air, barrel-rolling out of the way. John felt his world spin, his ears popping as he was suddenly upright again, looking below as the Dragon transformed again before he hit the earth, shifting from dark hair and olive skin to jade-green scales and golden eyes. Jerking hard, Sherlock rose back into the air by wrenching his wings outwards and beating them down with one painful stroke, taking off higher into the sky where the air was thinner and John felt the chill of the wind run through him. It all happened within what felt to be an instant.
Like the clay doll a daughter of a soldier had once thrown into the bars of his Kennel, frail and boneless.
The Selkie bared their teeth, and a halo of red hair made their eyes glint like icy fire as they parted their lips, emitting a hiss that made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand on end. The razor-points of its teeth flashed sharp and menacing, shark-like. Head burning with a craving for air, John landed a kick to the creature’s sternum, striking out as hard as he could. He found himself curiously without fear despite the desperation of the situation. Instead, rage was bubbling through his veins, liquid lava that burned and warmed him despite the water’s ice. He was not going to drown – Watsons didn’t drown! The sea was part of them, he would not be changing that fact just because he was losing his mind and beginning to believe in Selkies!
John blinked as Sherlock came waltzing in, a little surprised and pleased at the Dragon's confidence even though it was twisted by his glowering snarl. In the light of early morning, the creature's lithe figure appeared just a little bit healthier than it had before. His cheeks had just a little bit more colour in them, and instead of looking feverish and dazed those blue-green eyes were sharp and cutting as they flicked about the room. The young soldier could tell by the Dragon's stance that Sherlock was on guard, but not actively prepared to attack. Cautious curiosity, lingering like a simmering blaze just under a smooth pane of ice. His head was tilted slightly as he listened in rapt attention to the music playing in the flat, the CD player Harry had given John for his sixteenth birthday finally coming in handy. The creature's scales were a swirling, undecided colour, caught between transition from one emotion to another.  He froze immediately every time John shifted in his chair even the slightest. John tried not to flinch when that thundering voice rumbled in his head. A simple, questioning sentence.
The detective froze, wide-eyed and quiet as Mrs Hudson's shocked voice turned the kitchen into stone for an instant. The tail-end of his insult swiftly turned to sand in his mouth, and he realised what he had just said, the past two minutes rushing over him with a moment of clarity that left him near-dizzy and disoriented. When he realised the words that had almost come from his mouth, his skin turned if possible paler than it already was. Before him, John's jaw was clenched so tightly that his lips were pursed white.
It was to do with Sherlock, then. John somehow wasn’t entirely surprised. There was a prickling sensation along the back of his neck, tingling its way up and through his bad shoulder. He winced against the sensation.
As if he had found his voice from the pit of a well, Sherlock had growled a warning that sounded damn near possessive.
“Yes, sir.” Bill answered clearly, finally looking at the man head-on now that he was being addressed directly. John watched as his friend did not seem intimidated by Sebastian's controlling stance, holding his ground steadily and not flinching even when Wilkes sized him up with his eyes. The Colonel's voice was almost drawling as those brown eyes flicked over to Rin behind the man. John noted that though Bill remained remarkably relaxed, there was a small tightening of the interlocking of his teeth when his superior's attention was drawn away from him and towards his Dragon.
and went out into the night. No coat, no gloves. Only a worn blue scarf, smoke on his breath, and a half pack of cigs to his name.
Sherlock turned to his brother then, seeing the way his brother’s lips quirked minutely. The detective’s blue eyes narrowed, reading the minor tell.
John barely stirred, exhausted from his earlier breakdown. The Human’s hands flexed fretfully in his sleep, and a part of Sherlock was taken back to a time when another warmed his bed, so many years ago.
planning on having us sit at an actual table, for once.” He accused. John could feel his partner’s smile, wicked and just the tiniest bit playful.
It didn't take much for Sherlock to soon become one of the many that ate out of Sebastian's smarmy palm.
him, but it’s not a lie.” He shrunk back into his seat, a study in dread. “The prince might have died a long time ago, but the story itself is not a lie. My father… before he passed… He knew the king. He met him once, back when there was peace.” Xavi looked to Nalini then, quietly hopeful. “If the prince
What kind of secrets could someone who quite frankly sucked at lying hide? Especially from a man who made a living finding out the worst secrets about people.
John slowly let his body go slack, allowing the Dragon's arm to support all of his weight as he lowered his gaze submissively from the monster's piercing stare. His hand, which had come up to try and futilely fight against the creature's claws, carefully lowered to his side and went limp. Tentatively, the young man evened out his breathing as best as he could.
Closing her eyes, the images came in disjointed shards. Fractured scenes, playing out in her head in such a way that they made no sense.
A stretch of silence drew between them then, only broken by discordant waves slapping against stone. Sherlock’s voice was measured and careful when he spoke, but there was an edge to his voice that John had only heard when he was trying very hard to solve a particularly difficult puzzle.
hesitation, Sherlock reached out and took it. The flat filled with smoke as the two of them lit up, the ember of the cigarette's glowing ashen red as they each inhaled at the same time. Not-John blew out a smoke ring, watching it proudly as it floated above the detective's dark curls.
he was handsome. Where John had grown used to the pale skin, become wary of the unnaturally plump lips and hungry desire that burned in the Demon’s eyes, there was a startling sharpness to the man’s features. Sherlock’s cheeks were sharp enough that John could picture them as edged knife-points, and though his gaze was hungry thus far he had maintained a tenuous control, though his lips parted to reveal carnivorous teeth. John hadn’t realised that slowly the creature’s presence had begun to lower his defenses, but he stiffened in mortification as the hand that had been hovering over his throat sought out a lower path, trailing down his stomach to brush across his his cock.
That was John’s amazement, she could feel. Sherlock was slightly less incredulous, having at least had the experience of fusing before. Some of Aventurine’s shock melted away into worry, and
John shook away the thought, clenching his hands on the table. There was no need to underestimate Sherlock. No need to think so little of his self-control. That was half the problem lately! Sherlock felt as if he had...
“Your Dragon is required to take care of your needs, but they are also required to care for the needs of others. However, the line is drawn in two counts: sexual gratification and situations in battle.” The Brigadier's gaze turned a shade alike to gunmetal.
To John, the following weeks in the desert seemed to rush, to blur and shimmer like a mirage overhead. As if time lost itself in a vortex that swirled darkly above the land. Even the stars seemed not quite real when he found the time to look up to the sky, somehow brighter and far more abundant than they ever had been in London nights.
Sherlock stops, eyes narrowing for a split second before going wide as he realizes the implication in the soldier's tone.
The Dragon followed the trail of ice-cubes with a single-minded determination and speed, until it came past the entrance to the kitchen. There it hovered uncertainly, torn between following the source of the delicious-smelling meat and finding out where the trail of ice-cubes led to. He could see the outline of the young man standing between him and the plate of glistening fried food, his teeth bared in defensive suspicion as he lowered himself into a slow and coiled crouch. John, to his credit didn't turn around, even though his neck prickled in warning that a predator was stalking him. He kept his voice low and conversational even though he wasn't entirely sure if the creature understood him.
Mycroft couldn’t help but think. Compared to his own natural chilled disposition, it was like leaning into a min-sun. He liked it more than he wanted to admit.
It came out of the dark howling and savage, mouth dripping blood and eyes whitened by fury. Shooting out of the dark in a spined ball of rage it tore over the ground, causing the police to scream and scatter in response to its destructive wake. It tore through the crime scene, an acid-green ball of hate that made the hair on the back of John’s neck rise even as his Gem pulsed at his shoulder a drumbeat of excitement.
He wants to erase the tired lines and dark circles that form like bruises under his eyes, because he's almost sure underneath them is something that glints like gold.
The line of black stockings against snow-white skin was intoxicating to look at, and the sight was only made all the sweeter by the dark lace panties cupping Shyla’s arse. There was a rapidly-spreading damp patch along the front of them, and the detective couldn’t help the tremulous moan that reached her lips as John pressed forward, the warmth of his tongue causing Shyla to curl forward, fingers reaching instinctively to twine in the short blonde strands of her lover’s hair.
Mycroft did his best, but in truth he thought it a relief when he learned that another child could soon have a chance to hold the throne. He’d never been great with people (and wandering around without clothing was strangely freeing to a nine-year-old).
then, John’s own pleasure skyrocketed, and he opened his mouth to scream, stopped only by the pale hand suddenly pressed over his lips, muffling the sound of his cries.
The Selkies conferred a moment, Sherlock translating for John. Lestrade nodded when he understood, his eyes turning serious as he set his tea aside on the table. The older Selkie’s hands folded themselves between his knees as he leaned forward, looking to Sherlock with a vaguely pleading air.
The older Demon sighed, fingers tightening upon the handle of his parasol. His voice carried a note of impatience. “Are you aware that as a higher Demon I can sense when a lower Demon’s condition has changed? That I know that you engaged in intercourse with a human and bit into their flesh, physically tasted their blood?”
The elder Holmes cleared his throat, the poshly rounded syllables of his voice floating through the air with deliberate calm.
The old woman nodded in agreement, though now that John was closer he could see a kind of anxiousness about her. Mrs Hudson was looking at him with evident relief in her eyes, the kind that was clearly stemming from fear as she laced her hands together in her lap, seating herself with only a mild complaint about her “old bones and stubborn hip”. John took a seat beside her, his own internal panic melting into concern and curiosity as Martha nervously tucked a strand of white hair behind her ear.
Instead he forced himself to take a deep breath, cooling his anger down into a simmer before he tapped the surface of his glass thoughtfully, blue eyes shadowed in apprehension.
“Yes, well, you know how your father feels about our kind. We were hoping you might pass the message along.”
John found himself dressed in a woollen jumper, jeans and a blush-pink apron that he borrowed from Mrs. Hudson at five in the morning. He stared at the pan of bacon that was currently sizzling hotly before him on the stove, one hand resting absently in his pocket. The other was wound about the handle of fryer as he waited patiently for the Dragon downstairs to catch wind of its scent and make its way up the stairs.
Sighing softly to himself, John wondered if it might not be easier just to hang himself and get it over with now. He was completely incompetent with animals; he hadn't even owned a dog. He had tried to keep a cat once, but his father had found its hiding place in his closet while he had been at school and had drowned it in the creek by the forest.
Sherlock stiffened at his contact, still not quite used to a touch he hadn't initiated, but didn't quite pull away. The Dragon's voice was a confused rumble, a question that made the other soldiers about them fade away, and John's heart ached slightly as the creature asked
Molly’s eyes were lowered, and her cheeks flushed with pink shame. Of course, she hadn’t thought Sherlock capable of such a thing, to take someone against their will. Yet she was painfully aware that this was not a normal situation, and that there were time constrictions playing against Sherlock’s at times dubious but true moralities.
It was well into nightfall when John was finally allowed to find his bedroll and cot. The soldier’s legs carried him, but his feet felt like lead dragging him along. The only thing he felt vaguely aware of was the Northern Dragon walking silently behind him, Sherlock like a wraith or a shade in silence. Under the stars, the two of them found themselves without words to describe how they felt, and without a conscious consent, John found himself wishing he could curl against Sherlock’s chest, hide in his skin and bones and for just one night
“You mean do I know that our detective is a colossal berk who enjoys flouncing about naked far too much for someone who doesn't wish for other people to know the status of his bits? Yeah, I know Sherlock's... Sherlock.”
Bald, violent terror. For the first time, Sherlock saw the expression he had expected to paint John's face from when they had first met, and it twisted knots in his stomach and made the roaring in his ears fade. In John's irises, he could see
And she looked up into his face, into those dark eyes filled with endless night. Looked and looked, and her brother's hands tightened fractionally on her shoulders. For a moment, her brother's smile looked less like a grin, and more like a snarl.
Instead of sending him away like he expected them to, they both smirked as if they saw something in his face that they recognized. The blonde man pulled out a heavy key as he knelt in front of a heavily padded lock at the last cage to the right, and his light voice spoke out into the darkness conversationally.
With the sound of his name, time became unfrozen. And Sherlock, suddenly filled with an instinct so savage and vicious that it all but blinded him, leapt from the water like a snake to grab the Mate he thought he had lost.
Standing tall, Sherlock rose to reach for the stack of clothes he had folded precariously at the foot side of his bed.
not.” Victor sighed, but he smiled in fond exasperation even as he leaned against the wall beside the taller man. Though Sherlock had gotten lucky in the height department (father had towered, and so would he as luck would have it) the teen's hips still flared outwards in comparison, something that drove the young man to distraction that he didn't let show. He breathed in instead the cold air, letting it pinken his nose, glassy eyes fluttering closed in euphoria even as he buzzed with energy. Wonderful, the feeling of nothing. Especially when it was just slight enough that the crashing hadn't set in, but no one could quite tell he was gone from it all. All of his private critiques of both himself and others, dampened like they were wrapped in wet cloth.
Of course, Sherlock seemed to know at a glance just what exactly John was. His story was laid out before the man, read in the lines on his face and the texture of his skin. It was woven into John’s very jumper, and Sherlock read all of it and still invited him to stay at 221 B. Like a moth, the ex-army doctor followed, strange dreams urging him forward as much as his own fascination. He was helpless to the call, a siren’s drone suited just for his ears, and his alone.
She loved John Watson. Sherlock Holmes loved John Watson. Tanzanite loved John and Citrine and whatever form her companion chose to take. John loved Sherlock… but did he love Tanzanite?
“You must be my dorm-mate, Sherlock. I'm Victor Trevor, the headmaster told me about you.” The young man at Sherlock's responding silence seemed to shrink a little bit into himself, his smile fading as the darkly-curled teen didn't reciprocate his greeting. Sherlock stared harshly at the stranger, blue eyes narrowed in distrust even as he lazily drawled
Tanned brown and black bodies lay out in the sun, glittering with water as they bathed on the rocks below. A large cave-like construction led to some place unknown, but between the boys and it were dozens of chestnut-brown seals. They called to one another, their cries harsh and barking, and by their sides were bundles of half-fluffy beings, pups squeaking hungrily. Both John and Mike gasped in delight, trying to get a closer look from their position above. Of course, they didn't dare go closer in case one of the mother seals found them threatening somehow to their young, but they could clearly see each of the little pups as they wriggled about like fuzzy beach balls.
Sherlock didn't mind giving John dreams, not when his Human so obviously feared the traps of his own mind. Dark-ringed circles about the man's eyes were proof to that, and the Selkie's spidery fingers traced them even as he hummed a low vibrating tune under his breath. The shape of the soldier's jaw was angular, solid; a face weathered by the sun instead of the sea, and it was rough underneath his palm, almost prickly. Selkie's did not get stubble, and so Sherlock felt along the edge of the coarse, short fur, feelings its texture with experimental interest. Beneath his touch, John twitched, lost in the throes of memories not his own. Though Sherlock did not know what a dream was, nor a nightmare, it looked as if his Mate was uncomfortable. Soft cries uttered from the Human's parted mouth, and the Selkie silenced the feeble cries by pressing his lips possessively against him, silencing John even while changing the dreams, shifting them to something perhaps more joyful. In Sherlock's thoughts, he came to drift upon an experience he had as a child. Selecting it, he sang the melody that reminded him most of the past, humming low in his throat and crooning like a mother might to her child. Even as he did, the sun rose its way stutteringly into the sky, the last dredges of night sweeping away to make way for dawn.
There was something fragile to their features, in those high cheekbones and pale skin, yet John knew the muscles lining the detective’s abdomen, his arms. Coupled with scars both self-inflicted and received, Sherlock when wearing his coat could make a menacing figure. Shyla too, with her height and the mercurial glint in her eye. Both of them John found he loved fiercely, and part of him wondered how anyone could look at them and see something ugly instead of beautiful. He loved them so much it felt like his heart was aching some days, and though the detective seemed convinced that the life they were living now was sustainable, John wondered at times if Sherlock was happy. The army doctor wondered if somewhere on their quest for said happiness, if the detective had lost their way. For people were cruel, and John was no fool. He knew why no cases were taken earlier in the day, and it wasn’t because of his marvellous skills in bed (though a part of him did puff up a bit in pride that Shyla wanted him, had let herself be with him). No, it was because as beautiful as John found Shyla, found Sherlock, he knew already that only one side of the detective existed to the general public.
“Oh God.” He murmured, pale as snow. Beside him, Sherlock’s gaze was clear and powder-blue, standing out against the dirt smudged along his cheeks, settling into his dark hair. His lip was split, bleeding freely but already healing, scabbing over. The Dragon-man’s voice was low and tinged with the faint calculating tone of a scientist analysing a particularly scintillating puzzle. His features, however, were soft.
Breathing sharply through her nose. she spoke out into the silence, surprised as her voice hummed both lower, and higher than she expected.
“I planted them a long time ago, when we first moved in. Your mother never much liked them, but I always loved the smell in the spring. Mycroft was just a baby, he used to try to eat the petals.”
The Detective is surprised as very abruptly the entire manner of John's body changed. Daniel's entire expression slackened into a wide-eyed innocence, and his tightly coiled muscles loosened as John very suddenly relaxed into a cross-legged sitting position, a high, childlike voice passing his lips in utter excitement. It rings out in timid adoration.
Manners. Dragons were apparently really picky about them. John had been aware of it, even in the way Cerioth had spoken in the car to the other Dragons when they had been driving home from the Kennels. Was the creature hovering there..... because it wanted
“It’s working, then.” He murmured, and with Daniel’s slow nod Sherlock felt an overwhelming amount of relief mixed with a strange pang of something else. He looked at the soldier’s face, the lines of John’s eyes so familiar, now drawn in resignation.
Sherlock growled, a wordless noise of agitation, and he whirled to face John even as burning determination glowed hotly in his eyes like live coals.
Greg’s voice was quiet in the dim light, only speaking after a silence stretched between the two of them that was deep and somehow somewhat binding.
The Selkie heaved a sigh, as if the question were exceedingly dull. Impatiently he stepped forward, reaching down to grab John by the collar of his shirt. Still kitten-weak like a ragdoll, the creature’s inhuman strength lifted the ex-army doctor as if he weighed no more than a sack of potatoes. It was frankly belittling, to be manhandled, and John resisted it as best as he could, struggling.
unconscious, rather impressively so by John's fist, and his knuckles had stung a bit even as he barked at Sherlock to
“What is the price?” she had asked, because Rania had never had any power, and had never wanted it until now. Ryuk had shifted then, into a wyrm-like creature, so different from the other Dragons she had seen. To some, he might have seemed ugly, bone-white with ice blue accents and eyes scarred and sightless. Rania looked at him, and instead found herself ensconced by the graceful whip of his tail. He spoke into her mind, showing her images of his capture, the death of his own family. They shared one another’s pain, and felt strength draw from it.
are tiring as usual.” His speech was perfunctory, bleak even. For someone so young, it took Mycroft aback. Dark eyes seemed to assess him, stripping him of his layers of upbringing and revealing the socially awkward teen beneath.
Sherlock stood staring at his own reflection upon the water's surface, unblinking eyes regarding himself coolly, mirrors twin in length and scorn gazing at one another. The fountain was the only thing that dispelled the illusion of his double, cold water trickling from the stone statue's cupped hands and sending rippling pools across high cheekbones and darkly curling hair. Sherlock did not look up at the sculpture seeming to kneel above him with a guarded protectiveness, did not look at the marble woman's eyes, nor at how they wept water into outstretched palms that seemed to be reaching imploringly, begging. Instead he kept his gaze trained in the wider basin, his voice a soft breath as he murmured
She had showered, at least. There wasn’t as much dirt lining her face, and with the clean up it was evident to see just how tired his sibling was. Her voice was raspy, the result of having free range to nick and smoke cigarettes whenever she chose.
Except when he left his room, the trays of food still sat waiting for him, and when he crept soundlessly in the night, he could sometimes see that John had fallen asleep trying to catch a glimpse of him on the couch. And always, John looked as sleepless as Sherlock felt, even when in the midst of a dream. It was the fourth evening when John returned home, drunk and not even hesitating to fall asleep on the couch, that Sherlock realised.
When the sea was blackened and mysterious, dark and unruly on its surface only to be still in the depths below. When lightning flashed, illuminating the waves, highlighting ghostly figures swimming in the shadows before flickering back to black. He could taste the flavour of unrest on his tongue, dark and heady as he swam. The ocean was uneasy.
“It doesn’t tell us more about the Heartsong?” Bill growled, the sound something inhuman. The sudden sharp
John learned this in the early years of dating Sherlock, and very quickly he got into the habit of learning that his detective wasn't the only one with preconceived notions about what was
Then, finally accepting the loss of his mind, John Watson dragged himself to his feet, climbing up the stairs to his flat. He almost didn't notice the brown-paper package waiting for him, leaning like a visitor against the wall by the door. The young man couldn't remember sending away for anything, so he paused at the crest of the last step and stared, one blonde brow lifting in surprise. It seemed unlikely it was from anyone he knew. Harry couldn't afford to send him anything and his Father wouldn't have bothered. His only real friend was Mike, but he would have given John anything he needed to in person instead of leaving it at his flat. But perhaps it was for Mrs. Hudson or one of the other tenants?
The human’s jaw lifted, clenched tight in preparation of retaliation. Moriarty’s hand lifted with inhuman speed to strike, a promise on his lips that had Sherlock for no real reason already moving, driving forward to intercede. “Too bad I now owe you a good beating, fifty years of madness should about make up for the slight
Something to grasp onto. He was not just John. He was many others. And he spent many a long night staring into the mirror of his little room unblinkingly, trying to see a trace of someone else in the depths of his deep blue irises and ash-blonde hair. Wondering what the other versions of him were like.
John had not understood the words they'd hissed as the attacked, but Sherlock had been able to translate all too well. Eventually, the attacks in his dreams turned into faces he recognised, Rin lunging for his throat, her shriek of triumph eerily similar to that of the shriek of the alarms that had blared over the base. The next instead Murray, eyes dark and unreadable as he held a gun to John's head. His voice filled with moroseness as he muttered
For one, she was beautiful as a sunrise, her hair a deep mahogany red, tied up with military-neat precision. She bore the colouring of an English Dragon, eyes piercing blue and cheeks rosy pink. But that wasn't what gave her presence. Rather, it was in the colour of her scales, which glinted in patches at her neck and under her sleeves. Brilliant, shining gold. The hilt of a decorative sword. Her Master held out his hand to John with an easy smile.
, then he should probably stay out of their way. Yet his feet held him planted in place, not allowing him movement as the sound of chains clicking onto a Collar and tugging filled his ears. In response there was a terrible, animalistic snarling, the kind that made the hair on the back of John's arms and neck stand on end. It echoed down the hall, alerting Mike and Dodge to what was going on. The lieutenant scowled, coming forward and making as if to grab John's arm, except the blonde man stayed firmly still. His eyes didn't move from the entrance of the Cage as slowly, bit by bit, the two men heaved and pulled. One of the men cussed loudly as whatever was inside pulled back, but they held their ground and kept tugging.
As if sensing the creature’s desire, John bared his throat, submitting wordlessly even as his hips stuttered, his own release hitting him like a solid punch in the gut. In that moment Sherlock’s lips parted, pressed against the soldier’s neck. He bit down, teeth so sharp that John scarcely felt a thing until the Incubus began to drink. Then,
“You don't have to open that one John, if you don't want to.” Sherlock answered immediately, soothing the man's fears. “Any other ones?”
She felt him break away only when the mark was the satisfying shade of red wine, John taking in a deep breath of air as if to steady himself above her. He was still standing, but likely wouldn’t be for much longer. At least, not so long as she had her way. Shyla could feel an ache deep inside of her that normally she ignored, and it throbbed in time with her heartbeat. Or perhaps it was just the rhythm of John’s fingers, pressing lightly against the bruise so that the detective could feel it.
Part of his difficulty stems from it being that not all of his memories are his own. Disconcerting black spots, they litter his existence and leave him wondering. Like a target littered with bullet holes, they bleed into his mind and paint over events in time. He cannot remember a time any longer when those dark spots didn't exist, because they started when he was very young. They followed him from childhood, when his family when taken from him in a horrific car crash that is blotted out by the black and inky darkness and he was left an orphan.
John watched the nervous tick of the woman’s hands and felt a small pool of dread settle in the pit of his stomach. Dodge however maintained her practiced smile. Her voice was jovial as she replied, nodding for Hajera to lead the way.
through that made him clench his teeth and have to breathe carefully through his nose to still his rage.
The wind howled like a banshee, and with it came the first shrieking warning that jolted John’s men from their somewhat relaxed poses. Their breath united came out in nervous clouds, eyes straining in the dark for sight of what everyone knew would be the first wave of attack. John, bow ready, hardly dared to breathe at all, the command to attack brushing just behind his lips, on the tip of his tongue.
That was another thing, his body was beginning to change. Little scrapes, cuts and bruises had become the norm for the young soldier, especially around his knees and elbows. The sun had burned his skin pink, peeling it away to reveal a tone that was nut-brown. Muscles that before had been well-trained but inexperienced for battle had now hardened, and John’s blonde hair had turned nearly white with the sun. Sweat became a constant, sticky feeling along the small of his back and his thighs.
Claude was always careful like this. She had to be. Danger could be at any turn, despite Daniel's reassurances that he would come if he sensed The Body was in trouble. Palms lying spread on the wooden ground and bracing her weight lightly on the balls of her feet, she observed quietly that the older Others had been right. They had moved yet again, the beige bedsit no longer glaring at her with stark hatred. Nervous creature she was though, she carefully checked under the bed, searching for the Browning. Big Brother Conrad didn't like it when she touched guns, but it's not like she didn't know how to use them. However she frowned as John's usual hiding place of his weapon seemed to have changed. A pout formed slightly on her features, looking strange on the face of a middle-aged man and yet childishly cute to any observer.
Physical hurt was easier, than this. Yet chancing a glance up at his partner, John knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was no longer an option.
“It comes with the connection we feel with Dragons, mate. You can’t expect to immerse yourself in another species’ mindset and not be affected.”
Harry, of course, was less than impressed by the gifts her grandmother brought to her. She frowned at the little, chipped shells she was given, scowled at the sea glass John had only a moment ago described as
“Egg-Snatcher.” His hands at his sides tightened into fists, his blank face as good as a final judgement even as he looked up and at Captain Benson, awaiting orders. John knew that look, and was thankful that for once he was not under the overbearing weight of it. Sherlock did not look people in the eye often, but when he did, his gaze could look through a man, as if turning his insides into water and pulling anything of worth out in the process. It was not an easy gaze to match, though Benson tried valiantly to. In the end however, his gaze ultimately flicked to John.
Aside from the singing, the palace was deathly quiet. His breathing felt like an intruder, so that John felt compelled to inhale slowly, and sparingly as he could. He followed the melody, past cold paintings of wars long before his village’s time, past shining and expensive vases filled with strange flowers. The stone floor was cold under his bare feet, his sandals forgotten. John came to the end of the hall, turned to the west, and followed as if in a trance.
Irene moaned, and John reeled back in horror when Irene looked up. Her eyes were gone, replaced with black, empty sockets. Her voice was dull and lost.
If he closed his eyes, he could still remember that rush, like your stomach was falling out from under you and you were tumbling into an abyss. Except at the bottom was only feather pillows, and they numbed your other senses so that the ones you needed sharpened incredibly to a point. The answer to the man's question wasn't a simple answer of having daddy issues or a tragic story of a broken home.
The cold, dreading feeling hadn’t left his chest entirely, but it did loosen the further he was from the room. Able to breathe again, John felt his emotions come flooding back to him, trickling past blind terror. He had never questioned why the girl in the legends he’d had learned growing up had betrayed Sherlock, but given Irene’s story it all made a certain kind of terrible sense. His village had never had an issue with same-sex couples (though his father had tried to use it as an excuse to have him not be taken by Sherlock), but he knew of various villages across the Eastern half of the world that did. What kind of desperate, foolish acts might he be pushed to, if he’d found himself in love with only men and unable to reciprocate those feelings? Love was meant to be a natural, thoughtless thing, and when it wasn’t it made people unpredictable, capable of terrible things.
It was at that moment that John's grandmother came forward, blue eyes scowling as she put her hands on her hips. Her gnarled voice was acerbic as she glowered at the doctor.
They both stumble into the dark flat, John trying not to trip over the couch on the way to the stairs, Sherlock not even caring as his legs jerked out from under him and he landed face-first onto the soft green-black cushion. The blonde man paused at the bottom of the steps, glancing at the wraith-like figure of his flatmate sprawled with his cheek buried in the back of the couch. His voice soft in the dark, he hesitated before gripping the railing of the stairs.
“You are a prince to the nation, my child,” he explained “And so you must protect others, instead of teaching them to fear you.” He’d added as an afterthought, seeing his son shivering “Also, you might want to consider putting on clothes, if you take the form of a man. The mountains grow cold at night.”
It was a long time after the silence began that John managed to convince himself to stand, jaw clenching tightly. In his hands, the worn-edged book felt like a dead weight, opened as it was to the impossible page entitled The Selkie and Their Children.
"The poor thing's frightened and we're not allowed to see him?! And yet you say that there's little to be done –"
.” Sherlock found the image of his father blurring before his eyes, marred by the tears burning in the back of his throat. His hands lay in his lap, for once mercifully still.
As he spoke, the sleek shine of a car glinted in the corner of Sherlock's vision, and the man spun on the pavement to see the vehicle already pulling up to the kerb. Mycroft's voice was professional, but it held in it his signature smirk as he ended the call with a taunting good-bye.
John wasn't dull like the rest of the world, and would understand his somewhat manic insistence on the doctor's safety.
As it was, in the course of around a week John’s relationships with his colleagues were beginning to become slightly strained. Only Bill Murray, ever understanding as a fellow
So, ignoring his friend's protests and growled insults (the likes of which were so colourful they made Bill's eyebrows rise in amusement and Rin smirk from behind the veil of her hair) John dragged Sherlock to the nurse, attempting to find some way in which he could avoid having his partner continually on the precipice of heatstroke.
Yet that thought was broken apart, dissolved in a dream when John realised that he had finished, that his gun was clean and loaded and ready. A heavy but familiar weight in his palm, he blinked once before rising from the bench. Dodge lowered her weapon from the targets as she saw him approach, clicking on the safety and allowing John to use her shooting range as he stepped forward, grabbing a pair of headphones on the way.
Greg sat back in the chair, rubbing at his face tiredly. The moon outside made Mycroft guess that dawn was well on its way.
That evening was quiet, as John abruptly left his meal on the table, stumbling as if in a dream to curl up on the couch in a twisted mockery of Sherlock’s usual moods.
He kept his bow at the ready, even as the night lagged and he was urged once or twice to take a shift off by his mates. Something about the moon kept John on edge, how its pale moonlight painted everything white as it appeared from behind parted clouds, bleaching everything to bones. It made every slow blink of his eyelids feel surreal, like the air was tinged with a magic far beyond his understanding.
Harry's expression was mildly unimpressed as she looked at him in the hallway, arms crossed over chest in disapproval. As usual, she looked beautiful. Her white-blonde hair was artfully clipped in glittering combs and ribbons to trail down one side of her neck, her lips blood red and pursed in irritation, sharply contrasting the dark blue of her festival robe.
“Master Sherlock is out currently, but he's told me to treat you as I would him in his absence. You must be hungry from your travels, would you care for anything? Tea perhaps if nothing else?”
For when he finally could manage to open his eyes, to sit up, a cup of tea waited for him on the table, still-warm. He had never talked about his past to anyone, could never remember it. Perhaps it was better that way?
John woke to unfamiliar fingers, sticky and wet slapping his cheeks. His eyes parted muzzily in confusion, blinking blearily as he found himself staring into a pair of bright blue eyes. A mop of riotous blonde curls tumbled around a cherubic face, tiny, chubby hands pulling on John's ears. John gasped as he came awake, seeing the toddler on his chest and realising it was no illusion. For growing from her back, sticky from mucous that had encased her inside the egg, twin wings the rosy colour of purpling clouds at sunset flapped experimentally.
