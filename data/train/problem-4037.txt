Poker face be damned, he couldn’t help but return the smile, shaking his head to dismiss Dean’s veiled flirtation. Dean nodded as if to chalk the interaction up as a success. They were close enough to their location, some luxury club that catered to a celeb clientele. It was just a few more minutes until Cas could park up and return to his novel.
“Guns,” the stranger said, stressing the plural, head tipping forwards towards the shotgun. “But, I’d prefer you tell me,
The door swung shut behind Dean, and the night breeze felt sobering. He laughed softly at the thought, knowing the dip in his distraction levels had a lot more to do with realizing he’s in love with his best friend, and he couldn’t ignore that anymore. Fuck. Dean slid down to sit on the curb, his head fell into his hands, and damnit, Dean Winchester did not cry.
Dean stacked their empty bottles into an overflowing recycling can before spinning back around to address Sam. His younger brother had received the clean-up hint & rose to his feet as well. “
Dean even admitted things he hadn't ever acknowledged himself, let alone shared with anyone. Dean's sexuality wasn't so much suppressed as it was ignored, and he had managed to avoid it for the eighteen years he walked the earth so far, at least before this summer. Castiel had just brought up the topic so casually, and the possibilities that opened up had Dean stumbling through his first time coming out. Of course, Castiel had done so much more eloquently, always speaking in that way that made Dean think he might be from another time.
School was great, but his family was a different story, though. Their dad was back and insisted on a family dinner to celebrate their first day, Sammy, Dean, and John, all one big happy family. Dean could see through the charade, though. He knew it was never about him and Sammy or school at all - this was about the
Castiel looked at Dean with a plea in his eyes, again lifting his two wine bottles towards Dean. “Will, you just
Castiel felt the air punched out of his lungs. He’d never... said, done anything to make Dean think... He couldn’t know, Cas himself hadn’t even said it out loud. He didn’t hear any signs of ill intent, he knew Dean wouldn’t hurt him, but was he just teasing or serious or what? God, if he was just joking then reacting like this (all wide eyes and mouth open and absolutely no sound coming out) didn’t help any remaining hope of denying it.
Cas had fixed his tie. Dean used the time to study the lines of Castiel’s jaw, his eyelashes, the creases in the corner of his eye, the shape of his lips.
I’m sure the way you saw me go through the entire display, not complaining once, just waiting and watching, that look on your face?
Unnoticed, Cas was able to slide down the bed enough to reach out and touch Dean’s hand, where it rested on the cheap motel bed. Castiel’s fingertips ghosted over Dean’s, coming to rest for a second while they locked eyes.
Dean tucked his phone away into his pocket and shuffled around, peeking in the mirror again and running a hand through his already messy hair. Cas thought he looked annoyingly perfect. Dean opened his own door to get out, another chauffeur’s task that Castiel was loath to give up, regardless of Dean’s insistence., He stopped before exiting all the way and turned back around to reach through the partition and rest a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Text ya when I’m wrapping up.” He tilted his head towards Castiel’s messenger bag on the passenger seat. “Enjoy your T-Rex book!”
Castiel only seemed more confused as Dean spoke, his face warping six ways to Sunday before landing on that misplaced amusement that Dean was getting sick of denying was cute. There’s nothing funny about this situation; Castiel should be much more bothered by his surroundings: salted windowsills and sigil-marked walls and Dean himself, some random guy Castiel had found with two weapons inside ‘his house.’
The pair locked eyes, and Dean felt it necessary to speak up. "Sorry, my radio too loud?" A confused head tilt instead of an answer made Dean huff out a soft laugh.
“Maybe I’m just a brat.” Cas scrunched up his nose at Dean, hiding his smile to keep the pout he was faking.
With the likely accurate assumption that he was standing across from a hot weirdo artist and not some super threatening supernatural creature, Dean couldn’t remember what he had been so nervous about. Just for a moment, though, because once Dean was done checking out the way the man’s paint-splattered jeans stretched over his thighs, the nerves crept back in once his gaze returned to the fuckin’ guns.
It had looked domestic, natural, and it had felt that way too, and for the first time in Dean’s entire life, that thought hadn’t scared the shit out of him.
Frustration turned tantrums, confusion turned butterflies in his stomach, butterflies turned back to chaos.
“Oh, Dean, please.” Dean didn’t change his pace, just swirled his tongue over the sensitive skin underneath the head, still not taking Cas any further. He bucked his hips against the mattress, seeking friction as he pulled back, pressing open-mouthed kisses down the man’s length. Dean’s hands curled around Castiel’s hips until Cas reached down to pull one of Dean’s hands into his own. Dean faltered for a moment while Castiel intertwined their fingers, his heart leaping up against his ribcage so hard he thought it might burst through.
“Want to wait, you too,” Cas wasn’t quite eloquent, but Dean got the point. He looked up to see the man had his head pressed back into the pillow, his back arching slightly as he collected himself. Dean just moved up on the bed to press soothing kisses on Castiel’s heated skin, squeezing his hand and using the other to stroke through his hair. A few seconds later, Cas was rolling them over, yet again straddling Dean’s hips, this time, significantly less clothing between them. Dean would never get used to how good Cas felt pressed against him like that.
“She asked the question only a few minutes after you reached over to wipe the coffee drip off of my chin,”
“Apologies.” Castiel cleared his throat before reaffixing a confident stare at Dean, his movement across the floor only stopping once he was hovering on the line of
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean, grabbing the newspaper he had given Dean earlier, placing it back in his hands to change the subject. “Maybe then it’s your future since you started the fire. You have all the girls fawning over you all the time.” Cas hoped his tone came across as teasing and not jealous, of neither Dean nor the girls he dates.
his movements stopped and he rode out his orgasm underneath Castiel’s weight. Cas watched Dean with awestruck eyes, trying to hold on just a few seconds longer to appreciate Dean’s beauty,
Castiel's only wish was the ability to truly settle down somewhere, to know people for more than a few months, to feel like it was worth getting to learn a new lunch table worth of names every semester. He was only here until the end of the summer when the family would move on to Ohio for the beginning of Cas's senior year. The Novaks' (Dean got the boy's full name the first night when he entered the contact information into his phone) traveled more than they didn't, and Dean could hear the longing in Castiel's voice when he spoke of the times before they had started life on the road.
“I would be more comfortable if I kept the gun out, thank you.” He spoke so calmly, tone of voice more suited for a library than the upper hand of a fight. Dean almost felt he couldn’t argue with the logic there. “I’m Castiel, and I told you already.” Dean just looked up at him, amused and not at all thinking about the gun pointing at him anymore. He was just watching. Messy dark hair, shockingly blue eyes, few days of scruff, a little dirty, mostly just hot. It wasn’t that he didn’t
Dean had heard the cliches of butterflies or fireworks or sparks or whatever chick-flick bullshit, but he always thought of it as dramatics. The feeling in Dean's stomach when Cas leaned in (not quite clearing the distance between them but
Castiel stood up, not bothering to pack his notes back into his bag as he was more concerned with getting out of Dean's hair. Instead, he tucked them under his arm. "Oh, sure, the photography assignment? Self-portrait?" He wasn't sure where his ability for conversation was coming from. Typically, he would have already nodded a few times awkwardly and dashed out of the corridor, but Dean was still standing between him and the exit door. Part of him wanted to stay, but the more significant part of him knew Dean hung around with some kids who definitely hadn't been kind to Cas in the past, and that part of him was anxious to get out of the enclosed space.
Cas could hear the tremble in his words, could pinpoint where his emotions snuck through with damned disappointment at Dean’s immediate reaction, but he hoped Dean couldn’t tell.
part that really kept Castiel coming back to the small abandoned cabin. He could spend time alone without the fear of interruptions, without the threat of the other boys in town, his older brothers, or his parents.
“I am an angel, and I was not blocked from entering. I do not even feel weakened, and that leads me to believe any additional runes or…” Castiel droned on, tracing symbols in the air with his finger as he spoke, but Dean couldn’t hear a thing. His brain was on overdrive.
The time that kiss ended was filled with much less panic, having lasted long enough for Dean to sort out whatever he had been unsure of the first time and long enough that Castiel was sure he hadn't misread anything. Dean pulled away again that time, but only to rest his forehead down onto Cas's shoulder with a soft groan.
The table let out a nearly synchronized sigh like Castiel’s life was some teenage romance novel, and Meg ruffled his hair with a reassuring pout. "Gotta be something real special then, kid. Tell me more." He knew the other girls likely pitied him, but Meg's care seemed genuine. It was just days ago that Cas was face to face with Dean, just days ago that he felt the bubbling hope and excitement that the other brought him, just days ago that Dean washed it all away.
There was a woman next to him, one arm tucked around her waist to hold her pressed against his side.
“You call this assisting? You stole my weapons and tackled me. You held a blade to my throat.” Dean crossed his arms, staring the angel down with matched intensity.
Cas scrunched up his nose as he tried and failed to duck Dean’s hand. The cabin felt oddly complete with Dean here. He had always felt a little strange having this place to himself, without his best friend knowing at all. The other boy may have different friends, but Dean was all Cas had, and he didn’t keep many secrets from him.
Dean was slightly taller, and he used that to his advantage, looking down at the man, back straight as a rail, testing his grip to be sure they weren’t going anywhere. He laughed in disbelief, glancing around the entirely empty room they stood in, lit only by the street lamplight sneaking through the window.
“Shorts, off.” Dean gasped the words along with a few choice expletives as Cas continued to tease over a sweet spot behind Dean’s ear, frustrated and amazed that Castiel had him this flustered. Cas obeyed, but to do so had to roll off of Dean. Dean went to pull off his own sweats but stopped immediately once he realized he’d miss Castiel undressing.
This year had been different; he had a summer fling, a boy he thought wanted to keep him around. It didn't matter, though. Dean had left, gone back to school to find the pretty blonde girl Castiel's insecurity insisted in harsh whispers that the boy had left behind. Cas deleted Dean's number as soon as he got home after their last meeting; he didn't want to leave himself the option to send some sort of pathetic text.
He tried to answer but it came out as more of a soft groan than anything resembling English. That got Castiel another kiss, this one pressed to his temple with a quick turn of Dean’s face. Cas replied in turn with another soft groan. That one was not meant to be words though. They lay there in comfortable silence before Cas cleared his throat to speak, pushing the disappointment out of his voice.
Dean looked up and away from the mirrors he sat between, locking eyes with Castiel, a knowing, confident smirk. Cas realized too late he had been caught, but he didn’t find himself caring anymore. It must have been the last shot he took that did away with the last of his reservations.
, with a bottle of…” Castiel leaned in close to read the bottle from where it peeked out under Dean’s bearhug of a grasp. “Johnnie Walker? For
Cas knew the area where he was headed, and so the drive was easy. Once Castiel pulled onto the highway, he could focus on the road unfolding ahead of him, and away from the flirtatious casual conversation behind him. He glanced at the console to confirm the time and quickly calculated that he could be in bed around 3 am if everything went smoothly.
Maybe Charlie will come and see someone moving in on her girl. Yeah, perhaps, perhaps somehow Charlie would sense it happening and come and scare De-. No.
Holding the plate of ashes between the candle and the wall created a shadow, one that resembled a poorly drawn display of hills rather than a clear hint as to who he should marry. Dean and Castiel both squinted at the figure on the wall, trying to make a shape out of the vague nonsense.
As if on cue, the woman pulled away slightly to speak, voice lilting and crystal clean, not even close to what Dean needed to hear. That was it. He barely registered her words, blinked twice before he stuttered out some bullshit excuse about needing the bathroom before he turned straight towards the exit.
Castiel expected more of a fight, but Dean had been hiding the bottle in his arms for a reason. He didn’t hold back the glares, however, and bumped his shoulder against Castiel’s as he brushed past to return his find. On his way back, he managed to touch almost every bottle, seemingly checking to see if Cas was paying him any mind, waiting to be chastised. Castiel ignored him, turning his own attention back to choosing between white wines.
Castiel blinked twice and let out a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, sounding more exasperated than ever. He didn’t bother arguing, he just stared at the mulled wine blankly, every single brain cell working hard to weigh the pros and cons of leaving Dean right here in the middle of the store and going to the dinner himself.
The boy spoke then, slow and careful, his voice deeper than expected, "I don't mind." He seemed genuine, and a small smile tugged at the corner of his lips.
The soft thumps of the bed against the wall turned more frantic, & the man’s moans reached a fever pitch. Dean chases after his pleasure, sliding onto his back & turning his head to bite his pillow, needing to stay silent. He couldn’t risk being heard, he couldn’t risk not hearing.
Castiel immediately met his eyes again, ready to shut him down on his negative path. He already noticed Dean relax slightly under his gaze; even the ghosting feeling of being watched was enough to soothe him, hold him still on his spiral. "It's fine, hey." Castiel reached out, and Dean handed over his phone, a new contact page open. "Our paths don't cross too often." It was partially untrue, they had two classes together this semester, and their senior class was small enough that they couldn't exactly ignore the other. But, on the other hand, Cas did spend a fair amount of time staying far away from a few of Dean's friends and teammates.
Right as Dean stepped forward to enter the room, his free hand reaching out to swing the door open, everything went sideways. Dean looked right to check his corners, and as he did, he felt something press him into the room against his back and then, a frigid, harsh line across his throat. With the constant pressure of a knife holding him in place, Dean glanced down to see (what appeared to be, god, please be)
Castiel was powerless, his usual ability to suppress had left the building the moment Dean’s lips came this close to his own. “You can’t mean that.” His self-doubt stuck around, however.
Cas pouted, a hand immediately shooting up to attempt and flatten the various strands that seemed to point where they please. “It is not sex hair. I’ll have you know I showered.” He gestured to the strange clothing he wore, seemingly two sizes too big for Castiel because he looked small, and he isn’t. He looked enough to pick up and toss around a little, small enough that if he were to only be wearing the t-shirt, it’d still cover everything, and
Before Dean could re-sort his thoughts enough to react past his state of shock, Cas turned back around to the door and turned his key. He only betrayed the slightest twitch of an expression, the tightening under his eyes that either means he’s amused or about to slam Dean against the wall in frustration.
The universe sent Castiel another kick while he was down, already on his knees and uselessly hiding. The container he held in his (now sweating and useless) hands slipped out of his grip.
"Castiel, your mother and I... All three of us," He gestured to Cas widely. "We're done hopping from town to town. We got the funding to open a branch just miles away. Starting tomorrow, you can have a normal senior year..."
In a flagrant display of dramatics, Dean held out his hand, partially bowed with his legs in a slight curtsy. Cas laughed softly and put his hand out into Dean's waiting palm. "My lord," Dean forced the words out through tight lips, forcing his smile down for the bit. He even used an awful posh accent, really milking the moment for the sake of entertaining Castiel.
Castiel was not in the mood to be laughed at, the minuscule nuances of navigating possible innuendos around Dean was not his priority while they were approaching hour three of their tense battle. “Will you just
The problem with trying to anticipate the difficulty of a hunt is the tendency for this job to throw you some curveballs. After a long day of research, the last thing Dean had been expecting was the woman he let take him back to her apartment to pull a knife on him. To be fair, he hadn’t seen a photo of the target since she was 14 and reported missing, and he was just out for a quick lay at the bar. How was he to know that in the 7 years since the photo was taken, the girl had evolved into precisely Dean’s type for a one-night stand? To make a long story short, once the girl had successfully slashed at him with her weapon, Dean clued himself in pretty quickly. His vision narrowed, laser-focused on the curve where neck meets shoulder, finally noticing the faded bite marks on the girl’s neck. It’s amazing the clarity that you feel with sharp steel tearing into your skin.
Dean responded, proud of his ability to match the guy’s tone, even if he was just a bit breathless still. “Well, let’s say it is your house. Cuz it’s not. Shit’s abandoned, I checked. But if it was your place, I would tell ya that I’m claiming squatter's rights. I’m no lawyer, but I do have way more things in this house than you do.”
“Are you familiar with the concept of distraction? Ever forgot about one injury when another worse one occurs? Gotten drunk to forget pain? I cannot forget. I remember every single thing, by design. I feel wholly, each stimuli equally effective and, therefore, nearly functionally useless. Sure, Ariel felt pain, but he also felt, at the same time, the peace of the calm night air. Heard the gravel crunch on the country road, saw the glow from the stars, and heard the voices of our siblings and the prayers from the faithful. The knife was the same to him as the feeling of the solid ground underneath his vessel’s feet, no more than a reminder of the physical self.”
"What's that for?" Castiel squinted at the phone in Dean's hand, and if they hadn't been texting for a few weeks, Dean might actually take his extreme confusion as proof he'd never seen a cellphone.
Castiel undid his seatbelt and slid across the bench seating to get closer to Dean, moving the bag from the winery from where it had been sat between them as a barrier. He reached up to cup Dean’s cheek, feeling the relaxed grin under his touch. “I’m glad we get to have bad days together, Dean.” Castiel returned the smile, his hand sliding down to rest on the other man’s neck, bringing their lips together in a soft kiss. That kiss turned into another one, turned into a third until they were both satisfied that their earlier words had been sufficiently made up for.
It was overwhelming, but their need was magnetic and Dean couldn’t keep himself from rolling over onto Castiel, effectively taking back control as the man’s lips went pliant under his own. Dean knew no experience on the entire planet would ever compare to the brightness he felt bursting from his chest, charging the air around them with giddy desire.
He wanted to mention that Gabriel would be away all weekend, but Castiel chickened out after handing Dean back his cell, their fingers lingering in joined contact for much longer than needed. If just that tiny amount of contact was enough to have Castiel's brain short-circuiting, changing him into someone who comfortably flirts with boys and sounds confident and relaxed, he wasn't sure what would happen if they spend time together alone in Castiel's empty dorm room.
Cas let himself stare unabashedly at Dean longer than he normally would, knowing he was shrouded in darkness and honestly not caring anymore if he were caught. It was more important to watch how the flame of the candlestick caused a golden light to flicker over Dean’s face. Cas wanted to kiss his freckles. The alcohol made things slightly hazy, but it didn’t dull his feelings, in fact, the opposite was true.
Regardless of the nonsense babble, the smile the girls gave him in response held no malice. He just needed a few moments to catch his breath and get the green flecks off his fingers so he could be free to wipe the tears that threatened to leak onto his cheeks. He mumbled to them to thank Charlie, and without further explanation, he dashed towards the bathroom against the furthest wall in the gym. He carefully maneuvered through the crowd, ensuring no run-ins with Dean would occur on the way there. He received plenty of stares, a few laughs, and a crude glitter-themed joke or two that Castiel thought didn't make much sense while on his way, but Castiel would rather the entire school see him like this than have a single run-in with Dean, suit of glitter or not.
“Wouldn’t you be if you were stabbed?” Castiel cut off his trail of thought, leaning in a bit closer as he spoke.
“It’s you, Cas. See? You thought you moved out of the way but I could still see you there, over my shoulder.” And then Dean was turning and tugging again, and this time Castiel did fall into his lap, eliciting a high-pitched squeal from the boy. “You said it’s all signs, right? Tell me what about tonight didn’t say it was us.” Dean’s tone was serious, and despite the smell of vodka on his breath, he seemed to truly mean the words. Castiel was still reeling from being pulled onto Dean, now sitting sideways on his lap. He felt like his head was full of water.
rather, but instead, it feels wrong. Dirty. Dean feels weaker than ever, smaller than he thought possible in a place he’d normally consider his domain. His heartbeat sped, and she likely felt it where one hand lay over his chest.
Dean was still immensely confused at the change of events. Less than three minutes ago the man standing in front of him was having clearly enjoyable sex, then not so much, & now he’s? Standing in Dean’s doorway, skin flushed pink & hair delightfully mussed. “Yes, sorry to interrupt, I know we have not yet met. I’m Castiel, I live next door.” Dean managed to wipe the dumbstruck look off of his face, fully taking in the view before him. He had also not been wrong about the man’s build. Sure, he was a few inches shorter than Dean was, but
His fingers maneuvered around the countless receipts shoved there over the last few days and caught on the key Dean needed.
"I just… I don't know, man, I just wanted to kiss you, and I did, and I'm sorry - I don't - I'm not-" However, as Dean spoke, the denial seemed manufactured, nearly forced.
Pushing his thoughts away with a grimace, Dean pulled apart the plastic that held the sanitized needle. He knew this would clear his mind of any self-doubt, it was too hard to focus on forming the perfect image of his father to berate himself with while he’s quite literally stitching himself back together. Once the plastic packet came apart, Dean watched helplessly as his too-big fingers fumbled to catch the tiny needle, but instead heard the telltale
“Pleasure to meet you.” The man sounded almost bored and stared right back, no hesitation in his stare, making Dean flare with annoyance. His voice matched his demeanor, uninterested and rugged. “Why are you in my house?”
“Sorry, habit. Faster than taking the stairs, especially if you planned on pacing yourself as you had on the way up.”
Dean chuckled darkly at himself, trying to shake off the negative feelings bubbling up. How weak he had sounded when he tried to excuse away his actions. Hope breaking into sadness in Castiel’s eyes, the way it was like a switch flipped, and seconds later the feelings were wiped clear, Cas stood tall and stiff as a soldier as if he were perfectly unaffected. The split second when Dean saw Cas’s lip shake before his jaw clenched in determination to stay in control. The tremor in the way he heard Cas call out his name as he ran out.
Cas’s eyes were impossibly brighter when paired with that bit of happiness, and Dean nearly missed the beginning of his sentence with the intensity of his distraction.
Cas was facing the wall of the gym, back to the booth and the growing crowd. The chatter of the students was easier to ignore this way, and Gilda much easier to hear. When Gilda finished up, and all that Cas needed to do was close the glitter containers, she smiled wide and set to hanging it above the booth.
Dean's favorite parts of the picture were Cas's smile and his hands around the cup. His fingernails were painted; some done much better than others. Days before, Castiel had painted them a cobalt blue while they sat on the ground outside the car. It was evident to Dean which fingers of Cas's he had tried to paint, especially next to Castiel's precision. Castiel offered to paint Dean's too, but Dean just shrugged it off. That just happened to be one of those societal hangups that Cas could toss aside while Dean managed to be paralyzed underneath its weight.
Gravity played its part in the universe’s carefully choreographed long con, and Cas slid right into the waiting mattress depression, firmly wedging his thigh against Dean’s.
"C'mon, angel boy, tell me more." One of the other girls (Ruby, if Cas's memory served him correctly) had quickly taken to the nickname after stumbling clumsily over Castiel's name in full. He didn't love the moniker, but he did hold a base appreciation for anyone who knew the origin of his name without asking.
When Castiel tossed the conversation to the wind, and instead threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair and met their lips in a searing kiss, the earlier promise of breakfast was dropped in favor of each other and falling into bed again.
“So do. Um. Do you… I… Sorry, I don’t know how to… Angel.” Dean stuttered through a few segues; the number of questions still rattling around was overwhelming. “If you’re an angel, why are you trying to kick me out of the house? What happened to helpin’ out a good believer when there’s no room in the inn? And why are you… dressed like that? No corporate drone suit?”
“Fine. But only if you go put on some underwear.” Cas turned on his heel and retreated down the hall to his room, Dean hoped to change out of those clothes that probably smelled like whatever this dude’s name was.
to ignore the simple fact that Dean Winchester was likely engaged in some sexual encounter mere feet away, but God, was it difficult to put that thought aside.)
“Well, then, what about when we were casing the neighborhood? You grabbed my elbow and pulled me into that plant store and insisted on looking at all the damn
"I feel like a card dealer," Dean remarked as he started pulling out their meal, doling out one of each item to himself and Castiel. They began with a sparkling grape juice that Dean had picked days ago for Cas and, for that, endured a few days of teasing from Bobby when it was spotted in the kitchen. The blue solo cups that Dean had brought along as glassware weren't very picturesque, but Dean couldn't help but pull out his phone and take a picture of Castiel as he sat on that blanket.
He sighed, hoping it sounded more annoyed than longing. “Not really, it’s. Divination, more. Like asking for the answers and trying to read them.” Cas explained, slightly distracted as he’d explained this to Dean already, and he was looking for something on the table. “So, do you want to do this or not?”
And honestly, was that so crazy to think? Dean felt like he was holding a huge flashing sign that told everyone in the vicinity that he had a secret. Everything was exhausting. From the moment Dean walked onto the school campus, he knew that the summer had changed him. The first conversation he was swept up into was crude and immature, nothing like the hours spent with Cas, meandering through topic after topic, debating and postulating while Dean held onto Cas's hand for guidance. He
expect to see Dean sitting on top of a desk in the front row, a few boys surrounding him as if Dean were holding mass. The boys laughed loudly, joking and surely catching up on their summers. The first thing Castiel could overhear was one of the tallest boys poking fun at Dean's freckles.
Cas raised a single eyebrow at Dean, seeming to read between the lines like he always does. Wasting no time with further questioning, Castiel leaned up and pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it to the side, shrugging in a way that would appear casual and unaffected if not for the heat in his stare. “Would you like to check?”
It was entirely normal for him to have spent the day picturing the future with his best friend, fantasizing over the possibility of domesticity, Castiel bringing him a cup of coffee and cozying right back up next to him in the too-small interview room.
Dean sat down, and immediately Cas turned to stretch his legs out across Dean’s lap, resting them there and still wearing that damn smirk. “Yes. And so, the wax. What do you want to know? How much I like how it feels on my skin? Where I like to feel it most? Or do you want to know how I look spread out on the bed, maybe even tied down, or what I sound like when I’m begging for more?”
Dean rolled his eyes but agreed to the compromise; there was very little he wouldn't agree to for this boy. Once Castiel nodded back, content, Dean pulled out the "salad" he had made. Any salad recipe would typically be avoided, but Dean may rethink his positioning on the topic if his recipe would qualify as a salad. He had balled a watermelon, tossing it into a bowl with mozzarella pearls and a bit of basil. He even threw in some cucumber and tomato, hoping Cas would like the additions.
God, the conviction Cas could put into that question, like he didn’t know the answer already like he wasn’t just prying for a specific response.
Dean huffed out a laugh. "It actually did." He looked down at his hand where he still gripped the camera; the display had timed out to black by now. "Thank you. Again. Um. For the picture." Dean seemed to be preparing to go, to end the moment they were sitting in, and Castiel didn't want that. He didn't think Dean did either, based on the slow way he spoke, eyes searching Castiel's expressions for something else.
Dean gasped at the sudden touch, pulling slightly at the grip on his arms out of a need to grab Cas by the hair. He didn’t exactly want to, but he was pretty sure he couldn’t move his arms even if he tried and that sent heat spreading through his spine. Dean could just lay there, gasping out little moans as Cas laved attention over his chest, his shoulders, his neck, leaving a thread of dark bruises in his wake.
Castiel wasn’t a real photographer, he reminded himself, but god did he wish he had his camera right now. Not that he’d be able to use any of those pictures for his school project.
Cas had early into the job made the mistake of asking what car Dean would prefer, and the man launched into what could only be perceived as a sales pitch for his 1967 Chevy Impala named Baby who was currently in storage back in Kansas. Dean had restored the car from near death, and it was in stellar condition. Dean’s presentation would not have been complete without pictures of the car from every angle, even a shot of the man leaning against her hood, a beaming grin on his face. Castiel remembers thinking he’d never felt as proud of anything he’d done as Dean looked in front of that car.
straddling him. The blade to the throat though? Dean had to take full responsibility for any thoughts formed from that.
Cas let out a small breathy chuckle and then moved back those extra few inches to press himself against Dean’s erection. “Seems like you are as well,
"I don't usually drink." Castiel shifted his weight back and forth, a little nervously, and Dean immediately regretted making him uncomfortable. Glancing over his shoulder, Castiel kept looking back at his beach blanket almost longingly.
“Nah, then. Just angels. No ghosts.” Dean flirted, his own arms reaching up to wrap around Castiel’s neck.
Cas was just looking at their hands, his face entirely blissed-out, chest flushed with arousal, but still the most tender look on his face. Dean thought he was going to melt away with the intensity of just how much he felt. Dean moved his attention to Castiel’s hip, ignoring the half-hearted protests, instead basking in the warmth he felt spreading from his fingers where they were between Cas’s own. Dean’s thumb brushed carefully across the back of Castiel’s hand, the chaste touch a clear contradiction to the way Dean seemed to be intent on torturing Castiel with teasing sensations. Dean used his free hand to trace up and down Castiel’s body, just nearly touching his cock each time his hand moved past.
Before Cas lost all his light, he wanted to finish up with his English work from class, so he curled up into the corner and buried his face into the work. The space around him was nearly silent. The only audible sounds were the faint tapping of steps reverberating through the ceiling from the floor above, but it was not enough to distract Castiel from his diligent notes on argument styles. After growing up with his family, he was pretty sure he didn't need to further study the art of the argument, but he was nothing if not studious.
and the corridors were maze-like at best, but the students figured it out well enough by the end of their first few weeks. Seniors like Castiel were well versed enough that he could get from his dorm room to his secret hallway with his eyes closed. It was a Friday, and classes finished a few hours ago, so Cas made the trip easily, assuming that the rest of the students were grouped up in the common rooms or signed out to take advantage of the extended curfew.
Castiel pretended not to notice the way Dean dropped his hand and stiffened as they pulled into the town surrounding their school. He also pretended he didn’t notice when Dean parked in a far corner of the student lot, a full empty row of spots between his Impala and any other vehicle. Finally, he pretended it didn’t hurt when Dean walked three long strides ahead of him on their way back to the dorms, and again when Dean ran off with one of his friends from football without so much as a wave over his shoulder.
Cas pouted, the look on his face one that Dean has fallen for many times. Cas is never as unaware as he looks, and it took Dean an embarrassingly long time in their friendship to realize that. His lack of innocence still surprised him, clearly, based on the near heart attack that was caused by a single drop of wax on his friend’s back.
Dean flipped through his internal Rolodex of excuses, but when he poked his tongue out to wet his lips before he spoke, he noticed Castiel’s eyes dart down to watch the movement, the blue narrowing as his gaze darkened. Jackpot. Instead of hopping to his own defense, Dean deliberately looked the man up and down, suppressing the laugh he felt rise up at the sight of fuzzy yellow socks covering his feet, any last bit of lasting suspicion that he could be in any sort of immediate danger suddenly dissipated. “Well, I’d bet the majority of veterinarians would call the cops on the strange shirtless robber, but I’m pretty sure you fixed me right up and wasted no time turnin’ on the charm.”
the angel; he was just pissed and thought it was the angelic equivalent of, like, a drunken right hook.
“What, you’re gonna punch the ghost with your big strong arms? Is that your move?” Cas pouted and shoved lightly back at Dean, letting his hands linger with his fingers spread across Dean’s upper arm. He barely noticed he was essentially feeling up his best friend, pretty blatantly.
looks great. See?" He stepped forward until he was next to Dean, holding out the camera for him to see as well. They were shoulder to shoulder then, the camera held between them.
It seemed that Dean realized what he said then as well, the way he tensed up into himself caused his grip on the plate to falter just a bit, jostling the ashes and nearly flattening the shape. Castiel smiled to hide the spike of longing and joked to ease Dean. “Don’t worry, looks like something else now. You won’t be trapped with me forever.”
Dean smiled, the expression dripping with manufactured sweetness. “What’s the gun for, hm?” He flashed his eyes down to the barrel of the weapon and back up to meet those stupidly pretty blue eyes. The man broke eye contact and looked around the room for a second, surely locating the shotgun (about four feet from Dean’s left shoulder) and the knife (eight feet to the right from Dean’s feet).
The thought forced Cas to take a sharp breath before continuing. "It happened so fast, and then it just ended, and I was supposed to be moving, and apparently there was no point to try anymore but…. I wanted to. I just…. I had never felt like I could fly before. Not until then. I didn't want to let it go."
What did Cas gain from leaning in and straightening Dean’s tie while they were on the way into the morgue, and why’d that woman have to coo at them like they were infants, not grown adult men preening each other in public?
The boy took his phone back but couldn't immediately put it away. He lost a few moments staring at the screen, wondering what chance they could have stood if Dean hadn't burned that bridge.
Dean let the silence hang, wanting Cas to finish if he could. When it lingered just an extra moment, Dean leaned down, bending his neck to plant a soft kiss on Castiel’s lips. “It’ll be fine, Cas, we’ll make time. We can have a code word. For if you need to talk to me or want to get away for a minute. It’ll be our little secret, that’s romantic, right?”
As if reading Castiel’s mind the way only Dean can, he reached up and threaded his fingers through Cas’s hair, holding him in place. “Yes,” Dean breathed the words impossibly soft, the noise barely reaching Castiel’s ears as permission. His other arm snaked around Cas’s waist. Castiel’s teeth scraped at the sensitive skin on Dean’s neck, his tongue following to soothe the scratch or tease or both. Dean let his head tilt to the side, granting more access, hoping Cas would take the hint and give him what he wanted; Castiel instead opted to skim his lips over the surface of Dean’s skin, just barely ghosting contact, not nearly enough to do more than raise anticipation and goosebumps.
stranger, too. He looked Dean's age, but he dressed like he had a doubleheader with a job interview.
Dean continued rocking his hips up into Castiel, breaking the kiss to throw his head back against the pillow when Cas joined in. Castiel’s body enveloped his own, arms wrapped around Dean’s back and his lips finding purchase on Dean’s exposed neck. Both of the men were moving together, hips bucking, chests heaving with the effort to pull air from the thick atmosphere around them. Dean bit back an especially loud moan, turning to hide his face in the pillow, but Castiel caught on and grabbed hold of his hair to keep him from muffling his pleasure.
interested in the fair; he had just been wary of being the only senior walking around alone. This would solve that, and Castiel
Castiel’s lips twitched again into his little ghost of a smile, walking towards Dean in a sure way that left no room for nerves. “Ariel really does not like being called that. Makes sense that the human who stabbed him would have been a Winchester. He’d been… unwilling to tell the whole story.”
Dean felt his breath catch in his throat but spotted no sign of Cas noticing how he was affected by the simple contact.
Dean's absolute lack of awareness when it came to his surroundings had a significant amount of influence over the ability to avoid him. If Dean took one single over-the-shoulder look during first period… Castiel isn't sure what he would do if he were spotted. It was likely that there'd been more close calls than Castiel was even aware of with the small class.
Summers were Dean's time, some of the only times he had no responsibilities, and this season would technically be his last. Dean had always spent summers away from his dad (or - more accurately, his father spent summers away from him), and this year, his kid brother Sam was being shipped off to some Gifted Kid Debate Camp bullshit. Everyone he knew from school seemed to be on vacation or working, but Dean was more than prepared for a quiet summer before his senior year.
He moved with such purpose and conviction that Dean thought for a moment Cas was reaching for his hand, but before he could panic at the thought, Cas was flipping over his mug as well and indicating to the coffee again.
Neither of them knew exactly how it happened, but Castiel ended up underneath Dean on his chair again, Dean straddling his hips with his patented sly grin. Castiel could see the small bruise he left on Dean’s neck, and the sight made him laugh.
he could explain. He wasn't ready… if he had been, there'd be no way Dean would have sent Castiel away like that. Dean felt his throat burn at the thought, but he pushed it out quickly.
He was met with a familiar look, Confused Castiel ™, head tilt and eye squint included. Dean felt a rush of warmth towards Cas and his unconventional but somehow entirely readable expressions. Trying to freeze out the heat settling in his stomach was fruitless, especially with Cas so close and so seemingly clueless as to his effects, but it didn’t prevent him from trying.
The man perched above Dean regarded the gun, his bottom lip poking out in a slight pout. Again, Dean kicked himself. Not cute. Dangerous. Stranger with a gun.
“C’mon Cas, and make you drive back alone? All these girls mean nothing, as long as you know who I come home to.” Dean had responded with his usual flirting, punctuating with a wink. “I don’t let just anyone in on the full Dean Winchester experience.” Castiel felt a wistfulness, a quick flare of hope that Dean meant the words despite the ridiculousness, but he knew Dean’s ways and he immediately pushed it back down.
Now, standing in the doorway of a motel room, another man’s hand down his pants, Dean didn’t have the distractions he needed to rationalize this.
drunk. I do, and I hate that dry bullshit, and since I can’t have the whiskey-“ Castiel shot him a look that told him to drop the whiskey from the conversation. “Since we have to bring
arms wrapped around him. Unfortunately, can’t judge a book. Sometimes the cover shows you a friggin’ Girl Scout, but then the pages are straight from hell, and Dean really meant Hell, in a very literal, nonmetaphorical way.
Dean shrugged, picking up the metaphorical shovel and getting back to work at the hole he started digging when he fuckin’ chose this specific house to crash in to begin with.
"Do you come here often?" Castiel spoke, half a beat between the question and his catch of the flirtatious cliche. "I mean, um, I'm sor-"
“Cas, man, that waitress asked our damn anniversary because you asked her to get me coffee too when I forgot to flip my mug.”
Dean came down from his orgasm, immediately turning the full focus on Cas. He reached down between them, grabbing their cocks where they still slid together, now messy with Dean’s release. Dean was sensitive, but he didn’t care, he wanted this for Cas, wanted to see Cas like this so he could remember it forever. He didn’t tease, but he didn’t rush, just steadily stroked Cas and himself, his hips twitching slightly at the contact. He was content staying here forever, just making Castiel spill the prettiest noises, pull the prettiest faces.
Maybe he liked being alone because he didn't feel like he was pretending at all; there was no need to install that airtight filter on himself, no need to conceal anything.
“I’m so,” The man cut himself off with a raspy groan, stuttering when he continued. “S-so close.” Again, the creaking sped, & Dean heard the loudest noise yet from next door, the man calling out during his release while his partner slowly worked him through it. Still, no word from the silent half of the pair. Dean was grateful for that, he could hear the additional soft whines & whimpers as the man came down from his orgasm, & it was the thought of being the one responsible for those sated noises that pushed him over the edge of his own orgasm.
Years of this back and forth teasing, the will-they-won’t-they that he’s always felt from Cas, unsure if it was mutual because having Cas
. Cas didn’t seem to notice his nerves, just moved impossibly closer, until he was about half an inch from sitting on Dean’s lap, his legs still tossed over Dean’s, just… more so. Enticingly more so. The movement had knocked Dean’s hand free from its post between Cas’s thighs, but now Cas was right
Dean smiled, his cheeks turning pink, nearly imperceptible under the candlelight. “What’d that one mean?”
The boy on the blanket shuffled around until he was seated again and opened his mouth in response. Or, at least he seemed to think about responding. Then the boy was moving again, shifting up onto his knees and then hopping upright. For perhaps the dozenth time, Dean found himself wondering what type of person wore
“Yes, I am an angel of the lord,” the angel repeated, his earlier formal tone seeping back through. It made Dean smile.
. Dean threw caution to the wind and slipped a leg between Castiel's calves, pushing through his anxiety to kiss the boy yet again.
His parents took his genuine shock as a positive sign and ushered him in for an awkward hug of sorts. He managed a small smile and nodded at his parents reassuringly.
This was the third day in a row he was waking up here. The first morning he had awoken here, he spent his first ten minutes of consciousness willing his breath to slow and his heart rate to go down. The second, it only took him five minutes to wipe the shock off of his face. He just couldn’t believe this was real. This time, he was glad when he didn’t feel the immediate panic set in, and he told himself it had nothing to do with the way that Dean’s hand was resting on his hip (his bare hip, he reminded himself- as if he could forget) and he could feel how warm and soft and big Dean’s hand was. It anchored him and felt too right too soon and that was a little scary, but Castiel pushed the thoughts of later away for the thoughts of now.  Dean was still asleep, and that meant Castiel could watch him without the faked indignity from the other boy.
This wasn’t out of the ordinary, Dean bringing a girl out with him from the club. In fact, Castiel sort of expected it when they went out on nights like this, he suspected the company was more the goal of the evening than the drinking and dancing were. Castiel already activated the privacy partition, and it clicked into place as Dean held open the door for the petite brunette. Dean walked around to the other side, slipping into the seat with heavy limbs that Castiel recognized as tipsy Dean’s.
Cas felt panic rise up as he walked, but it didn't seem that Dean had noticed him, so he just shuffled in towards the opposite back corner of the room. From his desk, Castiel was glad he couldn't hear any specific voices out of the chorus filling the room. Just looking at Dean, it was evident that he was different here. Everything from the way he stood to the way he gestured while he talked was in contrast to the gentle person who had held Castiel's hands, pressed soft kisses against his lips, shared his patience and kindness all summer. This Dean he saw
Dean took a deep breath, the exasperation dripping off of him so thick that not even Castiel could ignore it.
“Honey, I’m home,” Cas called to Dean in jest as he pulled off his coat and hung it in the hall closet. “What are you up to?”
Dean pulled up to a stoplight, his left hand tapping furiously on his knee, right arm stick-straight where it rested on the wheel as a makeshift and entirely ineffective barrier between him and Cas. He ignored the way the angel next to him was clearly trying to get his attention, pointedly glancing between the cross street in front of them and the unblinking, unactivated turn signal on the dashboard. The way his eyes widened was entirely comical in Dean’s peripheral as if to shout for attention with just a glance, but Dean refused Castiel the satisfaction of seeing the smile he instead forced down.
They worked together to lay out the blanket Dean brought, pressing the corners flat and talking mindlessly. Once it was settled, Cas made a wild reach for the lid of the cooler, his intentions to sneak a peek violently clear to Dean.
. Dean found he didn’t mind too much, since it was a true smile that bent the angel’s lips up and exposed his teeth and shocked Dean with its purity. “Before this body, I had not been on earth since before the moving picture was invented.”
If that was their domestic, then hell. Bring it on and give Dean perfectly cream-and-sugared police station coffee delivered by his best friend every single day.
Once Castiel retrieved his schedule, the group's conversation drifted towards discussion of their afternoon classes, and Cas was glad to find out he'd have one more class with Meg in the afternoon.
Cas swept his eyes across the room. Everyone was glued to their seats, eyes pinned to the confrontation unfolding.
A quick little buzz against Dean’s hip where his phone was tucked into his pocket shook him out of his thoughts. He pulled his phone out, wincing at the text notification.
“Hm, don’t get cocky with me,” Dean reached around Cas to the fabric of his shorts, pulled taut over his thighs with the extra strain. Just a little tug right there…
He tossed his body over Castiel’s, sailing over the last few inches, his hands seeking purchase, his face finding refuge in the crook of Cas’s neck.
was that Dean was alone. He had gone on solo hunts before, mostly uneventful ones. His second hunt had seen him too close for comfort with a really peeved succubus, but he had gotten out mostly unscathed so far. Until tonight. He had been tracking a formerly runaway teen, currently freshly turned vamp. The uncontrollably bloodthirsty monster had escaped from its clan in a panic to feed, and when the group decided the fledgling was more trouble than she was worth, they stopped looking for her. At that point, she became a Winchester problem, the perfect low-stakes hunt for his father to send him off on as a practice run.
When Castiel spoke, Dean was absolutely positive that his voice had dipped somehow deeper. “I think I would like that, Dean.”
Not fifteen minutes later, Dean was parked and laughing at Cas's frantic guesses about what they were doing that day. Before he could move forward with his plans, he pulled Castiel closer and into a soft kiss, brushing his hand over the boy's cheek. With much regret, Dean pulled back and hopped out of the car. His abrupt exit was just the shock he needed to buy him a few extra seconds, and before Cas could join him outside, Dean was opening the passenger side door with a flourish.
“Fuck you mean?” Dean crossed his arms and threw his shoulders back. “Actually? Nearly? Jesus, dude.” He held back his flinch at his own blasphemy, if the angel was gonna be a dick, he could take a few Jesuses here and there.
The stranger’s eyes flickered through a few different expressions, each one as unreadable as the last. He settled on one, forehead creased, brows drawn in together with his lips pressed tight against themselves. He hummed quietly in contemplation. “I’m… Pointing it at you.” His voice was slightly unsure, and Dean kicked himself mentally for thinking the man was cute.
Cas looked over to the table and moved to rearrange a few things, making space in front of Dean. His hands felt weightier than he was used to, and Cas nearly fumbled and tipped a candle over, but the tiny candelabra just tottered on the surface, unsteady until Dean reached out and balanced the flame. Dean hid a laugh at Cas and the way his face was flushed pink from the alcohol and their closeness, and the way Cas’s brow was now furrowed as he worked carefully and at a snail’s pace, now afraid of knocking the candle again. When Cas was finished, it was his turn to catch Dean staring.
“There you go.” Cas was grateful his voice sounded normal now, he had managed to hold back the stuttering nerves he felt at the prospect of being this close to Dean, so far away from any interruptions.
Cas shook his head no. Unable to look Dean in the eye, he instead opted to pick a stray hair off the back of the shirt the boy had on. “You know they don’t like me, plus my brothers always end up comin’, and I don’t like all that roughhousing and pranks and stuff.”
"No, don't," Cas spoke more forcefully than intended, and Dean seemed to startle. However, his smile still didn't disappear despite the nerves Castiel could see subtly concealed beneath. Castiel thought Dean must have a lot of practice to hide himself as well as he did. "I mean," Castiel lowered his voice, ducking his head, "I'm sorry, I could help. What did you think when you picked this spot?" Cas took the camera from Dean's hand steadily, stepping far into the back corner with his back to the stained glass window.
The woman tucked her chin down towards her chest, coyly returning his flirtatious glance. Dean kept his eyes on her, downing the shot quickly. In one practiced movement, Dean put the shot glass down on the bar and slid off the stool to saunter towards his target. He smirked as the girl waved off her friends just as he stepped up to face her. Her eyes were bright blue, and Dean again had to push away memories of being this close to Cas, and he pretended not to notice how
Castiel spent the last few days of his summer sulking around the small cabin his parents had rented for the past few months. It was his last night there, all his things packed, and he was ready to move on as he always was.
After all, the positives greatly outweighed any need for a regular sleep schedule, and he didn’t exactly have a bustling social life. Castiel had worked for a private firm for a while, specializing in personal security as well as chauffeuring, but after driving Dean Winchester just once, the man had somehow tracked down Castiel’s information to hire him personally.
Through the ringing that echoed in his ears, residual from the wash of cold, frozen sickness that had him held in place since Dean had shown up, he heard Charlie's voice cut in, eager and determined.
Dean assumed human constructs like personal space bubbles did not apply to the heavenly host, which made enough sense to him. “Yes, I am your contact, and yes, I am an angel, and the problem with your sigil is that those top lines should be curved, a bit like a trident. You’re not going to Hell for the blasphemy, stabbing Ariel, or for… Your other. Thoughts.”
"Wait, so where did he go? Tell me more," Charlie cut the silence, knowing Dean was beyond lost in thought. Since she asked, Dean had to admit that he didn't know, hadn't asked the exact details of where Cas was headed since it hadn't mattered, or he hadn't
"Alright, spill the beans, dude." Of course, it was Charlie; who else could have broken into Baby, and who would be brave enough to call Dean out so directly? "What the hell is going on with you? Tell me more.
Cas's family was different than Dean's, though. They were not traditional by any means, their demanding jobs meant frequent moves and hours put into work, but they were loving and attentive to their son. Even "
“Is Ghost one of those films you mentioned earlier?” Castiel’s question came as a slight shock, bringing Dean back into his body, suddenly all too aware that Castiel was holding both his hands, was pressed against his back, was breathing hot behind his ear.
Not for the first time, Dean wondered if this could be some monster-related and carefully plotted psychological attack, perfectly orchestrated to break him.
Still, regardless of which friends Dean was with, he wasn't opening up. He didn't see the point in mourning a relationship he hadn't let himself form. It was his fault, so he wasn't
it matter to him. He admitted how terrible he had treated Castiel, how he had ruined any chance of fixing it, and that he simply needed to move on.
They had been sipping their coffee when Dean noticed the wayward drop of coffee making a glacially paced journey off Cas’s bottom lip.
Dean still looked slightly skeptical, but he was watching Castiel in vague anticipation for what would happen next. When a few moments passed with nothing more than a few measured breaths and the friends’ usual staring, Dean huffed a quiet laugh, smiling at Castiel’s nervous demeanor.
"Hiya! Are you Castiel?" She asked the question in a way that made Cas feel oddly important, a hint of genuine excitement in her voice. When Cas confirmed that he was indeed, she lit up like a Christmas tree.
The next time they hung out, Dean wanted to make it right. He had started things with Cas as friends, and it progressed behind the scenes, without either of them fully aware until they were in the moment. Making out next to the pier wasn't typically Dean's first move, so he wanted to set the course right as much as possible, regardless of their limited time.
look on his face, the one he only ever seemed to direct at Dean, the one that the man now knew was filled with ocean’s deep desire to understand humanity in its basest level, love and confusion and interest and wonder and awe wrapped up into one expression. It always made Dean’s stomach flutter, but lately, it was more of a stampede. Castiel reached over and grabbed Dean’s hand, his thumb gently swiping over Dean’s wrist, above the callouses of his palm.
and Dean blushed at the thought of Bobby having seen him kicking splashes in the water and kissing Cas. It was clear that Bobby didn't care. He wouldn't be able to hide it if he did. The man wasn't exactly up for any local acting awards, and he sucked at poker. Dean had been beating him at Texas Hold 'em since the cards were bigger than his tiny freckled hands, and he couldn't shuffle a deck. No amount of gruffly spoken words could cover up the smile behind Bobby's eyes when he looked at Dean. He was the closest thing Dean had to a loving father, and he was nearly positive the man couldn't care less about anyone's sexuality long as he got a beer in his hand and his ass on the porch no later than 5 pm daily.
The two boys sat on Cas's blanket, backs against the side of Dean's car. They parked off a dirt road that had a nice view, and Cas was sitting mere inches away. Dean hadn't planned on talking through his past, but he was powerless around Cas. The boy simply nudged Dean's shoulder with his head, and suddenly, he was choking up while telling stories he had heard about his mom. Funny how things work sometimes.
“It smells weird in here, Cas,” Dean whined across the table at his best friend, something he’d been doing since they met years, nearly a decade before. Dean tended to complain, and Castiel had a wealth of experience getting Dean to give in and accept whatever it is he doesn’t want to do.
When Castiel found himself slightly nervous by the questioning, Meg seemed to swoop in and change the subject to Ruby. The girl was content to chatter on about her interests while Cas gave Meg a small smile in thanks.
Dean’s erection had flagged with the unexpected change of events & he was just about to head out to the couch to binge-watch a new Netflix series when he heard that same door opening & closing noise that had started this whole moment to begin with. This time, it was different though, as the next noise he heard was clearly & definitely a knock on his door.
Dean could play dumb, but unfortunately, the redhead knew him too well for that, so he just started talking. Once he began to tell the story, it began pouring out of him until he had been talking for the better part of an hour, and they were still in the student parking lot, now the only car left behind.
Somehow It felt as if he were being chastised by a partner for cheating, unsure why he wanted to assure Castiel so quickly that he was gay and ‘this chick’ is no threat to any interest Dean thinks he might spot behind those stupidly blue eyes. He didn’t even know her name. He just knew she was some hunter contact of Bobby’s and that they were grabbing a cup of coffee and discussing the case.
With a separation between life and work, certain emotions were off-limits while in the car. Castiel wasn’t jealous, he
“I know my brother, he doesn’t know shit about what pairs with what, Cas, let’s just bring ‘em some of this fancy aged shit. Expensive whiskey is always
Dean teased Cas for the face he pulled, but even he had scrunched his nose at the taste, which Castiel pointed out. Dean only stuck out his tongue in response.
Dean shrugged off his flannel, hissing a little as the movement pulled at the cut across his chest. He would poke around for some of the good drugs later, but a big swig from his flask would have to do for now. With a silent eulogy for the life of his favorite t-shirt, Dean used his pocket knife to finish it off. If anyone asked, Dean would deny it, but he contemplated keeping it despite the slash mark and the bloodstains, but he knew right now he preferred losing the shirt overstretching his arms over his head with the cut he was currently sporting.
The fair Charlie mentioned was advertised to the freshmen and occasionally a transfer student in their sophomore year, but Castiel was used to getting forgotten as he got older. He wasn't shocked that he hadn't heard of the fair, but he was finding himself unsure of why Charlie would be pressing the topic. Cas went still once he realized he had been bouncing his leg with nerves. He shrugged, but Charlie only seemed more determined.
behind Dean’s words, so he pressed the conversation further into Dean’s hands as he leaned back on the (more gray now than blue) faded couch the two of them had picked up from a Goodwill. “Alright, I’ll bite. What’s he look like, what’s his story?”
She immediately grabbed Castiel's hand, grinning wide. "How'd class go?" Charlie asked, and Castiel knew she was genuinely interested in his answer. He wasn't sure what he had done to have this stranger so willing to show him around, but he did like her so far.
That was enough permission for him. He teased Cas by tracing his tongue over the previous marks before he started nipping and sucking across the skin. Castiel made the prettiest noises. Dean wished he could see his face while kissing his neck, he could almost picture the way his eyes would look when they’re full of need, when he’s hard and pressing against Dean and his fingers are digging into Dean’s shoulders, holding on as Dean were to disappear if he let go. He didn’t care that Cas was going to be covered in these small bruises, Dean just needed to claim, whether that claim was valid or not didn’t matter. Plus, the gorgeous, sweet as nectar whines that kept falling from Cas’s lips while his hips were still moving in small circles over Dean were driving him insane with desire.
and the first time Dean saw it, he worried for a second that more people were coming. It was large enough to fit a small drinking party of teenagers, so it had been a little bit of a surprise when the boy laid down flat on his stomach across the middle of the blanket and pulled out a book. Even after seeing this routine three times prior, he was still just as fascinated by the behavior.
When Cas had first pointed them out over the summer, Dean's cheeks had flushed a pretty pink but still allowed Cas to count them. He had pressed a kiss to each one as he kept track before he became overwhelmed somewhere on Dean's cheeks and finally resigned to Dean's laughing requests for a "normal" kiss. Now, though, from across the room, Dean twisted his face into a scowl of an expression Cas had never seen on him. Dean shoved at the other boy's shoulder, and Cas sped his walk so he wouldn't be able to hear Dean's response.
More to drink, more of this girl, more distraction. His eyes shifted back towards the bar and Dean swore he saw Castiel across the room for a moment that lasted too long. The man stumbled and Dean knew it wasn’t Cas immediately, too far away to see his face or any identifying features, but his angel doesn’t move like that, would never make a mess of himself in a bar, too drunk to walk straight.
Dean, for one, was confused as to what about his coffee meeting had flipped off Castiel’s fight or flight, but he’d keep his eyes far away from that gift horse’s mouth. Or whatever the saying was. Idioms were significantly further down Dean’s list of priorities than anything else about the situation in front of him, from the blue-eyed drifter to the weapons said vagrant had stolen from him.
Castiel unlocked a door that read “Employees Only” and with a wink over his shoulder, the doctor ascended the stairs, Dean not far behind.
“G’mornin, sunshine,” Dean’s voice is sleep-heavy, graveled, and slow. If Castiel was honest, it was a mixture of the way that voice tugged on him and the pet name that caused him to break the short distance between them with a kiss. It was brief, but it felt easy and like they’d been doing this forever. Cas pulled away from the kiss just to nudge his way somehow even closer, tucking his face into the space where Dean’s neck met the pillow.
Dean checked the drawer in his tv stand, & when he rose to his feet with a pack of double a’s in his hand, two left in the package, Castiel was standing closer than he expected. He jumped back a little, but Cas shot an arm out to steady him. Dean felt the man’s grip on his bicep & his mouth went dry. At the physical contact, once Dean faced his initial reaction, he felt his usual easy confidence return. He could do this. He’s good at this, he’s Dean Winchester, goddamnit, and he does not swoon over mind-numbingly attractive men with who he’s spent much of the last two weeks with masturbating through a wall.
Dean shared a similar longing for his childhood, not for stability; he'd lived in the same home for his entire life, but instead for the presence of his mother. Dean hadn't talked about losing her with anyone but his younger brother, and even those talks had been coaxed out by a family therapist social services suggested. He laughed, thinking about the time and effort it took to get him to share back then when now all it took was a strange teenage accountant-looking boy with the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen.
When Dean returned to stand before the angel once more, he was holding a new bottle in hand. Castiel pretended not to notice him, visibly doubling his efforts to choose, brow furrowed, squint so intense Dean was surprised he could see anything at all. Cas kept up this charade, pursing his lips in concentration until Dean cleared his throat much louder than necessary. Castiel inhaled once, slowly, before looking up and meeting Dean’s gaze and finally acknowledging the new offering in the man’s hands.
The man’s partner was always so goddamned quiet, & on one hand, it made it easy to pretend he wasn’t there, but on the other, it annoyed Dean to no end. If he had his chance, he’d make sure this perfect man knew exactly what he was doing to Dean
this guy? Did the other angels think he was as weird as Dean did? Castiel’s eyes flicked towards him at that thought, and he was reminded his brain wasn’t private anymore.
He doubled over in a fit of gasped laughter, his shoulder tapping the horn and shocking them both, only serving to drag out the apparent hysterics. Dean couldn’t catch his breath enough to explain what had happened to Castiel, didn’t even know where to start in explaining his outburst. His mood had so dramatically shifted, he was sure he’d given himself and Castiel whiplash, but he couldn’t help it.
If anything, the strangely vulnerable position Cas sat in only served to further prove his power, looking just as holy sitting criss-cross on a motel bed as when his wings were out in their full glory.
Dean hugged Cas tighter, smiling at him. “Sure, Cas. You kinda came all over me, so a shower might help.”
Cas gave Dean a quick once over, stopping at his hands where they sat on the table, fiddling with a length of string he found there. “Dean, your ring.” Cas reached out and tapped the silver band, another veiled excuse to touch his friend, sliding the jewelry dish a bit closer to him as a silent offering.
"Lookin' good, girl!" And there he was, Dean Winchester. Or, Cas wished with every fiber of his being, it was somehow a completely different person doing an eerie impression of Dean and his coy, teasing voice. And this separate Not-Dean was flirting openly with Gilda, which was okay because this wasn't
It was Dean. In Castiel’s shirt. What is there to complain about? He smiled wide at the thought of Dean wearing his clothing back on campus, even if it was just to the dorms, even if nobody would know it was his but the two of them.
“I… Yeah. I think so. You got a minute while I look?” Dean immediately turned away from the man in his doorway to hide the blush he felt creeping into his cheeks as he walked deeper into the apartment to search.
“Is this one of the times you are asking one question when you mean to be asking another, or do you want to hear about my art?”
Not that Cas was planning on breaking the staring contest he seemed to be perpetually caught in with Dean. That woman could have entirely disappeared and at least one of the men wouldn’t have noticed, likely neither of them would.
Nothing else mattered, just Cas against Dean, Dean against Cas, the two of them in a freefall. Dean thought for a second that this felt a lot like flying, and maybe he wasn't so afraid of that after all.
This had simply never happened. Dean always checked the entire house, sometimes twice, laying sigils and protection spells and lines of salt as he went, and today was no exception. Sure, the place might have been a little strange, but it was foreclosed upon like a decade ago. Who knows who lived here and who’s been through since. Dean’s seen worse than a couple of weird murals on the walls in the places he’s crashed over the years; there were no signs of anyone having been there in a long time, and the rest really wasn’t out of the ordinary. So absolutely
Why in the world did Cas still look confused? More importantly, why hadn’t either of them moved away from their squished-together positions in the mattress dip?
He cleared his throat a little, and Dean still startled slightly, whipping around to face Castiel completely. Dean's uniform shirt was untucked, the top few buttons undone, clearly done with school for the day but, Castiel noticed, not dressed to go out, still carrying his school bags with a camera from photo lab slung over his shoulder.
Dean had settled into a night by himself at the apartment complete with an un-roommate-approved movie on DVD, a shit ton of cold beer, and freeballin’ it under a nice fluffy robe. He could sprawl out across the couch, a luxury he didn’t get to revel in often as a six-foot-something man with a roommate about the same size. Since he hadn’t heard from said roommate since the morning when he left for his
Cas was glad for the second shot and his nonexistent alcohol tolerance because the added bump of courage gave him his voice. “Za Nas,” he repeated the words, unable to look Dean in the eye. He averted his gaze to the bottle and busied himself with pouring out two more shots for later and screwing the cap back on. “It means ‘to us.’”
He blushed, not that he’d admit it, and something about the bashful expression made Castiel reach out and touch his arm.
Dean reached the wall opposite the stranger and leaned back, truly casual and no longer putting up a slight front. Castiel was still scowling at the shotgun, and when he held the position for a few extra seconds, Dean rethought the word scowling, as this man didn’t seem to inject any malice into his expression. Dean cleared his throat, and blue eyes shot to meet his.
Batteries? What would he need th- Dean bit his lip to hide his reaction. Batteries. For a sex toy. That's almost definitely currently laying on the bed that's just feet (and a wall) away from his own.
As the phone beeped to signal the call’s disconnect, Dean’s smile turned wistful. He missed his family back home, and as much as he and Sam avoided heartfelt moments, it was evident they had a special relationship. Castiel took advantage of the ability to really watch Dean now, as they had pulled up to the club around the time Dean had started to interrogate his brother, and he observed the careful way Dean wiped away the expression of reflection and replaced it with the patented Dean Confidence™.
“I don’t hide,” Cas scoffed, glad that the low light for the most part concealed his flushed cheeks. “I like it here, it’s quiet and a lot less sinister with the lights on.” Cas knew Dean heard the silent part, the
To wrap up his failed hookup, Dean fought off the girl, gained control of the knife, and managed to knock out his target. He got the girl back out to his car, into a deserted field, decapitated her, and burned the corpse. All this happened before he took stock of his injuries from his earlier scuffle. Once he peeled off his coat, he immediately felt the spiking pain of a deep slash across his chest. Something about seeing the blood always triggered the pain, the haze of adrenaline immediately replaced with the intensely clarifying need to clean-heal-rest.
Cas grinned at the prospect of dinner with Dean's family, Dean grumbled out an agreement, and as abruptly as he had appeared, Bobby left. Dean only waited for him to turn around before pulling Cas back in by the hand, a smile spread across his cheeks. When he held up his free hand for a fistbump, Cas just stared at him, evidently unsure what to do with the gesture and Dean's resulting exclamation of shock was loud enough that Bobby looked over his shoulder on his journey back off the pier.
Before the opening credits had even started rolling, Dean heard a key turning in the front door lock. The smile that immediately plastered itself across his face gave away Dean’s excitement when Cas walked in. The first thing Dean noticed was that Cas wasn’t wearing his clothes under that stupid jacket of his. The second thing was that Castiel’s hair was even more of a mess than normal. When Cas turned to face Dean fully, smiling right back at him, Dean could see the little bruises on his neck, more proof of what he had been up to, not that Dean needed the official, unavoidable evidence.
, in particular, especially doctors with gravel scratched sex voice and hair that made you want to thread your fingers through it. He tore his gaze away as Castiel washed his hands methodically, distracting himself with the cartoon scene painted on the wall across from him.
With Castiel’s legs resting across his thighs, he was just an inch or two away from brushing up against the tent forming in Dean’s sweats. Dean was screwed, he was in so deep and Cas was so close to him and
Dean laughed nervously, stepping back from Cas and scratching at the back of his neck. "Shit, am I that much of an asshole around here?" Before Castiel could jump in with a panicked denial or an honest take that it wasn't Dean so much as it was everyone he hung out with, Dean spoke again. "No. I think I realized it's actually really serious. And I should have asked, but you were so close, and you always smell like the library-"
Dean sped out of the allotted parking for the beach, not looking in his rearview once. He was familiar enough with goodbyes to know how to plan for them, but it wasn't working this time. He hadn't even peeked, but still, Dean conjured up images of Castiel's reflection, watching as he's left behind. Dean knew it was selfish to play martyr like this, to fall victim to his own sword instead of owning up to his feelings, but turning away hadn't felt so much like
Cas did things that Dean hadn't realized were even an option, and looking that deeply at his own hangups made him feel naked. Cas loved Top 40s Pop music, and he cried during movies without hiding his face at all; and he even painted his nails, and he seemed confused when Dean was slightly shocked by his openness about those things.
As the two of them stared extensively at the newest ash pile, Dean breathed out a laugh. “Ha, see there?” Dean pointed to one end of the pile. “Looks like you in the mornings when you sleepover and don’t wanna get up. Just a lump of blankets on the bed, cuz you’re pretending you can’t hear me waking you.” Cas’s cheeks burned at that, not only because he was being called out for his morning grumpiness, but because he wasn’t sure if Dean knew what he was doing to Cas by saying that.
“Oh stop it, maybe it’s saying you’re so good at laundry that you’ll have proposals to sort through. Maybe it’s even the
They pulled away reluctantly, Dean attempting to comb down Castiel’s mussed hair with his fingers, Cas straightening the dozen layers Dean always insisted on wearing. Before Dean could ask Castiel if he were ready to run through the rain, the downpour ended as quickly as it had started. When the world’s cheesiest, most chick-flicky rainbow popped up above Sam’s house as they approached it, Dean couldn’t help but stop Castiel for another kiss.
showed clear across his face because Cas smiled to reassure him, and motioned for him to get up as well. “Yeah, I have. Most of my ideas involve a bed, so…” Castiel tipped his head towards his room, and Dean wasn’t sure if he’d ever gotten up off the couch so quickly in his life.
Castiel's face fell from the look of amusement to one much less comforting to Dean. He looked confused, maybe shocked. Dean suddenly panicked that he was moving too quickly; obviously, the kissing didn't mean anything to Cas, maybe devastatingly smart and handsome boys who travel the country think it's entirely normal and platonic to hold hands and kiss and roll around in the sand together (and maybe even end up skinny dipping by the end of the night), that he was one in a string of left behind boys that Castiel collected.
. He still couldn’t move his hand, just petting over Castiel’s impossibly soft skin was enough to keep him occupied for an embarrassingly long time. “Seems like you did a pisspoor job of showering off your sins, you got any more of these on your back? Anywhere else?”
“Let’s try that again. Why are you in my house?” For all the fuss with the knife and now threatening with the gun, the man couldn’t look more nonchalant if he’d had a fuckin’ whiskey tumbler in hand. He wasn’t even out of breath and held a sparkle of defiance in his blue eyes, but he still didn’t look scared, or angry, or even that surprised at the situation that had unfolded.
Dean relaxed against the bed as much as he could, his legs falling slightly apart. His hands wandered up to grab Castiel’s hips and hold him in place.
The wide eyes and “sorry”s that always came after the initial assumption might even be the worst part, and this kid sure was leaning into the apologies.
Fair enough, Dean couldn’t argue with that. He responded with a shrug and a barely-there eyeroll. “Well, Mr. Professional Sigil-ist, do you want to show me how it’s done?”
Their last night in a town always included take-out from the family's favorite restaurant, so Castiel pulled a face when he emerged from his room for dinner. It looked like the table was set with leftover lasagna and a hodgepodge salad. Definitely not the ribs from The Roadhouse they had all agreed on yesterday. He looked up at his dad, mouth open to launch a rare Castiel V. Parents match, but the words caught in his throat at the genuine happiness he saw on his father's face.
“If you were to shoot me,” Castiel started, his tone fond in a way that made Dean’s stomach flutter. What sort of seduction was this? “I would still feel the bullets. They would still rip through the skin of my vessel. I would simply heal the wounds afterwards.”
“All set,” Castiel spoke with a soft tap to Dean’s shoulder, again stepping away to wash his hands at the small sink on the counter. Dean was still frozen in place by the absurdity of this all. What now? Did Dean tip the man? Ask him out?
Dean’s gaze hardened and he raised an eyebrow in challenge to Cas. “You wanna talk oblivious? It took you a quarter of a bottle of vodka to get it through your head that I’ve been flirting with you for years, and even then I had to do all the work myself.” He thought for a second. “Well, I had help from all your magic I guess. Witch boy.”
Castiel hadn't been in any situations that had felt so similar to life or death as the overlapping circumstances, but he was relatively sure that things were supposed to slow down. Castiel instead felt that everything happened simultaneously, events unfolding in such rapid succession that there was no time to take a single breath. Dean was there, he was panicking, the glitter was hitting the floor, and he was covered and the world was spinning so fast Cas could feel it and Dean was still there, still talking, still so close.
On any occasion, Dean had found himself with his hand on Cas’s, and he was always just as taken aback and just as tempted to take hold and never let go.
In their third week together, Dean was the one to break down that final wall remaining between them. They lay on the blanket, a spent pipe down by their feet. They had been talking for hours, nearly all day, and by now, the sun had gone down. They had been inching closer and closer with each shared joke, each new story they told. The shared bowl they passed back and forth assisted the process, the wind giving the boys a perfect excuse to huddle in close, tenting the lighter with cupped hands as they took hits.
"We met on the beach and swam and sat under the sun and went out on a boat and had a picnic and stargazed and we went for drives and kissed in the sand." Cas felt the emotions he had poorly shoved down start to bubble up, recalling their summer nights had the boy wishing for things he knew he couldn't have. "But then it was over. Like nothing even happened."
Scratch that - as soon as Dean’s next cartoonish quip popped into his head, the man against the wall slipped a foot between his, hooking around Dean’s ankle and pulling hard to the right. Dean barely had time to grapple against the move before he felt a quick elbow jab to his side that sent the knife clattering across the floor and sent the room lurching within Dean’s view. The intruder turned self-proclaimed-homeowner was apparently stronger than he looked, and frankly kinda kicked ass, but Dean has fought way worse than some scrappy hot guy.
Cas just smiled serenely, that smug bastard, and he moved yet again, this time pulling his legs off of Dean’s. The break in contact was brief, as Cas was soon pulling at Dean on the couch, maneuvering him so there was room to sit between his legs, back to Dean’s chest. He sat at the edge of the couch, so he wasn’t exactly ass-to-crotch, but he was fucking close. Close enough that Dean could feel the heat emanating off his body. “Anything still back there?” Cas asked sweetly.
Dean had ended the game after the rules called for him to take a drink straight from the bottle, deciding to end on a high note. (The high note was the way that Castiel laughed with his whole being the entire time Dean held the bottle out in front of him, contemplating the task ahead of him with an exaggerated pout, likely trying to find a loophole in the rules to make Cas join in.)
Normal things like kissing on the way to dinner parties were finally Dean’s reality. Sam had put a downpayment down on a
“Dean, you have to stop touching everything. Just pick one, whatever you want.” Castiel didn’t seem to hold back any of the venom from biting into his words, and the intended sting found its mark. Sometimes they argued until the most casual of words became so harsh they felt more like fists being thrown, and Dean was not one to let someone get the last hit, proverbial or not.
Dean slid one hand up the leg closest to him, his fingers curling to rest on Cas’s thigh, at the hem of his shorts and wow, Dean never realized just how short these shorts were or how soft Castiel’s skin was, but fuck he could feel the muscle, he could tell he was strong. “Sure, we could start there, I always thought I’d kiss ya before you asked me to scene with you, but I guess I’m not one for convention,” Dean smirked, going for nonchalant, but he couldn’t keep his fingers from drifting over Cas’s skin, and he couldn’t keep his brain off the fact that he was sitting, calmly, with his hand. between. Castiel’s. legs. Cas, who was just looking curiously at Dean, a small smile on his face that Dean couldn’t quite decipher.
His newfound understanding of a hypothetical question was one of Dean’s favorites, up there with the exaggerated eye roll. The man squinted at Dean in that familiar way, and Dean felt his stomach jump.
“Please, let me hear you, Dean, please,” Cas pleaded, letting out his own desperate groans as he focused on the feeling of Dean’s body against his. Dean’s mouth fell open in a whimper when Cas tugged on his hair again, and Cas’s movements became more erratic, Dean doing what he could to meet Castiel’s thrusts by raising off the bed, but everything was
“Yes, I did the walls here. So many buildings are left to rot and to collect dust, I wanted to add some beauty. I assume antiquated religious art doesn’t add much to the value, but I find that I do not care how much the bank makes on this place. I needed to practice, and this house had the wall space.” The man thought for an extra moment before adding in, “And the lighting. That was crucial.”
Plus, it didn't hurt that Meg and Ruby were in the art class he was taking before gym. The two girls spent most of the period seemingly set on interviewing Castiel about his life while they sketched. He hadn't talked to anyone like this since Dean, and before that, he wasn't sure he had ever opened up that much.
Dean would have protested changing out of his robe, but he wanted some ground to stand on in case Cas came back in those damn clothes and not his own. If Cas can make wardrobe requests so can he, it’s only fair. Plus, he thought it
At least the worker is just as thrilled to be there as the customers. The exhausted voice of whatever poor shmuck ended up with the night shift wasn’t exactly the best of check-in amenities, but Dean hadn’t seen as much as a single chocolate on his pillowcase in years, so it would have to do.
was he impossibly close), now this feeling was earthshattering, the impact something akin to a rocket launcher against concrete, a chemical bomb thrown across the room. Years of his willpower were acting as the door and Cas felt like a battering ram in front of him.
Cas hadn’t known who the man was until he had googled him after receiving the initial assignment. Dean was a musician, and judging off of the millions of search hits, a quite successful one. Ever the professional, and quite good at his job, Castiel always made sure he knew who he was picking up. A few internet searches, a couple of lines dropped to business contacts that might have experience with the client, just the basic research he thought necessary to be courteous, professional, and aware. Castiel wasn’t one for pop culture, those close to him were used to explaining references and name drops all the time. He supposed it made him good at the professionalism aspect of driving high-profile celebrities, but it did hinder his ability to relate to his peers. It wasn’t the first time that Castiel had found one of his traits more suited for the workplace than his personal relationships.
" Cas had started. Dean didn't hear the rest of the sentence. Cas knew his parents loved him, no questions asked; it was just a given. It instilled a deep ache in Dean's heart.
Rarely, the local beach was host to a few families scattered across the shoreline, even less often, a group or two of kids from the high school. No lifeguards, no snack shack, no vacation rentals, and so it stayed relatively quiet. Perks of a small town, Dean assumed. Not that he had been much elsewhere. Besides, he liked it there, liked his friends, liked his car, and tolerated school. Sure, it could get a little bit monotonous, but Dean also knew where to find a good time. Mostly there, on the beach, with some good music and a beer.
He sped through the work he had been given that night and went to sleep early when he was unable to shake the waking thoughts of Dean. Senior year was going to kill him.
It didn’t have to mean more. It could just be how they are. Their relationship wasn’t exactly by the book to begin with; who cares if a tiny town John Doe thought he and Cas were bumpin’ uglies on the side.
The kid stopped right there with his eyes glued to the window. He seemed oblivious to Castiel's presence, instead thoroughly taken by the mosaic in front of him. It was evident even from just a silhouette that the boy was Dean, another student in his year. The two didn't cross paths often, which led to them never having had an entire conversation despite having known each other for nearly four years. Castiel wasn't sure Dean remembered his name. Castiel squeezed his eyes shut with the realization that he'd have to speak up; waiting for Dean to see him would likely be more shocking than an announcement that he was here.
The teacher clapped once and started class. "Alright, Mr. Winchester and friends, would you like to share your disruption with the group?"
Dean ignored the way the teenager’s entire arm shook as he held out the room keys, one at a time, to each of them separately. Dunno what gave the kid the right to be so affected; Dean was the one who had been called gay. Not that there was… anything wrong with that.
Dean knew he slept comically light while he was out hunting alone, so he didn’t feel too bad when he chose to skip over a few of the walls when it came to sigil-time. The previous owners of the house must have been religious fundamentalists or something, based on the art covering the walls. The paintings that had been done were the brightest thing about the (otherwise empty) home, and Dean thought a couple freaky angel murals might actually do some good for keeping out the less than human. He had just finished a devil’s trap in chalk on the floorboards in front of the ground floor window and was standing up when he heard those footsteps.
Dean’s entire existence was the point of contact between him and Castiel. His other hand reached blindly back, finding the angel’s and grasping for purchase beyond any reasonable explanation.
Castiel was still so close to him. Now that Dean knew who he was faced with, he was annoyed that he hadn’t sensed something before. Even now, from two feet away, Dean could feel a tension in the air, a new gravity that pulled Dean closer. How’d he miss that before? It wasn’t anything he’d heard before, but angel lore is real rare, and he honestly hadn’t heard much. Probably why his sigil was wrong.
Cas hadn't expected it to hurt that much; he knew he was leaving in a few days, he knew he needed to get ready for the movers to swoop in, but he could barely leave his room. He was glad his parents were busy, or they would have something to say about his moping. Castiel hadn't left himself many options when it came to leaving the house; all of the spots he had been all summer belonged to Dean.
“Oh, stop it, if that’s true, you only can blame yourself. When has any girl ever turned you down? Future you must not be asking.” Castiel blocked the elbow Dean sent towards him, avoiding a nudge to the side and instead grabbing Dean’s bicep for a second to stop him. Cas dropped his hands away like he was burned when Dean smirked and flexed. He should be used to Dean’s showboating, but something about the low light, or their proximity, or the fact that they were nearly a mile from the nearest person... Cas was struggling to hide his crush, stupid and unattainable as it was.
The room was small, likely shittier than the queen they’d been offered initially. Dean tossed his bag to the floor; Castiel walked around it, the tension released from his face. When Dean sat down on the bed nearest the door, the last place he thought Cas would choose to rest was directly next to him.
Castiel pulled the key out of Dean’s back pocket slowly, somehow not disturbing the receipt graveyard located there, and pressed it into Dean’s palm.
He kept their last kiss way too chaste, almost impersonal, and Dean could feel himself shoving down his emotions even as Castiel stood there in front of him, blue eyes swimming with emotion. When Dean pulled back, Castiel's forehead was knit together, holding his feelings in tight. Dean ignored the hurt in Castiel's expression as he said goodbye and rushed away to his car. He knew he was acting like an asshole, and so suddenly, especially after the beautiful summer he had just had. Even if Cas wasn't going to be states from here in a week, it's not like Dean was precisely out of the closet. Small towns (and his father) could be cruel, and he'd never had any reason to risk it. Everything ends.
Dean hopped up at that point, partially to bend down and make direct eye contact with Cas, no longer too close and staring from a side-eye. His other motivation was escaping the intensifying heat where Castiel was leaned against him. Dean grunted and closed his eyes, spinning around and taking a few steps away from Cas. “Well, yeah, you’re doin’ it, so whatever
"Candids are in, no?" Castiel was glad he spoke before focusing on the image he captured. If he hadn't, he might have given away his thoughts of how beautiful Dean really looked. He nearly gasped; he really had primarily been joking when he raised the camera and snapped the picture so quickly. Castiel had just taken to the sight of Dean unguarded, the soft pout of his lips, the shadow of his eyelashes cutting in the dark through the cyan-tinted light brushed from his cheekbone and up to his forehead.
Dean knew if he dropped back into himself, he ran the rest of losing this moment to his brain and his internalized bullshit and his childhood and his father’s harsh words and everything else he usually grants control to. His other option was to stay in the moment.
Dean turned with his eyes wide. "I wasn't ready!" He frowned, but with a twinkle of mirth in his eyes that made Castiel grin back. Cas looked down at the camera, switching the camera to preview the last photo taken.
, & Dean was glad that he had decades of experience shutting up his younger brother with just a glance. They were, at that moment, sitting in Dean’s living room, in his new, solo, one-bedroom apartment. He called it his bachelor pad, mostly because of the way it made his brother scoff & roll his eyes. Sam was too simple to mess with, his exaggerated reactions too easy to goad and way too fun to bask in.
His smile grew with realization, and Charlie grinned, tapping her hands excitedly on the desk. She got Cas's number, they arranged where they'd meet, and Castiel turned his attention back to the front of the classroom in time for their teacher to call for attention.
He let his eyes fall shut as he leaned in to press his forehead against Dean's shoulder now, the same way the boy had rested after their kiss. He took a deep breath, taking a soft inhale through his nose before he leaned back to look Dean in the eye. "You smell like spearmint."
When Cas was able to meet Dean’s eyes again, he was greeted by a slightly dopey look of curiosity, like Castiel had done something incredibly fascinating. He blushed under the attention and the heat of the second shot settling into his limbs. Cas was hit like a freight train with the urge to kiss Dean, but the usual dose of guilt didn’t follow. He looked down at the table to distract himself. Dean was soundlessly tapping his fingers against the wooden surface. Cas wasn’t sure if Dean ever stayed still.
As soon as he couldn't hear them anymore, he shakily rose to his feet and turned around to face the booth, where Gilda, Jo, and Anna were quietly whispering about Charlie's weird exit. They went silent when they saw Cas, and he flushed bright red beneath the craft glitter. The embarrassment that was festering inside threatened to bubble up from where it sat dormant inside his stomach. Castiel had
“A toast,” Dean started, shaking the distant look from Cas’s stare, bringing his gaze back into the correct plane of existence. “To the future.”
He was used to looking for Cas everywhere, searching for him in crowds, but seeing him in every single face wasn’t part of the deal. He really had to pick the one girl in the bar with a mess of dark tresses and blue eyes. Sam would tease him for having a type. Cas wouldn’t notice, would probably smile his polite smile as Dean left with her, never knowing Dean wished it was him.
The one thing Dean hates more than someone else driving his car is when someone is backseat driving his car, which was exactly what Castiel had been doing since they pulled away from the small winery and set towards Sam and Eileen’s place. Dean was one smart-assed comment away from pulling over and giving Cas the keys just to end it. Between the earlier Pinot v. Johnnie Walker brawl, and the negging comments Cas had been hitting him with, he was near his breaking point.
“So, what’s next?” Dean turned his face to look at Cas, and when their eyes met, Castiel’s world stopped. He was inches away, leaning in just that little distance would be so easy, and god did he want to.
He smiled and looked at Dean, still bathing underneath those beautiful prisms of light. Then, when Dean tilted his chin up towards the light to contemplate Cas's question, Castiel immediately lifted the camera and shot without a moment's regret. He wanted to capture the way the colors looked like watercolor splashes across Dean's skin, and he thought nothing of a warning. Castiel saw his shot, and he took it.
Dean could hear footsteps in the stairwell outside his door, a door opening and closing nearby, & a quick glance down to his watch confirmed his hopes. “Yup. Any seventy-year-old that has that much stamina?” He wolf-whistled long & slow, smirking at the exasperated groan from Sam. Dean hopped up from his place on the couch & grabbed the empty beer bottles on the table in front of them, gathering them into his arms. “Maybe I have a grandpa kink, Sammy. A man’s gotta get his wall lovin’ when he can.”
Now that the stranger was closer, Dean was able to really look at him. The mystery guy happened to be a boy about Dean's age with a wash of messy dark hair and terribly weather-inappropriate dress. Who wore lace-up shoes and socks to the beach? On top of that, the boy had on a pair of jeans and a button-up short-sleeved shirt. Dean was almost too distracted with his thoughts to notice that the boy seemed hesitant. The last few days, he was buried in a book before Dean could get an introduction in edgewise, but today he sat upright for a moment before laying down. As he turned to grab his book, the boy looked back at Dean, squinting into the direct sunlight.
Dean tossed the remaining bits of caution to the wind. “I want you facin' me then. For our kiss. Hell, gotta do it right if we’re doing it.” Dean was glad he could say that without needing to look Cas in the eye. Caution be gone or not, sometimes it’s hard to ask your best friend
Dean had been so perfect, the summer so damned romantic that it had felt like a hazy dreamscape. But Dean didn't keep that fantasy going at the end; he didn't hold Castiel tight and confess feelings and apologize for leaving so soon; he just... rushed out with barely a kiss, hardly a mention of what they had shared. He hadn't even spared a glance behind him, just kept his back to Castiel until he drove off. He didn't offer a ride, no polite references to keeping in touch, just a horribly impersonal farewell.
“Yeah, ‘cuz you can save me from a ghost or whatever, huh?” Dean grabbed playfully at Castiel’s arms, letting him pull away. “I’ll protect
Dean just smiled and held two hands out in surrender, not so subtly glancing around the makeshift altar they sat at.
The deadline of Summer's end might have even been a significant factor in why Dean needed to make things so right - there was only one chance, and Dean had long since learned to take what he could while it was around. He knew any good opportunity wouldn't stick around too long, but that didn't make it any less of a good thing. And lately, Dean's good things included desserts and music and, as he'd newly discovered, kissing Castiel.
He had always wanted this, a routine, stable life, to have more than a few months at a time in each town, but now that it was a possibility, Cas realized he had no idea how to live that life and absolutely zero time to figure it out. Tomorrow?
Those big green eyes. Damnit. How could he tell Dean anything he was thinking? The way his head had been spinning sideways for days, how Dean made him feel like he was flying, and how the thought of going back to school felt a bit too similar to crashing. What happens back at school, in the dorms, with his friends, with Dean’s friends, with classes? Do they talk? Does he get to kiss him again? Was this weekend the beginning and the end?
know Dean, not like he thought he did. How could Castiel plan for half a conversation when he didn't even know the person he was talking to? The longer Dean stood behind him, the less Castiel felt he could breathe.
There was no audience, no third-party perspective to consider, just the empty parking lot and the faint neon glow of the motel signage.
“There’s lotsa stuff next.” Fine, Cas was drunk. He ignored the amused twitch at the corner of Dean’s lips, knowing that the other boy had been trying to get him to loosen up like this for months. “We could burn strings or throw shoes or count beans or do the scary mirror or eavesdrop on the neighbors or read wax,” Castiel ran through an invisible list, counting off on his fingers as he went, Dean still watching him like he was performing. He’d normally be self-conscious under Dean’s stare, but he just felt… good.
"Can I kiss you?" Dean spoke, wanting to be sure he wasn't entirely off base. He was caught anyhow; he might as well pull the trigger. There was a moment of slight panic in his chest when Dean watched as the boy's eyes widened, but then Cas was nodding, inching even closer.
Dean felt those words, felt what they meant, and that was the end of his attempts at self-preservation. If Cas had wanted for even a fraction of how long Dean had, he knew how much that ached, knew how hard it was to be this close to someone and not have their lips on your own, and Dean nodded, gasping out a “talk later,” into Castiel’s mouth as they slammed back together. He never wanted Cas to feel that cold throb of longing. Cas crowded into Dean’s space on the couch and their kiss was desperate, even more so than before now that Dean wasn't terrified he was making a mistake, no guilt holding him back from taking Castiel as his own now that he knew Cas wanted to give himself over.
It appeared that his usual plan to stay invisible had already backfired. Once the class was dutifully listening to an overview of the syllabus, Castiel felt a tap on his arm and was passed a note from the girl behind him. According to her neatly written words, it was rare for a new resident to move into the neighborhood, let alone a new student their age. The girl, who signed the note as Meg, said that she could already tell that he "didn't suck" as much as everyone else in the town. Castiel huffed out a laugh at that comment - just based on his limited experience with Dean, he didn't have much hope for the city that conditioned him.
floor of this abandoned house? An unchecked closet? The wind split a salt line? Some sort of undiscovered thing that was immune to all traps?
Dean had to admit the pulse of pride he felt every time Castiel demonstrated something Dean taught him, big or small.
Dean made no effort to conceal the overflow of emotions, even ignored the errant tear that slipped out.
Maybe it was those angelic cultural differences that had Cas reading these situations incorrectly too.
Dean grinned, a big toothy smile, one Castiel wished to see every day (a reality that seemed within grasp lately), and squeezed his hand back. “Today sucks,” Dean spoke the words with the affectation entirely wrong, the grin audible despite the negativity. “Today sucks and it sucks in the most boring way ever and we get to fight like a couple and I hate white wine and you hate out-of-season mulled spices. Today doesn’t suck because Sammy is in hell or draining a nurse for demon powers, or you’re gone, or I’m dead, or monsters are attacking. Today just normal sucks.”
“H-hey, let me.” Cas slid his chair back, insecure about seeming too eager when the chair hit the wall in his haste to reach Dean on the other side of the table. “Let me get that for you.” Dean just shrugged and nodded, blinking up at Cas, as unaffected as he always was in the face of Castiel’s nerves.
Castiel unlocked a door that read “Employees Only” and with a wink over his shoulder, the doctor ascended the stairs, Dean not far behind.
“Dean, welcome to the building. I’m sorry to immediately ask something of you, and for not introducing myself sooner,” Castiel’s voice was still rough with arousal, & Dean was suddenly having a difficult time keeping his gaze from becoming a leer. He nodded, not trusting his voice’s ability to respond. “Do you, um,” The man coughed a little, blushing, & Dean thought it unfair that the man was just as adorable as he was every bit Dean’s wet dream. “Do you have batteries?”
His Uncle Bobby was the perfect host for a newly minted adult; the man was never one to pry or make a fuss. Bobby lived barely 15 minutes away from the Winchesters', and while Dean was definitely old enough to stay home alone, he was a fan of routine, and Bobby's had been his summer plan for over a decade. Plus, Bobby was helping restore his car and would always take him out on the lake to fish a few times a week. The extra room upstairs at Bobby's practically belonged to Dean and Sam anyway, ever since he had added the second bed years ago.
The way the angel seemed to seek comfort baffled Dean. He thought the guy should start with taking off the trenchcoat before curling up on the bed.
Cas blushed. He had done that, hadn't he? He had just leaned in and sniffed Dean. After kissing Dean. After Dean kissed him. When not even twenty minutes prior, Cas had been curled in the corner of the hallway, tucked into his English studies. So many things had changed in such a remarkably short amount of time. And on top of that, Castiel was comfortable, joking with Dean and acting like this was alright. Like it was normal. Could it be?
