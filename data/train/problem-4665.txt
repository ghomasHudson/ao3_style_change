Again, with flustered speed, Dean spoke up.
At that Dean’s expression hardened.
Jack was asleep in a similar position to Sam on one of the backseats. Dean shook his head in disbelief. It was still strange seeing the kid being so… human, so powerless.
-and Pictionary, and Monopoly, and Connect Four, and Uno, and everything else we’ve ever played.” He looked over at Cas. The suspicion which had been clouding Sam’s features had turned accusatory as he finished his sentence.
“I was more confused about why they’d – parent trap us – as you say. We aren’t a-“ He suddenly cut himself off, a flustered expression crossing his face only for a moment before he continued. It was hesitant. “We aren’t fighting.”
Sam furrowed his brows. “What do you mean?”
PLEASE.
So much for the not mad thing. Now he was trying to get rid of him. Right? Why else would he suggest Dean leave with Sam? Up until now, he’d never had anything to say about how often Dean had been skipping out on out of town hunts.
“Dean are you sure you’re okay?”
Then, with tears trickling down his cheeks, with a gentle and beautiful smile, with loving eyes; Cas stepped up closer to him.
Cas seemed to relax further. The tension and fear that had seemed to radiate off him moments ago lessened. Dean couldn’t say the same for himself.
Dean’s heart continued to race. Maybe this was some sort of weirdly real seeming dream. He pinched his arm.
“What if it is?” Dean replied. He attempted to maintain the sharp argumentative tone. However, the question came out softer than he had wanted. He inwardly cursed himself.
Though they still hadn’t gone on that beach vacation. Maybe a beach wedding could be arranged. He pondered to himself as Dean finally stopped coughing up a lung.
Manuscripts of a spell containing similar ingredients and rituals. But instead of blasting away power, it would absorb. Some of the technical details flew over Dean’s head but he nodded along.
“Great. More waiting around.” Dean rolled his eyes.
Sam interrupted Castiel’s anxious ramblings. “Woah Cas, calm down, you’re gonna be fine.”
“Listen, you don’t understand okay. You don’t get what it’s like. And besides you’re the one that got me into this in the first place.”
“Sorry Jack. We uh don’t have any Lizzo here.” Dean managed to sound genuinely apologetic.
Dean stepped forward, only for Cas to suddenly speak up again, the nervous expression returning.
“Seriously dude.” Sam walked in rubbing his face, phone in hand. He leaned back against a wall. “Are you sure you’re okay?” He asked with a kinder tone, stifling a yawn.
Dean smiled too, looking down at them.
“- or whatever it is you’re planning on doing” Sam added on at the end as he began to make his way out.
Dean coughed out as he looked away, focusing on pulling the Impala into the bunker’s garage.  “Hah. Okay.”
“My turn then,” Castiel responded when he was ready.
Cas smiled lightly, before straightening his face. This whole not being happy thing was going to be even harder to manage now, but surely they could grant themselves little moments like this. Moments of reassurance.
“Dean, come on. You know I’m here to talk. And I’m the only one you can talk to this about right now so please, don’t hold it all in.” Sam stayed patient.
For some reason, the urge to keep arguing against the point seemed to fade away. He was sure it would be back later, and he'd question again if Cas really knew what he was getting into. But, for the time being, he didn't have it in him to keep pushing back. Hell, he didn't want to keep pushing back.
Cas visibly stiffened. He finally looked away from Dean.
He wasn’t sure what Cas heard in his voice, but at that he finally opened his eyes and turned his head over to Dean. He studied him for a moment. Dean could feel his gaze piercing the side of his head. He attempted to keep his expression neutral, but he kept slipping into a frown.
“Dean.” Sam chastised, shooting him a ‘knock it off’ look.
Dean glanced up, the worry not leaving his face.
“All I’m saying is, his whole life can’t just revolve around us. He’s allowed to be his own person.” Sam held up a hand as Dean went to interject. “And- maybe you should consider how acting like this makes him feel.” He finished with a raised brow.
After a stretch of silence Sam finally spoke up.
A mixtape.
“I swear, I feel fine.” Sam shrugged and smiled encouragingly back at Cas through the rearview mirror.
He didn’t know if angels could feel like that. They were designed to be soldiers, they weren’t even supposed to feel, let alone feel love. And especially feel that kind of love.
“We’re already doing the whole surprise party thing, which I’m still not sure is his thing if I’m being honest.” Sam sat down at his desk as he spoke.
That one angel had told him that ever since Cas laid a hand on him in hell he’d been lost. And Dean had held onto that. If laying a hand on Dean could tear Cas down so irreparably. What could loving him do?
“Sorry, sorry. I’ll stop pushing. I just can’t believe the odds.” He glanced over at Cas with the last phrase, a knowing smile on his face.
“Uh, yeah-”
“Anyway. Let’s get back to this party, I want more pie.” With that, he reached for Cas’ hand and began to lead him there.
Cas suddenly opened his mouth, turning back to speak to the blonde woman presumably, but she was no longer there.
God. He was losing his mind, there’s no way he could keep this to himself. He considered it again for a moment.
Very rude of you.
As Dean spoke, Cas’ eye caught something sticking out of a lore book on the desk. The top of a familiar image peeked out, light reflecting off it slightly. Ignoring Dean for a moment, he stepped forward and pulled it out. Recognition immediately flooded him.
“Of course he will Cas. It’s you, he’ll love it no matter what.” Sam smiled back at him encouragingly.
He looked back at Dean again with a small smile. This time he waved back awkwardly. He soon shuffled out of the view of the window.
“Cas I mean- I don’t mean on your own. The two of us. What if we retired and got a place or something, I don’t know.” The last sentence came out rushed and Dean began to heat up. He was sure if it had been lighter out his face would be noticeably red.
Fervency which continued to build as Dean deepened the kiss in response, his tongue slipping into the angel’s mouth. So much so that Dean found himself pressed up against the outside of the bunker door with a loud thud. Not that he was complaining.
“Cas was in here earlier, he seemed sad. But he said nothing was wrong so I’m not sure.” Jack stated plainly, childlike.
Sorry this is so much dialogue and barely anything happens! But I felt like some contemplation was needed here. Hope y’all are doing alright and that you enjoy xx
“While you mean a lot to me Dean I seem to be too worried about Jack’s safety, Chuck, as well as the deal, to allow myself to be happy right now.”
He was cut off by the click of a gun.
“Your coworkers think we’re dating.” Maybe not the strongest start.
“They still haven’t let up huh?” Dean quietly muttered to Cas, rubbing his temples in frustration.
“I’m listening” Billie responded, with the quirk of a brow and a hint of a smile.
“Locked in a bath-” Sam began. Then his gaze landed on Jack who was pointedly not looking at him. Oh, great, he had a rogue agent. He sighed and looked back over at the two men at the table.
He hadn’t thought that’s where this had been going. Hell, he hadn’t thought Cas had it in him to be that straightforward.
“From who? What is it?” Sam’s curiosity was piqued. Cas didn’t have any friends that he knew of besides them, and he was sure the other angels weren’t gift giving types.
It seemed so simple now that it was all laid out. Knowing what their lives were like however, he wasn’t sure it would be ultimately.
He heard Cas sigh softly.
“Am I wrong?” He raised his eyebrows defiantly at Dean.
im afraid that’s all there is. there’s not much more to say
"Everything okay?"
“What ideas do you have so far?” Sam asked.
While as an angel he was far removed, and too other to care for Dean in that way, as a human he could probably see all his flaws up close. See what better options he had too.
Dean had to admit - despite all his grumbling - it wasn’t as if he wasn’t having fun. It wasn’t just teaming up against Jack and Sam that was entertaining. All the time he’d been spending with Cas, it had been making him a lot happier. Cas seemed to be enjoying it too. Still, he had to figure out what his idiot brother and kid were up to.
He had been attempting to teach Cas various nuances as well as life skills that would be useful to him as a human. However, he figured learning how to use air quotes correctly wasn’t high on the list of priorities for the time being. They had other things they were working on still.
Dean huffed. “Well you deserve one. So come on. Pick a day.”
Hope yall are liking where this is going! The next three chapters will be dropping together like the first three. Likely some time next week.
“They really haven’t”
“Look at me Dean.”
“We’re gonna save Jack, and we’re gonna kill God. Then we’re gonna get you out of that damn deal and-“ his tone remained stable and determined until the last word, where he faltered “-and you’re gonna get to be happy Cas” he finished. His heart was pounding through his chest. Had he said too much?
“It’s just that- If you know how-”
“I’m sure you got the store clerk’s number.”
Dean wracked his brain for reasons why Cas could be acting this way, until it clicked, and with that his heart sank.
“By the way, how did the mixtape end up going?” He was curious. Neither Cas nor Dean had bothered him again with their birthday plans, and while he’d been thankful at first, his curiosity was getting the better of him.
Sam stood up and walked over to Dean delicately. As if he were approaching a scared, wounded animal.
Sam stared back at him blankly, his mouth slightly ajar. He shook his head in wonder before speaking.
“He might freak out. I think he needs to realise it on his own.” Sam sighed as if he wished that weren’t the case.
“Dean had mentioned wanting to go on a vacation. A beach trip. So how about this; we take them on a trip, and get them to spend as much time together as possible, hell we can even make sure they get a cabin or room or whatever together.” He raised his brows at Jack, then nodded to himself. Finally, they had another plan. The couples retreats hadn’t really been working out for them, and Dean had started catching onto the fact that half of them weren’t even real hunts.
“This is strange. Sam only booking a table for two, him and Jack not showing up- You were right Dean, something is off.” He frowned accusingly at the intricately folded napkin in front of him.
After their initial conversation - and the activities in the Impala which followed - Cas had insisted they talk to Sam and let him know about the change in their relationship. Dean had been a little less keen on the idea. Sam could figure it out himself. Why make a big deal out of it when it was still so new? Hell, he didn't even know how he'd describe their new- situation- in the first place.
“I said the plan was decent, but it seems that I’ll have to perfect it on my own.” She surveyed them all. “You boys continue on collecting what we need. I’ll return when I have more information for you.”
“I was jealous of Meg,” Dean responded instantly.
“Shut up.” Dean snapped again, with little gusto. He slumped in his chair slightly.
“I love you too Dean.”
He couldn’t force Cas to follow through with the plan. He also couldn’t explain to him why he needed him to so badly.
“Messing with Sam is always fun.”
“What is it?” Cas asked, his brows furrowed.
At least he sounded genuinely apologetic.
“I’m utterly indifferent to sexual orientation, Dean,” Cas sighed impatiently.
“What’s going on with Jack?”
“Dean I would love to retire with you. We can discuss it when we get back to the bunker.” He smiled and began to walk towards the Impala.
“Dean made you a mixtape?” He asked slowly. There was humour in his tone for reasons Cas didn’t understand.
Cas looked down at the image. In it he stood, looking up with a slight frown he hadn’t realised was there. And on top of his head was the cowboy hat. He still thought it was slightly ridiculous, but Dean said it looked good, and since Dean had one too it meant they matched. He couldn’t quite place why, but both of those things made him happy.
Dean frowned at Cas, who continued to be fascinated by the contents of his cup.
“Cas- Why- Why are you asking?” Dean questioned, sighing. He rubbed a hand over his face wearily.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re taking a break.”
“What? No buddy, it’s fine.” He huffed out a fake chuckle. “You deal with assholes and faulty machines all day. I get it. You wanna relax after that, not be stuck with me.”
Though on second thought maybe the blue one was better.
“I promise you. If I feel that there is any danger of the Empty taking me away, I will tell you. For now, though, there is too much on our plates. I’m fine, I promise.” Cas spoke with gentle firmness.
“Don’t worry Cas, he’s gonna love it.”
That’s what made this moment difficult. How was he supposed to explain to Cas the things he had needed a mixtape to try to express.
Dean froze again. Unable to process what Jack had said. His head was empty. In that moment he could think nothing, he felt suspended.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas’ eyes finally shifted to Dean, he tilted his head. His voice was cautious and defensive as he replied.
Ever since their conversation in Cas’ room that one night, Cas had seemed distant. Dean had first thought it was all in his head. However, as the days went on, it became certain. Cas was definitely withdrawn.
“I don’t know Dean, maybe talk to him.” Sam stated sarcastically. “Tell him how you feel even.” He continued.
Dean blinked rapidly before huffing out a laugh.
Eventually, he assumed Cas wasn’t going to say anything in response. That should've come as a relief. It didn't though.
Eventually, Dean’s pity party was interrupted by the sound of the Impala’s passenger side door opening.
As he pondered that, he noticed Sam’s expression clear all of a sudden. He eyed Dean warily, however, the corners of his mouth seemed to be straining to tilt upwards.
When Dean only stared back at him with an impatient look Sam sighed.
“Dean you’re an idiot.”
That snapped Dean out of his trance, his eyes snapping up, locking onto Castiel’s. They remained for a short time until Dean's gaze flickered away quickly, as if it were strenuous to keep looking.
They all stood there for a moment before Dean interrupted the silence.
“Sorry to disappoint.” Cas replied sincerely as he awkwardly shifted in place. He glanced at Dean and Jack before looking back down at the board.
After a minute, Dean cleared his throat. “Would really love it if you’d answer buddy.”
Dean looked at him pointedly. Sam looked back.
He began to walk back, hand in hand with Cas. When they were halfway to the car he stopped, suddenly remembering what had prompted this in the first place.
It was silent for a moment.
He watched Cas walk towards the kitchen exit before a thought from earlier grappled him.
Cas seemed to notice his growing panic, because he stepped up and placed a calming hand on his shoulder. Slowly, as if he expected Dean to step away.
They calmed him slightly.
“Yeah.”
Cas glanced at him, tilting his head in question.
“Right, right. What does he call it- a profound bond.” She chuckled. The latter half of the sentence she said in a deep and gravelly tone, which seemed to be imitating a certain angel.
“Oh come on.” Dean jokingly whined.
“It’s okay Dean. We’ll get through this. You’ll get through it. You’ll get to have it all. Being happy. It’s what you both deserve.” Sam smiled sadly at him.
He stepped up closer to him, and with a deep breath he responded.
“So what now?”
An unreadable expression crossed Castiel’s face for a moment, but it faded away just as quickly as he responded.
“Yeah not so much.” Dean settled on a beer, and walked over, taking the seat opposite Cas.
“We need to figure out what we’re going to do about Jack once we gank Chuck.”
Dean looked up at him again. Cas’ eyes were now facing downwards. Damn it.
“Like what?” Questioned Cas, his tone too neutral.
Finally, Dean sighed, dropping his head and conceding.
He also did not kick Sam’s empty chair.
Sam was asleep in the passenger seat, his head slumped over onto the window. That’s gonna leave a crick in his neck, Dean thought to himself, shaking his head.
“I was pretty jealous when you went on that date with your manager.” Dean offered, his voice quieting slightly as he made the admission.
Cas looked at him incredulously.
“What the hell are you talking about?” He snapped, his tone incredulous.
Dean shook his head, laughing. God, he was so in love. He finally reached forward, placing a hand on the other man’s face. “I love you.” And with that, he leaned forward to meet his lips. Kissing him softly for a moment.
After a moment Dean was the first to cave, looking away and rolling his eyes.
They remained silent. Dean heard his own heart thumping.
Cas blinked. “Oh um. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.”
“Cas I- come on man I’m really trying here.” Dean sighed out as he stood.
He let out a slight huff of laughter.
“Oh good! You found it. I’d been meaning to give that to you. Thought you’d want it. I don’t know, you don’t have many things so-“ He paused to catch his breath.
Push him away. Keep yourself safe. Hurt him so he’ll be better off. That’s what his mind was telling him.
Cas groaned, tilting his head back and looking up at the ceiling.
Cas rolled his eyes before flickering them back to Dean and narrowing them.
Cas looked around, never meeting Dean’s eyes.
“Dinner. It’s this place someone recommended, I asked him if he wanted to go. And now we’re going- uh- yeah.”
“When it comes to praying. Angels- we don’t just hear the prayers to us. We can also sense direct longing. If it’s strong enough.” When Dean continued to look confused and didn’t respond, Cas went on.
Cas shifted his attention towards him.
Cas stood in the doorway, smiling faintly, and back in his usual trench-coated attire. Seeming to revert back to it whenever he wasn’t otherwise forced out. It was like a uniform of sorts.
Cas was clearly determined, and a little scared. Dean could sense it.
“Here we are.” The host – Lee, according to his name tag – suddenly interrupted his musings. Dean flushed a little; embarrassed as if the other two men had heard his thoughts. Though of course, they hadn’t. In fact, Cas was more concerned about something else at that moment.
“Do you want me to take over? You seem tired.” He offered, fidgeting with his phone.
But then Dean looked up at the blue eyes staring into him. Swirling with tension and confusion and fear and-
Eventually, he had a moment alone with Cas who took the opportunity to briskly drag him away from the crowd. He led them both into the kitchen.
Cas straightened up slightly. “What do you mean crazy?” Dean could feel the confused frown piercing into the side of his head.
“Everyone?”
At that Dean looked over at Cas almost shyly, only to straighten his face out the moment Cas looked back at him.
It was all too overwhelming. For years he’d pushed it all back, the way he felt around Cas. Locked it away and thrown away the key. Not because of his vessel. He- well- even Dean could inwardly admit he was a bit repressed. But, he’d been slowly realising over the course of the last few years, that all those “man crushes” were something more (damn you Dr Sexy). He’d filed away processing and dealing with that for some other time, when there wasn’t an apocalypse or some other end of the world scenario on their hands.
“You alright there?” Dean asked, his brown furrowing. He was concerned, and a little annoyed at the lack of engagement he was receiving.
As he crouched at the crossroads; with Jack a distance away behind him; he observed the photo in his hands for a second. He was glad he’d forgotten it in his wallet as they now had a picture for the ritual. He smiled at the memories it conjured. A movie, a hat, the click of a camera, a room, an image tucked away inside a book, a man.
When he ran out of excuses not to, he knocked.
Sam waited for him to leave, but Dean was taking his time. He shot him one final hopeful glance as he reached the door, only to be met with a glare. With that, he finally exited the room and Sam sighed.
“It’s nothing Dean.” Cas’ tone was laced with worry.
Instead, he sighed and responded, putting the book he’d been reading aside.
Castiel only squinted in response.
Sam held back a snort and pressed his lips together to keep from laughing at the phrasing. “Okay, so what were you thinking then?”
Dean was out on a beer run, Jack was in his room. Only Cas and Sam remained in the bunker library, doing research for a local ghoul case.
“Of course Dean, I’m sorry. Good night.” He smiled slightly. It looked pained.
When Cas looked back alarmed, Dean clarified. “Swap seats with Sam!”
Dean glared across the kitchen at Cas, who sat at the table looking very much as annoyed as he claimed to be.
“You ran away! He put himself out there, and you ran away.” Sam chastised.
He blinked rapidly.
He then glanced back at the blue eyes piercing through him in the mirror, illuminated by the moonlight.
He would just ask Cas.
At that Jack smiled proudly. However, his expression turned slightly guiltier when Cas continued.
“We will find out soon enough.”
“Do you want me to come with you or something?” Sam offered with a confused shake of his head. He glanced at Cas for help. Cas stared up at the ceiling and questioned his taste in men.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” He muttered to himself in the darkness.
Cas sighed, beginning to exit the car before he halted slightly. He seemed to be thinking something over, taking in a breath before speaking.
“I- Just listen okay.”
He breathed in and started with what felt right.
“Like I was saying… It doesn’t seem too complicated, we’ll probably be done with it and back in four days at the most.”
He couldn’t say he wasn’t suspicious. While he really had appreciated the day out with Claire, it wasn’t the most subtle of plans. Getting him out of the house on his birthday, everyone insisting that they couldn’t come, but not having any concrete reason why.
Before Jack could finish his sentence, Dean’s phone started ringing. He held up his hand gesturing for Jack to wait, as he stepped away and answered it. Meanwhile, Jack stayed in place; bubbling in his confusion and concern as the other man’s phone conversation droned on nearby.
And with that he stepped away, Jack following after him as they- he assumed- went off to call Amara.
(See the end of the chapter for
“-and Charades” Sam continued.
At this Dean and Jack glanced up at Sam questioningly. Dean looked slightly offended, despite the fact he'd said practically the same thing moments ago. Cas stopped arranging the blocks for a moment to tilt his head at Sam slightly.
“I assure you it’s not. Dean right now our priority is Chuck.“ Cas glanced seriously towards the table at Jack.
“Right this way sirs.”
“What is his goal? You don’t think it’s anything serious, do you? Normally when you two lie to each other it involves secret deals, or angel possessions, or schemes, or working with your enem-“ He trailed off as Dean glared blankly at him. Cas looked back just as blankly.
Sam hadn’t stopped pestering him, naturally.
“You’re a- breakable object.” Dean scrunched up his face, reevaluating his come back.
That one time that Cas had walked into the library and Dean had immediately bolted out to grab some beer? That was just stock replenishment. They were running low. And sure, when Cas had wandered into the ‘Dean Cave’ the previous night; taking a break from his search for Amara; Dean had turned the tv off mid movie and told him he was tired. But that was because... well, he was sleepy damn it! The conversation could wait for some other time! Denial was a hell of a thing.
“Yep?” Dean looked up curiously, taking a sip of his beer as he did so.
“Dean, no.”
He huffed out a laugh. It was strained. “Yeah. I didn’t, I uh- You and Sam are always assuming things.”
“Dean was looking for him too, maybe they’re talking in there.” Jack offered.
“Dean. Do you not want me in the bunker anym-‘
“I don’t know- I don’t think Amara is going to be much more help on that front. God and god-like entities don’t have sway in the Empty. But I have wondered whether Billie could negotiate something.” Cas had an intense look of concentration on his face. This was clearly something he’d been considering for a while.
Dean stiffened slightly, sensing the danger in that statement, but Cas continued on. “But, I certainly am not able to be truly happy at the moment when our son is in imminent danger, and the world hangs in the balance.” He smiled humorlessly at Dean.
Dean and Cas shared a split-second look. It was serious, but it didn’t match the anger of their respective tones so far. However, Sam didn’t have time to mull it over as they continued to bicker.
That would imply that this was a conversation she’d had with Cas before. Hell, based on what she’d said earlier, that a lot of Cas’ coworkers had with him before.
He was cut off by a sharp intake of breath. The girl looked wide eyed at him and then out the window of the store, tilting back her head. He realised she was looking at the Impala. When she looked back at him she was smiling.
They remained in comfortable silence for a moment, before Dean remembered something. He quickly stole a glance at Cas before looking away again and taking in a breath.
He was going to burn down his room.
“If you two want to go to the beach, go ahead.” He pointed accusingly at them again.
“I uh-” He started. He could sense the words that were about to slip out of his mouth, and if it had been a few weeks ago he may have been concerned. But all that time with Cas had definitely loosened him up a little. It didn’t help that Cas was always so upfront, sometimes jarringly so. That meant that Dean had also started saying things more openly. Well, bar a few.
Every soft smile he shared with Cas, every casual brush of their shoulders, every laugh shared - it all had him freezing up, glancing around as if the Empty would show up then and there to take Cas away.
“No- I don’t think so. Maybe the life you had together though.”
Eventually, he wouldn’t even need Dean anymore. He tried not to let that sting, as he pushed away the guilt at not wanting that to happen.
“Sorry I just-“ Dean gripped onto the phone tighter, pacing. “-I’m worried man. About you, about the kid.”
Jack only chuckled, never any less delighted at the tower falling. He removed the Jenga block from his food and placed it atop the rest of its fallen brethren. The pile of blocks was flanked by two piles of pizza boxes, with several empty beer bottles also littering the table – the latter mostly Dean’s doing.
Silence.
“What, what I- What?!” Dean managed to sputter out.
“Yeah, well I realised that you don’t have a birthday, and we ought to pick one for you. Until then though, I got you a gift to make up for it.”
After the battle with Chuck, Jack transferred all his gained Godly power to Amara. He’d insisted on it.
Dean nodded tensely before getting up and walking back to the fridge.
“Dean, what is it?” Cas questioned as Dean finally stopped walking. They stood a few feet away from the front of the Impala.
He wanted to yell and shout in joy, he wanted to run a lap around the highway, he wanted to pull Cas into his arms and never let go.
With a sigh, he made his way to the kitchen to update Jack. They had a lot of work to do. And Jack was going to have to act sniffly for the next few days.
Dean breathed out a sigh of relief followed by a slight laugh. He felt lighter than he had in months.
He sat outside in the Impala. Rain beating down above and around him. He’d been praying to... well, the only being he ever prayed to. He’d been doing that a lot lately, unsure if his prayers were being heard, but unable to stop himself. He’d talk about how Sam and Eileen were doing, he told Cas about how Claire had been during their visit, he told him about Jack, he told him about Miracle, he spoke of everything, except the most important thing. He just. Couldn’t. Not like this. Not with him gone.
Dean stared up with pleading eyes, willing Castiel to finally understand, to accept.
They stood in silence as Cas gaped at him.
“Yes.” Cas responded. A tone of surprise in his voice. “How did you-“
“Son of a bitch.” He muttered angrily.
“You literally just said Cas is in love with you Dean.” Sam reasoned, amused.
“Right uh- Well I wasn’t rude! I was just asking. You’re the one being dramatic.” Dean countered, glaring at Cas again.
Cas noncommittally nodded, still not looking over at Dean. He stood tensely.
Dean accepted the generosity. “Yeah! Exactly.”
“Me too.”
As he considered what Cas had said, a wave of sadness hit him suddenly. His throat felt tight.
He jumped and turned around to see Cas and Dean standing there - fully clothed - to his relief.
“Oh yeah- Right- So I searched up some of those places uh? Linda?”
No. Nope. Terrible idea. His brother would never let him live it down, and it was probably best to actually figure out what the situation with Cas actually was before telling Sam anything.
These repressed idiots were going to drive him mad.
When they parted both of them had tears streaming down their faces, but neither seemed to care. Suddenly, Dean’s eyes widened.
“Listen there’s definitely something there. But I don’t think either of them has realised it yet.” Sam smiled at him, shaking his head lightly.
Sam interrupted hastily with a groan. “Cas, come on man I don’t wanna hear about that.” He shook his head before his face suddenly went blank in horror. “Oh god, you’re not here to ask me for advice on that are you because-“
“Why not? I saw it in a movie. We take them to Vegas, they’ll get drunk and married. It’s perfect!”
“Dean.”
“Yeah but-” Sam looked over at Cas again, like he was an equation Sam was attempting to solve “I can’t remember the last time you haven’t lost a game we’ve played, it seems borderline impossible.” His tone was lighter, yet still accusatory.
"Did you talk to him- to Sam?" Cas questioned, hovering in the doorway of the kitchen. His heart was pounding, his chest was tense. Having just seen Jack with the snake, he hadn't expected to walk into the kitchen to see Dean there looking just as stressed as Cas felt.
After some time simmering in peaceful silence he spoke up.
"I think that may be necessary." He nodded seriously at Dean, who playfully shook his head with a smile.
“You guys done?” Sam questioned with a smirk.
“No I. No man. Not at you. It’s what any of us would’ve done. It’s just- It’s just not fair.” Dean painfully choked out, not looking at Cas.
At first, Dean bought Cas’ pondering expression. But then he noticed the corners of his mouth tilting upwards, and shot him a glare.
“Cas wh- Oh! Sorry!”
“Done! We-“
Another text immediately came through.
After an 8 month hiatus here it is: the next chapter. Four more and an epilogue coming after this. Thanks for the patience xx
“No problem kid.”
The food arriving soon after didn’t seem to aid matters. Dean shovelled it down with anxious fervency, all the while glancing up at Cas on a frequent basis. The uneasy energy at the table was beginning to make him tense too, and after catching Dean glancing at him like a frightened puppy for the dozenth time he spoke up again.
Cas didn't say it, but Dean could tell not having his powers anymore got to him more than he let on. When he first became human he'd commented more than once on his lack of usefulness. Dean had shut it down immediately.
Dean sighed dramatically but stayed where he was, waiting for the picture to be taken.
They watched him leave and sat in silence for a moment.
Dean didn’t bring the matter up with Cas when he picked him up from work. Though he had a feeling Cas noticed his uncharacteristic silence. Even so, he didn’t mention it, and Dean was glad.
Sam looked back at him with a deadpan expression. When Dean's hard expression didn’t waver, he sighed and began to walk away.
He slowly reached out his hand towards Dean’s. Dean froze for a second, but forced himself to relax a moment later. When he didn’t seem to be showing any signs of bolting across the bunker, Cas slowly placed his hand down.
“You can press play now.”
Cas and Dean’s faces paled over.
After all, it wasn’t fair that Cas kept getting him all flustered.
“So I might have found a case. It’s only a few towns over. Seems simple enough that I can cover it on my own.” He began, clearly uncomfortable with the tension in the room.
Then, suddenly, Jack’s eyes widened, and he looked over at Sam with a smile.
Which is why he happened to forget all about Sam’s stupid list.
Dean breathed in again. Loosening his grip on the item. He held it between his fingers up towards Cas, as he gazed intently at him.
‘Hey Sam our best friend is in love with me and I-‘
Cas stood in place for a second, caught off guard at Dean's swift exit.
“Have you seen Cas?”
They stared at each other softly, just enjoying the silence and company. Dean’s hand was slightly twitching at his side, he wondered if it would be too much to reach it over to Castiel’s.
Dean only continued to shake his head. “Not happening.” He slowly got up and Cas followed.
Cas’ expression softened again. “I’m sorry.”
Sam glanced over at Cas, then to Dean and Jack respectively. His squinted eyes widened for a split-second as realisation washed over his features. Oh.
“This is the last thing I need to absorb for the ritual, whenever Billie says it’s time.” He held it up with a small smile.
“This is stupid. I just- wanted to know how you were doing kid. Which you are. Still a kid. Don’t think because you got God powers now or something that you’re some hot shot okay?” He leaned his head against the back of his seat, smiling sadly, the joke not masking how much he missed his son.
Dean stared at him for a moment. Maybe he could talk to Sam about what was going-
As the moment passed Dean wiped a hand over his eyes quickly. “Argh. Enough of that.” He cleared his throat. “Now tell me. Were you serious about retiring?”
Dean sighed dramatically. “Not this again. Buddy why-”
Sam spared no time.
Sam’s tone hardened slightly as he continued. “Dean. Cas is allowed to have other friends.”
“What are you doing?”
“What?” Dean asked, his frown deepening.
They drove in silence for the rest of the drive.
“Listen, Cas.” Sam sat down next to him. “If these are the songs that describe how you feel about Dean, then that’s what matters. He’ll love it- he’ll love it because it’s from you.”
“Yeah, you didn’t wake me up in the middle of the night to clam up now. What is it, let’s get this over with so I can go back to sleep.” Sam looked at him curiously... but mostly with annoyance, maybe a tinge of worry.
I’m sorry I didn’t mean for this to get so angsty!! I promise they’ll get to be happy because it’s what they and we all deserve!!
Taking that as a yes, Castiel took out his phone and waited for a few police officers to pass them, sensing they might find their picture-taking at a crime scene strange. Then he held up his phone.
“Well then what was I- actually okay- then what was Cas thinking about just then? Cas see if he gets it right.” Dean’s tone was defensive.
Sam had been standing outside the warehouse for what felt like forever. Leaning against the Impala.
Cas shuffled in quickly, closing the door behind him. He seemed to finally relax the slightest once he was inside and out of the apparently ominous hallway.
“But for now I have to go. First we save Jack.” Cas finally stated.
Now both Sam and Cas eyed him with wariness.
He was certain he was probably beet red at that moment. Cas’ gaze on him definitely wasn’t throwing him any less off balance.
As he stood there staring at him wide-eyed, Cas turned his gaze to him, tilting his head and looking back at Dean with a confused expression. As if he didn’t understand why saying something like that in front of Sam would have Dean’s brain functions draw to a halt.
Cas stifled a yawn as he responded. “I'm a bit tired tonight, I may have to postpone.”
This time it was Jack who looked confused. He frowned at the question.
Sam had been weirdly into the whole ‘getting back into hunting’ thing. He was more often than not out hunting with Eileen these days after she’d taken up a permanent residence in the bunker.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean frowned. “What are you talking about?”
Dean glared at him, not dignifying Sam’s query with an answer. He’d been listening. Mostly.
“Jack, relax. Why do you think…“ He blanked again for a moment before continuing. “Why do you think Cas and Dean are married?”
Dean stood there, casually yet threateningly holding his gun in his hand. Not pointing it at Sam, more so just making its presence known. Sam snorted.
“Wait!” Dean called out. They all looked over at him as he continued. “That’s it? You can’t just keep running off like this while keeping us in the dark.” Dean exclaimed, his voice threatening to rise.
He exited the Impala and locked the door. Before he could make his way up to the storefront away from the car, he glanced up to see Cas inside, through the store window. Cas didn’t notice him; otherwise preoccupied at the counter.
“Good, I uh. I guess I’ll go talk to Sam.” He replied, silently cursing himself.
“So what was that little interrogation about?”
Cas shook his head. “No, just deciding what to wear tomorrow.”
If third-wheeling before they’d sorted their shit out was bad, from now on it was going to be even worse, Sam realised as he stepped out.
Sam gave him a look of annoyance.
“You know- because. Well, we’re both getting too old for this crap, and we both- you know-“ Dean coughed out.
He saw Dean walk in as expected, but then he saw the other man.
Cas eyed Dean curiously. He had been uncharacteristically quiet the entire ride over, as well as at the restaurant. As they waited for their- Dean’s-  food to arrive, he sat there bouncing in his seat nervously, while actively avoiding eye contact.
It definitely wasn’t because he was thinking them up on the spot.
“Okay, that one might have been justified,” Dean muttered sheepishly, unable to keep the abashed smile off his face.
“Okay.” He nodded after letting a few seconds pass, a small almost smile playing at his lips.
“De-“
Dean continued. “I couldn’t say it. It was there, it was-“ He choked back what sounded like a sob.
“I told you Dean. She had a date, and her usual sitter wasn’t available.” Cas rolled his eyes, clearly over the conversation.
“Huh.”
From the crowd, Jack swept forward, running up to him.
Cas sighed. When he'd seen Dean he'd contemplated telling him about Jack, but it didn't seem like the time. Not now that he was concerned about Sam. Not with all else plaguing them.
It wasn’t easy.
Sam raised his brows slightly, gesturing for Cas to elaborate.
“Things like friendship, family, love- it’s all a lot clearer. But it also is harder to ignore, or to explain away-" He took in a breath and looked over "The way we are with each other, for example... Do you understand?”
Cas’ eyes widened slightly. He glanced back where Dean had left a few moments ago. The room remained deadly silent for a moment before he finally found his voice again.
If he were pressed, he’d say that the dark blue sweater made the blue of the angel’s eyes seem even deeper. That its fit highlighted how well built he was, much better than the oversized trench coat did – not that he didn’t love the coat too. He would have nothing to say about the slimmer fitting pants, however. In fact, he was pointedly staring up as high up as possible on Cas’ torso, away from them, as Cas walked with his back to him.
Cas’ brows jumped up all of a sudden. “You’re ready to leave the bunker?” He questioned. “What about Sam?”
A few years ago he never would’ve allowed himself to think it. Hunters don’t get to have normal lives he would’ve thought. Hell, even if they could, they don’t with angels, they don’t with-
He decided he could cope with being the third wheel if it meant more of that and less of the pain. They deserved it.
“Lacey.”
“Did you finish your dinner” Cas straightened up slightly to inspect Jack’s side of the table and his plate.
“Dean you can’t be serious. I know you-” Cas interrupted with outrage.
“Uh- yeah. We uh. We finally did. So that’s what you guys had been trying to do this whole time huh?” He vaguely questioned, hoping Sam would say something revealing. He smiled tightly and nodded at him, waiting for a response.
“You know what, let’s do movie night.” He continued, his voice slightly intense, the enthusiasm kind of hilarious, and kind of adorable.
And so, they both continued to act like nothing happened. He was sure Cas must hate him, or resent him, or something. He’d laid his heart out bare to not even get an acknowledgement in return. He’d sacrificed himself for Dean, hell he’d become human in a roundabout way because of him. There had been no way to get him out of the Empty with his grace intact. And so he was human. Which wouldn’t have happened in the first place if he hadn’t saved Dean.
He understood better now why that was.
Cas sighed lightly. But soon after a slight smirk played at his features.
Castiel blinked. He looked at Dean questioningly, mouth opening to talk but then snapping shut. He was afraid of misinterpreting the statement. He wasn’t even sure he really heard it.
“He should be nicer to me.” Dean mumbled back. Maturity be damned.
He began to pace back and forth outside the warehouse before finally caving and rushing in.
Cas smiled to himself, dropping to a neutral expression as he glanced up at Dean again. “Your turn.”
“Maybe they think we are?” Dean suggested, fiddling with the cutlery in front of him absentmindedly.
“You understand now why I have to find another way Dean.” Castiel peered up at him attempting to make eye contact.
Dean considered for a moment, but before he could answer, Lee returned to them looking frazzled.
Cas huffed out a silent laugh, before smiling lightly. “That sounds nice actually.”
Dean’s eyes widened for a second and he immediately looked away. A red flush began to creep up his cheeks, no doubt at the mention of his strange outburst the other day. Why he’d been so determined for Cas to know he hadn’t kept that number, neither of them was really certain of. However, for some reason, it tinged Castiel with an unknown but familiar type of contentment.
Well, the ones he’d dispensed to them at least. He wasn’t about to start whining about how if Cas was off working, that meant less time he spent at the bunker. About how it meant he wouldn’t need him anymore. How he worried Cas was only running off to get away from Dean in the first place.
Jesus Christ.
Dean gave him an annoyed glance before his face lit up as something suddenly hit him. “Wait does this mean you already know what he’s getting me for my birthday?”
It felt like a knife was twisting in his chest.
“Hey!” Dean shouted, as Cas nodded knowingly at Sam.
“It’s okay Dean. I’ve told you, I’m safe from the Empty.” When Deans pained expression didn’t falter he continued “If all works out and we can find a way to save Jack and defeat Chuck, then- Then I would have no problem becoming human.”
He didn’t know what he wanted to say. He didn’t have anything more to talk about really. At least for now.
“Me- uh. Me and Cas. We’re headed out. Got reservations in a bit.” He rubbed the back of his neck, looking around his room in what he hoped was a casual way.
More than anything though, he wanted to kiss the man staring up at him with those soulful eyes.
After overhearing Cas and Jacks conversation about the Empty deal in the kitchen, Dean is conflicted.
“Talk. To. Him.” Sam repeated, slowly pushing Dean out the door. He’d tried the gentle and supportive approach for the past half an hour, but clearly it wasn’t working, and he had other things to do.
“Is that so?”
“That reminds me- man, you're not gonna believe what Sam and Jack were up to!”
Dean glanced over at him again. He seemed to be holding something back. But Dean wasn’t sure what Cas’ manager could’ve said to him that he couldn’t tell him. He decided against pushing the matter, still feeling slightly uneasy at having been caught staring.
“What was I supposed to do?!” Dean continued.
“It’s all good to go. The decorations are done. Food’s ready. Everyone should be here in half an hour. Dean won’t be back for another hour. We’re right on schedule.” Sam replied, sighing as he leaned against the counter. It had been a tiring day.
“You still got together though,” He countered, gesturing at the two of them.
Dean nodded. “Okay. Well then. I guess we gotta start house hunting.”
Cas smiled again.
Dean considered it for a moment, before slowly responding.
He bolted up from his horizontal position, and started pacing around his darkened bedroom. He contemplated talking to Sam.
you can talk to him about it once we get back
Before Dean could answer, Cas intervened.
Taking a moment to recover, Dean finally cleared his throat and began to ponder.
Dean had been explaining to Cas why getting a job would be a terrible idea for the ex-angel, and then that traitor Sam had to come in being all understanding and placating. Talking about letting Cas come to terms with humanity in his own way and giving him space.
“I was jealous of Anna.”
“I-“ He let out a small chuckle, laced with disbelief. “I love you too Dean.”
Dean stood silent for a moment, opening and closing his mouth in search of a response. He hadn’t whipped out all the bells and whistles, sure. But he hadn’t wanted to overwhelm the guy on his first date for crying out loud. He turned to Cas defensively as he tried to speak.
“Pick another fun one like the Crowley thing.” Dean cut in. He received a glare that had him chuckling.
“Not- not like a brother?” Cas asked.
After a moment he cleared his throat loudly. Dean immediately looked away from Cas to glare at his brother, heart-eyes now gone.
Happy?
“I was looking for you guys! Everyone’s missing you.” He replied defensively.
Dean breathed in deeply, exhaling just as hard.
“And you don’t think he loves you back?” Jack questioned, sounding genuinely perplexed.
“Dean, he’s talking about the gift you gave me.” His tone was genuine, almost sad.
He suddenly jumped up from his chair.
“The day we met,” Cas responded, the smile audible even in his voice.
“I’m going to look for another way... I have to” Cas responded seriously.
“I don’t think the Empty will be happy. But surely it can’t come after Jack with everything going on with Billie right now. So we should be alright there.” Sam continued energetically as if Dean hadn’t said anything.
Dean sighed, tilting his head up at the ceiling. “Thanks, that’s reassuring.” Without even looking at Cas, he could sense his very pointed and expressive eye-roll across from him.
“That bastard hit you with a spell, there’s no way you’re fine.” Dean said gruffly, glaring out at the road as he drove.
Cas squinted slightly in amusement.
“I think I have an idea.”
He again attempted to search out a happy memory, but with their lives, it was tough to do so.
“Are you mad?” Cas finally asked, his voice soft.
Dean felt the air knock out of his lungs, as his chest constricted.
Dean leaned forward, resting his arms on the top of the car slightly.
“Woah there buddy I don’t think Sam needs to hear about that” Dean quickly blurted out, placing an arm over Castiel’s shoulders.
Dean sat down on his bed. He breathed in.
“Oh! Oh, nothing.” Jack smiled tightly at Dean. It wasn’t convincing, and Dean’s face said as much. However, he didn’t press for answers.
Sam sat in the bunker library, reading. He felt conflicted. Everyday him and Eileen grew closer, but it felt wrong to feel that way, when his brother was in so much pain. To be... in love; as he was beginning to realise; when his best friend was gone, the man his brother loved was gone. It felt selfish. He pondered while starring at the book in front of him, until the bunker entrance swung open, interrupting his thoughts.
“Good morning Sam.” He glanced over and nodded.
“Really?” That seemed to have been the right thing to say. Cas' tone sounded a lot more hopeful than it had a moment ago, much to Sam’s relief.
“What uh- what did you think when I first gave it to you?” Dean asked vaguely.
“What if I felt that way?”
“What’s so funny?” He gruffly asked.
“A family dinner. The four of us. Somewhere nice.” He responded as if he were reading off a list, or a script.
“Come on. Just. Please”
It still wasn’t easy. But easier. To talk. To let himself feel things.
And so he did.
His train of thought was interrupted by Castiel’s response.
He hurried away to the bathroom. Maybe he was just tired and delirious. Maybe it was just in his head and once went on a run and took a shower he’d be feeling back to normal.
He attempted to sound light and understanding, but even he could hear how pathetic that last sentence sounded. At least they were nearly back to the bunker. He could escape the awkward conversation soon enough.
“Hello Jack, how was-“
Sam attempted to think quickly. Jack was going to be very upset with him if he screwed up Dean’s surprise party. Even more so, he shuddered at the idea of how pissed loved-up-constantly-doting-on-Dean Cas would be if Sam spoiled the surprise.
He finally took in a breath and walked up to the fridge. Cas noticed him then.
“How?! Why did it take this long I-“
He didn’t sound convinced.
“Because it was honestly getting a bit ridiculous. Seriously Cas, every time something happens to you, he’s a mess. You should’ve seen him after purgatory.” Sam shook his head as he continued. “But that’s not even the worst of it, the worst is the pining. Do you guys know you have a bit of a staring problem? I mean no offence but-“
As soon as he left, they could talk about… whatever this was.
“I mean, well yeah- I guess we were.”
They were silent again for a few miles of road.
“What do you think, is she being straight with us?”
Not even the first time that’s happened to him.
“Okay maybe not. But I don’t think this is like that, I think this is about us.”
Dean looked back and forth between Cas and Sam with a frown trying to figure out what he’d missed, but before he could say anything Sam spoke up.
“No I mean- They aren’t actually together. They aren’t a couple.” Sam responded almost apologetically.
As footsteps interrupted his internal grumbling, he dropped his now empty beer bottle down on the table.
Dean put his beer down on the kitchen counter, glancing up at Castiel who’d just walked through the kitchen door. Dean shrugged in response.
“You don’t think he was acting off?” Dean questioned incredulously, pointing his beer bottle in the direction of a long-gone Jack.
Wanting to put Dean out of his apparent discomfort he spoke up. “I guess we’ll find out as we uncover Jack and Sam’s scheme more.” He offered. Shifting the subject back to the plan at hand.
Softly and slowly, to make up for all the years of lost time. For the hundred times he should’ve done it before. He could taste the tears streaming down both their faces, feel the other mans stubble under his hands, feel his all-too-human heart beating against his own thumping chest.
“I didn’t keep her number.“ He fiddled with his beer bottle, unsure why he’d felt the need to clarify. He suddenly felt very warm and cursed himself internally. It’s not like Cas cared, it made no sense to bring it up.
“I- Of course- Dean I-”
“That can’t be right.” Dean cut in. “There’s four of us.”
Dean choked slightly. “You- you- you know?”
Silence permeated the room. He glanced up at Cas who was looking at him with a furrowed brow, an uncertain expression on his face.
“Tell me about it.”
He met eyes with Castiel through the rearview mirror for a second. Cas gave him a small smile before looking away out the window.
“Come on D-“ Sam was cut off as Dean shouldered past him, coughing strangely as soon as he turned away.
He hadn’t said any of that. And so he sat outside the damn Gas N Sip.
He still couldn’t believe it at times. That Cas was back, Cas was okay. He’d taken to looking over at him regularly just to make sure he was still there.
“When you took me to that brothel.”
“I don’t know Jack, fingers crossed it's going well.” He considered further. “We probably shouldn’t get too hopeful though. It might not work straight away.”
Dean could swear he saw a subtle smirk grace Castiel’s face only for his expression to straighten out again. He ignored it and turned his attention to the road, growing more embarrassed by the second.
Cas squinted up at Sam. The man in the driver’s seat had the signs of a smirk threatening to break out, but aside from that, he said nothing further. Cas decided to revert his attention back to his phone, though he did so more sheepishly this time.
“Caslovesme” he blurted out, his face turning red.
He sat there internally cursing Sam for a moment. The kid had no idea what he was talking about. He decided to ignore whatever the hell it was Sam had been referring to for most of that conversation.
Sam had kept himself busy enough back at the bunker though, despite being a bit sulky after the scolding.
“Oh uh- Jack wasn’t feeling well- Nothing bad!” He exclaimed much too loudly when the other two looked at him with concern. “I think he might have his first cold or something. So he went to bed and I stayed in case he needed anything.” Sam quickly finished.
“It’s important. I need to speak to you. Alone.” He breathed in slowly, pointedly not looking at anyone else in the room.
Sam had always had questions about their ‘profound bond’ but he hadn’t prodded too much or spent too long thinking about it. He figured if there was something there they’d eventually realise it. But hearing it. Being in the middle of it.
Dean glanced at Cas again, nervously. The man in the backseat was now looking at Dean with his head tilted in confusion.
As she rang up his items he glanced around the store again. “Hey, have you seen Cas around?”
Instead he just picked up another beer and joined Cas at the table again. He opted for a slight topic change.
“So whadya say?” He beamed at the man before him.
“Oh wow. Um- wow.”
The silence was heavy. Dean heard himself breathe out. His head rang. He couldn’t form any coherent thought in that moment so he just answered.
At that, Dean stepped away from Cas. Sam could tell they both instantly felt the absence of each other.
“No, you two should stay here in case Billie returns, besides you probably should stay and figure out how to update Amara on this plan. We’ll be fine on our own.”
Dean meets one of Cas' coworkers.
Dean glanced up at him nervously at that.
“Where are you going?” Dean stumbled after him.
Cas only gave him a lost look in response.
“But um yes, you asked him to- and I- Well I’m here now” he finished quickly.
“So. I hear you want to alter our-“ Billie tilted her head in amusement “-my plan against Chuck.”
Cas’ expression softened. He looked at Dean so adoringly it sort of made Sam’s heart melt. Finally, he looked over at Sam and spoke.
“Thank you Dean.”
A sudden rush of bravery overwhelmed him, he felt bolder. Perhaps it was actually seeing Cas upset that did it. After weeks of him speculating about how Cas was feeling, actually knowing. Cas was hurt, and it was because of Dean. He had to make it right.
“How?! We’ve killed the witch, the curse should be gone!” Dean barked in frustration.
They drove in silence, but he didn’t let go of Cas’ hand for the rest of the drive.
He nodded gravely at Cas, who rolled his eyes in return.
“How I f-“
“Dean, you’re not ‘too much'". I’ve told you how I feel about spending time with you. That still stands.” He squinted slightly as he continued.
“Decent work Castiel.” Billie nodded at him approvingly after a few seconds, before shifting to a more critical tone. “But, your plan has some flaws. The remnants of spell you found leave some key elements out.”
“Um. It’s about Cas. He made some sort of deal with the Empty.” Dean started.
Sam cursed internally. The one surprise party was already enough work, he wasn’t sure he and Jack could plan two simultaneously without Dean or Cas finding out.
"I'm always fine." He smiled up at Cas knowingly, a tragic sort of humour dancing behind his eyes. Cas looked back, his expression pained.
“I’m a friend of his? My name’s Dean, he-”
Cas looked around nervously. This conversation seemed like it wasn’t going to end with a happy Dean.
“I understand Dean.”
“Anyways I think I’ve got something on this ghoul.”
Realising it was his turn he wracked his brain again, his face pinched in concentration.
“I’m glad, and I’m sorry. I’m sure the last few days have been... odd” Cas smiled at him embarrassedly.
Dean’s smile immediately dropped and he glared up at the ceiling.
This time he finally looked up to smile directly at Dean. An all too innocent smile. Maybe it was time to rethink putting off those plans.
Sam continued on before Dean could even process, let alone respond to the jab. “Anyways. Cas, how was babysitting?”
So sue him, he liked hanging out with his best friend. Hardly a crime.
Before he could get a response there was a disturbance at the other end of the table.
“You’re not pregnant are you?” He asked Dean, with the best serious expression he could muster.
Cas looked at him questioningly for a moment before realization hit, and his face straightened out.
When the two men continued to stare at him, he added on. “Why are you back so early?” That finally took their focus off of him.
Dean frowned back, however Sam didn’t seem to notice as he continued on.
He was still having trouble with all the- feelings- stuff. Telling Cas he loved him? Yeah sure, he’d finally been able to do that. Losing him again had drawn that out of Dean. But at any given moment he was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Dean reached for it, letting go of Cas’ hand to unwrap the gift. Occasionally looking up at him curiously as he did so. He discarded the silver wrapping paper on the counter next to them.
“Didn’t think what Cas?” Dean responded, no anger in his voice, just sadness. “That I wouldn’t want you back? That every day here hasn’t been hell? Knowing what I know? Knowing that you-“ He looked away, not wanting to break.
Cas looked at Dean knowingly.
Dean sat stiff in his seat, waiting for Cas to continue. Scared for it too.
He lay awake most of the night.
Castiel looked back at him as if he were in pain.
“You’re no help you know that?” Dean muttered as Sam got him all the way out of his room.
“I did work at that Gas’n’Sip for a while Dean.” Cas offered, clearly still confused by the line of questioning.
How far away are you guys?
“I mean you know. Us being like- You know.” He flickered his gaze over to Cas only to find him squinting back, his expression unreadable. At this point, his mouth was operating on auto-pilot, his brain buzzing with static. This was not going how he’d planned.
“Oh. The store clerk?” He asked carefully as if didn’t seem to understand where Dean was going with the topic. Dean didn’t either.
“Are you done?” Cas finally muttered, heat visibly rising to his cheeks. He was finally looking in Dean’s direction, though no less crabby.
Cas sighed, glancing up at Dean with furrowed brows. But ultimately he decided to let it go - for the moment - and humour him. He couldn't fix everything going on, but what he could do was make Dean smile. That was enough for the time being.
“Hello Dean.”
“What’s happening, where are you going?” He questioned. Cas was always leaving. Why was he always leaving? Was this about their fight earlier? Had he pushed him away again?
He breathed in and kept going. “You know... when- when Jack was born, and Lucifer killed you. That’s the first time I actually knew. Or maybe it was the first time I admitted it to myself I don’t know man. But I knew then. And I was happy just knowing and never getting to have it because how could anyone love-, especially an angel- especially you-“ he cut himself off. He’d been more careful about the way he spoke of himself lately. Cas had told him he was worthy of love, and he wanted to believe it so bad, or at least be try being that person.
“Great! I’ll tell Sam! He can pick a place.”
Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes.
When he looked up again he saw Cas pulling a small rectangular gift-wrapped object out of his trenchcoat. He slowly lifted it up to Dean. He looked nervous.
Sam smiled slightly at him, a smirk threatening to come through.
Dean snorted, however, his cheeks reddened slightly, and he glanced around haphazardly at the insinuation.
He turned off the ignition.
A wave of relief flooded through Sam, as he fell onto the ground out of the witches magical grasp.
“Sorry- Don’t mean to be intrusive. There just isn’t much to talk about around here, and everyone thinks you guys are really cute. Though Cas never really lets up much when it comes to information.” She rolled her eyes and sighed exaggeratedly, flicking her short, dark, bob back as she spoke animatedly, bagging his items all the while.
However, the angel’s expression had Dean immediately falling apart again. The howling continued on for another stretch of time. He gripped onto the cotton of his shirt tightly, attempting to push down the ache that was now developing in his stomach from laughing.
Dean coughed awkwardly. “Uh- Yeah. Um- maybe. Should we uh go back to the store and- No that’s- Nevermind.” He seemed to have lost any coherent train of thought all of sudden.
Sam looked up from his laptop at Castiel. He hadn’t heard the angel approach. Cas stood awkwardly in the doorway, fidgeting slightly. His eyes were scanning either side of the hallway as if he were looking out for someone.
“Yeah, and? What’s the big deal?” He had given up on the forgetful charade.
“Why wouldn’t he?” Sam asked, confused. His brow furrowed.
“You really think Billie’s going to help us with this? She hates us.” Dean scoffed. “Besides I don’t think the Empty’s the negotiating type.”
“Any of them ever mention that to you?”
“I like it.”
“Not yet kid” Dean replied quickly.
Forgetting his earlier train of thought, Cas followed.
“Mindy? Why did she give you her number? Were you two flirting?” The disapproval in Jack’s tone did not go unnoticed.
Dean responded immediately.
“Do you think they’ll ever stop?” He sighed, tilting his head over towards Cas.
Dean frowned at Cas from across the map table.
“I’m so proud of you Dean. And I- I support you.” He said, before continuing on quickly, “And Cas. I’m so glad you can be yourself openly now.” His eyes were wide and genuine as he nodded at Dean. He also seemed nervous, as if he was afraid of saying something wrong, his hands raised slightly as if to sooth Dean.
“Boyfriend?” He questioned. He hadn’t meant for his voice to take on that slightly squeaky quality at the end, however, he had more pressing matters to consider. He stared at her wide eyed as she sighed at him.
Dean glanced sideways at Cas, widening his eyes incredulously. He gestured at Cas to stay where he was when he started to move towards the door. “Going out to dinner… like we do every Friday night,” Dean emphasised the words.
Dean sat at the map table fidgeting.
“Right now,” Cas finally stated.
Finally, he took out his wallet, folding the photo and placing it in there for the time being. With that and the mixtape, he now had two possessions Dean had given him, he thought fondly to himself as he followed Dean's trail out the door.
“Cas that night. When I heard you talking to Jack about the deal. I heard more than just that. I heard you tell him about- well- the thing about me. I know why it would trigger the whole- the Empty thing.” He managed to sputter out.
No matter what they did around him - bar certain things which would mentally scar Sam for life - he didn’t seem to react any differently. He’d shoot that same old annoying smirk at them, sure. But he’d always done that.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” It was out of his mouth before he could stop himself. He hadn't meant to say anything yet.
Sam furrowed his brow before his face jumped into realisation. “Oh-OH!... I... Well- I’m never sitting in the back of the Impala again.”
*Click*
Sam stared back at him. “Nope.” He replied, deadpan. It wasn’t their fault he could hear their thoughts, but he couldn’t help but be irritated at them for the inconvenience.
“I don’t know man.” Dean uneasily replied. His heart was racing again. This all felt like playing with fire. He was scared of his own... feelings. Yes. But he was also worried for Cas. Dean didn’t want to be the cause of something bad happening to him. He also knew that Sam and him didn’t know enough about the deal to figure out a way to fight it on their own. Especially not while they were also trying to deal with Chuck. This couldn’t have come at a worse time.
“Chucks dead, I got ma baby, I got ma pie. What else could I need?” Dean grinned back at Sam, his smile tight, not quite reaching his eyes.
“Good luck.”
Things seemed to have worked out pretty well due to his meddling.
Cas tilted his head confusedly at that. “Sam that’s not how-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas and Dean struggle with how to let Sam know about their relationship. Turns out they don’t need to worry too much.
Either way, she and Cas had become friends. Which; Cas had insisted that was all they were. Despite Dean’s teasing to the contrary, for some reason that came as a relief.
“You could put it in your room if you want, I know you don’t have much stuff in there. I mean unless you think it’s weird to put a picture of yourself up in- But yeah I thought you’d want it so-“ He swallowed “Good. Now you have it.” He finished abruptly, patting Cas on the shoulder and moving through the doorway.
They both went silent for a moment. Then that moment turned into a few minutes. Sam grew worried.
Okay I’m sorry. You don’t suck.
At that moment Sam walked back in. “Ribs been put aw- what’s going on guys?”
“The mixtape?” Castiel questioned with a squint.
“Okay then.” Dean responded, breathing out in relief. He decided to not read too much into that.
“You know- that thing you said before the Empty-“ Dean’s chest tightened slightly at the mention of that terrible moment, sadness creeping in. Though he still overwhelmingly felt nervous and uneasy at the conversation taking place.
In that moment Dean regretted having gone through with the whole ‘spitting in Sam’s smoothie’ plan the previous day.
Despite the subject change, the energy in the room had once again transformed as it had in the kitchen the other day. It seemed to be happening more and more.
Dean grinned back and then attempted (and failed) to straighten his face. “Uh yeah sure Sammy...” The grin only widened.
Dean nodded in acknowledgement. Thank God for that. Turns out having Sam around had been serving as quite the anti-awkwardness buffer with all the weirdness he and Cas had going on lately. Dean hadn't necessarily realised that until the overgrown Sasquatch had left on this last hunt.
As he placed the photo in the box, he made a mental note to himself to have the one of Dean printed. It could take the place of the old image in his wallet. Having it around would fill him with some contentment.
Silence stretched out. They just stared at each other.
“What he’s trying to say is, we’ve found another way. Your plan, but with some changes to keep Jack alive.” Sam interjected firmly.
He reminded Dean of Bobby sometimes. Not so much in the surly old drunk way. More so in the way he was able to manage and aid various hunters who had taken to coming to him for guidance and calling him for help. He made a good leader. He’d practically started running his own ‘Hunter Corp’ like the other world versions of themselves.
“Hi,” Dean responded. It sounded like a question.
He couldn’t wipe the cheesy smile off his face no matter how hard he tried. He made his way down the rest of the steps.
“We enjoy spending that time together.” Cas stated plainly.
But more importantly, even if they could. It wouldn’t be Dean; he was too broken in the parts Cas was good.
Cas turned his head away from the laptop in front of them, facing Dean with a tilted head and confused expression.
“Okay fine. But if I must, then you have to as well.” He raised his brows tauntingly, waiting for Dean to drop the matter.
“No!” Dean cut in suddenly, looking no less frazzled, but very sure of his response. He breathed out and looked around as if searching for some saving grace. Cas continued to stare at him, waiting for an explanation. He was glaring slightly. Honestly, he never enjoyed Dean’s attempts at pawning him off to various waitstaff.
Dean glared daggers at him.
He wondered whether Cas had been wanting to pull back from him all this time, and that their conversation about boundaries had finally allowed him to do so. The thought pulled at his chest, sending a painful feeling stabbing through it. He hoped that he was wrong.
All that, and Dean had given him nothing. He frowned to himself.
“I’m helping you with this altered spell. Be grateful I am allowing that much Dean.” Billie responded. There was no anger in her tone but it was threatening nonetheless.
“Should we ask Jack and Sam to come along?” That snapped Dean out of his nervous spiral all of a sudden.
Sam sighed. He paused for a second, seeming to struggle with what he wanted to say next.
“I’ll go get more details from Sam.”
The three dots flickered, disappearing again after a moment. That happened twice more before Cas sent through another text.
Though, later, as he pulled his keys out of his pocket to go pick Cas up, he mentally reminded himself of the list anyways. With a sigh he left the bunker and made his way back to the store for the second time that day.
“What is it Sam?” Cas asked with an unashamed hint of annoyance, an inquisitorial frown on his face.
With a sigh Sam headed downstairs, contemplating whether it was appropriate to tell him he'd just caught his two dads making out at the door.
Cas and Dean glanced at each other for a moment before Cas spoke up.
“I need to talk to you.” He stated, staring ahead at Billie.
“Morning kid” Dean mumbled back half heartedly.
“Did you play it out of a boom box the first time or-?” Sam muttered under his breath teasingly, his tone light, clearly not malicious.
“That works!” Dean bounced up from the couch to grab the game.
“Hey man, come on, leave him alone.” He chastised Dean.
“There were.”
“Oh,” was all he had to say in response.
“Hey!” Dean replied in mock outrage. “I thought you were having fun.”
Sam stepped forward. A hint of impatience seeped in his tone. “Dean, they’ll be back. We have other things to focus on right now.” He raised his hands placatingly at his brother.
He finally processed the appearance of the two men before him properly. Disheveled didn’t even begin to describe it.
“Pie.” Cas suddenly cut in again. “You were berating them over their lack of pie.” He spoke emphatically.
Cas glanced at Sam shaking his head fondly.
“Yeah, I’ve been hearing all about your gifts Dean.” He coughed out, his tone teasing.
He was so screwed.
“What?”
He’d been thinking about it for years now. Though not necessarily allowing himself to factor Cas into the equation. But he had been toying with the idea of what retirement would be like for a while. Of finding some peace eventually.
“Nice get up Professor” Dean had muttered after Cas had returned from his shopping trip with Sam and changed into his bookish new outfit.
Cas tilted his head. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Cas only chuckled in response, shaking his head at Dean fondly as they got inside the car and Dean started up the ignition.
“Reservations?”
“Dean, I’m getting a job.” He had stated, for what felt like the dozenth time that week.
At that, both Dean and Cas straightened up, blinking at Sam in disbelief. He sat there looking back at both of them with concern. He wondered whether the years of head injuries had finally caught up to his brother.
“I didn’t tell you. I should’ve told you. Every time you left- were gone-“ Dean’s voice broke slightly. “I was falling apart. Hell, ask Sammy, he had to carry my sorry ass through it.”
As the night went on he made his way through the room, talking to everyone, accepting their birthday wishes. He ate, he drank, he ate some more. The birthday pie was the highlight of the latter activity. When he told Sam as much he had a confusingly guilty-seeming reaction in response. Who knew what that was about.
“Sorry?” Lee queried.
“It’s not funny, I just uh- Can I see it?” Sam  continued to press down a smile and looked up at Cas with raised brows.
“No.”
“Yeah Jack. We’re good.”
“When you walked into that lake- with the Leviathan. I didn’t realise it then but, yeah I was- You know.” He looked down quickly. It wasn’t a good memory.
Dean had only begun to think about nipping Cas’ bottom lip lightly, when suddenly the bunker door swung open with a loud creak and the two men went stumbling backwards onto a large figure.
It had been weird when Sam and Jack had insisted that they drive separately to the restaurant. But he had figured he could question them more once they got here since they’d remained tight-lipped back at the bunker.
“No. I’m done with your cases. I don’t trust your cases. From now on we’re only going on cases I find.” Dean walked back into the room shaking his head, facing away from Sam.
He tried swallowing away the bitter taste in his mouth.
“You lookin’ for something?” Dean questioned, tilting his head toward the closet. He averted his gaze from Cas’ more exposed than usual form.
Cas shook his head fondly at Dean before continuing.
The animosity definitely had nothing to do with the fact that he was maybe a little jealous of Nora.
He tried to follow along with Jack and Castiel’s conversation, but it only seemed to get more confusing. What did the Empty have to do with Cas’ happiness? Why wasn’t Cas happy? Their lives weren’t perfect, but having Cas around definitely made him happier. He had thought maybe Cas felt similarly. God- he sounded like a school girl with a crush.
The words filled Dean with further relief. He smiled to himself watching Cas walk back over to the car door opposite where Jack sat.
“Jack, I assure you Dean does not feel the same way. The love you see from him, it’s-  it’s familial. And that’s why we don’t need to worry about the deal. I do thank you for trying to make me feel better through.” Cas managed to respond.
“You didn’t make me uncomfortable.”  He settled on that.
“Not fair, I said the last one.” He shook his head, grabbing his forgotten beer bottle off of the table and taking a sip. He had to admit, he was extremely curious to see where this would go.
“Really?”
Cas eyed the bottle disapprovingly but didn’t say anything. He continued to fiddle with the mixtape. He held it in his hands running his thumbs over the writing on the front. It seemed as if he found it comforting.
At that he surprisingly got a laugh from Cas.
“Was it?” Dean scoffed.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Dean snapped.
“Me? I’m fine, why you askin?” Dean jumped slightly and responded quickly, clearing his throat. He wondered if he’d been staring at Cas too long.
“No, I-.” Dean sighed, looking up to the low ceiling of the room almost pleadingly.
Dean breathed in as he moved his hand up to gently and tentatively stroke the other man’s cheek with his thumb. The rest of his fingers lightly brushed against Castiel’s hair. He surprised himself with the movement, but let it happen. This time he spoke out louder, though his voice wavered with emotion.
“Yeah yeah, stop being snippy. Just because I won at mini-golf.”
“You done playing with the rocks kid?” Dean muttered as he walked up behind him.
“I don’t know, I just-” He sighed lightly to himself. How was he supposed to word this without sounding like some kind of insecure teenager?
“I appreciate it Dean.”
They kill the witch. But can they break the curse?
He wasn’t given a chance to respond, however, as footsteps thudded down the hall. Cas and Dean both glanced up at the entryway, as a frazzled looking Jack hurried in.
As he strode towards the stairs leading down to the common area, the bunker lit up.
“Learnt to drive as an angel.” He heard Sam mutter to himself between chuckles as he walked away.
Dean finds it hard to believe good things can happen. Can he be blamed when there's so much on the line?
“You guys finally sorted it out!” He beamed. His eyes were soft and he was looking at Dean with what looked like pride.
“That’s what we gotta figure out.” Dean pointed at him again with his bottle. His face conspiratorial.
“Hello Sam” Cas replied with a wide smile.
Castiel’s expression softened, slight surprise in his eyes. “Of course Dean.”
“Let me finish, please man, I-“ Dean swallowed. “The thing that made you different. Made all the other angels so afraid of you, made them wanna change you-” Venom coated the last two words, with memories of Naomi flashing through his mind. “You always had a bit of humanity in you Cas, it’s what made you special, it’s what made you able to love. It’s what made me-“
“Your room. Hurry up.”
Deeming that an appropriate apology, he responded.
Dean’s gaze attempted to flicker past Cas. However, his friend's eyes locked him in place, unable to move, to look away.
Sam continued to look at him assessingly.
“Or how about we try to find a game you might be good at?” Dean sat up from his slumped position with raised eyebrows, waving the bottle in his hand in Castiel’s direction as he spoke.
“You have a condition?” Dean asked, slightly incredulous, his brows raised. He had been expecting an instant yes and an excited Cas. Not so much a negotiation. He grew slightly nervous, wondering what the condition could be.
Before Dean could try and fail to casually enquire about Castiel’s whereabouts, Jack’s eyes widened, and his spoon plopped into the cereal bowl.
“You don’t need to worry about me”. He continued when he saw Dean open his mouth to begin to argue again.
“Does this mean I’m still winning?” Jack interjected, a wide grin on his face. While the kid wasn’t a sore loser by any means, he did seem to receive unbridled joy whenever he was in the lead during any of their game nights. It wasn’t so much the winning that seemed to cause this, as much as it was impressing his dads. Sam made sure to always respond with enthusiasm at each of Jack’s wins.
“Right. We all know how messy spreading peanut butter on bread can get.” Sam muttered under his breath.
She smiled at him in an unamused manner. “Yes, I guess I am.”
“Jack, not everything from pop culture is accurate to real life. Some things are just friendly gestures.” The hint of sadness in his tone did not go undetected by either Sam or Jack.
Sam rolled his eyes in response, muttering something unintelligible under his breath. Impressed? Suppressed? Something sounding like that. Dean couldn’t make it out.
He stared back and forth between the two flannel shirts laying on his bed. It was ridiculous. It was just dinner. He was going to dinner with his friend. Something he’d done many times - more than ever before in recent days. Why was he being so weird about it?
He didn’t know why, but he suddenly had a renewed sense of purpose. They should talk about it. Whatever happened, happened. But at least it would be out in the open. If not it would drive him mad.
“I really thought you would’ve gotten the hang of Scrabble Cas” Sam stated sadly, his tone much too innocent. He shook his head in overstated remorse.
“Jeez okay, you looked confused.”
Now, when they’d had that initial discussion he’d assumed his brother would figure it out on his own that day, or maybe the next. Within the week at the most.
Jack looked practically giddy as he mulled over the idea. “And that means we get to go to the beach!” He added on excitedly. Sam couldn’t help but chuckle.
He inwardly cursed Sam and Jack and whatever they were up to. If he hadn’t been alone with Cas so often it wouldn’t have been an issue. But whatever it was they were up to, meant that the feelings he had surrounding Cas were becoming harder to ignore. He had decided it was all their fault.
“Yeah I’m pretty sure I never said anything about wanting to walk in on you two dry humping like teenagers... in a room full of historical and magical artefacts by the way.”
“I guess I’m just not cut out for some human leisure activities” Cas suggested too innocuously, with an out of character shrug. Sam did not seem satiated, though he let it go for the moment, reaching over to grab another slice of pizza.
Dean is a mess but we love him anyway. And what did Nora say to poor ol Cas?
He decided that was as far down that rabbit hole he wanted his mind to go. Thankfully, that thought arrived just as he pulled up to the store.
Dean could feel the heat rising to his cheeks. He was starting to grow frustrated. What was the big deal? He was doing a nice thing. Driving his friend to work. And instead of praise, he was receiving an inquisition over it.
While the blue eyes piercing into him definitely did affect his already concerning heart rate, they also steadied him somewhat. Due to  that, he eyed the gap between their lips.
“Well you had a fun time at that third place, so I thought- Nevermind I-”
Sam was experiencing a moment of déjà vu. It looked like he wasn’t done being involuntarily dragged into his brother and his brother’s boyfriend’s schemes.
“We’re gonna get you out of this, okay? We’re gonna find you a way out of the deal that won’t put Jack in danger. You’re gonna get to be happy without worrying about some bastard cosmic entity taking you away for it.” Dean could feel his throat closing up as he said it, the words becoming more and more strained.
He couldn’t- wouldn’t name it.
“Not even close,” Dean replied as he wiped a tear away from his eye. But as he responded he finally straightened up to look at Cas. Dean’s smug grin only further engraved the frown on the other man’s face. But he still couldn’t help a remaining chuckle or two continue to escape him.
“Really? You would become human? Even after how it was the last time?” Dean asked hesitantly. Guilt stabbing through him again.
Jesus christ. This was going all wrong again. Dean wondered if he should pull over to the side of the road. Having a heart attack while driving and veering into oncoming traffic didn’t seem like a great way to go. He felt his throat closing up.
“Say what?” Cas asked, seemingly not daring to raise his hopes up again.
Anytime he had entertained otherwise, reality subsequently crashed down on him. When Cas would leave, over and over. When Cas would be hurt, damaged, all because of him. He’d kick himself for even thinking it was a possibility.
Cas merely nodded, not looking up.
Cas nodded formally.
“Wait what?” Dean inquired, suddenly pulled out of his emotions.
Sure he’d been pacing and huffing outside the storage room for about fifteen minutes  now. But he was just preparing himself.
“He makes a mess, it’s better if the kitchen stuff is left to me.” Dean snapped irritably before his brother had a chance to make snarky remarks.
“At the time... not necessarily.” He paused as if to consider it. “It was more so about the very humanness of it. I didn’t think I could have that… among other things” He looked over at Dean softly with that, only to receive an equally tender look in return.
Jack glanced up and raised his brows in confusion; having not paid enough attention to hear Dean’s chastising. Dean only rolled his eyes and gestured for Jack to follow him out of the small store. He gently grabbed the stone from Jack’s hand and began to place it back on the shelf.
Then, Cas reached over and placed a reassuring hand on Dean’s arm where it rested on the table. It at least seemed to stop the fidgeting. However, with that over, Dean was staring wide eyed at their point of contact.
“I’m sorry man. I didn’t want to put you in danger. But looks like I couldn’t even manage that.” Dean muttered out, slight anger lacing his tone.
Bombs are dropped.
Cas frowned. “Too much?”
“Cas. I know you said Sam and Dean don’t need to know about it. But- but what if the Empty does come for you? What will I tell them? What will I do without you?” Jack questioned, his voice soft, confused.
“Dean I-“ He sighed and stepped to the side. Facing slightly away from Dean.
“Hey, guys. How’s it- Uh how’s it going?” Sam smiled unconvincingly.
And so, he was determined to talk about it- this- whatever it was.
“Cas?!” Sam shouted after him. He gained no response as Cas hurried away quickly.
“I’ve always been direct.”
Three days had passed. Dean hadn’t had a chance to speak to Cas yet. But not because he was avoiding him.
Castiel’s eyes widened.
“Please?” Jack pleaded. Dean pleaded silently alongside him. He needed to know. For some reason this now seemed like the most important thing in the world. The world which, might be ending soon. Even so, the idea of something out there that Cas wanted and thought he couldn’t have. It hurt. Cas deserved to be happy, why couldn’t he be happy? Why shouldn’t he have whatever it was?
He paced around his room, much like a few nights ago when he’d been contemplating talking to Sam. Like that time his patience with himself was wearing thin.
“Sammy stay in the damn car.” He gruffly pulled his little brother down to the passenger seat again before stepping back out.
“I guess that ain’t too bad of an idea.”
Dean’s breath froze for a moment, he dropped his hand and his eyes locked onto the man in front of him.
“Though I hope you know now it’s not nice to lock people in rooms and leave them in there for various lengths of time.” He chastised lightly.
Dean continue to avoid eye contact.
The Empty.
“Well, I’m off to bed. Goodnight Sam. Goodnight Dean.” He nodded briefly at both of them before retreating. The brothers called out their respective goodbyes to him.
“I- There were a lot of songs about love on it. Because that’s what-“ Dean sighed.
Dean paused, staring at the oceanic eyes before him. They were soft and gentle, and he felt like they were gazing into his soul. Perhaps they were, after all, no one had ever been able to see him as clearly as Cas had.
He tilted his head slightly, confused. “Yes. Why is that funny?”
“Are you gonna keep interrupting me?”
It was as they pulled up to the bunker, that Cas finally spoke.
“We did not play Yahtzee in heaven, it is true” Cas responded formally, his tone was stiffer than usual.
“Wait what did you do in my room?” Sam frowned up at Cas with a suddenly haunted expression.
Dean considered pushing him out the door and locking him out.
Dean chuckled at him, shaking his head. There wasn’t any humour in it. He felt tense for a reason he couldn’t quite place.
Cas and Dean looked up at him from their seats at the table with concern.
Dean’s face softened. Of course he hadn’t forgotten. He almost wanted to say as much to get that sad look off of Castiel’s face.
Dean waved his hand dismissively. “Nothing bad, he’s just been- I don’t know- weird. He was asking me all these questions about why I was flirting with the chick at the store. Then he just ran off to Sam as soon as we got back, I don’t know.” He picked up his bottle, taking a sip.
Dean threw his pillow. It thudded against the quickly closing door and fell.
Cas huffed out a similar laugh after considering what Dean had said. “I’m not necessarily unhappy.”
“Cas are you okay?!” His voice was rough and panicked. He helped the angel up to his feet.
“Hey man, you know that I- you know I-support you right? It’s all-“
“The blonde chick, she seemed pretty cozy.” He huffed out a strained laugh. “She was whispering something to you.” He attempted to keep the possessiveness out of his tone.
“Great. Awesome.”
Dean breathed in deeply.
“I- I know man I just. I just wanna help Jack, and kill Chuck and then we can get Cas out of that damn deal. I don’t want- if he-.” He struggled.
Dean just frowned at his confused brother as Cas shook his head at Dean fondly.
“Keep it PG okay, Jack and I are still here.” He warned before getting in the car.
“It was clear as day in my head. But I couldn’t say it. He was there and then he wasn’t and he saw me Sammy. He saw and he loved me anyway, and I couldn’t say it.” Dean spat out the last words. His throat constricted, more straining to come out but unable. He glanced up to the sky trying to stop the already there tears.
In fact, he’d decided to not bring it up at all, after all, he didn’t want Cas to think he had a problem driving him around. He already had the newly human thing to deal with. Dean didn't want to make him feel like a burden on top of that.
“I. Um. It’s.” Cas fumbled over his words. Suddenly uncomfortable? No. Not uncomfortable. Scared?
Dean sighed, looking off to the side in mock annoyance. “Already a pain in my ass and we haven’t even moved in together yet.”
“How do you think it’s going?” Jack asked, staring at Sam expectantly.
That seemed to snap Cas out of his trance. He blinked rapidly. Before smiling up at Dean, he was practically beaming.
“Sam can do all that.” Dean snapped back, slowing his stride slightly.
“Dean” Sam interrupted his line of thought forcefully.
“-I just can’t. If I keep letting myself feel- I don’t want to put him in danger.” He barely managed to get it out.
“Alright, so not up for constructive criticism at the moment.” He grumbled under his breath, unaffected by the gesture. He chose that moment to return to his book.
Dean rolled his eyes. “It’s not his job to do that.” He huffed out defensively.
Cas smiled lightly. It was great. It was from Dean.
“There’s more. He- Jack asked him what would make him happy enough for whatever it is to happen. And-.” He rubbed the back of his neck self consciously.
Still, he didn't want to accidentally bring those issues to light again.
If Cas was mad at him or something, that at least could be resolved. But if this was just what he wanted… Dean shook his head, chasing away the thought. Today he was going to take a page out of Sammy’s book and actually communicate.
Dean thought again for a moment, not wanting to give another answer that would bring back painful memories for Cas. For either of them.
Castiel stopped in his tracks, the door part way open already.
Dean’s heart continued to pound, however, he couldn’t seem to stop the words from continuing to bubble out.
Great. Surely Cas was gonna feel bad. He probably wouldn’t let Dean drive him to work anymore either.
Sam huffed out a sigh of relief and looked up incredulously at the ceiling of his room. Of course. He should’ve known it would be something like this. For two people who’d been completely oblivious of their feelings for each other over the years, ever since it had all come out they’d been insufferably That Couple.
“Are they getting divorced?” Jack stepped forward, his voice growing more panicked.
Sam’s expression had not changed from soft and sympathetic. He knew. They’d all known. It was the perpetual unsaid non-secret. But hearing it said out loud, in this context, it broke his heart. He’d lost a friend, but Dean had lost so much more.
He blinked rapidly, trying to clear his head. Had he asked Cas on a date? He wasn’t sure anymore. What if Cas thought it was a date too? Had Dean been that obvious? Or that oblivious? But he had said yes. Did that mean-
Dean groaned. Somehow Cas being an irritating asshole was breaking his resolve more than anything. Still, Dean pushed through, this time he spoke more forcefully.
That was unexpected.
Cas tilted his head, smiling slightly. “You love me?”
Eventually, Sam interrupted.
Cas beamed back at him, before looking away off to the side. “Thank you- and- sorry also about being so obnoxious around you these past few weeks.”
When he heard Cas’ voice pipe up from right next to him, he jumped, clenching his chest as he did so. It was not his proudest hour.
Soon enough they were driving away.
Most importantly though, he had been there emotionally. It was tough for Dean, to be open and cuddly and feely. But he was trying.
At that Cas breathed in deeply, trying to relax. He smiled up at Sam thankfully. The poor guy had been freaking out all week in the lead up to the big day. That had only made him feel more guilty about the pie incident, Cas really didn't need more to be worried about.
Her eyes passed over each one of them inquisitorially as she walked up to them.
Sam and Dean blinked back in confusion.
“We did do a lot of things Sam but rest assured we are yet to have-“
“No.” Dean stated forcefully.
“Yeah, like with all the Nora stuff and the being jealous and always wanting you around-” He cut himself off, his eyes widening for a split second. That is not how he had intended for that to come out.
He sighed and responded.
With that Dean grew only more confused. He pinched his brows, attempting to understand.
“Hello Dean. Couldn’t sleep?”
“I thought you’d be happier about this Dean. We’ve finally got a plan for Cas.”
“Why not?” Cas snapped back immediately, pulling back defensively.
“Dean. Is everything okay? I was in the bunker, why did you pray?” Cas stood before him, quizzical.
“Hey, guys. Chill out.” He finally interrupted their glaring match, patting Cas on the shoulder comfortingly. He assumed that Cas was probably in the right with whatever this was.
Dean contemplated why he even wanted Cas to be acting differently. Shouldn’t he be happy at least that Cas was ignoring it? Why did he want to push things if he was clearly too afraid of talking about what they’d been dancing around? A part of him wondered if he wanted Cas to push so that he'd have no choice but to let it out into the open.
“Have you told Sam? About Jack?” Cas continued.
Sam’s mouth dropped open. “Holy shit.” He looked over at Dean wide-eyed. “That was your present! Holy shit- I- You guys-” He continued sputtering for a moment, unable to process it immediately.
It took a moment for the rib connection to click, but then, Sam suddenly coughed out in disbelief. “Wait. You mean Adam as in- Adam and Eve?”
“He wouldn’t say what. Should we-“ He hesitated slightly as if he didn’t want to say it. “Should we go back?”
‘Cas love loves me and-‘
Surprisingly to him, the male vessel thing had been easier to get over than the angel thing had.
“As much as I’m enjoying this Dean.” He breathed out. “Sam seems to be honking the horn.”
Standing up with a huff, Dean looked at his phone again.
Dean ran his fingers through his hair anxiously. “Don’t you have a run to go on or something?”
“You can’t steal mine.” Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean, though the humour behind them was apparent. That elicited a chuckle from Dean which had Cas clearly preening.
“You go first,” Cas responded.
“In what way?”
“You’ll see.”
“You already said that one. Are you out of ideas already? I’m a little insulted buddy-“ Despite a sniffle, the humour began to return to his tone, his lips quirked up slightly.
Dean took in a breath and opened the door. Cas stood inside, wearing one of Dean’s old black t-shirts, and some of his own grey sweatpants. He stepped away from the closet he’d been rummaging through.
Before he could consider further, Jack was snapped out of his thoughts by Dean’s voice directed at him. He hadn’t realised that the other two had finished their conversation.
“Hey, no!” Dean suddenly called out.
He took another deep breath and continued.
Cas narrowed his eyes at him.
Dean’s heart rate began to increase at a steady but noticeable pace. The room seemed to be a lot smaller than it had been a moment ago. Cas tilted his head and stepped forward, ocean blue eyes piercing right through Dean.
The two had been sent out to two more restaurants, a ski-rink, and a movie - with Jack and Sam not showing up to each outing at the last minute. Sam kept finding hunts for them to go on where it would be just the two of them  - couple retreats being his latest obsession.
“Hey, he kept the secret first. It’s only fair.”  Dean replied, defensive. He received only the patented Sam Winchester bitch face in response.
Sam stared blankly at him, opening, and closing his mouth several times before he was able to answer.
Cas quirked a brow which really wasn’t helping.
Dean took a swig before talking.
Dean straightened out his own face too in mock seriousness, dramatic enough so the other man would detect the humour in it.
Things get a little awkward, and Dean doesn't understand why.
Despite all his bravado, Cas still managed to let out a surprised sound when they made contact. He faltered only for a moment however, before falling into the kiss softly. Despite the tension that had been buzzing between them only moments prior, their lips met each other gently, as if they had all the time in the world. For the time being they did.
Cas rolled his eyes, making it a full-body event somehow. “Are we really still doing this?”
Dean’s eyes widened further, while Cas tilted his head this time, confused.
Dean glanced back at the shirts, heat rising to his cheeks. His frustration suddenly replaced by nerves. It was fine. It wasn’t anything to be embarrassed about, he reassured himself.
“Dean. Cas.”
“Your turn.” Cas quickly cut in as Dean opened his mouth.
Cas had been absentmindedly fiddling with a rectangular object in his hands. Clearly frustrated with the lack of progress he was making. Computer based research still wasn’t his strongest suit, yet he wanted to be helpful and so he soldiered through.
“This is about that.”
“You’ve known this whole time?” Cas asked.
As they walked back into the bunker, Castiel approached the two of them. He nodded at Dean and looked over at Jack.
“Nah, just tired. Getting too old for this.” He attempted to be lighthearted.
Later.* Cya.*
“Are you going somewhere?” He questioned with a raised brow.
Sam pondered other possibilities for a moment before suddenly something clicked, his eyes widened.
Maybe a lot sorry.
But instead, he followed Sam out the bunker door.
Though he'd made sure not to let up until after Cas and Sam had countered all his stellar arguments.
“Oh come on, don’t tell me you feel bad.”
He hated Cas sounded as he said it. Like he didn’t believe what Dean was saying but had expected nothing better anyways. Dean wanted to take it back, prove him wrong, change that expression on his face.
“You know. Before he- before- “ he stumbled over his words in frustration. Letting out another sigh, this time harsher.
Dean didn’t bother with a response, glaring away at a random wall.
However, that was deemed unnecessary as Cas’ responding look seemed to do away with the grin - mostly - however, he continued to look back and forth between Dean and Cas.
“Well- he- He’s human now!” Dean called out triumphantly, after a few moments of sputtering incoherent syllables.
Cas’ face lit up immediately.
A voice called out from downstairs, saving Sam. "What's going on guys?" Jack called up. The three still up at the door glanced down at him. He was ignored for the time being.
Oh no.
There were still another thirty minutes before he had to pick Cas up from work. As Sam droned on, he sighed to himself. When had he became so clingy?
“I’m coming with you.”
“Jack I don’t think we can go to Vegas.”
“Fair point,” Cas replied seriously.
Dean sighed out, beginning to grow frustrated. There was no way Cas wasn’t understanding what he was saying. He was pushing on purpose. More than anything Dean was annoyed with himself for not being able to go where he was being led.
Cas sat up slightly from the floor and began to rearrange the blocks for another round.
Finally, he smiled.
“You alright?” Sam questioned, approaching him slowly.
Dean was glancing around, not making eye contact. Sam could feel the fear radiating off him, it was thick in the air.
A few years ago he never would’ve allowed himself to think it.
At that, he pulled the two men in front of him into his arms. They both yelped out as he crushed them in his hug. “Sammy, I can’t breathe.” Dean yelped out dramatically.
Here it finally is! The end! Hope yall enjoyed it! Sorry for the wait.
With that, Cas and Dean made their way out of the room, off to who knew where.
“Cas I-“
“Rewarding,” Cas responded after taking the last bite of his sandwich and wiping the crumbs off his jeans. “I had a bit of a scare. I thought the child was sick, but it turned out to be a ‘false alarm’”.
“Huh” Dean looked up at Sam from the pie slices in front of him. Still not wholly present.
“Fine, fine.” Dean glanced around sheepishly. “I uh. I was just remembering you in the cowboy hat.” He swallowed. “I liked it. It, um. You looked good.”
Cas relaxed slightly. Still looking apprehensive however.
Seemingly not for long though, as Cas started to inch away the moment Sam and Jack were out of sight.
“Don’t.” Dean replied roughly.
“Well that was easy.”
Dean was hardly surprised though. His younger brother could do anything he put his mind to, he was a great hunter, he was a good influence. He was even a better dad to Jack than Dean felt he was, despite him seemingly seeing Dean more as his dad for whatever reason. He used to feel a tinge of jealousy over it all, but nowadays he only felt pride.
Cas pondered for a moment, before scrunching his face into an expression of exaggerated concentration. “I have a condition.”
“Oh! Okay. I’ll uh. In that case, your server will be right over soon. Is there anything else I can do for you in the meantime?” He asked, wide-eyed. Dean felt bad for him.
