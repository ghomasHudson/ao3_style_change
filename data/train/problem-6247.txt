Tony had taken over the kitchen after shooing May out, claiming he was in charge of dinner and to go do whatever she wanted.
Tony was seated at the breakfast bar with his laptop, quietly reading over the news article surrounding the fight against Sandman, glasses perched on the end of his nose.
He never thought he'd be the type for the simple domestic life, but those moments were the ones he cherished most anymore.
Now, Peter didn't get quite as much field time as he would have liked because Tony wanted him to focus on school. Which was perfectly fine with Pete. Steve wanted him to just be a kid for a little while longer, which again, was fine. However, it still made Peter feel uncomfortable to watch his family go out and fight against villains, seeing the battle live on the news. There had been times when he watched Tony go down and felt his heart stop, praying for the armor to get back up. He still did patrols during the night when he wasn't busy, so he still felt good about taking down criminals.
I am so sorry this took longer than expected! I have no good excuses except that I have been stuck with writers block and no matter how hard I knock the blocks down, they rebuild themselves...
fan of your work! Your understanding of nuclear physics is completely unparalleled, a-and I'm also a big fan of the Hulk t-too and I'm rambling, I'm so sorry, I just really
"Yes. These horns were forged on Nidavellir, the home world of the Daurves. Nidavellir is where all the weapons of the Gods are forged, including Thor's hammer, Mjolnir."
"Hey, doll. Tell me you're staying out of trouble--" Steve jumped over another soldier, slamming his shield against the mans back. "--unlike--your Dad!"
Steve sighed and gestured to Peter, "I knew I shouldn't have left you two alone for so long, look at him, Tones. He's not okay and neither are you."
I will leave this up to you all, do we want a squeal to this? If we get enough people asking for one, it will be considered. As of now there are only vague ideas for one and it would be very similar to this type of fic, lots of fluff and what not.
nanote---" Peter trailed off, his eyes going wide when he noticed the other Avenger standing in the room. "...you're Captain America."
What kind of hero would he be if he didn't stand up for basic human rights and the freedom to love who you wanted?
Clint narrowed his eyes at the screen and asked, "Does Strange remind you of that Benedryl Cabbage---"
Spiderman: Hey! Miss writer? I have a question! Why did you make Doom go all the way to New York to pester the United Nations? The Hague would have been much closer since Latveria is in Romania.
Anyone who knows Tony Stark knows that the man doesn't show affection or praise like most people. He gives you his approval or admiration in the form of kisses. A kiss on the cheek, the forehead, even a quick peck on the lips. It was something he got from his mother, being of Italian decent. Only those closest to Tony would get this side of him. Tony would rather give an affectionate kiss than a hug or pat on the back.
Thor showed no surprise after Tony kissed him, even stating that on Asgard it was seen as a sign of affection and true friendship. This encouraged Tony to start greeting Thor this way.
"What do you want?" he asked quietly, trying to calm down. If he really needed to get away he knew that he could. He seriously doubted they would try and detain him for fear of pissing of Captain America and Ironman.
"Petey, baby, hold still." Tony quickly grabbed his phone and snapped a handful of pictures, getting a good one of Peter smiling between the two Gods, both looking down at him serenely.
If they could figure out who Spiderman was and contact him before SHIELD could, it would hopefully lead to Spiderman siding with the Avengers rather than SHIELD.
Steve thought, flinching inwardly at his foolishness. That was a really stupid thing to say, he'll admit, handing Tony a paper towel to wipe his face with. He clenched his hands at his sides and had to refrain from hitting himself, feeling utterly foolish for slipping up. Of course he knew Tony wasn't going to leave him! Why the fuck had he said that?
, a small fried cake of sweetened dough with icing, or a sweet filling. Try one?" Steve offered one of the glazed ones to the thunderer. "This one just has a glaze on it, see if you like it."
Thor smiled, leaning his head down to touch their foreheads together, brushing their noses together gently.
Before the super soldier could question Tony further, the sound of pounding feet and an echoing voice headed their way. Steve was stumped by skidding feet slamming into the open doorway and a young teenager going 90 miles a minute.
"Do you not love me?" Steve asked suddenly, looking just as shocked as Tony that he'd asked such as thing.Â Tony stopped what he was doing to look over at Steve, seeing the conflicted look in those ocean blue eyes.
Blocking a fierce roundhouse kick, Steve jumped back to avoid getting hit as two more soldiers slammed into him from behind.
"You know, this would totally be a fair fight if I were allowed to use my actual powers," Peter grumbled with a small smile.
Steve, Clint and Bruce were all gathered in the kitchen to watch. The super soldier was busy making home-made brownies, trying to push down his growing discomfort every time he looked at the TV screen.
He'd have a talk with SHIELD and Fury. He would make it clear that he was not interested in solo missions like this, not anymore. He was no longer just Captain America, the countries favorite soldier, God's righteous man. He was just a man...a man with his own life.
Ross...because apparently the military was interested in Spiderman as well...the Avengers made it abundantly clear that Spiderman was off-limits.
Another fun fact: According to Marvel, Latveria is supposed to be located in the Banat region of Europe. It is divided among three countries: the eastern part lies in western Romania; the western part in northeastern Serbia; and a small northern part lies within southeastern Hungary.
"Understood, Sir," Hill murmured, staring at the screen quietly. "Nick, I thought the Soldier was a myth?"
"Where's Tony?" Steve asked, wondering where his friend was. It wasn't like Tony to skip out on doughnuts.
"Alright," Steve yielded. "Ironman, Thor, we need Sandman to come back towards the firetrucks. Spiderman has a plan to bring him down for good."
Fury stared down at his laptop with narrowed eyes, watching the video footage play on a loop. The data that Cap and Widow had retrieved had taken months to crack, every file coded to protect itself from being hacked. Even the best hackers at SHIELD had found it difficult to access the files Natasha found in Zemo's lab. The paper files were all in different languages, once again, coded to keep outsiders from accessing the information.
"Does this guy never take vacations?" Tony groaned, watching the hoard of Doom-Bots congregate in the streets.
"This is the little one I have told you about, brother. He is the adopted son of Anthony and Steven," Thor explained helpfully.
"You'll tell me if you find anything big, secretive and mind-blowing?" Tony smirked, latching the belt.
"JARVIS? I want you to download everything you can find relevant to Spiderman from now on. Everything."
"Right...food riots...yes, those were real. Food was too expensive to buy at the grocers and millions of pounds of perfectly good food was left to rot on farms because there was no market for it. Oddly enough--" Steve grabbed his shield from the ground and slammed it down on another soldier. "Not many newspapers found it important enough to even make the papers."
"Tones," Steve pulled back to grab Tony's face gently. The dark haired genius was close to breaking, wet eyes looking up into solemn blue ones.
"I guess a small part of me knew that," Tony mumbled, feeling sheepish. Steve smirked and brushed his thumbs along Tony's hip line.
"Is your helmet really made of gold?" Peter asked curiously, taking his seat beside the Norse Gods. He'd always been curious about Loki's horned helm, wondering how the God even managed to wear the thing.
Tony typed something on the screen, watching another graph pop up, jotting down a side note all while humming to his music and singing along.
Steve watched Fury's ire grow, but the Director wouldn't be winning this argument. To drive his point, he added on another tactic.
Thinking it was most likely Tony or Peter, Steve quickly walked to the door to unlock it and pulled it open. Imagine his surprise when it wasn't his beloved genius or his son, but instead it was Bruce.
"How can you drink tea in the morning?" Clint stared at Bruce's mug with mild disgust. "Better yet...how can you drink that at all?"
Down in the lab, Tony and Bruce were working on a new patent for S.I. Bruce was always up for a brain challenge and would offer his assistance to Tony whenever it was needed.
"Oh..." Peter acknowledged, feeling the urge to slam his head against the wall in stupidity, crossing his arms for lack of anything better to do with them. "So...why are you here exactly?"
Steve feels his stupid jealousy rising again. It shouldn't bother him. He has no reason to feel petty jealousy. Tony can kiss whoever he wants, it's not like Steve owns him or anything. Steve just wanted to know why
Steve knew his back would be protesting all day long for sleeping on the couch, but it was worth it. He noted that Tony was already up and awake, most likely in the kitchen from the sound of it, and he slowly stood up to start getting ready. Grabbing a blanket from the other chair, he gently covered Pete up so his son could sleep some more.
Sorry this took so long, life is crazy right now. I've had a lot of projects happening at home and with my family that has taken up quite a bit of time, so yeah...not too much free time to write. But alas, we have reached our horizon. Check out the end notes for more.
much," Tony rolled his eyes and opened the box, tearing the last strawberry filled pastry in half to share with Clint.
Tony turned to Loki and Thor, his gaze landing on the God of mischief. To everyone's shock, the dark haired genius threw his arms around Loki's waist, clinging to the Norse God tightly!
"Are we okay now?" Steve asked softly, hoping there was no more confusion between them. Tony grinned up at him mischievously, "I think we're perfect."
"What secrets could he be keeping from us?" Tony mumbled, taking another sip of his coffee, contemplating.
Between Tony, Peter and Bruce, they had completely re-designed the Spiderman suit into a custom made nanotech suit that could be called to Peter like the Ironman armor. A simple advancement with a set of bracelets that were designed to recognize Peter's DNA.
"Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take...
Tony and Steve make it very clear what they think about SHIELD, and Fury, trying to get Peter on their side...
"You're Bruce Banner, one of the most renowned scientists of our generation! Holy cheese and crackers, Mr. Banner, I am a
"He's literally the same size as baby Cap before the serum! Just less sickly and not as angry with the world!" Clint continued, waving his hands around!
"You got any of that for me?" Steve asked with a small grin, reaching over Tony's head to grab a coffee cup for himself.
Looking down at his torn suit, the teen could see various cuts and bruises slowly showing up across his skin.
Steve can see that spark in Tony's eyes every time Peter does something amazing, whether it be on the field or in the lab. Even as young as Peter was, he never ceased to amaze them. They all agreed that Peter could stick to night patrols and help the team if the threat was great enough, but they just wanted Peter to be a kid. Tony wanted him to focus on school and go to college. Steve made sure Peter stayed up on his training to stay safe and agreed with Tony on Peter's focus to finish school. The rest of the team helped to protect the kid and just keep his life as
Tony hated these meetings with a burning passion. It was bad enough that SHIELD thought they could waltz in and demand the Avengers team do their bidding, which was annoying as Hell, but Fury continuously tried to oversee the team as though he were in command. SHIELD seemed to constantly forget that the Avengers were not part of SHIELD, they just happened to work with SHIELD.
"Bullshit," Tony snapped brusquely. "Loki isn't tied to Doom anymore than we are, you just wanna pin it on him as an excuse. Go ahead, Nick, piss of a trickster God and see where that gets you."
After an amazing dinner of homemade lasagna and garlic bread, Peter brought Tony up to show him his Spiderman costume. For being a handmade outfit it honestly wasn't half bad in Tony's eyes. The spandex material was useful, though it wasn't the best for safety. A line of fabric isn't going to stop a knife of be much use against a bullet. The web shooters were impressive though.
Bruce and Thor got the most attention from Peter next to Cap. The kid couldn't stop talking science with Bruce and fanboying over Thor because
"Look at how fake Tony's smile is," Bruce pointed out, glum. "I wish he would smile more in public."
"Hawkeye, you're on aerial. Widow, keep those bots from spreading too far. Thor, air assault. Tones and I will go after Doom," Steve instructed, strapping his shield on.
"Stevie-baby, you're home!" Tony cried, buried amoungst metal parts, a pair of safety glasses half perched on his head. "I missed you so much! JARVIS, I thought you said you would tell me when Steve came home!"
The genius literally spit coffee out as he coughed, his eyes going wide as he fought to catch his breath!
"Barton, you throw one more paper ball at me and I'm gonna lose it," he grouched at Clint who smirked right back.
The others went to stand as well, ready to follow their leaders out of the room, but Fury stopped them before they could.
There was a brief pause from Fury, which only added to Peter's growing anxiety. Tony had been worried about SHIELD finding Peter and now it seemed those fears were coming true.
The super soldier barely had time to put his shield away and remove the upper half of his stealth suit. He was still dressed in his stealth pants and his black undershirt, having not even had time to remove his utility belt, when there was a sharp knock at his bedroom door.
With Spiderman joining in, the team had Sandman on the ropes, but it wasn't enough. The super villain evaded every attack they threw at him. Thor's lightning would only stun him momentarily. Clint's arrows would pass right through the sand or become surrounded by it, rendering them useless. Bullets only passed through the sand that Sandman used as a distraction. Tony's beams only managed to do so much damage, mostly just succeeding in burning the sand. Cap's shield would cut through the sand barriers but he could never actual hit Sandman dead on. Spiderman attempted to web the villain but proved to be ineffective.
echoing back to them. The kid was anything but reckless but it still made Steve flinch every time he watched Peter swing around the city from his webs.
"Or he learned it from someone else." Fury spoke up again, leaning his arms on the table with a heavy frown. "A master of magic, for instance."
Steve sighed and walked Tony into the elevator, watching the billionaire breath heavily against the wall.
It was not too common for Tony to give out kisses to people he was not close to, specifically business owners or big wigs trying to get in with S.I. simply for media coverage.
"Alright," Steve backed down, turning to head back in. He glanced back at the city lights once more before following Tony back inside. He knew he was overprotective of Peter, but he couldn't help it. The kid had a big heart. All Pete wanted to do was save people and make the world a better place, and they all knew that he would.
"Brucie-Bear, you're late to the party." Tony motioned for Bruce to come closer, gesturing to a wide-eyed Peter sitting at the table. "Bruce, this is Peter Parker. Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman."
"You are far younger than I would have imagined, little one. Hardly on the cusp of boyhood," Thor noted with a look of intrigue. It was not often one came across such an accomplished warrior that was hardly a man. Even on Asgard, children as small as Peter were barely beginning their training on the field of battle.
"You gotta get some rest. You guys have been down here all day and I doubt either of you have eaten anything healthy since I left," he scolded, watching Tony gasp indignantly.
Tony had put himself through another all-nighter in the lab, subjecting himself to dead-end schematic for his newest suit of armor. This was why he was dragging his tired ass to the kitchen at seven in the morning, yearning for a hot cup of coffee.
"Yep. Apparently the latest scoop is that Tony and Stephan Strange are the new Avengers power couple. And I have to listen to this ridiculous babble." Pepper threw Tony a glare, knowing that the genius was enjoying the drama in his own way.
The conversation ended abruptly as Thor brought down a torrent of lightning on Doom. The villain shielded himself from harm, re-aiming his focus on the God of thunder. The others joined in on the fray as well, keeping Doom on the defense.
"No you will not," Steve rumbled fiercely, moving himself slightly in front of Tony to block him from Fury. Thor moved as well, calling Mjolnir to his hand in a silent warning. Even Bruce began to turn green at the accusation.
"You've got nothing to prove, Pete. You're a good kid, a damn sharp mind, I don't want you risking your life when there are others who can. Take me for instance," Tony smiled softly.
Tony nodded sleepily, leaning into the warm touch, mumbling about how much he missed having the super soldier around. It seemed to do the trick because soon Tony agreed to go back upstairs willingly. Setting the billionaire down on one of the stools, Steve made sure he would stay with the help of Dum-E and U.
It was pointless to try and stop Tony. The man of iron was dead set on charging in full force to get a piece of Sandman for himself.
"Well done, young Spider. We will make an Avenger out of you yet," Thor praised, slapping his hand against Spiderman's shoulder.
Joining his two dorks on the couch, Steve removed his uniform top so he was just wearing his black undershirt for comfort. He hadn't watched Game of Thrones that much but he figured he could annoy Tony and Peter into filling him in on the premise. As he leaned back against couch, he vowed that he protect this part of his life with everything he had.
"We all do, but you just have to be patient," Bruce tried to sooth the other man gently. They all missed Thor. It was strange to have one of their own gone for so long, but they all knew that Thor's loyalty to Asgard came first above all, even their family.
Pete didn't so much as just drop from the ceiling, like Steve thought he would, but instead his kid decided to run across the ceiling and down the wall like a fucking Olympian sprinter! It didn't help that Peter was just as jittery as Tony was, if not more, and wouldn't stand still long enough for Bruce to grab him!
"I can try blinding him again and Thor can zap him?" Peter offered, not really knowing if they had a plan or not. "The armor is made of titanium which is a transitional metal, but a bolt of lightning at almost one billion volts should pack a punch!"
Leaning down, Steve brushed his nose against Tony's, quietly murmuring the words he'd been longing to say for years.
With time, more and more super heroes began to make an appearance in the world. From girls who have the weird ability to control squirrels, to super mutants, to insane mercs who never shut up.
Aunt May slid up beside them and smirked at Peter's stammering. "Honey, Mr. Stark already knows who you are."
Steve looked at Tony for a second and knew the genius must have a good reason for bringing a child to the lab. He just hoped it was a really good reason.
Natasha soon joined them too, stealing the chocolate and blueberry cake doughnuts for herself. Between Hulk and Clint, two of the boxes had already been devoured.
Clint stopped whatever mean comment he was about to make when his eyes landed on the kid, tilting his head in confusion. Why was there a child in the Avengers tower?
The team had been gathered together in the living room watching a movie with loads of pizza. It was something they always tried to do at least once a week to bond and relax, but it felt strange without Thor there.
"You're thinking too hard, Tones," Steve murmured softly, sensing the unease filling the dark haired genius.
"I have confirmed Spiderman's identity, Sir. Voice recognition has been authenticated and physical scans show a %100 match."
Sitting in the living room watching the news, folding laundry while Tony worked on his schematics, the steady flow of music from the kitchen where Peter was making double fudge cookies. Those were moments he wanted more than anything.
"Do we need Hulk?" Bruce asked over the comms, the hesitation in his voice clear. It was a dangerous move to allow the Hulk loose in such chaotic conditions.
"We need a new plan of action!" Thor cried, sending another lightning blast at Sandman only for it to be ineffective. Each lightning strike would only bounce off the villain, the sand forming into glass momentarily before transforming back into sand.
The genius billionaire hated simple small talk with a fierce passion, often making rude or offhanded comments to people just to watch them squirm. Tony craved deep conversations, philosophical discussions at 2am over cold pizza, things normal folks just didn't do.
"Besides, with our powers combined we can--" Tony was cut off by his phone ringing. Taking it out of his pocket he grinned.
Clint and Steve were headed up to the common area after a lengthy training session, both men exhausted and dripping with sweat. It had been awhile since it was just the two of them sparring together. Clint never turned down an opportunity to fight against Captain America, even though it was usually for his own amusement half the time.
"Not yet, Captain. We have one more thing to discuss," Fury sighed, bringing up a laptop from the table behind him. When he opened it, a video began to play and he paused it, turning it towards them.
With the thinly veiled threat made clear, the agents slowly backed off after releasing their hold on Tony. The billionaire shook his limbs out while glaring at them.
Thoughts so far? I'm sorry it wasn't better, but I wanted to get it out of the way so we can move on!
Strolling into the kitchen, Tony spied Steve and Bruce sitting at the table eating an early lunch. The coffee pot was full already, the steaming goodness calling to him like a sirens song.
"Sorry you couldn't meet Black Widow, but Nat is off on a mission for SHIELD." Clint shrugged in a quick apology. "Maybe Tony can bring you over again."
It really shouldn't bother Steve what the papers thought because he knew they were wrong. Of course, that didn't mean it didn't annoy the shit out of him.
Tony seemed to get what he was up to and smirked, "Are you gonna draw me like one of your French girls, Mr. Rogers?"
"Steve, I didn't think you'd be comfortable with it." Tony sighed, already watching the confusion wash over Steve's face. Reaching for Steve's other hand, holding onto them both, Tony tried to make the man understand him.
"Be nice, Clint. We have company," Steve advised seriously, moving aside for the others to see Peter behind him.
It wasn't long before Tony decided to bring Peter over to the Tower so he could, officially, meet the team.
"I'm out!" Peter exclaimed, stuffing another waffle into his mouth. He'd downed at least fourteen waffles by himself, only after going into his explanation that waffles were merely pancakes with abs.
"Store video files in a separate file, cross reference and eliminate all fake specimens after analysis, you know the drill."
"I have questions too," Tony stated smugly, smirking when Fury rolled his eyes. "I wanna know why SHIELD is more interested in the technology Doom seemingly used rather than the civilian casualties, the fact that one of our own was injured in battle or the possible outcomes of this tech falling into someone else's hands."
Steve groaned as Pete crawled across the ceiling, doing a great impression of a deranged marionette. Reaching for Tony who was swaying beside him, he pulled the genius against his side to keep him upright.
Steve punched the sandbag over and over, clenching his teeth in frustration as he threw upper cut after upper cut. He'd accidentally destroyed the last bag, landing one punch just a smidgen too hard, sending the equipment flying into the wall. Tony had designed
As much as he loved fighting crime, he didn't want to only be a superhero...even Spiderman has dreams!
Steve stared at the ground between their feet, hating himself for being unable to control his damn emotions. He'd kept himself in line for years.
Peter watched the agents slowly begin to approach him. He knew he wasn't in danger but that didn't make him feel any better.
"Tony is correct. My brother is not an ally of Doom, this much I can be certain of. When last we spoke, Loki mentioned his personal distaste for the Latverian ruler. Apparently, Doom sought my brother out to try and syndicate himself with Loki."
Smirking, Steve took the opening and softly pressed his lips to Tony's, swallowing the porn worthy moan his genius let out. Tony melted against his chest, running his hands up to wrap around Steve's neck to try and pull him closer, gasping in pleasure as Steve devoured him. It was everything Tony had ever imagined, and more.
"We need a plan, guys. Unless we bring Sandman down he's gonna end up leveling Brooklyn!" Natasha announced hastily, unable to assist in the battle. Since their guns did not work against Sandman, the jet was non-effective for the fight.
"People love Spiderman," Bruce shrugged from the couch. "It's no wonder everyone thinks he's secretly an Avenger after fighting with us yesterday."
"It's bad enough that you made me watch that movie but are you really going to make that joke every time I draw you?"
"I'll tell you what," Steve smiled. "I'm not leaving until morning, so why don't we have a movie night? Just the three of us?"
"Hey, come on don't shut down like that. Emotional constipation is supposed to be my thing remember?"
"You are quite young to be on a battlefield. Why are you fighting with the Avengers of Midgard?" the God asked, keeping Peter shielded.
The agents around them all held their breath as they turned to Fury, watching the Director stand there stoically. His silence was enough for Steve though. The Captain nodded once, turned around and reached for Tony's hand to leave.
"Just because I was born in a time when men were proclaimed superior to women and homosexuality was illegal doesn't mean it was
It soon becomes apparent that the Avengers all agree; Peter will be the best of them all. They all see that Tony loves the kid, treating Peter as his own.
Tony couldn't help but smile, reaching up to lay his hand on Peter's shoulder to give the kid a warm squeeze. His whole life he'd always been forced to believe he wasn't worth anything good, that he would always be in the shadow of his old man, yet this brave kid claims he wants to be exactly like Tony?
"SHIELD also maintains a highly advanced system for weaponry we deem valuable should an attack occur," Fury rebuked.
Peter didn't know what hit him, but he knew exactly what he hit when he landed. His body slammed straight through the brick and cement. There were multiple rips in his suit from the blast. He was honestly shocked he was still conscious.
"I will, promise!" Peter cried, waving his phone at them just to show them he had it. He was ready to go and wanted to leave already.
"Yes, please." Peter scooted in next to the large thunderer, grabbing the loaf of bread to grab a couple slices. Compared to how crazy his life had been recently, Peter probably should have been a tad bit amazed that he was making a freaking sandwich next to a Norse God. Steve saddled up on Peter's other side and grabbed a plate for himself and one for Tony, gathering some wheat bread to make a few sandwiches.
It wasn't like he had any claim over the dark haired genius. They were best friends, very close companions, the leaders of the team and they trusted each other with their lives.
Steve comes down to the lab to grab Tony for lunch, walking in to find Tony in the middle of a video chat with his interns. Tony glanced over to him and waved him in, smiling and holding up a finger for him to wait. Steve watched from the sidelines as Tony babbled on about some science thing happening at Stark Industries.
Tony had, on many occasions, bluntly stated how attractive Steve was! The genius had made every joke possible about Steve's
Tony was in the kitchen, bleary eyed and glaring at the coffee maker for being too slow. He'd already gotten his favorite mug down and ready for his daily dose of caffeine.
If Tony Stark wanted to hug someone then he would, sometimes to the point of causing pain in the ribs. There was no time for dismissive side-hugs or uninterested handshakes. Life was too short for that and Tony despised pseudo kindliness.
It was a P.R. nightmare that Pepper was already having to handle. One small remark and a casual wink was all it took to start a hurricane of rumors. When it came to popular magazines and news, the truth was nice but a rumor was priceless. Many people had questioned the relationship between Tony and Strange, wondering if Tony had found a new love interest in the handsome sorcerer, naming them the IronStrange ship.
"But...I just wanna be like you, Mister Stark," Peter expressed, harrowing. The look of pure adoration in his eyes was adorable, enough to make the billionaires heart melt.
Spiderman lends a hand to the Avengers when they face off with Sandman. Oh, and also, Tony figures out who Spiderman actually is.
"The kissing thing," Steve stated, that odd feeling coming back again as he replayed the image in his head of Tony kissing Rhodey. "I didn't know Tony and Rhodes were--"
"You know this is actually a treat for me. Cap never lets me cook," Tony grumbled lightly as he layered fresh pasta sauce over the lasagna noodles.
Loki smelled the doughnut before taking a small bite, surprised by the softness and sudden rush of sugary sweetness on his tongue. It was very sweet, but in a good way.Â He'd always had a love for chocolate and other sweets, but he'd never tried anything like these so-called doughnuts.
"Nah, it was my longing that brought you back," Tony smirked and planted another quick peck against Thor's lips.
"I haven't much taste for chocolate, that was always a favorite of Loki's. What is this pink substance on top?" Thor asked, gesturing to one of the iced doughnuts with sprinkles.
Tony, initially, was the one to find out who Spiderman actually was. He had been concerned when JARVIS' scans all indicated a young male was behind the mask instead of an adult.
tell you, Sir. Though I doubt you actually understood my notification when I informed you earlier." The A.I snarked lightly, obvious annoyance in the robots voice.
Tony yelled furiously, speaking so quickly that Fury couldn't even understand half of what he was saying.
"This is why you're my favorite," Clint stated and shoved the sweetness in his mouth, tapping his cheek. The genius rolled his eyes again but leaned over to kiss Clint's cheek, winking at the archer before taking his leave.
Tony finished layering the lasagna up, loading the top with parmesan and sliding it into the oven. His moms own recipe that never failed to impress. His mama would turn over in her grave if Tony couldn't make her best dish right.
Steve has to go off on a mission with Natasha for SHIELD...Tony and Peter are less than thrilled about it.
Now, his days start with a quick work out just to loosen his muscles, followed by making coffee for Tony and then breakfast for them and their son. He still kept up on his training regimen with the team to keep them functioning like a well oiled machine, continuing on as the leader of the Avengers with Tony. Captain America would always be an Avenger, an idol of a perfect soldier and a good man, but it was time to start being just Steve Rogers again.
Tony and Steve stopped short, looked at each other, then looked at their son, then back at each other.
"No, the kids right. This is real sand that this guy is wielding. You douse him in water and the sand particles will congeal together," Tony advised quickly, understanding what Spiderman had thought of. "Follow the plan!"
Loki was planning on joining in on the fun when he felt a gentle tugging sensation on his cape, turning around to find the young boy looking up at him with a shy wave.
Steve and Tony jumped apart in surprise as Peter appeared out of nowhere, running onto the open jet in a frantic rush. Steve barely had time to steady himself as Pete lept into the air towards him.
"You lose Ironman, you lose the Avengers," Tony rumbled from behind Steve. "Are you willing to risk that, Director?"
Tony smirked, "Don't you use that Brooklyn slang on me, asshole. I won't be able to control myself."
Smirking, Steve took the opening and softly pressed his lips to Tony's, swallowing the porn worthy moan his genius let out. Tony melted against his chest, running his hands up to wrap around Steve's neck to try and pull him closer, gasping in pleasure as Steve devoured him.
to take a break for a little bit," Steve pleaded. "How about you come upstairs and watch a movie with me? I'll make you something to eat and then you can come back down...okay?"
Tony practically squealed in delight, throwing his arms around Rhodey's shoulders to give him a wet smack right on the lips. If Rhodey was surprised, it didn't show. He just rolled his eyes and handed Tony a cup, watching the genius moan happily. Tony eventually finished one full cup before grabbing another one, looping his arm around Rhodey's to drag his Honeybear off to the lab.
"Ummm...it's a dynamic with pretty complex target problems with rational engineering methodology based on molecular principles versus trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering. Molecular approach seeks to manipulate system properties by understanding their chemical and physical origins. It also gives rise to fundamental new materials and systems, which are sometimes required to address outstanding needs in different fields, like anything from energy to healthcare to electronics."
"We've got evac on its way for civilians, but they need a path cleared. You boys wanna wrap it up quick then you need to handle Doom, fast." Natasha sent out her instructions over the comms.
, all without batting an eye. In return, Steve would sometimes call Tony random pet-names back just to see the genius smile at him. They would hold hands, hug each other often, cuddle on the couch and even sleep together on the massive sofa during late night movie marathons.
Everyone on the ground looked on in horror as Ironman plummeted towards the Earth, fear and alarm rushing through them when they realized the armor wasn't slowing down.
"Are you gonna stay out of trouble while I'm gone?" Steve asked with a smirk, hoping to get one last rile out of Tony.
"Thor? Can I ask you a question?" he inquired quietly, waiting for the thunderer to nod. "That forehead touch you and Loki did, what does it mean exactly? Is that a part of Asgardian culture?"
"Apologies Sirs, Peter is requesting entrance into the lab. It would seem he has had a scientific breakthrough and desires the lab. I should inform you both that it is also 3:15 am."
Shrugging off the whole thing, Steve went back to his lunch while Bruce read beside him, trying not to dwell on the odd feelings in his chest.
Steve was about to get up and make Tony some fresh coffee when the elevator sounded from behind them. All three heads whipped around to see Colonel James Rhodes strut in with a cup carrier full of Starbucks coffee in hand.
...drat!" Pete gasped, slamming straight to the mat again. Neither of them heard the doors of the training room open or see their Captain walk in.
The joke began that Tony and Steve had already adopted Peter and just don't want to tell anyone. Tony and Steve embrace it though, calling Peter their kid.
The young minds of SI were Tony's favorite part of his work. The kids all looked up to Tony for guidance and worked hard to impress him. Steve knew how much those kids meant to Tony and he knew his genius cared about them all.
Tugging his hoodie on, Peter grabbed his phone from his desk and headed for the stairs. He could smell the scent of Italian wafting around the house and wondered if May had made spaghetti or lasagna. Hoping down the steps with a pep in his step, he rounded the corner to the living room with a smile.
Marvel Facts! According to Marvel's database on Captain America, Steve's enhanced memory from the Super Soldier Serum has enabled him to learn multiple languages, including German, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese and Italian.
Peter continued to knock at the door, his confused voice coming through from the otherside as his parents fought back smiles.
"In a way," Thor shrugged. "Touching ones forehead to another is a personal gesture to indicate friendship or a bond with someone. For Loki and I, it signifies our mental bond with one another, as well as our deep emotional bond that if familial. Does this make sense?"
"Aye. You will see me in less than a week," Loki chided, stepping up to Thor. "And I expect you to be fashionably early."
"Stark, unless you calm down I will have you escorted off the premises," Fury declared stonily. He had expected Stark to be upset but this was a bit much.
Steve clenched his hands at his sides and had to refrain from hitting himself, feeling utterly foolish for slipping up. How was he supposed to explain himself without making himself look like a selfish jackass? Of course he knew Tony loved him, just like Tony knew Steve loved him. It was an unspoken thing between them all as a team.
"Young Peter, would you care for a sandwich?" Thor asked politely, waving his hand at the assortment of food on the kitchen island.
"Try it, Loki. They're really good!" Peter insisted, munching down on his own doughnut, smearing chocolate icing on his cheek.
After swiftly catching his hyper child, Steve managed to corral his tired family upstairs to the couch, grabbing a quick snack before letting Tony and Peter cuddle up against him. They settled down together and turned on Wall-E to watch.
Steve reached into his tactical belt for a pen, turning his attention back to Tony who was trying to get Bruce to argue science with him.
Walking to the kitchen, he took note of the time and knew he had less than half an hour before he had to leave.
Steve sighed and lead the way to the elevator, Bruce trailing along behind him. From what Bruce explained, Tony and Peter had been working on some new tech for the last week or so and claimed they were almost to a breakthrough. It was normal for Tony to get pulled into his work, but Steve had always been around to drag the genius out of the lab when he worked too long.
"I assume you have an opinion on this matter, Rogers?" Fury asked, annoyed by the whole turn of events.
The TV in the kitchen was tuned on to the news feed happening LIVE, where Tony was currently doing an interview about New York's latest idiosyncratic...Doctor Steven Strange. Tony was doing a little PR about Strange, claiming that the sorcerer was not a threat and that he was trustworthy.
"Sorry about earlier, Mr. Loki. I've wanted to meet you for a really long time because I think your magic is awesome and amazing, can we start over?" Peter held his hand out shyly. "Hi, I'm Peter Parker."
"Morning, Tony," Bruce piped up softly, giving Tony a small smile as he finished making himself some oatmeal.
Steve shrugged, tossing his shirt in his hamper before digging through his closet for new clothes. His stealth suit was already laid out beside Tony, along with his weapons and shield.
resemblance to a certain God of Mischief," Tony admitted with a small shutter. "You can't tell me you haven't noticed the likeness?"
"Hang on, son." Steve whipped his shield out to take down an incoming fleet of soldiers, knocking them all on their asses before they even reached the door. Punching out the asshole who had been clinging to his back, Steve finally caught a brief break.
"Spiders are arachnids!" Peter yelled, jumping out of the way of a blast. "How can you call yourself a doctor if you don't even know the difference between an ant and a spider!"
"You steal my heart, dear," Tony said dramatically, quickly kisses Nat on the head before grabbing the pastry box.
Tony ran over to them in a panic, huffing and panting loudly as he looked Peter over for any serious wounds.
Bruce was the first to discover this by bringing a sleep deprived Tony a fresh cup of coffee. Tony gave him a quick peck on the cheek in thanks before shuffling off.
So, Tony had tracked Peter down and offered him a chance to be more. It was not long before Tony also discovered that Peter was on a genius level of intelligence, much like himself, and asked Peter to intern at Stark Industries under him as an intern.
Steve groaned and threw his shield at Sandman, looking up at Tony who still had his repulsors aimed. "What's our first rule!"
Unfortunately, as it turned out, luck was not on Steve's side.Â What was originally supposed to be a 2 week mission, soon turned into 3...
In my defense...things have been a little crazy lately so I haven't had the time nor the omph to write. Had a bit of writers block if I'm being honest. But, we are moving forward!
"The file was de-coded less than 15 minutes ago. It was sent straight to you, Classified as Alpha level clearance only." Maria Hill had been the one to bring the video to him, watching it as well. She stood behind Fury who was still watching the footage.
Sighing, Steve caught movement out of the corner of his eye and saw Natasha and an array of SHIELD agents following her through the side door. She waved the disk at him to show they got what they came for.
Nope, Peter had high expectations for his future and they all included Stark Industries. If he could manage to score an internship with S.I and work his way up to the science division it would be a dream. He loved science more than anything else and wanted to be on the forefront with the leading company in engineering and biomechanics.
Steve stood against the desk, an uneasy look settling in as he thought over the last 48 hours of nonsense. Tony thought the whole thing was funny as Hell, but Steve couldn't stop the slithering tendrils of doubt that crept in.
"Tony, do you have any idea how annoying and frustrating it is to have reporters asking me about your love life? No matter what I say they only take what they want from it. You're trending on Twitter for God's sake..."
"That's not where your spleen is," Nat smirked. She'd been training with Peter on a weekly basis to strengthen his acrobatic skills, focusing on his quick reflexes and smooth movements. Pete was very good, but when it came to taking down a trained spy in hand to hand combat...not so much.
"Friends! What are these nuts of dough that JARVIS spoke of?" Thor asked, lumbering into the kitchen to join them.
"Put some ice on it, soldier," Steve smirked. In all honestly he did tap Clint pretty hard during their last round, but he would know if something were broken in the archer.
Stepping even closer, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's hips to bring them flush together, enjoying the blush spreading across the genius' cheeks.
The room went silent at that, a clear sign that things were about to go south very quickly between Fury and Tony. The dark haired genius was grinning from his chair, leaning back with his arms crossed.
The famous archer and the formidable God of thunder, who's presence was far more imposing in person, turned to look at the new guest. They both knew Tony wouldn't bring someone to their home without good reason.
"Loki's helmet was crafted for him by the finest artisans in the Nine, young Peter. It is not meant to be worn by another." Thor smiled at Peter's enthusiasm, knowing that the young teen had been excited to actually meet the God of Mischief for awhile now.
"And it's not a lack of faith in your skills, because you're a fucking super soldier, but it's not safe! If it's that dangerous then the whole team should be going."
Steve could see that spark light up in Tony's eyes every time Peter did something amazing, whether it be on the field or in the lab. Pete had turned into a true child prodigy.
It was still dead silent in the room. No one dared to speak for fear of setting the super soldier off, watching Stark had been enough. They all waited tensely as Captain America focused his full attention at Fury.
Loki glanced at the destruction around him, the lifeless robots picked apart by his own magic, the perfect attestation for Doom's destitution of victory. The tyrant would not win against the Avengers without the use of technology.
"Good work out there, son. The Avengers are grateful for your help." Steve held out his hand to offer Spiderman, smiling as the young hero seemed to be in awe. Spiderman was so tiny compared to Steve, even more so as he shook the kids hand in thanks.
That was obviously not the answer Steve was expecting if the look on his face was anything to go by. Tony sighed heavily, knowing his reasons would probably make him look like a coward and a little pathetic.
Peter was very proud of his work and had every right to be. For as young as he was, Peter's IQ revealed itself in his ability to adapt and create his own designs, with little help. The web shooters being made in a school chemistry lab for one thing, that in itself was insane.
"Call me Clint, kid." Clint walked up to Peter and shook his hand with a grin. "What brings you to our humble abode?"
"There's something else we'd like to tell you all. Peter?" Tony gestured for the kid to speak up, encouraging him with a warm smile. "It's okay, Pete."
JARVIS let him into the lab without question. Music was quietly coming from the speakers, some mix of rock that Tony often listened to while he worked. His dark haired genius was currently sitting at his desk on a video call. Tony glanced over to him and waved him in, holding up a finger for him to wait.
Peter knew a subtle threat when he heard one. The agents knew that he knew they were there, making eye contact with him, unfaltering.
"Oh no, none of that nonsense," Tony chided as he lept up from his chair to grab Steve's hand. He grabbed Steve's hand with his own, pulling the super soldier away from the door. Their lunch could wait until whatever this issue was was resolved. Something had clearly happened to make Steve so edgy and Tony wanted to know what it was.
"I know that," Steve sighed heavily while pulling himself up off the ground, taking a hard kick to the stomach from a Nazi soldier. "As it turns out, I was wrong."
Smiling softly at the very subtle hitch in Tony's breath, Steve knew his best friend was truly upset that he was leaving. In a way, Steve knew how Tony was feeling. It was an emotion he was familiar with every time he watched Tony and Rhodey do test flights for the armor. There was always a chance something could go wrong and it always filled Steve with dread. He still has nightmares of the Ironman armor falling from the sky.
Just as Clint tried to argue, Tony walked into the kitchen tapping away on his phone. He glanced up as everyone turned to stare at him.
"Tell the team to lure Sandman back down here, get him as close as possible to that firetruck!" Spiderman pointed over to the large firetruck parked behind them, the fire fighters spread out, awaiting orders.
Bruce and Clint looked at each other with skepticism. Even they could see how the sorcerer supreme resembled the British actor.
Tony was emotionally drained by the time they got home. He was so angry at Fury and SHIELD for trying to force Peter into joining them as a way to keep Spiderman under their thumb. It made him want to destroy the helicarrier and retract all the tech he'd ever given SHIELD. Those assholes would never get their hands on his kid.
"Peter Parker is a child. He is not a soldier for you to use. He is not a piece on the chessboard, and I will not stand by and watch you or your agents try to bully him into working for SHIELD or any other organization he doesn't want to be a part of. Is that clear?"
"The only reason Thor would take off so fast is if something was wrong with Loki and last time I checked, the God of Mischief wasn't stepping foot on Asgard for any reason. If Loki was in trouble then he would have just come here."
Also, in case it wasn't obvious, I clearly prefer Comic Hawkeye over the MCU Hawkeye. He's way funnier, has a sense of humor almost like Deadpools and has the attention span of a mouse.
Tony leaned up in his chair, his relaxed posture changing instantly to the fiery attitude Tony Stark was known for. The type of posture that told you shit was about to get real...
Pulling himself up, he could hear his Pops calling for him outside the pile of brick surrounding his prone body. Peter coughed as dirt filled his lungs, a large shadow suddenly blocking the outside light.
It wasn't until the super soldier began noticing Tony's open affection with others that it slowly started to bother him. He had no issue with Tony kissing other people, it was more along the lines of seeing Tony kiss everyone other than Steve. He knew Tony was affectionate to those closest to him, it was one of the things he loved about Tony, but he didn't realize how much that seemed to exclude him.
"I do to, but you gotta let him do this on his own. It's what he wants, Cap. Let him learn," Tony reassured gently, even though he was just as nervous every time Peter went out alone. He put on a brave face and smiled at Steve.
"You must be Peter Parker." Tony looked up at Pete with a soft smile, standing up with ease, holding up his hand. "Tony Stark."
A moment later, a video came up on the screen and began playing. It was only 47 seconds in total, the camera focusing in on the swinging superhero. The webbing, for lack of a better word, intrigued Tony. He wanted to know what it was made of, was it synthetic? Was it a material? Was it
Tony set the suit down on the desk with a deep sigh, sitting down in the roller chair heavily, looking over at the bright eyed kid across from him.
"Careful how you speak in regards to my brother, Fury. My forbearance for your contempt will not last forever," Thor growled lowly, lightning dancing along his fingertips with concealed restraint. Having to listen to others condemn the God of Mischief relentlessly and refrain from reprehending them was truly a marvel of the thunderers self-control.
"Not well," Thor winced slightly. If he recalled the conversation, Loki had been extremely vexed and claimed Doom was an antagonistic, deranged tyrant. From Loki described, Doom merely wanted access to Loki's magic and knowledge, something the God of mischief would never allow.
"Don't mind him, Pete. He's just jealous that you have awesome powers and all his came from a bottle," Tony smirked. "Don't be jelly, Cap."
"The armor's not responding, I'm dead in the water!" Tony snapped. "I can't reach the stupid latch 'cause my arms caught!...Stop laughing and get me out,
"He always wears a mask in front of a news camera, dude." Clint took a sip of his coffee, foregoing a cup and just taking the whole pot.
Steve smiled in amusement at Tony's exaggerated theories. Glancing down at Tony's moving mouth, he briefly thought about shutting his genius up with his own lips...but fate had other plans.
"You didn't show up for lunch as you promised," Loki stated dryly. "The mortals publicized your battle on broadcast, worldwide."
"I don't buy it," Tony grumbled. His eyes roamed up to where Steve was standing, shirtless, digging through his hangers. The blond ended up grabbing a plain black undershirt to wear beneath his suit. Disguarding his sleep pants, Steve caught his stealth suit pants as Tony flung them at him, slipping them on.
Tony smirked because it was true. Peter was a joy to have in the lab, especially when they were trying to create new projects.
If you had told Peter his night would end with Ironman cooking lasagna in his kitchen, wearing an apron, while humming show tunes...Pete probably would have laughed until he fainted.
"Eh," Tony shrugged. "Nothing a little psychological placebo affect can't fix, right? I can pretend."
"I just want to know what Fury's deal is. Why is he so interested in this information?" Tony babbled, sitting down on the bed.
"Petey baby, you okay?" Tony asked swaying on his feet, the only thing keeping him from falling over was Steve's hands holding him up.
The agent asked snidely. "No offense, Cap, but I'd never call my kid somethin' girly like that. Aren't you afraid it'll make him soft?"
"Tell me he's okay, Pops, because I was watching the news and I saw him go down and then he didn't get back up and JARVIS told me that something was wrong with the suit and I---!" Peter rambled frantically, looking everywhere around them for any sign of Tony.
Grabbing his bag, Steve wondered for the thousandth time if he should just bite the bullet and talk to Tones.
Tony figured he should swoop in and save the kid before he made a complete fool of himself, even if Tony did think it was adorable.
When the Captain sees first hand just how often everyone else got Tony's kisses, he begins to feel the stirrings of jealousy. What he doesn't understand is
To his surprise, Bruce was also in the kitchen making himself some breakfast. The other scientist had been locked away in the Hulk room for the last week or so, working quietly away from everyone else. It bothered Tony that he couldn't give Bruce the comfort he deserved, but they all knew there was no way to reverse the affects of the gamma radiation. The Hulk would always be there, a constant threat in the back of Bruce's mind, but Tony would give just about anything to have that burden thrust onto someone else.
"Nat's teaching me her signature move!" Peter stated proudly, rubbing his back with a small wince. "As soon as I can actually do it, it's over for you all during sparring. I'll be invincible!"
Honestly, out of everyone in the tower, Steve and Tony had grown the closest over time. Hell, Steve considered Tony to be his best friend and possibly something more, but Tony never insinuated any interest or open affection towards Steve. Other than friendly hugs or occasional cuddling on the couch, Tony had not given Steve the physical attention he seemed to give others.
Breathing heavily from the soldier wrapped around his neck, Steve struggled to get free while another soldier aimed punches at his ribs. He grunted with each hit but managed to kick the asshole away from him, reaching up to throw the soldier on his back off.
Between the two Gods and a teen who craved sugar, the doughnuts didn't last very long. The team was soon digging in on the food that was ordered. An array of different choices laid out in the kitchen for everyone to choose from.
"You're---like a freaking koala---with cerebral palsy!" Tony cried, finally balancing himself with Peter crawling on him.
The first time he got to formally meet his childhood hero and he sounded like an idiot, great job Peter.
"True, but I'm sure whatever the reason, it was important. You know Thor can't defy Odin," Steve chimed in, giving Tony a reassuring smile.
Steve rolled his eyes while he poured himself a cup of fresh coffee. He knew all about Tony's obsession with BBC Sherlock Holmes and its main actor. He and Clint would often mispronounce Benedict Cumberbatch just to annoy Tony to no end.
When Steve went to get ready, Tony followed behind him with a fresh cup of energy, still chattering away about how the whole mission was trouble. It was a bit flawed, Steve would admit, but they couldn't argue with Fury on this one.
Thor was off somewhere, claiming he had a private errand to run and would return shortly, but that was becoming more and more frequent. No one asked the thunderer where he went or what he was doing, but it was now common for Thor to take off at least twice a week to unknown locations.
"I thought you were crazy about Tom Hiddleston?" Steve teased him, smirking at Tony scandalized gasp. They all knew how much Tony loved the British actors.
Tony stepped closer and grabbed Steve's hand with his own, pulling the super soldier away from the door. Their lunch could wait until whatever this issue was was resolved, even if Tony had no idea what was wrong.
"Not now," Steve whispered quickly, the command clear in his voice. This was not the time to start arguing with Fury. It would only end with Thor's agitation rising and possibly causing Bruce to lose control, the stress becoming too much for him.
A feeling of relief settled in Steve's chest, something that caused him to question why it had bothered him in the first place. He didn't care if Tony kissed people, why should he? Tony was his best friend and his closest confidant, it didn't bother him that Tony showed close attachment to others.
Thinking quickly, he took out his comm-link and handed it to Peter so he could talk to Tones for a minute. The second Peter heard his Dad's voice he visibly calmed down.
"No clue, he flew outta' here too fast for us to ask," Bruce shrugged. "Probably a nice girl, though."
"If it makes you feel any better, I got my powers from a spider bite...if that helps?" Peter asked softly, looking up at Steve innocently.
"I'm good, we're just gettin' street tacos!" Peter exclaimed, still blushing madly. He was clearly very nervous about his date and wanted to get out of the tower.
"You've never...we've never--you never kiss me," he sighed warily, meeting Tony's gaze head on, continuing on before Tones could interrupt him. "You kiss everyone else, everyone except me. I guess-I just...tell me why? Is it me? Is it us?"
"Actually, 3 of these are for you, Tones. I heard about Doom, figured I'd come check on you guys," Rhodey smiled, setting the carrier on the table.
Doom aimed a sonic blast right at Peter as he soared through the air, catching the flying hero straight in the chest hard enough to send him spiraling directly into a brick building.
Reaching up, Tony gently cupped Steve's cheeks to rub his thumbs along those sharp cheekbones, smiling at the Captain softly.
"I've always loved science over anything else. Specifically engineering, it's what I want to go into once I graduate," Peter shrugged shyly.
The people of New York had gone crazy when they caught wind of Spiderman fighting alongside the Avengers. The latest gossip was that Spiderman was a new Avenger, making his debut on the battlefield alongside the heroes for the first time. The coverage was on every major news sight and even premiered as the news top story of the morning.
"Sup', fam?" Tony sauntered into the kitchen with Steve and Peter trailing behind him. "You better not have touched my special roast coffee, Barton!"
"Gender neutral name for your partner?" Steve asked, taking a drink of his coffee. That one answer had him stumped.
While the fire fighters continued to take care Sandman, Steve watched Spiderman walk over to him, practically bouncing on his feet.
"Get off the floor and come sit, I'll make you something." Steve shook his head in amusement, watching Tony pounce up from the tile floor to head over to the table.
It didn't take long for them to reach the living room. Just as JARVIS said, Peter was sitting on the couch with the TV on, a bowl of popcorn on his lap with a blanket around his shoulders. He looked up when he heard the elevator doors open and smiled at them.
The question clearly stumped the kid, his poor hands shaking as he tried to come up with any reason why he couldn't. Taking pity on the boy, Steve stepped forward and put his hand on Spiderman's shoulder.
Due to his fame and acclimation for publicity, Tony was always the one who would have to cover press interviews about new heroes.
"Clint, give me one of those," he gestured to the small stack of paper beside the archer. Clint slid a few across the table to him, never once taking his eyes off his newest football projectile.
"You heard 'em. Be ready!" Steve ordered the fire fighters and the police officers assisting as well. They all gathered together, ready for action, holding 4 different hoses from the trucks ready to open fire at the super villain.
"These are old files--" Steve ducked another attack, punching his opponent out. "--almost four! Decades! Worth!"
The second Tony's gaze fell on the I.D that popped up on the screen, the coffee cup fell from his hand and shattered on the floor...
After Bruce, the next two to get a kiss from Tony was Natasha and Clint, during a impromptu breakfast with the team.
Ironman was Captain Americas first line of defense, his back-up and closest teammate. They always had each others backs, so to go into battle without the other was hard.
It took a minute for Tony to relax in his chair, leaning back to get comfortable so Steve could work. He was used to the super soldier sketching him and he also knew what would happen if he moved.
"If that is not enough incentive for you, try this. If SHIELD continues to harass my son, you will lose any and all Stark related tech you have at your disposal. Which means you lose Ironman."
So, why hadn't they moved forward? Steve knew Tony's sexual preferences didn't revolve around gender, so that clearly wasn't the problem. Physical health wasn't the reason either because Tony's heart was no longer in critical condition, so it wasn't like sex wasn't possible for him. Appearances couldn't be a factor either because Steve had seen every scar and flaw on Tony's body, stating on more than one occasion that the scars around the arc reactor were a sign of what Tony had survived all on his own, it proved how strong the genius was. It couldn't have been anything like that, Tony knew Steve didn't care what he looked like under his suits, so that was off the list of possibilities.
Fury glared at Tony with unfettered anger. "If you're withholding vital information, Stark, then I will personally put you under arrest for concealing fundamental intelligence from SHIELD."
"Well, invincible Spiderman, we gotta go drag your Dad out of the bat cave for breakfast." Steve nodded towards the door for Peter to follow him, waving to Natasha as he left.
Tony shook his head frantically, his heart racing. "We kept SHIELD away from him for a year, but now they know and they'll try too--"
Tony continued to scream at Fury, fighting against the agents holding him back away from the director. His insults turned into violent threats about what he would do if SHIELD came anywhere near his kid.
Steve worked quickly and soon had pancakes cooking away on the stove top, carefully picking out blueberries to use, glancing over at Tony every now and then as the genius read over something on the tablet screen. It was nice to just watch Tony work quietly. It showed off a side of the billionaire that no one else got to see, the soft side of Tony that only emerged in the solitude of their home.
"What are you talking about? Of course I love you, you know that." Tony shook his head in bewilderment, not understanding what Steve was upset about.
Steve shifted one of his arms under Peter's curled legs, hardly even feeling the weight of his kid against him, looking over at Tony for help. It hadn't occurred to him that this would be the first time he'd gone off on a mission without the team since Peter came into their lives.
After a nasty battle that left ten city blocks in chaos, a new asshole supervillian that had aspirations of world domination and Tony's favorite doughnut shop in ruin, a new superhero appeared asking the Avengers if they needed some help.
Honestly, the only thing Steve could fathom was that Tony simply wasn't interested, or attracted, to him in
"Your insight into Nanotechnology and mechatronic engineering is unreal. Your thesis was amazing and it's actually what made me what to go into engineering and after I--" Peter stumbled to a stop when Tony held his hand up.
Sure enough, Thor and Clint were in the kitchen. There was a spread of sandwich munchies on the kitchen island where Thor was busy crafting lunch. Clint was pouring himself a cup of coffee, groaning in delight over the steamy goodness.
Stepping close, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's hips to bring them close, enjoying the blush spreading across the genius' cheeks.
Next to receive a kiss was Natasha. She saved Tony the last breakfast pastry from Clint and Hulk, earning a soft brush of lips against her head. Clint still grumbles about it being the last strawberry filled pastry.
"No, it's all fine and dandy. I'll be stuck here with our hyperactive teen doing awesome science and you'll go off gallivanting across the great plains of Europe with Nat. It's fine. Really.
"I don't want to be patient, I want to fly up to Asgard and tell him to hurry up and come back! Why did Odin even call him back anyway? What could Thor do that the warriors couldn't?"
"You underestimate my power, Brucie," Tony snickered. "This is not my first round with 1,3,7-Trimethylpurine-2,6-dione!"
"And how'd that work out for you guys last time?" Bruce asked quietly, his growing rage diminishing slowly with Thor's gentle pats to his back.
"Peter is my new intern at Stark Industries. This kid's got a mind like Brucie Bear and yours truly."
Pete stopped and blushed, looking anywhere other than at his parents. He rubbed the back of his neck shyly and shrugged, "I--umm--I have a--
"Teacher! I know! SHIELD opened an interdimensional doorway that acted like a fucking homing beacon for a genocidal mad man. Turned the Earth into a giant battlefield. Raged a war against a titan that nearly destroyed us. All because SHIELD wanted to create weapons similar to those found on different planets, used by races far more advanced than we are, who actually know and understand how they work!" Tony exclaimed angrily, jabbing his finger at Fury. "And while we're on the subject, who was it that closed the portal that
"Tea is better than coffee," Bruce sniped. "It comes in a variety of flavors, it's calming and it helps with immune health."
"Thanks for the Joe, Brucie-bear." Tony slid up beside Bruce and softly pecked the mans cheek, shuffling off towards the elevator as Bruce fought back a blush.
The team succeeded in keeping the bots contained to just a couple blocks. With the police taking up street block-aids and firing at bots making it past the team, all the remaining civilians watching the battle were at least safe behind the lines. They still needed to rescue the people who were attacked in the crossfire though.
"Your Aunt tells me you're quite the science nerd," Tony started simply. "Highest scores in your grade, at that. Pretty impressive for a kid your age."
"Already made you some. JARVIS told me you were headed up from the bat cave," Bruce smirked, pointing to a fresh cup of steaming coffee sitting beside the coffee maker.
The dark haired genius still hadn't heard them come in, too engrossed with his work. Steve watched Peter slowly sneak up behind Tony, grinning mischievously, using his power of stealth to creep closer.
Steve had nearly had a heart attack when Peter introduced himself, quickly learning that the kid was only 14 years old! However, after his shock had gone down, he was filled with a sudden overwhelming urge to protect the kid. He wondered if that was how Bucky had felt with him when they were younger. Peter was so young and innocent, fawning over Cap and begging for a picture with his hero, basically falling over himself with hero worship.
"I'm leaving, feel free to do your Fabio and Esmeralda thing once I'm officially off the premises!" Peter rushed to the elevator, hitting the button for the roof, waving at his parents right as the doors closed.
Fun little fact: According to Tony Stark, the Ironman armor is susceptible to the affects of an EMP pulse. The arc reactor, because of how it is designed, does not work or depend on electricity, thus the pulse of an EMP would not affect it or harm Tony.
"No 'hank 'ou." Peter's voice was muffled around the mouthful of fluffy waffles he'd stuffed himself with. If anyone was keeping track, he was now on waffle number eleven.
"You may not have to wait long, Sir. My sensors are picking up rapid atmospheric readings directly above the tower," JARVIS stated suddenly.
"I'm craving some brunch. Would my loving Captain be so kind as to make me blueberry pancakes?" Tony asked sweetly, going as far as to bat his eyelashes like a dork. He knew all the best ways to get the super soldier to bend to his will.
He and Tony ran the team together. They fought flawlessly as a tag team in the field. Steve would even say that Tony was his best and closest friend, sharing a connection with the genius billionaire that he didn't experience with anyone else.
"I am not having trouble fighting Nazis!" Steve grumbled, tossing another soldier across the room! "Pete, slap Tones for me, please."
"It's nothing, forget I said anything, I'm being an idiot," Steve started while backing up towards the door, wishing he'd just kept his mouth shut. "We'll call Peter and go eat at that diner on 12th you love so much."
Sandman continued to fight them off but it was becoming desperate. The man knew he wouldn't escape unscathed, merely running from the team as well as police. What the Avengers were trying to do was capture Sandman and detain him before any more damage could be caused to the city.
He should have been home almost 20 minutes ago but he'd lost track of time whilst playing with a cute little cat in one of the back alleyways.
"It's all paper, Tones. Nothing digital, I already asked," Steve explained, kicking another brute in the back while blocking bullet fire from his side.
Steve surveyed the area and finished knocking out the other soldiers. He would have to meet up with Natasha and the team soon.
Why SHIELD didn't want the Avengers to go was a mystery, but as of late, Fury had done all he could to keep Tony away from SHIELD at all costs.
The young hero was small, much smaller than Steve, and his child-like enthusiasm made Steve's heart flutter for a moment. He was used to young fans admiring him but this was not just a fan, this was another hero, a young hero from the looks of it.
Steve rolled his eyes while resisting the urge to face-palm himself, watching Tony give a dramatic war cry as he continued to battle Sandman...quoting Braveheart all the while.
that for a fact now," Tony trailed off. "I just...I didn't wanna ruin what we had by coming off too forward. I thought that if you wanted to, you would make that step for us both."
Tony's eyes went wide and he suddenly understood what had Steve so upset, whispering, "That's what this is about?"
Steve rolled his eyes fondly at Tony's exaggerated smile, coming over to fill Tony's coffee mug again.
"Alright guys, I gotta run. Be safe, work hard, make me proud!" Tony waved to them all before blowing a kiss to each of them, signing off the call.
"Do you want to call Peter and see if he's hungry? I know he's got his history test tomorrow but the kid's been studying non-stop for hours on end and I swear if he downs anymore energy drinks he's gonna have a heart attc--"
"Let him go," he ordered roughly, watching the agents glance over at Fury for orders and that only pissed him off more. "Let. Him. Go. Or I will force you."
"That's fair...but, Tony, I came to terms with my own sexuality a long time ago and was never bothered by same sex couples like most everyone else from that time."
Cringing at the thought, he quickly moved on to other aspects of the video feed. Spiderman was clearly small in size, even shorter than Tony, with no sizeable muscle definition. The suit was...well...clearly not the
The first time Steve openly witnessed Tony's deep seated affection with another male was when Rhodey came to visit.
Steve really should be able to control himself better than that, clenching his fists to calm his nerves as they began to burst inside his head.
Sipping on his coffee, Tony continued to read over the news articles. They all deemed Spiderman a good person, the famed masked hero, most of his deeds congregating around Queens. If Tony were to guess, he'd say that Spiderman lived there. He'd already had JARVIS add some crucial details to his study of Spiderman, trying to narrow down their options.
Tony's eyes went wide and he suddenly understood what had Steve upset. Honestly, he felt like an idiot for not realizing sooner, but in his own defense he did have a good a reason.
Tony stopped his assault and hovered, turning back to Doom with a head tilt. His sarcasm levels skyrocketed!
"Wh--what? No! N-no, no, I'm just--I'm not--I mean--" Peter stumbled over his words in a panic, praying that a SWAT team of SHIELD agents weren't on their way to bust in the door.
Steve watched Tony slam into the pavement, fear fueling his movement towards his best friend. He reached for his comm-link while shoving his way through Doom's bots.
"I don't care if you ever turn evil and take over the world, I'll even help you after today because you saved my kid!"
It was right after school let out that Peter packed up his bag so he could go meet Ned at the park, Â hurrying down the steps with his bag shouldered. He wanted to get to the park before Ned did. It was nice enough outside and he wanted to snap some pictures. Since he wasn't going on patrol that night and he had his morning training session with Nat, he was free to do whatever he wanted.
"About time, Nicky. Thought I was gonna have to pay a poor barista a hundred bucks just to stay awake," Tony sniggered.
"I think you broke my spleen..." Peter moaned, wincing as he tried to stand up. "Yep. Definitely got a damaged spleen."
"Midgardians call these doughnuts. They are like small cakes with many different flavors. This one tastes like strawberries."
SHIELD had called in the Avengers for a meeting at their headquarters, more specifically, Fury had called them in.
Thor had piled up a large plate of food so Loki could try a bit of everything. His little brother had always been a bit picky with the food he ate, and Thor wanted him to try some new things. Peter even assisted in the endeavor, picking out a fruit parfait and a dish of pudding for the trickster.
It was a harsh thought, but Bruce was Tony's friend and he'd give anything to make sure Dr. Bruce Banner had the life he deserved.
Before long, a plate full of hot, stacked pancakes was in front of Tony alongside a bottle of warm syrup, ready to be devoured. Tony squeaked with joy and immediately doused the plate in an excessive amount of syrupy goodness.
Tony brought up the file and read over the medical report first. JARVIS was able to do a full scan on Spiderman when the young hero fought with the team against Sandman, taking readings from Ironman's mask as data. Using voice recognition and an advanced database for civilians based in New York, specifically Queens, JARVIS was able to get possibilities on the face behind Spiderman and then cross reference those possibilities with Spiderman's physical attributes.
"JARVIS, don't leave me!" Tony pleaded even as his screens went black, knowing what was to come. "This is gonna hurt..."
"I wish Peter were here, he'd have had this figured out by now," Bruce grumbled, scrutinizing their calculations once more.
Knowing he would only agitate himself further, Steve glanced at the clock on the wall to check the time. He and Tony were going out for lunch together, just the two of them like they always did unless other plans were made. Tony had been dying to go down to the small hole-in-the-wall diner he loved so much, they had the best burgers. He had roughly half an hour before lunch, might as well grab a shower and get ready.
The villains name had yet to be released yet, however, according to Nat, SHIELD was still interrogating him in isolated confinement.
Tony groaned in delight, quickly snatching the cup and downing half of it in one glorious, scalding swallow.
"I didn't ever want to risk loosing you, Cap. Even if it meant grasping for scraps of love when I could get them," Tony whispered sadly, trying to shrug it off. "I didn't want to push you away."
The team had been assembled out to handle an emergency call from the police force, claiming there was a super villain roaming the streets of Northern Brooklyn and that they were desperate for back-up. Naturally, the Avengers arrived to find said super villain, who called himself Sandman, indeed terrorizing citizens and destroying buildings...for whatever reason.
The first time Tony brought Peter to the Avengers' home was on a whim. He knew Peter was practically obsessed with the idea of getting to meet his childhood heroes, specifically Captain America. So one day, Tony brought the kid home to meet the team and officially introduce their newest honorary member.
"Captain, we only restrained Mr. Stark when he attempted to attack Director Fury." An agent holding Tony tried to appease the super soldier, but Steve cut him off with a heated glare.
Surely, it was clear to Tony that Steve loved him, right? Tony had been Steve's whole world for years, even before when they were only best friends. The dark haired genius had given Steve a home, a new life, a reason to keep on living that didn't involve his role as Captain America. Now he had Tony and Peter, the family he never imagined he would ever get. He'd given up on the white picket fence life after going into the ice, loosing Peggy, waking up in a new century.
Looking up at Tony who was standing behind Peter, Steve watched his best friend make a series of movements like he was playing charades? Confused, Steve saw Tony point down at Peter and then make a web-shooting action like Spiderman.
Steve quickly worked the face shield off, seeing a very pissed off Tony looking back at him. He couldn't help but feel relieved that his genius wasn't hurt too badly.
Loki looked from Tony to Thor, helplessly lifting his arms up in uncertainty. He didn't know how to deal with a blubbering mortal clinging to him like a koala! Thor just shrugged, smiling a little at his brother's discomfort.
Tony decides to pay a visit to our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. It isn't long before Peter becomes one of the team, and soon after, one of the family.
"Thor is our only air assault now. Spiderman's webs aren't having much of an effect on Doom," Steve explained, decapitating another bot.
Tony jumped up into Steve's arms and kissed him all over his face, both of them dissolving into laughter. Steve kept his hands firmly tucked under Tony's thighs and walked them both over to the couch, falling together in a tangle of limbs, hands desperately searching for more skin.
heavier than it looks!" Peter cried in astonishment, the weight of the golden helm pressing down on his head. "It's like 40 pounds!"
Steve pushed down his mild laughter and got to work getting the latches undone. It took only a few seconds to pull Tony from the dead metal, the billionaire cradling his arm to his chest in pain. Seeing that Tony was actually out of the suit, Steve couldn't help but reach out and feel the outline of the arc reactor for himself, seeing the soft blue light put him at ease.
Peter took off back into the air, swinging up above the street to fire more webs at Doom. Steve filled in Thor on the plan, they just had to wait for an opening.
Back at the tower, after everyone was taken care of and the streets cleaned up, Tony ordered a late lunch for everyone and a large order of fresh doughnuts because Peter wanted them.
"As much as I love that ginger haired, British cinnamon roll, I must confess that I have hung up my Hiddlestoner shoes. It just feels too weird to fan out over an actor that bears a
Tony gasped in horror as his favorite shop was utterly obliterated, watching glass spray across the street with the fading sound of a decimated siren.
Tony was bombarded by hundreds, if not thousands, of photos all revolving around Spiderman. From candid shots taken by fans to excellent shots from journalists, they all included the masked hero. What Tony was concerned about was the reasoning behind SHIELD's sudden interest.
"I'll eat when I'm done, Cap. I'll be in the lab, please don't need me for at least the next few hours," Tony grinned, grabbing his coffee cup to take with him as he headed for the elevator.
It had been amazing fighting side by side with the Avengers, don't get him wrong, but it had also been a bit insane for him. Being next to his childhood heroes, giving orders to them even, he'd had to go home immediately after and lie down, but only after calling May to tell her all about it!
The team had been called in early that morning to respond to another attack by Doom. The dictator was back at it again. His latest scheme? Publicly announcing his plan to force the United Nations to heed his demands for Latveria's expansion into new regions.
The kid was extremely young, hardly a teenager, and Steve immediately knew the boy was a science geek like Tony. Not wanting to seem rude, Steve smiled at the boy and held out his hand.
"What's this about, Doom?" Steve asked sternly, watching a few of Doom's bots surround him. The villain certainly wasn't taking any chances it seemed.
If anyone ever found out that Spiderman was just a kid from Queens, the world would probably lose their minds. Not to mention, SHIELD might try and get Peter to join them and that was not a future Pete wanted.
Peter stumbled into the room trying to pull on his shoe will walking, his hoodie hanging haphazardly on his frame.
"Snippy robot," Tony grumbled petulantly. "Fine, give me the longest video you've currently got of the real Spiderman."
Thor smiled softly and leaned down to Peter's level, touching his own forehead to the teens. Peter laughed in delight and instantly decided that was how he would be greeting the Asgardian brothers from now on.
Tony's attitude was not only due to the ungodly early hour, but also because Steve was leaving and he would always try and distant himself like he would in the past, it was a way to keep himself grounded. Steve was used to it though, seeing it as just another aspect of Tony's personality. The genius was soft hearted.
"Apologies Sirs, Peter is requesting entrance into the lab. It would seem he has had a scientific breakthrough and desires the lab for further testing. I should inform you both that it is also 3:15 am," the AI explained, bringing the lights up to 20%. The rattling at the door continued along with knocking, Peter's voice on the other side questioning JARVIS about what was going on.
Peter watched them quietly, intrigued by the affectionate gesture and wondered if it was a social thing on Asgard or if it was between only the brothers. He didn't want to intrude on the tender moment.
In a flash, Tony was up and off the couch just as there was a bright flash of light, one that could only be associated with the Bifrost. Sure enough, as the light dimmed, Thor stood on the balcony with Mjolnir clutched in his hand. The thunderer waved to them as JARVIS opened the glass doors for him.
"Petey...baby...your old man has a heart condition," he stammered, gripping his chest over the arc reactor. "You're gonna give me a heart attack one of these days, kid."
"I haven't slept in 57 hours and it's been 32 hours since my last meal that didn't include Redbull, but it's okay 'cause I can hear colors and smell sounds! This is what it's like to ascend to Godhood!" Pete exclaimed loudly, shooting out another web.
Every reporter had jumped at the chance to get dirt on Tony, even throwing questions at Strange too. Tony had waved off the questions with mild exasperation, telling the crews that the conference was over and that any questions regarding S.I and it's plans would be answered by Pepper Potts. After that, Tony lead the way off the stage with Strange and Reed following close behind.
Tony and Thor did as instructed, skirting out of the way to avoid the hoses. Thankfully, Sandman didn't seem to understand the trap that had been laid for him until it was too late. The water was turned on and every hose aimed at the villain shot to life, drenching the man. The sand he tried to send out as a barrier was quickly drowned out, falling to the ground in a thick sludge.
Steve rolled his eyes in fondness for his little genius',Â "Pete, you'll be too busy keepin' your old man outta' trouble to even realize I'm gone."
Steve rolled his eyes at his friend's persistent pout. "Not indestructible, merely stout. I can get hurt as easily as you can."
Peter nodded, jumping a bit to psych himself up before running at Natasha again, leaping up into the air in a full body spin to wrap his legs around her upper body. It was one of Nat's favorite moves to bring down someone of any size and she wanted Pete to learn it. It would come in very handy in close to hand combat, and it was non-lethal.
"Steve?" Tony looked up at the super soldier in bewilderment, not understanding what Steve was upset about. "What's going on? You're making me worry."
Steve stared at the ground between their feet, hating himself for being unable to control his damn emotions.
Loki took the offered hand in his own, giving Peter a small smirk. "You seem to already know who I am, but allow me to introduce myself. I am Loki of Asgard, God of Mischief. A pleasure to meet you Peter Parker."
"See?" Steve smiled at Peter's enthusiastic nod, sending the teen off to continue the fight. Doom had rid himself of the webs and had already continued his assault.
worked for SHIELD, but they had stated on more than one occasion that their loyalty lied with the Avengers.
Bruce was his own person, unwilling to allow himself to be used as a weapon no matter how many threats Ross threw at them.
"Priority One, scrap the file and keep it under lock. If Stark found out about this," Fury trailed off, rubbing his eyes.
That. Fuckin'. Does it!" he yelled furiously, charging up his repulsors and aiming them at Sandman's turned back, resorting to lethal strikes.
he thought helplessly, fighting the urge to hang up. His spidey sense was going off in alarm, a nervous chill coming up his neck as he looked around. From the corner of his eye he noticed a few people that stood out on the street.
The flash of anger in Fury's eyes at the vague threat was gone as quickly as it arose, masked by years of practice. Instead of rebuking Thor or arguing with the thunder God, Fury merely held up his hands in mock surrender. "I'm only using Loki as an example for lack of a better one."
"Steve, a little help please!" Bruce grumbled, still trying to catch Peter by himself. The poor scientist was already tired himself and turning a little green.
Having had enough of the growing tension within the room, Steve slowly stood up after pocketing his drawing. Reaching out to grab Tony's hand in his own, he turned his mild glare over to Fury as he made to head towards the door.
Next was Thor. The god had returned from Asgard after being away for a few weeks and Tony had been the first to greet him back, pecking him on the lips happily. Thor had been ecstatic, claiming that in Asgard it was a sign of true friendship or love to greet a fellow brother in such a way. Soon enough it became routine for Tony to greet Thor this way.
Bruce looked from Tony to Peter and back again, "We're keeping him right? Please tell me we're keeping him."
"Your son's at the door," Tony groaned while snuggling back down against Steve's warm chest. He was too tired to move or get up. Petey could wait.
The thought of a boy as young as Parker out each night taking down criminals was not one Tony wanted to think about. He could imagine one of those crooks having a loaded weapon, one bullet, one wrong move.
"This is a training session, not a fight, but you are correct. In a true fight, you use every strength and skill you have to defeat your enemy."
Tony smirked, imagining the sight of a couple soldiers sneaking off for some alone time. "Well, when you put it like that."
Steve sighed heavily and quickened his pace over to the fray. The second Pete caught sight of him, the webbed hero shot a web right onto Doom's face to distract him, landing over beside the Captain.
Do you wanna call Pete and see if he wants to come with us? He's been studying like crazy for his finals and I can guarantee you he hasn't had any actual food besides energy drinks," Tony shook his head fondly, looking up at Steve who was still silent and frowned slightly. "What's wrong?"
The scowl on Tony's face was a mixture of petulant and true annoyance that he was getting left behind. It was enough to have Steve smiling, pulling his genius into a warm hug.
Hitting the button for the common floor, Steve pulled Tony away from the wall to lean against him. He learned early on that Tony needed physical contact when he was feeling anxious.
"Great, then who's ready for some lunch?" Tony asked with a smirk. "What do you say, Spiderman? Wanna join us for some nommers?"
His days used to revolve around back breaking work outs, strict regimens that had been instilled in him during his time in the army, working with his teammates to preform at their best.
Fury sighed and shut the laptop, shaking his head. The fear on Howard's face as he was murdered, the violent way Maria's neck was crushed...and the gleam of a weaponized metal arm that could only belong to one person.
Tony seemed to calm down when he saw Peter, the tense feeling in his shoulders loosening as Steve let go of him. He sighed deeply, nodding in agreement.
"Absolutely! I'm your man, Captain!" Spiderman exclaimed excitedly, shooting a web up to pull himself from the ground, aiming towards Ironman and the jet.
Steve smiled as Tony flopped down on the couch beside Peter, snuggling up beneath the blanket with their kid to share the popcorn.
A sharp cough from the group of agents standing by them had Steve turning towards them, catching one giving him a sour face.
Steve swallowed, pushing up his courage to ask the burning questions in his head. "You love me, right?"
"Guess we'll just have to wait and see," Tony admitted. "It's bad enough that SHIELD looks to be interested in recruiting him. The kid hardly looks old enough."
"Pep, I have the upmost faith in you to handle the leeches like you always do," Tony said while sipping on a coffee. "People wanna talk, let 'em."
Color him surprised when he listened to Tones bellow out Frank Sinatra at full volume for the first time.
It should have been, but unfortunately it did nothing to stop the stirrings of jealousy he felt every time he caught Tony's affection directed elsewhere. It was a little silly how something as simple as a wink could make the Captain's stomach clench with mild envy. It wasn't so much to say that Steve didn't show his own affection for Tony though, because he did, quite often in fact. It was very clear to the world that Captain America was protective of Ironman.
For whatever reason, Thor had been forced to return to Asgard for a few weeks by Odin's command. Knowing he must heed the Allfather's call, Thor left with haste, leaving before anyone could properly say goodbye.
From across the table, Steve watched the whole ordeal silently, an antsy feeling washing over him after seeing Tony kiss Rhodes. Was that a thing? He knew Tony and Rhodey were close, but he'd always been under the impression that they were brothers?
After the whole SHIELD fiasco, it was safe to say that they were all a little worried for Peter's next patrol...
"Don't worry, Peter will most likely be spending quite a bit of time around here in the near future," Tony stated. "That was one of the biggest reasons I brought him over today."
Tony wasn't pleased with the order but he did back down, throwing Thor an apologetic look which the God returned with an appreciative smile.
It shouldn't have been a big deal and it definitely shouldn't have bothered Steve as much as it did.
Bruce looked up from his work when he heard Tony gasp, holding his palms up to silently ask what was wrong.
Fury rolled his eyes and looked at the agents holding Tony back, pointing to the door. "Get him out of here!"
For the longest time, Steve kept his emotions in check and tried to ignore the envious feelings rising within him every time he had to watch someone else receive Tony's affections. It was just something he got used to after awhile. Clearly, Tony was not interested in gracing him with physical affection...and that was fine.
Hence, explosions going off, people getting injured in the crossfire, a very pissed off super villain threatening the lives of world leaders and the Avengers getting called in to put a stop to it all. News vans from every major channel were already present at the scene.
"I have finished my report on Spiderman." JARVIS brought the latest files he'd created on the masked hero, a medical file at the top of the list. "The results may shock you, Sir."
A flourish of red and blue flew up to the screen, focusing in on the mask of the person caught on the camera.
Peter ends up spending more and more time at the Avengers' home as well as Stark Industries, basically living with the team. Peter's aunt had been so excited to learn about Tony taking Peter under his wing, knowing there was no better place for Pete than with the Avengers.
"This is Peter, my new intern over at S.I. He's shaping up to be one of the brightest minds on the planet." Tony boasted over Peter proudly like a papa peacock strutting his feathers.
"Keep those hoses on him, men. Widow, I need your black widow bites to detain Sandman," Steve instructed, watching Nat slowly lower the jet to the street.
"Doom is above such trivial things as degrees. For there is nothing any college could teach that Doom does not already know."
The jet landed a half block down from the United Nations headquarters. Natasha took the railbike to do ground work. Clint took to the sky for a perch. Bruce was on medical control. Thor and Tony would handle the air and Steve would be on the ground.
It was a fairly normal morning for the whole team, but no one would be prepared for how the day would end...
Steve was technically retired as far as the military was concerned, and if you wanted to get really technical, Steve Rogers as Captain America was not property of SHIELD but of Stark Industry. Howard created the shield, formed SHIELD with Peggy, and co-created the serum. So, by default, SHIELD had no claim over the Captain.
Doom glared at the God of mischief with intense disdain. Knowing he would not win this battle, the dictator powered up his wrist device and disappeared without a trace.
Tony glanced back at the door and felt a little bad for having to turn down the offer, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
"If you guys are ever in Queens, streetcart-dogs are on me!" Spiderman yelled, disappearing around the buildings just as quickly as he had arrived.
rage emanation, could ever be considered unworthy of me. If you disagree with my affiliations due to the mortality of these individuals, might I suggest altering your vindication of a worthy ally."
"If I wanted to live my life by the way of degrading, obsolete gender roles...I wouldn't have committed treason to recruit myself into the army, nor would I have mutilated my genetic make-up to become a guinea pig for a super soldier experiment. I fought to change this country, for the better, not to let it waste away as a cesspool of derogatory toxic masculinity that tries to oppress others based on outdated opinions, like thinking me calling my son
Tony sighed happily, closing his laptop down and searching for his jacket,Â "Sorry about that, got caught up in the latest experiment. The kids are pumped to get started on it and needed some help getting everything ready. You ready to go?"
After a nasty battle that left ten city blocks in chaos, a new asshole supervillian that had aspirations of world domination and Tony's favorite doughnut shop destroyed in the chaos, Spiderman appeared out of nowhere asking the Avengers if they needed some help. The newspapers went crazy after witnesses claimed to see Spiderman teaming up with the Avengers!
Peter wouldn't have it, clinging even tighter to Steve's shoulders as he koala'd himself around his Pops. He'd web himself to Steve if he had to!
Before any more retorts could be made, the door of the meeting room opened and Fury strolled in with a folder of paperwork and a laptop, setting the computer on the table beside him as he took a seat.
Tony knew that Pete would be upset about Steve leaving for awhile, and even though it didn't seem like a long time, they had gotten into a very steady routine. Peter lived at the tower and always saw his Dads every single day...this would be the first time they'd be apart.
"As do I," Loki smiled mischievously. With a snap of his fingers, the remaining Doom-Bots seized up their motions, sparking out of control, their parts suddenly disconnected from one another. The team watched in surprise as the bots all, literally, fell apart onto the ground.
"Telling you," Pete said seriously. He couldn't help it if he was a little nervous. It wasn't like one of his heroes was sitting in front of him or anything! The billionaire stared at him for a few moments, as though he were studying him.
"JARVIS? Can you call the team together? I brought fresh pastries from that little cafe down the block for everyone."
"Yeah, but where's the fun in that?" he asked, tightening down another bolt in the Ironman armor. He figured it could use a good cleaning and had spent the last hour inspecting it for flaws. He prided himself on being meticulous with his designs.
Steve rushed over and pulled Tony away from the machine, fearing Tony's safety since he had no idea what it was the genius was working on, but he was pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be glowing.
It was true. Victor Von Doom may be many things but no one could debate that the man was a genius of the highest caliber. With a background in physics, it was not too far fetched to believe Doom figured out teleportation.
Rolling his eyes, Steve glanced around the room for something to occupy him. It was boring enough watching Clint make paper projectiles and Thor toss Mjolnir around.
Tony had given Peter his own room within a few weeks just because of how often the kid stayed over. Pete begins to see the team as his family, especially Tony and Steve. He even calls Tony
Anyone who dared to enter the training room with a frustrated Captain America pounding away at a sandbag was either very brave, or a lunatic.
The kid was good, they'd give him that. His quick thinking had not only saved the day but had also proved to them that Spiderman was a worthy ally. It would be interesting to see how he did in the future.
It's simply intelligence you want for SHIELD. Last time I checked, SHIELD was tasked with maintaining threats both national and global."
...you should be watching Disney, worried about school and grades, acne, if you're gonna get a date for prom," Tony urged, desperately. "Not low-life, petty criminals and whether or not you'll make it home every night..."
SHIELD had called the Avengers in to deal with Doom being a typical tyrant, scaring the locals, causing havoc, normal Tuesday by that point. What they hadn't planned on was the fight lasting so long. Doom had managed to evade them for hours, sending in his Doom-Bots to do battle in his place while he continued to flee, sending the team on a wile goose chase.
Steve looked up when Tony walked in the door, startling the dark haired genius enough for Tony to jump.
Steve smiled, knowing Thor would enjoy the sweets. "Plenty more, try some of the others. You might like the chocolate ones."
"Oh, ummm...I think Dad is--" Peter began to look around for any sign of his parents but was suddenly cut off by Tony rushing towards him, with Steve running after Tony.
That seemed to make Spiderman feel better, his shoulders slumping with ease. The kid was evidently worried that it was a one-time offer. Once good-byes were exchanged, the webbed hero shot a web up towards the high buildings above them, jumping from the ground.
After winding down for a couple hours and cleaning up, Tony felt human again once he had showered and retired his suit. JARVIS had already begun running the normal diagnostics and claimed he detected a mild anomaly, nothing that couldn't be fixed but it meant hours of computer programming in the near future.
Tony and Steve shared a look, an amused look, knowing they wouldn't be getting an answer. It wasn't long before the rest of the team joined them on the ground. Thor landed next to them and offered his own commendations towards Spiderman.
"How long are you gonna be gone?" Tony asked as he helped Steve load up another duffel bag onto the jet. Ever since he learned Steve would be taking off with Nat for SHIELD, he'd been a bit clingy. It wasn't often the team separated for missions and Tony wasn't used to Steve being gone. It had been so long since the last solo mission that he'd honestly forgotten what it was like to
Peter felt his heart stutter, anxiety rushing up through his chest to fill his lungs. There was only one person who would know that and have the ability to get his private number.
"And when you two start speaking a different language I know to bounce, I'm out!" Peter cried, throwing his hands up as he backed up towards the door for a quick escape. "I really don't need to see you two making heart eyes at each other, wait for me to leave at least!"
Steve grabbed a fresh pair of socks, slipping them on. He tugged on his shirt and tucked it into his pants, fastening his boots quickly after slipping them on too. His stealth suit was still laying beside Tony, which he grabbed to slide on over his undershirt as Tony stood up. The genius set his mug down and grabbed Steve's utility belt from the bed, wrapping it around the super soldier's waist as Steve secured his stealth armor.
Peter gathered his phone and his hoodie, rushing out the door to catch up with Steve down the hallway.
Doom crossed his arms, watching his bots attempt to stop the raging Captain in his tracks. They could be rebuilt with ease, though he did enjoy watching the Captain suffer.
Tony smiled innocently and refilled his coffee mug, smirking when he noticed it was one of the Captain America mugs he'd bought as a joke for Steve.
The first time Steve saw Tony kiss another person, specifically another male, was when Rhodey had visited and brought Tony Starbucks. The genius had practically squealed in delight before pecking Rhodes smack on the lips. After witnessing this, Steve had briefly wondered if there was something more to the relationship between the two men, but Bruce had been quick to inform him that it was just something Tony did. Steve knew all about Tony's heritage and knew that it was common in Italy as a greeting, but he quickly realized that Tony seemed to grace everyone with his special kisses except Steve himself.
Peter was still teeming with energy as he flew in the window of his bedroom. He was late for dinner and frantically shed his suit, throwing it into his bag to hide while struggling to find regular clothes. He could hear Aunt May downstairs and knew she was expecting him.
"Can someone please explain to me why JARVIS just told me that Spiderman was having lunch with us?" Bruce stepped into the kitchen with his tablet in hand, confused at the whole gathering of heroes.
, clearly disgruntled by Tony's remark.Â "What else am I supposed to do when I have powers like these? I can't just sit around and do nothing!"
"What do you think? Will we be seeing more of our webbed superhero?" Steve asked quietly, setting a fresh cup of coffee next to Tony.
He knew Peter was practically obsessed with the idea of getting to meet his childhood heroes, specifically Captain America.
"If you wish," Loki grinned. "By your own claims, you believe that the Avengers are unbefitting allies due to their qualities. Though I fail to understand how the God of Thunder and a genetically enhanced super soldier, as well as a genius scientist with
The cameras all focused in on Tony and Doctor Strange, snapping pictures with bright flashes, calling for the heroes to turn for a better photo. During the handshake and all the cameras flashing, Tony and Strange leaned in for a kiss on each cheek with Tony smiling happily for the press.
Tony was already heading towards the elevator with his phone out, waving to them over his shoulder without a second glance backwards.
Loki continued to stare at the odd food, trying to understand how something so strange could taste like a fruit.
Loki glanced down at Peter's wide eyed wonderment. To the shock of everyone, including himself, Loki removed his helmet and gently placed it on Peter's head. The front of the helm dropped down beneath Peter's eyes, both his hands coming up to grab the horns to keep it in place.
"Farewell, Spiderman..." Doom boasted, aiming a beam at Peter's head. From that range, Pete knew it could kill him. He braced his hands up to cover his face and prayed the blast wouldn't kill him. Before anyone could move, there was a bright flash of golden light and the super villain was sent careening backwards!
"They aren't together, Cap," Bruce interrupted with a small laugh, shaking his head. He already knew what Steve was insinuating and honestly couldn't blame him. Tony was affectionate with everyone, it was something you got used to seeing.
Tony lept at Fury in rage, causing the agents around him to scramble into action to hold him back. The genius had the agents struggling to control him, one of them even reaching for their taser as a last resort.
Steve reached for his comm-link, helping Tony get clear of any fire headed their way. "Bruce, Tony needs medical attention. I'm sending him to the jet now."
"Umm, Mr. Rogers, Sir? Y-you know I can hear you, right?" Peter asked quietly, looking between the two super heroes. He didn't want to seem rude but it felt a little strange to have two of his models arguing over him while he was standing between them.
Steve stopped Pete by calmly reaching out to grab his shoulders, turning his sons attention back to him.
While the two idiots were arguing over the last of the filled pasties, Natasha slipped over and swiftly took the box from Clint's hands.
Steve took care of the military side while Tony took care of the science field that was interested in Peter, including Oscorp, and Natasha made her case against SHIELD for the final time.
"Yeah!" Steve ducked and dulled out a sharp upper cut against his current opponent, but then another guy jumped onto his back to try and get him in a choke hold. "The pap-
"I know, but I promise it won't be any longer than that. No one can take down your old man, remember? Not even wanna-be Nazi supremacists." Steve smirked, hearing the small laugh from Peter over the phone. "Listen, I gotta go. Your aunt Nat is giving me the face."
"I do not understand how something can be so light and soft yet so sweet at the same time, I love it!"
Apologies for any mistakes. I'm trying to get these chapters done as fast as possible for you guys. Read and Review, let me know what you guys think and as always, Thanks for reading!
"Tony, answer me!" he screamed. When no response came through, Steve doubled his efforts to reach his fallen teammate. Every bot that tried to block his path was cut down by the shield. Broken pieces of metal littering the road and sidewalks around him.
"Hurry up and come up with a plan, Cap! He's getting too close to my doughnuts for comfort!" Tony cried, watching Sandman edge closer and closer to his preferred doughnut shop, Crispey Creamy, located down the street and right in the path of the super villain. There was a police block-aid set up to try and stop Sandman, but they all knew it would do little to stop the maniac.
need medical attention," Steve ordered sternly, glaring mildly at Tony who's arm wasn't finished yet. "Back to the jet with you."
Peter didn't even register the second person in the room, he was too busy excitedly telling Mr. Stark about his discoveries.
Steve was cooking breakfast, as usual, working diligently around the kitchen while music played quietly from the speakers set up on the counter. After Tony found out the super soldier liked to listen to music while he cooked, the genius had set up a small Bluetooth stereo system in the kitchen, teasing Steve for his taste in music.
"Ignore him, Pete. He's just jealous he can't pull of spandex like you can," Tony teased, ruffling Peter's hair before kissing his cheek. "Be home before midnight, please?"
Tony remained the same, keeping his target in sight. "This is bigger than us, Cap. This is bigger than rules...this is
"Clint is off doing something for SHIELD, Thor took a short trip with Loki somewhere and I couldn't get ahold of Rhodey."
Tony took note of Spiderman's actions, observing the way the young hero held himself and spoke. Spiderman seemed mindful of his speech, never once using any term or sign to give away his possible age.
"What heart?" Tony joked, tapping the glowing light of the arc reactor. "Another 3 cups of this stuff and I'll be rearin' to go for another 24 hours!"
Tony made a non-committal shrug, taking a large sip from his mug. His back was aching from sleeping on the couch and he was tired, emotionally and physically. Really, he still pissed off at Fury for keeping them in the dark about this mission. He was still tempted to hack SHIELD again and see what the deal was.
"Are you sure you will not stay?" Thor asked softly, watching Loki tuck his helmet beneath his arm, his green cape adorning his shoulders once more.
They'd danced around one another for years even before Peter came into their lives. Everyone who worked with the team or with SHIELD knew that Ironman and Captain America came as a set duo. If you wanted one, you would get the other as well. They refused to be separated from each other both on and off the battlefield.
"The chocolate cake ones are my favorite, they're really thick." Peter held up one for Loki to try as well, offering to share.
Steve had ended the conversation promptly by stating they knew very little, practically nothing, about Spiderman and that it was the young hero who saved the day.
"Tony's right. If Doom managed to procure technology pertaining to teleportation then we need to focus on how to get that tech away from him, not waste time figuring out where he got it," Bruce broke in. "Plus, Victor is a genius with a mind like a computer."
Peter ended up spending more and more time at the Avengers home and Stark Industries, basically living with the team part time with his own room. It didn't take long before he became one of the family, and Peter soon views the team as his family as well, especially Tony and Steve. He even started calling Tony
After an exhausting night of movies, popcorn and an absurd amount of cheese pizza, Steve, Tony and Peter had crashed on the living room couch together in a tangled heap of limbs. Before long, dawn was beginning to approach and Steve was awakened by a harsh kick to his ribs, via Peter's foot! The kid was a heavy sleeper, but boy did he pack a harsh jab when dreaming.
The kiss slowly came to an end when they were forced to break for air. Tony could feel his knees wobbling, Steve's strong arms around him were all that kept him from sliding to the floor in puddle.
"Ironman, we have another player in the air," Steve spoke into his comm, smirking as Spiderman soared over his head to join in. "Spiderman has officially joined the party."
"I wouldn't bother hanging up or trying to run from this conversation, Mr. Parker. All I'd like to do is talk."
"Latveria's prosperity," Doom stated simply. With a wave of his hand, the Doom-Bots began their assault against the heroes.
Fury went deadly silent, glowering darkly. Unfortunately, Tony wasn't done berating him yet. The genius cocked his head to the side, feigning a thoughtful pose.
"Yep! Cap can fight bad guys, cook like a pro, even does his own laundry. Perfect husband material."
or that I ever agreed with it. Next time you make assumptions about someone, keep it to yourself." Steve glared at the agent, watching the man shuffle back a few feet under his harsh gaze.
"I need sustenance!" Tony cried, dramatically dragging himself into the kitchen. "Particularly that of the chemical solution variety..."
If Doom was surprised by the arrival of the Avengers, he did not show it. In fact, he seemed to have been waiting for them...which was never good.
"Tony," Steve spoke up suddenly, lowering his paper again with an uneasy look.Â "Was he wearing his Spiderman suit under his hoodie?"
you are not, little one." Thor smiled, knowingly. "I am older than you could possibly imagine, I know a young warrior when I see one."
Down in the lab, Tony set his things on his desk before bringing up the computer files on Spiderman.
"Yep, all good. She was just calling to verify a meeting I have to be at later on this week. Are any of those filled?" Tony asked pointing to the open boxes of doughnuts.
After a gracious round of love making and an earth shattering myriad of orgasms, Tony and Steve had passed out on the large couch down in the lab. It wasn't until many hours later that they awoke to the sound of the lab doors rattling, along with JARVIS speaking up above their heads.
"What's your deal, Victor? Terrorizing your homeland wasn't enough so you come and bully ours?" Tony yelled, firing a blast at one of the bots.
"Wear a bell!" Tony tried to calm his racing heart a bit, nodding his own greeting to the Captain. "What's up?"
"Widow found another storage facility like the first one that may contain more information that SHIELD wants. Only problem--!" he blocked an incoming attack, punching the soldier in the chest. "--is that it's located somewhere else. It'll take at least another day to reach it."
"Think of what time period you're from, Cap. Back in the 30's and 40's? Would you have been comfortable being kisses by another man? Even a small peck on the cheek? Homophobia was so rampant that even a small gesture, regardless of whether it was sexual or not, was still
"You're tellin' me. I was already tired before all this shit started and now look!" Tony gestured to the window. "We started this fight at 7pm, look at how long we chased after that nutjob! It's
"You mean the device Doom used to preform a complete quantum entanglement from one physical space to another unknown location?"
"Put your hands in the air if you're wired and tired!" Pete yelled, sprinting past Bruce once again to run back up the wall!
Steve was unamused when Tony gave the sorcerer a small peck on the cheek during the last handshake, catching Strange giving Tones a quick wink and a smile after. He started beating the brownie batter just a bit too hard.
"You would condone sending a fifteen year old high school student out into a battle field?" he asked stormily.
"Don't worry, son. We'll take care of things here," he offered softly. "You're welcome to join us anytime."
"You never kiss me," he sighed warily, meeting Tony's gaze head on. Before Tony could even reply he continued on. "You kiss everyone else, everyone except me. I guess-I just...can I just know why? Just tell me why?" he asked quietly.
It was true too. Loki had been the one to contain the power of the tesseract himself, banishing the alien army that had tried to attack the Earth. Sure, he'd stuck around to cause havoc and a bit of chaos but nothing too crazy. He was the God of Mischief, after all.
"Speak of the little Devil....Hey, Pete. Did you and Ned get to---what? Honey, slow down. What happened?"
It was the morning after the fight against Sandman and the news stream was going insane over the coverage. Fury had called them and demanded to know why Spiderman had joined the battle, asking them questions about the masked hero.
"Easy, Tones. I doubt Fury will keep us waiting much longer," Bruce tried to quell Tony's rising fury. They had been waiting for almost half an hour with no word from Fury or the agents stationed outside the doors. Some coffee had been brought in along with water, but that did little to pacify Tony.
Peter didn't last very long, sliding down the couch to pillow against Steve's thigh with a heavy sigh. He'd munched down a sandwich and a glass of milk before crashing on the couch. The opening credits had hardly finished before his eyes began to close.
"It's been too long since you've gone solo...what if you make a mistake because you think I'm watching you like always?"
"The people are loving this!" Clint exclaimed loudly, turning up the volume on the TV from the living room.
Music poured from the speakers on Tony's work bench, Dum-E and U were gathering tools up and said dark haired genius was digging through a machine, tossing parts this way and that. When Tony heard the doors open he looked up sharply.
Tony glanced over to Steve to see the man shrug helplessly, knowing they couldn't stop Peter even if they wanted. The kid wanted to fight crime and protect the city, who were they to say no?
"Think of what time period you're from. Back in the 30's and 40's? Would you have been comfortable being kissed by another man? Even something as small as a peck on the cheek? Homophobia was so rampant that even a small non-sexual gestures were still wrong. I didn't think you would approve of anything like that...not at first."
Needless to say, it was quite the spectacle to see Tony Stark yell and threaten Nick Fury in fluent Italian all while trying to climb over the agents attempting to hold him back. Very few people had ever seen Fury intimidated, but Tony had made his point that day.
"I'm bringin' the party to you guys!" Tony related loudly over the comms, rounding the corner with an angry Sandman rushing after him, Thor's bolts of lightning chasing them down the street.
Steve set a plate of two waffles in front of Tony, made a bit differently for his genius. The super soldier had started making Tony's pancakes and waffles with almond flour, egg whites and coconut oil for a healthier option. He was always concerned with Tony's well-being and would go the extra mile to make sure Tony at least ate better with his heart condition.
Steve smiled at Tony's outburst, knowing his best friend was bone tired and running on fumes, just like he was. Hopefully Tony would be in a better mood after having some coffee when they got home.
The first stop was, of course, Tony's lab. He figured he could let the kid geek out for awhile before turning him loose on the others.
"There's plenty for everyone, and how many times do we have to talk about the air-vents? Stop traveling through the tower through the vents and just use a door!" Steve scolded, watching Barton forage through the boxes to find the jelly filled sweets.
"Will you be home tonight?" Tony asked slyly, smirking as Peter's face went from blushing to scarlet red.
With a sly shrug, Loki gave the Latverian ruler a wink. "My predilection for mischief and mayhem knows no bounds."
"Can someone please tell me why JARVIS just told me Peter left on a date!" Clint cried from the hallway, rushing into the room with wide eyes.
"What are you boys arguing about?" Natasha asked, sweeping into the room with a stack of folders under her arm.
"Spiderman is currently the most popular hero on social media, Sir. Video feed continues to stream in every second pertaining to Spiderman. I will inform you when I have sufficient data to report."
By the time Tony had located Doom for SHIELD to take down, it was morning. The genius had not been pleased by any means, but then again neither had anyone else. They were all exhausted and worn down to the bone. Clint had suffered a minor injury during the fight, leaving him and Natasha in medical. Bruce had sulked off to wind down after letting the Hulk out and Thor claimed he was flying back to the tower alone. Steve had collapsed in the passenger seat of the jet with Tony piloting, tugging his cowl off with an exhausted groan.
"Your disposition is, as always, a labyrinthine of contradictory tendencies," Doom complained with heavy resentment.
"Round up the soldiers and catalouge everything SHIELD wants. I want this mission finished so I can go home already."
Tony nodded with excitement, "Experimenting while under the affects of sleep deprivation and high levels of caffeine during the early hours of dawns light is the height of the mortal existence! No test runs, we die like men!"
Both Thor and Clint went wide-eyed and dead silent. The coffee cup fell right out Clint's hand and crashed to the floor, the archer blinking dumbly.
"The good Captain is correct, Tony. Though in your defense, all midguardians are tiny in comparison to me," Thor grinned.
"Captain America can cook?" Peter asked astonished. He couldn't imagine Captain America taking down criminals with his awesome shield and then going home to cook omelettes.
"I will be in just a moment," Tony grinned. He took a quick sip from his cup but suddenly sputtered, causing Steve and Bruce to look up at him in concern.
Steve ignored Doom's taunts as he skidded to his knees next to the Ironman armor. The hunk of metal was essentially lifeless, the eyes no longer alight. Steve was afraid to touch Tony out of fear that the genius was undoubtedly hurt by the fall.
"You have no idea," Tony smirked back, quickly pecking Thor's lips happily! "It's been too quiet around here without you, big guy."
"I'll make you dinner later," Steve whispered, latching onto Tony's neck to mark every inch of skin.
Thinking quickly, Steve tried to come up with a solution. He wasn't set to leave until morning, so why not spend the rest of the day with his family before
Thor picked one of the iced ones and bit into it, licking the icing from his lips with a look of awe, "Fascinating."
Steve smirked, bending lower to kiss his genius all over his face, Tony dissolving into laughter as he was swiftly lifted off the ground. Steve kept his hands firmly tucked under Tony's thighs and walked them over to the couch, falling together in a tangle of limbs.
"Bruce is still on the ship winding down. Stress levels got a little too high," Clint explained. "Good job out there, Spidey. Quick thinking."
Steve turned to look out the window at Tony once more, catching the genius blowing him a kiss in goodbye.
That began the budding relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, one that seemed to be built on paternal instincts and familial bonds. Peter became an intern under Tony at S.I, working the young teen up to what it would be like working in a lab environment.
"And I thought the world couldn't get any crazier after I woke up..." Steve groaned, shaking his head. "How old are you, Peter?"
It was too damn quiet without the thunderer around to liven things up. They were all used to hearing boisterous laughter from the Norse God filling the silence. Needless to say, Tony was extremely happy when Thor returned in a flurry of wind and light out on the balcony of the tower.
