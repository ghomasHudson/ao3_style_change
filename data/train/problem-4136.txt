Again, Cas complied, like the good boy he was. Luckily, everything fit in the bag and he put it all in the trunk while Dean scrubbed. When he walked back, he wanted to help more. “What can I do now, Dean?”
They hold each other so long that Miracle nuzzles between them and lays on their feet, bringing them back to reality. “At least you had shoes on,” Cas smiles softly, “and pants.”
It’s intoxicating, and he realizes just how easy it would be to just... put their cocks together. “Fuck, Cas.”
Dean kissed his forehead and closed his eyes, trying not to focus too much on how good it felt to have Cas in his arms.
Cas rolled his eyes and threw together a bag with a smile. He put much more clothes than just a couple days, but Dean didn’t have to know that. He threw some sketch pads and pencils in his backpack and shrugged it on. “We can’t forget the pie. I want to eat it off that ass, later.”
Cas considered texting Dean again but left it alone. He just wanted to get home. Waking up in a stranger’s bed was always the worst, he never slept well and was always disappointed in himself for not having his shit together enough to make it home, or at least to Meg’s. Now he has to make his exit awkwardly as the dude tries to make him breakfast.
Dean chuckled as he started scrubbing the floor. “Depends. In case you haven’t noticed, I have a
Thank God I’ll be dead long before anyone reads this.
Cas slid in a third finger and started sucking a hickey on Dean’s thigh. “Want you so bad, Dean.” He scissored his fingers to stretch him open. “Fuck, I can’t-” Cas slid out and started lubing up his cock. “Relax and let me in, handsome.” He sucked and nipped his way up Dean’s torso and lined up. “Ready for me?”
It’s all as easy as breathing.
(See the end of the chapter for
John chuckled and took a long dramatic drink of his coffee. “No self-respecting high school football player is that big a fan of Eli Manning.”
Dean’s cock throbbed so hard when Jones’ nose cracked he thought it’d burst right through his jeans. His hands were covered in blood as he brought them to Cas’ face to meet the kiss, licking into his mouth and swallowing the sounds he was making. When he pulled back, he was breathless and crazed, his body feeling like he’d gotten electrocuted but the currant was still coursing through him. “Not such a little bitch
Dean goes out with Charlie to forget about Cas... what could go wrong?
By the time Cas comes out of the shower, Dean is putting the top half of the bagel on and sliding the plate over with a dramatic
The first time Cas looked for a dom he hated it. He had to practically beg for the man to take control and it left him feeling weak and dropping almost as hard as the last time. But he tried again, once he was able to accept the fact that

options? We can’t afford detox and I think this was a one time thing.”
to find a distraction.
Sam, despite himself, looked highly amused. "I'll make sure he gets the message." He took the paperwork and the men were led back to see the judge.
In a blink, they're completely naked and lying on the hood of the Impala, Cas on his back and Dean straddling him. "I... meant only you, honestly. I just didn't want to offend your abomination of a brother." He smiles to let Dean know he's kidding and then pulls him down into a kiss, rocking his hips up to glide his cock along the most perfect ass he's ever seen.
“I don’t? Let me paint a picture, abusive dad? Probably an alcoholic or some kind of addict. Relied on you way too much at a young age, making you grow up faster than any other kid. You probably did most of your brother's raising, right? Was your mother an addict too? Is this some self righteous mission to save someone when you couldn’t save your own parents?” Cas realized he went too far the second Dean’s hands tightened into fists at his side and he awaited the blow that never came.
Dean’s voice was quiet. “I don’t want you to die, angel. That’s what
thought Dean, wiping away the damp from his hands so he could text back.
“Want to ride you until I come all over your chest.” He managed to grunt out. “Let me move.”
noise. “Isn’t it beautiful? Look at it; eggs, bacon, cheese... on a friggin bagel! Take a bite, lemme watch.”
He’d be lying if he said Dean wasn’t obnoxiously attractive. Anyone with eyes could see that, it didn’t make Cas gay for noticing it… right?
He blushed after he hit send and pocketed his phone, convincing himself not to peek at it until school was out. It turned out to be harder than he thought, he kept thinking he felt it vibrate, but it wasn’t until the moment it actually vibrated that he realized the other vibrations were in his head.
Dean frowned, pulling Cas’ hands behind his back. He couldn’t help but wonder if that was the reason they never caught this tagger,
. It’s part of why I love my job, almost feels like, like we save people.” Sam shrugged but Dean knew exactly what he meant.
Cas smiles as he rubs the pad of his finger over Dean’s hole. “More times than I care to admit. You really do have that effect on people, you know. It’s hard to look at you and not want more.”
did in Dean’s throat. He pulled out one last, desperate measure to tip Cas over. Dean put his hands behind his own back and clenched his wrist, hoping Cas would understand he was finally, willingly giving him control.
Things had been mostly good. Cas still had his bad days but Dean was getting a lot better about not taking them personally. He realized after the first half a dozen of them that a bad day didn’t mean they were breaking up, it just meant that Cas needed a little extra space.
The tequila burns a little as it goes down, but Cas is thankful for it. “I just meant I didn’t know how to feel about being an ass’ ass, because it sounds like something I shouldn’t want to be. To your question… both? One more shot and then I’ll show you how it’s done.”
Dean pushed Baby to her limits as his chest threatened to split open and spill his insides all over the beige interior. The voices in his head had been quiet, but now they were louder than ever, trying to work out a plan to somehow kill every one of those cops while keeping Cas safe -- but it was no use. He recognized where they were, and all of his focus shifted to finding his way to the church where he'd taken Cas that first night. They were close, no more than twenty miles away, and the way there was twisty enough he was sure it would buy them time. "Then I'll do it. I promised you a long time ago that if it ever came to this, I'd be the one to put your light out." He waited until the last possible second and then hooked a right onto the exit ramp, and the cruiser that was closest to them didn't have time to make the shift and went sailing past.
She gives them both an apologetic look as she hands them each a copy of her notes.
lie, but for some reason, he’d wanted Dean to call him by his real name, even then. “How many ways did you spell it before you got it right?”
“They have amazing pie here. And I wasn’t leaving without some, regardless.” Cas led Dean to a booth and plopped down, flinched slightly and then grinned widely. “Missed that feeling.”
Cas nipped at the sensitive skin to get Dean to loosen his grip. “Fine. Come on my cock or not at all.” Cas shoved a second finger inside with a growl, biting Dean’s ass cheek again.
Dean worked a twelve hour shift Monday and didn’t find time to go by the shop but Tuesday he woke up to a text from Nick at 5:32AM,
“Stop.” Cas pushed at Dean’s hands, “Just a little bit for the pain Dean.”
Castiel holds his hand as if he might float away, but Dean’s hand is loose in his.
much and then I felt completely overwhelmed with guilt. He was an innocent. I would have enjoyed killing Eric more. At least he deserved to die.”
So it ends up being my turn and Sam looks at me with the fire of a thousand revenge suns in his eyes and asks me: Truth or Dare. Shit. Now about a week ago Sam forced us to take a Hogwarts House Quiz or whatever. He’s a Ravenclaw. Smart ass. I’ll let you guess the others because that isn’t the point and my hand is cramping.
Cas could feel Dean‘s eyes on him and hoped he could see just how good this was for him. When Dean leaned down to suck on his neck, he moaned his name loudly and scratched up his back.
with nothing but time on his hands. What do you think?”
Cas stared out the window pulling himself back to reality. He didn’t want Dean to see this. He couldn’t allow Dean to see this. He clenched his fists together so hard his nails dug into the skin and as soon as they pulled into the bar parking lot, Cas jumped out of the car. “Well, fun as always. Don’t gotta drag this out. Until next time, Dean.”
“Let me down?” That was the
Dean mocked him and scratched his eyebrow, “Okay so I go over. Then what?”
Dean blinked.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean gasped. It was painful, sure... but it felt like a natural extension of the purge he’d started earlier. With every centimeter of skin that tore under the tip of that blade, Dean came a little closer to a reality he’d felt disconnected from for years. “Spell your whole fucking name, I don’t care... just don’t fucking stop.” His hands fisted in the sheets and he gritted his teeth, his hips squirming.
“Thank fuck!” Cas moaned, pulling on Dean’s pants as well. They had fucked on Sunday, and yet they were both like starved animals. Cas had been worried, and was seconds from leaving Dean’s house when he pulled up. He didn’t want to cross any lines, and he definitely didn’t want to see Dean with someone else. Showing up unannounced was a gamble, and he didn’t regret it one bit. Dean wanted him too.
“Shit, if this is how you sound when you come, I’m going to suck your soul through your cock next time I see you. I never want you to stop coming,” Cas announced, barely audible from how hard he was struggling to catch his breath. “Ahh…
“Hi.” Cas’ face was already hurting from the stupid, nonstop grinning. “Yeah, I... miss you too.”
“I’m here, Cas. You can trust me.”
He noticed Charlie and her friends and nodded at his favorite redhead. “Ima go say hi to Charlie.” He made his way over before Cole responded.
next time and you can see just how much I’m
Cas just nodded, this was a punishment. He knew he would have to be punished occasionally, this time though, he really did just want to help their money situation. He knew Dean didn’t want to share for pleasure, but now he knew Dean wouldn’t share
He growled, leaning back in and biting Cas’ lip till it bled. “I’d make him eat his own hand.”
"The paint on your shoes and hands, the photo, let’s not forget the paint splatter
“Tell me about it. At least then it was a lower dose, now that he gets it… from, you know, not a pharmacy, he’s getting a higher dose. Wouldn’t be surprised if he’s taking it the same though.” Nick felt shitty talking about Cas this way, but it was nice to get it all out. Especially when it seemed like Dean actually cared about Cas too. “You can’t repeat any of this, if you care half as much as you’re acting you care, you won’t turn him in, I’m trusting you here, Dean.”
Charlie challenged. Cas was at therapy, giving the two best friends some time to talk about it all. Dean told her everything that happened in the house with Michael and how from the very beginning he knew the dude was obsessed with Cas.
He curled in on himself and shook his head again. “No. I don’t. I’m sure you do, though, so why are you talking to me?”
Cas nodded, still seeing stars. “I know you said you’re not going anywhere but maybe
“It’s uh...” Dean tosses around the blankets and finds it under his pillow. “Here. Had it under my pillow for the lube fairy, I think she refilled it.”
He laid back down, not wanting to watch this one leave.
wouldn’t be as good as the last.
I can and
“Why are you doing this?” David cried, and Cas grinned.
Cas huffed a laugh and put his arms behind his back. “Might need a little help staying still, handsome.”
“I’m glad you were ready for more. Getting fucked isn’t for everyone, but it is for me. If you couldn’t tell.”
He isn't unfamiliar with the name, but he's never seen the man it belongs to. His curiosity at finally meeting Dean is overshadowed pretty quickly when he puts all of those seemingly-random puzzle pieces together. “Wait… so… this… It's like a Secret Santa, but with sex?”
“Don’t worry. No one in this room enjoys sucking cock as much as I do. Hold my hands, Captain Rogers.”
get what I want.” Cas stated matter of factly and all Nick could do was roll his eyes.
Dean answered the phone within a second of Cas’ name appearing on the screen.
Dean growled at the sight of Cas spread open the way he was at the bar and once more changed his mind. He dropped to his knees, roughly grabbing Cas and flipping him over. He pressed his palm into the side of Cas’ face and thrust inside of him, feeling Cas’ hole swallow him in despite being prepped. The condom saves Dean from the worst of the discomfort but he could tell by Cas’ surprised little gasp that Dean bottoming out immediately had the desired effect. “I’m a helluva lot bigger than that plug, huh? Fuck, I can’t wait to tear you in half.” His hips snapped brutally against Cas’ already reddening ass as his hand kept Cas’ face pressed into the carpet.
Dean's brain shorted out a little bit. He wasn't sure which part to focus on; the fact that Cas
stepped forward again and Cas slid his hand to the man’s hip.
Dean nearly came unglued just from the sound alone, but when he peeked around Cas’ body and saw the mess he’d made, Dean lost his mind. He hated the hoodie between them, reaching up under it with both hands until it was rucked halfway up Cas’ gorgeous frame and Dean was gripping his shoulders, his chest, anything he could fucking hang onto as he buried his face in the fabric and drove himself deeper, deeper,
Dean’s inner turmoil was cut short when Cas slid his entire length down his throat without a flinch.
Dean couldn’t fight the cocky smile if he tried, and with yet another ego boost, Dean starts showing off. He meets every bounce with a powerful thrust and strokes Cas even faster. “Let me have it, baby. Want you to ride me with your come all on my face. Come for me.”
” Cas palmed himself. “Didn’t think you’d be coming back anyway.”
what was so hot about it.” Cas was actually excited to hear Dean’s perspective on his first kill, he hadn’t said much about that night yet.
attractive. His plump bottom lip was trapped between his teeth and his eyes were closed, but he looked so… blissed the fuck out. Like the guy was having the time of his life spearing himself on Benny’s cock and jackin’ two others off at the same time. Dean was half hard in his jeans just from the sight.
not the Angel are you?” he asked with a tilt of his head.
“You too
He shouldn’t, because Dean loves it
“Hell yeah, I want it, Cas. I wanted it this whole time... didn’t know how to ask.” Dean nibbles along his collarbone as he slides down Cas’ panties. “Wanna give you mine, too.”
Their happily, smutty ever after 🥰
He chewed his lip. “That would have been so hot had it been literally
Cas had tears leaking from his eyes as Dean pounded into him and his arms ached below him. He didn’t want to say it, but his survival instincts began to kick in, he squirmed up to try and loosen the rope around his neck long enough to catch his breath but Dean gripped his hips, pulling him back down and slamming in again. “...keep...sie.” He grunted, hoping Dean understood as his world began fading to black.
Nick tossed it at his head instead. “Needs more color Cassie but whatever, not like you’ll listen to me.” Nick rolled his eyes.
“Exactly.”
Sam shook his head with a smile. “Can’t wait to meet them.”
Dean rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair as he chewed. “Seems she’s changed her mind about that, she practically gift-wrapped my cock for you.”
Castiel look like. It took everything not to ask. He wanted to, but he also wasn’t sure if he was ready for that step. Things were… great. He didn’t need a photo to know he liked Cas’ company. Okay, company was a stretch, but he liked talking to the guy, probably more than anyone else right now. He was new and exciting and…
Cas smiled and then chastised himself.
Cas huffed a laugh, “Yeah, okay. And why is that? Why would you ever give a fuck about me? I’m not from your world Dean, we may as well speak different languages.”
A devil... and a fallen angel.
Cas’ heart jumped in his damn throat, all for Dean to just turn away. It took everything not to grab Dean and pull him in.
Cas stopped at his bedroom door. “I need you to be awake and somewhere
It took his brain a moment to realize what the hell he wanted and when it registered to him, his whole body twitched. Dean swore under his breath and slid the toy back inside of Cas, and fought just about every urge in his body to kiss the life right outta that guy. “Holy shit.”
“I’m Kevin, this is Cas. Thanks for the effort,” the smaller Asian kid said, and Dean couldn’t tell if it was meant to be sarcastic or not.
“Oh yeah, and you’re so trustworthy huh?” Dean challenged.
“Did you? You gonna come inside me again? Gonna fill me up with your- fuck!” Cas grunted and came, painting Dean white just like he wanted.
"Yeah, well I warned you when I first met you, they're assholes." Dean forced his eyes away from Castiel’s. "Beautiful color choices. Where was the inspiration from?"
“Nothin’ against bottoms, I just like doin’ the fucking.”
“Right now? I’m looking at this horrible wall thinking it needs some color.” Cas ignored his question purposely and Nick crossed his arms, waiting for a response. “Into him? Is this high school Nick?”
When the doctors come to say it’s time, they’re both completely consumed with the weight of unsaid words. They each hold a hand as Dean fades away, and when the tide comes in, they both refuse to leave.
Every day he wondered, if today would be the day he was caught, the thrill was exhilarating.
Cole ended up sobering enough before John got home. Dean forced him in the shower after a long nap and got him looking human and on the couch before John walked in with pizzas. “Hey Cole. You didn’t come over last night.”
his affiliation with Castiel - and he wasn’t entirely convinced he wouldn’t yet kill the man. Although, if he didn’t... he certainly knew who his next victim would be.
A few days later, everyone was already getting antsy. There was too much testosterone in the damn house, especially when they went a while without an orgy. Cas noticed a lot of them breaking off and doing smaller sessions or one on one fucking, but Michael wouldn’t. It was almost as if he was
“No! Geez, you too. This isn’t a trap. I hate giving blowjobs, you love giving them... more than anyone on earth. Dean loves
But if that was the case, why were they letting go at all?

The moan Cas lets out can probably be heard throughout the house, but he doesn't care. Dean’s tongue is better than any fantasy. “Dean… so good. That's it… little deeper.” He fists a hand in Dean’s hair and gasps as the head of his cock dips into his tight throat. “Shit.”
Whatever. So he finds something about sleepovers and then Grabby Dicks over here, I mean Gabe, finds out we’ve never had one. Awesome. I cannot roll my eyes hard enough. So Cas starts going through the typical list and suggests we play truth or dare. This is my excited face. Spoiler alert: I’m
“Yeah?” Dean rolls onto his back and smiles up at Cas when he opens the door. His hair is adorably tousled and he licks his lips as his eyes devour Cas’ bare torso.
Cas growled and pushed Dean off of him with a strength that surprised them both and flipped their bodies so Cas was straddling Dean’s lap. “Gonna come all over your fucking chest, don’t move.” Cas leaned forward and set a hand on Dean’s neck while the other stroked himself hard and fast.
“Thanks.” Dean took a chance and set his hand on top of Cas’.
He didn’t say a word as he closed and locked the door behind him, biting his lip to keep himself from saying
“That’s okay, I’ll just wear the black ones I wore here. That doesn’t matter, come back over here.” He walked over to his clothes and slid up his black satin panties and went back by the cross.
“I’ll jack off while I suck you.” Cas tilted his head and locked eyes with Dean. “You sure?”
Cas felt as though he would burst with every movement. How riled up Dean was had Cas nearly coming. When Dean slid his fingers in, he groaned happily. “Fuck. I didn’t know. I didn’t know I’d get so fucking hard from seeing you with that bloody knife.”
Dean stared at his phone, he didn’t expect Nick to ever open up on his own like that and he sure as shit doesn’t know what to say. He pictured Cas snorting pills and his stomach dropped into his balls.
The cop leaned down to look in the car, shining his flashlight in each of their faces and then the backseat despite the fact that it was still daylight.
“He’s almost here. Who’s open to a threesome? I am.” Charlie sets her phone down and looks around. Benny waves his hand, as do Bela, Cole and Abby. “Well, easy peasy. We won’t all have one but at least some of us will.” She walks over to Cas and puts an arm around him. “No pressure, okay? Next year you’ll be all for it. I’d bet money on it.”
Dean’s teeth nipped at his neck and he held there, his breath hot against Cas’ skin. “The fact that David knew he was gonna die, and he
“He saved me. I was being beaten and raped daily by my... pimp.” Cas looked away as if he was about to cry.
Dean made his way to the bathroom to wash up and use the toothbrush he left at Charlie’s house. He took a quick peek into her room and saw she wasn’t alone,
“Ahh, hell, baby.” Dean lines up, unable to fight it for even a second more and then he slides inside with a groan. He can hear Jask and Ares laugh at him, but he can’t find it in him to care; Cas feels too damn good.
Dean barely had the self-awareness to kiss him back, but he willingly let himself get swept up in the kiss until he started to shake from the blood-letting. He was shivering cold, and gripped tight to Cas.
Cas reached forward and stroked him, just to fuck with him more. “Hard for me David? You want me to fuck you?” Cas tilted his head.
It didn’t take good people skills to see how much Dean tensed before he spoke. “Oh man. Uh…” Dean scratched the back of his head and blushed.
“Cas.” Nick approached him, holding a hand to Sam to give him a moment. He was the only one that could reason with Cas once he was angry.
“I plan on it.” Cas hums and puts his hands behind his back, then decides to show Dean exactly what he’s capable of. What he did with the dildo was only the beginning. He lets out a steady breath, relaxing his throat and jaw as he teases the tip of Dean’s cock.
his dick finally chose to wake up. “Tell me how it felt the next day when you couldn’t move without remembering what I did to you.”
He jumped in the shower, fixed his short hair about seven times before he finally grabbed his backpack, texted Cas and headed out the door. He opted to walk, since it was a nice spring day and it was only one street, but as soon as he saw the apartment building he got butterflies. No, not butterflies, those aren’t big enough.
Dean’s breathing quickened minutely as he considered his options, drawing out the silence and what little bit of space there was between them. He’d been charismatic before, charming even. He knew how to say whatever he needed to in order to get what he wanted, it was how he’d gotten so far without making mistakes. So he’d misjudged this one, it didn’t mean he couldn’t see it though to the end. He allowed his eyes to soften as he stared at Castiel’s mouth, the picture perfect image of someone that’s looking at someone
off when he stretched it out.
He hears Dean whisper, “Cas…” but when he looks up, he doesn’t see Dean. He hears the crash of that gorgeous body collapsing onto his hardwood floor, and by the time he rushes to check on him he is unconscious.
So Cas decided to look through some of our family photos while Gabe and Sam argued about whether gummy sharks was a healthy breakfast. After he got done he looked at me and said, “These are really nice Dean but, where’s Adam?”
Cas beamed. “Yeah?” He leaned in closer. “Let’s get in this room and then you repeat back

Michael growled and shifted so he was on his back, and Cas went to work sucking him off quick and dirty. He wasn’t turned on himself anymore, but Cas could fake it with the best of them when needed, and even when he wasn’t in the mood he still loved making men as big as Michael squirm like that.
should have at least let Benny clarify that comment he’d made about horny men, because when he parked his car and opened the front door with the spare key, his suitcase
phone and wasn’t paying attention to where they were going, which was good because the police station was clear on the other side of town. Dean pulled up to the warehouse and slammed on his brakes, causing Eric to fly forward and smack against the back of the bench seat. Dean threw the car in park and used Eric’s fumbling, curse riddled disorientation as an opportunity to hit him over the head with the butt of the nightstick he’d placed on the passenger seat. Unfortunately, it didn’t knock him out, so Dean scrambled to turn around fully and hit him again with a sickening
Although Cas didn’t fully grasp how Michael was starting to feel about him, he was able to comprehend the fact that Michael would ditch anyone, anywhere, to fuck Cas.
a fuck. So, why did it feel so different? Whether Cas shed a tear or not was his own business. But his drive back to his shitty studio on the second floor was a silent one. He didn’t even look in the mirror when he got home, just collapsed on his bed and slept for well over a day.
To his surprise, Dean looked at him with something that appeared to be compassion, not pity or even disinterest, like he’d expected. “I’m not really claustrophobic, I just can’t stand being still this long. I need to move, y’know? Drive. Go places.” Dean licked his lip and continued, his voice quiet. “You okay?”
Dean was dumbfounded at how quickly he got on board with the idea of fucking a dude, but now that he was, he was a little pissed at himself for waiting so long. If Cas’ mouth was any indication of what other guys could do, he’d been robbing himself of awesome orgasms for years.
to try every single flavor, right?”
Words utterly failed Dean, but his body responded to Cas on autopilot. His fingers bruised the soft skin of Cas’ hips as he imagined exactly the scene Cas laid out for him. Heat coiled in his gut and he sped up, using the momentum of their bodies and his iron grip to keep them upright. Dean was a moaning,
Cas groaned and cussed at his inability to keep his mouth closed. “Okay, Dean.” Cas accepted his fate, but he
“Yes, yes, I won’t hold back.”
He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t eat. He had no energy to shower or clean up after himself. It was a miracle he made it to the bathroom most of the time. He’d never been closer to ending it all in his life, but something deep in his gut warned him that his life wasn’t his own to take. So, he suffered through it, trying to dull the thoughts in his head with whiskey, pills… whatever he could get his hands on while he waited for it to pass.
Dean flushes adorably as he makes his way to his phone to turn off the music. “Uh... This is exactly what it looks like.”
“How about you show me what you meant by
“Okay, show me. Then I’ll go get you some water.”
Gabriel is flying through the bunker, Sam has the shower curtain tied around his ginormous neck and Cas… where the shit did you even
“Nope. I’m a man of many talents.” Dean heard Cas collapse on his bed. “So two tomorrow, huh? Had a rough week?”
“It feels great at the time. It’s freeing to just… release all control. But then, you have to find yourself again and it’s not always easy. I like giving you control. But I
After they were at Benny’s for about thirty minutes, Dean was already wishing he was at home. A movie night actually sounded much more appealing than this shit, but at least he could play video games here and pretend to be into something. A few more people came than he anticipated, but it still wasn’t
“I was legitimately thinking about it.” Cas smiled widely and moved forward again, nudging Dean gently to get some more room. “Would it have worked?”
But I wasn’t going to ask. I was going to just do it one day.” He leaned in. “Fuck me, right
“Because he is sharing a tent with Dean, genius. Come on, let’s go find our partners.” Cas wasn’t sure he wanted to get lost in the damn woods with two jocks.
“How about sunset?” Dean offered and Cas shrugged.
Dean’s eyes closed and his jaw clenched. “Yeah, that. That one.
“Well we need somewhere to stash some stuff right? No one had even walked in that place for months before you.” Cas suggested, hoping he was getting all this right. He felt oddly calm.
“Then we go down together,” Cas said as if it was the most obvious thing ever.
Dean crushed his mouth to his and kept him caged against that wall, his own cock trailed precum against  Cas’ stomach.
He opened and closed his door quietly and stepped around a couple of corners, following the smell of paint and marijuana. Finally spotting them, he snapped a picture with his cell phone and stepped out, hand on his gun. He didn't think they'd be violent but luck favors the prepared. "Police, hands up, guys."
Cas released all control to Dean. Dean’s tongue set the pace and his hands roamed freely until Dean picked him up, his legs straddling his Devil instantly. Castiel always loved how strong Dean was and his cock already began to harden.
Cas slipped outside for a break a couple hours later. He sat staring at the building wall, thinking of what he could tag it with and took the opportunity to take the Oxy.
“Hell yeah… you love being full of my come, sunshine?” Dean licks his hand and wraps it around Cas’ length, squeezing the base before he starts to match Cas’ movements. “Knew you’d be good, but damn… I’m fuckin’ hooked, Cas.”
“This completely fucked out photo of me.” He pulled it off where it was pinned to and walked back over. “You told me you lost it, but here it is, in your murder cave.” Cas grinned and climbed onto Dean’s lap. “It’s in great condition too, it’s almost as if you had a crush on me.” He teased. Dean
The next morning, Dean woke up stiff from the couch. “Ah fuck.” He grunted to himself, stretching out his neck. Glancing over at Cas, he had to smile, “Aww, look at the little angel.”
that, which only egged Cas on.
Nick handed Dean his phone, “Put your number in, I’ll keep an eye out.” Nick paused, “If at any point you involve
“Just wondering. I know Charlie has been working hard on decorations and shit for the dance, but I wasn’t sure if she would make the game.”
Dean laughed. “Seriously? The thought of me puking made your dick hard?”
Dean was excited as hell for homecoming. The football season started - which was definitely the best part of high school - and homecoming was just another excuse to eat, sleep, and breathe football. Then there was the dance and the after party, and those were always a great time. He’d played football since freshman year, so he’d always been invited to all the cool shit.
"Alright, suit yourselves." The officer wandered out and a half hour later they were ushered into a plain room with only a table and three chairs. Both brothers sat on one side and within moments a tall man with long but neat brown hair came in holding their case files and a briefcase.
The truth is, he couldn’t leave it and he owed it to
The praise has him reaching to grip his throbbing, leaking cock and he strokes a couple times, not wanting to come just yet but he can already feel himself getting closer.
Cas laughed. “Nah, Ima make him wait. We can get coffee in a few hours, don’t want him seeing you there and then again at the bar. You’re too handsome to miss.”
Castiel was completely out of serotonin, the last drop of any positive endorphin was spread across his belly, mixed with Dean’s come. And tears threatened to escape. “Fuck…” He whimpered.
Cas took a step in as well. “Absolutely.”
He kept driving, not being able to tell Cas the truth - how pushing Dean away was really doing
He cleared his throat, squeezing her ass. “Yeah? I think I can help you out, then.”
too much Jack Daniels, and had at least twelve existential crises. It was kind of a wonder that he didn’t break his wrist with the amount of force used when lunging at his phone to check if it was Cas and see the response.
Cas’s eyes shot up and widened. “You did?! Well, what did he say?”
“One more game and then we’ll get outta here? Want you to come home with me.”
Cas opened the door and sighed, “What do
He shrugged a little, biting into his breakfast sandwich. “You’re fucking grumpy when you first wake up. Didn’t wanna deal with it.”
A single eyebrow shot up on Cas’ face.  “There goes that friendship.” He sighed and leaned back in to finish the job. “We weren’t close, so it isn’t a big deal.” He licked again. “I just feel like a bad person. But how can something so right be wrong?” He finished up the last of the come and kissed Dean’s belly button. Still on his knees, staring up.
Cas huffed a laugh but he didn’t smile, “Did you google this?”
It was the weirdest fucking feeling he’d ever experienced. The fact that Carmen was watching turned him on, the fact that he was getting blown by a person he’d never laid eyes on before was turning him on... and that tongue,
Gonna say this twice, just in case... two chapters tonight, guys! This one and the next. Make sure you catch them both!
The cop got a dangerously lusty look in his eyes. “Well, I guess I’ll just have to take a little look-see then, hmm? Step out of the vehicle.”
The joke snaps Cas out of it and he flips them in an instant, wrapping a hand around Dean’s throat to keep him down as he uses the other to line him up and sink down again. “And if you think James Buchanan Barnes doesn’t make Cap pay for it, you’re just oblivious.”
“I really want to suck you off again.” Cas admitted but he didn’t make a move, and Dean was thankful.
“My cock, Dean,” he rasps, scooting forward a little. “Cover me, I need to feel it. I don’t think I can come without it.”
Dean nods at Cas, knowing he isn’t even watching him at that moment, but he doesn’t know what else to do. Whatever the question is, the answer is yes. “Fuck... you know what you’re doin’, baby.”
Dean stayed propped up on his arms for a moment, but as he melted into that kiss, he laid back fully and ran his hands through Cas’ hair.
“Dean.” Cas mumbled under his breath.
Dean couldn’t speak until Cas was seated. He knew Cas asked him a question, knew his answer and wanted to give it... but the feeling of Cas’ tight ass wrapping around his cock was intense. He leaned his head back on the seat and closed his eyes, finally whispering, “Mine.”
do anything, even this. He owed Cas that much. He took a few deep breaths and then steadied himself.
He spotted one more easy mark on the way back and almost didn’t push his luck, but went for it. Unfortunately this jacket had no wallet, but it had a sucker, so he stole that and rushed back before Dean flipped. Cas tossed the wallets in different garbage cans, kept what was useful and took the long route back to Dean, in case he was spotted or followed.
If you’d like to skip that part, scroll until you see the paragraph that starts “The man’s scream echoed...” and you should be good. :)
A month later, it was Castiel who felt the

That morning, Dean wakes up hard again. This time, Cas fucked
“Was it accurate?” Cas teased with a gummy smile, staring into Dean’s eyes.
move on and after a few months, Sam’s stories are repeats, but Castiel doesn’t care. He still listens, still hangs on to every word because
Cas didn’t ask questions until they were on the road again. “What happened Dean? Are we fucked?” Dean’s calls had scared the shit out of Cas and he needed to know how much time they had.
“I’m watching a penguin documentary. Did you know-”
He was both surprised and pleased that Dean played along, any other jock would’ve stuck his head in a toilet for something like that. Cas held the container closer, letting Dean grab one and decided to see how far his seemingly good nature went. “Why do I feel like your teachers will be angry with me for giving you sugar so early in the morning?”
“You look like shit, Cas.” Nick said in a deadpan tone.
The man straightened up, fear in his eyes. He wasn’t about to cross Dean, he could feel he wasn’t someone you fucked with. “Yeah... okay. Got it.” He walked away just as Cas walked out of the bathroom.
He wouldn’t offer again.
“All for you, baby.” Cas pulled him down and licked his earlobe, his chest heaving beneath Dean’s. “Only you.”
Everything would be back to normal tomorrow. That means he just spent multiple days hiding and sulking in his room instead of spending these very last days with Dean.
“Why not right this second?” Cas asked with a grin before leaning forward and biting Dean’s neck. “There.”
“He absolutely is.”
Dean tossed his bag on the seat between them and started his car. He attempted to clear the red from his vision long enough to breathe and ask an important question. “Did you ask for this?”
tell you how good it is?” Cas bites back another laugh as Dean blushes.
“De-” was all he was able to get out before he was emptying down Dean’s throat. He may be new to sucking dick, but he was still the best Cas had ever had.
Unfortunately, that was all Cas got because Charlie had managed to get him out the backdoor and to the street before he got to find out where Dean was.
you out.” Nick tried to sound as though he meant it but Cas knew otherwise. He’d never leave Cas in jail.
Cas fought the urge to tell him to shut up, he didn’t want to hear his damn voice. He just needed to come so he could get the hell out of there. Cas closed his eyes, fucking him hard until he came, picturing Dean’s beautiful face.
boring assbutt. He started to daydream about how that first splatter of blood would look when it dripped down his chest... yeah, his chest. Castiel would start there. He’d carve one straight experimental line across his chest to watch his entire torso run red and fuck... boner... Cas had to think of something else.
After a week of moping around Cas started fucking again. At first, it was just for money. But then he ran into a hot, green eyed man and
Dean just chuckles and turns back to Cas. “Nervous?”
Cas buried his face into Dean’s neck, staying balls deep inside of him. “I’m staying inside here, forever.”
Dean gently bites Cas’ nipple with a satisfied hum, and Cas isn’t sure if he imagines the “good boy” that follows or if it really happened — but the insistent twitch of his cock is real enough as Dean slowly eases into him. “Fuck, you’re tight,” Dean moans, and all Cas gets out is a whimpered little noise that he’d be embarrassed about if this didn’t feel so good.
Cas chuckles, squeezing Dean's arm as he steps past him. “Oh, sweetheart... you'd never cheat on me.”
Cas huffed a laugh. “You picturing that blood, baby? Picture it running down my body, pouring down my ass and around your cock as you pound into me. Ah, fuck!” Cas moaned. “Fuck, so good. Dig your nails into my hip, like you fucking mean it.” He pushed back again.
Cas leaned forward to speak into his ear, “What’s your name?”
kind of virus, Dean, but sure. You’ll be the first to know.”
What would they even say?
Castiel frowned and grabbed Dean’s arm, pushing him slightly against a car he didn’t look twice at. “You telling me I'm not good enough for your precious, pristine car?” He didn’t know why it offended him, he normally wouldn’t give two shits, but if he was going to
Dean’s cock twitched and he had no intentions of stopping long enough to go get the real lube. He looked around quickly and leaned over Cas’ back, opening the cupboard and fumbling around until he found the olive oil. Five minutes later, he was pushing his oil-slicked cock into Cas’ eager body and bottoming out, letting out a moan.
Cordelia reviews her notes, shuffling through them until she finds the page she’s searching for, and then looks back up at Cas and Dean while closing the folder and placing it to the side. “Friends? That’s lovely. A lot of the best relationships come out of friendships because we’re already so aware of our partner’s experiences, and obviously we already have a foundation of care and respect to build on.” She smiles at Dean before speaking again. “So, Dean, how do you get along with Castiel’s parents?” she asks, an eyebrow slightly raised.
No matter what I did to you, you never lost the fire in your eyes. They all did. They died screaming, begging for their lives and for mercy.” His finger trailed down to Cas’ lip and his eyes fixed on the way the digit pulled down the lush, pink skin there. “But they were no angels, and the devil doesn’t deal in mercy.”
“Damn, Cas. Almost like you’re tryin’ to get me to like you or somethin’.” Dean trailed a line of kisses down Cas’ body and sucked on the inside of his thigh, then pulled back with a grin. “Extra bacon?”
“There’s rope in my bag, Cas, if that’s what you’re lookin’ for. Let’s see how much prettier he looks hogtied.”
Dean tossed the paper down on the table in front of Cas without bothering to read the phone numbers. “Look at that fuckin’ sketch. You’re tellin’ me this neighbor bitch nails me to a goddamn T but can’t get your eyes right?” He shook his head. “Least they could do was capture your best feature.”
Aside from a few couples making out, it was rather quiet down that hallway, so Cas went deeper. He was happy he did, because he stumbled across a home theater and instantly knew where he would be hiding the rest of the night.
Because he’s gone.
Time froze and Cas stared down at the paper as though it might burst into flames. “How...” But just as he asked, he knew.
Cas had gone around the corner and texted David, he only sat for about twenty minutes before he was pulling up to get him.
Cas laughed, harder than Dean appreciated. “You really are adorable! There is no line, Dean. Just be you. You can like how it feels to fuck a girl and fuck a guy. No one is allowed to label you but you.”
“Good morning, Castiel. How are you today?” Dr. Milton asked, although she insisted Cas call her
Dean should be honest, he should say,
Cas rolled his eyes. “I don’t drink or smoke when I'm painting… well, anymore and I don't shoot shit alright.” Cas went to walk back to the ladder, clearly annoyed.
Dean followed his target out of the strip club they’d been at just off the highway with his hands in his pockets and his hood over his head. He stayed a few paces behind the man until they were safely in the darker part of the parking lot, and then he pounced, knocking him out. Cas had been on standby and already had the Impala’s trunk open. He quickly helped Dean get the man into the trunk and slammed it as Dean double checked their surroundings and got back in the car, driving away from the strip club as a savage grin spread across his face.
“One is holding the phone and the other is… on my stomach.”
could be meaner than they were, but it still wasn’t something they should mess around with.
Dean got up to grab a blanket and tossed it on Cas. The smile that crept on his face only annoyed him further. “Why wouldn’t you try, Cas? What’s so hard about being
He walked up behind Cas and ghosted his fingers down those bare sides, leaning in to kiss the bruise. “You’re spoilin’ me.”
It makes Dean smile more. He never expected to adopt a dog, it went against his main rule — no dogs in Baby — but when Miracle found him… it was just meant to be. “Hey, he was my New Year’s kiss last year. You ditching me for him this year?” He shakes his whole butt at the attention he’s getting and it helps change the subject back to safe territory. Dean really didn’t know what to say next anyway.
“Okay. Nick?” Cas stood up and started gathering his things, avoiding eye contact. “Have you heard from him?”
——————
Dean let her down easy, telling her he didn’t want anything serious right now because it was senior year, and she seemed to understand. He felt guilty; he didn’t mean to use her but she was more than willing, and even after he told her the news, she whispered in his ear that he knew where to find her when he wanted to get laid. Last year, the offer of no strings attached sex would have been a godsend, but this year, not so much. He found himself less interested in girls’ skirts and more interested in… well, Cas.
“I think you’re thinking about it wrong. It doesn’t have to be a happy memory from start to finish, it just has to be a moment - a single moment - where you felt real joy. At least, that’s the way I see it.” Cas studied Dean out of the corner of his eye, his chest aching a little at the thought of Dean not having any happy memories. “Maybe if I ever wake up as a wizard and manage to pull off the spell, I’ll send my Patronus your way.”
“No, I did. I just forgot. That was probably a horrible first impression huh?” Sam ran a hand through his long auburn hair.
Cas scoffed and ran a hand through his unruly bedhead. “Thanks. You always did have a way with words, Gabriel.”
Cas slid his tongue in Dean’s mouth as though he knew what Dean was after. The kiss was slow but goddamn was it sure. There was no hesitation between them anymore, nothing to hold them back.
“Uh… I… I was telling this woman about a cow I saw, I should have paid more attention.”
“God, you’re beautiful.” It was Dean’s turn to stay still, his eyes fixed on every inch of his angel’s body.
When Sam begins to cry, Cas doesn’t hesitate to walk over and hug him. They don’t know each other, they’ve never even shook hands or had a conversation, but they hold each other and allow the other to share their pain.
“Hell it isn’t.” Some of his anger wavered, that was something his mom used to say when he threw a fit. He was a bratty kid… not that he grew out of it.
There was one more brief moment where he thought he’d panic and go running out of there, but one more reminder of that mouth had Dean slowly working the plug out and fumbling the lube from his pocket.
It oddly made sense, which was surprising - drunk logic rarely made sense. “Can you? How?”
to him?
Dean gulped and opened it. This time, it was Balt… with glasses… and a coffee mug. The mug had a bumble bee on it and it said, “Always bee yourself” which was honestly
Dean opened the door and Cole was grinning like an asshole, but something about it made Cas proud instead of embarrassed.
“Oh sure, because you can do anything, right?” He shoved him the map and motioned his hand. “Go ahead, hero. Save us.”
Dean’s pretty damn excited about Charlie’s Halloween party. It’s not that he has trouble getting laid, he never has, but there’s something about her parties that always excites him. It’s probably because he knows for a fact that he will be fucking one of their friends tonight, and there’s something about the taboo behind it that gets him hard — like incredibly hard. They’ll get drunk, fuck like animals all night, and then the next day they pretend it didn’t happen. What’s not to love?
Dean heard the phone move and huffed a laugh, “Did you just air quote?”
Danny scoffed, “give who?”
Dean’s answering laugh was dark and full of promise. He stretched his fingers further around the sides of Cas’ throat and squeezed a little harder. “Or, you could start with your name. If you want me to bend you over and split your used up little ass in half, I will... but you’re going to work for it. Entertain me first.” He released his neck and sat down, wiggling two fingers at the bartender without taking his predatory gaze off of Castiel.
Cas, wanted to see exactly how much someone that clearly broken could take before shattering completely. He wanted to force him to keep those blue eyes open as the breath slowly left his body and his blood washed the voices away, but... maybe this wasn’t the right time. Maybe it wasn’t the right place. Everything he did was so meticulously planned and Castiel was forcing him to reconfigure the rules at every turn. No, this wasn’t worth it. No one was. And yet...
Dean looked around and grabbed a bottle of water for Cas, handing it to him. “One day, I
Coming out to John went better than Dean could have ever imagined and if they both had to wipe a tear away before anyone noticed, that was their own business. Dean was just proud he held it together… mostly.
“And why is that?”
When the day finally arrived, Dean woke up to a text from Cas.
She struggled with words for a few seconds before sighing. “Yesterday. You said like three words after you snapped on Dean for trying to help. I just want to know you’re okay.”
On some level, Dean knew that was supposed to be comforting, but now he just felt like an asshole for even asking. "Yeah, no... you're right. Course. Stupid question." He took another sip, much smaller that time, and spun the bottle upright on the table.
“Yeah... for a long time.”
Dean jumped in Baby, letting Meg know, “this isn’t over” before peeling off.
The look Dean returned was confusing.
“Good boy.” Dean leaned down to kiss him as he lined up with Cas’ hole and slid inside, painfully slow. “Breathe, Castiel. Breathe like my good boy. You have to let me in.” Cas exhaled and Dean pushed inside until he bottomed out. He kissed along Cas’ neck affectionately and moved in tiny circles. Once he felt like Cas had relaxed enough, he slid out and slammed back in, making Cas cry out in pleasure. He repeated that a few times before finding his pace.
I just think we’d both feel better if we were allowed to do it, y’know?” Dean eyed him almost hopefully as he bent down to take off his boots.
Cas leans down to suck the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth as he pulls his fingers out, then steadies himself to pull his cock out of his panties. The sight is intoxicating as Cas slicks his length, and when he finally pushes in and drops down to kiss Dean, he feels the burn again, but it doesn’t scare him away. Instead, he wants
"Okay," Sam leaned back, "and the paint under your fingernails?" He ran a finger down his case file.
Nipples.
“In what world would those be equal?” Cas asked with a laugh. He and Dean were on their third drink and both of them were grinning with flushed cheeks. Dean had the nerve to say his WiFi ‘borrowing’ was the same as borrowing sugar.
“Shit,” Dean gripped his hair again and rolled his hips, tilting his upper body to watch Cas’ hand. “Fuck yeah I do. Think about that mouth all the damn time, every fuckin’ day. Your ass, too. So fuckin’ tight, sweetheart, and that tongue...” Dean moaned low, dragging the sound out and closing his eyes.
“Alright, see you at sunset, Cas.” Dean tossed the bag in the backseat and climbed in Baby. “Let’s go Nick, I have some patrolling to do around your neighborhood anyway.” Dean stole one last glance at Cas before putting the car in reverse.
Cas didn’t respond with words, but Dean’s grip on his cock had him coming
“Whatever,
But the truth was, Castiel had no idea what he was. He’d kissed a few girls and he… enjoyed it. He’d expected to like it
Cas swats his hand away and takes over, bracing himself with one strong arm as he tilts his head to watch. “Come for me, Dean. I want to taste you as I come inside of you.”
Cas didn't let up, sucking and stroking while Dean kept a tight grip on his hair until Dean was coming unglued with the need to let go. He was finally at a point that he didn't give a shit what he saw, he just needed to see. "Cas!" Dean yelled, so fucking close to the finish line it was stupid.  "Gotta see you." He ripped the blindfold off and blinked his eyes open slowly to adjust to the change in light, and when he made eye contact with those electric, crazy blue eyes attached to the best looking dude he'd ever seen - he came without warning or asking permission.
Cas smiled, “Turn around.” As soon as he presented his ass in the air, Cas positioned behind him, shoving his jeans down a little further but keeping them on. Cas lined up with the man’s hole and slowly slid inside with a groan. Even after the plug, his hole squeezed around Cas’ length. “Still tight.” Cas waited a second, trying to give the man time to adjust but he was a needy bottom.
The shiver Dean feels up his spine catches him by surprise, but the twitch in his pants doesn’t. Just the thought of Cas touching himself has him hardening in his
, bobbing and slurping like Dean’s come was his last meal.
some would say. Or,
Cas knew he fucked up. “No! No. I don’t want to. I just... want to help.” And he meant it. “Just forget I said anything.”
the grouch?” He rolled his eyes and walked away.
“You fucking better! How’s my neck?” He huffed a laugh and bared his neck, letting Dean see the possessive love bite.
Dean whispers an “oh fuck” just as he’s pulled away by Lisa for a hug, and he’s distracted by food a second later, his eyes flicking to Cas every few seconds. For his part, Cas attempts to remain patient, but he's already
“I agree. It’s... hard for me to get off to porn... or with my own imagination. Thank you, Dean.” Cas sounds breathless, but
Dean heard Cas shift, probably to sit up. “How close are you to the park?”
Dean stood outside Cas’ door with a bag and a nervous expression. He muttered to himself that he’d seen Cas at his worst and they’d made it through, this couldn’t be
gorgeous,” he retorts, as if that’s a come back.
Cas’ cock was throbbing as it painfully bumped into the shower wall. “Fuck!” He growled, pushing back as much as he could but Dean’s grip had him locked in place. “Bite me! Make me fucking bleed, Dean.” He couldn’t explain it, he needed the crimson liquid to come just as much as Dean did.
Choosing between round two and bacon was one of the hardest decisions Dean ever made. In the end, he figured the best way to go about it was to wait until Cas put that bacon on a plate and then make his move, so that’s exactly what he did.
ideas today.” Dean said aloud to himself. “Of course the criminal wants more, when’s the fucking wedding?!” His tone is bitter and he walked over to his phone with a frown.
Dean could feel Cas’ come leaking from his abused hole and couldn’t decide if he fucking
and just how far his drug habits have gone.
“Geez! I’m walking home. Get a room guys.” Nick turned to gather his stuff.
“Don’t hold back, Dean… take what you need from me. I want all of you.”
For the second time in his life, Dean wanted to say sorry, knew he
Dean takes some time to cry before opening the smaller letter. He doesn’t know how long. The sun has completely risen, but he doesn’t feel like he’s in a rush. The realization that the smaller letter is the last time Cas will communicate with him hurts — almost too much for him to carry on — but he wipes his eyes and unfolds the letter with trembling fingers. He can’t help but chuckle again and think about how even in death Cas is bossing him around, but he has no complaints. He would give anything to hear Cas’ voice again, even if he was just yelling about the plants. When he is able to focus on the words in front of him, he can’t help but laugh out loud.
The second his teeth latched on Dean was coming. He glanced around to watch as his throbbing cock leaked spurt after spurt of white come. Dean’s noises had Cas biting harder, gripping him harder,
He doesn’t finger Cas too long, and it’s obvious that’s because he needs Cas just as much as he needs him. He pulls his fingers out and starts to lube up his cock. “I can’t wait to fill you up. I’ve marked the outside, now it’s time to mark the inside.” Dean shuffles his feet to line up and presses the head to Cas’ hole. “Tell me you want it.”
“M’sorry. I was playin’ beer pong and kinda lost count. It won’t happen again, sir.” He looked down at his hands and sighed.
Cas popped off and gripped the base of Dean’s cock, staving off the orgasm that had been
Again, they’re flipped, but this time Dean pulls out long enough to roll him over. He shoves that massive thing back inside of him before Cas can utter a word, and the next thing he knows, Dean’s hot breath is ghosting over his neck and the back of his ear. “Now you can come.”
“Y’know what... I just might.” He finished eating and crumpled up the wrapper. “Wasn’t touching you with those fuckin’ briefs on though. Laundry’s clean now, so you’re fresh outta excuses.”
Dean hauled Eric across the dusty floor to the entrance of the bay where they set up and carefully looked around the corner, trying to see if Cas was ready.
Before Dean can pounder Cas’ statement, Cas licked up his shaft slowly, making Dean release a very manly whimper at the soft wetness of Cas’ expert tongue.
He could see the blood and more importantly, the primal look in Dean’s eyes, the green almost nonexistent.
Eric eyed him but nodded. “Yeah, don’t tell me that little overgrown twink called the cops on
but... I thought maybe you like dudes... I didn’t know exclusively or not, but I’ve never seen you even look at a chick's ass, so...” He shrugged. “I wouldn’t judge you either way.”

“Yeah. We already broke the rules by skippin’ out on her little games but once those are done and everyone goes to the rooms they all normally stay the night together. I ju— I didn’t wanna assume you’d want that.” He leans further into the touch he craves and closes his eyes.
“You’ll catch on. Just start with one finger and work your way up.” He laid on his back, his cock heavy on his stomach.
Never judge a chapter by its title 🤣
“It’s...” Dean’s eyes dropped to their hands and he smiled at them, relaxing. What was he so worried for? “They’re delicious, trust me. I was gonna call, or text... but I uhh...”
did. “If he touches me will you kill him?” He’d be lying if he said his cock didn’t twitch at the thought. He loved when Dean got protective.
Dean nearly doubled over; he knew exactly where Cas must be holding the phone for those sounds to be that clear. “Cas, I can't co— ah, move your hand faster.” He did. The sound of Cas’ hand sliding over his lubed-up cock grew louder, each impact followed by a muffled sigh or groan from Cas. Dean worked to get his thrusts so that they were in time with what he could hear of Cas’. His head lolled against the back of the couch, and Dean used the last remaining cognitive power he possessed to put his phone on speaker. “Would you fuck me, Cas? If you were here, would you split me open?”
something to him.
“Then walk it the fuck off!”
for days.
Dean gallic shrugged and wiped the corner of his mouth with his thumb. “You’re on, what you have in mind, pretty eyes?”
The Roadhouse wasn't far from him, and he got off work early enough it wouldn't really matter when. All he had to do was convince Carmen to go somewhere else for a while, or just tell her he was working late, which happened often enough she shouldn't think twice about it. Again, he kinda felt like a dick... but she'd opened this door, not him. And it was just one time, right? To help Cas out and get it out of his system?
it! “Ah! Fuck!
Castiel’s eyes opened when he felt Dean grip his wrist and instantly came hard. Nearly blacking out at the release. He slammed into his lover, working his way through his orgasm before collapsing down on his back, kissing him in a way to thank him without saying the words.
That voice in his ears only makes it worse... no, better... no... “Fuck,” is all he can respond. He twists his hand and nearly closes his eyes as he pushes his cock forward between his legs and strokes himself harder. The sound of skin sliding roughly against wet skin fills his ears, and he unashamedly turns his head to watch Dean.
“Good.” Cas smiled and looked like he might kiss him again.
They shared a moment full of unspoken words before Cas climbed out of the car and walked over by the cop’s cruiser. The bastard wasn’t wasting any time and began unbuckling his pants. “Come on now, on your knees. If this ain’t good, that little story was bullshit and I’m taking you both in.”
The only conclusion he could come to was that Cas just didn't want to hurt his feelings. Dean probably made shit weird by crossing the line and taking his blindfold off, and then asking the guy to stay for dinner like some kinda date.
Dean was about halfway through his burger when his phone chimed with a text from Cas.
“Fuck... yeah...” Dean groans, tossing his head back and closing his eyes tightly so he doesn’t near the edge.
Dean just listened. It was like he was running on autopilot, except... Cas was the one giving him directions. It was kind of nice, if he was being honest. Having the responsibility of figuring a way out of their immediate situation taken from him and just being able to

Dean taking such good care of Cas helped. If this dark cloud wasn’t over his head, he might have smiled at the fact that Dean gave him the last orange Gatorade. But all he had the energy to do was nod. Cas took a small drink from the bottle and rolled back over, hoping the drop would be over after a nap.
Cas walked back over, acting as though he wasn’t still completely naked. “It’s a quarantine, Dean. I let my students pick when they are available for my class to accommodate this hard time. They chose Monday, Wednesday and Saturday mornings, I’m willing to sacrifice for them. Are you coming in for another round? Because if not, I’d like to read a little before bed.” Cas pushed Dean out of the doorframe and shut the door.
Cas didn’t hear him until the second time Dean called his name and he climbed down from the ladder. “Hello,
loved it, but Cas? No.
“Of course. Can’t go a day without seeing that face.” Cas grinned innocently, happy his wrists were covered so Alec wouldn’t ask questions. He got a free coffee,
“Oh, I plan on it.”
“He is. Not that he’d let anyone see that. He’s had so many offers for his art and he turned them all down. Doesn’t think he’s worth more apparently.” Nick walked away to go check on his brother. Leaving Dean to his thoughts.
Dean scowled at his too-bright phone screen. His brother Sam had just informed him that their father had died - big deal, the guy’d been on death’s doorstep since Dean was a toddler, and Dean could count on one hand the amount of times he’d seen him in his entire life. The news certainly wasn’t worth waking up to, but then again… was
“Why’s it always about sex with you Novak’s? No, we haven’t yet.” Dean’s eyes widened at his use of the word
“He’s with me.” Cas came out from the hallway. “We’re a package deal tonight...
Cas hadn’t stepped foot in a Walmart in well over a year. Of course, it looked the same as all other Walmarts, but it still felt surreal to be doing something so...
would help.
Dean rolled the question around in his mind. He supposed that yeah, he considered murder what he did for a job. He actually got paid for it once, that’s how he figured out he was good at it and it helped with the voices in the first place. Since then, he’d been hustling pool, robbing his victims and using fake credit cards to stay alive and ahead of the cops. “Uhh, yeah. I travel for work, but there’s no set... schedule? I usually just bounce around every couple of weeks.” He flicked his eyes towards the diner’s door and back to Cas. “We gonna go in or sit here all night? This wasn’t supposed to be a damn date, I’m starving.”
“God damnit.” He pulled Cas off him and dragged him forward until he was straddling his shoulders. Dean sucked his cock into his mouth, straining his neck to take him deep.
Cas closed his eyes and took a breath. He looked around the diner and then back into Dean’s eyes, where he could see that Dean wasn’t joking. It was clear he’d done
Dean actually feels bad. Yeah, he’s never hurt Cas personally, but he’s sure his exes probably had this exact complaint about him. Do they feel like they disappointed him, too? “You don’t, Cas.”
Those electric blue eyes flashed up to his. “Hello, Dean. Um... sure, have a seat.”
Cas’ eyes were closed and he nodded. Of course he would let Dean try, but he was still embarrassed. All he could think about is how Dean said how pretty he was like
Cas absolutely loved a brat. They weren’t for every dom, that was for sure, but Cas favorite thing was fucking the brat out of his partners, just to wake up and have to do it again.
a big deal. The thought of his little brother becoming more and more dependent on these pills scared him, especially when it wasn’t all Cas was taking.
The second the front door closed, Dean felt an emptiness. This wasn’t just some hero complex, he had actually begun to… no, Dean had
Cas hid his smirk behind his burger. He was giving Dean too much of himself. Did he want Dean to fuck him again?
, but he hit send anyway.
“Do you have any regrets?” he asks, a flicker of doubt flashing in those angelic blue eyes.
“What, you don’t think you can fuck me as good as I fuck you? Most of the time I don’t even
Dean was an expert at seeing without really looking and when a dark haired man with a leather jacket walks in by themselves, you pay attention. He spent some time flirting with his drink, letting his eyes wander aimlessly but never quite landing on the man. He waited to see if anyone joined him, but they didn’t. He didn’t want to let his hopes get too high so early, he was going to need to remind himself to keep his normal pace. Catch and release a couple of times; learn his habits and his story before he could pounce. Chances were good he’d find something that made him an invalid candidate in the first five minutes, but hell. He’d be lying to himself if he said he didn’t want to see how bad this one squirmed while getting fucked dry and then hung up on meathooks by his fucking shoulderblades. He looked like a
Dean on the other hand was completely spaced out the entire drive home, surprised when he pulled into his garage so quickly. On autopilot, Dean walked inside and instantly jumped in the shower.
Dean was good. Yes, he was a brat, but he was also a good boy. Cas knew Dean would do much better with praise than with degrading, and that was just another notch on their compatibility list.

“Charlie! Don’t let her touch food!” Cas followed her with Dean close behind.
But still… he wants more. They haven’t crossed that final line yet, and at this point, Cas doesn’t care how it happens. He just…
right in?”
It didn’t.
His words seemed to relax Dean, because he settled back against the couch a little closer to Cas. “Right. Yeah. I just know this whole ass situation is uncomfortable enough as it is, I don’t wanna make it worse for anyone if there’s something I can do to...
Oh yeah. He could tell.
“Not even close. I mean, don’t get me wrong... your mouth is pretty damn awesome but it was your eyes that saved your life.”
Dean sighed quietly but got into the car. “Fine. You’re lucky you’re cute.” He reversed the car and then got on the road.
He tries, but he can't get any words out. Everytime Cas opens his mouth, all he does is moan, rocking up and sinking back down on Dean’s cock and reaching up to brace himself on the ceiling. Finally, he manages a “fucking fuck, I love your cock” as he starts moving faster, his own length smacking Dean’s torso with each movement.
“Awesome. If you find my skittles, feed them to me.”
“Suck on my neck, make me come, baby.” He sped up, baring his neck for Dean. “Fucking bite it.”
Dean pulled into a busy city in South Dakota and went to work, securing himself a no-questions-asked cash only motel room and scoping out the surrounding area. He looked for bars, clubs, anything that would have the kinds of people he was looking for with minimal security. He clocked a couple of places and then kept driving. Motel rooms weren’t always the best place for the kinds of murders Dean committed - the walls were too thin and the stains were too hard to remove from the carpet. He preferred secluded warehouses or old churches.
“Nah... fuck... do it...” Dean’s grip squeezes impossibly tighter as he moans Cas’ name under his breath. “Sso goood.”
“Cas!” Charlie shook him awake and laughed when he flinched. “What kind of dream were you having?”
After a week of no news from Cas
“Fuck me good, angel. Don’t make me hit the bar after.”
Craved the pet name this monster has given him. “Ah fuck, Dean. Gonna come!”
Fuck me like the devil you are.” He looked back down to meet Dean’s gaze once more.
Cas fucked Dean right back down into that mattress. Dean’s arms felt like jello anyway, he wouldn’t have lasted much longer trying to hold himself up through Cas’ assault. He was drooling all over the sheet and there was a matching fucking wet spot from his cock leaking all over the place every time Cas made him see stars. He was right, he wasn’t gonna be able to come without something else, but Cas finally being the one to take what he needed from
“Fuck... all mine?” Cas kissed back and leaned down to suck on his neck. “I missed you.” He whispered breathlessly, in Dean’s ear.
Dean’s breathing quickened.
It would have to be enough.
“Sure you do,
sucking dick, and that realization alone had Dean nearing the finish line.

The guy clears his throat and stands up as he shakes Dean’s hand, and Dean’s surprised yet again at how strong his grip is. “I'm Castiel, but most people just call me Cas.”
found his keys.
“You still have that photo?” Cas asked suddenly, he had been thinking about it since that night.
She joked, earning a 10/10 Novak bitchface.
Dean huffed a laugh and before he could ask what he meant, Cas sent another photo and this time, he could see some of Cas' apartment. It looked similar to Dean’s, nothing stood out except the dark red couch. The actual center of the photo was a plate of pancakes across from Cas’ own plate, complete with Cas flipping off the empty chair.
hand that he nearly messes up the handoff. Once he’s got it, he focuses on his own length and as always, squirts an overly generous amount down his shaft. He moans already, then closes the cap and fumbles with his laptop to actually choose a video. “Okay... this one looks good.”
From the couch, Jo heaves a dramatic sigh. “You're breaking our hearts, but what kind of friends would we be if we said no to that?” She grins, then starts counting heads with her fingers. “We may end up with a threesome tonight unless Dean skips out on us.”
Meg knew it was either Nick or Dean pounding on her door but she was shocked to see both, “Wow, this is a shocker. Let me guess, you want me to give up Cas?”
The rumble of Cas’ laugh radiated up his spine, but thankfully he didn’t pull off again. He kept working the tip as his hand stroked his shaft and every so often, he moved his hand to massage his balls and deep throat him. Cas’ bj’s were a fucking art.
is here.
Unfortunately, the women cared and they couldn’t get past second base before they were knocking but it was fine, dinner was ready and they really were hungry. Sex would have to wait.
Cas had never just nodded after being told what to do. It was why his ass has been kicked more times than he can count. But something about
As they walk in, it's immediately clear that their relationship is flourishing. They're so close to each other that it's a wonder they're able to move forward at all — it brings to mind children at a picnic doing a three-legged race, though it's not something that comes across as awkward or unmanageable. They simply can't stay away from each other.
“It’s Thursday. We have school tomorrow, but I don’t think you will be there.” She told her friend she would be right back and steered Dean down a hallway. “Where do you normally stay when you sleep here?”
Cas bit back a laugh. “You wouldn’t? Would their pajama pants
Cas whimpered and shoved in his finger faster than he meant to. He hummed a halfhearted apology, because it was Dean’s fault anyway. He wanted Cas to come apart at the seams, so that was exactly what he was getting. Cas slid in a second finger and sucked Dean further inside his throat.
Cas scrambled up so his back was to the headboard as he rubbed his neck, unable to meet Dean’s gaze.
Dean dropped his head to Cas’ lap, exhaling hard as relief rushed through him. He chuckled quietly and clicked his tongue. “What can I say? I don’t do anything halfway.”
hadn’t had the opportunity to have one on one time with Cas. There was always at least one other person when they fucked.
Dean scowled at the sight. “Are you planning on going somewhere without me? We haven’t needed phones yet.”
Dean brushed his fingers over Cas’ prostate and laughed quietly. “Just because you said that, I think I’m gonna make you come first and
opinion, buddy.” He grins and sets the phone aside.
Cas laughed, loudly. ”That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me,” he joked. “And orange, always orange.”
Dean hesitated slightly, unsure how much he should say… Would Cas think it weird if he said he loved every second of it? Ultimately, he decided that they were already here so he may as well be honest, but maybe it would be best to handle it delicately.
Cas turned around and let his devil take care of him.
By the next Christmas, Cas is so in love he can hardly believe it. While their friends had originally had a thing or two to say about their relationship — mainly Lisa — everyone has been supportive since, and Dean and Cas are virtually inseparable. As they prepare for the party, Cas catches Dean under the mistletoe and kisses him. “We could stay home, you know. Let them have their party without us.”
When Cas’ thumb pressed into his slit, Dean snapped out of it and moaned a little too loudly.
Sure enough, they made it back to camp alive and just in time for dinner. Dean didn’t say goodbye, and Cas found himself grumpier about that than getting lost. But why? Why did Cas care?
“Thanks Cas, I’ll do that. I definitely wasn’t ready to get out of bed this morning.” Dean grumbled, he sounded slightly annoyed, but Cas didn’t feel it was directed at him so he chose not to dwell on it.
Cas let the man lead them to the stairs and glanced at Dean, wanting to know their next move.
Booking the appointment is a little harder. A lot of therapists are booked out a few weeks, but with the help of a little acting and faux desperation, he’s able to book an appointment for that Thursday. “Hope Bee’s free,” he says to himself as he logs back into the school’s website, and when Castiel gives the all clear, Dean rubs his hands together and snaps the laptop shut. “We got this.”

That’s how long it lasted. Two
“Oh, will you?” Dean teases, pouring them even bigger shots than the last time. “For the record, you’re not an ass, but you do have an amazing one.”
Dean relaxed a little, Cas’ palm was warm against his and it was oddly comforting. “If it makes you feel better, we can be pickier about who we kill. Go after the worst of humanity, instead of just the loneliest.”
His ears turned pink but god, it felt fucking good for someone to recognize that. All it did was boost Dean’s confidence and he took that cock a little deeper, surprised that the girth and taste and fact that it was a
Dean smirked to himself upon hitting send. He damn well knew that Cas would see straight through that.
Not knowing what Cas looked like was starting to drive him nuts. Whether he liked it or not, that mystery mouth was starting to invade every fantasy he had - both solo and with Carmen. Dean had never been the type to really let his mind wander during actual sex, he loved the feeling of a woman’s body underneath him and usually didn’t need anything else to get him going - but that fucking tongue… just…
After running around Benny’s property like a damn psycho for over an hour, he finally felt calm enough to return home. He still felt on edge, unable to shake the raw feeling on his skin and the unwelcome prickle of needles on his hand and shoulder where he was touched.
Dean smiled.
“Opposite. I want to get in my car, drive to your house, and pin you against the wall so hard you have bruises for days.”
to find Nick.
Nick was still frowning, “Why would you do that for him?” Dean can see Nick’s face soften, “Because something
“Oh f— that— Cas!” Dean comes with a whimper, his body trembling as he adds to the mess in white spurts. Cas doesn’t stop until they’re both twitching from being oversensitive.
The dark haired one was everything he hoped he’d find, and to top it off, he was on his knees. In Blue. Friggen. Panties. Dean imagined this was probably a couple based on the camera and studio apartment in the background, and unfortunately the other guy looked nothing like him, but that didn’t matter. He was focused on the one giving the prize-winning blowjob.
Dean walked slowly toward Jesse. “If you’re runnin’ around kissin’ people, where’s
Dean woke up when his phone chimed. It was an unfamiliar noise, he’d never owned a cell phone and this was certainly the first time it ever rang. He poked at the screen with groggy eyes until the message appeared from Cas. He’d made it to the coffee shop with David and would see him later. Dean responded with a predictive ‘thumbs up’ emoji and got out of bed to shower and clean his shoulder. He stared in the mirror after and noticed he barely recognized his reflection - his cheeks were fuller, less hollowed out from the hunger he’d grown used to over the years. Cas always made sure he ate, even when he forgot. His eyes had lost some of their steel glint, again... mostly thanks to Cas. He looked almost
Two weeks.
brother Dean. This is much harder on me I assure you.”
Cas’ eyes shot open and locked on Dean, his tongue was mid lick when he froze and sat up. “Really? What happened?”
Dean grins, loving how the small touch of their hands helps keep him grounded. “One, I’d never get sick of you. Two, we could live in a friggin mansion and you’d still not have privacy from me. I have no boundaries. And three, thanks. Really, I dunno what I’d do without you.”
“Fuck you!” He said, with less conviction this time. Cas chuckled and walked back over, blade in hand and poked it inside the man’s ankle wounds. “I may not know where to cut, but I can play with these, right, baby?” Cas asked as he looked up at Dean, his voice low and thick from desire. He didn’t know how much blood had gotten on his face when Dean touched him, but he also didn’t care.
Dean’s mouth turned up in a barely visible smile as he held Cas to him. “Yeah, alright. Guess that wasn’t
to this asshole, he better at
Cas blows Dean two more times before he finally feels ready to return the favor. He doesn’t feel pressured in the slightest, but he wants to know how it feels to blow Cas. He wants to know if he can make him feel half as good as Cas makes him feel.
Dean snatches them and barks a laugh when he sees they're glow-in-the-dark. “This is awesome! Can you imagine fuckin’ in the dark but you can still see your dick? Speakin’ of dicks, does yours ever just get randomly hard and you’re just like ‘what is it, boy? What do you see?’”
Cas followed, “But I’m a great multitasker.”
Dean played like his life was on the line the second game, and it only took him three turns to finish the game. Maybe he shouldn’t have made such a complete 180, but the first game took longer than he wanted it to and he desperately needed to get back to the safety of solitude. He wasn’t worried about Cas, he’d marked a couple of chicks so there was virtually nothing dangerous about that, but they were still in a sketchy bar and were technically wanted men. He quickly collected his winnings, but the men were angry. They’d finally worked out that they’d been hustled, so Dean put on his best charming smile as the two beefy men tried to corner him. “Listen, fellas. I told ya it was just my lucky night. You guys might’ve won, but this one,” Dean took a moment to poke the smaller one in the chest, “kept staring at
“Yes. It’s not from scratch, it was just a frozen one, but it’s all I could do on such short notice.”
Cas strips quickly, thankful they decided against having a party this year after the mess they made last year. Once he’s completely naked for almost no reason at all, Cas straddles Dean’s lap and brings their cocks together, stroking to chub them up and spitting to add some lube.
Cas popped off, “Sorry, be right back.” He ran to his bedroom to find some lube.
He opened up the door and let Dean inside. “I’m sorry! The phone died, I was just heading back.”
“You had to go out today huh? Fuck Cas, if we weren’t handcuffed right now I’d punch that smirk off your fucking face!” Nick whispered angrily.
Dean did to him. He made sure to stay still, and let Dean move his hands however he wanted, closing his eyes and releasing
Cas laughed at that but his tone was serious. “You aren’t drinking anymore, right?”
“Course you do. Want you just as bad.” He pulled his fingers out and lubed himself up, shoving in maybe a little too quickly. He buried his face in the side of Cas’ neck and let out a whine at the fucking incredible squeeze. “So good, Cas.”
“If I did, I wouldn’t have needed a photo.” His cock had softened slightly, but it was still bulging in his sweatpants.
“Yes! Ask one more time and I’ll invite Lisa.” That was a low blow, but she knew it would open his eyes to how serious she was about this party.
Dean tried to hold off, just so he could hear the moans coming from Cas as he came. It had to be the best thing he’d
Dean couldn’t help but smile before the reality hit him.
It was hot and warm and so unlike anything he’d ever experienced with a chick that he couldn’t hold back, he barreled into Cas and let go with a low, sinful moan, pulling Cas down to kiss him as he filled him up.
“Gad! Get over here, let me suck you off.”
Cas shuddered,
Nick kicked his foot again. “Shut the fuck up.” Cas rolled his eyes but listened this time, watching Dean intently. This guy wasn’t going to cave and biting his tongue has never been easy for Cas.
before you left
When he walks to the bathroom to clean himself off, he looks down and sees he’s already hard again. “Sonofabitch... nah, Cas, there’s no such thing as enough.”
Cas grinned and leaned in for a quick kiss. “Like that? Or…” Cas kissed him again, this time more heatedly. “Like
“I’m not saying their gender. But I feel shitty about it... and I absolutely want to do it again.” He covered his face in shame.
Too many people were surprised at how boring Cas actually was when he’s not bantering or partying. He would rather just draw with some music for hours or sit with the old man around the corner and just stare at his garden. Some of his best drawings happened in that garden and Tuesday, never pressured him to talk. Cas never even asked his real name, he called him that, because every Tuesday, he would struggle to walk to the market for some fresh fruit and now that Cas was sober and awake in the daylight, he started going for him each week.
Cas turned towards Dean. “Is that so? If it is unowned, why do I need permission? And more importantly, why would you do that for me? What would you want in return?” Cas asked genuinely curious.
Cas pulled him back down and gripped his hips, rutting up against him and sighing in relief. Dean moaned as he dropped his forehead to the crook of Cas’ neck; he’d been so lost in his attempt to map out Cas’ curves and jagged edges that he hadn’t even noticed he was rock fucking hard. The head of Cas’ cock slid up and down his shaft and it nearly punched the breath from his lungs. There was something so unbelievably erotic about it that if he
wouldn’t get the satisfaction of his curiosity. But he couldn’t help it. He pictured Dean and opened it tentatively.
“I know the name, but she must have forgotten to mention how hot you were.” Charlie shook her head and laughed, but was immediately pulled away into another hug. Cas was curious about Dean, he’d known Charlie a while and never expected her roommate to look like
“Yeah.” He moves his arm behind Cas’ head and pulls him on his chest with a sated groan. “Sleep good, Cas. Actually feel like I can sleep now.”
“Good. I’ll be here all day, we can do whatever we need to keep you busy and if it is too hard, well… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” Dean expected Cas to jump on the,
Cas woke up first, thanks to mother nature, and made his way to the bathroom to clean up. Dean was sleeping peacefully so Cas took it upon himself to go out and get them some food. Dean was always the one to do it and Cas wanted to help out. He didn’t dare take the impala, so he chose a place within walking distance, hoping they would have breakfast sandwiches.
Dean would always be

He teased.
Dinner’s over.” He stood, and had absolutely no intention of paying for their food, so he looked around for the waiter. He found him cowering near the register. He said loudly, “Since you seem to enjoy giving out free dinners, we’re gonna call this one even, yeah?” He turned his eyes back to Cas, who hadn’t stood up yet. “Why aren’t you

“Welcome. My name is Cordelia Alarie, and it’s a pleasure to meet you both. Taking the first step with therapy opens you to such deep levels of vulnerability, and I commend each of you for caring enough about both yourselves and one another to take this step. I like to begin these sessions on a positive note as we are likely to discuss things that won’t always feel so positive. Today I’m going to ask you to tell me — in simple terms — what do you like most about each other?”
“Jesus Christ, Car…” He shuddered, making a grossed out noise and texting her back that he wasn’t nervous and she should probably get that checked out by a doctor, or maybe a detective or something. He tossed his phone down on the couch and unlocked the door, knowing Cas would be there any minute.
Cole cut in. “No offense, Deano, but you’ve worn out your welcome with random precision.”
A number flashed across the screen and Dean was tempted to call in a false tip, but knew it would be an unnecessary risk. He stepped forward to pay for his gas with his head down.
“Thank you, baby.” Dean kissed him. “Best present ever is your face.” He kissed all over his face annoyingly until Cas was shoving him back with a huge smile. “Where’s Charlie?”
Dean held Cas tight to keep him warm, humming a song from 1962 and Cas closed his eyes to listen. Both of them were nervous about the future, but at least they’d always have each other.
Dean eyed him, showing absolutely no emotion on his face and for the first time, Castiel squirmed.
"You are creepy," Cas says with a grin. "But you're gorgeous enough that most of us just ignore it."
They were pretty much inseparable, especially because Michael was no longer trying to take up all of Cas’ attention. He still couldn’t believe Dean agreed to wrestle Michael in the first place, but every time Cas caught a glimpse of Dean’s shiner, he’d grin from ear to ear. Finally, somebody knew exactly who he was, and still fought for him.
“Why not?” Cas asked. “It’s 3 in the morning, you could be dreaming right now.” He smiled. “Tell Cas what’s on that gorgeous mind of yours. Or even better, show him.” Okay, maybe that was a little challenging, but Cas hadn’t gotten laid in days and dreaming or not… there was only one cock he really wanted.
He stopped stroking himself a while to browse the internet and learn about sexualities, but his dick was still hard; it was not going to let up until he finally got some release. Before he knew it, he was watching porn. Gay porn.
Anthony’s answering smile was predatory, and Dean knew he had him. “We’ll give you the friends and family discount, we’ll start with $20 each.”
Dean shrugged and drove home.
“Mmhmm,” Cas said, already drifting from consciousness. He hadn’t taken control in so long it took everything out of him. “You’re a power bottom and I’m not surprised,” he mumbled.
Cas broke their gaze, “Can you pull this straw out of my cock please? Pretty boy can stay in the room though.” Cas nodded at Dean with a grin.
“Don’t hate on the bucket, your car is at least fifteen years younger and
Cas smiled and climbed off. “Thank
it made Castiel feel.
But would it be so bad if he was? Dean seemed to be doing just fine. How did he figure it out? It wasn’t until past bedtime that Cas finally worked up the courage to text again.
“You want my cock? Then shut up.” He grabbed the tattered remains of the briefs and reached forward, roughly shoving them inside of Cas’ mouth. He added a third finger and then growled in frustration, pulling back to undo his pants and release his throbbing length into the night air. He no longer cared who was watching, he spit on Cas’ hole and thrust in quickly. Dean hissed from the burn but it turned to a moan as the pain and pleasure spiked through him.
what he expected.

Dean huffed a laugh as Michael walked up, not batting an eye at the nickname. Football players calling each other by their jersey number was common. “Sup, nerds, ready for the party tonight?”
Cas climbed in and as soon as he turned to face
Dean watches her walk away and turns to pour another drink. He got Lisa’s name last year and really wanted someone else this time, especially after he saw Cas.
“Is that what we're going with?” he responds in a voice deeper than sin. “Estranged lovers?”
“Cole, seriously? It’s 1pm.” Dean checked out his best friend.
“Well, good. Want me to...” He pointed at the door and looked into Dean’s eyes again.
Dean walked over proudly, sitting between Cas’ brothers like he belonged there, and maybe he did. Their conversation flowed easily and Cas didn’t even realize he was staring before his mom made her way over and wrapped an arm around him. “Are you okay?”
say he was sorry - but the words still wouldn’t come. When Cas’ thigh was patched up, he gently took Cas’ hands and applied some of the salve to his wrists, and then put some on his fingertips and held them out near Cas’ neck in a silent request for permission.
None of this was easy. Castiel had been a little shit his entire life, complete with his smartass mouth. He was what they called a bratty bottom, and no one has ever been able to fuck it out of him. Until now, except he
Cas dresses in a daze, thinking about how cold Dean must be without a shirt. He brings him one from the backpack he set near the door, and when he walks into the hospital he’s directed to a waiting room where he sits for hours.
“Man, I love your mojo, Cas.” Dean leans over and kisses him softly. “And I love you.”
“Don't think I didn't get a bow already,” Cas agrees. Dean’s actually not far off at all, and Cas squirms a little just thinking about it. He stares at that gorgeous ass envisioning the plug underneath those jeans, and for a moment he considers scrapping the plan and taking him right now.
. Cas was brought back to reality as the man came, untouched, all over his upholstery. “Fuck yes baby, that cock fills me so good.”
yeah, we should try these on. Naked? Think we got at least... twenty minutes for a dicksaber battle before they get outta class.”
Cas didn’t see the cop right away, but he did catch the shift in Dean and it took a second for him to spot the officer Dean was avoiding. Castiel tensed when he heard words

“Well he’s comin’ too. You’re gonna be stuffed full on both ends when we fuck tonight, baby.” Unable to help it, Dean’s palm slides down Cas’ uniform and stops dangerously close to his cock, and when he starts to kiss along Cas’ neck, Charlie yells at them.
He nodded, like the

The next morning, Cas woke up first. He kissed Dean lightly, washed up and then threw on some tight light-wash jeans and a blue polo. He hated looking like this, but
Cas knew exactly what Dean’s would say: Perfect.

it was off but when he realized it was Dean, he froze and the tall man - named Nick - stood up. “Wasn’t taken a moment before. Why don’t you let him choose for himself?”
Dean antsy for a kill and clenching a knife had Cas’ dick hard in seconds. “Fuck... let’s go. We can take the food to go.”
“How sweet of you...
“You’re... fucking huge, Cas...” He hisses when Cas bottoms out and he feels so full, tears prickle his eyes. When the head of Cas’ cock hits a certain way, he groans. “Shit, that feels... holy shit.”
Cas stayed where he was bent over and watched Dean go to his trunk. Fuck, what was it about this guy that had Cas needing his cock so bad he couldn’t think straight? Cas pulled his own shirt off so he could hopefully feel the hard, cold metal of the Impala against his chest while he was pounded relentlessly.
Cas frowns deeply. “You
“Touch me, Dean.” She grabbed his hands and placed them on her breasts, reaching down to stroke him as the door opened. He could hear her whisper “hi,” but Cas didn’t respond.
*********
Cas wore some tight black jeans and a blue flannel button up - to match the streaks in his hair - under a thick black trench coat to keep warm. Nick was sure he was wearing some old band t shirt underneath it all to match his Metallica beanie pulled over his messy onyx locks. His black combat boots were worn but they were definitely Cas’ favorite shoes, he’d only occasionally wear some black high top chucks in the summer.

“Well, fuck me runnin’! You mean to tell me you live one street away, and we could have been fucking all year?”
took time to come down from, and Cas got his first taste of aftercare. Dean got him water, rubbed his head, kissed him and held him, all before washing him in the shower. He ordered Cas stay the night and he was glad, because he couldn’t imagine the idea of being apart.
"Mhm. I'm sure." Dean agreed, stretching his arms as they stopped at a stop light. "Look, dude, I'd stop talking before you get either of you in bigger trouble. You're wearing fingerless gloves, you have spray paint of the same color and kind on your shoes and under your nails. You're screwed. Luckily, you probably won't get more than community service and have to pay a fine, if this is your first offence, but if you do it again, that’s jail time.”
Cas cuddled close, knowing he was probably the only living human to ever cuddle this man. “Guess we will.”
Cas was rock hard, thinking of how Dean just killed a man for touching him. For kissing

was coming to help Castiel and the realization had that familiar warmth pooling inside his stomach.
He couldn’t help it, his mind instantly wandered to Cas tasting his come.
He knew he’d never be able to talk Cas out of it, and if he was being truthful... he didn’t really want to. Something inside of him changed irrevocably when he met Cas, and he wasn’t ready to give that up. “Alright, Cas. But, if you’re stickin’ by me... we’re not
His stomach flipped and his dick woke up at that. The thought that Cas wanted Dean to come inside of him was almost too fucking hot to handle, and he shook out his arms to shake loose some of the tension building in his shoulders.
Cas frowned. “So we’ll be apart?” The thought made him nervous. “What do I do if he makes a move?” He asked, genuinely curious.

The fact that a month went by and Cas heard from Dean twice confirmed his suspicions that Dean had a hero complex. Cas wasn’t special and as much as he didn’t want that to bother him, it did. He was still sober, if you didn’t count edibles - which he didn’t. They kept him from being embarrassingly fidgety and that was enough.
He looked offended, “I’m not just going around kissing people, psycho! I liked Cas, he was my own personal angel today. I thought we had a connection and I was thankful he helped me, I was hoping to thank him with a blowjob or something but he denied me. I just haven’t gotten laid in months and he’s beautiful.” Jesse didn’t know why he was saying all this but he couldn’t help it. Dean’s gaze was so intense it felt like he was looking into his soul, it made him take a step back.
“I dunno, Cas, you’re the porn star. I’m sure you’ll think of something. Maybe start by not drinkin’ tomorrow… at least until you’re over here.”
“Yes, sir. I’ll slow down with chicks.”
A flash of anger coursed through Dean’s body at the sound of Cas’ voice. Not anger
After an hour of driving around Dean decided to check these so-called
Dean groaned, thrusting up into Cas' mouth. "C - I'm... shit, gonna come..."
drunk, Dean?” John stood over him with that I’m-not-mad-I’m-disappointed face.
“We need to get gas right now. You stay in the car and out of sight. We need to get our stuff, again, you stay in the car and then find somewhere out of town for you to wash up.” Cas always felt better with a plan. “But what the fuck Dean?! I didn’t kiss him back! I pushed him off and told him I was taken! I only want you.”
something Dean was ready to consider.
The shock spurs him on, and he stares up, watching every single expression cross that beautiful chiseled face but before Dean comes, he pulls Cas off by his fucked hair. “Goddamn, Cas. You’re fuckin gorgeous all the time but the way you look with my cock down your throat… I can’t. I wanna fuck you so bad.” Dean’s nervous too, he doesn’t want to cross any lines.
When she gets up to leave, she pulls out an envelope, handing it over to Dean. “He gave me this. He asked me to give it to you when I felt it was right, but I can’t hold onto it anymore. It belongs to you.”
——————
He wrapped the thing a little looser than normal around his head and laid down, tapping a beat on the blanket below him as he waited.
“Oh, when you rubbed your neck that wasn’t a signal to save you? My bad. I saved your ass though, that guy was clearly out of your league.” Dean couldn’t remember the last time he smiled this widely.
Dean couldn’t breath, he could barely see straight from how fucking tight Cas was. The angle was different than in the bathroom and this time, there were no clothes in the way. He planted his feet and thrust up, biting hard on his own lip as he watched his cock get swallowed whole by that perfect ass. “Missed you too, sweetheart.”
Rose stepped toward him, looking up at him with grey eyes through long, curled lashes. “Baby, I don’t think you could ever embarrass yourself. If it helps, we can just play for fun. No money involved.”
click with?”
nor anything a normal person shouldn’t be able to do to another
Castiel stares down at his blank paper, wishing with everything in him that he didn’t have to do this.
“There’s pir?” Cas mumbled with his mouth full.
“I don’t care either way. Honestly. Just don’t want it to look suspicious. Or maybe people would just assume the killer got me?” Cas tilted his head and thought about it.
Castiel nodded, of course he could. He could come from
“Harry Potter. You?”
likes does change that… right?
I think we’re going to start posting twice a week now! Tuesday’s and Friday’s, see you then!
“Cas, wake up.” Dean tapped his knee.
Dean forced himself not to peek at the wall all weekend and on Monday, the original community service officer was back. Dean was off duty but his curiosity finally got the best of him and he drove over to the old building.
Well, now is your chance to and you just walked away.”
and Dean mentally kicked himself for going somewhere
Cas let David suck him off a few moments, before he began fucking into his throat. David squirmed and tried to get away but Cas had a grip on his hair. Cas assaulted his throat for a moment before ripping him off and tossing him backward.
He closed the distance between them and snapped the man's legs together, turning his entire body back toward the bar. Dean’s broad hand gripped the back of the man’s neck and squeezed as he leaned in to crowd his space. “You present yourself like a whore, you get fucked like a whore. Do you have
starving. He had been for awhile, but without having an actual job and when he was as deep in a paranoid state as he'd been lately, food wasn't always easy to come by. Nor was it at the forefront of his mind. He took the container with a nod and fished around in random drawers until he found a fork. He ate the meal cold. It didn't take him long to finish it and once he did, he turned to toss the container in the trash. “Uhh... thanks. I eat, I just... forget sometimes. Guess today was one of those days.”
Dean offers a toothless grin and nuzzles into Cas’ neck. “We don’t share well. Sorry guys. But we’re here for the booze and the games.” He kisses Cas and stands up straight, clapping his hands together. “Alright, get this party goin’. My
“I’m fine, I was just exhausted and starving. Today will be better. We have the scavenger hunt, right?”
Cas entered the house, relieved to not see anyone downstairs and went straight to the shower, before going back to bed. His thumb hurt from the cut, but even worse, the cloud of depression weighing down on him took a physical toll. He slept for at least a day before Dean tried to talk to him again and when he woke that morning, his muscles ached.
want to?"
more.” He had tears running down his face now. “Please fuck me into the mattress, Dean.”
Charlie’s house was nice… for this side of town. It was just her and her aunt there, and she had been looking for a job to help out financially. The selfish part of Cas hoped she wouldn’t find one too soon. Who would he talk to all day? Surely not Kevin. He wasn’t interested in much outside of school, and he’d only gotten worse each year closer to college.
Dean laid on his bed and stared at the ceiling.
Cas collapses forward so hard their teeth clatter, but neither shy away. The kiss is slow, messy and completely sated. It says all the words neither of them can form, and when it finally ends, they both smile.
to argue with this guy?” He grabbed a rubber hammer and started nailing in the anchors.
Dean pulled off with a grin. “Gonna grab the lube.” He nipped Cas’ hip and stood up, adjusting his throbbing boner as he opened his dresser.
The chemistry between them is like nothing she’s ever seen before or since, and it had taken all her self control to not reach out to them before now to satisfy her insatiable interest in their budding relationship.
“Fuck... Dean!” Cas moaned and came all over the counter, growling happily as he pushed back again. Dean worked him through it, kissing and biting every inch of skin he could reach.
They make their way out quickly, and Cas braces them both one more time as he takes them back to the present. They land in the bunker’s garage and Cas quickly puts a finger to Dean’s lips to shush him. “I told them when we got back, you'd be theirs for the day… and I'm not done with you just yet.”
He couldn’t stop staring at Cas as the waitress came over to take their order, and when Cas ordered for both of them, he didn’t complain. She walked away and Dean wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans. “Does it... hurt?”
A bitter laugh escaped his throat, “Fantastic.” He didn’t mean to sound like an asshole, but he was past the point of faux smiles. Cas walked over and opened the door.
“Sup, Winchester.” Nick replied. “What are you doing on this side of the tracks?”
Dean hated the fact that he only had two hands. How was he supposed to choose between keeping Cas pinned, pulling his hair, scratching down his back, choking him so his ass squeezes around Dean’s cock and gripping his hips so hard the bruises last for
Dean peppered kisses over his shoulders, speaking only when he managed to drag his lips away. “I told you, touching you is a privilege I will never take lightly.” He pulled away enough to allow Cas to maneuver onto his back again. They locked eyes, and Dean swore he could see the entire expanse of the universe in Cas’. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t just sex. It wasn’t even limited to this plane.
Cas shook his head. “I didn’t mean that way. I have other skills…” He trailed off, trying to think of another skill he had. “I can distract people?”
“How are you doing this to Eli Manning? You said you loved me.”
“I know, I trust you. How did… you do it?”
“Yeah... I can stay...”
Castiel shook his head no.
Cas hummed and he bared his neck, one last time. He knew what was about to happen, and yet, he had a small smile on his lips. “I know, I’m sorry too.” He didn’t know what else to say.
Dean had to fight the urge to take him right then, he was
Everything was black.
He was always proudly bisexual, but after a one night stand a few months ago with a guy named Cole, it was all he could think about. Dean was a soft top, and girls don’t always do well with that, but guys do.
Dean scratches his head as he thinks about it. “Uh... we talked about politics for like three seconds and... did we talk about porn? Or am I just horny?”
Dean slid into the car and had the key turned in the ignition by the time Cas rounded the car and got in. Their doors slammed in unison and Dean risked a glance at the door. The cop had his gun drawn and fired a warning shot at Baby’s tires, but missed. That was all the warning Dean needed though, he threw his Impala in drive and stamped on the gas pedal. His heart was nearly in his throat as he pulled out of the parking lot with squealing tires. “Fuck, fuck, FUCK!”
Dean grunted his approval as he turned, letting Cas wash him. “You want him?”
to talk about it.
Dean rolled his eyes. “No shit. But maybe I’ll just hold onto it until you’re a good boy.”

“Ah fu— Cas... so fuckin’ good.” Gripping the steering wheel, Dean moans, his legs squirming under Cas.
aspect, so you not using words would be a problem." Cas watches the door, waiting for their turn to be called back — and Dean thinks about that for a few moments.
Dean nods like a bobblehead, his hand raking Cas’ hair. “Good. We got all night, Cas. I’m all yours tonight.”
“Let’s just pop these and see where they take us?” Balt said, handing Cas two Oxy as they walked out the door.
That wasn't what Dean meant, but he'd already kept Cas way longer than he should've and had no idea what kinda lines he crossed just by taking the blindfold off in the first place. "Least I can do, your mouth deserves a reward. See you... uh... Sunday?"
The woman screamed when the fight broke out and tried to hide behind Cas, but he’d seen Dean’s signal. “Sorry sweetheart, I gotta go. Have a good night.” He instantly made his way towards the door, but one of the men slammed into him as he tried to sneak by and he was suddenly happy Dean was already gone. His protective devil wouldn’t have let that slide, especially when he nearly fell over. But he caught himself on the bar, swiped the asshole’s wallet and made his way outside, heading straight for Baby.
Maybe he should have been worried. He was far away from any other human, completely alone. He was normally fine with being alone, but for some reason, the rumble of Dean’s loud ass car as he drove away made Castiel feel even lonelier than ever before. Which was probably why that dark abandoned church didn’t scare him. It was no different than his own studio.
Cas followed, his mind reeling. Most people would have given him shit for getting flustered or tried to defend themselves after a comment like that - but Dean didn’t. Was he just
He suddenly had the urge to cockblock Cas,
Cas smiled. “Lay back, and give me control, Dean.” He pushed Dean back slightly, staying on his lap and began kissing him.
That might have come out harsher than Dean intended, but this wasn’t a joke, and it definitely wasn’t a time to sugar coat.
The air was thick and what they both wanted was instantly apparent by their body language. Dean licked his lips slowly, the bratty smirk Cas expected was perfectly on display and in response, he set his glass down without looking away and sat up straighter. With one arch of his eyebrow, Cas saw everything he needed to see in Dean.
Cas moaned happily, the entire world disappearing around them. “More. Need you.” He wanted his devil inside of him,
“I was meaning a movie, but I’m down for that too.” Cas was fully smiling now and fuck, it was beautiful.
in the house off guard, especially Dean.
“Good.”
“Because Cas needs some meat on his damn bones Nick. When is the last time he had an actual meal?”
“Sounds good, thanks Pop.” Dean plopped down and dug in.
Cas drew an obscene picture of Dean while they waited for Sam to return. He was wearing only a police hat and was handcuffed with his arms above his head. His body was beautifully sculpted but his penis was microscopic. When Sam returned, Cas slid him the paper, “This is for your brother.”

“I just want some coffee in peace. Can I have one morning where someone isn’t trying to fix me?” His sharp response made Benny frown but he tried to remain patient.
More days pass with no sign of Cas, leaving Dean feeling solemn. He seriously needs to get this
Cas wasn’t sure what to think about that conversation, but Dean seemed genuinely excited. It definitely wasn’t a conversation he expected to have with Dean - or anyone for that matter. It was probably their first actual conversation that wasn’t about school or football or anything really, but at least it was entertaining.
When Dean approached, Cas flinched. The demon on his shoulder instantly wanted to grab them and take back this stupid gesture of peace. Dean must have noticed because he treaded lightly. “Is this what you want?”
“You’re incredible, Dean. Have I told you that recently?”
He tilted his head, confused.
Dean:
His eyes traveled across the bar and fixated on a young woman sitting by herself. He’d been stalking her for two weeks now, and she was
It felt good, even if the butterflies were so strong it was borderline uncomfortable. “Mmm, a little to the left.”
Their week was filled with long days and
His mind wandered the entire time, mainly to Dean. His eyes, the way his mouth looked when he - well, all the time. Smiles, frowns, when he bit his lip… Dean Winchester decidedly had one of the hottest mouths Cas had ever seen, and his dick twitched at the thought of being inside of it. But, it had been just about two full weeks since the quarantine had begun and they still hadn’t touched each other despite showering together and a few passing shoves. He was antsy, he didn’t like being cooped up and he didn’t like being in such close proximity with something - or some
“I suppose.” Cas holds his shot glass up and smiles slightly, bracing himself for what he’s about to ask. “Are you disappointed?”
“daddy” from now until I change my mind, I’ll kill you. You got it?”
before but it was best out of those options… or he could walk away and find someone easier. Someone that would give Cas all the power. Because
“Course you will.” Dean cracked his hand down in the same spot, then raked his nails over the reddening skin. “Don’t bullshit me, angel, we both know why you disobeyed.” He pulled his fingers out and spread Cas open, nudging the tip of his cock against his hole and breaching it, but then pulled back out and spanked Cas again. “This what you want, angel? Want me to spank you till the pain makes your dick throb and you’re begging me to fuck you into the mattress?”
Cas stopped bouncing and turned around again, moving his hips slowly on Michael and kissing him sensually. “Take me upstairs.” He whispered into his ear. And Michael didn’t have to be told twice. He stood without even moving Cas off and carried him to the stairs.
Cas licked his lips and groaned. “Better than the Devil himself.” Cas tried to lean forward for more.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to come back here, Dean. One of my coworkers was diagnosed with the virus yesterday afternoon, and I’ve been around her. It’s probably not safe for you to stay here, at least until I know for sure if I have it.”
did you just say?”
Dean comes with a sinful moan, his legs shaking from the release, and the look on Cas’ face as his come coats his cock is absolutely priceless. But none of it compares to the sound of Cas jacking off with his come. Between the wet, smacking sound and those delicious whimpers, it might just be the best thing Dean’s ever heard. “Fuck,” Cas breathes, fucking into his fist. “Feels so good, Dean... your come feels so fucking good.”
She glances up at the clock and the two minutes she has left before her questions will be answered stretch into small infinities. Two minutes and she will know. Two minutes longer, and maybe the sound of the seconds ticking by will stop feeling like they were designed purely to mock.
tongue... sliding up and down his —
“Yo! Wait, shit...” Dean squirmed, reaching out and then pulling back, clenching his fists because he didn’t have a clue if he was supposed to touch him or not. “Fuck.”
I think “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions” is an apt summary for this chapter.
when Cas kissed him like that. Maybe that’s why he could handle the thought of Cas fucking other people, but
Dean pulled Cole up and half carried him to the spare room. He tossed him on the bed, got him water and demanded he sleep it off. “My dad will be home in a few hours, get fucking sober or leave before then. Lock it up, Thirty.”
“I would say let’s go for a drive, but we would probably get in trouble.” Cas looked down and fixed his blanket. “I’m okay. Are you okay?” He held out one end of the blanket as an invitation.
“You’re beautiful, Castiel. So, responsive.” He fingered some of Cas’ precome and tasted it. “You’re already close aren’t you? Your body is shaking with anticipation and your cock is leaking profusely. Do you think you can wait for me to get inside you? Answer honestly.”
Cas laughed lightly, “You may touch me,
Cas stayed still for a bit before he decided to get a little bratty, he pushed back onto Dean’s fingers, which made Dean smack Cas’ ass hard with his palm. “Coulda sworn I told you to stay
“I can’t share you, Cas.” Dean’s voice got quiet, he was pretty sure he knew what Cas’ version of
It was gonna be a long night.
“Yeah... do you not want to? I thought you enjoyed it.”
Cas bit harder, this time drawing blood, “More?” He leaned on the other side and did the same.
Cas wanted him to take it.
What was the deal again?
Cas’ hushed laugh woke him up slightly, but Dean couldn’t remember what he said. “Sure, Dean. Get some sleep.”
“Hey look, it’s my candy partner. How's it doing? Going… how are you going? Dammit, you know what I mean.” He walked away from the girl he was talking to without a look back and made his way into Cas’ space.
“You think I need improvements? Because I think yours should stay just how it is.” Cas locked eyes with Dean as the nurse walks in the room.
Dean smiled so warmly it took everything not to kiss him again. “That’s okay. I won’t pressure you, no one has to know anything. Comin’ out is hard, Cas. I won’t take that from you.”
“No, I’ll be right there, I’ll even wear my red lace lingerie. You’ll see it before and after he leaves and you can touch all over me while he sucks you off. Deal?”
Dean glanced down at the phone on his seat and saw the message pop up. He grinned down at his phone, proud of his angel for successfully luring his first target. A quick peek in the mirror showed him that Eric had his face buried in his
, fancy meeting you here.” Cas approached Dean casually. “Here for more pictures?” Nick grabbed his arm worried his temper would come out but Cas was just admiring the man.
He tells himself that he doesn’t care, that he’s just asking out of sheer curiosity... but a big part of him knows that’s a lie.
Everyone worked hard until lunchtime. Dean treated everyone to sub sandwiches, another thing that intrigued Cas.
Dean’s eyes roved over his face and dropped to his neck, and Dean had a brief moment of embarrassment when he realized he nearly bit that hoodie wanting to reach that stubbled skin. “Yeah, always hungry. Didn’t know that’s how anon sex worked, but hell. I’ll take it.”
With a sigh, Jo walked around the bar to sit with Dean. “I don’t know. I’ve never actually dated a chick Dean, and Charlie is…
until someone knocks on the door, making them pull apart.
Cas on the other hand was frowning.
Cas threw on the same outfit but a different band and walked over to sit on the bed with Dean. “I have the Angel of Death in my bed. And you don’t scare me.” He grinned. “How did them calling you Angel feel?”
Dean made a

know it’s off, right?”
Dean forced his eyes back open and leaned further into his hand, reaching his own down to roughly jerk Cas’ cock. He knew he wouldn’t be able to form words at this point, but he knew
Cas chuckled, “I think that mouth can convince me a little better than your voice.” Cas’ voice was deepened with arousal, this may not be the real Dean but Cas was fucking horny.
The football team was full of sleazy jocks when Dean was a freshman, but now that he was a senior, he and a few others helped change the tone. To his surprise, most changed. Most of them
“The same. Where are your hands?” Dean felt his cheeks burn up, and considered lying but again, decided to go with honesty.
Cas still had his moments, one time Dean gripped his hips from behind when he was making his body wash and his entire body tensed. He had to fight every urge to shove him off and snap. Unexpected touch would probably always be a problem for Cas and he felt immensely guilty about it. Dean deserved more than he could give, he loved physical touch and Cas feared he would never be able to give Dean what he craved. He feared Dean would one day realize Cas wasn’t worth the trouble and leave, but in the meantime, Castiel was going to work hard on himself and never give up trying to be worthy of Dean. That being said, Cas was far from perfect.
Running a hand through his hair, Dean sighed. “Okay, okay, I shouldn’t have asked that. I really just want him to know business are interested in him. He can have some legit jobs soon if I could get ahold of him. Here,” Dean handed Nick his card. “Just have him call me.” Dean turned to leave before he put his foot in his mouth
“Yeah, that’s probably smart. Again, just see what you can find out about him. We gotta be sure we didn’t miss anything.”
Four months went by and Dean was a hurricane of pent up energy and self-doubt. He’d killed an additional 5 people in that time - higher than his normal kill rate for an entire year - and not one of them calmed him down the way they used to. He tortured a redhead for hours before he finally killed her. Kept a blonde haired little twink for a week until he was too used up to even be worth fucking anymore, and then killed him quickly. The other three were various shades of in the middle - dark haired, light haired, green eyes and brown, male, female, large and small. He’d gone back to his method of random selection and the random selection was bullshit. All he ever saw were angelic blue eyes. He saw those eyes when he killed, when he came... when he slept. He heard Cas’ voice in his head with all the others.
Dean felt like an idiot in high school.
Cas huffed a laugh and reached over to steal some of that candy. “See? We make an…
Dean held Cas and stayed buried inside of him as his cock softened. “Did you learn anything today?”

David visibly clenched, his body automatically responding to the threat. “You’re a fucking psycho!” He started screaming Eric’s name, hoping if he woke up, Eric could somehow get them out of this.
Except Castiel was already a murderer. No, he hadn’t done it yet. But he would have, and finding Dean was probably the only thing that kept him from being murdered himself. “That was dumb. Me moving around furniture wasn’t going to fix anything. I’m a killer.”

heard and as much as he wanted to hold on, he instantly followed Cas. His orgasm felt like it was being punched out of him as he filled up his fist so much it spilled onto his sweats.
“All yours. You’re everything I’ve ever needed, Cas. I’m not goin’ anywhere.” Dean kisses him softly, worried he just said too much.
fucking come in me, angel.”
Cas looked a little scared. “Dean, are you sure this is a good idea?”
Cas rolled his eyes, “Dead or Alive, Dean.
Dean stood there for a moment breathing heavily and taking in the sight of Castiel like this. He realized he
looked up, they locked eyes for a second and it felt...
Cas smiled when his back hit the wall and he parted his lips for Dean to deepen the kiss. It was easy in moments like this to feel... normal? Not that Dean or Castiel knew anything
Dean started the car and looked over at Cas, smirking as his eyes traveled over him. “You’re a mess.” He slowly licked his lip and admired what a
Dean flipped his legs over the side of the bed and gripped the edge of the mattress, studying Cas. “Look, am I curious? Yeah. Do I expect you to tell me, or think I even deserve an explanation? No. So if you wanna talk about it, I’m all ears, but I’m sure as hell not gonna force you to tell me somethin’ you’re not ready to just because she’s being spiteful.”
“Dean... we have to go. Fuck the pie, fuck all of this shit.”
“Yes, I’ll marry you,” Cas says quickly. “Now come in my fucking lungs.” He dives in, sucking hungrily and sloppily to show Dean what he can do, then stills and taps his leg to tell him to take what he wants.
Speechless, all Dean could think to say was, “That’s fucked up.”
Dean's eyes slid back to the road, his brow furrowed slightly.

that." He laughed at his own pun and grabbed his own clothes.
Dean doesn’t know why he’s nervous. Miracle is at their feet and it feels so damn natural he’s able to forget why he’s here. “C’mere.” Dean rolls on his side and Cas spoons him like he belongs there. Both of their hearts are racing but neither make a move for more, both perfectly content with the comfort they’re bringing each other, and soon Dean isn’t nervous anymore. He’s with Cas.
it. It’s with that thought in mind that Cas preps himself and puts on his favorite pair of black lace panties, then cooks dinner in absolutely nothing else. Once the food is ready, he walks around the kitchen aimlessly, pretending to be busy as he waits for Dean to come home.
an alcoholic and I did raise Sammy and as you said, I did fail to help my dad.” Dean paused to run a hand down his face. He couldn’t even believe he was opening himself up to Cas in this way, he’s only told one other person about his childhood before and that was Charlie.
what he was saying no to.
“Sorry brother, thought we had a couple hours.” But Dean wasn’t even listening because before Benny finished, the man riding his cock pushed off of him
Cas nodded, not a trace of doubt on his face. “I know we will. I trust you with my life Dean.” He kissed Dean, slowly at first but it quickly turned heated. Both of them wanting to show the other how much they cared. Needing the other to understand they were ready to go all the way.
“You’re a fucking moron. We all know my dick wouldn’t fit in any panties,”
Dean blushed slightly and cleared his throat. “He’s a very good quarterback.”
“Okay.” Cas’ voice went straight to Dean’s dick, it seemed to deepen with every passing minute. “Set your hand next to the lube, then slowly slide it down your stomach.” He did as told, his hips moving involuntarily. “Lower.”
Cas smiled to himself and slid Dean back further, moaning as he touched the back of his throat. Next time, Cas would make it so Dean couldn’t move his arms at
“It isn’t about that, specifically.”
man before me.” Cas slid the blade down David’s torso, hard enough to sting and cut only slightly.
The man didn’t like the vibe Dean gave off. “You heard wrong. Leave!” He stood tall and walked closer.
The answer to that question was... complicated. On one hand, yes - it reminded Dean of all the ways he’d wanted to break Castiel when they’d met. But
Dean slid his hand up Cas’ back to grip his hair and pulled him in, kissing him deeply. Everything about Cas turned him on, in ways Carmen - and hell, no girl, or anyone else for that matter - ever had. He kept kissing him, slowly laying back until they were tangled together and it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began.
Michael was already almost asleep by the time he got to the end, so he didn’t protest a whole lot as Cas slid out and snuck out into the hallway. Just as he was closing the door, he heard footsteps behind him.
Nick sighed, “He’s about to take a shower so give him a bit.”
Cas pulls off with a satisfied smirk and turns on the radio as he sits back, then straightens his tie. “Drive somewhere we can see the stars and pull over.”
across the parking lot before climbing into Baby and taking a moment to listen to her purr. He doesn’t look at his texts until he parks in his driveway
And so it continued. Eight bodies in six months, seven of which were carved with the cross. Each one resembling Castiel. He’d masturbated with their blood and branded their bodies, he’d let them fight back and drugged them so they wouldn’t. He fucked them willingly and raped them as he killed them, but still. None of them quite filled the void that Cas had left.
“Fuck, okay. Uhh…” Dean slid off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom, coming out a few minutes later with an armful of shit. He gingerly sat down next to Cas, who had rolled on his side and was facing away from him. “Cas, listen. I’m not good at this shit, but let me try, okay?”
let a stranger into his home so easily. Just because someone was naive didn’t mean they deserved to die.
Cas almost said no, but there was something about Dean that made Cas want to tell him. It felt nice to have a personal conversation with someone who looked like they actually gave a shit about what you were saying. They shared stories of shitty ex boyfriends and shared another drink. The conversation flowed beautifully… all the way up until Cas slipped that he was a dom.
Dean Winchester had been on the streets for as long as he could remember. No one gave a shit that his parents died right in front of him; no one noticed the small boy in the corner too scared to even cry when they came to drag the bodies out. He was 7 when it happened. He died in that room too, although he was the only one that knew it. Something inside of him snapped that day, snapped so fucking thoroughly that nothing would ever fix it. Well, nothing but blood, anyway.
Dean laughed so hard he dropped his phone and then reread it four more times, he had nothing.
on his face like I've made the wrong one — but he never offers any input of his own.”
He eventually stood, setting his empty glass down on the counter and quickly brushing the glass clean. He made his way toward the jukebox, stopping right behind the man long enough to grip his hip hard and growl into his ear from behind.
“Cas, seatbelt.” Dean looked back and saw Cas’ hip peeking out from under his shirt, making him shiver.
Cas was under no impression Dean would ever want a relationship with him aside from a one night stand and Cas could live with that, he’s never had an actual relationship anyway. But to think Dean may never even want to hook up worried him, the sexual tension between them was distracting, they
“Shit. Do you know how relieved I am? Was convinced you would flip and never talk to me again or some shit.”
Dean just smiles and begrudgingly slides on the rubber, adding some lube to his cock and then stroking Cas’. “Every inch of you is fucking beautiful.”
It registered to Dean that Cas seemed to really enjoy having his hair pulled, so he tugged again, fucking up into Cas' mouth. The edging from last time was still crystal fucking clear in his mind though, and his body was shaking with the need to let go - he didn't think he could handle it again. "Cas, fuck, I'm gonna come, that mouth is too damn good. Can I - shit, can I come?"
“Ah fuck! Yes... wanted you to fuck me for so long. Next time, you better fuck me as soon as I walk in.” He groaned again as Dean moved his finger, and his cock twitched.
Dean was the first to pull away to catch his breath, and when he pressed their foreheads together, he huffed a laugh. “Why are we waiting again?”
“Cas you need to take a walk, go on now! I’ll clean this shit.” Benny slammed some more paper towels into Cas’ bleeding hand and shoved him out of the kitchen. Unwanted hands on his shoulders cut through the last of Cas’ resolve.
He meets her eyes and she bites her lip and leans in to kiss him quickly. “Fine. I’ll be patient.”
While Dean showered, Cas looked around again and came across Dean’s journal. He smiled, one day, he would make the time to sit and read the whole thing. But for right now, he needed to check out this article. He picked up the paper to read what his parents said about him; he hadn’t looked at it close enough yesterday before his freak out.
in Hell.
Cas draped himself over Dean, wrapping his broad hand around Dean’s neck and pulling him into a kiss as he thrust in, deep and brutal. Dean’s body was jerking each time, making it hard to hold that kiss and Cas eventually gave up, biting his shoulder instead.
“Hey, you.” He pulled Cas into a kiss as he slid the key in the lock. “Miss me?”
was almost even better. He searched his mind for something to say back, but what
he wasn’t sure when he’d be ready to talk to Nick. But Nick was going to have to be the one to extend the olive branch, he was the older brother, and that came with certain responsibilities. At least in Dean’s mind.
“Keg is fine. Orange cup, please.” Cas watched him and licked his plump lips.
“Come on, Cas. I can take it.” Dean pushed back again with a growl of his own. It took everything to let it go and settle for a quick slap on the ass, but Cas could instantly tell Dean loved it.
“Hey, Cas.”
nervous?”
Lisa rolls her eyes and fixes her wig. “Charlie ships her with Bruce, so…”
The boys are apart, but they both realize something very important.
Cas shrugged. “I’m interested in it. I just love your cock so much I haven’t thought about it much. I used to top Alec from the coffee shop.” Cas admitted, not sure if it would upset Dean.
Cas took a step back and looked Dean in the eyes. “Say that again?” He whispered, his cock growing between them.
The contact makes him flinch, but the compliments help him recover, and Dean finds himself pushing down to search for more. “All yours... stuck with me forever now, Cas.”
was why he kept coming back... why he couldn’t leave Cas alone. He’d seen this in his mind’s eye and knew nothing else would ever come close. He nodded once, ignoring the desperate squeals from the man face down on the floor. “You said he fucked you dry and discarded you when you bled? Maybe it’s time he learns how such a thing feels to someone that ain’t actually askin’ for it.” Dean was already hard in his jeans, his cock pressing painfully into the denim. “What’s his name, anyway? God himself knows I ain’t callin’ him
Within two hours, Cas had locked himself in the room, pacing the small quarters. He didn’t want Dean to see him this way but he also knew he couldn’t hide in here forever. Dean made him eat a bland breakfast after his shower and he could already imagine it coming back up when the real withdrawal started.

Castiel already knew.
The first time he hunted a victim after Cas, he knew exactly what he was looking for. Roughly six feet tall, dark hair, blue eyes. Bratty, if possible, but that was getting almost too specific. He’d settled for a guy about 5’10” with eyes so dull they were almost grey... but at least the hair and build were right. He hadn’t bothered with the pretense of consent with this one. It was quick and dirty once the man figured out what Dean was going to do to him.
“Is your

“Uh, yeah… I just had a question. No big deal.”
Cas caved and sat down with a sigh, “I’m not going to die Nick, I only take enough to feel normal throughout the day. I’ll start tapering off.” He didn’t know why he was trying to comfort Nick but he felt his brother needed it, even if it was a lie.
He blushes even harder and nods. “Yes, though I obviously prefer when it’s

bodies washing over his hands. “We take them fucking both. Get in the fucking car.”
Boy, was he wrong.
He decided to pretend like he never talked to Carmen about it or looked through her messages, just to see what Cas would say.
“I don’t think I ever did. I know I didn’t tell you right away or... realize it right away, but I never felt like you’d judge me or that I couldn’t be honest.”
“Mornin’.” Dean looks over his shoulder and chuckles. “What’d the pan do to you?”

Cas stood up and walked over, kissing Dean again. “Want you so bad.” Cas palmed himself, he didn’t understand why his cock was so fucking hard. “Fucking hurts.” He had forgotten what Dean asked him, he
Cas sat up and climbed off. “Roll over.”
“Dean, I —” Cas loses words again, he's not used to guys with hands as good as their cocks — but Dean’s incredible, and Cas can't handle it. He grunts, moving faster and slamming down harder, spreading his arms to loop around the headrests for leverage. “Gonna come.”
Dean let out a satisfied groan, knowing damn well he wasn’t going to come just from getting fucked, but just maybe he
. “Like what you see?”
“I do love door number two now.” Cas joked. “Okay, Okay, his name is Jesse. He just moved here to take care of his grandmother but she passed away last week. He isn’t sure what he’s going to do because he just got this job and has to clean out her whole house alone. Should I go back and offer my services to see if he’s a good toy?”
