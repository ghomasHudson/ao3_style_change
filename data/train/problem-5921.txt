He can catch glimpses of that man, some days; the way Cap stands when he barks an order, or the way he can churn out some polished, heartfelt speech at the drop of a hat, like some corny monologue he’d practised in the mirror for weeks. But other days there’s just Steve; the dork who smudges graphite all over his face when he’s caught up in a sketch, who forgets his size enough to knock into things and people when he’s tired. Steve flushes when he’s teased about women, and he flushes when he’s teased about men, and apparently he kisses like he’s drowning, like the desperation of the ice is still trapped between his teeth. Steve brings Tony coffee and he takes away Tony’s alcohol. Steve’s a card shark, but he can’t lie to save his life. Steve believes in God, and his country, and America. Steve’s learning not to trust his government. And then there’s the anger; bright red flashes of it, leaping up and burning into Tony like a brand. There’s triumph, there, knowing he’s knocked Captain America off balance. Daddy Never Loved Me means Tony never did learn to distinguish between positive attention and any attention at all. He’s self-aware enough, at least, to know that much.
Natasha snickers, and Tony enjoys the quiet pleasure of her company for a few minutes, sipping his cocoa. Sunlight begins to filter through the window, blue grey and faint.
When he pulls back, Steve looks dazed, eyes half-lidded and dark.
“I swear,” he says, and Tony freezes, shock coursing through him as surely as if he’d touched his tongue to a battery, “to aid you to my ability in this matter. You have my word. Is that what you wish to hear?”
“This is what talk therapy is for, Captain,” the professor says. His voice is gentle, and Steve glances at his hands folded in his lap and then back up to catch Xavier’s small smile: his kind, crinkled eyes.
Peggy hadn’t wanted anyone to take care of her, but that isn’t the kind of person Tony is at all. He’s independent, sure, but also…neglected, in some kind of essential way. He needs care, in a way that Peggy hadn’t ever needed care. Steve has thought about it a lot—what is it that makes them perfect for each other? Tony is strong, in exactly the ways that Steve loves. He’s brilliant, and beautiful, and so clever. He’s hurt, and deserves kindness. He’s had so little kindness in his life. If love is patience, then Steve can be patient for Tony. He’d wait for another hundred years, it if meant Tony would be waiting for him with that small, vulnerable smile that Steve has only been graced with a handful of times but strives desperately for. He’d sink another plane, fight another war. He’d kill another hundred men. The way Steve feels about Tony is too big. It feels biblical. It feels like coming apart at the seams. And if that isn’t love, what is?
“Please, just let me,” Steve says, and Tony blinks at him, because that was a command. That was a command, and it’s pretty damn open-ended.
Natasha’s mouth twitched, just the barest corner of her mouth. It was what Steve liked to think of as her Tony smile, the one that appeared on her face only when she was trying to hide her amusement at his antics because she didn’t want to encourage him.
Tony whimpers. He’ll cop to it. He totally, 100% whimpers at the way Steve sounds half-drunk just talking about how hot his reactions to being blown halfway up a wall were.
Chapter title is from E. E. Cummings,
“Why didn’t you and Cap ever...” Tony stills, unnatural and silent. Peter flips his fork over his knuckles in a small display of acrobatics that is deeply, uniquely Spiderman. He takes a deep breath, tries again. “I mean, after, when things had been fixed up, and Agent 13 and him had broken up, a lot of us thought, maybe.”
“Don’t do that martyr shit. I know it’s your favourite thing, but…”
“No, father.”
Steve looks down at his hands folded in his lap. “It’s not so easy, father.” He knows he sounds like he’s making excuses, but he can’t help it. He doesn’t know what else to do. “I haven’t...he hasn’t expressed wanting a claim. We don’t even touch each other. It’s...” Steve thinks about the absolute drugging haze that even the barest touch from Tony ignites in him. The way his eyes light up when he’s working on something and makes a break through. The way his body sways to the music when he’s in a groove and has forgotten Steve is in the room. He feels a little like he might cry. “All I want is to be good to him, but I don’t know how.”
He imagined Captain America would be firm with him. (Hah.) A strong, but silent kind of man, gentle until he wasn’t. He’d never force Tony, no, never ask him for more than he knew how to give, never want what Tony didn’t want. He’d tried to imagine him as forceful, all that muscle pressing up on him, pressing into him, but somehow he never quite could do it. Captain America would be smooth, and a little sly, he’d thought. He’d be handsome, and kind, and perfect.
“JARVIS?” Tony snaps, pulling up and aiming his repulsors at the ground. He can’t see anything; his display is still on the fritz. “Rhodey?”
Steve shook his head, breathing slow. As he watched, Tony’s hand crept in, fingers closing over Steve’s fisted hands.
“There are too many sexual puns I could make. I’m spoiled for choice,” Tony deadpans.
Peter folds his arms over his chest and looks down at Tony. “You know, you owe me.”
“Okay, Tony,” Steve sighed. He pressed his jaw back into Tony’s nuzzling. “Will you be home later?”
He rubs his hands over his closed eyes. “What time is it?”
“Who is this asset?” Secretary Ross asks, and Tony rolls his eyes.
“We can have some people put together a playlist!”
“He’s smart, crazier than a bag of cats with a generous helping of daddy issues, and a mass murderer with a significant personal body count but, more importantly, an
Tony considers this for a moment, blowing into his mug. He tips his head to the side. “I think he is, too.”
“I’ll wait for Stephen.”
“Feel my pulse,” Tony tells him, and Steve reaches up, putting two fingers on the side of Tony’s neck. “Watching this gets me hot. Thinking about you holding me down, how strong-”
“I don’t understand. Shall I run a full-body scan?”
“That’s how you want it,” Tony agreed, a wicked smile overtaking his mouth, and Steve licked at it, licked his mouth open until Tony was fucking his mouth with his tongue. He matched his thrusts, grinding steadily into Steve, his knot dragging hot against Steve’s rim as he shifted with intent this time. It was enough to make Steve moan, his head spinning.
“Can we not do both?”
“What are you saying?” he whispers.
“Of course,” Steve said, nodding. He wanted to spend the next few days wrapped up in Tony in the safety of their room, outfitted with all of the accoutrements that Steve was used to having in one of his heats.
offer to help, but I rather like watching you suffer.”
“And wet leaves in autumn,” Tony repeated, wondering, and Steve pulled his hand back because that’s…it was too much. Tony wasn’t his. He wasn’t interested. He was off-limits. He was a friend.
“It was a bluff, you asshole,” Clint mutters, pulling an apple out of the fruit bowl. He lays down the cutting board and pulls a knife out of the block. “I’ll cut, you lay.”
"Tony Stark yes, Iron Man no." Tony smiles wryly. "Loki kissed me."
“They’re in space,” Clint says, mouth full of dumplings. Natasha spears him with a scathing look. “What? Phil said so. And they’re so fuckin’ weird, Nat, come on.”
“I shouldn’t have pushed,” he admits. A small smile steals over his face. “I never learn, with you.”
, it’s-
Thor eyes him with a sour twist burgeoning on his face. “I have apologised much for my misplaced ire. I recognise that you were as much player to my brother’s machinations as you were engineer of them.”
“Certainly not.”
“Has anyone ever told you you’re annoyingly observant?” Tony asks him.
“I don’t really think I agree with your metaphor, Professor.” Steve rubs a hand over his face. “What does this mean? Am I clear for the field?”
As soon as he’s gone, pain curls into Tony’s chest like a knife. Has to take shallow breaths. It hurts. It hurts so fucking badly.
Steve stares at it, his mouth dropping open a little. He licks his lips. “Is that…?”
“You’d skip your run for me?” Tony asks, strangely touched by the implication.
Steve knows he’s being goaded. Tony can tell, by the way his expression shifts into exasperation. But he rubs a hand over his head, sucks in a breath, and asks: “Would you mind talking to me about what being intersex means to you?”
“What are
“Breakfast,” Tony rasped, and Steve glanced back over his shoulder to watch him retreat, putting the kitchen island between them again. “I need you nourished.”
“Didn’t you know, Steve? Most OTA trans folks don’t look this good unless they start HRT before puberty, unless they know an amazing plastic surgeon.” He grinned, fierce and mirthless. “Still, there are things that can’t be beat. My voice, for one. Although I did need a surgeon to enhance the knot. God forbid a Stark alpha have a small knot.”
“Where is he?” he asks, staring at the crack under the door. There’s no light peeking out, just the dark seam between wood and wood.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Bruce piped in, words weighted in a way that Steve knew was referring to Tony’s specific biological circumstances. Steve squeezed his eyes shut, cursed quietly. “I think I’ll have to do it. As Bruce, I mean. As a beta, I’ll be the least likely to be…affected.”
“Before I had the serum, I had a complicated relationship to being an alpha,” Steve says, slowly. “I was glad, most of the time, but it was also something to be bullied over. That I didn’t fit the typical ideal of what an alpha was supposed to be. My presentation was something my ma and I were afraid of when I was a kid. A shadow hanging over us. If I was sick as I was and also an omega, if my ma had to try to find a place for me to spend my heats, or try to fix up our rickety apartment to keep out some stranger from the street… She couldn’t stay home with me. She had to work. It was a relief, to present as an alpha. One less thing to worry about. And then sometimes I thought, least I had that, even if I was sick. But I would’ve been alright, being a beta. I’d hoped I’d be a beta.”
“Yeah, well, pickings are slim right now, y’know, with half of Manhattan in shambles-”
“Because you think I’m a beautiful, pragmatic genius,” Tony says, equal parts smug and terrified, and then he kisses him, because he can’t think of what else to do.
You don't know how lucky you are
“Wouldn’t have to if you’d fuck me,” he managed, gasping as Tony pushed another finger inside. “
Tony nodded, took a deep death, and pushed the door open. The wind fought the wood every inch, keening wildly, but he had to get back out into the storm.
“You’ve ruined me,” Tony tells him seriously, and Steve’s face softens. He steps into the tub and sinks into the water, his eyes dancing.
“What do we do, J?”
By the time Pepper appears in the doorway, Steve is rinsing his mouth out with water, trying to wash the taste of vomit from it. Steve spits and wipes his mouth a third time, glancing up into the mirror to see Pepper’s grim face. She holds a glass of milk in one perfectly manicured hand, and Steve knows, this woman could end him. She would burn the world, just for Tony Stark.
“Natasha,
The professor smiles. “I had a friend––a Jewish, German mutant––who survived the war,” he says. Steve thinks he knows this story, and so he’s unsurprised to see Xavier’s eyes flickering with something sad, something complicated and unbearable and kind. “He was taken by the Reich, used in their experiments. They did…terrible things to him. Things no child should have to suffer.”
“Oh, boy.” Steve scrubs a hand over his face. “We had a good talk, about…secrets. Boundaries. I think we’ve crossed a bridge.”
“Shall I make a list of pros and cons?”
washed this?” Steve asked, a sinking feeling building in his chest even as a grin began to build on his face.
, Steve realises, Tony’s last hope. He’s sure both of them know it to be so. He wonders, maybe, if Tony was waiting for this. If that knowledge is what stayed his hand, stopped him from calling in the one person he always turns to when his indomitable brain finally hits a wall it cannot break.
or lose)good true
Steve looks frantic. Tony can feel Steve’s pulse, the sweat beading against his skin. “Hold me down,” he whispers, barely loud enough to hear.
“I’m okay,” Tony mouths sotto voce, and Natasha nods once. “Come on. Let’s get this over with.”

"He kissed me."
“It’s my scent, isn’t it?” Tony asks, and Steve lets out the tiniest groan because he
Steve in this series. I was trying to show that this whole time Steve is trying really hard to correct his own false assumptions, but Tony is wholly in denial about being Sight Bonded and who Steve is because he doesn’t
Oh, Tony knows he’s going to pay for that favour later. He stands up, ignoring the clamour that ignites, and fixes Coulson with a look. “Get your house in order, Agent.”
Chapter title from Warsan Shire's
“Your dinner is still hot,” JARVIS prompts, and that’s just not playing fair. “Shall I have DUM-E fetch the plate?”
Thor clapped a hand on his shoulder, a broad smile taking his face. “Go and get your alpha, Steve.”
“Sometime,” Tony said, and then he was reaching for Rogers’ vest, shoving it off him until it pooled on the ground.
Steve has never been very good at being afraid, or being patient, or knowing when to quit. So he sits in the Stark mansion, and he catalogues and annotates every damn item in the conference room, each with its tiny white sticker barcode or tag. And then, he sends Pepper Potts a note about charity auction procedure in the brand new world.
“Yes.”
What he knows is that he’s woken by a gentle tug. When he opens his eyes, the bed is empty, and Tony is moving around in the bathroom. The sun slants bright over the bed.
He settles for pulling Tony down into his chest and pressing his mouth to the dark hair above his ear. He hugs him as tightly as he can without hurting him.
“I suspected as much,” he says, clapping his hands together. Then he whirls, rounding on Cap and pushing into his space. “What
“Huh?” Steve turns, expression adorably confused. “Won’t that mess up the tub?”
Steve shook his head. “Give me an estimate.”
Steve could barely breathe with how full his mouth and throat were, but he was prepared for this, and it was so good. His arousal was almost blinding, vision blurring as he tried to concentrate on keeping his jaw as wide as he could get it, protecting Tony from his teeth, the smell of Tony all around him. He wondered idly if he could come untouched, just from this.
“And what does that look like, for you?” Pepper asks. Steve stares at her, brows furrowing. He isn’t sure he understands the question, and after a moment, her smile turns pitying. “I am glad that you’re back safe, Steve.”
Steve is sick of this shit.
“It’s Cap,” Tony says, bemused. Natasha just shakes her head, pressing her lips together in a mirthless line. She turns her head, eyes staring uncannily at the glass, as if she can pinpoint exactly where Steve might be standing.
As always, your comments and cheering-on are what get me through the dead spots, so please continue to leave them! As always, I’m more than happy to hear thoughts/discuss meta with you. This was a longer chapter than I expected because I feel like I’m rushing to the good parts, now. Hold on, folks; it’s gonna be a bumpy ride to paradiso.
His third orgasm felt like a tidal wave: a low, thundering rush that built until he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see, didn’t know which way was up. He couldn’t feel anything but the pleasure, waves of it breaking over him as he shook, as he could only lie there and take it. He knew he was speaking, could feel the roughness in his throat as he cried out, could feel Tony’s answer vibrating against him, but it felt like minutes before he could even tell up from down, let alone parse language.
Steve winces and glances away. “I’m sorry,” he mutters. “I’m a jerk.”
“Why?” Tony asks her, frowning, and Natasha tilts her head and offers him a sad smile.
“You’re an upstart brat.”
“Aaaaaand I’m an asshole,” Tony says, drumming his fingers on the worktop. He flicks the holodisplay footage away with nimble fingers.
“They are, technically, doves,” he explains. Peter, predictably, refuses this request. Only the small smile that flickers concurrently over Tony and Strange’s faces hints to Steve that it might have been a joke.
He leans down to suck a mark in the hollow between Tony’s left ear and the straining tendon beneath it, and Tony goes utterly limp under his mouth.
Later, after Tony had someone bring them some fatty, carb-filled takeout, after he’d given Steve yet another set of orgasms, after they’d laid together in the jacuzzi and spoke quietly to each other about the future, Tony finally suggested they leave the heat room.
“We thought to retrieve Barnes,” Thor says, and Steve’s entire body snaps to attention at that. “It should have been simple.”
It is a temporary stopgap, but it is all he has until he can speak the words he means to say with his mouth.
Steve thinks. He doesn’t know what. Anything, to bridge the gap between them. He doesn’t think he could quite stomach an apology, but something, anything to smooth over the sharp edges of the horrible things he and Stark snarled at each other on the helicarrier. Before Stark flew a nuke into a wormhole and Steve thought,
Peter blinks, poleaxed. It’s a reaction that Steve is deeply grateful for, because he doesn’t know what else to do with his body, his hands, as he listens to the words coming out of Tony’s mouth: one nightmare after another, endless, like a magician’s colourful scarf. “Okay, aside from that horrifying two-sentence persuasive essay on why Title IX is an important piece of legislation-”
“Tony,” he says. He looks miserable, and Tony considers him for a moment, head tilted, fingers pressed to the corner of his mouth. “I…”
“Would you?” Tony rasps, one foot slipping out to hook around Loki’s ankle. Loki watches him, slim and predatory as a snake. “You might help an enemy if you wanted something.”
,” he mouths.
Bruce doesn’t deny it. “You need to learn to ask for what you want. Just ask. I suspect that’s most of the problem you’re having with Steve.”
“I, uh. I thought we could talk,” he says. Pepper eyes the bouquet, then him, tilting her head to the side in impassive consideration. “Um. These are for you.”
Steve, who has been watching curiously over her shoulder the whole time, bites back a grin.
“Tell me again, when the spell is removed,” he says, and Tony rolls his eyes. Then he stills, and takes an unsteady breath. A terrible suspicion is building, founded on the defeated, hunched posture Steve had been exhibiting when they left him.
"You staying at the tower?"
“Where do you expect us to put them in the meantime, if Pleasant Hill is to be terminated?” Secretary Ross asks, looking thunderous.
With your one wild and precious life?
“Thank you,” he says. “I appreciate that you were looking out for me, really.”
“Please,” he begged, and Tony chuckled against his throat.
“Tell that to my fucking hypothalamus.”
Eventually, Steve subsides with a huff, bowing his head. He looks at Tony from up between his lashes. “I’m listening,” he says, and Tony smiles at him.
“Because you’re an idiot who blames himself for Steve’s death.” Bucky snorts. “The last one. Although probably this one, too.”
“I need you to be okay.”
Tony nods once as the elevator dings, stepping out onto grey concrete. The floor echoes with the sound of Tony’s crisp Italian leather shoes, and Steve slants a sideways glance at him, studying his movements.
“Perfect,” Tony says, nodding. “Then they can both come up.”
, and
“I don’t know, Steve. Could be a few days. Could be a few weeks.”
Steve’s already in the workshop when he gets there. He’s sitting on the sofa, sketching presumably, but he stiffens when Tony walks in. His eyes flicker up to Tony’s face before they dip back down to the page in front of him.
“Well, it’s working,” Steve says, and Tony chuckles.
Hulk grumbles. “Hulk not smart. Not good talk. Star Man ask Banner why fight.” He turns and frowns down at Steve, his wide brow wrinkling like thick leather. “Ask.”
“Mmm.”
“That’s why I need you to keep us apart.”
Steve opens his eyes.
The door slid open with a low hydraulic hiss, and Steve swayed on his feet, catching himself on the door jamb. The scent was enough to make him whine, involuntary, the smell of sex and bond pheromones, of
“We don’t know,” Bruce replied absently. He slid a document over to Steve’s screen. “Thoughts?”
“Yes,” Steve says simply, and Tony bites back a grin, a surge of warmth spilling into his chest and stomach. “I-
“And I don’t want to box you in again,” Steve continues. He has the grace to look sheepish, at the very least. “I don’t…I’m sorry I didn’t notice. You never told me. I know, with- I mean. It makes sense. We’ve both read each other’s files. But. I’m sorry. I only figured that out recently.”
“So, you opened Cap’s package,” Rhodey prompts. “And then?”
“Sounds lonely,” Franklin tells him seriously.
“I-” Tony croaked, and the absolutely delicious way his stomach clenched as he leaned up to let Steve pull his shirt off had Steve’s head spinning with want. He leaned down, lining Tony’s abs with his tongue, pressing between the swells of muscle and licking all the salt from his skin. “
“When I was young,” Steve says, “I thought I’d die before I Bonded.”
“Sure, Tony,” Steve says, and Tony swallows.
Steve felt like he was going to lose his fucking mind.
Eventually, Steve wasn’t even able to get hard anymore, not that that had ever stopped Tony before. Time stretched out, narrowed down to the feel of Tony slipping inside of him, his mouth marking Steve, his fingers scratching through his hair.
The expression that graces Steve’s face when he opens his eyes is fragile. It’s delicate enough that Tony reaches out a hand to touch the edge of one sharp cheekbone, and the way Steve melts into the touch is like magic. It feels like all the pressure in the room goes out in the rush of Steve’s relieved exhale, and Tony just stands there, waits for it to happen.
Natasha nodded. “We spent all morning fighting. I think you should take a break.” She studied Steve’s expression. “Tony will be home, soon. They’re putting him in the Tank.”
There’s a moment of silence in the workshop as they all process this, the only sound Dummy whirring in the corner as he tries to tidy up. Bruce clears his throat.
JARVIS wisely stays silent. Eventually, Tony pulls himself up and puts on grease-stained jeans and a long sleeve cotton shirt, finishing with a pair of sneakers that have seen better days. Fuck the investors and their stuffy expectations, he decides, R&D loves him and they’re his people and he needs to blow some shit up. He tops it off with a Guns N’ Roses t-shirt, just because.
The gentleness in his tone makes Tony’s chest ache fiercely. He wants nothing more than to curl up in JARVIS’ metaphorical arms and sleep until all of this is over.
“I know you love me,” Steve snapped, “weren’t you listening?”
“Stark, you and your allies are weak, your armour damaged. I have seen Moonstone cut through steel with a single bolt. You should take the time to rest and regroup, and strike before dawn while their soldiers sleep. Your captain is strong; he can endure a little pain while you ensure your victory.”
Tony has only the vaguest recollection of this.
Tony was the only exception to the rule. He tended to overwork himself even more than usual post-mission, making sure all of his tech was fixed up, running battle footage back and doing a play-by-play analysis, always looking six steps ahead. Usually it was Steve’s job to grab him and pull him out of his head, drag him upstairs into the tumble of warm bodies and food that gathered in the common space after a hard day. If that didn’t work, he would bring Tony some food and work over the footage with him. It was hard work, always, but they were good memories. Tony always welcomed his company with open arms.
, Steve wants to say, but he doesn’t. Instead he licks the powdered sugar from his fingers, eyes meeting Tony’s with a challenge. Tony, to his credit, just raises an eyebrow at him.
Steve blinks, then tilts his head up, looking for the security camera. He knows JARVIS isn’t human, but it still only seems polite to look him in the eye while they’re talking. “Uh. Is everything alright?”
“I cannot contract human diseases,” Loki points out, and Tony considers this for a moment. “You have my word.”
“We’ll do a blood test tomorrow morning, make sure everything checks out. Honestly, you’re fine now, but I’d like to give it another injection just to be safe.” Bruce let out a huff of laughter, taking off his glasses and polishing them in his shirt. It was a nervous habit, betraying how worried he’d been for Tony throughout the whole process. Steve maybe felt a little bad. Maybe.  “We’re lucky that you’ve been on hormones and blockers for as long as you have, Tony. Trying to get your body to produce omega hormone after only ever producing it once in your life…it’s a slower process than it would have been for a lot of other OTA individuals. Mostly the issue was with not having enough alpha hormone in your bloodstream.”
“So,” Happy says, “wanna talk about it?”
“Sounds easy, when you put it like that,” he mutters, stuffing his hands in his pockets. He’s only a little bit bitter.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath, because he knows immediately that was way, way too far. It was too far, and Steve looks like Tony’s cut him open straight down the middle. Horrifyingly, he looks like he might cry, and Tony reaches out a shaking hand, holding it up in a gesture of peace. Steve’s eyes are wide and so, so blue, and Tony wants to hold him, but he can’t. He can’t trust himself right now.
“I need your informed consent, Steve.”
A noise at the door of Reed’s lab makes him turn. There is a particular quality of sound when someone is trying not to be heard when they walk and doing a bad job of it. Anywhere else he might be worried, but Steve knows who lives in this building. He wanders over towards the door.
The moment stretches out, slow and horrible, taffy-thick. It’s worse than anything Tony could have possibly imagined. Steve’s expression closes off the longer the silence drags on, until all of the tension that had bled out of him during the scenting is right back where it started. He’s stiff as a board as he retreats to pick up his paints and brushes, his little cup of solvent, his rag.
“Stark.”
Bruce stares, says nothing.
Steve sucks in a breath.
"Just, enough, Rogers. I changed my mind, reset on the morning, pretend I never said anything to you, okay?" Tony looks hunted and exhausted all at once, and Steve stares at him for a long moment, tracing the familiar shapes of his face, the well-worn laugh lines and the bluish skin beneath his eyes. He looks fragile, and all too human.
Steve shrugged, turning around to the sink and washing the container out by hand. He put both the takeout container and the spoon in the dishwasher to dry.
“Hey,” Steve says, laughing despite himself, and Tony spares him a scathing grin.
“I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” Tony mutters, increasing his pace. Rhodey jogs up alongside him.
“What I said upset you,” the professor observes, sounding surprised. “Can I ask why?”
“Is that what we’re calling the situation with Ross?” Tony asks wryly.
Pepper sighs audibly behind him, and Tony cracks a capricious smile. “Surprise me, then.”
They stood together at the edge of the landing pad, Thor putting his arms around the two assassins and dragging them under the broad protection of his body. Bruce stood a little off from the group, separated by a bare four inches or so, but they were all staring rapt as Tony flew, twisting through the air like an acrobat.
“I do not know what it is that Loki has done that has you so pleased,” Thor says, and Tony jumps about half a foot in the air at the sound of him. He’d entirely forgotten Thor was even there. “However, I will say that I have known since we were but children to never underestimate my brother’s machinations. It seems you still have yet to learn this lesson.”
Franklin wrinkles his nose. “Bloody clothes. They were probably nice before, but now they’re pretty icky.”
“Not like you sleep,” Steve counters. But he turns the little disc over, putting a gentle curve in it to match the shape of his shield, and making sure the bottom of it is nice and smooth. “I almost got it last time.”
“What’s up?”
“Let us be honest, hmm son? You came here for a purpose.”
Enjoy!
“You’ll see,” Tony says, happy crow's feet at the corners of his eyes, and Steve reaches a hand out without thinking, brushing a thumb against his cheekbone. Tony’s eyes widen, and Steve coughs and pulls his hand away.
“No, it hasn’t,” JARVIS agrees ruefully, helpfully opening the doors for him before he even has to call for the car. Tony flashes a grin and steps inside.
Natasha grins at that, vicious, all teeth. “Oh, I think that’s progressing quite well,” she says, her voice a terrifying purr. “You have him whipped, Cassanova. Keep it up and we may have to add him to the roster.”
“If the U.N. comes up with sanctions that the Avengers agree to, will congress let that agreement stand?” Hill asks, and Tony turns to look at her. Her head is tilted to the side, expression unreadable as she surveys the table.
Tony nods sympathetically, then lets out a quiet noise of triumph. He's briefly distracted by a microhinge. "Howard was always gone, too," Tony says, frowning at the delicate piece of machinery that is absolutely refusing to cooperate with him. "Missed a lot of birthdays. Ugh, come on, you're disappointing. You had
"I'll drop you off outside, okay? Someone can meet us at the door to grab your luggage. I'll be fine."
The rush of the world around him feels longer this time. He has just long enough to be terrified that something went wrong, that he’s stuck, before he is spat back out somewhere he’s never been before.
“Whatever,” Clint muttered, stalking off to poke at his bow. Natasha exhaled in a quiet huff, then put her mask on and followed him. Steve watched as she cuffed him on the back of the head.
“Then that’s our next step,” Steve says, nodding. “Now, it’s bedtime. You look like a wreck, Stark.”
“I think you know my answer.”
Tony took a moment in the shelter of a small mining shack, trying to get his head on straight. He didn’t come out here because he was the best horse handler, or a tracker. He’d come out because he was the smartest man in Timely if he could manage to keep sober for five minutes, and there had to be a smart way to bring the sheriff home. He’d come out here because the town was too yellow-bellied to come out in the snow and look for a man who’d saved them all three, more like fifteen times over. He was not out here because of Steve’s pastoral, hearty cooking, or the way his hair looked in the firelight slick with sweat, or the way his mouth could twist into a dirtier grin than the good, Lord-afearing sheriff had any right to. He wasn’t.
“I’m glad,” he tells him, and Steve smiles at him. It’s brilliant. “I went to church a few times as a kid, mostly for holidays. Easter, Christmas. My mother always liked St. Vincent. Beautiful, stately, but not as crowded as some of the other places.”
I apologise in advance for the limited Loki in this chapter. He is off doing Very Important Plot Things, which you will find out about very soon. But hey, here's a treat for those of you who've been waiting for *checks* uh, like 100k words to find out what's the deal with Bucky in this fic!
“I want another piece,” Steve drawls, low, and Tony near about swallows his tongue.
“Louder.”
“God, you have a migraine, don’t you?” Steve asks. His fingers skitter over Tony’s hipbones, the bluish glow of the nano-housing in his chest lending a strange, pallid cast to his angular face.
“You’re…all my life, I heard all these stories about you. The man you were, and the man I should try to be. And I thought it was bullshit. Nostalgia, rose-tinted glasses, whatever. And then when I met you, I mean. Hey, fault’s mutual, but you were kind of an asshole, which is because you were going through some shit so, whatever. I could have been less…me. Maybe.” Steve's mouth twists into a moue. He shakes his head. “But you’re actually just a really awkward sweetheart, aren’t you? You’ve got a soft, gooey centre under all that muscle.”
Steve pulls away, embarrassed. Tony grins at him. "Debrief later. First we help with clean-up. You know the drill."
“Did you ask him to stay?”
Steve laughed, rolling over onto his back and dropping a hand over his eyes. “Okay. Then I’ll just lie here alone, and you can go get cleaned up.”
Steve frowns, clearly hurt, and Tony sighs and scrubs his hands over his face.
“Tell me you love me,” Tony says. It is closer to demand than supplication.
“You’ll be in the way,” she said, which hurt, but that was kindness, too. Steve was good at killing, but he wasn’t built for it on the inside. Not the way the two of them were. “Clint?”
Steve swallowed heavily, heat building low in his body at the smell and feel of his alpha, the possessiveness in Tony’s voice and the bass tones that made him want to lean over the counter and present himself to be taken. He settled for clasping a hand over Tony’s on his stomach, pressing back into his embrace. Tony hummed and pushed back, trapping him.
Movement flickers at the corner of Steve’s eye. Strange, like nothing he’s ever seen before. Like a shadow made living. Then, pain. A sharp sting, like a bug bite. He moves to slap idly at it, but then, it happens: the sharp slice of a blade. It bites into his throat, and he reaches an instinctive hand up, knocking an elbow back into where an assailant wound be, but there’s nothing. There’s nothing there. His hands grasp empty air as something slices his throat open, cuts through his trachea before he can even make a sound. He’s falling back before Tony even notices anything is wrong, and then he’s on his back, and he can feel the blood splashing onto the court next to his head.
, something says inside of him, and well. That’s true, probably. He’s always been curious, always been dedicated to poking things, to twisting them up and taking them apart to see how they work.

“Tony, no-”
He thinks about the book that’s sitting in his duffel bag, although he’s only about thirty pages in. Romanov had recommended it to him when he’d asked about the word “intersex.” After the mission, on the flight back to D.C., he’d looked for the kind of bookstore that was likely to carry information on omega rights and anti-dynamic activism and LGBT+…things, and East City Bookshop had been the first place that had come up. The omega boy manning the till had bright sunset-pink hair and matching nails, and he’d been more than happy to talk to Steve. Steve had ended up walking out with a whole stack of books, including one that was supposed to be a historical examination of consent and/or lack thereof in heat and rut.
“Can I see you?” Steve asks, and Tony moves his hand, letting it fall to the pillow. “Thank you.”
Tony rolls his eyes and takes another gulp of coffee.
“Sweetheart,” Steve said, gently as he could manage it, “I don’t think I’ve got anything to worry about. Some stuffy paper pusher who never sees the light of day couldn’t do this, for one.”
Pepper frowns for a moment before handing him a tablet. “This is what we’ve got from ears on the ground. They’re talking enhanced registration and licensing. That’ll never pass through a democratically-controlled congress, let alone the U.N., so I don’t think we’ve really got to worry about that right now. But if your approval rating goes down, then…”
“If I tie you up, you’re not in charge,” Tony murmurs, and Steve nods. “I don’t have anything that could hold you, really.”
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Steve opened one eye to catch an expression of bemused wonderment overtaking Tony’s face. “Just in case?”
“He’ll die if he gets hit,” Bruce says, conveniently cleaning his glasses in his shirt so he doesn’t have to make eye contact with anyone, “so we’re keeping them as far apart as possible.”
“Where is the good captain?” Thor asks, looking up at the ceiling.
“Sure,” Steve says, easy. “You know what denial is, too, huh?”
“It’s weird,” Tony begins, but Steve just makes a humph-ing noise and lifts one hand in a breezy wave. The other he’s got clamped around the tentacle that’s wrapped up around his torso and over his chest, running his hand up and down it, over and over. Steve reaches back and fists a hand in Tony’s hair, leaning back onto Tony’s shoulder and letting out a throaty groan.
“Yes,” Tony hissed, fucking into him a little more roughly, and ohfuck the stretch was so good. “Come on my knot.”
He turned to Fury, who was watching them all with an unreadable expression. “You were going to say something.”
Steve frowns. “What is going on with you?”
Loki licks his lips, eyes dark, and Tony closes his own and tips his head back because
The crowd laughed, but mostly people seemed to be holding their breath. SI employees were a lot of things, but stupid was generally not one of them. They knew this was going somewhere good.
Tony swallows. “And now?”
“This weapon was used on you,” Loki observes, eyes narrowed. Tony swallows. “You fear it. And yet you chose to let your assassin take it into battle alongside you.”
“Care to share with the class?” Natasha intones, careful. Tony hears:
“I’m gonna fucking end you, Rhodes, you hear me?”
“Yes,” Loki says, that damn note of approval back in his voice again. It’s both patronising and seductive, which Tony is sure is intentional.
Natasha nods, leaning back in her chair. “You know what I was.” Tony nods. “You know what I did.” Tony nods again. “And I suppose it has occurred to you that The Winter Solider and I may have crossed paths, before.”
Steve grits his teeth. “Tony told me the same thing. He doesn’t pull his punches. I know that I messed up, but I don’t see why-”
Steve nods. He stands, fingers pressing once, firmly, against this desk that used to belong to Tony. Loki calls her Tony’s general, Steve knows. It seems a particularly fitting moniker now, more so than he had understood at the outset. He has been consistently outmanoeuvred.
,” he gasps. “I’m almost- fuck,
When he came back, Tony was nosing along his jaw, his hips rocking ever so gently, a low purring rumble echoing in his chest. Steve could feel the sound, the low bass tones sending skitters of pleasure through him where they were connected. He lifted a lazy hand and tangled it in Tony’s hair, tilting his alpha’s head up for a messy kiss.
“I’m going to tell you something,” she says. Her eyes are cold, polished agate.
“Steve, I’m alright,” Tony says, turning around and pulling his shirt over his head. He glances over his shoulder. Steve’s face is sallow, all the blood gone. He’s staring between his bloody fingers and Tony’s spine like he can’t quite believe what he’s seeing. “Amora hit me, the plating pierced my shoulder. It hurts like a bitch but it’s nothing that can’t be fixed. Okay? But the faster you come with me, the faster we can get home and I can get all patched up. So let’s go home, okay?”
“Mind your own business, Hill.”
“Yeah,” he says. And then he squirms, because now that he’s not hard and desperate, this position is a little…exposed, for his tastes. “Uh, can I…come down, now?”
“You asked for it,” Tony reminds him. He hums when his fingers close around a familiar smooth rectangle. “Gotcha.”
“I’ll never forget leaving you when you needed me the most. You in that stupid, dirty room, so far from where you belonged. I was too weak-”
be, like, two months from now. Besides, when would you have had time to go to Colorado?”
Tony blinks, spinning around in his stool a few times. He scrubs his hands over his face, then presses his fingertips to his eyes. He breathes in.
“How old-fashioned,” she quips. “Come into my office, Captain.”
We’re getting to the good stuff soon, y’all. I’ve had a good few chapters written of the resolution to some of these ridiculous plotlines I’ve been running for a long time now. I’m so excited to get to them, because those initial little plot bunnies are the reason I started this story in the first place.
“That…sounds kind of awesome, actually,” Grace Kilcommons says. She works in WebDev, and could not be gayer if she was wrapped in rainbow flags. Tony approves especially of her suspenders. He’s of the opinion that outside of Steve Rogers and butch dykes, suspenders look terrible and hipster and should be banned from the city. “What if we put together a kind of hodgepodge of Irish American contributions to the NYC landscape? The canal, the Empire State Building, the Old Croton Dam…”
Steve sighs, all the fight going out of him all at once. Sympathetic pain echoes through his chest. “One day, that guilt he carries is going to swallow him whole.”
“You’re Captain America,” Howard had said, gesturing at him with an absinthe spoon.
He’s going to build an army. He’s going to make JARVIS a god. He’s going to put a suit of armour around the world. He’s going to protect his stupid, self-sacrificing soulmate from himself. He’s going to save everyone.
“You have a meeting at 3 PM with National Grid,” JARVIS reminds him, and Tony nods.
Steve, who has thought this more than once since his death, cannot protest this. He and Tony have a lot to talk about when he’s alive again.
“Tony-”
“You just don’t like that I hired an old fling,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow. “Beth and I go back. She’s good people, and I needed a new head of security after I gave all the job perks to Pepper. Along with, y’know, the job.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, closing his eyes. “You do.”
If there was anything he had learned from those soldiers, it was that love was the ticket. The main difference between the ones who got better and the ones who ate a bullet, Sam had told him, was that the ones who got better wanted to get better, and when they looked, there were resources there for them; people who cared, a husband, a mother. True, the system was broken, and some of it was luck. There weren't enough beds for every homeless veteran on the street. It was why his share of the Avengers merchandising went to a different veterans' charity each year. But you had to want it, too, Sam had told him. You had to put in the work. Sometimes, without something to work for, it was hard to want it. Many of the Avengers knew that better than most.
Xavier studies him. “That is up to you, Captain. I know that you had a severe flashback at the very mention of Stark’s death this week. Do you think you’re ready to be in the field and watch a building fall on him?”
“Yeah.”
"I think Stark is the best candidate for that, sir," Steve said, and Fury turned to stare at him, one eyebrow raised. He could feel the sharp stares of the rest of the team, but Steve hadn't been willing to lie to the Commandos, and he saw no reason to do it now. Less, even, than back in his day, when omegas couldn't serve. There was no reason to keep this secret.
“I wouldn’t call Marea a little place,” Tony says, but Pepper steamrolls right over him, as always.
“Perhaps you should stop setting me up to get punched for you, asshole.”
“Go back to sleep,” he says, and Tony turns his head, cracking one eye open to look at him. He’s wearing the same clothes, but his hair is wet. He’s taken a small towel from the stack in the bathroom for his hair and is towelling it dry. “Were you talking to JARVIS?”
“Fuck me?” Tony fills in, and Steve winces at the words. “Go for it.”
“Oh, hush, I’m not really here,” Loki hums, but he looks plenty real to Tony as he stalks forward with a small smirk. “Holding back on account of little old me? How…surprisingly sentimental of you, Stark.”
“I love you,” Steve says fervently, and Tony laughs. He peppers kisses all over the side of Steve’s face. “Don’t stop. I think- God, I’m going to come
, he wants to ask,
An incredibly telling thing for him to say, Steve thinks. Or perhaps not. Most of the Avengers have worried about clones at one point or another, although usually Tony had to worry about LMDs or bots. Heck, half the time Tony was the one responsible for them.
“Ah,” Tony says dismissively, tossing his head in a lazy nod. Steve gets the feeling he would have flapped a hand at him if his were free. “We’ve all got regrets. Even you, Rocky, perfect as you are.”
“Well,” Clint says, laying out a lattice over the top of the pie, “nobody’s ever doubted your ambition.” Tony dries his hands in the dishcloth, the soft fabric clutched between his hands as he watches, mesmerised, while Clint pours an agonisingly slow drizzle of liquid over the top of the pie, working in a wide inward spiral until the whole top is covered, the rest of the liquid slipping down through the openings in the crust’s weaved pattern. “You usually can do it, too, which is why your ego so annoying.”
“But they said it isn’t likely,” Kitty reassures him, as though she heard him. “Hank’s just telling you how it is.”
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, baffled. He runs a hand through his hair, tugging absently at the longer fringe in the front. He needs a haircut. “I run. I go out. I draw.”
A familiar yellow and black gloved hand comes up from the floor, an equally familiar device glowing in its palm.
“Tony,” Stephen says, frowning, and what the honest everloving fuck is going on right now, seriously, “I listened to your messages. All of them.”
He doesn’t go to bed, but that’s okay. Brownies beat sleep any day.
"Yeah, I poked him in the nose."
“How should I know?”
Steve placed a gentle hand between Bruce’s shoulder blades. He knew that the man hadn’t even wanted to come, but Bruce, like Steve, was weak to Tony’s charms. As a rule, someone tried to stay with him at all times: not because they didn’t trust Bruce, but because Bruce didn’t trust himself and he felt safer with one of the Avengers. “You’re okay.”
As promised! Happy St. Patrick's Day, even if I'm kinda with Tony on the ugh drunk people and problematic stereotypes train. Enjoy responsibly, etc. etc..
Steve licks his lips and says nothing, mulish, and Tony offers him a grin. He leans down to suck Steve’s earlobe into his mouth, running his tongue around the shell of his ear. Steve shudders under his hands.
He turned to one of the cameras, taking another deep breath. He could smell trees, dirt, the hint of snow. It was all wrong. Tony smelled like the dying leaves of autumn and metal and musk. Everything was all wrong.
Loki’s eyes glitter dangerously, and Tony stops himself. He takes a breath, lets it out.
“I definitely don’t understand Captain America better than you, and I’ve gotta go,” Rhodey says, and Tony lets out a frustrated huff. “Keep me in the loop, I’ll hit you back if I get more on Hasegawa.”
“You could swing up here, let me suck you while you prep me,” he offers, but Steve shakes his head.
Peter’s brows fly up into his messy hair. “You heard him?”
“Steve-” Tony tries, but Steve hushes him. He presses their foreheads together.
Clint shrugs, unwrapping his hands. They’d gone a few rounds in the other ring before giving up the ghost and accepting that they weren’t going to be any good when there was this kind of show to watch instead.
“Hit me.” He frowns, pointing a fork at a very confused looking Thor. “Not you, Pikachu. You’re not allowed to hit me.”
“Hell yeah,” Tony says gratefully, snagging the brownie tin. Clint hops over the back of the couch to get settled. “How long?”
“I dunno what you mean, sir,” Steve says, and Tony huffs a helpless laugh. His chest aches with how much he loves this man. “Everything looks tip top up front. Thought I’d see if you needed an extra pair of hands back here.”
Tony isn’t sure he believes him, but he lets it slide. “Your little shower fantasy can be arranged,” he offers, and Loki’s eyes light up. He grins back at him, trying and failing to not be charmed.
Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth, taking a deep breath. He stood up, got a glass of water, sat back down at the table again.
“Should I save a burning nursery, perhaps?” Loki drawls, leaning across the table.
If he thinks about it, now, that whole period of his life feels strangely illuminated. He’d given Pepper his company, and Rhodey a suit. He’d written out his will. Most of his personal assets were going to charity; scholarships for gifted students, outreach programs for young poc scientists, initiatives for women in STEM. He’d always been hurt, remembering the words Fury had read to him, but he also always knew that it was a crock of shit. For a while, he’d thought that Natasha had misjudged him. He’d intentionally inflated his own persona in those days, in the hopes that it would hurt everyone less when he’d died. Of course, he knew from experience that hating someone for their own assholery didn’t necessarily make their death easier. Still, he never thought it was particularly fair to judge him too harshly for his actions then. What was it that JARVIS had said? He’d performed admirably under duress?
“Colonel Rhodes did everything he could,” JARVIS tries, but Tony isn’t having any of it.
. He sighs and rubs the spot briefly with his fingers. “Natasha texted you.”
“If you’d asked a month ago, I probably would have said yes.”
“I spoke to the rest of the team, and no one will ask you anything.”
“Oh, yeah, that’ll go over well with Silicon Valley. Do you really want to force a tech exodus and lose even more billions of dollars to Japan and China? I know you’re scared; it’s a big, brand new world, full of aliens and gods and enhanced humans. I’ve been living in it. But think big picture, boys. Not myself, or Romanov, or Barton, or Rhodes are enhanced. Hell, based on DNA at birth, neither is Captain America, or Doctor Banner, and Thor isn’t even from Earth so registration is a moot point there. If you wanna put restrictions on the Avengers, then let’s talk sanctions. But there’s no way you’re coming down on millions of enhanced Americans.”
“Trust but verify?” Clint says, sounding somewhat less aggressive, and Tony nods at him. Clint spares one last look for Loki before stalking out, and Natasha spares Tony a speaking look before following, silent and terrifying as ever. He expects he’ll be hearing about this later; he’ll have to pull out the good booze again.
“What, you want a blow-by-blow?”
“Like Cap’s best friend,” Beth says quietly. It is simultaneously the kindest and cruellest thing she could have possibly said, and Steve is so shocked at her words that he almost misses the blinding, beautiful smile that Tony looses in response. For that single, shining second he looks incandescently happy. His eyes crinkle at the corners. His teeth sparkle, white and straight and smooth.
“Much like Captain Rogers.”
“Right. Okay.” He gets up, rubs a hand through his hair. “Uh, I’ll meet you outside in a sec, Pep.”
Tony startles, his heart jumping right into his throat to find Steve standing in the dark tower garage like some kind of Hitchcock antagonist. He’s blocking the panel to call the elevator, and he’s been standing still in one position for so long that the motion sensor lights have gone out. Tony didn’t even see him.
"Ooh, I smell daddy issues," Tony says, probably a little too gleefully. He's trying to distract Steve from convincing him to change his mind, mostly because he isn't sure he's strong enough to resist his arguments. Steve's beautiful, and he's weak, okay? He's always known this about himself. He's so weak to a pretty face, and he's started to like Steve, despite everything. He's grown on Tony, slowly, without him noticing. Like algae on a sloth. "You've been holding out on me, Rogers. Tell me everything."
what it’s like-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I’ve found a pretty foolproof de-escalation technique, and right now there’s an obstacle between us preventing me from enacting it.”
Bruce tilts his head to the side, considering. “You’d have to swear to its purpose.”
“Falling asleep,” Steve warned him, and Tony laughed breathlessly, burying his nose in the dip below Steve’s ear. “Can keep going. But…”
“Nobody gives me any credit,” he grumbles. “Everybody keeps telling me you should know better, when I’m the one with experience. It’s no good for my ego.”
“You’re anti-dynamic too,” Tony argues. “Packs are-…traditional.”
“Right. Guess I better get on that, then. Immortality isn’t going to invent itself.”
, J. I’m so damn tired. I don’t- I don’t know what I’m doing. I feel like every move I make is just the lesser evil. I want a better answer, but I don’t know what that is. I’m the futurist. I’m supposed to be the one to envision the better answer. What the hell is the point if I can’t-”
Eventually, he returns to the worktop where Tony is passed out. He sits on the table, and he brushes his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Oh, God, spare me the biology lecture,” Steve groans. He presses a laughing kiss to Tony’s clavicle. “I love listening to you, but not right now, please-”
“Why?”
“Let me guess, a student of Loki’s?” he asks. She looks startled, and Tony laughs. “Nail on the head.”
Steve sucks in a sharp breath, considering Tony’s words. He looks wild, and frightened. Dark bags hang under his eyes, purpling and heavy. Steve isn’t sure if he’s been sleeping, but clearly even if he has, it hasn’t been helping him much. He looks unaccountably fragile, and Steve wants nothing more than to wrap him up and keep him from harm. Tony’s at the end of his rope, and it’s showing.
That night, there’s a restlessness to Tony’s motions that makes Steve anxious. He goes about his nightly ablutions quickly, nervously. There’s a shakiness to him that cannot be encapsulated by the slow, lazy night of cavorting and quiet, soul-baring sweetness he’d shared with Carol.
“I don’t-” Steve tried, but neither man was having any of it.
“Fine,” he bit out. “Send them. Set up the war room for me, and bring Bruce up. Maybe we can figure out who the hell these guys are.”
“I can’t knot you,” Tony hissed, sounding frustrated as hell, and Steve whimpered, begged “no, alpha, please,” but Tony just shook his head. “I have a meeting, sweetness. There’s not enough time.”
“Of course,” he huffs, then pulls away. “I guess I should put some clothes on and get down to the lab.”
Tony struggles to bear letting Steve take care of him. Steve knows this, because he knows Tony, but also because it is plain to see. Tony wears his guilt like a mourning shroud, and it does not matter that it was not his fault. Steve could tell him so until he was blue in the face, for years, and it still would not make a dent. He knows this from experience. From his last death. He wonders if there is a death that Tony would not blame himself for, and finds that his mind comes up empty. Tony would always blame himself: for not being there, for being there and not moving fast enough, for not creating something to protect his loved ones, for not dying first.
Thor nods. “I do not want the throne,” he says again, more firmly this time. He grins broadly. “My brother has lauded me to all the realms as the protector of Yggdrasil, champion of all. He has spun it so that my refusal to serve as Asgard’s king is the move of a noble man, a move that makes me a shared asset among a common people, united. It has helped greatly in my attempts to push back against a council that would rather just have me take Odin’s place.”
Y E S, Steve taps, because the faltering expression on Tony’s face is too much for him to bear. W E W E R E
“If you challenge Tony as alpha and win, you may end up as pack leader,” he warned, but Natasha just shook her head.
“I know, baby, I’m sorry.” Tony mouthed over his bondmark again, running his teeth gently over it and clutching hard at Steve’s waist when his knees buckled. A soft whine tumbled out of his throat, and Tony snarled and did it again.
“Can I tell you a secret?” Steve asks him. He’s adorable, really, in a way that makes Tony wonder if it’s calculated. Steve is a masterful tactician, and Tony knows that he can’t possibly be as smooth as he acts half the time. The real Steve is such a dork. He suspects, actually, that much of Steve’s flirting is planned, but even if it is, he doesn’t mind at all. It’s flattering that Steve would try so hard.
“I want you to make a mess of me,” Steve says, and that’s…
“It’s me,” he says. “Tony, can you hear me?”
“Oh, Tony,” Steve murmurs, “please don’t cry.”
“Well, there’s a long history of Irish Americans in the firefighting business,” Tony says, “but sure, I mean. I’m just the engineer, here. I’m Italian and German. So you guys tell me.”
“You good?” he slurred, consonants softened by sleep. Clint sometimes struggled with annunciation without his hearing aids in, and being exhausted likely didn’t help.
“Not really.”
Tony meets her gaze unflinchingly, remembering the freezing cold of the desert at night and the burn of the sand against his dry, cracking skin.
He’s standing across from Tony, which is enough to make Steve’s breath shudder in his noncorporeal chest. He’s seen the footage of Tony breaking down at his funeral. He doesn’t want to be here, to see this. Between them, he can see his own body. His face is pale and unmarred, sealed up in some sort of cryochamber. He tries to press his hands to the glass pane, but they go right through.
“Captain America!” a girl’s voice snapped, staticky, and Steve straightened up and glanced around.
“Brat. Upload any readings you’ve gotten to the project folder, see if we can’t get you to be able to see him all the time.”
"I like my room now, actually," Steve says, his expression entirely too calculating. "If that's alright. The light in there is perfect. I was actually thinking that Hulk should have his own space to let loose, too—take the pressure off a little. Maybe we can use that space for him."
"Why'd you even invite me?" Sam wheezes in his ear.
Steve laughs, low and frustrated. He scrubs a hand roughly through his wet hair. He’s so soft like this. Beautiful, even in his anger. “Why can’t you just say what you mean?”
“Yes, I suppose this is my fault,” Loki agrees, pressing cold lips to his cheek. Tony shoves at him roughly, aware of the eyes that must be watching, but immediately he can feel the familiar tingling warmth of Loki’s healing rushing through him, wiping away all of the damage that has been dealt to his tired body, down to the residual bruises from Steve’s elevator outburst. Tony opens his eyes, taking in Clint’s poleaxed expression and the slight widening of Natasha’s eyes. Thor is frozen mid-gesture, mouth open in a wordless snarl, and Loki squints at him from a few inches away, hands folded behind his back.
Tap tap tap.
Rogers’ Irish skin betrayed him. It was one of Tony’s favourite things to see, and he made sure to jostle Rogers out of his way with his hip as he passed.
“No,” Tony says. “I…I’ve been working. I haven’t showered.”
Pepper freezes, her hand on the knob. "What?"
“Take care of yourself out there,” Steve says, and that’s it; that’s the thing that will bring Tony to his knees. He closes his eyes, makes a fist so tight his nails dig into his palm. “Make sure you eat enough.”
“Don’t you think that’s for the best?” Steve says dully, which,
“Get used to what?” Tony prompts, even though he knows the answer.
It’s an empty parking garage, it looks like. The overhead lights are off, a few lamps bathing the desks and worktops gathered near the elevator in yellow. Orange power cables snake through the darkness like vines, crossing over each other and black cords, all leading towards a greenish light in the distance, a prone form spread out on some sort of cot. Large, hulking machines huddle behind him like stone guardians. The only sound in the place is the whir of the suit and a quick, erratic beeping.
“But don’t you think the accusations of personal bias are valid, considering Ambassador McCoy’s ties to Doctor Charles Xavier and the so-called X-Men?”
“I don’t understand what you’re asking me,” Steve says, frustrated. He takes a shaky breath, shoulders shifting under his leather jacket. “I need you to explain. Now.”
“Is that for me?” Steve asks, a particular smile breaking over his face. It’s a smile Tony suspects he’s the only one who’s ever seen, and he’s quite glad because if anyone else knew that Steve could be this wicked-
“Loud and clear,” Bruce said cheerfully. “I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of Miss Williams in the future.”
When he comes out, the ladies are still asleep. Tony blesses his luck and hunts around the room for his clothes, then steps out onto the balcony and calls Happy while he’s still looping his tie around his neck.
“I live in eternal fear for your life, sir.”
“You should know,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand, “I didn’t before you kissed me.”
It sounds like a dismissal, and Steve wets his chapped lips, tries again. “Pepper, I’m really sorry. I know that you’ve been taking care of Tony for longer than I have, and I violated the trust you have in me to watch his back, and keep him safe. That’s my job, and I messed up. Tony needs someone to look out for him, and I blew it.” He lets out a rough breath, running a hand over the back of his skull. “I’m just-…I want to make amends, here, but I don’t know what you’re looking for.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You better,” Tony says viciously, and then he picks up the pace.
Tony blinks at him, rearranging some assumptions. “I can maybe come twice, but usually once. If the sex is really good, I’ve been able to have a dry orgasm even after I’ve maxed out, but you’d have to work for it. Also, I do have a cock ring,” Tony offers, and Loki’s brow furrows in confusion. “It helps keep me from coming.”
“Wish me luck, JARVIS.”
“We require normal men and women to register their guns, which are their constitutional right,” Ross bites out. “Asking for registration from these mutants, who can- can run faster than planes can fly, or who can blow things up with their minds can’t possibly be asking for too much.”
Ah. Hell. Maybe that isn’t fair.
,” Tony snarls, mostly in his ear.
Steve swallows. He thinks of Erskine, of Bucky.
“I invited him to brunch! What more do you want from me,” Tony says, and Steve doesn’t need his eyes to read the disbelieving quality of Bruce’s silence.
“Mister Stark, it’s gonna be too right nasty to keep searching for the sheriff in a few hours. Maybe scarcer than that.” Tony turned to glance at the man looking at him, hat in his hands. Cage had strong, powerful limbs, good for the mining work. His partner stood in the back, humming off-key as she stirred a pot on their small stove.
“I’m not alone,” Steve says quietly, and Tony swallows. He looks away, takes a long draught of coffee.
“Yes.”
“Fuck,” Tony gaps, and Steve heaves a sigh. He kneels down in the footwell, half his body in the driver’s seat, and hovers his hands over Tony’s knees. He tries to meet Tony’s gaze. “Fuck.
“That wench?” Thor crows, voice incredulous. “I have no more love for Amora than you do for the woman who asked for you to sign her breast after our last fight in Times Square.”
"That's what you meant, when you said 'Well played.'" Steve snorts, despite himself. "He's always been too smart."
“Touch me,” Steve is begging, demanding, but Tony doesn’t listen to him. He doesn’t have to, and he’s not ready for this to be done yet. “Tony,
“I know I fucked up. I still-…” Tony sucks in a shuddering breath. “God knows I have so many regrets. But I do genuinely think that the system we have in place right now is better than no system at all. It took us a while to get here, but we were doing so good, weren’t we? We’d…it seemed like-”
“Steve,” Tony says, shaking his head, but that only seems to rile Steve up more.
Tony’s entire face had gone slack, even the smile slipping from his face. He looked like a storm had whipped through and taken everything he knew from under him, and Steve didn’t much like that look. “Tony? Tell me if I’ve got this all wrong.”
“We’re leaving around midnight.”
“Well, have you tried that?”
Tony tilts his head, furrowing his brows as he considers Bruce’s antsy shuffling. “What did he say to you?”
Steve nodded, watching as Bruce pulled up the CCTV footage. He watched Williams charge the guy, pausing and zooming in on a blurry frame.
Then he frowned, swinging his legs around to pull his briefs off, too.
“Let’s go up to the balcony,” he tells Tony. “We can sit outside. It’s a beautiful night.”
Steve considered the conversation, running it back. He thought about what Tony had said about his run, and the fact that he had put the island between them. He thought about the way Tony’s eyes had moved.
Then, for emphasis, he tilts Steve’s head down towards him, tiptoeing a half-step to kiss his forehead. Steve’s hands grip his shirt, a shuddering breath punching out of him. The shaking starts up again, and Tony waits, lips pressed warm and firm to Steve’s brow as Steve pulls himself together again.
“Ooh,” he coos. “Scandalous, Captain.”
There have been many times in his life that Steve Rogers has been deeply glad that Tony Stark does not have super-hearing. Listening to Beth mutter, “Cares, cared…” under her breath, Steve is not sure he’s ever been gladder. He cannot imagine what Tony’s would do with that in his current state, but it wouldn’t be anything good.
"Good," she says, hesitantly. "But there's a few things of your father's, that, well."
Loki smiles and dips his head, and Tony takes his distraction as opportunity to pull on his briefs, trying hard for casual and probably missing the mark by a mile. When he glances over his shoulder, Loki isn’t even looking at him, and Tony rolls his eyes at himself and pulls on his jeans.
Steve doesn’t know what he’s expecting when he gets back to the tower, but he doesn’t want to see anyone. He avoids the common areas and moves straight to his quarters, his shoulders only releasing their tension when he’s locked the door behind him. He presses his forehead to the cool wood and breathes. Fresh paint.
“I’d never do that to you,” Steve says, sounding wrecked, and Tony laughs shortly.
Steve closes his eyes and brushes their noses together, damn the surveillance cameras and any potential civilians with working phones.
“It’s okay,” Franklin says. “I know about the Scarlet Witch. But I’m not like
Suddenly, his promise to Loki surfaces in his mind. He’d promised, hadn’t he, to bring Cap in on this? How the fuck was he supposed to do that when Cap was admitting to the whole team that he was too unstable to be team leader? He glances, unbidden at Natasha, but her face is still a blank mask. Abruptly, Tony is aware of how many plates he has been spinning, all at once: Loki, the Avengers, Steve, the UN, the security taskforce, the US government, Ross, the new sanctions, his company. The weight of it seems too much to bear, and he takes a moment to close his eyes and breathe, remembering Harley’s no-nonsense attitude as he talked Tony through a panic attack. He swipes a heavy hand over his face.
He closes his eyes when Loki adds a third finger, arching into it and dragging one hand over his neck and down his body, heading for his cock. He knows what kind of picture he makes, and he cracks his eyes open to gauge Loki’s reaction as he strokes himself slowly, body rocking into those long fingers, a small smile on his face. Loki looks ravenous, but also wry; he knows exactly what Tony is doing.
“Don’t play dumb,” he tells him. “It’s not at all convincing.”
“She’s a little young for me.”
“Keeping an eye on me, buddy?” Tony’s voice is muffled behind his hands, his voice hoarse.
Bruce doesn’t say anything. He’s watching Tony with the kind of tired pity that Tony hates, because it’s an expression people wear when they think that there’s no solution to a problem. There is always a solution. Always.
Tony freezes. He sucks in a slow, shaking breath.
“No!” Steve barked, sharper than he’d meant to. His own anger took him by surprise. The idea that someone else could come into this space, could taint the last bastion of Tony’s scent- “No, JARVIS. I’m sorry. Just give me a minute.”
Tony closes the door to Pepper’s office behind him with a huff of laughter. Outside, a few SI employees walk by, offering him a smile and a nod. He composes himself with a small shake, then heads down to his meeting with Stark Legal. They’re supposed to discuss the licencing for a new line of Iron Man toys proposed by Mattel. He’s mostly going because Joyce is running the meeting. He likes Joyce.
“Steve has been paying Obeisance to you since he moved in here. It’s very clear in your interactions, Tony. In his mind, you are his alpha.” Tony opens his mouth to protest, but Bruce speaks over him. “Think about it, Tony. Really think about it. He brings you food. He always backs down from arguments. He follows your commands. He’s exhibiting textbook behaviour for an alpha joining a new pack.”
Steve swallows and stares at the floor counter, trying to keep his mind clear, his muscles lax, his pulse steady. It’s a harder task than he expects.
“Tell me.”
“Tony?” Steve is saying, over and over again, and
Steve groans. He tips his head forward and rests his cheek on the porcelain, eyes closed. “Fuck me.”
Tony stares at him, hands braced against the bar. His elbows are locked tight, body hunched over the table top like he’s bracing to leap over it and fight Steve with his bare hands.
“Already done, sir.”
“I can tell him that Doctor Banner would like him to bring his bow and the arrows he used in the Lagos battle to his lab for testing.”
Chapter title is Mary Oliver's
, Tony thinks viciously, and then,
“Sir is eating lunch with Mr. Odinson in the communal kitchen. Shall I take you there?”
“Oh,” Tony says, and then, “this isn’t just sex.” Fucking spell. “I…” He stops, trying to get his bearings between the curse and Steve’s body pressing him up against the cool concrete of the garage wall. The plastic sash crinkles under Tony’s grasping fingers, slick and sliding as Tony’s hands sweat a bit from desire and hours of physical labour. Steve’s shoulders are hot and hard beneath his hands, and they shift with every breath he takes.
“I saw that! He pushed you?”
, J. They didn’t deserve this shit. We should have tried harder to get them to release them to SHIELD.”
“Is it?” the professor asks archly, taking Steve’s proffered hand. Steve is immediately charmed. “And likewise, Captain.”
Eventually, the kisses slowed into something gentler, almost apologetic. Soothing. Steve whined into Tony’s mouth when he pulled away, but his alpha just smiled at him, dark eyes glittering with unshed tears of his own.
“It’s no longer acceptable in America,” Bruce had explained to him. The quiet, muted way he inhabited the world was more noticeable when Steve had seen how he bloomed open for Tony. His jealousy curdled inside of him, thick and acrid in the back of his throat as he swallowed down the urge to growl. “Outside of the U.S., that’s not necessarily the case. But it’s become standard for people in the so-called First World to tamp down on outward primal expressions of their dynamic. Dynamics are considered private, and many people in the U.S. are on suppressants year round, now. Many omegas and alphas live as betas. So Posturing, it’s, uh…”
“Captain, I hate to wake you, but you must see this.”
“Steve!” Tony roared, and Steve felt his whole body snap to attention. He could count the number of times Tony had used his alpha status for dominance in his presence on one hand, and it had absolutely never been directed at him. “Turn around and look at me.”
“Have me do your dirty work, why don’t you.”
. The crowd was cheering, a single loud ‘we love you’ bursting out, and Tony turned his head to offer a wink to the culprit.
Steve frowns at him, but Bruce just laughs.
Happy shrugs.
“Oh my god,” Tony says faintly. “Your brother is my new favourite person, Thor. I’m sorry to everyone else who lives in this tower, but that’s my final decision. He’s sold me. I’m in, Team Loki 100%. I’m a believer. Is there a temple? I’m there. Let’s go.”
‘Well he can keep them if he likes them.’ Steve writes back. Then he lets himself out, clutching the meagre bag of things he’d chosen to take with him as though it will save him from whatever typhoon is coming next.
“He says to wait until the bloodwork comes back before any decisions are made. You can all talk options, then.”
. His muscles aren’t just for show, or given to him by a special serum. It’s hard work to move it, even with technological assistance. But that isn’t, in fact, how tentacles work, and so he sighs and bites the bullet.
“Which makes it all the more galling that you choose to act stupid all the time.” She hangs up before Tony can retort, which is perhaps the most aggravating thing Maria could have done to Tony. He hates not getting the last word.
“Don’t bring that science is magic malarkey into the Batcave,” Tony says with great affront, clutching at his chest. Thor simply smiles and offers a hand to him.
“I believe you’re experiencing angina due to Bond Stress. It's often called Broken Heart Syndrome, although I'm sure you find that term unbearably poetic. Would you like me to call Dr. Banner?”
“Loki’s immature in some ways, too.” He grins a little, remembering wrestling with Loki in the bedsheets, the pale arc of his ribs as he squirmed away, laughing. “Trust me.”
Steve inhaled slowly, fingers clenching in the workshop hoodie bundled in his lap. He’d barely been without it in the last week, a last attempt to mitigate the bond-sickness. Nausea overtook him at the worst moments, dizziness, blinding panic, lust, and fury in turns. He’d benched himself from missions and called Rhodes and Sam in to cover for himself and Tony while they waited for Tony to get better. Rhodes had gotten leave from the Air Force, and he’d been more than happy to be in the tower where he could keep an eye on Tony during his recovery. Steve wondered what he thought of being kept in the dark; he hadn’t known that Rhodes was unaware of Tony’s biological sex.
“Because she thought Tony had killed Loki. Which shows how little she knows of us, really.”
“I…” Rogers cleared his throat, coming in and closing the door behind him. “I thought I’d see how you were.”
“What’d you find, Shellhead?” Steve asks him. He traces a hand over Tony’s nape, climbing out of his lap so that Tony can work. Regretfully, Tony leans down and pulls on his briefs and pants in one go. Steve watches him with open avarice. There’s no one to see him do it, and he can’t quite help himself. He feels
“Tony, please, please fuck me, I want you to come inside me, I want you to fill me up, please, I want to feel you-” Steve’s voice breaks off abruptly as Tony pushes in, and the slide is easy. Each ridge makes Steve hitch his hips the slightest bit, and he’s chanting “yes, yes, yeah,” under his breath, low and lovely and grateful.
There is the briefest of pauses. For JARVIS, that may as well be a lifetime. “You’re serious.”
Tony: ALLOSTATIC OVERLOAD
“Who, me?” Steve asks, leaning in closer. His eyes are so bright and blue in the sunny March morning, the cold wind bringing a bit of colour to his high cheekbones. “I’m just doin’ my job, boss.”
The clock in the hall chimes the hour, and Steve takes a breath and lets it out. “Time’s up, I guess.”
“Why is Hasegawa dead?” Tony says lowly, radiating fury now, and Steve gives Thor what he hopes is a speaking look.
“I don’t think it’s a ‘schoolboy crush’ when you are in a relationship, sir.” JARVIS’ voice is gentle as Tony’s ever heard it. “This is hard for you, but I am not sure I understand why.”
“Tony,” Steve says, expression a rictus of guilt and frustrated confusion, “please tell me what is going on.”
Tony nods. He does know. It’s part of why he eggs Steve on, when he’s feeling vulnerable and…less. “So you turn to fists.”
“It’s just a little bit of CBD and THC oil. 50:1.”
Tony hasn’t.
“And then I had a life-ruining crush on you,” Tony said, grinning, and Steve flushed. “I wasn’t about to jeopardise my chances with the hottest omega in the world.”
“You didn’t ask me,” Tony said, stubborn as ever. His arms were wrapped around Steve’s neck and his mouth tasted like happiness and champagne and canapés.
“Yeah?”
“Great,” Tony says, propping a hand on his hip. He examines the cluster of black cars that have rolled up. “I see…NIA, SSS, and DIA. Christ.”
Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders, carding his fingers into Steve’s hair. His hands are shaking. “You’re fucking breathtaking, Steve Rogers. You gorgeous thing, you’ve been so sweet for me.”
alright. Mostly. He hadn’t been lying about that. He can handle this with poise and grace. He’s Tony Stark, god damnnit. They’re just tentacles.
“There was a shootout,” Rogers said, still fussing over his bandage, and Tony sighed. Of course there was. “I got two of ‘em, but one of them clipped my arm on the way down, knocked me off Liberty. When I woke up I had no horse, no water, and I was freezing. I’d lost my coat in the fight. I could barely move.”
“And what do they taste like?” Loki asks, choosing the smallest one and narrowing his eyes at it.
Tony shakes himself a little, then heads up the stairs.
Hulk growls, his scent spiking with anger. “Voice stupid. Tin Man hurt inside, not outside. Inside hurt bad, too.”
Here we finally see how Tony and Steve got together/the two of them reconcile/questions are answered! Yay! Tbh most of what's left is porn, but I know that's why like half of y'all are here, let's be honest. >___>"
That night, Tony welcomes Steve into his bed again.
“Pain and metal,” Loki says softly, shifting to press an open-mouthed kiss approximately over Tony’s heart. “It is a fascinating device.”
“You had an eyelash,” he mutters, glancing back out the window. A figure stands ahead, off to the side, and Steve squints at the silhouette. It’s small, but growing larger as they speed towards it. The highway is empty, now, except for a few cars on the other side of the barrier. There’s nothing but oncoming traffic, and a man on the side of the road.
“Do you not think that being a superhero requires that kind of energy?”
“How? Could be a lot of things. Could be a magic user fucking with you. Could be someone who’s got powers like Kitty. Could be-”
“Yours,” Tony agreed, and
There’s a pause. “She is now.”
Minoru flashes a wry smile at him and dips her head in agreement. “Sorry again,” she says.
That’s alright; he’s not worried. He knows Tony will figure it out.
Steve nods. “And no alcohol, either.” Logan snorts. “You ever think about moving off site?”
“Would you be amenable to an assignment?”
“Hush,” Natasha said, looking between Steve and Bruce with a speculative expression. “It’s none of our business why. Just that we get the job done.” Her voice made it clear that she was quoting something, or at least referencing something only the two of them knew. The scowl on Clint’s face only confirmed it.
“I should be back by seven,” Tony said, pressing another little apologetic kiss to the shell of Steve’s ear. “You’re feeling a little needy, hmm?”
“That kind of thing is a poison, y’know? Keeping it locked up inside. It ruins people from the inside out, when you bottle that shit up.” Tony pauses, as if waiting for Steve to reply, but Steve doesn’t have anything to say to that. Tony laughs, then: quiet, almost sad. “I just wish I could have shown him the future.”
“This place is gonna go up. Can I safely pull Cap out of here?”
Anyway I am sorry. I hope you enjoyed. I will try to update in a not-terrible fashion now that I am a graduated individual (and presently unemployed while job hunting lmao). Also I have no beta so lmk if there's any issues! And as always, I really do appreciate any kind of feedback. <3
“You think?” he asks, but really, he’s giddy. For that one brief moment, he touched Tony. Tony felt him, he was sure of it. Tony felt his touch.
Steve?” Pepper skirls, and Tony closes his mouth.
“Tony!” Pepper hisses, and Tony turns back to her with his most winning smile. “Yeah, that stopped working on me years ago. Try harder.”
Tony stares at him for longer than is polite, and Steve meets his gaze with his pulse thundering so loud he’s almost surprised Tony can’t hear it. He sets his jaw, tries to school his face into something less lovesick, and Tony’s expression shifts. His brow smooths out, and he turns back to his work. “Yeah, well. Guess he didn’t want to see it. A future that included queer liberation was already halfway here when he died.”
“You’ve eaten more motor oil than usual already. Wash your hands properly.”
“Black doesn’t show up on black.”
“You…don’t look very ready,” Beth says, frowning. She takes him by the elbow. “I kinda wasn’t expecting you back today. Tony-”
But part of Steve, the part of him that had loved reading the bodice rippers the omegas used to pass around in art school, had always dreamed of a bond. He’d dreamed of some gorgeous alpha to come and bond him and save him from the dragging monotony of living hand to mouth every day, from cradle to grave. He’d dreamed of a family, of someone he could have a child with. It was something he’d been sure he’d never have. Now, with the serum, he still wasn’t sure. When he walked into a room heads turned. People deferred to him. The serum had made him something other, caught halfway between alpha commanding officer and shy omega artist. It made sense that he hadn’t had much in the way of offers since waking up. Most people were intimidated, and that wasn’t what people were looking for in an omega. All that he’d been through, that his body had been through, and he still couldn’t find a mate.
“You still think this is a dream,” he says. Cap’s silence is answer enough. “Fuck. What did they do to you?”
Franklin, Steve could tell, was quite delighted to have a position of such importance. Tony had retreated to the bathroom to wash the goop from the electrodes out of his hair and cried, Steve hopes for the last time, in the shower where he could maintain a piece of his dignity. It was sheer relief that graced him when he stepped out and onto the clean tile. It was like he was an entirely different man.
“Good,” he said, and Steve let out a soft sob of want. “Elbows and knees.”
Tony’s voice breaks, and Steve rubs a hand over his face. He hates this. He doesn’t know what to do, but what he’s doing isn’t working. Tony’s in too deep to even notice that Steve’s right here. He’s too blinded by his own grief.
,” Tony begins and Steve pulls back with a small sound of triumph and fixes him with a stern look.
Steve touches him like he’s something precious and breakable. Tony should be used to this, but he never quite manages it. Instead it just reduces him to this: misty eyed and trembling like a new-born fawn in the warm circle of Steve’s arms.
“I fucking want you to stay! You know I want you to stay! I want to go home to my private beach and bring you and my sad sack bond mate and meet up with Pep and Happy see how beautiful you all look in the Malibu sun. I want my workshop with the rest of my bots. I want to feel safe in my own fucking skin again. I want to sleep for two weeks. But I have a Fortune 500 company, and responsibilities, and Pepper is too sad about our breakup to be my friend right now, and my stupid fucking so-called soulmate left me, and now you tell me you’re leaving too. So what’s the fucking point of asking when you know what I want and we don’t want the same thing, huh?” Tony’s shouting, now, and he knows it’s stupid. He knows it’s dangerous to rile Bruce up, but he’s angry. He’s exhausted and heartbroken and maybe dying,
Natasha was waiting at the bar when Steve got up in the morning.
“Oh, you poor, stupid mortal,” Amora says, leaning over Loki’s shoulder. The woman in white boxes him in on the other side. “Did you think Loki was truly your friend?”
“Rhodes is an excellent asset.” Natasha shrugs, elegant as ever. “Ross respects you, as much as you annoy him. He wouldn’t work with anyone else, except maybe Steve.” She pulls out a sharp smile, an old joke: “And Steve’s shit at politics.”
“It’s worth a try,” Peter says stubbornly, and Tony sighs.
“I couldn’t…they didn’t know. About us. I couldn’t-”
Steve smiles miserably, then shakes his head. After a moment, Sam puts the glass in the sink.
3602 Spectrum Blvd
“I love you, and you’re an idiot,” Steve says, and Tony laughs wetly, his mouth pressed to Steve’s temple, gasping and warm. “You’re an idiot, and I’m an idiot, and I’m sick of wasting time we don’t have. This is our third chance, Tony. I don’t think we get another one. This is our chance to make things right, the way they always should have been. To be together. Like it was meant to be.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You have already provided me with an invaluable gift, Captain, as you have for the past two years,” JARVIS said. “You do not need to give me anything else.”
The phone tilts wildly, then goes dark. It’s not true black, and there’s no notification that pops up, so Tony suspects that Steve has just tossed his phone face-down onto his bedspread.
“My mistake,” Loki says gravely, his eyes jewel bright in the burgeoning dawn. “I shall endeavour to remember your inscrutability.”
“Just to the living room,” he said, while Steve frowned at him. He wasn’t pouting. He wasn’t. “Baby, we’ve been in here for almost five days, and as sexy and gorgeous and irresistible as you are, I haven’t felt the sun on my face in over a month.”
to finish this,” Tony says widening his eyes meaningfully, and Beth stares at him for a long moment. Her eyes narrow as she takes in Tony’s appearance paired with the fervour of his demands.
“Malibu,” Tony says, “where I live.”
“It’s me,” Reed counters, and Tony sucks in a breath. His eyes dart up to meet Reed’s for a moment before flickering away again. “It’s you and me, Tony. Let me help you.”
Steve’s pulse falters in his throat. A quiet ringing sounds in his ears. “What?” he asks, faintly. His voice is a rasping whisper in the quiet.
"Stop," he pleads. Blessedly, Steve stops talking. "Jesus, Lovelace, and Tesla."
“Omega,” Tony gasped, and then he was coming, knot swelling large enough that Steve’s lips were forced in a tight seal around his base lest his teeth begin to cut in. “Fuck.
Cabe rolls her eyes, tossing her hair back over her shoulder. “A little birdie told me about a certain Norse god you might be fraternising with?”
“But what?” Pepper says, folding her arms, but her eyes are bright with mirth. “You cost me twenty bucks.”
“It’s alright,” he said, and Rogers looked back at him with his pupils blown, mouth red and used. In the low light of the setting sun, his hair looked warm and golden. “Jesus.”
Tony shakes his head. “Just curious,” he says. He reaches over and snags a waffle, folding it in half like a pizza and tipping it towards his mouth to catch the excess syrup. Steve watches him with something curling slow and dizzying in his non-existent stomach.
“Don’t be,” Tony says. He sounds almost gleeful, and Steve closes his eyes and resigns himself to what he expects will be a round of merciless teasing. “Good to remember you’re flawed.”
“Not bad,” Rogers said, and Tony laughed.
“Yessir.” He can feel the bed dip as Steve stands, whistling jauntily. There’s the soft rustle of fabric, and Tony debates for about half a second before he pulls his arm away from his face. Steve has pulled off his shirt, standing there hard and mouth-wateringly cut in the low light of dawn, nothing but the thin fabric of his boxers hiding him from Tony’s ravenous gaze. He’s blushing hotly, pink spread from his cheekbones all the way down his chest, but he’s proud, too. Tony wants to eat him alive.
“Lube and condoms,” he says. “I’ve been admiring those long fingers of yours.”
“I was getting to it!” Tony protests. “Also, using the accent while we’re arguing is cheating. We agreed.”
you to belong to me. So if you want informed consent, here it is.” He leans close, mouth skating over Tony’s jaw, to drip utter filth into Tony’s ear like poison. “I want you to put your hands back on my ass. Spread me open. Work your big, wet cock inside of me, and fuck me like you damn well
“Excuse me,” he says, reaching a hand out to a young woman passing by. “I’m looking for Doctor Charles Xavier?”
“Spiderman can feel when he’s in the room. There’s nothing wrong with my brain scans. I don’t- He’s not a hallucination, but Stephen couldn’t find any hint of him. I’m… God, I’m tired
“Alright,” Tony said, and tossing the towel on the bench. He picked up his mouthguard with two nimble fingers. “Hit me, Cap.”
“I touched him for two seconds,” Tony complains. “Three tops.”
The common kitchen is buzzing with talk and laughter when Tony and Rhodey step out of the elevator, hands aching and smudged with black grease. Tony expects Steve’s chiding voice telling him to wash his hands, knowing better, hating that no one says it and thankful that no one says it all at once. They’d bicker, about whether or not Tony had already washed them, or perhaps if he’d done a fine enough job. He stops in the living room, one hand on the back of a couch, watching the team bob and weave around each other as they unpack brown paper bags full of takeout. They’re a well-oiled machine, and the missing intercooler is conspicuous.
Steve stares at the door for another minute, hands tightening. He turns on his heel and heads for the elevator, then punches in the number for the garage. His reflection stares back at him in the polished metal walls, face distorted, repeated back and back out into infinity. When the doors slide open, the sight of the Softtail sits in his chest like a lead weight. He remembers Tony helping him fix it up after an unexpected firefight left some cosmetic damage, oil staining his hands, a bright grin on his face. He’d been introducing Steve to The Dirty Mac, explaining the concept of a supergroup. It was a good memory.
Strange purses his lips. Then he sighs, and floats away into another room.
Loving Tony any more than he already does would create a singularity. It’s something he knows he could never undo. It’s something he does not deserve. If the Civil War was what it was like when they reach an intractable problem and there still remains some form of barrier between them, what would it be like when the thin line between them has been erased? Steve knew from his father exactly how love could turn to hate. To violence. It was in his blood, same as his mother’s healing hands, and he’d always known exactly what kind he’d inherited. He was a killer, just like his pa. He can feel that sense of betrayal still lingering between his teeth, the pressure to bite like a vicious, feral thing. The memory of Tony under his hands, shaking, blood on his face, will haunt him until the day he dies. Tony deserves better than Steve. He knows that isn’t what Tony thinks. It probably isn’t what anyone thinks, save for a small handful of people who love Tony better than they love Captain America. Carol. Jim Rhodes. Pepper Hogan. Jan, maybe, when Jan was still around. God, but he misses her.
“I think you like it when I make fun of you,” Tony says, and Steve turns a deadpan expression on him. “Nope, that stern face doesn’t work on me anymore! You’re too far away to be scary. I can just hang up if I want to.”
The truth is, their whole relationship is littered with little moments like this: things Steve wouldn’t let himself feel. And maybe it is because it was forbidden, in some small part of Steve’s mind. Perhaps Tony had been right about that. There is some small piece of him, left over from his youth, that skitters away from thoughts of men like that. Even though he’d fought bullies for saying bigoted things when he was young. Even though he’d stood up for Arnie. It’s different, when it’s you. When you’re Catholic. When you’re Army. When you’re the walking avatar of a country that doesn’t always abide by its own high standards of equality and fairness for all.
and you realize the one person in the world who loves you
“Flirt later,” Widow says via comms, and Tony grins, flipping himself over and flying above the quinjet.
“Strange,” Tony and Peter say in unison, and Maria blinks at them.
For a moment, he doesn’t understand what he’s seeing. It’s Steve. Steve asleep, a bit of drool at the corner of his mouth, on the workshop sofa. He’s got a streak of black charcoal on one cheekbone. Originally Tony set the photo as Steve’s caller ID as a joke, but looking at it now, he still manages to look like Fragonard’s Endymion. He’s unreal.
“Little late for that,” Tony mutters, and Steve properly scowls at that. “Sorry, ignore me. I’m tired. Um. I mean, do whatever you wanna do. You live here too, now, so. Y’know.” He waves a hand, awkward, to the kitchen they’ve all been sharing while the penthouse is still being repaired. “This isn’t even my kitchen. It’s your and Bruce’s kitchen. My kitchen is broken and crusted over with flecks of biohazardous Asgardian supervillain blood.”
“You wanted to trick Amora into thinking you were dead so you could stop playing buddy buddy with her,” Clint guesses, eyes narrowed. “Stark, did you know about this?”
"Biometrics would indicate a joke at your expense, sir."
“You’d really marry me?”
“NIA is taking point,” Hill agrees. “War Machine is already serving as liaison in light of the present situation. Probably for the best.”
L O N G D A Y, Steve chides him. He guides Tony’s hand to the elevator button. T O M O R R O W.
“I did, sort of,” Tony admits. “But I was looking for something very specific. Anything that was supposed to help with heavy metal poisoning. Most of that was what to ingest. I drank a lot of algae.”
“You’re a polite young man. You come from a traditional Catholic background?”

“Sir is well aware,” JARVIS replied, sounding amused himself. “He is already trying to decide how to thank her.”
In the next room, Tony lets out the sweetest, deepest groan he’s ever heard anyone make. It echoes through the half-open door of the bathroom. It puts Steve’s heart in his throat.
“Guess so,” Steve says softly, and Tony smiles against his skin. “I’ve got time to convince you, haven’t I?”
“Eat,” Thor says, gesturing with his fork. “Eat and replenish your strength before you must once again descend into your workshop to scheme and plot an end to our enemies.”
“Uh huh,” Steve says, grinning. He gets in the car anyway. “What are your feelings on The Hulk?”
“I’ve been Iron Man for eight years, now, and the Avengers have been operating for two, four if you wanna go back to the Battle of New York. We haven’t failed you yet, have we?” Tony asks, spreading his hands. “Give us fair sanctions, and we can work something out. This country is built on checks and balances. We’re all patriots. But none of you can be blind to how ugly something like registration could get. Rogers was
“Not if we want him alive,” Clint says, then winces and glances over at Bruce. “Sorry.”
“Sure. Hell, maybe I should send one to Morgan Le Fay.”
“Okay,” Bruce says, pushing himself to standing. “Okay, we can work on this. We’ll get you an MRI, and we’ll get Shuri down here. Maybe she’ll see something I don’t.”
The silence from the priest gains a ponderous quality. “You don’t get along?”
Tony's face crumples into a vicious smile. Steve braces himself. "Jealous, Captain? I'm not allowed to make new friends?"
“It’s still filming,” Steve says, mouth twitching.
“It will take ages to retrofit the tower, ugh. And it’ll look ugly as sin if we do a temporary fix. Frankenstein’s giant cobbled iron cock.”
“Uh, I’m pretty sure I should buy you dinner after all that,” Steve counters, then flushes a little. “I mean, uh. Sorry. I’m a little out of sorts still, I think.”
“You have to ask?” Bucky says. There’s the sound of movement on the other end. Steve imagines him grabbing a go bag, packing up his various weapons. “You could’ve sent me coordinates with no context and I’d still have shown up. You know that, right?”
“From the footage I’ve seen, I would estimate forty-six agents dead or in critical condition with low odds of survival. Thirty seven more have been seriously injured, but are in no serious danger of dying in the near future, with another twelve only having sustained minor injuries.”
“Touch me,” Tony pants, groaning and rocking his hips when Loki does just that. When he begins to leave a bruise right over the sensitive patch he’s found, that’s it for Tony. He slips over the edge of a shuddering orgasm, body shaking with it, spine bowing. Loki groans at the muscle contraction and strokes him through it, following not long after.
“Always,” he says, and Tony bites him in recompense. Kinky fucking bastard that he is, Steve only hums in pleasure. “You came for
“Oops.”
“You’re an optimist,” Natasha interrupts him, and Tony frowns. “You trust too easily. You’ve been betrayed and bullied and manipulated all your life, and you’re desperate for love and affection. Countless others have taken advantage of this. The approval of a man who knew your father personally, of military types, of politicians and government men, is something you have been raised to desire-”
“Be easier if I didn’t own so much Captain America junk, huh?” Tony says, finally. The joke is weak, but it breaks the tension in the room, and Tony reaches out and takes the shirt from Beth’s shaking hands. Then he pulls it on over his wet hair, pushes his arms into the sleeves. He smooths the fabric down over his belly.
“Tony!” Bruce shouts, but Tony isn’t listening to him.
Steve glances up at Tony from over his shoulder. His eyes are crinkled at the corners. “Of course,” he says, mouth twitching.
“Okay, okay!” Steve laughs. “I’m going. I’ll see you later, alright?”
Tony sneers and turns away, rubbing his hair dry. He rummages in the drawer for a pair of briefs, tossing them on the bed and then heading to the closet. Something comfortable, natural fibres in case of damage breaching the suit, he thinks. He has no idea how this mission will go, but he knows from experience that comfortable clothes make fighting easier in and out of the suit and that man-made fibres mean third degree burns if things happen to go south.
“Tony,
“Ouch,” Steve laughs. “Yeah, thankfully. I’m not sure if I’m ready for that yet.” He huffs, rubbing a hand over his mouth. “I had an interesting conversation with a friend.” Several, actually, but he didn’t necessarily feel comfortable talking about his sex life with the professor. It seemed…improper.
“Fine.” A small smile cracks Maria’s stern expression. “Don’t do anything stupid, Tony.”
Tony blinks at him, then frowns. “You were glad.”
“Yours. I’m yours, my alpha. My beautiful alpha.” He hooked an ankle around one of Tony’s legs, wanting him impossibly deeper. “My gorgeous mate, mine,
JARVIS turns the television on and cues up the movie. As the opening flashes of names and companies begins, Steve is blindsided by how glad he is to be home, and then, surprise that the tower truly feels like home now. He hadn’t been taken care of in so long, but he supposes that’s what Tony’s good at. He sneaks up on you, and by the time you notice it he’s too close to easily shut out.
Steve has a tell, when he’s thinking too hard. The very corner of his mouth purses just the tiniest bit. It makes him look irritated, but also kind of cute in a pouty way. Tony hates that he keeps noticing these things. “You really mean that,” he says, slowly. “Talking to me over video is easier for you.”
“He is a man,” she says, as though this explains everything. “He made mistakes. You’ve made many mistakes in your life, Tony Stark.”
"You have never been above using sex to get what you want."
homophobic?” Peter asks, sounding incensed now, and Tony laughs. A bright, hysterical peal that scrapes over Steve’s nerves with all the gentleness of a cheese grater.
“The combatant Mr. Laufeyson called Moonstone did significant damage to the armour, sir. It will take at least four hours to repair the shell and mechanics and replace all of the weapons’ capabilities you released, not even considering the damage to the wiring which has yet to be catalogued.”
“I am untrustworthy,” Loki says, sounding bitter, and Tony processes that leap. He files it away to examine later.
After a week, Bruce called them home. They’d cleared out everything they could find of Hydra, SHIELD picking up the pieces where they could manage it. There was nothing left to do, besides hike the Gerogian countryside and partake in their food and drink. Steve suspected Thor had gone out of his way to keep Steve busy for the past two days.
“My dad did his best, but he was a man of his time.”
“It’s alright,” he says easily. He feels light as a feather now. Franklin dutifully repeats his words. “Good night Franklin. Thank you again.”
“I’ll come up before I leave for the day.”
Steve raises his eyebrows, a crease forming at the centre where Tony’s always telling him he’s gonna get premature wrinkles,
“Go on,” Tony says, making little shooing motions with his fingers. Steve looks as though he’s been cleaved in two, still in half a costume. His feet are bare. Tony didn’t notice that before. He remembers this morning, suddenly feeling so far removed that it’s numbed him, like another life or a dream.
“I’m going to turn out the lights now. I’ll see you in the morning, Tony.”
"So, the arc reactor," Tony muses. Loki's nostrils flare slightly. "It's a beauty, I know, I'm flattered, really."
"My people, any of them, Avengers or Stark Industries or even SHIELD. You come after them, I'll make what the Hulk did to you look like a love tap."
Tony nods, as though he’d expected this. It’s a front: Steve can tell he’s disappointed, grieving almost. But neither of these men know Tony like Steve does, and Tony’s greatest armour has always been the one he constructs in his own mind. His shields are up, and so they will remain until he is once again in the safety of his own space.
, does that flush Tony all the way up to his ears. He knows it doesn’t show, but his face feels like he could light a candle off it.
Pepper shrugs as they step out into the afternoon sun.
“There’s no form you could take,” Steve says seriously, stepping into the elevator and crowding Tony up against the wall, “no change you could undergo, and certainly no physical difference you could possibly have that would make me want you any less than I do.” He grins at Tony, half bashful and half wicked, and oh. Tony is in so, so much trouble. “I thought you knew how much that was, but clearly I’ve got work to do.”
Something about it makes his stomach curdle uncomfortably.
“I finished a book today.”
“Well, you have to remember that Gyrich has been linked to known Hydra sympathisers, Dana. I mean, if you want to talk about someone’s personal relationships affecting their policies, then I, well, I have to bring up that Hydra is listed as a neo-Nazi organisation by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and an international terrorist organisation by the U.S. Government, Interpol, and most countries worldwide. What does it mean that Gyrich has been linked to people who are––speaking non-hyperbolically––invested in eugenics, and is espousing anti-enhanced views as a member of the U.S. Government? Even without taking into account that he stands accused of actively furthering Hydra’s agenda, I mean. That’s what this investigation is all about, so of course it’s a transparent PR move on the part of the American government to put McCoy in after Gyrich was pulled out under such embarrassing circumstances.”
“Is that a threat?” Ross asks, but Tony just shakes his head.
“The SRF has been notified, and are en route,” Hill says, the first time he’s heard her voice all mission. She seems subdued, which Tony credits entirely to Pepper. Maybe Rhodey had a point. “News reports seem overall favourable thus far, but you know how people feel about The Hulk. And it’s not even dawn yet.”
“You-” Tony tried, then stopped. He reached a hand out, shaking, two fingers reaching towards Steve’s throat-
Steve had always thought he’d go out in a blaze of glory. He always had in the past. And he didn’t mind it, so much, dying for the right reasons; saving the world from Thanos, or Onslaught, or Korvac. He’d always died standing up for what he thought was right, side by side with his friends.
“Tony, you are not at all squeamish about killing people that you feel are an unconscionable threat to your family, this country, or the world. Hasegawa was a threat to you, and you are our family.”
That night, Steve went back to his room and pulled up whatever books and documentaries he could find on the sexual revolution. He learned about birth control, and blockers, and Anita Hill. He read the court briefs for the ERA and Title IX. The more he read, the quicker the ball of anxious confusion in his stomach turned to lead. He’d tried to get Tony to Submit—now called showing Obeisance—to him in a professional environment, which was
“I’m eating,” Tony protests. Reluctantly, Steve agrees. Tony isn’t doing anything any more self-destructive than usual. It’s like the grief is a parasite, eating him from the inside. There’s another animal that lives behind Tony’s eyes, now: something hunted and unclean and hungry. “I dunno what to tell you. I just…”
“Hah,” Steve mutters. He rubs a hand through his hair, watching where Tony’s fallen asleep against his worktop, his head pillowed on his folded arms.
Steve quirks a smile. JARVIS knows them all too well. “Smoothies with a smattering of motor oil?”
Tony picks up his glass, then puts it down again, hard enough that a wave of amber liquid slops over his trembling fingers. He reaches up with his free hand and scrubs it through his hair, frustrated, angry. Steve wants to fix this, but he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to get to where he wants to be from where they’ve landed.
Uuuuugh I struggled with this so much so sorry that it's being posted a little late. I feel like I'm dissatisfied with the ending. But I don't want to bias anyone towards it, so that's all I'll say haha. Maybe it's just that I've been staring at this chapter on and off for two whole weeks and I don't know what's good anymore...
“You think Stark wouldn’t kill someone if he was pushed to it?” Clint scoffs. “News, Cap: he
“Captain Rogers,” she says, raising her eyebrows. “You do not have an appointment.”
“You not asking me about why I left him in Lagos doesn’t make any sense!” Steve says, throwing up his hands, but Tony is shaking his head because he’s sure, now.
“Last time Amora was in my head for ten seconds, I assaulted you.” Tony opens his mouth, ready to argue, but Steve isn’t having any of it. “I need to make sure-…I need to make sure. So yes. I’ll submit myself for review.”
"Steve," Tony says tiredly. "It was the magic equivalent of a video chat. Don't overanalyse it."
“Alpha,” he sobbed, and Tony’s fingertips curled viciously into the meat of Steve’s arse, hard enough to bruise. “
“Steve?” there’s the tell-tale pad of footsteps across the mats, then the transition of Tony’s feet stepping onto the rubber floors. Tony’s head appears around the open doorway to the gym. “What are you doing?”
warnings: canon-typical violence,
“This is bad,” Pepper says, breaking Tony’s train of thought, and he turns back to her with a frown.
, Tony thinks wildly.
“Not all laws are just,” Steve counters as he passes Mount Sinai.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Put the Talenti back in the freezer and fuck me,” he said, and Tony’s eyes darkened beautifully.
Tony eyed him, speculative. “Can you come back over here, now?”
“You shouldn’t skip your run because of me,” Tony says, and Steve sighs into his ear. It’s enough to send all the blood in his body straight to his cock. His heart falters a half-step in his chest. “You like routine. I know you. It’ll just make you keyed-up and unbearable later.”
“I’m not joking!”
“Yeah, well.” Steve cleared his throat. “We both know that was mutual.”
“Of course,” JARVIS says smoothly. “If you would make your way down to the communal kitchen, Captain, I believe there is a jar in the pantry.”
Rogers raised an arm, inviting. “That’s what I said, isn’t it?”
But Steve doesn’t
"Evening, Stark. Or should I say morning?"
Steve lets out a slightly hysterical laugh. “Franklin Richards, you
“Loki’s like your mother?” Tony asks, as much curiosity as he is attempting to avoid Thor’s questions. Thor smiles at him, a wry thing that says that Tony is absolutely transparent, but he folds his arms across the back of the couch with jovial ease.
“Oh God,” Rhodey mutters under his breath. Tony can appreciate the sentiment; he badly wants a drink.
“Amora will be more of a problem than you think,” Loki says, sounding irritated. Tony turns to smile sweetly at him.
“You are the best thing about the future,” Steve blurts out, because that’s what he’d meant. That’s what he was trying to say, what he’s wanted to tell Tony for so long. “Tony, you- I couldn’t have made it this far, without you. I was so far off the deep end I didn’t realise I was in the damn water, and you found me. You pulled me out. You saved all of us.”
“Rogers!” The wind stole his voice, whipping the sound away from him as he turned his head, seeking. “Sheriff? Sheriff Rogers!”
“It is as your Captain says,” Loki says. His eyes are flashing, all the fur on his body standing on end. He growls, almost as if he cannot help it. “Thor is unharmed.”
One of Loki’s hands slides down his chest, grazing the soft skin beneath his navel, and Tony pulls back enough to gasp a breath. Loki’s eyes are blown, green a thin ring around black pupil, and Tony hisses as he leans in and bites at the corner of his jaw, sucking a bruise beneath Tony’s left ear. His fingers trace maddening lines around the top of Tony’s waistband, and Tony squirms a little and cards his fingers through Loki’s hair, dragging his nails down Loki’s spine. Loki arches into him, their legs tangling, and Tony swallows and turns to suck on his earlobe.
“Harpy.” He settles back, eyes aching from the lack of proper sleep. He’s always better at staying awake when it’s a proper all-nighter, the adrenalin keeping him steady throughout the day, or even longer if necessary. His body, accustomed to sleeping when it can and getting as much as possible out of it, always responds especially poorly to a small snatch of sleep at a reasonable hour. He prefers to sleep like the dead or not at all, and to have that interrupted messes with his ability to function. Between that and the conversation he’d had with Steve yesterday, he’s in no condition to do anything.
Steve crawled up obediently and took Tony’s mouth in a claiming kiss, sweeping his tongue in to tease out Tony’s. The noise Tony made was nothing short of utter satisfaction, and Steve moaned quietly into Tony’s mouth at the sound of it, fucking his fist properly now.
Bruce sighs behind them. “I was kind of looking forward to a team Movie Night.”
“Steve?” he whispers.
“I’m always putting my foot in my mouth,” Tony murmurs, and Steve barks out a rough laugh. “You and me both. We’re like millipedes made of left feet. And regret. And UST.”
He’d ducked out with an apology and waited in the bedroom, and when Tony came out everything was fine between them. Tony seemed to feel that Steve had chosen to respect his body and his wishes, and damn if that didn’t make Steve feel like the lowest piece of shit when he thought about it now. Tony always thought he was so much better than he was. He had no idea how no one had seen what a conniving, sarcastic, shithead he could be. Bucky had known, and that’s what Steve missed more than anything, he thought now. He missed that feeling of someone knowing exactly what he was, down to his bones, and loving everything: the grit, and the shit, and the nasty bits. Tony loved him for what he could be, for the best parts of him, for how they fit together to make a better whole. Bucky had loved the vindictive, violent bits of him just as much as his kindness. Tony made him a better man. Steve knew that, believed that as much as any religious edict he’d ever learned. But sometimes, Steve wished he could have both.
“We can ask him how his tech works when we take him down,” Clint says, waving a pot sticker. “How do we take him down without him killing Tony, exactly?”
It would be too simple, if a few scans were enough to uncover the secret of Steve’s death. He hadn’t expected them to.
“Oh my god, how bad was Steve’s face,” he whispers, and Jarvis helpfully pulls up the security footage on the windowpanes in order to provide Tony with a crystal clear, life-sized view. He looks…wrecked, actually. Tony turns around.
“Everyone just shut up for a second,” he snaps, backing up until his spine hits the end of the U shaped bar, and that’s-
“I’d like to hear you articulate it.”
“Holy fucking mother of God,” Tony gasps, and he has half a second to appreciate the smug quirk to Steve’s mouth until it is absolutely otherwise occupied. “Oh my
“Tony,” Pepper began, sounding exasperated, and the entire room burst into laughter.
“Y’know, when I said you were going to haunt me, I didn’t mean it this literally.”
Tony much prefers spending time with Bruce. He’s been examining the Chitauri and trying to understand how their hive-minds link up with their command ships. He’s also spent a fair amount of time on video calls with Jane, talking about whatever it is physicists get excited about in the wake of an intergalactic invasion: Einstein-Rosen Bridges, and unstable wormholes, and lots of things that Tony doesn’t want to talk about because they make his chest feel tight and his head spin. On those days, he goes down to Pepper’s office and lets her drag him around to talk to whatever investor or board member or client most needs to see his face. The normalcy of it is soothing, and Pepper doesn’t ask once about Steve, because she’s still hurting from their unspoken, undiscussed, and entirely predictable breakup. They’re just friends and co-workers. Everything is normal. For once in his long, ridiculous life, Tony kind of appreciates normal. He never thought he’d see the day.
“Well, I suspect that she thinks you’re friends, too, actually.”
“I was created to serve Sir,” JARVIS says, voice uncharacteristically robotic, but Steve shakes his head. He knows JARVIS will be watching from every camera.
“It makes me uncomfortable that I didn’t notice you getting into bed, but that’s me being mad at myself,” Tony says, too close to sleep for anything but brutal honesty. He pads to the bathroom and turns on the tap, washes his face of sleep sand and the accumulated oil that somehow always appears on his skin after too long sedentary. Eventually, Loki pads into the bathroom, swathed in Tony’s Egyptian cotton, hair a tangled mess.
“Please what?” Tony asks. He leans back, spreading his free hand over Steve’s ass and pulling him open for the camera. “Gimme a colour, baby.”
