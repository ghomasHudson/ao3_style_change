Dean flexes his hips, grinding up against Castiel and relishing the tight squeeze around his cock. His eyes scan the broad expanse of lean muscle, trailing up across his firm stomach and toned chest, admiring that single freckle at the edge of pert nipple before his eyes finally skim over Cas’ perfectly muscled shoulders and finally, finally, that chiseled jaw and those fierce blue eyes. How did Dean ever get so lucky to draw this Angel’s attention?
“Dean, please. Your mouth….” Cas’ pleas morph into a drawn out moan when Dean finally opens and takes the head of Cas’ cock into his mouth with a harsh suck. His tongue circles Cas’ slit, gently probing before sweeping across the underside to rub against the vein to be found there.
“Open the door for me?” Cas wraps the bat back up in the blanket and cradles the bundle gently in his hands as he pushes to his feet. Belatedly, he remembers he’s still completely nude but he pushes that thought aside in favor of disposing of the bat and going back to sleep.
Dean nods. “Ready to get this over with so Cas and me can get some alone time.” Dean’s grin softens when he rakes his gaze over Castiel and Cas wants to go him so badly.
Now, it’s Castiel’s turn to laugh, and Dean bristles adorably. “I wouldn’t dream of it.” He squeezes Dean’s hand to add weight to the words he carefully chooses. “Nature would not have blessed me with a mate who is any less than my equal.”
Cas grinds in slow circles before rising up until the head of Dean’s cock tugs on his rim and dropping down hard enough to shake the bed as he moans with satisfaction.
Cas gives a jerky nod along with his needy whine. He could lose himself in the shining depths of Dean’s eyes, wide and unguarded with desire, his lips are kiss swollen and shining from Castiel’s attention.
A huge bed takes up most of the space, unmade and absolutely perfect for what he has in mind. His nimble fingers finish the work he started on Dean’s jeans as Dean takes a moment to tug his shirt over his head.
Cas lets out a rush of air through his nose and nods. “You did,” He agrees with a nod. “But I don’t care about that anymore.”
Dean chuckles and stares at the card. “Castiel James Novak, Ph.D. Castiel, huh?” His eyes dance with amusement as Cas squirms.
Dean’s gaze flits to Cas before scowling at the woman. “Mind your own business,” he grumbles with a glare to rival Sam’s best bitch face. “Cas, I thought you were gonna...” He trails off with a wave of his hand and quirks a brow as Cas nods.
He watches with wide eyes as Cas tears open the foil packet and unrolls the condom over Dean’s cock with practiced ease, barely taking time to add some lube to the mix before he scoots into place and lines himself up.
Cas lets out a bitter laugh and turns away. “Leave me alone, Inias,” Cas says through clenched teeth. Dean thinks Inias would be better for him?
Cas’ mouth stretches in a slow smile as he tugs Dean forward and smashes their mouths together in a bruising kiss that Dean gives himself over to immediately. They press together and the rest of the world disappears as Dean’s back hits the wall once again. He doesn’t care how the rough brick catches and pulls the fine material of his tuxedo jacket. That thing Cas is doing with his tongue is far more important.
Castiel beams, his heart nearly exploding with how much it swells with adoration and well, Pride. “I’m sure they would jump at the opportunity to have you.”
“Are you sure?” Cas bumps Dean’s shoulder and offers him a forgiving smile. He doesn’t want to make Dean uncomfortable or cause him troubles.
Cas is breathtaking with his head thrown back in pleasure, the long column of his throat stretched and tan against the stark white collar of his shirt. His fingers still hold Dean by the hair, although his touch is gentle and Dean can feel the warmth from Castiel’s grace pulsing through him and filling his heart to the brim.
Dean swallows thickly, watching Cas writhe and twist his hands in the sheets as the wax dribbles down the length of Castiel’s cock. The Angel bites his lower lip, eyes screwed tightly closed as he whimpers at the delicious pain. Castiel is beautiful like this, his desire for a taste of pain at Dean’s hands has the hunter’s stomach clenching with want his chest tightening with emotions that he never imagined he would have. “Cas” His voice cracks on the word as he shifts the candle, aiming for the slit of Castiel’s flushed and swollen cock.
Cas is not special. There is no way that Dean Winchester, of all people, sees anything special in him.
Breakfast continues with easy chatter and Cas answers simple questions about his studies and interests. John rolls his eyes when Dean and Cas delve into the fascinating history of Ancient Rome and spend ten minutes discussing just how terrible of a ruler Nero truly was.
Their discussion is quickly abandoned as the promise of freedom sinks in and Cas promises they can pick up where they’ve left off when they return from break before wishing them all a good week off.
The rest of the drive is spent with their hands clasped in the middle of the seat while Cas watches the lights of the city flashing by. It isn’t long until Dean pulls up behind the garage and cuts the engine, shrouding them in the type of silence that makes Castiel’s heart pound.
Cas’ palm rests warmly on at the dip of Dean’s spine, holding him close as Dean sucks in a heavy breath to calm his racing heart. “Cas,” Dean says, his voice coming out as a croak before he chases Cas’ lips with his own.
“Nothing much, just killing time waiting for you,” he says, his voice surprisingly steady despite the fluttering in his stomach.
“No,” Cas whispers, wanting to explain. “Azazel came, I…I was scared,” Cas says, words slow and awkward as he does his best not to struggle against Dean’s hold.
Cas looks down at his phone after his final student has filed out of the room and his head tilts as he considers. A moment too long passes before he’s hitting the button to add the number to his contacts.
He draws Dean into a messy kiss, rubbing his still hard dick over Dean’s thigh. Dean’s tongue probes into Castiel’s mouth, chasing his own taste on his angel’s tongue as he grinds against the hard line of Castiel’s cock, seeking to provide friction for the other man. He’d known his feet being touched felt amazing, but he had never imagined just how mind-blowing a foot massage induced orgasm could be. “That was amazing” He breathes against Cas’ throat, holding his lover tightly to him and encouraging Cas to grind against his body. He can tell his Angel is close, his ragged breathing and twitching cock are sure signs that Cas is chasing his orgasm as he writhes against Dean.
Yes, Dean thinks. He could come from just this. Cas scratches the fine edge his nail, ever so lightly, along the undersides of his toes and Dean barks a laugh as his dick leaks a glob of precome onto his belly. He could definitely come from this.
Dean shakes his head. “He’s a pain in the ass, sure,” Dean says with a smirk. “But he’s my pain the ass now.”
Cas straddles Dean’s thighs, his cock bobbing excitedly between them as he drags Dean into a messy kiss. “You ready?” Castiel asks, nipping at Dean’s lips as he sterilizes the sound with his grace. Dean nods, fumbling with the cap to the lube.
Cas waves him off with a scowl of disgust. There are certain things that brothers do not need to know about each other and Gabriel has never been shy about sharing that unwanted information. It’s one of the reasons he made a point to never introduce Gabriel to his boyfriends.
Cas’ heaving breaths slow and his pulse skitters and flutters for a reason other than fear as he breathes in the faint scent that is uniquely
Cas hums in consideration as he continues to stroke, tightening the tunnel of his hand expertly as he presses the tip of his thumb against Dean’s slit. “I love touching you, watching you come undone,” Cas mutters as he squeezes around the reddening head of Dean’s cock. “In all my years of existence, I have never seen a creation more beautiful, more incredible.”
“I want to tie you down” Cas purrs, coaxing Dean to rest his cheek against his thigh. Dean hums at the grounding touch and settles in closer. “I want to play with your cock until you beg for release with tears streaming down your cheeks” He rubs a thumb over Dean’s cheek for emphasis. “And once I finally give you what you want, I want to keep going until you either come a second time or use your safe word”
Cas feels a pang of guilt for his veiled question, but Dean’s childhood has been a topic that Castiel has avoided. He doesn’t know how to explain who he is or if that would matter to Dean at all.
So, for the next half hour, Dean tries to make a list. The occasional glance upward and across the table makes it appear that Castiel is having an easy time with the lists. Dean can see half a page of notes in Cas’ careful scrawl on one page and very little on the other. Dean can guess which page is which.
“I’m going to see what I can do,” Cas whispers before leaning forward to press their lips together again.
Samuel hums and nods with a frown. “You do realize this will hinder our relationship with my brother. He already seeks to unseat me, and therefore you. Do you think our family will not face consequences?”
Cas’s lip twitches. He suspected shame wasn’t part of the problem but that horrid little voice in the back of his mind refuses to let the idea go. “I wouldn’t blame you if you were. I’m a whore with no family, I don’t even have proper identification to get a real job.”
He smiles at the thought, considering how far they’ve come and how far they might travel yet. But, the old tie is not what Dean is looking for and he sets it aside with a soft smile
Dean’s smile softens and he nods. “Yes, ma’am. I intend to take good care of him,” Dean says as he lifts their hands and presses a kiss to the back of Cas’ knuckles like it’s the most natural thing in the world for him to do.
When Dean had tried to explain, Cas had bandied around words Dean didn’t understand, his tone sounding as if seeking retribution was a crime. In a fit of confusion, Dean had silenced Cas’ argument with a needy kiss and the two lost track of time entwined with one another.
It’s only after they hang up and Dean is trudging down the steps to the garage that he realizes one very important thing about having Cas stay the weekend.
“I was thinking we could order room service. The hotel has a great kitchen, and I want to have you to myself tonight.” Dean squeezes his hand and gestures toward the door with his chin as Benny checks the hallway for stragglers.
Once the rope is undone, he drops his arms against the surface of the water and glares down at his sodden robes. They too must go but Cas’ lower lip juts out in annoyance as he considers the ramifications of being undressed entirely.
Sam stays at Dean’s side, as a good brother should, knocking aside monks who beg and plead with them in a language that brings only the tickle of a memory but little understanding.
His mess is added to Dean’s, wet, sticky, and enticing across Dean’s abs and pooling in his belly button. He can’t remember coming so forcefully, ever, and the debauched sight of Dean below him is enough to make his cock valiantly try for more.
John looks like he’s swallowed a lemon when Mary gestures for him to come inside and Dean looks to Cas with wide eyes.
“But I haven’t done anything to deserve it, I can’t pay them back…” Cas shakes his head, eyes growing wider by the second.
His rhythm falters at the thought, uncertainty pushing its way in but Dean pulls his hand back and rakes his nails over the skin of Cas’ back instead.
“No, listen,” Meg shushes him. “You’ve done so much for me and I love you so much, but I want you to do one more thing.”
Sam bypasses them entirely and settles on the other side of Castiel. “Cas? What was that about?” He asks with a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
Cas shifts the phone into his other hand and turns away from Dean. “No. Yes. Chuck isn’t crazy,” Cas says before turning his head to look at Dean over his shoulder. “Yeah, he’s right here,” Cas says with a tender smile as he turns back around and pulls the screaming phone from his ear. “Anna would like to speak with you.”
Cas sighs and drops his head back against the tree he’s been leaning on for what feels like hours. The admission dancing on the tip of his tongue burns in his throat and stings his eyes.
“You hurt him and I will destroy you,” Charlie whispers menacingly in his ear and Cas somehow doesn’t doubt her. “I mean it. I can make you wish you were never born.”
Tessa is a formidable woman and Balthazar was very drunk. She would have wiped the floor with him if Billie hadn’t swooped in and interfered.
Dean can’t help but stare. Cas is bare before him and they’re surrounded by the familiar scent of home. Well-loved leather, a hint of gun oil and engine grease. Dean has lived his life in this car, and he can’t imagine a more perfect sight than his loved ones tucked safely inside.
“That’s why the Pride celebration is so important to me, Dean. I want you to be there.” He’s not going to beg. He refuses. He just wants Dean to agree to come.
Dean’s phone chooses that moment to ring, the basic pre-set tone cutting through the air and forcing them both to take a step back. “I’m on my way, Charlie,” Dean answers as he stares at Cas with wide eyes. “I
His lips part and his breath catches when Dean’s eyes open and Cas loses himself in the endless green staring back at him while Dean sings about blue being the most breathtaking color he’s ever seen.
The sun is beginning to sink in the sky and Dean directs Castiel to the kitchens to work, saying that he needs to speak with Benny.
Dean’s cock strains and protests against the unwelcome pressure as he tries to will himself into relaxing against the mattress. Cas will make this worth the trouble.
“Mr. Winchester, it’s a pleasure to meet you. And you, Dr. Novak,” The man greets as he holds out his hand to Dean and then Castiel. “My name is Elijah Farrow, I’m a writer slash photographer for California Home and Design.”
“Yes,” Cas cuts him off. “Hell, yes.” His hands drift down Dean’s back to cup his ass and haul him forward, pressing their half-hard dicks together. Lightening skitters down his spine and makes his heart race when he takes in Dean’s lust-drunk gaze. “Bedroom?”
Dean’s head sags on his shoulders and his legs tremble with unmet desire. His cock protests pitifully when Cas pulls out and drags his thumb through the mess already leaking from Dean’s ass. “Fuck” Dean whines, nearly crying as Cas circles his rim with that thumb, collecting the little bit of come and breaching him as he pushes the mess back inside. “Cas” He whimpers, giving himself over to the full body tremble he’s been fighting since Cas bent him over the table.
It would be perfect if the shrill tone of Castiel’s ringtone wasn’t suddenly cutting through the room.
“They met in Italy,” Sam says, ever so helpfully with a tongue in cheek tone. Dean sends him a glare and both his parents give him a questioning look.
Michael nods and glances sideways with a frown. “I drove down with Luke,” he says with a wrinkled nose.
Cas settles next to Dean and leans into his side with an arm wrapped around his shoulders. “I’m sorry you had to go through that.” He doesn’t know what else he can say. He wants to promise that Dean will never have to go through that again, but that could very well be a lie. The fact that Dean is in a homosexual relationship now would make him more acceptable in bigoted eyes, but pointing that out would not be helpful.
Tears run from the corners of Dean’s eyes like rivers as he continues to plead. Dean is horrified and impressed when his cock makes a valiant effort at hardening once more but he just doesn’t have it in him. “I can’t” Dean sobs, turning his head to avoid Castiel’s intense stare. He sniffles against the pillow, still adamantly refusing to say the one word that he knows will end his.
“Cas,” Dean says, stepping into Cas’s space and placing a hand on the wall beside him as he strokes Cas’s cheek with the other. “Look at me, please.”
Dean had been in a hurry to dress when Cas returned to the room from studying with Sam, the briefest glimpse of skin obscured before Cas’ cheeks could flush.
“That fills you up nicely” Dean can hear the smile in Castiel’s voice. “Now, I need to check your reflexes”
Dean sips his coffee and considers, staring at the list while wracking his brain. His gaze keeps drifting back to creampie but he can’t help but feel that it’s just too common to fill the kinktober requirements.
“What do you suggest we do, then?” Cas tries to change the subject before he shoves a giant forkful of spaghetti into his mouth to keep from saying something stupid.
Once the cool water reaches his knees, Dean heaves himself into the boat and takes his place at the helm. His scrutinizing gaze sweeps over his people and the newly acquired slaves. They are all under Dean’s leadership now. The weight of responsibility sits heavy across his shoulders but he accepts the burden as the inevitable consequence of picking up his father’s sword so many years ago. He was groomed to lead from that point forward, maybe even from the moment he was born.
“Very well,” Samuel dismisses. “Do with him as you will and bring the rest of the treasures to our hold,” Samuel waves his hand in an easy dismissal of the three men and Dean wastes no time in grasping Castiel’s elbow and hauling him to his feet.
, are essential to a healthy eco-system.” Cas retorts, glaring all the while as he gestures to his yard with a sweep of his hand. “They deserve as much care as any other living thing.”
Dean crawls over him, knees spreading Cas’ legs to that he can settle into the space in between as he draws Cas into a soul-deep kiss. Cas surges up to meet him, gasping as their hard cocks touch and press hot against each other.
Cas has never come to his door and he hasn’t tried to reach out to Dean since their ill-fated lunch.
“Dressed like that?” Dean arches a brow before he shakes his head. “Sorry, sorry. I don’t mean to question you.”
Castiel nods his agreement, watching Dean with single-minded focus. “We are learning a lot about each other, yes”
Dean swallows hard, his mouth going dry. “No, Cas. I haven’t heard of it” His focus is intent on the food in front of him and he’s certain his blush has made it to the tips of his ears. Warm hands settle firmly on his hips and Dean stiffens. This thing between them isn’t exactly new, but Dean still hasn’t quite come to terms with the amount of physical affection that Castiel freely gives. Sam could walk in any minute looking for dinner and then where would they be? “Cas?” Dean croaks, fighting a shiver of desire born from his Angel’s touch.
Cas wants the ground to swallow him when Dean turns to him with an arched brow. Cas shakes his head. “Nothing I haven’t already told you.”
When Dean stretches his lips around Cas’ cock, he wastes no time in sinking down as far as he can go without the help of Cas’ grace.
Cas grins into Dean’s hair. “Thank you” he mumbles against the soft locks tickling his nose before pressing a gentle kiss to Dean’s temple.
Dean’s cheeks heat and he drops his gaze when he feels Cas slips their hands together. “Dean?” Cas asks again and Dean pulls away.
Cas pauses the motion of his hands, stilling them near the base of Dean’s neck and gives a gentle hum. “I see” He mutters before continuing his gentle prodding along the column of Dean’s neck, much like an actual doctor checking for swollen lymph nodes. “Any discomfort when I do this” He presses slightly firmer and Dean mumbles an easy no.
“Got enough sexy right here,” Dean mutters against Cas’ skin as he trails kisses across Cas’ jaw and down the column of his throat.
“Dean,” Cas complains, his words muffled and slurred through the foam filling his mouth. “M’ tryin to brush my teeth.”
Dean picks up the headphones and turn the noise cancelling feature on before placing them snugly over Cas’ ears, plunging the Angel into silence. He lets out a deep breath then, when Cas can no longer hear his nervousness escape. Dean runs his hands lightly down Castiel’s arm, watching the man jump and shiver at the sudden contact. Dean smiles, trying to channel what little remains of the Demon version of himself to satisfy his lover.
“Nothing, Dean. He was just talking.” Cas waves away Dean’s concern in hopes that he’ll move on from the subject.
Dean’s heart still flutters wildly and he thinks that he might very well be sick from almost dying just now but he still nods. “I see that,” He says dryly. He is not convinced.
He types out his response and sends it before he can convince himself to tell Dean he’d like to be his for a lot longer than the next week.
Cas’ eyes track his movement and his frown deepens when he notices how brown the white flowers of the clover around Dean have dulled and browned. “Were you using herbicides?” Cas grates, eyes narrowed as he meets Dean’s startled gaze.
Cas silently ties Dean’s wrists to the slats of the headboard with silken rope and runs light fingertips down the length of Dean’s spine, stopping only when the waistband of his boxers impede his progress.
“So, Bobby says you’re doing good?” Sam hedges, his tone asking far more than his words might suggest. Curiosity gleams in his eyes the same as it always has and Dean can’t help but smile at the familiarity.
Cas blinks open his eyes and smiles around his mouthful before swallowing hard. “This makes me very happy.” He grins and butterflies swarm in Dean’s stomach.
Alfie lets out a sad sigh and shakes his head. “Oh, Castiel. Inias has mooned over you for years now. Have you never noticed his favor?”
“I’m having a little trouble getting the hives onto the blocks, I was hoping you might be able to give me a hand for a few minutes?” Cas asks, glancing toward the new hives with his bottom lip held tight between his teeth.
Alright, so this is the end of this glimpse into their lives but I feel like there is still more to tell. One particular part of Cas' past has been bothering me and I have another idea for a timestamp set a few years in the future to address that topic. I might start writing it soon to kill time before NanoWrimo but I can't make any promises.
“Hello Dean” A deep gravelly voice comes from nearly directly behind him and strong hands grasp his hips. Dean jumps in surprise and spins to face the Angel, nearly slipping on the smooth tile in the process.
A day spent gathering information has left Dean on edge and his energy strains at the seams with the intense desire to feel the vibrations of one sword striking another. He needs this.
“We’ll see if you’re still saying that in a year,” Dean says playfully as he shoves at Cas’ shoulder and knocks him to the mattress.
He straightens his back with a groan and presses his shoulders against the back of his seat, trying to relieve the ache in his spine from being cast through a wall of rotted drywall.
“Okay,” Dean says, tone firm with the power of his conviction as he stretches himself over Cas to reach into the drawer of his nightstand.
Dean pulls off Cas with an audible pop and ignores his protesting knees when he pushes to his feet. The man bound in front of him is captivating and Dean can feel the dark abandon that had consumed him as a Demon creeping forward just enough to savor what Castiel is giving him.
The night passes tortuously slow, Dean’s mood only darkened by the gloom around him. Eventually, he forces his thoughts to turn away from Cas and onto the battle ahead.
Getting inside is easy once they pay the fees and sign the various agreements about behavior and confidentiality. The dungeon master is happy to direct them to the special rooms in the back where they can watch and learn, their honest curiosity seems to be very welcome among the few people who talk to them.
A flash of bright blue eyes and messy dark hair forms in his mind. Dean had been the one who nearly loosed his arrow, mistaking the monk’s brown robes for the hide of a deer. Had the man not turned when he had, Dean surely would have ended his life.
I'm going to add a chapter warning for those who may be sensitive to dub-con or non-con. It isn't, but I feel the situation could still be triggering to some people.
“So you’re the one who helped him cheat?” Dean cocks his head and smiles as if nothing in the world is wrong.
“Uh, Dean?” Sam stops in his tracks, eyeing the pile of books surrounding his brother with suspicion. “You ok?”
Benny leans back in his chair with his arms crossed over his chest. “We got two options. The green room TV, or smack dab in the middle of the front row. We got a roped off area for the cameras, plenty of space for the two of us.”
Dean smirks. He has no idea what 174 is supposed to mean but Sam seems happy with it so he will be too. “That’s great Sammy, you always were the smart one.”
That will never do. Urgency overcomes him and his breath comes in short bursts as his practiced fingers work to undo Dean’s buckle and button.
He lets out a shaky breath and shakes his head as he replaces the brick and double-checks his surroundings.
Balthazar is leaning against his office door when Cas trudges up the stairs to collect his trench coat. “I thought you were going to stand me up.” He arches his brow and moves so Cas can unlock the door.
A tear escapes from the corner of Cas’s eye and he tries to blink it away as he shakes his head. “I’m not gonna leave you.” Even if he wanted to, he doesn’t know how he would pick up the pieces and carry on with his life. He and Meg have clung to each other for years, his entire adult life, she’s been there for him. Helped him keep his head above water when he would have easily drowned.
Dean shivers again, wanton need pulsing through him at the sight of Cas staring at him with menace in his gaze. “I’m sorry, Sir.” Dean does his absolute best to sound contrite and he must succeed because Cas’ glare softens.
Cas nods and Dean takes that as his cue to continue. He can read the nervous set of Cas’ shoulders easily and he would do anything to ease his mind. “How about we stop at a restaurant and I’ll tell Sam to meet us there? Do you know of a place?” Dean asks softly. He doesn’t know where
“I want,” Dean starts but shakes his head and takes a deep breath. “I want you to… I want you to fuck
Cas’s smile feels a little less forced as his eyes roll of their own accord and he shakes his head. “Uh-huh, sure,” Cas says, just to make the corners of Gabriel’s lips twitch upward. “Let me see your hands and turn your pockets out. I will not have you tormenting my fiancé.”
“What house are you in?” She asks, arching a brow like he’s supposed to have a clue what she’s talking about.
Dean’s eyes light up and he shakes off his stupor with an excited grin. “Come on, before Sam eats all the pancakes.”
With a single quick swing, Alastair’s head rolls away from his body and Dean stares at the bleeding corpse for a moment before turning his back and walking away. The others will bury Alastair with his head placed between his knees as a sign to the gods of an unworthy soul.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says with a shrug. “But ice cream melts and fills in all the gaps. So there’s always room.”
Cas follows as soon as the first streaks of Dean’s come paint his chest, Dean making good on his promise of milking Cas dry as they work through the aftershocks together until Dean all but collapses against Cas’ chest with an exhausted laugh.
He kisses Dean deeply, running a hand down the man’s chest to skate his fingertips across Dean’s still soft dick. “Cas” Dean protests weakly but Cas shushes him with a pleading look.
Dean has been malcontent with many of his Jarl’s policies for many years and this is the first step he can take toward changing some of them.
“Will none of you defend yourselves?!” He shouts at their retreating backs as he strides forward, intending to enter the towering stone building with Sam and Benny at his side. His Jarl’s goal, Dean’s test, is to lead this raid and pillage for gold and other treasures to add to his family’s wealth.
Cas hums and his stroking of Dean’s back continues. “The ones I think might interest you are begging, ass worship and medical play” He purposefully leaves off watersports, knowing that Dean would have no interest partaking in that particular kink.
He’s had to field more autographs than he would have preferred, and once had to kick a reporter out of his classroom, but for the most part, nothing has changed.
His heart skips a beat in mild horror. No one but him has touched those keys since the hospital handed over his Dad’s possessions when he finally showed up to claim them. He can’t just trust his Baby to someone else without good cause but Cas’s fingers close around the cool metal before Dean can think the problem to death.
He goes woodenly where Dean puts him, but the moment they’re both on the couch, Cas is melting into Dean’s side like he was made to fit there and he gently pries the paper with Gabriel’s information from Dean’s hand. “So this is it,” Cas stares at the simple piece of lined notebook paper, torn from a larger page and folded roughly. “What if he doesn’t want to talk to me?”
Dean catches Sam’s gaze and immediately recognizes the determined look on his face. “What’d you do, Sam. Where are they?” Dean storms over to his brother and glares, toe to toe.
“Night Cas” Dean yawns once more, wrapping an arm around his Angel and holding him tight. He’s long since moved past complaining about the little things Cas does for him. What do they matter, really? He’s perfectly happy to bask in Castiel’s warmth and drift off to sleep. So that is exactly what he does, knowing Cas will be here with him when he wakes.
He hopes that puts Dean’s mind at ease somewhat. If he even is speaking with the real Dean Winchester. Which he doubts.
Cas arches a questioning brow but does as requested, leaving one more kiss directly on Dean’s lips before dropping back to the mattress. “Shower then?”
Dean barely glances at their burgers before he nods with a polite smile. “Thank you, ma’am,” he says with a wink.
Cheers erupt around him and Sam’s booming voice demands compliance from Asmodeus’ followers but Dean has only one thing on his mind.
Thankfully, Dean smiles. “I’m Dean, nice to meet you, ma’am.” Dean pulls out his southern charm, letting an accent bleed into his tone so smoothly that Cas could swear it’s been there all along.
Cas’ cock is barely wider than the plug, but so much longer. The first drag against Dean’s prostate has him seeing stars. Cas had been avoiding that spot all day, denying Dean the earth-shattering pleasure that can be had from that simple stimulation. Dean cries out, fingers digging into Cas’ arms where he still holds the hunter’s legs open. He isn’t going to last long like this. “Cas” He whimpers, trembling as his cock leaks precome across his belly.
True to his promise, Cas emerges moments later. Dean pushes to his feet so quickly he nearly stumbles but he doesn’t care. He’s too busy taking in the dark jeans that hug Cas’ thick thighs perfectly and the fitted blue button-down that somehow, impossibly, makes his eyes bluer.
Dean shudders a breath, shoulders deflating as he nods. “You are everything to me” Cas kisses his way down Dean’s bare chest, laving his tongue over the small peak of Dean’s nipple before returning with a sharp nip. Dean jumps at the sensation and groans happily. His fingers tangle in Castiel’s dark hair, holding him in place.
“Cas!” Dean cries out, fucking into Cas’ fist as much as his bonds will allow as the crest of pleasure rushes through him. His eyes clench, fighting against the encroaching darkness as his cock spurts over Cas’ hand and onto the mat below.
Dean’s profile is genuinely interesting despite most of the information already being public knowledge, and now his short message seems direct and yet vulnerable between the lines.
“My brother,” he mutters darkly as he pushes himself up with his arms to scan the room for his phone.
“I don’t know why you’re still so embarrassed, Cassie. It was just a job.” Gabriel challenges. Cas knew something horrible was going to happen but he hadn’t thought that Gabe would pull the protective big brother card out so quickly and with such a twisted spin on the truth. “Although I am pretty sure it was the first time he saw a real-life hard-on.” Gabe cackles and Castiel shudders.
Dean is a little too quick, and a little bit rude, to dismiss Castiel's request to try sounding. Of course, he feels terrible about being a jerk and tries to make it up to his Angel.
When Jess chimed in, talking about frogs and habitat desiccation, Dean stared across the table at the beer bottle that Bobby was taking a possessive swig from before he rolled his eyes and muttered about
portion of safe, sane, and consensual. And I wouldn’t be touching your sub without both of your permissions.”
Dean’s fingers return to the sharp edge of Castiel’s jaw and Cas’ eyes slide closed at the touch. His stomach flutters pleasantly with anticipation but he remains still. “Please,” Dean whispers.
Cas’ tentative smile turns real and a snort of laughter escapes and Dean’s expression turns scandalized.
Cas nods weakly and sucks in a deep breath as he brushes his fingers against Dean’s, asking permission.
“Mine” Dean growls as he shoves Cas’ slacks and underwear from his hips in one smooth motion. Cas gasps when Dean pulls their bare bodies together from chest to knees and spins Cas back towards the bed. Their hard cocks slide together and they both gasp at the sensation, pressing closer together. Cas follows Dean’s lead willingly, blue eyes wide and brilliant against the black fabric of his mask as he steps backward. Dean narrows his eyes into a predatory stare as he drinks in the sensation of Castiel’s hard and weeping cock leaving a trail of wetness against his thigh. “On the bed” He orders, pitching his voice low and demanding to match the mask he wears.
“Damn right.” Dean leans closer and presses a quick kiss to Cas’ cheek before he reaches for his wine glass.
“Tell me what?” Dean asks through clenched teeth as he struggles to sit up. The endeavor proves to be more than he cares to manage and he gives up, settling flat against the bed and eyeing his brother impatiently.
The thought of wearing it now, when Dean believes the band to be lost, feels entirely too revealing for reasons Cas doesn’t care to think too deeply on.
” Cas gestures to himself with a scowl that only deepens when Dean laughs. “I’m surprised this ‘tuxedo’”, Cas says using finger quotes, “wasn’t invented during the Inquisition.”
Cas chews his lip and nods as he shifts downward, trying to get that one small part of Dean inside him.
Benny has ignored him since that first night and Cas wonders why. He had offered him water and unbound him. Oddly, Dean hadn’t seemed surprised or concerned when he roused from his sleep to find Castiel’s hands free and Cas wonders if Dean hadn’t told Benny to release him.
“When are we meeting your friends?” Cas asks, injecting a little too much innocence into his tone for Dean to not find suspicious.
Dean pales and swallows thickly as he glances toward the cleaning station they passed on the way in. “I don’t know how,” Dean says, pleading with his eyes for a way out.
Cas shrugs as Dean squawks indignantly enough to make Cas lose patience for the mild horror etched over Gabriel’s features. “Compared to the dumpster I was living behind until a few months ago, this is luxury.”
Dean sees no reason to refuse to him. A faint smile twitches at the corner of Dean’s mouth as he steps forward. This monk is brave, and Dean can appreciate that about him. “Very well,” Dean says slowly with a slight nod of acceptance. He gives Benny a small wave, indicating the volunteers, and the man quickly springs into action along with several other of the Viking warriors.
“You two are disgusting,” Crowley interjects, making a sour face but his eyes are warm. “So you met for coffee. How long ago was that?”
Not going to Cas wasn't even an option, not when he sounded so crushed and defeated. Everything else was going to have to wait.
Sam nods sheepishly and lets his hands hang at his sides. “Yes. The Greeks implemented a concept called Democracy, Dean. For over a hundred years they’ve, well, they
Cas huffs a disbelieving laugh and shakes his head before nodding. “Ok, just...tell me if I do something wrong.”
Castiel chokes on a sob as he stares at their feet and keeps as much space between them as Dean allows. Worried murmurs spread amongst the monks still bound next to the fire as Dean drags Castiel past, but Cas doesn’t lift his gaze to face them when they call his name.
“How can I tell if you’re ok when I can’t feel you clearly?” Cas asks and Dean knows the question is rhetorical. Sometimes their play gets a little rough, a little unconventional, and Cas is always careful to not push Dean anywhere near his limits. Cas’ expression darkens as he wraps the fingers of one hand around Dean’s now fully erect cock and squeezes almost too hard. Dean gasps and bucks into Cas’ grip but the Angel isn’t having it. Dean suddenly finds himself pinned to the cold shower wall with no chance of escape. Luckily, not a single cell in his body wants to escape. Cas’ hand roughly tugs on Dean’s erection and Dean keens in pleasure.
Benny steps in and hauls Dean to his feet and uses his body as a barricade to keep people from snapping photos of Dean while he’s still pale and trembling.
Sam laughs at something the raven-haired woman says and Dean watches as she walks away with a smile.
Even from this distance, Castiel sees Sam blanch and point to the spot Castiel had formally occupied and Dean’s razor-sharp glare follows Sam’s pointing finger.
Dean blinks, heart hammering in his chest as he stares at Castiel’s outstretched hand. Nearly every nerve ending in his body demands he hide his phone and refuse Cas’ simple demand, yet his traitorous hand slowly complies and hands over the phone.
Castiel’s mind reels as he waits for the right words to come. Of all the things Dean could have said, this is entirely unexpected and yet completely unsurprising. He knows, every alpha knows, that omegas have a superior sense of smell and are particularly attuned to scents of distress. He may not know Dean overly well, but the man is righteous.
A flash of fear crosses Dean's eyes but it’s quickly replaced by a needy moan and buck of his hips against Castiel’s thighs. Dean nods with a small smile as he prays to Cas.
Dean knew he was no match for an adult, he had only seen six summers, but he was determined to do as he was told and protect his brother or die trying.
If Dean has his way, Asmodeus will not touch any of the new slaves and neither will his sons. No one deserves the sadistic touch those three masterfully wield.
Marv, of course, scowls at him before woodenly thanking him for stepping in to protect Missy. To his credit, he only grumbles under his breath instead of shouting about the bloody mess and broken windows.
And yet, here he is. Sitting at Cas’ table, sipping Cas’ lemonade, about to eat Cas’ food. All because Cas is done taking no for an answer.
The oven beeps as he types out his answer and he sets the phone aside to open the pie and read the directions one more time, just to be sure.
Cas looks at Dean with a half-smile. “What, not tomorrow?” He teases, already mentally clearing his schedule for Sunday. He was only having dinner with Gabriel anyway, nothing he can’t cancel.
He immediately curses himself. His words make it sound like he was treating their meeting as a date. Something Cas made it clear he wasn’t looking for.
Dean pushes through the door and his eyes widen comically when his gaze finds Cas standing in the middle of the large room.
“So good for me, Dean,” Cas murmurs between kisses as he trails his way down Dean’s spine. Dean shivers when the wet point of Cas’ tongue traces the divots at the small of his back and he lets out a low whine when the attention suddenly stops. “I want you to relax. Can you do that for me?” Cas asks as he straddles Dean’s hips and settles his weight across Dean’s ass. His warm and slightly rough palms glide over Dean’s sides and shoulders, repeating the circuit until Dean’s ability to think putters to a complete halt.
Cas nods and whimpers when Dean’s fingers close around his hardness, hot and calloused from hours strumming his guitar strings. “Dean,” Cas gasps when Dean jacks him, squeezing around the head before sliding back down.
Cas scrunches his brows and frowns as he shakes his head. “I do not understand?” Cas tilts his head as he regards Dean, searching his expression for an answer. “Inias is my best friend and brother. Nothing you have done changes that.”
Crowley smirks. “So, tell me Squirrel, how did you and Cas, is it?” he looks to Cas for confirmation, “how did you and Cas meet?”
Dean sighs and continues. There is nothing to be gained by hiding his heritage in shame. He was chosen as heir and his village accepts him.
He’s badly injured, but he still should have been there to light the torch and send his father’s pyre adrift. Sam surely took his place, Samuel was surely sent off with honor, but tears burn behind Dean’s eyes when he considers that he failed in a son’s most sacred duty.
Dean sucks in a harsh breath and nods, separating from Cas just enough to link their fingers together and tug him over to where Dean’s family still stands. “Mom, Dad. This is Castiel Novak,” Dean says, waiting for one of them to implode. “He’s, uh, my boyfriend.” As if boyfriend is close to an adequate term for what Cas means to him.
Dean groans and drops his head back against the pillow. “You sneaky bastard,” Dean says through a huffed laugh.
John shakes his head. “Not if they know what’s good for them,” he says with a soft smile. “Just, try not to get caught alone with Samuel. Deanna is at least polite.”
They don’t part until Dean’s knees hit the edge of the bed and he’s forced to turn away just long enough to climb through the fluffy pile of white blankets, his robe catching on the soft cotton as he settles onto his back.
it. Warmth blooms in his chest even as his cock gives a demanding twitch in his panties. He feels claimed and cherished, privileged and powerful in a way that he never thought this would give him. He locks his gaze with Castiel’s as the other man leans forward, running a thumb through the mess he made and bringing it to Dean’s mouth.
Cas huffs and pulls his hand away, making Dean’s heart quicken and he does his best not to whimper. His eyes flutter open with a frown and he searches Cas’ expression, begging for an answer.
The thought of going back to the store fills him with dread that his skin crawling and his stomach clenching with despair.
Cas’ eyes narrow as he takes in John’s meaning and Dean blanches. “Do you think they’ll give us problems?” Cas asks, looking to John for answers.
Dean takes up Sam’s ax and heads for the stump where Benny and two others stand watch over Alastair before he can see the results of Sam’s explanation flash over Castiel’s features. He will avenge the monk’s pain, and he is proud to do so.
Dean’s brows arch and he nods in admiration. “They were very impressive. My name’s Dean, by the way.” His instincts like this man, he’s respectful and understanding but not a pushover. His calm, calculating expression is comforting in a way, soothing Dean’s hunter tendencies with his transparency.
Asmodeus steps forward and Cas meets Dean’s eyes one more time. The fear has suddenly vanished, replaced by grim determination. Cas swallows hard and gives Dean a firm nod and a strange slow blink that has Dean’s breath catching.
Dean turns to scan the rocky beach one last time in hopes of spying a shock of messy dark hair and vividly blue eyes while the others finish loading.
Dean’s eyes narrow at the sight of Cas reaching for Inias and he barely restrains himself from dragging Cas away. He decides right then that Inias will be kept far away from Castiel.
“Children?” Dean asks with a quirked brow. He immediately dismisses tasks that would keep the man close to Cas. He’s already decided Cas will work in his family’s private garden and cook their meals with other slaves.
“Sorry, sorry,” Dean says, trying to straighten his expression as he wipes his eyes but Cas’ squinty glare has him nearly sputtering. “Just, uh, you’re trying too hard.”
Dean chuckles and wraps his arms tight around Cas’ back and presses a gentle kiss into his hair. “You’re turning into my muse.”
Ruby’s eyes are wide and her complexion has gone so pale that her chestnut hair appears black by comparison and Dean is satisfied to see fine tremors coursing through her body. Lilith’s bright eyes are narrowed in rage but she smirks at Dean as Benny prods her past him.
The smooth flesh pressed under Castiel’s fingers turns white and then red as he pulls Dean back to meet him, determined to claim what he knows should be his. The feeling of Dean around him, hot and tight, is surely made just for him.
The door to the front office creaks open and timid looking face peers through, drawing Dean’s attention like a buzzard to roadkill.
“Come on, Dean,” Cas says, batting his lashes when Dean opens his eyes just enough for Cas to catch a glimpse of green. “I promise I’ll make it worth your while.” Cas grins as sweetly as he can.
Dean shoves his feet into his boots and laces them tightly before heading out to the garage for his tools. As much as he can do with his inherent powers from being who he is, there is still something to be said about getting his hands dirty and doing the work himself.
He walks and walks, listening carefully for signs of his quarry but Dean seems to have vanished. “Dean!” Cas calls out, hoping to provoke a reaction.
Cas hums and nods. “Collaring was one that I wanted to try, but orgasm denial is on the list for today too. You reticence provided an opening to try it.”
Mills holds out her hand, offering him a crisp white card. “Take my card. If you need help, don’t hesitate to call.” She thrusts the small piece of heavy paper at him until he slowly reaches forward to take it with mumbled thanks. “Your turn with the medics. Take care, Castiel.”
“I mean, I know you’re going on tour again soon so I understand if your schedule doesn’t allow…” Cas starts to ramble but he’s silenced by Dean’s lips pressing hard against his.
Dean nods and swallows his mouthful. “Gonna meet up with Charlie and Benny for lunch, introduce them to Cas.”
Not when Dean’s fingers gently brush against the faint curls at the back of his neck and pull him closer and closer. Cas’s eyes slide closed with a happy hum just before their lips brush, feather-soft and far too fleeting.
Dean climbs to his feet as gracefully as he can but his knees ache in protest and he fails to hide his grimace. Cas ignores Dean’s suffering, as Dean has demanded he do, and drapes the blanket over his shoulders instead. Dean happily pulls the quilt tightly around him like a cloak, only now realizing the chill in the room and how his skin is pebbled.
Cas tries to breathe through the pain in his throat and the burning sting across his cheek but a swift kick to his ribs has him forgetting those minor discomforts as he lands sprawling across the floor. Cas grunts in pain but refuses to cry out as another kick comes. He curls in on himself, determined to protect his face and stomach. He’s aware of Dean’s biting tongue directed at his father but he doesn’t dare look.
“My brother comes to visit,” Dean defends weakly and Cas hums as he leans into Dean’s space, his lips only inches from Dean’s.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice comes softly as if he can read Dean’s thoughts and he strokes gently fingers over Dean’s jaw. “You feel it, don’t you?” His voice is gentle and Dean closes his eyes against the swell of emotion as he drives into Cas over and over.
“Sometimes I wonder, Dean, if you don’t push me intentionally” He growls, low against Dean’s ear. His hot breath tickling over Dean’s sensitive skin. “Do you want me to lose control with you?” He tugs harder and Dean fights not to double over with the intense pressure building low in his stomach.
The cuffs unhook easily from the chains and Cas slumps against Dean as he guides his Angel back to the chair he had started in. Cas plops down with a groan, the ache in his ass protesting the hard wood underneath him but Dean makes short work of the cuffs after retrieving the key from his jeans pocket and Cas mumbles his thanks. “Come on baby, just another minute” Dean grabs the spare set of sweats he had brought and finagles Cas into them before leaving him to slip back into his jeans. He doesn’t bother with his shirt, he can come back to clean up later. Right now, he needs to get Cas to bed.
“I felt the same, man. I was such a dick to you before you left. I’ve been nothing but a fuck up my entire life. I couldn’t imagine you wanting anything do with me,” Dean admits, dropping his gaze so that Sam can’t see the pain behind his eyes.
Cas bumps their shoulders together playfully and reclaims Dean’s hand as they turn down the beer aisle. “It’s not my fault you’re adorable when you blush,” Cas says sweetly, smirk firmly etched on his face.
“Make me come,” he forces himself to say, not having to fake his breathlessness as his body is driven closer to orgasm. His cheeks flush with shame for imaging Dean, for wishing the man driving into him was younger with bowlegs and the most charming smile Cas has ever seen.
Cas hums into the phone before he speaks, and when he does, his words are careful. “You are persistent.”
“You had that dream too?” Dean asks, knowing that he doesn’t need to explain what he’s talking about.
Dean responds with a strangled groan when Castiel’s lips close around the head of his cock and his Angel sinks down slowly, swirling his tongue and sucking hard enough for Dean to see stars. Cas holds him down easily with a single hand gripping his hip and Dean pulls hard on the ropes binding his wrists.
Cas looks at Dean quizzically when the man sucks in a deep breath and tilts his chin toward the ceiling.
Cas fixes Dean with a firm stare and two arched brows as Dean gapes like a fish. “That’s one. Would you like to continue?”
Dean leads Cas through the wide space of the longhouse to Sam’s private chamber and doesn’t bother knocking before barreling through his brother’s door with Castiel in tow.
For the last three weeks, having Cas to snuggle up to every night and commiserate with during every too early morning has made him feel more alive than he has in years. He has something to look forward to, someone to lean on when his hands tremble just a little too much, and the lingering whispers in his mind plant seeds of doubt.
He puts them on anyway and then squeezes into the jeans Balthazar is demanding he wear and turns to look at his ass in the mirror. He hates to admit that Bal might be right.
“Mornin” Dean grunts and gives Sam a firm nod as he trudges to the coffeemaker, pleased to see a decent amount left.
Cas shushes him and Dean fights back his mounting worry as he starts to feel small surges of grace pulsing from Castiel into his numb limbs. “You’re okay, I got you,” Cas whispers, pressing a small kiss to Dean’s knuckles. His grace dampens the pins and needles sensation that has Dean grimacing as the feeling begins to return.
“Hey now. This is about you and Jess. Not us.” Dean points between him and Cas before fixing Sam with an unimpressed glare.
Samandriel and Ephraim were right. Castiel can see that clearly now. Despite his fears, letting himself have this, have Dean, fills him with a sense of peace that he had not realized was missing.
Cas stares at Dean as if he has two heads. Hearing his own language coming out of the man’s mouth is strange and Cas finds he doesn’t care for it. He swallows hard and summons his courage. “Why should I believe you? You steal us away to become what? Your slaves?” Castiel rants, spitting the words with molten venom. “You are monsters.”
Slowly, Cas trails his hands up Dean’s legs and over his hips, giving them a firm squeeze before ghosting his fingers up Dean’s sides and back down again. The gentle touch sending a shiver through Dean’s body and reminding him that he’s cherished. A word Dean wants to cringe away from, but he can feel the emotion pouring through Castiel’s gaze nonetheless. It would be pointless to complain about that now.
Cas knows Dean too well and gives the ball one, solid squeak, urging his lover onward. Dean sucks in a deep breath and nods before continuing. He cuts at Castiel’s waistband next, carefully avoiding tender flesh as he splits the fabric. Castiel’s cock is eager, aiding Dean in pushing the cloth away from Cas’ groin. His underwear goes next and Cas’ dick bobs free, swollen and reddening as precome beads at the tip. Dean licks his lips at the sight and smirks at the knife in his hand.
Dean turns, Castiel’s knot finally slipping free so that Dean nearly tumbles from the couch as flips himself to face Cas. “What? Really?” Dean’s eyes are wide with shock.
As Cas stares at the dull metal band he realizes that he no longer sees it as a sign of his doom. Not when Dean has proven himself to be a good man. Cas’ cheeks flush as he considers the implications of the idea he’s toying with.
“We gather our brothers, make a plan.” Gabe stops and spins to face Castiel. “Tell me, Cassie, are you ready for a real fight?”
“Will you let me take care of you, Dean?” Castiel continues in that low purr that sends a shiver of want down Dean’s spine. It’s all Dean can do to nod along to Castiel’s words.
They laugh and grapple for dominance, throwing baseless taunts at one another while the rest of the band looks on and the road crew gathers with snickers of laughter.
The latch clicks behind him and Dean turns to see Cas with his back pressed against the deep mahogany door, laptop held flat against chest like a lifeline. “I do apologize Dean. I did not consider…” Cas begins but Dean quickly steps into his space and silences him with a single finger over the Angel’s perpetually chapped lips.
his family. The knot of panic in his chest begins to loosen and a sense of calm settles over him at the realization. No, calm isn’t quite the word. Content. Cas will never abandon him like everyone else he’s ever loved. He knows this with a bone-deep certainty.
“Ooh, you’ve got lover boy in there,” Meg’s voice goes sultry and Cas bites his lip to smother his smile as he stares at Dean. “Take your time boys, I expect a full report,” she says huskily and Dean’s expression turns scandalized.
Dean hums around his mouthful and catches Cas’ warning glare before he opens his mouth. He swallows hard, forcing his half-chewed food down. “Well, Cas told you that Inias kinda took him under his wing. Turns out, he figured us out from the beginning.”
“Just making sure,” Dean says before giving Cas a peck on the nose. “So, Roadhouse. You any good at pool?” He needs to change the subject, now. Sam has always said that Dean is allergic to feelings, and Dean feels a bit itchy under the collar right now.
Dean watches silently as Cas begins to press buttons, his jaw set firmly in determination when he finally presses the call button and sets the now ringing phone in front of them.
Dean is solid above him, Cas is certain he’s awake and none of this is a dream. He’s in Dean’s house, in Dean’s bed, and Dean is glad to have him here. All signs point to these things being true.
Cas tilts his head and regards Dean carefully before he nods and turns his head to look out the passenger window with a faint flush to his cheeks.
All too soon, he forces himself from his place of comfort and strips off his worn and filthy clothes. He wrinkles his nose in disgust at the sight of them and he casts them aside to be collected by the house slaves later.
If Dean weren’t accustomed to seeing such oddities around his brother, he would find the entire scene bizarre, but as it is, he simply smiles in satisfaction.
“Missy?” His head tilts of its own volition before his eyes dip to the paper cup clutched tightly in her hand.
Dean lifts a hand to cup Cas’ chin to hold him in place while Dean brings their lips together gently. “You sure?” Dean asks, his green eyes shining bright in the dim light of the room.
“You’re a good man,” Meg says approvingly. “You’re good for him, he’s just too stubborn to let himself have you.”
When he’s finally tucked behind the wall of flags, he presses a hand to his chest and closes his eyes. His heart is racing, his hands are shaking, but he cannot shake the wide grin splitting his features.
The way Dean arches his back to drive himself closer, the way those long lashes gently flutter as his eyes slide closed, and the way Dean grabs onto his shoulders and holds him close all make Castiel’s heart so full that his chest aches and his eyes burn with the overflow of affection coursing through him. “You’re perfect,” he mutters as Dean’s legs fall open to welcome Castiel in between.
“Ravenclaw,” Charlie says with a smile as she gestures toward a table. “Now, the gist of this agreement is that you aren’t allowed to post anything about this date on social media, tell anyone about meeting Dean through a dating app, or take any photographs beyond what Dean might offer. We’ll walk through the finer details as we go, gotta make sure you understand everything before signing on the dotted line.”
“Hey, do you, uh, know a Zachariah Adler by any chance?” The words tumble from his mouth before he can stop them and Cas nearly squawks with indignation.
“Something ain’t right,” Benny says softly as he rubs the faint line of blood welling along the shallow cut on his throat.
“We’re good to go, boys,” Benny says as he pulls the door open further and Dean releases Cas’ hand to put some space between them.
Cas pushes up enough to lift his head and look into Dean’s eyes with an expression he can’t quite identify. Cas licks his lips and Dean’s heart stutters at the sight of his pink tongue darting out and dragging across his too dry looking lips. Dean knows from experience those lips aren’t as dry as they look, they’re soft and pliable, perfect against his own.
“Not fair!” Dean exclaims as Cas fires and misses. Dean’s blaster is at the ready, but the girl is closer to him than Cas and Cas can already see where Dean is aiming.
Dean blinks at him, considering. The black of his contacts makes the room seem dimmer and they mute the blue of Castiel’s eyes. In short, he doesn’t like them but Cas can’t seem to take his eyes off his demon black eyes. Dean flashes a grin and strokes his cock, drinking in the sight of Cas strung out in front of him. Helpless and trusting.
He forces himself upright and swipes at the fog covering his mirror to stare himself in the eyes. The man staring back at him is someone he wouldn’t have even thought of imagining a handful of months ago. Clear-eyed, present.
Cas sucks in a deep breath and Dean loses sight of blue as those eyes slide closed. “Tell me about Sam?” Cas asks and swallows hard around the words.
Cas nearly bounces as he talks Dean through bringing the fish in and eventually, Dean is pulling the exhausted fish up the side of the pier and Rufus is there to guide it over the railing.
“Cas,” Dean gasps and surges forward, their mouths working together roughly. He’s going to have stubble burn but he doesn’t care. Can’t care. Not with Dean’s soft green eyes darkening with lust and the hefty bulge pushing at the front of Dean’s jeans beckoning him closer for a taste.
Cas sucks in a sharp breath and nods, willing himself to stand strong. His throat feels dry and hollow as his heart races, standing on the edge of a precipice simply waiting to fall.
The slight tingle still travels through Dean’s body, Cas’ grace keeping Dean’s lungs full of fresh air despite the thick cock stretching his throat and blocking his airway. “Ready?” Cas raises a brow and Dean attempts to nod and he hums his agreement. Cas’ hips stutter at the vibration and the grip in Dean’s hair tightens, drawing Dean back just enough to make his point. “None of that” Cas demands and a shiver runs up Dean’s spine with the command. His cock gives a very interested twitch at this turn of events and Dean finds himself reaching for his erection before he considers the action.
Dean breathes out heavily. “Yeah, Sammy. Fine” His voice may be a little more gruff than intended, but he can’t help it. He hates research.
“Feet?” Dean arches a brow, toes twitching discreetly. He is so not going to admit how much he enjoys having his feet played with unless Cas shows interest first. Feet are gross. Always have been and always will be. But, that doesn’t change the fact that Dean could probably come just from someone touching his.
Surely Dean and Benny will not need his help but that does little to lessen the white-hot pang of dread lancing through his stomach.
Cas sucks in a breath and nods when Dean pulls back, unaware that his trepidation had been so obvious. He opens his mouth to apologize but Dean silences him with a finger over his lips.
When his john pulls out, Cas winces from the sensitivity but he forces himself to straighten and tug his jeans back up his hips as he turns.
“Huh? Cas?” Now it’s Dean's turn to ask questions and Cas is really wishing for that hole to hide in about now.
Dean scoffs but nods. He would be glad to get out of bed despite his lingering exhaustion. The aching in his bones from lying down for so many days is almost more pervasive than the agony lacing through his shoulder.
Benny gives Sam on more appraising glance before he gathers an armful of loot and leads the remainder of their party from the room.
Dean sighs and reaches to stroke his fingers over Cas’ shoulder. “Cas, hey,” he whispers, wrapping thumb and forefinger around Cas’ wrist. The simple point of contact is grounding for both of them and Dean licks his lips, wanting more.
Cas’ spade is directly behind him and he reaches for it now. The wooden handle, worn smooth with use, fits in his hands perfectly and Cas holds it at the ready with the sharpened iron blade pointed toward Lilith.
A single touch might make him combust and he nearly whimpers when Dean fumbles with the keycard to unlock their room.
what you two get up to” Sam stumbles over his words awkwardly, trying to reassure Dean but failing miserably. Dean forces his growing smile into a harsh frown.
“Fucking bitch!” A voice yells as Missy ducks behind the counter and Cas lunges at the same man from earlier, catching him just below the ribs with his short blade.
Dean’s attention has refocused, but Cas can’t pry his gaze from the man as he sings song after song, holding the microphone seductively on the rare occasion he set his guitar aside. He jokes with the crowd, teases them, and smiles wide as people lob excited screams toward the band.
The drive to the small strip of shops across from the mall goes quickly and Cas’ heart flutters as he watches how comfortable Dean is behind the wheel. The faint scent of leather, the well-loved, and spotless interior puts him at ease and Cas can’t help the contented sigh that escapes as the rumbling engine falls silent.
The instant Dean’s shirt is out of the way, Cas’s hands land softly on the broad expanse of golden skin displayed before him. He can’t help the delighted little moan that escapes his lips when Dean groans needily and pushes into his touch. He never imagined finding this, someone who makes him feel so alive and so powerful… so
Cas nods, the light of understanding sparking in his eyes. “Ah. By ‘together’ you mean having sex” He nods, confirming his own deduction.
Castiel lays unmoving and Dean drops to his knees at his side, fingers probing against his throat for a sign of life as he glares at his brother. “That was unnecessary,” Dean says with a glare that would send anyone other than Sam running for the hills.
“I told your boy not to come,” Benny says as he claps Dean’s shoulder and crosses through the now open entry. “Gabe is going to give him a sparring lesson in Sam’s room.”
Mick’s gaze follows the flash of tongue, tempted for reasons Cas doesn’t want to understand. Mick seems like a good guy, why he’s paying for Cas every week doesn’t make sense.
Mary nods. “Yes, I think so. You said that you and Dean met in Herculaneum?” She asks Cas simply, trying to inject cheer into her tone.
Dean chuckles and nods. “Yeah, I think it’d make Charlie’s day to finally get me to Pride. Do you think the university would be interested in my band throwing a little benefit concert? I’m sure I could get everyone in on it, maybe raise some money for the local kids?”
Dean’s breath hitches and he fights to keep his eyes open. This is it. This is how he dies. His supposedly endless life cut short by the sudden release of the palpable tension that’s been strung between them for so long. “Cas,” Dean whispers, nearly a whine.
Sam quickly follows, folding his arms over Baby’s roof and staring at Dean with stars in his eyes. “She looks real good, Dean.” He pats the roof approvingly with a wide grin and Dean can’t help but agree.
After Cas stormed out, Dean wanted to chase. For the longest time, he held Baby's keys clenched in his hand, warring with himself over letting Cas go but he'd had enough. He couldn't keep doing this.
The kisses are gentle, feather-light as they break through the haze Dean hadn’t noticed gathering until it starts to clear. He may as well be floating, boneless and pliant beneath Castiel’s tender touch.
Dean hides his nose in the crook of Cas’ neck, breathing in the crisp and wild scent that always seems to accompany his angel, as if his very being is the purest thing that Dean will ever find.
Cas nods and holds Dean’s hand just a little bit tighter. Dean follows as Cas guides them through the narrow, winding, streets and his eyes widen when everything opens up to a busy intersection full of busses and cars. Traffic signals seem to be absent, resulting in congestion unlike anything Dean has ever seen. “We just need to... stay close to me, Dean,” Cas says as he pulls Dean off the curb and into the middle of the fiasco happening in the street.
“No! Dean!” Cas screams and Azazel silences him with a harsh kick that has Cas clenching his jaw and doubling over in pain.
Cas’s head jerk back and his brows furrow as he stares at the utterly insane man in front of him. $500 for a kiss? He’s lost his damn mind. “That’s a lot of money.”
His own pages, however, have barely anything beyond the kinks they’ve already tried. Spanking is a resounding YES and Dean will
Cas’ mouth drops open slightly, but he hesitates. Is Dean asking him if wants water, or if he’s had water? He doesn’t know what answer to give. He’s still thirsty, he needs more. “Yes?” He mutters in Norse, hoping that his answer gets him what he wants.
