“I’m going to show you a series of images and you’re going to rate the attractiveness of the men between 0 and 10, 0 meaning you have no attraction at all and 10 meaning you have a great attraction for their physical appearance. Are you ready?”
It was very warm and cozy in the detective's pocket and when John leaned his weight against Sherlock's chest he could hear the thumping of his heart. The taxi ride to the crime scene was filled with Lestrade's questions to Sherlock over what he had planned to do with John.
There was a horrible glare from the camera as the screen flashed bright white. Slowly, features came into focus. Dark curly hair framed a pale white face, sharp cheek bones casting shadows down the sides of his face extenuating the thin frame. John couldn’t help but to smile in response to the sight.
“Fine. You have till the first.” Sherlock slammed the door and John could hear his heavy footsteps pounding down the stairs quickly.
John licked his lower lip. He remembered the physically driven commands of falling asleep and waking up, a tug on the right arm had sent him deep into sleep and his left woke him up, although at the time the actions were performed he seemed to lose control over his body, he couldn’t recall anything in-between those though. He opened his mouth, “…”
“Well that was called in fast. Hope they don’t start putting the fire out before the bees die, that could be quite the problem.” Moriarty grinned. “Turned all the cameras off, we have other places to be now.”
What if somehow Sherlock himself was trying to tell him something? Greg felt a bit awkward just holding it like that. “Well I don’t know how to play?”
“Sherlock…” John just stood there a moment before his mind could catch up with him, he sprinted after the detective, “Wait, Sherlock! I- I’m sorry. I didn’t realize I hadn’t, I swear.”
“Hey, don’t listen to anything she said ok?” Lestrade wasn’t sure if he could address him on that close of a personal level yet, but it was obvious something that detestable woman had said upset Mycroft on a personal level. “She’ll say anything if she thinks it will get a reaction.”
“John! John!! You’re not even listening to me deduce!” Sherlock grabbed John’s arm only then noticing the awkward stance between his blogger and the D.I.
“Well… it’s probably safer him knowing then if something were to happen and he didn’t.” John looked down into Sherlock’s eyes. “What did he mean by ‘again.’?”
Moriarty stepped inside the flat followed by Moran toting an assault rifle. “What happened to you gun hmm? Oh that’s right! Your pet is too small for it now!” he quickly spotted John on the table and grabbed a glass beaker, pouring out the content and trapping John in it in one swift movement. “Can’t have you running off now.”
“Oh don’t think I’ve forgotten about you now Johnny boy. I could always squish you to death, but the thought of having you smeared under my beautiful designer shoes is horrifying.” Moriarty made a mock scared face. “Sebbie! Do that thing you do when you get rid of a bug for me. You know when I catch one in a cup and you flip it upside down? We’ll need to bring Johnny boy with us after all if we want to have some fun.
“I know dear, don’t think about it now.” Mrs Hudson tried calming John before he sank further into depression.
Sherlock subconsciously purred in his sleep, John couldn’t stand it anymore, he pressed a chaste kiss against the sleeping detective’s forehead.
They had approached Angelo’s, Sherlock stepped ahead and opened the door, waiting for John to walk in before him. He was 89% sure that he was socially inclined to do this assuming the events of last night would not be forgotten by his flat mate.
“Not much to tell, you already know about all of it. Live at home with my brother, go to school online, I don’t get out much…” his voice trailed off unenthusiastically.
Sherlock stepped closer to him and slid his arms around John’s waist. “We’re in this together remember?”
Sherlock shrugged, “Well maybe he’s trying to tell you something.” He raised an eyebrow suggestively.
“Sure thing, tea?” John offered, knowing that Lestrade was trying to determine if he was still stable or not. He wasn’t sure either way himself.
“John? Oh my gosh I haven’t seen you since…” ‘better not mention the hospital’ “It feels like it’s been ages! How have you been?”
“Proof of what exactly?” John looked between them both. Did they seriously intend on leaving him in the dark? Both the Holmes’ seemed to be intentionally not looking his way now.
The detective didn’t respond. He was busy huffing at new message he had received. John attempted to hail a cab as he looked down to see what it said. But as he looked back up, a black car had approached.
If the thought had ever occurred to him before he hadn’t given it any attention till now. He had simply grabbed the first remover product he found, but he hesitated a moment in the aisle. John had truly regretted the bizarre late night idea to paint his nails black, he had only done it to see if he might like it and because it was sitting in Sherlock’s room- always the experimenter that he was. Although the act of painting them it’s self wasn’t all that bad…
“John no, you cant do this, I wont let you. There are so many people that need you, love you, you cant leave them.”
“Very mature John. To be fair I think it may have a bit to do with your time taking orders in the military. You’re also very prone to taking orders by me on an average day, such as retrieving my phone for me.” Sherlock could see his flat mate budging uncomfortably under his watch.
“You don’t have to carry it all at once,” John went to grab a heavier looking bag when he spotted the case. He went still, recognizing it instantly. “Oh.”
John grumbled. “Damn it, just help me out will ya?” he was too embarrassed to ask when the detective had come back to the waking world.
A sharp jabbing pain filled John, the majority of his body going limp at that. Sherlock pressed him up against the wall and with nowhere for John’s feet to find flooring, he wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s waist. John’s hand flew to his neck after Sherlock pulled back.
As John’s hands went for the water, Sherlock saw his chance. Pitch black tentacles shot forward, wrapping firmly around John’s wrists. John’s instincts kicked in again as he tried pulling away. Sherlock’s chest hit the side of the bath, splashing a large amount of water onto the floor and winding him in the process.
clothes ever made, they were still sub standard to actual clothing, especially considering the lack of socks and boxers. He had also lost his tooth pick, making it difficult to stand right.
“John! Slow this damn thing down!” Sherlock yelled across the racing wind as Tobby dashed through yards, gates, and scaled up fences.
Greg thought back to the one and only time he had spoken to Mycroft Holmes in person. Lestrade had found Sherlock drugged out of his mind in the ally behind a popular club with two dead bodies half naked. The police thought he was just high when he sat crossed legged by a trash can and deduced the entire scene and the two bodies, solving the crime in mere minutes. No one had believed him of course and some of the officers on scene wanted to lock him up for the night believing he had committed the crime himself. He was too far gone to even protest it. But somehow Lestrade knew that there was more to the disheveled looking addict and took it upon himself to bring him into the station without handcuffs and even force a decent meal on him. It would turn out to be one of the best decision the DI had ever made, believing in Sherlock. But it also earned him a terrifying car ride to an abandoned parking garage the next day.
John really hoped that Sherlock didn’t end up like that. He didn’t want to go through whatever Greg was going through. He shrugged, so they were friends. It was odd, but not a big deal, they were just like Sherlock and him. “Well, I’ll see you later, I’ll let you know if Mycroft pops up again.” He turned to leave.
Hours passed as the old man called various news stations and museums asking what they would pay to get a hold of his 'genuine fae folk'. John didn't pay much attention but in they end there seemed to only be one person interested, an auction house that dealt in extremely rare and valuable goods. Occasionally some questionably illegal sells as well.
Sherlock peeled off the oversized coat, the rest of his clothes just as awkwardly too long. “It’s not done yet.” He turned his face away.
“It does more?!” John quickly obeyed, fascinated by the technology, and more then a bit aroused. “Holy mother of sex toys.” Not only did it wiggle, the actual size gyrated, enlarging and shrinking in girth. It was certainly specialty all right.
‘A change of clothes would be nice, those will be in the upstairs dresser. A phone charger and my laptop would be nice too, if that’s not too much trouble.’ –JW
Sherlock had outwardly been adoring the new John for the past two days, but inside he cringed to see him. It was a reminder of Sherlock's lack of care to his flatmate's safety and of what he might never have again. The novelty of having John ride around in his pocket all day was a pale comparison to having his friend back. He worried constantly about his safety, checking to make sure he was still in his pocket while out of the flat. Having to remember to feed him, although luckily John had been very vocal about that point so far.
“John! Make as little noise as possible! They can’t hear you but they can feel the vibrations of sound and can track you that way.”
Like all of Sherlock’s experiments, he quickly became immersed in this new one, spending all his time focused entirely on trying the simple feat of moving things. It was far more difficult then he had thought it would be, but he was slowly picking up little tricks. If an object was already in motion, it was significantly easier to move it. A door moving a bit from the wind or someone else starting to shut it was simple enough to slam shut or open, unfortunately that had given Mrs. Hudson quite the scare when she was around for it.
“John?” He could hear his own voice buzzing strangely, as if it was cutting through sound waves in a different manner.
A moment later John was handing him his tea. He thought back to his dream last night. Sherlock wanted him to tell Lestrade everything. He looked down into his mug. He couldn’t possibly do that. The detective would think he was crazy and insist he see his therapist. Which maybe he actually really should do. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe he should tell Greg.
The novelty of being twelve centimeters tall was quickly wearing off. John was over the solitude of being in a musty pocket, of having the only people who saw him stair intently at him comparing his size to near by household objects, and even having his flatmate's over compensating attention.
“It’s quite alright Gregory. I can manage on my own.” His voice remained emotionless; only a hint condescending.
“You see but you don’t observe Sherlock. Here, let me give you a demonstration.” Moriarty pulled a plain brown bag from under the table and stuck his hand in menacingly. “You’ll love this bit.” He pulled out a smaller sized rat, opened a tab on the far side of the doll house that John wasn’t at and put the rat inside, quickly closing the tab back up.
John came home early from work the following day, they were over staffed and he decided a good sit and a cuppa might help with his nerves- if he could ever get his computer to work again. Just as John had put the kettle on, there was a knock at the door. That was unusual, his friends didn’t tend to drop in unannounced.
“Oh uh… yea. Mostly.” Not entirely, he was having horrible nightmares and sometimes thought his dead friend was talking to him.
"I did, came back to get my stuff. And I only left because you stay up all night long laughing at your bloody computer screen. Arse."
“Gregory! This is absurd! This is-” The desperate look on Lestrade’s face was melting the heart he wasn’t sure he even had. His voice softened, “I’ve always harbored… a certain fondness for you.” This was still the worst possible time for a heart to heart. “and admittingly, certain desires to be with you. But, it was never- rather, I could never-” He tried to compose himself, which was quite difficult as his tentacles were greedily grabbing at Lestrade again, pulling him closer. “There are things I simply can not do.” He whispered, “That I know are part of having a relationship.”
"Yes. If it was a random killing there would have been someone alone out back the perp could have killed. But no, the killer entered a crowded club, could have been noticed, could have risked dropping the weapon, there was a target. Upon inflicting the target and leaving I believe that's when your friend was poisoned by mistake."
“Put me on my desk.” It took a great deal of added effort at his size, but Sherlock quickly assessed that the papers he had been working on were gone. “This isn’t good.”
“But the worst part is how he insists I stay in all the time! Its awful being cooped up in here just sitting in my damn chair.”
John wanted to die. Or better yet, kill Sherlock. These thoughts filled his mind when his date arrived.
Sherlock looked down, glad his blogger couldn’t see the pitiful expression on his face at that moment. “But you always say you aren’t gay.”
‘We are unsafe as our cycle has come. It could be mutually beneficial to come to an understanding, however.’ -MH
"Well it's not right yet, I am surprised at you Lestrade, you know how important it is to find this child."
“Find anything useful?” Molly put a large bag she brought with her by the couch and came over to look at the computer screen.
A massive stripped grey cat pounced and missed them. He hunched his shoulders up after realizing he missed his target and got in position again. John tried to stand again but Sherlock quickly pushed him out of the way and then fell back as two plush paws pinned him, a horrible hissing coming from above.
Wordlessly John got up as if he had never complained about being tired and began making tea for two.
John sighed and grabbed his chair to sit and face Sherlock. “Are you going to tell me what the hell is going on? What your idiot of a brother wants?”
John had always wondered what the final straw would be. On his first night knowing his slightly deranged flatmate, he had shot and killed a man for him. His first date since getting use to civilian life had been hijacked as they were kidnapped by a gang of assassins- also Sherlock’s fault. He had a bomb strapped to him, constant gay remarks were made to and about him, he was drugged against his will while locked in a lab, and now this. He sat naked on the floor of a dog kennel with nothing but a sheet.
Lestrade was already out of the car by the time Mycroft answered, “Really? Oh, well good, great. Uh, just this way.”
Sherlock inspected the newest crime scene with renewed vigor. A middle aged woman lay dead across her living room floor. She was both short and blond like all the other with the exception of the second victim at the night club.
Sherlock looked down with what looked like guilt on his face. "John I… I'm very sorry about this. I did tell you to be careful with that beaker."
“It was stupid, I know. I’ll just be in m room then until it wears off.” He turned to leave but was stopped by a hand on wrist.
“What are you doing?!” John bit his lower lip nervously, he didn’t want either of them to be seen after all.
John let out a light sigh and crossed an item off the grocery list, “Then I trust you… wait… you didn’t say I wouldn’t be mad about-“
“I’m on my way to 221b now to check, it’s a delicate situation after all and I doubt he’ll even come out if I send someone in my place. But there’s a good chance he was likely taken too, impossible to tell by the state of the footage though.”
“As you wish.” John grinned back, leaning closer as well. Sherlock was far more mesmerizing in person he was now finding. He paused for a moment just to stair into those amazing aquatic eyes. Before he knew what he was doing, John had closed his own eyes and was closing the distance between them, wanting desperately to feel those cupid bow lips against his own.
The lower tentacle on his waist had let go entirely, the tip now sneaking down into his trousers. Greg wanted to thrash about to stop it, but he couldn’t risk it. Just another moment, that was all he needed it. He swirled his tongue around Mycroft, knowing it might just be the finishing touch he needed to get all those damn things off him.
‘It happened before.’ It hissed in Sherlock’s head, the sound echoing strangely. It wasn’t quite Mycroft’s voice but close enough that he vaguely recognized it. ‘Don’t you remember?’ The words seemed to bounce off the walls of Sherlock’s very mind.
"I'm sorry" she got quickly before pushing Sherlock's hand away from the table. He had been cupping it so lightly over John that the force from Molly's hand easily disrupted his own, sending John flying off the table.
Sally looked up, “What, the closet?” She was sure the police earlier would have looked, but they had heard that strange noise. She cautiously opened the door, relieved to find no one inside. “Its just some old rope?”
“I left her because she was having affairs, actually.” And of course Sherlock was the one to tell him.
Sherlock had originally chosen the public location to see if someone under the influence of hypnotism could pass by as completely lucid to their actions by anyone watching, but things were not going according to plan now. “John, wake up, stay with me.”
“Ah, see he’s gone through it already.” Daniel grinned, figuring that meant they would investigate the case after all. The contents of the box were scattered across the table, pictures of previous occupants of the flat put out and a disk labeled ‘security footage’ sitting on the edge of the table.
Greg was gripping the sides of the bed, wincing at the intrusion. He had never felt so abnormally slick before, despite them not using lube.
Sherlock rolled his wheelchair out of the room, checking his watch. It wouldn’t be long now. John had always seemed so nice, understanding. He would probably see past this, they knew each other so well already, minus his own disability.
“We have every right to be here.” He subconsciously stepped in front of Sherlock blocking him from the crowd in defense.
Traffic cameras easily revealed the DI and Sherlock had gone to Scotland Yard after the odd ally incident. Mycroft was baffled.
There was Lestrade, right there, in the club, only a few meters away. He did the only thing he could think of and made a run for it, he hadn’t expected Lestrade to try to follow him. Had he seen him? Did he know? It was unlikely.
John cuts him off, sitting upright in his bed suddenly. “Sher….” He stops himself, can’t bring himself to say it.
John blushed a deep red as he turned around. “Molly, we uh…” he didn’t want to break her heart like this, he knew the poor girl had a crush on Sherlock for ages.
One of the boys instantly stood back up, pocketing the wallet and looking around but saw no one, “Who’s there?” He could have sworn the voice had been directly next to him.
John blinked rapidly a few times. Sherlock never once talked about going outside in all the time they had talked. He bought everything online and had it shipped, took online classes, ate home made meals on the rare occasion he felt like eating, or had something delivered. A small fear started to grip him, what if Sherlock was agoraphobic? It was a highly disconcerting thought, but it wasn’t something that would make him shy away. If Sherlock was, he was going to help him out, they would be able to get through it together.
“What?! What is it?!” Mycroft pushed past the DI to get a glimpse of a massive eight legged creature run through the rubble. “You scared the life out of me!”
Sherlock pulled off his shoes and threw them at the ground angrily, still shrinking.  “This was a stupid experiment.” He turned to flop on his bed and stopped.
he told himself.The green image of a little camcorders popped up on John’s screen, he smiled to himself knowing he was finally going to be able to see his friend.
Really now brother, you should be more careful with your possessions. Did he fall out of your pocket?-MH
'It was just a cut, it's not like he drank it.' Sherlock thought to reassure himself, but somehow that didn't make his worry disappear. 'Well, there's no point in telling John until I know for sure if there will be any affects.'
Sherlock must have known John was thinking this because the soft smile slowly returned to his face, “You’re doing very well so far.”
Sherlock lay next to him, wishing beyond hope that he could reach out and pull him close, but apparently he was beyond the ability to touch now. “I’m so sorry John… this wasn’t suppose to happen… I wasn’t supposed to… die. Not for real. Something must have gone wrong.” He was finally understanding what was happening to him.
If Sherlock had still been looking he would have noticed John’s features softening as he took in what the detective had just said. “Oh Lock… I’m sorry.”
"There's no variety, these women were all tracked down for sharing specific traits. The dark haired woman at the club was just a fluke, all the others are shorter then average with light colored hair."
Those undulating tentacles lowered them both back to the bed, two of them prodding at the detective’s entrance. Greg’s breath left him for a moment at that. It was hardly his first time, but the thought of being breached by such an appendage was wholly different. He couldn’t imagine how the fully prehensile muscle would feel as it writhed inside him, hitting him at every angle. Lestrdae found that he was surprisingly ok with this suddenly. Somewhere in there it was still the man he had been pinning after for all this time.
The water had a murky greenish tint to it, the occasional leaf floating by. The small water breaks were just loud enough to muffle a small buzzing sound, but it was still just audible. Four meters away rocking up and down on the waves was a small remote controlled boat. She glanced around, all the other officers had already left this area of the house, only a small handful remained inside. The motor stopped and the boat just swayed lightly in the water near some debris. Donovan narrowed her eyes, it was a plastic bag by the looks of it, something inside weighed it down slightly, but there was still enough air in the bag to keep it afloat.
“John, get on your knees.” His voice was a deep baritone of authority and John found he was on his knees before he could even register what he was doing. But was that the hypnotism or just Sherlock’s voice? “Your whole body is going to relax in 3, 2, 1,” the detective snapped his fingers loudly.
“Yes John, I was the shortest person in school. Then overnight I was taller then most everyone. It was horrible and awkward and I don’t want to talk about it.” He crossed his arms and jumped onto the couch.
He hated when he had thoughts like this. He looked at Sherlock giving his best ‘annoyed face.’ Sherlock’s eyes softened.
John paused mid bite into his sandwich, he had so much he wanted to know but he couldn’t just blurt out anything that came to mind.
Once Maria and the woman that accompanied her were just outside the small gate of the outdoor café, headed south via leisurely stroll, Molly stood, following them quietly.
“Like hell you are, what on earth are you thinking? That you’ll slip through the crack under the door? I’m not letting you do something so risky.” John was fully prepared to hold him down if he had to.
John sighed, why did they both have to be so headstrong? "Aha." He spied his cell phone on the other side of the counter just beyond some dishes that needed washing, Sherlock was truly lost without John cleaning up around the flat. '
Before Donovan could see the approaching Lestrade and the miraculously living Sherlock Holmes she frowned at the dressed up patrons, “Damn freaks.”
This time Sherlock made sure he got a more accurate reading on John’s pulse to be compared to his likely lowered pulse while under hypnotism. It also occurred to him that John fell into the trance just a bit quicker this time.
Nervously he booted his computer up, as luck would have it, it was one of the rare occasions that Sherlock wasn’t online. John grinned at his good fortune, although he supposed he wouldn’t actually be aware of what he was doing unless they were using the camera…
He opened his eyes, vision still slightly blurred, he could just make out the pale neck he was barely an inch away from, only then realizing his arm was wrapped tightly around the figure.
“Oi, didn’t you hear what I just said? I said it’s fine, it’s all fine, really. You’re not a freak, it’s normal to be into that sort of thing. Really.”
Sherlock smirked up at him, instantly catching why John had stopped talking, “The way? Happily.” He turned his wheels to face the direction they would be headed.
Lestrade quietly stepped into the kitchen wearing fresh clothes, watching as a strange woman entered from afar.
"You can't know that, there is no way you can." Sherlock snapped back. "This is all my fault. He kept threatening me to stop bringing chemicals home… and now he's gone."
Sherlock gently moved his hands and John’s followed, moving the planchette with them. It almost felt like having physical hands again. He had heard of people losing limbs and still being able too feel them, ‘phantom limbs.’ His whole body felt that way now, but he could feel John’s hands around him as if they were his own.
The detective smiled faintly. “You’re drunk and don’t know what you’re saying.” He turned to leave but was stopped by a tug on his tail.
Greg turned the sink off, worried as to why Mycroft would have left it on for so long, or why the front door was unlocked. That’s when he noticed. A knife block on the kitchen counter, a rather large one with numerous slots for knives. Yet, not a single knife was in it. Had they all been taken out? Even in defense, a person would only need one.
John looked up, he had finally reached the corner room and thankfully it was another plexiglass one that allowed him a good look at the man he loved. He jerked his head back down. ‘
John sighed, “I don’t even know how you figured that out… I keep telling myself I wont do it again, but then it keeps happening.” It was just so welcoming and it even smelled like him. Then there were all those strange things that have been happening recently. “I know why you’re here, Greg. So if there’s anything specific you came to tell me, you can just come out and say it.” He didn’t want to beat around the bush anymore.
No one was home to hear the light knocks on the empty flat door. The ones John had waited in vain so many months for.
“Oh. This lasted longer then I thought it would.” The detective stood up. “I should lessen the amount of the drug I use next time. This is far longer then desired.”
“You’ll thank me later when you don’t have to buy new clothes after ripping them.” Sherlock handed him the mug of grey liquid and locked the cage.
Lestrade looked about nervously, “Uh, yea, you know John’s blog right?” his mind raced, surely Mycroft must know about it. “You know, where he writes about all of their cases?”
Both men could tell that she was still mad at John, but likely willing to forgive him if she had gone out of her way to get his attention.
John peered from the eyehole of the skull he hid behind; spying Harry he realized this could possibly be one of the worst days of his life. Just under being shot, having a bomb strapped to him, the time he and his date were nearly murdered when an assassin who thought he was Sherlock and….
"No! No, no no no no, damn it Lestrade why was I so blind?" Sherlock put his hands to either side of his temples in frustration.
“I was really hoping you two could help, I’ve heard such great things about Sherlock and the last time I asked someone to investigate they refused on the grounds of the case being too absurd to be real.”
Harry's smile returned as she stepped away from the detective circling the flat, her voice was much louder now. "So how much do you know about my little brother? I could always fill in a few blanks."
“No.” John put his hand on the side of Sherlock’s face the detective to look at him. “You have emotions Sherlock, I’ve seen them. You care about Lestrade, even Mycroft although you wont admit it. Mrs. Hudson is like a mother to you! I see the way you look at her and how you give her special treatment, the way you seek her acceptance despite driving her mad.”
“Sherlock wait. Just tell me. Am I stuck like this? Indefinitely I mean.” Sherlock stepped closer to him noticing the wetness of his eyes. “I’m sorry, I know I keep asking and so does everyone else but- well, it does change a lot.”
-But it’s also psychosomatic, which is why it’s fine when you’re raiding and why you see a therapist.-
“You’re no fun! I could just as easily threaten the idiot in the other room, but you know I love to watch you work.”
"I don't think so, it seems too fresh, like it was inflicted just before death, its also deeper then a cat's scratch."
Lestrade was at a slight loss of words, perhaps keeping the older Holmes trapped there was a bad idea, “So… erm, just came to bring me coffee then?” He wasn’t sure if it was his imagination or if Mycroft really had tightened his eyes in a nervous tell.
Sherlock’s hands were shaking as he lifted the shirt, making sure John wasn’t looking. His skin looked slashed to ribbons on his side. He carefully ran his fingers over the 3 slits. They merely fluttered at the touch. There was no pain. There were three more on the other side.
“It is impossible for me to know the extent of everything you would or would not like to do while hypnotized…” Sherlock could see John growing more uncomfortable by the second. “But I will of course respect what I believe you want. Now get comfortable.”
John grabbed the handles on the back of his chair, already knowing what the problem was. “I got you.”
John had expressed a desire after the first time he visited Sherlock’s grave to move out of 221B, it held too many painful memories. But he found he couldn’t bring himself to leave it. Leave behind the hope that Sherlock might come back beyond all reason and logic. Leave that looming scent of his that John wasn’t sure if it was imaginary or not. This was his home, their home.
“The door was locked before the incident was reported and was still locked when the police got here.” Donovan had silently followed them in. “Besides, what would be the point? No one was here to see or hear it, and seems like just a coincidence that someone happened to spot it from the street.”
“Well I suppose this is where we part ways Gregory.” Mycroft looked solemnly out the sleek black car’s window as he still clutched the soot damaged and slightly damp coat from the warehouse.
“Well I could always leave if you think I’m not up to it, I’m sure Anderson over there could wrap the whole case up for you.” He smiled sarcastically.
In it’s confusion the tarantula turned around, John jumped on it causing it move violently beneath him but unable to reach him.
This was the third morning in a row that Mycroft had come over, John was beyond suspicious that the reason was more to do with a certain Detective Inspector rather then his brother, but somehow this didn't feel right, he wasn't here on a social visit. "Could be at Speedy's- there's not much food here and it's just downstairs." He could hear Sherlock dressing behind him.
“Erm, hang on a moment…” his eyes scanned wildly across the crime scene looking for foot imprints. There were too many officers obscuring his vision
He was glad he was in the privacy of his small room or he would have been thoroughly embarrassed that he was smiling of all things about a friend request from someone he just met on an online game.
There goes his plan of a misplaced joke. John didn’t answer, after all, hadn’t it been obvious what he was thinking?
Moriarty shuffled through his definitely now wrinkled west-wood, his phone still waiting for him in his pocket. He hated that he needed Sebastian back, but there was no one else he could possibly trust. Everyone that had heard his name feared him, he had ears everywhere and usually a hired gun as well. But that wasn’t nearly enough to protect him now. He had to keep appearances up to keep people in fear, money alone doesn’t speak for it’s self these days, if it had Mycroft would have been an actual threat to him after his arrest, but people don’t respect money. People respect a good old fashioned villain.
“I can’t believe you would fall for Lestrade of all people.” Sherlock sighed and fell onto the couch with a small ‘thud.’
John tiptoed out his room, not wanting to wake Sherlock, and began breakfast for two. John was still smiling to himself that Sherlock would actually do something for him, experiment related or not. He hated taking drugs to make the nightmares go away, they drove away the good dreams too, and he didn’t want that. He was always the type of man to accept the bad things in life so long as there was occasionally something pleasant.
“Fast forward the tape to 3 am.” Daniel leaned over his shoulder, a little confused what was going on with John.
Roger’s sighed, “Then I cant even rent these damn rooms out. It’s like I’m cursed or something.” He seemed utterly exasperated.
The moment his hand touched the door handle he could feel a strange rumbling beneath his feet. He swung the door open as the tremor began making the house shake.
For new readers: It may or may not be important to note that this story was written after season two and before season 3 aired. I had no knowledge of what season 3 or 4 would be about. So yea... a lot of crazy shit went down in those seasons. Ignore them.
Mycroft was walking down the stair at that very moment, and Sherlock suddenly sat stalk still, maybe he hadn’t seen him yet.
This struck John as particularly odd as the flat was usually well lit. He glanced toward the window; the sky was nothing but dark clouds. Of course it was probably about to rain, making the river extra high- John froze. He had had that same dream again last night. The one where he was drowning. How had he forgotten that when he woke up?
“John, thank god, you did it.” There were no tall buildings around them anymore, no howling monsters to attack them.”
John sighed and shook his head, expecting Sherlock to hang up then and move on to something else. A few moments later he glanced back up at the screen and noticed the line was still connected.
"You're kidding. You're gonna take him to a crime scene like that?" Lestrade was clearly still in shock.
John sighed, “It’s ok, it was… thoughtful? I think.” He’s certainly never heard of someone giving their mate a sex toy before, aside from being a gag gift that was. “It’s a… actually I’m not too sure what it is…” his brow furrowed a bit. He wasn’t exactly an expert, but he could tell this was something special.
Greg could feel his hands starting to shake. He didn’t want to even be considering this right now. But he couldn’t see how this frame had fallen. Where that voice had come from. Why had John been using a Ouija board? No, this was ridiculous. Just coincidences.
John flashed bright red "I'm fine, really, I am." he looked down at the table and rubbed the back of his head. He was glad Sherlock saved his life, but the way he treated him now was beginning to get over board. He felt like a prized jewel.
"Oh don't pout John. And Molly, obviously don't tell anyone about this as John is very sensitive on the topic."
Sherlock stood frozen, arm still outstretched, black coat flowing behind him. John was suddenly aware that he was asleep but in those fleeting moments when he realized he had become lucid it was taken away from him.
Harry looked at the man with an unusual look of caution. "John takes his phone everywhere. He's not forgetful in the least." She pushed her way past him. "Where is he? It's too early for him to have left already."
Greg felt the natural urge to back up, which forced him against the sink, more water spilling out. “I thought… you didn’t want me coming over?”
As previously instructed, she placed her mesh purse on the table, the holes just large enough for John and Sherlock to peer through, but still small enough that you would have to watch for movement to see them.
Sherlock leaned against the wall and hummed in thought at that. It was possible after all, and not an entirely terrible place to start. But there was the obvious problem that it wasn’t just anyone trying to scare people away. There really was a ghost.
“Wont affect my date will it?” he remained sitting in his chair as the detective sprinted off into the kitchen.
Although relatively small to other shops in the area the store was filled with dolls of every kind and size, most of which were significantly larger then John.
The DI desperately grabbed at a potted plant and attempted to throw it at his attacker, but another tentacle quickly shot out to grab the pot.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a bit. “Its not the first body you’ve found? There’s at least one other, more likely more that you think are connected.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. I like you just as much both ways. I just don’t want you thinking you should have to hide this.”
John had accidentally punched Sherlock in a moment of rage, forgetting the fabric wall was Sherlock, who had barely felt it.
But they were Sherlock’s pillows. On Sherlock’s bed. How could he possibly remove one from it’s rightful place? This is where it belonged with the rest of Sherlock’s possessions.
When John had left that morning Sherlock did the only thing he thought would win over his blogger, he re drugged himself. It was worth wearing an ugly hat if John paid more attention to him.
“But why? Are you going to poison me or something?” John was squirming to hide his erection, but Sherlock was making it near impossible. Sherlock’s damn teeth kept grazing his skin and he could tell without looking that they far sharper then a human’s.
John often heard people whispering, “Why does he put up with him?” “How could anyone stand that freak?” They were of course referring to Sherlock. He couldn’t stand when he over heard these things. Of course his flat mate wasn’t the easiest person to get on with, he was a bloody git and quite possibly the most socially awkward man in all of England.
Sherlock gave a short sharp nod, “The woman from the Lake house,  she had a distinct garlic scent to here, too much olive oil as well, she had gone there for lunch. Possibly on a date with another woman, Maria followed her home.”
John’s eyes snapped open, for a brief second he could have sworn he saw Sherlock leaning over him with a worried expression. But with the blink of his eyes the image was gone and he was alone in the flat once more. He pulled a pillow close to his chest and gripped it tightly as he buried his face into it. In public he had tried so hard to look like he was trying to move on, tried so hard to keep himself together. But with no one around there was no reason to pretend and he cried freely into Sherlock’s pillow.
He really wasn’t sure. Should he be researching octopi? Or was there no correspondence to those and what Mycroft had shown him. He wasn’t sure, which was precisely why he should be researching and experimenting now.
“Mycroft Holmes. Anthea? I don’t see how that relates to… oh. I see. Yes, send the car around and I’ll be right down.”
John was still stretching his arms out in an effort to scratch at Sally with his fake nails. Then it sank in. He was going to be brought down to the station. By Lestrade. Who likely had no idea who he was but would soon find out along with everyone else. Fuck.
“You would really give up an opportunity to lessen or even cure all that because you don’t trust me?” John almost missed the hint of hurt Sherlock tried to hide in his voice.
“John never properly introduced us. But I knew what you were when he first mentioned you. Looked you up online after that. Told me everything I needed to know.”
“Moran you idiot!” he kicked at his phone, to stubborn even in private to show that it had actually hurt his foot. He was five and half inches tall, naked, and alone. Perhaps not his best of moments.
“I have no idea what your are talking about. Helping solve cases for the Yard help Sherlock pay the rent. I’m not some degenerate who gets off on seeing dead bodies if that’s what you think.”
John was very uncomfortably hard at that. “What? Why?” He told himself it was just his body’s reaction to stress.
“Holy shit, it’s a USB dildo.” Nearly giggling at the very thought, John plugged the wireless usb plug in and played the first song that he found. Sure enough, the toy began vibrating in accordance to the song. Sometimes only softly when the music was quieter, and immensely when the music was loud.
A young boy dressed shabbily straightened his back at the sight of the odd man and shoved a glass jar inside his jacket as the detective caught his breath.
“Ok, that was actually really painful.” There was a bit of blood, but not nearly as much as he expected and it seemed to already be stopping. “Are you staying now?” He looked at Sherlock hopefully, ignoring the solid black eyes.
Sherlock didn't respond but instead grabbed the wrench from the DI and went to work on the pipe, ripping it apart. Half of the whole pipe was nearly destroyed with a large rat fell out with a small thud in a puddle below.
“She was having an affair with the gardener, you can tell by the way her gloves are worn. The murder weapon should be on the other side of the house, likely hidden in the gutter drains as a quick form of disposal. Her twin was just collateral damage, walked in at the wrong moment.”
“Oh, Mr Rogers?” The letter suddenly came back to him, “I think there’s been a misunderstanding, you see-“ The kettle whistled loudly from the kitchen. “S-sorry, just a moment.” John went to remove the water from the burner, Daniel following him.
“You seem awfully chipper this morning.” Sherlock ducked under the crime scene tape and held it up for John.
“It’s alright, it’s hardly your fault.” While leaving John’s right leg he was about to move on to massaging the left when he made a new discovery. “John! You’re poseable.”
“Join you, Yea.” It was painful to think that man had gone through so much misery when Sherlock hadn’t even been dead.
“Right… well, Sherlock does like weird gadgets I guess.” The device instantly started going off, rising and falling at a semi regular rate. John couldn’t help but smirk, setting it down on the table so it would have a flat surface. “I think someone already likes it.”
Greg’s whole body keened at the friction, how ever slight it was. “More, please, Fuck I need-” He pleaded.
“Wait a minute here, you’ve been alive this whole damn time?! I can’t believe you! You have no idea how many people you have hurt! John-… John-… he really didn’t take it well at all.”
Lestrade sat leaning over his desk peering at a map with small bullet points marked over it. Some were crossed off, locations officers had already gone to and cleared. There was just not enough evidence in this case. Harry could literally be anywhere, but he would do his best. He couldn’t let John down.
“Damn.” Greg had really thought that John was doing ok. But he didn’t want to report in to Mycroft about this. It just felt dirty. When it was just Sherlock he would report about, it was for a good reason. He couldn’t let him get back into drugs or any other risky behavior. But thus was John. Mycroft had no right to know. Lestrade let out a sigh. He didn’t want to ask John about it either.
“Just stop, what are you on about?” John stepped in front of the detective stopping him in his tracks.
“Never you mind that, lets get some food in you.” She made her way to the cupboards like a doting parent as John sank into his seat a bit further.
"You don't have to keep living in that hotel you know. It must be adding up." Grace Lestrade sipped daintily at her Mojito, watching her ex husband's expression carefully.
“I wont, Lock. I promise. You just need to calm down.” John gently pushed Sherlock back against the bed. “I think you have a fever.” Which would probably explain some of his odder then normal behavior.
“Oh?” John took a look at the envelopes; one was the nude man that was found the day before. The others appeared to be another man and a woman found in similar fashions. “Well, it’s not gender specific it seems.”
“That’s why you’re good kitty.” John nestled closer to the thin lanky frame and pressed a kiss against Sherlock’s collarbone. “Always be my kitty?”
'Did Sherlock just blush?' John had caught the faint red of his friend's face before he looked away. "You can't be serious. Sherlock, people can't see me like this."
“Are you-” He huffed in a breath of air, the tentacle was so close to his prostate now. “Doing that?”
“That’s Sherlock’s coat.” Mycroft practically whispered as Lestrade freed it from the chair. It was filthy from soot and water. “I really don’t like this.”
Sherlock checked his watch, this test was a time sensitive matter after all. “Alright then, put the shopping basket down, good. Now, on your knees.”
“Wherever those two are right now I just hope they’re together, they’re both lost without each other.”
Lestrade was torn. Clearly something wasn’t right. Was Mycroft unstable? Yet, there was something in the way he spoke that chilled him to the core.
“Everything alright?” He placed the pastries on the coffee table in front of Sherlock, sad that he was staring intently at the ground and seemed to be sitting there awkwardly.
“Cant they just step over the line of salt?” He was frustrated and defeated. He wanted to believe there was no one there, but a missing rope was evidence.
“John hand me my phone.” Sherlock was still facing the bodied in deep thought and couldn’t see the incredulous look on his flatmats face. John gave in, reaching inside Sherlock’s pocket to hand him his own damn phone.
"Very well, get on with it." He continued to watch the footage of the flat just in case something turned up.
I feel bad about that scene a few chapters back where Molly was crying... I want to make up for it. So next chapter she will have a bigger role :3
“This is idiotic! What is the point of all this?” He could tell John was alert and nervous, but he could see why yet.
Looking down at the silken ears John found it hard to resist, they were even softer then they looked. Sherlock craved the familiar touch of the firm ex army hands on him. The baritone purr shot through John’s spine.
It took John a moment to asses the image, he noticed the body type was much different from the previous images. “Well… he’s alright I guess… Five.”
Ella was surprised, John was so closed off about his private life that she couldn’t possibly imagine him wanting to bring someone in with him. “Of course.” She sat up straighter and straightened some files on the end table next to her seat.
"I'm no fool of course, I wont be offering you freedom for magic, I'll just be selling you to the highest bidder."
Sherlock loosened his stiff posture a bit. It was late afternoon and the light peering through the windows cast off Sherlock’s cheekbones, making them more prominent then normally.
John wondered if Sherlock actually just didn’t want people seeing him like this. He often peered around with a look of dread on his face.
“If it makes you feel better I will leave your boxers on, but you’re the one who will be regretting it once you’re out of the bath.”
Moriarty was still absolutely livid and already began plotting a fitting punishment for Moran. “Well go get it then,” he hissed through clenched teeth.
Another tentacle coiled around his waist, joining the first one as Mycroft began dragging him off through a hallway. Greg tried his best to grab at doors the passed by for leverage, but the appendages around his wrists were far too strong to fight off. They were nearing the end of the hallway when he managed to at least get his captured wrists closer to his face. Greg craned his head forward and bit deep into one of the tentacles. The one on Greg’s wrist immediately pulled away, freeing him for a moment as the other trembled in pain. Mycroft let out a painful shriek and crumpled to his knees as his eyes squeezed shut. Despite his circumstances, Greg actually felt bad about doing it. Somewhere in there was still the man he cared very deeply for.
He looked up the gnawed out hole that led back to the counter. He easily fit in the hole, but lacking the physical capabilities of a rat he could see no way to climb out.
“The idea that I might not find a cure did pass my mind and it seemed to be a good idea to plan ahead just in case.”
That was it, Greg snapped. He grabbed Grace's Mojito and splashed it directly in her face. False accusations or not, she wasn't about to get away with insulting Mycroft. Seeing the shock on her face was all worth it.
John typed the message out before he realized what he was saying. He hadn’t even completely admitted it to himself yet, but there it was.
“John! Wait-“ Sherlock stumbled to get up from the bed and knocked table lamp with his tail, he still had no idea how to control it, not that it would matter for long. “It’s not because I’m-“
Mycroft was dressed as impeccable as always and was holding a take away bag from a high-end bakery, he was clearly not expecting to see Lestrade in such a state. A raised an eyebrow before lifting up the bag, “Thought you might like something edible- impossible to know the state of the food in this flat.”
John stared in horror as the messages suddenly poured in faster then he could keep up with. “What have I done?” he breathed nervously.
"Really Sherlock, you shouldn't be talking to your pocket at a crime scene." Lestrade didn't normally linger around the man as he worked, but he also wasn't sure he could trust him out in public with someone in his pocket. Donovan bugged him enough about Sherlock's questionable sanity as is. Talking to himself certainly wouldn't make the situation any better.
“Don’t worry, I know what you mean, not something I really would have bought on my own. Actually, John picked them out for me.”
John was agitated. “Well… I didn’t want to say this but, I should probably you know… get more clothes. It’s already been three days now and…” his voice trailed off.
“I certainly hope so,” the man made his way past John, putting the box on the coffee table and taking a seat. “I was a but surprised you wanted me here today- good thing I saw the message on time. But I brought all my tenant’s receipts and even the security cam from the porch.”
The sleek surface made it easier, pushing it deep inside and waiting for his body to adjust to the new presence. He wasn’t sure why but the overwhelming fullness it made him feel was amazing. A loud moan escaped his throat, instantly turning his cheeks red as he hoped the walls between his room and the next were enough to conceal it.
“That’s yet to be seen.” He brought the doctor back closer to him to continue the kiss and felt himself smiling against the surprisingly soft lips.
Moriarty swiftly shut the front door and angled himself to force the old man backwards into the room he had previously emerged from. John could barely make out the quick flash of metal from Moriarty’s pocket.
“Sh-Sherlock?” John waited for something more to happen, but Sherlock could tell he had drained most of his energy already. John swallowed thickly, “Is that you?”
Sherlock cocked his head and straightened his back, looking at John a bit too intensely for the former soldier’s liking. “Ah, so you were doing something. Hmm, you didn’t have enough time to get dressed before you answered, so you weren’t changing your clothes…”
“No Ella, I wanted him to come. He just wants to- understand what’s been going on with me is all.” John said truthfully.
It was a long walk back to the flat and even John was getting cold from the rain, he couldn’t imagine how miserable Sherlock was. He only knew he was still there by the soft pattering of bare feet behind him.
Moran quickly nodded once and obeyed only pausing when he saw the sleek black car on a street camera also headed towards the warehouse.
“You frequent there often, mentioned it on the blog a few times. She likely moved here just to meet you, got a job there and waited for an opportunity.”
“Relax Sherlock, it’s Tobby.” The cat was lying down and released the struggling detective. “It’s Molly’s cat remember… no, you most definitely would have deleted that.”
“You have no boyfriends or close friends that would be messaging you at this hour of the night. Your face showed that the text was of some importance and you immediately began getting ready to leave.” Sherlock smiled smugly. “See John, I can still solve cases.”
“Just trying to get through the door,” He avoided eye contact with her and noticed Sherlock outside the small flat had stopped to wait for John.
He passed over a ruler that had been taped to the autopsy table and a counter top as a bridge for the tiny detective to use. John sat on the cold tile counter with his hands wrapped around his legs and eyes down cast. He knew Harry could likely end up like this poor dead woman across from him, it was all he could think of.
“Stop deducing me or whatever you call it and focus on him,” Lestrade gestured to the dead man. “I’ll tell you the rest once he’s on the road.”
Sherlock nodded and placed his hands on John’s chest and ran them downwards just as slowly. “yes.” He did the same to his legs and ended by cupping John’s still bare feet. “Yes. Ah! Stop that! You’re tickling me!”
“Well it’s late and I should be getting home,” Mycroft cleared his throat, “I’ll just uh, take them both with me then.”
How could he possibly explain that every night in his dreams he saw Sherlock falling? Heard his last words again and again? Regretted not saying more? Not doing more? Wondering if he could have somehow stopped it? Knowing things would never be the same again.
Moriarty came around the corner brandishing his gun with a cocky smile. He waited patiently in the space the door would cover once it opened. The door opened a small crack at first, the intruder testing the waters. Cautiously, Sherlock stepped into view. John’s eyes widened in panic, he knew his voice was too small for Sherlock to hear from that distance. Banging his fist against the glass only produced a small ‘ping.’
John walked briskly down the hall, all he wanted was to catch a cab back home as soon as possible and be spared further embarrassment. ‘
Sherlock had been following John all day, getting annoyed when he suddenly left the room without warning. He closed his eyes, practically willing himself to be there. A moment later he found he was standing in his room by John. He swallowed, he had just in essence teleported himself across the flat.
Sherlock propped her up in one of the chairs before continuing studying the evidence. Twenty minutes later her eyelids began to flutter open.
Sherlock glanced over at the kitchen at first wondering where John had gone, his eyes widened in horror as he saw the kitchen slowly burn down.
Lestrade come back in wearing his usual work attire, “Crime scene, possibly another serial victim. Er, I sort of need you on this one Sherlock.”
Sherlock sat in a chair in the waiting room, eyes closed and hands in a praying position just in front of his chin. Lestrade looked away assuming the detective was in his 'mind palace' but in reality he was just trying to keep from having another outburst of unnecessary emotions.
“ ‘M sorry kitty. Was mad bout you being bad cat. But you’s not bad cat, you’s very good kitty.” John tried stroking the black silken ears much to Sherlock’s annoyance.
Sherlock let out a heavy sigh but continued on. Having no idea where he was going or which way was home was driving him mad. “Well, you could at least take my hand.” He huffed.
“And you have been sitting in this cab quietly and instead of thinking of your date tonight with a woman you have been thinking of men
He had turned on every light in the flat, making sure it was as well lit as possible. There were no signs of a break in at all, and given that whatever was going on seemed to be repeating its self for all the tenants, it was possible the perpetrator had another way of getting in.
John looked rather surprised by that, “Oh, its not that big a deal, really.” Although it would have been a better idea to grab at least one night’s worth of supplies before he and Greg had headed over earlier.
He breathed deeply trying to reassure himself that he would get back in the flat and find a safe spot that Sherlock would be sure to see him in. '
“I shouldn’t have doubted you. Of course you’ll figure something out.” He whispered before closing the gap between him and Sherlock’s nose, pressing his lips against it in gentle kiss.
"What? Why do you assume this is my fault? Granted you're very technically right, but still!" Sherlock quickly came over, taking John out of Lestrade's clumsy hands. "And be careful with him."
John could feel the hand squeeze around him, his arms pinned to his body as his torso was slowly crushed. “Maria! You’re crushing me!” he barely managed to gasp out.
Sebastian hit Sherlock’s head with the butt of his rifle instantly causing him to lose consciousness. John looked on in disbelief.
“I really should have had you wear looser pants before the last experiment.” He pushed John back onto the bed and began undoing the zipper.
Hands sliding away, the detective planted one more kiss on his doctor before lifting himself out of the pocket. “I need to be closer.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s arm and practically dragged him out the door. That had been the final straw, he was going home. He didn’t care if Lestrade followed and tried to break them up or not.
John looked back up at the swamp grey green eyes that were locked on him. “I think I might, well, you see-“
Everyone John had ever known came to visit him in the hospital after that. He knew they all knew exactly why he was there. None of them asked him, they all pretended to be in good spirits and that ‘everything would be ok.’ At least death would have saved him this embarrassment.
‘I assure you, I will be perfectly fine. But I will be unable to contact you until the storm has passed.’ –MH
John was hyperventilating at the edge of the roof, Sherlock gathered it was a safe bet to assume he knew what building they were on top of. He grabbed John by the waist and pulled him away from the ledge.
Greg ignored them, he needed the truth before it drove him insane. “I don’t know what the fuck is happening, and yea, there’s kinda some freaky shit happening with you right now. But damn it Myc, I love you. I just have to know if this is mutual.” He grabbed Mycroft’s waist to pull him closer.
“Ah! What are you doing! What if someone sees me?!” He scrambled to his feet once Sherlock placed him on a shelf at his face level with miniature clothes.
“Hold on, if he’s not leaving his house, why don’t you just go see him?” Seemed like the most obvious advice, John reasoned. “After all this time, you must have his address?”
“Trust me, you could pay my rent for my entire life and I don’t think I would be getting the better deal.” John sighed.
“Yes, obviously lovers, this was likely a hate crime. Probably someone who didn’t frequent the area much but had stalked these two to this spot.”
John had a hard enough time just staying on top of it. John was the kind of person that would become upset if a small spider had fallen on his clothing, now he was riding one like a bull at a rodeo. Nothing will ever scare him again.
“Can’t say. Its not an active case.” He had desperately wanted it to be, but there was too much evidence that it was a straightforward suicide for him to open a case. “Even I wasn’t allowed to see him after,” Like John, his sentence turned to ash on his tongue, the ending fading away.
Lestrade bit his lower lip but decided he just had to risk it. He palmed Sherlock, still checking that no one was watching,
He met Sherlock's lips with his own. "Better now." He moaned in his detective's mouth. He was soon straddling him, kisses deepening.
Originally John had planned on tiptoeing inside the flat and avoiding his flatmate at all costs, but as soon as he stepped inside he saw the couch had been shredded to pieces with strings littering the carpet.
A few moments passed in silence before Sherlock returned with a cup of what appeared to be tea in his hands. “Affects should wear off well before then.” He held the cup up to John.
"We investigated the scene yesterday, I suspect they weren't the first victims. But since there were two it stood out. Might have been a mistake, the perpetrator only meant to kill one of them and poisoned the other by mistake. Or our killer is taking greater risks. Hard to say."
He took a moment to take in his surroundings; someone had obviously moved the jar when he was asleep. John now sat on the edge of a shelf able to view the cluttered room with more ease. What appeared to be the front door of the residence was in clear view “It shouldn’t be too hard to get through that, but it’s a long drop down and I’m still in this damn jar.” John bit down lightly on his bottom lip.
“It has to be real, please Sherlock, I need this to be real. If it’s not real, then you’re not here…” John had crumpled to his knees on the floor, Sherlock immediately went to his aid.
“John wait, I need you,” Sherlock just had to stop them. He looked at the few pieces of furniture in there and noticed one of the dresser drawers wasn’t fully closed. He gathered all the energy he could muster up and forced it shut. Making a satisfying sound. All three of them immediately turned back towards the room, searching it frantically now.
“You’re uncharacteristically quiet today John.” The deep baritone voice snapped him from his thoughts.
Sherlock rarely found people who wanted to team up with him, and even rarer did he find people that he wanted in his party.
Molly choked out another sob, trying to steady herself. She knew there was no way she could live with this guilt. “Sherlock… I didn’t know how to tell you, this wasn’t suppose to happen. But then, he really died and…”
“Just one more night.” John felt so strangely welcomed in this room now. He thought staying in it would scare him before; remind him of what he lost. But John felt so surrounded by his friend’s presence, it was well worth the cold. He slipped into the sheets, trying his best not to shiver.
“So he’s not really a friend, have you considered meeting some new people? Maybe joining a club at school or going on dates?”
John chuckled lightly to himself as he remembered what Ella had told him about Sherlock. “It could be an interesting session.”
"…and by under the weather I mean shrunk." Sherlock muttered seeing Lestrade discovered their secret.
“I’m glad he liked them. I hope you do too. They would go nicely with that dress you wore to the Christmas party last year.” Unknown Sender.
John eyed the cup next to him and took it, it was warm in his hands, recently made. “But you never make tea… oh my god. I didn’t…”
Once in the cab relatively behind closed doors John started telling Sherlock all the reasons why this stunt was
After the initial investigation of the flat, Lestrade’s hands were tied. There was nothing more he could do other then fill out a report and wait for something more to happen. But there was also the matter of John Watson to consider. It was the last case that he had agreed to go on with Sherlock, and he knew that John was intending to go through with it. He let Sally get a head start to their squad car and waited for John.
"It was massive! The biggest rat I have ever seen right at my feet!" Sherlock crouched to the floor to see where it had gone to no avail. "John? You alright?"
John’s phone chimed in his pocket. He awkwardly pulled it out, shifting the pastries to one arm to check his texts.
John woke to the faint smell of cigarette smoke and something strangely chemical. Not wanting to wake up just yet he kept his eyes closed and pushed his face deeper into the pillow immediately feeling skin against his forehead.
I’m only joking. But please Sherlock. I want to see you. You’re amazing and brilliant and completely mad at times but that’s why I love you.
"Finish that sentence and I will strangle you in your sleep!" John's voice was so loud that Harry turned around expecting to see him standing right behind her.
John pulled his phone out and swiped it open. It was just Greg texting about anything he might need from the flat.
“That first night here with you… you changed my life. You didn’t just fix my limp, you fixed me. Gave me a purpose. I don’t have a purpose now.”
“Uh… Well I guess that’s true. Never really thought about it, not that it matters. Why are we talking about this?”
Molly, posing for the moment as a private detective, had done her best to memorize the questions Sherlock had her write down. Some seemed rather unimportant, and other flat out rude, but she did her best regardless.
Sherlock had been slowly grooming John to be a detective and make his own deductions. As many times as he called him an ‘idiot’ and ‘ordinary’, even Sherlock could see that John was clearly above average intelligence. Had the detective been there that day, he would have been very proud of his blogger.
“Guess I underestimated you,” Lestrade elbowed John while smirking. “Didn’t know you could do that too, might give Sherlock a run for his money.”
Sherlock brought the egg over, cutting off a small piece for John, which was very large for him by comparison. Sherlock ate the rest, never being one for a big appetite.
Sherlock had wanted desperately to find something to give John even a shred of hope that they would find his sister before it was too late, but his prospects were looking dismal for the flat. They would have to attempt to retrace her footsteps. John sat against the white curved wall of the cup close enough that his leg brushed against Sherlock as he peeked into the room. He would occasionally look up glossy eyed and catch the moments the detective would look down to check on him, no hint of any leads on his expressionless face.
"How did you…?" She stopped speaking abruptly the second Sherlock opened his hands to reveal the tiny doctor crouched in them.
John chuckled as Sherlock walked off to get a better look, “Show off. He only says things like that when he’s trying to impress me.” He smiled fondly.
“Let me have a look at it” Sherlock took out his small microscope and peered though it, John understood why he needed the microscope but it still made him feel self conscious.
"No. No. No. How many times do I have to tell you? His jaw was rounder and the angle of his eyes were-"
Mycroft played the saved footage from the night before. It wasn't the clearest film due to the light rain, but it showed something that rather peeked his interests.
"What are you doing there?" He scooped his doctor up into his palms before hearing the knocking of the door.
“Boys! Boys!?” Sherlock could hear Mrs. Hudson fumbling up the steps just in time to cover a sulking John with his palm against the table before she came in. “Oh Sherlock, is everything alright?”
John narrowed his eyes, he had a strong dislike of Donovan for the way she treated Sherlock and constantly referred to him as a ‘freak,’ but she was by no means naïve or paranoid. If she thought she had seen something, chances are, she likely did.
Every few meters a fish flopped up in the water in there usual mating ritual that time of season. Sally dutifully began looking around for a net and Greg stepped to the edge of the dock. “Get back over here!” he tried to mask his voice with his hand, but it seemed it was too soft for them to hear.
John glanced down at where his phone was resting on the table. He had half expected it to light up with a message at any moment. It seemed it was constantly receiving messaged the last few days. People he could hardly even remember, sending their condolences. As kind a gesture as that was, it was just exhausting. He had stopped sending back ‘thank you’ texts and hadn’t answered his phone unless it was work. Normalcy would be highly welcomed about now, not that he could ever slip back to his old life again. Not without Sherlock.
Sherlock feels bad about it, he really didn’t want to hurt John like this, make him think he died. But it was necessary of course, and he knows John will be mad, furious even, but it’s worth saving his life. It’s more then worth the punch to the face he knows he will get and the angry lecture about doing things ‘a bit not good.’ He did try to tell John at least, that it was just a magic trick, did John really never observe? Besides, it’s only for one afternoon. John will come back any minute now, naturally still upset about what had happened, but then he’ll see Sherlock spread across his chair with a wide grin.
“Hang on!” thinking fast, John tried undoing the string of the sails so he could pass it down to Sherlock, he wasn’t fast enough.
Mycroft bit back a reply, once in the flat they could hear the small choking sobs coming from the dollhouse. They would need Sherlock for this one, and he couldn’t leave John like this.
“It’s time we both went back home.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist, the heels made him almost as tall as the detective so he didn’t need to bend over to make up the difference as their lips met. John could finally tell him what he wanted to say on that morning at St. Barts.
“The… we’re not being chased by the hound from our visit to the Baskervills?” Sherlock was sure this was some fear left over from that case.
“Um, sorry, I should just check that.” Molly’s chain of questions were beginning to fall flat and she wondered if Sherlock was trying to tell her to just drop the interview already. She looked confusedly at the tiny detective until he pointed frustratingly at the phone were his message was.
Until then, there was the highly important matter of what to wear. With a defeated sigh he pulled out his cell phone and dialed Molly’s number.
John shook his head, “Daniels said he couldn’t think of anyone. Doesn’t mean there isn’t though.” He typed in the address of the flat to google to look it up. There was a picture, courtesy of google earth, but no real information on the place.
Greg’s phone buzzed in his pocket, he expected it to be Sherlock with a lead and explanation why he wasn’t there, what he didn’t expect was Mycroft on the other end of line.
But there was nothing. No angry shouts or outbursts. Nothing being thrown as he might have suspected. Not even whispers. John nearly peered around the corner of the kitchen to make sure they were still there when the kettle began whistling for him. Tea bags already in place, he poured three cups. The water turning dark from the brew. John felt his hands balling to fists at his sides, his uneasy feeling growing. He shook his head, needing to bring himself back out of this weird phobia he seemed to be developing. It was nothing more then a teacup and he needed to get ahold of himself. He carefully arranged the cups and a bowl of sugar on a tray before walking back towards the living room, making sure he didn’t announce his return. But there was no tail end of a muffled conversation to be caught.
“What?” John stepped close to the computer and flicked his mouse so the screen would light up. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
Sherlock headed down the hall through the atrociously lumpy carpet that could really use a wash and towards what he believed to be Molly’s room. “I have no idea what you’re talking about, why wouldn’t we go back to our flat?”
The earthquake subsided as quickly as it began. Mycroft pushed the shelves back into place for his brother to stand. Sherlock quickly unscrewed the lid slowly tilting the jar on it’s side for John to gain his footing. The doctor scurried out onto the inviting palm and grabbed onto the thumb.
“What?” he turned to see the dollhouse prematurely lit up, “Good. He’ll have to watch his pet burn to death before the bees then” The screen started to blur and had static line interrupting the feed. Moriarty’s eyes narrowed. “What is this? What the bloody hell is wrong with my screen?”
“It would be helpful if you filled me in. Seriously, anything would help me out here.” John blinked. The gills had only come out because Sherlock was in water. He was behaving like a fever-ridden person. Was it the storm? Was this what Mycroft had warned him about?
Sherlock leaned in closer to John and was met by a pair of surprisingly soft lips for someone who spends half his time licking them.
“The wounds appear to all be of different varieties though. Some deep, others shallow. Most are right handed, but a few were made with a left hand. There were multiple attackers.”
"Out of my way!" Sherlock stood up with great force putting John back on the table and brought out his pocket magnifying glass searching the small man all over for any possible injury. "If he's hurt in any way you'll never hear the end of it."
The two tentacles spread him open as a third slowly pressed its way inside. Mycroft noticed that Greg was no longer struggling against him but was now a willing participant.
The flame started, John jumped back and quickly looked back at Sherlock who in turn looked back at the clock.
Sherlock spread his fingers over the door, wishing he could be face to face with John right now. But he couldn’t even slip through solid surfaces now.
Maria drug the tip of the blade softly against Harry’s cheek. “I’ll be there for him of course. Once he finds your dead tortured body. He’ll see how uncaring an emotionless that man is, and he’ll come back to me.”
“I’m up I’m up, you don’t have to keep calling me name.” John rubs the sleep from his eyes as Sherlock smiles down at him.
Sherlock went back up, thoroughly irritated he couldn’t leave. Hopefully he would find some way around that soon. It was bound to get terribly boring in 221b all day without the ability to touch anything.
“Well it didn’t sound like a joke.” Sherlock had of course been listening in, leaning against the counter the whole time. Except for when he knocked the mug over. “He could be preying on you in your weakened emotional state.” He tisked. “Besides, you don’t seem to be anywhere close to telling him I’m here. Maybe I’ll just have to do it myself.”
Sherlock tossed plates and cups every where looking for his doctor, unable to hear the tiny voice through the wood and tiles below him. The thought of finding John injured or worse was too much. "John!?" his eyes blurred as they moistened. Once everything was off the counter besides an old blender with still no sign of John, Sherlock knew something wasn't right.
“Dearest Sherlock- hope you don’t mind I borrowed it, I can think of so many fun possibilities.” Lestrade cringed as he read it out loud.
He flexed his hands a few times, making fists and then relaxing them. Going over what he would say in his mind if the door opened.
Mycroft waited impatiently in his car. He saw Sherlock pick the lock and walk in, that meant he should have been able to find John and come back by now.
Greg let out a long sigh and ran his hand through his greying hair. “At your flat, I found…” His eyes were focused on the ground. He didn’t want to ask, he really didn’t. But hell, he had already lost one friend this week, he couldn’t loose John to unsound reasoning now. He looked back up at John, his eyes filled with concern. “I don’t know that Ouija boards are the right answer, mate.”
There was really nothing more he could say. “Jenny! I’m joking of course!” he shot Sherlock a look of pure rage. “Ha, me and my weird sense of humor. But um, something has come up actually.”
“John you need to stop! Look around you, none of this makes sense, there’s nothing chasing us, it isn’t real.”
I had to look up if Lestrade has a gun or not for this chapter. British police of course don’t, but since he’s a DI I wasn’t sure. But in S2E2, Lestrade shoots at the hound of the Baskervilles with his own gun.
"What's going on now?" Lestrade grasped the door handle after Sherlock got in the car to prevent him from taking off right away.
Sherlock sat at the opposite end of the table in a chair that had not been properly pushed back as he watched his flatmate- which he felt they still were since he was evidently haunting the place. John had really seen and heard him in his dream, felt him even. That meant he might be able to communicate with him that way, but it also meant he would be running the risk of being thought of as imaginary. His options were rather limited so far though.
Sherlock looks out the window and finds it’s early morning. He makes a note to himself to tell Mrs. Hudson her eyesight has clearly been going if she didn’t notice him there. He leaves and goes back to 221b, the door is locked, not as he left it.
Still in a sleep like state he tried to remember what had happened the night before that would have left him in this position.
John frowned at the tea he had made that went untouched. “You gonna tell me what all that was about?”
He told himself that this will lead to a higher chance of Sherlock finding him, after all, Mycroft certainly had enough funds to bid for him or at least steal him. He sank back into a seated position with his head against the glass.
“How do you turn this thing off?” Lestrade looked around for a remote, but when he finally spotted it, the tv went off on its own. The detective nearly jumped out of his skin. “The hell!?” He could feel his heart pounding. He wasn’t sure why, but it just didn’t sit right with him. “You’re not pranking me, are you?”
“I don’t need anyone else in my life right now. I’m… I’m happy as is.” He barely recognized the words coming from his own mouth. He had a string of meaningless relationships when he had first moved in with Sherlock, names and faces that faded in and out of his life. They always seemed so important while he dated them, yet he never mourned the loss of any of them whenever he was dumped- usually for being distant towards them. “And besides, it’s not as if I’ve been living alone for years.” A small smirk was quickly hidden by a fake cough. “or live with a bunch of cats, that sort of thing.”
“Everything all right?” John hadn’t noticed he had unconsciously leaned down to Sherlock’s eye level, his hand resting on Sherlock’s knee to keep his balance.
“John?” he whispered from the doorway, maybe he would hear him again like he had that morning. But John barely stirred. Sherlock drew closer, John was breathing heavily with his eyes squeezed shut, possibly having a nightmare Sherlock thought. He knew it would probably do no good, but Sherlock tried rubbing the side of John’s face with his hand to sooth him.
“Am I boring?” Sherlock didn’t make any form of movement, he didn’t even look up at John. His voice was flat with no emotion in it.
Two weeks passed and things were back to normal. Relative normal. As normal as living with Sherlock could possibly be… while also hiding a daring new fashion collection.
“This is definitely the same killer, just more ambitious. Could be because the victim fought back first, or maybe the killer is taking things up a notch. It’s not enough to just kill them now. The next victim will be in worse shape.”
He pushed the wall until it reached the arm of Sherlock’s chair. The detective could move his hand just enough to stabilize it as his tiny blogger ran across the blazing wood and reached him.
“Not much, unless you want to stay here till 3am,” he smiled wearily, “Supposedly ghost activity picks up then.” He really detested referring to his friend as a ‘ghost.’ “Oh, and I’m banning sage from ever entering the flat.”
Sherlock quickly scooted back but hadn’t stood yet, mortified that he had been screaming for his life. “It…. it tried to kill me, you saw it.” he avoided eye contact with John at all costs. He could feel him walk over and kneel down next to him making his face go hot.
An hour passed with no signs of any change, the miniature Moriarty began to fear he had made his first bad decision.
Saying he would be fine soon relieved Molly a bit though. She leaned closer to him. "He's just so small!"
Sherlock frantically wrote notes in a thick composition book, “The initial exam is very important John. I have quite a few experiments I would like to run but I need to get this data first. Make sure then you aren’t compromised between experiments.”
John stands facing Sherlock, a wide grin on his face, “Sherlock you utter and complete bastard, where are you?”
Looming over him clad in his black coat ready to leave for the crime scene was Sherlock, complete with a pair of soft black cat ears sticking out of his hair. “John? You’ve gone pale…”
“I know what it is!” He snapped, “Why is there more of it? I know how much there was left and this is significantly more. Why s there… you didn’t.” John stared at his flatemate incredulously. “Sherlock, why?”
It wasn’t until a particularly cold day when John showed up in his dark jacket sporting the blue scarf that the officers were officially done taking his insults. Their glares were unnoticed at first; John had gotten to work immediately deducing what had happened. Finally Lestrade pulled him aside.
"Oh Sherlock! I didn't know you where in here, I didn't mean to surprise you." She had noticed his sudden action in dropping the phone as she came in. "Mind if I use the microscope?" Before letting Sherlock answer she had moved very close to him. Her eyes naturally gazed down as the cell phone; the screen was still lit up with the conversation on it.
John looked her over, performing one of his own ‘Sherlock scans’. ‘Depressed. Shopping for over priced clothes to look better, doesn’t know what to buy or what look to go with. Little knowledge on changing appearances.’ He licked his lower lip. ‘I really shouldn’t…’
Sherlock was already taking John’s shirt off and threw it to the side. He had seen the scar on John’s  shoulder in passing when he had come out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel before, but he had never seen it up close until now. His eyes lingered on it until he forced himself to look away.
Greg adjusted himself in his seat and scratched at his neck a bit awkwardly. “Well, to tell the truth, Mycroft wanted me to come over and encourage you to see some grief councilor or something like that. At the very least...”
Four kicks in and he could finally hear the crunching of the abdomen giving way beneath his feet. Once it was open he gave one more thrust exploding the contents onto the floor. He scurried off and out of the room.
John had a tilted smile and shook his head fondly. How was Sherlock this bloody crazy and so amusing at once?
“Mild? Lock, you shrank over a foot!” he plopped down in his chair, might as well be comfortable while waiting the inevitable.
“I forbid you from leaving me today!” Sherlock raced down the stairs. He knew he couldn’t get past that point.
John felt cool fingers wrap around his waist and gently pull him up and into a towel. He blushed deeply and hid himself in the significantly oversized towel. “Er, thanks.
“Interesting.” He scribbled some more and checked his watch. Sherlock looked back up and John and smiled. “Of course I’ve never actually tested this drug before so the time results could vary, it could be an hour, two hours, or days.”
“One day you might,” Sherlock whispered quietly. He wasn’t sure why he was here now that he had time to think on his situation. He had never actually thought of the possibilities of what would happen after death beyond the body decomposing. He assumed it would be like a dreamless sleep, that you just stopped existing.
There was a horrible howl that came from the direction John had been running away from. John had a look of pure terror as he glanced over his shoulder, “We don’t have enough time, come on Lock!” He grabbed Sherlock’s hand, it felt as real as anything, and began running again. The deafening howl only got louder as it gained speed on them.
Sherlock dipped his head into the crook of John’s neck, taking in his scent. “Because you’re meant to be smaller.”
John took a step back “It’s just catnip, it’s nothing special.” Those big pale eyes were pleading with him, “Er, of course. Whatever you like.”
Sherlock had the same thought. They could both clearly see where his shirt was fluttering beneath the water. It had felt like a deep laceration to John, but there was no blood. Had he cut himself on the glass earlier? His shirt certainly wasn’t torn.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “He does have a wedding ring on. We should see if anyone reported a missing husband recently.”
Your therapist has been living alone for the past five years and owns three cats. I thought this information might be useful if she questions you in a manner you don’t like again. – SH
Now it was John’s turn to look expectantly as he pointed to his mouth. Sherlock only smirked. “Lestrade texted while I was in the middle of trying a new command.”
“It would have to be someone who would be aware of these other victims popping up, someone who would immediately see the connection and become concerned.”
“You know he’s a loon right? He’s probably not safe to be around, he even laughs while at crime scenes.” Her words were muffled but cut like daggers.
John looked at the porn he was no longer paying attention to, that was the title. He immediately stopped it.
Just as John was pushing him through the door and helping to carefully lower the chair down the steps, Mycroft called one more thing out to him, “Your therapist is still coming tomorrow like always, do be here, you still need him. Try to… keep safe.”
John couldn’t take it anymore and joined his side. The closet was empty. “What if they’re somewhere else in the flat?”
“We should check the rest of the place too, the attack might have happened in here, but we have a whole flat to search.” Lestrade turned, ignoring the closet door.
“Could be haunted,” John took a long sip of his tea, growing strangely nervous as the words left his mouth.
Sherlock scoffed, “Inconclusive evidence, you did not overcome the command like I had anticipated and by the following day the affects had worn off.”
John opened both eyes and rolled over until he was pressed against Sherlock’s side. “You like this scarf.” He elongated the sentence for emphasis.
“Right,” Lestrade kept his hand firmly on him. He believed that John might not want to return to his own flat where there were countless items to remind him of their late friend.  “If-” he nervously licked his lower lip, “if there’s anything you need, even from your flat, I’ll be happy to grab it for you.”
John didn’t think his day could drag on any longer, Wednesdays were hell, he had calculus first thing in the morning which he often found himself nodding off during these past few weeks due to his late nights, then political science just after noon. All he could do was think of his unexpected present from his strange friend. It really did seem like a waist to let such an item go unused… John snapped out of his thoughts, he had completely zoned out in the middle of his teacher’s lecture. He tried reminding himself that he wasn’t even interested in that sort of thing, only girls and a good old fashioned wank than you very much. But he found he couldn’t help but wonder what it must be like, after all, there seemed to be a lot of people that did seem to enjoy, perhaps he was being too rash in not giving it a try first.
John began kicking the blackening floor, it finally gave way, he had just enough time to push it down, flames now licking at the edges up towards him. He jumped through the barely big enough hole not minding the flames. He was much thinner the spider and the creature didn’t want to risk being burned to go after food it seemed. John was out. ‘
Lestrade chuckled and waved him off, “He must drive you crazy mate, I know he does me and I only work with him.”
John stood awkwardly in front of the movie theater sized computer screen. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock wanted him to post anything about them being an official couple yet, he usually would become very flustered whenever John posted about his life. He looked back at the screen to find a new message.
Sherlock was thoughtful in his own way. John couldn’t help but let out a snicker as he tried to sneak read the text.
John’s expression fell a bit, but remained relatively optimistic. “You’re inside though. Safe from the weather or whatever?” Wasn’t that enough?
“And by work you mean following your flat mate around so you can spend your free time writing about him?”
There was a bleep that didn’t go with the rest of the music, confusing him at first, the second time it happened he knew it was about to send him over the edge.
John woke early the following morning, his eyes still stinging a bit from the night before. He got up wearily, rubbing his eyes as his vision came back to him. He had gotten as far as the doorway, still clad in his pajamas, when his dream came back to him. It was nearly over whelming. He had the chance to see Sherlock again, talk to him, touch him even, and he had wasted it thinking he was making breakfast. Even if it was just a dream, he hated himself for not taking such a great moment to say so much more.
“Oh, that. Well yes, happened last night when I fell down that damn hole- which we should really fix before Mrs. Hudson adds it onto the rent.”
“I don’t think you understand. You have only been writing about your ‘flat mate.’ You never mention your work at the hospital or any of your girlfriends. You don’t even mentioned girlfriends to me anymore.”
John leaned in close to Sherlock’s ear, “That was really rude, you don’t just talk about things like that in front of people.”
“Hm?” John looked him over; Lestrade was clearly under a lot of stress and possibly stress eating. “Wait, you mean Mycroft? So, does he always do this during storms or something?”
“Not at that time, I didn’t.” As he approached, Greg realized that Mycroft’s clothes were soaking wet. Not like his own from standing in the rain, but as if he had been submerged in water.
Greg shifted a bit, It was true, to be fair. “Well, some of those unspeakable things weren’t exactly unappreciated.”
. His younger brother didn't seem to be brooding in the least that his flatmate/ partner/ blogger/ friend wasn't helping him with his newest case. No extra groceries had been brought in for the supposedly bedridden John, not even medicine. The only out of place visitor they had was John's sister, albeit that did reinforce the possibility the doctor was sick if she was paying them a visit.
The door slammed shut on John. He immediately turned to attempt the handle, but it refused to turn. He slammed on the door and screamed out for help. There was no way Sherlock would have done this to him.
“What were you about to stay? That’s not even a reason, just a way to hide it. So why?” John stepped closer to Sherlock making the taller man feel cornered.
Sherlock stepped closer to his now relatively speaking taller blogger. “Because even if I couldn’t find a way to get you back to normal, I didn’t want to miss out on this forever.” He leaned forward and met John’s lips with his. Their first true kiss as a couple.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock seemed unsure. He let out a little growl, what was he even thinking, the odds of it happening seemed utterly impossible. And yet… what Mycroft had showed him had left him speechless. If it was true, if he was in fact what he feared he could be, he would of course have to tell John. There would be no other way around it if he wanted to keep him as a friend. Besides, there was no reason to believe he was dangerous, it was just Mycroft over reacting again.
Sherlock frowned and brought his second hand up as a protective barrier around John, “Well you can see clearly that it’s not, now if you don’t mind we would both like to go home.”
“I’m coming with you.” John grabbed a coat. If Sherlock was around, which he likely was, he hoped he joined them. It seemed possible at least if Sherlock really was in his office at the hospital the other day.
John on the other hand was growing rather use to odd sounds at unexpected times. Could it have been Sherlock? If so, why did he choose now to make a sound? Was he trying to tell them there was something here? He shook his head, this was like trying to find someone lost in a well because Lassie barked at you. He hung his head down for a moment as he held the top of the dresser and held onto it. “I just need something more clear.” He mumbled, hoping Donovan and Lestrade wouldn’t hear him. “like that thing you did with my hands.” Even he could hardly hear himself whisper that part.
Sherlock picked John up bridal style like the night before, supporting his head on his chest, limp arms hanging loosely by his sides.
John was beginning to see the perks of being small. He could hide in Sherlock's pocket all day without having to put up with people like Donovan and Anderson, food was in vast abundance, he was off work 'sick', and for once he had Sherlock's complete and undivided attention. In the past two days the detective hadn't been to his mind palace once. It's not that the doctor wanted Sherlock to be so hyper focused about him, but it was a nice change of pace from being ignored days on end while Sherlock was trapped in his mind.
John sighed, He wasn’t looking forward to a conversation where he had to ask Mycroft blood Holmes is he had gills or not. So much for people thinking all politicians were reptilians. John furrowed his brow. Were there reptilians?? He would have to revisit this thought later.
Lestrade marched around, looking everywhere for the detective. But came up empty handed. “Sherlock… I could have sworn I…” Shit. Maybe he was starting to loose it.
“It… could be… which would also prove beneficial. Though I’m not sure how we could help Daniel if that is the case.”
The third morning John woke up sprawled across the foot of Sherlock’s bed in the nude and confused as hell.
“So cases might still be a regular thing, that would be…” strange, John thought. “But when you did it, you weren’t just moving the planchette were you? You were… it felt like you were inside my hands actually…” He stared down at his hands, remembering the strange feeling. “Do you think you could do that again?”
“Myc, please-” Greg knew he must be pretty desperate if he was even considering this tactic. “You’re not well, you need help.”
For Sherlock it was the opposite. John seemed to be just an average mundane man at first, slightly above average intelligence, possibly valuable medical knowledge. But something had always driven him to find out more about his short flat mate. He had realized it two months after John agreed to move in with him. The man faked his way through life pretending he cared about other mundane things that he so clearly hadn’t. If he was actually as frustrated with Sherlock as he often claimed to be, then he would have moved out, not followed the detective on every life threatening mission he possibly could. Even stranger to Sherlock, John did care about one person at least.
"You're being over dramatic again, if you couldn't breath in there then you would have already died by now. Besides, I thought you were still napping." Sherlock reached in his pocket to pull John out."
“Shite, sorry.” John quickly opened it, feeling even more like a fool then ever before. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
Sherlock bit hit lip and quickly stopped, trying to seem indifferent. “Oh that one is boring, try..-“
“Because I’m Sherlock bloody Holmes!” John mimicked. “And I have the biggest ego of all of mankind!”
Safe. That was a funny thing to say when they were still in a war zone. But still, John relaxed a bit from those words. He was as far away from water as he could be with very little chance of coming near a large body of it any time soon.
"There was a child here when I first came around the corner. DAMN IT LESTRADE! He must have found John and taken him!"
The detective tried everything, but he couldn’t force John into the bathtub. “You have fleas. Don’t play dumb, I know you can understand me now. You are getting in this tub!”
“Energy conversion… that’s it!” Sherlock quickly got to his feet. He was sucking the heat out of the room, he needed a greater amount of energy to cause anything to happen. People ran on food, he no longer had that luxury… though that suited his former appetite just fine anyway. Not having to eat could be benefit.
"Don't step anywhere!" Sherlock's voice boomed across the flat before he popped up from behind the couch, hair in a mess.
Having a 'minor position in the government' affords Mycroft something his little brother doesn't have, discretion. He was better at hiding it of course, but in private, and especially if he was already having an off day, Mycroft could be every bit as socially awkward as his brother often was, and to be fair, it was of great importance to find the D.I. and get him back to Scotland Yard.
It was a small leap into the boat for John and Sherlock followed by pushing the remote in first and then dropping off the dock with a small thud on the boat sending it into a light rocking.
“Like what? A concerned friend? Lots of people are into these thing, honest. It doesn’t make you gay either if that’s what you’re concerned about- not that there’s anything wrong with being gay, or any other orientation.”
“I’m sorry, I… I just needed to.” He couldn’t quite explain it, but he finally didn’t feel so overwhelmingly dried out.
John frowned as he got up and slowly dressed for the day, he knew what he had to do no matter how much he didn’t want to go through with it. He confronted the sulking detective on the couch.
“There isn’t any. We checked every where, but there’s no sign of struggle. No sign anyone has even been inside the place in a while. The owner said that room isn’t occupied, not since the last tenant left.”
A beep came from his computer that had been set on sleep mode. Jolting out of his thoughts, John left the plain brown box where it sat on his bed and jumped into his swivel chair.
“Myc,” Lestrade could feel his strength returning slowly to him and grabbed Mycroft’s shoulders. Even now, he couldn’t let Mycroft retreat to solitude. “I have to know,”
Sherlock took the opportunity to slide his hand into John’s open palm and noted with great satisfaction the shorter man offered no protest to this. “To the crime scene then.”
“I would never consider making you do something like that. I’m not even sure if you would be a proper test subject for it anyway. Some people are more susceptible to hypnotism then others.”
Greg jumped and hit his head on the glass table. He didn’t break it but the pain was instantaneous. “Damn it Sally, what do you want?”
He was peering at his hands, being pulled from his memory for a moment. He wasn’t sure where that thing on Mycroft had appeared from, let alone that voice that evidently only he could hear. He could almost hear its strange reverberations still as he sank onto the couch. The door of the flat opened and shut with a heavy thud, but he didn’t turn to look. Obviously it was John with his file.
Molly shook her head, she was a more science minded person, seeing dead bodies all day had jaded her after a while, even if she wasn’t as cold as Sherlock. “Did you… see him again?”
“He never came back after that, sent for his possessions. I can’t figure out why he would just run out like that.”
“Sorry, I shouldn’t bother you. I’m starting to sound like my damn therapist now- always harping me that I need to get out more.” John tried relieving the conversation of it’s unwarranted tension.
“What do I want? I want the world Sherlock, and I want it handed to me on a silver platter. But for now, I think I will settle with having your heart, preferably burned out of you.” He grinned. “Sebbie, knock him out will you?”
“You’re shirtless in a the bath under me with your gills fluttering. What more could you possibly be hiding?” John deadpanned.
“Oh, er, I didn’t know that you knew… well, actually they both are.” Molly put her purse down on the counter and began to open it.
“Well, I did text you as an experiment to see if your morals for your therapists rules were greater then your loyalty to me.” He smiled as he realized he had won the wager.
“Joooohn.” Sherlock moaned, his features pinking a bit. He clenched his teeth hard and pulled the tentacle away. This was too much. There was a part that wanted to stay, even just to be tucked away safely and trust John that it would be ok. But he knew he couldn’t trust himself. Not until he knew more about what was happening to him at least. He tried hard to pull away but couldn’t. John’s scent was intoxicating.
The door opening caught Moriarty off guard, he notice the shaking lamp next to him until it hit his arm. The gun fell and slid across the sleek wooden floor. Sherlock reached out to grab him by the shirt collar but the shaking ground gave him just enough time to slide by Mycroft and towards the door.
John cocked his head but the younger man made no elaborations. A grin found it’s way to his face, “Shall I hack onto your screen and find out for myself then?”
“Well what happened, what did he say??” Lestrade was now at the edge of his seat, although John had no idea why.
He grabbed the support bar just above the bed, pulling himself off and into the chair he so often felt trapped in. Why hadn’t he just told John from the beginning? He thought dismally, wheeling himself to the closet and slowly getting dressed.
"Nothing like kissing." Sherlock was fully spent as he wrapped his arms around John and drifted off from the afterglow.
Sherlock hailed a cab, “I’ve told you all I can about the bodies, it seems we really should be getting back now. Call if you need anything.” He stepped into the cab gesturing for John to do the same.
Greg was startled and immediately searched for the cause of the noise. He carefully picked the picture frame up. It was a photo from one of their cases together.
John groaned but climbed into Sherlock's palm anyway, terrified that the detective would drop him. Sherlock was surprisingly gentle with John though, partially cupping his other hand over John's head for added protection. He placed John on the now empty kitchen table, then turned to the stove to make single fried egg.
"I'll be back in a moment." Sherlock had left the room and from a loud bang further away it sounded as if he had left the apartment too.
It looked as though neither of the two brothers had even moved. Sherlock was in his chair, his hands in his typical thinking position as looked at Mycroft with great intensity. Mycroft had a glimmer in his eyes, a nearly unperceivable twist at the corner of his mouth that gave away his amusement. What on earth had happened in the few moments that he was away, John wondered.
Greg dropped the duffle bag, his pack of cigarettes falling to the ground and spilling everywhere as well. “Bloody hell… I swear to god Sherlock- if you- if you’re still fucking here-”
John wasn’t about to put all of Sherlock’s efforts to deduce people to complete waste though. Ok, so they talked? What else? Lestrade usually had nicer food then just a box of donuts; at least he typically did lately, not two years ago when he was still with his wife. Which seemed almost backwards, usually people only ate cheap junk when they weren’t making or buying it for someone else. “Wait… do you two…” No, that couldn’t be right. Besides, if it were, surely Sherlock would have noticed it by now. Of course he was also terribly horrible with sentiment and couldn’t deduce a damn thing if he was somehow involved in his own deduction for some reason. But Mycroft? That was just absurd. Yet, Lestrade looked like he was hanging on whatever John was about to say next.
“You once even admitted your broke up with one of your girlfriends simply because he told you to. Not even asked, told you.”
“You git.” John smiled fondly, “Of course I do. And hopefully you wont have to get use to being small.”
“Hey, I was thinking we could watch a movie or something on your laptop- John?” Greg’s brow furrowed.
"Possibly one last week, similar death, she was found in an ally. We thought it was an isolated incident before this."
Sherlock’s eyes flickered up to John’s at that before looking away again. “I’m not sure if this really falls under something you could help with.”
John continues to call her until his arm is tired from reaching so high on the massive phone. He wants to push it over on it’s side in defeat but he doesn’t want to see where his sister’s name is still engraved on the back from when it was hers.
John shook his head, “I don’t think he’s going to go for that.” The EMF detector went quiet. “Don’t be like that, it will be more effective then knocking on things or hurting the furniture.” It felt so strange to refer to Sherlock as though he was right there with them. He had died and there was no proof he could still be around. Not yet anyway. But it felt rude to pretend he wasnt there if he actually somehow was.
John’s brow scrunched up, “Why would, I mean, I suppose it doesn’t really matter, but that one was just so close to,” where he died. But he couldn’t say those words. Not yet.
John wrapped his digits around the slender, milky white cylinder. It was very simplistic in appearance, but the moment he touched it he could tell the interior was not merely plastic, it had a strange combination of feeling organic as well as mechanical. “It’s a vibrator? But there’s no controls?”
John shifted awkwardly in his seat. “I’m not ruling anything out just yet.” He was having a hard time meeting Lestrade’s eyes now, luckily his monitor was there to provide an excellent distraction. “Maybe whoever is doing this just wants us to think its paranormal. Someone who has a grudge against Daniels? He’s loosing rent with all these people being scared off after all.”
Sherlock bent down closer to the body. There was something sticking out of the man’s left shoulder. “A fish hook?”
John wouldn’t give up so easily, he rounded the controls, “Aye Captain Holmes.” The boat went full speed ahead.
John found himself stealing glances whenever he could at the still undeniable mystic that was Sherlock from across the small booth. Sherlock ate exceptionally slow, practically picking at his food with a difficult expression to read.
John grabbed his jagged broken post from the ground. The tarantula had already begun to turn around and strike again when he thrust the post through its abdomen making a gut wrenching cracking noise as it penetrated the hairy shell to reach the soft organs inside. He had expected it to die instantly, but didn’t. The legs slashed wildly at him grabbing him a few times and accidentally letting go in pain and confusion. A moment later the legs stopped moving so wildly and fell to a light twitching.
John frantically pushes the large call button over and over and the phone propped against the doll house wall. It’s no use. Harry doesn’t pick up and that same irritating voice mail message begins repeat before he hangs up.
“Ha, as if.” Somehow he could no longer bring himself to be mad at the situation though. “Case today?”
John realized that it might sound bad to admit that he was planning on working a case. “Visit an old friend.” He quickly came up with a lie.
At least Greg knew he probably wouldn’t be getting any alien STDs, or whatever the hell he was. The tentacles continued to pry their way in deeper, impossibly deep it seemed, as well as stretching him as far as he was willing to go. “Myc…” He finally whimpered, his neglected cock pressing against him in desperation. He gasped in pleasure; Mycroft’s hands ran up his thighs, spreading them a bit wider. It felt so nice to actually recognize something touching him as human.
This sex toy is based on a real usb vibrator that vibrates to sound wake, such as music on an ipod or computer. The rest is made up. Unless some god of an inventor makes it real.
“Hm?” John looked up from his tea, not sure what Sherlock was talking about. If he were afraid of some storm, surely he would want him to stay in with him as well.
“Don’t think I’ll be needing one.” He continued to push the old man further back into the house and eventually out of earshot.
“Interesting… I think we should stop by there tomorrow. It could be any number of things, maybe someone with a grudge against Daniel is scaring people away so he’ll lose money, or it’s a prank done by neighbors. I think we should put up a few cameras inside the flat, possibly stage it so seem like the new tenant and see what happens.”
“You would come all this way to leave?” Mycroft’s feigned hurt, his mouth going into an obviously fake pout. “But no, you’ll be staying.”
Molly had gone back to the lab, promising to stop by again later after work. It was late by the time she came back and John looked positively drained from researching for so long.
“You incessantly complain when I don’t give you enough time during cases to eat, so eat.” He waited patiently with his spoon until John reluctantly opened his mouth. Sherlock happily thrust the spoon in.
John sat on a stack of glass slides eating a muffin crumb, "It's alright I suppose, so long as no one else finds out." John was quiet for a moment unaware that Sherlock's face was level with the table he was on simply staring at him. "That girl today… the blond one. She looked too much like my sister."
“S-sorry, are you ok-“ John slowly realized what went wrong with his action. “Oh… oh god, I am so- so sorry!” he backed away a bit, not wanting to do more damage.
As John tried to stand he fell back with a throbbing pain from his right ankle. The ambient light was just enough for the doctor to inspect it.
Molly sat near by, head lowered as she pretended to look through a microscope at some of the blood found at the crime scene. She couldn’t take her eyes away from the tiny pair that seemed to be clinging so closely to each other. She brought a hand up to adjust the lens and simultaneously hide her smile, the moment seemed solemn but she couldn’t help it. Those two really did appear to be made for each other. She was still slightly heart broken finally realizing that nothing would ever happen between her and Sherlock, but she knew now it was for the best. She would never want to come between him and John anyway. John not only loved Sherlock, but he knew how to handle him, and more importantly, Sherlock loved him back.
Her lips tightened into a thin line. “Unless his phone was there the whole time. But then… well he couldn’t have texted me if he wasn’t close enough to the phone himself. She peered at the skull hesitantly as though the answer was looking her right in the face. Her hand instinctually went towards it.
John turned to see over a mountain of blanket-looking fabric, and there stood Sherlock, too large to even fathom.
The taxi ride home was silent, not an awkward silent like they both originally feared it would be, but a peaceful understanding quiet.
"Acrylic! I've got it!" Sherlock bolted out of his chair and disappeared into his room to get dressed.
Sherlock lay beside him, concentrating hard on not being cold. John suddenly relaxed into the bed. Curious, Sherlock lightly touched John’s chest. He was much warmer now. Sherlock smiled, it was a simple matter of which form he was converting energy from.
“I’m really sorry! I wasn’t thinking! I just thought you would be a cat or something, I’m sorry! I just really needed a break from the experiments! And… oh my god Lock, please forgive me.” It was then that John saw the long black tail coming out from under Sherlock coat and gasped.
He unlocks the door and swings it open, “John! John!” he calls loudly but there’s no answer. He sees the cracked screen of his cell phone laying on the coffee table. There’s no doubt, John was here, had come in last night as he was asleep in the apartment below. He could curse himself for not waiting here longer.
The slits opened and closed on their own in a rythmatic pattern. John looked at the wall clock. Sherlock still hadn’t come up for air, but he could see his eyes were watching him through the water.
“Uh…” he never was good at lying. “I didn’t realize that… I’m sorry, you did say you were just reading articles…”
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he saw Johns eyes momentarily glaze over or not, “Alright alright, I’m just going to drop it if you really do think it was for the best.” He checked his basket, “We’re just about done here anyway. You uh… haven’t made me done much yet. Unless you’re just making me forget afterwards.” He really hoped that wasn’t the reason.
It was a short walk to the lab and took the whole time before Molly recognized the thick now damaged fabric she was holding. “But… this is Sherlock’s?”
John knew once outside he would be caught for sure, until that painfully familiar car pulled up. If the car was there then it was pointless hiding it from Mycroft, might as well only have one of them know rather then the whole police force.
Sherlock took stepped close to him and tilted his head, “Ah, you’re upset because of your sister Harry.”
“Just a social call today. Came to see how you are.” He had a tight forced smile, debating internally if it was a good idea to come or not.
I didn’t realize you could be so close, I guess at times you just seemed like the man that lived inside my computer. –
“Hm?” The detective stopped passing for just a moment and continued again, “Very mild transformation, hardly a big deal really.”
John waited patiently for his date to arrive, she was a few minutes late and his eyes began to wonder across the restaurant.
“Good thinking,” He smiled at Greg. “I noticed a few plates in the cupboards we can use.” There was no reason why they couldn’t stake the place out as well as enjoy it after all.
“This is more then just sleeping arrangements right?” John’s face was too hard for Sherlock to read.
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked in Sally’s direction. When she saw them both again she felt as though she could easily faint again too, but she managed to keep her cool. There was a pregnant pause as she just looked at them, “How?”
John grabbed the legs firmly, but not forcefully, bending down into them and straightening them out. He kissed just above the pants line as he pulled the trousers off, smiling quickly at Sherlock's moan. He could see Sherlock's wanton form inches away from his lips. John pressed against him, eliciting a low moan of pleasure he delighted in.
Sherlock huffed loudly and stepped towards her. “I would appreciate it if you would leave my skull alone.”
“I’m not gay! I’ve even flirted with women who asked me if I’m your boyfriend. How do you think that makes me feel? Not to mention the looks I’ve been getting from men the past few months.”
John knew Sherlock had never been one to mind if the rent or bills were paid for or not and was always willing to lend him money, he even let John use his credit card for groceries. No, this wasn’t about the rent at all. Sherlock was simply punishing John for going back on his promise.
Mycroft had been watching his various cameras throughout London with great interest over the past two and a half days. When he last saw John on screen it seemed like the unlikely pair had just come home from a long night of case solving, both seemed in good health and decent spirits. But the following morning John had not left the flat for work.
“N-no, nothing like that. I think he might be here. I know that sounds crazy, but I feel like he’s still here in the flat sometimes, or watching me at work. Then today,” John sighed, “I think he wanted me to take this case.”
Lestrade couldn’t believe it. John had texted back right away, coherently, and interested. Was he actually fine after all?
"Also you wanted to talk to me about the death of one of your friends, but I'll relent in showing you John."
Greg stepped in the doorway with a chuckle, “You two wont like this.” He dropped his hand in his pocket and waited till he felt both men sitting in his palm and brought them out.
Sherlock sat up at that, laughing harder then ever. “A mermaid? Are you serious?” He laughed some more.
“Right, so, he was hiring you guys for a case or something?” He didn’t want to force John to say Sherlock had died. He didn’t need to hear it again himself.
A spoon provided a nice ramp up the first plate but from there jumping and climbing would be involved. A plated tilted drastically above him held in place by a cup and a roll of paper towels. Observing the incredibly strange angels of looking at the massive dishes he didn't notice a discarded toothpick in his path. John's footing slipped as he stepped on the pick, falling back into the cup. The cup quickly fell over allowing the plate to fall off the counter and smash, surprisingly neither Sherlock nor Maria heard the commotion, but more bothersome, the roll of paper towels quickly rolled away from it's position on the counter and onto the stove near the flames under the kettle.
She could easily have gone up and seen for herself, but she could tell these weren’t the sort of noises John typically made. She called Lestrade.
“Just that you haven’t even been dating for that long. He’s certainly dated plenty of women longer and doesn’t refer to them as girlfriends. I haven’t heard him call you that either.” He knew this would get him in trouble with John later, but he also knew that he would eventually be forgiven for it too.
“Thank you! You’re such a charmer! It’s funny, I always use to assume you and your detective friend were an item.”
“Sorry about that.” He knew he couldn’t look at the message, but the thought of who it might be from and what it could say was burning him from inside.
“You complain nearly every time we come look at bodies and now you’re the one wandering in on your free time. Really John, is this what grief has done to you?” Sherlock examined the bruised knuckles of a corpse. “This one fought back in his final moments… I’ll bet it was his lover, if only I could interview some people…”
Lestrade truly did not get enough credit for staying quiet in the taxi cab back to 221B while having to listen to the soft protests of “Not in his pocket, wait till we’re home,” and the worst, “Let him hear.”
Harry’s flat looked about the same as John and Sherlock checked it out the day before. There would clearly be no evidence here and Harry’s disappearance had likely occurred elsewhere.
“I suppose that’s the best I can expect from you. But if you wait too long, you may be on your own.” Mycroft warned before leaving.
“Hmm? Oh, well, classes have been difficult, again, not really use to being back in school after all.” John finally turned to look at her, his gaze still a bit distant.
His clothes were pristine as if he was unaffected by the sand and blood that was all around him, black curls perfectly in place.
Harry reached her hand towards Sherlock's, he flattened his palms out so John could walk across onto Harry's. The doctor took her thumb and gave it a light kiss. "We'll get him, love. I promise."
“What’s that?” Sherlock idly played with his fork, he didn’t actually want to eat, but it meant John was paying attention to him.
“I still have those dreams.” He didn’t notice his left hand had started shaking as he talked, Sherlock had. “I can’t…” he sighed quietly, there was no point in explaining he no longer could connect to people. He had tried so hard when he was first released from the military. Faked his way through dates, relationships, even small talk. He didn’t care about the people around him. He had wanted desperately to care, so much so that people really did believe his act. But in the end, he just didn’t care about other people.
Molly accidentally let out a gasp when she read what it said. "Sorry… I uh, I didn't mean to look." Her face was completely flush as she turned to the microscope fumbling with a slide she was putting in.
“Well the common person is so gullible to begin with I think it’s highly likely they just absent mindedly pretend to be hypnotized when in fact they’re not.”
The old man laughed, “It’s not everyday you come across something like this, it’s worth a fortune at least!”
“What are you talking about? It’s coming, it’s going to kill us, don’t you dare leave me now!” John yelled out thunderously sending Sherlock back a bit.
A few moments later John found he couldn’t step out of the high walls of the teacup without slipping, especially with a sprained ankle.
John’s worry subsided a bit at that, so it was just some sickness he was prone to or something along those lines. “Its still better to have someone help take care of you then to be on your own, isn’t it?”
“But you haven’t yet and you have no idea how much I appreciate you for that. You remain to be my one and only friend.”
John had already figured out this was the sign that Sherlock was moving and wanted to take John with him. "Where are we going?"
“Damn right I do.” Greg claimed those lips he always fantasized about. Maybe he had a bit of a kink too. But when it wasn’t absolutely terrifying, there was something exceptionally erotic about Mycroft’s new quirk.
“Trying to stimulate the muscle. Should speed things up. I had hoped to move onto a new experiment today. I don’t like delays.”
“Well clearly I made some errors when I was reworking the formula. You weren’t even supposed to turn into a cat.”
There was a loud sigh coming from the empty space beside John, “Like I said back at the flat, I’m pretty sure I’ve dyed the skin to some extent, it doesn’t come off- not that easily at least, but the rain wont exactly be going through me and I rather not be on display as the invisible man while freezing to death and soaked.”
This was certainly not some fire filled pit, nor a cloudy realm of everything he ever wanted. There were no deceased relatives to greet him or a bright light summoning him forth. He was just there, right on the brink of existence. Evidentially invisible, incorporeal, and unheard.
Sherlock’s eyes slid away again and already John felt like the detective was retreating into isolation.
“You wouldn’t have let me think you weren’t ok for longer then you had to.” John couldn’t seem to look away from the chair, it held a strange captivating power over him. He tried shaking the feeling off. He had obviously imagined Sherlock in the morgue, his subconscious desperately wanting his friend to be ok.
Lestrade was the first to visit her that morning to get a diagnosis. Molly was nearly giddy as she saw the D.I. look up after hearing the clicking sound.
“Take my phone, call Mycroft and have him find any and all cameras in this area. I’m going in, we need to know what we’re dealing with before calling The Yard.”
Sherlock made large strides back and forth across the cold metal table where the deceased body of the woman from the lake house lay.
“Just leave me alone for a bit? This is really embarrassing.” Sherlock half mumbled as he stood, now the same height as John.
John had hit his head on the tile countertop but was already up on his feet with great alarm as the paper towels began to go up in flames. His first thought was to put the fire out as fast as possible, but he soon realizes the flames were far above his head and he could do nothing. He backed away from the spreading fire, he was running out of counter space and the fall down looked pretty high compared to his size.
“Mhm. If I had gone willingly I would have, glad I didn’t, would have gone the way of my coat.” Sherlock frowned but still didn’t open his eyes as he laid on his back next to his fetal position flatmate ‘
Sherlock looked up to scold him further, but couldn’t when he saw the John was looking at him, like he was the only other person alive. “John… It’s really not.”
The word repeated in his mind. He liked jam. This wouldn’t be so bad, he was just going to do a few simple things and then Sherlock would reward him for being good.
Lestrade excused himself from the police officer taking up his time, there wasn’t exactly an abundance of clues at the scene, though it was strange that it appeared to be the first murder that took place inside a house, did it mea this one was directly targeted unlike the previews victims believed to chosen at random for their appearance and orientation? Then again Lestrade wasn’t too sure how easy it was to find a young attractive blond that was also a lesbian- not that type of person he had tried looking for before.
“The man sounds absolutely infuriating. You have even said he is yourself. Why do go so far out of your way to bend for what he wants?”
“Well, it seems most the tenants get scared out, usually around 3am.” John grabbed his laptop from one of the bags and immediately set it up. Perhaps that would calm his nerves. “Its when most people report- er,” He glanced at Greg who only looked at him expectantly. “Paranormal sightings.”
“As if, and I’m not interested in him.” John flipped the fish onto a fresh plate for his flatmate. “There you go.”
John calmed down a bit at that, not that it mattered to him who Greg liked. Or who Sherlock dated. Obviously. “Not to sound like Sherlock, but if he doesn’t feel the same, or like anyone for that matter, why don’t you just move on? I mean, lots of other people out there after all.” He really hoped that wasn’t insensitive. But Mycroft wasn’t really the type anyone should be pinning after.
John grabbed him by the overly slim waist. “I’m sorry, I really am. Of course I love you. I love you with every bone in my body.”
Sherlock shifted closer, feeling like an idiot for playing with something that was clearly labeled as a ‘child’s toy.’ He was afraid of hurting John, but carefully placed his hands over his.
“I don’t even have enemies! You do! Who the hell would be targeting me when they would have to deal with you?”
John was suspicious someone had followed him on all three occasions. That someone being Lestrade. For a moment he thought back to the day Mycroft had kidnapped him and interrogated him about Sherlock, offering him money to spy on him. But surely Lestrade wouldn’t be spying for Mycroft… would he? John couldn’t for life of himself fathom why either of them cared what he did.
Sherlock was enjoying John's condition far too much. He would never be accused of focusing too much on his flatmate since he could argue the small man needed constant watching now and even better, the detective had John all to himself, no need to compete for his attention with pesky dull girlfriends or the hospital John worked at. Of course that also meant there was no one to buy his groceries. He would cross that bridge when he got there.
Mycroft froze at the sound, his eyes darting everywhere but at Greg. “I didn’t realize- sorry.” The other tentacles on the bed retreated, but not that one.
A tiny Sherlock climbed out of the hideously colored orange purse and gave John a hand to follow. “We are not missing, but I do appreciate your concern and the return of my coat.” He eyed his prized possession, “Wha- what the hell did you do to my coat! It’s filthy!”
John jumped out of bed and ran after him, finding him staring into the large mirror with an unreadable expression. “I don’t even know how…”
Dr. John Watson needed to die, but Mycroft wouldn’t let him. He needed a different sort of alternative.
It was the same message he put up nearly every night, just looking for a group mission to kill time before he had to go to sleep and start his school day all over again.
“I don’t understand, all of our stuff his still here. He never even got rid of my things. The apartment has obviously still been paid for but judging by the dust level no one has been here in at least two months. Where is John?”
“You’re door… it was unlocked…” Clearly he was mistaken. Why would Mycroft try to trick him into coming in?
Despite his slow movement it still surprised John, he had assumed not being able to move he wouldn’t be able to feel either. “Yes.”
"And the week before that every piece of clothing I owned reeked after one of your experiments blew up."
Lestrade had finished grabbing the few items and sticking them in a duffel bag. Hopefully it would just be a nice calm night with John. He turned to look at the flat.
John had a fantastic nap. There were no drugs, no hypnotism, and nothing homosexual happened. Although if Tennant had made an appearance John likely wouldn’t have minded. It was all fine.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Its just fabric, it will dry. And your boots wont save you from drowning.” He smirked and stepped out onto the muddy shore.
Sherlock jumped back dramatically with a yelp, John tried to sturdy him “What is it? What’s wrong?” Sherlock’s eyes went wide and John followed were they pointed. “Oh lord… biggest cockroaches I have seen in my life… lets get out of this ally shall we?”
Seeing his friend look suddenly sick to the stomach guilt started wrapping it’s way around Joh, “Hey, it’s fine, sorry, you look like you’re going to faint… you’re the one that said it’s just-“
“Oh good, that was fast.” Lestrade stood from his desk to show the pair down to the morgue. “Good to see you John.”
"N-nothing. Nothing at all." The last of his sentence was barely audible through his deep throated laugh. "You're taller than him!" John would never hear the end of this.
John ducked his head inside the interior pocket, it was a very strange sensation to feel the fabric go slack around him, material dropping to the seat of the chair and an ominous buzzing from above.  He dared a look outside the pocket and saw a movement in the fabric near him. He instantly ducked down again.
“John I assure you, I will make sure you are perfectly safe and back to normal as soon as I know it works.”
“Tobby?! John, it’s going to eat me!” Sherlock struggled to get out if the furry weights realizing the cat must have been de-clawed. His hair was splayed in every direction. “I’m going to die…. JOHN! Why are you laughing at me?!”
Lestrdae tried pulling his neck and head back, away from his attacker, and surprisingly Mycroft allowed this until almost all of the tentacle was out. But just as Greg thought he would finally be free of it, Mycroft quickly thrust it forward again and back into the welcoming wetness. The tentacle squirmed inside of him, now starting to gently thrust in and out of Greg’s mouth as he tried getting away. But it seemed that this could be an easily exploitable weakness. The thick tentacles on Greg’s waist and wrists were going lax as he focused on the on in his mouth. Maybe he could still escape after all.
A flash of fear came across Sherlock’s face as the door began to open behind him, “Sorry John, goodnight.” The screen suddenly went black before returning to John’s normal desktop, meaning Sherlock’s compute had been turned off.
Mycroft glanced down at his watch 11:55pm. He knew he was too worried about Sherlock to sleep tonight. “Alright,”
A few minutes later Sherlock returned with a bowl of chicken soup and a smile. He pulled his chair close to John’s and leaned in uncomfortably close too him with a spoon of the soup in hand.
“Heh, well, short blond hair, hideous shoulder from the bullet wound, just average other then that I suppose.”
Sherlock frowned at that, he had never met Harry, but based on things John had previously told him about 'sentiment' he deduced this resemblance between John's sister and the dead woman at the club somehow made John sad.
Gregory let out a whimper and strangely felt as though more lubricant was suddenly soaking him. He paled at the realization. It wasn’t coming from those agile tentacle tips like the secretion Mycroft had forced him to drink. It was coming from himself.
But Lestrade had anticipated it and leap out of the way, almost not making it. He stumbled through the dark room in an attempt to find his way back to the front door.
“It’s an inanimate object, I neither like nor dislike it.” Sherlock was cut off before he was able to say anymore by John’s lips crashing against his own.
“Do you know what that word means?” his eyes were piercing. “A fag is a bundle of sticks you set on fire. That man there is the greatest detective- the greatest person I have ever known. You don’t have the right to even be in his presence.” John practically spat. If it wasn’t for the crime scene tape divided them he likely would have punched one of the many taunting faces.
John cautiously peeked around the doorframe and found a messy head of curls sitting on a couch facing away from him. He couldn’t help but grin as he walked closer.
Sherlock chuckled. “Precisely. Just a foot. If you found that shocking you really have no idea what else one can do with chemicals.” He eyed his beakers fondly. “I did tell you we were starting off simple, we could move up a few notches with the experiments after all. It makes no difference to me what order we do them in.”
Sherlock admired his work for a moment, “The sofa had it coming. Besides, I really couldn’t help it.” it was true, by taking drinking the chemical compound again before the last effects wore off he overloaded his system for a few hours and become overly hyperactive before crashing. ‘
John’s whole body was sore when he woke in his glass confine. He thought back to the previous morning and how wonderful it felt to wake up on Sherlock’s plush scarf, truthfully it had been more comfortable then his own bed.
"Hm? What? Oh! No! I didn't mean-" his eyes grew wide with the realization of what he was being accused of.
"You're pretty late you know, you're never late when I have a case for you." Lestrade had a slightly confused face.
John clutched at his pillow without opening his eyes. “I said half an hour.” Knowing that was the approximate time it should take for Sherlock to be cat and leave him alone.
A bead of sweat fell down John’s face as his mind drifted back towards the reason why he had a therapist in the first place, his hand shaking all the more, “You can’t just snap your fingers and tell me to leave again like that. This is important Sherlock.” A strange thought popped in his head.
John cupped the sides of Sherlock’s face, gently making his friend look at him. “We’ll just stay here then. I can look after you, it will be fine.”
“John,” Sherlock finally gave in, curiosity getting the better of him, “Would you make us some tea?”
John woke early, feeling well rested for the first time in a while. Unfortunately he didn’t have much time to appreciate it before he had to go back to the hospital. He had to come off his leave of work at some point after all.
There wasn’t much that Lestrade could do. It looked like the case was already cold. There were no leads and zero evidence to go on. There wasn’t even evidence that a crime was committed, let alone proof. The DI sighed, he knew Sherlock would have had a field day with this one and would have thought of some terribly clever way to solve it. But Sherlock was gone now and wasn’t coming back.
Greg took a bite of his eggs if only to give a moment to think. He didn't want this, he really didn't need this woman back in his life. "Listen, I-" a small lie never hurt anyone. "There's somebody else."
“Some of these are post mortem, but most were before he died. Tortured?” Sherlock glanced at Lestrade, who seemed to be a bit of a nervous wreck.
“Damn it Sherlock! I’m trying to punch you in the face right now but I’m not moving! Why?!” John remained perfectly still.
He made quick work of packing for the night, grabbing just the essentials and a few open cases he thought he might a review for the hundredth time while there.
Funny thing about tarantulas. When they fall and hit something hard, they explode. Not a pretty sight.
John desperately wanted to pull him back up, but he told himself to least see whatever the hell it was that Sherlock was talking about.
John blinked at the odd server name, “Mind Palace? That’s an odd one…” he clicked the small icon to join and sent a request of his own.
Anyone else would have been taken aback by the tone of Sherlock’s voice, “Now now quiet down. I’m just trying to say that boy needs some time.”
“No! No! Not at all. I’ve just not seen anyone the past two weeks is all.” The sofa shook and Lestrade could tell John had lost his footing for a moment. “Oh, Greg, so… Sherlock and I are, we’re dating.”
Sherlock sighed, looking up at his phone as he laid in bed. Maybe today was a bad idea… What if John didn’t like him after they met? He had a tendency to rub off on people the wrong way after all. He groaned as he sat up, desperately wanting to text John that he changed his mind, that today was off. But he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He wanted to meet John so bad, see him in person, all the little details that his computer wouldn’t show him. The calluses on his hands, the way he stood and held himself, the exact pitch of his voice… He needed John so bad. Why had he never told him the truth? This was doomed to go bad. He hadn’t really lied, not exactly, just failed to mention it. But wasn’t that the same? And god… last night. John had told him he loved him. Sherlock had wanted to say those words back, he had wanted that for so long, but he couldn’t. Not yet. John had to know first, see what he was getting himself into before they could have any form of attachment.
“Oh, that.” John wished he could disappear into the floor. “Its not mine.” He had a vague memory of the time he was caught with a slingshot in grade school and claimed it wasn’t his.
“Which is why I need you to be a good pet and drink it now.” The mad man brought the vial close to Moran’s face. “I have other snipers, just because you’re my favorite doesn’t mean you’re actually better then anyone else.”
“My, aren’t you loyal fast. He lied to you about something rather important I would say, doesn’t that make you wonder what else he’s been lying about?” Mycroft quirked an eyebrow as he slowly descended the stairs, never breaking eye contact with him.
‘This is ridiculous, I am NOT attracted to men. That guy over there isn’t attractive to me at all. ’he almost didn’t see the waiter approach.
Sherlock didn’t see the first coming, only felt the throbbing in his face after the fact. “You could have said that any damn time!”
“Bloody hell… what did I just do?” John pulled out his cell phone, momentarily thinking of making an emergency appointment with his old therapist. But she would only prescribe medication, and he wasn’t convinced that was what he needed.
"Sure, I have the day off tomorrow anyway." John had taken every opportunity he could to follow Sherlock around as he sleuthed; his deduction skills had fascinated John to the core. "What is it you're doing by the way?" John looked at the kitchen table covered in various tubes and beakers containing odd colored liquids.
“I really need to test this one and you don’t have anything else to do today, I just thought it would be best to get it over with and have it out of the way, or should I need to make any more changes to it I would be able to do so in a timely fashion.”
“Oh come on- well, actually that kind of makes sense. Oh I don’t know! It’s the only thing I can think of! That or try to ask the spirit what it wants.”
“You’re eyes…” He whispered, though he could tell Mycroft could hear him from his now fallen expression.
“Ella?” John leaned through the door before entering, “I brought someone with me today, is that alright?”
