This conversation has taken a very uncomfortable turn. John licks his lips nervously. “Er... just wasn’t in the mood.”
Sherlock’s head snaps up. He presses his lips together, brow furrowing in mingled confusion and thought, and starts to say something but stops.
an interesting woman sitting to his left. The two started talking, and flirting, and he came very close to bringing her back with him, except then he remembered his weird roommate.
The doorbell rings one evening as John is getting ready for bed. Sherlock is closest to the door, but of course refuses to budge. When John, muttering about lazy roommates, answers, he’s so startled he accidentally shuts the door in the visitor’s face. It’s the man who had tried to bribe him.
John comes home at 2am with lighter fluid. He places it firmly next to Sherlock, who is glued to his microscope.
Mycroft gives a simpering smirk. “Could it be that my little brother is jealous of my accomplishments?”
“You need to get into bed. I’ll bring a bin, but kneeling on the bathroom floor isn’t going to help anything.”
The withering expression this elicits is almost palpable. “Brilliant deduction, John. Really stellar.”
Sherlock disappears. The neighborhoods of Boston aren't large enough that two people whose movements are approximately similar shouldn't run into one another at least once in four months, but there is a distinct lack of certain tall, dark-haired madmen come October. This bothers John more than it should.
“How d’you have service up here?” John inquires, which if you think about it really isn’t the salient point.
That spat is eventually resolved. John calms down a bit; Sherlock buys him new monogrammed sheets but pretends they’re a gift from John’s mum, Caroline. Except Caroline can’t afford those sorts of luxuries, so John sees right through his awkwardly thoughtful roommate, but plays along anyway.
It used to feel like electricity when Sherlock opened his mouth and made those trademark cutting remarks or rapid fire deductions. Now... it’s just silent.
This is the extent of their conversation for the next fifteen minutes. True to the young man’s prediction, the lift is fixed before sunset, and as John gets off and stretches, he decides he ought to at least say goodbye to his odd fellow rider. When he turns to speak to him, however, the guy has disappeared in a flash of an expensive looking Belstaff (really, who even
John has a lot of questions. He arranges them in order of priority. Placing his cup safely on the table beside him, he addresses his first concern. “I'm sorry, but I have to ask. How many legs did that dog have when you found him?”
“I’ve kept them in the bathroom,” Sherlock informs him mildly. “You needn’t carry on, I’ve put the Purell next to them on the sink, in case of infection. Though your hypochondriac tendencies are verging on the extreme.”
planned to reimburse you. But then the frog carcasses arrived, which was rather more important, particularly given the deliverer’s apparent inability to—”
Given that John has work during the days and sometimes weekends, he doesn’t get to run around with Sherlock much, which he’s mostly okay with. He gets a large enough dose of Sherlock’s unique brand of ‘crazy’ just living with the man, who’s a constant lightning rod of untamed energy.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow scornfully. “You are the only person I believe my brother comes close to loving,” he states as though it’s obvious. “I daresay that if anyone is to save him, it would be his precious John Watson.”
“FINE!” John bellows, and practically flies out of his chair to grab his keys and wallet. Out of sheer, infuriating habit, he stops two paces from the door and turns towards his roommate, who’s glaring murderously at the upholstery. “Need anything?” he asks before he can stop himself. Why he’s catering to and endorsing Sherlock’s laziness in the first place is anybody’s guess.
I don't know yet what I'll do for a posting schedule, but since the current chapters are all quite short, I'll probably post relatively frequently. The first set of chapters operate on a four-month schedule (i.e. John and Sherlock meet every four months) until the roommate thing happens, and that'll change up the pace a bit.
“Sherlock, lo—” John catches himself, positively horrified at the term of endearment that almost slipped out. He’s never been much of a term of endearment guy, but in previous relationships the occasional ‘love’ or ‘babe’ was wont to occur, usually when he was trying to reason with someone being unreasonable.
It isn’t as though he and Sherlock were friends. In fact, he’s fairly certain that the longer he spends in Sherlock’s presence, the higher his chances of ending up in prison for the rest of his life, or, alternately, getting killed. But after his meeting with the strange man who tried to bribe him, he finds himself wanting to see Sherlock again, if only to warn him about this supposed arch enemy.
“No.” Sherlock is evidently unable to string together a list of acerbic observations, which in and of itself is a red flag.
“Oh, don’t bother with John, he’s terribly dull,” Sherlock says offhandedly. To the man still pointing a gun at him. Casually. Like this happens on the daily. “I suppose you bypassed Mycroft for
On the couch, Sherlock sends a text. Everyone’s cellphones at the televised press conference go off.
John recounts their multiple meetings. When he finishes, Mike is beaming. “What?” John asks somewhat defensively.
“Polite conversation?” John manages. Sebastian is advancing on him. Why is Sherlock not flinching? Not that Sherlock has an obligation to care about John’s well being, but how on
Mycroft assumes the same mournful expression as he had during their first interaction. “He’s always been so resentful. You can imagine the Christmas dinners.”
“I'm not surprised,” John says levelly. Tea streams into his cup; he tosses the pod in the trash and makes for the stairs. “If you don't mind.” Janine dutifully steps to the side.
“The woman you cavorted with at the bar. She was obviously interested, you reek of her perfume, but you turned her down. Why?”
“It was for science,” Sherlock explains, apparently switching back to the topic of John’s burnt sheets, “and I assure you, it was entirely necessary.”
to meet the parents, or any additional siblings. For the world’s sake, he hopes there are none. “I mean, it actually is a childish feud?” he asks the two large children having a standoff in front of him.
“I wouldn’t have minded,” Sherlock says. “If you’d...” He gestures vaguely. “With her.” For some reason the indifference in his tone stings.
Then Sherlock disappears for a few days and reappears with a girl. Janine. John has the pleasure of meeting her when he arrives home after a work trip to an attractive woman with wet hair who is wearing Sherlock’s shirt and obviously nothing else.
the American government,” Sherlock says. “Took it over when they told him to stop meddling in their affairs. When he’s not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis. He ran the FBI for a few months, but found it tedious. Now he’s in negotiations with Russia.”
Sherlock gets to his feet and kicks Sebastian over onto his back. “I believe I gathered all pertinent information,” he says, sounding disappointed. “Open and shut, hardly worth my time... I’ll be having a chat to Mycroft.”
Hang on. John’s brain is still trying to catch up with what’s happening right now. “So when you say you’re concerned about him, you actually are concerned,” he states to Mycroft.
Thank you to people leaving comments, it's lovely. I usually don't share my writing, so it's very nice to see others enjoying it.
If Sherlock thinks he’s some sort of womanizer, then John should be incredibly flattered. But he also rather suspects at this point that Sherlock knows full well that John’s love life is an endless stretch of half-assed attempts and inevitably finding each and every woman boring. A thought occurs as he’s struggling to figure out how exactly to answer the question. “You don't have a girlfriend, then?”
attempting to compensate for your last disastrous affair—who was he, a football star? You could have done better, he was still in the closet, but of course you remained foolishly oblivious. Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.”
“What?” John splutters. “No, never. Never. He—we aren’t dating. I’m single, very single,” he emphasizes.
It’s a left-hand exit, which means John now has to change over four lanes of speeding traffic in a very short distance. “Are you kidding?”
I hope you enjoyed! Let me know if you'd like me to continue updating, in which case I will set up an update schedule. I have about 5,000 words written at the moment, with each chapter short at around 500-1,000 words. However, the chapters will likely lengthen once the scene has been set.
“I had a husband like that once, always rushing about,” Mrs. Hudson says fondly. She turns to John. “But I can see you're more the sitting-down type. I'll get some tea.”
Sherlock appears too exhausted to argue, so he takes John’s hand and starts plodding down the hall beside him. When they get to the living room, however, Sherlock nearly falls over, and John hurriedly gets him onto the couch instead.
“Um... Sherlock...” John says through gritted teeth as the gunman wheels around and aims at him instead.
However, he walks into the apartment one day to find Sherlock and a man on the couch in the living room. Making out. Hardcore.
Sherlock tries to unfold himself and get to his feet. He does, but nearly falls backwards and has to clutch the arm of the couch to stop himself. “I’m fine!” he practically shouts.
“Hello,” she says cheerfully when John walks in. He can hear the bath splash down the hall and quickly realizes Sherlock is probably in there. “I’m Janine.”
“We don’t have a moment to waste,” his companion insists and, because he is certifiably insane, John complies.
“...I’m intrigued, actually, the last three attempts on my life were significantly better funded and prepared. I expected better of you—but then again blind optimism never did work in anyone’s favor.”
“My brother was meddling too much in America’s affairs. They threatened lifetime imprisonment, he came to the U.S. and took over the government instead. He is the single most pompous, pretentious, and overbearing man I have had the misfortune to meet.”
“So,” the man drawls. “Another case cracked. How very public-spirited. Though that’s never really your motivation, is it.”
“You’re dehydrated. If you try to run around, I’m sending you to the hospital.” John presses his palm to Sherlock’s forehead. “Are you still feverish?”
he could stand there in front of a man with a gun, impassively criticizing how poorly the murder attempt was executed, is beyond John’s comprehension.
John blinks, then shakes his head. “No, actually.” It's true that he's been less than keen on work lately, but that's neither here nor there. “Pretty sure you know why I’m... well. You do realize you set my sheets on fire.”
I have decided on weekly updates for this fic. I got caught up in work and other writing projects, so apologies for the slow down. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed! Comments and kudos always appreciated.
“Is he coming?” Janine asks with a sly smile. The double entendre isn't missed on John, who flares his nostrils and takes a sharp breath through his nose.
"The sun sets at 5:15. It’s only 4:30, and they have ample time to fix it. Shouldn’t be too difficult.”
loses it. “Sherlock, it’s—it’s the principle of the thing!” he says furiously. “You can’t go around leaving dead animals and god knows what else all over our apartment!”
“That was quite unnecessary,” Sherlock says primly to John, looking up at him across Sebastian’s prone body.
Later, holed up with paperwork and music blasting to drown out the sound of Sherlock and Janine loudly flirting downstairs, John can't help but wonder if Janine was telling the truth and if, in fact, Sherlock does talk a lot about him.
“Sherlock, what the fu—” John blusters when he comes home for lunch, but stops still because Sherlock is wearing a hazmat suit and crouching thoughtfully on the edge of the sofa.
“We go much further back than I care to recount,” Sherlock continues calmly, “but I daresay we’ve more than exhausted what little capacity for polite conversation we possess.”
atop a mountain, halfway upon which they are stuck in a ski lift, and also possibly freezing to death in the cold.
Sherlock still doesn’t disclose the details of Sebastian, or why he’s already had people attempting to take his life, or pretty much anything. What he
“Yeah,” John answers curtly, and slams his bag down on the table with much more force than necessary.
“Sherlock, shut it and go to bed!” John yells back, getting angrily to his feet because Sherlock is, once again, on his last nerve.
It’s 104, just on the verge of dangerous. “Paracetamol,” John orders, “and try to eat something. I can make you toast?”
“Are you mad?” John sputters, but when he turns to look at the intruder he freezes. It’s the same guy from the ski lift four months ago.
“Actually, I think I’m quite well now,” Sherlock announces. He hops up from the couch, pales, and promptly keels over. John manages to catch him before the madman adds a concussion to his list of
Sherlock sighs, “Don’t be dull, John, it’s terribly unappealing.” He spins round and heads for the kitchen, where he swiftly removes two cups from the cabinet. Then he checks the clock. “You disappoint me.”
“You've been curled up in the fetal position all day, your eyes are glassy, and you're shivering,” John says firmly. “At least take your temperature.”
Cautiously making his way towards the source of the sound, John finds himself in a small and very sketchy back alley, only dimly lit. And there, in the middle of it, is Sherlock Holmes and a man carrying a gun. When he steps onto a patch of gravel, both men turn to stare at him.
Things we have coming up: Janine, Irene, Mary (that's going to be a very dramatic and lengthy matter), a death and hurt/comfort, and general UST.
John is just settling down for a nice cuppa when the door swings open, seemingly of its own accord, and a three-legged Boston terrier bounds in. Sherlock comes up the stairs a second later. He tosses his coat onto the coat rack with a flourish, then kneels down next to the dog. “John, meet Redbeard.”
John falters. Sherlock is used to operating at maximum capacity—overdrive, really. He moves a mile a minute, his brain is constantly going, and the flu probably slows everything down to the pace of an average human being. As irritating as it is to the onlooker, John has to remind himself that Sherlock is not like the others. He’s a whirlwind of activity, exuding energy at all times. John’s treated severely ADHD children before, and they always make him think of Sherlock. So profoundly, incredibly
and instead digs his heels into the ground. “Has anyone told you that you’re exceptionally irritating to be around? Good lord, what must it be like in your funny little brain? No wonder you’ve barely maintained a romantic relationship since college, you and your incessant—”
do is take John out to a place called Angelo’s, where John is called his date (Sherlock doesn’t contest the claim), monologue for about an hour and a half, then abruptly get up and leave at half past one in the morning. He is bizarre, potentially lethal, possibly a serious criminal, and weirdly exciting to be around.
“He talks about you,” Janine pipes up from behind John. He freezes, hands resting on the countertop, but says nothing. “In bed.”
It’s such a ludicrous response coming from this ludicrous man that John can’t help it when he starts laughing. Sherlock looks at him in a daze before the mirth becomes contagious, and suddenly they’re both in the most absurd hysterics, in the middle of the night, in a small cramped apartment bathroom, while Sherlock is battling a severe case of the flu and probably should be in the hospital with an IV.
The man strides into the apartment without a word to John and goes right over to Sherlock. John tenses, instinctively preparing himself to defend Sherlock. Sherlock isn’t fazed.
“Oh, for god’s sake!” This man is going to be the end of him. John pauses in the middle of the room, taking several calming breaths, and runs a hand over his face. Then, “Sherlock. You need
The stranger’s expression does not change. “Always so aggressive. Didn’t it ever occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?”
I've written up a bit of sicklock, because of course I have to fit all of the Johnlock tropes in here. I've decided to structure the fic month-by-month now that they're moved in with each other. Thank you to those who have left comments.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Slight miscalculation with regards to a crime scene. Nothing my brother cannot easily amend, but in the interim it would be wisest that I maintain a low profile.”
If Sherlock was in a clearer state of mind, he’d immediately put two and two together and stop, if only to make rude and intrusive comments about John’s family situation. But he’s not
“What I found may be unrelated to the recent unfortunate business.  As you know, Uncle Rudy,” Mycroft began, “mother's older brother, told our parents that Eurus...had died.  It may have been to save their feelings, as he stated to me at the time, but another possibility exists.  It seems...it seems that Uncle Rudy, after his schooling, traveled around the world for most of a decade.  An account of his travels would make, shall we say, vivid reading?  Unexpectedly, he found love, married, settled down, but was forced home when grandfather died to deal with some of the more delicate funeral arrangements.”
“There was something.  Some key but minor point, which he did not want to address with me at this point. Some layer of the mystery.”  Sherlock, of course, did not take well to not knowing the entirety.
“No reason to be worried about your money, John.  You don't have much here,” he commented.  John rolled his eyes.  Mr. Tact.  But strangely enough, he wasn't at all worried about Sherlock taking his cash.   Sherlock pulled out the condom and dropped the wallet on the floor.  He inspected the packet carefully and placed it on the bedside table.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, aggrieved.  “And they change angles and want you to believe it is all continuity, one...experience, but it's not.  I don' think it's at all a realistic portrayal.”
Sherlock said,  “Right.  Back to bed.”  Really, it was surprising how fast Sherlock could move.  He flung the dressing gown at the chair and was in bed before John even got into the room.
John shook his head.  “Why?  She couldn't know Rudy had lied about her own child, so it wasn't revenge....”
“Quite.”  Mycroft took a deep breath.  “I have agents at work even now tracing these cousins and gathering data.  When the information is at hand, either you or I should go in person to explain and arrange for the transfer of the funds.  As you are overseeing the rebuilding of 221 Baker Street and,” Mycroft glanced at John, “have other responsibilities, I will go.   I will find it difficult to get away, but I also find myself in need of a...vacation.”
Sherlock wrinkled his brow.  “Expectations?” he said.  “We came here to have sex,” he explained to John.  He frowned.  “Didn't we?”
Well, this was hopeless.  John got up and took his sopping wet flannel and his sticky body to the bathroom, where he cleaned up quickly.  He went back, pulled on his trousers, and followed out to the kitchen.  Sherlock had found a dressing gown, which he was wearing with the belt untied, and was searching through the detritus on the table for...something.  The slides, perhaps.  John sighed, and went on his own search.  He found the kettle, tea of dubious age, and some cups.  He found a few other things he's rather not think about as well, such as a bat mummified in salt and a baggie of yellow mush with dead maggots in it, but he did not find any milk or sugar.  Still...the occasion called for tea and he made it.
It rather went downhill from there.  They got back at dawn, after chasing a cabbie all over London.  Bit of a disappointment in the end, when the poor chap dropped dead, but Sherlock explained that the man had been playing some sort of sick suicide game that would have resulted in his eventual demise anyway.
“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” the man said with a touch of sarcasm, but did not introduce himself in turn.  Instead he said, rapidly, “You're a doctor, just came from St. Bart's.   No, wait.  You and your friends first went to a pub close to work, but then came here, the nearest gay-friendly bar in the area.  They,” he waved at John's friends, “are watching you intently. You lost a bet and this is a forfeit.  Which is it, a kiss or a date?”
Sherlock watched John and added, “She sent money, told the friend that Rudy would not be back and instructed her to use the money to raise the children.”
This time, Taba didn't object.  She gestured, the ceremonial spear thumped the ground once, and no one protested, so they began to disband.  Good.
John stared back, refusing to be intimidated.  Up close the man was as handsome as he had been from a distance.  A wealth of wavy hair, skin like cream, and that mouth.  Even John,  firmly camped on the heterosexual side of the street for decades, had to admit those lips were perfect.
“The number is not great enough to cause us problems, even if every one of them returned.” This quiet voice of reason was from a wise old woman.  Why weren't they listening?
A few long seconds ticked by.  Waiting for exactly the right time, John realized, and then wondered if this man was a criminal of some sort.  Pickpocket, maybe, with an accomplice who would use the distraction to relieve people, possibly including his friends, of their wallets.  Or what if....
“You think it will affect how I think of..our parents?” Sherlock suggested.  “No,” he said, staring at his brother intently.  “Mother.  You think there's something wrong and it involves Mummy,” Sherlock deduced.  “What is it?” he demanded.
Right.  He could do that.  Get lost in that.  His hands went on automatically making sure that they were both naked as soon as possible.  Two fumbling steps to one side and they were naked and horizontal.  Oh, god, flat on his back with a big man pressing him down to the mattress.  He should have felt dominated, or at a disadvantage.  Shouldn't he be panicking? It was unsettling, but exciting at the same time.  He groaned up into Sherlock's mouth and wrapped his arms around, holding them together.   He loved being nude with women, loved feeling all the swells and curves and differences plastered to him head to toe.   Turned out the feeling was just as good with that much man pressed to him, skin to skin.  He drew up one leg, his foot sliding from Sherlock's ankle to knee, the sensation of wiry hair between his toes one he did had never felt before.
“Right.”  He was beginning to wonder about Molly, too.  Or at least Molly's idea about what was entertaining.  Or punishment?  Or...what had he ever done to Molly, anyway, that she would come up with this insanity?
“You told her you didn't think it was ethical to date anyone at the clinic.  Which would have worked better if you hadn't had that date with Sarah the week before.”  Sarah was the head of their clinic.
Sherlock was rather startled when John interrupted their kissing and insisted on a shower first, but when John persisted Sherlock proposed they do it together, John took one look at the size of the space and promptly nixed that.  Sherlock showered first and was waiting for him in the bed as John came from the shower, and said, as John sat on the edge, “I think we should try fucking.”
“He was working a case,” he decided.  He looked towards the lounge, where a packet of crisps could be purchased from the machine in the corner.  Lunch.  Sarah said something else and she left.  Cora said something too, but John was caught up in a thought.  He stood there, shaking his head but grinning like a loon.
It was staggeringly different.  Robbed of the confidence which experience had given him, it was like being a teenager again, the uncertainty combined with scrabbling need.  The wanting combined with fear.   An absolutely huge hand was  pulling at his shirt and then sliding up under the fabric, hot on his skin. His own hands were doing the same, seeking out skin to touch.  So much wonderful hot skin.
“You don't have to be to work in the morning,” Sherlock told him when he said he should be getting home.  “You're exhausted,” he added.  “Just stay here.”
“Very,”  John agreed, and then glanced towards the table he had come from.  Four sets of eyes were regarding him intently.  Molly gave him a thumbs up gesture and a shy smile.  Oh, god.   “I'm John,” he added, leaning forward just a little more.
No, it was something even more complicated.  “If either one of us says stop, we stop,” John said.  He had condoms in his wallet.  Well.  One.  Would it come to that?  He wasn't ready for that, he told himself, while his back-brain held a crystal clear image of naked-kneeling&arse that told him he might not be ready for it, but he was definitely getting turned on thinking about it.
John’s breath came quick and short as he scanned the barren room, hand blindly reaching for the rifle that was not there, sounds of gunfire and dying screams fading from his ears to be replaced by the fast but steady thump of his heart.  His attention was drawn to Kato’s muttered curses as he pulled one paw free and then the other.  Chuckling softly, John drew his unresisting dæmon into his lap while he wiped tears from his eyes.
The screen turned on and he turned to his laptop to keep from saying anything he would regret.  The page for his blog filled the monitor, blank as the day he had started it nearly two months ago.  He rested his hands on the keys but no words came to him, just like yesterday and the day before that.  Snapping the lid closed in anger, he huffed silently as it would appear that it would remain blank for yet another day.
Sherlock looked at her for a long minute and Molly felt her cheeks grow hot from the scrutiny.  There was a long moment as Molly waited for him to speak, to say anything.  After several long seconds where she thought her heart was going to bust out of her ribcage, he blinked, turning back to his notebook and jotted something down before he snapped it shut and returned his attention back to her.
The reunion was heartfelt and full of tears and surprises.  John greeted them with wide haunted eyes as Bobby grabbed him up into a hug that Harriett tried to weasel in between before he enveloped both of them.  But when Marah went to greet Kato, the young dæmon shifted into a large brown Doberman, baring his teeth as a low rumbling growl filled the room.  Marah tucked her tail underneath her belly and her head dropped as she whined pitifully, shuffling back to her human as Kato stood guard over the sickly thin boy.
The crack of the riding crop striking flesh was loud and made her flinch even from the observation room.  It was hard not to admire him, even when he was violently flogging a corpse.  Nero watched sadly from her shoulder and she brought a hand up and stroked her fingertips along his spine.
Sherlock glanced at his daemon as he snapped the phone shut.  Atalanta was looking back, approval written in her smug expression.  It seemed John was not so plain after all.
Donovan nearly threw her phone down as Tharin became absolutely still.  Danae looked over in concern, neck outstretched as she lightly touched the hare with her nose.  At the contact, Tharin relaxed, ears twitching, and Donovan’s hand unclenched.  “If you’ve got texts please ignore them.”
you know about Afghanistan?” Kato inquired of him as he moved back to his human.  Now would have been a good time to reestablish etiquette; daemon to daemon, human to human.  Sherlock was silently pleased that they had not even bothered.
John blinked owlishly at him before turning his befuddled gaze to Mike, who was trying desperately to look unbothered as they not only breached human/daemon etiquette but ignored it all together.  “You…uh, told him about us?”
Atalanta was an odd dæmon, to put it lightly.  She loved taking on exotic, extinct, and mythical shape and Sherlock did nothing to dissuade her.  Erimentha gazed upon the change with disdain, her voice haughty and short as she explained to Atalanta that it was a sign of mental retardation.  Sherlock would sneer and Atalanta would scoff and tell Mycroft to stuff it before shifting into a small dragon or griffon to chase the raven around the property.
The sound of the zipper was loud in the quiet morgue as Sherlock sealed the bag up.  Straightening, he turned to her and Molly felt her heart jump.  “Fine, we’ll start with the riding crop.”
“These three people…” another journalist began, breaking the tension that had risen in the room.  “There’s nothing that links them?”
She truly did love her children, her only regret was that she could never be the mother they needed.  Adelyn prayed that one day they would find that person that could take of them in the say she never could.
The boy left the room an orphan, cat dæmon clutched to his chest as if it were going to disappear if he loosened his hold.  Alone, Bobby and Marah waited for news of the children.  Harriett and Titus were found the following day, screaming hysterically as they learned of their mother’s passing.  They would wait a lot longer to hear of John and Kato.
When John and Kato were thirteen, they lied about their age and got a job at the grocer’s two towns over.  The money they got was just enough to keep the important bills paid and the employee discount helped with the food.  It was not a lot, but John did not need much, and Bobby drank more than he ate.
Adelyn thought it curious that Atalanta addressed Mycroft just as often as Sherlock engaged Erimentha.  She often heard her eldest explaining that it was improper and then her youngest would comment disdainfully and ignore him completely.  Though never done in polite society, she did not think long upon it as she knew that her youngest adored his brother.
Bobby quit his job, becoming a stay at home dad that soon turned into a stay at home drunk.  He drank to forget Katelyn and how she looked as he identified her body, pale blue and bloated from the water.  He drank to forget that horrible desperate feeling as they waited of news for his son.  He drank to forget that the son he got back was not the one that had left.  Mostly he just drank because he could.
“Afghanistan,” John replied, speaking to the daemon directly and seeming unbothered by it.  Mike and Asta’s expressions went from affronted to downright horrified.
Two weeks after Titus settled, Bobby accepted the promotion and relocated his family to Venezuela.  It was a beautiful country full of life and culture.  Overseeing the plans to map the new railway system while taking into account ground stability, economic differences, and protected forest lands took much of his attention, leaving him little time for his family.
“Really?” He sounded surprised, walking back to the microscope.  “I thought it was a big improvement.”
Eyes sliding to the left, he gave Sally a desperate, pleading look and she felt Tharin climb into her lap.  “One more question.”
As the son of a Duke, her husband Charleston and his lynx dæmon Idola, had responsibilities that could not be denied.  Though the title would pass on to his oldest brother, until the time in which his brother received the designation there was still certain duties that were expected of him.
In a daze, Bobby allowed himself to be led to a side room, hand fisting in Marah’s fur as he took a seat in the pastel blue chair.  Moments later a teenage boy and an elderly lady joined him.  The boy had a haunted look in his eyes, his cat dæmon sitting listlessly in his lap as the boy dried her with a towel.  His movements were mechanical, as if he was not consciously aware of what he was doing.  The old lady just sat alone, fingers twitching occasionally as her badger dæmon lay beneath her chair.
When Bobby and Marah were young they wanted to be astronauts, superheroes, or pirates.  It was their dream to be somebody strong, amazing, and adventurous.  As with all children, they honestly wanted to just be
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock asked quickly, examining the phone and drawing ‘John’s’ attention away from Atalanta’s scrutiny of his daemon.  Societal norms would not let him examine another’s daemons; there is nothing against daemons scrutinizing each other.  It is considered rude, but not taboo.
Mind groping for anything to break the embarrassed silence, his eyes fell on the little stand at the edge of the park.  “Coffee?”
Mike turned and he felt a smile break across his face at the sight of his old classmate.  There was no mistaking John’s daemon for any other, a strange curiosity for a man who was as normal and laid back as any he had ever known.  “John, John Watson!” He saw the man pause and turn to them.  Mike heaved himself from the bench and Asta bounded after him as he made his way over.  “Stamford, Mike Stamford,” he supplied as John gave him a confused look.  “We were at Bart’s together.”
“We’ll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o’clock.  Sorry, gotta dash…I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.” Pushing past John, he purposefully walked closer to the man’s daemon then common etiquette dictated to study the reaction.  He was pleased to note that there was not one, neither from John nor Kato.  The clouded leopard did not even move to create more space, even though he was inches away from brushing against the feline.  A most curious response.
The look she gave him was both unimpressed and disbelieving.  “You haven’t written a word, have you?”
“Really?!” Greg was truly surprised and yet at the same time, he was not.  Danae was an intimidating daemon, with her size and all, nearly six feet nose to tail and standing almost four feet to the shoulder.  Most daemons were apprehensive until they got to know her; Danae had a gentle heart and a kind disposition.  But Sherlock’s daemon was just plain odd, and Greg did not believe for one second that Atalanta was even remotely intimidated by Danae.  “What did she say?”
John on the other hand at eight years old was much like his dear old dad.  If Bobby had known how much the next few months would have changed his son, his family, he would have never taken the promotion.  As it was there had not been a witch in his family in over seventeen generations, and Bobby could not see the future.
Adelyn believed it was this unknowing neglect on her behalf that caused the emotional distance in her children.  But by the time she truly noticed a problem, Mycroft was nearly out of college and Sherlock was independent to the point of worry.
The heavy rain created flashfloods and landslides.  Eight went missing in the initial chaos, three were found almost immediately after they had regrouped.  Their guide had dragged them back to the visitor’s center where Bobby and Marah found themselves alone.  He had been so sure Katelyn had been next to him, but in the initial chaos she had run after the kids, Varro soaked and clutched to her chest as she stumbled though the underbrush.  It had only taken a second, and then he had lost sight of her completely.
“It will be alright, Nero,” Molly told him softly in a comforting tone.  It was hard though, when she desired the man so, and yet his daemon could not be more disinterested and cold if she had tried.  Atalanta made it seem so effortless, the way she ignored Nero and every other daemon they met.
No one was surprised when she settled as an English Springer Spaniel.  The Watson family had always had canine dæmons, aside from the occasional fox (and the estranged Great Uncle Charlus Watson who no one talked about as his dæmon settled as a wolf).  It was unseemly and never discussed in polite company.
Bobby and Marah could remember it as if it were yesterday.  It had been a Friday and Bobby had taken the day off to be with his family as he saw so little of them lately.  After much deliberation, it was decided that they were going to be classic vacationers and join a guided tour with twenty other foreigners through a small protected section of the Amazon Rainforest.
When Sherlock and Atalanta were eight, Mycroft and Erimentha left for college.  The youngest Holmes never forgave them for that.  Sherlock became distant and Atalanta began to take shapes small enough for her human to carry, the constant physical contact a comfort.
Fingers flying over the small keyboard, Sherlock briefly took in his curious but not offended expression.  “Which was it: Afghanistan or Iraq?” Atalanta snapped, looking at the soldier like he had done something monumentally stupid.
When Harriett was twelve, her dæmon settled as a Robin.  Though disappointed, Bobby was not at all surprised.  His princess was simply too much like her mother to be anything other than a bird.  Light and carefree, jubilant and flitting, just like a bird.  If he was being honest with himself, he knew long before the settling that Titus was fit to have wings.
“Doesn’t mean you weren’t impressed,” Danae countered.  Greg turned to her and fixed her with a glare.  His daemon met it with her own steady gaze and the detective soon turned away in defeat.  She was right, of course.  “So…are we going?”
The loud cracking finally stopped and Molly took in the sight of him.  Sherlock stood over the body, hair in disarray, panting, and a wild look in his eyes.  It made something deep in her gut clench pleasantly and she pulled Nero from her shoulder and cupped him in her hands as she held him up to her face.
What followed felt like a three ringed circus.  His semi not-answer was followed by a question.  Greg socially blundered and spent the next minute trying to back track before the text alerts drowned out the response.  When his mobile buzzed after everyone else, he grabbed it while Donovan wrapped up the interview.
He tried not to stare at Kato, eyes only flickering to the daemon as he paced back to his human’s side, but it was difficult.  John’s daemon was exotic and - though he would never state it out loud - adorable.  The fact that he also defied gender norm was also hard to ignore, but Mike was able to pull his attention back to John and tried to ignore the way the clouded leopard moved every time Asta did.  Kato shifted so he had a direct opening to her at all times, as if he was waiting for a signal to attack.  It was at odds with the way John stood, relaxed and seemingly at ease.
John’s blue-grey eyes flicked to her, but he addressed Sherlock when he spoke.  “We don’t even know a thing about each other.  I don’t know where we are meeting…we don’t even know your names.”
The urge to fidget nearly overcame him, but John fought down the reaction with ruthless militant efficiency.  Beside him on the floor, Kato did not even twitch.  He laid beside the chair, poised like the Sphynx in Egypt, calm, regal and attentive, but as still as the statue.  Looking at them, one would never suspect how unnerved they were by the stare of the therapist or her dæmon.
Harriett scrutinized her ‘brother’ as Titus leaned closer, long nimble fingers poking at the baby’s dæmon as the monkey inspected it.  “Is it supposed to look that way?” She questioned innocently and Bobby chuckled softly at her.
John and Kato never talked about what had happened to them in the jungle, but then again the never talked about much of anything to anyone anymore.  Spoken only when spoken too, John became a distant child, hiding in his room or running about into the small wooded area near the house.  Kato rarely changed forms, choosing to hold a single shape for months.  When he did shift it was always into a predator.  Kato became John’s protector, standing away from other dæmons, even family.
Most people viewed those with dog dæmons in two ways: the bigger, fiercer hound was met with caution for they - and their humans – were commonly military, police, or government.  As for those whose dæmons settled in the form of a gentler breed were typically part of the serving class.  Though it was considered an old world view, it was nearly impossible to ignore the ingrained instinctual reaction to someone’s dæmon.  And even when considered part of the serving class, Bobby was content with life and proud that his dæmon settled as a dog.
Writing vigorously in his notebook, Sherlock did not even look up when he addressed her.  “I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes.  A man’s alibi depends on it. Text me.”
“She’s so pretty,” Nero mumbled softly.  Molly nodded in agreement, but she was not looking at the daemon.  “Her fur is so white…it looks really soft.  Do you think-”
The quiet hum in the lab was broken only by the sounds of Sherlock working diligently at the far end of the table.  Adjusting the magnification on the microscope, he examined the petri dish while Atalanta watched him work.  She spared a glance at the door as Mike entered the underground lab with a plain looking man following.
John felt much better after the shower and Kato walked with a little bounce as he crossed the room.  “Somebody is feeling chipper this morning,” he commented to his dæmon with a small frown.
Mike hummed in amusement as his daemon complained in a dramatic fashion.  “I’m telling you, Mike, that man is insane! Insane, do you hear me!”
“You look great,” Nero told her, leaning forward to press his tiny hands to her cheeks.  She giggled at the sensation and returned him to his customary position before exiting the room and approaching the seemingly unapproachable man.
He showered his princess with gifts and spoiled her rotten.  She was the perfect daughter, and when she was four, her brother was brought into the world.  Compared to Harriett’s birth, Katelyn could almost say John’s was boring.
“I got shot,” John replied awkwardly.  Mike spared a glance at Asta, her look plainly stating, ‘open mouth, insert foot.’
John glanced as Kato, but his dæmon appeared to be gazing out the window, oblivious to the mounting tension.  But John knew better.  Kato’s ear twitched minutely when Edmur stood and John cleared his throat as the other dæmon approached.  “Good,” he replied after a moment.  “Very good.”
In the games Marah would be a dog in one form or another.  When asked, she would only say that she felt most comfortable as a canine, or some other shape that allowed her to have all feet on the ground.  While imaginative, Marah never took the form of a bird, bat, or anything with wings as she was afraid of heights.
“John, you were soldiers, it’s gonna take a while to adjust to civilian life; and writing a blog about everything that happens will honestly help you two,” her eyes flicked to his dæmon quickly, just a polite glance that lasted no longer then society considered normal.  Even still, John felt a weight heavy in his chest.
, but we’re looking for it.  There has to be one,” Lestrade and every other person in the room reached for their mobiles as they trilled and chirped with text alert.  The text left Greg annoyed and strangely impressed.
Large paws, seemingly disproportionate to his small stocky body, padded over the sheets his extended claws catching on the material.  Pressing his wet nose into John’s cheek, his human was pulled violently into the waking world.  Sitting up with a heaving gasp, Kato nearly tumbled from the bed, cursing softly as he tried to pull his claws from the comforter without shredding it.
Kato came awake with a grunt of annoyance, ears flicking back and forth as his large eyes swept across the room.  Pressed against his human’s covered leg, the dæmon could feel John shifting in his sleep as his mind tortured him with memories since passed.  Long tail twitching in agitation, Kato came to his feet as John’s discomfort surged into him, amplifying his fight-or-flight response.
“We can confirm that this apparent suicide resembles those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.  In light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked.  The investigation is ongoing, but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.”
Undeterred by how bored he sounded she gazed into his gorgeous blue eyes and tried again.  “I was wondering if you’d like to have coffee.”
“That man is infuriating,” Greg replied, not quite collapsing into his chair as he ruffled through the case file of the last suicide.
“Sorry,” he replied as his daemon gave up on trying to get Atalanta to acknowledge her.  “It’s in my coat.”
“I, er…” she started nervously before she steeled her nerves and smiled at him flirtatiously.  “I refreshed it a bit.”
Sherlock and Atalanta followed Mycroft and his white-necked raven dæmon like two little ducklings.  Mycroft was patient and his dæmon was stern.  Together they raised the two and Adelyn could not have been more proud.
There is no law forbidding a daemon from touching a deceased corpse, it was in fact quite common in law enforcement.  Sometimes a canine daemon will sniff or lick a corpse in order to gather more evidence and there were no repercussions as it did not have the same effect it would have had the human been alive.  However, it was only done out of necessity and Nero avoided touching the corpse out of respect.
“So... what are you doing here?” John continues in a valiant attempt to keep himself entertained. Having acerbic comments thrown at him by a stranger still beats dying of frostbite and a slight fear of heights.
“We still have unfinished business,” Sebastian growls. He turns the gun back on Sherlock. John heaves a brief sigh of relief before realizing that Sherlock is now in danger, and they’ve got to find a way out of it. Rather,
When he gets off the phone, he leaps up from the couch ecstatically, crying, “Brilliant! YES! Four serial suicides and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas! Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Put the kettle on.” And, without further ado, he’s gone.
Sherlock shrugs, takes the weapon, and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. “No bullets. Do you think I’m an imbecile? Simple sleight of hand, any imbecile could execute it.” He removes an entire magazine’s worth of rounds from his back pocket.
Around Thanksgiving, Greg and Molly have a row and Greg comes by the apartment to complain to John. Unfortunately, Sherlock is also in a strop due to a nasty case of cabin fever, and follows both men around making scathing observations the entire time.
“Oh, right.” John pauses and rapidly digs himself into a deeper hole. “Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way—”
John’s pager goes off. Great. “Fine,” he hisses, seizing his jacket. “I’m working late. Don’t stay up.”
John has to suppress a smile. Dammit! He should be angry. It's just that the thought of a post-coital Sherlock blabbering on about beheaded corpses strikes him as endearing more than anything.
“Sherlock?” he calls gently; the bathroom door is open just a crack, and the light filtering out makes him shield his eyes. It’s 3:30 am.
Then Sherlock disappears for a few days and reappears with a girl. Janine. John has the pleasure of meeting her when he arrives home after a work trip to an attractive woman with wet hair who is wearing Sherlock’s shirt and obviously nothing else.
‘Of course’? Literally nothing about Sherlock can ever be preceded with ‘of course’. The man’s a walking enigma. “So he’s not—
Another dismissive wave. “Not trying to get laid by my girlfriend of what, two and a half weeks? Really, a skiing trip for Valentine’s Day, how
“Sherlock Holmes,” the stranger finally introduces himself. He’s texting one-handed again and speaking as though they are not in one of the more bizarre and legally dubious situations of John’s life.
“Hmm?” John turns around. Sherlock is standing across the room, glaring at both of them. “Oh, he’s just in a mood. I threw out his hamster carcasses.”
“I shall,” Sherlock says woefully. “Might I suggest, again, that you look into babysitting, because clearly this doctoring venture isn’t working out for you, your diagnoses are painfully obvious and—”
Sherlock gets sick, and it is soon abundantly clear that he’s a horrible patient. Worse even than the crotchety elderly woman John’s been dealing with lately, who thinks she’s dying from her tennis elbow and acts like she knows more than him whenever he says something she doesn’t want to hear. Actually, she and Sherlock would get along splendidly.
The two of them finally decide to watch the Patriots win the Super Bowl again, because that's always a guaranteed mood boost, except Sherlock plops himself down on the couch like an obnoxious clingy cat and starts analyzing every single player.
Sherlock is silent for so long John figures he's fallen asleep. But then, very quietly, Sherlock confesses, “People caring.”
“I wouldn’t have minded,” Sherlock says. “If you’d...” He gestures vaguely. “With her.” For some reason the indifference in his tone stings.
John realizes now that it probably isn’t on for him to be so casual when explaining that his utterly mental roommate is regularly targeted by assassins, but he’s already resigned himself to being treated as though he’s somehow responsible for Sherlock, and in a way he is. He got himself into this mess, after all. And, as he rolls his eyes at the detective and gestures for Greg to walk away, he can’t help but be rather glad that he did.
“Why ask for live-in companions?”  John asked again, after Sherlock finished infecting a rat with the newest Plague sample he’d isolated.
“You hold the Plague in check,” John corrected, “and require only companionship for reimbursement.  Personally, I’d ask for payment.”
the kingdoms yet,” he said, grudging.  “It’s still out there.  Once I’ve eradicated it entirely I’ll be able to rest on my laurels.  In the meantime—”
The sorcerer's eyes were two chips of obsidian, cold and merciless, and they saw straight into the heart of any man or woman.  Any soul who stood before him could only watch helplessly as he read their deepest, darkest secrets off their faces and smiled with a knowing that was not of this earth.
“It’s interesting,” Sherlock said gravely.  “Something I recently discovered – I was never immune; I simply never caught it.”
brims.  The terrified royal would whisper that it was a sign of the sorcerer's two-faced, changeling personality - some even guessed that the man had literally two faces, the better to watch them all with, or perhaps because of an experiment gone wrong.
The guards backed away slowly.  John rode through the gates, dismounted, and walked through the doors alone.
"What about..."-- Michelle hesitated before whispering the word, a name that caused her mother anger every time she heard it -- "...
He then felt around in his pockets for food, and found two thick slices of bread with marmalade from a breakfast he barely remembered leaving in the middle of, having suddenly realized that there was an execution this morning and that he’d be able to sneak the cadaver out for research if he left quickly.  He broke off a piece of bread and tossed it at the frog, who jumped up and caught it in its wide, wide mouth.
Sherlock leaned forward as well, steepling his fingers, brow furrowing.  “Tempting,” he said softly.  “Very tempting.”  He sat up straight and laid one arm flat on the table.  “But how do I know you won’t use my notes to eradicate the Plague and take all the credit?”
Two servants stepped out from the curtained area behind the throne, carrying between them a large wooden chest.  They set it down carefully and made a big show of opening it.
“You would be allowed to bring with you as much as you could carry on your person,” the Queen finished.
“Naturally. Sorry to disappoint, by the way. Doubtless you were anticipating some sort of spell or occult ritual that changed your appearance beyond recognition.”
Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock, but his protest went unheard while Irene flashed a winning smile at Mrs. Hudson and allowed herself to be led into a lounge, Sherlock and John disgruntledly following suit.
The next few weeks were pleasant.  John amused himself exploring the castle and strolling through the grounds, which seemed to be an equal mix of lovely gardens and terrifying swamps.  Some days, he’d find the sorcerer, or vice versa, and John would watch as the sorcerer performed his experiments.  Some nights, he’d hear unearthly music carrying through the halls, and be lulled to sleep.
John left the room, went down a long hallway, turned another corner— and faintly his ears picked up a sound from nearby.  A light wooden door opened onto a spiral staircase, some ambient light filtering out from below.  He went down the steps and found himself in some rather dismal cellars, torches flickering in their sconces.  The faint thudding noise had grown louder.  Following the sound, John eventually found himself in what could only be the dungeons.  A table covered with a bloodstained white cloth stood at the far end, and before it was a man bending over a cadaver with an open chest wound.
In a certain place lived a young beekeeper, whose name was Sherlock.  One day, as he was washing severed body parts off in a rivulet, a large, fat frog swam toward him, looking so odd that Sherlock was alarmed at the sight of it.
Normally, this was the part of the narrative where the prince or princess told their savior “Thank you” with a hint of “I love you”.
The sorcerer looked surprisingly grave.  “if I could beat the Plague, if I could free society of it, I’d feel that my life had reached its summit, and be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life.  But never have I been so hard-pressed by an opponent.” The sorcerer’s expression grew dark.  “The root of this Plague eludes my best efforts.”
“- and it’s changed hundreds of lives for the better.”  She smiled calmly at a quietly fuming Sherlock, looking at him with the impassivity of a Greek statue.
The sorcerer snorted.  “Yes, and tearing families apart and forcing royal children to stay with me against their will is better.”
“Sorry,” said John.  “I didn’t realize- the others said the food appeared magically; I didn’t think I’d keep anyone waiting.”
“I stopped after the seventh royal called me a creepy know-all and ran away and got himself lost,” the sorcerer sniffed. “It was too much trouble.”
“I’m attempting to rediscover a variant of it at the moment.  I don’t yet have a way of importing the ingredients, but perhaps there are substitutes endemic to this region.”  The sorcerer leaned forward, food forgotten.  “They’re in the form of a combination of herbs and roots that the patient chews for its juices – the rest of it is spat out, but-”
“What could a great fat frog like this want here,” said Sherlock to himself, “and why is it doing that with its mouth?  Is it hungry?”
Some days, the sorcerer would drag his helpless victim with him through the streets of their kingdom, casting a spell over them to ensure they would not be seen.  He would then point out people and describe minute details of their life down to what they had for breakfast.
“Can’t swim?” said the frog, eyes popping – which was not so much an expression of surprise as the default state for a frog.  “Why, how undersea do you get around?”
“Oh,” said the sorcerer.  “It’s you.”  He carefully lay down the whip.  “Mrs. Hudson must have been truly desperate to recruit you in her futile endeavor.”  But he followed John upstairs, so John supposed it wasn’t entirely futile.
The sorcerer’s discerning glance passed over John from head to toe.  He nodded slowly.  “I suppose that is… acceptable,” he said.  "When did you get back from the War on Infidels?"
Fortunately, the fire didn’t spread too far, and the two soon returned to their quarters, Sherlock sulkily nursing his bruise.
“Medicine is unbelievably backwards here,” the sorcerer complained.  “Your country hasn’t even invented anesthetics.”
“Hardly,” said Sherlock.  “There’s no point.  A far better alternative, one I’m working on, would be to prevent these outbreaks from occurring.  It would be more efficient.  The Plague would never trouble our people again.”
At the end of each year, the villagers living nearest the black castle would gather ‘round to watch as the tall black double-doors opened and the prince or princess ran out, fleeing as if wild dogs were nipping at their heels.  The kinder villagers waited with blankets and mugs of hot cocoa.  The less kind waited with dozens of questions.
“We haven’t spoken since you disinherited me for wanting to become a physician.”  John’s face twisted bitterly.  “Am I suddenly useful again?”
“SHERLOCK!’  The mild-mannered housekeeper slammed her hands on the table, looking so fearsome that Sherlock started.  “Eat,” she commanded, and he obeyed immediately.
“You hold the Plague in check,” John corrected, “and require only companionship for reimbursement.  Personally, I’d ask for payment.”
“So this girl wants tae buy two corpses offa me,” Wiggin said in a rush as soon as they were all seated, “n I sed ‘two ‘undred please’ n she went like that tae me ‘am wit Sherlock’ n ad never seen her before so I told her to wait please and came to ask yer – she wit you?”
John frowned.  “Why would a doctor want to kill pain?  Pain is the only way we can figure out what’s going on with a patient.”
Once upon a time, there was a kindly old beekeeper who lived by a hospital.  The villages around him lived in secure tranquility.
Yule crept closer and closer, until on the evening before the holiday, Sherlock found John in the armory.
The sorcerer’s discerning gaze passed over John from head to toe.  He nodded slowly.  “I suppose that is… acceptable,” he said.  “When did you get back from the War on Infidels?”
“No, it’s understandable,” said the sorcerer.  “Wicked sorcerers don’t usually have things as mundane as names.”
It was all a bit much, John thought.  He felt like he was going off to get married, not just to live with a supposedly-evil sorcerer for a year.
"It's alright," said John, cutting off that train of thought hastily.  "That was... amazing.  Brilliant."
“The same Plague that you saved the five kingdoms from?” said John, interested.  “The Seaworthy Plague?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  The strange stairway under the stone was dark, and he could barely make out where the stairs lay.  The darkness seemed to stretch on forever, with no end in sight.
“Sorry,” he mumbled, staring at his feet.  “I couldn’t sleep.  My mind was racing.  The playing – it’s cathartic; fits my mood.”
By the second month, John began to wonder why the sorcerer hadn’t taken him out to try and deduct people.  It wasn’t that he was jealous, he told himself.  He just wanted to watch the deductive process.  He brought the matter up the next time he ran into the sorcerer.
“Put this on,” John’s friend said, tossing him a hat and a fake mustache. John caught it instinctively.
“Oh, plenty!” said Mike.  “Down in the Riverwide Research Institute – there’s plenty of brilliant river spirits!  Geniuses – they’d put you and me to shame.”
“Your nurses are indispensable to you.  I can have them arrested.”  She didn’t look away from her son’s helpless glare.  “On the other hand, I can ensure your office no longer struggles financially.”  She waved a hand.
illness; it doesn’t spread it.”  He narrowed his eyes at John in sudden suspicion.  “You do bathe, don’t you?”
Every year, the sorcerer would demand that a prince or princess be sent to stay with him for twelve months.  Or longer, if the poor soul wished.
There was a small corridor near the back of the castle.  The princes had discovered it when they were still boys, searching for secret passageways to slay dragons in.  It was dark, room along the wall for one small torch that flickered in the breeze as the boys, now grown, spoke.
The gaze turned admiring.  “You’ve done it too, then, haven’t you?  Taken someone’s body for research?”
“I’m not I follow,” said John.  “Are you saying there’s someone who goes around drinking the blood of royal-” then it hit him.  “
“He’s been in his lab for days,” she said disapprovingly.  “He’ll work himself to death at this rate.”
It was all a bit much, John thought.  He felt like he was going off to get married, not to live with a supposedly evil sorcerer for a year.
The sorcerer shook his head.  “It was a long time ago.”  They sat down at the same end of the table, the sorcerer at the head, John at his right hand.  Mrs. Hudson hesitated before resignedly allowing them to help themselves to the cold food.  “Plague,” he elaborated.
“I’m not I follow,” said John.  “Are you saying there’s someone who goes around drinking the blood of royal-” then it hit him.  “
It wasn’t that John didn’t notice the way his companion’s eyes lit up whenever John entered the room, or that it never crossed his mind that his companion was incredibly attractive.  He just… didn’t care, he told himself.  It didn’t matter.  Besides, Mary was waiting for him back at the hospital.  They weren’t married, but he’d always thought it’d be a foregone conclusion – it was the most convenient situation he could think of.
One night, John heard the discordant sounds his predecessors had warned him about. The screeching woke him before first light, and for a moment, he remembered raised scimitars gouging streaks into his armor. The thought prevented him from going back to sleep. He got up.
“We’ve already turned the place into a clinic,” she said, “where people have to rely on what stock treatments we have left that you’ve already made.  We’ve lost most of our customers – they loved you, you know, but you’ve been gone for a year; you can’t expect them to hold on.”
for him, they said, they’d wish and hope for the best, and in the end, he died alone – I was the only person by his side during the last-” He broke off.  “In any case.  Mycroft was intellectually my equal, but spent his time cultivating friendships rather than learning anything important.  I never realized what could possibly have caused him to act in such an irrational way…” He shifted uncomfortably and looked away.  “Until now,” he finished awkwardly.
John couldn’t help but grin.  For all that everyone claimed the sorcerer was wicked, said wicked sorcerer had helped his practice more than anyone in his family ever had.
Sherlock snorted.  “First things first,” he said.  “I haven’t eradicated it yet.”  He thought for a moment.  “I suppose I’d become a beekeeper,” he said at last.  “I’ve always wanted to.  I’d probably continue my scientific pursuits, but in a less focused way – more time for fun experiments instead of obsessing over this Plague.”
The gaze turned admiring.  “You’ve done it too, then, haven’t you?  Taken someone’s body for research?”
“Hmmm,” said Mike Stand-in-the-Ford.  “Down in the river we have a goodly many creatures who only stay underwater and never come onto the land.  They are sadly ignorant of all the good things the land has to offer.  I never thought of it before, but I suppose some land-dwellers might be just the opposite.”  It looked pensive, an expression that seemed out of place on the face of such a large, funny-looking frog.  Then it brightened, and clapped its front flippers together.  “Well, today is just your day!  I will show you all of the good things you have been missing!  And the river is such a lovely place – much nicer than the land, with all its dirt and angry mammals.”  Mike swam around in a circle.
‘Shezza’ was downstairs sawing at his violin, having just finished sawing at a femur.  He placed the instrument carefully in its case before turning and raising an eyebrow imperiously at Wiggin.  It wasn’t quite as intimidating without his coat – John had noted some time ago that Sherlock did a certain thing with his coat collar and his cheekbones and Sherlock had gotten extremely flustered and flailed his arms about.  He imagined the man wasn’t used to people figuring what it was that gave him the imposing look.  Perhaps John was getting better at deductions.
“It was a bit of a joke when I first coined it,” the sorcerer explained.  “The Plague originated in my homeland, across the sea.  I was immune.  My biological parents passed away when I was fourteen, but not before sending me on a ship with a few others.  One of them-” he blinked, throat working.  “One of them brought it with her unknowingly.  She died.  The disease spread.  The man who took me in, Lord Holmes – he- he treated me as a son.  His other son Mycroft taught me how to make deductions.  We’d make a game out of it, figuring out who passerby were and where they were going.”  He paused again.  “I tried my hardest to save them.  I didn’t realize how strong it was.”
“I’ve already force-fed him my successful cure,” she said.  “He was a complete idiot – infected himself with the Plague and tried a hundred ways to cure it before finally caving and asking me for help.  We barely got it in time.  He didn’t think I’d finish, told me to leave it on his drawer.  He’ll come to in a couple of hours.  In the meantime, you’d better take him to the hospital.”
No promises for how long this will take.  The unedited version is linked in the "Works inspired by" section, if you want to read the whole thing without cliffhangers or wait.  It might be years again before this one is done, which is too long to wait for an ending.
“Quite right.”  John tried not to sound too impressed.  He was a man of science, and it wouldn’t do for him to look like a gape-mouthed yokel.  “How did you know that?”
the kingdoms yet,” he said, grudging.  “It’s still out there.  Once I’ve eradicated it entirely I’ll be able to rest on my laurels.  In the meantime-”
A small tendril of trepidation snaked its way into John’s stomach, but not nearly as much as he should have felt.  Bloodstains aside, it was difficult to be afraid of the man when he looked so
“Why, Sherlock!”  Irene said.  She seemed ready to deny even considering such a thing, but something in Sherlock’s expression must have stopped her.  “It’s like you said – who’d believe me?  A peasant girl, coming up with the final cure before the powerful sorcerer who stopped the Plague the first time around?  What a story!”
“Mrs. Hudson was my father’s housekeeper, and then my brother’s,” the sorcerer explained.  “I inherited her along with the estate when they passed.”
He looked like an ordinary man without the black collared cape.  A bit tall and thin, perhaps; darker-skinned, a foreigner, but not a Moor.  His cheekbones were stark in the torchlight, his hair having the distinct shape of hair that has been flattened under a cap for too long.  The only unusual thing about him was his eyes – small, black, intelligent eyes, flickering over John in a way that made him feel small, as if under the scrutiny of a crowd of a thousand, like he was waiting to perform at his mother’s tournaments again.  He straightened his back, for what it was worth – the sorcerer looked to be at least a head taller than him – and planted his feet, meeting those analytical eyes squarely.
“You’ve kept your guest downstairs for so long,” the lady said reproachfully.  “The food’s already cold.”
“All that it could possibly have to say has already crossed my mind,” said Sherlock darkly.  “Its destruction remains inevitable.”
Sherlock frowned, leaning his elbows on his knees and pressing his fingers together in front of his lips.  “Describe her.”
But either way, John thought, it wasn’t as if Sherlock would have believed him.  John would simply refuse to leave the castle after the thirty-first; that would be far more convincing than any words would.
“I was born a prince,” John said easily.  “I was disinherited some time ago.  Mother was a bit… old-fashioned.”
“I don’t get around undersea,” said Sherlock, rather peevishly.  “I’m a land-dwelling creature – a mammal, to be precise.  I walk about on land like…” he cast about in his memory for an animal that the frog might recognize which walked about on land.  “Wait.  Frogs walk about on land, don’t they?  Or, hop, rather, but the purpose is the same, even if the mechanism differs.”
“In the meantime,” John finished for him, “you’ll continue dropping heavy things on corpses to see how long it takes their ribs to crack.”
The sorcerer smiled, and John reflected that the uncannily knowing gaze seemed to have lost its sharp edges.  Or, rather, it had turned into something comforting – he still felt exposed every time the sorcerer looked at him, stripped bare down to his very soul, but upon seeing naked truths about John and his life, the sorcerer expressed only approval, and sometimes support.
When John burst into the hall, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.  Mrs. Hudson, however, was seated at the foot of the stairs.
Irene smiled, placing her empty teacup back on the table and standing up.  “I’ll be in touch,” she said.  “Do let me know if you’ve changed your mind, won’t you?”
The sorcerer’s eyes were two chips of obsidian, cold and merciless, and they saw straight into the heart of any man or woman.  Any soul who stood before him could only watch helplessly as he read their deepest, darkest secrets off their faces and smiled with a knowing that was not of this earth.
The answers were fairly constant.  The stay began comfortably - it was a large castle, after all.  Soft beds with down mattresses and plump pillows, delicious food that appeared mysteriously on the dining table every morning, strains of lovely music in the air every now and again.
Weeks blurred into months, and soon winter arrived, bringing with it enough snow to blanket the world in white.
John couldn’t help but grin.  For all that everyone claimed the sorcerer was wicked, said wicked sorcerer had helped his practice more than anyone in his family ever had.
Sherlock snorted.  “First things first,” he said.  “I haven’t eradicated it yet.”  He thought for a moment.  “I suppose I’d become a beekeeper,” he said at last.  “I’ve always wanted to.  I’d probably continue my scientific pursuits, but in a less focused way – more time for fun experiments instead of obsessing over this Plague.”
John couldn't help but notice Sherlock's subtle preening under his praise - perhaps few people in his life had ever complimented him on his deductions before.
The sorcerer shook his head.  “It was a long time ago.”  They sat down at the same end of the table, the sorcerer at the head, John at his right hand.  Mrs. Hudson hesitated before resignedly allowing them to help themselves to the cold food.  “Plague,” he elaborated.
“What was it like?”  “Did you catch a glimpse of his spellbooks?”  “What was he like?”  “What did he
The sorcerer snorted.  “Yes, and tearing families apart and forcing royal children to stay with me against their will is better.”
” the sorcerer said impatiently.  “It stops a patient’s pain for around two hours, and then you can operate on them.  It’s better than hiring clods to hold them down while they scream their heads off when you cut them open.”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, staring at his feet. “I couldn’t sleep. My mind was racing. The playing – it’s cathartic; fits my mood.”
John couldn’t help feeling a sense of bitterness at Sherlock’s assessment.  “I see,” he said, striving to keep his tone mild.
The sorcerer raised his hands to his face, then quickly dropped them, remembering the bloodstains.  “Your clothes are of a style three years out of fashion.  Your jewelry is flawless, but when your hand shifted just now, the skin beneath your rings was tan.  You aren’t accustomed to wearing such riches; the way you hold yourself – it’s unfamiliar for you; uncomfortable.  There’s a tear on your sleeve from where it dragged against something sharp – you weren’t careful with it; that sort of care takes decades of wearing the right clothes.  But you’ve managed to avoid getting a speck of dust on your doublet… Who are you
“Actually, I was hoping you could tell me about this.”  He walked over to the cadaver.  “Blunt trauma, I presume?  A large, heavy object, propelled from some distance…” He peered at it more closely.  “But the cause of death appears to be…”
“I didn’t realize you had a name,” John added.  “I mean, I suppose in hindsight that was a bit silly of me, but…”
The lady tutted.  “Their mothers have a lot to answer for,” she said.  “I’m Mrs. Hudson, by the way.”
“Asphyxiation,” the sorcerer interrupted.  “The man was hanged for stealing a side of beef.  I picked him up earlier today to experiment on.”
He didn’t deny it this time.  “These kingdoms are ridiculous,” he said through a mouthful of potatoes.  “Your royalty refuses to
“The Seaworthy Plague started from the royal families last time.  I suspected a food was the carrier, something the poor wouldn’t get to eat – venison, pork, a rare spice – or possibly wine or a sweetmeat, and then it would have spread to the servants…”  He pressed his fingers together, lost in thought.  “…maybe those who finished the leftovers got it, or the cooking staff who tasted it.  But then how would it have spread outside the walls of the castle?  Surely no one
The Royal Guard escorted him to the black gates, behind which lay the black double-doors, with as much fanfare as if they had been escorting a legitimate prince to a foreign country.  The gates slowly opened, with no signs of outside assistance, and the doors soon followed.
In the Year of the Purple Bear, the five neighboring kingdoms had finally exhausted their heirs.  All twelve of the princes and princesses who were past the age of adulthood had stayed with the sorcerer for at least one year, and none were willing to ever set foot in that godforsaken castle again.  It was the turn of Queen Catherine XVII to send one of his children to the sorcerer, and she could not for the life of her persuade any of her children to return.
The lady tutted.  “Their mothers have a lot to answer for,” she said.  “I’m Mrs. Hudson, by the way.”
“Imagine this,” said he.  “A strain of poison grows and festers in the bloodstream of, say, a pig.  Said pig is slaughtered and brought to the table of the Queen.  The royals eat the pig, and the poison enters their blood.  Now, how would that poison continue to spread?  How would the poisoned blood enter another being?”
“No, I insist.  See your family, tell them you’re alright.  Tell them- tell them I’ll stop asking for royal companions after this year.”  He swept out of the room before John could explain that he meant he wouldn’t be leaving after the end of the year.
“Actually, I was hoping you could tell me about this.”  John walked over to the cadaver, frowning at the chest wound.  “Blunt trauma, I presume?  A large, heavy object, propelled from some distance…” He peered at it more closely.  “But the cause of death appears to be…”
Most princes at this stage would stable their horse, then sneak around in search of a bedchamber, desperately hoping the sorcerer would ignore them.
What John had been thinking was something else entirely, something he’d been thinking for weeks by now. This time, he didn’t hesitate to voice it.
“Hello?”  He called, stepping around a corner into what appeared to be an indoor garden that had, if you will pardon the pun, gone to seed.  There were drooping, blackened stems everywhere, dead leaves littering the ground.  Mostly poisonous plants, he noted, with detached interest.
“Why princes and princesses?  I mean, why make royal descendants stay with you?  Not that I’m complaining, but aren’t they usually a pain to deal with?”
I apologize for making Wiggin a caricature from Sco’ish twitter.  I had to share my horrible bastardization of the dialect with the world.
“Oh, bloody hell,” he said.  He practically jumped onto his horse, galloping toward the castle as if wild dogs were nipping at his heels.
“I’ll have to lay these fingers out to dry,” he said.  “Would you mind leaving them on an upstairs windowsill for me?”
“Naturally.  Sorry to disappoint, by the way.  Doubtless you were anticipating some sort of spell or occult ritual that changed your appearance beyond recognition.”
It was silly of him, he reflected, talking to the frog as though it could understand him.  But the frog turned to him, with large, intelligent eyes, and the wide-lipped mouth still gaping open in its silly face.
“Not the ordinary people, no,” Irene said loftily.  “You have to find the right listener.  But you’re right on one count.”  She sipped at her tea delicately, smiling.  “I’m not here to blackmail you.”  Her look turned innocent, guileless.  “I’m here to compare notes.”
The sorcerer scowled.  “The laws of this land are made by idiots who oppose progress,” said he.  “I’d never learn anything if I followed the letter of the law.”
“Quite right.”  John tried not to sound too impressed.  He was a man of science, and it wouldn’t do for him to look like a gape-mouthed yokel.  “How did you know that?”
“Oh.”  Irene’s eyes sparkled with interest.  “Are you the physician?  The only competent physician in all the five kingdoms?”
“I hold kingdoms hostage with the threat of the most dangerous plague known to man.  Hardly a sign of goodness.”
“He’s been in his lab for days,” she said disapprovingly.  “He’ll work himself to death at this rate.”
“The Plague!  The instigator” – Sherlock paced back and forth agitatedly – “it wasn’t poisoned meat; it was Mr. Tuffles!”
The sorcerer paused for a moment, bow drooping by his side, staring in front of him intently. John raised his hands and clapped, too slowly to be proper applause.
He didn’t deny it this time.  “These kingdoms are ridiculous,” he said through a mouthful of potatoes.  “Your royalty refuses to
The sorcerer smiled, and John reflected that the uncannily knowing gaze seemed to have lost its sharp edges. Or, rather, it had turned into something comforting – he still felt exposed every time the sorcerer looked at him, stripped bare down to his very soul, but upon seeing naked truths about John and his life, the sorcerer expressed only approval, and sometimes support.
“Why princes and princesses?  I mean, why make royal descendants stay with you?  Not that I’m complaining, but aren’t they usually a pain to deal with?”
As soon as Sarah set down her bags, she rushed over to where Mary stood, waiting.   They passionately embraced, lips meeting.
John choked back a laugh.  “It’s not nice,” he admonished.  “Ordinary people are a bit unsettled by dismembered body parts.”
The guards backed away slowly.  John rode through the gates, dismounted, and walked through the doors alone.
John shook his head.  It was true that he still felt no passionate ardor for her, but neither did he actively loathe her; it was as good a match as he could hope for.
Sherlock put a finger to his painted lips delicately.  "Works at the stall over there... No soup stains on her shirt; she's been doing this for a while - the stains that do exist are on the sides of her skirt, made by the fingers of shorter children.  Cheap quality of clothing, torn in places, so her family's living in poverty, but her limbs show a healthy vitality that only exists in the well-fed.  From the state of the monarchy in this country and the lack of opportunity for social advancement it should be safe to assume that her husband hunts illegally."  He looked at John expectantly.
“Hello?” he called, stepping around a corner into what appeared to be an indoor garden that had, if you will pardon the pun, gone to seed.  There were drooping, blackened stems everywhere, dead leaves littering the ground.  Mostly poisonous plants, he noted, with detached interest.
“No, it’s understandable,” said the sorcerer.  “Wicked sorcerers don’t usually have things as mundane as names.”
“What about…” – Michael hesitated before whispering the word, a name that caused his mother anger every time she heard it – “…
“No, it’s perfectly fine,” said John. “A racket like that right outside my door at three in the morning couldn’t possibly have woken me.”
Once upon a time, there was a wicked sorcerer who lived in a tall black castle.  The kingdoms around him lived in fear.
The next morning, John was carefully dressed in silk and satin.  The royal hairdressers brushed and trimmed his hair as best they could, cut short as it was for practicality; the beauticians primped and powdered his face.  The tailors wept at his increased weight – seven and a half pounds, they cried; now all their measurements were a quarter-inch off – and did the best they could with the clothes they’d made.  The jewelers brought their finest wares, and the Queen herself chose stones that would lend the most authenticity.
Most princes at this stage would stable their horse, then sneak around in search of a bedchamber, desperately hoping the sorcerer would ignore them.
Fortunately, the fire didn’t spread too far, and the two soon returned to their quarters, Sherlock sulkily nursing his bruise.
John grabbed his brother’s flailing hands.  It wasn’t prudent to blurt out the fact that Sherlock wasn’t a real sorcerer, and if he told his brother the truth, he’d probably be sent to an asylum.  But he couldn’t let this slander of his friend slide.
“I hold kingdoms hostage with the threat of the most dangerous plague known to man.  Hardly a sign of goodness.”
me,” Sherlock scoffed.  “Don’t you know anything about the people who live here?  They’ll never believe an explanation for my cure as mundane as one that involves no magic.”
“In the meantime,” interrupted John, “you’ll continue dropping heavy things on corpses to see how long it takes for their ribs to crack.”
“Really?” Sherlock said coolly.  “I seem to recall said alliances bursting into flames after we quarreled and went our separate ways.”
“But you silly thing,” said Sherlock, furrowing his brow, his veins beginning to fill with adrenaline, “how am I to go with you?  I can’t swim, and…”
“Go on back to your family, if you’d like,” he said, without preamble.  “Just… come back before the end of the year.  I’d rather see you one last time before you go.”
“There’s the genius of it,” said Sherlock, eyes gleaming.  “It jumps from infected to healthy with ease, and few can spot it before it’s too late.  Sometimes I almost imagine it to possess its own intelligence.”
“It’s poisoned,” Harry explained earnestly.  “One small cut and the sorcerer’s reign of terror is ended.”
“Hypothetically, if it was intelligent, wouldn’t it be amiss to slaughter it without giving it a chance to defend itself?”
“It’s… within the realm of possibility.”  He looked back at Wiggin.  “Don’t give her my rates.  But do tell her where to find me; I’ll open the doors for her.”
For his part, John was dressed as an old beggar, leaning heavily on a cane, an eye patch over one eye and his hair covered by a snowy white wig. His upper lip sported a mustache bushy enough to make the manliest of walruses proud. They made an odd duo, but John had insisted on the outlandish after seeing Sherlock's skill with disguises, and, besides, passerby were dissuaded from staring by John's tendency to limp over to any that stood still long enough and begin telling them stories about the war, in what he imagined to be an appropriately gruff voice.
John paused, fascinated, wondering if he should introduce himself, but before he could decide, the man straightened up and turned around.
“Thanks, mum,” he said, and winked.  The Queen turned an interesting shade of puce, and John left as quickly as his legs and cane allowed.
Then, one day, the sorcerer would appear.  Tall, slender, and clad all in black, his cape billowed behind him like the wings of a bat, and his collars were high enough to reach his jawline.  His skin was sallow, unnaturally dark.  And, as if that wasn’t enough, he wore a cap with
“How strange,” he mused.  “Typically the frogs native to this region are smaller in size.  And I’ve never seen one so… friendly… before.”
The minutes before he managed to reach Sherlock’s bedchamber were the longest of John’s life.  Some dim part of his mind registered that he remembered clearly which chamber was Sherlock’s, but he ignored it, sprinting to where Sherlock lay still under a pile of blankets, skin pale; keen, intelligent eyes closed, never to look upon John again.
John frowned.  “Why would a doctor want to kill pain?  Pain is the only way we can figure out what’s going on with a patient.”
“Yes, yes,” said Sherlock impatiently.  “You’ve snatched me from the jaws of death and now I’m fine.  It’s too much to hope that this would be the point in the narrative where you come to your senses and kiss me, so why don’t we get back to healing the rest of the invalids?”  His expression was firm, brooking no argument.
John left the room, went down a long hallway, turned another corner, and thought he heard a faint noise.  A light wooden door opened onto a spiral staircase, some ambient light filtering out from below.  He went downstairs and found himself in some rather dismal cellars, torches flickering in their sconces.  A faint thudding noise grew louder.  Following the noise, John eventually found himself in what could only be the dungeons.  A table covered with a bloodstained white cloth was at the far end, a man bending over a cadaver with an open chest wound.
“She’s from my homeland,” he explained.  “Came here a few years ago, aboard another ship.  Wiggin told me – apparently she tried to squeeze him for my rates after hearing that I had a certain amount of influence.  Allegedly my country has managed to find a cure for what we considered terminal patients.  I’m” – he squeezed his eyes shut, as if the thought caused him physical pain – “I’m asking her for advice,” he finished.
Mike smiled softly, this was a safe topic at least.  “Teaching now,” he replied, fingers gliding through Asta’s fur.  Kato was very still, perched delicately on the back of the park bench, eyes wide as he took in their surroundings.  “Bright young things, like we used to be.  God I hate them!”
An elder man near the back stood and Donovan acknowledged him with a nod.  “Is there any chance that these are murders?  And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?”
Harriett’s expression clearly stated that she was not impressed, but her attention was quickly pulled away as Titus yanked at her hair.  “Harry, Harry look,” the Macaque pointed at the baby.
“Well, apparently you can,” Lestrade argued back, teeth grinding as Danae swiveled her attention, ears upright and poised as she stared down the woman’s small magpie daemon.  The reporter retook her seat and said not another word.
Turning back to the stunned pair, Sherlock self-righteously leaned against the door.  “The names Sherlock Holmes and Atalanta, and the address is 221 B Baker Street,” winking at them as he bid Mike goodbye and let the door click shut behind him, chuckling softly as Atalanta pranced beside him.  He had the feeling that this was the start of something amazing.
The ex-army doctor pulled a mobile out of his back pocket, holding it out to him.  “Er, here…use mine.”
He gained a lot of attention in class when it was discovered that he had settled.  The children’s dæmons fawned over his exotic and cute form.  Kato was polite, but he did not appreciate the attention.
“Listen,” Molly began as he grabbed his coat and his daemon hopped off the table to follow him.  “I was wondering…maybe later, when your finished-”
One day slid into the next, Bobby and Harriett waiting by the phone of their condo as they waited for news.  One week slid into two as they packed Katelyn’s things to be shipped back home, the condo quiet as the television drowned out the silence left in her wake.  One month slid into the next when the phone finally rang and Bobby wept in joy for the first time.
In most of their games, Marah would take on smaller forms to be able to fit in pockets and tiny spaces.  Normally she would take on the form of a mouse or gerbil, but sometimes she would be more creative.  One of her favorites was a Sugar Glider, but Bobby never liked anyone to see her in such a form.  It was ‘too cute and girly’ he told her.  But secretly he loved her more when she took the shapes of cute animals, and though they both knew it, neither was willing to admit.  Other times she would be big and fierce as they play fought with the neighbors.
Katelyn’s water broke in October exactly on the day they were expecting, and Bobby packed up his wife and daughter into the truck and drove to the hospital.  John Hamish Watson was born right on time, with little fuss and no drama at all.  It was rather unremarkable, but Katelyn glowed all the same as she presented her husband with their first born son.
Kato settled when they were ten and no one inside the family was surprised that he took the form of a predator.  They were mostly surprised that it was not a dog or anything in the canine family.  Instead he took the form of a feline.  The only thing that startled Bobby and Marah was that it was such a small feline.
Molly felt a flutter in her stomach as Sherlock approached the body bag on the examination table.  Atalanta sat regally at the foot of the table, seemingly disinterested as her human opened the bag and began studying the body.  Nero sighed quietly in her ear and Molly silently shared his sentiments.
Taking a sip of the rather delicious coffee, Mike let his eyes discreetly slide over to his companion.  John looked thinner than when he had last seen him, corners of his mouth drawn down and eyes pinched as if he was weary.  Hair shorter, cut in a militaristic fashion, tan from being overseas, and a cane from being shot.
Their great aunt Judith called it post-traumatic stress disorder.  With a minor in child psychology, she visited them often throughout the following years keeping the whole incident within the family in order to leave them their privacy.  She told Bobby that one day it would get better.  John would work through it, kids always bounced back, he just needed time.  And it did get better to an extent.
A camera flash went off as the reporters murmured quietly together, their daemons weaving together as they exchanged pleasantries and theories.  Clearing her throat Detective Sergeant Donovan addressed the group while her European Hare daemon paced under the table.  “The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport, was found late last night on a building site in Greater London.  Preliminary investigations suggest that this was a suicide.
Once, on a rainy day after a few too many glasses of Syrah, she had confronted Mycroft about Atalanta’s standoffish behavior.  Mycroft and Erimentha had been home for the summer and the house was tense as Sherlock sulked and threw insults at his older brother.  Her eldest son just blinked owlishly at her as Erimentha perched on his shoulder, head turned and eyes trained out the window, disinterested.  It was then that she realized the raven was much the same as she had never let Lysander close either and did not let other dæmons approach her and she approached no dæmons, Atalanta excluded.
Greg shuffled his papers around, briefly wishing he could have had a set speech like Donovan.  “Well, they all took the same poison.  Um…they were all found in places they had no reason to be.  None of them showed prior indication of-”
