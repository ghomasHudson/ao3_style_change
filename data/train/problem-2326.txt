“But not nearly as badly as it was earlier.  It’s a short drive to my brother’s.”
“Please don’t go, Papa!” Bunny cried, and he knew he wasn’t being fair to his Papa, that it wasn’t Papa’s fault there were bad men and he had to go to work, but he couldn’t help it.  He needed him.
John knew it was useless to attempt to restrain Sherlock at the moment.  All he could do was watch and ensure the man didn't harm himself.  Sherlock kicked or pulled apart each puzzle in turn, growling and muttering to himself about lost pieces and ruined pictures.  When the puzzles were nothing more than scattered pieces strewn about on the floor, he lost some of the fight, and slumped onto the carpet, dropping his head into his hands.  He began to cry.
“I don’t want to wear underwear, anymore,” Bunny said. “At least not for a little while.”
"You know the rules," Mycroft had reminded.  "An accident means a pull-up for the rest of the day."  It was a rule set in place for both John and Sherlock, one that John had agreed to during one of his chats with Mycroft.
Bunny yawned.  He let himself go limp as he was carried to the master bedroom and placed beside a sprawled-out Sherlock, who was twisted up in the sheets.  Mycroft settled Sherlock back into a more comfortable position, then straightened and re-tucked the sheet around both boys.
Greg found Mycroft in his office, absorbed with e-mails.  Earlier in their relationship, Greg would have been hurt when he came across what he perceived to be Mycroft choosing work over spending time with him.  But he now understood Mycroft wasn’t rushing to his office out of a preference for being away from others; work was simply preferable to dealing with any insecurities or emotional quandaries he preferred not acknowledge.  Yanking off the Santa hat he’d sported for the kids, Greg poked his head into the office.
“Maybe, Daddy,” John said at last.  “Maybe I can try like a big boy.”
“Are you ready to tell me what’s been on your mind, today?” Mycroft asked.
Greg yawned and forced himself awake, wanting to clean up in order to keep the mattress from any damage.  He reached across the bed to brush the hair back from John’s forehead, wanting to wake the sleeping boy gently.
Sherlock shuffled in to drop off the bag Mycroft had packed and then shuffled back out to the hallway.
“I came to find you because dinner’s ready,” he said, breaking from the reverie.  “Think you can make it through?  I promise we can beg off right after.  Head to my brother’s where there’s a bit more peace and quiet.”
“Angle of the bruise on your cheek,” Sherlock said with pompous indifference.
Sherlock snuggled closer into John’s side, suddenly wide-eyed at the prospect of storytelling.
“Sherlock, what did you mean when you said you didn’t like Bunny when she wasn’t “normal”? John asked.
Bunny knew Daddy was right, had long since come to understand that Sherlock’s outbursts were more often than not spurred on not by his feelings towards others but by his doubts concerning himself.  Bunny had acted similarly not long ago, mistreating Sherlock and acting out against Daddy because she had not been able to tell them she wanted to be a girl.   If Sherlock was mean to Bunny, it was likely only because he, too, had been dealing with confusing, difficult thoughts.
Mycroft closed the car door and left for the service station.  Sherlock snatched up the stuffed alligator and hugged it to his chest as he reached to feel the pull-up between his legs.  Mycroft didn’t understand.  It wasn’t that Sherlock wanted to wet himself, exactly.  It was just that his filling bladder and the possibility for an accident was helping him feel vulnerable and needy, helping him feel younger.  Kids got caught in situations like this, desperate and afraid to go use the loo.  The pull-up around his waist was suddenly more present, another reminder that he could sink down and still be safe.
“No,” Mycroft said.  “I’m not doing all of the work for you.  Come here.”
“I think I had an accident.”
Sherlock shrugged, face illuminated by the bluish glow of the computer in the otherwise dark room.
There was a comfort in having gained the lay of the land at Greg’s parent’s house; he knew where the bathrooms were and how to find quiet places for himself, and Greg’s mother had seen him verging on small and hadn’t batted an eye.  The smaller part of John’s mind was nervous about going to a new place so late at night, particularly given that he wasn’t exactly feeling the sure-footed adult at the moment.
“John, I--”
He turned back to Sherlock, who clearly wasn’t currently able to follow Bunny’s example by cleaning his own teeth.  Greg tapped the bulb of the boy’s pacifier gently, and Sherlock, after whining in the back of his throat, released it from his lips.  Greg slipped the pacifier into his pocket, then opened his own mouth wide to show Sherlock he should do the same.  The boy obeyed, and Greg stood close to brush Sherlock’s teeth, beginning with the kid's bottom molars.
“John?” Mycroft prompted.
“You didn’t have to come,” he said, voice muffled against Greg’s chest.
When he finished, he resumed sucking on his hot cocoa, the sippy-cup warm in his hand just as the pee was warm in his undies, and he waited for Daddy to discover what he had done, smiling as he imagined how close he was to Daddy’s soothing and cuddling.
It was the type of phrase which, coming from Mycroft and coupled with the fact that the man had gotten fewer than five hours of sleep the night before, had the effect of settling John just enough into the pretense of headspace to calm his harried mind and allow him to shift into sleep.
"I think the likelihood of that is fairly high, kiddo," Mycroft said, smiling at Sherlock as he glanced at him through the rear-view mirror.
“I didn’t sleep that entire night,” he said, placing his tea cup and saucer on the table beside him.  “It’s always worried me when I don’t know that you’re okay.”
“Do you need to age up so we can talk about this?” Mycroft asked.
“Do you have to piss?” Sherlock asked, still rolling his hips.
“Zoo,” John had said with a quiet determination.  “I want to see the zoo ducks.”
Mycroft nodded, finishing his cup of tea and pouring himself and John another glass.  John took the sippy cup, unscrewed the nozzled top, and drank the orange juice from the cup.
“Not at all,” Mycroft said as he pulled away to begin unbuttoning Greg’s jeans, but the quickness of his movements said otherwise.
The tense anxiety John had been holding in his shoulders seemed to fall away, and he leaned into Mycroft for a hug before sitting up and looking nervous again.
“Come on, Sherlock,” Mycroft said after they had stood in silence for far longer than was comfortable.  Sherlock, fully regressed once more, had begun plucking the wet fabric at his crotch.  “Let’s get you cleaned up and into some training pants.”
It was Mycroft who gave in, impatient and unable to go a moment longer without yanking Greg’s boxer briefs down his legs.  His arousal didn’t stop him from teasing Greg a bit about the precum stain at the crotch, however, and Greg found himself suddenly pink-cheeked, nevermind the fact that Mycroft’s boxers were likely in the same state.  It had been over two weeks since they’d been able to coordinate time for sex.
“We’re not debating, Bun.  It’s just for in case,” he said.  “Even big boys need protection just in case sometimes.”
“I never knew,” John said, unsure which of the many details he was referring to, but Mycroft only nodded.
“Listen to me, baby,” Mycroft said with a sigh.  “This is important for you to hear.  Daddy hasn’t always been as accepting of your feelings as he should have been, sweetheart.  I need you to know that that’s Daddy’s problem, not yours.  Even your Daddy isn’t always right, and he was wrong to question you when you first told Papa what you needed.  Do you understand?”
Lestrade did not seem taken aback.  In fact, he smiled and nodded.  Perhaps another scenario Mycroft had pre-empted by explaining to Greg that it might be something John would need?
“You were worried about me?” he asked, eyebrows furrowed.
to click a certain button of appreciation <3.  A new one-shot should hopefully be posted there in the next few days.
"Mycroft said he was okay with it, that we didn't need to discuss unless I wanted to.  But he said we needed to be careful to tell you at the right time."
“You can’t just let the kid be?” He asked, and Mycroft glanced at a worried Sherlock.
If John weren’t slipping so quickly--damnit, Mycroft had been right to call in reinforcements--he may have pushed the issue further, may have questioned just why Lestrade didn’t mind caring for him, but he knew those were only his hang-ups.  Even if Mycroft hadn’t been upfront with the boys about his on-again-off-again relationship with Lestrade, John and Sherlock had been seeing the signs for months, now.  There was a reason Mycroft had invited Greg into the ageplaying that Sherlock and John participated in.  It would have been just as easy--if not easier--for Mycroft to simply have hired someone suitable as a babysitter who would be paid an exorbitant amount of money not to say anything.  But it was Greg who became the boys’ secondary caregiver.  John had begun his age play relationship with Sherlock as his caretaker, and so he knew very well that there was a release in caretaking the same way there was a release in ageplaying, that Mycroft and Lestrade happened to be primarily caretakers while Sherlock happened to primarily need caring for.  John was a mix of the two, but right now even he could see that he needed someone to look after him.
“Okay, okay,” Mycroft said, hefting Sherlock--still bundled in his blanket--up off the couch and into his arms with a groan.  “Let’s get you into some warmer clothes and get you to sleep.”
Mycroft was on his way to Baker Street quickly.  In the car, he set down the bag he’d packed with what he thought may be useful given his assessment of the situation, gave instructions to his driver, then texted Greg to let him know he was on his way to the boys.  Greg was finishing up a late shift and had mentioned that he planned to go to Mycroft’s when he was off work, so Mycroft didn’t want him to be caught locked out if he arrived while he was away.  It really was about time he gave Greg a key to his place.
“I wonder if the kid needs to learn to show his anger a bit more while in headspace,” Greg said after a time, easing them out of a comfortable silence.
It was a relief when presents had been opened and the Christmas lunch plates had been cleared away.  Their parents were reluctant, but Mycroft managed to usher Sherlock into the car earlier than expected with half-true excuses about work obligations.
Bunny glanced up hesitantly, then shrugged.
Sherlock stilled.  He didn’t need to pee.  His bladder had been emptied not long before lunch, and if he let Papa take him to the bathroom he would likely be suspicious when Sherlock wouldn’t be able to go.  Even if Papa didn’t question his empty bladder, Sherlock was all too aware of the slight bulk of the pull-up between his legs.  Papa was sure to see, and the fact that Sherlock had willingly slipped one on would likely bring up questions that he was not prepared to answer.  He wasn’t even sure if pull-ups were allowed, anymore, given that they were potty training.  What if he'd gotten himself into even more trouble by putting one on?
They shared a look of surprise before Mycroft stepped farther down the hallway to peer into Sherlock’s room.  The boy was still asleep, cuddling his plush dinosaur.  Mycroft pulled the bedroom door closed to keep the carried noise of John’s concerned mumblings from waking his brother.
There's good news in that the next chapter is almost fully completed, so I promise it will not be quite so long before I get you another update--my plan currently is to have that one posted by this upcoming Wednesday.
“I’m sorry none of your nightgowns are clean,” Daddy said, voice gentle as he tugged the sleeve of the lion pajamas he had dressed Bunny in further down her wrist.  He had been worried that Bunny would catch even more of a cold after sitting downstairs for so long in wet underwear, so had insisted on long sleeves and pants.  “When you’re feeling better, Papa and I will take you to pick out some new clothes.  Would you like that?”
Sherlock shrugged and pushed his way past Mycroft out of the bathroom.  Mycroft thought he could feel John almost imperceptibly nod at the suggestion that they would try after dinner, which was a relief.
Thanks for your kind words and support, loves!  I'm so pleased to see that you enjoyed the first chapter, and it's great to be back writing for all of you again.  Thanks also for those of you who sent in requests--it's always fun to be able to incorporate new ideas and perspectives, so keep them coming!
“They’ve never separated us before,” he said, eyebrows furrowed as he began sorting through what John knew would be the multiple possibilities for such behavior swirling in his mind.  "And it was only once you’d fully expressed your desire to be labeled female that Mycroft became concerned.  He hasn’t felt the need to bar me from seeing you before this point, even when you were dressed in a nightgown or playing with paper dolls.”
She grabbed Sherlock by the wrist and dragged him into the living room, and he was stumbling after her almost before he realized she was leading him away from the kitchen.
Sherlock thought for a moment, then shrugged his agreement.  He didn’t like having to share Mycroft, but in reality he’d already been sharing him with the Bunny for some time now.  Besides, it was clear Bunny needed Mycroft, and that wasn't going to change just because Sherlock didn't like it.  What did it really matter what Bunny called Mycroft?
Bunny looked distressed for a moment, but, eventually, he seemed to resign himself to his fate.  He sighed, then nodded.
“I know, honey bun,” Mycroft said, reaching forward to cup a hand around Bunny’s cheek.  “I know.”
“That’s lovely,” Sherlock said, busy with his own cock, which he rutted against John’s hip furiously before snatching his fingers from where they had been pressing along John’s groin and shoving them into his own pajama trousers.  “Piss your pants for me, love.”
“Not resentful, no,” Sherlock said at last.  And then, after a long enough time had passed that both men had finished their pints and John felt his boyfriend was done with the strain of conversation, Sherlock spoke again.
And, when he had finished, when he sat staring down at the mess he had made of himself and the carseat, when he realized he’d just had an accident like a bad boy and that Mycroft and Uncle Greg would be upset with him and that Bunny--who had gone with Uncle Greg to use the loo like a big boy--would see that he really wasn’t anything more than a wet-pants baby, when, more than anything, he realized with relief that he was finally in a young headspace, he began to cry.
Sherlock was pulled from a rather sleepy state by Mycroft’s question.  He glanced out the window to see that a light snow had begun to fall.  The parking lot was beginning to be coated with a light whiteness.  It made everything feel somehow cozier, and his mind felt blissfully quiet.  Sherlock sniffled and nodded, sitting up to let Mycroft free.
“I wasn’t thinking,” Greg attempted, rubbing a hand along the back of his neck.  “I’m sorry, Myc.  I messed up.  He aged up almost immediately, and he’s been in his room ever since.”
“John?”
“‘Hell’ isn’t a swear word, Mycroft,” Sherlock argued.  “I only said three swear words.  So, fifteen.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft warned.
“I’d like to go talk to him,” he said, and despite the fact that he was dressed in an oversized jumper and silver-star leggings covering a pull-up, he was fully adult.
Greg could not help but ruffle Bunny’s hair when he smiled wide and nodded emphatically; John looked too cute when he wanted to please.
Hi, loves!  Boy did Bunny want to be angsty in this chapter! But, let's be honest--he is dealing with some pretty heavy identity questions right now!  Many of you will be happy to see toddler/baby Sherlock in this chapter, but this really is Bunny's chapter, so even though it's pretty long I couldn't focus on our little consulting detective too too much.
Sherlock grabbed a flowered dress and pressed it into Bunny’s lap.
He cocooned himself further into the quilt when Mycroft--dishes completed--came into the living room.  He was carrying Sherlock’s stuffed dinosaur, Dimitri, which he placed on the couch cushion beside Sherlock.
Mycroft carried the boy back towards the bed, settling him and then climbing in beside him.  Sherlock absent-mindedly fiddled with the bottom hem of Mycroft’s t-shirt.
“I didn’t wet the pull-up,” John said quietly into his cup of tea before taking a sip to keep his attention anywhere except on Mycroft.
Sherlock turned to glare at him.
“I know, bud,” he said.  “Your pants must be cold and icky, huh?  Let’s go take care of that.”
“Fuck off, Mycroft,” John spat.
“Bun? It’s Daddy,” Mycroft called.  “Can I come in?”
“I’ve been working on and revising that plan for years,” Mycroft said, pulling Greg close.  “The kid can’t help the negative thoughts any more than we can help our own.  All we can do is prove to him we’re there for him, something I quite egregiously failed to do today.”
Bunny was skipping into the kitchen a moment later, followed closely by Papa, who crossed to Mycroft with a glance that Sherlock would have been able to read had he been in an older headspace.  At the moment, he didn’t have much interest in interpreting the silent conversations Papa and Mycroft could have over his and Bunny’s heads, and instead held up his half-colored planet towards Bunny, who was climbing onto his knees in the chair beside him.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry," he murmured.
John felt a stab of nervousness as he watched a look pass between Uncle Greg and his Daddy.  John needed Mycroft to put him to bed and to keep away the monsters.  He felt tears begin to fill his eyes as he thought about being left alone in the scary room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock was naked from the waist down and over Mycroft’s lap a moment later, writhing but content as he was spanked.  It was a rather long spanking, Sherlock’s bare bum reddening as Mycroft hit him again and again, but Mycroft knew it was what Sherlock needed, in fact what he was desperate for.  The boy, yelling through his snivelling, was being punished for the lies of the day before and the cheekiness of the morning’s antics, yes, but he was also being shown the affirmation of Mycroft’s care for him.  Mycroft had him in-hand, and Sherlock could do nothing but trust that Mycroft--steadfast, intuitive, big brother Mycroft--knew just what he needed.
His mum nodded as she turned to close the oven door before adjusting the temperature.
“Three more big bites,” he said, and Bunny could tell he was attempting to be encouraging, that he was starting to suspect Bunny's concern.  “Then you can show Sherlock your new toys before naptime.”
I hope I'll be able to get another chapter up within a week--I'm going to do my best to stick to that schedule if at all posssible!  I will respond to the comments from last chapter ASAP, but don't have time now (need to sleep!).  Let me just say that you're all amazing and your encouragement means the world to me--thank you for commenting!
Sherlock thrashed against John’s body and stood up to pull himself out of the smaller man’s tight embrace.  He kicked out at a clump of pieces and continued to yell.
It was the growling of John’s stomach that eventually interrupted their found serenity.  John sat up in surprise after his stomach had growled loudly, and Greg could not help but laugh gently at the boy’s expression.  John was a bit bashful, but he laughed as well, and when Greg tickled his tummy, John laughed louder.
“Why is he sleeping in your bed?” Sherlock asked, sitting up, perhaps ready to begin thinking a bit more rationally about the situation.
“You’re a military man with an inclination for violence and danger, a desperate desire to prove himself worthy at every turn, and a track record of dating emotionally distant men,” Sherlock said.  “Of course you have father issues.”
Sherlock shook his head.
“Please,” Sherlock begged.
“Fine,”John said. And when the others looked at him with surprise or confusion or a mixture of both, he cleared his throat and shrugged it off.  “If it’ll keep me from sitting next to a puddle of urine halfway through the car ride,” he joked, “it’ll be worth it.”
He peed until he was empty, for once relaxing himself as he wet instead of tensing in an attempt to stop.  It felt good to pee himself right where he sat, to soil his nightshirt and his new ladybug undies and his Daddy’s rug.  The rug was a dark pattern, so the wetness blended in, but if he looked closely Bunny could see the spreading outline of the liquid pooling beneath him.
“I felt mad,” Sherlock said, starting over.  “I felt mad because you got to be a princess and I...I wanted to be littler, again.”
“Does it scare you?” Greg asked.  “Having them know?”
And then Daddy was standing up from the couch and walking out of the dark, wood-panelled living room.  He began pacing back and forth in the hallway, back straight and head tilted towards the ceiling.  It was clear Daddy was frustrated.  Bunny knew that he had been giving them a bit of leniency because they were sick, but that he was not going to stand for an entire day of the type of carrying-on Bunny and Sherlock had been participating in to that point.
“That’s a good boy,” Mycroft said as John helped him clean up his accident.  “It’ll be good as new when we’re all finished.”
Greg turned down the music on the radio, knowing the boy would be asleep in moments.  He was grateful, knowing John hadn’t slept well the night before.  They really needed to get the kids back into a routine, and Greg wished not for the first time that their schedules would allow for set, planned ageplay sessions.  It was when the boys had gone far too long without the emotional release that they ran into trouble.  Maybe if he'd insisted John take some time out to be Bunny, the man wouldn't have gotten into a fist fight with Greg's primary crime scene technician in a dingy motel room.
Had Sherlock come home having wet his pants in public, he would have been punished severely--time-out and a stern talking to, relegated to pull-ups for the rest of the day and possibly even spanked.  John had received none of that.  He had been comforted and changed into fresh Harry Potter underwear after his bath, had been given hugs and been allowed to pick the movie they watched.
“Too bad,” Sherlock said, shrugging.  “You’re my prisoner.  So you have to do what I say.”
There was little Mycroft could do to comfort the boy when he was rejecting his attention.  It was clear the boy was overly sensitive today, however, so Mycroft knew he would need to be careful when choosing any babyish nicknames throughout the rest of the day.  He proceeded with as much patience as he could muster.
Sherlock’s cock twitched at the admission, and he glanced towards John with a mischievous smirk.  John’s face was flushed from the kissing or the embarrassment, and Sherlock could feel the man’s lower body twitching; it was clear John was rather desperate.  It was also clear from the way that John was hardening beneath his hand and showing no signs of immediately leaving the bed, that he wasn’t unhappy about the weight in his bladder.
Greg had to admit it was a relief when the signs of Sherlock’s self-harm were masked by the brightly colorful children’s plasters; it made the whole ordeal seem a bit less heartbreaking.
Greg smirked back towards Mycroft, catching his eye.  The spark of connection that had come over them as they made out on the couch downstairs earlier that day was still buzzing between them, perhaps even elevated by the way in which Greg had impressed Mycroft by managing to right the afternoon’s wrongs in one fell-swoop.
Sherlock huffed as if John’s words had proven his point, and Mycroft hummed something noncommittal.  The men were both stubborn, but even their adamant proclamations that they would not need a caretaker that evening could not hide from Mycroft the younger selves hovering far closer to the surface than either would like to admit.
“‘Night Mycroft and Papa,” he yawned, and his Mycroft and his Papa told him goodnight before kissing his forehead, checking for monsters, and flicking off the light.
John shook his head as if he could deny it away, but his cheeks were red and the smell of urine which had pulsed into his pants and underwear was sure to have reached Lestrade.
Mycroft sighed.  Here were John’s worries on display. Mycroft wished he could make the man understand that nothing John could do would disappoint him.
His brother took in the information with a quiet hum of acknowledgement, scanning Greg’s face searchingly.
They’d seen each other in wet pants so many times at this point that John had lost count.  Hell, he’d even pissed in Sherlock’s bed this past weekend when he was teetering between headspaces.  But he and Sherlock had never done this before, not in this way.   They had never before used piss play as a prelude to sex, and John was just as nervous as he was aroused, his heart beating in his throat.
He peed strong and fast into his jeans, soaking himself and Sherlock’s thigh, which was still pressed against his crotch.  John’s cheeks blazed, but Sherlock’s pupils were dilated as he leaned forward to kiss John, a hand finding John’s crotch as the final trickles of liquid darkened the fabric of his trousers.
“Uncle Greg thinks I’m a baby,” Bunny sniffled.
“You two talk rationally,” he said before leaving them alone.  He caught Mycroft's eye and a look that Sherlock could not decipher passed between them.  It was clear the men had spoken about Mycroft and Sherlock's impending conversation prior to the present moments.
“See?” Sherlock nearly shouted.  “Told you! I told you!”
“Papa, did you and Daddy have a fight?” she asked, eyes worried.
I may go back and add some transitional exposition throughout this chapter--there are a few moments that seem to me to shift too quickly from one emotion to the other, but I figured you'd all rather have something that needs a bit more work than nothing at all.  Just know that I'll re-read this chapter again in the next few days and will likely edit a bit.
This is another quick update, but I wanted to get it all to you as soon as I could as a thank you for your loveliness.  You're truly all such a great group of kind souls.  I may come back to edit slightly tomorrow, but, for now, enjoy!
John softened his face to let Mycroft know he harbored no hard feelings, and the man smiled slightly until a thought seemed to cross his mind and his face stilled once more.
“I’m sorry you feel that way, kiddo,” he said.  “Did Daddy do something to make you upset?”
But he let Mycroft help him into the now half-full tub, and  Mycroft was pleased to distract the boy with a basket of bath toys while he washed away the tear-streaks from his little bunny’s cheeks.
By the time they were out of the toy section, Greg could see the boy was tiring.  The boy hadn’t finished his breakfast that morning given his trip to time-out and then the rush to get to the store.  It was likely he was hungry for lunch, and getting ready, as had become routine, for his early afternoon nap.  Greg told the kid that they had just one more thing to pick up, and led them to the pharmacy section.
It was nearly September and a month since John and Sherlock had been young for longer than a stolen evening or afternoon at Baker Street.  Even then, it had been little more than the occasional thumb slipped into one mouth or another while they stayed up too late watching telly, the occasional pull-up sleepily yanked on before they fell into bed together, and one overly-dramatic response which almost veered towards temper tantrum.
The Bunny was still tired from the ride, and was being carried by Mycroft into the other children’s room across the hallway, this one decorated in purples and oranges.  Sherlock told Uncle Greg  it was a girl’s room, but Greg shushed him and told him there was no such thing as girl colors or boy colors after he told him to stop jumping on the bed.  Uncle Greg removed Sherlock's baseball cap and brushed the hair from Sherlock’s flushed face--jumping had been hard work--and then helped him unpack his clothes and toys.
“Hey, no tears,” Greg said, attempting to quiet the boy before he woke Sherlock once more.  “Just a little accident.  We’ll get you cleaned up in no time.”
“Bunny was better at coloring and Papa and Bunny laughed at my colors and Daddy and Papa were giving Bunny all the attention and then Bunny got to choose the game and I wanted to,” the boy said in a litany of complaints, his mouth turning down at the corners as he remembered the string of events which had upset him.
Bunny hesitated.
John smiled and, after climbing off the kitchen chair, settled on the floor of the living room to color in his mermaid coloring book.  He had been worried that he and Mycroft had not discussed John’s slip-up the night before when he had called Mycroft “Daddy,” but Mycroft, with one simple sentence labelling himself “Daddy,” had signalled once again that it was all okay.  They would chat about it later, when John was ready.  For now, he could be little while his Daddy took care of him.
“Sherlock, tell me what’s wrong.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, looking smug.
“Buddy, Papa found your wet jeans and undies beneath the guest room bed,” Mycroft said, and suddenly Sherlock was twisting to hide his reddening face in the crook of his brother’s neck, tears again filling his eyes as he choked on a sob.
“I’m a nice girl, Daddy,” he said, as if he were testing out the persona.
After a few moments, the two emerged and Mycroft guided Sherlock by the hand to the boy’s bedroom.  The thunder was striking more frequently, and, between the booms, John heard Mycroft’s attempts to soothe the boy.
Mycroft waited for John to make eye contact once more, raised his eyebrows as if signalling that he expected them to return to the conversation at a later point, and led him out of the guest bedroom.
“Stupid man!” he yelled.
Sherlock allowed himself to be cuddled, pressing his face against Mycroft’s chest as he cried.
Bunny nodded, rubbing tears from his eyes as he sniffled.
It was a memory only just re-emerging.  While his father watched with a mirthless sneer, John had been forced to throw the dolls into the rubbish bin, to watch all week as food scraps and torn junk mail filled the garbage bag they sat at the bottom of.  The whole ordeal had made his parents argue, had made Harry look at him warily.
“How long have you been in a wet pull-up?” Papa asked with concern in his voice, bringing a pink blush to Sherlock’s cheeks.
"Mycroft," John started again, blushing, but then turned to his downtrodden friend, nearly amazed at what was unfolding before him.  “Sherlock, don’t cry, lad.  It’s okay.”
“Go away!” Sherlock called, voice garbled.  “Leave me alone!”
“I have to potty,” John said.  He had said it before his brain had processed, and for a moment he was a bit older, wondering when the last time he had used the term ‘potty’ had been.  It brought a blush to his cheeks, but it also made him feel young and helpless, and that was a good thing.
Luckily the cuts on Sherlock’s hand and wrist from when he had punched through the window had not been deep enough to need stitches, and after a quick clean-up and a few bandages, Sherlock was no longer bleeding into his shirt.  John sat back in the kitchen chair and began packing up the first aid kit they had found beneath the sink in the downstairs bathroom as Sherlock leaned back into a sullen quietude.  John could not help but smile at his boyfriend’s stubborn lack of foresight when, in trying to cross his arms in a show of stubbornness, he pressed his injured hand beneath his arm and was left swearing under his breath.  It was a relief to be next to Sherlock again, to have eyes on him and to see him in his sights.
“I’m fine, Mycroft,” he said, voice harsh before he seemed to remember that he had been the one to ask Mycroft to come in the first place.  He took a breath.
Mycroft had warned him, when John first admitted to his desire to try ageplaying alongside Sherlock as something other than a caretaker.  He had explained that ageplay could lead to recollections of old memories, that its success as a coping mechanism was not linked solely to the comfort it provided.  John had done a fair amount of reading up on the subject himself, had understood why it was important for Mycroft to mention the potential side effects and emotional consequences.  But he had thought himself somehow immune.
“And if not,” Papa said, raising his voice a bit over Bunny’s excited mumblings, “That’s okay, too.  We can try again next time.”
Sherlock blinked a bit, thinking, before he gave a sudden “oh,” and kept talking.
This was a sentiment Sherlock had expressed before, one Mycroft had known would re-emerge; he was prepared.  He took hold of Sherlock’s shoulders and helped the boy to sit up.  He needed the boy’s full attention, and that required eye contact.
“Hang on, big boy,” Mycroft said, standing back to supervise.  “Let’s get you into a pull-up before you get dressed.”
“Another time, buddy,” Mycroft said, voice low, speaking into Sherlock’s hairline, “It’s time for all good little boys to get some sleep.”
“Everything alright, Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, running a washcloth along Bunny’s arms.
“But there’s something more,” Mycroft said, pushing the conversation in the direction he knew it needed to go for John to truly get past his conflicted state.  “Those feelings alone wouldn’t cause you the level of guilt you’re struggling with, guilt you’ve been struggling with since the day at the zoo.”
It had been Bunny who ran from the kitchen table to cry into his pillow and suck his thumb, but it was John who, after jerking awake and climbing out of bed to dress himself, was currently pacing back and forth between the bedroom windows.  John’s overwrought mind had just been too much for the little one to handle, and he needed a few moments to process in his adult mindset.
“Coming!” Sherlock called when the juice box was collapsed in on itself, empty.
“There is one more thing about this past weekend we haven’t properly discussed,” he said, and John turned to face him, attempting to think through what he may have missed.
Mycroft could see the relief on Greg’s face.
, and Greg paused.  Bunny had openly expressed his preference for what were often coded as feminine toys and pajamas, but he had never before suggested that he was anything other than Mycroft and Greg's little boy.  Greg would be happy to have Bunny be their little girl if that was what he wanted.  In fact, it was something Greg had suspected they may come to as Bunny became more and more comfortable expressing himself.  But Greg had not wanted to initiate feminine pronouns without letting Bunny request them, and he had never before brought up the subject.
“Alright, boys, let’s get Bunny out of the tub so we can get you both some dinner,” Mycroft said, guiding Sherlock to stand up from his place outside of the tub.  “Uncle Greg has a surprise for you both before bed if you’re good.”
Mycroft sighed, took a long gulp to finish off his tea.  “It’s generally part of the pattern,” was all he said.  He rose from the table and stretched.
But the flat was not silent.  As John shrugged off his jacket and turned to head upstairs to his bedroom, he distinctly heard the cling of a spoon in a teacup.  He paused, one foot on the staircase, and sighed.
“Yeah?”
Mycroft sounded concerned when he next spoke.  “For what, love?”
Sherlock had shrugged, but Mycroft’s words had in fact calmed him.  He’d been younger around Mycroft in the past--hell, he’d been just about every age around Mycroft--but never before when he was around Bunny or Uncle Greg.  He had been a bit worried they’d think of him differently if he let himself slip.  His mind was struggling to stay in his big kid mindset out of fear that they would judge him.  But Mycroft had been smiling at him as if everything would be okay, and for once Sherlock felt that, just maybe, he didn’t have to fight so hard.
It wasn’t what he’d expected.  He was used to drastic action being taken when there were suspicions he’d hurt himself.  He was used to loud voices making demands and grasping hands pulling him one way or another.  He was used to being made to feel inconsequential and naughty.
“Go use the potty and then come right back and we’ll change your pull-up.  Don’t forget to wash your hands.  I’ll be here if you need anything.  You can leave the door open, if you’d like.”
He hadn’t been paying close enough attention to his bladder, too wrapped up in his own bad feelings about the morning.  He’d grown aware of the need to pee only when Mycroft sat him down with Bunny before the telly and put on the babyish kids’ show, but, even then, he hesitated.  He regretted putting the pull-up on after his accident because it would bring attention to him if it were found, but at the same time, as he rocked a bit back and forth on the couch cushions, he was glad for the safety of it, the chance it gave him to ignore his bladder and the reminders of his accident that morning just a bit longer.  But then Bunny had started pestering him, insisting that Sherlock should use the potty like a big boy, and Sherlock had gotten upset, and lashed out.
John could not help but squirm and laugh as Sherlock tickled, cheeks burning red as he imagined how ridiculous he must look, a grown man dissolving into giggles.  He pushed against Sherlock’s chest, but the man’s arms were far longer than John’s, and Sherlock was too dead-set on accomplishing his goal.
“Want to tell me what’s been going on in that mind of yours?” he asked.
He sat up a moment later.
“Daddy, too.  I want you to forget what he may have said or how he behaved before, princess.  Daddy was telling you the truth today when he said he supports you just as you are.  It’s only fair of us to take him at his word.  Okay?”
“You’re alright,” he said, grasping John by both shoulders to stabilize him.  “Breathe.  You’re safe.”
John ate voraciously, finally hungry again after the stress of the morning.  He and Sherlock were both slipping back down in headspace; John had been glad to find Sherlock already aged down when he and Uncle Greg had come down for lunch.  John was not young enough to want Mycroft to feed him, but he could feel himself a bit desperate for the man’s attention after denying himself his Daddy’s care for the sake of Sherlock all morning.  He was sitting as close to him as he could while still staying put in his own chair.
He could sense that Sherlock was repeating apologies because he was waiting to be told he was forgiven, waiting to be assured that it would all be forgotten.  But Sherlock needed to understand that harming himself was not an acceptable coping mechanism.  Greg and Mycroft had long ago spoken about the response Sherlock needed: comfort and assurance without false promises or indulgence.
On a whim, he made sure the sound was turned off on his phone and took a picture of the boy, all flushed cheeks and long lashes as he slumbered with his thumb in his mouth.  He sent the image off to Greg, knowing the man would be pleased to wake up to a reminder of Sherlock at his sweetest--especially if, as Mycroft expected, Sherlock was an over-tired and misbehaving mess the next day.
“You really are a baby,” Sherlock said, but he threw back a corner of the blankets and shifted over to make room for Bunny on the bed.  Bunny was grateful that thunderstorms, despite being easily scientifically explained, weren’t exactly little Sherlock’s favorite thing, either.
It was morning when he next woke, and when he blinked open his eyes he was face to face with his Daddy.
“You mean to tell me, Dr. Watson, that you’ve never seen my brother wet himself before?  It’s really quite a frequent event, all told.”
“Come ‘ere, little pirate,” Uncle Greg said when he got a good look at Sherlock, who was by now a mess of tears and snot as well as urine.  He held out his arms and Sherlock crawled over to him, allowing himself to be hugged, just wanting the comfort.
Greg smiled sideways at the yawn before reaching for the window scraper in the footwell opposite Bunny.  Closing Bunny in while the car warmed up, Greg began doing away with the snow that had accumulated in a blanket over the windshield and rear windows.
“Barely noticeable,” John shrugged, reaching with his fingers to rub at his cheekbone with a wince, as if it were possible to make the yellowing skin disappear.
Bunny could not help but raise a hand to her mouth, feeling the need for the comfort of her thumb, but Papa guided her hand back down to her lap, gently prompting her to speak up regarding what was on her mind.
It was clearly not a coincidence that this memory was returning after the day he'd spent.  His therapist, if he told her the story, would point to the incident as the impetus for his obsession with presenting overly masculine, the underlying cause of the years before Sherlock, when he had staunchly denied his bisexuality.  Mycroft and Sherlock would be sure to categorize the memory as the reason John’s little self was drawn to that which was coded feminine, would explain that his subconscious was using littlespace as a way to re-write a history he’d rather forget.  Greg’s reaction would be far less intellectual; he would fume and rant, detailing the ways in which he’d like to bring the bloke back from the dead in order to kill him himself.
Sherlock knew that Papa was bending down next to him.  The man’s closeness, his quietness, made him want to cry.  Papa was being so nice, using his gentlest voice and making sure he was speaking softly so the others wouldn’t hear while anticipating the fact that Sherlock did not want to be touched at the moment.  He lifted his head only to cast his eyes down to Papa’s shoes.
“Mycroft,” Greg said, taking the stool next to the man before turning to face him.  “I know you and Sherlock had a rough few days, and I know the holidays don’t always bring out the best in everyone.  But there’s something to be said for the routine of it all, for making time to appreciate loved ones.”
When the kid was settled in a dry pull-up and the wet clothing had been tossed into the hamper beside the downstairs washer and dryer, Greg reached for the clothing options he’d brought.  He was unsure whether Bunny was currently in a boyish mindset or if he felt like a girl, and he hadn’t wanted to box him into any one identity, so he had brought multiple items of clothing for the Bunny to pick through.
John opened his mouth to answer, then realized he would rather not speak, that he would rather let Sherlock do that talking at the moment.  He chewed on the knuckle of his index finger and nodded.
John stood up from the bed with Mycroft’s help, and the wet hem of the nightgown fell to stick to his legs above the knees.  He was too spent to to anything but wait for Mycroft to take charge.
But John did not catch the teasing nature of Mycroft’s question, and his eyes were sincere as he nodded emphatically.
And then it was Mycroft's turn to sigh.  John’s anger was something they'd previously just let run its course, the child-John so rarely succumbing to its vice grip that they'd somehow kept from needing to deal with it while ageplaying.  That said, it was irresponsible of them not to have prepared for the possibility.  John had suffered a PTSD nightmare and a panic attack the night before, had spent the morning struggling against self-disgust, shame, and shifting headspaces.  It was no wonder he’d acted out under pressure.
“Hey there, cutie,” Greg said, voice soft and as warm.  “You doing okay?”
Hi lovelies--You've all been incredibly sweet when leaving comments and kudos--thank you!  I'm going to respond to comments in just a minute, but thought I would go ahead and post a short update in the mean time.  This chapter is basically just fluff and cuteness--hopefully it will make you smile!  Keep sending your ideas and I'll try to fit them in when I can!
Reaching towards John, Sherlock realised her hand was trembling. Her knees shook as well.
- unsurprisingly, but no heavier than an average child her age.”
Tonight, Sherlock will stretch him carefully open and rock into him slowly, whispering endearments and chuckling at John’s impatient murmurs, but this morning is a touch more desperate.
"Gendered personality traits are an alpharchal construct, John, you know this."
“Fucking hell, you
“John.”
“Lunch, for you,” he croaked, his voice rough with emotion and disuse. Sherlock did not respond, but ten minutes later the plate was empty. The silence was crisp in the air as John collected it and an assortment of mugs from around the room. Although they didn't always make small talk, John could usually find something to say. Somehow
“Shut
“You did so well, Sherlock. I hope you enjoyed it all? Come on, beautiful, let go. Come for me.”
“Of course, of course I do, come here, I love you.”
“I lived here eighteen months and you didn’t deduce… Fuck. You didn’t deduce I wanted
Sherlock’s never been modest - not until now, anyway. They’d both wandered the kitchen and living room in a towel or dressing gown before, and yeah, John had been sneaking glances. The last week, though, he’d taken to never leaving bedroom or bathroom without being properly dressed, and for a few days he’d been holding himself rather gingerly.
"I'd very much prefer to be left alone, thanks." A deceptively soft hand catches his, and John glances at a forced grin before tearing his gaze and hand away. He can catch a glimpse of Sherlock weaving towards him, eyes flickering over the two of them at the table. Under the table, John flicks his fingers in their
Sherlock nods stiffly. John pushes himself further forward, off his chair until his knees are braced against the edge of Sherlock’s chair and his hands grip the arms.
They settled into a comfortable silence, both men entertaining the idea of helping the other to the bed upstairs in John’s room and both ultimately deciding they were too comfortable to move.  Mycroft was soon dozing against Greg, the lack of sleep from the night before as well as the bourbon he’d consumed before leaving his flat combining to settle him into a content drowsiness.  Greg had toed off his shoes and kicked his feet up onto the coffee table before them, a solid, steady weight behind Mycroft.
“You’re such a mess," he said, knowing Sherlock was close. “Nearly wet clear through to your pants.”
And, in the quiet of the car and the reminder of his brother’s care, Sherlock gave in.
He tossed it to the man, who slipped it on, and they hurried from the pub, John not caring that his entire backside was very obviously wet, that liquid had even begun trickling down the backs of his thighs.  Sherlock took his hand in his own, and they hurried around the corner back to their apartment.
“I’m sorry it’s been such a hard day,” he said.
“D.I. Lestrade,” he said, distracted by the fact that he’d burned a fingertip on the pan as he slid the omelet onto the plate.  He grimaced and, holding the mobile to his ear with his raised shoulder, ran his fingers under cold tap water.
Sherlock jerked away from Papa and turned to a fresh coloring page with a huff.  He didn’t like the way Papa and Bunny seemed to be in on a joke that Sherlock hadn’t known was coming.  Since when was Bunny better at something than he was?
Mycroft cupped Sherlock’s cheek in praise, and, in a rare show of affection, the boy leaned into his touch.  Sherlock was nothing if not an observer, and Mycroft believed the boy’s observations of Mycroft’s clear affection towards a John who enjoyed receiving praise and love had been doing him some good.  Perhaps Sherlock was learning that it was okay to accept positive attention.
“Exactly, sweetheart,” he said.  “If Bunny wants to be a girl sometimes, she’ll be happiest if she listens to how she feels.  Just like you’ll be happiest if you listen when you feel five, or ten, or two.”
Sherlock wiped at his eyes with the palms of his hands and then hid his face once more against Mycroft’s dress shirt.  He may be small, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t ashamed of the worries circling, worries he’d been struggling against all day.
“That’s better,” he smirked as they kissed.
“If you were planning to punch Anderson, you could have at least done it when I was around to watch” he said, sidestepping any responsibility to answer for his own actions.
"I'm here, little one," Papa said, holding him close as he rocked him were he stood.  "Papa's right here, brave boy."
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes as Mycroft settled the sheets and pulled Sherlock’s plush animals from where they had shifted towards the edge of the bed or onto the floor.  Sherlock took them in his arms.
“Let’s start with this: Are there any of Sherlock’s rules that you dislike, that wouldn’t work for you?”
John was running his hand absently through Sherlock’s hair, and he tilted his chin down to glance at the man pressed against him.
“If you eat your breakfast,” he said, cursing himself for going soft.  “Just don’t tell your Papa.”
After bundling the boy back into his towel to keep him from catching a chill, he ushered him to the master bedroom.  Sherlock’s room was still a mess of broken lamps and light bulbs, of duvets cast off beds and cushions tossed around the room in what Greg assumed had been an earlier fit of Sherlock’s anger.  He would clean up the kid’s room once he’d gotten him settled down for a nap.  For now, he thought it best that Sherlock be taken to a neutral space, away from reminders of the low points of his morning.  He knew there was a clean basket of the boys’ laundry in the master bedroom, which saved him from having to root through Sherlock’s room for clean clothes.
“Unicorn!” she said, unable to express her present joy in a more refined way.  “I can be a unicorn!”
He had been tired even before dinner had begun, needing to be fed because he had almost fallen asleep in his spaghetti.  It had been a long, draining day, and Bunny had been relieved when Uncle Greg had placed him down in the cot next to Sherlock and kissed him goodnight.
Thank you all for your kudos and comments--I apologize for getting behind in responding to them but promise to catch up.  As always, let me know if you have any ideas you'd like me to try to incorporate.  Thank you for reading and supporting.  You're all the best!
The man was sitting cross-legged on the other side of the rug.  Sherlock crawled slowly towards him until he could lay his head on Papa’s knee.  He wasn’t quite ready to show Papa what he’d done, so he remained cocooned in the blanket, but he was glad for the comfort and desperately grateful he was no longer alone.  Papa began to card his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, which made Sherlock cry again.
He hadn’t meant for it to come out as a question rather than a statement, hadn’t meant to sound quite so pleading.  He knew it was the reason Greg was staring at him, the reason he was currently attempting to assess his state of mind.  He looked a bit doubtful, and John cleared his throat.
“Stop it, Papa,” Sherlock said, because he could tell Uncle Greg liked the idea, that he would very much like being Papa.
“How soon we forget who cleaned urine off of the car seat this afternoon,” Greg said, and Mycroft, sighing yet smirking, conceded.
The boy hesitated for a moment, but then nodded, scooting away from his Daddy so they could climb out from beneath the desk.  Mycroft took control when they were out in the open, sitting in the desk chair and bringing the boy close between his legs, where he stripped him of his wet nightshirt and soaked underwear before beginning to wipe him down.
“Everything, okay, boys?” he asked, sitting up and nudging Bunny’s Daddy awake.
After dinner, all of Greg’s nieces and nephews were shouting about opening presents in the family room, and it became clear as gifts were passed out one by one that John and Greg would not be able to leave any time soon.  They would be spending the night with Greg's older brother's family, and they couldn't very well leave before him.
Sherlock let tears well up in his eyes, shifting in place at the uncomfortable bulk of the wet pull-up between his legs.
“I think so,” he said.  “And, Sherlock, you’ll be doing chores to pay for what you ruined.  It’s never okay to destroy others’ things.  Understand?”
“Now, it’s far past all good little boys’ bedtimes," Mycroft said.  "Goodnight, buddy.”
John squealed and raced out of the living room as Mycroft chased him down the hallway.  It would be okay, John thought as he laughed and hid from his smiling daddy.  It would all be alright.
Sherlock had fought headspace with a staunch determination, but once he’d allowed himself the comfort Mycroft was offering, the man had slipped very young, and very quickly.  He had obviously needed to calm his mind as much as possible, shifting down into his youngest self.  It was his hope that the man was still blissfully young and happy, coloring at the kitchen table or playing with his plastic animals and blocks.
“Okay, champ,” Greg said with a smile, closing the medicine cabinet and bending to open the cabinet beneath the sink.  “Give me one second and we’ll get you all sorted.”
Nevermind.  He wiped the saliva onto his pant leg and pushed the pile of crayons towards Bunny, who nodded with an enthusiastic smile.
Greg couldn't bear to see the boy so nervous and afraid.
The kid was wringing the corner of his blanket in his hand, nervously glancing back and forth between the floorboards and Greg.
Bunny felt as if he were
“Shit,” John breathed after a moment, dropping forward to clutch his hands on the back of a spare chair.
“You’ll need to sit with us at the table, at the very least,” he said when he turned back to an impatient Sherlock.
No warnings for this chapter--just fluff and probably some too-sappy cuteness!  Enjoy!
“I don’t know what you think you were pulling in there,” Mycroft said as he reached to pull the seat-belt over Sherlock’s lap and shifted the car into reverse.
“Sher’ock?” John asked around his pacifier.
"But you need to be little perhaps even more than I do."
He knew the boy was desperate for comfort and cuddles, but Mycroft also needed to get straight answers from the little bunny, and he couldn’t risk setting the boy off to crying again.  Although it hadn’t seemed to be the case throughout the day, Bunny generally responded to pragmatism with pragmatism.  Mycroft hoped he was enough himself again to participate in a rational conversation.  He allowed Bunny to rest his head against his thigh, but pressed the boy’s hand down firmly when he tried to put his thumb in his mouth again.
“Bunny?” Sherlock mumbled, somehow making strong on his promise to watch over his little brother despite his sleepiness.
“We don’t have anything on,” Sherlock said.  “And you’re due some time off at the clinic.”
It wasn’t like Bunny to argue, and Sherlock glanced back at Uncle Greg to see how he would react.  Uncle Greg looked more confused than angry.
John obeyed, but Greg was a bit concerned to see blood in the sink mixed in with the toothpaste John had just spat out.
“Love you, Daddy,” Bunny mumbled.
Sherlock would have screamed and argued over those choices, but John responded best to either/or choices and took a moment to decide.  His thumb moved to run against his bottom lip before he placed it into his mouth, where John sucked hard on it.  Mycroft had been working towards introducing John to pacifiers; Mycroft knew he rejected pacifiers right now not out of a lack of interest but out of a fear that, even in headspace, he was too old for them, that others--namely, Sherlock, who took a devilish pleasure in pointing out anything he deemed babyish about John’s behavior--would tease.  John was really a very sensitive little, perhaps more sensitive even than Sherlock, which made Mycroft believe John as an adult was more than likely used to putting on a tough front that hid his insecurities.
“Now would be the time for you to piss yourself, John,” Sherlock breathed when they’d parted for a moment.
After Lestrade left, the boys both settled a bit.  Sherlock’s tears had stopped entirely, and he was content in the corner playing with Greg the alligator.  John continued to cry quietly, tears pulsing down his embarrassed, flushed cheeks.
Mycroft smirked as he walked from the bathroom to find Greg--still in his coat--with an armful of half-naked John.  He could see that Greg was exhausted--he’d been working himself far too hard in order to please a new superior--but, with Bunny in his arms, he could see Greg was at least content, comforted.
"Call Mycroft!"
Bunny whined but reached to grab Willa, and at least his Daddy did not attempt to take her away.
Nothing had gone right today, and his luck hadn’t changed.  He couldn’t win at video games and he couldn’t ask for Papa or Mycroft to come up to the room to help him figure out what was wrong and he couldn’t keep his mind from wandering to the poster board chart with his name on it, a chart which reminded him far too much of his youngest years.
Bunny nodded, less unsure of herself now that she’d had the conversation once before and was speaking with Papa, who never judged.
Keep sending your ideas!  And thanks a million for your comments/kudos!  I appreciate you all so much, even those anonymous lurkers (I know you're out there--I used to be you!).
It was nearing half six, and Mycroft knew the boys would be hungry for dinner soon enough, so he set the oven to preheat and began pulling out the ingredients for rosemary chicken.  Greg returned a few moments later with a smiling Bunny, supervised the boy as he very proudly chose a new sticker for his chart, and sent the boy back off to watch cartoons.  He returned to his puzzle, ignoring Mycroft’s chiding that he would never finish before they needed to sit down to eat by waving him off and continuing to search for the correctly matching pieces.
“If you’re referring to your newfound attachment to my older brother,” Sherlock said, alluding to Mycroft’s new status as John’s Daddy without expressly using the words,  “I think it’s about time someone else gets the bulk of his overbearing coddling for once.”
Sherlock nodded and began twisting knobs to adjust the water temperature, still wiping tears from his cheeks and his runny nose on the back of his hand.  Greg had to divert the boy away from the cabinet beneath the sink, where he knew Mycroft had stashed bath toys, and instead began undressing him as the tub filled.
“What happened, Lock?”
This time, Mycroft followed him to the kitchen, taking a seat on a bar stool at the counter while Greg set the tea kettle to boil.
Mycroft was calm and composed once more; he knew exactly how he needed to proceed.
“It’s not alright,” Mycroft insisted, “You don’t need to insist that it is.  I was wrong, and it’s okay to admit you’ve been hurt by my mistreatment of you.  I want us to be able to move forward.”
“Not in the least.  But, I need to know how you’d like to proceed.  Is this something you would like to do again?  Would you like to be put in pull-ups like Sherlock? Be toilet trained? Be reminded to use the toilet?”
“Let’s not talk about John, then,” his brother said with a shrug, as self-assured as always.  “Tell me about you.”
Sherlock fussed a bit more, but allowed Papa to help him into the bath.  He was tired of worrying about how to fix his mistakes, tired of replaying what he’d done again and again in his mind.  He slumped into the bath with a sigh, then leaned his head onto Papa’s hand where the man was resting it on the lip of the tub.
Another train had come and gone before John was relieved to recognize Greg’s car in the pick-up lane in the parking lot.  The past hour and a half had been filled with little more than John’s own struggles against self-deprecating thoughts--shame over abandoning Harry when she needed him, guilt over pulling Greg away from family celebrations on Christmas Eve, deep-seeded shame about the deep pull he was feeling to be young--and he was rather exhausted by the effort.
“Tell me about whales,” he said, eyes closed, hand absently stroking the nose of Sherlock’s alligator stuffed animal and head now pressed against Sherlock’s chest.
“What’s wrong, sweetheart?”
Mycroft turned over his shoulder to glance at Sherlock.
Hi, loves!  Hope you're all doing well.
“I’m sorry, My,” Sherlock said, head bowed.  “Didn’t mean to be bad.”
“I need some time,” John said.
“Come out into the kitchen,” Greg said gently, knowing there was more going on in Mycroft’s racing, anxiety-prone mind than the man’s dislike of holidays.  “I’ll make some tea and you can tell me what’s on your mind, alright love?”
Bunny nodded, and she rested in Papa’s arms until her tears--tears of happiness and joy as well as tears of relief after the confusion and doubt of the morning--had come to a stop.
John shook his head.  He wouldn’t be able to move without releasing the contents of his bladder right there on the couch, and he wanted nothing more than to continue the all-encompassing feeling of need which had overtaken his mind and body.  He felt as young as he had the day at the zoo, if not younger, and he never wanted the feeling of surrender to end.
“First, choose a sticker for your chart, good boy,” Papa said, suddenly next to them with the stack of stickers.
A look passed between Sherlock and John that Mycroft could not read.  But it was clear the men were both thinking of something said between the two of them in the past, that Sherlock was silently referencing an understanding between the two.  Had John spoken with Sherlock as candidly about his affinity for wetting as he had with Mycroft? Did Sherlock know that John had actually liked wetting his pants at the zoo or that he'd wet himself while alone with Greg the night after their case in Scotland? That he had been processing his feelings about the accidents since they had happened and admitted to Mycroft that he wanted to wet more often?
Greg nodded, gesturing for Mycroft to keep his voice down.
Bunny seemed to settle a bit, and peeked up at Mycroft.
“Hey,” he said, “None of that, now.  I need you to talk to me so that I can understand.”
“What happened with the bunny?” he asked, and Greg settled back into his chair.
I hope you're all doing well!  I know I need to get back to Sherlock and Mycroft in this story, but I'm having such fun writing about Christmas at the Lestrades.  TrailsandRoses made a great point that Greg's mom would be great with the Bunny, and the idea wouldn't leave my mind until I'd written a bit along those lines, so thank you to TrailsandRoses and to all of you wonderful readers for your thoughts, ideas, and encouragement!
“Fill up my chart with stickers like Bunny’s going to?”
“You know he’s never been one for easy transitions into headspace,” Mycroft said, one hand absently running through the hair at the back of Bunny’s head as their youngest dozed against his chest and suckled rhythmically on his pacifier.  “He’ll be okay after some time alone.”
When Mycroft turned from the stairs he found Sherlock at his shoulder, coat on but still dressed in his pajamas.  He sighed but chose not to insist, simply turning to lead his brother outside.  As long as he got Sherlock to their parents’ house in the country in one piece, he’d consider it a job well done.
Sherlock felt Mycroft’s hands by his waist, and suddenly his wet pajama pants were down around his ankles, saturated diaper placed on display.
He reached to ruffle Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock ducked away but could not help a smirk from emerging at the corner of his mouth.  Wetting his pants always made him feel small and vulnerable; the attention was a welcome relief even if he felt a bit frustrated at losing his gaming privileges for the day.
Papa’s voice was no-nonsense and demanding as he continued to jiggle the doorknob.  Sherlock pressed the juice box harder, willing the liquid to squirt out more quickly, clumsily aiming as he glanced back over his shoulder at the door.  He was grateful the video game was still waiting for him to choose to restart the level, bright electronic music repeating again and again; it would have been one more thing he’d needed to do before opening the door had the game shut off while he’d been gone.
He said goodnight to Greg before rolling over and closing his eyes.  He rubbed his new baby blanket against his nose and tried not to think too much about what would happen if he were to wet the pull-up between his legs.
“Can I wear one of the new ones, Daddy?”
“Not usually, no,” Mycroft said, running his hand up Sherlock’s spine to cup the back of his neck, still speaking softly into his ear.  “But it’s been a long day, and you’ve been fighting against your littlest headspace since you woke up this morning, haven’t you, baby boy?”
“I told you to leave me alone,” he said.
"See you soon," Greg called quietly from the base of the stairs.  Then, with a smirk and a wink: "Good luck."
Greg pulled Mycroft close, a hand behind the man’s ear as he pressed his lips against Mycroft’s.  He fumbled to unbutton the man’s shirt as they made their way to the bed, and was suddenly conscious of just how eagerly he’d been waiting for this moment, conscious of how much his teasing throughout the day had been poorly disguised flirting.
“Brave like Harry Potter?” John asked hopefully.
“It’s dumb,” Sherlock mumbled, pulling at his bottom lip.  “You’ll think…”
Ignoring the man with a roll of his eyes, John dragged the desk chair towards the bed, taking a seat where he could get a glimpse at whatever it was Sherlock was working on.
Papa smiled and cupped Bunny’s cheek with his hand.
Mycroft had been able to see that it had all been a bit confusing for the boy, but he was not about to treat John any differently than how they had discussed.  Mycroft needed to assure him that he would treat him exactly as John requested in their chats about boundaries and rules.
Sherlock was about to argue that he hadn’t asked for help during any point in their phone conversation, but as he opened his mouth, he could see all at once that of course the entire phone call had been nothing more than a poorly disguised cry for help.  He’d needed to know Papa was coming in order to keep himself from taking things even further.  Because Papa would make things better, Papa would help him navigate Mycroft.
But it was far too late.  Daddy twisted in his seat, and Bunny could see the expression on his face shift from one of concern to one of exasperation as he realized that Bunny wasn’t
“It’s okay, Bunny,” Sherlock tried.  “It was an accident.”
“Fuck,” John breathed, riding out his orgasm and collapsing back onto the bed.
“I’m tired, Daddy,” he said.  “I want to sleep.”
John smiled down at the boy and nodded.
“I can’t hear you with your mouth full, champ” Greg said with a chuckle as he tilted Sherlock’s head back slightly to have better access to his top teeth.
Mycroft sighed.  “We bought another of the same, didn’t we?”
“But she’s a girl not a boy,” Bunny said, very serious, clarifying.  “So she’s Willa.”
“If you need cheering up,” Greg said, reaching to pull his coat tighter around John, “just imagine the scene when I’m finally forced to bring Mycroft to family holidays.”
“Don’t stop,” he whispered.  He reached blindly backward to grab John’s thigh, trying to pull the man closer against him.
“I got two timeouts,” Bunny admitted, voice quiet as she ducked her head and reached to fumble with the buttons on Papa’s grey dress shirt.  “And I hadda accident.”
John cleared his throat and blinked into himself, wiping his face in the crook of his elbow and scooting forward onto the edge of the couch, separating himself a bit from Mycroft and Greg’s touch.  He took a moment to ground himself, then stood.
“Fifteen,” he said, hating himself for negotiating the number of spanks he would receive but also somehow desperate to be over his brother’s knee and being shown his place.
“Wash your hands,” Mycroft said.
There was a bit less of an edge to Sherlock’s voice, however, as if he had finally snapped out of his one-track mind solely focused on playing pirates and could actually see Bunny’s distress.  Sherlock pressed down between his own legs, as if watching Bunny wet his pull-up caused Sherlock to begin feeling desperate himself.
“Not a boy,” he mumbled softly into his chest, something that came without thinking, something he was too afraid to say loud enough for his Daddy to hear.
Greg and Mycroft stared up at him and then shared a look between themselves, Mycroft sighing.
He turned to let John be, but before he had made it down a step, he heard John call to him from behind the closed bathroom door.
It wasn’t that Bunny hadn’t liked wetting himself.  On the contrary; he couldn’t wait to do it again.  But standing in the middle of his bedroom and wetting himself so helplessly had sunk him down in age to the point where he felt content but so, so needy.
“Call if you need anything,” Mycroft reminded him, unable to keep from a bit of mother-henning.  “And get up and take a shower before you miss your train.”
“I don’t need a piss,” Sherlock argued, still refusing to look at Mycroft.  “But if you’re caught short and need the services, be my guest,
“Are there monsters in the lake?” he whispered, glancing up with genuine curiosity and a bit of fear.
“I’m sorry I was a bad boy who argued and whined and peed his pants, today, Uncle Greg,” Sherlock chattered as Lestrade handed him colorful pajamas and cartoon undies to place into the top drawer.
“Let’s see that tongue of yours, baby,” Daddy said.
This chapter contains lots of exposition/explanation in order to set the scene/provide background info.  Chapter 3 is not written yet (although later chapters are), but it will see more little Sherlock and caretakers Mycroft and John.  Little John will show up a few chapters later! I really just want to get to little John (many of the little John chapters are already written), but let's establish little Sherlock a bit for the sake of plot, shall we?
I'm so sorry to keep you all waiting for two weeks for this update!  Things have been very busy, but I'm excited to get this chapter to you.  Thank you all so, so much for your lovely comments--I'm off to sleep right now (I stayed up way past bedtime to finish the chapter and I really need sleep, now!) and have a busy day tomorrow, but I promise to respond to them before the weekend is out--your comments really and truly do keep me motivated and encouraged, and I value every one of you and your kind words and/or suggestions!  I'm anticipating a few typos in this update because I haven't had as much time as usual for editing, so feel free to point them out if you find them!  Thanks for reading :)
“We usually know how we’re feeling, even if we don’t always know where those feelings come from.  And that’s good,” Mycroft explained, speaking slower than usual to ensure the boy understood him, particularly now that he knew how young his little brother was feeling.  “But, sometimes, even when you’re
“Do you know there’s probably diseased frogs in the lake down there?” Sherlock asked, gesturing with his child’s size fork over his shoulder, where the lake lay beyond the sliding glass door.
It was the sound of shattered glass that must have been the last straw for Mycroft and John.  For, as Sherlock clutched his bleeding fist against his chest and stood on the carpet amidst the shattered fragments of the broken window, they shoved their way into the room, toppling over the dresser in their need to get to their hurt Sherlock.
“I’ve had - I had a boyfriend,” he bristles. I gape at him; he’s never admitted that sort of thing so clearly. It’s immediately obvious he had not planned on saying that out loud, and I rush to soothe him.
do that again, but - now I know your reasons for doing what you did, my ultimatum seems a bit much.”
“It won’t-”
it for me, Sh-”
Lestrade called as it was getting dark - there hadn’t been a murder, precisely, but he sounded defeated as he told John Sherlock would probably enjoy it. John hummed in agreement and threw Sherlock’s coat at him.
Sherlock looks at him and sighs.
Sherlock shakes his head, taking half a step back.
. You love me. That’s good, that’s
“I want this,” Sherlock continues doggedly. “I want this with you, with your daughter.”
“Can we please - just - focus, John?”
“Maybe you can set up your fancy camera to take some more photos next time we have sex.”
," Sherlock sneers. "So when I was playing, I was

“Now?” Sherlock asked as soon as he pulled the plug. John rolled his shoulder.
my bedroom being bugged."

When John gestures at him he shifts away from where he lies and John takes his place, sitting near the head of the bed. His cock juts proudly from the thatch of hair at its base. Before John can say anything else, Sherlock kisses the tip, licks up the length of it, and suckles the head.
Will meets them at the door.
“Okay, it’s alright, I’ve got you.” Leaning back, he watched as Sherlock’s body accepted more of him into itself, and bit his cheek against his impulses.
“Yeah, that’s what I wanted to talk about,” smiles John. Sherlock’s not sure why he keeps smiling. It’s not his angry smile, and it’s making him nervous. “We need to talk more, and I need you to
“You’re doing well, so well, Sherlock.”
After that, he has no words, because Sherlock tips up his hips for a better angle and John can't help but push a little faster, a little harder. They crush their mouths together as he comes, pulsing into Sherlock's body.
“You’ve got me,” Sherlock agreed. He squeezed his cock and rubbed it firmly as John continued to ease his finger into him, pulling back and advancing.
"Um."
"Love you too," mumbles Sherlock.
book."
“You too, yeah? You get some sleep. Okay?”
“I am so sorry,” he murmured. Sherlock twitched.
“No, it’s alright. I’ll just - go back up, yeah?”
“Well.” John tried to take a deep breath, but his chest was tight. “Christ, Sherlock. Yes, it is. I mean. I-” he swallowed and fell silent. Sherlock’s fingers gripped his chin and tipped his head to look him in the eye.
He isn’t a teenager anymore - God, far from it - but enough is enough. Anyone should be allowed to have a nice wank in their bed of a Sunday morning. He’d been sharing hotel rooms with Sherlock - if he was allowed to sleep at all - for the last week, chasing a bloody bicycle across the midlands. They’d gotten home last night buoyed up by the successful capture of the con artist in question and John had toppled up the stairs lest he grabbed Sherlock’s lapels and kissed him straight through to April.
“Yes, of course. Is that what you want tonight?”
John swallows and takes a deep breath. Sherlock might shatter from nervous anticipation.
"Give it time.”
When he came back upstairs, Sherlock was on his chair with his feet up, a hand to his mouth. John busied himself with making tea for both of them. When it was ready, he set it within Sherlock’s reach and touched him on the shoulder to call him back from his mind palace.
“God, is this alright?”
“Always, always.” His temple, his eyelid. Sherlock realises he has closed his eyes, overcome.
to start chasing him again.
Sherlock’s hips squirmed, his face reddened, and he nodded. Pulling up the skin around his cock revealed more of it, and John beamed up at Sherlock.
“Oi! Where are you going? You sod, you’re meant to stay and answer questions,” Lestrade yells after him.
“You… I want to say. I need to tell you. I. John.”
Sherlock twisted his face as it reddened further and his hips ground up harder. “John- ah!”
“I think so. I can still hear you in my other ear, though.”
“What does it matter to you, anyway, what I think about them,” he mused. Sherlock stiffened under his hands as he pressed on a bandage.
