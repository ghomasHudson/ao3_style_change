Then of course came the juggling of morality when it came to Luc. Obviously, everyone hated and feared him, but what could he do to change their minds? Luc had become his best friend out of necessity, and that didn't exist now that Chuck was gone. What if they always feared him? Dean couldn't live the rest of his life unable to spend any of it with that stupid archangel.
"Hmm?"
Okay so we finally have our Destiel progress! I know it's probably not as much as you hoped, but I needed it to be short and dramatic, next chapter we'll go straight to Sam and Cas so you'll see how it plays out!
Jody had a very confusing day, but any chance to see someone at all like her husband was a chance she'd be willing to take.
“That lance can kill me,” he responded, more for Mia’s sake, considering Raphael probably gave Sean the whole “weapons made by an archangel can kill an archangel” speech earlier. Mia looked shocked, even though she probably could have come to that conclusion on her own.
Dean stood and ran toward the angel, who was wiping the gross substance from his eyes. "Are you okay?" Dean surprised himself with his own concern and compassion for the man that just last night he had hated.
Mia wasn’t sure how to handle that one, but at this point, she had very little choice in the matter. She wouldn’t take Dean’s truth and tell them about it, but she had to give some things away to get through this with their help, and that started with just the tiniest bit of honesty and transparency.
Luc only looked more upset. "I wish I could do more, it's just that I spent so much time in the cage, and-"
Mia clapped her hands together loudly, pulling attention. "I think we should send Max home to get some rest, right guys?"
Simultaneously they both pulled out their fake badges and they even fell open at the same time. The bouncer cop, who could now be identified by his nametag as Trooper Wagner, looked surprised and then a little proud.
Dean smiled at her. This girl was sixteen, and she already had some of what took Dean over a decade to figure out as an adult.
The shouts were unintelligible; no one was yelling out anything useful. They were just yelling.
"Cas I wouldn't be able to come back the moment I left like I did last time. I would have to just let time pass like it's supposed to."
But looking around, he could see the place was empty. There was a bed across the room covered in thick, flannel sheets, a scratchy looking brown couch, and a coffee table, and behind him, there was another table with two chairs. He wasn't entirely lucid at the moment, and he was struggling to understand why.
"Hey, that's not true! I help Dean out all the time."
Dean threw his hands in the air. "Unbelievable. You think I can't be vulnerable?"
Dean smiled to himself. "Of course, there's Cas. That's a nickname for Castiel. Then there was Samandriel, who we called Alfie, Gabriel was Gabe, Michael was Mike, but only a couple times." He stared forward with a very bothered look. "Michael was not always a friend."
Dean had his fair share of times being the bad guy, and Lucifer knew that. Dean had been through difficult times that Lucifer couldn’t comprehend. And while both Lucifer and Dean made a deal with each other to never compare their personal tragedies and hardships as better or worse than one another’s, it was a difficult line to tow.
"Then why did you play the deal card?"
As a happy little surprise, Cas called him when he was about forty minutes out, presumably calling him the moment he found the note.
"Hmm… I want to say… fifty?"
Dean stormed away, unfollowed, but it didn’t matter because they both knew Dean wasn’t going to leave the school building. They both knew Lucifer would never relent from stopping him from going. Dean was trapped here, under Lucifer’s command.
She reached her arms across the table and put her hands on Dean's nervous, shaking ones. "Hey, it's going to be okay."
Mia bounced slightly beside Dean, her hands on his shoulder, making a hushed noise that Dean recognized as muffled squealing. He rolled his eyes at her, used to her outbursts of emotionality at this point.
Dean shook his head, a dark look on his face. "This wasn't an accident. You have to know that; why the hell else did he call us both yesterday? He said something was wrong, and I couldn't do anything!" The words were coming from an honest place. He knew that this wasn't an accident, but mainly because Chuck had admitted to using Max as bait, and Dean didn't trust God for one second.
Chuck tapped his foot impatiently, as if not expecting Lucifer to put up a fight. “Maybe not, but if you’d like I could just take one of these two people with me instead,” he suggested, glancing over at the Mills.
Jody blinked at her and looked between Mia and Dean. Sean was equally quiet, but his confused look was more one of incredulity as he stared at Dean in wonder and admiration.
(See the end of the chapter for
At least then, he might not have seemed so… distant.
"It can kill Lu-" Dean's voice was suddenly cut off as Kevin felt him being pulled away.
He just said goodbye! With no explanation to whatever the hell happened! It was very on-brand but very, very concerning.
“Are you guys really Feds?” She asked, seeming intrigued.
"He still doesn't want me to heal him, but do you know what I saw? That man has a bum leg, a couple of knives, a gun, severe blood loss, and deliria. Yet, somehow he managed to take down a vampire single-handedly by breaking off the leg of a table, binding his neck to the bed with the cloth bandages I brought him, and cutting off his hands so that he couldn't escape."
"You're… you're not scared… of anything," Kevin managed to get the words out, broken and still panicked.
He felt a hand on his shoulder, more on his back, inches beneath where his hand was sandwiched between the two of the figures hugging him. The fingers were smaller and slender, just as familiar as the ones digging into his bones above it. Her touch was all-too reminiscent of the concept of winning a battle.
Then there were the stairs. Sam and Cas shared a look of amusement as Dean's eyes got wide, staring at the same stairs they had crossed a million times. They had never looked quite so daunting.
"Jody, calm down," Lucifer started, but she didn't seem to care that he was Lucifer the archangel; he was just in her way.
Mia cocked her head to the side, unaware that Sam and Cas did almost the same gesture. In a better situation, there would have been time for her to analyze that and figure out if the reason she did it was that Dean did it, and if the reason he did was that his family did, but now was not the time for that.
Sam crossed his arms. "Really? He forgot about the injury that's laid him up for the last few weeks? Come on," he grumbled. "Why did he forget about his leg? And why did he rush to the aid of a witch, dropping everything to go help her? I know he has an affinity for those young hunters, but he doesn't like witches. And he doesn't make exceptions."
"Lucifer told me everything about his encounters with you; I mean, the man made you soup. But what happened that gave you a change of heart?"
Dean took a breath. "Your dad? Chuck? He's the one who sent me here."
“For a lot of things, for all those decisions I’ve made that have hurt you. I never wanted to, you’re my little brother, and I’m so sorry.”
"Look, Mia's my friend. Yeah, she's just sixteen and definitely unprepared, but she's determined." Kevin sighed as he looked around. "Do you really think that Sean and Jody can get to her right now? She's rebelling. If they find her first, she'll just keep sneaking out until she proves herself or dies."
"Yeah, sure, let's go with that. Then, the first moment you pray for him after a year's sabbatical, he shows up instantly-"
Lucifer shook his head, firm in his morals. "He doesn't want me to heal him. He doesn't even want me to touch him. I won't make him go through something he doesn't want. Bringing him here would only make him freak out more, and I don't want him to hurt somebody here." He turned back to the pot. "So, I'm trying to win him over."
He smiled at the memories, but his happiness was quickly replaced with the discouragement he had on his face before. "Maybe in your world, it was easier. But the reason I said that is because I didn't decide to come to this moment in time to 'spare them' anything. I came so that I wouldn't have to talk about where I've been for the past six years."
"Please," Dean turned and smiled at his friend. "Jody won't ever be grateful for anything that I'm involved in."
She locked eyes with him and nodded. 'Exactly. So, people like you and me, people who lost people we loved, don't want to watch Dean force Sam and Cas to take him for granted because they don't even know they lost him. And truthfully? I didn't even want Dean to come back to this time because I desperately wanted to watch how much his family missed him. You know, Dean is so damn stubborn, he refused to talk about how much his family might have been missing him!"
"What storm?" Kevin's voice chimed in from the side. He and Mia definitely took the "all the firewood they could carry" demand literally. He couldn't even see Mia's face. They basically just dropped it all gracelessly in between the two log seats, and Dean got on one knee beside it.
“Maybe it is,” Sean admitted, “and maybe you will never be Dean, but Dean didn’t do anything on his own. He had something else. He had…”
“The lance of Michael,” Sean admitted, watching Lucifer’s face for a change.
"What?! What is?!"
Lic turned to leave, but Dean reached forward and grabbed his arm. "Wait, let me get something before you go," he said before hurrying off around the corner.
A small, satisfied smirk grew on Luc's face as he began to speak. "You know, you're never actually pointing at a specific constellation," he pointed out.
Jody’s furious demeanor melted a little bit, as though the fact that Mia had even the slightest bit of remorse was all she needed to calm down. “That’s fine, as long as you return it to me,” Jody said stiffly.
"I can see why you owe your life to them," Lucifer said kindly. "You all look so happy."
The blonde archangel froze for a moment, confused, but Raphael patiently did not move. In an instant, Lucifer was returning his brother's hug, silently crying into his shoulder.
"Hey!" She barked. "I'm trying to protect your friend."
Chuck's fust pounded the table beside him, and it cracked and crumpled to the floor. "There is only one universe left. Tell me, was Dean Winchester with him?"
She reared her head, and Dean, for once, didn't have to worry about his next move. His head was finally clear; the world was finally as it should be.
Cas just nodded in agreement and looked back out the window. He could only pray that Dean would finally be there when they got back.
"Oh yeah, John Winchester," Mia piped in, drawing Sam's attention. "He was a stubborn, surly son of a bitch, I'll tell you that. He was always trying to hunt down that damn Colt to kill some demon creep." Dean was very glad he told Mia and the others all about his life and his family because any doubt that Sam had seemed to disappear. Maybe not permanently, but if he would be distracted by personal details about their father, then that was good enough for Dean.
After a moment where the three of them were catching their breath, eyeing Max contently, the hunter stared at his powerful friend thoughtfully. "Is there any way for you to see what happened in the other time?"
Sometimes Dean hated how stubborn he could manage to be. He knew he was being unfair to Luc, but this wasn't about covering for what he said on the phone or selfishly saving his family, it was about getting in and putting the key in the box.
Truthfully, he was beginning to think he was just jumping from disaster to disaster, but it did help take his mind off of the fact that he traveled back in time and was lying to the two people he loved most.
The stranger sat back down in the seat beside Max's bed, lazily tossing one leg over the arm of the chair. "You know," she started after a moment of silence. "I read dozens upon dozens of books on witchcraft, and yet I am complete shit at pretending to be a witch."
"Oh, dearie?" Rowena's grating voice interrupted her thoughts again. "I might be of more assistance than you think."
Dammit, Dean, hold it together. God knows that the second Mia saw the two in the same room, she would spare no shortage of vague and not-so-subtle comments about Dean's feelings, and that would be embarrassing enough to shake and play-off, so he didn't want to screw this up. He wouldn't hug him; it would be a lot less in character for him.
Dean fights through his delirium and fear of the archangel who keeps trying to help, more specifically learn how to cook
“Are you serious?” Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “I gave the keys to that woman when I crawled out of the car! No question they got to Sam and Cas. All we need to do now is go open the box for them, it’s that simple.”
"That's not what I mean." He gave Lucifer a pointed look, but he was very quickly aware that the archangel already knew that. "When Max called me, I could have called Sam and Cas. I should have called Sam and Cas. It was stupid to try and do it by myself with my leg, but I did it anyway, all alone. I didn't leave a note; I didn't even call them and meet them there. I was so damn determined that I could do it. I could help him, by myself, even with my leg the way it was, and it bit me in the ass. Chuck knew if he could scare me enough, I would charge in blind and alone. I'm apparently both that reckless and that predictable."
Dean and Cas walked hand and hand through the garage and outside to the dirt drive, meeting up with Sam who was already gawking at Luc's present.
Dean carefully watched their faces as his story was over. He highlighted every important fact except for Sean Mills and the massacre, but the latter had specifically been brought up a lot anyway.
Dean froze. He knew exactly what Max was talking about. "Max, don't touch that. Do you understand me? Don't touch it. Don't go near it. Where are you?"
Dean glared into his lap, the memories and images of that night burned into his mind. All of the dead bodies of people he'd known for four years scattered across the cafeteria floor, the bloody bodies of children draped over tables and chairs. How he couldn't do anything to help or protect them from Ruth and her angels.
Raphael sent him a glare. "Pray to him. Bring him here, right now."
The two, practically synchronized, turned their backs pressed to the side of the Impala, and slid to the ground, sitting on the curb facing the house.
Her house was nice, pretty small but it worked since she seemed to be the only one living there. The house looked as though it belonged to an old lady, the couches were lime green with quilts draped over them, and a few cats were lazing about bookshelves and tables. It was a strange atmosphere for a woman who was clearly around Mia’s age.
That caught Sam’s attention. “You’re right, Cas,” he realized. “Dean never would have given something away that didn’t matter, especially not in that dire a situation. He probably knew that if he gave them to Trinity they’d find their way to us!”
Castiel realized that this may be a perfect opportunity to do some investigating, seeing if she would maybe slip up or tell him something that might be telling.
Where to start?
The angel spent the rest of the night and well into the late morning sitting on his bed and staring at the wall, rubbing circles into his sternum in hopes of creating some friction that would fill the empty hole in his chest.
"I also don't understand why he's here," Mia jabbed her arm behind her, pointing at the man shuffling behind them, even slower and more clumsily than Mia, which did make her feel a bit better.
“So…” Kevin started, trying to mask his discomfort with conversation. “Have you told him yet?”
“Where’s Rowena?” Kevin asked as they struggled down the rickety steps and back onto the dirt drive, making a beeline for the Impala.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Cas finally spoke, and his voice was so low and soft that Dean felt seconds from bursting into tears. This was all so much easier when Dean was a universe away, just fantasizing about coming home.
"I think she was probably watching me, and in turn, watching Mia. I wouldn't be surprised if she watched everyone in the base. She'd never actually get in, thank god for Luc," Dean quickly added, wanting to quell the alarm that came from the woman next to him. He rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I don't look forward to telling them about this."
Mia shook her head. "You did everything you could; I closed myself off. That was my decision. I don't know if you've noticed, Dean, but I'm actually an adult now. And I make my own choices that you don't get to blame yourself for, okay?" She squeezed his hand quickly, and they walked over to Sam and Cas.
“Did you get this from Dean?” she asked warily.
Lucifer and Ruth stood at opposite sides of the room, Chuck in the middle of them, leaning casually against the table. Mia was asleep in a far corner, Sam was standing slightly behind Cas and slightly in front of Jody.
During these trips, they all spilled their life stories. Mia told them more about the girl she had been in love with and several interesting high school anecdotes. Kevin told them stories about what college was like and the vacations he took with his eccentric mother. Lucifer shared some stories from when he and his brothers were young, and Dean shared basically everything he could think of.
Kevin shuddered at the thought. Ever since these monsters were unleashed on the world, he had feared more and more. How the hell was he supposed to live in a world like this? With things like what almost killed Dean in the woods?
Kevin watched as Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out a gently folded polaroid picture. Dean was in the middle next to a man laughing hysterically and one very, very tall man with girly hair. "Friends or family?"
They were both surprised by the group of volunteers standing beside Kevin in the cafeteria. Eleven people with varying skills and determinations, all looking steel-faced and brave.
He took a breath; he had been thinking about what he wanted. He had been weighing the pros and cons of both options, and he had a feeling that they weren't going to like the second half of his decision.
"Dean!" She looked relieved. "You're alive! Oh god, I almost had to-"
Mia’s smile only grew wider. “Thank you, Trinity!” she stood from the couch and bolted out the door, leaving everyone confused.
Dean nodded slowly, starting to realize all of the things they would have to iron out. "Well, I can't say I dropped my phone, that's the dumbest excuse in the book, and I've used that on Sam many times when I would screen his calls when we were teenagers. It'll be the boy who cried wolf."
But instead of going through Samuel Campbell's eighth journal, Dean had pulled her outside, saying that it was time for her to get out and start training.
"Brother, please. You have to save your strength for the time travel aspect of this."
“Raphael, Ruth and Chuck will be spending some time in my old haunt,” Lucifer said with a little smile he was unable to stifle. “Would you be so kind as to accompany them downstairs?”
She beamed at him, looking relieved for some reason. "Us witches gotta stick together, right?"
Shaking off the dark thoughts, sure to follow that quickly derailing train of thought, he refocused on the situation at hand.
Lucifer shook his head. "No, not give me up. Let me go," he said softly. "I love you too, Dean. And it breaks my heart to leave you and Mia and Kevin and Sean, but I can't stay. And you have to. This is where our paths split."
Kevin and Mia shared a look. "You want us to sleep… here? Outside?" Kevin asked tentatively.
Castiel was perhaps the only one in the room not staring directly between Chuck and the two angels who were currently grappling for control of the lance. Somehow Ruth was flying completely upside down…? It was a mess. But he was paying more attention to Dean.
Raphael gratefully smiled and flew over, appearing in frame next to Dean in a split second.
A sick feeling festered in his stomach as he dialed the number and listened to the phone ring.
He watched as the figure went up the stairs and stopped a few steps down from him. "Dean, you shouldn't sleep here."
Dean wasn't sure what to do with his hands. They wouldn't stop fidgeting and shaking during the silence that followed Lucifer's little insight. He was going to see Kevin. Kevin Tran. Not his Kevin, but a Kevin. Alive. God, how old would he be now? His late twenties?
"I could wake him up."
Castiel and Sam shared an unsure glance. They could just let Mia leave, she left the Ma’lak box and the keyring and she didn’t even know about the flash drive, so they still held all the cards, but the fact that she wasn’t trying to take those items with her implied that while they may be important, they had little to do with finding Dean.
“Alright Mia, let’s see,” Sam beckoned her to come over, and she looked down at the flash drive in her hand. She had half a mind to stomp on it and crush it, but she wasn’t sure if she actually could do that successfully. She didn’t want to watch this, she wanted to be back at the base with her mom, falling asleep to Kevin’s snoring.
"Thank you," she added with a tight nod before turning back to Lucifer. "You can't sit this out. You want Dean to go home, don't you?"
Dean let go of the sheets. There's only silence. Castiel heard his heart thumping in his eardrums.
Gavin didn’t even turn.
Castiel’s gasp was drown into Dean’s mouth. He ran his hands around Dean’s sides, threading on the toned muscles of the handyman’s backside while Dean buried himself deeper inside him. Castiel hissed and let his body roll, teeth catching
Then Dean leaned back and rolled his hips aiming to take him deeper. Castiel gasped in pleasure. But then Dean’s movements demanded mounting up Cas’ chest, almost letting Castiel’s cock to slip out— before slamming back down. Castiel lost the ability to think as Dean did it twice and thrice in arrow. It was as if Dean believed Castiel would never let him fall. The angel groaned and came apart at the slide of his cock at the precious tight heat, as if Dean was plotting to really make him a quivering moan of mess. Remembering he was the one who promised Dean pleasure, Castiel took hold of Dean’s hips tightly before slamming back and pounding deeper into the hunter. The sound Dean made were the memories Castiel will bury in his eardrums and the song he’d like to revisit every time he slipped into his nirvana. He was leaving his mark all over Dean’s body, leaving the memories here at the very dungeon that left too many painful memories for Dean. Now erasing all of that and changing them with something pleasurable to look back into and happiness filled the angel.
“Cas, fuck—Cas!” he cried again, “I’m—I’m…coming…! Shit…”
“No, Sam. It’s more important that you, Eileen, and your brother are alright” for now, he breathed closing his eyes tight, throat constricted. He had thought about it, had they not stopped Chuck now, Dean’s inevitable death in a dark, cold place—the thought just gutted him. “Thank you.”
Dean looked up and saw a man blonde man with deep gray eyes staring at the sleeping angel with wide glinting eyes. He was holding a camera in his hand and as if in a trance—he started to raise it to take a shot of the sleeping angel but then—
Dean smiled.
Castiel looked up in time to see Dean Winchester wink at him. It was that moment that he was baptized a short version of his name. Not that his brothers don’t call him that, but it was strange coming from a stranger.
Castiel pressed his lips. Many times, he wished he had his wings back for emergencies and of course, convenience, but he never truly wished it as bad as now. “Well, I’m on my way back now. I think I can make it in the morning of the next day.”
“That’s the gist of it. He is very…. Endearing.”
“I seemed to be getting in your debt a lot, Mr. Winchester,” he said the name in an undertone that got Dean squinting at him.
“Hey! You gonna leave work?” Bobby shot back at him from the shop. Castiel shook his head, but Dean raised a hand, signaling a second to wait.
Silence fell in the room.
Dean smirked. “I’ll get you there soon. You think this is the last time we’re doing this?”
Brows furrowing, Castiel dragged his hand on top of his lover’s wayward hand. He loved thinking of Dean as his lover. Boyfriend was the street word people used, but Dean was hardly a boy, he was a man. Dean laughed his ass out when he called him ‘manfriend’ then proceeded on fucking his brains out before asking Cas this was not what ‘friendly men’ do. So, lover it is. He remembered Dean’s blush; his speck of freckle set on flames with green eyes sparkling as the ocean in mid-afternoon. Besides, lover was a terminology Castiel never thought he could use freely with Dean. There were times when they just lie together, he would ask himself if this was all a dream. The mark on his arm would remind him it wasn’t.
The demon roared and Castiel watched with mixed feelings of fascination and dislike but then, he could never hate Dean. So he clung to him, clawed on Dean’s back, and pressed him on the wall quietly. Dean can't escape him, he's under the spell now. But it was over. whatever was between them was over too. It may be the last time, but Dean will be Dean when all this is over.
Castiel pulled Dean a little rougher towards the open-door clinic. The school nurse was up and about and was lecturing Dean on being an idiot for his feat. Castiel stood beside him the whole time with arms crossed. When they were done, they walked back to the dormitory with shoulders bumping.
Castiel pretended he didn’t hear it.
“Doesn’t it bother you that other people would find out?”
“Officer Winchester, I’m sure you remember.” Gabriel sat behind his desk. Abaddon gave Dean her full attention, eyes darting up and down Dean’s form.
“That’s a trick.”
“Yes, they are very territorial. The last friend I brought here, they hissed at me whenever I walk at my own lawn for a week.”
Cas turned around to see Dean standing behind him with curt eyebrows. The impala was behind him with its lights on. Castiel didn’t notice him return.
“Team Alpha called for a back-up on EOD but seconds later we received the breach of perimeters.”
“I don’t understand, there were many of them and I—”
Back in high school, he rarely involved himself in any physical activity. He was more indoors and studying type. He was good at that so why not. Then this school happened. With a tired sigh, he changed to his work clothes and joined the others in the fields where they plowed a five-hectare land in the next four hours.
“I don’t sleep. I haven’t been into sleeping for a year now and it’s taking toll. I—I don’t know what’s up with my body. I fear my bed. I fear sleep. I’ve seen other doctors and they told me the same straight solutions—good diet, new perspective in bedroom. I tried everything but it’s the same damn thing. And then the nightmares. I don’t understand. I think I’m dying, but I’m there and—I— I heard from my brother you’re the best when it comes to this—sleep disorders.” it was like getting punched in the gut admitting it.
“I think it should be okay. Bring in the others.”
But as long as Dean would have him, Castiel will stay… He will take everything Dean would give him in crumbs.
“This early?” Dean kneeled on the bed, blushing furiously as he watched Cas rise to his feet in his birthday suit. He never ceased to look so glorious in Dean’s eyes.
“I’m happy you’re glad to see me,” grinned the impish demon using Dean’s signature charming smile. Castiel glared.
"Then why are you running away just now?"
“Oh? This is the first time I heard you talk about your folks.” Dean said with genuine interest as they return back to the horses to prepare for the jump, “
“Yeah, you’re not wearing any safety gear, the hell are you going near that thing.” Dean tugged him back warily.
“Oh, if you have club activities, it’s alright to go ahead,” the sophomore said, “We only have like a dozen of them running around anyway. Only the two of you will do.”
"Hm?" Castiel looked up from his papers, “Which part? The part where she wants you as a personal bodyguard?”
“Anything babe,” Dean unhook his belt and Castiel was soon an audience to his throbbing length with precum already leaking in its head. Dean licked his palm to rub his
“I have my own interest,” Crowley only smiled as he leaned forward with hands clasped on the table, “You say you’re not sick? Why the lack of sleep? Something keeping you at night?”
But Doctor Novak didn’t kiss him. A  disappointed growl escaped Dean's lips that had the doctor staring. Castiel remained hovering before Dean with that wicked smile on his lips that made Dean agree mentally that yes, Doctor Novak was no nice angel.
Castiel gasped when Dean swallowed him whole.
He found Dean watching him with wide eyes. “What?”
The dinner was exquisite. Castiel was his at most ease, Dean could tell from the way he drank his wine, the way he smiles easily at Dean. He never usually sees the doctor smile, but now he was charming. Dean didn’t lose the battle, if it was being charming and handsome, that was his forte and he was bringing everything on that table that by the time the desserts came, served formally by the butler, Dean knew Castiel’s eyes were only on him.
Dean was in his room mixing cassette tapes when he thought he heard Castiel call him outside. Sliding his laptop down the side table, he walked around his bed to open the door only to find the hallway empty. He looked left and right, made sure Cas didn’t appear around the corner before closing his room. It wasn’t something unusual. Sometimes Dean could actually feel Castiel, not in a very cosmic way, but just feel him around, like when you accidentally got a tissue stuck at the sole of your shoe. That wasn’t his best description, but there’s an assurance that profound bond or not, he had some instinctive connection to his angel. Not that he’d admit it to Cas aloud and get Sam giving him that knowing look again.
It broke in his ears. Castiel backed away from the door. "I'm sorry-"
"I didn,'t recognize this handwriting until later, when I was able to get hold of the second note that you sent to Abaddon. When I finally saw it I was able to understand. Your suicide mission here in my department, we’re ending it here now.”
"I didn't think you would've jumped like that. Had I known it, I never would've-"
“Thank you, Milligan. This is a great help.”
“I’ll take you up in that invitation, but I would rather you do the jumping and I’ll carry you.”
“Is it an actual island, though?” Jack muttered, all by himself beside Cas as he browsed the leaflet, “Ooh, boating and tan. I want one.”
“If you tell me to stop, I will.” Castiel said straight in Dean’s eyes.
And of course, they’d send in the Malakai. Dean tried not to be too pleased. He was an arm’s length from the bomb officer whose eyes prey on him, the same intense twinkling behind his eyes that always get Dean to react and think of beds and pillows.
“Yet we were able to easily infiltrate the building under your very nose.”
“Cas, are you okay? I went back in the kitchen from the garage and you were gone. I thought something must’ve…” he must’ve seen something in Castiel’s eyes because he grew more solemn, “Did you see something?” he looked around the room, “A memory in here?”
Dr. Novak’s eyes hardened but it was gone in a flicker of an eye.
“This guy here is awake already!”
“Wouldn’t it be better to choose a school specifically designed for that, though?” Castiel had been meaning to ask but this was the only time he could also bring it up.
“Well, aren’t you being selfish when you’re the one pulling away?”
“You don’t like pineapple?” Castiel found this curious.
What are you doing?” He demanded, his back hitting the wall behind him, arms immovable from the older Winchester’s middle. Dean’s back was flat on his chest and he was speaking in Dean's ear, brushing Dean’s hair with his nose so he could taste the hunter’s shampoo. If Castiel were to remember this moment as not the ‘where Dean almost fell off the railing again’, he’d certainly remark it as ‘too close to Dean that his heart almost exploded.
“Um…sure.”
Dean wouldn’t stop looking at the corner of the walls where the Enochian symbols were just glowing moments ago.
"I'd love to...but is that really something we should be kissing about?" he clutched on Dean's wrist and drew him closer, "I want more, you see."
Castiel stared at the closed door.
“That’s definitely out of the question, don’t make moves on me while at the school.”
“This was the worst-case scenario,” Gabriel admitted, putting his hands together and fixating a look on the note inside a forensic transparent bag. Abaddon stared at Gabriel and Dean in confusion.
“Dean, what’s your dream?”
Castiel wanted to melt. This was the first time someone genuinely asked if he was fine and it made his heart flutter unexpectedly. He shook his head. Dean was waiting for him.
Slumping down on his rear, Castiel ran his fingers to his hair and shut his hot eyes close. He could feel his heart beating fast, could feel it get pinched every second as he thought of Dean. This was sorrow, that he knew, and it could only be healed by that one person he wanted to see so badly now.
Castiel blinked at her. Was she complimenting him?
“Are you kidding me, Cas?” Dean winked, “You’re like the most amazing guy I know, and that’s saying something from a guy who’s seen the coolest horse riders in the country!”
“Sounds exciting.”
“Okay, okay, don’t get worked up on it,” Castiel laughed and pressed a finger on Dean’s wet lips, it was enticing to look at, “Some place I know, kissing doesn’t mean a thing at all. But if you want us to be a couple, I’d like that too.”
“I heard in the cities, you can phone in an order,” Gadreel said with arms crossed, “and get a pizza delivered within 30 minutes!”
“I’ll do anything to be back with this family, Dean. I think you understand. I just want to be…
Amara tilted her head, eyes full of wonder.
Castiel slammed down his chest and Dean picked him up and finished inside Cas. They did not move until Dean’s length popped out of Cas and he rolled Castiel on the bed to rain kisses on his face. Rocked his hips on Cas’ legs because he was hard again that had Castiel pressing back his palms on Dean’s chest to look at him.
“You know that is impossible,” Castiel rolled his eyes.
Castiel dropped by the shop and the first man he met was an old guy wearing a tattered cap. Without needing to ask, Castiel knew who he was.
“W-where's your shirt?” he said in a strangled voice.
Thanks for reading <3
“Are you kidding?” Dean snaked a hand around Castiel’s waist and pulled him to finally get rid of the gap between their bodies. Dean’s lips were warm and cautious as it nipped over Castiel’s own. Castiel parted his lips to accept his gentle kiss, making Dean reach for his jaw, the pads of his fingertips not quite touching his skin. It was slow and absurdly wet, making Castiel question if Dean had had some practice. The idea of another person kissing Dean so sweetly like this annoyed him, but that’ll be another story. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and only pulled for air. The way Dean was holding him was secure and steady so he let himself drown in the kiss.
“Hmm?” Inias blinked at him.
“Is that right? We heard he was aiming for you, chief?” Benny snickered with eyes falling on Castiel who kept his silence as he stood at the far corner leaning on the wall with arms crossed.
“You’re taking stuff that is a pain in the butt. Just like that time with the pizza party and now Ham. You know, the rest of us from farming families never really thought about killing and eating livestock, you know? It was something we took for granted. But here you are, flailing around, thinking about it in our faces, being brutally sincere.”
“Well, souvenir it is. There’s a shell cottage souvenir shop near the coastline—”
Dean inhaled sharply, his nostrils flaring.
Sure enough, Cas and Jack both blinked back at him and then at Dean.
A tear slid from the corner of his eyes. He was back on the bed with Dean breathing on his lap. Castiel held him closer, his shoulder shaking at what he just witnessed. Dean was peacefully sleeping on his arms, on his arm where the Mark also burned like a brand. Castiel’s heart broke. There was no way out of things, less Dean forgets him. Maybe Dean should. Maybe he should ask it out of Amara. It didn’t matter that it broke his heart, it mattered that Dean was alive and happy.
“Because it doesn’t work like that. If I had wanted you to remember the events last night, you would. But I cannot reveal my methods without knowing my patient cover to cover and give my full diagnosis, we are not doing magic tricks here, Dean.” Dr. Novak answered as he maintained his steady gaze. “That’s why I invite you to breakfast because afterward will be extraneous for your mental faculties.”
The entire Bunker groaned. Jack panics for a second wondering if he used too much. He looked around, but aside from the flickering of light that abruptly turned red then blinked back to normal again, nothing happened. He hears footsteps behind him and turns just as Castiel and Dean emerge from the library, both in respective clothes and identical expressions of concern. Though, Dean showed it mostly with curt eyebrows.
“But you still came, right?” Castiel patted Dean’s left shoulder and squeezed tight. He didn’t expect Dean to be that hard on himself, at the same time he could easily see how he was making himself too vulnerable. Dean’s eyes transfixed somewhere on his lips, or chin and nothing Castiel did or say could stop him from doing it so he just let Dean do what he wanted. The kitchen was clean with the pie in the middle of the table when Dean started talking about his plan.
He smiled bitterly. It was what Dean would tell him.
But as they said, not everything is good news. On the day of the fair, Castiel and the other students were given their phones back as the school was now an open gate. Castiel got all the messages from his mother and replied to the ones that had something to do with the ham delivered at his home address. To his surprise, however, his reply was returned with a call.
Dean didn’t have to say anything. His look gave it away. The man scrambled away in understanding, so did everyone else who saw the look on the hunter’s face. It’s been a while since he felt the intent to both protect and murder. But what’s this racket about?
“That doesn’t work—” Dean pressed but he was pushing past them while Cas glanced back at him.
No… the sun was still lulling him, and the angel beside him is giving him this kind of peace and security that he is safe. That’s when Dean allowed himself to relax, lay down and sleep again.
“So you figured?”
“I’m sure I don’t know what it means.”
“With a pig this size, it would fetch around ten thousand dollars or more in the livestock market. But what would you do with it? Will you keep taking care of it as a pet? Where would you keep it? What about its feed? What will happen to it when you graduate?”
“I guess that’s true,” Dean sighed, “this basically puts me in a handcuff because I can’t touch you.”
“I know.”
“That leaves us with one problem,” Castiel said as they reached his dormitory, “the crack on the brick oven,”
“No.”
Castiel pressed even closer and Dean wondered if the angel blade was hidden in his pocket. “Like this?”
Gadreel punched keys.
“It's basically a font cropped on the top but the pattern is familiar and this packaging brand and it matched with one store. Here.” The screen flashed a Home Depot. Castiel and Dean exchanged glances and calls were made.
An hour in the bar left Dean wondering if he could get tattoos around here. An impala should be a good mark. When Jason noticed where he was looking, it began an interesting exchange of the closest tattoo shop around. Dean thought of the pointy blade against his skin—imagined the man turning to a demon—so recalled why he never trusted tattoo artists and barbershop to do their thing. So the tattoo was a no.
“I’ll get it.”
Doctor Novak glanced at him but didn't say anything. If Dean was paying for his time, he could have demanded an answer. But there was that fact, he didn't want to talk about sexual orientation yet with this guy. Deep in his mind, he wondered if the doctor would laugh... knowing Dean's condition like this. He swallowed hard. Now he's distracted.
“I will get you more sleep as necessary. Then when I see that you are physically fit, we are going to open your mind to another subject perhaps too personal for you to even admit to yourself. Do we have any family member that you wish to be present while doing so, Dean?”
“Tell me, is this the first time these cats have made you call for help?”
“Yes, please,” begged the demon, “I need—"
Castiel thought about it. “You were.”
Dean didn’t even register the meaning of everything Crowley said until he was out of his office. What little musing he had over it was instantly disrupted when his phone buzzed in his pocket. Looking at the screen, he saw his brother’s name and answered at once.
Dean pulled himself together. Cas will be fine, he told himself. If he didn’t, where’s Dean’s happy ending? Because he was certain he’s already got it which scared him sometimes. Sam once asked him if he wasn’t scared of losing his life. Dean wasn’t, but ever since meeting Cas had turned him mellow. After marrying Cas, Dean had been partly living in bliss and in fear that someday it would all end. He grasped the idea of living this life already. Cas was always worried for him, but in truth, Dean was most afraid to lose this too and the only thing that kept him through was trusting Cas would always make it back to him every time. That kept him forward in every mission.
“He won’t be keeping it though,” Dean said when they came out of the stables. He stretched his arms up the sky, the two of them watching the sun rising from the horizon. “But I hope it won’t bother you… you always get worked up about stuff in this school. I mean, it would be fun if everybody knows… do you know people always talk about you?”
“Blue,” Dean said with a sigh.
This was the exact same place where he met Dean Winchester. The exact same spot where he thought a bear was going to pop out but instead there appeared Dean.
“I don’t mind being a target if I’m surrounded by studs for sure,” she smiled slyly while crisscrossing her legs. Dean huffed and chuckled at the same time.
“Better do the modern stuff, get your phone out. It’s a full house, I can’t even see my own shadow.”
“We’re free.” Castiel ran his fingers deep in his scalps as the heat of Dean’s mouth ran along his neckline. “Dean… we’re free…”
“You look so cute, Cas.” Dean said as he helped himself in slowly undoing Castiel. It was the first time for Castiel to be touched like this and he was feeling it. Dean’s large calloused hands, his thick fingers, his thumb pressing at the head of his cock. It was making his legs turn to goo. Dean surely appeared to know what he was doing and Castiel let him.
Castiel obviously read the message, but only stared at him in the eyes.
"Yes, but all sins root from love,"
There was a big fuss inside the Head Quarters when Dean came out of his office. Clearly, there are things his team are more eager than little pep talks the way they were crowding the hallway, all staring open-mouthed at someone by the door. He broke the queue and watched her flaunt in the vicinity in sharp cut dress and three-inches heel. Dean’s brain buzzed. All the officers were entranced as they watched her glide before them, eyes catching the sparkle of her every step. She was quite different from the haggard lady Dean and his team had to rescue from the clutches of her ex-boyfriend. Dean’s lip itched as it reminded him of the bad cut. Cas was so angry about that. Had it only been less than a week?
“It’s because we were drinking before we could even have dinner.” Castiel sighed as he pulled Dean closer. He smelled of the perfume he bought. But he was also the Dean who generally smelled good after spending time in the kitchen. It was addicting. His eyes fell on Dean’s exposed neck and the hunger was there. Castiel couldn’t take his eyes from Dean’s collar and Adam's apple that seemed to entice him to kiss it more the way Dean was swallowing hard again.
Castiel blinked. “What?”
“Alright. I’ll be calling the FBI analysts and cover it with the ORC.” Castiel pulled him in the glass shower, Dean giggling as he pressed on the hot water tap then groaning just as Castiel wrapped both arms around his waist from the back.
Dean rolled his eyes. Of course, Mr. Crowley saw he was on the news too.
“Everyone’s calling you ‘Cas’ now, huh? I still prefer Castiel. So are the rumors true, then? It’s a pet name from your boyfriend,” Adam said casually. Castiel dropped his notebook on the floor and stared at the guy with his jaw dropped.
“C-can you help me? Do you know what’s wrong with me?”
“Charlie, your hands are dirty. Get off.” Castiel’s ears were pink. He saw Dean wave at him again from the field as they returned the wheelbarrow that made him wonder exactly what they were. It hadn’t been a week but he was really enjoying Dean’s company. Dean was a very talented guy and Castiel knew everyone also liked him. He has this charisma that makes people huddle around him and he’s got chemistry with almost all the horses. He’s also really good looking which really adds up with his charming personality. All in all, Castiel was certain he’s harboring feelings for the guy. Whether Dean felt the same or was just teasing him—because apparently, nobody cared what your preferences here were as long as you were responsible and good at manual labor— Castiel wanted to be closer. But as days passed by and Castiel stayed with Dean, it felt like they didn’t know each other for just a week. It felt longer. The way they both just lights up at seeing the other, Castiel knew there’s something in there that was just waiting to be uncovered.
"Yeah, about that," Castiel offered with little hesitation, "Dean will be accepting the extra guards.” Dean rolled his eyes. Cas was bound to call on that.
"Good morning, grumpy."
“Oh, yeah, that.” Dean stopped with Cas outside the door, “You don’t need to worry about it, I already asked our seniors in the club to also check it out this afternoon. They said it’s only a hole and could be fixed before the pizza day. Oh, and I also spoke to my friend, Benny from the Forestry Department to prepare us firewood for the oven.”
Castiel’s eyes flashed and, in an instant, he manhandled Dean to switch position. Castiel leaned back on the headboard of the bed, Dean between his legs quicker than lightning. Castiel swallowed hard when Dean slid his head down, patted his cock adoringly and swallowed him whole.
Castiel stepped as carefully as he could like his movement would frighten the hunter. He couldn’t explain why he was doing it but seeing Dean there kneeling on the floor sent a pang of pain in his heart. What had happened in this memory?
“Oh,” Castiel quickly made his way towards it.
“Damn, rammed the pick up on the school wall,”
“No can do, I’m fully booked the very next day after tomorrow—"
"I got it!" one guy called and Dean watched a man with short black hair in his swimming trunks ran toward the area. The guy stopped and took the ball with both hands, and then looked at the people under the shade.
he groaned, thrusting in and out of the angel’s mouth so hot and for him to fuck like molten abyss of a hot volcano—the thought of having an angel to suck him—not just any angel but a commander of heaven—someone who saved him from the pit of hell, battled with him against the forces of heaven and now, finally—winning in the end and taking the angel with him in this glory bed.
Dean smacked his face with a palm.
“Well, unless said person is willing to help me on the farm—I mean, everyone here has a farm to run someday and we help our families at an early age. It has already become a hobby, you know? And our family’s farm got a huge loan to pay back so doing stuff with a girlfriend is just impossible. But Cas, I don’t really mind boy—"
Mr. Henricksen looked up at them with a no-nonsense attitude and asked, “Well, there are rumors involving the two of you. So, this really is more of confirmation first before we get to the other details.”
Sam’s expression doesn’t change but his lips visibly fall a little.
Dean’s jaw dropped. He couldn’t imagine Billy to be that of a character. Then again, he had the initial idea that the butler was a killer or something. He stared at Castiel who looked so down, he had never seen him that way before. He must be terribly worried about him.
“Oh,”
“Who wouldn’t be when we had to run one lap around the entire school that happened to be 45 kms in all?” Inias sighed heavily, “Everybody’s beaten down this week.”
Cas returned late to find Dean in the living room with open folders of their latest case as Castiel hung his trench coat on the stand. Dean’s eyes were glued on the file in his hand, multitasking with the television on playing a variety show that Cas never understood. It was one of those comedic segments that venture on human social conventions. Dean was nodding and chuckling at whatever the host was saying, but when he closed the door, Dean glanced up and broke into a smile.
Castiel gasped when he looked down and saw the result of his growing crush and drowned himself, trying not to think how the concept of ‘handyman’ just fit in those gay clips he’d glimpsed through friends on college. It didn’t help in his growing excitement.
“She threw this awesome Thanksgiving party—you should’ve seen it—but you don’t do tasting stuff anymore, right? But like I said, she was awesome. A little off with the merciless cleaning,
“I’ll go… I need to…” Sam began still looking shaky as he stood up. Dean unfolded his arms from where he sat by the table with Castiel adjacent to him. The older Winchester caught his brother’s eyes and didn’t say a thing. Castiel grit his teeth because he saw the exchange. Sam couldn’t look his older brother in the eyes, an old wound seared anew. Dean’s shoulders fell down once Sam, Jack and Eileen were gone. Castiel stayed. He will always stay with Dean.
“Cas…” the figure whimpered. The Dean on the floor suddenly slammed his fist repeatedly on the wall, “Come back…
Dr. Novak studied him for a second, “Only when I see the need of it.”
“No—"
“I’d prefer if there was no smell at all.”
“You’ll wait for me, Dean?”
Gabriel nodded. “Much like his brother, he tends to be specific with targets. In this case, those who were involved with his brother’s arrest, which means—”
“I want…oh— you’re making me want to piss—"
“You just gonna stare at that and wait for it to unlock itself? It’s 1967.” She crossed her arms while Dean glared at her and undid the lock, “You’re not asking how I know?”
Castiel waited.
“You’re a bigger asshole than I thought!” the words were out of his mouth before he could stop himself. Castiel didn’t look particularly perturbed. “Do I look like I’m throwing myself at you!?”
What did they see? The most horrific images that Castiel knew hunted them in their nightmares. He had his hands clasped together, but it was taking him a toll not to just grab Dean’s hand and give him a reassuring squeeze. He was also at loss on how to comfort the brothers, not after they saw glimpses of the past that had always haunted them in every waking hour. So, silence. Castiel knew at that time, silence could heal them.
“I don’t know him. His brother had become obsessed with me, he was possessive and when I tried breaking up, he became a stalker. That’s why I’m so relieved when he was caught—”
A beat next. Castiel only gaped at the handyman. Dean inclined his head to the back door.
This was a different world completely.
“You can wait till bed time, can’t you?”
“It must be hard being a handyman,” Castiel pushed a plate in Dean’s direction, “How do I make your coffee?”
Castiel gritted his teeth and opened his eyes. Dean was marvelous, impaled on him like that. His face was red and his mouth open with cheeks flushed, eyes rolling back his head as rammed in Cas in abandon.
“Just like I told you—look— this geoscope really is meant to see beyond our world. Mrs. Butters told m
“I think the hole’s somewhere up the ceiling, I’ve checked the walls, there’s no crack here.”
“I uh…” Dean didn’t say anything but instead flawlessly slid down the metal ladder and placed his drill down the nearest table before slowly facing him again. It surprised the accountant to find him looking a little uncomfortable. Castiel stopped drawing closer, taking pity on the man who apparently couldn’t stand his naked top. So maybe it was time for him to make another exit.
he gave Sam a sly smile, “It’s a
“Fine,” Castiel replied with a clenched jaw, “But I hope we weren’t going so fast,”
“Gavin, have you chosen a club yet?” Inias asked while walking in the mists with their breaths visible from the fog.
“Well, whatever you’re here, there’s probably a reason, right Cas?”
he inhaled sanity, eyes pure black, “But if it’s you… this body screams for you, I don’t know why… y’know, I tried fucking many people as I can but it won’t rub off the feel of your lips… you know what that means?”
“Not really—"
"Are you sure?"
“Really, where did you learn to flirt?” Dean declared to hide his embarrassment.
“You should rest down, I still wouldn’t recommend you getting up after you collapsed on me.”
“Why are you still here anyway? Don’t you have an apartment to stay?”
Castiel paused. How could he explain it to Sam? That everything, every place, every nook and corner in the world had its way of breathing life? In the case of objects and sentiments, in places, memories could form their own existence by merely being there.
“Wait a sec—Dean. I don’t understand what you mean by committed, okay? Let’s um… let’s get back in the house and talk about it more. If I understand your commitment well, maybe we’ll… we can come to an agreement.”
Dean glances once up—then glanced again. A jet ski sped by sharply, leaving a rainbow and a long line of ripples on the ocean blue. He looked back at Castiel watching it with an animated look on his face.
Barachiel closes his eyes, and Gabriel wishes he could too. "Anna..."
“The Morningstar made them.”
"No," Gabriel says at the same time as Barachiel.
Sam's in the living room, still pouring over books, and Dean is grateful for him. So damn grateful that he has a brother that he trusts even when he doesn't trust him. It didn't make sense but it wasn't something Dean could put in words.
“Okay.” Sam begins, around the food in his mouth, “Plans?”
"I do. Be safe Gabriel," Castiel tells him. There was a time when "Go with our Father's love" would have been said, but now...
Some of the tension seems to leech out of Gabriel. "Thanks." He takes a small taste of the stew, then eats a bigger spoonful.
"I am afraid I neglected to differentiate between formal and informal titles when teaching Elle introductions. She is addressing her lion most incorrectly."
Castiel will never understand the way Dean and Sam converse at times, but he feels a certain envy that he never had sibling with whom such insults were meant in affection not in truth.
did he know about Elle?!" Dean yells.
"Hey, you can't just come along and steal my nest!" He's almost sure there's a rule about that.
"Are you ready for me?" Cas asks in his ear. He always asks. Even when it's rough, even when Dean doesn't want him to ask.
“That is not what you said,” and Dean knows what Cas’ face looks like right now, even in the dark. “You said that cuddling was ‘girly shit’.”
The thudding at his front door comes again and he closes his eyes against it as he lays in  a sprawl face down on his bed. The salt lines were solid so even if something got past the gate it could go fuck itself until it was a decent hour in the morning. Nothing else was getting past the wards around the doorways and windows.
Dean represses a sigh and eases down on the bed beside him. "Here, my arms are getting tired," he shifts the sleeping baby, gold lion and all, into Cas' arms, then presses a kiss to Cas' throat.
Elle suddenly says something bright and happy in that other language, and waves her lion in the air. As if she had just come to a decision about Barachiel.
"That doesn't explain Anna..." Dean pushes. His fingers still rest against his mark.
"You know I have more reason to hate him than you, and I've gotten over it, mostly," Sam mutters. "I kinda understand the guy."
Something in his face must have betrayed him, because Sam's fingers encircled his wrist. "Want me to come help you be the welcoming committee?" Sam asks.
Shit, shit. There was only one 'Lord' for Remiel now and it sure as hell wasn't their Father. Castiel takes in a slow breath, but doesn't waver. He doesn't give Remiel that inch.
Sam starts to chuckle at the same time that Luc snorts and huffs. “My mattress is ruined, but I got all the books out.”
"Daddy!" Elle lets go of Castiel's shirt to try and walk towards Dean, but winds up falling on her bottom. Castiel is worried for a split second but Elle just giggles.
Sam should, by all rights, hate Gabriel. For all that he's done, not only to Dean and him, but to so many others. But he doesn't and part of him never really did. The part of him that liked the curve of that janitor's smile, the part of him that knew what lesson was trying to be taught, the part of him that felt sadness for the angel in the ring of fire. Gabriel is sharp edged, dangerous, cruel, with a twisted sense of humor and justice, but he's also loyal, kind, warm, protective of his family, and so loving that it leaves him broken. Sam wants both parts; the Trickster and the Archangel.
"I'm fine now," she breathes against him and lets him pull her against him as tightly as he can bear.
"Oh really?" Gabriel shoots him a glance that's all mischief and trickster, obviously picking up the reason behind all the "talking" going on in the house. "And just what did
"Do you like pie?" she asks, like she can't take him just looking at her and has to talk.
Dean doesn't say anything; his gaze is fixed on the floor and his shoulders set in a tense line. Dean looks -- shattered, wounded. Like a man that had prepared his home for a flood only to be taken unawares by a fire. "Cas,
Castiel shifts further up the bed. "No, he can't. You need wings to fly," he tells her in the same language. "Like birds."
"I only knew because Gabriel told me. As to how Gabriel knew, that is information best gleaned from Sam or Gabriel," Castiel says after a moment's pause. "You were happy, Dean, at peace. I did not want to disturb that. I had thought I'd have more time to tell you."
Robert sighs. "You can take some of the blankets out of the hall closet and haul him up to the barn. I don't want him attacking anyone in the house 'cause he doesn't know where he is."
He’s working up a profile on Incubi when Cas is there holding a wriggling Abe and frowning. It takes Dean a minutes to realize that Cas is both wearing shoes and a coat.
This is crazy, and Sam is grinning because angelic relationships were not something that he ever thought he'd be hearing about, much less be tangled up in. This conversation was crazy and still normal and... it was like... it was like having friends again. It was college again, when people only cared about who was sleeping with who and what day the midterm was. It was nice.
"Don't make this hard, Sammy," Jhudiel tells him patting his cheek. Then the angel's fingers dig in, force his jaw open. "Open wide."
"Do you want a kiss then, cupcake?" Gabriel asks, leaning down to give the little girl a kiss on her cheek. Sam watches out of the corner of his eye as Elle pats Gabriel's cheek. His heart clenches and he wants... he wants...
Oh, oh fuck. Dean thinks about it now. They wouldn’t even have to hurt her for Sam to... Just the thought of it turns his stomach. Slowly Dean nods.
There were other angels about, though most of them didn't pay him any mind. Most of them were in their glittering forms of space and power but there were a scattered few that were in vessels, and Barachiel had taken pains to blend in. Meaning he was in a suit with his hair slicked back and looked like a right twat.
Jhudiel moves the knife from Elle's skin. "And you'll say yes?"
Gabriel is angry, he's humming with power and Sam is still hanging onto it as hard as he can. He hates the dreams, he hates Lucifer's words, the feeling of helplessness, the lack of control. No one's ever pulled him out before.
“I do now,” Luc grouses over the sound of rain and Sam can’t help it, he starts cracking up.
"I'm going inside! I do not need this!" Barachiel scrambles up as Anna laughs.
“Traitor!”
Gabriel lets out a breath and shakes his head. "Good. I'd hate to have to go downstairs and slap Crowley awake to see if he knows how to heal a fallen."
“I am to train him?”
"He won't hurt her," Anna says with a raspy whisper. She doesn't look up. "Gabriel, please."
“I could... I mean... I... I can see about doing something.” Castiel stammers.
Gabriel lips curl into a smile. They've been courting for years now, whether Sam knew it or not, so Gabriel can take this slowly. He can let Sam set the pace and call the shots.
"Excuse me?" His voice is way too high and somewhere between panic and pissed off because he's stuck in between a really strange sickening mix of the two and can't get out.
Michael stands and Barachiel turns before he can say anything. He doesn't think that there's anything Michael can say to ease or erase this jagged feeling of helplessness, of loss. He doesn't know this person. He doesn't know anything anymore.
"Lies," Gabriel grins, slipping his fingers across the nape of Sam's neck. "Unless it's something good."
“I probably am. It’s probably because of that thing with the sheep and the whores.”
Gabriel sighs and then turns, shaking his head. "I think I have a bead on the last place Lucifer was having his little rave at. If what Remiel says is true then there's... There is a small possibility that Zachariah has done
Sam cracks a large yawn as if on cue. "It was a long night."
But then she goes silent, her hands tangling in her pockets. "This is an angel thing isn't it? This is the thing you said you weren't going to get involved in."
Gabriel sighs, snaps his fingers for another beer, and leans back with Sam. "You would know her as Anansi and, well, I don't think human tongues can pronounce her real name. Seems appropriate to start with her since she brought stories to the world before Dad had thought you lot up. "
Some part of Barachiel, some tiny part thought that heaven should probably have better security. Maybe some guards or wards or something. Honestly, he'd been thrown out of pubs for doing less than this. He made his way carefully through the shining city. That was pretty much the best representation of heaven as anything but light and sound. It was... It wasn't what Barachiel remembered. He remembered the light and laughter of heaven. The glorious warmth. This place was... different. He hadn't been back in years, after Gabriel had kipped off and Anael disappearing to Earth more often than not, there hadn't been a real reason to stay. Everyone got left to their own devices, maybe if he'd bloody paid more attention then Zachariah wouldn't have started this whole damn mess.
Cas' hand finally leaves his hip, gliding across Dean's stomach and chest, before palming Dean's cock. Dean arches into the touch, any breath he had to tell Cas to knock off the damn latin lost in a low, long sound of pleasure. Between his hand around Dean's cock and his fingers inside Dean, Cas sets a rhythm that sends pleasure shivering through Dean's veins in a way that Dean could bask in for hours.
"Don't worry, Sammy," Gabriel says, handing Sam a plate stacked high with pancakes. "I managed to rescue some from your brother."
“You think you’re just awesome, don’t you?” Dean grouses and Abe giggles.
"This is different!" Gabriel hissed, starting to seriously consider kicking Barachiel out now. Before this became a thing.
Dean takes a long swallow of beer then grins. "I think they were drunk." He remembers coming down the stairs and hearing his dad laughing. That's what makes the memory stand out, Dean thinks, his dad laughing. "It just sorta stuck. Me and Sam used to do it with coke bottle caps when we were kids."
Human.
Slowly Sam lets out a breath and wraps his hand around the center of the blade, and squeezes just a fraction of an inch. He feels the blade shift, just where he's touching it, going from a solid to... The metal slides through his fingers like water, like smoke before he's pulled his hand through it, unscathed.
Gabriel sighs and rolls his eyes. "Can we talk outside Raven? Preferably with clothes?"
“I lost my temper,” he frowns and Sam sighs.
had the most annoying habit of clinging and Gabriel hadn’t been able to put him down since his Father had handed him over. He shrieked every time he tried and just clung harder. Gabriel would end up losing a wing if he tried to pry him off.
"Really?" Sam deadpans, getting the expected 'okay, maybe more than once' shrug out of Gabriel before the angel turns and lets out a breath.
Moments pass where Gabriel is sincerely regretting ever telling the Winchesters who he was or letting Castiel find him again. He is far too old for the kind of passive aggressive bullshit that Remiel was famous for. He could get the humans in the panic room. Hell, he could get everyone out of here with a snap of his fingers. But that would just buy them time and he couldn't think of another place with as many pre-placed wards than Bobby's.
The late afternoon air is cool enough that it pricks Sam's skin and makes his lung burn like he'd inhaled mint. The wood porch creaks under his feet as he makes his way across it. He sits down heavily on the edge, and gazes out on the familiar shapes of Bobby and the angels. Gabriel's back is turned to Sam, but he focuses on the line of Gabriel's back, the surety in his skin showing in the way Gabriel moves.
But this child -- Gabriel lays the flat of his palm on her back. She's soft and warm, fragile. The baby's small body rises and falls as she breathes; she's fallen asleep against Gabriel's shoulder.
"I think it's relevant. We can tell Sam what not to do. Like let
Dean grins and Cas does that half smile he’s been doing more often that makes Dean forget whatever the hell he’s doing.
of you. My powers are too weak. If Gabriel had not come that night..." The fear had been like nothing else Castiel had ever known and it still haunted him, reminding him that he could never hope to fully protect his family from harm.
Gabriel is curled up behind Sam, idly nosing and kissing the edges of the mark he'd left while listening to the last of the rain trail off. The inside of the van is warm, the overhead light fixed now, and they'd ended up wrapped in the blankets he'd conjured.
That seems to make it okay then. Castiel totters over, crawls over Gabriel’s prone form, and sits himself in front of Anael. He lets himself be inspected, his wings looked at and his shadows smoothed down; Gabriel is just pleased that he’s letting another being beside him and their Father
"It's..." Then Gabriel hears it. Bickering. And he knows who it is.
She laughs again, a bright musical thing, "You silly angel, do you think your father would let me make anything he didn't want?" She turns back to the barn, waving her hand at him, "Silly thing, there's still rules and all to follow. Can't make the little ones without following the rules..."
The fledgling hiccups, but keeps crying.
Dean swallows, nods, trying to come up with something after that, still caught on the sound of Bobby's voice when there's a rattle of wooden bits behind him and the ever familiar sigh. Dean rolls his eyes and stands, tucking the baby against his side as Bobby follows him out to the living room. Cas has dragged the unassembled crib down, and is currently frowning at it like it's purpose in life is to cause him distress.
"You're joking," Sam pants.
The peace lasts for all of ten seconds before Barachiel is flopping down on the porch next to him, grinning like a fool. "Hello, hello."
"I swear to my Father," Jhudiel promises. "She will come to no harm."
to our laws? An abomination that should not -- cannot exist.” He steps across the pieces of the broken door, further into the room, and there's something slimy about the way he moves. Like a corrupt TV lawyer. The shadows, thankfully, stay on the other side of the threshold.
Sam wakes up, except he doesn't. He knows right away that while he fell asleep in the living room he didn't wake up in the same one. For example, all the books are gone and the floor is missing the telltale scuff marks. The mark on the wall from where he and Dean crashed into it while rough housing when he was nine is gone as well as the blankets and smells. It all looks far too clean, too unlived in... Too fake.
"They'll be getting my help whether they like it or not," Gabriel says with a sense of finality, looking meaningfully at the baby then Castiel. "There are some things I need to check on. You know how to call me if you need me, little brother."
"You're lucky we didn't eat them all, sleeping beauty," Dean tells him around a mouth full of food.
“Alright,” Castiel nods as he turns quietly back to his book leaving Dean wondering what question he just answered.
Castiel trembles with it.
So that’s what that noise was. Dean scoots around Abe who’s curled in a ball under one of Dean’s shirts. He’s not sure what he’s gonna say but he stops behind Cas, looking over his shoulder.
Dean opens the door at the end of the hall and steps aside. Okay, he was maybe stretching the truth when he said it was a library. What it actually happened to be was a storage room full of every old ass resource the other Hunters could give him. Books, manuscripts, scrolls, maps.
"I don't pout," Sam grumbles, sitting the book aside. He climbs off the couch, stretching as he does... and Gabriel always forgets how
“Come on, it’s bad enough when
Sam looks at Dean then at the baby. "Looks like this one is. Look, I know..."
Dean waits a few moments before he reaches down and scoops up the baby which lets out a ‘meep’. He puts him on the bed and watches him curl up in a ball. Dean is patient and he keeps his emotions under control, his mind blank and even.
“Yes,” Dean answers because whatever it is, it’s yes.
“We don’t need to drag him into this. We can wait.” Dean insists, steadily.
"Store. Sent him for supplies for the kid," Dean tells him as if that makes any sense in relation to Dean not wanting to name her.
the door yet is that he’d have to move them to work the knob. He's surprised they haven't gotten complaints yet; hell, he's surprised the cops haven't shown up.
"You didn't tell me it had gotten that bad. You told me..." Gabriel's voice is clipped and strained.
Dean reaches out and smooths Elle's messy hair then runs his fingers through Cas' before swallowing. He didn't want to bring this up but... "We need to talk."
"You don't know anything about this? About Lucifer?" Gabriel demands. "How could you miss the mess he's been making!?"
He doesn't want to think about how high up they must be or that he's never
"It..." Remiel clears his throat. "It doesn't keep Earth time."
"You covet him," Castiel says softly, measuring his words, worrying that Gabriel will not take kindly to them.
“You mean half of a new brother.” The Morningstar stands and frowns and then pokes Castiel who immediately goes still, “maybe a fourth. Why is he so small?”
"Decades, Michael," Barachiel stands straight and tries to not bite his lip. Michael is slow, listless, his grace is muted... Silence passes for far too long and Barachiel clears his throat without thinking about it. "Michael?"
Gabriel is talking over whimpers and tiny snuffles but it is when Michael appears in a flash of fire that Castiel starts to quite earnestly and loudly cry. Gabriel is shocked but secretly pleased as his brothers eyes widen and they all shuffle back.
Zachariah is talking about. Nobody talks about Sam's family like that.
Castiel nods, and tilts his head to the side, "Dean said we would need bottles, formula, diapers..."
Anna's mental cry is pained, panicked.
Shit, that just came out of his mouth.
Dean's shoulders jerk and he presses his face into Castiel's shoulder.
Cas mouth curves downwards. He runs his fingers over Elle's head. "As am I, Dean. As is our daughter." There's a hint of anger and disappointment there. "Gabriel is my brother. Barachiel is my brother. I trust them."
"And wait for the Winchesters to use me as target practice for that nifty gun of theirs that they
"Gabriel trusts him," Sam says softly. "He wouldn't let someone in that was going to hurt Cas or Elle."
She spins a bit before falling in a heap at Gabriel's feet and pointing at him from the ground, "You sir, are a spoilsport!"
Gabriel is standing on the porch watching Barachiel stalk the edges of Bobby's property, frowning here and there. Bobby had taken a good long look at Barachiel and then promptly kicked both the archangels out. Apparently if they kept breaking his wards they could damn well fix them when they were done. Gabriel had brought up the very good point that they didn't actually "break" anything, just sort of moved in between. It had been less then effective. Plus, he knew it was Bobby's way of protecting Elle, and Cas, and Sam, and Dean who still had that stick-up-his-ass look and hadn't said much the whole time Barach was in the house, at least to anyone that wasn't Sam or Cas. Honestly, it was like Cas had married some wide eyed housewife who hid from company, which was hysterical because Dean was loud, brash, and had no problem getting into people's faces -- he'd decked Zachariah for crying out loud. Gabriel was smiling at the thought when Barachiel broke the quiet.
Castiel hadn’t asked Dean this even though he could pick it up from Dean’s attitude. He just thought Dean was not into those kinds of relationships, but he was proven wrong.
Castiel glanced up, “I didn’t know I meant to him that much.”
“You haven’t been in touch with her again, have you?”
He has already started and looked forward to more.
Castiel blinked several times. He never expected this kind of view from a peer, especially Dean.
Then Dean was called Jack to make sure his other self was actually not too ‘God-like’ Chuck which ended up with Dean pacing around the room while Castiel took the time to talk to Sam.
The pigs were all still making a racket once they reached the pigpen and followed Castiel when he entered the enclosure. He grabbed the nearest brush and began scrubbing Ham’s cheeks. Ham settled its face on his palm, full of trust and, if Castiel would put a feeling to it, full of love.
