"Inspector Lestrade must have warned you that you were summoned because the ballistics established that the blow which killed Mr. Sherrer had been fired from the back-scene. There are certain precise seats where the shooter could have been sitting and these seats surrounded you. I'd like to know what you saw that evening, even if you have the impression you're repeating yourself."
John has an appointment at Scotland Yard at noon, to talk to Lestrade and a Swiss leader of the secret services about the surveillance of Moriarty these last months. Sherlock won't go, of course, because he doesn't see the point of such a meeting and, by the precision with which his darts touch the middle of Sherrer's forehead, John won't insist for him to join.
when he moves on it - like a clown with peep-peep hidden in his shoes. No wonder the kids of the neighbourhood laugh openly at his face.
There was Irene and then there was life, her enemy. She arrived, left, and everything is now back in its unmanageable and chaotic order. There was no other choice anyway. At least her head is still on her shoulders (which is much prettier that way, even the
"But Gra-Gregory!" called Sherlock, stopping right away by the oldest man's forefinger, raised like a threat between their two faces.
Lestrade frowns in compassion, and doesn’t dare utter a word until they reach Baker Street. He lets John get out of the car and tries to find parking place. He briefed him beforehand: the attack is to be kept secret not to scare the wits out of Mrs Hudson and their relatives, and John is certainly not going to complain about
"If only I had time to take care of it, I would resolve this case in a handful of minutes," Mycroft sighs in an unbearable theatrical gesture before relaxing a bit more on his chair.
John has to smile, which he ends up hiding by stretching his jaw, because he has two pairs of eyes on him-other than the crystalline ones-that are looking at him right now. But he will be damned if he will show that the feelings which are invading him right now, when Sherlock's addressing him and only him, as though there is nobody else on this damn Earth, might not be completely heterosexual. Steele tenses a bit when he hears that his girlfriend was flirting with another man - younger nevertheless, let's not forget that - but he still seems so eager to leave. Sherlock doesn't plan to stop there, though, because beyond the deduction, what he likes is to be the centre of attention.
And John knows that, really. But maybe it's because he doesn't want to wait anymore that he bends and touches the long cold shaft just one second before Sherlock catches it. The detective stands now, too, and it takes only one second for him to roll his fingers around the handle. Sharply, he lowers the crop and it slams with an indecent noise against the back of the doctor's hand.
"Why would she bother to wear a jumper that hot to hide a cervical collar? Plus, did you see the way she moves her head? That doesn't make any sense."
"Goodbye, Mycroft," John smiles one last time with a polite sign of the head before turning his heels.
The music comes from the end of the hallway and John’s eyes are too old to make him understand what is over there but he recognises a metallic construction and -
Because Sherlock Holmes didn't have to open his lips, but just stretch them to answer, and it was very clear to John Watson.
There's no noise in this warehouse but John doesn't feel peaceful at all. He doesn't understand this situation, doesn't want to be here, and doesn't want to hear that. He shakes his head despite himself and can't possibly explain how much he can't stop what's happening between Sherlock and him. Mycroft would not understand. Even John had trouble understanding.
"I thought you had more humor than that," the DI smiles widely, crushing his cigarette end on the ground.
"Sherlock..." laughs John, "You are telling me that Greg is actually in love. And even if you seem to like Elisa a lot, I have the impression that you are jealous that somebody nicked your friend."
"Some people find pleasure in loss of control, domination or pain, sometimes. Of course, it's frowned upon by society, hence, the members of these kinds of relationships are extremely discreet. So sometimes, a polo-neck is enough."
"The fact r-remains that you are obviously not eating a lot. Sometimes, when mom comes home late, we order Thai food. I can give you the number if you want, they deliver."
His shrink said that he had trust issues. Of course John Watson has trust issues, he knows better than anyone that we can trust no one. If he had not hesitated, before firing at the twenty-year-old Afghan kid who entered camp Bastion, lost in this intrusive and absurd war, he would never have given him the possibility to fire two bullets. The first one which landed in his own shoulder and the second in Matthew Rosemond's stomach. And that would never have happened if Matthew hadn't trusted him in the first place. John just knows that.
"I know what you're going to say, that it's the best thing to do, and maybe even tell me that this is the most respectable choice, right? Four months ago I would have believed you, but…" he smiles, shrugs, and explains in the most natural way possible, "that's not what I want."
The tall man stops all at once and John has to move back two steps to return to his level. He raises his small snub nose towards him and can only admire his upper smile.
"Philipp was a good man, indeed," answers Sherlock very seriously. "We cannot help wondering how this flat is going to survive without him - because it's clear with you always traveling all around Europe and you, incapable of even protecting yourself from getting jam all over your shirt, that you are not responsible for the perfect running of this flat."
The young woman breathes in, looks at the mirror for a long time (which she knows to be one-way) and eventually looks down before beginning her story:
“If you wish,” answers Sherlock, already seated on the bedside, testing how soft it is by basically bouncing.
"Wait, what does that mean?" asks John, stopping in the middle of the street, a hand resting on his forehead to protect himself from the sun.
"Why not? It's obviously not Sheri, she's already preparing a sham marriage; she wouldn't have done something that would have put the attention on her. And then you said it yourself: Jennings wouldn't do anything that would prevent him from seeing his son. The two other people who would have been able to fire, otherwise, are..." but John doesn't finish his sentence because he just has to look right in front of him to point to one of the potential suspects.
The sound of Watson's voice. A beacon calling him home from the darkness of the room and his already cloudy mind. Strong and yet soft at the same time.
“We need to cool him down. He's burning up”, John said as he placed his hand on Holmes' forehead. A fine layer of sweat had formed all over his body but even the liquid was warm to the touch. Like lava, John thought. A fine complement to Finn's ember eyes.
“You really didn't know?” he says again. But his words are lost on Sherlock. Sherlock is already making his way across the parking lot.......making his way to John.
John can definitely understand why. The display of magic he has witnessed tonight is something he hadn't even hoped to be seeing in his wildest dreams and, if he's being completely honest with himself, he still feels giddy with excitement as a strange buzz runs through his body.
The detective gives Sherlock one last stern look before he walks away with a brisk pace and disappears into the house beyond.
Or his skin that, if you really thought about it, had a complexion you'd actually never seen before on any living person.
'I've arranged for the two of you to meet at the library after rugby practice every week. Since you already have that afternoon off it will not interfere with your classes.'
The whole point in sneaking out was to find some kind of escape from them. If only for a little while.
Had they been fairies or mortals like Sherlock? With friends, families and lovers they now left behind? Had they ridden in the queen's consort of their own volition or had they been under the same spell as Sherlock had been?
“I've only brought it up”, he says in a conspiratorial whisper as he leans in close, “because I worry about you John. I worry about your grades.”
'So what does that mean for us?' he already knew the answer to this question as well and, however much he did not want to hear it, he still had to ask.
John shrugs as if that explains it even more and then he actually stretches out his hand towards Sherlock's face, twists a stray curl around his finger and tucks it back behind his ear before he casually brings his hand back to the cup of coffee he's currently drinking.
The moon shines through a crack in the curtains illuminating the half of the bed on which John Watson is currently sleeping.
In taking this day from him The All did not only take all that they had left of their mother from Mycroft but they had also stolen the chance to ever know her from Sherlock.
'Yes. I should have known right away. It would have been impossible for anyone mortal to sneak up on me like you did.'
) and he briefly mentions he feels like a maid clutching at flowers. I put this in because, in the original, Janet is, of course, a maid.
He is out of bed and the nurses have brought in an extra chair – probably because John asked politely and gave them another mesmerizing smile – so they can both sit at the small table by the window together.
He starts and stops speaking three times before he is able to get the words out. They stick to the lining of his mouth and throat like tar and his tongue does not seem to want to cooperate. The only reason he is still standing upright is John's strong arm slung around his waist.
The window closes automatically and the car starts to roll in the light traffic during the middle of day. The skirt of the new Anthea is so short that John's eyes lay on the unveiled skin one second too long. When he crosses the offending (and offended) look of the young woman, he quickly turns his face to look through the window.
SBSQ hits, literally, tens of thousands of views... and I got 50 reviews. As I repeated many times in the notes or even in my profile, I'm the kind of author that needs/likes/finds her strength in feedback/reviews/comments. I'm sure you already read this in plentiful of other introductions and it's true. We, as author, love to write, but some of us publish to have an interaction with the readers, to know what our readers like (or don't like! as long as the comments are respectful and the purpose is to help the author to improve her writing or some details of her plot :)).
"And the two hearts here, what is that supposed to mean?" asks John, putting his forefinger on two read hearts on the left side of the paper.
He sighs, stops cutting the carrots that his house keeper gave him into sticks, and goes to the lounge where his mobile is ringing.
The doctor gives an ironic laugh and puts a hand on his face but Sherlock is really serious. Then he asks, bewildered:
The detective doesn't answer, hands on the small metallic rail where he is held, eyes scanning those of the suspects. Lestrade apparently managed to convince Mrs. Cox to stay, because she's back in her chair next to her son, but both of them put on their jackets, ready to leave as soon as someone will give them the opportunity.
The place wasn't too hard to find; a quick glance on TripAdvisor and John guided the both of them on the city's heights. The house is kind of cool, concentrated on two levels, but the view is its real trump. From the shared living-room, you could see the sea and Skye. That damn island where they'll have to go tomorrow. Four days, it took four days for them to get there. It's shameful and John is certain Greg will make fun of them when he arrives. He’s occupied on another case; however, he told them he would come. It wasn't necessary, but he insisted.
Moriarty dramatically turns his back on him and walks on, nose pointing at the growing stars. John doesn't move, eyes going from Moriarty's back to Sherlock's eyes he's silently interrogating. Of course John won't leave, it's out of the question. He won't ever leave Sherlock behind. Sherlock opens his lips but he doesn't have time to talk because Moriarty is already grabbing his arm under his, pulling him on a walk around the balcony.
Anna Sanchez pinches her lips in such a controlled way that John can only mentally bow before the deductions of his friend; only women with tainted honour know how to hide their feelings.
"Mr. Steele is Sheri Walsh's lover. He was looking at her when Sherrer got shot. She quarreled with her sister during the interlude because she planned to present him to her, but in light of their altercation, which he witnessed, he thought it wiser to postpone the meeting. It's not new things Mr. Steele wanted to discover but his sister-in-law. If we forget the fact that she was hitting on you when you interrogated her, John, it's a very romantic story which we have there."
Once more the hand dove back inside the mist and when it came out again it was no longer a hand, but a wing....a wing attached to a bird made out of mist......John squinted his eyes again to try and make out what kind of bird it was. And as the bird separated itself from the low island of fog and actually took flight John could identify it quite clearly. It was a magpie. A magpie made of mist and as it passed in front of the sun its rays filtered straight through its ghost-like wings and body and John had to close his eyes to the blinding light. He only closed his eyes for a second, but when he opened them again the bird was gone. And so was the mist.
Only this time the body underneath his hands was positively on fire and the situation much more dire.
'This boy just got transferred to our school and he has very few friends', the headmaster continued. Still with that awful sympathetic look on his face. John felt like punching something, 'his grades are amazing though. I've never seen someone achieve such high scores in such a short amount of time. So I figured that while he helps you with your schoolwork, you might help him on a social level', the headmaster raised his eyebrows questioningly. Sympathetic smile not wavering one bit. 'Sounds good, right?'
"That's why I was over there," says Hendrik all of a sudden, raising his finger like a student who wants to take the floor. "I am a head carpenter for the company and we were preparing the stage in Brussels when I heard about... Philipp."
"Thanks, sir," says the teenager without a second glance, but John doesn't answer - how could he say something when the kid is slipping on his thin shoulders, without shivering, a
They separate their lips and it's by reflex that the doctor bends again to continue the kiss, but the detective's hands catch him by the shoulders and make him kneel again. He takes the blue box and puts it in the hands of his flatmate who opens it with trembling gestures. John would like to keep his eyes on the aluminum sleeve he has difficulty opening, but he cannot refrain from watching in front of him as Sherlock's fingers remove his belt and open the buttons of his pants before revealing black boxers which aren't enough to hide his desire. That lasts no more than one minute before Sherlock dims the useless boxers and frees his erection. John straightens up a bit on his knees before he's ready to put the condom on him.
John turns his head and the brown-haired man nods to make them understand that he'll be silent from now on. So, here they are; Anna Sanchez knows that Sherlock knows and John knows that Anna Sanchez knows that Sherlock knows, and everybody keeps silent about this adultery with as much lightness as a rural picnic during a sunny. God, how aristocratic families are difficult to manage...
"Steele, it's in your interest to tell us everything. Let me give you a piece of advice: I'm going to have to place you under custody if you ask for your lawyer and that will be recorded in your police record," explains Lestrade, decomposing every word to be sure the engineer understands the stakes in such a decision.
The detective breathes in loudly and John, up on the cliff, sees the wave of anger gathering near the boat where Sherlock heaves dangerously.
file is actually under construction. Information arrives in this file by the thousands every day, erases themselves, and complete each other or bump into each other, which often disrupts the hard drive. He tries to erase the
The same evening, when John wakes up after his twelfth nap of the day, there are exactly thirty-four bouquets in his bedroom, all made with different a flowers.
"Look at me, John." Sherlock repeats a bit more firmly. "Put your hands on my shoulders and do not leave them."
It's not only shock, it's also a monumental slap. There's also a certain discomfort which pins down John, because not only has he never, oh never, talked about sexuality with Sherlock Holmes, he's talked even less about BDSM. He slightly opens his lips, searches for something that he can say in the ocean of words like
"Regarding my shoulder which is killing me or the fear eating up my stomach you mean? Speaking of which, do you think we'll be back home before 10P.M, because I have medicines I need to take." the doctor smiles and it creates an echo to the detective's lips which are stretching too.
His small eyes go wide open before he looks at his flatmate, who seems as astonished as him in a dumbfounded manner. In the kitchen, the atmosphere is so embarrassing John can readily recognise the fragrance Holmes spreads every time he talks in public.
those long legs) before they leave the area. The speed limit is engraved in John's mind, but, oh how he would like to crush the accelerator pedal. He overtakes vehicles, weaves in and out, grunts between his closed teeth; his roommate's attitude and this bloody trip are enough reasons to make him want to shout. He yields after five miles, eyes glazed at the rear-view mirror; Sherlock's back in his black coat and sulking like a kid.
Actual John. Not the smell of his cologne that still only faintly lingers in the folds of his jacket.
'No one', he said, just a little bit too quickly he realized as he saw the smile widen on Her blood red lips.
“I've been doing drugs for quite a while now”, he says, “you can't be high that often and not pick a bit of enlightenment up along the way.”
“He's not worth it. Just leave him alone”, John says to Ben. I feel as if I'm drowning in ice-cold water.
We've got two seats next to each other and I've got the window seat while John sits next to the aisle.
His muscular arms and legs and sturdy frame....... chiseled like a Greek statue after years of playing rugby almost on a daily basis.
“So, a lot then”, not even a question anymore. Finn knows he's right. He's like that older, more experienced brother who always knows what kind of embarrassing secrets you're hiding and enjoys them far too much.
Sherlock instinctively turns his head toward his roommate sitting to his left. They are not gone for ten minutes before the detective already seems to have his full acceptance capabilities.
They briefly shake their heads while she wipes her tears with dignity and a trembling hand and breathes to take back her calm.
No, John would be angry, disappointed, sad, and even jealous. Sherlock still has much to learn about human relationships, but John's attitude in the presence of the Woman was the easiest to decipher. When the detective only saw Cartier earrings and red lipstick applied fourteen minutes earlier by an external assistance (a woman, given the precision of the brush on the lower lip), John only saw BoobsBreastsNipplesBoobsBoobs
There's one second of pure confusion, where only two violins and an oboe are still resonating in the odious mutism in which the room is suddenly plunged. The silence is a part of music, but this one is tinted with a deep red, overrunning the scene. John raises in his turn and the scream the harpist shouts out is the starting point of a long series of horrified cries from the first rows.
"That the bullet touched the back of the skull, of course we saw that ourselves. But if Sherrer wasn't looking at his score, he wasn't looking at the conductor either. John, what do you see in the horn?" asks Sherlock, pointing at the instrument. Even if this time the detective speaks with a clear voice, it's enough to stop the doctor's heartbeat, only one second.
) that he puts his hand on the scar which he cannot even cover as a whole. It's not specially cold or hot. It's there and it's already too much. That doesn't last for a long time; it seems Sherlock just wants to make sure that it well and truly exists before he moves closer to the armchair on which he takes his place again. Tilted forward, elbows pressed on his knees, he starts again:
"Ah, it's about time. Tell him that I've been kidnapped. No, he would be capable to think himself a real detective and to try to find me. Tell him that I died, we will save time. "
flower of course, I'm more specialised in wild flowers. I work very close, at the Greenwich park and today we received a new kind of
“Sherlock made me swear I’d bring you back as fast as possible. The hospital isn’t secure enough, which means you’ll get a nurse to care for you at Baker Street.  Aren’t you a lucky chap?”
"No," the detective answers very honestly, and it's officially the most bloody awful day of their lives.
But it's Christmas, so everybody is making an effort. This time, it's the dean who makes the ultimate sacrifice by not respecting the traditions. That will please Sherlock, who hates what is classic, and Mrs. Hudson adores to please Sherlock. She slowly stirs her immense wooden spoon in the sauce, which she's been simmering since the beginning of the afternoon, when the DI arrives in the kitchen.
Lestrade and Elisa are the first ones to leave. She's younger than him and a bit taller too, but they look so well together that John is slightly jealous, quite frankly. He doesn't know exactly how long it's been since he's had this kind of relationship with somebody, and a small very unpleasant voice murmurs at the bottom of his skull, "
"I see," Sherlock finally answers, and before John can reply he takes his hands out of his pockets and gets closer to the soldier.
The writing is delicate, the paper thin. Holding it in front of a ray of light, the transparency makes the reading difficult because the words written behind overlap those which John attempts to decipher. The letter is seven years old and if he gets ready to ask his flatmate if he's really obliged to read what he considers to be an intimate object, he stops when he feels Sherlock's hands unbuttoning the first buttons of his shirt.
"It was easier to reserve that way with Royal Concert Hall," she answers without any emotion in her voice.
"Oh my God," spat John when the door had definitely closed behind the object of all their nightmares.
"Do you remember that picture you observed the first time we went to Sherrer's place? He was wearing a beige costume with branches sewn on it and a leaf crown? He was interpreting Pyramus in
"Would you let me blindfold your eyes? Would you let me undress you completely, in the middle of the living-room, in broad daylight?"
"You all believe I'm guilty," the man spits when Sally's inquisitive eyes disappear behind the door. "I know that I shouldn't have left after the concert but I didn't kill this man. If I had really killed him, do you think that I would have told you the day I was coming back to London? And then, do you think that I would have returned?"
"Precisely," Sherlock grants, pointing his finger at the doctor for one second before repositioning his hands on his back. "That's the worst part of this story, by the way."
"My room, my bedroom," John repeats, because God how he's afraid of not being understood, and that makes Sherlock smile with an impertinent tenderness.
"What? She doesn't care about the surprise, she isn't invited, right? But don't worry, I'll mime a completely amazed face when you, Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and Lestrade shout
"We met Elisa during a case a few years ago. She works in a luxury hotel where there had been a murder and we went to question her."
Sheri Walsh lied. It's what John repeats in his head, his thumb against the plastic tip of his pen which he's constantly pressing on. She had nevertheless something so soft, so fragile, something which had woken the instinct of the ex-soldier, like a need to protect her.
The face is the same, undeniably, but all of it looks like an empty shell, a bottomless pit that gives John vertigo. He puts his hand on his face, rubs it, and breathes with difficulty. So here they are, and the police were right, and nothing has ever been so tough. There are tears that are trying to flow but the hardness is so big that all his body refuses any gesture, any expression. His reflexes that got him back from Afghanistan push him to worry about the only thing that really matters:
“Yes, my ex-wife’s name. I was taking his clothes off and the kept chattering about hormones we were about to develop or another stupid thing like this. I was trying to make him shut up when that Freudian slip happened.”
Lestrade opens but immediately goes out of his office to greet the newcomer. He explains, lowering his voice:
Everything in his gestures betrays unease in such an obvious way that it's fascinating. John's seated, too, and takes by mimicry the same position as the suspect, but his legs don't tremble. There's only the DI who's left standing; Sherlock's in front of Steele and he's looking straight in his eyes, a shade of a smile covering his lips. He hasn't said a word since they entered the room, and John has the sensation that his friend is taking his time. Why don't they put Steele in jail already...
) but it's a new level now and even if it's clear that the brown-haired man acted to prevent John from speaking, the doctor cannot ignore the thumb which caresses his denim for one second.
"Sherlock !" calls Lestrade, raising his voice. "Before we find the people who were seated in those damn seats, I'm prohibiting you to talk about the murder at Molly's birthday tomorrow, are we clear?"
"Hello, I'm John Watson," he comes to greet them with a tilt of the head, before taking support awkwardly against a shelf because no more chairs are free in the room.
John opens his eyes and maybe they're so red because he had them closed with such strength that Sherlock's shoulders tighten, but it's especially because Sherlock
"Of course they will. They'll say you have a good taste in music but they'll criticise without any doubts the jumper you'll choose to wear that night."
"Seven years ago I was working for a modest production of A Midsummer Night's dream, and Philipp was playing in it," answers Bill, analysed by the other three men in the room. "We stayed in contact and then four... no, three years ago, Marina and I were searching for a new flatmate so I gave him a call and... well, he came right away."
“Well, people say I'm a sociopath that gets off on crime scenes; that one day, dead by boredom, I'll commit myself a murder to pass the time; that I can't feel the tiniest emotion; and that I'm a freak. Tell me, John, does that seem awful enough for you?”
Sherlock's smile is so soft and confident, the older man has the nasty impression he's the one who lost, without even knowing why. He shakes his head, slightly opens his lips to say something but nothing comes out, so Sherlock starts again:
“Sherlock, John, I have to get back to Scotland Yard. Call me if you discover anything new about Moriarty, all right?” Lestrade says, standing next to them.
Sherlock unbuttons his suit jacket vest and gives away a delighted smile which provokes the doctor right the opposite.
"I heard that you are finally on the track of the musician's murderer – well, suicide I should say."
The doctor doesn't even have the time to let the hair on his arm ruffle when the forensic team, accompanied by Sherlock, come to meet them. The brunet is still wearing his coat even though it's not cold and John pertinently knows he's keeping it to differentiate himself from the rest of the inspectors around him. The ex-soldier doesn't really know why this coat has a space so big, but when Sherlock puts it on, the mouths go silent and the eyes open wide. It's like a super hero costume and even if the detective has nothing to do with Batman, at least they share the sense of the dramatization and they both provoke snobby fear. It's both completely ridiculous and totally effective.
Sherlock raises eyes to the sky again, dangerously close to the eye cramp, and moves closer to John near the door, ready to leave as soon as they can. The ex-soldier crosses his hands in front of him and rocks from his heels up to the point of his feet before murmuring to Sherlock:
"Well, of course I've adopted you, two kids like you without any family to spend Christmas with, I wasn't going to allow that!" Mrs. Hudson is deceitfully outraged before winking at John, who asks quite immediately:
The smell is persistent. That's what wakes him up. He needs to hurl. He opens his eyes again and it's still dark. Everything is so wet. And cold. He's still lying on the ground and this time he understands what his body is squeezing: hundreds of purple flowers surrounding him. How ironic.
He moves back from the wall as if he has just been burned and finally realises that he's the author of the noise. It's simply his beating heart.
"It's Greg. I had to go to my place first to take a shower -it's the second time a jerk pissed on me this week- I'll be there in 10 minutes. He's not there yet?"
John may be filled with corticoide he still thinks about the detective only and about the meeting that is probably taking place right now with his brother. He’s thinking about all of this mess when Mrs. Houdson’s voice become suddenly strident and says the only word the doctor was waiting for:
They've only met once before....very briefly....Sherlock had been drunk.....Mycroft had been cold and snarky......not much has changed in that regard.
He dips the sponge back into the water, rinses it out and then brings it back up so he can clean his lower abdomen as well.
My mother actually lets him stay in my room. She doesn't even bring out the air mattress. She just gives him one of my t-shirts and lets him sleep in my bed with me.
“John?” he says. At the mention of his name John doesn't open his eyes or turn his head, but his eyebrows do lift slightly as he waits for Sherlock to continue, “when did you know......”, Sherlock hazards, “about me......us......”
Deconstructing him piece by piece until there is nothing left only to rebuild him on the other side. All in the blink of an eye.
Mycroft is about to say something more but then something else catches his attention. Something behind Sherlock.
Trust John to see it the other way around. To see the good in him. To see what he was capable of and not.....what he couldn't do.
Just the other day Andrew had been telling me that the way John is treating me is not fair on me, that it's not as complicated as he makes it all seem, that John really should come out, that Andrew wishes
“Holmes!” slightly louder this time. Now Holmes does turn around to look at him. As John waves the bracelet at him his eyes go large. Definitely Miss Hooper's then. John has only met her for a brief moment but she struck him as a clever young lady. There is more to her than meets the eye. She is like an ocean. Hiding deep secrets that none of us may ever discover because diving to the depths where they reside will lead to one's own undoing.
“Well, I should get back inside. Lots of chores to do”, Mary says then. There is still a smile on her face but somehow it seems just a little bit less sincere than before. “See you this evening? I have a
John does catch him looking this time and whatever it is he sees on Sherlock's face makes his smile turn just a bit wider.
'He was a good guy....when he was sober at least.....I miss him so much' a half-sigh, half broken off sob followed and Sherlock pulled John just a little bit closer.
There are sounds of boots being removed, a necktie being undone, a jacket being cast aside....a heavy sigh.....but no words are spoken in the darkness that covers them both.
Sherlock actually manages to roll his eyes at this reply and he feels a small sense of pride. The feeling only diminished by the air of uncomfortableness that seems to be radiating off of Watson.
Its nature or purpose, if there even was any, a mystery to all but Holmes himself and he was not speaking. His posture stiff as he stared dead ahead at the road before them. His dark curls still wet with dew as an inscrutable look lay on his face.
There is snow falling outside my bedroom-window and the light of the moon is reflected off of the pristine thick white dusting it leaves behind on everything outside and because of it my room is a lot brighter than it should be at this time of night.
'Oh, no need, Watson', suddenly Holmes' tone of voice was cheery again and John felt a little bit more comfortable.
For a moment I feel as if we're spies having a covert meeting on a bus-stop bench. Pretending not to know each-other while in fact we do.
“To the King....of course”, the dark man says, “he wants this girl and whatever he wants....he gets.......I'd lay low if I were you, Holmes.....he might decide he wants you too.......or your friend.”
“I brought these for you”, he says as he extends the flowers towards Sherlock, “didn't seem right coming here empty handed.”
He throws his sheets to the floor one final time and, in nothing but his boxers, he makes his way to the window where he gingerly pulls the curtains to the side.
Sherlock remains quiet. He doesn't quite know what to say to this. Doesn't know where John is going with this exactly.
For a second John didn't know how to answer, a thousand and one possibilities swimming through his mind, but then Sherlock decided to elaborate a bit further. Making coming up with the right answer much easier:
His eyes eclipsed and his easy smile hidden and shuttered away behind the tense and closed line of his lips.
And not knowing where he is....or if he's safe at all.....thinking about it too much makes Sherlock hot and cold at the same time, it makes his skin tingle and break out in goosebumps, it makes him sweat and his heart race and, apparently, it makes him pack gaudy outfits.
Watson had given Holmes a rather incredulous look here. Finn had been slightly impressed with the man. Withstanding Holmes' fury was not always easy.
“.....You have no idea how gorgeous you are like this.....”, written by his fingers as they make their way underneath my shirt.
It's why he spent so many years in a relationship with a woman that had no future because he thought she would be better for it.
The shirt is a little bit on the tight side and when Sherlock had come out of the dressing room and John had first caught sight of him in it he had only barely been able to suppress the urge to pull Sherlock against him again and kiss him all over.
Sherlock gives him a curt nod. It's all he is able to do at the moment. Had he thought being forced to spend the day without John was distracting, he now finds that being in close proximity to him is equally so.
I don't want him to answer because I know that with just one word he is more than likely to persuade me to stay.
Sherlock really hoped that the fact she had only been able to get a small glimpse would delay her just enough for him to take actions to protect John. Keep him safe.
My mother's long and elegant fingers just gently stroke the curls at the back of my  neck just as she used to do when I was younger and needed calming down, when I'd fallen from a tree or got called a bad name at school or, much later, when I used to wake up from the same nightmare night after night after night....
For a second my heart and chest heat up with unfounded hope but then I realize Andrew now has my number too.
“It's been a while”, John says. His voice is deep and masculine. Just like the rest of him. Sherlock feels himself heating up from the inside even more. It feels as if he's coming to life. Like a garden in spring.
'The armies of the North',  he had whispered. More to himself than as an actual reply, but Holmes had heard him nonetheless.
Another couple of moment pass in silence. There is no music because, just like the mirror, the radio in John's car is also broken and, unlike the mirror, a bit of duct-tape will not be able to fix it.
Back then I thought that, despite my youthful appearance and perfect health, I would surely follow you soon.
It will only be the sole moment in his life that will ruin him forever and at the same time make him more than he he has ever been.
As the voices continued talking the sound of barking dogs could now also be heard. As if the creatures had just spontaneously formed out of the mysterious mist that had not lessened one bit during the day and still hung low across the field.
He wasn't sure why, after all their encounter had been very brief and Holmes had been unconscious for the most of it, but somehow Master Holmes hadn't stricken him as the type of person who would lead such a frivolous lifestyle.
John and his older sister Harriet. Or Harry, as she preferred to be called. His mother had always berated his sister for the nickname. “You are not a boy, Harriet”, she used to say as Harriet just rolled her eyes and his father chuckled from behind his newspaper.
The sun still shines down on them brightly, the water of the lake a gentle soothing rhythm in the background as a small breeze moves it along. There are birds singing. The sand underneath their backs is cool and soft.
As the door slowly swung open John glanced inside. His bed had decidedly been slept in, but Master Holmes was gone.
He was only at the start of his summer break. By teenager logic the days should feel as if they stretched out before him endlessly. More hours of daylight than he could possibly find a use for.
He seems to have forgotten all about leaving again as Sherlock sits up straight against the headboard at their backs.
He has offered me a role as a sort of 'teacher's assistant'  where I stay behind after school on some days and help him set up experiments for the next day.
It reminded John of his dream of last night and he shivered as he pulled his jacket closer around him.
Someone is giggling and faintly Sherlock realizes it's him. It doesn't matter because all too soon John's hungry lips and tongue steal the sound from his mouth and it becomes something that belongs to the both of them.
What if, when the light of day shines harshly on the events of tonight, Holmes realizes he's let himself go just a bit.
The sip of tea he was taking turns into a panicked gulp and he ends up doubled over coughing trying to get the liquid out of his trachea again.
Sherlock looks stunned. His blue eyes wide. His lips slightly parted. Neither of them speak for what seems like an eternity.
I am planning to turn this into a series and add other instalments. The main story is just over...for now.
“I wasn't sure”, he replies as he rakes his hand through his hair once again. Sherlock just wishes he would stop doing that, “It is a bit of an odd name.”
He lifts me with a graceful ease that does weird things to my pelvic region and sits me down on the sink.
My mother is very free in her upbringing but if there's one thing she will not budge on it's curfews.
But now that the hottest hours of the day had arrived they found themselves quite drained and so they had decided to just lie down for a bit and let the warmth of the sun dry their bodies and let it do all the work for them.
“You're leaving tonight”, John says. Not a question. Just stating the obvious. John's voice is not shaky or insecure. It rings out like a bell in the quiet of the hall around them.
In his dream the sun is just starting to rise and a soft beam of light filters through a crack in the curtains. Just as it is doing right now, in the waking world.
As day turned into night John was finding it harder and harder to separate dream from reality and he could not get the crocodile to leave for the life of him.
Men who just wanted to take from him without giving anything in return. Not even something as simple as a name.
He needs a covert meeting on a bus-stop bench, the hood of his sweater drawn up so high I'm surprised he had still been able to see, just to muster up the courage to even speak to me.
John doesn't speak. He just stares ahead and takes another sip of his whiskey. He manages to look slightly embarrassed as he does so.
Sherlock moving inside of him, the passage made easier by John's natural lubricant, his thighs drenched in it as his lust rose and rose every time Sherlock so much as touched his body.
He wrestles himself free from my arms and even though he had been freezing I feel colder still without him.
“There is no bird on this card, Sherlock. Just a dark king. Now will you please stop fooling around so we can finally get this right?”
“I'm so sorry”, she says again, “but John might come around. Maybe he just needs a little more time. I know he cares for you too.”
He opens his eyes now. The world is spinning around him and he feels as if the bleachers have fallen away from beneath his feet. As if he is caught in a free-fall without end.
This time Sherlock does sigh. Audibly and quite theatrically. It gives him a sense of satisfaction, however small.
Like Watson, Sherlock holds it in his outstretched palm and, as before, a whole lot of nothing continues to happen.
Sherlock feels his cheeks heating up as a fairly recent sensation rears its head in his lower abdomen.
But he had just wanted to.......he doesn't know what it is he had wanted.......all he sees now is red when he thinks back on the afternoon.
They have an armour around them built up out of years of sarcasm and spite. If it were to crack now who knows what kind of emotions would come flooding back out.
I'm pretty sure that at this point a normal person would have told her she is beautiful the way she is and that Greg's missing out and all that nonsense but I am not normal and I have never been good at smalltalk or making friends and before John I had never even been kissed and I might not ever get kissed again because John will not even look at me.
John is talking and smiling and with his appearance some kind of weight seems to fall away from the pit of my stomach but I have no idea how it even got there in the first place.
There is genuine concern in his brother's voice. Sherlock was not expecting that and he doesn't know how to respond to it. He's used to throwing insults at his brother and getting insults back in return. They don't do “caring”.....that's not them....might have been them once......years ago....but not now.
Miniature stars that drift on some unseen airflow out the window into the dark of the night to  mingle with their celestial counterparts.
John and Sherlock continue to make their way towards the large house where Molly Hooper and Finn have already disappeared inside again.
'Watson?' Holmes tone was uncertain. Questioning. John had not realized he had lost himself in thought so readily.
His hands tighten in my hair and he pulls, it almost hurts but just before it does his mouth is on me and soothes away any pain, on the corner of my jaw, my neck, the hollow at the bottom of my throat, leaving behind a trail of warm wetness and I feel myself sinking away in a pool of bliss.
'If you want to know what I saw you need to give me a little bit more information than that',  he was trying his luck and he knew it, but he had to know.
So, for now, when they are around other people, they pretend to be best friends again. They leave the kissing and touching for the moments where nobody can see them. For when they're truly alone. Keep all of this as private and intimate a thing as they both feel it is.
The dark man has dragged her from her seat at the table across the ballroom all the way to the doors that lead outside without any of the other guests even batting an eye.
John turns himself back facing forward and shakes his head in an attempt to clear it from the cobwebs of some unnamed dread. He only half succeeds. Suddenly the sun doesn't seem quite as warm anymore.
Mycroft liked it here. Sherlock has hated these halls from the moment he first stepped foot in them.
He rubs the back of his neck just as he had done when I first saw him this evening and his shirt rides up slightly revealing a sliver of his abdomen.
After a minute or so my sobs quiet down just a bit and John releases the hold he has on me somewhat. Just enough so he can place a gentle finger under my chin, lift my face and look in my eyes.
But all too soon Watson sits up straight. His face and neck are slightly flushed, his pupils dilated and, for the life of him, Sherlock cannot figure out why he has stopped his ministrations.
Things only got worse when, after about a month or three,  the slow and steady swell of John's belly started to become apparent.
Sherlock was leaning against the wall of a closed down bank building. Shoulders slightly hunched, coat collar turned up and the walls around his personality perfectly back in place. He was smoking a cigarette.
is what he had said to her back then. When she had looked up at him with hopeful eyes and had asked him if he could ever love her.
At least that settled what he had to now. He had to find out where Holmes was bleeding and stop it before he bled to death right here on the barn floor.
“I know where he is.....it's not far......he's only just left with her”, Holmes says, “come on, Watson! We can still catch him!”
It really had been nice to see Sherlock and the soldier again. There had been a part of Molly that had thought the last time she would see them was when they had rescued her from the Dark Man in the top hat.
The sky around us grows darker and darker as the sun dips below the horizon, pouring out her honeyed, heavy light into the sea where it gets swallowed by the waves.
And then Sherlock's lips are on his again and then he moves them away, to the corners of John's mouth, to his cheeks, he kisses each eyelid and then.....saved for the very last....he kisses that place at the bottom of John's throat.
If she were able to figure out who John was she would stop at nothing to get to him. If John was lucky she would just kill him, but she would most likely do something far, far worse.
He should  know better by now. His step-mother is like a bloodhound. Once she is on the scent she will not give up.
John takes a small sip from his tea then. Only because he doesn't know what else to do with this sudden revelation. The liquid tastes as bitter as bile as it goes down his throat.
Somehow his mind wandered back to the last time he had been talking to Sherlock so late at night. In the darkness of his own bedroom
And, even though the sun still shines just as bright as it has been doing the entire day,  Sherlock suddenly feels cold.
If he makes sure he arrives to class last and leaves first he can avoid having to interact with John at all.
My lips tingle, my hair's a mess from where John's fingers have pulled and tugged on it and there's this surging warmth in my chest whenever I look at him which makes it really hard for me not to just pull him tight against me again and never let him go.
“Right, Molls?”, John shouts at  Molly once he locates her standing nearby. Stuffing her copy of “A Midsummer Night's Dream” in her bag.
Even though the moon has drifted back behind the clouds Sherlock can still clearly see the grin on John's face. He feels his own skin breaking out in goosebumps but, somehow, he doesn't feel any cooler for it.
the One to activate the weapon....if this is what you do to my magic.....imagine what it could do with the medallion.”
Sometimes galloping across the open terrain as fast as he could, his horse's nostrils flaring as both their breaths became labored. Forming clouds of hot steam as the cold early morning air stung his face and John laughed until his lungs hurt.
Another pulse from the lights of the ambulance outside illuminates the room and, as if on cue, Sherlock blinks his ocean deep eyes and takes a gasping breath.
He did bring a book to read but it's currently tucked away safely in his bag....In the overhead compartment....and he is definitely
John sighed and rolled his eyes, but he couldn't help smiling. Mary was a good friend and he could do with a bit of food. 'Alright then. Lead the way.'
And when his back hits the mattress on his small bed again he closes his eyes and decides to forget about the future and what's to come just for this moment and lets himself get swept away by it.
He felt tense and on edge. Partly because of his mother's fiery tirade, but also because of the events of that afternoon.
This time, however, his breathing was nice and even, the look on his face gentle and calm and when John laid a hand on his forehead the burning fire that had been there before seemed to have been quenched.
His cloak, coat and shirt were gone at least. Before going to sleep last night he had left them on the chair Holmes had sat on. The chair was empty now.
Not the countless hallways paved with gray stone tiles, their walls lined with heavy wooden doors, nor the candles held up by silver candlesticks all spaced exactly 10 feet apart along the green wallpapered walls that illuminated his path.
'We used to be called Night-Elves, but folklore now associates that name with small goblins with wings.'
Somewhere, behind the fog, Holmes moans, his eyes shooting blue blinding fire before he closes them.
He finds he's having a hard time expressing everything that's in his heart and mind and so he just waves his hand around again helplessly and says:
It was as if the wind itself had frozen too. Fallen victim to the unforgiving arctic night, laying low somewhere deep underground, only returning to breathe life into the world when the days started lengthening once more.
All those meetings over the summer had just sort of.....happened. None of it had been planned. We had never given it a name.
As the sky darkened around them all kinds of light sources were being kindled inside the houses and buildings lining the road as they passed by.
He wishes he could make Mycroft see....make him understand....but there is no time. Not enough time....the clock in the other room ticks on inexorably.
Once they dared being close and intimate with each other again they also found it very hard to stop.
He hasn't felt the need to correct them and John, for whatever reason, doesn't really seem to be too bothered by it either.....
Sherlock kicks back the blankets from his body violently and let's the cool morning air wake him up entirely.
While Mycroft reads, his brow creased, faint lines drawn in the fair skin of his face, flipping pages back and forth, making notes every couple of minutes, Finn sits underneath a large birch tree.
'John', the word was spoken soft, privately, an attempt to keep Sherlock from overhearing, 'put in a good word with the Holmes family for me.'
“You shouldn't let what father says get to you so much”, Mycroft continues, “caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.”
And if he does want to find a solution to their situation he might as well look at the problem from any possible angle.
He can only imagine what the man thought of him when he awoke and found the bed beside him empty save for a hastily written note.
They're like sunshine in human form. The sight of them makes him feel warm all over and tingly and slightly dizzy.
“I understand”, John says, “it's okay, I'm not mad. I'm going to miss you too.......terribly.......but we'll be alright..........sssssssh.......we'll be alright.”
And I know I probably shouldn't tell her but if John won't talk to me then I need to find someone else who will because keeping all of this inside is slowly killing me and Molly
“You can't be serious....”, he says, but the stern expression on Holmes' face tells him that he very much is.
He smiles at me sheepishly as he pulls away from me and my heart tightens painfully at the sight of it.
The howling winds that have been wracking his mind and nerves have temporarily gone down and he finds it easier to think.
“You know that hiding me....us.....away here isn't the answer, right? Whoever or whatever is after us and what we can do will not just stop looking because we've decided to go home. You do know that right?”
He flung his arm forward again, releasing the dagger, flinging it towards the rider with the red rose.
The pain is so severe that he finds himself buckling over and his mouth goes dry as bile rises from his stomach.
Nothing for it now. Sherlock decides to just plough on ahead. The sooner he gets this over with the sooner he can either try and start forgetting about how he ever thought John would like him or , the far more unlikely outcome of this scenario, he can be just a bit more sure that John has a crush on him.
The cracks in Sherlock's heart and chest widen. A sudden pang sears through his chest. John cannot be saying these kinds of things if he doesn't mean them.
So John was indeed very surprised when, one early Thursday morning, just as he was about to head outside, he once again found Holmes standing in the stables.
'The air is wet?' Mycrofts eyebrows had lifted as another small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth taking off at least five years.
In front of him a large map was splayed out on the desk, but every time he tried to focus on it he found his mind wandering to the last conversation he and Finn had had:
“Then you'll be going alone”, Holmes replied, “and without me you'll be useless there. You need me and my magic to draw upon.”
He was thinking about something just now.....something important......but his train of thought seems to just be.....gone.....
“I'm sorry I stared at you”, he says, “You probably think I'm some kind of creep....but...I'm really not.....I'm just.....you're just.....very good.....at this.....at dancing.”
“Fine! Ignore me then!”, Mary sounded positively irate, “I'm going home and I'm going to sleep. Don't expect me to let you in when you come knocking later.”
Sherlock nods, bites his lip and cast his eyes down to where his fingers currently are busy tracing the seams of the couch.
I don't know what he's thinking. Why he thinks I left him there. Maybe he thinks I didn't care. But I did care. I just cared too much. That's the problem. That's always the problem.
John hasn't missed a single one of their post-class practice sessions. And every single time he's asked Sherlock to come along.
'Not enough apparently',  John replied. His arms crossed and his posture defensive although he had been somewhat flattered by Holmes admission of his trust in him.
There is an amused smile on John's lips. It's effect exacerbated by the deep shadows the flickering flames cast in the folds of his face.
The fact that Baker Street's first floor needs to be tidied up, that's a sine qua non constant that no reasonable human being would come to question. But the fact that what needs to be cleaned are wineglasses and empty snacks wrapping, that's rarer.
He clicks on it, too far gone to stop there, and the video launches, in a website surrounded with small miniatures of very ambiguous images which he doesn't even notice.
He barely has time to open his lips again before Sherlock takes a step forward and they're so close the tip of their shoes touch and Sherlock's head is enough to prevent John's face from getting hit by the sun.
"We questioned them this week. Of course, nobody saw a thing; no weapon, either. In short, we are at a standstill. The ballistics' report cannot help us more. According to if Sherrer was reading the score or was following Denosa, the inclination of his head doesn't allow us to establish exactly where the shot was fired from. Of course, all the suspects remain under surveillance and can't leave the country, but if you could take care of that quickly, that would help us a lot - with
"Well, we are flatmates, as you may know," he answers with more animosity than he wants to let appear.
Sherlock looked at him getting up, replacing his mistreated jumper under the parka and put his mobile back in his pocket. There they were, alone and despite the Semtex, the guns and the little red dancing dots on their chests, they were alive, so everything was fine. With a hand cold for staying too long on the tile, John massaged his neck with his head hanging back, his eyes wide open, staring at a crackling light bulb he hadn't noticed before. Sherlock probably detected it as soon as he entered the pool. Because Sherlock Holmes was always seeing everything by dint of observing shamelessly, exactly as he was doing now, scrutinising John's face as if it was a common bacterium placed under his microscope.
"And in your Mind Palace there are also videotapes constituting the back-stage?" asks John, an amazed smile on his lips.
And that damn smile is still there. Discreet, but there. John would like to rip it off with his own lips. The room is cold but nobody really cares. The receptionist puts the notebook he keeps against his chest and comes closer to the laid down body still wrapped in a black plastic bag.
Hi everyone! Thank you for the last reviews, kudos and bookmarks, you guys are the best :) Of course I can't publish anything without saying a HUGE thank you to my amazing beta
At his feet, the doctor looks at the horn which the policemen put down, then farther up to two musicians with their arms crossed, looking at Sherlock with challenge while some of the violinists seem to stop even if their scores continue. Nevertheless, the music accelerates, catches the air for it alone, selfish thing that it is, until it pulls all the air outside of the soldier's lungs, who suffocates and suddenly stands up:
It's in all the newspapers, on TV, and everywhere on the Internet: Philipp Sherrer, 37 years old, horn player at the Royal London Orchestra, was killed during a performance, in front of hundreds of witnesses, and his murderer is still unknown.
And maybe it's because of the lady's perfectly managed hip movements but John feels subjugated, aspirated. She doesn't see him, for sure she doesn't even know he exists, but there's something about her that attracts him like a hook that's gotten under his skin and that he knows would get him out of the calm and gentle water that he's hiding in. Little by little, the pub disappears; the coarse laughs, the alcohol and sweat, until there's only the woman and her hips left. She moves and moves again, hypnotises the doctor and it makes him want to see more. It's not sexual, it's not her body he wants to discover, but what she's
"Yes, I heard on the radio it hasn't been this hot since October 1891..." answers John, tightening his hand around his beer.
, suddenly very quiet, perfectly mastered - the sad proof that she's used to this for far too long - and comes to unbutton the first button of his shirt before putting her hands on the plump cheeks. John runs up without waiting, takes the wrist of the youngest one to feel his pulse, and makes a sign to Gregory to tell him to open a window. From memory, he knows the fragile health of people with Down syndrome and that cardiac problems are frequent, then, they must be careful.
like that. She seems above everything and everyone with an astounding simplicity and John is jealous. It's not worth it to try to hide himself behind other words, he's drunk anyway.
"Go back home and don't worry about me," concludes Jared simply, hands getting up by reflex to touch her, but the metallic noise of the chains is disgusting enough to make him abort his gesture.
The man in the long coat seems to understand all the same because he turns back with the speed of a dog taken in fault. John intervenes on his path, keeps his feet firmly put on the pavement covered with chewing gum, and catches him by the shoulders when he tries to by-pass him:
are going to listen. You might think that Sherlock is the kind of man of whom you can enjoy the company for a while before moving to something else, but you couldn't be more wrong. How do you think Sherlock became what he is today? By flirting here and there, enjoying some…
"With me," Lestrade answers before catching his glass of champagne and emptying it slowly, mouthful after mouthful.
John half smiles and Sherlock drinks his tea, the steam getting lost in his dark curls hanging over his forehead, eyes closed, a hand resting on his right hip. There's just the noise of the
Surprisingly, Benjamin Cox came with his mother. They brought him a book about medieval legends, something he would have never bought but that he devoured the same evening. Mike Stamford came too. To all those people, they said John fell from a building in renovation. Sherlock and John never mentioned Moriarty or that John pushed him from a balcony to finally end this madness. To save Sherlock. And London combined.
John breathes a sigh of relief, half-amused, half-exhausted by this endless day and gets up on his feet to take the young patient to the door before stopping in front of the coat rack. His white hand - the evidence of iron deficiency - grabs a green parka and puts it on, before making the shock of a hair cut by his mother disappear under the hood.
He examines the last line a few necessary seconds to help him realize this is really happening, that they arrived on this damn island to see him laid down on a stainless steel table, grey and immobile, and Sherlock doesn't realize. He gives back the notebook to the receptionist who thanks him with a pale smile, then he turns around from the desk to bring them toward the door Sherlock never stopped looking at.
He quickly coughs and Sherlock just nods once, what's enough for him. He slides awkwardly into his boxers, still trying to hide himself, but Sherlock, seated with his back supported by the wooden head-board, is looking at an indistinct point at the bottom of the room. It's very strange to think about, but it doesn't seem to the doctor that his flatmate touched himself. Yet he still looks like he has just been through an orgasm. Maybe John's was so powerful that it was enough for the detective. It's a bit presumptuous to think about that, but that doesn't leave the fair head.
Slowly, gesture after gesture, he removes his buttons, revealing his white tank top which he dares to wear only when winter beats down on London. He really has no problem undressing in front of someone. He went through enough medical examinations in his life and people have already inspected him from all angles. But shall we put him in the most sophisticated MRI in the world, open his skull and inspect his brain, drain him of the necessary quantity of blood so that we may know all of his composition - even then nothing will ever be as true and significant as Sherlock Holmes's judgment.
. He raises his head, confused, but Sherlock is smiling at him. And strangely, this simple movement of lips seems to exist on this damned Earth only to reassure him.
“Oh, don't worry, it's not a big deal, Doctor. You're simply obsessed by Sherlock Holmes the same way Sherlock is obsessed by the Game. And
"Moreover, Mr Steele, you should know it's more useful to call your lawyer when you have something to hide. To have a relationship with a younger woman is not illegal, you know."
"John," Sherlock mutters, tightening his hand around the badly shaved chin. This time, it's because of the grey look that the doctor confesses the number he wanted to keep silent for as long as possible.
"And why don't you let me help you? Your sister is sick, she almost killed herself by falling dead drunk down her staircase. And you are the one who's been taking care of her for so many years. You always take care of others. For God's sake, you even enlisted of your own free will for Afghanistan! John, I adore you, but I don't understand you: why are you acting like this? Why do you make it a rule to always manage everything? Give me only one reason why you refuse to let people help you out."
It's with an excessively suntanned hand that Barrow greets the doctor and even if he shows five of his fingers in a completely equal way, John only sees the prominence of the forefinger and the middle finger mocking him. His jacket on, his left hand holding his Oyster card which he had already taken out, John's invaded by an oppressive need to catch up with his boss in the corridor.
With his thumbs, Sherlock barely caresses the badly shaved skin, until his right slowly slides up to the doctor's mouth, which he by-passes from the bottom before pressing his chin. It takes a few seconds for John to understand his flatmate did so to make him open his mouth. Sherlock's probably waiting for an answer to this, but it just sends a despicable shiver from his back up along the vertebral column to the jaw which he closes immediately.
," Sherlock moans, moving his fingers back before catching in his wet hand the face of his flatmate which he brings towards his own. "Where did you hide the condoms?"
He had never hidden them, nevertheless if he knew very well that Sherlock would look for them everywhere in the apartment, he especially knew that his flatmate would never come up to his bedroom. It's a kind of silent rule they both agreed on from the first day the doctor moved in, even if they've never spoken about it. In spite of all the hackings of his computer and the ruined dates, this respect for his intimacy is probably the most beautiful present that Sherlock has ever given him. John wonders if he's presently giving him the most beautiful of presents in return.
It gives him a blow in the stomach, discreet but real, when he sees a man hidden in a long grey coat, a hat way too big on his head. The man has his hands in his pockets and his static presence between the children's laughter and the parents, in a hurry because they are double-parked, is terrible.
"John?" asked Sherlock, his shirt sleeves around his elbows (since when did he get rid of his jacket?). In his hands were two tea pots he clearly couldn't decide between. "Is everything all right?"
Apparently, it's a contest of who will know the ceiling better tonight as Sherlock rolls his eyes so much John feels the need to do the same.
"I haven't used condoms for some time because there was no opportunity for me to do so. So, of course you're going to buy a box - or two, why not - but not the
, is liable for the accomplice to serve five years of detention and pay a 150 000£ fine," Lestrade prevents himself from screaming to the woman he wants to see leaving as quickly as possible, to not have to place her behind bars.
Both of them laid on their sides, facing and looking at each other, John immediately thinks he could warm him up if he's cold. Like a memory call, he raises his hand very slowly to give time to the impetuous mouth to shut him down with a snap of a tongue. He brings it closer to the fragile shoulder and wraps it silently. And still those two astounding blue iris are on him.
more adapted. Well I will attach your wrists and ankles to be sure that you will not move while I do what I planned to do on, above, or inside you," he sighs, tightening his grip.
It may be in John's head, but it looks like a way to stop the conversation. Mrs. Hudson collects the empty plates and gets up to move to the kitchen, where she prepares the Christmas pudding (in which she added marshmallows this time) and adds:
John half-opens his lips to answer, but those of Sherlock are closing on the inside of his right wrist, which he raised up to his face. He closes his eyes and presses his wet mouth against the hot skin with a lot of attention. It's from the end of his lips that's he's putting down offerings which have no words to be described. That almost make John groan because the sensibility of his skin is uncontrollable. He keeps his eyes wide open and contemplates the kitchen ceiling and he's never seen it under this angle, he's never been kissed
"It's not loaded, you know," specifies Sherlock, opening the chamber which he puts under Cox's nose.
The doctor does as he's told and opens his lips to suck with greediness at the finger invading his mouth. He knows very well what his flatmate is preparing as Sherlock stopped caressing his cock to make him open his legs. Sherlock frees his panting mouth without warning and trails his wet fingers between the doctor's legs. He puts his right hand on the member he surrounds without sweetness and cherishes it with such a perfect dexterity that John has to push his nails in his palms to refrain from coming too fast.
"I'll be right up to bring you some pea soup as soon as I'm done with the cleaning!" shouts a shrill voice from downstairs.
This was without counting on Mike Stamford and his own need to find a flat, before he had to go back to East Barnet due to a lack of money. It was now a daily occurrence that he was losing his breath during the chase of a black coat at the pursuit of a criminal. But that wasn't the worst part, of course; the adrenaline and the madness of the moment were always creating a primary and vital need to run, catch, and
Sherlock's chair scraps the ground and his body leans to John. He covers him with his arms and kisses his eyes, temples, forehead and lips.
to this other person. He opens his eyes again and it's a soft murmur that escapes from Sherlock's smiling lips, which summarises what he really is:
"I am not getting defensive!" John shouts, making the two teenagers passing next to them jump with surprise before apologising with a polite smile and putting his severe mask back on.
"Sherlock, it's..." begins the blond-haired man, voice quiet because sometimes his friend has the innocence of a child whom he doesn't dare to confront with the difficulty of the real world. "He is sick, I mean... He was born this way, he..." but the words don't come.
"Of course, Clara," he sighs, slightly disappointed he didn't understand it earlier. "But what did she say to you, that made you accept it?"
Sherlock catches the paper out of his hand to toss it through the room and puts his fingers on the doctor's back. He grips without sweetness, presses John's pelvis against his and both of them moan.
"Maybe she wanted us to accuse her future brother-in-law, or at least, who, we found out through investigating doesn't have English citizenship... It's a bit extreme but she could have..."
Sherlock raises his head and says nothing: it's a highway for John's deductions and he's not going to complain about it.
"No, thank you," answers Sherlock, eyes already scrutinising everything around them in the lounge where they are led.
With his forehead resting against the glass of the window of his bedroom, John's lips form a half-smile. It's a gesture he wouldn't have been able to do a few weeks ago (unless he wanted to freeze his skin) and the simple fact that he can do so now, proves that time flies away too fast. It's as if January were only yesterday, as if the smell of Mrs. Hudson's curry turkey is still invading the ground floor. But the melted snow and the merciless temperatures have well and truly left the capital, and those are fine jackets and short skirts which the doctor sees from the Baker Street window. It's worse, because it proves that it has been ages since he spoke to Harry.
will put the condom on me. That would please you, right? Sweet, perfect doctor that you are. If that can still give you the illusion that you're the one in charge... Maybe you hope that you'll be able to take advantage of the darkness, to tell me that you can't put it on me, but don't you worry about that. When I'll touch you, I'll leave the lights on. Every. Single. One. It is cute, the way you switch off the lamps of your bedroom when you're bringing...
them. I have even invited Benjamin Cox here and had dinner with Sheri Walsh. I know their lives by heart but I do not understand what I am missing..." says Sherlock, losing his temper, putting his forefingers on his temples, which he massages.
"During the performance, would you have seen anything strange? A sleazy spectator, a strange noise..."
Hello! First of all, thank you so much everyone for your lovely comments. The fact that you took time to read my first chapter and to post a review really proves that you are the best! Enjoy your reading on chapter two :)
He opens his lips to ask another question when the door opens in a deafening crash. Wrapped in his long black coat, Sherlock looks up and down the room with a cold stare. He doesn't even notice Lestrade, seems to ignore Watson and directly looks at Doris and Benjamin.
"Oh for Christ's sake, Sherlock, I'm fine, and if I stay seated one second longer, I'll end up with a wet arse and no way I'll let that happen, got it?"
He quickly turns on himself to check that he didn't forget anything and looks at Sherlock for many long seconds, trying to contain his words:
"Botanist," corrects the young man, scratching nervously behind his ear as if he were passing an interview for a job.
"Open your mouth," orders Sherlock, and the obscenity of the thing doesn't hold in his words except in the way he says it out loud.
“Do you know those flowers?” Sherlock asks, turning to face Andy without trying to calm the adrenaline boiling in him.
He goes into his room, visits it in only a few strides and goes out again in the corridor where Sherlock is already standing, hands in his big black coat pockets. They look at each other and smile politely. It does not have the charm of Baker Street, but there was no way they could have driven during the night - John is still not even sure Sherlock has his driving license.
"I'd say three more weeks to go with your plaster cast on your right wrist. Concerning your hip, we did an ostheosynthesis ansfw we... Well, you know, you're a doctor too"
"Well, precisely, then act like one and face your responsibilities. See you tomorrow, good evening," concludes John in a last effort toward politeness. While he turns around, ready to put all of this behind him (including his files) and to finally return back home, it's Barrow's nasally voice that says the one thing that no one on this damn earth really wants to hear.
"You heard what Lestrade said this morning at Scotland Yard: Moriarty left for Switzerland and they won't ask for extradition to avoid a diplomatic incident. He's watched by the authority so he won't make a move. If you want, go light a candle at St. Bride and pray for him to fall off a cliff or that he suffocates with an expired chocolate, but meanwhile, I really don't think it's useful to worry. "
Good, no need to say that Sherlock took them away from him, that would be very strange to insinuate his best friend stole his clothes. Sherlock returns to the room, informs both women that the questioning is over and when they pass in front of John, they quickly shake his hand before disappearing in a mixture of hardly murmured mutual reproaches. The blond crosses his arms against his chest and watches them disappearing in the staircases of Scotland Yard before asking:
"Sherlock," he calls up, coming back to the living-room to show the object he's holding in his right hand. "How many times do I have to tell you not to put your riding-crop on the table where I eat breakfast?"
With the left hand, he gently taps his friend's shoulder before turning back to his bedroom, of which he left the door open. Hidden under the embrasure, the fingers around the latch, ready to close behind him, he is stopped by John, still standing in the middle of the lounge.
, thinks the doctor. Nonetheless, Sherlock is the one who took the car keys from Greg's hands before even thanking him. This mainly due to the fact that he did not thank him.
John is staring at Moriarty. He doesn't shiver and there's in his ears the cacophonous mix of Moriarty's voice and his own beating heart. He doesn't blink once because it's at the first weakness that the enemy strikes and Jim Moriarty is so close to John that he feels all the killing spree of the man emanating from him. John smiles, because he doesn't have any other weapon to defend himself. Someone is going to die here tonight, he's sure about it and he really hopes it won't be Sherlock or himself.
The musicians still look at each other for a few seconds before the first violin noisily turns the pages of his pad to find the good score and starts without waiting, apparently out of patience. There's still a few seconds where only the sound of his violin resounds before he's finally joined by his colleagues. Lestrade turns on himself, Doris already got up to put on her coat and this time, John gives in:
"Benjamin had difficulty understanding the principles of my Mind Palace, so we created a reproduction of the room on the evening of the murder."
The need to hurl, spellbinding, total. But lack of oxygen and strength. Wet torso. Right hand... immobile. Not an eye opened yet.
John liked music like others liked to fall on their couch before putting their feet on the coffee table, returning from a working day where their boss had shown them once again that first, he wasn't going to allow their pay rise they have been waiting for, and that secondly, the onion supplement in the burger at lunch was not a good idea.
are doing this. It's not an experiment, nor a misunderstanding. They're not coming back drunk from any stupid parties. And it's not only the discovery of John's body to gain his trust. They're fucking and there's no unit of measure high enough to define the way John's feeling right now.
John barely finishes his sentence before his seat topples over, making him slam on the brakes, and even if fear overruns his stomach and head like the worst hurricane, the reflexes that got him back from Afghanistan allow him to steer the car to the roadside before they hit another car. It's Sherlock who kicked the back of the seat with his foot and John knows it very well. With shaking hands, he pulls out his seatbelt and turns around to face up to his misleading friend.
"What the..." but John can't finish his sentence as Sherlock's hands are already covering his mouth. With the free one, he presses a finger against his own lips to tell him to not make any noise.
John closed his eyes for a while until his right foot struck the ground violently, making him jump with surprise - did he really just faint?
"Mr Steele is placed under custody until his situation grows clearer. He's also suspected of planning a sham marriage which,
is going on) since John's knees bit the dust of Tesco with not much grace. And John thinks about it. Every day.
If, by any chance, someone's willing to beta the last 5 chapters (which are currently unbeta'd), please don't hesitate in commenting or contacting me on Tumblr!
His body tilted over the German newspapers from 1987 and the typewriter, John hangs his look of a terrible grey to the crystalline blue one
His shirt buttoned and his coat on his shoulders, he goes back to the doctor. John's standing in the middle of the room, body oriented toward the undone bed.
"Good. Now, we are really going to talk. I am going to ask you several questions and you will answer them honestly. Do you understand, John? I forbid you to act rude and rough - and do not pull a face, you may laugh at my ego but yours can completely compete in terms of size."
This is a case like any other: A body in a morgue to see, and nothing more. At least, John tries to convince himself of this. He would have given anything to stay in Baker Street during this awful February, bitten by the driest winter. It doesn't snow -at least, that's something- but he knows Scotland suffers from a far more impetuous cold. The idea of going over there in the Vauxhall Astra is not very pleasant. He will get through, though. He lived through much worse. As for Sherlock, nothing is less certain.
This time, the answer isn't immediate. John closes his lips as discreetly as possible to not show that he refrains from answering too fast. Sherlock still holds his face, and even if it's so hot he wants to take off his jumper and the purple shirt in front of him, John remains perfectly motionless. He answers with an awkward voice:
When he puts his fingers on the hard cock for the first time, he feels this sort of knot at the bottom of his stomach which had already made its appearance when, at the back of a tent lost in the middle of Wales, John touched a man for the first time during his military training. It's a knot which has the pain of prohibition, the color of transgression and inevitably, the perfume of desire. A knot which built up in his entrails every time he heard his uncle call the bookseller from down the road
were hurting him. When was the last time he had a proper meal? Oh yes, of course. Noon. Well if a crisp-bread sandwich and three peanuts stolen in the pub down the road could really constitute a meal. Faced with Moriarty, however, he wasn't hungry at all, but as always, everything had to become calm before the storm.
He heaved a sigh of relief when they finally reached the bath. Getting Holmes into the bath turned out easier than he had feared it would be. Gravity being on their side this time. In the end only a small amount of water ended up sloshing over the sides and ending up on the floor.
John nods and then they are out the door and the midnight of the hallway beyond it swallows them whole.
I don't end my sentence. It is the truth but only the half of it. I'll leave Patrick to draw his own conclusion.
It's not that he doesn't like her and doesn't want her around.....it's just....this is the first time he's ever gotten to just....be....like this....with John.
If Sebastian said anything as John left he didn't hear it. He was far too busy worrying about Sherlock's uncharacteristic departure and trying to catch up with him.
# The summary of chapter 8 (Mirk, mirk is this midnight hour) is another nod to some favorite poetry of mine. It is the first line of “Lord Gregory” by Robert Burns.
His breath formed a small, white cloud where he breathed, joining the ghostly armada of clouds that drifted overhead.
“Whenever you feel alone”, he says, “remember this. This feeling. This sensation. The beating of both of our hearts......that beat only for each other. And when you don't have mine close enough to feel, just know that it beats in time with yours”
“How are you?”, he asks Sherlock and Sherlock's reply is direct and honest and takes him a little bit by surprise.
It cannot be Holmes himself. She has seen inside his mind. She has felt his thoughts corrupting and bending to her will with every step he took towards the Veil and her realm.
'My line of work.......deals with the supernatural', he had said. And one look at his eyes had told John that he was definitely not joking.
Is there a science behind it, a natural explanation, or does it fall in the realm of the mystical and unexplainable?
“My ear should catch your voice. My eye, your eye....” John says. They're Helena's lines. Sherlock is surprised John knows these as well. He's not complaining though. John is standing so close to him now that once again he can feel John's breath on his face. Sherlock knows what the next line is and once again a warm feeling spreads from his abdomen all the way to his chest.
Their days together so far have been......not as bad as he had imagined they would be......not at all.
It's very indicative of John's character. Even though he is outside, working, on a day that is way too hot to pretty much do anything, he seems to be able to see the positive side of things.
'The wear on your jacket suggest that it has been well used suggesting you've been in the army for quite some time. Some parts have been patched up. Patched up with older army jackets. Material you could have only come by when you were still serving in the army. Looking at the stitches on the last patches you've put on it couldn't have been more than say....oh....a year and a half ago at most since you've made them', here Holmes quickly glanced at him before going back to staring at the road ahead of them, 'elementary really.'
The sounds from her vision are muted as if they are coming to her through several thick layers of blankets.
Aggravated his father pushed him back again and he ended up sitting on the windowsill with his back pressed against the glass. It felt cold. A stark contrast to the heat of his father's rage in front of him.
He needed to talk to her. Soon. He had betrayed their friendship and he would do anything to set things right with her again.
John feels like taking on the world. He feels capable of anything with Holmes by his side once more.
By the time they had reached the Hooper Estate his head had felt as if it was going to explode and so he had needed the sleep. He had needed to just turn off all the lights in there and shut it all down.....even for just a couple of hours.....to make Morgana stop her never ending onslaught on his nerves and patience.
In the end he only takes off his boots and jacket and lays himself down on his bed on his right side, his body facing the wall.
His anger came flooding back again, but what or who he was angry at exactly he wasn't quite sure of.
He feels as if he's vibrating. As if all his nerves have been replaced by rubber bands stretched to their limits and if literally anyone were to touch him right now they'd all snap, go flying across the room and cut and slice anyone they'd come in contact with.
For a moment Sherlock contemplates changing before going downstairs for the morning meal and giving himself a quick wash but in the end he decides against it.
His breath catches in his throat and as he makes his way backwards in an attempt to get away from the horrid vision he pulls Holmes along with him.
That evening Sherlock is quiet during dinner. Once again he's moving his food from one side of his plate to the other without actually eating it.
'Exaggerated?', here she slapped her hand on the table. The silverware and glasses rattled and both his sisters jumped, 'do you have any idea of the lengths I have to go to to try and keep your reputation intact? What people are saying about you? What they say about me and my daughters, because you like to go out and have a good time?'
The mischievous smile that had accompanied this statement had done strange things to Johns insides. Turned them into a warm, gooey mush mostly.
I have found a small empty table for myself along the far wall of the cafeteria and maybe John has seen me enter after all because somehow he has managed to change his position at his own table so that his back is turned towards me now.
I just can't tell her. I can't tell her everything. If I don't tell her I can pretend that, maybe, it didn't happen after all. And then I can stop feeling so miserable about it. I tell myself that that's exactly what I want.
So far John has just been staring out into the rain. Seemingly lost in thought. But as another drop hits Sherlock's knee he does give him a questioning, sideways glance.
Sherlock leans himself forward just a fraction and kisses him then and while he does so John loses his balance and they both end up lying on their sides on the mud underneath.
It was dawn when he finally reached the meadow. His pregnancy had prevented him from riding at full speed the entire way there. After a while the constant jostling of the baby in his belly had gotten uncomfortable and he had been forced to slow down.
I could go inside of the theater but I've never been here before and John promised he'd buy the tickets so that would just mean I'd be hanging out inside of a small theater aimlessly which would make me look weird and feel even more nervous than I already am and, besides, we agreed to wait outside so if John arrives and he sees that I'm already inside maybe he'll think I'm weird too and.....yeah.....
John has one of his arms slung behind his head and, on occasion, closes his eyes only to open them again moments later with a small sigh and a mesmerizing flutter of golden eye-lashes.
“No”, John sounds impossibly tired. Exhausted even. Once again Sherlock has to remind himself he can't actually fly and get to where John is. His mind is all over the place at the moment. “I'll stay on the line with you until you come down a bit.”
“Well...thank you....for this”, he says. He feels so clumsy. This experiment was the worst idea ever. He doesn't know how to flirt with John. He doesn't know how to flirt with anyone. This will end in disaster.....this will all fall apart soon....he will......John will.......John.....
(I had planned to make this chapter longer. Have it span two weeks again. But I have decided to have week 5 be a chapter of its own. So apologies if not much happens in this chapter. It's basically setting up for things to come.)
“Good”, John says by now the tension has completely left his body, “because I will threaten every single one of them.”
Instead of staying as far away from John as he possibly can, as he has been doing up until now, he'll covertly watch him during their school days on every opportunity he gets to see who John hangs out with and who he seems to flirt with or...wants to flirt with.
'You're back surprisingly early', Finn said without looking up as Sherlock dismounted and sat down as close to the fire as he dared, leaving his horse to wander freely, it would return of its own accord when he needed it again.
Magic can be like a science but, once you understand the laws it adheres to, you can  bend these laws and shape them to your own will and imagination.
“Not here”, he says, “too many unknown ears around. We'll finish our breakfast, get our horses and when we're on the road...then I'll tell you.”
Well....one of them is rushing, young Molly Hooper with her long brown hair flowing freely behind her. It's a good look on her, John thinks.
He is alone and there is darkness all around him and the sound of many approaching wings up above in the sky.
No doubt he was used to this kind of treatment from the upper class and John was reminded of the many times he himself had received a similar treatment.
For letting John's outstretched hand just sort of hover there, in the void between them, that has grown greater and greater with every single day he has spent on his own.
And with that he carefully separated the two flowers from each other and held one out towards Sherlock.
“Guilty”, John says, still smiling, “it was the only thing I could think of to get you to talk to me. You've been running from me for three months now....I was getting desperate.”
He feels his cheeks heating up again and grips his schoolbag a little bit tighter to try and ground himself.
Mr. Sanderson just raises an eyebrow questioningly but decides to leave it at that and goes back to writing on the blackboard. He's never been too good at discipline.
Mycroft gently cards his fingers through his brother's raven curls. Sherlock lets out a long breath. With it some of the anger mixed with sadness seems to leave his body too.
Sherlock wants to ask by who but deep down he already knows. The Order knows how he feels about them and so does Finn. It would take a summons from someone powerful indeed for Finn to be persuaded to bring him here.
The stranger shifts his weight from one hip to the other and John's not sure if he's aware he's doing it but the action is, once again, perfectly timed to the beat of the music. The man was born to dance.
Stayed where he belonged. Kept the precious equilibrium that is Sherlock's high-school life where he remains on one end of the scale and John on the other. Were they ever to meet the scales will tip and everything will end in chaos.
Andrew is a good dancer. He seems to know just how to swivel his hips to make it look graceful and easy.
Sherlock doesn't have the faintest idea what kind of “big game” Greg is talking about and that is probably also written all over his face because Greg smiles, shakes his head and goes on to explain the situation a bit further:
Ever since that day when Mycroft had found him amidst the trees, shivering, wet and exhausted he had not been able to get truly warm ever again.
'Master Holmes?' he asked, getting rather nervous now. The mans arm still slung around his shoulder. Johns arm around his waist, supporting his weight.
They are both silent for a moment. Just long enough for John to think the last couple of weeks over and how he might have....maybe....overreacted just a little bit.
“What are you doing here?” John asks again. His words are harsh and full of accusation and once again guilt rears its ugly head.
And so he sits and waits and puts his ears to listen and his eyes to see through the ever expanding cracks in the walls.
All this talk of sentiment.....of love.....it's not something he's used to....it's something he's closed himself off of for years and years and now that he is opening himself up to it again.....he feels fragile....exposed.....naked.....he doesn't know what to say.....what to do.....how to keep Watson......or how to cope with the knowledge that an inevitable loss will follow.
He remembers running his fingers through it....pulling on it.....jet-black curls that frame a pale face with sharp edges, high cheekbones, pale blue eyes and Cupid's bow lips.
“I'm giving him time”, I say but even to my own ears it sounds like such a cheap excuse. And I don't know why. When I'm with John it sounds so logical and sensible.
I have half a mind to just go over there, shake his shoulders, make him look at me, yell at him......make him acknowledge me at least.
John's arm had been draped loosely around her shoulders as he had looked at her and had whispered something in her ear. She had giggled again as she pressed herself against John's side.
The paws of the creature on either side of his head where, moments before, Sherlock's hands and arms had been.
John feels his cheeks heat up. He looks into his fly infested beer and first gives a sort of half-shrug and then a small nod.
Knowing Holmes this still could go either way. He is not planning to get his hopes up and then get them dashed again.
Another moment of silence passed and just when it seemed he was about to say something more the sound of dogs barking in the distance reached them.
“Tonight? I'll have to come up with another excuse for my absence then....I doubt they'll believe my father died twice.”
The next thing he remembered was sitting in a chair by the fire with a blanket wrapped around him in his fathers office. Sherlock was not allowed in here. Not ever.
Maybe an employee or regular patron at the coffee-place John was so adamant they'd go to but he quickly dismissed that theory.
John can't help but laugh. The sentiment is not returned as Holmes gives him an icy stare. He quickly schools his features and once again tries to finish his own breakfast.
He holds his breath for a couple of seconds before he lets the inhaled smoke pour out past his lips once more.
Sherlock nods and  John makes his way to the bar where the baked goods are sold. Sherlock looks down at the dvd in his hands. On the cover Hamlet can be seen standing, watching the marriage of his uncle and mother. He's got his back to the camera. He's dressed in all black and his short blond hair is in stark contrast with his dark clothes.
He doesn't look at me. Instead he picks at some biscuit-crumbs that have gotten stuck to the fabric of his jeans as he answers.
He suddenly felt far too naked, too exposed, even in the sheltered confines and privacy of the cave.
Apparently that seems to be what she is thinking because at his lack of words the look on her face turns even more solemn as she extends her arm and gently squeezes his elbow.
It revives my numb skin, making it glow with an irritated pink hue, and soothes my aching head and body somewhat.
And as Sherlock retracted his hand the wall started to emit a soft glowing light making the unseen seen.
He feels he is slowly regaining consciousness, and even if he has asked three times that his flatmate be warned, he is still alone in his room, and patience isn’t one of his prime virtues. His eyes are riveted to the clock, which indicates 2.37pm; Sherlock must be worried to death.
"And certainly not very interesting in the long run. I imagine she attracts men for whims without future. You can't build anything with this kind of woman. Well, good day Mrs Sanchez."
Yet John seems firmly convinced and Sherlock doesn't dare to tell him it's unnecessary; he feels like it'll piss off his friend more than ever. This time, he lets him choose the hotel, because the one he booked didn’t seem to be to John's liking (even though four stars are enough for a lot of people). So he doesn't say a word when the doctor pulls over to check an address on his mobile, even if he knows the city by heart. He doesn't say anything, either, when John takes the direction to the Lomond lake they're driving along before turning onto a little country lane that leads them to a two-story timbering house. The “Bed & Breakfast” sign is almost entirely covered by the fir tree branch on which it's nailed.
"Your bedroom." And it doesn't frighten the doctor to have pronounced these words because his voice doesn't tremble, and because he is looking at the detective with an invulnerable intensity, and for the second time of the evening, John really manages to surprise his flatmate.
Sherlock is speaking. It must be his head above his own. It's not clear. It's blurry. Everything is blurry.
next week. Can we go now? I'm bored." But the tallest one doesn't really expect an answer to this rhetorical question, because he has already disappeared into the Hygiene and Beauty department.
"Ask Benjamin, it is he who picked them up. And was Sherrer present during those seven performances?" pursues the detective, without deigning to look at both men on all fours behind him.
"Brilliant," answer the two other men with one voice, fixing the detective with a proud smile on his lips.
He seems to understand the doctor's haste but his movements are reassuring. With his right hand he surrounds John's jaw and makes him get back on his feet. The doctor's legs are killing him, he doesn't have time to spread them before Sherlock is already pressing a hand to the middle of his torso.
"Sherlock says that s-somewhere in my brain there is a memory of what happened w-when Mr. Sherrer was killed."
," spits Sherlock without considering John's proposal. "We were able to establish that Sherrer was following Denosa, thus neither Sanchez nor Steele were able to be the shooters. Of course, I suspected Craig Jennings at first. I couldn't believe a man that dull could exist without faking it a bit, but it turns out that this man is truly and profoundly stupid - he even began a hunger strike to try to get back custody of his son. Benjamin Cox was also in my sight, but seeing his reaction when I pointed John's weapon at him, it is obvious that he would have never had the notch to kill a man in cold blood. And then, there was only one shot, perfectly targeted, the killer is a professional. John thinks it is Angie Walsh. She is young, but her family is used to the venery. Angie Walsh, thus, is used to handling firearms since she was a child - but I'm missing the mobile."
John puts his mountain of dishes in the busy kitchen sink and turns around towards the lounge where his flatmate is finally leaving his armchair. Sherlock has his eyebrows slightly frowned and his teeth are biting hard on his lower lip. It's rare to see the detective doubting, but when it happens, bloody hell that's creepy.
John lowers an eyebrow and Sherlock smiles. They look at each other out of the corner of their eyes and jump with surprise when the first
"It's what people think of me and it is why I scare them off, I suppose. It's both a gift and a curse, really. They think I'm emotionless. A cold-blooded freak. Already dead, almost."
Hey guys! Wow, 19 comments and 43 kudos? Thank you so much, you're best, this is so stimulating :)! I hope you'll like this (lively) chapter too.
The doctor's eyes open wide under the surprise and his hand falters for one second before holding on to his face more firmly. Sherlock's way too close and there's way too many people around them, it's so troubling John wants to jump backwards, but he won't do that to please him. They glare at one another intensely, fighting each other with their gazes, a silent battle to see who will back down first. John doesn't move at all, both of his feet planted firmly on the ground, as if they are anchored in quick sand.
Lestrade sighs out loud and gets closer to the table to make Jones and Hendrik sign their deposition, and the doctor just has time to turn his head before glimpsing Sherlock's amused smile overlooking him.
They turn their heads at the same time and the desire that is burning inside of them is gone from their pupils. They nod and John smiles more than ever:
John, pushed as far as possible against the cold wall so as not to touch his flatmate's naked body, frowns and asks:
the first time Sherlock has invited a witness from a case back to their home, that doesn't prevent John from almost choking when he sees the state of the living room.
The flatmates lower their eyes, slightly ashamed, and John can see in Sherlock's tense attitude the young man understands his sociopathy has taken over again.
"Hello Doctor." Benjamin smiles and waves, which brings down the clipping that he was holding between his thick fingers.
He's ready to give up, persuaded his flatmate is kidding just to make a fool of him, when Sherlock's body heat is pressing against him. He feels his back wrapped by the brown-haired man's chest, his hips against his and the back of his own thighs pressed by knees with striking bones. It's physically impossible, John knows it, he's a doctor for God's sake, but it seems that every tiny plot of land of the detective's body found a place against his. Sherlock's right hand settles slowly on his pelvis and lays his palm down, all of his fingers.
In front of the indoor pool, on the cold concrete covered with gum, a crowd of curious citizens were rushing behind a garish yellow ribbon, their eyes bulging despite the luminosity more than weak, made partially bestial at the mere idea they could admire a body laid down under a shroud, a man with handcuffs or just a little blood. More than once, Gregory Lestrade held himself back from catching onto one of those onlookers who put their dirty nose on a crime scene and making Lestrade realise that no, there was absolutely no pleasure in discovering a dead body. Luckily, the DI was professional. Most of the time.
"Remove your shirt," openly starts Sherlock, and this time John knows that they eventually jumped into a void.
Sherlock steps over him, squats on his right and pushes away the black mass. A part of fabric turns around and when John recognises on the label the form of a globe with a crown on it, he both realises he can properly see again and that it's Jim Moriarty lying next to him, at the same time. Sherlock grabs his right hand and massages it to let the blood circulate through his fingers.
