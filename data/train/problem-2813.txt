Cas carefully pulled his t-shirt down and the covers back up, not a moment too soon as Sam emerged from the bathroom. Dean closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
“We can still have fun,” Kaia said. “A party’s a party. And I’ve never done pool.”
“Another archangel, yes. Michael, he was always the most powerful. It wasn’t even the Michael from our world that we had known, but a different one. I’m sure this is all very confusing and strange. As far as the demon, he had help from some demigods with spellwork. And Gabriel was perhaps too careless there as well. Not that I’m criticizing him, believe me. I’ve made worse mistakes.”
“We picked up your prescriptions. There is a cream that may provide some relief. There are also medications for pain, an antihistamine, and an emergency epinephrine injector in case of any future stings.” As he spoke, Cas was pulling things from a shopping bag and laying them out on the nightstand. There was also a bottle of gatorade, cans of soup, and a plastic baggie filled with honeycomb.
“Oh really? Well, don’t get me started on Winchester stupidity,” Cas grumbled.
Cas rolled his eyes as they moved up to their turn at the checkout. Dean winked at him as he emptied the basket onto the belt, and somehow they managed paying for their snacks and heading back to the car interspersed with silent flirting.
After the movie was over, Sylvia put on Moulin Rouge, a little too buzzed still to do more than click the next movie on her list. That turned out to be a bad decision, as by the ending they were both far too close to sober and ended up sobbing uncontrollably through the last of her box of tissues.
“You two really are disgusting,” Claire said. Kaia was plastered to her side, and Dean gave them an exasperated look as he pulled away from Cas.
No sooner had Dean closed and locked the stall door than he resumed kissing Cas, this time thrusting his hands up under his shirt, desperate to touch his skin. Dean tenderly traced the lines of Cas’s collarbone, the defined muscles of his chest, down over his abs. He knew every inch of this skin so well now, and yet it fascinated him every time.
“I guess so,” Dean said, exhaling sharply. Cas patted his shoulder soothingly.
“But like… it doesn’t change other things that you think about them? Like you don’t go, oh Claire’s a lesbian, guess she listens to Ani DiFranco and wears flannel… okay actually she does wear flannel, nevermind. Or like that she… drives a Subaru or should cut her hair off.”
“Everything smells delicious,” he said. “Please let me help cook; I feel so useless.”
When he pulled back and opened his eyes, Cas was looking at him in shock. “There’s more where that came from, when you’re feeling better,” Dean added. “If you want.”
“I’m fine, dear,” Cas said. Dean patted his knee, and they drove along.
“You mean, boyfriend and girlfriend labels, that sort of thing?” She smiled, a warm feeling going through her at the thought.
“I don’t want to be done with you,” she said. “I never wanted that. I told you I needed some time to clear my head. I thought you would understand that, like you did last time.”
“Cas getting here soon?” Sam heaved himself out of the grave and laid on the grass.
There was a large range of performers, from older drag queens who’d clearly been at their craft for a long time and oozed finesse and polish, with perfectly executed, glamorous performances, to young and sexy newcomers with routines very nearly too hot for a daytime all-ages show, a few of which left Cas feeling squirmy and uncomfortable and wondering if perhaps Dean was right not to want him to come to this.
“You’re beautiful,” Cas murmured. “I’ll get you a towel.”
“Where?” he said in a croaky voice, as if he had forgotten how to speak. “‘S he here?”
“Good things do happen,” Cas said thoughtfully. “Do you remember when I told you that?”
Sam blushed. “Why do you want to ask me that?”
He was wearing a Farrah Fawcett style wig and was clad in a shimmery gold evening gown, ruched in the bodice in a halter top style, with a calf-length pleated skirt. Shining gold strappy stilettos. And he was carrying a glittery gold lace umbrella propped over his shoulder.
Cas concentrated his grace and poured it into Dean. It was a difficult healing; there was so much damage, and Cas was lightheaded by the time he’d finished. But at last, Dean’s arm looked good as new, and his breathing and his color returned to normal. Still, Cas didn’t want to let him go. They sat quietly for a long moment before they finally pulled apart and began cleaning up.
Cas took a deep breath in and let out a low moan. His face crinkled up with pain. “Whhh?” he wheezed out, and his hands came up towards his face to shield himself.
A gentle breeze wafted through the open barn doors and cleared the air out a little faster.
Dean opened his mouth to say something irritable to the both of them, but instead he took a deep breath and sighed, and shook his head. “You’re right. I’m being a jackass. You two should go. But first, we should check out the carnival games. I’m gonna win you so many stuffed animals, sweetheart.” He took a big bite of his sandwich and wiped the grease and barbecue sauce from his face with the back of his hand. “Big ol’ teddy bear,” he said. “All kinds of crap.”
“What? No!” Dean said. Cas gave him a skeptical look. “I dunno, man.” Dean fidgeted for a moment before stalking off toward the kitchen. “I’ve gotta stir the sauce.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, smiling, his whole face one big sunny smile. His hand moved up to cover Dean’s. They shifted closer, and Dean’s other hand grasped his chin gently. And then Dean moved in that last breath and brought their lips together, a delicate press that quickly shifted into something hungrier as Cas met him halfway there.
“Cas, maybe just-” he glanced over and saw the corner of Cas’s mouth twitching. He sighed in exasperation. Cas was way too good at winding him up.
Dean choked out a “yeah” somewhere in the noises he was making. Cas somehow managed to unfasten his pants and slide them down his hips without so much as brushing against his erection, which was desperate for his touch. Dean stepped out of the jeans now puddled around his ankles and reached to pull Cas close again, but Cas seemed to be the one in charge now, crowding him backwards until Dean’s legs hit the bed and they tumbled into it together.
Dean nodded. “Struggling through the same thing, myself.” He picked up his beer glass. “Toast to our kid, eh?” Cas clinked his glass against Dean’s.
“I am so gonna get in a fistfight today,” Dean predicted.
She frowned in confusion. “I’ve never… I’ve never had an objection to you going when you want to go. I just want you to come back some time. You’re… we’re not… you and I, we don’t…”
“Man, my ass
“Yeah, that’s what Sam said. Guess my brother is kind of God now, which is  too weird for words. I’m probably never winning at arm wrestling or Uno or, like, anything against him ever again.”
The cemetery was located underneath a huge, gnarled oak tree. Dean leaned against the tree and scrolled through his phone while Sam dug. Messages from Jody about things she’d seen on the police wires that might interest him. A string of jokes from Donna. A photo from Claire of her new shotgun. Baby pictures from Garth. And yet nothing from Cas.
“Sammy!” Dean called, waving him over. “Where’d you get to? You missed the parade.”
For the first time she told Cas the story of her father’s remarriage, the stepmother that hated her, the baby brother that she had loved but who had been carefully raised to hate her as well. By the time she had finally been able to leave for college, fleeing to New York, her brother had grown big enough and corrupted enough to hurt her with sick, delighted glee. She had never been back.
“Very slightly. Not able to heal you further, yet, I’m afraid.”
“Dining table’s closer”
Sam snorted. “Gabriel, how freaking dense are you? They’ve had the hots for each other forever, and frankly it’s been so goddamn frustrating to live with that I’m slightly less angry with you than I otherwise would have been. And yeah, they’re definitely… yeah. Finally.” Sam shook his head.
Afterwards, wrapped in towels, they sat on the bed and ignored the cheesy movie in the background. The heater chugged out steady warmth and they kissed, slow and sweet at first, then with growing intensity as Dean climbed into Cas’s lap. He teased at Cas’s tongue with his own, and Cas returned the gesture, groaning softly as he dipped his tongue into Dean’s mouth. Dean shifted in his lap, straddling him, and his cock was suddenly achingly hard and nestled against Dean’s ass. Dean leaned back a little, sliding just the tiniest bit, nudging him against there. “Wanna try something different tonight?” he asked hoarsely. “I’ve been thinking…”
The pond hadn’t seemed all that cold when Dean had jumped in after the little girl - not that he would have hesitated no matter the temperature, he just hadn’t thought it was going to be this unpleasant. She was struggling, just barely keeping her head above the surface, but he could tell she was terrified and it was taking all the strength and skill of her little body just to keep her chin up.
They followed Sylvia into the bar and she immediately called out a “helloooo!” and waved to people across the room, close to the stage. The bar was only about half full, and they easily made their way over to the large table. “Dean and Cas. meet Margo, Nora, and Stephan.” Handshakes were exchanged, and they all settled into seats. “We all met at work, though none of us work in the same places these days.”
“When have I ever let you starve?” Dean said tiredly. “Make yourself useful, chop up that cucumber. Watch for the bad spots, it’s been in the fridge a while.”
“Not all of it, no,” Cas said defensively. “But I am rather depleted. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to make you more comfortable.”
He was almost too caught up in enjoying the feeling of Cas’s fingers on him to notice Cas’s little hitch in his breath. Dean turned his head to the side and looked at Cas carefully. His cheeks and the tips of his ears looked… were they pinker than usual? Was he blushing? His hands trailed lower, rubbing the cream into a spot just above Dean’s waistband. It felt slower, more deliberate, and their eyes met. Dean let out a breathy sigh.
“Would you like to cook breakfast with me again?” he asked. “I thought I might try hash browns this time. Sylvia and Gabriel will no doubt be hungry.”
“It’s not like that! We all just came for a night out, I’m straight, it’s not… I’m not here for a hookup, jeez.”
“No,” Dean said firmly.
Dean’s face crumpled with shame. “I’m sorry. You’re right.”
Castiel nearly dropped the phone. “What else did Sam tell you about how things went down? Did they- is Chuck dead?”
“Loved you,” Cas said simply. “I was more than ready to love you, however you wanted. And yet... while it would have been nice to kiss you and hold you and speak words of love out loud, it was fine, just being at your side. Your best friend. I like to think that we’ll always be that, too. Let’s never forget one for the other.”
Back at the house, they parted ways early. Sylvia had some revisions to a project to get done for work, and Cas went downstairs and laid in bed and called Dean, who’d texted half an hour earlier to say that he was stopping for the night.
They both groaned, and Dean’s hands fumbled at his waist, desperately, and freed him of his jeans, shoving them down his hips. Cas wiggled out of them, finally kicking them off his feet in frustration before returning to his position against Dean’s body, now separated only by their underwear. He slotted a leg between Dean’s, and Dean squeezed big handfuls of Cas’s ass, rocking them together. Slowly, carefully, they savored this, until the urgency to increase the friction grew too much.
They went through the kitchen and down the basement stairs. At the bottom was a little alcove with the laundry machines, the water heater, and the furnace, and a slightly battered fridge, and the usual basement clutter of boxes and old junk shoved against one wall. On the other side was the set of stairs that led to a door to the back yard. And in the back wall was a door that opened into a tiny apartment. There was a wood paneled main room, with a small sofa and a clunky old TV on a table, and a kitchenette along one wall. There was a bedroom done in lighter wood paneling, the bed made up with orange floral sheets and a thick blanket with a wolf howling at the moon, and a tiny bathroom, just barely big enough for toilet, sink, and shower cubicle.
“Sort of, and sort of,” Gabriel said. “It’s complicated. On both fronts. But it’s good. Things are going well for me, all things considered.” Gabriel bumped his knee against Sam’s. “Heard you’ve got a girl, too.”
“It’s perfect.” Dean’s lips grazed his skin. “I… I don’t wanna make any assumptions, but it seems like you’re… well I wasn’t sure what we’re doing.” He felt Castiel tense up in his arms. “I mean- I want to do things! Didn’t know what you would want to do. For all I know, making out is your limit. What
“I know it was very rash of me, but, I… Dean I could easily have lost you today, and I must confess that it has me very rattled.” He stared down at the floor, unable to look Dean in the face.
“Oh come on babe, get me a bottle opener,” Dean said. He picked up one of the pamphlets to read about what they were selling here. Life insurance. Very cheerful.
She found him on the back deck, sitting on the creaky old glider watching the sparrows and finches crowd around the bird feeder.
They went to the alcohol truck with the shortest line and Dean bought a round. They found an empty park bench and sat together, Sylvia between Dean and Cas, and told the whole story.
“Love you so much,” Dean said warmly, slinging an arm around Cas and tugging him close. “We gotta clean up but I just need to hold you.” He pressed a kiss to Cas’s forehead. “Was… was that okay, babe?”
, just some powerful weapon. I know it’s not as simple as that but… would have been nice to be liked.”
Well, I'm sorry that this took so long, but it's been a wild 48 hours, as I'm sure I don't have to tell you. It knocked me for a loop. Y yo a ti, Cas.
“He wasn’t wrong,” Castiel said.
“I believe Lebanon has a sack race and a frog hopping competition at the town celebration,” Cas mused. “I’ve seen signs for it in the grocery store.”
“I believe it’s correct to say that you rocked my world.” He shifted around onto his side and pulled Dean against him, back to front, and tucked the covers snugly around them. “Are you still angry with me?”
“Cas, no, it’s fine, it’s great,” Dean said, snatching it from his hands as he steered him away from the game. “I’m… real happy with the eggplant, okay?”
Dean stood in the bedroom, in front of his mirror. His hair remained the same short style as always, only now it was a brilliant, flaming red. Perhaps a shade or two brighter than Rowena’s, a natural red still but a very startling color. It didn’t look half bad on him, Gabriel mused. Maybe he’d done the guy a favor.
“They sold him out to a demon,” Castiel said softly. “We had no idea that he was even still alive all those years.”
Sylvia was up soon afterwards. Dean really wasn’t paying attention until she launched into the chorus with heartbreaking fervor. “Til now! I always got by on my own! I never really cared until I met you!” she belted out. “And now it chills me to the bone. How do I get you alone?” The song gave Dean chills too. He could feel that acute sense of loss all too well. He watched her and thought about Gabriel. Not just for Sylvia’s sake, but the world would have benefited from Gabriel still being alive.
“It- the virus is very aggressive- there’s nothing to be done!” he wailed, conjuring up a few tears for good measure. “Dean-O, my friend! If only it was January 12th, we’d have a chance-”
“Ohhh,” Margo said, a note of disappointment. “Well girl, we gotta find you a man. You’ve been moping too long. Just about as long as I’ve known ya. I know someone broke your heart, but…”
” Sylvia breathed. “That is
Dean was silent for a moment. “Cas, this is a tree.”
“Gabriel?” she asked again. “Aren’t you?”
“Just as well you didn’t
Sylvia was sitting on the floor of the bathroom stall, her knees drawn up against her chest. Her stomach still felt awful, though she didn’t think she was in imminent danger of throwing up yet again, and her head was absolutely spinning. Fortunately she was still drunk enough to dull the pain.
“Dump away, Sam.” Gabriel patted his back carefully. “Tell ol’ Gabriel all your troubles.”
“Please,” Dean said. He laid back against the pillows, and Cas knelt by his side. Their eyes met, seeking confirmation, each checking that the other was okay. Dean spread his legs and pulled his knees up, and Cas traced one trembling, lubricated finger over his ass, nudging carefully at the tight pucker.
There was a table filled with cowboy accessories where the line was forming. A young man with floppy blond hair, wearing a striped vest, boots with spurs, and cutoff denims so short his asscheeks were peeking out the bottom, tied a green bandana around Dean’s neck and placed a cowboy hat on his head. “Ohhh yeah,” he proclaimed, patting Dean’s shoulders. “You look amazing, sweetie. Ready when you are.” He led Dean to the mechanical bull and helped him climb on.
“Yeah. Yeah, good ol’ terra firma. Hey, so… can you heal yourself or is the mojo all gone?”
He handed Dean the plate. “Banana or orange?”
They walked out through the kitchen, across the deck and into the yard. Cas was barefoot, but the soft, cool ground didn’t seem to bother him. His dark blue jeans were cuffed to keep them from dragging in the grass, and he wore a lighter blue polo shirt nearly exactly the color of his eyes. A little weird to see him in different clothes. Not bad weird, but unsettling. It was a lot shifting at once, but Cas’s hand in his was soothing, grounding.
Cas looked at Dean over the top of Sylvia’s head. They held a whole conversation with their eyes. Sylvia was sobbing and Dean understood that Gabriel was probably to blame, given the earlier conversation. Cas was petting her hair and murmuring soothing things.
“Break a leg, sweetheart,” Dean said as Cas stumbled his way toward the stage, assisted by Sylvia giving him an arm to lean on. “Oh god he’s so drunk,” Dean giggled delightfully, looking at the three empty glasses by his plate. “Shit, where’s my phone?” As the song started playing and Castiel looked at the microphone in his hand, Dean started recording.
“Yeah, Cas, give it to me,” Dean said breathily. He felt Cas moving closer, the press of his thighs against Dean’s, the tip of his cock dragging along the top of his crack. Cas was teasing him, taking his time, moving around here and there. Dean wiggled, teasing back, and Cas sighed and pressed the tip against his hole. He pressed in slowly, and leaned over him, peppering kisses over his shoulders.
“Well. I’ve recently realized that I do enjoy you filthy.” He winked as suggestively as he could manage.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Aw come on Cas, there was no one there!” Dean said as they headed toward the checkout stand. “It was a perfect opportunity.”
“At the moment I’m in suburban New Jersey watching bird feeders. But Dean should be here to pick me up, perhaps tomorrow. Then we’ll see from there.”
“He sounds like a bad boy. I’ll bet he wears a leather jacket. Does he wear a leather jacket? How about a motorcycle?”
“I suppose I thought that we’ll undress and kiss for a while and see what inspiration we get after that. Touch each other’s bodies in various ways. I hope that there will be a few orgasms at some point. And I’m keenly interested in cuddling afterward.”
Ten minutes later and a brilliantly crafted bit of lore about the implications of Sudden Onset Gingerism in Hunters had been posted on five different very serious-seeming hunter websites. For good measure, there was an ancient book with a chapter about it on the library shelves, and a few case files in the Men of Letters filing cabinets in the personnel section, though he didn’t think it would come to that level of research. You could never be too careful with Sam around.
When she came back out, he had pulled the covers back and had summoned up a pair of red striped pajamas that should have been hilarious but actually looked perfect on him. They crawled under the covers and cuddled and talked well into the night, until Sylvia dozed off in the middle of a sentence about the merits of the deconstruction of oreos before eating them. Gabriel chuckled, kissed her forehead, and let himself indulge in some sleep as well.
Dean lifted his head and looked into his eyes. “I love you, too, Cas.” They looked into each other’s eyes, each so full of love, and Dean realized that they always had been, this had always been in their eyes, it was just out loud now.
“Eileen?” Dean exclaimed as she ducked into the crowd. Then, feeling stupid, he rushed to catch up to her and tap her shoulder. “Hey!”
“Well I missed you,” Gabe said. “Including antagonizing you.”
“I know, honey. I know,” he said soothingly. He grabbed her hand and squeezed it. “But not like this.” He glanced over at Sam, who looked like he’d just gargled a handful of tacks. Cas frowned. Of course, Sam had known that Gabriel was here this weekend, had spoken to him last night, but there was no reason for… yes, that was it. Sam looked guilty. The only thing Sam could possibly feel guilty about was not speaking up to Sylvia in the few minutes they’d had before the show started, which would hardly have been possible. Something seemed off.
“Shit!” Dean said. “Ow! Fuck!” He nearly dropped the phone as the first one stung his arm. Dean backed away quickly, but the wasps were now very interested in the sweaty human who had poked at their stolen goods. “Fuck fuck mother fucker!”
“Why, do you need one?” She gave Dean a sideways glance, a smirk on her lips.
“Yeah. Yeah, it’s… so far, so good, Cas. A little weird, but… I know it’s gonna be weird before it gets good.” He hissed as Cas’s finger pressed in, just the slightest bit.
“If they like you, they’ll reschedule, right?” she said. “If not maybe they’re not worth it.”
Dean stood up and stretched. “Alright Baby, let’s get you back into one piece.”
The car repair was finished and the Impala was purring like her old self. Castiel helped Dean wipe down and pack up tools and tuck things away in the trunk. He was pushing the toolbox in to make room to stash the old alternator when he dislodged a crinkly paper lunch bag. He plucked at it curiously. “You didn’t leave an old sandwich in here, did you?” he asked Dean, who was just coming over with the drain pan.
They picked slowly over their food, and compared notes on the complicated saga between their brothers and their respective love lives. Dean was still mulling over whether to bring up Claire’s beef about Jack to Cas. Maybe it wasn’t his place, and it wasn’t like he hadn’t had similar thoughts himself. He tucked it back away for now.
” she exclaimed, rubbing her head as she turned toward him. Sylvia’s face lit up with a huge grin. “Well it’s good to see your face, less good to collide with it.” She threw her arms around his neck and hugged him fiercely, and Cas returned the hug, squeezing her tight.
He looked up at Cas, haloed in the fluorescent bathroom light, blue eyes shining with a mixture of love and reverence and fierce domination, and Dean spilled his load before Cas even did. Dean moaned around Cas’s cock as the orgasm washed through him, and as he rode the last wave of it down, Cas whispered “fuck.” Dean’s eyes popped back open and he watched Cas’s face, squinting and grimacing, sweat shining on his forehead, his mouth hanging open and panting as he came. A droplet fell onto Dean’s face, it could have been sweat or spit or a bit of both, and he knelt on the bathroom floor and thought how gorgeous Cas was when lost in ecstasy.
“Let’s meet up again later,” Gabriel said. “I got a few things to take care of soooo… just make sure you catch the drag show, okay?”
Cas smiled lopsidedly. “Thank you?” It was adorable and it made Dean’s heart flip-flop.
“I don’t even wanna know what my face looks like,” he sighed. The young helper gave him a wide-eyed look and nodded ever so slightly.
Dean rolled his eyes. His expression softened a little. “Counts for everything. I just wish my stupid brother would stop trying to foist this pride crap on me. Told him I don’t need to make a big deal out of this stuff.”
“Alright, here ya go,” said the carnie, handing Cas a huge purple stuffie.
“So like… if someone was really into you, you probably wouldn’t ever notice?” Sam asked thoughtfully. “If someone had been flirting with you for months, you’d just… never respond because you didn’t even see it?”
“Layoffs,” Margo grumbled. “Lucky enough to get in somewhere else, with a 30 mile commute.”
“So… on a scale of one to ten, how deep of shit am I in?” he asked.
“I did- oh I’m sorry! I didn’t even think to give it back to you!” He gestured toward the kitchen table where her phone laid. “I did call him.”
“I’m sure we can find a more healthful option than that,” Cas said.
He also had to pee, which he thought was yet another unfortunate contradiction. He slipped out of the bed and walked to the bathroom, attempting to convince his body that, while he was willing to appease the urination, perhaps asking for sex again right now was too much.
“Cas, you wanna go?” Dean said in surprise.
want to take that bait. So here I was, sending out resumes and hoping I could bounce along to another company and maybe it would be different next time… and we got a new janitor in the building. And he was… really cute and just… he had this sassy sparkle to him, but I could tell he was just a really good guy under it all.”
Sam brought the plate over and handed it to Cas, who began eating eagerly. “So, um. While I was waiting here, I talked to Eileen. She’d actually like some help with the case in Tennessee.” He cleared his throat and looked back and forth from Cas to Dean. “I was thinking about leaving now, actually. I could get there tomorrow.”
“What’s this?” Cas asked.
“I’m listening.” Cas could hear the tight set of his jaw. Dean was bracing himself for something terrible.
“Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.” He scratched his head and looked down at the floor. “It’s just that… that’s how I think of you, sometimes, and then- then I remember that that’s not how you see us, and…”
“I.. yeah. So, I grabbed the donkey and… uh, is Sam okay?”
Dean zoned out as they drew his blood and adjusted his IV, as Sam answered medical history questions as best he could. His swollen hands ached terribly, and the burning of each sting was starting to give way to itching. He desperately wanted to scratch everywhere, but his hands wouldn’t let him, even if that was a good idea. He caught sight of his bare legs peeking under the hospital gown and saw at least a dozen hugely swollen spots on them, ranging from golf ball to tennis ball sized. “I look like shit,” he muttered. And now his face hurt, too.
Dean felt his body begin to tremble, and he started crying. He pulled the coat off the hook, wrapped himself in it, and laid down on the bed and let the full-body sobs overtake him. It felt like hours as he sobbed brokenly and let himself feel the full measure of his loss.
“Gotcha,” said Angie, leaning back into her own workspace.
She spun around. “Hey, Dean!” she replied, pocketing her prize. “How are you? Thought you’d be with Cas. And Sam.”
“Oh, you know. Just decided to go for a swim in a freezing pond in all my clothes,” Dean said. “Don’t suppose you have dry shoes or a coat stuffed in that thing somewhere?” he asked, gesturing at Cas’s truck. A chilly breeze ruffled Cas’s hair adorably, and made his coat billow out behind him. Dean shivered. “I’m frigging cold.”
“He’s been driving for days. You’re both welcome to stay another night. Besides.” She grinned and poked him in the shoulder with her finger. “Kinda like having you in my hair. I’m gonna miss you when you go.”
“Maybe she’ll come make you some soup while you recover,” added the wide-eyed kid.
“Um, okay, yeah. I gotta- I gotta go, guys. Drive safe, okay?”
Cas stroked a hand across his cheek. “You do. You’ve certainly left me boneless and stunned silent quite a few times. Remember last week in the shower? I couldn’t stand up for ten minutes.”
Dean did as he was told, and was surprised to taste tea with honey, pleasantly warm and soothing. He sagged back against Cas’s arm. “Thanks, Cas,” he murmured. Cas was sitting on the edge of the bed, and without thinking too much about it, Dean leaned against Cas’s side. “You’re so… so good to me, Cas. You know I- I wish you were around more.”
“Yeah, well it was barely warm enough when the sun was up. Now it’s frickin’ freezing.”
“This is amazing,” she said as they dug into piles of deluxe pancakes. “I usually just end up eating, like, bologna slices and olives out of the jar for lunch.” The pancakes were light and fluffy, and with just a hint of vanilla and cinnamon. Castiel beamed at the praise.
for my help then,” Cas said, snatching the basket of rolls and heading toward the library behind Sam. Dean made a face at the back of his head and followed with the pot of sauce.
“No no no. Now,” she insisted. “Need to… ‘pologize...” She closed her eyes and sighed a long, drawn out mournful sigh. Then her eyes popped open again with a sudden thought. “I could pray! I could pray!” she exclaimed. “He’s n… can’t not hear me.”
“Together,” Dean whispered. “Let’s do it together.” He sat up and pulled Cas’s underwear off, tossing them across the room and narrowly missing the candles. He laid back down, lining up their erections, both hissing a gasp as they brushed together. “There’s so many things I wanna do to you, angel. Things I want you to do to me, but this time I just… I just wanna be able to kiss you, you know?” He cupped Cas’s cheek and kissed him, and with the other hand he began to stroke them both.
“Or we missed a spot,” Cas suggested. He pointed at an odd-shaped lump in the dirt pile. A dirt-encrusted piece of bone had been dug up with the grave dirt.
When it finally stopped, Dean and Cas reached for each other, and after the brief wordless check, moved toward Sylvia. She laid on the floor, her arms up over her head, but she sat up when Cas tapped her shoulder. “Is it- did it work?”
“Yeah okay but my stomach wants a twinkie,” Dean complained. “Cas, man, did you burn through all your grace just to fix my boo-boos?”
Dean was sitting on the edge of the map table, with Cas standing between his dangling legs. They were kissing, his hands in Cas’s hair, Cas’s hands palming over his chest. He was just starting to wonder if they could get away with fooling around a little more seriously when the door creaked open.
“...that’s fine…” she said weakly, so beyond caring about household goods. His tongue swirled over her stomach, interspersed with kisses. One hand kneaded at a breast, the other slid up and down her thigh a few times and then began to finger between her folds.
you. The one who - who always loved you, every moment of it, even at our worst moments.” Tears dripped down his cheeks. “I’m sorry if I had to ruin our friendship in telling you, but I’m not sorry that I saved you. I would like to still be your friend, if you can-”
“Nothing happened,” Gabriel said, at the same time as Sam said “I kissed him.”
“No thank you,” Cas said, gathering up packets of butter and syrup, a banana and an orange, and the carrier with the two coffee cups. “I should take this upstairs.” He bolted out of the room toward the elevators.
“Sorry we don’t have PB&J,” Sam apologized. “But there are three burritos, some beef chow mein, and half a ham and cheese sub in the fridge.”
Castiel appeared in the doorway. “I guess I shouldn’t have mentioned. I am sorry.” He filled a little paper cup at the sink and handed it to her, took a washcloth from the shelf and wetted it with warm water and handed her that too, as if he was quite used to caring for vomiting humans on bathroom floors.
“This is it on the left,” Sylvia said. “Thank god,” she added under her breath.
“Is that alright?”
“I was going to open a jar of pesto for him,” Dean said to Cas.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbled. “I guess.” He dropped a kiss on the top of Cas’s head. “And you’ve just been here watching movies and walking around the yard barefoot, huh?”
“How about food, Cas?” Dean asked. “With your grace low, maybe a little grub will boost you back up?”
Sam sat in Gabriel’s abandoned chair, and Eileen sat next to him.
“Me?” Cas said incredulously. “Dean, you’re the one in the hospital bed.”
“Please come home,” Dean said. “Stay with me forever so I can kiss that face every day.”
She sighed. “No no, I said that he and I were supposed to come but he canceled on me. But I figured, my hotel was nonrefundable so I might as well fly out - on a plane - and just come by my lonesome. I guess I should have clarified when we talked this morning, but I just needed to vent. Didn’t occur to me that you might be here too; you never said. But we must be pretty close to your place, huh?”
“Leave them be,” Cas chided, tracing his fingers over Dean’s forearms.
“You could say that,” Cas said, fluffing up with joy.
“Ohhh thinkin’ about our younger years,” he crooned. The dwindling bar patrons had pretty much tuned out from the karaoke experience at this point; they were not expecting the beauty and emotion of Dean’s voice. People were suddenly all looking at the stage again. “There was only you and me, we were young and wild and free.” He thought about the early days of the first apocalypse. Cas rebelling for free will. For him.
He slid his thumb under her chin and tilted it up, meeting her eyes. “I love you too,” he said. “And I don’t want to lose you. I’ve been stupid, so stupid, Syl.”
“Shit, we were in there forever,” Dean said as they walked through the parking lot. “Should we grab dinner and stop for the night?”
“Thanks, but… you know, wings. I’m set. Have a good night, guys.” He gave a little wave and walked off into the night before disappearing.
“You got
Cas let himself be pushed back onto the bed as Dean continued to stroke and tease him. Up around his hips, over the taut muscles of his stomach, then back to the task of removing his clothing. Dean lifted each leg as he pulled it free from the shorts and kissed from calf to knee.
“Oh my god,” she moaned, sitting down hard on the sofa as her legs started to feel wobbly. It hit her, the magnitude of what she’d been messing with and how badly she’d screwed up. “Oh god, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean-”
Castiel looked flustered, but he kept knitting as he talked about Dean. Meanwhile, Sylvia went to the other side of the room to consult with one of the more expert sock makers. When she came back, Cas had a decent start on his project, and the lady was needling him for more information.
“No way,” Dean protested. “He doesn’t get another birthday until I get mine. And you need one too, come to think of it. Nah, I think the next thing we’re gonna do is Memorial Day. Grill some hot dogs. Watch a parade.”
When Sam returned hours later and poked his head in the open door of Cas’s room, Dean was still wrapped in Cas’s coat and lying on his bed, sniffling and crying quietly. He sat up as Sam came into the room, and Sam sat next to him on the bed and put an arm around him.
Dean passed the playground area on his way to the car, and he paused for a moment to watch. Little kids being pushed on the swings, big kids fighting over prime spots on the merry-go-round, shrieking and running everywhere. He remembered taking Sam to playgrounds sometimes so he could run around and do dumb little kid stuff, and he’d stand back, well away from both the playing kids and the watchful moms, and scan the perimeter, watch out for threats, make sure they all were safe, Sam and all the rest of the families besides. Part of him longed for that again; to have that experience as an adult this time. What would it be like, being responsible for a little kid, with a loving partner at his side? He swallowed thickly. He and Cas had had their chance at that though, and it had almost destroyed them. He shook his head and continued toward the car.
“It’s the damnedest thing,” Gabriel agreed. “Would you care to oblige me with a friendly dance?”
“I am on Lime Kiln Road, as you said. Dean, there are numerous farms here. They all have long unpaved driveways. You’re going to have to give me a mailbox number or perhaps another landmark.”
They pulled apart quickly. Dean felt a surge of fear and guilt as he adjusted himself and smoothed his hair down. He glanced at Cas, who was studying him with concern. “Let’s not throw it at him right out of the gate, okay?” Dean said quietly. Cas nodded. “I’ll talk to him later.”
“Sorry, guys. That sounds rough. Most people have a little more time before they become empty-nesters,” Gabriel said. “Then again, most people become a couple before they raise a kid together.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Just eat your breakfast, Dean. We should get on the road.”
“I have to learn how to cook,” he said. He sprinkled a little pepper on them and started stirring. “I guess scrambled it is.”
Dean lost himself in the feeling and the sound, so much so that he was surprised to find himself at the brink of a toe-curling orgasm, without so much as a hand on his dick. He came for what felt like twenty years as Cas kept fucking him through it, pounding desperately into him, chasing his own orgasm. As soon as Cas had pulled out, Dean collapsed like a bowl of jello onto the bed, heedless of the puddle beneath him.
“Little did I know. I hadn’t been the first girl that this guy had messed with. There had been a few others, and the last one before me… well he’d gotten tired of waiting for her to return his advances and he ended up attacking her in his office one day and… it messed her up so much… I had known that the girl in my job before me had killed herself, but I never knew why until Gabriel told me.”
“Does Gabriel know about your family?” Cas asked.
Thunder boomed deafeningly, shaking the room, and a high pitched screaming noise shattered the lightbulbs and the nearest window.
“No, I’m fine. I’ll just sit here.” He patted the curved arms of the chair. “I suppose Dean won’t object to me watching over him, given the circumstances.”
He woke up to the rustling sound of Cas settling into the chair next to him. Still in his white shirt, sleeves rolled up, and his dark pants, looking decidedly more rumpled than usual. Even his feet were bare for a change. It was both nice to see him so casual, the lines of his body so much more visible, and yet worrisome at the same time, knowing that Cas was only this undressed because his grace was on the fritz, drained because of Dean. He looked up at Cas’s face, which was crinkled with worry. “Stop fussing,” Dean murmured, even though he very much wanted Cas fussing over him.
Sam had received endless offers of drinks and phone numbers, and even more blatant invitations, as the evening went on. He turned them all down politely, and no one was particularly obnoxious about it, but he was starting to get tired. He sat on a bar stool, nursing a beer and wondering if he should go check on the girls. They’d been having fun dancing last he checked, and he felt a little out of place hovering around them - the patio dance party was decidedly a young person’s scene.
“Oh, so I’m not rational when you don’t agree with me? That’s just… that’s just frigging…” They stared angrily at one another, neither willing to look away or even blink. How many times had they done this, Dean thought, argued and stared? And every time, the desperate desire to lean into all that fury and passion and just-
Cas sat up and started to take his shirt off, but Dean grabbed at it. “Uh uh. Let me.” He pulled it over Cas’s head and ran his hands all over Cas’s chest and arms, and then leaned in to kiss him. Less violent than their initial frenzy, but still just as hungry, he let himself savor the taste of Cas’s lips as his hands drifted down and unfastened those tight shorts.
“More often than not,” he agreed. “But whatever you did must have brought me here without my grace.”
Dean sat up and fumbled for the pink basin on the bedside table. “Nurse!” he croaked. Cas scrambled out of the cubicle and no sooner had he gone than Dean was puking his guts up. And if that was unpleasant on a good day, it was a million times worse on a swollen, sore throat, with a mouth that barely wanted to open enough to mumble words. He wondered if his face would actually split open, and then he wondered how swollen and awful it really looked. Maybe this was the dumbest time to try to confess his crush to Cas, while he was barfing and looking like the freaking blueberry kid from Willie Wonka.
“Why the hell are you in New Jersey, and when are you coming home?”
“How long? Have you guys been together for, like, ages behind my back?”
Dean had ignored the wobby plastic furniture in favor of lugging one of the heavy wooden chairs out of the motel room, and was seated in that, which had the added benefit of being large and comfortable enough for Cas to perch on his lap. Cas was looking adorable in a soft gray polo and faded jeans, and his hands were busy with a complicated knitting project that required multiple sharp pointy bits sticking out all around it. Dean watched his hands hypnotically. He had no idea what this monstrosity was going to be, but it looked deadly. Like a terrifying pink wooly porcupine.
“I am so happy for you guys,” Sam said. “Wow.”
Sylvia woke the next morning with a slight headache and cottony mouth. For a moment she felt okay, then she remembered. Gabriel’s dead, her brain screamed. Dead, dead, dead. And there’s an ex-angel in your basement instead of him. Her chest felt achy and empty, but she had to deal with this situation. She managed to make herself get up, wrap a robe around herself, and trudge downstairs.
“Then don’t hurt me.”
“But of course, you do very much enjoy-”
Dean sighed. “Well, get some sleep I guess. See ya in the morning.” Dean clicked his phone off and returned his attention to the conversation. “Sorry, Gabe. Where were you? Belgium?”
“You’re lucky your friends got you here as fast as they did,” said the nurse. “I haven’t seen this severe of a reaction in a very long time.” She wrote something on his chart, then looked at her watch. “So, we’re going to let this drip for a while then recheck some things. Doc is hopeful that we’ll be able to get you well on your way to recovery and send you home in a few hours with some meds. Alright? Call button’s there if you need anything. And I mean anything. Don’t let him up without assistance,” she said, fixing Sam and then Cas with a firm glare. And with that, she swooshed through the curtain.
“Do you need help, hon?”
“Uhhh… yes? But we can go next week.”
He grabbed her hands and tugged her to her feet. “So are we settled? You’re my main squeeze?”
“Will do. Goodbye, Claire.”
“Look, there are a whole bunch of open seats there,” he said. “Why don’t we sit before we miss our chance.”
Somewhere in Maryland they stopped at a truck stop, where Dean spent a good half hour dumping quarters into the claw machine until he was able to present Cas with a hideous stuffed green elephant. Cas grinned with delight and hugged it to him like it was the most amazing gift in the world, and Dean decided that all the effort had been worth it, even if he had been trying to get the cuddly teddy bear holding a heart instead.
“Dean,” Cas said, the word full of both reprimand and reassurance. Dean knew exactly what Cas was saying. He thought Dean was beautiful, sexy, perfect, and he didn’t care about a few extra pounds or wrinkles or gray hair or any of that. Dean gave him a soft look of gratitude and appreciation, and resumed popping fries into his mouth.
“I kept begging Jack to help, but I never heard anything from him. I guess I was mad at him. When I got home and you weren’t there… everyone else was put right back where they were. But the bunker was empty.” He shook his head. “I can’t believe he’d just leave you there. And he had nothing to do with this, huh. Just some accident.” He squeezed Cas’s hand.
The restroom was tiled in shades of beige and brown with white accents. It was spacious and bright, and remarkably clean. A row of five sinks lined the nearest wall, with large mirrors above and between them. Four urinals ran along the back wall, and then the stalls were to the right of those. The stall enclosures were sturdy, and covered from just above the floor to well above head height, affording much more privacy than the average restroom, and as Cas soon found out when Dean shoved him into an empty one, they were quite large inside as well, easily twice as large as the average bathroom stall.
“That’s my girl,” Dean chuckled. “Yeah we’re gonna need a stack of those things.”
Cas made a face and scratched the back of his neck. “Fine,” he sighed. “While you do that, I propose that Sylvia and I find a bar. I believe that’s the traditional coping mechanism.”
“Dean,” he said warmly as he answered the phone. “You’re not driving, are you?’
“You know I had a long chat with Sylvia before. That’s why I came looking for you.”
And then Dean spotted him. Lying on the floor, ten yards or so in front of him, just visible through the thinning clouds. A crumpled figure in rags. Bare feet, tattered slacks, a once-white dress shirt gone grubby and stained with blood. And tousled, dark hair. He was face down in the dirt of the old barn, in the spot where he’d once stood proud and unafraid and let Dean stab him through the heart.
Cas was silent. His eyes flicked all over Gabriel’s face, reading him. “Will you tell me what happened?”
“No word yet.” Dean grabbed the shovel and slid down into the hole to begin digging.
“You went with priest?” Cas asked in disapproval.
I missed you,” she gasped as he kissed down her throat. He lifted her up, wrapping her legs around his waist, holding her steady with no effort at all.
“You know,” she said. “It’s not even like I had any right to expect Gabriel not to... We were not exclusive, that was very clear, so… oh god, I totally blew up at him and it’s not even fair. I sounded like such a psycho bitch,” she moaned, leaning against Cas’s shoulder.
Dean grinned. “Orange, because I want to watch you eat that banana.”
“Hello,” she said, giving a little wave to Gabriel. “Sam, can we talk? Maybe we can go for a walk?”
As the worst of the flood died down, he whispered Cas’s name, over and over again, rocking back and forth with the coat pulled tightly around him. He could smell him on the coat he hadn’t worn in years, on the bed he’d never slept in. He could feel Cas all around him, wrapped through the core of who he was. How could he keep existing without Cas here, when so much of him was tied to Cas? “Cas, I’ll find you. I’ll get you out of there, I swear I will, or I’ll die trying,” he gasped through his tears. “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t. Can’t let you go.”
“Oh, I know what my dad thought. Let’s not even go there.”
“I’m at a truck stop. Figured I’d check in on you while I’m stopped. How’s it going?”
“Sylvia,” she answered.
“No! No, I uh- that’s nothing, Cas.” Dean took the bag and shifted the lid of the weapons compartment just enough to stuff it in there. “No mold experiments, I promise. C’mere.” He grabbed Cas’s face and kissed him, and Cas melted into the kiss eagerly. Dean smelled of sweat and grease and soil, and something about it reminded Cas of purgatory. That hug when Dean had found him by the river. He never could have imagined then that he’d someday have the privilege of kissing Dean, no matter how much he longed to.
“Oh, why not,” Sam said. He’d gotten most of the way through his drink and he was feeling agreeable and relaxed. He stood up and held out his hand. “I’m a terrible dancer but, sure. Let’s go.”
“I’m so sorry,” she whispered, stricken. She placed a hand on his chest, over his heart, as if she could soothe it with a touch. “Oh, Gabe, I had no idea. I just didn’t want to be clingy. I went too far in the other direction, huh?”
While Dean dealt with his purchase, Sylvia browsed through the accessories aisle out of boredom. She ended up buying a beaded seat cover, glittery fuzzy dice, chrome skull-shaped tire plug covers, and three rolls of blue shop towels just because they were on sale. She put the new accessories on while Dean pulled Cas in for a kiss before holding the door open for him.
Dean dozed fitfully while they were gone. His stings all seemed to be either burning or itching, some of them both. He scratched at the itchiest ones, but then they hurt worse. It was miserable, and he wished Sam and Cas would get back so he could gripe to them about it. He put the TV on and flipped it to the classics channel and watched the antics of the Fonz for a while until he drifted off.
“You cannot mean… you’re just always flirting and- and maybe trying to get into my pants,” Sam said. “It’s just a thing. You hitting on me. Just you being all… you know, a player. It’s not serious.”
“Relatively speaking, yes. Oh, um. Sylvia, this is Sam,” he said, grabbing Sam by the elbow.
“Okay.” Dean kissed him. “Okay, I’ve got… gotta get stuff from my bag.” He pulled away, went over to his duffel bag and returned with a purple bottle and a strip of condoms in his hands. He sat down and looked at them, licked his lips nervously. “This is… new territory for me.”
In the morning they woke up already horny and humping each other in their sleep. With little finesse, they rolled around together until Dean was on top of Cas, hands clasped together on either side, and they thrust until they both came messily between them. Afterwards they showered together and headed back toward home.
Sylvia popped the lid off the grace container and shook the precious drops into the disgusting mixture in the bowl. Then she dropped in the feathers and began to recite the incantation.
“Oh, this sounds like a story,” Sylvia said. Castiel offered her an arm and helped her up off the floor. “Tell you what, I’ll make some cookie dough and dig some beers out of the basement fridge, and you and I can dish all about it.”
“Sam’s got a girl,” Dean said gruffly. He gave Sylvia a sideways glance.
“A kiss?” Dean repeated, dumbfounded. “So I have to go kiss someone? Big deal! I’ll put on my best shirt and head out to the Stumble Inn tonight, I’ll be fine by morning.”
“I don’t regret what I did,” Cas said. “And I certainly didn’t expect to be brought back. I hope that phoning you wasn’t a mistake.”
you are,” Cas said.
“Anyway, I think we’re going to stay for a while yet. Haven’t even hit the pool tables. And I still need to get Cas onto the bull,” Dean said, quickly derailing the Biblical discussion.
? We could have decided together. Isn’t that how this is supposed to work?”
“You look good, too,” she said, staring hungrily. They kissed again, hands wandering everywhere. Sylvia started walking them toward the couch, but Gabriel grabbed her hips and stopped her.
Shock washed over her as his words sunk in and shifted into place. She drew a shaky breath and reached up to play with a strand of his hair. “You really have been. I don’t know why you think you’re bad for me. I happen to think that you’re the best thing that ever happened to me. Even with the whole trying to ghost me and breaking my heart thing.”
After the song, Dean exited the stage to applause, and people leaning in and telling him “great job” and “that was fun!” all the way back to his seat. He sat back down next to Cas and tucked an arm around his shoulder.
Dean put his fork down and sighed. He looked over at Cas. Cas was giving him that wide-eyed hopeful look. Dammit, those eyes. Impossible to resist. “Fine. Fine, I guess I’ll go.”
“That’s a good start,” she said. “I mean… we could move this upstairs for rounds 2 through 7.” She shifted and they pulled apart, and he touched her forehead. Ahh, the magical clean-up; she’d really missed that perk too. Not that it was the most important thing, but it was nice.
Dean grasped himself and started pumping in time to Cas’s thrusts. “You gonna come for me, Dean?” Cas growled. “I’m close, too. Your ass is so tight, Dean. I’m going to come deep inside you. Come for me, Dean, my love,” he kept murmuring variations on this until Dean shouted and shivered and twitched, and his ass was tightening around Cas like a vise. Cas squeezed Dean’s shoulder and thrust into him, one, two, three more times as wave after wave of ecstasy washed over him and his whole body trembled with it.
“Your coat, Cas. Toss it over!” Cas looked uncomfortable, but he slid his trenchcoat off and passed it over to Dean. Dean draped it around himself, pulling it up over his head, and laid his head on his folded arms on the table top, feigning sleep. “Tell me when she’s gone,” he hissed.
Dean grabbed one of the slips and scribbled something on it quickly, then strolled up to drop it on the table. When he came back, Sylvia leaned over. “What did you pick?”
“We never should have dragged you into that. I’ve had a lot of time to think about it since then. Sure, we saved people, but that doesn’t justify how we treated you. I am sorry, for my part in that.”
“I love it,” Dean said breathlessly. “Where’s your new friend?”
“No you’re not,” he said, his voice a dangerous growl. “I don’t know who or what you are, but you have just made the biggest mistake of your existence.”
She took the disgusting bin out with her, and then Cas and Sam came back in. Sam was holding an open bag of Doritos. “Dude, no,” Dean said. “Get them out of here, asshole.” He could smell the stinky cheese powder and it was threatening his stomach again.
“What the hell?” Dean said, turning around and glancing over the top of the pamphlet to read the wheel. “Do you need glasses, Cas? It says-”
“What are you making?” asked the stranger to his right, leaning closer toward him. “I’m Angie, by the way.”
“This sucks,” he grumbled. “Hangovers are stupid.”
“Yeah, well it ain’t enough in this situation,” Dean grumbled. “I got goosebumps.”
“I’m so sorry I put you through that, man,” Dean said. They exchanged a gentle smile. “Thing is, I was tr- oh. Oh boy.” He laid his hand against his stomach, trying to calm it. With his other hand, he yanked the oxygen tube off his nose. “Gotta get that nurse back here.”
Dean stuck the fork in his mouth. “So it’s okay if I tell people?” he asked around the mouthful of food. “I was gonna ask. Before we got home. Because. You were never out of the proverbial closet, as far as I know. Unless you told Sam and not me.”
“I just don’t understand,” Sylvia said. “You invited me and then, what, you changed your mind? But why did you lie?”
dumb. But I finally let Cas talk sense into me. And maybe you don’t need to be a dumbass about this.”
“It sure beats the alternative.” Gabriel slid onto the stool next to him, bumping their knees together. Sam waved the bartender over. “Something fruity and frozen with lots of rum,” Gabriel ordered, slapping a few 20’s down.
Castiel sniffled, and realized that he was crying. “I love you, Dean Winchester.”
“Cas, what
“I didn’t think I was going to see you again,” Sam said. “I thought you were done with me.”
Sylvia set up at the end of a table and pulled things out of her project bag. Her current project was a sock, which had proved to be very slow going and she was starting to wonder if it was more trouble than it was worth. Still, she decided to plug away at it. It had been very expensive wool.
He didn’t have the advantage of alcohol in his system this time, so he was running on pure passion. He looked at Cas as the song began. That was enough.
“Oh, I noticed that too,” Dean laughed. “Usually it’s all the women, and a few of the dudes. Now it’s just switched around.” He slid his hand up Cas’s back, setting it on his shoulder. “Man, I’m just glad to know that at my age I’ve still got it.” He steered Cas into the next tent; the prize wheel had caught his eye. Among the swag laid out on the table were brightly colored keychain bottle openers, the good kind, and Dean wanted one.
“Yes, I do see your point,” Castiel said. “Perhaps a blank check for further kissing is in order.”
“They’re dating,” Sam signed helpfully.
Human eyes didn’t see very well in the dim light from the distant streetlights. He opened the car door to make the light come on, and sat on the seat to see what it was that Dean had been so eager to keep from him.
,” Dean said. “The last time you were human, because I couldn’t take care of you properly. Nothing about that was alright!”
“I see,” said Dean icily. “So is she hot or something?”
“Hell yeah I was. I ain’t regretting it.” Dean’s eyes fluttered open, and Cas’s heart skipped a beat at that first flash of mossy green. “Don’t get me wrong. I wouldn’t change a thing. That was awesome.”
“I’m well, Sam,” Cas said warmly. “Thank you.”
“Why do you have these, Dean?” Castiel demanded. He stood up, toe to toe with Dean, bristling with anger. “Why would you keep these from her? After everything-”
“Dinner and a show,” Cas remarked. He was carefully laying out his prizes from the day on the dresser.
Dean and Cas found Sam leaning against the car, and moments later Claire and Kaia emerged from their room and greeted them. They all grabbed coffees from the motel lobby and were soon packed into the Impala and on their way.
“It’s me, Dean.”
Sam looked miserable, and Cas was about to ask him if he was feeling alright when the emcee came out and the show began.
Dean had the offending mug raised to his lips, taking a big sip of coffee. “It was clean,” he said.
After a quick dinner of cheeseburgers, which Castiel had been eager to learn how to make, and sweet potato fries and kale chips, which he was a little less certain about, they drove the short distance to the library where knitting club was held. The sun was dipping low in the sky as they went into the building and down into the basement meeting room.
“No new styling products?” Cas asked. “Perhaps an odd chemical reaction?”
Dean snapped his fingers. “I knew I forgot about something while I was slaving away in a hot kitchen for hours to feed you all.”
Cas put the TV on a movie channel, some sort of cheerful romantic comedy. He watched for a few minutes, but he found that he couldn’t stop thinking about Dean, naked and wet under the shower spray. He’d been invited, after all; it seemed silly to skip out on that experience. He stripped down and followed Dean.
Sam’s driving was enough to set his teeth on edge on a good day, but a panicked Sam driving while Dean was already feeling like shit was just awful. Only the feeling of Cas’s fingers slowly carding through his hair, and stroking down his arm was keeping him together. In this moment he knew that Cas wouldn’t let anything happen to him, that he was safe here with Cas holding him, and he almost wanted to cry from that feeling.
Sylvia felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over her head. “What?” she heard herself asking, her voice sounding far away. It couldn’t be true.
“Well it’s too late now,” Sylvia said morosely.
“You must have thought that he abandoned you,” Castiel said sadly.
“Bathroom?” Sam asked.
The sleeve of his green flannel was almost completely burned away, hanging in charred tatters around his elbow. His flesh was badly burned as well, second and third degree burns from his hand up to his bicep. Dean’s face was pale and clammy; already he was going into shock, and he clutched at Cas’s shirtfront with his good hand. He whimpered and looked at Cas with desperate eyes. Cas hadn’t seen Dean so out of his mind with pain since Hell. He longed to wrap him up and soothe him as he had then.
Dean shrugged. “Cas, you don’t have to. I really just wanted to spoil you, but… I mean, play if you wanna play.”
“Oh, that’s good news. I was wondering… so, it’s Friday, and Friday nights I usually go to this bar… do you think you guys might like to come?”
“You would,” Dean said, putting an arm around Cas. “You and your terrible taste.”
“I could perhaps go with ‘cherished one’?” Cas suggested as Dean slid into his seat and started the car. “Or… I understand that ‘bae’ is currently very popular. Sylvia called you my ‘boo.’”
Dean and Cas exchanged a look, each challenging the other to say something first. Finally, Dean cleared his throat and said, “I recently learned how important it is to tell people… things. Just sayin’. Somethin’ to work on before hot wings galivants off again, maybe.”
“How about pie?” he said, a little too loud and rushed.
Dean sighed. “Okay, okay. Um, so Cas, when people text emojis and stuff, when they want to text sexy stuff, they have to work with what’s there. So it became a thing that… because there’s an eggplant emoji, that just came to mean… you know…” Cas was still frowning and looking confused. “It’s a dick, Cas. Eggplant means dick.”
Cas squinted and tilted his head. “I think that’s probably meant to be a kind gesture, coming from Sam.”
Gabriel broke a mozzarella stick and pulled it apart, staring at the cheese string in fascination. “Good, because I don’t think I could have dealt with that. Guess we should, you know, talk about… stuff.”
“You saved my life. I would have died-”
“Good, I spoke to him this morning. He stopped in Springfield, Illinois overnight. The car is behaving a little strangely, but he’s certain that he can coax her to behave.” Castiel smiled fondly and stared off into space, as if he was seeing Dean’s face and not the side of the refrigerator.
“Sam?” The soft feminine voice came from behind him. Sam pulled his hand away like it was on fire and spun around.
“It’s… actually kind of hot,” Dean admitted. “Huh. Only on you, Cas.” He headed toward the bathroom, pausing to give Cas another look, then a full once-over and a wink.
“Shhh,” Cas soothed, bruising his cheek with a thumb. “It’s alright.” He leaned in and they were kissing again, softly and slowly this time. Kisses and tears mingled, he realized that Cas was crying too when he touched his face.
“I also learned to cook and knit,” Cas said. “Sylvia taught me- oh! Sylvia! Dean, I was supposed to introduce you! It’s been hours, hasn’t it? Come on.” Cas jumped up from the bench and pulled Dean’s hand.
Dean had just strolled out of the booth where the local Rocky Horror shadow cast was handing out flyers and giving out beaded necklaces, all in costume, when he spotted his boyfriend. His drop-dead gorgeous, too hot to be left to his own devices, love of his life, hopelessly devoted boyfriend, with his arms wrapped around someone and holding them tightly against him. Dean was three long strides towards them and composing a tirade before he recognized the figure in Cas’s arms, and by the time he reached them he was just confused.
Sylvia asked Dean to tell her about Gabriel, and  he hesitated for a moment, sipping his beer. “Well, we started out trying to kill each other,” he admitted. “But we got over that eventually. Nah, Gabe was a good guy in the end. He went through a lot of crap and came out swinging. I am sorry that he didn’t make it back.” He opened his mouth as if to say something else, but gave an imperceptible little shake and took another long sip of his beer. “Man, Cas, remember TV land?”
“Yeah,” Sam agreed.
They walked in the main entrance. Ahead of them was a large dining room leading to a stage in the back, the bar running along the right wall with patrons clustered on stools and bellied up to order drinks, and wide stairs running up the left wall with a sign pointing upward reading “Rooftop Patio.” To either side there were doorways leading to smaller dining rooms. A conflicting cacophony of music came from each area, jarring and confusing.
“Can’t believe the hottest piece of ass in this place is drinking alone,” said a voice behind him. “Must be my lucky night.”
“He said it was going to be grace, but it turned out that he didn’t have any left. I have to wonder if it was a total bait and switch all along. So there was the feather as a substitution, which of course was Castiel’s, not Gabriel’s. Some herbs and weird fruits - those he made me buy in bulk so I have a shitload left. And some blood.” She slid her sleeve up, displaying a large adhesive bandage on the inside of her forearm. “That part really sucked.”
Sam’s driving was far more tolerable now that Dean wasn’t actively dying. The hospital was actually quite close to their motel, so in no time Dean was being helped into the room, this time between Sam and Cas, for the agonizingly long stumble from the parking spot into the room.
Ten years since she’d seen Gabriel’s face last. She’d prayed to him often, and never thought that he might not be out there to hear her. It was hard to know how Gabriel had ever felt - they certainly weren’t some exclusive, committed couple - but she had never stopped loving him, hoping that she’d at least see him again. Sylvia frantically snatched at the tissue box with shaking hands as she started sobbing uncontrollably.
Dean had stopped at a truck stop just across the Delaware River. He was too nervous to eat anything, but he brushed his teeth and combed his hair in the bathroom, peering critically at himself in the spotty mirror. Too many bags under his eyes, too many wrinkles, gray hair popping all along his temples, going soft and pudgy in the gut. What did he have to offer a guy like Cas? And that was just the surface stuff.
“I talked to Sylvia this morning,” Cas said.
Together they picked out some basics, sneakers and jeans, shirts and socks and underwear, and soft gray fleece pajamas. “I don’t want to spend all your money,” he said, hesitant when she encouraged him to pick out a few more things.
The Blue Moon was absolutely the place to be on this, their busiest Friday night of the year. Dean parked the Impala in the gravel parking lot across the street; already the music was loud enough to be heard clearly as he stepped out of the car, and people crowded the wide front porch and the second floor patio. It was mostly a twenty-something crowd, and among that it was mostly men, much as it had been some sixteen years ago when Dean had last visited.
“Oh, that was nothing compared to Dean’s performances.”
Cas looked at Dean softly. “When you’ve held someone’s soul inside of your very being, such that a part of you is branded upon them and you’ve seen every little facet of who they are, and fought the legions of Hell to save them, it’s hard to mind little things like poor table manners, questionable driving habits, buying the laundry soap that makes me itch because he forgets that I told him that that one made me itch, and putting ketchup on eggs, which I have since learned is an abomination in spite of what he had led me to believe.” He took a deep breath. “Though I do have moments.”
“Dean?”
They split up, Cas and Sylvia leaving the park and heading down the street, and Dean heading off into the festival. He debated texting Sam, but he figured he’d much rather just find him. Catch him off guard a little. Maybe the element of surprise would make him a little more inclined to talk.
Cas’s eyes were shining as he clutched his armful of prizes. “I’m glad you got yourself something too. Though I wouldn't mind competing in one of these to get you a gift.”
Cas shrugged. “Maybe it is. We’ll figure it out.”
“Sorry. Uh. Yeah,” Dean said distractedly, closing the app and jamming his phone into his pocket. “Just. Answering messages.”
The humans were still sleeping. He could feel the gentle hum of their souls, all warm and fuzzy and ensconced in nice dreams. Perfect chance to begin. He snapped his fingers, just a tiny exertion of his grace extended toward Dean. Harmless, really. He had only to wait. In the meantime, he had some typing to do.
The conversations in the room, little pockets of chatter here and there, shifted into other gossip, but Castiel continued to ponder this exchange. He hadn’t thought about it in so many words until then, but of course, it was true. He would grow old at Dean’s side now. It should have been frightening for a formerly immortal being, but it seemed like exactly what he wanted.
“Just like that?”
Dean nodded. “Okay. Um. Just so you know, you’re the first person I’m telling but you ain’t the last. I’m gonna… I’m gonna be totally out now. Like maybe not a big announcement type thing but… I’m done with trying to keep people from knowing.”
“Well here we are,” Gabe said cheerfully. “Hanging out.”
“I thought that the driver traditionally picked the music,” Castiel said, squinting at the back of Dean’s head.
“Cas, you gonna wear flowers on your head?” Dean said. He regretted the words as soon as they were said; he knew he sounded judgey and critical. But Cas didn’t seem ruffled.
“We’re both good. Things are still pretty quiet out there. I found one possible haunting that I sent Jody and Donna on. How’s Cas?”
“I don’t need the Worst Hits!” Dean exclaimed. “Shit. Okay. Nevermind. I love you anyway.”
Sam stood by, wringing his hands nervously “I should take Cas to get his car back, though. Do you think you’ll be okay while we…”
Dean felt the blackness of unconsciousness wash over him.
“What kind of question is that?” Dean muttered. He looked at Cas, hopefully far enough ahead that he couldn’t hear. Not without ultra angel hearing anyway.
Gabriel made a noise of faux-outrage. “You didn’t.”
Dean fidgeted with his coffee cup. “Hey, so uh. I really hate to… after everything else you’ve done… if you need us out of your hair it’s no biggie, I can find us a motel but… thing is, I gotta replace my alternator before I can get us home, because my car just basically died in front of your house.”
“Still.”
“No, Cas, I… just come in with me, okay?” And before he could protest further, Dean had grabbed him by the hand and pulled him through the door.
“Fine. I’m riding the bull.” He tugged Cas along to stand in the line with him. Sam waved them off, muttering something about a pool game, and he ducked back out of the room before they even got very far.
“I can’t believe you scheduled my meet and greet this early,” he mumbled. “Did I miss karaoke?”
“The last person who called me using that voice was Lucifer,” Dean said. “So maybe try another way to fuck with me that’s unique, because I’ve already-”
“Thanks Cas, I think that’s probably good enough that I can sleep now,” he said, wiggling his shoulders to dislodge Cas’s hands. “Can you throw the covers over me?”
Sam made an undignified snort. “No, he wasn’t terribly interested in the show, so he’s off enjoying the rest of the festival,” Cas said. “You should come with me after the show and hang out with us. I think we’ll probably grab some dessert at the food trucks.”
“I believe she loved him more than she’s been saying,” Castiel said. Dean stared into his beer with a frown. “What are you thinking about, Dean?”
“I thought you said it was a raincheck,” Cas said teasingly.
True to his word, Dean made short work of the carnival games. He popped balloons with darts and got the aforementioned giant teddy bear. He tossed rings around bottles, one after another, and got a pink inflatable baseball bat. He squirted the clown’s mouth with a water pistol until the balloon popped, and got a giant plush chocolate donut. He threw a baseball and knocked over stacks of bottles and got a mirrored Led Zeppelin picture. “Okay, that one’s for me,” he admitted. “It’s going to look awesome hanging in the Dean cave, ain’t it babe?”
Dean was quiet for the rest of the drive, but Cas and Sylvia were too caught up in their own chatter to notice him brooding.
“Something like that,” Cas said casually. “I thought you might like that.” He continued to finger him, each stroke with a nudge to his prostate, just enough to make him crave more.
Since the Impala was as good as new, Dean offered to drive them. It was another new experience, one hand on the steering wheel, the other clasped Cas’s hand on the seat between them. He thought about finding a secluded spot to park and slipping into the back seat with Cas, sometime soon. Maybe once they were headed back toward home.
“I can’t! I can’t call him; I told him I loved him! You can’t just… It’s my understanding that that sort of thing ruins friendships. Makes them uncomfortable.”
“I gotta do some cleaning,” Dean said, wincing around as he pushed the door open. He hadn’t really looked at the room in weeks. It was far worse than usual. Beer bottles, food wrappers, trash, laundry. It was evident that he’d been barely hanging on. “I’m sorry.”
Dean grinned. “Cas, you sly dog. You’ve been watching gay porn!”
“Absolutely. Thanks for tucking me in, Cas. What about you? Your batteries starting to recharge?”
Cas handed over his armful of prizes to Sam, paid the cash, and took up the hammer. “One swing, make it count,” the guy said.
“Dean…” Cas said warmly. They looked into each other's eyes, too much to say out loud in a crowded bar.
Sylvia snorted laughter. “Neither. They’re each other’s.”
“Are you Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor?”
“No, I saw it,” Sam said, dropping to sit on the ground. “You guys having fun?”
Margo went up next, some sexy Britney Spears number. Sylvia and her friends cheered her on as she danced and sang through the whole thing. Afterward she wandered over to the bar and let men buy her drinks. She didn’t seem to have any intention of going home alone.
Sam peeled the cucumber carefully in silence. Dean watched him, wondering if this was about to be a big “before” and “after” moment in their lives. Like maybe this would be the last time Sam looked up to him.
“My point exactly.” Dean picked up the song booklet from the table and started flipping through it. Nora was up on stage, rocking out to “It’s Raining Men.” The rest of the gang were cheering and egging her on.
“Aww, I’m glad you were able to get some honey after all,” Dean said. He picked up the bag and looked at it.
Dean’s expression softened. “That’s what matters,” he said, patting his knee.
“On your knees,” Cas said. Dean complied, even as his knees complained at him as they hit the hard tile floor. He started with a tentative little lick, then another. Cas seemed happy to let Dean write the script here, so he continued with the teasing little flicks of his tongue as he stroked him slowly. This was always a fun way to warm up, to tease Cas until he was so needy that he took what he wanted from Dean - which, Dean had discovered, was even more fun.
“Nah, just grab the thin mints from the freezer.”
She squinted. “A do-over to break my heart?”
Dean cranked up the air conditioning and kicked off his boots as soon as they got into the room. The creaky old machine was slow to bring the temperature down, and he ended up stripping down to his boxers before sitting down to eat.
The nurse came back in a moment later. Fortunately she decided to stop Cas outside of the cubicle and yank the curtain shut in his face. “Common side effect,” she said cheerily. “Let’s get you cleaned up.” She got him a paper cup full of water and a cool, wet paper towel to wipe his face with. “How about the other end? Oftentimes that’s next.”
“Did he tell you that he ditched me?” she demanded.
“If you say so.”
“‘S good stuff,” Dean agreed. He reached over and brushed the backs of his fingers gently against Cas’s, the faintest whisper of a touch and yet so connecting. “Good stuff.”
“Well excuse me for being bisexual and single for most of my life!” Dean exclaimed hotly. “Just because that’s how things used to be don’t mean I’m gonna screw around on you, because I would do anything for love, but I won’t do that!”
He shrugged. “Must have been a powerful spell. You were looking for Gabriel and he’s… did you not know?”
“You looked like you were gonna crap yourself,” Claire added.
“I have work. I really need to get a few hours in on this project. Just come knock on my office door when you’re ready to introduce your boo to me.”
“You love it,” Dean said with a saucy grin. He put an arm around Cas’s waist and pulled him toward him, and when that got a smile, he leaned in for a kiss.
“I didn’t say that,” Cas said. And the next thing Dean knew, Cas had spun them around and now Dean was being pinned against the wall and Cas was grinding against him. One hand splayed out on Dean’s throat as he kissed him, a dirty, demanding kiss. He seized Dean’s hand and pulled it against his crotch, fumbling at his fly, demanding Dean’s fingers there. Oh, so he wanted to play it like this? Well, Dean was certainly game. As Cas finally freed his cock and wrapped Dean’s fingers around it, Dean whimpered. Oh yes, he liked this.
“Hey Gabe,” he said. “Somehow I think you could arrange a great view if you wanted. Like, conjure up a VIP box with champagne and underwear models.”
A short time later, Castiel walked through the library. Gabriel was very innocently reading a graphic novel. Cas waved and walked through to the kitchen, and Gabe heard the rattling and clinking associated with the coffee pot being put to use. The pot was gurgling out its last few drops when a shrill scream came from the direction of the bedrooms.
“Dean you feel so fucking good,” he grunted. “I had no idea it would be this good.” He was sweating already, flushed with arousal and desperately wanting to go harder, faster. “How- are you- is it good?”
“Hello!” she said cheerily, whipping off her oven mitt and offering a hand to Dean. “It’s so good to meet you!”
“A real kiss, an open-mouth kiss of passion and affection,” Sam continued to read, wincing. “Preferably with- with tongue action.” He scowled in disgust and tapped at his screen some more. “Yeah it’s really weird but a bunch of other hunters concur. The only ones that lived...”
“You want this one, too?” Dean asked, letting himself be pulled closer to Cas’s body.
“Shit!” he exclaimed around a mouthful of fries.
“Sam, you’re not this stupid,” Dean said, shaking his head. “Yeah, I can guarantee he’ll be here for dinner.”
shit yes, right there. Fuck my ass just like that sweetheart,” he babbled, interspersed with nonsensical utterings and screams. He was writhing on the bed now, it was all Cas could do to hold onto him and keep fucking him exactly like he asked. Cas’s hands were still slippery from the lube and now the sweat pouring off them both, and he had to dig his fingers in to hold on.
“You’re right, it’s not how it works. You can decide that you’re not going, but you can’t order the rest of us not to.”
“No, no. Moulin Rouge. Come What May.”
A smile came across Castiel’s face, eerie in the wake of that question. “For love,” he said.
Cas! Give it to me, cover me in it, I’m gonna come too, keep… just like that-
“Yes, it’s just outside the kitchen window, it really is quite pretty here and-”
“I love you, Dean.” He nuzzled against the back of Dean’s head with a contented sigh.
They drifted in different directions, with Sam following Claire and Kaia toward one side of the park, near the vendors selling t-shirts and souvenirs and all kinds of crap, and Dean and Cas heading through the rows of pop-up tents. Some of them were community organizations, like health groups that offered STD testing and counseling and stuff like that. There were some mainstream businesses that were hoping to reach out to potential customers and let them know that they were welcoming of their lifestyles and their disposable income alike. Dean lost count of how many people tried to sell him siding and insulated windows and bathroom remodeling and travel packages. Cas had a bad habit of stopping and chatting with every single one of them, and filling out the little slips for the drawings, and accepting all the promotional swag they were offering. “You know they’re just trying to get your phone number so they can call you and sell you crap, right?” Dean asked as they walked along.
“So I had a look at the schedule, and after this band that’s on now is the drag show. We should go watch that.”
“Yay!” she exclaimed. “Oh Cas, I’m so glad for you!”
“I’m good for it, really,” she promised. “I wouldn’t be doing half so well if it hadn’t been for Gabriel in the first place.” She plucked a blue polo shirt with thin green stripes off the rack and held it up to him. “This one makes your eyes
Sam flushed and looked away sheepishly. “I guess,” he stammered.
Most of the hotel rooms around Lincoln were booked solid, but fortunately there was a cheap motel just outside of town that was too skeezy to attract much interest. Claire and Kaia had already gotten a room and texted the Winchesters about it. There were just two rooms left when they arrived Friday afternoon, and they snagged them both.
Breathlessly, Cas mouthed down Dean’s collarbone, sucked on the salty skin, and then headed lower. Licking and sucking his chest, then down to the softness of his stomach. He placed dozens of kisses here, murmuring how beautiful Dean was. As he got lower, Dean’s whimpers and moans grew louder and more desperate. “You like this?” Cas whispered. “Shall I take these off you now?” He brushed his hand across the soft cotton underwear still covering Dean’s hip.
“Ohhhh yeah,” Dean said. “Baby, you are the best.”
“We were on the phone,” Cas said. “He was giving me directions to the farm. And he disturbed a wasps nest and was attacked. I- I was so afraid that I wouldn’t find him in time. I didn’t even know if you were near enough to see, or if you’d been attacked as well. And I knew that he couldn’t physically talk anymore, but he was still praying-” Cas’s voice broke, and Dean felt the hand on his arm trembling. Cas had been scared for him? He hadn’t been certain that Cas could hear the desperate praying in his mind, and he hadn’t considered how terrifying it must’ve been for him. He felt both guilty, and yet warmed that Cas cared so much. Carefully he moved his hand, just able to bend it enough to place it over Cas’s hand and sort of pat it. It was the best comfort he could offer. He felt Cas exhale a deep sigh.
