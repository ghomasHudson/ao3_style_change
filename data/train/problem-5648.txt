saying yes, just to be clear," Tony asserts before Michael can respond. "Absolutely yes." He makes grabby hands for the books. It's an impulsive decision, he knows, but he's got all the info, and he knows what's what. He wants to help. He wants to save people. He wants to make up for every mistake made and then some.
"Don't be jealous, James, it's not a good look on you." Steve leaned forwards and picked up one of the teacups, playing along.
He was struck with a well of affection for Bruce; the physicist knew him so well. He had even set out Tony's favorite coffee mug next to the machine, a red and blue ceramic cup with a white star at the center,
"I-I think I can read it," Tony gasped out, his head jerking up and down with the force of Steve fucking into him. "Please,
"Yes! We'll buy things that are organic, right? Check the ingredients. Natural stuff, with no preservatives." Natasha was already digging through the pantry to find the reusable bags she knew were in there. "If we can divide and conquer, it shouldn't take long."
Scissoring his fingers, he lifted his legs into the air and bent them as the knee, using his other hand to pull his ass open. He hurriedly slipped a third finger in and groaned, "Steve..."
Tapping a small curricular picture that looked like a camera lens, he laughed again when the screen changed to show
"Of course," Steve answered, his voice barely above a whisper, "but we need to talk. I messed up. You can't put all the blame on yourself."
- he walked back into his bedroom and grabbed a pair of socks. "Want to tell me why you found it necessary to hang out in my room while I was in the shower?"
The page appeared on the screen above his head, and Tony ran his hands down his inner thighs, trying to pretend it was Steve's fingers that dipped into the crevice that connected his thigh to his body, and ran his hands up his torso, slowly pressing into his waist and reaching up to rub his nipples. His hips began to move on their own, arousal cascading through him.
"It's escapism," Natasha said, leaning against a bookcase and peering around to see Tony, curled up under a blanket. She watched him often, and Steve knew that if Tony had any inkling at all how often Natasha essentially spied on him, he'd be furious.
"Yeah, you will." But Tony still sat, taking his own tea and dunking another cookie in it. "It's cold," he complained.
The sound of coffee percolating had been long ago tied to Tony. Just like the gentle whooshing and beating sound of a rug being aired out reminded him of his mother, or the quiet scrapes of steel against wood was his grandfather. They could go for months without seeing each other, but every morning Rhodey would hear the sounds of the coffee machine finishing up, and he would flash to Tony, curls askew, pajama bottoms wrinkled, staring longingly at the pot. Young. Small. Full of uncapped potential and innocence and sass and brilliance.
She took a deep breath. "Okay, how about this? I know that you guys don't know me from a hole in the wall, but I want to
"Well, thank god." He was across the room in five strides, pulling Tony into a tight hug before doing the same to Steve, standing on his toes to reach. Realizing what he was doing, both Steve and Howard snapped back, clearing their throats awkwardly. "Sorry! I'm just… I'm happy for you. For both of you." He gestured between them. "I approve of-of this. I mean!" His face went red. "Not that you need my approval but-"
Unwillingly, Howard sat. Standing felt better, but he was pretty sure his knees were going to give out. "I don't understand."
Steve is gentle as he wraps the casts and washes him, edging around the arc reactor and rubbing lightly over the bruising and scrapes. When he washes Tony's hair, Steve lets him rest his neck on his left forearm, and lathers with his right hand, always conscious to not allow any soapy water to get into Tony's eyes.
It was a week into this experiment and Tony still was unable to get Steve alone to feed him a prompt. And to apologize. He loved Steve. He wanted to be with him. Plan a life together, be all cute and domestic and lame together. All that stupid, cozy shit.
The one flaw in the plan was that Tony was wrapped around Steve like a four armed octopus. It was cute, but it presented a problem in getting up. When he had first met him, Steve never would have guessed that Tony was a cuddler. Not even a little bit. But being
Steve smiled, his happiness bursting through. He pulled a small, black box from his pocket and opened it, showing Howard. A simple, gold ring with little diamonds embedded around the band sat inside. Howard's eyes went wide, his hands freezing as they cleaned the table.
"I'm bored." Tony said. "Like, super bored. As in, all my current projects are done and honestly, I need human interaction or I'm going to go postal."
"Of all the people to like," Bruce muttered to himself, "you choose the most complicated." It was true, but only half so. Bruce had a feeling that the Other Guy took to Tony not only because Tony was the only one not afraid of him off the bat, but also because
"Yeah, I'm the one who got him into rehab." At his incredulous look, she pressed on quickly, "I'm the one who chose
That night, he donned on his best clothes, took the tin from the ice box, and headed back to the speakeasy.
"Spoil sport." But Tony didn't mind. He grabbed a cookie, tugging from Steve's arms, the soldier rolling his eyes as he did so. But seeing Tony willingly eat was wonderful.
. Which was why he retreated to the roof so often, hearing aids hidden away safely in his pocket, and nothing but the cool expanse of blue in front of him.
Natasha shook her head, her face worried. "Steve completely losing his cool, I think. Wasn't sure that was entirely possible."
Tony was in bed sleeping when Rhodey let himself into the suite, curled up on his side and hidden by the blankets. It was disturbingly quiet. Usually the dishwasher was running, the television was on, or Tony had music playing. At the very least, he and Steve -- and sometimes the others -- would be on the couch chatting away like high schoolers in the cafeteria. Open containers of takeout on the coffee table, half empty tea cups and discarded saucers, and shoes piled by the door, a hammer hanging on the hook… All signs of the family Tony had made for himself.
Howard took one step, and then another, his unease palpable. Bruce figured he only came to his apartment at the request of Thor, who no one could easily say no to (at least Bruce couldn't). "If you think it can be fixed," Howard spoke to the wall beyond Bruce's head, his back stiff with his fear.
Thor threw his head back and laughed heartily. "You are not as walled up as you would have us believe, friend. Now come, have a snack with me, while you wait for Steven."
, Howard was confused, hurt, maybe a little angry? He didn't know. But he stumbled back, hitting the door frame.
"I know." It took a lot for Steve to relent, but he didn't want to spend another minute thinking Tony was mad at him. That's what the debriefing room on the Helicarrier was for. "I don't support this," he pressed on before Tony could protest. "I can't lie to you and say I do, Tony. I just can't. But I'll still be here. Whatever you decide. It's gonna take a lot more than a time traveling father to chase me away from you."
"Right, you don't like me either," in Howard's drunken mind, for whatever reason, this was funny. He laughed. "I'm the most hated man in- where am I again?"
Tony threw a napkin at him. "You're not much taller than me, father. They say the apple doesn't fall far, well I didn't have far to go at all!"
Just one night, that's all he wanted. One night to tell Stevie Boy what to do to make him come. Suck him. Fuck him. Eat him. He'd give anything for it.
"I...M...no, that's an N. Y...O...U...R...A...S --" leaning back from the machine, Tony turned to look at him, eyes unfocused and furrowed. "Dr. Rogers?"
That got Tony's attention. He looked up at Steve, his eyes wide and his voice quiet. He was emotionally spent and tired of fighting everything that had built up within him. "It's just. I don't know what this is. I can't work; I can't do anything. I feel useless."
stayed!" He head whipped back and forth between Tony, Steve, and Fury. "I took the good with me. So the me that didn't time travel, he's-- he's…"
: This is amazing! NGL, I came so hard. Do you take requests? What if he wore Steve's colors and Steve couldn't help himself?
"Thank you, Tony," Howard said, just as quietly, as if he spoke loudly the spell between them would be broken.
"You are both hurting deeply right now," Thor added. "He made a rash decision. It can still be fixed."
Tony waves his hand, placating. "JARVIS, be nice. I'll donate fifteen new PlayStation consoles if you leave Clint's alone." He hasn't even been up long, but already his eyes are slipping shut. That's what several days of only sleeping in increments would do to anyone, let alone someone recovering from being injured.
As the years passed them by, Tony grew, not as much in height, but he filled out. He went from a baby faced young man into an adult that turned every head as he walked by, but he still had those wide, brown eyes. Rhodey looked into them often and still saw the small little teenager who just needed a friend.
“Can we talk in private? We want you to reconsider your decision about the donation. It’s not a good idea, Steve,” Gerard said, with a little frustration in his voice. “This is how your father intended it to work. The hospitals should be given the freedom to do with the money as they please, wherever they need it,” he explained. “That can be for free procedures, or somewhere else. We shouldn’t force their hand like this.”
office, as his father would put it - Steve thought with distaste. But he wasn’t going to stay there a second longer. He was furious at his father for not letting go of the subject, furious at his mother for enabling him, and furious at himself because even through all of his anger, he still wanted to please his father. He still felt like he had something to prove, like he had to make the ‘wise choice’, no matter what his heart dictated.
Gerard was quiet for a moment before he spoke softly. “You don’t know anything about my life, Steve. I had problems and I was in need of money, and your father
Steve grinned and after getting off the elevator, introduced him to his tech head. “Tony, this is Miss Potts. She will be taking your interview today. You will work with her if you’re selected.”
. Someone who wouldn’t put his life in danger. He would make jokes again. He would roll his eyes again. Isn’t that what Steve wanted? Would he risk Tony’s happiness just because he was selfish? Would he be able to live with the guilt of something happening to Tony if he didn’t do as the kidnappers want? Even before he finished the thought, Steve knew the answer to that question. He breathed in and finally made up his mind. He was going to do it. He was going to save Tony.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Barnes. But there’s nothing else we can do,” a woman, who Steve thought was another nurse, said to Bucky’s mother.
“What is it?” he asked, though he already had an inkling. They had not been happy about the cancellation of the charity fund and his plans to completely revamp it.
“I know that, Tony! That’s not what this is about. Look,” Steve said, sitting up a little. “I know you don’t need my help. But that doesn’t mean you should reject all of it! There is… a certain grace in allowing yourself to be open to help as well, Tony. I know you might not need it, but if people who care about you want to help you, then… you should allow them to do so sometimes.” Steve shrugged. “It’s for their benefit too. It makes them feel needed. It makes them happy. If they want to do it so dearly, then it’s okay to allow them that opportunity, Tony. You don’t need to do everything alone. You
Steve laughed at his words. “We don’t have a mausoleum, I’m afraid. My mother’s wish was to be buried here. So we are stuck with you common folk.” He grinned at Tony.
Natasha was sitting inside the office, with her head glued to her phone. She looked up as Steve entered.
“Hmm.” Sarah contemplated for a moment before continuing, “You say taking over the company would make you lose your morals. That you would feel like you were exploiting people. That you actually want to help them. But why can’t you do that as the head of the company?” she asked.
need to shut yourself off. Let me help you, once in a while. Please.” He took Tony’s hands into his own.
“Steve! Hey! Are you alright?” Tony asked, alarmed. “Hey, look at me!” He grabbed Steve’s arm and forced him to look up. “Look at me. It’s fine, it was probably just a car backfiring. There’s no danger. Deep breaths. Follow along with me.” Tony kept eye contact with Steve as he helped Steve to breath. “In and out. It’s fine.” Steve didn’t let go of Tony’s arm as he followed Tony’s instructions.
“Hmm. That does seem fancy,” Steve acknowledged. “We could go to Paris.” His eyes lit up. “That seems like fun.”
“Stop, turn around,” he told the driver, and gave him the new address. Tony’s apartment. It wasn’t far from his own home, maybe a short ten minute ride. He wanted to see it one more time, take in the coziness of it, before he went and potentially got himself killed.
Suddenly, he could hear sirens in the distance. “Shit,” Gerard cursed before suddenly holding a gun to Steve’s head. “What did you do? I told you to come alone!”
” he screamed out. Dread was creeping through him as he realized that Gerard wasn’t gonna let Tony go at all. He was gonna kill them both and Steve had to do something.
“What does anyone want from someone like you, Steve?” he said slowly. “I want money. You understand, right?”
“I’m on the way, but I want Tony released right now,” Steve demanded, growing angry at the nonchalant tone of the person’s voice. “And I want proof of it,” he added.
Tony stared at Steve for a minute before hugging him tightly. “Okay, Steve,” he whispered into his ear, before letting go. “If it means that much to you… then okay. I’ll accept it,” he said smiling. “But, you need to realize you can’t do this every time. You don’t need to save everyone, whether they need it or not. Rather, you
“Wait here for a few minutes, please. Thanks.” Steve tried to manage what he hoped was a smile and got out of the car. He faced Tony’s building and surveyed it.
As soon as the door was closed, Steve started talking. “I don’t want to be in your position, Dad! Why won’t you understand that? All my life you’ve dictated what I should do. All my life, you planned everything for me, and I agreed to it, didn’t I? I agreed to all of it! Then why can’t you, just this once, just this one time, agree to what I have to say?” Steve’s voice broke, his blue eyes scrunched up with tears. “I don’t wanna be the next billionaire. I don’t want your title. I don’t want your connections. I don’t want your money that you’ve leeched off of people by exploiting them-” Steve slammed his mouth shut and let out a long breath. He closed his eyes to calm himself. Here we go again, he thought. Just like clockwork.
“It is nice out today, isn’t it?” Steve asked Tony, his head raised and eyes closed. He had a smile on his face as he breathed in the fresh air and sighed contentedly. He loved those sunny days where a slight breeze was happening. So much so, that both Steve and Tony had decided to ditch their little rendezvous at the coffee shop and instead take their coffees and take a stroll through the nearby park. It was peaceful there with the birds. They should come here more often, he thought. It was also not that crowded, he noted with a glance around, and he suddenly had the urge to hold Tony’s hand. He looked discreetly down at Tony to find him in a daze, a frown on his face.
“Steve, don’t,” Tony warned, a dangerous tone in his voice. “I told you this because you are my friend, not because I want some pity charity money from the latest billionaire on the block,” Tony said, his voice growing agitated.
After choosing what he wanted and paying for his drink, Steve stepped aside for Tony, who always had the same drink every time. Steve couldn’t believe how someone could settle on a choice so quickly, without even considering anything else.
Gerard whirled around, wide-eyed and suddenly pointed the gun at Tony. Steve could see panic in Gerard’s eyes and sweat running down his face and knew that at any moment, he was gonna pull the trigger.
Suddenly, a loud noise went off outside and Steve jolted in his seat. He looked around wide-eyed before covering his ears as tightly as possible. No, no, not right now, he thought, as he started hyperventilating. He tried to force himself to calm down, but it didn’t work. What was it that his therapist had told him to do? What was it?! He couldn’t recall no matter how hard he tried, which made him panic even more and he started rocking himself in his seat. And just like that, he was right there at that exact moment - when it happened. He could hear his mother’s screams as she was thrown from the car. He could hear the sound of glass breaking. The lights on the road overwhelmed him - it was too bright. He could hear the distant sirens of the ambulance. Someone nearby was wailing. Steve wished they would shut up already. Couldn’t they see he was trying to sleep? Someone grabbed him by the shoulders.
“Yeah.” Steve sported the biggest grin as he gazed up at Tony. “Okay, my turn.” Steve said, covering his eyes. Tony spinned the globe, before telling Steve to point.
“Do you think I made the right decision, Mom?” Steve asked in a quiet voice. “About the company? Don’t you think someone else should take over instead? I mean, this feels a little like nepotism, and I hate it. What do you think? And don’t just tell me what dad would want. What do you
.” Steve said the last word in a tone that made it clear it wasn’t his own. “My father had started the initiative, and had presided over the event every year. This is the first year I’m spearheading it, since his passing.”
Then everything suddenly seemed to amp up as he hit the ground. The lights in the room suddenly seemed to overwhelm him. He could still hear sirens somewhere in the distance. Someone nearby was wailing. Steve wished they would shut up already. Couldn’t they see he was trying to sleep? Someone grabbed him by the shoulders.
one!” A familiar voice said from beside him. He whirled around to find Tony staring at him from a seat at the counter. He had the same exasperated look on his face as everybody else.
“Well, I’m glad. Now can you please ask someone to get me coffee before I start having withdrawals?” Steve asked, grimacing a little.
“I, uh, I’ve been trying to build this geolocation sensor that’ll keep track of the places you’ve visited. Sort of like a travel diary? But automated. It’s a pet project of mine,” Tony said, still a little stiff. “But uh, it’s hard to find resources. Money is a little tight right now, and the job doesn’t pay much, so…” he muttered and left the words hanging.
"Jesus, Fury, just spill it!" Nine heads swivelled around to stare at Natasha. She threw her hands up. "This is hard enough! We are on the verge of losing a friend! Or are we not? We don't know because you're dancing around the damn subject!"
"Nope." Grinning, he leaned forward, "We elves try to stick to the four main food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corns, and
He laughed. "Everything is served in gelatin." At her disgusted face, he shrugged. "I can get good meals out, some high quality French shit, but my servants have fallen into the trends a bit too much. Even Jarvis." Glancing up at the ceiling and then back at her, he grinned.
"And Steve? If sometimes your best is only 50%, that's okay too. But I know with certainty that you were at full capacity on that day in Rochester, and even if you weren't, you are not responsible. The man that released that demon creature is. I just… You know I always looked up to you?"
"As you should be. I could bounce a quarter off that thing. All the squats in the world won't give me an ass like that. But you're missing the point."
Tony didn't hesitate. He mixed the cleaners and solvents with an expert hand. "This is dedicated to every winner of every science fair
He could tell Bruce was weighing his next words. He always shifted from one foot to the other when he felt he had something important to say but didn't know how to voice it. Steve was patient, waiting him out with a calm understanding. The doors opened when Bruce finally found the words.
With a sassy twist, Tony tilts his head up to look at Joseph. "You might want to fire your marketing department."
But other times, he sat quietly, writing down descriptors and passing along his notes surreptitiously to Steve or Bruce. Just in case.
Rightly contrite, Tony gave Steve a sheepish smile as he batted away Rhodey's hand. "Sorry, I have my own shit to work on too."
Steve let out a breathy whine at that. "Tell me about it." He slid his finger in deeper, crooking it up so it grazed against Tony's prostate, gently beginning to stimulate it.
"I can do that." Carefully, Steve backed up toward the bedroom, gently maneuvering Tony along with him until he could pull Tony onto the bed. Steve lay on his back with Tony on his chest, legs tangled together. Tugging the comforter over them to keep Tony warm, Steve asked, "Do you want to talk about it?"
But Steve's eyes widened. Apparently, he spoke 'Tony,' because something clicked and he understood the words buried underneath the stilted and jumbled mass of verbs and nouns that tumbled out of the genius' mouth.
"Sir is in his workshop." The voice was clipped and short, professional in the way a boss fires his secretary.
"Yeah. Something about Bruce's birthday and the Tanger Outlets on Long Island." He eyed Steve sardonically, "Look, I don't ask questions when it comes to Point Break. I just let it be." He chuckled, "You wanna question a god's motives?"
"He's not, Pep, I swear," Tony defended. "He's really good at letting me be who I am with barely any complaints. It's
"You know what, Steve," Howard snapped, standing up straight and getting into his face as best as he could with Steve towering over him. "I'm sick of your attitude. I'm sick of you hating me for shit I haven't done yet! I'm sick of-"
But then the war happened. And his priorities shifted, squeezing out any chance of children. He had no longer felt the urgency to have them, even years later.
When the bed dips, Tony has to grip the edge to keep from rolling toward him. His knuckles go white with the strain.
They were in the penthouse kitchen, Steve at the breakfast nook, flipping through the newspaper and sipping orange juice. "Knock 'em dead," he cheeked.
It took a moment for Howard to gather his words, Thor could see him struggling. He looked away, studying the door frame and Thor could easily imagine he was looking into the hours past. "He told me," he gasped out, "about him and-and Steve. About how they are gay. And in love. But he used another word, he said-"
This was getting out of hand already. "Okay! Back on subject! I get that you tried, but we're going to
A well placed elbow to the ribs had Clint doubled over, but all it did was help him misplace whatever control he had. He lost it, giggling and laughing so hard tears started to stream down his face. "Clint!" But the euphoria of the night hadn't worn off of Bruce either, and he felt his face split open into a wide grin. "Barton, conceal! Don't feel!"
Tony gave James a triumphant look. "Whatever, man," Rhodes said, lighting a cigarette for some other dame. No one could say he wasn't a gentleman. "If he'll do it, then it's just fine. If not, I'll take care of it."
"You and I, Howard Stark, are going to have a conversation." Lifting Mjolnir, he pointed it at Tony's father, dipping his head forward and raising his eyebrows in a way that clearly said,
"I don't know how you were raised," the woman spoke again, "but if your father never told you, I will. No one has the right to touch you unless you explicitly say it's okay."
Releasing him, Tony snatched the package, "Gimme!" Steve let him. It wasn't like he could ever say no to Tony, not with things like this anyway. Tearing it open, Tony plucked out a plastic bag and ripped off the top, dumping what was inside into his hand. "A pin?" It was small, circular, with a pallet knife and a paintbrush crossed in the middle. Around the outside it said
"No, thanks." He ignored the complaint, continuing to thump his feet. "Anyone else home?" Steve asked, watching as Tony discarded the old filter and measured out what was surely too many scoops for the amount of coffee he was making before leaning back, scoop still in hand, to get a good look through the door to the living room. Natasha had cleaned up the puzzle, apparently over it, and was nowhere to be seen.
"Oh God!" he exclaims, rushing forward. Tony looks confused for a second before Steve is on him, wrapping his arms around him and lifting the smaller man from the floor. "You're alive!" His tears are coming faster now, in relief and joy to see Tony. Alive. Not dead. Safe. Not at the bottom of the Pacific. "Tony, oh my God, Tony!"
"Can I go to my room? I'll sleep better in my bed." There's a pleading quality to Tony's voice, and Steve pauses in shifting him. He glances at Clint - who shrugs - then back to Tony.
Which reminded Howard that he hadn't had anything to drink the entire day, and his body was trembling lightly.
. "I've got coffee in your Captain America travel mug—by the way, that's so sweet I think I just got a cavity—and lunch reservations at Gino's. We need to have a talk."
In the bedroom, he gently tugged off Tony's sneakers and socks, jeans, and t-shirt, replacing it with a pair of his own sweatpants, his own hoodie, and a thick pair of slipper socks. Tony’s feet felt like ice and Steve wrapped his hands around them, trying to massage some warmth back into the appendages before pulling the fuzzy fabric over them.
"You bet," Steve brought his hand up to cup the back of Tony's head, kissing him again, deeper this time, trying to pour all the confidence and contentment he felt into it. When he pulled back, Tony beamed at him.
He put his arm around her as she held her phone up for a selfie, "What brings you ladies out today?" He gave his best smile as the camera clicked.
But he could tell that Steve was worried. They all were. He was never much of a fiction reader before, and he was sure a psychiatrist would have a field day with him, but he really did like the escape.
He set the bottle down next to him and kissed Tony deeply, "He's fine, Tony, trust me. Nothing is wrong. He and Clint just chased a pizza with a bottle of vodka, apparently. Nat just needs help getting them to bed."
She poked her head into the room, knocking twice and pasting a smile on her face. "Hello! How are you? I'm Natasha." The album talk immediately ceased as the five men stood to shake her hand. She took stock of each of them, mentally listing everything she knew about the members. It didn't hurt that in her more innocent youth, she had been completely enamored with them, that is until she grew up and out of manufactured pop and fell right into metal and rock. But that meant she had a good feel for what they were about as artists.
Steve felt it as he shifted Tony in his arms, pulling his head down to his chest. "Angel?" he prompted, kissing Tony's head. "Talk to me, sweetheart."
When he approached Clint, he told him he loved light bondage, like being tied up. Not a lie. He kept this one truthful simply because he liked Clint's reaction to it. And the not so subtle bulge growing in his pants. Clint was known to enjoy tying his partners up.
After a few minutes, he stood and made his way to the bathroom to clean himself up, and curled back under the covers, naked and sated, reaching around the floor until his fingers closed around his phone.
He does his best to maintain an air of professionalism, but his cheeks burn red as he carefully pulls Tony's shirt off. He almost flees after helping him step out of his pajama bottoms, his eyes anywhere but on the man in front of him. Tony, at the very least, is too tired to protest or make any snappy comebacks.
Tony couldn't pinpoint exactly when it was he began to just feel sick. Constantly. It probably started months ago, but by the time March came around, the days he felt ill and the days he didn't blurred together in a new uncomfortable normal that he was becoming less and less able to compartmentalize.
Steve was smiling, he adored Cara. She was an amazing writer and her exuberant personality not only reminded him of someone else he knew, but it also brought out his own. It was honestly too bad she could never know who he really was, but even still, having someone to fangirl over Tony with was fun. He didn't like lying to them, but the fake profile on Facebook was necessary to keep his cover. Roger John Stark. A bit obvious, maybe, but the use of Tony's last name was common among the fans of his, as it was for the Steve fans to take on Rogers.
"That's funny," Tony said coyly, his lips quirked up at the corners, "I'm always in the mood for bratwurst. German it is."
Bruce threw his hands in the air. "He's a mess! They had a moment? At least that's what Steve said, but then Tony shut himself away and honestly? I need a vacation after this." He took a deep breath and motioned that he was done.
"Don't think so. Just us," he answered, pushing Steve forward a bit to get to the sink and fill the carafe with water. The heat under his hand was tantalizing. Steve was so warm; he could only imagine curling up against him an a cold and snowy night, fresh coffee in one hand, Steve's face in the other as he kissed him...
"Of course you do. You're a fucking whore." He bent down and kissed Tony's cheek, right where the hand print was. "Such a beautiful whore. Just for me."
Steve watched in horror as the man lifted it, aiming for Tony's head. He could see Tony looking up, abject terror on his face when he realized exactly what type of danger he had put himself in by leaving the armor. Above, the quinjet tilted and tried to take aim. "We don't have a clear shot yet, Steve!" The body of the dragon, enormous and bulky, blocked the quinjet from the other side.
Pulling his legs out from underneath him, Tony sat forward, agitated and annoyed in the way only Rhodey could accomplish. "What's that supposed to mean?"
The shield left his hand with a flick of the wrist, he had no memory of doing it after. But he remembered -- afterwards -- how it connected with the man's arm and severed it. He could only spare half a thought to his own mental state that it took that long to use it as it bounced off a lamppost and careened back into Steve's grasp. It was a bit violent, honestly, a bit too gory, but the bastard had aimed for Tony.
"Steve and Tony?" she asked, tentatively, unsure of how much she should insinuate. Rhodey had taken Tony out to lunch -- and out of everyone they knew -- he was the best at knocking sense into the stubborn genius.
But he worried, as he so often did, that one day Steve would have enough and leave him. Where was that line? Where did Steve decide that he couldn't do it anymore, that he wanted stability, someone who wasn't ill, someone who wasn't half out of his mind from depression. And that jolted Tony, to admit it. But the mystery of his health had sent him down a dark hole.
His comrade was full of love and giving, determined to better the world. Damaged, yet still kind. Broken and weary at points, but always ready to fight for the world. He was resilient. Strong. Stubborn in his love of technology and hellbent on advancing modern society and creating an easier way of living for everyone in the world.
But on the rare occasion that he did venture outside, he truly enjoyed it. The March morning was crisp and dry, and when he exited the building and turned toward the market, he breathed in deep. In and out. Taking in the fresh air and centering himself.
"Your loss." Tony grumbled, swiping his phone open again. He paused, contemplating, before tossing his phone to the other side of the couch and shucking his clothes. It was always better when he was naked.
Steve unfolds a comforter. It's a spare one, taken from the hall closet, blue and soft. Thick and warm. It's not enough. He spreads it over Tony, his hand lingering by Tony's shoulder before falling back to his side. "I'm-" he swallows, looking away. "I'm real glad you're okay, Tony."
. But it was also complacency. They had their peak, twenty years previous: throngs of fans, record breaking albums and tours, number one after number one after number one… they were just happy to still be able to make music. Maybe there weren't
Clint was panting, his fist close to a blur, his back bent over as he gave into the pleasure. "So fucking pretty, so fucking beautiful, I'm going to make him filthy."
Coulson's lips twitch. "That I do. What I can tell you now, however, is what my first few years as an angel were like."
"You don't wanna know what I did, Ma," he murmured softly to her sleeping form, "but I'd do it again if it meant saving you."
Tony woke up on the fifteenth morning to an e-mail (and so what if he made an account, IronDick69 wasn't taken, so he jumped at the chance.).
"That's… That'll always happen, Tony. No matter what. When one of your charges is about to die, they tell you. But—" he closes his eyes, hand going to his chest. His distress is evident, and it's freaking Tony out.
Rhodey had already written his best man's speech. He wasn't ashamed. It was good too, just the right amount of sentiment mixed with humor and memories. Love for both Tony and Steve. They were the real deal, a romance that Hollywood would be envious of, two damaged men finding their missing pieces in each other. Finally, Tony could put all of his trauma behind him.
None of this matters at this moment, however, as Tony's heart clenches at the sight of Steve. He looks beaten like he's throwing in the metaphorical towel and giving up. It hurts to see him so upset. Steve, regardless of their first meeting, has become something of a beacon for Tony. His strength and courage is something Tony tries desperately to emulate. Steve is the glue that holds them all together, both beautiful and strong at once. So it's no surprise that Tony had fallen head over feet for him.
Steve's concern, his love, and his own welfare hung in the balance, teetering on the edge of one of his branches, barely holding on. Steve had already suffered so much in his life, had already endured far too many hardships. It wasn't fair to him.
Rhodey's face dissolved into one of disgust, "I try not to think of my little brother having sex, thanks. That includes any discussion on Steve's…junk."
Steve was conflicted. If what Tony was saying was true, they really weren't all that different. He had taken a hit job to try and save his Ma, and Tony had taken over the
Dropping back into the armchair, Clint plucks his phone from the charging dock on the end table, scrolling through to find the menu.  "I'm always down for a diner-burger, Cap."
"Knew you'd like it." Bruce could tell Tony wanted nothing more than to take Steve's hand. He could see his fingers twitch in contemplation, but though their friends were supportive and accepting of their relationship and the country's view was shifting, society as a whole was not. He hated that they had to hide.
Clint allowed the back legs to the wooden chair he was on crash back against the floor. "Hill, eight o'clock," he said, sotto voce to Natasha, who sat next to him.
In the middle of the altar, placed in an abalone shell, was Steve's last gift to him. A pin from his youth, something given as a token of friendship just weeks before he disappeared into the vast cold of the Arctic.
It all came down to the separation between the different Howards he had encountered. He had been treating the situation as if there were three of them: The Howard he had known in World War II, the Howard that had raised Tony, and this one. Back when he had first started dating Tony and he had first separated the Howard of the 40's from the one Tony knew, it was simpler. And it was the closest to what Steve had to do now that they had all the answers they needed to move forward.
"Yes." There was no hesitation. His brown eyes connected with Steve's, open and honest in his answer.
She sighs, glancing at Tony again, but she strides over and sits in one of the other vacant chairs. Coulson and Fury return to theirs.
"What did we sign up for, more like." Bruce said, rubbing his eyes and sending his glasses up his forehead.
"Thank you, JARVIS." Turning to look at Howard, she jerked her head in the direction of the living room. "Let's talk."
Steve looks like he badly wants to respond to that, but instead, he plucks the parsnip from Tony's hands and drips it into a Ziploc bag with a handful of the beans. "I like parsnips better anyway," Steve finally says as he zips the bag closed.
"I always loved your drawings," she said instead of answering. "You're amazing at capturing emotion."
Steve's hands flew to Tony's waist, gripping to hold him up, while he mouthed his way down the length and gave one long lick upwards. Tony's body gave a jolt. "Shit, you're good at that. Had practice then?"
Tony hummed in answer, taking another bite and following it with a sip of milk. "I am an idiot sometimes, though."
Tony was starting to move, the armor dented and wrecked by the force of the tail. Unable to stand with the armor so compromised, Tony's hand slammed against the emergency release latch and the suit cascaded open. He didn't see the man, that much was obvious, the large carcass hiding him.
The AI responded, "I know, sir, Agent Barton and Dr. Banner have been inquiring about when you were awake to inform you. Shall I tell them?"
"Momma, she, uh, had a cake made. Three tiers, eighteen layers in all. Vanilla cake with chocolate frosting and mocha filling, my favorite. He didn't show. I blew out the candles with just her and Jarvis and Ana. The next day he went to get some cake and complained - loudly - that he hated this flavor and why would anyone get it?" Steve listened as Tony spoke, as always tempering the anger he felt when Tony mentioned the abuse and casual neglect he faced growing up in that household. He slowly ran his fingers through the hair on the back of Tony's head, a small comforting gesture.
"I'm with Steve. We're in love. He makes me happy." Tony began to step forward, foot raised and hand reaching out, and
Walking to the door, he called out over his shoulder, "At least I'm predictable!" And left. Once again leaving Tony to his thoughts.
Tony's knees went weak. He had kissed countless people in his years, and none had sent such a voltage through him. How could one person cause so many emotions to flutter within his chest?
"How did the water look?" he tossed over his shoulder as he finally found an MIT zip up hoodie that might have been his at some point.
He had to admit, flying was a good idea. Banking a hard left and switching trajectory at the last moment, Tony sailed upward, moving his arms out just enough to spin in the air. It had been almost two weeks since he had last flown. Since he had last done
The archer silently digested what he said before nodding. "Okay, Tones." He stood, tilting back his mug and emptying it down his throat. "But if you ever want to talk..."
He caught the paper as the printer spit it out, reading quickly and heaving a long suffering sigh. A monster would have been so much easier to deal with. But it was there, in black and white. The DNA from the scotch glass matched Tony's on a paternal level.
There were precious few things in the world Bruce held above science, but a love like Steve and Tony had was one of them. He envied, but he always supported. He knew there were many who would rally around Captain America and Iron Man's relationship, but there were just as many who wouldn't.
He was working again, sleeping less, and had some energy back. When he appeared in a new black suit on the morning before his doctor's appointment, Steve could have cheered. Yes, the recently tailored suit showed how thin he had gotten, since it wasn't the oversized clothes from Steve's own closet, but it was the first time in a while that Tony had made an effort with his appearance.
"Aren't you at all happy to see me?" Howard shot back, holding his glass out and pointing with his index finger. At Steve's stony face, he dropped his arm. "Want a glass?" he tried, picking up an empty tumbler, "This is good stuff."
With his nose buried in one of their discarded Starkpads - and Natasha knew he really shouldn't be looking at that if he was who he said - she was able to quietly swing down and snag his abandoned scotch glass before swinging back up and making her way to Bruce's lab.
He couldn't control himself when Tony rode him. He couldn't set the pace and slow down if he felt it would be over too soon. It was one of the reasons he loved it so much. Tony would ride him, and it was like diving into a wave at the beach. You could only control so much before you were shifted in the water by the power of the current. He moved to take hold of Tony's erection, but his hands were forced back.
Tony sighed contentedly, "You're amazing-" he laughed, a clear sound that crinkled the corners of his eyes, "-and I'm not cold anymore."
She waved her hand, dismissing the thought. "Hypotheticals aside, it's not okay for him to do that to you. Tony, I like Steve, but that sounds controlling to me."
Clint pointedly ignored her as she stalked to the coat rack by the door, instead turning to Howard for the first time, "Any food preferences, Asshole?"
"Then we keep trying. Tony, listen, I don't know much about time travel." Letting his fingers trail up Tony's face, he gently cupped his cheeks, tilting Tony's head so he could look into his eyes. "But you're still here, right? You haven't vanished into thin air?"
Being in the future was really starting to lose its curb appeal. No shiny electronics or technology could erase the fact that he was not only regretting this but completely done with it.
"I don't feel very protected right now, Steve. I feel like you think I can't handle my own shit." The grey t-shirt he swiped from Steve's drawer was too big for him, but combined with his fitted jeans hanging low on his hips, he looked both adorable and sexy as hell. Had Steve not royally pissed him off, he might have enjoyed teasing him, playing a game of coy innocence and driving him wild again.
It was the first of many mistakes concerning the entirety of this… Well. Debacle seemed the only fitting term. And he was still somewhat confused, but it was becoming clearer and clearer with each moment, each dive back into every minute of the previous two weeks.
She tilted her head, "Privacy smivacy. Wait," she glared, hand held out. "Is Bruce making you his pancakes?!"
He ignores it and presses the pillow into his face harder, letting himself cry. Just a little. A few tears, hasn't he earned that right? Hasn't he been through enough that he's allowed to mourn the loss of what he can't have?
He couldn't help but wonder -- especially as he watched his heart walk along the landing pad -- where did Steve fit into that particular puzzle? The one in the compact spitfire package with large brown eyes and a heart the size of Texas. Did Steve even belong anymore? Was his cut just too bulky to smoothly click in with the other bits of Tony's life?
"You are most welcome, Agent Romanoff. Your manners, as usual, are impeccable. I wish I could say the same for Agents Barton and Hill."
Tony stood by the dresser, fiddling with the wire to the lamp placed on top. He was worried, that much was clear, but Howard couldn't imagine anything Tony could say would be all that bad. He may think differently in ten years (
A while later, they were laying on the bed, faces next to each other. Tony suddenly sat up, remembering something, and turned towards the bedside table.
“Damn, you weren’t lying, Steve,” Bruce said a little while later, when both of them had exhausted their questions and were sitting back. “It’ll be nice to have someone smart around here to talk with. I’m glad.” He smiled, before chuckling as he got several offended
But Tony would be free. Tony would go on living his life, happily. He would find someone else, someone more
“Hmm, let’s see…” Steve said, scanning the menu above the barista. He had started ignoring Tony’s little nicknames for him and instead started smiling fondly with a shake of his head.
There was a palpable tension in the air as they made their way to a table and sat down. People were either ambling about, or sitting with laptops, engrossed in their work. It was mid-afternoon and sunny outside, though the atmosphere inside felt suddenly colder. Both of them were silent and avoided looking at each other as they sipped their coffee. Steve couldn’t bear the awkwardness any longer and tried to find something to talk about.
he thought bitterly. But maybe he didn’t want to be someone who became oblivious to the world - to the real world, not this… fantasy that his father had tried to create for him. Maybe he didn’t want to be someone who capitalized off of people’s problems. Maybe he wanted to help people solve those problems -
“We’ve already delayed the payment for as long as we can, Mrs. Barnes,” the nurse said, a little frustrated. “Time is running out. We’ll need you to vacate the bed if this continues.”
About ten minutes into the ride, Steve decided to stop. He had to first make sure that Tony was alright, that the kidnappers would actually let him go before he went and gave himself up. He told the driver to stop at a quiet location and got out. Walking a few steps away, he called up the number that had left the message.
He flipped through every option he had, but all of them landed on one outcome - Tony possibly being injured, or worse, dead. The person on the phone had seemed pretty firm about that. He took a deep breath, and then allowed the one thought which he had kept at bay into his head. He had to give himself up. He had to. There was no other choice.
“Have you been practicing your moves?” Bucky asked Steve suddenly, in a serious voice. “Like I showed you?”
Steve scoffed. “I don’t need to get bigger. I have you!” he smiled at Bucky. “Together, we can defeat
Steve ushered Tony into the building by his hand. He was excited. He had finally convinced Tony to come and work in the company. Steve had loved Tony’s idea of an AI powered bot that could be used in hospitals. He wanted to actually make it a reality, and wanted Tony specifically to spearhead it. They had just expanded their business into tech, and had some of the best minds on board. Tony would fit right in, he knew. Tony had declined at first, but after Steve had dialed up the charm, and after they had gone on a few dates where Steve showed off his best puppy-dog eyes and an All-American smile, Tony had fallen hard.
“Oh.” An awkward silence fell on them, until the guy coughed and introduced himself. “I’m Tony, by the way.” He gave a little wave.
After Steve had calmed down considerably, he wiped his brow and sat up straight. “I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to ruin the mood. It’s just… loud noises scare me, ever since last year, after the car crash…” Steve trailed off. He realized he was still holding onto Tony’s hand and let go quickly.
“Sureee…” Tony laughed, then turned his attention towards the barista. “What’s the situation with the milk today? I hope you’ve brought in a fresh batch,” he said with a serious face. “Don’t want His Highness getting sick with week-old stale milk.”
Steve laughed a little before remembering something. “Did you… uh, I sent you a message…” He trailed off, his voice unsure.
Steve breathed in the smell of Tony’s apartment as he looked around. It smelled like home. It smelled like hours spent laughing over lame jokes, and time spent cooking together. Well, time spent where Steve cooked and Tony buzzed around like a fly until he told him to go to the living room.
Suddenly on impulse, he decided he had to make a quick detour. He looked at his wristwatch to gauge how much time he had left. About forty-five minutes. There was still time. Could he make it? He really wanted to, and without overthinking it, leaned towards the driver.
Steve sat down on a nearby chair and tugged his sweater closer. It was winter, and though they had heating on, as well as a fire merrily crackling away in the fireplace, he always felt a little cold regardless. He didn’t like the cold, it made his mood turn sour. He turned to look at his mother. She was a short woman, her head reaching only his shoulders. She had a grace that couldn’t be imitated, and a face that was quietly beautiful - accentuated now in the glow of the fire. He coughed to get her attention, and she turned to look at him.
“This is not about that!” Steve countered. “God, Tony, I’m not pitying you. I just want to help a friend! What is so wrong with that?”
“Because I’m not an indecisive prick like you,” Tony said after Steve voiced his thoughts. “I already know what I want…” Tony trailed off, frowning down at his wallet, before looking up at the barista. “Um, can you put it on the tab? I’ll pay you later,” Tony said with an uncomfortable tone, becoming painfully aware of Steve looking at him.
“Steve.” He looked at the person who had spoken. Gerard Shaw, one of his father’s most trusted advisors and a board member. “You’ve been preparing for this your whole life. We’ve all interviewed you. You are well equipped for this job. This is what you were meant to do. Don’t just throw it away.”
“That doesn’t matter anymore,” Gerard said, all business-like. He took out a file from a drawer and showed it to Steve. “You’re going to sign over the company to me, Steve. Right now. Look, I've drawn up the papers and everything.”
“Hey, it’s me. You’ll probably get this after… everything. I just wanted to say… I’m so proud of you Tony.” Steve’s voice had turned hoarse and he could barely manage speaking. “I’m so proud of everything you’ve achieved. You’ve done so much, even when you got a shitty deal in life. But look at you now! Two patents and three releases under your belt, and many more to come. I’m so constantly amazed by you, Tony. Your passion for what you love, your ambition for what you want, and your perseverance to achieve it, I’ve learned so much from you. And that is also the reason why I fell for you. Remember that first time when you told me the ideas that you had? You left me awestruck, and I’ve never been the same since. You know, I never told you this, but life had become boring for me. I was going through the motions, not really interested in anything. But then somehow I… found you. And you made me want to live again, Tony. You made me realize the beauty in small things, the value of a laugh, just… how to
Steve was about a couple of minutes away from Tony’s apartment when he got a text. He took his phone out with rising apprehension and carefully opened it. The moment he saw the text, he took a sharp breath. There was a photo attached, of Tony looking like he was about to pass out. He had a bleeding nose and Steve could make out that he had been crying. The caption read
“Of course,” Tony scoffed. “I’m always prepared. What do you take me for?” he said confidently, though his voice betrayed a hint of nerves.
Steve was smiling when he remembered himself and started walking towards the elevator. Just one look around, he convinced himself. Just one stroll, for the last time. He realized belatedly that he was picking at his nails again, and willed himself to stop. Tony would always scold him when he would do that. It was a nervous tic of his, one that he had picked up during his several visits to the hospital as a child. He had been sick numerous times when he was little, and the anxiety of it had not stopped when he had grown up and gotten better. Steve reached Tony’s apartment, and with a deep breath, unlocked the door and went inside.
“I’m not forcing anybody’s hand. The reason we wanted to start this charity in the first place was to help underprivileged people get better medical assistance. That was the goal. I think you might have forgotten that minor fact,” Steve said a little testily. “I won’t change my mind. This is how I want to do it. Now if you’ll excuse me…” he said, before closing the door of his office in their faces.
"It was years ago, don't know why he still gets to me." Tony spoke into his water glass, taking a long gulp and setting it down before rubbing his eyes. "I swear he knows the power he holds over me too."
Kneeling between Tony's legs, he gently pushed them up, something unspoken between them letting him know it was okay that he topped, that Tony wanted it like this.
Hulk knew that. In his own way, Hulk loved Bruce fiercely. Like a parasite, maybe, but it was there. And he picked up on what Bruce was feeling, specifically anger, hence the whole issue to begin with. But Hulk also knew that Tony brought a sense of
"No problem," she smiled, "have a nice day!" And she was gone, wheeling her cart toward the frozen section.
He took his time. Slipping one finger inside and gently working the muscles. Tony tensed at first, sending out a slew of curses that made Steve freeze.
In the produce section, Natasha surveyed the displays before acting. Planning her route around. She nodded, tapped her cart, and set off. Apples, oranges, pears, mangoes, strawberries, and bananas. Fruit: Check. Celery, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, squash, green beans, and cucumbers. Vegetables: Check. Dill, parsley, rosemary, thyme. Herbs: Check. Root vegetables: Potatoes, parsnips, carrots. Check.
He takes a deep breath and looks towards the sky. It's beautiful out, and he feels good. "Let's go home, Happy."
"Jealous of what? Your tea making capabilities? Make a proper cucumber sandwich and then we'll talk." Rhodey quipped, picking up the teapot and pouring them each a cup. He made a show of it, like he was a Japanese geisha and not a military man.
He just needed to assuage Howard, who was likely to be upset. He would do whatever it took to help make Howard happy there.
"Probably. I have to go, babe. I'll talk to you tomorrow." He made to move his arm from Tony's grasp, but the smaller man just clung on tighter. "Tony," he consoled. "It's only one night."
to tell you that!" It made Howard step back, stumbling into the stool behind him by the viciousness of the accusation. "What the hell is wrong with you?!"
Sitting up, he swung his feet over the bed. This story was going to need something better than his fingers or his little vibrator. In the closet, in a small box, Tony had several other toys, including a nice sized dildo, red of course, and exactly the size he assumed Steve to be. He stumbled back to the bed, jumping onto it and flopping onto his back like a teenager about to see his first porn, that is, with a little too much excitement.
Steve threw his head back and laughed loudly, Tony really liked how his eyes crinkled in mirth. He pushed Tony forwards, "Come on, idiot. I'll let you enter first, so you can pretend you won."
He sat, pulling a stuffed bear from behind him and setting it on the back of the couch. "I'm beginning to think this isn't a good idea, Tash."
A dash of creamer for himself, and black for Tony. He gently placed them on the nightstand and turned to check the food Bruce had given him for Tony. It was a little soggy but still edible, and Rhodey balanced the tray on his hip before kneeling on the bed and setting it down. He tapped Tony's nose, loathe to wake him after he had sobbed for nearly an hour, but he knew that Bruce was right. Tony needed to eat. And then he needed to get the hell out of bed.
"There's a gay joke in there, isn't there?" Tony snorted, wrapping his arm around Steve's, trying to anchor him to the couch where they were sitting.
Yet… It didn't seem right to shove Tony into that category. He was a good man. Hell, he was a genius superhero who was willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Howard had the internet now. He saw the video. Tony left him in the dust. Even if
"I'll do it." Three sets of eyes swivel to stare at Tony. He swallows and repeats himself. "I'll do it. Don't worry about the funding. I'll pay. And I can probably improve on whatever radar you have so we don't dive unnecessarily. It'll take a weekend. Maybe three days." He musters up a grin. "It'll be fun."
until he faces what happened to him as a child! Hell, none if you can! God forbid, Clint, you talk about your parent's deaths, or your brother!"
Steve's head ducked down to meet Tony's, his hands sliding up to cup his face, and they were kissing. Even when the laptop slid off Tony's lap and clattered to the ground as he moved to face Steve more fully, they didn't stop. When the cheers erupted from the dark inside the tower, they kept on. It was dizzying. It was perfect.
"That's not all." A flash of panic streaked across his face, Tony's throat making a choked sound as he fought down his emotions. As Howard watched, Tony's fingers gripped the counter on the kitchen island, knuckles turning white. He staggered and leaned his weight against the counter, turning into it and flattening both palms along the smooth surface. His head dropped, and a hitch of breath cut through the silence. He was waiting for Howard to acknowledge what he said.
"Yeah?" Tony gasped as Steve sucked a line down his neck, his hand fumbled for a moment, reaching up to touch Steve's face and instead knocking his glasses askew. They fell to the tip of his nose and he hastily pushed them back up, not wanting to miss what Steve was doing, "Prove it."
"In the morning, he made me an honorary member of his family. Said he's never seen a white man drink so much and not vomit!" He spoke with his hands, something that Tony did as well, but the combination of his exuberance in the storytelling and his drunken state set him off balance, and he tipped over the back of the sofa and out of sight.
"Like that woman in the video said, it doesn't matter who you are, no one gets a free pass to grab at you like you're nothing but a package of meat."
Steve felt his heart drop. "Okay, angel. Can you take a few swallows of the smoothie at least? Put something in your stomach?"
Tony gave a short laugh. "Thanks, J." Tilting his head up so he could see Steve, Tony asked, "Hungry?"
Moving to the other, Steve asked, "You like that?" Before taking it into his mouth and pressing his tongue against it.
He holds the head up with both hands underneath and the heavy weight situated between his knees. Their snowman is going to be massive. He loves it.
"Cross my metallic heart, Miss Potts." Even though she couldn't see him, he drew an imaginary X over the arc reactor.
"It's good to finally meet you, Tony." Behind him, Tony's new textbooks sit piled on the coffee table. He itches to read them.
"This part is going to hurt," Michael laments, his face pinched at the very idea of causing Tony more pain.
"The hell it doesn't count! You've seen what he did to him! You were there to witness it first hand!"
"Can it?" Steve asked, looking up at him. "Because you didn't see him. You didn't see-" he trailed off, unsure of how to verbalize what he was thinking. Shifting his body so he could look at Bruce, he tried again. "Do you remember the first few months after the Chitauri invasion? How Tony would have constant flashbacks and panic attacks? How when it got really bad on some days, he would disappear into his suite and just… sleep?" Bruce nodded. "This was worse. He barely left the bed, refused to eat, he was just so… hollow."
couldn't hurt him anymore than you could hurt yourself. You're brass, and impulsive, and you definitely leap before you look." Howard chuckled at that. "But that's why I liked you in the first place. You're brilliant. Not as smart as Tony, sorry-"
legs wrapped around his waist, he pushed in, mindful of the gasps below him. He kept it slow, giving Tony a chance to adjust to him inch by inch.
. His voice clear and crisp on their records, lifting the harmonies like a swift breeze in the middle of a hot summer day. He had no record to speak of, just a string of bad relationships and a temper that took a lot to goad but was rumored to be fierce. Divorced with one child, a son named Nikola, he had an amicable relationship with his ex-wife. He also had a penchant for misanthropic escapes and fast food. He'd have to tell her the secret to how he stayed thin.
Steve cut him off with a kiss, pulling Tony's neck down to slot their lips together. "Shut up," he chuckled, flipping them over so he was on top and nestled between Tony's legs. Tony's answering laugh was interrupted with a moan as Steve grinded down on him. "Nat needs me in the living room."
Sometimes, it felt like someone had taken a shard of glass and was cutting him open from the inside out, other times he would vomit up everything he’d just consumed. Some days, there was nothing. Literally. He would sit in the bathroom, cramping and cursing everything in existence while other days it would come on too fast and too painful. He could never predict what would happen. It was safer to just stay at home.
The sight was enough. Just seeing how far he had stretched Tony's pretty hole, watching as he pulled in and out, the way Tony's rim fluttered when Steve was almost all of the way out, it was beautiful in ways he couldn't describe. It only took a few more thrusts before his body was seizing with pleasure and he was coming, legs jerking out straight as the intensity of the orgasm barreled through him, ropes of come shooting out and coating Tony's insides. He kept pumping, watching with thinly veiled fascination as his movements started to bring the come out, his cock covered in what he had just filled Tony with.
The kettle started to whistle as Steve was finishing wiping the table down. He was trying to give Tony and Rhodey some space, knowing how important it was for the two of them to reconnect without him there.
Tossing them back into the drawer, Steve got up on his knees. "But for now," he gently pushed Tony onto his back and pulled his knees apart. Tony's hips moved, ever so slightly, at the want of friction. "You're okay with this?"
saying, you have nothing to worry about." Howard saw a slight tuft of brown hair in between the blankets and Steve's body as she slinked to the edge of the bed and slid to the floor. A tuft of hair and, whoa. That was a perfect ass.
Tony is knee-deep in schematics to rebuild the suit that got him out of the cave. He looks up at Coulson guiltily. "Ah," sliding the toolbox in front of him over, he attempts to block Coulson's view of what's obviously a blueprint for the armor, "you know I already have a job, right?"
Nodding, Tony moved to the edge of the bed. He felt stale and stiff, and weariness had crept into his bones and settled in, making itself at home. When he stood, his lower back ached, and the scars around the arc reactor stretched uncomfortably. Shuffling to the bathroom, he clicked on the light and winced as the brightness assaulted his eyes.
Tony's hips began to undulate slowly, rocking down into Steve's fingers, his body tense with want. "And I fuck myself. Sometimes hard and fast, sometimes slow. I aim for my prostate, humping against it. Drives me insane." His words were short and clipped, punctuated with every roll of his hips as he demonstrated, fucking himself on Steve's fingers.
The room froze, no one even releasing a breath. Steve's hand went to his mouth, covering it in his shock, his other arm pulling Tony in closer.
There was so much to discuss, so much to talk about and work through, but it would all fall easily where it was supposed to now they were together again.
"You've done a lot of asinine things, but this? How? How did you get here? What are you playing with, Howard?" Steve snapped, and Howard didn't like how angry Steve was making him feel. He had searched for too long, had loved the man like he was family. He didn't like being fearful. This was how the Nazis must have felt coming up against him. This was Captain America, not Steve Rogers.
"A one stop shop, sir, that's what I try to be." Natasha was pleased. Miranda, however, was a nightmare: a budding pop starlet with a proclivity for partying and drugs, she had a loose wallet and even looser morals. Natasha had spent the better part of the previous eight months chasing her down and ordering a semblance of control within the singer to
"Stupid super soldiers and their stupid strength, stupid stupor soldiers and their stupor stupor strength, stupor st, stupid...I suck at this."
And the stares from the other patrons didn't help. They glanced from the magazine's to Tony's face and to Steve's, their looks pitying or disgusted.
"Thanks," Steve spoke softly, reaching out to take the pin, but he changed direction, noticing a laminated sheet of paper that was also in the box, and picked that up instead. "It's a letter," he said, reading quietly, "it's from your father!"
With a single nod, he turned and raced down the hallway toward his apartment, to his uniform and shield. Ready to face whatever it was, ready for a distraction.
That night, while getting ready for bed, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist and pressed his face into his shoulder. "I love you," he whispered, "but I need you to let me make the call on this."
"Thor isn't the only god around here." Clint joked, walking—no, sliding—back to the work station. "Tony Stark! God of technology!"
"Tony." Steve said quietly. "You-" he sighed and tried again. "I felt like I missed so much. Lost so much. But you, you somehow gave it all back to me."
someone else on the payroll, but a half-hour into the meeting and Fury looks thrilled. As much as a guy with one eye and resting bitch face could look thrilled, anyway. They're talking over a potential contact when a woman enters. She's petite, brunette, and right away, Tony knows she's tough.
"Is it? Tony, you need to let go of Howard. The one you grew up with anyway. Let him go. He's dead. He can't hurt you anymore."
Spinning on his heel, Steve stomped to his bed, sighed, and fell face down into it. His voice was muffled when he spoke. "What did I ever do to deserve this?"
"You okay?" Tony sent him a loaded glance. "Right. Stupid question." With a sigh, Bruce let his head fall back again. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm bored."
"For the past week or so, just some soup, fruits, vegetables. Cereal. Yogurt. It was all I could keep down."
"Evening, Barton," she smirked, not looking away from the man seated next to her. Howard's eyes narrowed, and her grin deepened. He was off put by her knowing who entered without looking. Good.
"What we both need is sleep." But Steve stands anyway, curiosity gently peeking out behind his sad blue eyes. He swipes at his tears, chuckling despairingly, and huffs out a sigh. "What do you have in mind?"
Steve suddenly thought to himself. He went to the bedroom, uselessly hoping that he would find Tony there, sleeping soundly, unharmed and oblivious, that all of it had been just a horrible nightmare. No one was there though. Tony’s bed was empty, all perfectly made as it was every morning after Tony got up. Steve suddenly wished it wasn’t so. He wanted to see it wrinkled up, as if Tony had just gotten up and gone to the bathroom, and he would come out any minute. But the lights switched off in the bathroom told a different story.
“I can pay for you if you want. Look, it's no big deal,” Steve said, already pulling out his platinum credit card. “Let me help you-”
he would have said. It was his father who had dragged him along to prepare his will the minute he had agreed to take over the company.
“Already on it.” Tony grinned and pulled out two cappuccinos. “I went to our place before coming here when they told me you were awake.” He carefully handed the cup to Steve before adding in a serious tone, “Don’t tell the nurse.”
Steve started making a mental checklist of things he had to do. He had to leave instructions for the board of directors at his company. They would have to choose a new president. He had to inform his vice-president about the status of the top-level projects his company was handling. He had to give explicit directions on how he wanted the funds allocated to those projects. There was no time to be scared now. He wiped his face, shuddered a little, took a deep breath and sat down at the table. But first things first, he needed to update his will. A fortune as big as his, it was of utmost importance. He opened the locked drawer where he kept important documents and took out a file. As he was about to close it, his eyes fell on a bunch of receipts, and a smile automatically graced his face. Tens of receipts were bunched together, from a coffee shop, from the time spent with Tony. Alongside them, an old, worn-out coffee stirrer with a note attached -
Steve nodded, pushing the bills into his pockets. It was thousands of dollars, more than enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life if he wanted.
"Bye, Creep!" In one fluid movement, he had pushed Tony behind him, taking over the space the smaller man had occupied, and bodily lifted the jerk off his feet and threw him out the door. He landed on the platform with a thud and a grunt. Steve leaned out, his hands resting on the subway car's sliding doors, "It's called consent, dick-bag. You may want to look that up in the dictionary. Also, if you hadn't noticed, he," Steve pointed angrily behind him at Tony who stood shock still, "is way too good for you. Stay in your lane, asshole." And the doors closed.
"So, you got a stomach bug?" But a stomach bug wouldn't explain the weight loss. Pepper probably knew Tony better than even Steve did. He'd talk when he was ready, so she allowed him his excuse. "Okay, you can miss this meeting, but I need you at the next one, Tony." She darted her eyes towards Steve, a silent promise that she wouldn't make Tony do anything if he was still this sick. It was always better to give Tony a goal.
The ding of the bell over his head was only partially covered by the rustling of the plastic holdings for the bouquets. He stepped inside the dim light of the store and picked up a basket. Eggs, bacon… he was pretty sure he was out of vanilla extract and he needed that for the pancakes. Turning a corner at the end of an aisle, he blindly grabbed a box of tea from an endcap, even he enjoyed a little surprise once in a while. As he turned into the refrigerated section, his sight landed on a boy of about six or seven, staring at him with wide eyes.
that cemented it. Steve had made quite a few missteps in the last several days, but one thing he understood was that when Tony said
He loved movies, especially those from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and they bonded over Cary Grant and Gene Kelly, Veronica Lake and Lauren Bacall. Spoke of their crushes on both and giggled at the old horror movies, throwing popcorn at the screen and yelling at the characters.
Steve put his hand gently on Tony's thigh, letting his fingertips graze the inside right above the inseam. "Do you want to keep going?"
"Oh, sorry," she said, showing him her phone, "you weren't ready." In it, the boy was looking at him, wonder splashed across his face, and Bruce was laughing.
"Uh. I can change." Tony muttered, catching sight of how well dressed Steve was in comparison to his own frat boy get-up.
