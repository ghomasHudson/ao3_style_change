A cleared throat, and John was keenly aware of the smug smile on his father's face. "Don't think I didn't realize your terrible attempt at deflection earlier, my boy. Come on, you wouldn't deprive your mother the chance to know if her little boy has fallen for someone." And if that wasn't throwing John to the wolves, he didn't know what was.
John tried, he really did. He'd been going for indignant, but his words slipped out tainted with curiosity and trepidation. Was it really wise to be encouraging him?
“Do you still feel it, sometimes?” Sherlock wondered aloud. Seven years was enough time to heal, but he was no stranger to the concept of phantom pain or nerve damage.
His mother harrumphed and rapped him on the back of the head as she got up to clear the tea. "Ungrateful brat," she huffed. "This is all from your side of the family, Rupert." Her words were spoken with sharp, clipped elocution, but John could see the corners of her lips tilt up slightly, hiding her smile.
Sherlock looked like a peacock, pecking at his ruffled feathers. John pressed his lips so as not to laugh at his agitated lover. He was such a drama queen. “What,” Sherlock snapped when he caught John staring.
“Sherlock, I—if I'd had a choice, I would have chosen you, you know that—”
An hour into their journey, John realized that Sherlock wasn't referencing a map. “Do you have these woods memorized?” John asked, stepping over a large, protruding root.
Sherlock held out a hand to him, and John could do nothing but stare at it, something in the offer felt contractual. If he took that hand, John knew he would be making a deal with the devil. Was that what he wanted? A man like Sherlock could bring bliss or terror, so could John risk the latter for a taste of the former?
The word would follow him home to Lewisham, and from there to the train station.
“Oh, shut it, Sherlock, we weren't even shagging, then!”
He turned to Jasper, seeing the boy reach under the table again for the pack of fags he kept hidden there. "Have you got any tea?" John would kill for a cuppa, about now.
It was more like a demand than a request, but curiously, John wasn't bothered by it. He wanted to see Sherlock, too.
Holmes licked across John’s chin, no doubt tasting the piquancy of Molly’s juices, as John could on him. Then, that clever tongue was licking past his lips, sloppy and wet. John didn’t even care that the bottom half of their faces was covered with pussy juice. He was inflamed with want and having Holmes so obviously interested and dominating was making his chest pang with longing.
John sat up slowly, willing the wary ache in his bones to settle and the pain in his shoulder to dull to a lesser degree. Somewhere in the hall, he could hear the low murmurs of a conversation. John recognized one as Lestrade, unable to mistake that gruff voice, the result of having been a smoker most of his life, John assumed.
It wasn't Sherlock, but Jasper, lips thin and looking as if he'd just... had his heart broken.
He'd barely placed his phone down before John heard the notification sound. Someone was a little overzealous.
Usually, once Sherlock reached the bottom of an issue, it wasn't hard to proceed from there. Any other client, and Sherlock would be halfway through the session and quickly reaching a conclusion.
Belly on fire, he meandered to the bed, and sat beside John, much the way he had earlier in the bedsit.
Which did he want more: John or the cocaine?
John's eyes drifted beyond Sherlock's shoulder, remembering his delicate-boned friend, and Peter's bright laughter with fondness. Peter's father had been from Spain and a devout Catholic. He didn't believe that his son truly felt wrong in his own body. He’d put it down as mental illness and carted Peter away.
John could see it as if it were happening. Sherlock with his mouth on John's cock, staring at him from beneath his fringe as his mouth bobbed up then down at a maddeningly slow pace. John, unable to say a thing, completely trusting Sherlock to stop when things went too far.
John snorted at that, sure that whoever said that was probably attempting to get on Sherlock's good side. He couldn't imagine the difficult, acerbic Alpha being anything but temperamental and pouty. John chuckled, looking back up to see Sherlock staring back at him, perplexed.
“I want to see,” John whispered, and Sherlock paused, leaning his head against the screen. When he stood with one hand to support himself on the screen, John could see that the cassock had been parted and his trousers, unbuttoned. One large hand stroked leisurely at his hardened member.
his area.
He made quick work of dressing and used the new toothbrush Lestrade had handed him atop the pile of clothes. John put the shaving kit to use, cutting away days worth of beard growth on his face. He appraised himself for the first time since he began fleeing from the hunters, feeling something close to human again, well, sort of. The skin around his eyes was baggy with exhaustion, face edged with shadows of anger, sadness, bitterness, and desolation. John didn't really want to be here. He was thankful for Lestrade's kindness, but he had no place here, or any other pack for that matter. John couldn't protect his own kin, so what good would he do for this new lot?
The fingers dancing at the hem of John’s knickers pushed forward and into the gap, dipping to trace a cautious line up the split of his arse. Sherlock had pulled back to watch him, his eyes so hungry and demanding  as they burned right into his own. He refused to relent even when John’s eyes drifted shut as a hand cupped his swollen balls. John moaned, wishing that Sherlock would be there with him forever, whispering utterly filthy things into his ear with his fine, euphonious baritone.
The tunnel had been there for centuries; the cobblestone walkway and the gritty walls proved it, but there was a secret history to it all. Politicians and aristocrats, celebrities and “upstanding figures” had walked this path, all in the pursuit of the same objective: to shed their skin. Sherlock observed everything, and he knew well enough that a public persona was naught but an extra layer to keep others from seeing what was really underneath. It was Irene who had introduced Sherlock to this hidden depth of London. She'd taken him in and stripped his clothes, made him naked, and stood him in front of a mirror to show him what he looked like without the pretense. Pale, long, lean, anomalous, dangerous... hungry.
"What would you have me say, then," John asked, the warmth from Sherlock's hands radiating through the skin of his cheeks, warming him.
John's hand followed this curvature of Sherlock's spine, the notches of his vertebrae and the expanse of smooth, pale flesh surrounding it. Sherlock was as close to perfection as John had ever come and it seemed impossible that the man would ever want anything to do with the likes of John. He'd long settled to the idea of living an ordinary life with an ordinary woman, because ordinary people attracted ordinary things. This time, John in all his ordinariness attracted someone extraordinary and he didn't think he would ever be able to revert back to the mundane. Even the sex was unconventional, and John wasn't going to be complaining about that.
Sherlock sat up, his stomach dropping and lifting in a twist of dread and hope that made his head spin. "What happened, Molly? Is John... is he...?"
The living room was a quick fix; just a matter of cleaning up behind Sherlock and scooping up his clothes to the throw in the laundry basket. The older man had disappeared into the shower a short while after John finished and later emerged from his room in one of his usual custom tailored suits.
"The way our kind are being hunted now, I don't reckon why we couldn't just join up and go after those bastards, but it's been every pack for themselves."
Lestrade smiled reassuringly, patting John lightly on the shoulder with a nod. "Of course," he said, "there's a bathroom right up those stairs to the left. I'll loan you some of my clothes. We have a similar build, but they may be a bit long on you."
Sherlock growled and thrust his cock into John’s grip. “God, how is it possible you’re tighter than you were this afternoon?”
Behind him, Sarah giggled and crossed her arms under her chest. "Well if this doesn't get him randy, I don't know what will?"
John sighed and rolled his eyes, but bumped her fondly with his shoulder. “Should I expect you to be keeping an eye on things?”
Sherlock merely rolled his eyes and slumped into his chair. Whatever Lestrade came to talk about, Sherlock’s window for receptiveness was closing quickly, given what the fool inspector had interrupted.
The host at the door offered to take his coat, but John smiled and declined politely, intent on keeping it on. There was no harm in an extra layer between him and his date.
“Of course, Sherlock,” John whispered. “Yes, Sherlock, I—yes. Please.”
John shrugged his shoulders stiffly as he regarded the older man. "Bit out my comfort zone..." Now that he had showered and dressed, John could feel his nerves alighting in anticipation of meeting the pack. He couldn't lie and say that he wasn't nervous of their reactions. It had been years since he had to make a good impression on anyone. John could be himself around his former pack mates, and Bill wasn't one to care about appearances where their pack etiquette was concerned. "Ta for the clothes."
Siblings, then, Sherlock concluded. The pair were of similar stature of the short and stocky variety, with identical blond hair and a deep enough blue that they appeared like murky water at a distance. So, twins, both Alpha.
Sherlock stepped into the room and shrugged his coat off with a calmness that belied his demeanour. "Obviously," he snapped, hanging the coat on the coat rack a bit rougher than necessary.
Sherlock had never lied to Jasper, but the urge to do so was strong, if at least to spare him the hurt that knowing that particular bit of information would cause. Instead he answered truthfully. “Yes,” he said, before pressing his lips together.
I don't imagine you met him at a social function.”
Rupert needed to know. He’d been as hurt as she when they got the letter in the post. She had to say something, to explain, but Julia couldn’t get her mouth to work.
Sherlock snorted. “You’re not very good at concealing your thoughts or your body language, John,” he scolded, and John couldn’t help the goose pimples that rose on his skin at hearing his name instead of Lady Grey’s. Of course, Sherlock noticed his reaction.
“I gathered,” the man replied, holding out a steaming cup to John. “I thought you might like something other than roses.”
His orgasm hit harder than he’d expected it to, pulling words out of his mouth even he couldn’t understand. Sherlock was babbling, drowning in John’s hold for several long minutes until the intensity finally began to ebb. When he came to, John was holding him, and they’d sunken to the bottom of the bath.
Gillian blanched at the underlying threat, backing up a step in order to regain his composure, and, of course, the tatters of his dignity. Finally, he bared his teeth in a snarl, shoving past Holmes and away from John. "Yeah fuck you, nancy-boy," he spat, turning his bloodshot glare on John again. "I'll be seein' you soon, blondie."
“You're different,” he said quietly, holding John's eyes for several long seconds, until John finally gave in and looked away. The conversation was edging dangerously close to forbidden territory, but John couldn't stop himself from asking what he really wanted to know.
He folded his legs and smiled placidly. “Good. Now that I have your attention, we can get to the juicy bits, now, hm?”
John couldn’t stop grinning, watching his friends as they all danced around without a care. As they’d always done, his peers had shown their support the first time John did a number without Lady Grey’s persona. At first, he was nervous, but as the music played, everything else faded and John left himself at the mercy of his feet.
A nod.
“P-please. My pocket,” the man stuttered, too frightened to do much more than gesture vaguely towards the bottom half of his body, shadowed beneath Sherlock's considerable bulk.
He tormented John so beautifully, ramming his prostate until John was on the brink of an orgasm, only to fall short of the mark for the next five thrusts.
Sherlock snorted, and John knew things were about to take an ugly turn. The fact that it was going to happen right outside his door was a bonus. It would be nice to hear Victor taken down a notch. John had never been a vindictive person, but Victor wasn't a particularly nice man, either.
John wanted to know why. What was so special about him that this stranger would offer him something he hadn't had in years? The comfort of a home and companionship, which begged the question: what was in it for Holmes?
pick me up at pub or any of that…?”
With that, the man nodded his head once. “Good day.” Then he was suavely sliding out the front door.
John frowned down at his jumper in confusion, wondering what Sarah was about to nag at him about. Grey contrasted nicely with his eyes, or so an ex-lover had informed him after they'd had a bit of fun on sheets the same shade as said color. "What? What's wrong with it?"
Just past four, John was finally drifting towards sleep when a noise caught his attention. The lights were off and the room was pitched in darkness when he heard a door open with a soft creak from the hinges. Light feet padded over the floor along with the light swish of fabric.
Sarah would have a field day if she knew just how much John had already succumbed to Sherlock's advances in the little time they'd known one another.
"Coward," Sherlock yelled at his retreating back. "Coward!
John froze, abruptly sensitive to the change in the atmosphere as Jim's grin grew tight.
Within hours, he'd made his decision.
John let the sentence taper off, heavy in meaning and open to interpretation. Sherlock could go into details and logistics, but if the appraising eye he was observing John with was anything to go by, Sherlock had more than that in mind.
His pristine suit screamed wealth, from the handsewn hem of his trousers to the cotton collar of his pressed shirt.
John froze, a bit surprised that Sherlock would offer. Though they’d had sex twice now, they still hardly knew one another. It was tempting to say yes, but John was stopped by the thought that if things didn’t work out between them, it would be awkward. Yet, he couldn’t quite bring himself to decline.
“John? John Watson?”
Now it was getting a bit too sappy for Greg, but he was happy for them. Greg knew it was time to go when Sherlock grew handsy, slipping one hand down to palm John’s arse. With the other, he flicked it in a shooing motion towards Greg.
in John's wardrobe was considered fancy past the late nineties.
John stopped a few feet away from the counter, conscious of his ripe body odor and haggard appearance. He didn't want to involve her, but John could really use a proper wash. "Miss Morstan," he nodded politely, giving her a tentative smile. He could see her lips teetering on the edge of a grim line as she surveyed his new injuries, but she wisely chose to say nothing at all, which John appreciated immensely. This wasn't the first time he'd come to her in such a condition. Sometimes, the woman let him hide there if he knew Alfie was looking for him. Miss Morstan never asked questions, and John knew without her saying anything at all, that he had a safe haven if he ever needed one.
And just like the addict that he was, Sherlock had several hidden spaces in his flat that he kept his stashes of cocaine. The little baggy felt heavier than it should in his hand.
She stood and crossed the short space to kneel by her son’s seat. She settled a hand on his cheek and angled his face toward her. “Why didn’t you tell us? There’s no way we could have known if you—”
The man was silent for a moment, long enough for Julia to snap, “Tell me!”
John wondered what the house of Sherlock Holmes would look like?
Sherlock hooked his hands around John's thighs with a tight, immovable grip, pulling him further to the edge of the bed and into his awaiting mouth, hungrily. John leaned back on his elbows to support his top half, reveling in the avidity in which that warm, all-consuming orifice was devouring his erection.
"How much have you taken, mum?" John was truly scared for his mother. Her life revolved around the drugs and the pain and the memories. For as long as he could remember, she just waddled in her own misery.
room?" He wasn't even asking anymore, but rather, giving voice to his chaotic thoughts. All of it was a lot to take in. "And you want my consent, first?"
John ached to reach out and pull the man close, but somehow he knew that Sherlock needed this moment. Maybe he was filing it away somewhere for wank material, later. It was all the same to John; he just wanted that solid body laying over him.
Blond hair, lighter than John's, but Sherlock remembered a picture of teenage John, with white-blond hair that gradually began to darken over time. Though it wasn't the hair that convinced him.
Now that they saw it for what it was, John was aware that there was more at play than what was immediately obvious.
been a lifetime since he’d had John in his arms in this way; John's thighs bracketing his hips and the sweat of minutes, hours of their bodies sharing heat, pasted together by sheer will and intent.
Sherlock dropped the scarf and slid the coat off his shoulders, letting it fall into a heap at his feet. The jacket followed, and Sherlock began on the buttons of his shirt.
What in the hell was he doing?
“Sherlock,” John called hesitantly. It sounded like he was standing at the mouth of the hallway.
Sherlock was circling him, checking the cuffs on his wrist, the strength of the chain, and finally, John himself, sharp almond eyes glowing with pleasure. John could already feel the heat of those hands roaming over this body, the curve of his arse, until the simmering warmth in his upper body wasn't the only thing burning for Sherlock.
At Sherlock's raised brow, John paced a slow, disconcerting half circle around the room as he began to speak. "Fortunately for me, I did my research before I came." Sherlock found the draw of his eyes to John's broad upper back, irresistible, the bunch of his muscles as he walked with his hands folded behind him. "Sherlock Holmes, the 'Great Alpha Tamer'."
“Well,” he sighed, not really wanting to leave, but the temptation of soft skin and slanted, sleepy eyes was nearly irresistible. He had to be careful. “Goodnight then.”
Sebastian stepped forward, pulling a large yellow envelope from beneath his jacket, and handed it to Jim. Jim received the envelope without sparing a glance for Sebastian, though he smiled down at it briefly as he unclasped the metal fasteners. “Sebastian really is the worst kind of enabler,” Jim chuckled lightly, a hint of his fondness for the man seeping through, so long as the man didn't annoy him too much. “He encourages my taste for the dramatic.” Jim didn't have to look to know that not a muscle in Sebastian’s face ticked.
John nodded, exhausted and sore, for some odd reason. “M’fine,” he slurred, still trying to bring his breathing under control. “That was… I honestly don't have any words for it.”
Someone moaned, John couldn’t figure out who. He hadn’t felt his throat vibrate, hadn’t felt Sherlock’s breath on his arm.
At last, he could see that Sherlock's door had been shut sometime while he was sleeping, and John had no doubt that's where the noise had come from.
me of anything, Victor. John Watson is my concern and none of yours. See that it stays that way."
“Sometimes, Sherlock,” Mycroft began quietly, something in his tone, softer, as he stared at his brother, and John suddenly had the feeling that he was intruding on something sacred, “it's important to blend. Not all humans are like the ones you've met. They are not all set on eradicating us.”
John wrapped an arm around the taller man's neck, the other holding on to Sherlock's bicep. "I think I have a bit of an idea," John gasped into his lover's mouth. His fingers ran through those soft dark curls, pulling the detective's lips down to his own, into something more gentle and intimate.
John Watson was not only a mystery, but a challenge. Sherlock never could pass one up.
The atmosphere grew tense and John pulled at his collar, trapped under Holmes' penetrating gaze and overheated.
Sherlock sat up, too, his halo of curls wild and dark against a landscape of pale skin. He leaned forward into John's space, pushing forward until John was pressed back against the headboard, and kissed him roughly. When Sherlock pulled away, his jaw was set. “Regret has no place in our bed,” he said.
John immediately felt winded, unable to pull in enough air at the thought. No, he couldn't.
“Sherlock, you can’t just barge in here whenever you feel like it,” John murmured half-heartedly. When their eyes met, John’s were resigned, the expression exaggerated by the slump of his shoulders, the indrawn curve of his thoracic spine. “Not anymore, Sherlock. It’s dangerous.”
Sherlock had been finally drifting to sleep, but the urge to turn over was strong, and so he did.
He stood on the pavement, resisting the urge to scratch his head, confounded by the situation he found himself in. Mike always found a way of convincing John to do things he would never do otherwise. The year before, Mike was due to record a lecture given by the world's leading neuroscientist, and he'd begged off at the last minute citing familial obligations. Mike begged him to go, and although John was currently in medical school, these lectures did a better job of lulling him to sleep than enlightening him.
It wasn’t often that John left the club as Lady Grey, but when he did, some part of him still cringed away from the possibility that he could be recognised, or that someone would notice and say something. He’d been privy to a few hurled insults in passing, and a scathing look or two, but never anything outright violent. John was still a fighter, and with the way Sherlock stood close to him as they walked, he knew that no one would be brazen enough to say a word.
Sherlock began slow, just barely moving his hips, giving John time to adjust to being inside of him. John was already so close, teetering on the edge of bliss, nearly ready to fall over that cliff, but Sherlock held off for the longest time. “If you come now, you lose,” Sherlock breathed.
“Don't fall asleep,” Sherlock said. “You've two more chances to make me come.”
Thinking back, he regretted his outburst in the back of the car, but Jim Moriarty hadn't been a predicted variable, and so John had been uncomfortable in the aftermath of their introduction. He wanted to know Jim's history with Sherlock, and why Sherlock responded the way he’d done. Something about the situation was off.
Sherlock greeted her warmly. "Hello Ella," he said, leaning in as she did, to place a light kiss on her cheek.
“Ohh, is that all you've got? Come on now, don't play with me!”
John's eyebrows lifted nearly to his hairline at the revelation, and Sherlock smirked back, suitably smug. “Three years ago, Angelo was implicated in a particularly vicious murder. I proved to Lestrade that he was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.”
much harder,” Sherlock whispered ardently. “And I would feel it all.”
Sherlock wanted to be done with the entire affair as quickly as possible, even if that meant getting John drunk and using him as an excuse to leave sooner than was polite. He’d made up his mind to leave directly after the charity auction, but suffice to say, they didn't quite make it that long.
. How many times had Sherlock told John the very same thing?
There was still so much to learn about Sherlock, but for now, John let himself be dragged to the shower, giggling as Sherlock stumbled mildly over his own two feet.
Jim shrugged, effecting an innocent facade as he stuffed his hands in his pockets and backed away. Sherlock's eyes were pale slits, more furious than John had ever seen him.
The store itself was lovely and festive; garland was strung from corner to corner and cheery, multicolored lights weaved in and out, blinking brightly. A Christmas tree stood proudly in the center of the store, the base sprinkled with fluffy, white cotton and perfectly wrapped boxes. Soft holiday music played from the radio behind the counter, a chorus that John vaguely recalled from his childhood. The woman staring expectantly back at him was dressed as Mrs Clause, complete with a  Santa hat and half-moon spectacles.
Sherlock brought him closer to the summit, balancing John on a knife's edge until he was sure Sherlock would allow him to tip over, only to cruelly bring him back.
"I- what?"
John. If John were truly interested in her, Sherlock snarled at the thought that
So John held his stare and stepped up until their chests touched. Sherlock's heavy gaze cut through the sheets of rain, droplets shimmering like pearls on the tips of his lashes as he blinked once. Then John walked past him and into the foliage, assured that Sherlock was one step behind him.
From above, Sherlock was staring intently, the muscles his thighs, bunched and tight. Those long, violinist fingers were curled where they sat on the arms of the chair, nails pressing dents into the leather.
The sound of a door opening drew his attention to the hallway. Mr. Holmes exited the room in a plain white top and pyjama bottoms, a blue silk robe thrown over the whole lot. The man paused upon seeing him at the window, approaching a bit more cautiously to come and stand next to John at the window. John wondered how Mr. Holmes saw the world. Where John only saw stragglers, would the man know where exactly these strangers were heading, what they were hoping to get up to in the cover of night, or if they were running from things that they hoped no one else could see.
John smiled. “Well you seem quite fond of it.”
One week has passed since then, and John found himself looking into options for starting a military career. With no sign of Jasper, and Sherlock's continual mood swings and self-imposed distancing, John knew he didn't have much of a place at the Holmes residence any longer.
Sherlock snickered, though the smile faded when he noticed Victor’s pitying stare in his peripheral.
Jasper nodded and Sherlock retreated to the kitchen to start the kettle. While he waited, Jasper settled in the seat across from his father’s favored chair and checked his phone. Once he’d finally turned it on a few days before, he received all of the text messages John sent him, each one more alarmed as time went by without a response. Eventually they stopped, and now Jasper couldn't stop thumbing through them. In the tube, he read back on months and months of text, just banter and a bit of flirting. Now, there was nothing but the static silence, and the occasional text he’d receive from his dad during his stay at Mycroft’s.
Sherlock could hear them bickering before they'd even stepped through the door, the woman's voice pitched high and stentorian. "Oh, shut it, you! We wouldn't be here if you could control yourself," the woman huffed, banging through the door without so much as a by-your-leave. "If you're going to be so maudlin about it, I should just let you suffer on your own."
It didn't matter at this point though. John was already drifting into the welcoming arms of oblivion.
Mike was sitting at the kitchen table (the only place to fit a table in their tiny flat, really), hunched over an intimidating pile of papers. His eyes were underlined with heavy pouches, red and slightly manic.
For months he’d corresponded with Sherlock until the letters abruptly stopped. Shortly after, he received a short, clipped call from Mycroft Holmes that he was to sever all correspondence with his brother, and that Sherlock would no longer be responding.
Lestrade scoffed. "
“Good, now that the pleasantries are out of the way, we will talk about this like the sensible adults that we are, are we clear on that matter?” Mycroft did so hate to be the only rational adult in the room, but these things couldn't be helped. “Excellent,” he stated when they both conceded reluctantly. “Now Jasper, talk to your father.”
"Not necessarily," Sherlock intoned, now sounding bored with the conversation entirely. "Enough about Mycroft. He intrudes on my life enough as it is. Understand that you are not being followed, Mycroft is merely keeping tabs."
The lab was blessedly quiet and Sherlock slid his coat off with a sigh as he crossed the room. He hadn’t had the time to stop in, recently, not since John’s return and the parade of meetings Mycroft had taken to requesting his presence in.
Sherlock neatly folded the letter and placed it on the table, smoothing out the creases with the flat of his hand before turning to Jasper. In sleep, Jasper was de-aged, until he was once again the adolescent that Sherlock would tuck in every night, only to find him crawling into his bed in the early hours. Sherlock didn't miss those day often, and honestly rarely thought of them. He hadn't thought himself the ideal father and Jasper was too young to remember the nights Sherlock would leave him alone because he didn't know how to entertain a child. The older Jasper got, the more comfortable that Sherlock felt, assured that he hadn't cocked everything up and grateful that his son appeared happy for all intents and purposes.
Whatever problems they had would be sorted and eventually the two of them would be alright again. They always only ever had one another to rely on, and now that John was gone, Jasper would need Sherlock more than ever.
“What are you doing,” Sherlock snapped, but the hallway was dim and his eyes shadowed as John tried to look into them. “Where did you get that key?”
The woman made a noise in the back of her throat, backing away as she watched John stuff a handful of beans past his cracked lips. "That's disgusting."
The bowl was empty and the cup had been drained upon contact. John fell back against the pipe, ribs expanding and retracting quickly as he allowed himself to breathe again. More, he needed more.
Sherlock led him up the staircase, then caught him up at the second, pulling John over by the lapels of his coat for a succulent, lingering press of lips. The clash of mint and tobacco spilt over John’s palate and the slickness of Sherlock’s tongue invaded his mouth and waged war with his own. Sherlock’s hand over the small of his back burned hot as it splayed underneath his bustier and just above his sacrum, rubbing with intent. Sherlock’s questing fingers wrought shivers down his spine, and John didn’t care anymore where they finally fucked, as long as it happened soon.
"Right-o."
Stamford couldn’t contain this round of giggles as he caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s surly face. “Nothing,” he said, sobering at last. “I brought you here so that you could relax, if you even remember the meaning of the word.”
"Tell me," Sherlock ordered, the words close enough to John's lips to taste, whispered with a fervency from the oft collected man. The roll of his hips were long and languid, a slow, wondrous dance that kept John right at the threshold, trapped between ecstasy and torment.
"Oh, no, no no, John, I'm not letting you pass this up because you're being paranoid." Mike was certainly pressing the issue harder than John had expected. He thought he would have an ally in his indecision, but Mike was firmly seated in opposition.
John’s head turned, enough so that Sherlock could see the outline of his upturned nose, the jut of his chin. Affection swelled in his chest and drew him up. He was crawling across the bed on his knees before he knew it, aching to touch John.
John meets the pack.
“Because they’ll think you’re barmy, you nutter,” John laughed, scooting an inch closer to Sherlock as a draft passed through the room from the open window. “Most people don’t see things the way you do, genius.”
Sherlock was obsessed with the very idea of keeping John safe, keeping John by his side. John was his lifeline.
Mrs Hudson teared up and held John close, still calling him doctor. "Doctor, I can't imagine what havoc you'll wreak on our Sherlock, but I'm happy to have you back." John bounced on his feet on her lap and let out a delighted squeal as she made faces at him.
Irene called and called until John answered and threatened to drag him to the club if need be. He’d been reluctant to return with her, unable to know what kind of road she’d drag him down, and though John had never told her where he lived, she’d known anyway. John eventually caved, convincing himself that it was only for Irene’s sake and not because there was something about the lights and the queens that drew him in. Before long, he was going once a week, then twice, and eventually nearly every day that he could.
“Never,” John breathed, shaking his head as he accepted the letter almost reverently. When his eyes flicked back up to meet Sherlock's, the other man was blurry. John blinked and his cheeks tickled with wet warmth. “Thanks, Sherlock.”
For the majority of what was left of their hour, Sherlock prodded and John, for the most part, stayed infuriatingly closed mouth when he didn't feel comfortable answering. The amount of progress could be equated to zilch.
“John,” Sherlock groaned, his voice faint from between John's legs, and John increased his pace, eager to please. His saliva eased the way, falling over his fingers as he momentarily dipped his tongue in Sherlock's urethra, tasting the salt of pre-come there. “Yes, that's lovely, John.”
All was quiet and uneventful during John's first half hour, post-Janine. Before she left, Janine had cut half the lights in the foyer, informing John that he could still take calls, but no one had any reason to come up to the floor. So John sat quietly in the dim light, tapping his fingers on gleaming marble absent-mindedly. He thought about ringing Sarah, but decided against it. They'd parted amicably as they always did, but John could tell that his friend had grown uncomfortable under Holmes's indiscreet surveillance.
Janine told him about her desire to open up her own restaurant once she finished cookery school, and John wondered how such a sweet woman put up with someone like Holmes on a regular basis.
As she was lowered on her swing, wispy white clouds of fog surrounded her, like a goddess descending.
However much John hated himself at the moment, he couldn't deny that the night had been explosive, and if given the chance, he would probably do it again. That is, if the opportunity ever presented itself again, the chances of which were dwindling every minute John wasted thinking on it, instead of figuring out how to get to work.
“Yeah,” John breathed, meeting Sherlock’s hooded stare beneath the fringe of his pale lashes. His moan fractured against Sherlock’s lips. “I like it, too.”
Sherlock couldn't stop staring, though the infant was no longer paying him any mind, suckling on his tiny fists. Sherlock didn't want to hold him, didn't want to take that chance until he was sure. Sherlock didn't even understand why he was entertaining the ridiculous notion that somehow whatever Förstner injected into John would turn him into an infant overnight. People didn't get second chances like that; science didn't work that way.
could barely stand to look at him any longer; his gravest mistake, his deepest regret.
Harry Hart. John wondered if this man’s umbrella could deflect bullets, too. Hm. John also may have been a bit tipsy, as well.
Sherlock had grown quiet, but John could hear water running on the other end. "I hate it when you muffle your noises," Sherlock grumbled, though without any real animosity.
"I found the baby in the drawer, and John's body was gone!"
His sigh is resigned when John sees that the stale bread, along with the handful of candies he'd dug up have 'mysteriously' disappeared.
John chuckled, recognizing a little bit of the old Jasper in there now; the mischievous grin, warm, insightful green eyes, and calm demeanour.
“Ehhh-”
“You’re so good like this, John, do you know how pretty you look with my ropes around your thighs, spreading you open?” He panted. “Your greedy, pink little hole gaping. I want to finish inside of you, watch my come dripping down your legs when you stand up.”
In the corner of his vision, John could see Sherlock's tense form visibly relax as his attention returned back to the microscope, but his hand on the table stayed curled into a tight fist, belying his tumultuous thoughts.
All those things and more had come to mind when he introduced Victor to John; his past and his future. As beautiful as Sherlock still found Victor to be, John’s presence in a room was unimpeachable, and Sherlock couldn't stop looking at him even as he made a conscious effort to do so.
He sank further into his seat, extending his legs in a long, languid stretch as his eyes wandered up that trim waist to a set of narrow shoulders that he could hardly wait to sink his teeth into.
John felt like a virgin being taken for the first time, coaxed and seduced by sweet touches, and just as anxious and overwhelmed as Sherlock twined his tongue around John’s. Their chins slid against one another, spit-slick and hot as they kissed with mouths wide open. He felt picked clean and devoured, stripped down. Exposed.
Sherlock went quiet for a moment, but John could see him hang his head through the screen. Then, his head tilted up as though he were looking towards the heavens, and something in John lurched at the curve of Sherlock's long throat. “Do you think about it often?”
Förstner fell and didn't get up.
With the beginnings of a migraine battering the edges of his consciousness, John returned to the couch and stretched out on his side facing the back of the couch with his arms crossed around his middle and knees pulled up. His eyes felt cottony behind the lids, as if little threads ran the width of them. Even with all the noise of Baker Street, the traffic, the blaring horns and screaming babies, burnt rubber, and bantering teenagers, it seemed as if life had come to a standstill in 221B.
It was the worst thing John would ever sit through, watching Harry suffer and not being able to do a thing about it, but wait until she'd purged the alcohol out of her system. After that, John knew he could never let his drinking get like that.
John puffed out an exasperated breath behind him, and Sherlock had to stuff down the urge to scream at him, rant and rave about all the ways in which things had been miserable, and how no one was quite like John though he searched and searched. He seethed, detesting that one person could have so much power over him.
John’s lips quirked happily at the news. Leave it up to Sarah to know when he needed some moral support.
Victor shrugged. “Well, take a bit of time off. Get yourself sorted—and by yourself, I do mean you and John—then you can get back to being Sherlock Holmes, the great narcissistic arsehole CEO of Holmes Pharmaceuticals and pseudo-detective.”
Sherlock slowed his movements, rocking his hips until he was prodding John's prostate with gentle presses, drawing out a series of low pitched moans from the back of John's lovely throat.
Sherlock scoffed coldly, "Then I'm sure you're aware that Jasper has invited John to live here."
Sherlock felt alive, whole for the first time in years. Of all the men he’d tasted, John was the sweetest. He’d missed the sound of his voice, that little whimper whenever Sherlock entered him. John loved his fingers, the length of them, all the places they could reach inside of him. Sherlock shamelessly played on this advantage, wringing as many wanton moans as he could from his lover’s throat.
Now John was curious to know what it was that Holmes wasn't saying. He was being cryptic and his choice of words were nothing if not alarming. God, this was probably exactly what he wanted; for John to be confused. Holmes dangled the information like bait, luring John in to bite, and unfortunately, it was working.
"Guess there's nothing to tell them, is there?" The words sounded hollow and wrong coming from his mouth, but John pushed away the sickening squeeze in his gut and plowed on. "I mean, relationships aren't your area, so what we do... I mean I'd just tell them it's a bit of fun. No harm done, no reputations ruined."
John couldn't help but silently agree.
Sherlock unlocked it and stepped inside. The room was empty and the bed neatly made. Two fingers of whisky awaited him at the table, next to a bottle of Glenfiddich and a carafe of water. The room was large, but not overly so. There was room enough for equipment, but otherwise, it was comfortable and closed.
John’s brow furrowed as he read the text. Had he  gotten pissed and given his number to someone at the cabaret? But no, he’d been regretfully sober every night the past week. Besides, the only man he would have thought to give his number to hadn’t made an appearance at the Looking Glass in days.
John smiled, already developing a strong fondness for the elderly lady. "John Watson, ma'am."
"- one day he took me to one of those bars, you know, but of course I hadn't realized where we were going at the time. I tell you, I'd never seen seatless trousers before-"
He'd stayed up all night studying for final exams and writing long, boring papers about topics he couldn't give two shits about. Just when John had finally fallen off to sleep, his flatmate decided it was a good time to give him a ring.
In the light, the foreskin was pushed back to reveal a glistening head. His erection was straining up towards his body in a graceful arch, the top, a rosewood pink that reflexively made John's mouth water.
It was during the scenes that Sherlock became what he truly was behind the suits: the sociopath, and Jim had reveled in every twisted second of it. Some days, Jim couldn't sit straight for the welts on his back, and dear him, it had been delicious.
Jim had been eager to please and had enjoyed the more depraved side of BDSM. Sherlock could remember one of the wilder nights they’d shared. Jim had been a glutton for pain and Sherlock remembered the caning he’d given Jim, and afterwards, the violent sex. It hadn't been healthy, but it was what they’d both wanted at the time.
Something wet dropped onto the paper, and Jasper pushed his glasses up and swiped madly at his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt, afraid to smear the ink on the letter.
John could only stare back, weary and wishing that the man would get on with it.
Slowly it came, but come it did, nevertheless, and John was deep in REM sleep when Sherlock pulled out the crumpled paper he’d found in John's den.
John’s shoulders slumped. “Mum—”
Jim pulled back and smiled maliciously. “It's been fun, friends, but I really must be going. Toodaloo,” he said with a wiggle of his fingers before turning and walking back through the crowd.
"It slipped my mind," Sherlock murmured between tight lips, bringing up his cup of tea for another sip, the sly bastard. "Not that you had anything planned to begin with, and as much as I would enjoy an entire day spent in bed with you, this is an urgent matter."
"As you all know by now, during our inspection of the southern border line, we were ambushed by a group of hunters." Sherlock paused momentarily, allowing the statement to settle in with his captive audience. Although everyone was aware of what happened, hearing him recount it aloud was oppressive, and the silence that followed, sinister.
John couldn't discern whether they were cautioning him away from the Hunters or Sherlock.
Anyways, I shan't tarry. On with the show!
He felt himself growing hard, his erection pressing against the fabric of his flannel pyjama bottoms.
Jasper snickered in amusement, tossing a potato crisp into his mouth. "Dad, I told John he could stay the night."
John laughed once, shaking his head in frustration. "You really are incorrigible."
John pushed away the green-eyed monster whispering ugly things into his ear, and joined the others outside, where they loaded up their bags in an SUV. Mycroft's luxury car was still parked on the gravel, though the man was nowhere to be seen; probably already packed away inside, hidden behind tinted windows.
"Would you like to know my pants size, as well," John quipped, the knowledge that he was poking at a sleeping beast not only exciting him, but encouraging his uncharacteristically bad behaviour.
to feel their flesh between his teeth and warm blood pooling down his throat. These hunters walked around alive, while his family rotted above ground, scoured with maggots and skin gone black. They would
“Remove your clothes, then get on the bed, on your knees.”
. For one, Sherlock handed John his card and darted off to inspect the tobacco brands, leaving John to fight with the stupid chip and PIN machine. Why?! What did John do to deserve a man-child and a dodgy machine!
“I can’t make up for Harry’s absence.” John paused to clear his throat, but his voice remained brittle when he spoke. “I was never going to be able to live up to that.”
Mycroft wanted to spit, but in the same turn, he found pleasure in the knowledge that he knew better than to get involved. Caring turned better men into savages.
Two to twenty was a large leap, but then again, John’s heart had stopped, he’d died in Sherlock's arms and grown cold. Now he was…
Jasper was watching him from under thick dark lashes, gauging his reaction, and the emotion behind his bespectacled green eyes wasn't wholly innocent.
He heard panting and turned to see Molly slumped against the arm of the couch, thighs squeezed firmly together as she came down from yet another orgasm.
He was horrified. That was the wolf he’d entrusted his life to, and one who sought to mate with him. A man-eater. A monster.
"You know what happened," Lestrade paused, breathing deeply, slowly, in and then out, "and you know what I came from. For me, do this for me, Sherlock."
John leaned against the basin, chin quivering as he tried to hold himself together, but it hurt more than anything he'd ever felt. He'd never get to see those people again, all John had to look forward to was burying their bodies. Now, they were somewhere he could not reach.
John could hear his name being spoken like a prayer now, and something about hearing Sherlock's possessive chant pushed him over the edge. John came harder than anything he had ever done, body convulsing beneath the larger one atop him, feeling as if his soul was leaving him. Sherlock was not far behind, hips moving erratically now, until they tensed above him, and pale eyes squeezed shut with the force of the orgasm, lips open in a soundless groan.
Sherlock ran his hands through his hair in frustration, pacing across the lounge room with long, crisp steps, while he gesticulated wildly with his hands. “John's pack was ambushed by the hunters, and in turn, he was left alive in order to lead them to the next closest pack. Using his biological imperative, they followed, or rather, herded him to my territory, though we can't be sure if they've discovered our exact coordinates.”
His voice fell lower as he walked further into the room, but John could still hear him ripping mercilessly into the person on the other end. Janine threw an amused look over her shoulder, though it did nothing to reassure John. He had never seen Holmes angry, but from what John read on the internet about his new employer, he was a shrewd businessman and when things slipped out of his firm hold, he could be vicious. John thought back to the interview he conducted with Holmes, and the comments about his tendency to be controlling. John didn't take Holmes for a man who tolerated mistakes with something so important as is company.
The moment passed in a silence so still, John nearly coughed to penetrate it, Sherlock was quicker. "You're an idiot."
A message from a mysterious madman, and the wolves need to relieve some stress.
Playlist:
,' John thought warily. That was a very unusual choice of words, and Holmes never said anything unintentionally.
“Any pain in your leg or shoulder?” Sherlock enquired, to which John responded in the negative. “Brilliant.”
The cupboard was filled with things John could identify, items he could try and put names to, and some he wouldn't know what to do with if his life depended on it.
Afterward, Greg rarely ever brought Mina to the flat, and whenever he did, he couldn't help but notice the way her eyes would flicker noticeably to and away from his flatmates. While John would at least make an effort to make Greg’s girlfriend comfortable, Sherlock had no such compunction.
Sherlock smiled fondly, clearly enjoying the sass, just as much as the view, as his eyes slid leisurely down John's chest, and then up, until their eyes met again. John couldn't help the little thrill of desire as he recognized the beast that lurked just underneath Sherlock's skin. He was hungry, and sod the sandwich, John was too. "I'll have to disagree with you on this, John. I believe I've found exactly what I was looking for."
John didn't dwell on the possibility that Sherlock could be trying to divert his attention. Instead, he allowed himself to yield to Sherlock's ministrations. He softened, loosened his jaw and made himself pliant. The subsequent rumble of pleased acceptance against his lips liquefied his bones.
Sherlock put his phone down beside his cutlery and crossed his hands on the table. "Obvious. I've come to hear your answer." As if John who reached out to him.
John blushed, unable to hold that all knowing gaze any longer, feeling inadequate in intellect to be having such a conversation with this brilliant man.
John hadn't even noticed the man, but looking at him, he wondered why that was. The newcomer was not at all ordinary, and his presence, alone, sucked up all the air in the room.
He groaned, pulling John’s lip between his teeth. Sherlock could still taste the tomato sauce on his tongue, the piquant bite of peppers and oregano, and the smallest hint of garlic. He wanted more, had to get closer.
Gillian was red in the face, and up close, John could hear his teeth grinding against one another. "Sod off, you fucking freak! Can't you see we're busy 'ere!"
Sherlock turned back to the rain, his fists clenching as he attempted to ward off the warmth climbing up his body.
for updates, excerpts and more Sherlock-y things! Feedback is much appreciated and highly motivational!
Jasper stepped back as if burned, eyes wide as he interpreted the meaning behind his father's words.
John’s back curved over leather, the material groaning as he shifted against it. He gasped, pushing back into Sherlock’s mouth as much as he could with his thighs bound to the chair legs.
Sherlock breathed a small sigh of relief as he released Murray's hand, though he kept a neutral exterior. Glancing at his watch, Sherlock stood and placed more than enough on the table to cover their fare, plus a tip. “Good. I'll have my assistant call you for your banking information.” Sherlock threaded his arms into his coat and tied his scarf around his neck, his eyes staring vacantly out of the window. When Murray stood, Sherlock turned to look at him, his lips in a tight line. “If possible, bi-weekly updates are preferable. I'll pay extra for pictures, but it isn't required.”
Lestrade was waiting for him when John stepped out of the bathroom. The older man lead them through the kitchen and into a dining room, where the pack was already gathered.
What could the alpha have possibly gone through to become so cold. John found himself honestly wanting to know the truth of Sherlock's past, though there was no way to read it on his skin or his face, or the way he held himself.
, John," Holmes shouted from around the corner, impatiently.
Sherlock tore his eyes away and waded forward through the crowd, bypassing the dining table, to drift closer to the stages.
John shadowed him back out into the opulent foyer where Janine sat, face first in a stack of paperwork. Holmes motioned for her to stay seated and walked John over to the lifts. Janine observed, perplexed.
“And you didn’t stay,” Irene deadpanned, her knees pulled to her chest as she gave John the most unimpressed look in the history of unimpressed looks. She couldn’t look anymore disappointed with him, and the thought didn’t settle well. “Why?”
Well, he thought, peering down at his erection through his pyjama pants, that wasn't going to go away on its own. So, Greg pushed away from the door and went for the lube.
He noted the time:
Ah, yes. Molly was infatuated with him for whatever reason, and no amount of unfriendliness on Sherlock’s part seemed to sway her. Tedious as her little crush was, it was an advantage when Sherlock needed to take home samples. No other pathologist in the morgue would allow him to take body parts home, and although Molly did so reluctantly, she never gave him grief for it.
Holmes threw him a knowing look and clasped his hands behind his back. "In two weeks time, my personal assistant, Janine, will only be available to work for me two days out of the week. I will need someone reliable to stand in her absence." Holmes paused his words and walked a slow circle around John. He followed the older man with his eyes, determined to keep him in sight.
"I reckon you would be after all that running. You can sleep in my bed if you'd like, it's dad's old one so it's big enough to fit a group of five," Jasper chuckled. In the corner of his eyes, John could see Sherlock turn rigidly on his stool, almost painfully uncomfortable with the idea but unwilling to interject.
John spun Sherlock around and looked into those verdigris eyes, dilated and glazed. “Are you ok?” he asked Sherlock, studying his face. Sherlock answered by grabbing the back of John's head and pulling it into his neck. John took his cue and sucked right above Sherlock’s collar bone and licked a line up his jaw. John was panting and devouring as much skin as he could. Sherlock moaned and grabbed John’s shoulders, pulling him closer and not letting go.
John reached into the drawer, finding condoms and a tube of lube. He spread some onto his fingers and returned to his task, rubbing and circling until he felt his middle finger slip inside. “God, Sherlock, you’re pulling me in. It’s so tight ...,” and he began to pump his finger, twisting in and out.
Sherlock knew John hadn’t removed a stitch of his own clothing yet and it made Sherlock harder. To be naked in front of a clothed John Watson ... to have John standing there, staring at him with such hunger in his eyes ... it was the stuff of fantasy.
"Oh, I've created a monster ..." John laughed and worked his way down Sherlock's body, pulling the sheet over his head as he went.
John took advantage of the neck exposed before him and started to nibble at it. "Yeah?" he said softly, "You liked that?"
“John!!” Sherlock screamed and slapped a hand over the back of John’s head to hold him there and began to buck and moan. John was fucking his arse with his tongue and Sherlock knew his legs were going to give out any second. “I caaa...n’t ... stay up ... ohhhhhhhh ...” he groaned as John pulled his tongue out and spread it flat and wide as pushed and rubbed it on that sensitive spot, moaning himself. Sherlock was going to come any second.
John lifted Sherlock off him and threw him down on his back. He knelt between Sherlock’s thighs and pulled his ankles over his shoulders while sinking back inside without hesitation. He grabbed Sherlock’s hips and began to pump in and out, quickly and forcefully.
John groaned and began to thrust up, losing himself in the feeling of wet warmth and the suction of Sherlock's mouth. He was so close ... any minute he would explode down Sherlock's throat. "Stop, stop .. come up here ... I don't want to ... not yet.. "
John met Sherlock’s eyes, looking for confirmation. Sherlock nodded and crossed his arms against the wall and rested his head on them. John sunk to his knees and began to knead, rub, lick, and pull apart Sherlock’s arse cheeks. He bit a soft spot and Sherlock moaned, “Don’t stop John, don’t stoooo ...” but lost his breath as John spread his cheeks as wide as he could and dove in. He began to lick and suck and eat like it was his last meal. “Fuck, Sherlock ... so long ... so fucking long I’ve wanted to do this ...” and he went back in, flicking his tongue around that delicious bud, licking long and hard, wiggling his tongue and pushing it harder and harder until he breached that pink hole.
“Oh, John,” Mary to the left whispers before she fades, fades, leaves you with reality once more, not with daydreams.
From somewhere, there was a crash; a yowl; a hiss; and the noise of two cats running like madmen up and down the staircase in the hallway.
You’re sorry, yes, of course, but you’re even sorrier—even guiltier—that you’re not as sorry or guilty as you should be. Sorrier, guiltier, more bitter, for knowing you never loved her enough (at all?) and not caring because you keep loving, loving, and loving Sherlock anyway. For wanting more, and always having wanted more. For Sherlock, for Sherlock, for Sherlock, your stupid, deceptive heart that knows peace only with Sherlock, never with Mary.
I’m fine, you say. You emphasise your half-smile by squeezing her hand that is in your lap. Fine.
His body follows his brain. A heaviness settles over him, taut muscles going pliant, and the sudden shock of anxiety departs as fast as it has come, leaving him just that bit shaky in the new-found stillness of his body. Very deliberately, he keeps staring at the darkness behind his eyelids and just breathes with Sherlock for a while; just breathes the air of the two of them, shared between their mouths.
That was the only development for a while.
“Like you’re one to talk,” Sherlock said, scratching Snuggles, sitting on her shoulder, idly beneath the chin. Snuggles made a happy noise, and Sherlock cooed back, smitten and dumb and not caring about it at all. The heartless detective—never heartless for pussies of any kind. Especially not for those that were currently in the room with her. “Look how fat Bubbles got, with you sneaking him all those treats.”
, you think, panicked.
“All right,” Sherlock agreed, primly. “I suppose you may be right. This time.”
Each of his words are a damp, brushed little kiss on John’s mouth.
John silenced him immediately. Sherlock’s thoughts couldn't even come to an end. “I swear to God,” John was saying, blinking furiously with one eye because everything around it was full of come, “I swear to God, if you start complaining about your arse being a bit wet now, Sherlock, I will punch you.”
You don’t want his blessing. You don’t need it. He never would have given it, anyway.
“It was,” Sherlock agrees, voice as quiet as John’s. His breath washes over John’s face—
God, how lucky John is. How indescribably, stupidly lucky.
Mary is wrong, though.
Of course. As if Sherlock could not observe him with eyes closed. Idiot.
Sherlock knows better, as always.
Through the mad thumping of his pulse in his ears, John recognises the tone of Sherlock’s voice: it’s his compliment voice, when idiot or imbecile or simpleton are dear or darling or, John imagines, sometimes, crazily, perhaps even love. A sour surge of hope rushes up his throat, stings the back of his eyes until it manifests wetly on his cheeks. Those stupid, traitorous tears he blinks onto Sherlock’s palm. That palm, then, very gently but insistently, cups his damp cheek and forces his head back so they are once more looking at each other.
Gravity: on his eyelids, and a heavy blanket of it—as if wet but dense—that weighs down his entire body. There is no actual blanket, just the heft of good, deep sleep on top of him.
Sherlock didn’t let John finish. He fisted the short hair at the back of John’s head and dragged his head back so his throat was exposed, all that glorious skin darkened with stubble. He quickly leaned backwards to impatiently push down his trousers and pants, hopping undignified on one leg to toss them away—his cock slapping his thigh with the movement, but he couldn't be arsed to care—and then swiftly brought his foot up on the couch behind John for better leverage, then his knee of the other leg on the other side, until he was veritably straddling John and shoving his cock into John’s face.
, your mind whispers, tired, so tired
Sherlock’s hand, cradling his face—and John did not notice. Before he knows what he is doing, he has closed his eyes and tilted his head, pushing his cheek further into the cup of Sherlock’s palm, against which his stubble scritches. He holds his face like this, lets his skin suffuse with Sherlock’s warmth. The chill-shudders are pleasant, this time, a bit sharper, quietly thrilling: and all over his body.
Sherlock’s lips, so close, receive them. In just a little spasm of emotion, his fingertips twitch against John’s jaw and cheek and temple.
“Fuck,” Sherlock grunted from between gritted teeth, and John's vulgar words made his hand at the back of John’s head clench. With John so openly inviting him, Sherlock didn’t waste a second more: he began to shift his hips back, slow as the tide, and watched his erection slide down the curve of John’s cheek, its heavy weight making it dangle to the left. His bollocks were touching John’s chin: with the shift of his hips back, the stubble raked roughly first over the underside of them, then the fuller curve of the front, and Sherlock lost a breath in a gasped, “Oh!” as the stubble scraped over the upper side. He stilled, stayed like that, eyes fixed on the sight of John’s eyes dark and possessive on him, on his own cock, barely touched and yet overstimulated, leaving trails of white pearling over the expanse of John’s stubbled cheek, translucent and milky on the dark, short hair, a filthy, entirely delectable sight.
You keep your eyes fixed on her. They grow wet. You feel your knees itch, want to get down on them before this cold, distant woman, want her forgiveness.
I’m moving on, you’re thinking, hard, emphatic, sudden, forceful. I’m moving on. You repeat it: I—am—moving—on.
It isn’t goobye. It can’t be: the grief has substituted the marrow of your bones, the loss has become your blood. Grief for Sherlock, the loss of Sherlock. Grief holds you up, loss makes you function; Sherlock has become even more vital for your wellbeing in his death than ever before, which is ironic. It is an irony he would appreciate, you think, idly, talking, as ever, to Sherlock, inside your head.
“Prior emotional trauma,” you mutter and snort into the heel of your hand. “Yeah, what trauma was that?”
Sherlock sits in your chair when you’re at work. You glance at him when your patient explains their ills to you, and the smile on your face is the first genuine of the day when you see him sit there with a disdainful, impatient expression glaring right back at you. Maybe he’s glaring at you for keeping him trapped here; it’s likely. Sherlock never did like the consequences of his own actions much.
With Mary gone, you don't really know what to tell your therapist.
He flexes his fingers when the chill-shudders stop short at his wrist.
“Oh of course.” Sherlock paused. “I can remember someone telling me just this week… how… what was it? Ah yes—
The thing didn’t go anywhere, at first: you liked her dragging the heels of her feet along the back of your calves when you were in bed; you adored the sight of her toes peaking out from beneath the blanket.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock muttered, feebly, roughly. “You asked for it.”
Sherlock silences him with an impulsive kiss. Tilting his head just so, with the tip of his nose digging into John’s cheek, he touches his lips to John. He stays there, like this, and their eyelashes brush over one another, rapid little flickers of terrible intimacy. His body covers John’s, the blanket having slipped down. His hands are large on John’s face, all-encompassing. John wants to crawl inside him and never come back out.
“You are not moving on,” Sherlock repeats, more quietly. “You are holding on.”
Sherlock’s forehead is not smooth. Through years of deep, unbroken thought, this is a stain his mind has left—two deeper lines, just above the centre, running parallel with slight dips in the middle. John wants to rub his thumb over them, from left to right and back again, so he can feel the little creases out.
“Don’t stop,” John hissed, “don’t you fucking stop, or I’ll put you down and—”
It isn’t even really a lie.
It surprises you.
That part now–you know this, you know this!–is all Sherlock: a certain naivety of character, a certain sweetness. God. Christ, Sherlock. Oh, Sherlock.
Good, Ella says. She says it with a smile. That’s good.
That’s the problem.
When his cheeks start hurting, he realises he has been smiling the entire time.
That’s not how it started, at least; it wasn’t about the texture initially. It started with John missing out on his shave for nearly two days (which they’d spent sleepless and chasing criminals, as they were wont to do), which gave Sherlock ideas. As John was fond of saying, Sherlock and ideas usually courted disastrous results, and Sherlock was inclined to agree. But this idea, this one particular idea, was not about courting disaster; it was about courting his oft ignored and dismissed physical needs, and wasn’t John always going on about how he needed to eat, how he needed to properly take care of his transport?
In every corner: scratching posts, toys, cat beds, wads of crumpled paper and tissues and wool. Though Sherlock was quite fussy and clean about it, there were cat hairs everywhere.
“I am more than fucking right,” John shot back, but it was with a small, crooked grin.
You would have—but the doorbell stopped you.
He’s once accused Sherlock of nothing but lies. Had said: it’s your mission, lying, you do it all the time. How wrong he’d been.
“I am not talking about Mr Holmes,” your therapist says sharply. “I am addressing the emotional abuse your late wife put you through, both actively and passively. The emotional abuse you fail to acknowledge.”
In sleep, Sherlock seems younger. His skin is smoother, not contorted in frowns or laughter. It simply rests, and there is a shine to it through the calm of sleep. His chins fold about his jaw, rendering the sharpness of his narrow face oddly soft and rounder than it really is. It is something that is reflected in his Cupid’s bow: dramatic and prominent, it presents a curiously softened V, the cut of it more supple and yielding than pointy. The lip underneath it is chapped, wrinkled by numerous tiny lines. John has the urge to smooth his tongue over it to lap over them so the wetness of his saliva would soften them into flatness.
Slowly, his eyes open. The bedroom manifests before him, colours blurring into one another until with a series of quick blinks, they clarify and retreat into their respective shapes.
Well, if you're offering, the taxi ride would only be 45 minutes max
From the doctors grin Greg was pretty sure he didn't want to think about it either.
Nothing immediately caught his notice, nothing out of the ordinary, but he stayed where John had placed him, the Doctors chin resting on his head and slowly, their breathing began to echo each others. Sherlock slowly began to realise that John was opening up over something, something important, something Sherlock couldn't put his finger on yet, but he trusted John and would let himself be show in the Doctors own way.
John chuckled and nodded "Yes, although when I explained all this to Mr Peterson, the only thing he heard was that I'd not helped Charles, I'd seen the damage done and moved on... Dan gets me the shooting here for saving his life, and I make sure not to use it very often"
It was so, so dark, and John's body was tensed, prepared for anything. What he didn't expect was the hear a door open and know Sherlock had entered the room.
Angry John? Indifferent John? A John that had moved on in six months, built a new, stable life? John gone... Moved out, leaving no forwarding address...
"You're quite right when you deduced that I would normally be chasing the case on site, and you also realised that I could have told you to get a twin room when you booked but I didn't"
John had already dialled the number he'd been looking for on his mobile, and Sherlock sat up with his eyes narrowed in that way John knew meant he was trying to work out his motives.
Sherlock sighed, and slid John's boxers down, once again halting his questions, "You're getting better at deducing situations, you know John" he purred, lowering his voice, and hiding the small smile even as he watch the fine tremors his words drew from the Doctor. John was hanging on his every word, desperately trying to make sense of this turn of events, and Sherlock would help him to understand.
it took moments to push the man onto the floor of the lift, and guide his legs until they were pressed against his chest, forcing Sherlock into a small huddled form
DI Dimmock had a mountain of paperwork and a strong desire to go home to his pregnant wife, leaving said irritating paperwork till after the holidays. It was Christmas Eve after all; he shouldn't still be working at six twenty pm.
"I'm going shopping, Sherlock"
"Didn't what, John?"
She ripped the paper from the second box and pulled out a large tub of moisturising cream; of a ridiculously expensive brand. Scotland Yard was paying them two men too much money. As she pulled the creamed gold out of it's container a small gift tag dropped onto the table and Sherlock's spidery writing caught her gaze again.
John blinked when the blindfold was removed as soft lips kissed him deeply.
John's new plan didn't stop the guilt that statement caused though.
"Merry Christmas, John" Sherlock muttered, slumping into the sofa as though he couldn't care less, but John noticed the corner of his mouth tuck in as he bit the inside of his lip, and grinned before carefully opening the box.
John didn't think he'd ever heard Sherlock quite that vulnerable, and he nearly told the man everything but he couldn't. Not yet. There was only a couple of day's left to Mycroft's Christmas party, and then he'd surprise Sherlock.
Sherlock turned to face him with his arms crossed, and a scowl on his face, but there was a glint in his deep grey eyes that John spotted before the detective smothered it.
The silence held for a moment longer before Sherlock heard the sigh
John ducked his head as Sherlock blinked back into the room and sent him a sharp glare "
Then the man did
Silence, except for the rustle of the investigation team, settled again, but not for long, and John sighed
The detective rolled his eyes and she prepared to scold him when she realised that her two tenants had gotten her Christmas presents.
"You mean..." Sherlock wasn't sulking; He didn't sulk "You mean, the best way to actually surprise you is simply to blindfold you?"
"That is it!"
When he'd suggested that a walk might help Sherlock think, he honestly hadn't been expecting Sherlock to take him up on the idea. It was barely above freezing and he'd not really wanted to leave the warm central heated flat, but it was walking or listening to another hour of that violin.
"Milk ... I thought I'd managed to strain all the-"
"This?"
The ghastly bobble hats that were revealed tested even Sherlock's control of his emotions and John managed to stutter over an unconvincing 'thank you' but, Sherlock noticed dryly, Harry Watson didn't seem to care much as she sat in an armchair laughing.
Sherlock's grin shattered across his face and he kissed John deeply, pulling a soft moan from the doctor before he pulled away, still smiling.
"Don't even think about it, you hear me? If you say one single word, I may actually do something I end up regretting" His voice was rough, tense, and unlike anything Sherlock had ever heard from the smaller man, and he felt goosebumps raise on his arms that had absolutely nothing to do with the cold London air. A nod was his only response, but John's new psychic abilities meant he knew, and something in his frame relaxed minutely. The ridiculously light-hearted radio station was the only sound in the car for the rest of the journey, as John attempted to temper his anger, and Sherlock tried to understand his reactions and the new emotions that kept creeping up on him unexpectedly.
"Please, Doctor Watson, call me Ariadne" she smiled softly, and John got the distinct impression he'd just passed some sort of test. This was confirmed when Sherlock relaxed behind his mother, and moved to stand next to John, linking their fingers together.
"Is this some kind of joke?" he heard his wife but couldn't make himself answer. Sherlock hadn't. Sherlock wouldn't. John wouldn't let him... But Sherlock had. Sherlock bloody Holmes had sent him a home test STD kit.
It was bloody freezing. John shivered, and shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket. He sent a sideways glance at Sherlock and scowled. The taller man was perfectly fine, long warm coat, scarf, leather gloves, and the freezing temperature combined with their languid stroll round the park had given the consulting detective's pale features a bright red flush to his face that lead John's mind back to the events of the morning; Warm, and in bed, and a delightful way to wake up his partner.
"I'm not sure how, but it seems to be coming together."
John sighed again, and offered the other man a weak grin "Thanks, I won't be in your hair long"
The doctor's eyes surveyed the room for possible hiding places that weren't exactly obvious. You had to be a genius to hide anything that wasn't regulation in the army, and John
"Mother, of course."
John's fingers were tight on Sherlock's hips as though he might push the man onto the floor, but Sherlock's fingers were just as tight, one gripping the left shoulder, the other gripped a handful of hair, angling John's head and kissing roughly.
John could hear the warning in his lovers voice, but Aridne either didn't or ignored it, from the widening grin on her features John would have put money on the second option
"I'm sure this is intended for use on your knees"
"Mummy..."
She eyes her small glass of Amarula, and shook her head before moving round her flat swiftly splashing the liqueur down the sink and pulling out a bottle of her dad's favourite whiskey.
"Seriously?"
John sighed when he saw Sherlock was still out for the count and checked his watch. He'd finished his last coffee nearly half an hour ago, and his fingers were starting to loose feeling again. Time for another one then.
"'course, they need all the help they can get, you know that... Surely you'd be back out there now if it weren't for that..."
"What I want to know, Sherlock, is when you found the time to sneak off and sabotage your brother's plumbing system."
"Merry Christmas, Sherlock"
Back at Baker Street, the door to their flat barely closed before it started, with Sherlock's tall thin body pressing John's shorter frame into the door and pulling gasps from him in moments as Sherlock ground their hips together slowly, teasingly...
John had been standing at the window for almost twenty minutes now lit in the orange glow from the street lamp outside, clearly waiting for something, but Sherlock hadn't questioned him. Now, however, John's warm brown eyes were focussed on him and he frowned
I know you're working a case, but will you be available for anal tonight? I'll be home in about an hour.
Lock, Sherlock?
The front door to their flat creaked open under his hand and the sight that greeted the consulting detective had him choking back a sob even as relief flooded his system. It took a moment for Sherlock to process what his eyes were telling him. The flat looked like he'd been gone 6 hours rather than 6 months. His laptop was open, a few lamps lit the room, the T.V was on low, but the Doctor sitting in his armchair, Union Jack cushion behind his shoulder was what dragged words from Sherlock's suddenly tight throat.
"I think if he'd met you at any other time, Dan would probably have reacted like Lestrade..."
John, lemme know if Sherlock comes up with anything?
"See you later then, Sherlock"
"Put that on then... and don't ask questions"
The sound of the worlds only consulting detective begging, lost John his control, hips snapped forward harshly.
"You didn't believe me."
He'd planned ahead for the last line; that surprise was already planned out and ready to go. John was also pretty sure he could find something to fill the "eleven drummers" with... but pipers piping was making him seriously worry.
"It's better than standing in the middle of the room sulking because you're wrong"
"He doesn't think we're good enough for each other" Sherlock growled, his fury reigniting but John soothed the flames swiftly, with a kiss to his lovers long throat, and tender brushing of his fingers along the back of Sherlock's neck.
"Sherlock!" John finally barked, stilling the man for a moment with his firm command and advancing on the consulting detective before he could recover, "What happened?" John dragged fingers through Sherlock's hair, and gently forced the mans ramrod stiff frame to bend towards him and curl round him, tense fingers clutching at Johns waist.
"Where?"
"But, John..."
"We're out of milk"
Lestrade told me the case is closed, you want breakfast in the morning?
"Problem?"
Mr Lewis laughed, and John managed a small smile. He could only see one way that Mycroft would get pure sodium lining his water pipes.
He smirked, pressed his short nails into John's sides, drawing a breathy hiss, and dragged himself back up his lovers body, pressing a deep kiss to the man's mouth, smothering the his cry as he felt John shudder his release.
John had a sudden rush of worry that Sherlock was angry that he'd solved it, but then the taller man glanced back at him and the heat in his gaze drove the thoughts from the doctors' mind. He'd dismissed Lestrade quickly, and wasted no time in tugging John outside to hail down a cab.
Even with the blindfold on, Sherlock glared and even with the blindfold on, John knew and laughed.
"I was just thinking that, at this rate, I'll be lucky if you don't work out where we're going before we get there" there was a pause, and the Sherlock could hear the smile in Johns voice "What with that mental street map of yours"
John raised an eyebrow as he closed his book and leaned back into his chair.
"I don't want to know what happened in my room..." He paused as he caught sight of the new target drawn on the wall in shaving foam, with two bullets in the centre and shook his head before heading into the kitchen without another word.
"Don't worry about it."
"J-John-"
Between Anderson and Donovan's snide comments were questions and a lecture from Lestrade about recklessness, and the commandeering of police property, and then came the questions about how the mastermind ended up dead... John announced that Sherlock would need medical attention and that Lestrade could continue the interview at a later date, and as they left the scene, John's still tensed arm around Sherlock's slim waist, the consulting detective made a mental priority note to ask Mycroft if he could clean up the mess he'd gotten his flatmate into...
"Now, John, I want you now" the detective hissed drawing a shuddering groan from John, as he pressed a harsh kiss to his lovers mouth, his tongue sucked mercilessly into Sherlock as he pressed against the man.
With a warm smile and soft thanks, he turned to find Sherlock standing behind him and he nearly dropped the tickets, glaring when the detective merely smirked.
He felt Sherlock stiffen, and tugged the taller man closer, almost too close for the dance.
His hands were shaking again, if this was a joke he's not sure his blood pressure could take it. Three cases where Sherlock co-operated? Really?
His hands drifted down the front of Sherlock's deep plum shirt and tugged a few buttons open, releasing the tension his partners deep breaths were causing and giving him better access to that smooth column of pale creamy skin, almost glittering in the light still streaming through the window.
It took a few heartbeats for Sherlock to breathe again, but when he did he spotted the corner of John's mouth twitch. "You should know by now that you can't sneak up on me Sherlock..."
He would make certain they didn't run out of milk if it killed him, and at the current rate, Sherlock was going to win. If john had to resort to Internet shopping to beat the demented genius who found milk perfect for experiments then he would!
"You're tired, Sherlock, you said so yourself, so I suggest you go to sleep", not caring if Sherlock did as he said, John made the most of the extra rest at his flatmate's expense, and drifted into a light sleep of his own.
"you're smaller like this" John whispered, his voice soft and barely audible to Mycroft, "it makes the room around you bigger, you're on the far wall... so there's more distance between your eyes and what they can see and the end of your vision... and now I want you to keep looking at me" he paused and a smile ghosted over his face when he realised those pale grey eyes hadn't yet left him, and they were so wide and open and naked with fear and trust that John couldn't stop a soft hand brushing over the mans cheek
I'm clearly having a very bad influence on you John, even I'm not partial to cannibalism
So John Watson must be a much better influence than he'd given the ex-service man credit for. There was a sealed envelope taped to the top of the box, and Mycroft ordered his people to leave the room as he carefully sliced through the paper with an ornate silver letter opener.
"Ah, John … The rain, ground wet now … uh ..."
Well, to put it simply, Sherlock's constant shifting wasn't making it easy for John to keep his unhealthy interest in the man hidden from notice. If fact, the shifting and soft brush of skin along his body, was making certain parts of him determined to alert the detective as to just
"That's it! John! Mrs Osman was in a relationship with another woman! He was ashamed of her! That's it, that's the motive! Oh how did I miss it!"
Silence lapsed again, this time comfortable and Sherlock didn't break it again, contenting himself by trying to figure out their location, but when the driver went round an either incre4dibly large round-about or round a small one multiple times, Sherlock gave up and settled back into his eat.
: JOHN
"Yeah, didn't notice it at first, thought I'd dodged everything when the pipe exploded-"
Onto his second cup of coffee from the small stand situated near the middle of the park, john was starting to wonder if Sherlock's brain had simply frozen in the frigid temperatures. The man didn't seem to be reacting to everything, merely keeping his eyes to the ground and following John silently, with the tiny frown between his eyebrows that showed he wasn't really present. John could ask him anything now and get a truthful answer, but really the doctor would rather Sherlock solve the damn case.
The weary detective looked up at Sherlock's whine in time to see the doctor close his eyes with a sigh,
"I may have deleted the text message he sent you, I thought I could talk him out of us having to go."
"Then why?" John's voice was muffled against Sherlocks shirt, but the man knew what John was asking.
The intimate embrace they'd wrapped themselves in to watch the parade, and the eleven drummers that Sherlock had been so suspicious of, surprised Sherlock. He knew John wasn't fond of public displays, but his arms wrapped around John, and John's hands tugging at him, with Sherlock's head on his shoulder and nose against the doctors neck... It didn't belong in a photo album, as far as the consulting detective was concerned, this picture was... well, he sent John a heated look and the doctor grinned, before waving a hand at the book, insisting Sherlock continue with the last entry.
Get Lestrade to give me anal.
"Christmas is about love, is it John?"
John pulled back with the help of a sharp tug to Sherlock's hair and breathed heavily for a moment, never taking his eyes from Sherlock's "Excuse me Sarah, but it seems I'm wanted at home, I'm sure our dinner's going cold... wasn't it Indian tonight, Sherlock?"
No. Sorry. This has to be your phone, but I simply can't decode it. In fact, I think I'm mentally scarred.
John shook his head grinning and leant against a rotting beam that looked like it used to support the main structure of the building, but the light chuckle stopped when Sherlock turned and fixed him with a heated look.
It takes an innocent conversation with Mrs Hudson in the afternoon to solve John's dilemma for the third line of his poem. After all, he wasn't going to buy Sherlock three French hens, so the next best thing was eggs. Which the detective wouldn't eat.
"No, you don't need me there"
"Who was that?"
"Did you know, swan's mate for life Sarah?" the young lad whispered in what John assumed was supposed to be some sort of flirt. The girl clearly fell for it as she gasped at the small group of swans that her boyfriend had pointed out swam lazily near the bank they were sitting on.
I need you to meet me at Barts, I think I've worked out what toxin was used to kill Mrs Potts
"In addition, he also promises not to withhold evidence, or to go off on his own and investigate under his own steam without informing you, unless there is a very real chance that doing so will loose the suspect."
John's body never moved but for a moment amusement flickered over his face and into his eyes, lighting him up from inside, and drawing Sherlock to his side like a moth to a flame.
"No one can interfere, not unless we let them..." Sherlock pulled back and John caught his lips swiftly, gently, almost a brush of skin against skin rather than a kiss filled with emotion.
"In the hopes that you will use it to actually see something."
"Sherlock, we-"
"What are you looking for exactly?" Lestrade asked softly as he swiped his access card. John had flown through the visitor sign in procedure, obviously desperate to get home with something to distract Sherlock before their entire flat had been destroyed
Shot. Unsalted.
"He's been bored before, I'm sure-"
"I've know you were interested since that night at Angelo's, John... but I had to know why.. was it me, my body, my mind, gratitude for helping you... or were you simply interested... in ...just-"
"I have promised not to use the new fried as an overflow."
The doctor growled softly, and glared pointedly at the DI "tell me I'm not here because you wanted confirmation of a report I spent hours writing last night, Greg, tell me that I'm not dead on my feet for something this ridiculous, because when it comes down to it, he wouldn't dare forge
His marriage was over.
"Come here then."
Damn phone! Shit shit shit!
"For someone as smart as my brother..."John looked back at Mycroft to see him staring across the room, his eyes narrowed in a calculating manner before he shook the look away, "I see that you're still fixing my brothers Christmas present?"
If he spoke he's stutter, he just knew it, and he nearly dropped the papers at the magnitude of this gift. What John had done to convince the man? Give him a temporary concussion maybe, forged his signature, also possible...
"You said yourself John, you couldn't have done anything for Dan's brother..."
He must have looked worse than he'd thought because no sooner had he accosted an officer to photocopy the files for him, than they were being pushed back into his hands, along with a cup of Police strength coffee.
"Sherlock?"
A hot cock before bed
No, Sherlock
He forced his thoughts to stop swirling round his head and Sherlock slowly made his way up the seventeen stairs to his flat. Their flat. His and Johns.
Johns hand snaked upwards, and gripped hold of a bracket still attached to the beam, and used it to hoist himself up, wrapping his legs around Sherlock's hips, and freeing Sherlock's hands to caress skin, licking and nipping until John was writhing and completely focussed on the mouth tormenting his chest.
"Wonderful"
They weren't serial murders after all, the consulting detective had explained in a tone that suggested it should have been obvious, they were serial executions.
Because I actually filed the appropriate complaints for his on-scene behaviour towards a professional consultant who was called in by his superior office.
*Garage. David Pearson's, And yes, there probably will be. I'm sick of this phone.
Silence fell and John swore as the lift came to a juddering stop, shaking everyone's balance. The last thing he wanted to do on a Sunday afternoon was get stuck in a lift, in Scotland yard, with both Holmes brothers.
"He's played his violin all night, for three nights straight... He's blown up the microwave, I don't even want to ask him what's on the inside of the oven, I order food and it gets used in his newest experiment that he then looses interest in, when I left he was drilling a hole in the ceiling through to my room, now are you going to
"Afternoon Mr...?"
John kept up the slow teasing torture, and leant over Sherlock, careful not to damage the ice-cream on his stomach, and took his time, decadently sucking sauce from Sherlock's nipples, only stopping once they were clean, red and hard, and Sherlock's writhing became intense enough to be utterly distracting.
Sherlock needn't have bothered, John was ahead of him, a second finger pushing past the body's barriers and leaving both men gasping in anticipation. John pressed against his lovers' sweet spot a couple more times as he prepared the man, and y the time the doctor was satisfied, Sherlock was squirming onto he sofa.
"What's your favourite food?"
Dinner went well. John finished cooking and serving while Sherlock got cleaned up, and while far from perfect, it was the best Christmas John could remember having. If the turkey was more cardboard than meat, the potatoes more brick that roast, and the parsnips more buggered than burnt, nobody said anything, silently blamed the recipes, and complimented the chef.
"I shouldn't have said ... what I did, or reacted-"
The consulting detective almost sighed as he looked up from his book, turning his now undivided attention on the ex-army doctor
"Oh, shut up."
"So you're that Doctor then"
"John" Sherlock tried again, his vice still soft, but the man in question wasn't done.
It was the first of December, and John had been in Afghanistan last December. With no close family to speak of he'd offered to stay so one of his squad could go home and see his new month old little girl.
John started towards him as the consulting detective leapt from his seat, his eyes wide like a child who's had a chocolate bar smacked from his hands.
"You're damn right it's shutting down, what the hell did you think you were doing?" The Doctor shouted, waving an arm at the length of rope Sherlock had hanging from the hole he'd been drilling in the ceiling before John had left.
"Go to sleep, Sherlock"
The man in question began running over any number of hidden experiments that John may have found to evoke his anger, before discarding the idea. John had just come home after all, so it must have been something while he was out.
Sherlock watched from the doorway, his blood boiling. John was talking with her, and laughing. He shouldn't be laughing, Sarah was his ex, and shouldn't they be fighting? Or at least not be this
"Yes, since he was very young-"
"It's interesting to meet the man who's managed to get through to Sherlock, he's always been suck an introvert, John."
Shot?
Sherlock scowled, and John continued his story, as they continued their slow wander through the frozen Peterson's lands and collecting their prizes as they went
"I fail to see the point" he sulked, jamming his hands deeper into his pockets and John shook his head, and propelled them both through the crowds with ease to stand at the front, with a direct view of the Christmas parade
"Are you going to enjoy the dancing this evening, John?"
The car door slammed shut, and the doctor drove out of the car park in silence. If Sherlock apologised for his behaviour, neither of them ever mentioned it outside of the vehicle.
At least, not until long fingers teasingly rubbed at the hard bulge that was tenting his boxers impressively.
"Good Shot..."
John froze, and raised his eyes from his book to Sherlock's frowning gaze. He truly looked puzzled.
Thanks John, and I will... btw, TMI?
There was a glint in the taller man's eyes and suddenly it hit John like a punch to the gut. This was payback for making the man go to the hospital. He dropped both mugs onto the coffee table, slopping the hot liquid everywhere and stalked up to his room to change clothes without another word. He'd have to deal with Sherlock later, but if there was a flu outbreak the overnight surgery would be flooded, and his new partner had just signed him up to working all damn night.
"Want to be like swans, Sarah?" John barely smothered a laugh as he half watched the boy's fumbling hands but his laugh would have been better than what happened next
"It wouldn't have been a great leap to deduce who had booked under Holmes, Mycroft doesn't eat here."
"I most certainly am not!"
Sherlock was studying him intently when John finally came back to himself, and he was suddenly determined to wipe the smug smile from his partners face. A firm jerk of his hips, had Sherlock's focus thrown and a wave of pleasure cross his currently unguarded features as John sat them both up slowly, arms wrapped round Sherlock as he nibbled Sherlock's ear, and waiting for the shiver he knew would come from the action.
Sherlock opened the dining room door, and let John in first, both of them sharing a private smile.
"I noticed you bough a longer coat, and it suited you, but it's been ridiculously cold this year so-"
Mycroft had to admit the doctors' signature in the post script was comforting, and he studied the caustic tone of his brothers' letter for a moment before letting loose a rare unguarded smile.
John wilted, too tired to bother continuing the argument over Sherlock's latest experiment and merely passed over the files.
"Oh stop
The doctor relaxed noticeably, and Sherlock frowned, eyeing the drink speculatively "You tricked me"
"Next...?"
Sherlock, I can't get Cyanide for you
"Are you all right?"
The doctor caught the light shiver, and wondered if it was the temperature of the room or the command he'd been. He was tempted to find out as that lithe form climbing between the covers made his jeans rather uncomfortable, but now wasn't the time.
John blinked slowly, not entirely sure he'd heard correctly.
"Lestrade! I need to look through your cold cases!"
He'd somehow failed to notice what John had been up to until sure strong hands unzipped Sherlock's trousers, and the cold night air crept around them, another deep kiss, and Sherlock's long fingers hitched Johns leg round his hip, pulling him free of the trousers bunched around his ankles was all it took for conversation to cease.
*Have a horrible *Headache!
Sometimes John went missing for a couple of hours in the middle of the day if they didn't have work to do for Lestrade, and returned in the same state. He always took a shower, which was helpful because the smell of sweat really wasn't something that Sherlock found appealing, but the consulting detective was drawing a blank when he tried to work out where John was going.
Taking in the man before him, he concurred that he wasn't far off the mark, although to a passer-by John seemed perfectly normal Lestrade knew that compared to normal John looked a positive mess.
Why had he woken up when his skull had obviously been bashed in, judging by the amount of pain he was in?
"It wasn't difficult to deduce that being tired requires sleep, John."
It was a long time before either of them moves, and then they simply shifted so they could wrap their arms around each other, as Sherlock pulled the blanket over them for warmth.
They began moving round the room after a few false starts, but eventually they joined the crowds of people in a smooth waltz.
*couch, not crotch... although, it's an interesting idea for another night... see John? I told you that, logically, the phone's auto correct had to be useful for something.
"I was thinking that I'd like to fuck you right here..." that velvet voice purred, and John felt a shiver travel down his spine as his lover prowled towards him, pressing him into the support and kissing him till they were both panting with little to no chance of catching their breath.
Normally it wouldn't bother him, but some days, he just didn't have the patience to deal with both Sherlock and the ignorance of Lestrades' team. Even people outside of Greg's department had begun staring and whispering just lately.
John frowned as his eyes scanned the room once more, his thoughts whirling and he thought, for a moment, that he might know what it felt like to be Sherlock, as the man himself threw his arms in the air and stalked towards his partner, slumping against the door next to the distracted doctor.
He shouldn't be finding this tiny tyrant so inexplicably attractive, but the longer John scolded him, the more Sherlock wanted to stop him with teeth and tongue, and he almost welcomed the arrival of the Yarders, before he truly embarrassed himself.
...Just come home, and I'll show you.
"You genius, John... These are old, the cold cases? He won't let me in there, probably worried I'd embarrass him... hmm..."
Despite his words, Sherlock did stop and wait for the doctor, before continuing at a slower pace.
If John didn't know better, he'd say Mycroft has caused the snow to stop Sherlock taking an alternate route home too. But that was just silly.
Occasionally John would glance at Sherlock, to see the man studying the dangers with a sharp intense gaze, and other times Sherlock would have his eyes pressed closed, and his head tipped as he studied the notes of the musicians with a musician's ear.
With supreme will power the doctor gently pushed Sherlock's taller frame away from him, and the harsh breathing of both men echoed round the dark room. Now his eyes had adjusted to the gloom, John could just make out Sherlock's features, and he shook his head softly.
At that point words were abandoned, and their conversation continued in a private language all their own, involving tongues, and teeth and the many tones of gasps and hisses that only the two men in the bedroom could translate accurately.
He ignored the gushing vocals of his wife, and decided that he would need to thank John Watson, but then Anderson's gaze fell on the smaller gift, from Sherlock Holmes and he felt his suspicions rising.
Sharon Swann's profession as a private investigator meant that she had the contacts to know which shops to hit, when and how to bypass their security systems, it also meant she knew exactly when she became a suspect, and when they were coming for her. The warehouse that she used for offices had been set up like some kind of minefield; furniture piled up as obstacles, acid on door handles, and tripwires connected to various dangerous projectiles. Even Sherlock had to admit that they wouldn't have made it through without John's expertise in navigating a different type of minefield in the Afghan Deserts. Miss Swann, however, did not take kindly to being cornered, her diversions and traps bypassed, and much to Sherlock's exasperation, the woman pulled a gun on the two men as they entered her main office.
Sherlock had always seen eating as an unwelcome necessity that slowed him down at the most inconvenient times, which was why he stopped eating whenever a case came along. When he had to eat, restaurants provided sufficient sustenance, and were usually free to him, but eating in restaurants every time quickly became repetitive and dull.
"Chemist?"
"I could have administered an overdose of morphine and put him out of his pain, instead he bled out after having his legs blown off below the knees"
The fact that Sherlock didn't even grumble at the menial task was actually a little unnerving, but John wasn't going to complain.
John, I need you to lick me in my room. Now.
John rolled his eyes with a soft "of course" but otherwise, watched Sherlock with a look the detective knew well. It was the glittering gaze the doctor locked on him when he thought Sherlock was being '
"Why didn't you text me?"
"Why didn't you text me? I could have got some from the shops on my way home..."
"I was doin' this job at some nearby posh house, pipes leakin' an all the normal stuff"
Strangely enough, John found his lack of comments reassuring. If he wasn't picking it apart or correcting it, he was surely enjoying the performance, and after the first interlude, the doctor began to relax.
Although, that wasn't entirely true. As they started their fourth circuit round an impromptu football match that was now coming to an end John went over the case in his own mind for lack of anything better to do.
or not?"
The door to 221B creaked and he slid through the smallest gap possible and leant against the door to shut it, resting his back against it and closing his eyes against the pitch black room with a relieved sigh. Home. Quiet. Peace. Lips... kissing...
"Not entirely, to make it neautral I had to add-"
Checking to see if Sherlock had been alive, those same hands had been steady as a rock, but now they were trembling, and the consulting detective, for once, was speechless.
"Well pacing is not going to help" When the agitated man spun to snarl more words at the Doctor, John shoved him hard in the shoulders until his back was pressed against the far wall of the lift, and the wind was knocked out of his lungs. John smothered a smile as Sherlock attempted to argue, but couldn't get enough breath back to raise his voice, emitting what sounded like childish whines of complaint, and getting John to soften his guiding hands.
The man wasn't tired, there was no sigh of weariness in his face, but if Sherlock wanted to play this game, fine, John would play. He would win too.
"First, Sherlock, I need to hire a car" John added, tugging his coat close, and checking again to make sure that his partner had left the browning indoors "and you're going to pay for it"
There's no way she could stay.
Sherlock took another moment to study his partner's confident gaze before he opened the book, the spine creaking as he revealed the first picture.
He checked his sudden grin, and glanced at Sherlock again before sighing. He needn't have worried, the taller man was so deep in thought, John could have walked them into the pond and he wouldn't notice.
They sat in a balcony box watching the small troupe of male ballet dancers perform a beautiful rendition of Swan Lake, sitting in surprising silence as the twelve elegant figures of the swans leapt and danced their way across the stage in motions that were almost beyond fluid and the form of the prince was cowering away.
"I could have sleep on the floor, the chair, the window seat, or not slept at all and kept you up all night with the light from the laptop..." Sherlock's voice escaped him and he stilled as John's heavy leaking cock twitched in his hand, and a low predatory growl escaped that Doctor that said more clearly than any words Sherlock had ever heard "For gods sake stop being a fucking tease", and Sherlock suddenly found his throat extremely dry.
"You... what?"
"What?"
The consulting detective opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, but no other sound escaped him, and John's heavy, unsteady breathing was the only thing either of them could hear.
Gods! Don't bloody do that to me!
"Give me your phone, Sherlock."
When, as they'd been dragging their coats on to leave, Mr Peterson had snarled "What are you going to do with six bloody geese anyway?" Dan had glared along with John as the doctor calmly replied that he planned to eventually eat them, but in the meantime they had a fully functioning freezer at home that would save the birds for whenever they wanted them.
If I turned up on your sister's doorstep, you'd never forgive me. Try hot coco as a half baked substitute, and I'll make it up to you tomorrow ;)
They were both moving on auto pilot when they reached Baker Street, John paying the driver, Sherlock opening the door, granted, more slowly than usual to compensate for the bruising across his chest, painting his porcelain skin every colour from green to purple, and John hanging their coats in the hall. The two men were inside their flat with the door securely between them and the rest of the world before they began coming back to themselves.
It was going to be a very long day. Sometimes John could just tell. Sometimes he would wake up to the fizz of an experiment gone wrong, or just that feeling of something slimy crawling up his spine that told him the day was going to be long and troublesome.
"Ah! ... More, John..."
Sherlock's fingers entwined with his helped.
"Umm... well, you said... Happily married"
"Let me go, John!"
"Good morning John! You're looking well..."
"Wonderful! I can tell I'm going to like you Doctor Watson."
"What's this?"
"Dinner?"
"Yes... I was speaking with Lestrade, and he may have pointed out that the reason we're arguing more is because you're not getting that first cup of tea in the mornings..."
Two years after the fact, and with nothing for ballistics to go on, there was very little chance of catching the murderer, but Sherlock's theory was that their killer had been on the other end of the phone with them at the time of the shootings, and the length of the phone calls suggested that the victims had been toyed, subjected to mental torture, before being executed.
On my way, what happened?
"So, John, what are we seeing?"
John was standing next to his armchair doing a lot of his own staring and he saw more than the facts. Doctor Watson could see the emotions floating in Sherlock's grey eyes. He could see the fear and uncertainty and pain in his detective and his anger at being left behind melted, waiting for a better time to be addressed. For now, John just sighed softly.
Soft kisses along the back of his neck, brushing curls of hair out of the way as a soft mouth danced across his skin drew a small shiver from Sherlock and he relaxed more fully against his lovers thighs even as a hint of moist tongue dragged across he shell of his ear.
Sherlock grinned "Good to know"
The woman's eyes flicked over their entwined hands, and it was so natural Sherlock couldn't have said when their fingers linked together, but when she raised her eyes to his face, he couldn't quite managed to cover the smirk.
"Facts, John..."
"Right then, Merry Christmas."
John almost jumped when the detective's cold nose was pressed into his neck with a soft sigh of "ridiculous."
"John, you-"
"I'm safe now Sherlock, we both are, together... always together" It was a breath as he fell asleep, but even in his dreams, Sherlock heard.
"Why don't I remember this invitation?"
Sherlock wasted very little time in getting them the last few streets back to 221b Baker Street.
"You don't have to say it again", the doctor cut off Sherlock's third apology and Sherlock looked relieved, and murmured a soft "come to bed?" instead.
Deprived of one last argument Mr. Peterson had stalked from the room, and John and Dan had exchanged a relatively cheerful goodbye.
"Fine" The detective turned to gaze out of the windows for a moment, frowning, "We're practically on the other side of London, John!"
Dan blinked at Sherlock for a moment, his hand still wrapped around Sherlock's hand and he frowned
Sherlock had faced criticism, and jealousy, and taunting his entire life, but what he wasn't used to was hearing the Yarders turning that kind acidity on John and it wasn't taking long for it to wear through his patience, not that he had much of it to begin with.
"Don't knock it" John muttered, drawing the inspector's puzzled frown, "You haven't got any clue what I've had to do to get him to agree to this."
"I couldn't get out to the shops for any appropriate alcohol, so I'm afraid it's a non-alcoholic version this evening!"
It was the small sniggers they thought he couldn't hear every time, John's hand brushed against his, and the disbelieving mutters every time John made him smile. They were treating the new level of the relationship between the two men like the Doctor was keeping a mental patient happy, and pitying him in the process.
They'd arrived at Angelo's, paid the extortionate taxi fare, and Sherlock let John enter the small Italian first. It had nothing to do with how John's new coat pulled slightly around the mans hips, Sherlock insisted mentally, it was simply that John had booked the table, so he would need to speak to the waiter on service.
Sherlock pressed his face into the crook of John's shoulder and felt the smaller man jump as Sherlock's icy nose brushed along his neck, and then Sherlock breathed in, the lump in his throat easing, and he froze.
"Hmm?"
"There's not enough data... You could have chosen something you believe I will enjoy, or a preference of yours, this is a busy part of London John..."
I'm at work, of course I'm busy... although, considering the alternative... I'm on my way home.
He heard someone behind him hiss, and mutter something about "Seven years bad luck...!" and John couldn't stop the slow grin from creeping over his face. The speaker was right, and that's exactly what Mr Martin had been banking on.
Their eyes locked again, and John could feel the tension in the room rising, but his gaze hardened and Sherlock sighed, defeated, and turned to change. Acting as a doctor for the moment, John averted his gaze from Sherlock's stunning body as he shed his clothes to slip into the pyjama bottoms, but the stretching expanse of bare creamy chest wasn't doing anything for John's self control.
John glanced at his untouched lunch, and decided he wasn't going to get to eat it worrying about Christmas presents anyway, so sent a smile at Sarah and pressed the lid back over his cold pasta.
Mr Lewis lifted his left hand, and john took hold gently, lifting his magnifier to the burn after a moment or two, and listening to the man's explanation.
"Just be quiet John, we don't want to disturb the other guests hmm?"
"How dare he!" Sherlock hissed, practically quivering as his fury filled the room and John folded his paper standing slowly as though approaching a wild animal.
"John..."
A pillow fell, rubbing Johns cheek and the shifting kept the thing batting at his face, so John simply grabbed it to keep it still, and groaned loudly into Sherlock's mouth when long fingers wrapped around his length, dragging along him in quick motions that had John writhing beneath his lover, crying loudly.
This was another test, and from Sherlock's suddenly tense form, he didn't think they would get out of this one, but John smiled softly, and squeezed Sherlock's hand to shut the mans mouth.
"No, none of them, they need to be soft leather, I'm certain Mycroft will having dancing."
Sister! Always something...
"Yes"
He heard the other man pause in the doorway, and Sherlock gathered the last of his strength. Really he was lucky he hadn't been ill yet.
A full meal, a show that had genuinely moved the sociopathic detective, and intense, even for them, kisses in a darkened booth, meant that John wasn't entirely surprised when Sherlock began dozing lightly.
You don't want me to answer that. Behave or I'll sic Sherlock on you
Carefully he opened the envelope from John Watson, wary of what may be inside, but all that fell out was a small business card.
was the one who slammed doors. Sherlock angry became quiet and disparaging...
Anderson knew she would watch, and knew Sherlock was making him choose. He hated to admit it, but Sherlock Holmes had helped him realise that he didn't want to loose his wife.
Sherlock moved closer to the tree, his sharp grey eyes taking in everything and his face glowing orange in the lights the doctor had scattered around the room.
"To what purpose?"
Here for a while...
I'm going home
Not sure, will be heterosexual for a while though
Sweet Dreams, John
"See, John? I told you this would be a waste of our time-"
The shaking in his hands lessened at the joke, and the DI even managed a shell-shocked smile as the doctor continued explaining the documents in his hands worth their weight in gold.
"Gifts from... colleagues."
"Two one to me Doctor Watson"
He could almost heard Sherlock's teeth gritting together as the young girl giggled and gazed at where her boyfriend was pointing
Crispy dick
Eventually, in pure desperation, he added ten of each type to his trolley, and was glad for his 'Christmas Bonus' that would go in his bank later in the month. If he was exceptionally lucky, he may even get the consulting detective sitting at home to eat something tonight, but he wasn't holding his breath.
"They're an old symbol for love, because turtle doves mate for life, and since that's what Christmas is really supposed to be about... love, friendship, companionship, trust... you know, not all the shopping, and the food, and the waste..."
He'd been in Afghanistan last December, and had forgotten how much bloody fruit supermarkets sell on the lead-up to Christmas. He just wanted some pears!
"What the ever-living
"Lewis, sir."
John had insisted the farm house pluck the birds for them, and while they'd waited the doctor had made a point of having tea with his old army squad member, and pointedly ignored the sour glares and sharp comments of Peterson senior.
"Shut up, My..."
hanging from Sherlock's thin frame. He was covered in grime from the warehouse floor, and John had never seen him look less perfect than he did right now, and the familiar flip of his stomach made him sigh. This messed up, imperfect creature was going to be the death of him, because despite the danger, or maybe because of it, John loved him.
signature-".
John carefully pushed the living room door open with his foot, ever wary for pranks, traps, or half finished experiments his lover was prone to leaving about, but the sight that met him almost stopped his heart in his chest
Sliding a nail under the Christmas paper, Dimmock peeled it open like he was diffusing a bomb, and when nothing actually exploded, he tipped the contents out of the open end, onto his desk.
What time are you due back from the lab, Sherlock?
Then again, the one with the return address was the package with Doctor Watson's handwriting all over it...
"Hmm, well we're clearly doing the 'meal and a show' kind of date, and I sincerely hope you know better than to inflict a cinema full of noisy children on me."
The snow had melted days ago, but the temperature was still barely above freezing by the time John had managed to motivate Sherlock into helping him find an appropriate suit for Mycroft's dinner. They'd been through a number of shops, starting with John's choices, at reasonable prices, and they were now in store's Sherlock had chosen where they had been given a starting price and everything that was adjusted to fit the customer was added onto the bill.
Some kind of Butler opened the door, and only Sherlock's hand on the small of his back kept John moving. The dark grey suit Sherlock had gotten made for him made the Doctor feel like something out of a cheesy movie, but he determinedly did not tug at the sleeves, keeping his nerves centred inwards.
John may not be able to deduce a person's history from their car, their love life from their after shave, or their alcoholic sister from their mobile phone, but Sherlock was fast becoming certain that his lover was a pure genius in his own right; even if that genius only seemed to be useful in dealing with Sherlock, or if Sherlock seemed to be the only person who could see it.
No. Make that porn and broccoli stir fry.
The man tensed against his hands and his back straightened, but John simply frowned at the reaction.
That did it. Sherlock laughed suddenly, his whole body rocking as he chuckled, and John couldn't help but grin along with him.
Nearly 30 hours later, John woke up slowly, warm, content, rested, and with a blinding head.
The three men stood silent and Lestrade gaped at them, his eyes flickering between Sherlock's stormy gaze and John's utterly pleased one.
The room was flooded with the noise of people leaving the opera house, but in the bubble surrounding John and Sherlock no sound penetrated their focus on each other except for their own breathing, and the feelings between them that required no words.
Eight... well the photographer could only be one of Mycroft's people now, only they would have come into the flat and photographed the whole fridge filled with milk. They were still over run with the stuff now.
She glided towards the table, moving a few steps ahead of the now scowling Sherlock when she laid eyes on John and her smile was Sherlock's; The same bright grin that the detective gave only to John. The doctor stood without conscious thought, and smiled, kissing the older woman's offered hand and greeting her softly.
remind me of that fact daily.
"Some parade – I spotted it advertised in last weeks paper I hoped we'd be able to get home before it started, but I hadn't planned on the authorities not gritting the streets to slow our progress."
John cut himself off when Sherlock knelt forward and wound his long arms around John's waist, snuggling into his chest like a small child, and burying his face in the Doctor's neck.
I have to disagree Sherlock, but if you're convinced, I'd say practice makes perfect.
"I'm bored Mrs Hudson... and the wall-"
Don't bother then
"Do you know what he's done? Any idea what Mycroft's decided to throw at us... at you! I could kill him, in fact I think I will-"
"Sherlock."
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, "please tell me you didn't get me up and out of the house at eight in the morning on a
It still amazed John sometimes how Sherlock could deduce everything about him, but still struggle when it came to what emotion he was feeling. Sure, sometimes he hit it spot on, but times like this?
"I actually wish I could take credit for this John, its genius, it really is..."
"You would have taken that bullet, John, I know you would have, and I couldn't let you, couldn't let you risk your life for mine..."
The bickering had started. The problem was, Sherlock's theory was correct. Everyone here knew that, whether they wanted to admit it or not.
Sherlock honestly didn't know why he was surprised that his doctor had remembered, but he opened his mouth to thank the man when joining the thousands of diamond glints above the two men came showers of golds, greens and reds with an almighty bang that had the consulting detective gaping in surprise.
