Dean stabbed his food with frustration, "No, I'm the one who attempted a kiss last time, and he's the one that pulled away.  The ball's in his court now.  I think he's just choosing to stay on the bench."
Dean almost cried on the spot at the idea of just being able to stand in hot water for a while and not think about anything.  He started shoving everything into his bag and rushing to get his coat on.  "That is a remarkable idea, princess.  This is why I love ya."  He reached over and held her head in his hands and kissed her forehead.
"No problem, honey.  I'm just so glad you're coming, I don't even care if you're late.  It's only been a month but I miss ya, kid."
Cas let Dean lead him to the middle of the dancefloor where Dean, seeming to be surviving on the adrenaline of the moment, began to dance slightly by moving his shoulders to the beat of the song.  Castiel stepped carefully toward Dean, as Dean picked up the pace a little and grabbed Cas to motivate him to dance too.  Cas finally took the hint and started to move his hips a little bit to the music.  After a while, the two of them were really dancing with the people around them.  Cas continued to take swigs from the bottle, and Dean felt his stomach flip watching Castiel's adam's apple bob as he swallowed.  Dean could see the sweat pouring down his face and neck as he continued to dance, and wow.  Cas was actually a really good dancer.  The two of them sang Mr. Brightside together, or more like, screamed it together and Dean held his breath the few times they accidentally touched hands.
Gabe just cracked a smile and Balthazar commented, "That was quite the show up there, Romeo.  I got pretty choked up myself!"
Dean cleared his throat and changed the subject by ordering, and everyone else followed suit.  Cas ended up ordering a western omelet and toast.  Charlie jotted everything down and then disappeared into the back.
In order to have the group talk to people outside their circle of friends, Chuck separates everyone into groups...by counting off by fours.  Castiel and Dean end up in separate groups for the whole day and Cas ends up making a few friends.  Dean is too busy glaring at one of the relatively attractive ones to make any of his own.
"Yeah, but then I would've looked like a pussy."
Dean's brow furrowed in confusion, "Gone as in...?"
Dean shook his head but giggled, "Welp, that's interesting advice, Cas, but considering the fact that this is your first time, I don't think you'll have any problem getting drunk."  Dean took the bottle back and took a few more gulps before handing it back over and grabbing Castiel's hand. "C'mon, champ!"
Dean heard Cas gasp slightly as Dean nibbled on the spot where his neck met his shoulder, and Dean moved back up to his mouth.  They kissed slowly, but deep as their tongues softly caressed the inside of each other’s mouths.  Dean’s fingers clenched down on Castiel’s tangled hair and Cas made a soft noise in response.  The hand that wasn’t curled around Cas’s hair slid its way down his chest and Dean slid his thumb over Castiel’s nipple, massaging it into hardness and Cas let out another slight whimper.
Had he just winked at him?  What a prick.  Castiel was sure that Hannah must've liked him.  Not only because they were both talented in pissing Castiel off with their quick wit, but also because Dean, by anyone's definition, was a total dreamboat.  Hannah was a pretty girl.  She deserved someone like Dean.
Good.  Music Dean could do.  He knew exactly what to play too.  Dean opened his Spotify and opened up the Mac Miller playlist that he had been building up over the past few weeks.  He had always been a fan of his music, but ever since he found out that he was Cas's favorite, he had been compiling a playlist of just his favorite Mac Miller songs so that he could eventually discuss them with Cas and figure out his favorites.  Even though Dean thought that he would share it with Cas when things were normal between the two of them, he didn't mind sharing earlier.  He knew Cas could use the pick me up.  Dean held his breath and looked over at Cas, who was turning on the water and putting the soap on the sponge, as he hit shuffle and let the first notes of the first song bleed into the kitchen.  Cas turned quickly around with a smile in his eyes as he realized what was being played, and he grinned at Dean before tugging at his bottom lip with his teeth in excitement.
"You said it, brother." Gabriel called over from his chair, staring out into the space ahead of him with a glazed over expression.
"Are you fucking
After a few seconds, Castiel finally released the bottle from his mouth.  "Gabriel always said to drink as much as possible right away when it comes to liquor, so that you can get the nasty part out of the way and then just enjoy being drunk."
would know.  Things would be different between us forever after that."
Castiel barked out a laugh and then smiled at Ellen as Dean rolled his eyes, "Thank you, ma'am."
As soon as he hit town, Castiel could smell it.  Shit.
Gabriel looked back down at Cas like he was an idiot before looking out to Balthazar's door and yelling out, "Hey Baz?  Do you think that Dean and Castiel have fucked yet?"
This is another kind of emotional chapter.  Domestic abuse is discussed again.  Please be aware of this and read with caution.  It will be a little fluffy though, so that's good.  It's also kind of a long one.
"But Dean actually has feelings for me?" Cas asked, his voice soft, almost like a whisper.
That’s when all of a sudden, it hit him.  The song that his Mom used to sing to him and Sam every night before bed.  The song that he kept hidden in the back of his mind ever since she died.
Gabriel turned his eyes back to Dean, "Sorry, my kid brother is a little bit of a stick in the mud.  We are actually going out after this, if you wanna join?"
Dean felt another tear slide in the other tear's path as he looked back into Castiel's eyes.  "I noticed it the first time I met you," Cas continued, "that kind of pain leaves a mark."  Cas was still slurring his words, still drunk.  Dean didn't want to be crying right now.  Castiel was too drunk.  Dean figured that was the only reason they were talking like this.
"Damn right she is." Dean said.
"Bye, baby."
"See?"  Hannah added, "Issa good thing I let him sleep, huh?"
Cas sighed, "You guys don't understand.  I've never done anything like this before.  I don't even know if he actually likes me."  Castiel looked down at this jeans and started to pick at a thread that was poking out at the knee.
Balthazar got up and kissed Castiel on the cheek before he was quickly shoved off.  He looked at Dean and corrected, "You can call me Baz, kitten."
Cas finally stopped laughing and it turned back into small chuckles, "He asked all of us if we 'would please go and support him'".  Cas made finger quotes around his father's words.  Cas scoffed, "Naturally, I declined, and I guess that was the wrong answer.", he mumbled and pointed to his eye.    He looked up at Dean with sad and exhausted eyes.
Right when Dean was one fraction of an inch away from Castiel's lips, Cas pulled back slightly and looked Dean in the eyes, his fingers still pressed to Dean's cheek and swallowed hard before whispering, "See you at the retreat next week."  He turned from Dean and grabbed his bags as he opened the door with his foot and entered his suite.  Dean just stood there, drunk on the smell of Cas that had polluted the air that Dean was breathing, as he watched Cas grin wickedly before closing the door and leaving Dean out there alone.
The song mentioned can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgm9lkTNQmc
"Oh, hello overnight guest!" Benny greeted, charm oozing out of him.  "Who might you be?"
Dean chuckled, "I didn't go to bed until closer to 4 last night, and I still managed to beat you here."
Cas stared at him with unwavering intensity.  Dean seemed a little bit taken aback.  Castiel couldn’t tell if it was because of the question or because of the searing eye contact.  Dean looked at the ground underneath him, and even in the dark, Cas could see his face and ears darken with blush.
Sam chuckled and Cas walked into the living room behind Dean.  That's when Dean noticed that the love of his life was there, sitting on the couch with her legs crossed, and her nose stuck in a book as usual.  His whole body lit up in excitement as he lunged himself forward and jumped on top of Jess, Sam's girlfriend of two years.  She shrieked and giggled, giving him a huge hug as he picked her up and swung her around, her blonde curly hair bouncing off of her shoulders.
bitch, but it's okay.  I know she loves me really." He waggled his eyebrows.
"I'm goinna bed, you better set that alarm boy, you know the rules 'roun here."  And he was gone.  Disappeared into his bedroom with a door slam.
Dean smiled.  Even though he was annoyed at Gabriel for offering this outing without asking, he was glad that he had an excuse to go home.  He missed the smell of his house, and he wanted to see his family.  It had been too long.  "Trust me, I'm glad I'm coming too.  Just prepare yourself.  Two out of three of them are wild cards.  I have no control or responsibility for their actions."
hello friends!! hope you enjoy as always, and sorry about not updating on time.  i am not very organized so i kinda just write when inspiration hits me ya know??
Ellen nodded.  "You betcha, honey."
As promised, Balthazar had left the door opened for Dean to just walk in.  Other than the door being open, the blaring music and laughter he heard coming from the suite helped Dean figured out which one was theirs.  He even thought he heard a girl shriek.  He walked in to find Balthazar dancing like he was at a ball in Cinderella to ACDC, and by himself no less, and Gabriel getting in a food fight with two other girls who were running around and jumping over furniture like they were in a hurdle race.  Castiel was no where to be seen.
"Even though I'm sure you were infuriated at the time, it's probably a good thing he found you when he did." Cas stated.
", Cas spat.  "What the hell did he say to you?"
Hehehe there's smut in this one y'all.  It's been a long time coming.  You are such a wonderful bunch of readers and you deserve this for sticking around for so long.  Love you guys <3 please enjoy the adult content you've been waiting for (:
Dean began to walk away letting his hand linger and slide down Castiel’s arm and down to his hand before turning around and properly walking toward the cabin.  Castiel bit his lip and chuckled as he shook his head.  He had never been so happy before.
Castiel took a deep breath and put his hands in his pockets as they stopped at the corner.  "Well, it was nice to meet you, Dean."  His voice was still deep and even, even standing in the cold.
Gabriel didn't hide his laughter this time.  Instead he howled out a laugh so loud that it rang across their suite as Cas threw his head down on his knees that he had now pulled up to his chest.  Hearing the commotion, Balthazar came out of his room and made his way toward the two of them.  "Hey, Cassie baby!", Balthazar greeted, "Did you enjoy your sexcation?"
Cas finally swung around to another side of a tree and leaned his head against the bark out of exhaustion.  Castiel wasn’t much for running or exercise, and it was catching up with him now.  His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath.  He almost thought he could hear a voice in the distance, but he figured that it must be coming from his racing thoughts.
Ellen just lifted her eyebrow and crossed her arms.
Dean wasn't actually that mad about being on dish duty.  Washing and drying dishes wasn't his favorite thing by any means, but it wasn't the worst job that could be done around the house.  This chore never really made Dean complain.  He was positive everyone at the table except Cas could tell that the only reason he was protesting was because that was a long time to be alone with Cas, and things still were pretty awkward.  Dean knew that Ellen had to have done it on purpose, so that way things may be a little less weird when it was time for them to drive back.  This was not the same though.  At least in the car, Dean had the radio to rely on.
"You said in the theology building, right?" Benny asked
"Who is it?" Bobby muttered the group.
Ellen laughed and then looked back at the two of them, "Alright guys, go on upstairs and get your clothes on.  We're leaving in ten minutes!"  She retreated back upstairs as she let a piece of hair out from her curling iron and tripped a little on the second step.  The boys followed and walked into their rooms.
It took almost no time at all for Dean and Cas to load up the car with their junk before leaving to go back to campus, but it took about 50 million years for the family to say all of their goodbyes, or at least if felt that way to Dean.
Benny laughed a little bit and looked up at Dean still smirking, "Awww, look at the little mama's boy".  Benny reached over to pinch Dean's cheek mockingly.  Dean shoved his hands off.
Cas blushed and smiled coyly.  “Okay, you.  I’ll be in in a minute.”
"Is there anyone else you would want to do it with?"
"Yup, just a few nights ago.  I'm still up on the choppin' block, so maybe you'll be off the hook." she giggled a little and tapped him with her elbow a couple of times.
Dean chuckled, "Sure, huggy bear, what is it?"
Images of his father entered his head involuntarily.  All the family arguments and problems between his father and mother, memories of himself at age 10, promising to himself that he would never put himself in the position to be hurt again for the rest of his life, not for love or money, and the idea of things turning nasty between them flooded his train of thought and he felt it all squirming inside his skin.  Oh, and God forbid it was Cas who broke Dean's heart in the future after all of the horrible things that Dean has been through.  He didn't want to be the cause of more trauma and sadness in Dean's life.  He finally spoke up, and when he did, his voice was broken and sad. "I can't."
Jo clasped her hand on her mouth in surprise and the rest of the table looked at Dean with worried eyes.  Bobby spoke.  "Make sure that boy knows he can stay here as long as he wants."
“Yeah, baby?” Cas answered, letting his hand grab Dean’s as it rested on Castiel’s stomach.
The song mentioned, if you don't already know it, is My Favorite Part by Mac Miller ft. Ariana Grande, which can be found here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8xCOSekog, and streamed on Spotify.  R.I.P Mac Miller.  Also, check out his newly released album, Circles, on Spotify if you're interested.
Charlie had been in the middle of a sip from her coffee when he finally uttered those words, and the sip quickly turned into a surprised spit.  Once Charlie had wiped up her splatters from the counter she looked at Dean with a grin dancing in her eyes, "WHAT?"  She grabbed his arm and started to yank at his sleeve.  "You dog, why didn't you tell me sooner?!  What happened?  How did it go?!  Was it just you two, or was it everyone?  WHY DIDN'T YOU INVITE ME?!"
Cas bit his lip and let out a soft moan as Dean continued to make use of his mouth on the sensitive parts of Castiel’s neck.  “D-Dean we need to go back.  Someone is going to be looking for us s-soon.”
Dean smirked and felt the blush from his cheeks continue down his neck.  He got another message.
Cas had barely realized that he started to walk away from the group and towards the woods as he looked down at his wet and muddy shoes, carrying him to a place to get some air.  Yes, he was already outside and technically didn't really need air, but he needed a place where he could clear his head for a moment.
The family rolled into the parking lot of their favorite diner as they did every Sunday after church, and fell out of the tiny family car like a bunch of clowns arriving at the circus.  They walked as a clan to their normal table in the back, and of course, Dean's best friend and Patrick's Diner waitress extraordinaire, Charlie waited on them as she always does.  She brought them their usual drinks and then went sprinting down across the restaurant.  She had a splash of powdered sugar on her cheek and a pen shoved somewhere in her bun as she rushed around.  "Hello my beautiful Singers!", she called out, "I'll be over to talk in a second!"
Cas just laughed as one tear rolled down his cheek silently.  He sniffled a little.  "No, I don't.  I call her, Mother."  He leaned back over and kissed her on the cheek.
"I was out" he muttered into his cup before taking a swig.
Dean closed his eyes and winced at the intimate act.  He bit his lower lip before answering, "I mean, even if I was going you could have stayed home if you wanted, Cas."
The door opened and Cas turned around to grab his stuff.  "It's no problem, Cas.  I like helping you.  You should never feel bad coming to me for help."  Dean looked into Cas's deep blue eyes and they stayed like that for a minute, before Cas reached across and put a hand on Dean's cheek.
"It's fine, man.", Dean was still smirking, "Keep laughing.  I'll just have to get you back when you least expect it.  I bet you squeal like a pig, Novak."  Dean hadn't realized that he started creeping closer to Cas's face as he spoke.
Hope y'all are healthy and are staying safe.  Just quarantine things am I right?
"What were they like?" Cas's voice was gravely with emotion, "Your parents?"  Dean noticed that Cas had tears in his eyes too, not letting it get the better of him though.
“Mnmh,
Dean nodded, still looking off in the distance, "He definitely would.  Cas is like catnip for him.  The guy's got something for the quiet dorky ones."
Maybe they were worth being friends with, because Dean found himself wondering how he didn't think of that first.
"Right, right." he answered before walking quickly to the stairs.  He turned around as he climbed up them, "Cas, this is my brother's girl Jess.  Jess, this is my friend Cas.  Mingle, I'll be down in a minute."
get drunk if we were there because his uncontrollable urge to mother me even though he is my little brother will never stop, and I believe that it was about time he had some fun."
"You have no idea.  How do you manage to still look great this close to finals?"  Dean froze.  That had just slipped out of him.  He hadn't even thought about it when he said it.
Dean could barely form words as his dick jumped to attention, “H-hey Cas, you don’t have to—"
Cas looked up at him expectantly.  Dean's stomach tied in a knot as Cas stared him down with his baby blues.  Dean shook his head slightly and answered, "You know what, sure.  I'll go with.  Only if my friend here comes too." Dean reached over and slapped Cas on the shoulder.
Dean approached his door with apprehension, not sure whether or not he was hoping that Castiel was still there, or if he was hoping that he wasn't.  He decided to finally bite the bullet after about 5 minutes just standing there and threw the door open and poked his head in, like a little kid who was seeing if his stuffed animals moved while he wasn't there.  Castiel was gone, but there was a note on Dean's desk, written in incredibly beautiful script writing.
Dean smiled as brightly as he could watching Cas giggle the words out and look into Dean's eyes.  Cas's head fell back as the mess of na na na's came out of his mouth and Dean's chest tightened.  He wished he had a camera to capture this moment.
Cas just shrugged and looked around anxiously for a minute before continuing.  "I'm not really.  Neither is Gabriel.  We're honestly better off without him.  He didn't do anything but make mine and my siblings' lives a misery, so."
"I don't even know why I asked," she started, "it was written all over your face when you brought him here.  I mean, shit.  I genuinely thought you were bringing home your boyfriend to meet the family until you told me that you guys were friends."
"It's true" Cas wailed into his lap before throwing his head back up to look at the rest of them, "I totally humiliated myself."
Dean looked up her, his confused look not melting, "What are you guys talking about?"
Cas waited for an explanation patiently.  Eyes continuing to stare into Dean's intensely.  "Him and my mom got in an accident when I was in high school."  A single tear slid down Dean's cheek and landed on the pavement below him.  Dean did not move his eyes.
He was screwed.
"Then I guess that's the question you have to ask yourself, Dean." Jess explained, putting her legs up on the couch and tucking them underneath herself.  "Which are you more willing to live with?  Are you more willing to live with things staying the way they are, leaving you unknowing and suffering, but keeping the relationship you have with him the same?  Or would you prefer the possibility of rejection but finally having some clarity?"
Thanks guys!
There she was.  Castiel's twin sister, Hannah.  She was smiling ear to ear and jumping up and down.  Castiel smirked and he felt his heart melt a little.  He popped open the door to a squealing shriek and a big hug as he stated, "Little by 2 minutes, smart ass."  He hugged her back as she practically climbed up him.  She definitely looked a little older than she had the last time he'd seen her, and it worked for her.  That's when he noticed a little sparkle on her ear, glistening in the fading sunlight.
As promised, Sam and Bobby ended up getting the address from Cas and bringing the truck back to the Novak house.  Bobby just tossed the keys in the mail box on the porch, knowing that he wouldn't be able to control himself if Cas's dad ended up being in their still.  They were able to stop by Balthazar's house too, where Gabriel was waiting with a bag of Castiel's clothes and toiletries so he had everything he needed to go back to school with.  Bobby of course offered to bring Gabriel back with them.  Gabriel declined, saying that it wasn't the first time he had to run away to Balthazar, and it wouldn't be the last.
As the first few chords of the song flew out of Chuck’s guitar, Dean’s whole body broke out in chills and he focused all his attention on trying not to burst into tears in front of all these strangers as he sang the first few verses.
"Damn, I really hope that the organist is sick today." Dean grumbled.  "That shit always seems to drive right through my ear drums and into my soul."
Cas laughed again.
Dean’s mouth moved further down and his tongue swirled around on the salty skin of Cas’s neck.  “Mhm?”
Dean's chest tightened in appreciation as he just turned his head slightly to Cas and smiled, acknowledging the comment without showing Cas all of the feelings running through his head at that moment.
The Philadelphia Story was an old one.  So old in fact, that it was in black and white, and came out before the end of WWII.  Cas said it was a classic, but Dean hadn't seen this one either.  It was about a rich woman who had been divorced but was marrying a new man, that no one in her family seemed to like.  She assumed it was because he was poor, but it was actually because he could tell he didn't really love her for her.  The movie completely moved Dean.  He'd never seen a movie like it before.  It was a beautiful commentary about what it means to really love someone instead of just idolizing them, what it meant to be vulnerable and allow yourself and others to be just that.
Benny rolled his eyes and walked over to Dean, dropping his order of dumplings and general tso chicken next to his head before sliding a chair over to sit next to him.  Dean finally picked his head up to open his food containers, eyes still sunken in from lack of sleep.
"Oh relax, man, it's not like I care!" he assured Dean, "In fact, I'm fucking thrilled!  It's about time my baby bro got some dick.  Especially when the person attached to the dick looks like a Ken doll."
"They like coming to the class to pick fun at me and annoy the professor, they don't actually need to be here.  I guess actual community service is where they decided to draw the line." Cas said.
"Shut it.", Dean grumbled before following Cas upstairs to his room.  He could hear the two of them snickering as he did.
Cas's eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in a kind of smile before he moved the faucet back over to face the sink and laughed his ass off.  "I'm so sorry Dean," he managed to get out between barks of loud laughter, "but that was definitely worth hearing your little mousey scream."  Cas threw his head back in another fit of laughter.
Cas reached his hand underneath the table dividing them as they sang along with the group, and grabbed Dean's hand.  Castiel's eyes were filled with nothing but appreciation and warmth.  Dean squeezed his hand and winked back.  They stayed like that for a while, holding hands under the table and looking into each other's eyes.  Gabriel and Balthazar were too busy playing air guitar and dramatic fake drum solos to notice.  Or maybe, they were just pretending not to notice to give them some time to appreciate the moment together.
"Wow, Cas, I think you might be taking my spot as the favorite." Dean said, his eyebrows raised.
Dean and Cas finally get some much need alone time.
Dean squeezed Cas's hand, "C'mon, Cas.  Let's get you inside.  We can go to the back porch and talk about this, so you don't have an audience."
"Who is Benny?" Gabe asked almost immediately after Baz finished.
Dean rolled his eyes at himself, knowing full well what answer he should give.  He should say no.  He should say he needs to go home and study.  But who was he kidding, of course he was going to go watch movies with Cas.  "Okay, Cas."
Ellen took his face in her hands and replied, "Don't call me ma'am, sweetheart.  I'm officially your Mama now."
Suddenly, as if the big man himself was watching down on this shit show of a conversation, the bus's speakers started to rumble with incredibly loud Christian rock songs.  The entire bus groaned in complaint before Chuck stood at the front of the bus, looking pissed.
"I can't believe they finally caved"
Dean could do nothing but laugh as Cassie grabbed Gabriel's shirt and pulled him down to his level, "Will you not rest until you have embarrassed yourself to the maximum capacity?"
Dean just started at Gabriel while he let that information sink in.  Baz interrupted his train of thought.  "What?  You were scheming without me?  You bastard, how can I ever forgive you?"
Gabriel arched an eyebrow and then slid down the wall next to the door to sit next to Cas, handing him a beer.  Cas smiled and thanked him before opening it to take a sip when Gabe asked, "Did you finally put Dean's dick in your mouth and now you feel weird about it?"
The pet name just seemed to slip out of Dean without him even thinking about it.  Jesus.  A few kisses and he was suddenly turning into a lovesick puppy.  He hoped that Cas didn't notice or would just act like he didn't to save Dean some embarrassment.  Cas closed his eyes for a minute and took a deep breath before looking down at Dean and nodding curtly.  Dean smiled again and took a couple steps back, reaching his arms up to Cas and nodding reassuringly as Cas made eye contact with him.
"Why did you feel the need to stage that whole thing?" Dean asked, surprise still hanging on inside his chest.
Dean chewed on some of his pork fried rice as he thought about this.  He knew it seemed petulant but, it kind of sounded like a good plan to him.  It's definitely way less embarrassing than the emotional heart to heart, and possible rejection alternative.
Dean started to kiss his cheeks, his nose, his eyelids, and Cas managed to mumble out, “Dean, please.”
"You better get off this phone then, boy.  Get in there.  Didn't you say that today is your community service day?" Ellen asked.
The whole table went quiet, and no one dared make eye contact with another person.  No one had the heart to tell him that Bobby and Ellen didn't actually count as his parents.  No one had the heart to say it in front of Bobby and Ellen, though Dean was sure they were thinking it too.
Castiel smiled and pulled his hand back before swatting Balthazar's hand off of Dean's.  "This is my brother Gabriel," Cas pointed out, "and his friend Balthazar."
The bible camp lyric almost made me choke on my food it was so hilarious, and as someone who has been to "bible camp" or as we called it, "God camp", I can promise you that shit like that happens lmao.
"Brilliant.  Come over here.  It's only fair you take care of the problem you helped create.  I'll leave the suite door open so you can just walk in.  Fourth floor, babe."  Balthazar hung up.
The whole classroom groaned.  Chuck rolled his eyes and gestured to the three clipboards in front of him, silently asking everyone to come down and pick.  Castiel stood up and Dean followed, leaning into Cas's space and asking, "So, which one are we going for, champ?"
ACDC whispered to the other two in a way that almost sounded like a growl, "I cannot
He had been fumbling back and forth with the idea for a few days now, and his friend Kelly who lived across the hall was trying to talk him out of it.
Gabriel took a big sigh and then placed his hand on Castiel's.  "You're my little brother.  I've known you your whole life, so I know what you're thinking."
Cas nodded slightly, taking in all that Dean had to say, looking at him in the eyes with that same knowing look that he had shown Dean in the car those weeks ago.  Dean took a leap and kept talking, feeling exposed, but still safe.  "Jess came over every night with dinner for us.  Every night.  She would go grocery shopping with Ellen, would drive Bobby to work when they had to sell Bobby's car in order to compensate for the newfound expense that Sam and I brought to the house, and she just listened.  She listened to me, Sam, Jo, and everyone else in our house.  Because we were all uprooted from our lives and shuffled together like a new deck of cards in a poker game for the first time.  She had this way of making us all feel heard and valid without allowing us to wallow in self-pity.  She just got it."  Dean could feel his tears poking into his eyes, "I'll never be able to repay her for all she did for us.  She's a Winchester-Singer through and through."
Dean shuddered at the idea of alcohol even looking at him tonight, let alone actually drinking.  He was way too exhausted, and way too stressed out for all of that tonight.  "Oh my god, there is absolutely no way I could go out tonight.  I would rather die."
Castiel finally forced himself to look up at his mother to find a sliver of tears in both of her eyes.  Her mouth was open slightly, and then she finally spoke softly, "Castiel".
"In all honesty," Baz chimed in, "It's probably because he doesn't think Cas likes him.  I mean damn, Cas.  You're really making the poor boy work his ass off."
Dean followed her as he stumbled trying to put on his dress shoes at the same time, "HEY!  Can you use your own stuff for once?"
Dean heard Cas chuckle as Cas reached forward and clutched Dean's hand in his own.  Dean's heart seemed to double in size, and he continued.  "She was never afraid to tell him what was what, even though he always seemed to scare me shitless.  And they laughed, like all the time.  They were always pulling pranks on each other and driving each other crazy.  But damn, they were in love.  When I was little, I asked my mom why she chose to marry my Dad, just because I had seen my first romantic comedy and was curious about how it worked in real life."
The people coming in to attend the class seemed normal enough.  Dean wondered what it was that made them decide to come back and do this.  Maybe the same reason he was there.  There were about ten of them sitting there, himself included, and Dean put his feet up on the desk to make himself comfortable before the lecture started.
"  They honestly sounded like a gospel choir, and a good one at that.  Dean spun around on the pole in the middle of the bus and sang the next line alone, for it to be followed back by his new found back up singers, and Dean gestured to Cas playfully the whole time, with a big goofy smile on his face.  As if he could ever even pretend to be into anyone else.
Castiel scoffed, just as willing as Dean to move past the horribly awkward moment they had just experienced, "Don't forget our fearless and wimpy leader."
, back.
"Gold star" Dean said, "You would think they were your family, Cas."
"Not usually" he answered, "In fact, it's usually quite the opposite.  With women I like the ones who are feisty and outgoing, and usually the guys I go for are quippy and flirty.  Cas is different.  He's thoughtful and serious, and he actually sees people all at once, not just as someone to talk to or someone to entertain him.  He's smart.  He's smarter than almost anyone I've ever met, but not in a way that makes you feel like you're stupid.  He just gets it.  People, concepts, everything."
Dean lifted his head once more to give Cas a quick kiss on the lips and then stood up, putting his hand out to Cas to help him stand up himself.
“Son of bitch, Cas.”, he muttered under his breath, “Don’t get eaten by a bear, please.”
Cas's face blushed underneath him and his breath became staggered.  Dean quickly licked his bottom lip to moisten it when he heard Ellen's voice.
“CAS?!” He yelled out into the abyss of dark tall trees in front of him.  The loud music and laughter coming from their campsite reassured Dean that there was no way anyone over there could hear him yelling.
He decided to take his sweet time getting ready anyway, knowing full well that it didn't matter how late he was at this point.  He was going to be late no matter what, so he might as well milk it while he could.  He took his time in deciding what to wear, and went with his trusty pair of jeans that he's owned since he was 14.  They were holy and gross, to be perfectly honest, but he didn't care.  It's not like any of his clothes ever got to live long without being ruined around here.  He wasn't even sure why he packed, he realized, since he wouldn't dare wear any of his school clothes around the farm.  That is, if he ever wanted to wear them on campus again.
"Just do it, just shove him down on his fuckin' knees and shove the dick into the mouth.  I know you have it in you man, I was pretty sure you were gonna go for it like two hours ago.", they talked over one another.
Dean laughed a little bit out of love for his friend, regardless of the disheartening feeling that was creeping over him at the lack of text from Castiel.  Benny was already off studying with one of his friends, so he wasn't there to see Dean off, but before he left he made sure to remind him of what to look for after the flirting operation had begun.  Dean took a deep breath and tried to get himself in the confident flirting zone quickly before leaving the room to get Baz his coffee.
Sam rolled his eyes and glared at Dean, "Are you serious, Dean?"
"He still hasn't tried to get a hold of you, huh?" Benny asked, watching Dean inhale his dinner.
"Yeah", Dean replied stupidly.
?" Dean stammered, directing his words at his friend, standing in the doorway rather than answering Bobby.
Dean jumped and his heart stopped in surprise, "Jesus, Jess!", he griped, "I thought someone broke in!"
They walked into the common area and Dean answered, "Oh, nothing.  Jess just sent me a picture of the family."
"Wait" she started, separating from him, "I thought you said you were bringing three people?"
Benny looked up at the ceiling and then at the floor, "Well, at least you didn't wake up, right?"
Dean breathed out a small chuckle and took out his phone to call Gabe.  Voicemail.  He tried Balthazar too.  Voicemail.  They were either out and about too, or they were sleeping.  Either way, there was no way he was getting a hold of them.  He decided to text Gabriel and let him know that he was going to bring Cas to his room to sleep tonight.  He texted Benny the same thing.  As Dean was doing this, Cas leaned over and touched Dean's cheek bone and smiled, still swaying, "You have-" hiccup "-so many freckles", Cas giggled.
Cas and Balthazar had ran back to the two of them.  Balthazar grabbed Gabe and Cas grabbed Dean as they hauled him both up.  "You two are going to kill yourselves one of these days." Cas chuckled.  He slinked his arm around Dean's torso to help him walk.  "I think that will be fun!  I would love to meet your family."
"Fuck off." he spat before taking a final drink from his cup before chucking into the garbage.
Cas looked at Dean fondly and squeezed his hand a final time before Charlie came over with the food.  It seemed to break the family's emotional trance, and business carried out as usual.  People started talking over each other and arguing about stupid things, but laughing and joking too.
Charlie smiled at Dean and didn't talk.  Dean got lost in his own thoughts about Castiel until he remembered where he was, who he was with, and how long he had been quiet for.  He looked up with urgently, face heating up in embarrassment and looked back at Charlie, who was still smiling at Dean, dreamily.
“Dean Winchester, the floor is yours.”
Cassie raised an eyebrow and mouthed something that Dean didn't quite hear.  Realizing that he was acting like a total idiot, Dean shoot his head and responded, "W-What?"
Castiel pulled him closer so his mouth was against his ear, "Your roommate is hot."
"Love you too" Dean replied as he hung up the phone.  He took one final deep breath and gave himself a mental pep talk before walking back in.
Cas's eyes widened to three times their original size and Gabe just closed his eyes as his mouth folded into a thin line.  After a few moments of tense silence and Cas staring at Gabe as if he had crushed one of Cas's CD's, Gabe finally opened his eyes and looked at Castiel like a child who just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.  "Guess the cat's out of the bag", he muttered.
Dean collapsed lightly on the beautiful boy underneath him and sighed into his chest.  He knew Cas was right, and being caught by Chuck mid make out session would definitely scar both of them forever.  He could feel through his jeans that Cas was really enjoying where they were going and Dean had been rocking a similar situation ever since he started to tickle Cas, but he supposed they would survive going back to the activities now.
He looked down at Cas who had closed his eyes and laid his head back against the floor, chuckling softly.
After a while, Cas gathered up the saliva in his mouth and continued to move down Dean’s shaft inch by inch, swirling his tongue around and pulling up just a bit every few seconds, just to move back down again.  Cas tried to move down all the way, but as soon as Dean’s cock hit the back of his throat, he felt his gag reflex start to hitch.  He pulled up quickly and moved his hand to the base so Dean’s dick was covered.  Cas started to bob his head as he heard Dean speak breathlessly.
Dean's heart stopped.  If Cas could only know.
There was no way he was going to get away with a lie though.
"Yes I do!  I had no idea you were coming to meet the tribe today.  How are they treating you?" She looked like someone had just told her that she won the lottery.
"Didn't your father say the same thing to you about school?"
Dean normally save this kind of behavior for when he allowed himself to really get into the darker and more controlling part of his sexual preferences, but with Cas panting beautifully underneath his hand, Dean couldn’t manage to think before he acted.
"Ugh, don't be such a wuss- MA, POP, LOOK WHO I HAVE."
Dean reached up and placed a hand around Cas's ankle in attempt to soothe him. His fingers glided along the inside of Castiel's pant leg and he rubbed his thumb against his ankle joint.  "Cas," he repeated, keeping his voice low and even, "I promise.  I'm already grabbing you and my feet are flat on the ground.  I just need you to let go a little bit, alright baby?"
have an actual reason to stay here.  Your father's a pig.  All I have facing me is just a little family drama.  I'll be okay, bean."
Cas grinned at Dean wickedly as he closed his suite door, his bags in hand.  Once it was shut, Cas's grin turned into a shy smile as he turned around, looked down at the ground, and slid down the door slowly until he was squatting and picturing the look he had left on Dean's face.  His cheeks were getting warm as he felt a blush creep from his neck up to his face as the butterflies danced around in his stomach.  Dean was so cute.  No matter how casually Cas acted around Dean, he knew that Dean was the cutest boy that he had ever met in his life.  Every minor expression, smile, and detail on Dean's face was like kryptonite to Cas, and it was all Cas could do to keep himself from curling himself up into Dean's chest and hanging on for dear life.
"About 2 am", she answered, "My trig test is going to kill me before I even take it."
Cas opened the passenger side door and sat down with a smile, "Good morning, Dean."
That’s when it hit him.  He stopped walking and stilled his movements completely.  He wouldn’t be able to hear anything while he was tromping around.  The noises of the snow, sticks, and his heavy footsteps would keep him from hearing anything lower than a yell.  Dean took a deep breath as he stilled, and closed his eyes.
"They're under the weather this morning." Cas responded.  Dean thought about it for a minute.  He believed that Gabe could be too hungover, but Baz wasn't that drunk last night.  Seeming to sense Dean's confusion, Cas explained further.  "They're not hungover.  I guess it's the stomach flu or something?  They said that they had been puking ever since they got back last night, but I didn't hear them at all."
Cas sighed, "It sounds like he was a very honorable man."  He smiled and squeezed Dean's shoulder as he stood up and got himself a cup of water.
Dean scowled at Benny, "He's a friend of mine.  He's insanely drunk and is staying here because he doesn't have his ID.  Keep it in your pants.", Dean sighed, "and put your fucking shirt on."
“If you’re
Dean finally recognized the song.  It was a great song, he was just surprised he was hearing it here.  Dean let himself fall into the moment and looked right back at Cas, continuing to the next lyric and dipping him over his knee, "
Dean looked over at him and laughed as he took his wrist and started pulling him forward to start the walk home.  "Wow, you're wasted"
Castiel was peaking his head out a little from the corner to look at the stranger, who had a hand over his chest, seemingly as startled as Castiel felt.
"Well I-"
"Balthazar, turn around before I stab the both of you." Cassie bit.
Can you tell I'm a fan? :)
"Oh, Cas, it looks like you got something on your face there", Dean teased as he reached forward to capture a droplet rolling off of Cas's hair and onto his cheek in between his fingers.  Cas's dark hair now looked even darker now that it was wet, and was matted down to his forehead, how Dean like it, weirdly.
Cas continued to look at his fingers, trying to get a hang nail off of his pointer finger, "He's with Balthazar.  He only lives two doors down from us.  I didn't want to go there though, I don't know.  I don't know why I'm here.  I just got in the car and drove until I found myself here, looking at you in the doorway."
Gabriel looked at him with sad eyes.  Knowing how Dean was feeling, but not enough to for Cas to notice.  Cas probably would have noticed if he hadn't been sick or if he wasn't too busy dying of embarrassment.  Dean shook his head quickly, letting Gabe know that it was fine, even though it wasn't really.
"If you said you live in Belington, you must have to take a left here, right?" Castiel asked, pointing just a few feet ahead of them.
Jess pushed his shoulder playfully, "Then cough it up, Winchester.  I won't ask again."
"I was gonna say, 'that's what she said', but I think that reaction just about covers it." Balthazar commented, a huge shit eating grin on his face.
Gabriel smiled at him and bowed, "Though I appreciate your skills, my lovely Baz, I knew you wouldn't be able to resist dropping in on Cas getting drunk for the first time.  I was looking for an intimate moment and I knew that you weren't going to be able to make it through."
good, baby.”, Dean moaned, “Fuck, Cas,
Hannah shrugged with her typical shit eating grin, "They didn't.  I went one night and just did it."
Dean ended up being dragged out of his weightless feeling but Chuck clearing this throat loudly.  His head snapped back at the professor, who's eyes were full of sympathy and pity.  A look that he got incredibly good at deciphering after seeing it for years after his parent's deaths.  "It's so heartwarming to see that a religious song can bring so much emotion out in you, Dean.  It truly is touching."  Chuck reached his arm out to lay his hand on Dean's shoulder.
Dean just chuckled.  It was honestly on him for assuming she would accept an answer like that in the first place.
Dean ogling was disrupted by the song ending and Cas grabbing his hand and twirling him around underneath his reach.  Dean's breath was taken away in surprise.  The tone of the music had changed dramatically, to a funky and smooth song that Dean didn't recognize right away.   Once Dean had turned completely under Cas's hand, he was being pulled into Cas's chest and both of his hands were laced in Castiel's, as Cas started gently dancing along to the music with him.  Cas's shoulders were going back and forth in beat with the music, tugging Dean's arms forwards and backwards with it.  Cas had his eyes closed, really feeling the music before twirling Dean again.  Dean's heart could've exploded.  That's when Cas leaned in and sang the first lyric to Dean, just inches from his face, "
They arrived at Patrick's Diner and ended up sitting somewhere different than normal, in order to have enough room for everyone that had come that day.  Dean walked Cas through the menu, telling him what was good and what wasn't worth trying.  Charlie came walking up to their table with the normal drinks for everyone when she realized that Cas was sitting there too.
Dean looked over to Cas, who was still staring at him.  Dean lifted half of his mouth up into a sort of acknowledgement without smiling fully.  Cas opened his mouth to say something when Chuck's voice came from the other side of the group.
"You two are
“Beautiful choice, Dean.  Do you need the lyrics out?” Chuck asked, seemingly unaware that Dean was getting emotional.
Dean followed Cas to a different section of clothes and folded next to him.  "We'll see if a hangover will really make my chemistry class more interesting."
Dean arrived back to his room around 7:45.  He had stopped to get dinner for Benny and himself because he received a whiney text from his roommate just as he was passing the take out dining hall.  He got Benny four soft tacos and himself a burrito bowl.  He threw the bag of food on Benny's desk in front of him and slid his flannel off in one slick movement before face planting on his bed.
Gabe groaned unnecessarily loud and rolled his eyes to the ceiling, "Are you really gonna act like I haven't noticed all of this eye fucking and awkwardly romantic silences, when I'm around you two almost
Dean smiled and felt all of the tension in his chest slip away, "Hey mama.  I miss you."  Which was true.  He wanted a hug from her, bad.
"Too bloody late", Baz whispered.
"I told John he should have you do it when the time came, but I guess he just never got around to enrolling you  into religious ed." Bobby explained.
”, Castiel cut off as Dean pressed his thumb against Cas’s slit and slathered his precum down his pulsing dick.
Dean swallowed his conscience and decided he was in.
Dean's heart dropped.  He pulled back and Castiel's hand fell.  Cas fluttered his eyes shut and curled into Dean's pillow.  Dean stared at him with sadness in his eyes.  He looked over at Benny with fury.
Dean exhaled long and loud and squeezed Jess.  He was glad he was home too, but he was a little bit put out about it too.  His mind raced back to the text he had received a few minutes ago before he was seconds away from knocking out his brother's girl friend, his mood changing from hyperaware and ready to fight, back to the mopey and disheartened feeling he had before this whole misunderstanding.
He started to stutter and shift his eyes quickly from his new spot on the ground to a quick look up at Cas.  “I-I really did mean it, but if you didn’t y-ya know, i-if you didn’t really mean it then, we can just act like it didn’t happen and I--”
He chose a seat at the back of the room and shifted in his seat as he waited for the class to get started.  He looked at the people who seemed to be the instructors at the front of the classroom.  They were putting refreshments at the table separating the teacher's desk from the student desks.  There was a small man who seemed to be in charge.  He had stubble and looked like he hadn't slept in a few days, at least, not well anyway.  He had a quivering and squeaky voice and he thought he heard someone call him Chuck.  The others finished helping Chuck put out the food and drinks before going to their own classrooms.  There was apparently more than one section of this course, which Dean figured were different age groups.
Dean looked at Bobby sincerely and nodded quickly, before slinging his duffle bag over his shoulder and walked down the porch steps to meet Cas in the car.  He beeped a few times as he pulled away, Cas waving his hand out the window to his family with a smile.
Dean opened his closet to find his dress shirts organized and ironed perfectly.  Evidence that Ellen had once again struggled to let Dean's room remain a mess.  He chuckled at his lovable control freak as he chose the light blue shirt and grabbed his black dress pants as well.  He heard a small knock on his door and told whoever it was to come on in since he was decent still.  Sam opened the door and Dean looked down to see Sam in his church clothes with his tie wrapped around his neck like a scarf.  Sam shut the door again behind him and asked defeated, "Can you do my tie, please?"
His father had just nodded and said, "Well, it'll be more beneficial to have an extra husband around here than an extra wife."  So, his father was slightly sexist, but not homophobic.  Nice to know.
Cassie handed the paper to him and rolled his eyes, "Jesus don't tell me that you're drunk too."
Balthazar laughed next to him and pulled him into a side hug, "You are such a little ham, Winchester."
Cas bit his lip and looked around, avoiding eye contact.  Finally, he muttered out, “I’m really ticklish, okay?”
Cas's eyes darted over to Dean's in shock.  Dean looked right back at him with a smile and began to sing louder.  Cas shook his head and smiled back before joining Dean in song with the radio station.  The entire bus turned to look at them in silence.  The music seemed to get louder, either by Chuck or the bus driver, and the two of them began on the next line, just looking at each other with smiles the size of their whole faces.  "
Dean swallowed hard.  Cas and him had become more comfortable with one another but, it was getting harder to pretend he wasn't feeling anything for the guy.  Dean was torn between being glad that they were getting along and hanging out more, and wishing that they could go back to Cas just being around him at religious ed and talking to him occasionally.  Dean loved spending time with Cas and talking to him, but being able to appreciate and be interested in Cas from a far was easier and safer.  Ever since that day with his family, the aching feeling of want and pining was starting to become too much.
Dean leaned in and kissed him a few more times.  His breath tasted like peppermint and chocolate and Dean just wanted to pull Cas in tight and hold him.  "I'm sorry I just ran in here.  I hope you don't think I was mad at you.  I was just so tired of watching that male model flirt with you shamelessly."  Castiel looked up at him with sympathetic eyes, "It was babyish and stupid, and I'm sorry."
For fun I did the Myers Briggs personality test for our two mains and Castiel got INFJ and Dean got ESFP in case you were wondering lol.
It was another few hours before anyone would be home, so Dean took this opportunity for alone time by face planting on his bed.  He buried his nose deep in his pillow case, reacquainting himself with the feel and smell of his home, letting all of the exhaustion and stress from the semester dissipate from being wrapped in the comfort of his own space after so long.  He was a few moments from letting himself slip into a nap when he heard his phone vibrate on his bedside table.  He debated just ignoring it, but just in case it was something important he decided to reach his hand up and see what it was.
Dean walked in the house and he was hit instantly with the smell of pine and vanilla.  The family had bought the Christmas tree.
Hearing Cas’s sweet little noises was doing something for Dean, his surroundings melting away, and Cas being the only thing on his mind.  He went on to the corner of his mouth, then his cheek, then his ear, and then slowly took Castiel’s lobe into his mouth and bit down.
He just repeated Gabriel's words over and over again in his head, trying to convince himself that Dean was good, that they wouldn’t end up like his parents.  That this was exciting and real and that Dean hadn’t been emotionally manipulating him or lying about his true feelings a few minutes ago.  He wanted to take this time to be excited and giddy, like he should be, but the fears found ways to creep back into his mind.
He looked Dean in the eyes, remembering what Balthazar told him as he let his tongue peek out and glide along the prominent vein from tip, to base, back up to the tip.  He saw Dean’s breath catch in his chest as Dean’s head fell back.  Good sign.
Dean's face melted into an expression of compassion and he slung his arm around Cas's shoulders in an attempt to block him from the wind as he brought him inside.
Cas was quiet for a while as he watched Dean work, his expression full of adoration.  Of course, Dean didn't see, because his back was turned trying to fluff the pillows, but it was happening regardless.  "Thank you.", Cas finally croaked out.
"I mean, I would choose Dean, but he obviously isn't confirmed.  He can't."
Then suddenly, there was his street sign.  Magnolia Lane, clear as day.  The ease and familiarity that Castiel had been feeling only seconds prior to this moment, were replaced with a twinge in his gut and sweating palms.  You'd think in the 12 hour ride he would have been able to shake off the uneasy feeling he'd been rocking almost the entire way, but no.  He was just as unsure and uncomfortable as he had been when he waved goodbye to Kelly and drove out of Boston.
"I don't know, my dear friend, he's your brother.", Baz replied.
Cas pushed his lips into a thin line but did not manage to hide the smile spreading on his face regardless.  Before Dean could even see him do it, Cas reached over and grabbed the sponge from off the counter and squished it into Dean's shirt.  Dean felt the hot water slide down his chest and chills covered his forearms.  Dean squeaked again and took off running to the other side of the kitchen table.  Cas darted his feet to chase after Dean with the sponge in his hand, when his feet slipped on the water pooling up underneath him from Dean's splash.  He hit the ground with a thud and didn't move.
Dean looked up urgently and kicked Gabe in the shin, making him fall over too, "Are you crazy?!" Dean scream whispered.  "What the hell are you doing?"
Cas shook his head, "Not at all".
Dean smiled at Cas and wiped his face before leaning up on his elbows and grabbing the hand that Cas had left on Dean's.  "You are incredibly drunk, man."  Dean let himself chuckle, "Why don't we get you home?"  Dean stood up and leaned his arm down to lift Cas up.
Castiel woke up surprisingly slowly and naturally the next morning, suspicious of how well rested he felt.  Even though he'd grown up in this house and had to wake up at 4:30 am every morning of his life, it never got easier.  Ever.  So why was he waking up on his own, after months of waking up only when he felt like it?
"You should really whisper Cassie-kinz or we're gonna get yelled at" Gabriel answered with glee.  Cassie let go of his shirt and turned toward the professor.
The four of them ended up going out together almost every weekend.  Now that Cas was comfortable with drinking and was more familiar with the college party scene, Gabriel was ready to have the whole group go with them, instead of just Cas going with Dean.  Cas still was tempted every now and again to ask Gabriel to slow down or be careful, but now that Gabriel had the ammunition of Cas's previous alcohol mishap, he wasn't afraid to remind Cas of it and call him a hypocrite.  They were a good team of drunks.  Castiel kept silent tabs on all of them, Baz made everything more fun, Gabe could always get them free booze no matter where they were, and Dean was an excellent wing man.  Having been burnt by Balthazar's sexual history with the first guy he flirted with, Castiel was too scared to actually admit interest in or flirt with anyone else, and quite honestly, Dean was okay with that.  Helping Cas get laid was something he wasn't ready for yet.  He wanted Cas to be happy, sure, but he wasn't so content in his spot in the friendzone that he was ready to advertise Cas to the highest bidder.  The only guy Dean really had to worry about for the time being was Baz, who always managed to start flirting with Cas
Shit.  Dean was so surprised by Cas being alone that he had forgotten.  He couldn't leave.  "Yeah", he muttered.
Castiel wished he didn't think it was as hot as he did.
The small guy snorted, "Can you not hit on my little brother for like," he paused to hiccup, "two seconds?"
Suddenly the two girls had vanished and it was just Dean and Castiel, standing and staring at each other.
Dean threw up his hands in defiance, "What?  But mama, it's my last night home!"
Zachariah stepped toward him slowly.  Almost like a drill sergeant checking out his recruits.  He looked Castiel up and down.  Castiel swallowed and tried to look forward.
Castiel chuckled, "Yeah only in my dreams"
“B-but I sang on the bus.  Can’t that count?” Dean pleaded
Dean heard the door close down stairs and then looked at his phone to see what time it was.  It was only 10:30 in the morning, so he didn't know who it could be.  Everyone was either at work or school.  He reached over to the side of his desk to the baseball that he kept there and picked it up slowly before tip toing out of his room and down the stairs.  He held the bat up to his shoulder and held his breath, trying to be as quiet as possible.  Whoever it was, he could hear them walking into the kitchen, and a few soft thuds.  Dean continued down the stairs, his palms sweating against the wood of the bat and his breath quickening in anticipation.
Cas giggled like a child, eyes still on Benny.  Benny winked as he slid his shirt on and Cas blushed. "Alright, brother." Benny answered before jumping onto his own bed.
It took a little bit longer than it should have because a few puke breaks had to be taken, but they eventually made it to Dean's room.  Dean now had his arm snaked under Cas's arms to keep him walking and Cas was leaning most of his weight into him.  Dean didn't mind.  Dean pushed the door open and found Benny taking his shirt off and getting ready for bed.  He had just got home from a party too.  Dean could smell the whiskey he had been drinking.
Cas took his hands down from his eyes slowly and then pulled his arms into his chest.  "It's nothing", he replied.
Jess was only gone for about 10 minutes.  When she returned she grabbed two Caprisuns and slammed herself on the couch with Dean and let him open up to her about what had been going on.  He told her about the tequila, the crying, the too long glances, the dancing, the singing, the car rides, the movies, the texts, the conversations, and the snowflakes.  He even told her about the Benny scare.  Once he finished laying it all out for her, she smiled and leaned over to put her arm around Dean, pulling him towards her and then rubbing his arm quickly to comfort him.
Dean put his water bottle, which was filled on his nightstand next to Cas's head along with a packet of Advil.  He kneeled down next to the bed and looked at Cas, "Feel free to take and drink what you need, Cas.  You're gonna have a wicked hangover tomorrow, so you might want to get a head start."
The three of them seemed to make everything more fun.  Dean wished that he could smuggle them into his art history course.  Without fail, drunk or sober, Gabriel and Balthazar never ceased to make things interesting during the religious ed classes.  Cas was almost always annoyed with their behavior, but the more classes they went to, the more lenient he became.  Dean thought that maybe Castiel was just saving his energy in hopes that the two of them would just get kicked out of the course for acting like buffoons the whole time.  Somehow though, Chuck never seemed to notice their shenanigan's.  Either that, or Chuck just chose to ignore them.
Cas was now looking at Dean with a questioning expression.  I guess it made sense that he found it strange.  Most people weren't completely enamored with their brother's girlfriend like Dean was.  Cas didn't really get a chance to know Jess since she was one more likely to sit and observe him amongst others than to engage him on her own.  Kind of like Cas, actually.
"Jesus Christ, dude." Dean blinked in surprise.
, press against Castiel’s hardening cock.
"I miss you too, kid.  Jo and Sam are at each other's throats lately I-", she was interrupted by a loud crash.  Dean could hear Jo and Sam squabbling.  "Hang on a second, honey."
Dean could feel his cheeks warm up so he refused to look at Benny and instead broke into his dinner for the evening, "No", he lied.
Castiel was quiet for a while.  When he finally spoke, he sounded distant.  "We were all just coming home from seeing my great aunt, and he was just sitting in our living room.  He has a beard now.  It looked nice on him.  He never really had a strong jaw line so, the beard was a good choice."
Thank you to everyone who leaves comments.  It really makes me smile when I get them.
"You and Sam?"
The next twenty minutes of the course were spent explaining what confirmation was all about, why they were doing it, the explicit steps they had to take, and when they were expected to do each of them.  "You are all going to be spending a lot of time together during these next few months.  We will be doing a lot of spiritual reflection, team building exercises, and community service together, so I want to give you this time to get to know the people around you, so you're more comfortable throughout this process."
Cas sped up even more as Cas felt Dean’s balls start to clench and he knew that Dean’s orgasm was building.
Cas smiled at her and then went back to folding.  After a few seconds, Bela spoke up.  "Hey, we're actually going to a house party that my friend is throwing after this.  You guys should come."
"Hey Cas, where are the other two monkeys?" Dean asked.
Chuck looked up at them with annoyance.  "Are the three of you going to sit down, or are you just going to stand their giggling the whole time?"
"How did that even happen so fast?" Dean asked Cas as quietly as he could.
When it seemed that Castiel was finally done, he just laid down on the pavement next to his puking spot and closed his eyes.  Understanding how Castiel must feel, Dean found himself getting down and laying beside him.  A few minutes past as they laid there silently.  Thankfully this house was far enough from campus that they didn't have to worry about cops driving past.  Finally, Cas spoke, "I'm sorry, Dean."
Dean sighed.  Well, apparently this is happening.  "Great, Cas.  I'm sure they'll love you."  Dean smiled at Cas, but then shot a glare over to Gabe, who had a shit eating grin smeared across his face.
walked in.  Dean almost fell out of his chair trying to sit up straight and take his feet down from the desk.  He was young, and looked to be Dean's age.  His hair was inky black and standing up in a few different directions.  Not in a way that looked gelled, but in a way that made it seem like the guy just didn't feel the need to comb it.  He was wearing an ACDC t-shirt that was a few sizes too big for him and black jeans.  The guy looked around and stalled, mouth slightly hanging open, his expression stuck in the terrified freshman look that Dean had only a few weeks ago.  Dean's world seemed to move in slow motion as he stared.  The guy made eye contact with him just as he was pushed slightly from behind by two other guys piling in like dominoes.  The ACDC guy almost fell forward completely but ended up regaining his balance as the two guys behind him giggled and tried to keep themselves from falling too.  They had been running and coming to the screeching halt that they did when they ran into ACDC, Dean was honestly surprised that they managed to stay afloat.
Castiel curled his arms around himself and winced at the loud music, "Like death warmed over"
Dean loved being a part of the Singer family.  Even though he missed his mom and his dad terribly, being welcomed with open arms by people who have always been your family will always be something that he was thankful for, and he knew he was basically blood even if they didn't share genes.  Yes, there were plenty of things to get used to in this house.  The fact that they went to church every Sunday, without fail, the fact that Dean had to actually dress up for that occasion every Sunday, how much more difficult is was to get along with Jo and her moodiness when they were living together constantly, and the fact that Ellen would go into his room and clean when he wasn't home.  Phones were not allowed at the table, grace was always said before every meal, and every Sunday there was family day after church where there were no phones and a lot of board games.  It was a lot of change, but it was nice.  Family time was important to Bobby and Ellen and even though it meant he got a little less screen time, it really helped him feel more and more connected to the people in this house.
Before Dean could even open his mouth to talk to him, Cas sank to his knees in front of Dean and began to unbutton his jeans.
Dean didn't see Benny's expression because he just laid down and closed his eyes to keep the rage from bubbling inside of him, but his friend answered, "Yes ma'am" before turning off the light.
Dean froze.  Castiel continued in his laughing fit.  Dean wanted to rewind that to make sure he heard correctly.
There was only about three days left until he had to go back to school, and the family was sitting at the dining room to eat chicken parm for dinner.  It was one of Dean's favorites.  Ellen had decided that she was going to spend Dean's last week home before the semester started up making his favorite meals for dinner.  Tomorrow night, Bobby was going to cook bacon cheeseburgers on the grill.

Hannah, of course, was the first to break the silence.  "Well, don't everyone crowd him all at once, now." she spat out, sarcastically.
That's when Dean heard a loud moan.  At first he thought it was Castiel, but Cas had stopped kissing him.  Dean pulled back a little and opened his eys to see Cas tilting his ear up toward the door to listen for more noises coming from outside the bathroom.  There was another breathy moan.  Cas looked down at Dean with a surprised and confused smile, silently asking,
Dean finally returned her gaze and looked disappointed, "It would be, if I hadn't embarrassed myself to the max before we even made it back to my room-"
And as fast as it came, the relief dissipated, just like that.
