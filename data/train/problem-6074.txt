Even better, of course, is Steve shifting carefully, prying the tepid mug from Tony's hands that the engineer does his best to hold onto, only to replace it with a much warmer mug moments later. The heavy, rich smell of chocolate wafts up to his nose, curling around him and having him groaning; Steve and FRIDAY had conspired against him and pulled out the
it's just the two of them. It's quiet and peaceful in a way he can't describe as he shifts and presses himself into Steve's side, with Steve's arm settling warmly across his shoulders as a soft, hushed silence falls between them. Comfortable, muted not unlike the effect of the snow outside, but infinitely better because of the
Everything is soft, quiet. There's a hush that seems to have fallen over the world, soft and gentle, beneath the cold layer of precipitation coating the world in white. A majority of the trees along the lake's edge are bare, having shed their leaves months ago, and now their great, dark limbs are hushed in white. The snow whispers as it brushes against the frosted window, little tickles of sound that are almost covered up by the roaring fire behind him.
"My feelings exactly," Tony said, with a flicker of amusement. "But you don't choose for me, Pep – and, as for you, if you want to go base jumping off the Empire State then it's right there. Your choice, not mine."
Carter stared at him for a long moment. "You don't believe what I'm saying, do you? Not one damn word."
At least the buildings he could see looked like a pre-Snap American city. As he'd been heading for New York in 2012 he could presume that was where he was. Given a second look, it seemed vaguely familiar; Greenwich Village, maybe?
Tony, though, grabbed his arm and hung on firmly that Steve had to stop or drag him with him. "Steve, Steve, wait! Even if you... if you found him... too dangerous. You saw what he did ... to the wall. Without ... shield... go right through your body."
"The Sorcerer Supreme has spoken of Charles Xavier. I have to defer to so distinguished a telepath if he says he saw a human mind. But I also trust my own magic. Your friend is also at home in that particular body. He may have been born into something very sim—"
The universe hated him. Worse, Steve was indifferent to him. He thought he could have lived with the former if the latter wasn't true.
"Five hundred miles or so out in the Atlantic. Yes, I know. Unfortunately, this is the second attempt to fuel this aircraft. I was seriously considering going home and getting in the suit."
. Thank you for seeing us, Mr Stark. I am Ambassador Joseph Cheyo, Permanent Representative to the United Nations from the Republic of Tanganyika, and this is my UN colleague His Excellency Thabiti Ndungu from the Republic of Kenya."
Iron Man dropped through the tree canopy, smashing branches and scattering dead leaves before he landed, in his trademark down-on-one-knee position, on the bank of the creek. "So this is where you've been hiding. Are you all right?" he demanded.
Tony watched with obvious amusement as Steve scrambled into jeans and tee. He showed no sign of moving even when Steve paused, on one foot, to glare at him.
A wave of emotion rolled over him; of affection, of affirmation, but without threat. It sank into him and through him, bringing new knowledge. Then the artefact vanished under his hands, though the feelings didn't; they simply faded into the background, ready to come back when called.
But they are about to find out just how dangerous a place Wakanda can be, particularly when armour and shield have been left behind in New York.
"No. It's War Machine. But Jim Rhodes, who pilots it, is in Colorado. He has a pass for next weekend from the Air Force Academy but today he isn't due back until tomorrow. Besides, Tony and Jim would have flown directly into the armoury. Stay here, Steve. Don't get involved." He turned and strode back through the doors, breaking into a run as he headed for the stairs.
Bodies were being laid out under sheets in parking lots and gardens, and he and Rescue were reduced to retrieving more from the mud as the tide retreated.
He found Steve and Bruce seated at the breakfast bar, amid the remains of what looked like an extensive meal. They moved together to clear him a space as he hitched himself onto a seat and allowed Bruce to place a mug of coffee in front of him.
Once the door was closed behind him, Tony theatrically wiped imaginary perspiration from his brow. "So far, so good," he said. "Friday, seal all exits from the penthouse and inform me if he looks like making a break for it. We still have things to discuss."
Plainly, Steve had gotten that reference, or was pretending he did, for he said, "I'm also surprised no one's called me from the Tower. They must have all sorts of questions— Tony? You have told them I'm back, haven't you?"
It took several seconds for Tony's exhausted brain to digest this. "Oh," he said at last. "Guess you're not going anywhere."
Steve told himself, even as he fought to hold off his own tears and buried his face in Tony's hair. But he knew it wasn't true. That Tony had left his childhood behind when he'd lost his father and his world at sixteen. Steve himself was younger, nineteen years younger.
Yet the city was built by a technology far beyond his comprehension, and there were no shortages of food or water or energy or anything a man or woman or even a god might require.
A bright percussive energy bolt, tiny but powerful, struck him on the jaw, sending him staggering backwards. Steve left him to Danvers' not-so-tender mercies. It was with fierce joy at being able to hit something that he bounded across to the two men covering the parked aircraft, who had absolutely no warning as he disarmed and disabled them in four swift manoeuvres.
"And I'm strictly backroom," Hank protested. "Which reminds me, Tony: we finally figured out the link between the Chitauri troopers and their 'leviathans'. We've also worked out the atomic structure of that gas you acquired – the one that reacts so explosively with Chitauri tech and flesh. I'll leave the synthesis to you, but it shouldn't be that difficult."
And there was the 'sacred' mountain, right where he remembered it. He'd memorised their path from T'Challa's secret cave when they'd left, less than two days ago. It seemed like a lifetime.
. My samples are all sealed in vacuum right now – but I wouldn't like to bet how many pieces of tech are stored in garages or hung on the walls of dens – or Chitauri bodies cached in freezers or rotting somewhere out of sight and stink. But the real danger is, as Cap suggests, your 'leviathans'. And if they haven't already been moved out of Manhattan – in which case they're someone else's problem – I'm going to shift them myself to the bottom of the Atlantic. Tonight."
Long after he'd given up on being tall, dark and handsome and settled for being short and cute, he'd gotten the late growth spurt that everyone had predicted, so that even his one-size-fits-most armour found it difficult to accommodate his changing height. That seemed to have levelled off at last, just as his voice had settled to a pleasant light baritone. He was even trying to celebrate the fact that he now had to shave at least every two days by avoiding it and attempting to grow a beard.
He tried to cough it away, but he could feel his consciousness distancing itself from the reality of the hands and the blackness.
And got the grin he was hoping for, "Nothing stops me accepting those, Stark. But you used to be a patriot. Now you're selling technology that could give the US a huge technical and economic advantage to our rivals while destroying huge swathes of our economic base."
"So, why this sudden urge to come down here?" he asked. "I'm not taking a run, Steve. Because, really, you know me better than that."
It was not a straightforward journey – perhaps it might have been for someone as strong and lithe as T'Challa, but the Iron Man armour was bulky and not particularly manoeuvrable in confined spaces. Tony, however, was in no mood to follow the cavers' code to 'leave nothing but footprints.' Deploying lasers and repulsors, the strength of the amour and an occasional explosive, he opened up the narrow passageways cut by the ancient miners, broke down walls and, on occasion, cut shortcuts through solid rock.
"Dr Richards thinks that we're part of a multiverse," Tony said. "But our universe is at least thirteen and a half billion years old."
"It'll come," Steve said, reassuringly. "All you need is a few hours sleep, let your brain sort it out by itself. Maybe if we went upstairs and used that bed..."
"And it is plain you are telling the truth. Yet you remember how to speak English and, Tony tells me, French, German, Spanish and Italian, that he has tested. You even know a few words of Japanese.
T'Challa frowned. "Some of them. The ones I and my father and grandfather put in place. It may be enough. Let us hope it is, but as for the ancient magic maintained by the Panther god—" He shrugged.
He had just spotted the tunnel entrance ahead when metal-clad hands grasped him round the waist and hauled him into the air, the bike dangling from his hands, almost jerking his arms from their sockets as the ground fell away at the speed of an express elevator. But he didn't dare let go, the bike that Howard had modified for him a far too precious link with the past, the only one left, except for his shield.
"Just had an idea about that," Tony's voice said in his earbud as they lifted off. "Roller skates, or perhaps roller blades. Maybe I could adjust the repulsors to make wheels..."
Damn. He'd warned Natasha and Clint that Pepper would be in the building, but hadn't thought to say anything to Jan. The tension between the two women was already crackling in the air. He hurried to try to defuse it. "Pepper, Jan's borrowing one of the suites—"
"Has Odin authorised that journey?" Heimdall asked, his voice so deep it seemed to shake the very floor beneath their feet.
As the aircraft came to a halt, Steve left Hank to Jan, but shook Lieutenant Storm's shoulder. "Wake up, Lieutenant, we've arrived."
"Do that. Oh, and I resign." Tony said. "Yes, I know there's a penalty. I actually read contracts before I sign them. The money's already on its way to SHIELD's account."
And about his duty to his friend, and the woman who had stood by him. "Okay, Jan, and we need to do that now. Jarvis, please direct Hawkeye and the Black Widow to their floors – and get Happy up here."
In three days time, Tony and his Dad, Rhodey (on a weekend pass from the Air Force Academy), Rhodey's mother Roberta (if she broke free from that patent tangle), Happy (who was making a name for himself in the boxing ring when not working at his mechanic's apprenticeship), and Pepper and her father, would sit or sprawl watching bad geek movies while eating pizza, popcorn, and ice-cream, washed down with Coke, Dr Pepper, or beer.
Steve shifted slightly to allow him greater access, and Tony's grip tightened reflexively even as he shoved upwards, the head of his cock pushing against Steve's balls. Steve gasped and, unable to contain his reaction, flung his head back as Tony nipped at his throat.
The hesitation over the choice of that word was hideously telling. "Shit! What else can go wrong today? Don't answer that!"
"Yet here you are, outside his apartment. He was at Stark Tower last night and that's a Stark registered SUV parked over there."
Natasha, on the other hand, fixed Tony with that assessing stare. "I'm sure you and Jarvis will work out what happened," she said. "Meanwhile, we ought to pre-empt the inevitable questions and announce Captain America's death in action."
"Oh, I think I do. Maybe even by people you do trust. But it didn't stop you accepting campaign donations from me and SI, did it?" Tony retorted.
Tony winced. "You're right... Of course you're right. But I thought you might— Never mind. You deserve to know everything. Of course you do. It started when Dad and I saw the helicarrier explode..."
"It's in my report to the Board but, yes," she said, thawing just a little as Tony opened the elevator doors and ushered her inside. Then she added, "Maria and Fury want to talk to you. They say you're ignoring their calls."
"Thanks. Activate now." Danvers went back to exchanging increasingly terse messages with the Travis control tower, which now wanted to how the hell she had vanished and what the UFOs were.
It had its effect. If Tony had hackles, they would have been up. "Because, fuck it, I don't trust myself to be in the same bed as you," he snapped.
"Captain Rogers," Happy interrupted deferentially. "Thought you might want this," he added, offering a familiar red white and blue disc.
"Do I? Oh, yeah. 'Cap'. I've read too many comic books, I guess. You were Captain Steve Rogers – Captain America."
"Physically unhurt," Tony elaborated, his voice echoing from Jarvis's local speakers, a fraction behind the voice in Steve's ear. "Mentally completely incapacitated. I will never criticise cheesy sixties sci-fi TV shows again. God help me, that was a
"Understandably. SHIELD manipulated and misused you, thrust you into a role you only thought you understood. No wonder you eventually went off the rails."
"He has an excellent head for strong liquor," Natasha said. "Better than yours. And he is either very well briefed or he is who he says he is. I have yet to determine who he’s working for, but he is certainly working for someone. Even his disingenuous questions were too probing. He wants to know where Cap is."
As the vehicles left the tarmac and took a paved road across flat grasslands dotted with acacia trees ghostly against the lightening sky, N'kendi said, "The journey will take about an hour. If you wish to discuss anything with me I will be glad to help; our monarch is most ... exacting ... in his demands and insists that all details are correct."
"Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. I'm your best bet here. I've known Fury for years, and have been handling high-handed military yahoos for a lot longer. Though if you've got some sort of drug in that advanced pharmacy of yours that'll keep me alert for another twenty-four hours, I wouldn't refuse it."
Not a god, though; just an intelligence so advanced in power and so long-lived that maybe he could have an effect on the lives of his son's friends and the victims of his adopted son. If he wasn't currently at the other end of a broken Einstein-Rosen bridge.
And Tony, for one, had been doing all he could to encourage that attitude because the fewer people who knew that truth, the better.
"Oh, I'm not displeased with you, but Jan sure is gonna be. And Natasha. It's lucky for you I called Pepper this morning."
Steve eyed her warily; this was a very different Pepper from the one who he met occasionally in the tower Penthouse. This was a focused and formidable woman.
He had observed as much to Danvers, who had nodded. "Yeah. Plainly, they don't trust the USAFSF. Pity. It would be nice to have sniper cover."
"Well, I could start by telling you that the weapon you're pointing at me is useless. They're keyed to a single person. Go on, fire it at me."
She laughed. "If you want the plain-Jane scientist I can always put on an oversized lab coat and glasses, and pin my hair in a bun. My father would insist on it, if he could."
"Didn't want to brag too much," Tony replied. So Steve kissed him again. "Ouch. This is a new form of torture, I need a safeword."
Eventually, the SUV swung off the main highway, ferns swishing aside under its tires, and then they were travelling down a single-track road, branches sweeping the roof.
"That I can promise." Because it would never need to happen. The last thing he wanted was Steve involved. "So, did you make any impression on His Majesty?"
"The first might be possible, though not from here, but we do not have compatible cell phone connection with the outside world; the large deposits of vibranium in the mountain produce interference in the microwave frequencies used for cell phone transmission and reception."
"Jarvis says they’re either asleep or unconscious," Iron Man said, once he had recovered his equilibrium.
Tony shrugged. "Yeah. That too." But he had no intention of talking about it. He hit back. "If we're counting emotional cost, what about your brother White Wolf?"
"Steve, this is Jim Rhodes," he said. "War Machine. Part of Team Iron Man, son of Roberta Rhodes, the lawyer in Howard's video. One of my best friends and colleagues. Rhodey, Steve is trustworthy. Dad wouldn't have sent him with me if there were any doubts. Come on, fellas. Stand down. I want to know why Rhodey and Lori are here."
He handed it to Bruce with a pleading look, even as Steve said, "Close your eyes, Tony," and emphasised it with a gentle hand brushing down from his forehead. Tony shoved ineffectively at the heavily muscled arm, more to maintain his independence than because he expected – or indeed, wanted – to move it.
In panic, Steve looked back just in time to see the Hulk lift Tony from the floor, a massive hand grasping so much of his t-shirt that Tony was gasping for breath from that constriction alone.
"A ground effect vehicle. It's parked at the side of the temple – that side. Do you want me to check it out?"
Tony's expression was forbidding. "Perhaps. Perhaps. Now, coffee and pizza – and Jarvis, I'll need to arrange a meeting with Nick Fury."
"I haven't done anything to Pepper." Tony was instinctively defensive. "I left her with Fury. She's going to look for Cap's body for him." He was trying to sound as if he didn't care about this betrayal (except Pepper had no way of knowing it was betrayal) but was pretty sure Howard was aware of the deception. "Which reminds me, we need to cancel this movie party."
Iron Man, his bright armour blackened with soot and scorched from who-knew-how-many close calls, fell from the roiling sky to pick up Steve and carry him to the helicarrier, now acting as field HQ.
Deliberately, he lifted his head and stared up at the bowmen on the compound walls, then his gaze moved to focus on each of the escort in turn, before finally settling on Steve, in the White Wolf suit.
Oh, right. Jarvis was in charge of security nowadays and most of the staff were under the impression that he was a human being, albeit one they had never met.
Jan reached a hand inside her cleavage, pulled out what looked like a rather fat memory stick and tossed it to Tony. "Remember it's probably full of malware and viruses."
"I'm the one owed an explanation, Rogers," Iron Man snarled right back, the metal sliding away to reveal Tony Stark's flushed and angry face. "I'm not the one who fled from the Tower without so much as a thank you."
to a company called Skjöldur Exploration? On the same day a Russian oil company found the Red Skull's Flying Wing? A few days before they found Cap?"
Steve heaved a mental sigh of relief. It was much easier to cope with conversations about Thor and Asgard than about himself or Tony; in particular about himself and Tony.
The Ancient One took it and allowed herself to be helped to her feet. "That was... interesting," she remarked. "I have never encountered something so resistant to the power of the Time Stone before. It was powerful magic."
"Forget the jokes, Stark," Steve snarled back. "How could the arc reactor fail?" His hands were clenching and unclenching at his sides.
"I wish Bruce believed that," Dr Ross said wryly, "but, anyway, I understand from him that Tony prefers tall blondes."
Danvers hesitated and not, Steve suspected, because she was trying to cope with Jan's awful pun. "I needed to see Stark in a hurry," she said at last. "I didn't have his personal phone number and, while I bulled my way through to Potts, she wouldn't give me it. I knew Stark would recognise the transport – so I sure as hell didn't expect to be brought down."
There was something amiss with that response. Tony ran it back to himself in his head. "Jarvis," he said sharply. "'Presumably?'"
The next moment trembling hands lifted his head, and then pulled him into a hug so tight it hurt his ribs. He buried his face in Tony's shoulder and tried to believe he was real.
"I don't know how to thank you," Steve told her one day. "To be honest, I've no idea why you should risk your husband's anger for me."
"In that case, let's go somewhere private." Iron Man grabbed Hill around her waist and shot skywards.
While Steve and Lori watered the horses and stowed the fresh supplies in the refrigerator and freezer, Rhodey pulled Tony aside. "Tones, what is going on?"
"Very nice, Stark," Nick Fury's deep voice commented, close to his ear. "But we could have done with it months ago. Why decide to release it now?"
Mjolnir jerked free. Steve tumbled to the floor as Tony deliberately slid forward and under him. The Ancient One's voice stumbled to a halt. The Hammer picked up speed, crashed through the window and was gone.
"Dad was quite clear about how close he was to Sergeant Barnes and how good at controlling his strength. What about his vital signs?"
Sorry this has taken so long. Christmas, various small domestic emergencies and a slight writer's block are to blame.
"Or wrong," Rhodes said. "I'm gonna speak to the Commandant an' ask for an extension of my weekend pass."
Those were the last, though, for the series of shock waves sent their vehicle skewing sideways, missing a tree by inches. All three men ducked as a branch swept low over the seats. This manoeuvre, though, left Steve fighting to keep his balance, a fight he lost as the vehicle dipped to the right. He was about to dive head first over the side when Tony grabbed a double handful of White Wolf suit and yanked him down on top of him.
The Penthouse was empty. Tony took one look at the Master bedroom where all of Pepper's presence had been stripped away, and fled.
"Well, that's a relief. I've been keeping a lid on Hank for what seems like years. He's wild to tell you his latest findings but he can't find you and Jarvis won't help, so now he thinks you've been kidnapped or have taken off in the Iron Man suit somewhere. Jarvis says not, and I don't think he lies directly, so I presume you're with Steve. Probably in his quarters. I have to tell Hank that before he calls the cops or demands we fly to Malibu. So, boys, if you aren't decent I suggest you remedy that in the next few minutes, because we'll be heading your way."
In his head, Tony began frantic calculations. If he was above the Hatteras Abyssal Plain – and he suspected he was – he was drifting down through about eighteen thousand feet of salt water. Given the approximate specific gravity of the suit and the increasing pressure of water he should be able to work out how long it would take him to reach bottom – if he ever did. Well, he wouldn't know about it, because the suit carried very little air and could not manufacture any oxygen with the power out. Compare that against how long it would take the shrapnel to reach his heart without the electro-magnets powered by the inactive ARC reactor and it still didn't matter because the water pressure (about four hundred and fifty psi for every thousand feet) was going to crack the joints before either...
And almost tripped over Janet Van Dyne, dressed in a skintight suit of black and yellow, the electronic weapons he had built for her crackling at her wrists.
He probably could do it, too, while he was in the suit, and now wasn't the time to contest that claim.
It was only when he reached it that he found that his Wakandan allies were not fighting the Hatut Zeraze or even invading mercenaries; instead, they were engaged in a ferocious battle with a black clad team of SHIELD agents.
"Oh, and our Security people want to know how Captain Rogers is. And where they can get a First Aid kit like the one you had last night?"
"If SHIELD was hanging around Wakanda, it may have been because they thinking about recruiting for the Initiative," Steve said.
"Gladly, forsooth!" Even as he spoke, Tony had his gauntleted hands under the front axle, feet on the ground and braced for what he knew was coming, locking the armour's joints.
The house sat on a mound that looked almost artificial, which Steve guessed held Tony's armoury. Iron Man and War Machine, or whoever they actually were, had vanished.
"Now that last, I believe," Steve said. "You wouldn't have tried that line if she'd been alive to allow you and Fury to check your facts."
"And they were right to be concerned. Hank's store included one hundred and nineteen samples of human genetic material collected during his graduate student days, all nicely anonymised with numerical codes. Except I know Hank well enough to know there had to be an index to those codes somewhere – there was for everything else. And he would never have taken an odd number of samples. But there was no trace of a hard copy. So—"
"Stay here and assist the doctor as needed," the Ancient One said before turning to Tony and Natasha. "We must go to the meeting. Your friend is safe in these hands; I give you my word in this."
Which was something else that it was difficult to believe; that someone could be identified from their
"There is no science or magic that can enhance the spirit. And Thor also says that yours is the greatest he has known, and he is not prone to exaggeration – at least, not about anything that pertains to the assessment of a warrior."
"What's gotten into Pepper?" Tony asked plaintively, as the traffic stopped for no obviously apparently reason and the limo, perforce, stopped with it. "I mean, she's mad at me, an' that's, you know, kinda expected, but you were just sitting there being decorative, which you're good at, by the way, and she
"I have news for you, Steve," Tony said with as much gentleness as he could muster. "You're not a soldier and you were never suited to the job. Hush!" He put his fingers over Steve's mouth. "I've been in contact with the military most of my life and you fall at the first hurdle; the ability to follow orders, even when you disagree with them. You're a great leader, a strategist and tactician, but you don't know when to retreat."
But the Avengers were better than SHIELD, weren't they? Thor had offered Loki a chance to surrender. More than one chance. And they hadn't killed Loki, when he had accepted his defeat.
Steve glanced at his drawing, at the outline of the city that he had abandoned, at the sketches of Sif and Fandral, and at the more detailed drawing of Tony, done easily from memory. It worried him that he'd tried, over the last few days, to draw Peggy and Bucky, but never seemed to get them quite right, as if his memory of them was fading with time.
Once out of the water and into Iron Man's natural element, Tony took stock. He was faced with two immediate decisions: the first, whether to call in aid from SHIELD or Rescue, was the easy one. Even if whoever was in charge of SHIELD at the moment would believe him, and even if they could spare anyone to help, there was still the question about why they had been keeping Captain America alive and what they had been doing with the man. His fertile mind could not come up with any answer that put them in a good light. So, no, he couldn't trust them. And that also ruled out Rescue, because Pepper had wanted to be an agent of SHIELD since she had first encountered the organisation. Besides, he intended – if he could find him – to aid a fugitive who had killed, maybe in self-defence, maybe not. The law would have had something to say about that if Tony had left them any evidence: but he was interested in justice, not law.
It will also hide your bruises, Steve thought, but didn't comment. If it came to the point he was on Tony's side, and always would be. Not that he would blame Pepper for yelling – he only wished he had the right to do it himself.
"Obnoxious. Yeah, Cap, I know. Well, you'd been annoying the fuck out of me for years. I hated you right the way through my childhood because, hey, who likes to be compared to Captain America and found wanting by their own
"I'm sure that's what Fury intended," Tony said coldly. "Nice cosy chats. Tie Steve even closer to SHIELD. Didn't work like that. And if Coulson made the fakes obvious, he was the one who spoiled the plot." He liked the thought of that. Steve would like it too, when he told him.
"Well," Tony observed, as he paused the video feed with the flick of a finger. "They're going to have problems with the soul and no-one really believes in that aspect of dualism nowadays, or no-one who is properly educated does. I stress the 'properly'—"
"Do not try to pretend when I can see the bond between you as clear as if it was in the Eye of Agamotto. That is so rare among humans that I would have said it was unheard of, certainly in this strength. You read each other's emotions, each other's thoughts, don't you?"
As Tony's concentrated features emerged from his scratching pencil, he wondered if the original Steve Rogers had shared this skill. Was it what Tony and Howard had called his ability to fight – muscle memory?
Tony hoped the Oklahoma one was safer, even with Bruce there. He also hoped that when Hank finally got to try the particles on living things he wouldn't use anything larger than a rat. A miniature Hulk didn't bear thinking about, much as he would enjoy teasing Bruce about it.
Steve's eyes went a little wider, not at the sight of the bald man but at the flame-haired girl standing beside him and the tall young man in the thick sunglasses glaring protectively at them both. Both aroused emotions of respect and fear.
The big ground-effect vehicle sped across the surface of the lagoon, raising clouds of spray around its skirts. Tony, tied hand and foot and lying next to a similarly bound T'Challa in the aft cargo space, could see nothing but that spray and the sky blazing blue above it. By their position relative to the sun they were heading South East.
Steve was reminded, not for the first time, that it was only a few days since he himself had returned from Asgard.
One of Natasha's eyebrows was disappearing into her hairline. She turned to look at Clint, who had widened his eyes.
"We got a visit from a Doombot and Madame Masque," his father answered. "Don't worry, we took care of them."
"Just lucky, I guess. The lover bit, I mean. And we've averted that possibility for now, by turning Sandro. But there's more at stake than the government of the United States, and you know it as well as I do. If, as a last resort, I have to let that fall to save the world, then I will."
"Jackson's company makes air conditioning equipment," Pepper announced serenely. "Jack, this is the infamous Tony Stark."
And the eagle prow twisted towards him, as lithe as it the thing were alive. Its eyes were red jewel, and fire burned in their depth. Its wicked beak opened, revealing a black tongue as it shrieked.
"Of course, sir. But may I suggest you will also need food, sir. You yourself have not eaten anything for nearly twenty-four hours. The same is almost certainly true of Prince Thor."
Suit-and-Sunglasses looked at Steve properly for the first time, and his jaw dropped. Then he went for his shoulder holster.
Natasha, on the other hand, had decided to travel back to the 1960s, in a tie-dyed dress that came to her ankles and, God help him,
Chopping the last of his opponents in the throat, he whirled towards the place where the woman was being held, half expecting, and half dreading that she had already been forced into the car.
For the first time in what seemed like years, Tony found himself smiling as he made his way to his workshop.
Not that those meant anything. Like the painkillers and first aid box and the cotton buds and the safety razors, they were just things that Tony (or whoever he had gotten to equip the bathrooms) figured might be needed.
Steve gave him a long appraising look. "A shower, a different pair of pants and new shirt won't hurt. We're going to have enough trouble getting your staff to recognise you without the goatee."
Tony sighed. "I'm not sure. With anything that doesn't threaten Wakanda, I guess. He's a good ally to have, though."
His voice was suddenly drowned out by shrieking alarms and, riding on top of the hellish noise, the voice of someone speaking urgently in Wakandan.
There was a long silence, and Tony's heart sank with every second it was extended. Finally, Steve pushed himself up on his elbows to meet Tony's eyes. "I'm sorry. I want to— I want that so much, but I can't. I have to find Bucky—"
This, it turned out, edged a small, fast stream with deep cut banks, crossed by a simple bridge of two flat metal plates, a car's width apart. Tony jumped out to check their position, then drove straight across.
This one, though, seemed permanent and stable, a ring of crackling blue energy sitting in the middle of a concrete floor, with vehicles and stacks of packing crates surrounding it.
The aircraft – and it was certainly one of the oddest aircraft that Steve had ever seen – rolled on its side, the rotors ploughing up the ground before they came free and spun away. One struck the wall and broke apart, metal shards flying in all directions, ricocheting off Steve's shield. That probably made a hell of a noise but even crouched behind it he could not distinguish the ringing tones of vibranium steel from the deafening clamour of the crash.
It didn't sound much like a negotiation to Tony; more like an ultimatum. Fury didn't like ultimatums, but he was loyal to his staff. It would need careful handling.
T'Challa drank, and then took a seat on a stone bench, making that simple act appear as regal as taking a throne.
Steve suspected that the drug stimulated the nervous system of the leaders of the Panther tribe and destroyed that of those without their genetic quirk. When he voiced this theory, Frigga smiled and said, "Close enough, Captain." He was still not sure whether or not she had been humouring him.
Hill, who was standing a little aside, switched off her communicator and swung on them, demanding, "What the hell happened?"
Damn, he needed to be more wary, couldn't let anyone see how much Steve had meant to him – something he was only just beginning to come to terms with himself – and how much this had affected him.
Maybe, just maybe, Steve thought, this situation might be turned to their advantage. For as long as he could maintain this masquerade.
The right corner of Steve's lips quirked upwards. "Did they? I guess you're better informed than I am. I never asked. Guess all that 'back-pay' is a SHIELD lie too."
Then the weight lifted away abruptly, without any apparent effort and he was treated to the pleasant sight of shapely black-clad legs taking up a fighting stance.
"We'd be ready in ten, but I can't contact either the JFK tower or New York Centre by radio – the interference is
A force field glittered over the opening hatch. Iron Man and the Captain moved through it in unison. Steve hopped onto Iron Man's boot. The repulsors hummed, and then they were off into the dark.
"It may be worsen that," a new voice interrupted. It came from a middle-aged woman in a simple uniform of black pants and blue shirt, but with a pilot's wings sewn onto the latter. The captain of Jackson's plane, presumably. "I didn't like the look of the weather comin' in. The last time I saw a cloud formation like that was out in tornado alley."
"In which case it'll be all over the net in twenty seconds," Tony said, with a sigh. "Jarvis, has SHIELD put out an alert to look for Cap?"
"If he does, there may be something worse waiting for us." Tony pulled to a halt at a red light. "Bruce, take the wheel. We may need Iron Man."
"Where's the Panther?" he asked, as Steve, apparently unsurprised, turned to look at him. "Did you talk him round?"
, and Freyr would not sail that to Midgard, even if Odin ordered it," Thor said. "We must be thankful.”
Jan's eyes narrowed for a moment and Tony could almost see her reassessing her judgement in the light of that last statement. Then she grinned. "And, of course, she can't wear this particular shade of red—"
Steve's breath caught in his throat, and he found himself unable to look away, unable to speak, damn near unable to think...
Tony shook his head, unwilling to let his disappointment show. "I'm beginning to suspect something's going on there – probably has a threesome going with Hank and Jan. Unless they've imported a load of dancing girls."
"Or the eastern end of Queens and the west of Nassau County," Tony replied. "Either way, it's going to be expensive, both in lives and property damage. I'd offer you beds at Stark tower – we've plenty of room now most of the repairs are completed – but you might well be safer—" He paused as he was interrupted by an urgent, mounting screech, then pulled out his Avengers communicator and slipped the earpiece in.
The Hulk turned to look at him, and the expression on his face chilled Tony colder than the rain. There was no intelligence in that look, no recognition, only pure rage.
It was only then that Tony realised that she was in the process of reaching for the Gene's artefact—
Pepper pushed back her chair, crossed her legs to show off both their length and her latest pair of designer high-heels, and raised perfectly plucked eyebrows. Tony considered the heels entirely unfair. The very highest enabled her to look down at him. Damn it, she was nearly his height in flats.
Inwardly, Steve winced. Apparently some of Howard's stories had been all too accurate. "Phillips protected me – because right then, the US needed me. Your friend follows orders or loses his career, at the least. And if some lawyer can swing it so refusing that order sounds like treason, he could end up in Leavenworth."
"Yeah. Steve – you know, the man who knew your father and how his mind worked. He was sure Howard would have put in a disguised aerial somewhere, so he and Hank went out and asked some ants."
Steve Rogers, clad in nothing but a towel wrapped about his waist, was standing waiting for him. He grabbed Tony's elbows and hauled him out into the room.
"That hangar's just about big enough to hide one of these." Fury waved a hand at tail spikes passing in front of him.
Moments later, he was in the air, jetting North East, just above the tallest of the skyscrapers, Long Island Sound glinting away to his right.
Even as the computer said, "You fainted," the door to the workshop opened and Tony's father ran into the room.
Leaving Steve and Tony hidden in the bush, T'Challa walked boldly up the steps to the doorway and rapped on it with his fist. An old man carrying a huge, spike-headed club emerged, speaking sharply in Wakandan – then he halted abruptly, and made a one-handed gesture which became an almost-bow. T'Challa waved Tony and Steve to join him, and, moments later, they were ushered urgently through the door.
Ah, she was testing him in her turn. Luckily, two and two suddenly made five. "Oh, Phil Coulson's old grandpappy. Glad he was one of yours," Tony said.
Even as he had given that order he had been mentally pleading with a long-dead Howard Stark to forgive him for killing his son. Now he was beginning to know the real Tony and the memories of the portal closing and Iron Man falling out of the sky were a new feature of his nightmares.
A long limo with darkened windows drew up at the kerb, and the passenger door slid back, allowing Steve to leap inside and escape the cell phones. Happy, in the driver's seat, was already signalling to pull out into the traffic.
There was an abrupt silence, then Tony lowered his eyelashes and looked at Steve from under them. "Well, not to Stark Industries, at any rate," he purred.
It was ludicrous, impossible, yet Tony was certain it was true. He was also certain that Steve was becoming more and more agitated as the explanation progressed...
"If that's the new version of my will I've just e-mailed her some amendments. I can't see her today, anyway. We're landing at Vicstar field. No one will expect us there, but it's an easy flight to McGuire Field in the Iron Man armour. I want to talk to Colonel Velasco, if he's still alive. And to offer our help if it's needed."
Steve looked down at his feet, then gathering his courage, up to meet Jan's eyes. "It's easy to be a good listener when you never know what to say to girls."
"Why?" Steve asked. Then, as both men looked at him as if they had almost forgotten he was there. "You said their job was to protect Wakanda. So why ally with these mercenaries?"
"In the penthouse kitchen having lunch with Dr Banner. He asked me to call him if you woke up while he was gone so he could bring you your coffee."
"Then quit acting as if you are," he snapped back. "Stop believing that you are always right. Trust me, Rogers, I've been there, done that, printed the T-shirt. But it didn't last. If nothing else, I had Pepper and Rhodey – and you – to remind me I was just a rich genius jerk. But your legend, as the embodiment of the American Dream – God help me, we all believed in that. I did, Wilson certainly did, even Ant-Man – who I understand has been grounded so hard by Henry Pym that he's in concrete up to his balls – and everyone else who fought on your side
Tony tried to suppress the warmth that rose through him, but it was impossible. The memory of Steve's kisses – a little unskilled but warm and passionate – banished the remnants of his anger.
His shield was in plain sight, leaning against the wall near the bed, right next what appeared to be a bedside table. He pulled the top drawer open, and there were the possessions he had been carrying, including his cell phone. Which had Tony's number programmed in, though he had never actually used it. Indeed, he had never switched it on, sure that it would be monitored in some way.
Below them lay a wide coastal plain, bounded on three sides by terraced hills. Sunlight bounced blindingly off long lakes, studded with emerald islands. Beyond them lay an ocean so blue it made the sky look pale.
"Natasha and Clint?" Steve nodded towards the ambulance. "Minor injuries. I found them trying to disarm a bomb while holding off a series of attacks. We got out just in time."
"It's been less than a month." Bruce shook his head. "I'm not concerned with Thor, and Natasha and Barton will look after each other, but I'm worried about Steve. I was used to being on my own, but he—"
And now Hill was staring at him with such an air of astonishment that his heart started beating so fast he had to remind himself that it really was undamaged. "We didn't get even half of the living out in time, Stark," she said, "let alone the brain dead."
Steve dived under the Hulk's dangling hands, sliding face down across the floor to fling his arms around Tony and frantically roll them both away from the Hulk...
"So," Steve said to Danvers, as he started back towards the house, signalling to the women to follow him. "What did you expect from Iron Man, Colonel?"
There was another awkward silence, then Pepper said, "I want to thank you for assigning Happy to me. I know how much you relied on him, but I really don't feel safe with anyone else."
"Then we were interrupted by that Wakandan business and it took me a while to retrieve the storage media and get all our data unloaded and accessible. But we'd left all our samples behind in Oklahoma. Getting my hands on an actual Chitauri body was difficult and kinda illegal, but eventually Jarvis located and purchased one for me on the black market. Jan paid for it," he added, with an apologetic look at his partner.
Tony raised a hand, waggling his fingers, and Steve hurried towards him, stumbling as he reached the pathway, and dropping onto the seat beside him, so their shoulders brushed.
It didn't help that someone – Tony, it had to be Tony – had added controls to his bike that he didn't understand. It was more responsive now, and faster – more responsive and faster than the Triumph Tiger – but that didn't bother him so much as the unfamiliar buttons and switches that did God-alone-knew-what. Tony would no doubt have briefed him, if he had had the nerve to face Tony... Facing down the Red Skull had been easy compared to that.
"There isn't anyone else," Steve insisted, but there was no enthusiasm in his voice. "No one else cares about Bucky."
"Fine. Is that the left side when we're looking at the bed and or when we're lying on it?" Steve was moving them both towards the stairs as he spoke. "Can you get undressed by yourself? Or do you want me to help?"
He's calling Pepper a liar, Tony thought. I should be angry. Why am I not angry? Oh, the drug... But this is interesting. They haven't dosed her then. They're underestimating Pep. That is so dangerous.
"We would have had this fight then. But at least you would have been in the suit," Steve said dryly.
Tony wasn't listening to the preacher, who was having to compete with some irreverent unidentified (at least by Tony) birds. Instead, he was trying to locate Pepper, who had taken on the task of looking after Coulson's ex-girlfriend, the cellist from Portland who was, not surprisingly, wide-eyed and somewhat overwhelmed by the attendees at his funeral. The gravestones in this particular DC cemetery might also have given her food for thought, as might the black granite memorial with the SHIELD logo and an engraving of the helicarrier beneath it. Coulson's name appeared there, along with all the others who had died in its defence, whether buried here or not.
It took him less than fifteen minutes to make his way to the kitchen via his own bedroom where he had showered and changed and perched his signature sunglasses on his nose.
Realising they had been tricked, the squad went into full aggressive mode, guns out, covering every empty inch. Hennis looked about him, then, snarling, backhanded Tony in the face.
Tony rarely felt embarrassed by anything, but the thought that Steve had seen anything of his mediocre performance the night before still made him squirm.
"I'll hurt you." Steve's voice was shaking slightly, whether from passion or anger or both Tony couldn't tell.
"Deal," Steve agreed, and leaned in to kiss him fleetingly. "I'll set up in the living room. Call me if you need anything."
"Shit!" Tony grabbed the nearest tool – a wrench – and flung it away. It hit the forge and bounced, narrowly missing DUM-E. The bots scuttled for cover as, in an effort to stop himself creating more damage, Tony swept the remaining tools from the workbench in a clatter of metal. "Damn it,
There was the sound of heavy breathing, then the familiar voice said: "Boss, boss, you there? Are you on your way? You haven't lost the signal?"
Tony grimaced, but got to his feet and walked swiftly into his bedroom, Steve following at his heels. Once there, he donned a pair of heavy workman's gloves, then opened the closet and unzipped his bag.
"Just talk to her first. If she really wants me to throw you out, I'll send you to join Bruce and his colleagues, though you'll probably be bored out of your mind. But she won't."
Okoye had waited until he had finished speaking, but only just. Her words followed his as he drew breath, and there was a question in them.
"Yep, though I hadn't installed the latest version. And I'm hoping it was one of the things Rhodey kept quiet about."
Now, Iron Man dropped vertically from an altitude of ten thousand feet onto the White House roof, thereby passing the outer ring of Secret Service guard posts. The weather was being co-operative, with a low ceiling of grey cloud that was easy for the camouflage to mimic. That, at least, protected him from anyone hoping to report on #herospot. He hoped. He was more confident in the armour's ability to confuse the radar, helped by Jarvis's hacking of the White House security systems as they approached.
"—and Pepper's collecting some of her stuff," Tony continued, despite his sinking feeling. The afternoon, which had begun so well, looked like turning into a nightmare.
And, even as he raised his hands to fire the repulsors, he realised that the Hulk had paused, was looking into the depths of the temple, where something blue-white and hideously familiar was flaring.
A much larger, much slower-spinning disk flashed behind him on the HUD, but that wasn't a threat and the tiny, seemingly unstoppable buzz saws bounced off it.
To his surprise and not a little admiration, she didn't even squeak, and the SHIELD agents were far too well trained to shoot the Deputy Director.
Well, he had certainly had his cue. "The blinds were up but I couldn't see anything much through the window. Which is why I broke in. I didn't have time to find anything before I was blinded by a super-charged firework."
dead! Whose brains did it eat to become a fucking zombie? It had ceased to be! Expired and gone to meet its maker! A stiff! Bereft of life. Its metabolic processes ought to be history...!"
Tony halted, though he did not turn. He appeared to be hyperventilating from the way his shoulders were rising and falling. "Yeah." He bit out the words. "Okay. Take care of Steve."
Last time they had encountered it he had spent the whole of his time with Gene trying to keep the rings out of the Mandarin's hands. Things had certainly changed.
Tony and Steve have chosen to assist T'Challa in regaining his kingdom and defeating their joint enemies.
Tony shook his head in an effort to clear it of the contradictions and winced again, flopping face down on the mattress and wondering how much it would hurt to get out of bed or whether, if he could catch enough breath to yell, someone – not that traitor Steve, definitely not – would fetch him some coffee, or, better yet, whisky...
The helicopter rotor wasn't even turning now, yet the thing still flew, limping away over the ocean, Iron Man following in its wake.
"Dad knows about it. He's supporting me." Tony hoped he didn't sound as defensive as he felt. Rhodey's moral sense could cut in at the most inconvenient times. He supposed it came from having a father in the military and a mother who was a lawyer. Or maybe being made to go to church. "But it wouldn't be the first time you disapproved of my actions and I turned out to be right."
Steve grabbed the pilot by the collar and hauled him through the tangle of wood and canvas and various substances he didn't recognise, though Tony would know—
Danvers grinned. "I'll tell him you used that nickname. It's 'Goshdarn!'" she called back. "But only under extreme duress and he always apologises if there are women present."
The incoming tide was now crashing against the base of the headland on which the house stood, so Steve turned inland, testing himself against the stiff climb up the cliffs.
"Sure, Tony." Steve's arm was round his waist again, supporting him as they made their way up the spiral stairway. This time he did not protest, let alone push him away.
"What, none of the Howling Commandos were willing to help you out? What about that friend of yours – Barnes?"
"Unless they also wish to waste time and energy fighting the winds I would suggest the calm at the centre, where they are also protected from any attack."
"Makes sense," Steve said, quickly forestalling the pending argument, and looking sternly at Tony, who shrugged, then turned and addressed the armour.
"I believe that if you look in your closets you will find that is not the case, Captain. I am afraid you will have to leave your shield. Smuggling that past airport security may be beyond even Mr Stark's powers. If it makes you happier, he is leaving the suitcase armour behind."
"Happy would rather be with you. And he's just as good a bodyguard as he is a chauffeur – which is very good indeed. Keeping him with me was just indulgent, Pep – he was great for Tony Stark but he couldn't keep up with Iron Man."
"Yes, Tony, I know, but there are people who are convinced the cure may be worse than the disease. We're only just coming out of one world recession—"
Her expression said she knew exactly what he was thinking and that it didn't endear him to her. "Jim and I were at Flight School together. I'm Danvers. Colonel Carol Danvers."
And Tony had sent all the Avengers undercover for a reason, which had not gone away. Eventually, he would have to go, and the longer he stayed the worse the loneliness would be.
Back at the computer station, he asked Jarvis to pipe white noise around Tony, and went back to their work on the reports of 'monster' sightings going back over ten years. Even isolating the original sightings of the Hulk was not as easy as it should have been, with every imagination in the US apparently running riot and reporting it on the internet.
And that was a lie. But he could hardly say, "I met someone else the day before yesterday." Not when he wasn't likely to be able to date Steve. And when he had to avoid giving Pepper the choice between him and SHIELD. "You'll always be my friend, Pepper, and you'll always have the Rescue armour. Mind you, if anyone except you tries to tamper with it, or even examine it too closely, all the electronics will be scrambled and the servos will melt down. Then I'll upgrade it for you, every time, because you deserve it. And when, in about twenty years time, you're Director of SHIELD, maybe—"
"You don't have to be anything you don't want to be," Howard said, his voice as firm as if he was addressing a room full of recalcitrant shareholders.
Tony winced. "Whitney wants to kill my Dad, because she blames me for what happened to her Dad, who's sorta in the same state you were twenty four hours ago. She thinks that would be the best revenge on me."
Tony swallowed, and began to pick carefully at the tape. Finally, he was able to strip the dressing away.
The helicopter swung out over the water, circling to bring an all round view to TV viewers, as the ornithopter continued its slow progress towards Manhattan.
"One man only," the AI reported, confirming what Tony was seeing in the HUD. "The only other infra-red and radar contacts appear to be animals. There is a mixed herd of antelope, zebra and African buffalo approximately a mile and six hundred and thirty-two yards away at the closest point. A group of lionesses are flanking them, on the far side of the herd."
"Any normal human who gets a lungful is unlikely to survive. It probably wouldn't slow the Other Guy down."
"Okay." Tony was pleased to hear his voice sound so normal. So, the Widow and Hawkeye were in the capital – a dangerous place for them to be, but he wouldn't have dared to argue with either of them. And for Natasha to put in an appearance as Natalie Rushman meant that she had something very important to convey to him.
"Don't have much choice with 'Hard Rock' and 'Metal' pounding through the speakers," Steve pointed out.
It was odd to realise that people were actually more scared of Tony Stark's power than of Iron Man's.
Dr Ross burst out laughing. "I'm not sure I should, Tony, but somehow I do. Call me Betty, please. Are you here about that creature in Seattle? I still haven't been able to make contact anyone still working with gamma radiation – and your head of security, Mr Jarvis, hasn't been able to put me through to Bruce."
Steve's eyes lit up as he poured lube into his hand. With one hand on Tony's knee, Steve reached down and circled Tony's hole before slowly pushing in.
"You better!" Tony fiddled with the stones laid out on his worktable, searching for the perfect combination.
"I may have been curious as to how the good Captain is doing." Tony finally admitted as he spin the image between them.
"So that's why these abductions are getting under your skin." Tony released Steve's hands so he could wrap him up in a tight hug. He swallowed and blinked hard to keep the tears at bay. "We're going to find them. I promise."
"Wait, what signal?" Tony perched on a tall stool as holograms of Jarvis' progress popped up around him.
Tony turned to Steve, regret clear on his face. "I can't go. Not unless this is another alien invasion. You know Pepper's been harassing me about this board meeting for months. I can't miss it."
"Couple days at most." Steve's right hand slid up Tony's side and caressed his cheek. "I'm going to miss you."
Tony began to slowly peel the chastity belt off of Rogers. As he opened the front, he found Rogers' cock was tucked into a metal cock cage. "Fuck, Bruce, find me some lube."
Tony grasped Steve's hand and chuckled as his boyfriend pulled him tight to his chest, wrapped both arms around him, and kissed him deeply. He melted into the kiss.
"The laptop which Miss Romanov retrieved automatically connects to a satellite. This feeds information to what appears to be their main hub of operations. It is well encrypted and the signal difficult to trace. Although, I have made significant progress since it was brought in."
Bucky led the way through the apartment as they explored. To the left was a short hallway. The first door was a large bathroom, and across the way was a laundry room. Beyond that there was an office with a large desk and several bookshelves.
Bruce nodded, thankful Tony came to the conclusion on his own. "About that. Bucky asked us to look into what happened to Colonel Phillips and a man named Henderson. Apparently, it's important to Rogers."
"If you'll allow me," Jarvis spoke up. "Access to the living quarters is restricted. One must pass security measures in place at the building's entrance, a security check, and biometric scans at the elevators. Only those with permission may access the residential floors, communal floor, and the communal gym. Each floor contains a foyer so one does not step straight into the apartments. At each apartment door, there is a handprint scanner, as well as voice recognition. Individuals may customize their security protocols with me. Information is kept on a secure server which only I can access. I am only authorized to grant access in the case of an emergency."
Steve sucked in air, but his breath was soon punched out of him again when Stark pushed his thumb into Steve's ass. The burn of the stretch bringing more tears to his eyes. With the sound locked into his cock, Stark's fist in his ass, Henderson shoving his thick cock down his throat, and Phillips playing with then putting the clamps on his nipples, Steve was overwhelmed with the stimulation. If done right, any of those would have easily allowed him to slip into subspace. However, with them all at once and without any care, the calm headspace was nowhere in sight. He wouldn't be drifting tonight. But that wouldn't keep him from experiencing subdrop when he returned to his quarters. Such were the facts when a Dom only used a sub for their own pleasure and paid no mind to the subs needs.
"I'd like to check your heart, lungs, reflexes, and draw some blood to ensure all your levels are within the optimal range."
"Oh, God. Here I come." Stark shoved his cock down Steve's throat one last time as his cum flooded the sub's throat. He leaned over Steve and moaned in pleasure as he orgasmed.
"Oh thank God!" Tony sighed and his shoulders relaxed as he pulled the ring from the box. "It's made of vibranium marbled with gold. The stones are sapphires and rubies."
Tossing the gloves to the trash, Howard gripped his son's shoulder. "There are several of his journals in storage. I've never had a reason, nor the desire to peruse them. I'm thinking maybe it's time."
When Tony peered back at his workstation, he grinned. Of all the precious stones on his table, the cornflower blue sapphires and the rubies looked the most striking side by side. "Yep, this is perfect. J, let's get to work. I want this done before Steve gets home."
"Alright." Bruce held his hands up in front of him, attempting to keep the man in his bed. "I'll help you, but you must stay in a wheelchair. You don't have the strength to be standing on your own as of yet and I'm willing to bed Rogers won't take too kindly to you being injured yet again on my watch."
A loud moan of pleasure ripped from Steve as he bottomed out and orgasmed. Both arms wrapped around Tony, holding him close as his body tremored with release.
"I'm here, Stevie. I'm alive and well all thanks to you. You did so good. You protected me when I couldn't do so myself. You always take such good care of me. We're safe now." Bucky kept up a litany of praise and comforting words. It took several minutes, but he finally sensed Steve relaxing into his embrace.
"Yeah. With the medical equipment we found, there is no way they were just doing medical checkups before selling the women." Steve blew out a long breath. "I guess all we can do is wait until Natasha finds what they have on the computer."
"Why did they disappear? Did they know we were coming? Was it the plan all along? Not to mention the unanswered questions of what they were doing with the women."
Setting the device down, Howard turned to his son. "Not all Doms know how to properly care for a sub. Could be he allowed the fact he was Captain America's Dom go to his head and chose to exert that dominance in every way he could."
Howard noted his son now appeared exhausted and wanted to ask about it, but recognized Tony's demeanor indicated he wouldn't easily open up about whatever was bothering him. Choosing to table the conversation for later, he approached the open case and smiled at his son's work. "You realize this is supposed to just be a prototype, right?"
"Well, hopefully, you don't ever have to worry about that. I'm going to be here for you as long as I live. I can promise you that I will never willingly leave you. I will always stand by your side. I will always protect your back. If something happens, I will always come for you." Tony lifted up to his elbow. "I love you, Steven Grant Rogers. More than I ever imagined I could love another person. You make me better. You love me, encourage me, tell me off when I'm being an ass ... and the way you look at me. It's as if I'm the only thing in the universe that matters to you. No one has ever looked at me the way you do."
He would never admit it to his father, and hoped he would be able to hide the fact, but he had been up all night. The calm he found while cooking with his mother completely gone upon his return to the penthouse. He had checked in on their guests through Jarvis and learned Rogers had been restless, most likely with nightmares. Tony had wanted nothing more than to go to medical and sit with the solder, to comfort him, but instead respected Barnes' wishes and steered clear. After an hour of pacing, while Jarvis had the surveillance from medical playing, he headed down to the floor where Rogers and Barnes would be moved once discharged from medical. The renovations had been completed two days prior, but Tony still walked through the entire apartment ensuring everything was in place. Once happy with the end result, Tony went to his lab and began upgrades on his Iron Man armor. He hadn't slept a wink.
Bucky peered down at Steve, his heart breaking for what the other man had to endure. In the time they wanted, Steve had fallen into a light sleep, but now Bucky needed to get him cleaned up, fed, and water into him. Only then would Steve truly be able to rest.
"Seeing that facility, just brought it all back." Steve swallowed hard before lifting his gaze to Bucky. "I thought I was over it ..."
"Well then, help me up so I can go over there. Maybe I can coax him back to the land of the living."
"I'm going to stay here and watch a bit more television, then head to bed. If you need me, you know where to find me, right?"
Steve's brow furrowed as Tony moved to sit up beside him, crossing his legs and scooting close until his knees touched Steve's side. "Tony?"
Bruce made Bucky promise not to move until he returned and went in search of a wheelchair. Ten minutes later, Bucky was being wheeled across the room. Bruce lowered the rail on Steve's left side so Bucky could reach him.
Henderson allowed his gaze to linger on the Sub in the room. When Phillips told him he would become Captain America's Dom, he'd been elated. He finally had a chance to force the strongest Sub to submit. Something which would bring him immense pleasure in bragging about.
Bruce shrugged. "Still don't really get why I had to come with you all. It's not like we can't ID bodies back at base."
Although Tony is normally one to chat away to avoid awkward silence, he senses Steve's need to speak in his own time. So, keeping his mouth shut, he grasped Steve's left hand and rubbed his thumb over Steve's ring.
"A whole floor? Geez, Stark." Bucky led the way to the door and placed his hand on the glowing square in the wall.
"Hey, you're alright. I'm right here, not going anywhere." Tony squeezed Steve's hands, hoping to ground him in the present.
"Because what happened wasn't your fault. Why would he blame you for something out of your control?"
"Hey, if I can find your sorry ass in the basement of a Hydra base in the middle of a war, I think I can find you on the other side of the floor in a stupidly huge tower in the middle of New York."
Steve waved as he headed for the room filled to the brim with art supplies. It didn't take long to find a brand new sketchbook and a pack of pencils. Grabbing both he headed to the small sub den in his room. Closing the door behind him, and settling into the softest cushions Steve had ever seen along the back wall, Steve opened up to the first page and began to draw. He spent several hours in the corner of his den as images of the Howling Commandos, and Bucky filled the first several pages of his book. He couldn't remember the last time he was this relaxed and settled.
"They're alright. Bucky is healing nicely. I spoke to him this morning about the possibility of a prosthetic. He was excited about the idea of a robotic arm." Bruce chuckled, remembering the excitement in Bucky's eyes as he explained what Tony and Howard wanted to attempt on his behalf. "You can start with whatever scans or molds you need when you're ready."
Soulmarks consist of an image or shape on the left wrist, and the soulmates name along the inside of their left forearm. They start as a grey spot on the wrist which slowly turns into their soulmark. The names only appear after the mark has taken shape.
Finally, the wide flat tip of the sound touched the head of Steve's cock. He would have sighed in relief if he could suck in air. Moments later, Henderson slipped a ring attached to the base of the sound around his cock, locking it into place. A cock ring soon followed, cluing him into the fact that he wouldn't be able to come for hours if Henderson got his way.
Before the war, Steve had heard of such a thing as a sub den but had never seen one before. They tended to be a space only the richest could afford seeing as they contained soft blankets and pillows with which a sub could build themselves a nest. The rooms were a safe haven for a sub. A Dom was not allowed to enter without the express permission from their sub, permission which must be granted each time.
As time progressed, Steve found himself grateful Henderson's quarters were on the very edge of the camp, and that Henderson chose to gag him for the duration of their time together. Otherwise, the whole camp would have heard his screams.
A constant beeping reached his ears and it took him several minutes to realize it wasn't just one, but two machines making the sound. Understanding there was only one way to learn what was going on, Bucky slowly blinked his eyes open.
Strong, familiar arms wrapped around his waist as he waited. "Morning, handsome. I hope you slept well." Tony beamed as Steve pressed a kiss below his ear.
"What I want to know is who the hell sent him on a mission with this thing on?" The final bead finally popped out and Tony's shoulders sagged. "Done. Get me some wipes so I can clean him up."
"I'm not the only one who can find happiness." Steve gripped Bucky's shoulder and smirked, choosing to change the subject. "I've seen the way you and Natasha gaze at each other. When are you going to get your head out of your ass?"
"Was about two blocks from home when I was pulled into an alley. Couple a guys grabbed me, put a bag over my head, tied my hands, and tossed me into a van. Was little then, tried to fight back but there were too many of them. They were too strong." Steve turned away from Tony, looking to the corner where Dummy and U were docked and charging. "When the bag came off we were in a warehouse. There were about a dozen or so other people there. They were bringing in people off the street, checking to see who was a virgin and who wasn't. Those that weren't, well, the guys were sampling the merchandise. We were kept in dog cages until they were ready to load us up."
"Need anything else, we'll be right outside." Gabe offered Bucky a small smile before leaving, ensuring the tent flaps were securely closed behind him.
As they passed through the door, Steve drew in a deep breath to center himself. As the lock clicked behind him, Steve began to remove his uniform, folding and placing it neatly on a nearby chair. Once he stood completely naked, Steve swallowed hard and lowered to his knees.
With gentle hands, Bucky looked Steve over. Anger boiled inside him at what he found. "I'm gonna kill them."
"Leave it to us. We'll gather what you need and stand guard. Take all the time you need." With that Gabe left the tent.
When the food stopped coming, Steve released a long, contented sigh. Bucky ran his hand through Steve's hair again before gently guiding him to lay his head on Bucky's thigh. Settling into the new position, Steve continued to drift in rarely found subspace.
"My pleasure." Stark slicked up one hand with a small bead of the lube and immediately pressed two fingers into Steve's tight hole.
"Of course, Sergeant Barnes. I have placed the floor on lockdown which can only be lifted by yourself or Captain Rogers."
As the elevator began to rise the three floors, Tony leaned down and began to tease Steve's nipple with his mouth and tongue.
Tony stepped out from the spray of hot water and began to towel himself dry. "They think I don't know what they're up to, but Dad must have noticed I'm not totally balanced. He and Mom tend to invite me over for pizza just so Mom can pull me out of my head for a bit."
Tony snagged another soda from the fridge and headed for his lab. It would be cutting it close, but if he assigned someone else to move the equipment they needed to medical, he would be able to focus solely on the arm and nail down the last few details before it was time to leave.
"They've only been found an hour and you're already turning Barnes into an experiment?" Natasha rolled her eyes at him.
Time seemed to drag on as the three men continued to take their pleasure. He wished for nothing more than for the abuse to be over but knew that the men spilling their load into him wouldn't mark the end. When Stark's thrusts became more frantic, Steve prepared himself to swallow as much as he could. He wanted to avoid the punishment he would receive if any cum spilled to the floor.
"You want to know what I love most about him?" Henderson paused for effect as he lifted the first item from the table. "No matter what we do to him, no one will know because of how quickly he heals. He takes everything so well."
"They were wrong." Tony's gaze shifted back to Rogers. His body lay mostly naked on the table. "This, dear Brucie, is a classic example of a Dom exerting complete and overwhelming control over their sub."
"He's fine for the most part. In shock, but that's to be expected. Barnes managed to get him to fall back asleep. I'm keeping him overnight for observation, but barring any unforeseen complications, they both can be released in the morning."
Bucky sighed before smiling softly at his best friend. "I don't know. But what I am certain about is they will treat you the way you've always wanted. They'll want what's best for you, cherish you, do everything they can to show you each and every day how much you mean to them. They will be the best soulmate a person could ask for because that, my friend, is what you deserve."
Bucky's heart dropped more the longer he worked. There was evidence of more than just knife play, but what really angered him was when he went to clean Steve's back and noted someone seemed to have fucked Steve with no preparation or lube. Steve's hole was torn and bloody, cum and blood still dripping out of him.
Steve tapped one of the images and drew his hands apart in the air, blowing it up to see the details more clearly. "I count three transformers."
"Copy. Finish searching the grounds. Bucky and I are working through the basement now." Steve kicked in another door then followed Bucky inside, clearing the room easily.
Bucky heard Gabe's soft whispers to the rest of the guys outside, trusting the gentle Dom to get what was needed to care for Steve. While he waited for supplies, Bucky settled into Steve's bed, gently shifting him until Steve lay in his lap. Carding his fingers through Steve's hair, massaging as he went, Steve curled into him.
Henderson shoved his thick cock into Steve's hole in one sharp thrust. "By all means, enjoy yourself."
"Of course, Sir." The windows immediately blacked out and the lock on the door engaged with an audible click.
"On it." Tony taped out a couple of commands on his watch and the drone appeared from the depths of the plane. "Also, Jarvis says the explosives are not a threat. They'll need to be removed and disposed of, but they won't accidentally explode on us."
The moment the door closed behind him, Bucky was at his side. "Come on. Let's get you to bed. You need all the rest you can get before we go after Schmidt tomorrow."
Tony took in Steve's length, savoring the taste of pre-cum as his lover pushed into him. He could feel the head of Steve's cock in the back of his throat and he hummed in pleasure.
Howard scrutinized the mark. It was an 'S' in a script and the tail wound around the letter to form a circle. "Yes. He put this on several of his early inventions before he developed the Stark Industries logo."
"Captain, if it's the serum you're worried about, I assure you. It's safe with me." Bruce pushed his glasses back up his nose. "It's imperative we ensure your levels are all where they should be."
Only when Steve ended his third circuit of the room did Bucky reach out and grasp his arm. "Come on, let's check out the rest of the place. You can come back here later."
Bruce's brows furrowed for a moment before realization began to dawn on him. "He wouldn't have had a Dom if he had a soulmark."
"Grandpop made the chastity belt which Steve Rogers wore," Tony muttered before dropping to a stool. "If he made that, I can't help but wonder what else he did."
"Yeah, I know." Steve sighed. "Didn't want to ruin the evening last night, and he was so happy this morning."
"Morning, Son." Howard entered the exam room with a broad smile. Dinner the night before had gone well and when Tony left he seemed more relaxed than he'd seen him in weeks.
"Rogers, you went against my orders, commandeered a plane, jumped into a hot zone, and attacked a heavily fortified enemy base. You put a civilian in danger and jeopardized the well being of America's most expensive science experiment with your stunt. Therefore, I have arranged for our strongest Dom on base to see to your punishment."
Once Steve was out of sight, and he heard the shower running, Tony dropped his gift for Steve in his nightstand drawer. "Jarvis, place the order for dinner and have it ready in an hour."
"I'm fine. It's just ... Steve would have been spared so much pain if this had been on his wrist when he was in the Army."
Before Bucky could ask about it, the elevator opened and Steve and Tony joined them in the communal kitchen. The expression on Steve's face a complete opposite from the previous day.
Henderson stopped Steve with a tight grip to the back of his neck the moment they left Phillips' office. "You will follow six steps behind me. Keep your gaze on the ground. Don't talk to anyone. The moment we are in my quarters you will strip and kneel. Any deviation from these orders will result in swift and severe punishment. Am I understood?"
Howard smiled and dropped a hand to halt Tony's rubbing of his soulmark. "Thinking about them again?"
Steve grasped Tony's hand and pulled him up before pushing him down onto the bed. Tony scooted up towards the headboard and Steve followed on his knees, his lips finding Tony's again, pushing his tongue into his lover's mouth as he covered Tony with his body.
Howard and Maria continued their conversation as Howard rode the elevator to the garage. Both looked forward to an evening with Tony, something they didn't get to enjoy as often since Tony moved into Stark Tower upon his last college graduation.
Steve gasped for air as the memories of the cold surrounded him. He shuddered, his eyes distant as his heart raced. Without thought he pulled the feeding tube out and tossed it across the room.
"I have attempted to access the compound on multiple occasions with no success, Sir." Jarvis replied and Tony recognized the hint of frustration in his AI's voice.
"I spoke with him briefly about it. He assured me that he could handle it. Apparently, he and the Howling Commandos would give Rogers a chance to hit subspace during downtime on missions. They'd work in an extra day whenever possible, with Carter's help, so they could take care of Rogers. He had a Dom on base, but he wasn't taking care of Rogers the way he should have."
"I don't know what you're talking about." The last thing Steve wanted to do was dwell on bad memories.
When Tony looked up, his brows rose in surprise. Before them was a huge piece of metal sticking out of the ice and a man was walking on top of it. Moving past that, he noted more of the red lights making an outline on the ice. He was baffled at just how large this place apparently was.
"I'll find out about the others, but Howard Stark is dead." Bucky knew with certainty that knowing his tormentors were long dead would put Steve's mind at ease. He only hoped all three were no longer among the living.
"It's alright, Tony." Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist. "Whatever tech they have on-site I'm sure Natasha and Jarvis can handle, and Bruce will be on call."
"Yes ... no ... Kinda?" Tony moved around to the other side of the table. "This is a prototype. Had to make sure all the joints and everything would work right. We want it to be functional, but still light enough it's not going to put stress on your back or ribs so the final product will be made out of a different metal."
"As I said, I alone handled his care. Not everything made it into the file either. I figure he would rather be the one to decide if certain facts become known to the public." Bruce explained carefully, as he promised Tony he would.
"No. Although, I do need to find out when the procedure is going to be." Bucky drew in a deep breath. "What I wanted to tell you is where exactly we will be staying."
"All I wanted to do was come back here, pull this out, and slide right in." Steve whispered in Tony's ear as he played with the toy, relishing Tony's sounds of pleasure.
"You can go down here. Be careful. Reports said there were explosives on board and we don't know how stable they'll be."
Tony rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Well, guess I can't chat with him today. When he's available, send him a message that I need to meet with him for a bit and get the cast done. Sooner rather than later. Once I get it I can have his arm done in a day."
"I'm going to have so much fun with you." Henderson declared as he enjoyed taking in every inch of gloriously naked supersoldier. "Let's get started, shall we."
Once all five of them were on the ground, Coulson reported that they were in to those topside. Flipping on the high-powered flashlight, the deploying the small drone be brought so JARVIS could scan the structure, Tony began to look around.
"No, we aren't playing that game, Stevie." Bucky tapped the bottom of Steve's chin, a gesture which had Steve returning his attention to Bucky instead of the soft fibers of the blanket he sat on. "I won't let anyone hurt you. This is the safest place we can be right now. No one knows we're here except for a handful of people. We can keep it that way as long as we want until we're ready to face this crazy world we're now in."
Bucky sucked in a quick breath. "They dropped you, didn't they. Those fucking bastards. Dropped you and didn't bring you back up."
"Five miles south. It comes up beside a road. Found tire tracks. Already have Bruce going back through the satellite feeds, but there is no way to know when they left. They could be anywhere by now."
Steve, to his credit, didn't flinch. He was used to Henderson's theatrics, meant to throw him off balance but which rarely worked. "I'm sorry, Sir. Debrief ran longer than expected."
"Could be." Bruce stood, stretched, and yawned. "When you figure it out, can you send me the files? I'll deliver then to the guys next time I check in on them."
Once inside, Tony headed straight for the kitchen where he deposited the folders on the counter. He then ensured the fridge was fully stocked before peeking in both bedrooms to ensure the beds had been made and the bathrooms contained fresh towels. Only after a thorough inspection of each room did he allow Jarvis to take him to his floor.
Several moments later, Steve pulled out and helped Tony stand. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."
"We're working with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Strange. Our goal is to integrate the arm into your nervous system so you can sense temperatures and touch with it." Tony met Bucky's gaze. "We want it to be as much like a real arm as is possible. After everything you've done to for our country, this is the least I can do for you."
Moments later Jarvis chimed into the room. "Any previous injuries have healed, however, there is a ninety percent chance he will tear when it's removed."
"All we can do is our best. We'll find them, and we'll get them home." Tony pressed a kiss to Steve's forehead. "You okay?"
"You always know just what to make me for dinner." Bucky lifted one of the pieces of grilled cheese and took a bite. "This is delicious. You did so well for me."
As Steve drifted off again, this time into a deep sleep, Bucky whispered into his ear. "It's going to be alright, Steve. You're going to be okay. I've got you."
Bucky watched Steve as he slept. What had once been a peaceful sleep turned anything but in the last hour.
"Everyone is different, Son. It may be five days, or five years. You just have to have patience." Howard squeezed his son's shoulder.
"Guess it's a good thing their floor is ready." Tony peered into his lap and traced the faint outline of his soulmark that was slowly starting to appear. "How are his levels?"
"Sir, I'm fine. I'm leveled out. I don't need to go down." Steve finally managed to get a word in. Besides, he didn't
Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's waist, pulling him even closer against his body. When Steve pulled away to suck in a breath, Tony whispered in his ear, "Let's go. I can be late."
Tony detected a hint of a smile on his lover's face. "Just think, I'll be waiting for you when you get here. Still have all your cum in my ass from this morning, and this plug has been teasing my prostrate all day. I'm gonna need some amazing sex tonight."
"Sir is aware of Captain Rogers' artistic abilities and wanted to supply a room for him to use for such endeavors."
Soft music began to play over the built-in speakers and the lights dimmed to fifty percent through the penthouse while Jarvis adjusted the thermostat to bring the temperature up a couple of degrees.
"Care to stop beating around the bush and just spit it out?" Howard joined his son, resting his elbows on his knees as he peered at Tony. "Look, I know you found Barnes and Rogers. You had Jarvis call, as well as send me his and James Barnes' medical records after all."
"Get a life, kid." Tony threw open his door and jumped down to the snow-covered ice, pulling his thick coat tighter around him.
"My best guess? They couldn't stomach the fact that submissive took to the serum, came out like this, and is the only supersoldier out there. They probably didn't want subs to think they could gain power over Doms so changed his designation."
"The late Howard Stark began a search for the Valkyrie beginning the moment the war ended. When he passed away, his son, who helped found SHIELD, increased the efforts with their help. The Valkyrie was found due to a shift in the ice which uncovered a wing."
Steve watched as Tony pulled his pants down over his hips and to the floor. He stepped out of them and his breath caught in his throat as Tony kissed the head of his cock. His hands slid into Tony's hair as he sighed. "Tony."
Steve stared at Bruce for a long moment before silently agreeing. He wasn't sure why, but he wholly trusted Dr. Banner.
"Everything alright, Son?" Howard Stark Jr. asked as he crossed the room with furrowed brows, not missing the bag on the table.
"Alright, give me his ass. Once I'm done with it, you two can have your own fun." Henderson rounded the bench as Stark pulled his fist out, leaving Steve's hole gaping.
Pepper noted Tony rubbing at the pulse point on his left wrist, where the grey circle which made up the beginnings of his soulmark rested. He'd been rubbing at it lately. The small shape had been there as long as Pepper had known Tony, but neither spoke of it. Her employer, and friend, had spent years hoping it would develop into the bright colors and crisp shape which usually made up a soulmark, but it had yet to change. He was losing hope at ever finding his soulmate which was the reason he always wore long sleeves or a wide watch when in public. He didn't want the world to know he was a man with a soulmark and no soulmate.
Heat coursed through Steve as he pulled back and made quick work of Tony's suit jacket, tie, and shirt. He draped them over the back of a nearby chair before turning back to Tony who had was pushing his pants and boxers down in one swift motion.
"God, he feels so good!" Phillips began to thrust into Steve's mouth, slowly forcing the sub to take him deeper with each movement.
"Don't worry, Tony. I won't mention this to anyone, and if he asks about it I'll let him know I took care of it and leave it at that."
"It's really not that surprising. The landscape is changing all the time. You know, we don't really have the equipment for a job like this."
Steve followed, but when he realized what the room held he stopped in his tracks in sucked in a breath. The room was stocked with every imaginable art supply, and some Steve couldn't name. He slowly began to walk around to room, his fingers ghosting over some to the supplies.
Steve grasped the back of Bucky's shirt as the elevator began to move. Whether it was from fear, uncertainty, or simply Steve's submissive side finally coming out again Bucky wasn't sure. Upon reaching their floor, Bucky led Steve out of the elevator and into the foyer. The space was larger than their apartment in Brooklyn before the war.
Tony drew in a deep breath, plastered on his trademark smile, and strode forward to shake Bucky's hand. "Good to meet you, Bucky. Shall we get started?"
Steve's eyes rounded as Tony opened the box. Nestled inside was the most gorgeous ring Steve had ever laid eyes on. It looked to be made of silver and gold marble inlaid with blue and red gemstones. Tears welled in his eyes as he met Tony's gaze. "You amazing, wonderful, kind, generous, loving man. Of course, the answer is yes. Three thousand times yes!"
Howard waited until his son disappeared in the elevator before letting out a relieved breath. "Jarvis, call Maria."
"It just doesn't sit right with me. We're missing something and my gut is telling me it's a critical piece of information."
"Night, Dad." Tony headed for the elevator, carefully not peeking into Barnes' and Rogers' room. Although it was still a bit early, he instructed Jarvis to let Pepper know he was unavailable for the rest of the evening and she could go home. Once in his private space, he turned up the music, had Jarvis pull up the necessary information, and got to work on Bucky's arm.
"What?" Howard snagged a pair of gloves and slipped them on before lifting the device. "Wanna tell me why there was a chastity device in medical?"
Unfortunately, he wasn't able to keep hs promises and ended up caring for Steve several times over, each time they returned from the field. The only relief came when the two men followed Schmidt onto his plane, crashing it into the icy waters before it could destroy New York.
When they reached the elevator, the doors were open and waiting for them. "Jarvis, to our apartment please."
Tony shrugged before slipping on his pants, both going commando underneath as neither planned to leave their rooms any time soon.
"Save my work and shut it down, J." Tony stood and strode for the elevator, snagging the three files on his desk on the way out. "Take me to Rogers' floor."
Henderson led the way, Steve remaining the required number of steps behind him. As they passed through the center of the base, Steve heard Peggy call out to him. Thankfully, though, they reached Henderson's quarters before she could make her way through the crowd to talk to him. He knew she would have questions later and wasn't looking forward to the discussion.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Tony tweaked Steve's nipples again, eliciting a moan of pleasure.
"And he loves you. Which is why you should share with him why you're struggling with this mission. He's worried about you, I can see it in his eyes."
Sighing, watching his quiet evening go out the window, he picked up his phone, "You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark."
!" Tony gestured angrily to the items now scattered across the top of his workbench. "I mean look at this, Dad. How the hell could anyone think locking him up in
Howard slipped in beside Tony as the doors closed and the elevator rose to the penthouse. "How are you doing, Son? I haven't seen much of you the last few days."
Steve leaned against the back of the elevator and his eyes drifted closed for the few moments it took to get to their floor.
His gaze fixed on Steve, Bucky's brows furrowed for a moment as he sifted through his memories. His memories were mostly back, but some were still a bit fuzzy. This particular one, however, was clear as day. "Oh, Stevie."
Hours later, Steve entered Henderson's quarters, stripped off and folded his uniform, and sank to his knees. He was already dreading tonight's session, and a quick glance around the room caused that feeling to increase. Based on the items laid out, it was going to be a long, painful night.
"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line," JARVIS reported as the armor began to be stripped off TOny.
"It'll take us some time to go over what intel we found. Relax, Cap. We'll call you when we've got something." Natasha clapped Steve on the back as she passed.
"I have never in my life seen such a large bed!" Bucky exclaimed as they stepped back through the bedroom and headed for the hall.
"Jarvis." Bruce moved quickly to the side of the bed. He didn't wait for the AI to respond, instead keeping his entire focus on his patient.
When the elevator stopped, Tony pushed off the wall and strode through the open doors of his lab, tossing the trash bag to a worktable on his way to the coffee maker in the corner.
Henderson came to Steve's side and grasped his cock. Although Steve couldn't see his face, he knew Henderson was grinning as he squeezed Steve's cock painfully.
Noting the pain lines, Bruce administered a dose of pain meds while he answered. "Yes. Captain Rogers is in the bed on the other side of the curtain. We found no injures, although we suspect any were healed by the serum years ago."
"First, call me Bucky. And second, I'm going over there with or without your help. So unless you want me injuring myself further, I suggest you help me."
Although he wished to grab a sketch pad and settle into the armchair to draw, Steve nodded and reluctantly followed Bucky from the room.
"Got on a plane and headed west. Jarvis is tracking the flight and will let me know when he finds it."
Bucky squeezed once more before releasing Steve and heading for the door. As they entered the hallway, Bucky was thankful it was deserted, not a person was in sight.
"I didn't even know Pops got his hands on any of that," Howard muttered as he went in search of the tools they would need to separate the metal from the leather.
"Yeah, but what about the women they've taken? Will we be in time to save them? Or are we already too late?"
"Been working on the prototype for Barnes' arm. I still have a few tweaks to it, but it'll be ready by tomorrow."
Tony laughed as Steve's stomach grumbled again before reaching for the shampoo. "Alright, alright. We're coming."
"He never had a soulmark. In all the years I've known him, and we met when we were kids, he never once had the slightest bit of grey on his wrist. Why would he have one now?"
"Hey, Punk. You're never going to guess what happened to us." Bucky took Steve's hand but froze when a patch of grey caught his eye. "What's this?"
"Come on. You're covered in sweat and I'm sure you're hungry too." Tony tugged Steve inside and to the elevator. Jarvis began the ascent to their floor without a word.
"The icy water put us into some type of cryostasis or sleep. I won't pretend to understand or explain what that means. But, know this, we are seventy years in the future."
"Right, small sips. You don't want to start with too much." Bruce held a straw to Bucky's lips and allowed him to drink. "How do you feel?"
Tony smiled softly at the joy on Rogers' face. He was still working on Bucky's arm when Jarvis asked him if he could answer Rogers' question about who found he and Barnes in the ice. Tony agreed without hesitation but then asked Jarvis to bring up the live feed from the soldier's room.
"We already suspect he was taken advantage of. No, scratch that, he was abused. Dad's going through Grandpop's old diaries to see what else he can learn about his involvement."
By time they arrived in New York, the ice around the soldiers was mostly melted. Once they were in the medical wing, they would be separated. Doctor Cho would handle Barnes and get him into surgery as soon as possible while Bruce would oversee things with Rogers.
Deciding there was no other way to broach the subject, Bucky chose to simply rip off the bandaid so to speak. "Steve, we were frozen in the Valkarie for seventy years."
Bucky allowed Steve several minutes to peruse the room, a small smile on his face. Tony would never understand what this room would come to mean to Steve.
A jet settled on the landing pad outside and Coulson led the way through the penthouse with Tony on his heels.
"Huh? Oh, well, you know me. I can't do anything halfway." Tony chuckled and moved to stand beside his dad. His hand ghosted over the metal arm. "Once I got started, I wanted to get as many details in there as I could. Besides, how do we know if it'll work the way we want if I only do the minimal work?"
"No, Stark. I wouldn't call an assemble if it were only a suspicion." Natasha knew better than to interrupt Steve and Tony unless it was a necessity. "When the call came in, I asked Jarvis to do some digging. He managed to pull up satellite images from the last two months. There is a steady stream of trucks going into the compound."
Although expecting the intrusion, Steve couldn't hold back the whimper of pain as Stark shoved into him.
Later that evening, Tony curled around Steve in their bed. It wasn't late, and neither was exceptionally tired, but Tony recognized Steve needed the comfort. Something about the mission still didn't sit right with Steve and was making him anxious.
Reluctant to leave Steve, but sure he needed at least a sponge bath, Bucky agreed. "Any chance I can shower?"
After considering his response for several moments, Tony closed his eyes. "I'm not really sure. Something other than Rogers' designation has me out of sorts, but I can't figure out what it is."
Understanding his patient's dislike for the medical bay, Bruce shook his head. "I can bring what I need to you."
"Steve, I need to clean you up." Bucky shifted Steve so he lay on his side, then climbed over him and knelt on the floor. Dipping a rag in the warm water, Bucky began to clean the blood and cum off of Steve's front. Although the lacerations were relatively shallow, there were a lot of them. As he worked, Bucky noted many of them were already healing and he couldn't help but wonder what all was affected when Steve went through the procedure.
When they reached the common floor, Bucky turned to Steve before stopping out. "He's not going to love you any less, or see you any differently."
"How are they, Bruce." Tony looked through the glass in the door to peer at their two guests before leaning against the wall. Barnes had been awake for six days now, but Rogers had yet to show signs of waking. A fact which bothered Tony more than he would admit.
The lights automatically came on, lighting up the large, open space. Steve stopped two steps behind him and gasped at the sight. Across from the door was what appeared to be the living room and through the glass wall, they had a clear view of New York City.
"Hey." Steve dropped to the couch beside his best friend, noting the cushion had been put away while he was cleaning up.
Steve sucks in a deep breath before releasing it slowly. "A couple of years before I joined the Army, I was walking home from the grocery store. It was early evening, but cloudy so darker than usual."
"Neither do I." Tony beamed when Steve met his gaze and realized Tony was talking about him. "Come on, let's eat."
One hand grasped Steve's neck as the other reached to the nightstand and snagged the lube they kept handy. Passing it to Steve, Tony lay his feet flat on the bed and his knees fell to the sides as Steve rose to his knees between Tony's thighs.
"Sir. A package from Wakanda was delivered ten minutes ago. Miss Potts placed it in the vault in your private lab." Jarvis informed them.
Bucky's gaze followed Steve as his best friend paced the back of the quinjet. Noting Tony was deep in discussion with Jarvis, he walked silently to the back. "Hey, you okay?"
"No, I'm fine. Just still wrapping my mind around having a soulmate." Steve lay back on his pillows, positioning his arm so he could stare at the grey space on the inside of his left forearm. Upon spotting the mark the previous night, Steve had burst into tears, only stopping when he cried himself to sleep in Bucky's arms. Thankfully the doctor was finishing up his work when Steve spotted it.
Tony gasped as Steve pulled the plug out and set it on the shelf in the shower before plunging two fingers into Tony's hole.
His heart dropped as Bucky spotted Steve, curled up under a thin blanket on his too-small bed. Steve's body trembled and Bucky heard him breathing erratically. Rushing to the bed, he dropped to a knee.
"Few hours ago." Bucky sidled up to Natasha, wrapped an arm around her waist, and kissed her temple.
"No change. His vitals are all normal, he doesn't seem to be in any pain, and all of Jarvis' scans are coming back with normal results. The best I can guess ..." Bruce shrugged. "He's just not ready to wake up yet."
"Excuse me?" Something wasn't adding up for Bruce. But then he remembered the history of Captain America and realized they couldn't be talking about the same Stark. "Are you referring to Howard Stark?"
Tony shed his clothes and tossed them into the dirty clothes basket as soon as he entered the bathroom. Facing the shower, Tony froze and simply stared through the glass. Steve stood below the hot stream of water, hands braced on the wall and head under the spray. "God, you're gorgeous!"
Steve kept his eyes closed as Bucky gave him a bite of grilled cheese. He chewed slowly, relishing the calm that settled over him over the last hour. He continued to float as Bucky fed him, letting him know when he switched from one item to the next, offering small sips of the flavored water in between. His focus remained on Bucky, the soft words spoken, the care with which Bucky fed him. Nothing else in the world mattered, only this small space in which Bucky knew what he needed and gave it to him in heaps.
"I'm afraid not. You're in good hands now, though. Tony will make sure you get the best medical care Stark Industries has to offer."
Steve set a fast pace, aware it wouldn't be long before Tony would need to leave and wanting to bring him as much pleasure as possible in the short amount of time they had.
While he waited, Tony rolled Rogers onto his side to examine the rest of the equipment. His gut clenched when he spotted an anal plug attached to the bottom of the belt.
"Rogers. My office. Now!" Phillips ordered as the men of the 107th made their way towards the medical area. They would be thoroughly occupied for a while as they looked over all the men Rogers brought back from Azzano.
"Yeah, well, that probably would have been hard to do since he blew over half of it off." Bucky blew out a breath. Choosing to focus on something else, he peered at Bruce. "Did you find Stevie?"
"Not only will he see to your punishment, but he will ensure your hormone levels are evened out by dropping you."
"Let's just see what we find, shall we?" Tony clipped onto the line which would lower them into the belly of the beast.
"Romanov, Barton, good to see you again." Tony greeted the two SHIELD agents as he came to stand between the pilot and co-pilot seats, placing a hand on the back of each. "Let's go see what they've found, shall we?"
Steve thrust back into Tony. Hoping he could bring Tony to orgasm quickly so as not to leave him hanging.
After several long moments of silent contemplation, Steve nodded his head. "Fine, but the first time something feels off, we're finding our own place."
Tony headed for the elevator and yawned again as it lifted him to his apartment. He went through the motions of readying for bed on autopilot.
"Then yes, I agree to submit to the tests later this week." Steve slid off his bed and shoved his hands in his pockets. "Can we go now?"
Tony Stark stared at the coffee maker, wondering why he hadn't upgraded the machine to brew faster. After a long night in bed enjoying his boyfriend, the last thing he wanted was to be awake. Alas, Pepper had been hounding him about the meeting today and he couldn't miss it. So, coffee would have to do the trick and keep him awake.
Pushing back to meet Steve's thrusts, Tony was unable to decide which was better. The fact he could feel every inch of Steve's long, thick dick in his ass as he kept up a brutal pace and Steve's grip on his cock working him in time with his thrusts were both equally pleasurable.
"Sure, let me just wrap up your shoulder. The stitches need to stay in for a couple more days." Bruce rummaged in a drawer for the needed supplies and quickly wrapped Bucky's shoulder. "I brought fresh clothes for you too."
Bucky left Steve to his work, allowing him the chance to begin the slow slide into subspace. He snagged the folders off the counter and peered inside on his way to the couch, quickly closing them once he noted the contents and placed them on a shelf in the living room to show to Steve tomorrow. Today was for dropping Steve into subspace and allowing him to drift for a while. The files would do quite the opposite.
Steve and Tony entered operations command hand in hand. The rest of the team was already assembled, and after narrowing her eyes at the two men, Natasha launched into the mission brief.
While Henderson and Stark spit-roasted Steve, Phillips took great pleasure in shocking Steve around his clamped nipples, along his arms and legs, but mostly along Steeve's cock, balls, and hole whenever Henderson pulled out for a fraction of a second. The electric shocks to his rim and inside his hole proved the most painful and would cause Steve to gag around the dick in his throat.
"Well, at least one of them is. Must be the ice." Bruce knelt beside them and scrutinized the ice around them. "We need to get them out of here and warmed up."
Sighing, Tony closed his eyes and forced himself to calm down. "I have one other question for you, well, two. For now anyway."
"You'll learn soon enough. If your mark is taking shape then you're getting closer to meeting them. It shouldn't be long before your names mark each other's skin as well."
Bruce knelt to look over what he could see of the two men. Sergeant Barnes was laying on the ground and Captain Rogers was draped over his right side. Barnes' left side was buried under the ice so they could only see the right side of his face. It appeared as though Rogers was protecting Barnes as much as possible. "Tony, can you have Jarvis scan them? I just want to make sure nothing is going to blow up when we try and move them."
"Oh, Stevie. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you from this." Bucky whispered, trying to keep his tears at bay when Steve moaned in pain at every touch to his sensitive skin.
Steve used two fingers to catch some of the cum dripping from Tony's ass and used it to lube the plug. He then gently pressed it into Tony, pulling another moan of pleasure from him. "You know I'm going to have a hard time thinking about anything but your gorgeous ass now."
Bucky noted the direction of Steve's gaze and released a slow breath. "Before I tell you, I want to you remember that you did everything you could. You saved my life, Steve."
"We can worry about that once we get back. We need to load up and get out of here. Can we start warming them on the jet?" Coulson asked as he followed the crew carrying the stretcher.
Maneuvering his way through the city, Tony reported in. "Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you."
"Thanks, Jarvis." Tony sagged against the back wall of the elevator. He could guess who was waiting for him, only one other person had full access to his lab without going through Jarvis.
"Hey! Look at me." Bucky put as much authority in his voice as possible. When Steve reluctantly met his gaze he squeezed the man's hand. "It was practically blown off in the fight. You did everything you could to protect me, and you actually saved my life. When the Valkarie went into the ocean you laid on top of me and protected me as much as you were able. If you hadn't been with me, I would be dead."
"Nah, Pepper's both M and Moneypenny—" Tony broke off, remembering how many Bond girls had turned out to be traitorous – or dead.
The man who had designed it sat slumped on a tool chest, leaning his back against the wall, with three very odd machines clustered around him like giant dogs. He had a full highball glass of some amber liquid clutched in both hands, and the whole room stank of alcohol.
Thor grinned, and loosed the hammer and Tony in a single motion. Steadying himself on his repulsors, Tony sent a missile following Mjolnir.
Only one of the players was distressingly familiar. He had plainly drunk too much tonight. He was seeing Avengers everywhere...
"Captain Rogers is listening to this conversation," Jan warned him with a touch of amusement. "He's with Colonel Danvers, from AFOSI. The guys who abducted you are under arrest, or will be when they wake up."
They halted and bowed their heads slightly in a gesture of respect – or possibly fear. Not a single one showed any surprise.
He'd updated the Rescue armour into a backpack version and with Rhodey's good offices as peacemaker, he and Pepper were back on even keel. And if the number he'd given her had been to a cell dedicated to her, so she didn't interfere with his work – well, she didn't need to know that.
"Odd that you had a response team there. Even odder that there should be a gamma-radiating monster waiting for me too."
Washington was overhung with low clouds emitting heavy drizzle. From Tony's view was useful as it meant that few people were looking up at the sky. Furthermore, the rain wasn't heavy enough for its displacement around the stealth armour to be noticeable. He should be perfectly invisible. Nor did he need to get inside the Triskelion, SHIELD's Washington base. Instead, he trusted to his improved stealth tech and hovered a few hundred yards from the perimeter before reaching out with Extremis. Once he's made contact with the servers he flicked through machine designations, dismissing cell phones and laptops until he discovered the personnel database.
Tony stepped out of the elevator and into an atmosphere of high tension. The security team behind the main reception desk on its raised marble platform were all on their feet, hands in view, well away from their holstered Stark specials. The reason they had not drawn those pistols was clear: men and women in combat gear (without any identifiable insignia) were placed strategically throughout the room. They all had guns too, modern assault weapons; at least three H&K G36s, a Hammer Widowmaker (bad choice, that), four M4 carbines and, even, damn it, a Stark SI2300 sub machine gun. No civilian would be carrying one of those in New York.
But Howard hadn't finished. "The other important secret held here concerns your shield. As you are aware, the steel it is made of contains a new element. There are stories circulating, which I have encouraged, that the steel is natural and meteoric; this is not the case. The element – which I have not named for reasons which will now become clear – was given to me specifically for your use. And not by an American. It has spectacular properties. I have analysed its atomic structure and, perhaps, in the future, someone will be able to synthesise it. Or perhaps those with access to a natural source will make themselves known."
Steve would give a lot to hear that story, but he didn't know Pepper well enough to ask, and mention of Coulson still brought an angry response from Tony. There was something he wanted to know that he could ask her, though, given that answer. "I would have liked to have gone to his funeral but I guess I can't complain as I was deliberately out of touch. What about you? And the other Avengers?"
No camera view, no readings from the HUD, yes, the same, but this time there was no Jarvis in his ear, no hissing of servos, no sound but muffled voices and far-away thunder. The armour, immovable, held him fast in its grasp. Weapons systems, repulsors; nothing answered his command.
"I texted Bambi to cancel that when Jack agreed to give me a lift," she explained, waving a hand at the bemused-looking craggy-faced man who had followed her out.
Tony lifted himself on his elbows and peered down at him. "Why not?" he asked. "I mean, there are all sorts of reasons why not, but you've been pretty enthusiastic until... What is it then? Sudden attack of 1940s' morality?
By then Danvers was pulling a bunch of cable ties from her pocket. As Steve helped her secure their prisoners – not that they would be waking up any time soon – Jan's voice said, through Steve's earbud, "I'm going in to assess Storm's situation."
"I didn't know that last," Jan said gently. "But this time he was with Thor. Short of being there yourself, that's the best protection he could have." She paused, her eyes resting on Steve's face.
"Bast? If that is still your name? What do you do here? Have you hidden this little kingdom since before my birth?"
Sorry this has been so, so long in arriving, folk. It got totally stuck at 2,000 words and refused to budge. I will try to do better.
"I think I could have gotten him in," Danvers said. "But, to be honest, I just meant to tip him off. And I expected to find Jim here."
"Pay heed to my mother, Captain," Thor said, with a bow in Frigga's direction. "You can see that she rules even in my own house."
Below him, the jungle was coming to noisy life as evening darkened about him. It was a primeval landscape, empty of technology and human life...
Tony propped himself up on his elbows, and saw that the Ancient One was sitting on the floor a few feet away, one hand clasping the amulet containing the Time Stone, the other pressed to her forehead. He caught Natasha's eye and nodded towards the Ancient One, even as the nanites swarmed over his back, down his legs and up his arms.
"We've got o go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow, I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings."
Steve stared at Bucky, at first not understanding the significance until he replayed Buck's words in his mind. He gasped and his eyes widened in fear at the name Stark. "No. No, no, no ... Buck, I can't!"
"Henderson, meet Steve Rogers. I need you to punish him for disobeying orders and being reckless. Also, make sure he goes down for a while. I can't have an unstable supersoldier Sub walking around my base."
"Hold up, Stevie. There is still something we need to chat about before we go." Bucky settled on the edge of Steve's bed, and patted the mattress to encourage Steve to join him.
Startling, Steve's eyes scanned the room noting only a small light by the door was on and Bucky lay sound asleep in the bed next to him. They were the only two people in the room. He started to ask who was speaking when he remembered Bucky and Dr. Banner introducing him to the tower's AI.
"But I've been sleeping for seventy years." Steve pinned Bucky with his gaze, a hint of a smile on his face despite the multitude of emotions.
Pushing aside his concern for the team above ground, Steve moved in sync with Bucky as they made their way down the dirt tunnel. Turning a corner, a fine mist surrounded them.
One wall held every possible color of oil paint, canvas in varying sizes and shapes, and an easy was set up by the large window which allowed in plenty of light. Along the opposite wall, he found colored pencils, charcoal, pastels, and sketchbooks of various sizes and types. Finally, in the corner was a sink where one could clean supplies, as well as a mini-fridge, a small armchair, and a side table.
Not caring where they stayed, as long as they had privacy and safety, Bucky shifted the conversation. "You said Steve was in here?"
"I wonder ..." Tony swiped the hologram of Bucky's arm away and began typing on the touchscreen tabletop in front of him.
Finding towels folded on the countertop with a change of clothes, and the shower fully stocked with toiletries, Steve turned on the water to warm up before seeking out the shaving kit. He took his time, relishing in the seemingly endless hot water as it massaged his muscles, relaxing him even more if that was even possible.
"So perfect, Stevie." Bucky ran his fingers through Steve's hair, pleased to note his best friend was already well under.
Agreeing, Bucky shut the bathroom door and slipped out of the hospital gown. When he slipped under the hot spray, he sighed.
"Sir wishes for the residents to feel at home which can only happen when they have been assured of their privacy."
"Hold on just a minute. Are you telling me you pulled me out of sex with Steve for a suspicion?" Tony crossed his arms in frustration.
"Good, now that he's plugged let's get to the real fun." Henderson moved back to the table and came back with nipple clamps with sharp teeth.
Steve blinked his eyes open at the soft command. With more effort than it should have taken, he released his death-grip on the blanket, burying his face into the thin pillow and trying to suppress a groan of pain.
"So what you're telling me is that it might be another three months before I learn for sure who my soulmate is?"
"There you are. How do you feel?" Bucky brushed back a stray lock of Steve's hair as the other man considered the answer. "You may speak now."
Steve chuckled as he reached in front of Bucky to the fruit bowl for an apple. Natasha grasped his wrist before it reached the bowl and he turned to her in confusion.
"You're delivery from Wakanda has arrived. Happy is putting it in your lab." Pepper looked up to meet Tony's gaze. "Would you like to tell me what King T'Challa is mailing you?"
"We've been watching them for hours. There is no indication of any vehicles left in the last few days. How did they slip past us?"
"Tunnels." Clint shook his head as he approached his teammates. "Buried deep under the kitchen. Only found it when I went in the basement and looked around more closely."
When they entered the living room, Steve stopped and peered at the coffee table. It was set with two covered dishes, a large bowl of salad, a basket of rolls, a bottle of their favorite wine, and two large pieces of chocolate cake. "Tony?"
"Anything yet?" Clint perched on the counter beside Natasha as she peered at a tablet and sipped coffee.
Tony strode across the lab to the coffee pot and frowned when only a few drops were left. "I still need a cast of Barnes' shoulder so I can get the new arm right. Is he available?"
"Perfect. I'll get everything set up and see you all tomorrow." Tony pushed off the wall and headed for the elevator.
"God, Tony. You're so fucking tight!" Steve pulled out until just the head of his cock remained in Tony before plowing all the way back in, angling his hips to hit Tony's prostate. "Gonna fill you up. Maybe I'll even plug you so you remember who you belong to when you're in your meeting."
His limbs loose, his mind calm, and his head floating, Steve barely heard the command. When it was repeated his eyes open and he peered up at Bucky who gazed back at him with a wide smile.
"That's the hope. But we aren't making any promises. At the very least, it will respond to your commands and move like your right arm." Howard smiled, thrilled at Bucky's reaction to the limb.
"We should probably finish up in here so I can feed you." Tony sighed, hugging Steve tightly and laying his head on Steve's shoulder.
"Steve." Tony whimpered as Steve pulled the plug halfway out before sliding it back in with a quick thrust. "Ah!"
"Yeah. Clint's pushing it to get back. I don't like the fact we couldn't do anything to help those women, and he knows it's put me in a bad mood."
Bucky peered to his right where a man with a kind smile and curly brown hair stood by medical equipment.
son is the one who designed and built this tower. He lives in the penthouse. He is also the one who is building me my new arm." Releasing some of the pressure on Steve's hand, Bucky rubbed Steve's arm in a comforting gesture. "Tony is kind, and generous, and has promised not to set foot in our apartment, or to even introduce himself to you without your express permission and only after we have settled in."
"Sir has allocated a floor for your living quarters," Jarvis announced. "If you'll place your hand on the security panel to the right of the door, I'll add your biometrics into my system."
Bucky looked around Steve's sparse tent. The dwelling held a single bed, a desk and chair, and a small trunk. He would need to get some supplies but didn't think he could leave Steve. But first, he needed to assess the damage. "Steve, I need to see."
Steve's muscles went rigid at the mention of a doctor. He swallowed hard and his words came out in a whisper. "Buck ... I can't ..."
Once in the kitchen, Steve contemplated the shiny appliance for a long moment before deciding to wash the few dishes in the sink, it was familiar and he could easily figure out how to work it, unlike the machine. Once everything was clean and returned to its rightful place, Steve headed to the massive bathroom off his bedroom.
Steve slowly crawled to the chair where his uniform sat waiting for him. On trembling legs, he stood and dressed. He slipped his feet into his boots, not bothering to tie them as he only had to make it to his bunk. Without a backward glance, he opened the door and stumbled into the early morning.
Tony pulled his phone out and scrolled through Twitter as the elevator took them from the Avenger's levels of the tower to the executive offices of Stark Industries. They were almost to the board room when Pepper's cell indicated a message. She paused and Tony, not wanting to face the demanding board alone paused to wait for her.
Steve glared at the man, allowing all his anger and frustration in the situation to be clear, even if only for a moment.
"She was mentioning just this morning how much she misses making homemade pizza with you." Howard offered his son a slight smile, expertly wielding his secret weapon. "I bet you would make her day if you came over and cooked with her."
"You did, Buddy. You saved me and hundreds of others." Bucky carded his fingers through Steve's hair. When Steve melted into his touch, Bucky wanted to cry. "I'm going to take care of you, Stevie. You did good, real good. And now I'm going to take care of you until you're safe again. Okay?"
"Think he can take you up to your elbow?" Phillips traced Steve's rim with his fingers, amazed at the stretch.
Clint landed the jet smoothly and shut it down as the ramp lowered. Steve sighed as he stood, lifted his shield from where it was propped against the seat next to him and turned toward the exit. The familiar form of Tony waiting for him at the end of the ramp brought a hint of a smile to his face.
"Hey, let's get you showered and relaxed. I'll check in with her in a couple of hours and help if they need me. For now, though, how about a shower?"
"Get your ass in here and shut the flap. Have everyone else stand guard outside. No one comes near here." Bucky ordered, his gaze shifting back to Steve who whimpered below him.
A knock at the door distracted Henderson for a moment, and Steve closed his eyes and swallowed. The only reason someone would approach Henderson's quarters right now would be if he planned to share. When Phillips and Stark strode in and the door locked behind them, Steve swallowed hard. The package Stark left by the door only brought dread. Those packages never meant anything good for Steve.
"Well, you see, that's a bit of a long story." Bucky shifted on the edge of the bed and took Steve's hand in his.
to fix the coffee pot on our floor," Tony muttered as he sunk into an empty seat, sighing in contentment at the first sip and Steve's presence at his side.
Tony proceeded to gently clean Rogers up, then Bruce checked for tearing. Miraculously, there was only a small bit that appeared to already be healing, even if it would take some time.
Tony moaned and pressed the heel of his hand to his growing erection. The thought of having Steve Rogers at his feet, willingly submitting to him, had him aching to make it so.
in the medial realm, but they had yet to decipher what exactly what. Natasha was working with Bruce and Jarvis to upload all the electronic files on the premises to the secure Avengers servers, but they weren't hopeful. There didn't seem to be much to go on. Clint was doing a final sweep of the compound. They found a whole building with cells in them. Evidence indicated several women were kept in each, but there was no sign of anyone in the entire compound.
Around Rogers' waist was a leather and metal belt. From that, another metal band crossed from front to back through his crotch. Tony hoped he was wrong in what he suspected he would find when he removed it.
"Understandable." Tony shoved his hands into his pocket. "I can bring down the equipment down tonight. I have a meeting with R&D in the morning, but we can get started after lunch if that works for everyone."
"I hope so. It's killing me knowing there is someone out there for me and not knowing who they are."
Shaking his head in amusement, Bruce headed for his floor. As he readied himself for bed, he asked Jarvis to wake him should Rogers or Barnes need him. He hoped, though, that both would sleep peacefully through the night.
"Wonderful. Well, it's gotta come out." Tony detached the anal plug from the belt before pouring a generous amount of lube into his hand and spread it around the cock cage in the front before gently easing Rogers out of it. Once that was accomplished, he poured more lube into his hand and gently worked some around Rogers' hole. Grasping the plug with one hand, Tony pulled it out a small bit before covering the exposed part in a generous amount of lube. Slowly pushing it back in a couple of times go push the lube inside, Tony then pulled it out more. "Fuck!"
"Scan complete." The door before them opened. "When you're ready to set your security protocols, I will be happy to assist."
Bruce realized he should have explained things a bit more. "You and Captain Rogers were frozen in the ice for almost seventy years, Sergeant Barnes. It's 2012."
"Tony, what's this?" Bruce had just stripped Steve of his wet uniform in order to dry and warm him more and was beyond surprised at what he found beneath it.
"Of course." Tony led Steve towards the couch set up in the corner and tugged him down to sit beside him.
As his eyes closed and he fell into a deep sleep, he began to dream of running his fingers through Rogers' golden locks as the other man knelt at his feet.
"If you're making me a new arm, might as well call me Bucky." Bucky shook the man's hand, astounded at how much this Howard resembled his father. He had to remind himself that they weren't the same man.
"Let's find out." Stark withdrew his hand to the tip of his fingers before pushing his arm in up to his elbow in one brutal thrust.
"Sergeant Barnes, come on in." Howard strode forward and offered his hand. "I'm Howard Stark Jr. It's a pleasure to meet you."
"They were probably sharing body heat and got frozen together. I'll have support get down here to give us a hand." Natasha carefully made her way across the ice-covered floor of the plane to where the ropes they used to get inside still hung.
"I told him you wanted to make pizza with him," Howard admitted, knowing full well he was tricking his son.
"It was a bust. The place was cleaned out when we got there." Natasha frowned. "Something about it got to Steve though."
"Mind if I try out that new wand Stark made you?" Phillips lifted the small device from the table, amazed at what Howard made.
"Yeah. Mission was a bust. Everyone was gone when we got here. Only thing left was a single computer, medical equipment, and empty cells. They bugged out through a tunnel. Jarvis and Bruce tracked them to a plane they're trying to locate."
"Thanks, Jarvis." Steve tossed the dirty towel into the basket before taking the offered sleep pants from Tony. "You were prepared."
"Yeah. Just needed to tell you. I know you noticed I've been off since all this started and I don't want to keep anything from you."
"You get many other visitors out her?" Coulson asked. He heard Tony's and Clint's laughter behind him despite the wind.
Clint, Natasha, and Bucky followed the tunnel to the end. When they came out the other side, there were tire tracks heading in both directions down the road. Tony and Sam followed the road in opposite directions, searching for their missing Captain.
Bucky stood, offering a hand to Steve and pulling him up from the training mat. The two supersoldiers had been training for over an hour and Bucky could still see the tension in Steve's shoulders.
"Captin Rogers. You are in New York. The date is April third, two-thousand and two, and four twenty in the morning. The sky is slightly overcast and sixty-two degrees."
Ignoring the archer, Steve carried Tony to the elevator. Only when the doors closed behind them did either of them speak again.
The door at the end of the hall opened into a large master bedroom with a bathroom. The white tile brought plenty of light to the room and Bucky wondered who in the world would need such a large tub or a shower which could easily hold five grown adults and still have room. Back in the bedroom, they found two walk-in closets, as well as a third closet that could be used for storage.
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this ..." Tony sucked in a deep breath and fixed his gaze on his Iron Man armor across the room.
"Buck!" Steve wrapped both arms around Bucky and held on tightly. His heart was still racing from the events from the Valkarie. He thought Bucky had died in his arms.
Tony exited the elevator, case in hand, and strode directly for the room where they were going to do the scans and tests for Barnes' new arm. Setting the case on one of the tables, Tony headed for the coffee pot in the corner of the room, thankful someone brewed a pot. He sighed on the first swallow.
"What all do you want to do?" Steve recognized the doctor as the man who was at his bedside when he woke but was still wary of the stranger.
"Tsk, tsk." Stark shook his head as he stood at Steve's head. "You're supposed to remain silent." Stark pressed into Steve's throat with one snap of his hips, grinning when Steve gagged.
Steve closed his eyes and drew in several deep breaths to help calm his racing heart. "No, I'm fine."
"Like someone blew off my arm." Bucky dropped his head back to the pillow and closed his eyes. "Yes, well, unfortunately, that appeared to be the case. I'm sorry to say ... we had to amputate what remained of your arm. You would have died had we not."
"Can you imagine what the world is going to say when they find the Dom who essentially put an end to World War Two?" Their driver commented. "I mean, I know I've looked up to the man since I was a kid. Always wanted to be as strong as him. Books say he's the highest Dom on the charts, in the history of ... like ... ever!"
"Yeah, Baby. Fill my ass. Give it all to me!" Tony encouraged, wanting nothing more than to feel Steve pulsing inside of him.
Steve swallowed hard as they approached the base. He wasn't looking forward to debrief, or what would come after.
Clint's laughter carried across the room to them as Steve carried Tony towards their room. "Why do they even bother getting out of bed."
"Tony! There you are. You're late." Pepper sighed when she spotted him at the edge of the landing pad. She sighed when she noted the jet's absence and Tony's pout. "Steve get called out?"
"Come on, let's head back to the kitchen. I'm starting to get hungry." Bucky led the way back down the hall. "I want you to look through the cabinets and find something to make for dinner. Something simple. We'll eat in the living room."
"But I've got Cho. She can help with Barnes' arm." Tony didn't mention that he didn't trust SHIELD with the men. "Besides, I think I can build him a new arm."
Bucky ducked into Steve's private tent, glad for the chance to speak with his best friend. He, and the rest of the 107th, were required to be cleared by medical, and by the time they were done, Steve was nowhere to be found. He finally spotted Steve ducking into a tent a few minutes ago. "Hey, Stevie. Where'd you disappear to? The guys wanted ..."
The fact Stark included a den on their floor spoke volumes to Bucky as to the character of the man. "This will be your room, I think."
"I should be asking you that. You're the one that hung off the side of a moving train." Steve clenched his fists at the mention of Bucky's close call with death.
Hours later, as Steve snuggled into him, deeply asleep, Bucky vowed he would never let anything like this happen to his best friend again.
"So, do you think they've finally found Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes?" Banner wondered, looking from Tony to Coulson.
The massive television on the wall came to life, and Bucky was quickly drawn into the show. The sounds of Steve working in the kitchen behind him soothing.
"What about the ..." Bucky caught himself, unsure of how Steve's designation would be viewed in the new time they suddenly found themselves in.
Tony peered off into the corner of his lab for a long moment as he considered his answer. "Truthfully, no. If Rogers wants to share, he should be allowed to do so in his own time and with whomever he trusts. I can't assume he would want me to know, especially with me being related to one of his tormentors."
Steve opened his eyes and peered up at Bucky, trusting him to know what he was thinking while he continued to follow the order for silence.
"Good, I want you to take the dishes to the kitchen and wash them. You can have Jarvis walk you through using the dishwasher, or you may wash them by hand. You choose. Once you're done cleaning up, go shower, decide if you want to shave. I've been told everything you need will be in there. Once you're done in the bathroom, come find me."
Once clean, Steve shut off the water and toweled dry before slipping into the extremely soft black pants which waited for him. Although the shirt was a bit snug, Steve found it to be most comfortable. Once dressed, and mostly clear-headed now, Steve peered at himself in the mirror before heading out in search of Bucky who still sat in the living room.
"Yes." Bruce pulled back the curtain between the beds. "His vitals all look good, no lasting injuries. Any he
Steve grasped Tony's hips and thrust his tongue into him, ensuring he hit the bundle of nerves that would soon have Tony coming undone.
"Nope." Tony declared but wasn't able to keep the smug expression from his face. As he settled into his seat at the head of the conference table, he began designing his next project. He hoped he would have enough time to complete it before Steve returned from his mission.
"I've got drag marks." Clint pointed to the ground, then down the tunnel. "They must've taken him this way."
Shifting in his seat, Tony's smile grew. He had spent the entire day thinking of Steve. The pressure in his ass from the plug every time he moved was a reminder of their morning together before Steve left, and something to look forward to when Steve arrived home. With a looming deadline, Tony shifted his attention back to his current project. One he hoped Steve would be excited about once he shared it.
"We received a distress call from Brazil. The local authorities have reason to suspect there is human experimentation or trafficking going on at this compound." Natasha brought up a map using the holo table.
"Jarvis, ask Bruce to come see me when he's done with Rogers." Tony drained his coffee and growled in frustration when he discovered his coffee machine was empty.
Without a word the elevator moved, only stopping once it reached the previously empty floor between Tony's penthouse and the communal floor where he would often gather with Bruce, Natasha, and Clint. Striding through the foyer, Tony pressed his hand to the security pad on the wall beside the door, and they silently opened.
"I am the Master and protector of the New York Sanctum," the man said repressively. "There is no 'boss' here."
And when Pepper, in a stunning backless evening dress made of some midnight blue material that glittered with reflected light, swept out of the elevator on her father's arm, he had found himself trying to fade into the background. He'd also helped himself to a Martini which he had poured into a tumbler, discarding the olive and other decoration in the nearest wastebasket.
Steve pushed the thought aside. Unless he had suddenly developed new super-powers, he ought to be within a few strokes of safety. The question remained: which way did that safety lie?
"You don't know if I can drive," Steve pointed out. "In fact, I don't know if I can drive. Why are you so antsy, Tony?"
And Clea was chanting as rings of red light flew from her hands to encircle the Doombot, imprisoning its arms, cutting through the armour.
To Steve's surprise he left the car again, signalling to Steve to follow him. They lifted the two bridge plates one by one and slotted them into grease-slick concrete holders set into the ground.
The seemed to be confirmed when Hunter suddenly appeared, the mercenary leader at his back. He said something to T'Challa in Wakandan, and T'Challa roused himself to reply angrily.
"Because you aren't flushed with enthusiasm, are you? If you'd had your memory restored you'd delighted."
Steve was getting the impression that, in Jan's opinion, no one was quite as much of a genius as Hank. He himself reserved judgement; he had had Tony's brilliance demonstrated to him much more convincingly, and Tony himself had the highest regard for Bruce's work.
There were a lot of silences, those first few days, until Tony realised that Steve wasn't going to override him or interrupt him. He began to talk the way he had once talked with his Dad, before he had learned to keep his own counsel, and before Pepper had arrived to make it much easier for him to do just that. Once she was there, no one noticed if he had suddenly become taciturn – except, of course, when he was in the Iron Man suit where he was free to babble as much as he liked.
"I'm sorry, sir. Mr Stark has given me strict instructions to see you don't overreach yourself. Once he is out of conference—"
"It's a wild chance, but – put your hand here." Tony snagged Steve's right wrist and guided his hand to the hollows in the concrete.
The soldiers and Tony were clustered together in a bare concrete room, with no apparent way in or out, no elevator controls visible. Tony had meant to be in the elevator, but had not counted on it. It just made the odds on his own survival a little longer, and they were inching into unacceptable territory as it was.
"Steve! Let up. I'm fine," Tony snarled right back through clenched teeth. "Talk about over-reaction!"
Jarvis had tracked the paths of three different Air Force transports across the Atlantic (which was always assuming that Shuri had not been put in a car and driven to one of a dozen UK airports or an obscure creek leading to the North Sea, in either case being shipped to God alone knew where) the most likely of which had landed at McConnell Air Force Base and was still there, though it was doubtful Shuri was.
He sighed. "I said that the chief of the Panther tribe becomes king of Wakanda, but that is not strictly true. He – or she – is open to challenge from within the Panther tribe or from among the chiefs of all the tribes of Wakanda. However, the Panther God is the strongest of all the local gods, and all members of the ruling family are endowed with enhanced speed and strength. They also possess a genetic quirk that allows them to consume a herb that grows on this mountain. It lets them communicate with the Panther God, who responds by further enhancing their senses."
"I'm picking something up now," Hank intoned, from the rear seat. "Think it must be communications traffic from their ship."
Tony came near to licking his lips at that memory, even as he idly wondered whether he dare ask Steve if he had never been cut or if the serum had efficiently restored his foreskin.
"Actually, no, he isn't. You're the only one who's alone. Thor's with his family and I presume Natasha and Clint are still together. I have Pep and sometimes Rhodey, but—"
And suddenly so much more made sense. Astonishingly, one of the confirmed lone wolves of the Avengers, Tony Stark, liked being part of a team. So did Steve. Neither of them had family, either.
"I presume that by 'everybody' you mean Captain Rogers and Ms Potts, who, by the way, has been trying to contact you for the past three hours. Apparently you are due to accompany her to a Charity Gala at the Met, sir."
Tony plunged on into the living area, to find Jean, in navy and yellow spandex, smiling at Steve. Behind her stood a much younger girl, in jeans and tee, with a mass of blonde hair and a fierce expression.
He was cold, which might explain the shivering if not the terror that accompanied it. There was a sharp pain in his arm, then another in his chest. Human hands lifted him, moved him onto something flat, secured some kind of binding across his chest and legs, and clamped a mask to his face...
Before Steve had time to work out the implications of that surprising statement, the elevator doors opened into an extraordinary room, huge and filled with a cacophony reminiscent of that that had greeted Iron Man's appearance in Stuttgart and which surely could not be called music, bouncing and echoing off  grey concrete. It was also filled with equipment; giant freestanding screens that were probably for computers rather than television, a forge currently cold, machine tools, and the line of Iron Man armour against the far wall that looked more like sculpture than machinery. The Iron Man might be gaudy, but it was also beautiful, with the elegance of form correctly following function.
Only the tiny green figure leaped into the air at a speed impossible to follow. There was a sharp cracking noise, followed almost immediately by the appearance of a small hole in the wall – not Hulk shaped, Steve was relieved to note.
Steve shook his head. "Tony, we can't keep this a secret from them: they already know where we are. Hank can talk to all ants, apparently, not just those in his lab, and understand them. That's how we found you. The ants told Hank about this place, and Bruce is standing by ready to call out the Hulk to smash his way in if you and I don't contact them in—" he looked down at his watch; "— thirteen minutes."
It was ironic, Tony thought, that he had promised to fuck Steve until he couldn't think straight, because he was the one who had somehow allowed Steve to root him out of bed in the pre-dawn dark, feed him coffee and pancakes, and chivvy him down onto the beach. Still, he was all too aware he had to cut Steve some slack after last night's misunderstandings.
Howard was right: Steve wasn't asleep, though the darkened room nearly fooled Tony into thinking he was. Instead he was sitting by the window, peering out into the night, his eyes hooded. Somehow, Tony knew at once that he was deeply unhappy. He wanted to reach out and comfort him the way he had no doubt his father had, but he didn't trust his control. He sought frantically for something to say, but what came out was, "Uh, Steve..."
"Is that why you wanted me to put on the suit?" Tony asked. "To get that metal between you and my – body?" The last sentence was interrupted by a huge yawn.
"Look it up. Evil Overlord List. It's very educational. If Loki or your old foe the Red Skull had read it we might not be here now. Meanwhile, go take that shower and I'll make you breakfast."
Every single flying blade bounced upwards, cutting into the roof, sending steel and concrete crashing down. By that time, Tony had grabbed Cap round the waist with one arm and rocketed roofwards, leaving it to Jarvis to find a weak point, if not a gap. Cap held on tightly to Tony's shoulders with one arm while raising the shield protect them with the other as Tony's free hand blasted any remaining roof away.
Not as bad as Steve had feared, but not good either. "Damn it, the face fungus fooled me. Not to mention you don't act like a teenager."
With an annoyed mutter he took the eraser to each one, with the profound wish that he could erase his growing fascination with the other man as easily.
Steve had been trying to place her accent, which seemed to have elements of French, Spanish and the English West Country, with a touch of Deep South. He said, "Thank you, ma'am. The way Tony's been talking, this is going to be a real treat."
Bruce cleared his throat nervously. "They're timed about an hour apart. I think she was expecting you to reply at some point. I'll start with the oldest." There was a pause far longer than it should have taken for him to read the text. "Oh," he said at last. "Are... are you really sure about this, Tony?"
"Okay." Reluctantly, Tony reached out with Extremis and called the Iron Man suit. "I take it you know where El Furioso is?"
"I'll drive from here," Tony said decisively. "And, in future, if you want to drive Ms Potts rather than me, that's fine. I'll have your contract transferred from me to Stark Industries. No loss of salary. You just keep Pepper safe."
"A design a friend asked me to look over," he said lightly. "I owe him a few favours and he's a biochemist, not an engineer."
"You can always stay here with us when Tony goes back to New York, Steve," Bruce suggested, one hand on Tony's shoulder as he steered him out of the room.
Tony tensed, and T'Challa squeezed his arm in what might have been reassurance or warning, as he strode forward in total assurance that the guards would stand aside.
"That" was the clatter of hail against the windows, in a blast of wind so hard that Tony felt the building shiver.
"Here." Iron Man unshipped the canvas roll that was slung over his back and dropped it at Steve's feet. "SHIELD left one of your suits at Stark Tower reception when they came to pick up the remains of Hennis's team. I would have told you then but the armouring was totally inadequate and I needed to fix that. I was going to ask you to test it tonight..."
Their banter, insults disguising affection, twisted Steve's gut. He hadn't thought, from their attitude during the Battle of New York, that they had reached this level of understanding and trust. Natasha hadn't mentioned Tony during their partnership in Washington, hadn't even reacted to learning he was on the Insight kill list...
"Yeah. Then second left. We'll just go on to my apartment. I'll have to let you into the parking lot. Tony can bail out there and, if the cab's still with us, take the driver into custody."
"It can't have been worse than the 1939 serial. I'm sure Bucky would have loved it," Steve said. He took a deep breath, plainly bracing himself for an attempt to pretend it didn't matter. "Ironic that I was the one frozen and who woke up in the future. But you're still evading. What happened that you aren't telling me?"
Hearing footsteps, Tony lifted his head from where he was entangled in computer innards. Bruce was standing in the doorway, hands on the frame, as if he wasn't sure he ought to step inside. "Nearly finished," Tony told him. "We should be back in touch with the outside world real soon now."
"You're certainly his." There was an odd note in Howard's voice, and Steve did not dare comment. After a while, though, Howard said, "If you need a safe place to think things through I can provide one, though since yesterday Tony owns the one I'd prefer. He'll insist on going with you— no, Steve." He held up a hand. "Believe me, if I try to stop him he won't rest until he finds you. And I want him to rest too. I think you both need to get out of New York. Right now. Vanish. Let Roberta and myself handle Fury. So go pack. You'll find you have rather more possessions now than you did yesterday, so you may have to unwrap them first."
"Your guess is as good as mine, Stark, and I don't have one. Keep me updated. And say 'Hello' to Steve for me. How's that partnership working out for you both, by the way?"
"He'll be fine, though it's taking a little time for him to get back in action. I've got a new suit waiting for him when he's ready."
"Jarvis," Tony began, before he remembered. "Lost Jarvis." He thought it through very carefully. "Mechanical. Emergency release. Steve knows..."
"I doubt it," Steve said. "Seems to me that the boy you describe would be more at home with adults – and highly intelligent adults at that – than with your average kid in high school."
"Steve! Steve, can you hear me?" Tony's voice was urgent, shaking in fear. "Please wake up. What the hell is wrong with you?"
Jarvis had analysed the gas, but it was not on any database he could access, and he was not programmed for biological speculation – not Tony's speciality either.
"Maybe I should let you try to persuade Hank to help," Howard said reflectively. "That encounter might knock some of that over-confidence out of you."
It had all gone wrong since he had wandered into the kitchen this morning and found no trace of either Steve or Bruce. Unexpectedly lonely, he had sauntered down to Bruce's lab, only to be barred entry.
There was no sign of a single whirring flying monofilament blade and the Iron Man HUD showed nothing.
Honing in on Steve's signal brought him under the edges of the supercell – if that was what it was – and he gasped in shock. Below him, buildings had been reduced to rubble, while ahead, dark funnels of wind danced through the suburbs, sweeping up everything in their path.
For Tony didn't need to look to know the buckle was glowing, first red, then white, then so bright that it would blind before you could identify the colour as it expanded outwards melting everything around it, eating away the metal walls. He could feel the heat surge then fade against his back.
She covered her dismay quickly, but Tony knew her too well to miss it, or that she hesitated just an instant too long before trying for puzzlement. "What? What's SHIELD got to do with—?"
"Good enough." The Iron Man surged forward, shrugging off the effects of the gusting winds – Force 10, as Jarvis cheerfully informed him – and the battering hail.
A push of Yogthulu's articulated leg had sent the mutilated man staggering towards the artefact, which promptly twitched, then rolled casually under the nearest chair.
They changed planes and identities three times at three different airports (one tiny and possibly illegal) but never leaving airside or being separated from the crates for more than ten minutes, though apparently said crates had also changed identities.
