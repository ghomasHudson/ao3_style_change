“No, Sam. You
“Okay.” Dean rises.
“Nothing, yes, I’m totally fine with you helping raise Jack.” Dean looks at him, as if he just accused him of something, but he can’t quite figure out what.
“I’m still getting sleep. I’m going to outlast you. You’re suffering far more than me. Soon enough, you’ll become annoyed with my presence, or the nightmares, and cave.” Dean has almost forgotten what led to this nightly ritual.
“It doesn’t matter.” Dean says, unpausing the video so Cas can finish it. “People like that… they just have a stick up their ass. Ignore it.” Cas takes Dean’s advice, looking back at the phone. Dean releases the death grip he has on Miracle’s leash, and the dog lays down at his feet, yawning. He looks up to see the woman still hasn’t stopped her staring contest. Dean returns her gaze, but only for a moment. Soon, the woman calls her kid back from the slide, who has started up some exaggerated conversation with Jack. The kid reluctantly returns to his mother, who whispers something in his ear. The two rise from the bench. Dean feels his jaw clenching. People are such assholes. The woman and her son take to the sidewalk, which passes Dean and Cas’s bench on the way to another park. As they approach the two, she stands a moment, staring them down.
“He’s not my kid, he’s Cas’s.”
Really?
“Well, I’m not…
Dean finishes the song, and is surprised to look up and see a broad grin on Cas’s face. It’s not the normal shit-eating grin Cas gives Dean when he wins an argument. Instead, it’s genuine, pleased.
He watches as Cas’s brows knit in concern.
“Like… I don’t know. Things.” He pauses. “Sometimes things happen, small things, that I didn’t really notice before, but when it all adds up, it seems… I don't know. Like I'm helping Cas raise Jack, right, that’s normal.” She nods, encouraging him to continue. “But like, that’s also a thing people who aren’t just friends… that couples do. But, that doesn’t make it weird that Cas and I are doing it, right? But then there were the nightmares, and I would sometimes go out, alone at night. Ya know, taking walks, getting my mind off things. But then Cas started coming along, he couldn’t sleep either, so we started driving around, and playing games. And having his company was… nice, but I dunno. It feels different. Or maybe it doesn’t, and I’m just making it up. Does that sound insane?” He continues before she can really answer. “It's insane, right? Like if you didn’t know Cas and I, you would look at that and say there’s something I dunno… romantic about it. Or something.” She nods.
“So… is it okay if I ask a kind of personal question? You don’t have to answer it.” Dean wants to say no, but he nods anyway. “Do you think… I dunno, maybe you like Cas?”
Dean is the first to finish. Then Cas. And of course, Jack is last, after half of his cone has dripped onto the ground. They pile back into the impala. That’s one thing Dean was glad for. Since he emptied the Arsenal in the trunk, Cas’s car became the designated hunting vehicle. Now they get to ride Baby around the suburbs, running errands, or just going out to get ice cream. Dean turns on the radio.
“Dean? What’s-” he follows Dean’s gaze to the woman. “Is she a shapeshifter?” Cas asks.
“Cas! CAS! No, please! Don’t- CASTIEL!” Cas’s panic subsides, but not completely. He hates seeing Dean in pain, even if it’s unconscious pain. He could wake him, but doing so would run the risk of getting punched or cut by the blade Dean keeps under his pillow at night. Pure silver, just in case, as he always told Cas. Of course, Cas wouldn’t mind it. He could use his grace to heal. But waking Dean also risks the chance of him losing even more sleep than usual. Much like the other night, when he went for a drive just after midnight, and returned at 2:30 am. Cas has seen Dean vulnerable before, but that was different. He worries about Dean sometimes. Like now. He’s still talking out his nightmare, and praying for Cas. Cas decides to try bringing Dean relief via his grace, preferably without waking him. He holds his hand over Dean’s forehead, trying to bring him peace. It seems to work, Dean stops squirming, and loosens his death grip on his blanket. The silent prayers stop, and his face settles into a sort of calm. As Dean’s breathing slows back to a normal pace, Cas takes his hand back away from him, and exits Dean’s room, shutting the door quietly behind him. This solves the problem of Dean’s nightmares temporarily, as no more than an hour and a half later, Cas hears Dean’s door open and click shut, as Dean makes his way down the hall and into the kitchen. Cas decides it’s best for Dean to deal with this alone- at least for now. Cas, much like Dean, struggles to sleep as well. But for Cas, the struggle stems from lack of practice. He’s still getting used to trying to sleep through the night. Even when he was human, he struggled with this. But then it was a biological need. Now, it’s just an option that angels can indulge in. Cas has no clue as to why Billie and Amara chose to make that a possibility for the angels. Cas enjoys sleeping, or rather, he enjoys dreaming. It allows him to rest, to find a moment of peace throughout his days. A way to enjoy life, while unconscious, rather than perceiving every bit of reality at all times. Even if he can only manage to stay asleep for a few hours at a time.
“Can I color?” He asks.
“Right… here.” He leans forward, tapping on Cas’s chest.
He scrambles to find a way to break the silence and take back what he's said, but it’s too late for that now. He hopes he didn’t hurt Dean too deeply. Cas searches for what he’s trying to say, what does he want Dean to know from this? The words fall out of Cas’s mouth faster than he has time to process what they are or what he’s saying. “What I mean is, I could use some help, with Jack, at least until I understand what I’m doing.”
“Mama Mia, Mama Mia! Mama Mia let me go!” Cas laughs as Dean whips out a fake microphone. Dean tilts his arm back, signaling Jack to solo. Jack takes it, saying random gibberish along to the tune.
right? Dean wishes he could say no with full confidence… but he can’t. Holy crap. John
don’t have to!”
“Okay. Now close your eyes.” He raises his hand over Dean’s forehead, which Dean looks at, questionably, before following Cas’s directions. “Now, I guess just try and feel that emotion more deeply.”
He thinks.
“I know.” He offers her a grateful smile. “Thanks, Charlie.”
“That’s what I thought.” Cas murmurs. He turns away from Dean, disappearing down the hall. Dean hears a door shut. Dean takes a moment, his mind reeling from the conversation has just taken place. He feels like a zombie, as he waltzes back to his own room, shutting the door behind him. He crawls into his empty bed, turning off the lamp. He shrugs under his covers, waiting for sleep to wash away everything that just happened.
“Nonetheless, I don’t want to do that anymore.” Dean rises, pacing. “I don’t want to drag you through my problems anymore. It’s not right. It’s… it’s toxic. Narcissistic. And-”
“Ah, I’m sure you did fine. Don’t pick yourself apart! You’re the smartest IT person I know.” She shrugs.
“Drained how?” Dean asked.
If Dean is truly honest with himself, he felt… elated but also calm, and… normal. Not normal in a sense of life-outside-of-hunting normal, but more… natural. Like he was
powers, even after giving Amara Chuck’s. And, when the time comes that Jack is ready, he will take his place as God.” This was a lot to digest, but Dean still managed to form a question.
“Goodnight, Cas.” Dean repeats. At first, Cas doesn’t move. He stays, with his hand still firmly gripping Dean’s shoulder a few seconds longer. Then, he swiftly passes Dean, turning the corner of the hall to his own bedroom. Dean doesn’t meet his eyes as he leaves. Dean returns to the table, grabbing a deck of cards from the island counter that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He shuffles the cards, removing the jokers, and starts setting up solitaire. He’s about ten minutes into his first game when Sam walks in. His hair is a mess, and he almost trips on his oversized penguin-patterned pajama pants. This gets a small chuckle from Dean, who knows the only reason Sam even wears those pants is because Eileen got them for him. Who would have thought there was any article of clothing in this world that was too
His nightmare doesn't return. It’s still dark in his room when Dean wakes, but his watch reads 9:17 AM. He turns, expecting to see the spot near his feet empty, but is surprised to see Cas is still there, completely out. Dean rises, and opens the door slowly. He turns toward the handle, trying not to make any noise closing it behind him. He jumps, when a voice starts behind him.
- homophobia
“I want to be a kid, with you guys. I want to grow up and have a normal life.” Jack chimed in.
“So you don’t want to hunt?” Cas asks, genuinely.
- Dean and Cas get in a big fight
“Shh!” Sam waves his hand out to shush Dean before continuing. “Four mississippi, five mississippi, six mississippi, ” Dean reluctantly joins in.
“Yeah.”
. Eleven years. Eleven years they’ve known each other, you’d think if they even wanted each other, Dean would have felt something even then- something would have happened- right? Well this is the first time something’s ever happened on Dean’s end… aside from the occasional glance down at Cas’s lips during conversation, of course. But that’s not really anything. But coupled with a few moments of accidental touch, where Dean feels his nerves skyrocket, and wandering thoughts after seeing the profile of Cas’s face in a certain light…
“Yes. It matters.” Dean drops his hand, too exhausted to care anymore.
He shovels another small mound of dirt over the pipes.
“Actually it’s ready now!”
“Yeah, I guess you can.” Jack smiles. Then his face settles in more curiosity. “What plant is sun tea from?” He asks. Dean opens his mouth to answer, but finds he doesn’t have an answer.
Jack snapped his fingers. The ambient noise of people populating the planet once more brought a wave of relief to Sam and Dean. Jack brought everyone back! He then transported them into an unpopulated area… some woods in Kansas.
. Maybe it really truly did mean nothing. Maybe Dean is just so touch starved that he’s willing to take it out on Cas, his
“I know several other angels  who have compassion.” Cas states.
“Yay! Park! Park!”
“Let go of what?” Dean asks.
“I already told you, man, it’s not worth it. It’s not. I’m fine. Just go back to sleep.” Cas thinks for a moment before responding.
“Thanks, Charlie.” Dean says with a grateful smile. She turns to him, offering a slight nod, before holding out her hand for Jack. Jack runs up, taking it, and following her down the stairs. That nod seemed to convey that Charlie understood Dean was avoiding Cas. Was it that obvious? Did she hear the fight? Charlie’s room was way down in the other hall, but maybe she did. Dean wishes she didn’t. Maybe she didn’t, and she just read between the lines. That sounds about right. Whatever the case, Dean makes himself a sandwich, retreating back into his room.
“I’ve been thinking a lot, you know, about all of this ‘true happiness’ crap.” Charlie nods, following along. In the last few weeks she’s been here, she’s pretty much figured out the dynamic of the bunker. “And so I’ve had to do more, you know, reflecting about myself… and my place in it all, you know? The people around me, people I care about being affected. And now I have questions that I just can’t seem to find the answers for.” Charlie looks at him thoughtfully. He’s being very vague, which seems to confuse her. He sighs. This is so difficult.
“What? I’m helping!” He tells Jack, cleaning up the sticky pink lines on Jack’s arm with a wipe
. He tells himself.
“Probably sometime this fall.” Cas answers. “And with any luck, they’ll come back in the spring.” Jack nods, satisfied with the answer. Dean notices the trails of pink running down Jack’s arm.
“Hi Dean.”
“I read that trick in a book.” He says. Dean shoves him.
Dean asks. The green box next to it reads “
“No, this isn’t about Dad.”
Dean falls back onto his bed, reading the paper in his hands. They’re coordinates.
“Dean,” Sam says, annoyed.
Dean clicks A, moving onto the next question. He should have prepared for it, but he honestly hadn’t thought ahead, and now Dean stares blankly at his phone, almost shocked by the next question.
“Like a surprise?” He asks. Dean nods.
“Um… I dunno- weird?” Charlie nods.
“What? Oh, yes, Dean, I’m fine.” He returns his gaze outward. There’s a short-lived pause.
This time, it didn’t take more than one blackbird to sing Jack to sleep. He really wore himself out at the park. Cas sits on the couch, pulling up another Star Wars movie.
Dean thought to himself.
“That is the best tea I’ve ever had!” He tells Jack, who beams with pride. Dean would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little proud that Cas liked it, as well. He tries a sip. It doesn’t taste exactly like how when he was a kid, but it’s enough to bring a warm smile to his face. He checks his watch. 6:30 pm.
“Yay!”
“Yes.” Jack said, walking back over to Cas.
“Things are kind of weird right now, between Cas and me.” He finally admits. She cocks her head to the side.
“Aw, dang! I would, but I should really finish up with the sprinkler today so Miracle has a yard to run in again.” He says.
” to ring throughout the hall.
“What else am I supposed to do?” Cas asks.
“I’m fine, Cas.” He says it harsh enough that Cas doesn’t follow him, and Dean feels a little guilty. It wasn’t Cas’s fault that Dean is having a damn midlife crisis. Still, he’d rather deal with more awkward confrontations in the future than Cas poking at this right now. Dean grabs his tools from under the stairs near the yard. He slides open the door and starts working. The trenches are all dug, and the flowers are all planted. Now Dean just needs to measure the water pressure, attach the spicket to a hose, attach the hose to the pvc, add the sprinklers, and then set them to a timer. He got a solar powered one for efficiency, knowing that having to change the batteries out would be a pain in the ass. He grabs the weird tool he got with the sprinklers that measures the water pressure and attaches it to the spicket. He turns it on, and water sprays all over the place.
“Okay, so Dad wasn’t the best. But what do you expect me to do about it now?” Dean asks, calming down.
. As he scans the rest of the fine print, he does find one label that he got zero on.
something bothering you, okay? I can tell. So just…” He takes in a breath. “Tell me what it is.” Dean stares hard at Sam for a few seconds. Finally, he gives in.
“Did you just bite into it?” Cas asks. Dean nods. “I believe that is something akin to psychopathic behavior.” He says. “Doesn’t it hurt your teeth? Do you have a brain freeze?” Cas asks. Dean waves him off.
“It’s not just any compassion. It’s ‘Castiel CompassionTM.” Cas furrows his brow, signaling that Dean has lost him yet again. “Think of it like this, what you have isn’t just regular old compassion, or empathy. It’s like it’s your own special compassion and empathy. It’s like… it’s like god had a bowl, and in it he put in kindness, compassion, loyalty, all of those good things, but then he added ‘extract of Cas’ to make it extra special. Like it’s its own thing. It’s different. It’s different because it’s specific to
“What the hell does that mean? Jack, what is she talking about?” Sam asked.
“Uh… um. Uh- I- uh, I don’t know… confused?” Dean says. She nods.
“But I don’t… I don’t know what I want.” He admits. Sam raises his brow at Dean.
“Yeah, I’m sure your response definitely helped to de-escalate the situation.” Cas says, sarcastically.
“Oh right. I said that uh… that one thing I read at school. That uh if you start counting from the time that you see the lightning until you hear the thunder, however many seconds you counted was how many miles away the storm was from you.” Dean says.
Dean thinks to himself,
“What flavor is yours?” He asks.
The first question is pretty much useless.
“You don’t think you deserve to be happy.” Sam states. “Why?”
“No, you’re not,” Dean says, nudging his shoulder, “seriously, what’s bothering you?” He asks, genuinely concerned for Cas. Cas lets out a big sigh, not looking away from the distance.
A few weeks have passed since the incident on the forest bench. Dean won’t talk about it, and Cas won’t pressure him either. It’s been hell for Dean. Now he sits on his bed, tossing one of Jack’s toy rubber balls at the wall and catching it, like you see prisoners do locked in their cells in the movies. Dean isn’t a prisoner, he’s isolated himself in here by choice. He spends a lot of his time around the bunker avoiding Cas when he can, which is hard to do when he’s promised to help him look after Jack. Luckily, no one’s bothering to ask why Dean spends so much of his time in his room now, probably chalking it up to him “thinking about what he wants for the future.” But frankly, Dean can’t stop thinking about the past. He wouldn’t be so… thrown by it if… Dean isn’t sure what he expected, but nonetheless he’s freaked. He’s freaked because he kissed Cas, and not just a peck on the cheek that anyone can pass off as a joke or something, but a
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Dean finally says, setting down his bottle with a light
“Have you ever tried zucchini?” Cas asks, patiently. Jack nods his head no. “Then how do you know it doesn’t taste good?” Eileen and Sam, who have finished their pizzas, get up and leave, sensing an oncoming tantrum.
Dean gets an uneasy feeling in his gut. He would prefer it if the amount was
“Ow.” He sounds more annoyed than actually hurt. Dean has to suppress a snicker.
Dean sighs. This is going to take a while.
“So you have guilt.” Sam suggests. There’s a pause, as Dean shrugs, confirming Sam’s suspicion. “But why?” Dean knows he means it more as a statement than a genuine question. Like he’s trying to lead Dean down some bunny trail that will miraculously erase the weight of that day. When Dean doesn’t answer, Sam continues, “Look, Dean, I don’t know everything that went down with Billie, and maybe I never will, but Billie was hunting you down. You didn’t have time to process it, Dean. You were in shock.” Sam explains. “You can’t blame yourself for that. Like you said, there wasn’t anything you
“I’m good. A little nervous, I have an interview at three.” Dean cocks his head in something akin to pride.
“Well, you also might’ve said they were ‘pretty’.” Charlie admits.
“No wait! I come! I come get ice cream!” He insists. He runs up, grabbing Cas’s hand. Cas turns to Dean, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Stop it, Dean,” Sam cuts him off, “I get it, okay? I do. You-”
“We love you too, Jack.” Sam said, as hugged Jack.
“Well, you said that you weren’t listening to him before. Maybe try listening to him, now.” This makes Dean chuckle.
“Dee, why… why are you… you crying?” Jack asks, poking the tears on Dean’s face.
“Dean-”
“Hey guys!” She says. “Dinner’s almost ready. Just a few more minutes.”
“Right.” He turns to Jack. “What about you, Kiddo? Do you like strawberry?” Jack nods.
“Crap. I should probably start working on that sprinkler again before it gets too hot outside.”
“Because-” Dean stops himself, tears threatening to trickle down his face. When did the tears start? He composes himself. “Because.” Sam, feeling horrible, traps Dean in a hug.
get it! You’ll never get it. You aren’t me.” Dean shoots.
“Uh huh! Exactly.”
“What? I don’t want- what do you mean!?” Embarrassment is crawling up from Dean’s stomach, settling into his chest.
“Well it’s like that.” Dean says. “You have a heart of gold, Cas. but, like, a special one. It’s different.”
“So… I’m human because I have compassion?” Cas asks.
“Mmhmm. His name is Noah. No-uh.” Jack enunciates. “He said it’s from the Bible. What’s a bible?” Jack asks. Dean nods understanding.
“Deal with what, exactly, Sam?” Dean asks.
“Good.” Sam sits. “You know, in some messed up way, this is kind of like retirement.” This makes Dean chuckle. “Maybe, now you can paint yourself a picture.”
“So you think you can love me and leave me to die?” Dean takes its back.
He forgot about not using the door, which has just bumped into the wall from swinging open. Dean startles, leaping out of his bed, and throwing out his arm, which is gripping a switchblade. He shouts as Cas grabs his arm, stopping the blade from cutting him. Dean quickly grabs Cas’s arm, running him into the wall, bringing the blade up, threateningly, before his face settles in recognition.
“Yeah.” He sucks in a breath. “And… someone did mistake us- Cas and I, for a couple... a while ago” Dean admits.
“That’s okay, it won’t do anything to the tea.” Dean explains. They take turns dropping in about six tea bags. “Okay, now, we set it outside in the sun.” Dean says, setting Jack back down on the floor. Jack follows him as he carries the tea down to the yard, setting it on the patio table. He drags the table out from under the patio so the sun can hit it.
“Maybe?” What was sorrow is now replaced with something else… not exactly anger… frustration. “So you
“Are we not gonna watch the next one?” Cas asks.
“Well. I still feel bad.” He replies.
“Not today.” Is all Dean can manage. “Not yet.” And the silence that spills over the room lasts the whole night.
“No, this is different, Dean. There
“But you want something..?” Cas half asks, half states, as if he’s getting a read on Dean. As if he’s Dean’s shrink.
“Oh.” Dean says. How the hell does that work?
“Coding a new game. Think World of Warcraft meets Lord of the Rings. Though, I made sure the shadow orcs-” she stops herself, reading Dean’s face.
“I’m not sure yet.” Dean admits. Cas nods. What an interesting way of thinking. Dean continues, “one thing I know for sure? It’s gonna be hell.” This makes Cas laugh, loud.
Another easy question. Dean clicks A, only half ready when the next similar question loads.
“Dude, what do you take me for?” He sighs.
“That’s called guilt-tripping, Cas. Not cool.” Dean hears a page turn. “Well if you’re not gonna sleep, then give me back my pillow.” There’s a beat before Cas responds.
“Yeah? Is it sweet enough?” Dean asks. Jack nods.
“What happened?” Cas asked. “While I was gone?” Before Dean could answer, Cas asked another question. “Where’s Jack?” Dean stepped aside so Cas could peer over the railing, to see Sam holding Jack.
“You’re sleeping?” Cas asks, a small laugh escaping him as he asks.
“No.” Dean says.
... But what really throws Dean off the most about the whole situation is how it made him feel.
“Hmm. I like raspberry.”
“There he is!” It's Dean. He takes a seat next to Cas, beer in hand. “Just put Jack back to bed. It’s a good thing we went out and got diapers when we did. That’s all I can say.” Dean chuckles. He twists the cap off his beer and takes a swig, before leaning over and scratching Miracle’s belly. “I thought kids stopped that whole waking up at 2:30 in the morning crap at, like. one year old.”
“Probably not.” Dean admits, drawing yet another card.
“Cool.” Sam offers one last curious look at the door, before moving down the hall. Dean lets out a sigh. He doesn’t dare peek into the room to see if Cas is awake. Instead, he beelines it to the coffee machine.
” Dean exclaims, just quiet enough not to wake Cas or Jack. “I hate this game.”
“Weird like… I haven’t stopped thinking about it since, and it gets worse, she wasn’t the only one. It happened three times. Three. In the same month.”
“Cute kid.”
“Really?” Jack asks.
all Jack brought back.” He said. Sam nodded, taking Jack to the Impala.
He offers a nod, heading down the stairs and to the kitchen to throw away his fast food bag.
“Yes I am familiar with that term.”
“So… what happened?” Cas asked. Dean stood, taking in a deep breath.
“Uhh… I don’t know… um… I guess confusion, maybe.” Cas nods.
“Okay, but
But that’s not what throws Cas off the most… it’s what he’s saying- shouting, actually. Mostly, he’s shouting Cas’s name. But there’s something in the way he says it… pain, or desperation, or… or fear. Maybe both. This alarms Cas, who jumps out of his bed, and wanders down the hall to Dean’s room. He stands outside for a moment, debating. Maybe Cas made it up, or dreamt it. But then he hears it again, Dean crying out to him. He opens the door, ready to fight whatever monster or being is attacking him, only to find there is none. Only Dean, writhing around, as if he were a wounded animal, fast asleep. He’s having a nightmare. He cries out, aloud this time, as well as in prayer.
“It’s sun tea!” Jack explains, “Dee showed me how!”
you, Dean. And I understand why it’s so hard for you to let go, but you have to.” Dean lets out an exasperated laugh.
“I bet!” She says, letting out an encouraging chuckle. Dean feels a little better about this. He continues.
“But why? I’m not going anywhere.” Jack asked.
“And it… worked?” He asks. Cas nods.
“BILLIE!” He started after her, “YOU BITCH. YOU DID THIS TO CAS! YOU BRING HIM BACK, YOU HEAR ME?!” With a wave of her staff, Billie sent Dean sprawling on the grass.
“Uh, actually Kiddo, we need to talk about this.” He lifts Jack up onto the couch.
“Nu-Uh. There’s something up.” Dean looks hard at her, before caving. She’s probably the most stubborn of them all.
“Haha, look at you learning to be a responsible parent.” He laughs, ignoring the small feeling inside that screams in protest, reminding Dean that once Cas can parent Jack on his own, that’s exactly what he’ll do.
“Yep. We’ll just come pick you up later for dinner.” He calls behind his shoulder. They hear the pitter patter of Jack’s small velcro shoes against the pavement behind them, catching up.
“Then you still know more about yourself than you did before.” Charlie says, encouraging. He nods. She knocks him on the shoulder, as if she just had a revelation. “Holy crap, it’s June!” She says. “That means it’s pride month!”
Dean feigns his unconsciousness, ignoring how Cas’s exhale tickles the hairs on the back of his neck. Dean shuts his eyes, trying to slow his own breath enough to look like he’s fast asleep, which is difficult, since his heart is beating at a thousand miles an hour. At least he wasn’t the one with Cas wrapped in his arms, though it may have been easier to escape without raising suspicion. He feels Cas’s arms slide off of him, and the bed shifts as he stands. Dean doesn’t dare move. He sees the shadow of Cas pass him through his eyelids, silhouetted against the light in the room, as he opens and shuts the door, leaving Dean alone. Dean waits a few moments before opening his eyes. Sure enough, Cas is gone. He rubs his face.
“I guess, maybe a little bit.” Sam replied. He looked at Dean’s face, ridden with pain. He shut off the tv, and brought all of his focus to his grieving brother. “Dean, you can talk about it, you know.” Sam offered, “you still haven’t told me what happened down there.”
When Dean finally retires the book back to its place, it doesn’t feel like a weight off of him at all. He leaves the library with more questions than he started with. All he has to show for his little trip is just how much more confused and exhausted he feels. That book was overwhelming, even just skimming it had given Dean a headache. Sure he half-understands the meanings of a few more words than he did before, but any question about himself he got the answer to seemed to just split off into another plethora of unanswered questions. He wishes he could be, as Cas once said, “indifferent to sexual orientation”.
“Yeah! It’s a flower. It looks kind of like…” Dean thinks for a moment before pulling out his phone, plugging “chamomile” into the search engine. He hands Jack the phone, which is now littered with images of the flower.
“Dee, look!” Dean takes the paper from him. It’s one big rainbow. And under are a bunch of multi colored scribbles that Dean can’t decipher. “It’s me and you and Cas and miracle!” Jack explains, pointing at the splotches. “And we’re all eating ice cream!” Dean kneels down, pulling Jack into a hug.
“I gotta fix this, man, it's driving me nuts. And I mean tearing it all up, and building a whole new deck, lord knows we have the space for it.” Dean mutters to himself. The yard is huge, and they never would have stumbled upon it if Jack hadn’t found it a few weeks prior. He takes another swig, before realizing Cas is just staring at the horizon, lost somewhere in his own thoughts. He looks upset.
Four and a half hours later, Dean has whipped up a steak and potato dinner. That’s part of the joy of Sam not being around, no more vegan dinners! As Dean sets a steak on his plate, Jack stands on his chair to whisper to Dean.
him… like
“What if… I’m not good at that either?”
“That’s okay, you guys are just gonna have to eat enough ice cream for all of us!” She says. Jack claps his hands.
“Well- because, you can do that now.” Dean chuckles, “You, if anyone, deserve to have rest, and now that you’re actually able to do that, here you are, sitting with me at 1:30 AM, talking about why
Dean waits a solid hour and a half before venturing into the hall. Lucky for him, the only person in the dining room when he gets there is Charlie, on her phone, sipping some orange juice.
“Right. Yeah, yeah I know, Cas, I know.” Dean hugs back, not wanting to move. Wishing they could stay like that for one more moment. And they do. “Thank you.” Dean whispers.
“Cas just… let it go, man. Why the hell are you fighting this so hard, anyway?”
Dean wasn’t expecting anything intriguing to pop up as a result, but then again, he wasn’t expecting a lot of things to happen these past few weeks that have happened. He reads the top link:
“Cas! Stay with me, Cas, please.” Cas rises, once again flying into Dean’s room. This time, Cas was already awake, staring at the meteor shower in the sky outside his window. He had been keeping track of all of the astronomical events that are taking place this year. Especially now that it’s starting to warm back up outside again. Oddly, tonight wasn’t the peak of the April Lyrids, but Cas chanced upon seeing a meteor shoot across the sky during another bout of insomnia around a half an hour ago. Since then, he lay awake, staring outside the window at the night sky in hopes of seeing another one. Cas hopes to be able to show Jack a “shooting star” as many people refer to it as. But right now, his main focus is on bringing Dean peace. Cas wonders if Dean is aware that he prays during his nightmares. Or if he remembers his dreams at all. He hopes against it, ignorance is bliss, afterall. And Cas knows that if Dean knew about it, he would become embarrassed and insist that Cas not waste his power on something so insignificant. But to Cas, this is exactly what his grace is for. If he can’t help those who he loves, what’s the point of having his grace at all? However, he knows this solution to Dean’s nightmares won’t last forever. Eventually, Cas’s grace will diminish, and fade away, with only enough remaining to sustain his wings. The longer he stays out of heaven, the more he finds himself depending on human things to sustain him. Food, water, and sleep. And he knows that staying on earth will age him, unlike his brothers and sisters who remain in heaven. As Dean’s cries turn to silence, Castiel flies back to his room. This time, Cas crawls under the covers on his bed, falling fast asleep.
“Well. I’m gonna go grab a drink.” Dean rises. “You should probably get back to bed. No wonder you’ve been so tired.”
“Great. Yeah, that’s swell. Who all heard that?”
“His memory will be restored with time.” Amara explained, “when he’s old enough to process it.”
“Something’s eating Cas’s at garden. He said it was just a few flowers at first, but now it’s even stealing things from the veggie garden.” Charlie explains. “You can see the tiny claw marks in the squash.”
“Whatcha up to?” Dean asks her before she can beat him to it.
“Yeah, they look kind of like daisies.” Dean says. Jack gives him back the phone.
Dean clicks A. For obvious reasons. The next question makes Dean roll his eyes.
“How? How did you fail him, Dean? He’s here, and he’s safe, and he’s not in the empty. Seems like he’s doing just fine to me. He sacrificed himself, right? That’s not your fault.” Sam says.
“Why not, Dean?”
“The longer an angel remains out of heaven, the more heavily they will experience earthly life.” She explained, “They’ll keep their wings, but after so many years, their grace will diminish until there’s just enough left to sustain their wings.”
“No, not NASA specifically. Just a company that teams up with NASA.” She explains. “But it is possible that some of the projects they give me could be partnered with NASA, if I get the job. Fingers crossed!”
“Well, Cas, why don’t you explain to me why Miracle is sitting at my feet right now?”
“Hey Jack. Did you make a friend?” Cas asks him. Jack nods.
“Ohhhh.” Jack returns with his cup. Dean adds sugar to the pitcher, and then drains the rest of the water in his own mug. Cas does the same. Jack is the first to try the tea.
“Yep! It has monsters in it.”
“We’re not at a bar, we’re at a park.” Dean corrects, taking it.
”, then Dean sees a purple one, which reads “
“Right.” Jack copies his movement, nodding along.
“You know what Cas? I’m actually feeling better now. I don’t even know what I’m talking about, to be honest. I’m just tired.” Dean finishes off his beer, rising from his seat to throw away the bottle.
“What, you don’t? You don’t think that’s a possibility? Ever?”
“Not everyone, just the medic, me and Cas.” Charlie answers.
“Well, I suppose he wants you to pet him.” Cas answers, simply.
“Good.” She stands.
“Cas?” He grabs it, looking into Dean’s eyes. Dean doesn’t move or shrug away. Cas runs his fingers down Dean’s palm, intertwining them into Dean’s own calloused fingers. He leans forward, and Dean’s eyes follow his, as he gets closer and closer, until their noses almost touch. “
“I’m sorry.” Cas apologizes.
“Thank you!” Jack says, taking Dean’s hand. The man grins at Jack, then at Dean.
“Bitch.” Dean grumbles, drawing his cards.
“I not tired.” Jack explains. Dean nods, feigning a serious tone.
“Yeah imagine that. Trying to explain to Jack the Bible when his memories of it haven’t come back yet.” Cas raises his brows.
“No, Dean, he didn’t.” Sam now stands, his own chair scraping against the floor. “You know how I know? Because I see the way you are with Jack. It’s different. Dad was a revenge-obsessed bastard who put his own kids’ lives on the line. He handed you a gun when you were 8 years old.” Dean stands slowly, to add emphasis on his next words.
But what if he was bisexual? What then? Would the world end? Would everyone he loves leave? Would it matter? He shoves more dirt into the hole. The sun is starting to set.
“Crazy 8’s? What are you, a child?” Dean scoffs. Sam raises his eyebrows at Dean, not changing his mind. Dean reluctantly deals each of them a hand of 8 cards, setting the rest in between them.
“Dean, this isn’t just about that time with the empty, is it?” Sam asks. Dean folds his arms, leaning back in his chair. He doesn’t answer. He continues burning a hole with his eyes into that same stupid stain on the table. Sam sighs. “Just-” he pauses, collecting his thoughts, “well, you’re here now, right?” Again, no answer. “However you feel like you’ve failed Cas, you can make up for it now.”
“Yay! I just did like Spiner-man!” Jack says.
. Cas realizes,
“Daisies!” Jack says.
“What do you want to play?” Dean asks. Sam shrugs.
. Cas is done with heaven, so is Jack, and they’re gonna stay that way.”
“NASA? You’ll be working for NASA?” She laughs.
“Yeah, just a routine vamp hunt. When do you expect to be back?” Sam shrugs.
“Exactly.” Dean says. “And other things too.” Dean wants to stop there, but his mouth seems to have different plans. “I… kind of, may or may not have… kissed Cas.” Dean confesses. He shocks himself.
“Because if you get sick-”
“Hey do you remember that one time there was a huge storm by that hotel we stayed at in Greenville, Ohio? And I got so scared, I hid in that rickety old closet?” Sam laughs.
“Why not?”
“Ga-moorneen!” Jack calls from the living room.
“Dean-” Dean shoves a pillow at him.
“Because…” Cas can’t seem to find a good answer. There’s a long pause. “I’m sorry.” Dean turns to face Cas, which is a mistake. His face is illuminated by that damn slit in the window. His icy blue eyes pierce right through Dean, full of sorrow. “It’s my fault, your nightmares. That's why I have to… I need to make it right.” Dean stares at him quizzically.
Warnings for chapter:
“Are you gonna play? Because I’ll just pack this whole thing up if you’re getting bored, and then we can play a real game like Texas hold ‘em.” Dean says.
“Uh… you good?” Sam asks him.
“Hey, a pride flag!” Dean doesn’t catch himself in time.
“Mm. How?” Dean mutters, not entirely sure what Cas is referring to, but far too exhausted to try and figure it out.
“Or s-something.” Dean manages to tack on. He forces himself to gauge her expression. She looks at him with a look of… compassion, and understanding? But not pity, which Dean appreciates.
“No! No nap!” Dean can’t hold back his laugh anymore.
“I heard you cry out in your sleep, I thought maybe a monster or something had attacked you. But when I walked in, I realized it was just a nightmare you were having. I didn’t want to wake you, so I just figured I’d… I’d just try and take the fear away.” Dean stares at Cas with an unreadable expression.
.” Dean says. “So what if you don’t get it right at first? Sure, you’ll feel like a big failure and you’ll think ‘what the hell am I doing? I’m not cut out for this!’ But you gotta believe me, man. I’ve seen how you are with Jack, okay, you care about him a
“Yeah. I’m kinda hoping he forgets about it until he remembers everything. But I suppose he should know where some people get their beliefs.” Cas explains.
“well Jack, what is it about the pizza that you don’t like?”
“I don’t think it’s ridiculous at all,” Cas starts, “you deserve rest, too.”
“Can I use the blanket?” Dean has to fight the urge to scream at him.
“Are you sure that this is good? You’re really fine with this?”
“Dee!” He shouts.
“Oh… gross!” He gets up, running to the kitchen for paper towels. He wipes the sticky mess from his hand, and returns to the couch to clean the mess. He scrubs the spot with soap water so it doesn’t stain, and takes a seat further away from the spot. There’s not too much room on the couch, and Dean’s arm brushes against Cas’s. Dean tries to ignore it, but about ten minutes in, decides it’s better for him to move it so it’s spread out on top of the couch behind Cas. Dean moves his other arm up for extra measure. There. That’s not so suspicious. Dean almost doesn’t even notice when half an hour later, Cas starts nodding off, head slumping into Dean’s shoulder. Lucky for him, Cas turns his head another fifteen minutes later, so he’s no longer resting against Dean. Dean feels the spot on his shoulder grow cold in the absence of Cas, but the relief flooding through him knowing there won’t be an awkward moment later in the film is enough to make him forget about it. Cas managed to wake up just before the final scenes. The next Movie begins automatically. That’s the beauty with streaming services. Dean grabs the remote, ready to switch it off, when Cas stops him.
“That’s right, you’re Jack.” The toddler then grabbed Cas’s finger with his hand, which was so small that he could only wrap it around that one finger.
“Good morning, sport!” He says, holding him with one arm, and lifting the blanket with the other, peeking at Jack’s face.
“Alright,” Billie started, “listen up, boys, because I’m only gonna explain this all once.” Dean scrambled up.
“Dean, stop,” Cas says, “where is this coming from?”
“Hey, check that out!” Dean says.
“So pretend I just got hurt. Pretend I…” he looks around, and sees the table. He pretends to ram his foot into it. “Pretend I hurt my toe on the table.” He falls onto the ground. “Ow!” He feigns his injury, gripping his leg in his hand. Jack runs over from the couch. Dean looks up at Jack, winking. “Don’t worry, Bub. I’m Fine.” He says. “Now what do you do?” He asks, in a hushed voice. Jack runs up and inspects Dean’s foot.
“But your grace,” Dean says, “and you’ll get tired, and hungry, and old.” Cas laughs.
Cas rolls out of bed, more mentally exhausted than physically exhausted. He walks into the kitchen to find that Charlie has already poured Jack a bowl of cereal. She makes a comment, asking if he was okay, that he looked sick. He thanks her for helping Jack, and assures her he’s fine, even though it’s not true. Good thing Cas has such a bright ray of sunshine for a son, or he might have gone his whole day without feeling any joy.
“Woah-ho, slow down, Buddy. We’re not leaving until after lunch.” Dean tells him. “I’ll tell you what, how about you and Cas go let that butterfly go, and get ready to leave, while I make lunch?” Jack nods his head. “Awesome.” Dean picks up the jar, which he notices has holes poked into the lid for the butterfly to breathe, and hands it back to Jack. Jack runs down the stairs, dragging Cas along with him by his coat. After a minute, Charlie clears her throat to get Dean’s attention.
” Pfft. Easy.
“Fine.” Dean collects both of their cards and stacks them neatly in a pile. When he doesn’t elaborate, Sam rolls his eyes. Looks like he’s really going to have to twist Dean’s arm about this. He asks Dean another question.
“I was thinking we should take him to the park tomorrow.” Cas says. Dean nods.
like that. So he forces himself to say the words.
“I don’t need your pity, Cas.”
“Huh? Yeah. Yeah it’s uh… the lgbt pride thing. Ya know, it’s June, so… makes sense.” He takes another bite out of his cone, hoping Cas won’t notice his nerves. Instead, Cas smiles.
He continues reading. “
“Dadda fell asleep. But Charlie showed me her… her… um… her game.” Dean loves the kid, but it’s excruciating trying to listen to him try to get through a sentence sometimes. Jack started calling Cas “Dad.” A few weeks before. It was weird for Dean at first, hearing Jack call Cas “Dadda” is like a reminder that there’s a being depending on the funny guy. But at least Jack hasn’t tried calling Dean that yet. Wouldn’t want to break the kid’s heart when Cas moves out, taking Jack with.
version of all of those things. Like a remix.” Cas nods, half understanding Dean’s analogy.
“My nightmares aren't your problem. It comes with the job. And they certainly aren’t worth keeping you up for. I’m heading to bed. Goodnight, Cas.”
“I’m Jack.” He declared, as he pointed at himself. Cas smiled and nodded, pointing to Jack.
“I will.” Cas sits at the foot of Dean’s bed, staring him down, arms still crossed. Dean let’s put a huff as he rolls over to ignore him. It does little to relieve his senses, as he can feel Cas’s eyes burning into the back of his skull.
“He’s so cute.” She says. Dean chuckles.
“for what?” Cas asks
“Anytime we talk, it just turns into him asking me a dozen questions, and me dumping all of my problems on him. Nothing’s changed. Here I am, still dragging Cas into all of my crap. And he just sits there and takes it. It’s not right.” Dean admits to Sam. Sam chuckles.
Dean shrugs.
“It’s a classic, Sammy. A game of discipline and integrity.”
“No, its-” Dean stops himself. If he had to talk to anyone about this, it would be her. Charlie is a lesbian, so she would know all about this stuff, right? He lets out a breath. “Actually, you’re right. There’s something that’s been bothering me, and I just can’t… I can’t seem to figure it out.” She nods.
“I’m not finished.” Billie said, as she banged her staff. She continued, “you’ll notice Jack resurrected me. That’s for a reason. When Amara takes on Jack’s power, or rather, Chuck’s power, she won’t just be the darkness anymore. She'll be both darkness and light, and none at the same time. Instead, she’ll simply be Life. And I, Death, was brought back to make sure there is still balance.” Billie explained.
No. if he did, it would have ended with the bed turning into a big dark pit that swallows them both, or something. If Dean wasn’t too tired to think, he might admit to himself that he liked Cas’s company. But he is too tired to think. He needs coffee. Dean stumbles out of his room into the kitchen. He fills the coffee pot, letting it heat up. Unfortunately, he ran out of pvc pipe yesterday, so he’ll have to go to home depot for more. He sits at the table to drain his mug of coffee.
“Oh.”
- internalized homophobia
“Is it your new favorite?” Dean teases, trading back the cones.
mean compassion. I… I mean empathy, and I don’t know, Cas it’s hard to explain.” Cas doesn’t seem to understand Dean. A moment passes before Dean has an epiphany. “Wait, wait, wait. I got it. I know exactly how to explain this.”
“Okay, now don’t get too excited or you might wake Jack, and then we’ll
“I’ll give you two,” she replied, “one, you can’t kill me. And two, if you do, this will all be for nothing, and the world would be thrown out of balance.”
“Just let go, Dean.”
“What kinds of monsters?” Dean asks, opening a few bags of tea.
Dean hears the door open and shut, and voices trailing down the stairs. Sam and Eileen are back. It only takes a few minutes before Sam barges in his room to enlighten Dean on the details of his and Eileen’s hunt. Dean asks the routine questions, did they get all the vamps, was anyone hurt, did they find anything new. Sam replies stating Eileen earned a small gash on her eyebrow and a black eye when things got dicey and a vamp threw a rock, but other than that, they escaped unscathed. Dean nods, and it isn’t long before Sam asks how it was at the bunker. Dean gives him a general run down, they took miracle and Jack to the park, Charlie had a job interview that they should hear about in another day or so. Sam notices the scabs on Dean’s knuckles and asks what happened. Dean lies, saying he scraped it on the concrete of the patio catching a ball Jack threw. Sam doesn’t seem to buy it, but doesn’t question Dean on it further. Dean must reek of turmoil, because Sam doesn’t leave long after that. No one disturbs him for the rest of the day
“Ah.” Sam nods.
“I asked if she wanted to come and she said she’d sit this one out, unless we needed the backup, but I think we’ll be fine.” Sam answers.
Cas wonders if Dean’s nightmares are usually this bad. He makes his way to Dean’s room. He opens the door, approaching Dean. As he holds his hand over Dean, Cas hears a thud behind him.
“Jack, don’t go up there!” Cas sprinted up the steps to rescue Jack. He grabbed him, and brought him back down. He held Jack as he asked his next question. “So… Amara is God?”
“Haha, I’m right there with you, Buddy.” Dean tells him. Cas shoots him a look from across the table, which Dean takes as a sign to hide in his mug. Cas turns to Jack.
“Here, I’ll take it down for him.” She grabs the bowl.
“Uh oh! It fell!” Jack says.
“Darn. That sucks that you’ll be stuck in the yard all day.” Dean shrugs.
“Wh- you do?” Dean asks, shocked.
“Then it’s working.” Dean shoots him a glare, before turning on his side.
normal life.” Billie corrected. “He’ll still have
“Well, because this is his home. Miracle is your dog, I knew you’d be happy to see him, and he needed-”
!” Well at least this experiment was a success. Dean is about to close the tab when the fine print catches his eye. Under the bold answer, there's more, and soon it becomes clear why it said “57%” before the answer. Under it reads, “57% you are bisexual!” wait...
“Good.” Cas then uses his grace as he has this whole week, to bring peace to Dean. “Now, do you feel it?” Dean sits back up, and turns to face Cas. He slowly nods his head up and down.
Three Blackbirds and one drawn-out story from Cas later, it’s almost nine thirty. Dean regrets giving that kid any tea. He crashes into his own bed, exhausted from acting out fight scenes with Cas. They had to be pirates. Cas follows, perching himself at the foot of the bed.
Mom, Sam. On the ceiling. Of course Dad taught us to protect ourselves, we had to! With what was out there-”
“Daddy says it’s teef!” Jack exclaims. Charlie chortles.
“That explains why his mom’s a b-” Cas shoots him a dark look, and Dean catches himself. “A very nice woman.”
“Hey.” She says, offering him a warm smile.
Wednesday Night:
“Oh, Buddy, you’re slacking!” Dean exclaims. Jack looks down at his arm.
“All the more reason to try and keep the peace.” Cas replies. Dean wants to argue, but he knows Cas is right.
“Oh wow! What’s this?” Cas asks.
“Because I brought him here.” Cas explains.
“You were right, Cas, about everything.” Dean sniffs, rapidly wiping away the tears before they can claim paths down his cheeks. “You said that I was sending mixed signals, and that’s true. And that was wrong of me.” Cas raises his brows.
“I’m sure they’d say the same about what actually happened with God and heaven if we ever had to explain it to them.”
“Yeah, it’s online. A position with a company called Intrepid? They do private contracting with NASA, and if I get the job, it’d be a nice raise in pay grade.” Dean raises his brows.
- last chapter!
Cas doesn’t emerge until almost noon. Usually he’s up sooner for Jack, but some Sundays he sleeps in, letting Dean turn on cartoons for him instead. This Sunday was no exception, as Jack rose just in time to wish Sam and Eileen goodbye before watching Garfield for the next hour and a half, Dean on his third bowl of cereal next to him.
“Boom. Right there, that’s what I’m talking about.” Dean explains, “I believe that's what the humans call compassion.” Dean jokes.
“No!” Dean replies. “I’m happy. Very happy.” Jack nods, satisfied. “Would you help me? I need someone to give Miracle a treat when I put him in his kennel.” Jack leaps at the opportunity.
“You’ll be missed.” Charlie says. “We’ll be sure to grab extra.” Dean nods, and the timer goes off. He grabs Jack’s lunch, stirring it. Jack stands on the tips of his toes, hands on the counter, trying to peer over. He’s what he lacks for in height, he makes up for in determination. He tries climbing the cabinet, impatient.
“DAMN IT!” He screams. “DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!” He starts punching with his other hand, until he can’t anymore. He slumps down, burying his head in his bloodied hands. He needs out of these woods. They remind him too much of Cas. He looks to the sky, even the damn stars remind him of Cas. He sees him everywhere. He can’t escape. He fights the tears. Those stupid angry tears, that burn against his frost bitten cheeks, despite it being June. Despite him fighting them with all that he has left. Dean gets back into the impala, starting it. He races down the road, blasting the classic rock station as loud as he can stand it. Hoping to drown out all the emotions that are flooding to the surface. He wants to scream, and break things and drink until it all disappears. He wants to dig a hole into the earth, and throw himself down it, burying himself and all of his problems never to be disturbed again. Instead, he drives back to the bunker, too exhausted to even battle it all. He was only gone an hour. It’s 2:39 AM. He opens the door, and slumps back down the stairs, and down the hall to his room. He shuts the door, collapsing onto his bed, not even shrugging out of his jacket or taking off his shoes. Wishing, begging for sleep to take it all away. But it doesn’t. Instead, he lay awake, wondering what Cas is thinking, or if he’s even awake at all.
“Yeah, you know what? No, I’m not doing this with you. Not today. I’m not gonna sit here and play pretend, and let you weasel your way out of dealing with things with your stupid sarcastic banter. Because you always do this, and I’m sick of it. For so many years, I idolized you. Because you were the best brother ever. And you know what? I was right. You are the best brother. But you know what else? You suck. You also suck so bad, Dean, because you always do this. You always push me away, push Bobby away, push
“Charlie, I think I’m having a crisis.” Charlie places her hand on his shoulder, reassuringly.
Dean has made BLT sandwiches for all of them, and even Charlie snacks on one. Jack crawls up on his chair, a sippy cup of grape juice in front of him.
“Can I… I… Can I eat it outside?” Jack asks.
Dean knows he’s dreaming this time. Still, his heart doesn’t slow when the cliff crumbles below their feet, swallowing Cas whole. He can still hear his screams after his eyes force themselves open. Dean tries catching his breath, his heart hammering in his ears. He checks to see if he woke Cas, and is satisfied watching his chest rising and falling slowly. He’s fast asleep. It helps Dean in a way, knowing that at least one of them is at peace. Dean sinks back onto his side, hoping sleep doesn’t claim him too quickly.
cave.” Dean argues.
She doesn’t seem upset by it.
“Cas, you gotta understand, this is crazy, right?”
“No.” Cas repeats, “my happiness isn’t in heaven.” This shuts Dean up. It’s the way he used that word again, after saying it before…. When the empty took him. His
“Dee?” He asks. Dean rinses his hand off in the sink. “Dee?”
“All will be revealed when it needs to be.” Amara said. “We still must be wary that this ends the way it’s supposed to.”
“Because you’ll need to understand what’s happening with Jack.” Billie cut in. “As he grows, so will his power. He may be a child now, but he’s still the most powerful thing in creation. Even before these new rules, Jack felt things very deeply. He always has. Now, it’s going to be that much harder for him. He’ll live a full earthly life, but eventually, he will return to heaven and take his place as the new god.” Dean gritted his teeth. He didn’t like the idea of that poor kid taking on such a big responsibility.
“It’s the same as all the other pillows on this damn bed, now give it back!” Dean hisses, reaching for it. Cas swipes it away from him.
“Well… lately I’ve been. I don’t know… noticing things that I never really had time to think about before.”
that.” Dean says, “but it doesn’t help solve anything. I failed Cas. After all those times he pulled through for us, after everything he sacrificed, I still…Nothing can change that.” Dean glares at the table, as if staring at the same stain on the wood will somehow fix it. Sam leans back in his chair, almost frustrated. He grabs the bridge of his nose, pressing his fingers together, like mothers do when arguing with a toddler. Dean can feel the annoyance climbing in Sam’s voice. Dean wonders that maybe he’ll realize this is a stupid conversation they’re having, and go back to bed and just leave it all alone.
“Yeah except the difference is we lived it.”
“Well stop it. It’s not your fault I have nightmares, it comes with the job.” Dean insists.
“Cas, wait.” Dean follows him into the hall, grabbing his arm, and Cas turns to him, and the only way to describe the look on his face is with the word hurt. Dean tried to explain. “Just- I don’t know! I mean, first it was just the little things, people saying things, hands brushing… but then came the nights when we would just hang out, and I thought that was fine, and then the- the flowers, and then the jet ski, and we’re raising a kid together, you know that’s weird but whatever, but then you were rubbing sunscreen on my back, and now we’re sharing ice creams and- and a freaking bed?!!?! What the hell?! Cas this isn’t- i didn’t- I was fine with it at first, you know, whatever, but… I can’t- I didn’t mean- I just… We-” he stops.
“Well, yes, but, no.” Dean says. He sighs.
“Are you sad?” Jack asks.
“Dean. Wait.” Cas commands, before Dean is able to swing around the corner of the hall. Dean stops, glancing at the floor. Cas approaches him. Dean’s heart jumps, unsure of what Cas is planning on doing. Cas stops, standing barely a foot away from him, a solemn look on his face. His crystal blue eyes burn into Dean, who finds he can’t bring his eyes to look away from them. “
. Dean takes another sip of his drink, attempting to swallow his fear. Instead he’s left with a small pit forming in his stomach.
“Only cause I always win.” Sam brags.
Dean’s head is spinning.
“I thought you were tired of Star Wars.” Dean teases, grabbing a beer from the fridge.
“It’s fine, really, Cas. And we can hire a nanny for things we might get wrong.”
He thinks.
“I’m sorry if I… crossed a line somewhere. But Dean, it’s hard to know where the line is. I thought you-” he stops himself. “Never mind. It’s not important.” Cas rises, ducking out of the room.
“Dee! Dee! I need to tell you a surprise.” Dean leans down so Jack can whisper in his ear. “
“Well, the angels that choose to stay will have to adapt to human life. But it won’t be so… difficult this time. No, we’re breaking one of Chuck’s rules.” Amara stated, “Angels will be able to experience human things. Emotions, free will, entertainment, art, culture, sustenance, sleep, all of it.” Amara continued. “As for those who choose to stay in heaven, they will still experience those things while saving their grace for heavenly duties.”
“Truth is, it’s all… slowing down. Ya know? I’m figuring things out right now, I haven’t been on a case in nearly a month. And I’m not sure I want to, with Jack being as young as he is…”
“Dean, you’re not a narcissist.”
“What about Charlie?”
“So… how are things? You know… how do you feel?” She asks. He stares into his coffee mug. He had been trying to avoid thinking about their earlier conversation, which hadn’t been working, of course.
“Shut up.” Dean says, shutting off his lamp. It’s silent for a moment before Cas speaks.
“Does it really matter?” Dean asks, extending his arm to try and grab it. Cas only pulls it further out of reach. His eyes narrow.
“You weren’t there, Sam. You didn’t see- you didn’t
“Dean, I know about the nightmares, okay? So can we cut the crap? Just tell me what’s eating you.”
“Really? I don’t think so.” He inspects it thoughtfully. “No, this one is definitely different. It’s squishy.”
“No. I still like orange sherbet.” Cas says. Dean chuckles.
“Why are you up, Sam?” Dean asks, “It’s almost 2 o’clock in the morning.”
“Who do you want to tuck you in today?” Dean asks. Jack points to Cas, so Cas tucks him in.
“I’ll show you, they’re tv things.”
“Jack, what are you doing?” Cas asks.
“Can I play on the slide?” Jack asks him. Dean nods, following him down the stairs to the yard. Dean decides to dig further down the fence line, making room to water the milkweed Cas wants to add. Good thing he had extra pvc leftover. While the adhesive dries on the new extension, Dean attempts to screw one of the sprinkler heads into the pipe nearest the lavender. It catches, and his hand slips, a corner of the plastic slicing into his palm.
“Nope.”
“Just shut up and try it. I promise it’s good.” Dean’s taken back to a moment not so long before, when he was having Cas try pop rocks and cotton candy. Cas licks the cone, then pauses thoughtfully.
“Good.” Jack’s brows furrow.
“Sam’s a wuss.” Dean says, taking as big of a bite he can out of his own ice cream for extra measure. Cas rolls his eyes, but can’t help cracking a smile. A car passes, and Jack points to it.
“I know, I
“I’m okay, Jack.” Dean says. He turns off the tap, showing his hand with the blood all washed off. “See?” Dean ducks it back into the sink before more blood can rush to the surface. He rinses it off for a few more minutes, and soon the bleeding slows, almost stopping completely. He dabs it with a washcloth, before grabbing a band-aid from the pantry. He sits on the couch, peeling off the wrapper. Jack follows close behind. He pokes at Dean’s hand.
“You know what that is?” He asks Dean. Dean sniffs, nonchalant.
“Yeah, she’s gonna work with NASA.” She rolls her eyes.
you?” The angel standing across from Dean smiled.
“Yeah I’ll make you some Spaghetti-Os.” Dean says, turning into the pantry to grab a can. “What’s the mystery?” He asks Charlie over his shoulder.
“How much more time?” Dean asked.
“Sam, this is stupid.”
“How did you even hear me? These walls are cement. Literally, cement.” Dean inquires. Cas was not prepared for this question. Cas feels his cheeks grow warm. He averts his gaze from Dean, who only moves to face Cas, in an attempt to read his expression for an answer. Cas has no choice but to meet Dean’s eyes.
“Yum! Yummy, yum!” He points up to the bowl of fruit. Dean picks him up once more, taking out different fruits from his assorted salad, and offering them to Jack. Jack seems to prefer strawberries and bananas to pineapple, blueberries, or cantaloupe. As Cas watches them, he feels hopeful. Maybe things can work out for them. For all of them. Jack, Dean, Sam, Eileen, and him. Maybe, they can all be happy. Truly happy.
“You really shouldn’t play with knives, Dean.”
“I dunno. Three, maybe four days. We’re leaving at ten.” Dean nods.
“It looks weird.” Jack answers. “I don’t like cuzzini.”
“Maybe you should play there last,” Dean says. Jack nods, now wanting to swing on the swing. The baby swing looks like a car seat attached to chains.
“Yeah, yeah I remember.” Dean laughs.
“Purple, yeah. That’s Sam’s favorite.” Jack nods vigorously. “Well that is a perfect rainbow, Jack. I love it!” Jack beams.
“Dean I can’t just sit here and watch you suffer, when I know I can make it stop.”
“I’ll figure it out.” Cas nods. That’s good enough for him, for now, he can’t ask much more from Dean. “Whatever the case, I’m ready.”
“I’ll explain once your brother controls himself and stops acting like a child who got his toy taken away.” It took everything for Dean not to spit at her. “Before you killed me, Dean, I saw one last possibility for us to defeat Chuck.” She began, “and that was for Jack to defeat him, take his powers, and then give them to Amara.”
Dean finishes his burger and fries in the impala. What he wants more than anything is for his brain to stop thinking about it. He needs to get back to the bunker, take a nap, and forget all about it. He pulls in front of the bunker, grabs the keys, and locks up Baby. He makes a note of hoping that no one will have noticed he left or is returning. Those hopes are immediately dashed when he opens the door and sees Charlie sitting at the table, typing away on her laptop. She looks up at him.
you want?” Cas asks. Damn it. This is exactly the kind of question Dean was hoping to avoid. Because in all honesty, that’s what’s causing him the most brainworms. It’s all he’s been able to think about since the war against Chuck ended. Now he has time and space to explore what he wants. Something Dean was never able to indulge in in the past. Now, he’s left pondering what matters to him and what he wants his future to be, at 1:28 AM, with a beer in hand, and a nosy, albeit caring angel at his side. That’s one thing Dean has always found remarkable about Cas. Maybe it’s his grounded sense of genuity, or maybe it’s his desire to always do what’s right, but something about Cas really highlights his sense of compassion. to Dean, at least.
“A little, but I’m okay. Watch.” Dean folds the band-aid over it. “See? All better.” Jack furrows his brows, turning over Dean’s hand to look at his knuckles, which are scabbed over. Jack stares at it curiously.
- sorry the dialogue formatting was weird, but I fixed it now.
“Like those people mistaking you and Cas for a couple.” Dean nods.
“No it’s- Cas, this is nuts, okay? Nuts!”
“No.” Cas turns to Dean, “No, I don’t want that. Not for you, or Jack, or… me.”
“You what? How? What- with your grace?” Dean asks.
“Yeah, why don’t you color outside?” Dean wants to keep an eye on him, last time he caught Jack trying to eat the crayons, he damn near had a heart attack thinking he was gonna choke on them. Jack grabs his box of crayons and a piece of paper, heading down the stairs. Dean walks behind him, helping him take them one at a time.
“Not quite,” Amara answered, “We still need soldiers to carry out tasks, to protect certain things, run things in heaven.” She paused for a moment before disclosing her decision, “Instead, we’re adding a new rule. Angels will still have their grace, but, if an angel leaves heaven, and goes to earth, their grace will be drained.”
Dean grabs Miracle’s leash, before he can leap out of the car to chase down a squirrel climbing by the trees. Cas picked out this park. It’s nice. There are several parts to it, with a nice sidewalk path between them, lined with trees. This particular park is built for younger children. It has a few baby swings, a small jungle-gym maze, a slide that can’t be more than six feet tall with wood chips at the bottom, and a small sand pit. Jack beelines it straight for the sandbox. Dean catches him, scooping him up before he can reach it.
“Well, after you…” He trailed off, but started again, trying not to lose it. “Lucifer and Michael killed each other, Uh… Jack took Chuck’s power, and brought everyone back. He brought back Billie, and he gave Chuck’s power to Amara, who became ‘Life’ instead of just the darkness, and she turned Jack into…” He pointed at the toddler, who was preoccupied with climbing the stairs to the door, one at a time.
“Thank you.” Amara said, once settled back into her prior form. “Now just one more thing before you give me that power, Jack. You know what to do.” Jack nodded. This confused Dean. He didn’t know there was a secret phase two and a half! Then he heard it from behind.
. He doesn’t want to unpack his midlife crisis with Cas. Cas doesn’t shift his gaze from Dean.
“Yeah, well, maybe they’re not as rusty as you think.” Cas tilts his head, smiling at Dean. “Come on, I’m craving ice cream.” He says, rising from the bench. He calls to Jack, pocketing his phone. “Alright kiddo, time to go.”
for Dean’s giant of a brother? Sam notices Dean laughing at his pants, and rolls his eyes.
“Hello!” Jack greets him. Dean smiles.
“I’m gonna miss you, kiddo.” Dean said, while he also gave Jack a hug.
“Okay.” Cas says.
“It’s… ya know. Die…drate…” When Cas’s brow only twists into more confusion, Dean waves it off. “Never mind.”
“It was just another nightmare, Cas, I’m fine.” Dean runs his hand through his hair, slumping back onto his bed. He looks up at Cas, who still stands in his doorway. “You’re still here.”
“It’s beautiful, Jack.” When he releases him, he hands Jack his paper back. “Listen to me, kid. I need you to know something.” Jack meets his eyes, obedient. “You are the best kid in the entire world, you know that? And Cas loves you very much, and I love you very much. And so does Sam and so does Eileen.” He taps his finger over Jack’s heart. “And you have a very kind heart. Don’t ever lose that, Jack. Don’t… change that for anyone. No matter what. Promise me, that you’ll never change. Can you do that? Can you promise?” Jack, who definitely isn’t absorbing this as much as Dean thought he could, nods his head.
“Gimme one good reason not to kill you again.” Billie forced him on his knees with the powers from her staff.
“Queen!” Jack exclaims from his car seat. Dean smirks.
“What’s in tea?” Jack asks.
“That’s a long title.” Cas says.
“Yeah, sorry I didn’t see you. Uh… I was busy, looking for jobs.” He lies. There’s no way he’s going to involve Jack in this any more than he already is. Jack nods.
Is that a Katy Perry reference?
“All done!” Jack exclaims.
“Oh.” Charlie replies. “And how did that make you feel?”
What Cas didn’t anticipate was Dean having multiple nightmares in one night. This time, Dean’s screaming is so agonizing, Cas feels as if his head will split open. He leaps out of bed, shaking off any remnant of sleep that had overtaken him before. He checks the time again. 3:26 AM. He hastily makes his way to Dean’s room, rids his dreams of fear, and returns to his own bed, his body feeling heavy. Maybe he’ll try that coffee substance Dean drinks unholy amounts of in the morning.
“What’s wrong, Cas?” Dean grins from the other side of the table, “Is it too bitter for you?”
“He spent all morning following it around. He finally caught it on one of the fuchsia buds.” Cas explains. He turns to Charlie.
- this one’s short lol.
“It’s your turn, Big Bird.” Dean says.
“Uhh.. yeah. Fine- good. It’s all... I’m figuring it out.” He finally manages. She nods.
“What’s in a week?” Dean asks.
.” Dean answers without answering. Charlie for sure noticed that he dodged the question, but she doesn’t seem to push it.
“Yes I do! Look, Sam, maybe you can settle down and have the- the apple pie life. You always could, and you know what? I’m happy for you, No really, I am. It makes me so glad that you can separate yourself from this, but I can’t! Saving people, hunting things, it’s the family business!” Dean’s chair scrapes the floor as he stands, abruptly. Sam collapses back in his chair, as if he had an epiphany.
“Then stop.” Cas says. Dean listens. He turns.
“To meeeeee.”
- mentions of childhood trauma
did you decide to put him on a leash, and take him back with you?”
“But these are different. I felt them when you prayed to me, they felt… there are no words, Dean. It was just painful. So much fear… that’s not normal.” Cas ponders a moment. “You got them when I came back. Maybe me being so close…” He pauses, thinking. “I should just leave.”
“Everyone says that like it’s a curse word, but in reality, he was just a man.” Cas says, crawling up to the top of the bed. “And his name wasn’t pronounced like that. ‘jee-zus’. He wasn’t caucasian. He was born in Bethlehem. It was pronounced ‘hey-zoos’.”
yourself to be happy?” Dean looks almost offended, but it’s quickly replaced with indignation.
“Dean are you alright? Have you been crying?” Dean brushes past him.
“Yeah like how chocolate was your favorite last month.” Cas shrugs.
“It doesn’t make any sense.” Cas says.
“Well, I suppose so.”
“But where is it now?” Cas asks. “The… remix, so to speak.” Dean gets that expression across his face that he only gets when he has a great idea, or is proven right about something.
“What’s wrong with your eye?” He asked. Dean smiled, embarrassed.
“How did the interview go?” Dean asks her. She sighs.
” He whispers. Dean battles a snicker.
“I don’t like it.” Jack says, stubborn as a mule. Dean has to hide his smirk with a bite of pizza. He knows pointing out the uncanny similarity between the two would land him a glare from Cas.
“Yes, like my leg.” Dean says. “But Jack, sometimes it’s better that you don’t… fix it.” He says. “Like what you did just now? That’s special, Jack, very special. No one else can do that, well, Cas can, but other people can’t. It’s like…” he tries to find a way to explain this to a toddler. Jack stares at Dean attentively, which is rare for his attention span. Dean’s eye catches the small hulk action figure on the couch. “Like the avengers!” He exclaims. “You know how Spider-Man has superpowers?” Jack nods, excitedly. “Well, it’s like that. You have superpowers just like Spider-Man. But you know how Spider-Man has to keep it a secret?” Jack’s brows furrow in concentration.
“What caused them?” Cas asks. Dean almost laughs at the question, as if the years of monster hunting, guilt, and grief weren’t enough. But Dean understands what Cas means. Why are they so much worse than the usual nightmares Dean’s always dealt with? What caused them to start so violently, so suddenly? Dean knows the answer, but isn’t sure that he’s ready to share it with Cas. To do that, he would have to tell Cas everything he now knows. Everything he learned about Cas, when he went to go see Billie and Amara just a few days before the nightmares started. Instead, Dean just shrugs.
“Hey, Dean. We’re all downstairs trying to solve a mystery, care to join us?” She asks, passing him to get a glass and fill it with water.
“Because the sun will warm up the pitcher, and that will heat up the water, so it soaks up the tea bags and gets all of the tea out of it to flavor the water.” Dean explains.
“One more thing.” Billie said, “we’re changing a few things around.” Dean furrowed his brow.
“You know, it’s funny. Earlier, Dean told me that he kinda looks like you.” Sam paused for a moment to examine Jack and Cas. “I can kind of see it, now.” Dean’s face turned bright red, but he said nothing in defence.
“Then you stunned them into silence.” Dean says. She grins.
“Did you get a owie?” He asks. Dean offers him a reassuring smile.
” Of course, the link belongs to a site Dean believes is akin to buzzfeed, so obviously not reliable. His eyes land on the image of the quiz, a square with four boxes, each different colors and listing a different sexuality. A blue one says “
“That’s what you want?” Cas asks. “You’re sure?” Dean nods. “Okay.” Cas turns to exit down the hall, but finds himself turning back around. He stands across from Dean, silent. He reaches out for Dean’s hand.
“I suppose I should rest a little, but I’m still not leaving until you let me use my grace to help you.”
” Dean throws down the last card in defeat. Sam laughs.
“And what if he starts out with one of those little plastic toy slides that you get at Walmart, because I don’t want to make something too tall that he’ll fall out of.” Dean continues, as they head inside. Cas stops, he looks at Dean, as if trying to read his thoughts.
——————- end of fic ——————-
” He clicks on the tab, curious.
Cas sits there, like an animal caught in a trap, waiting to be put out of his misery.
“Okay kid, time for phase two,” Dean told Jack, “think you can do this?” He asked. Jack nodded, closing his eyes. He turned his hands on himself, as if pulling power from his body, which worked, as he successfully brought Amara back into the world.
- the next fic is only be one chapter. It’ll be the last of this series.
“Ready?” Jack asks. Cas nods. “One… two… three!” Jack yanks the towel off the pitcher, revealing the honey-colored drink.
“Huh. Good question, Jack. I don’t know. I just used the sweet tea box. It didn’t say.” Jack nods. Dean returns his attention to the pitcher on the patio table. “Alright. Now we just leave the tea here for the rest of the day, and it should be ready by dinner time. After we add the sugar, of course.” Jack claps.
“No thanks.” He says.
?” Dean asked in disbelief. “Is it
“Cas-”
“‘It’? What ‘it’?” Dean asks. Sam stares at him, hard. His expression switches to something unreadable, as if his train of thought changes tracks before answering.
“It felt unnatural. I think that’s another reason I knew. Because when I kissed girls, that felt natural.” Charlie explains. Dean wishes there was a way to stop his brain from thinking without his permission.
“You mean the game of losers.” Sam says.
“Like father, like son.” Dean commented.
“Why don’t you think you can ever be happy?”
“Hey, sport. I thought you were watching Avengers with Cas and Charlie.”
“Okay, so what, are you gonna make them all human?” Dean asked.
“Cas, stop reading in the dark. It’s bad for your eyes. Before you know it, you’ll need glasses.” He yawns, checking his watch.
“No.” He crosses his arms like a stubborn toddler. “Not until you let me help you.” Dean rolls his eyes. Typical. He gets back under his covers, smashing his head into his pillow.
Dean knows this for a fact. He likes women way too much to be gay. He’s not gay. So did he even feel anything at all? Or was it all just nerves for stepping outside of his comfort zone? For taking a risk? He was experimenting, figuring it all out, but the experiment failed. He didn’t get the answer he’d hypothesized. That’s what a failed experiment is, right? When your results aren’t the answer you expected. Well he didn’t expect Cas to kiss him back, and he definitely didn’t expect to
“Well, okay, what happens? In your dreams?” Dean stares at the table, as if thinking his answer through carefully.
“So what happens then?” Dean asked.
“Though, it was entertaining watching her reaction when you grabbed my hand.” Dean takes that victory.
“Cas? You kissed
“No!” Dean was so occupied with how loud he said it, that he didn't even catch his arm from swinging out and gripping Cas, as if he would leave right this second. He feels his face burn, as he pulls his hand away. “That won’t solve anything. Plus Jack.” Cas looks at him hard, sighing.
“Why?”
.” Finally, Dean swung open the door, tossing up the blade in front of him in defense, when he became paralyzed, dropping the blade. His eyes grew wide, and his lungs momentarily stopped working, waiting for his heart to catch up to the sight that stood before him outside the threshold.
“Amara said he’ll get his memories back as he grows older.” Sam explained to Cas.
“Depends on the memory. For example, killing Mary, your mother. He probably won’t remember that until he’s in his teens or early adult years. When he can process that information properly. But memories like who you are? Those will come a lot sooner.” Amara replied. Sam nodded his head.
“Is that even true? The counting thing?” Sam asks.
“No,” Dean stopped him, “no, I-” he dropped his head in his hands, rubbing his eyes that started to sting with tears once more. “I can’t. Not now,” Dean continued. Sam looked at his brother, he was almost heartbroken for him, but unsure how to help. “Not ye-” Dean was interrupted by the buzzing of his phone. He sighed, trying to get a hold on his emotions, before answering. He looked down at the caller I.D. Then he froze, as he saw it in small, glowing text:
NO. STOP. He promised himself he wouldn’t go there. That he wouldn’t remember. But it’s too late. The memory floods him, like the river of a dam that’s been cracked. Dean couldn’t have been older than fourteen. He had befriended one of the neighborhood boys. Trevor- no… Donovan. His name was Donovan. He had one of those four wheelers that you could ride around in the soccer fields just outside the neighborhood. They hadn’t been in that apartment longer than a few weeks. But when John left for a routine salt and burn just a few houses down, Dean snuck out. He forgot to take the mac n cheese he made for Sammy off the stove. He went to Donovan’s house, and they rode his four wheeler around the field behind his house. There wasn’t a fire, not even smoke, at least Dean doesn’t remember there being any. He just burned it a little. But when John went back to the apartment, and found that Dean had left, he must have heard the motor of the four wheeler, and put two and two together. He marched out there, and… Dean can still feel the pit in his stomach remembering how John shouted his name. Like he had just murdered someone. “
“It’s in my abdomen?” Cas asks, confused, and slightly alarmed.
After a few moments, Dean can’t take it anymore.
“No!” The tears come back, Dean can no longer fight them.
“Well, yes-”
“What? Cas that doesn’t make any sense. What the hell are you talking about, man?”
to talk. Like he’s some… therapist or something.”
“That was a very nice lullab-” Dean cuts him off.
“Dean?” Dean scrambles up from his spot on the bench, reaching for his keys. He manages to find them in his pocket, and starts running for the car. “Dean, wait!” Dean doesn’t slow, he just keeps running and running. He only stops when he hears a blood-curdling scream.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled, “I’m Dean.” Jack’s face then twisted in confusion. He pointed his finger up at Dean’s face, poking just under his eye.
“What- pray in my sleep? No, that’s impossible. How can you pray in your sleep? That doesn’t make any sense.” Dean says.
“Mi-wah-call!” Jack exclaimed, using grabby hands to communicate that he wanted to be set down to pet the dog. Dean stood, staring, not being able to process his prayer incarnate. He reached out, unable to control the well of tears in his eyes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. Dean grabbed the Trenchcoat with his hand, realizing that what he was seeing was real. He pulled Cas into a hug, his tears escaped his eyes, and flooded down his face. A few seconds passed, and Cas went to pull away from Dean.
“Actually, not really. I mean, some people find out sooner than others, others find out later. Some people might not even find out until they’re 80 or 90 years old.” Charlie explains.
Dean holds his finger over “D.” It’s true, Dean never has been in a relationship with a man. He clicks it. The screen becomes blank, besides a gif of a pair of cartoon dice rolling, a circle spinning under it, indicating that it is loading. Dean is filled with a sense of dread, but why? It’s just a stupid quiz. Dean immediately feels relief flood him when this “stupid quiz” pops up with the result, which reads “
“No? Why not?” He asks as Jack passes him in the hall.
“Charlie… did you ever, I dunno… did you ever kiss any boys?” And the second the question leaves his mouth Dean regrets it. He wishes he could grab it right out of the air and shove it back down his throat. But he can’t. Instead, he just sits there and lets the complete stupidity of what he has done wash over him. Charlie doesn’t think too long before answering.
“And how are you adjusting, with all of... that?” He asks. Cas sighs.
“But Jack, you have to wait for it to get dark outside first.” He pauses, dramatically. “Unless… you what to take a nap?” Jack springs out of bed.
“Shut up, Sammy.” Dean says, Eileen lets out a chuckle. Cas offers the salt to Jack, who sprinkles it onto the “pizza”, but still won’t try it.
“Fine.” Dean says, laying back on the bed, following Cas’s directions.
“I actually prefer mine this way, but most people like to add sugar or milk to balance it out a bit.” Dean suggests. Cas rises, dragging his blanket with him into the kitchen. He grabs the glass jar full of sugar, unclipping it. He picks it up, and starts pouring it into his mug. Dean leaps up out of his chair.
Dean isn’t sure why his finger lingers. He hastily clicks on B. Duh. The next question is just like the first, but with different answers.
“But it’s true, Dean. You spent your whole life raising Sam. And there was that time with…” Cas debates bringing up Lisa and Ben, but decides he’s gone too far to turn back now. “With Ben.” Dean looks at Cas, his expression unreadable, something akin to concentration, almost. It’s silent for a moment.
“It’s kind of funny,” Dean started, “doesn’t he look like Cas, a little?” As Dean said his name, tears threatened to claim paths down his cheeks, but Dean hastily blinked them away before they had the chance. Sam looked back at Jack.
“Uh… mostly just my name I think,” Cas starts, “with prayers… it's different than how it is when someone just speaks to you, you… pick up on things, like emotions. It's like you feel that person’s pain, or- or joy, or fear.” Cas explains. Dean sits silently, waiting for further explanation. “And… whatever you were dreaming about, whatever nightmare you were having… Dean, I felt it. The pain, the fear, the guilt. I felt it all. And I saw you struggling, and I just couldn’t leave you like that.”
- this is kinda sad
“Uh… not where I was going with this, but ok. So why is he here, instead of on the street begging someone for a hotdog from one of those hot dog stands?”
“I mean, If you asked me a year ago, I would have told you I was straight. Like. One hundred- okay maybe… ninety eight percent.” Dean admits. It’s true. Charlie listens, patiently. “But lately… I don’t know. Some things have happened since, and I’m not quite sure.”
“So we’ve been playing this game for fifteen minutes. When are you gonna tell me why you’re actually awake?”
“Yeah, and here I am using that ‘rest’ to keep you from your own, while also dumping my sob stories onto you. ”
? Our Cas?” Dean wants to deny it, take it back, play it off as some joke, but his expression says it all. It’s written all over his damn face and he knows he can’t hide it. “Holy Smokes.” She says. Dean lets out a nervous laugh.
“Better.” Cas echos. Dean rocks his fist triumphantly in the air,
. Dean had gotten so used to the nightmare with Billie and Cas and the Empty that he somehow forgot that other nightmares do exist. He sighs, trying to rub the images from his eyes, but no matter how hard he presses against his skull, he can’t be rid of the sound of Cas screaming.
“Sam said people who bite into their ice cream are crazy.” Cas explains.
“Hang on, Buddy, you gotta let it cool down first.” Dean says. “You gotta stir it, and blow on it like this.” Dean lifts the spoon, blowing on a small pile of Spaghetti-Os that spill from the sides of the spoon.
“Is that-?” Cas asked.
he knows what she means. She continues. “But I think I really started to take notice when I was maybe eight or ten. I had a crush on this girl in my class, her name was Annie.” Charlie smiles, remembering. “It obviously didn’t work out.” Dean chuckles, nudging her.
Dean springs forward, and his face makes hard contact with the floor. Another nightmare, another bruise for tomorrow.
“Just stay with me,” Dean continues, “so why did you bring him here?”
“But I wasn’t there for him, Sam! I wasn’t there when he needed me. After everything, everything he’s done, everything he’s- he’s sacrificed! Think about it, the guy has been through hell, he’s been tortured and killed and he doesn’t ask for much in return. He doesn’t. And he just- he needed me to be there, to understand him, to
This time the trees around the forest bench grow arms, pulling Dean away from Cas, as he falls from the cliff into nothingness. Dean wakes, still feeling the branches wrapped around him. He slowly begins to realize that those aren’t tree branches, but Cas, who has somehow managed to tangle his arms around Dean, like a hug from behind. Dean weighs his options. He could try to detangle himself from Cas, and risk waking him, which would be embarrassing for them both. Or, Dean could just fall back asleep, and wake up later after Cas is already gone, and pretend this never happened. He tries to decide which is better, Dean successfully slinking out of Cas’s arms, so Cas doesn’t even know it ever happened, or staying and leaving Cas to think Dean never had a clue. His stomach fills with dread, when Cas inhales deeply, stirring awake.
to him. And I wasn’t there. What kind of a friend am I?” Dean explains. Sam looks confused.
“Mmmm!” He says, satisfied.
“Out! Out!” Cas extends his arms, unfolding the blanket to expose Jack to the outside world again. He hops out of Cas’s lap to the ground, leaving his own blanket behind. He runs up to Dean, who is now in the kitchen, preparing himself a fruit salad from Sam’s smoothie leftovers. Jack tugs on Dean’s pajama pants.
“That’s right, Jack. We are growing strawberries in the garden.”
. Dean contemplates staying there, letting the cold from the floor soak into his skin. But he scrambles up when his door flies open.
“Cammanille is a plant?” Dean smiles.
“No. No way. It’s not worth it.” Dean cuts him off. Cas huffs, sitting next to Dean, shutting the door behind him.
“Nice.” Dean grabs his coffee, leaning against the counter to face her.
intend to…” Cas trails off, thinking. “Damn it, Dean!”
” Dean exclaims, barely above a whisper, “You almost got stabbed, you know that?!” Dean points his knife at Cas, before slamming it down in his nightstand. He rubs his eyes with his hand, laying back down on his bed.
“Professionally Certified Ethical Hacker.” He smirks.
Dean wishes he could honestly click D, but he knows he can’t. Damn it. Does it even count? He kissed
“It’s yummy!” Cas takes a sip next.
“Woah! What the hell, Cas?!” He yanks down the chord on his lamp, sending a sharp yellow-tinted light through the room. Cas sits up, puzzled. He stares at Dean with furrowed brows. He finds he can’t say anything, his mind still scrambling to understand what has just unfolded. All he can manage is a half question, half statement.
“It shouldn’t have been on us! That was Dad’s job. Not yours. Dad was the one who was supposed to protect us. And if he had done the job right, he would never have exposed us to the life, never!” Sam argues.
“Jesus, Cas, just take this and shut up.” Dean grabs another pillow for himself, and sighs out of frustration.
“Fine. Stay. but get some shut eye, you still need rest.” He says, rubbing his eyes.
” When he finally arrives, his foot catches something and he barrels forward, as the trees and brush all grow, towering over him, surrounding him in a pit of darkness and despair.  He doesn’t stop falling until his head jerks up. He reaches out for nothing, unbalanced, and hits the hardwood floor with a
“Hey, later we’re all gonna go get some fireworks for the Fourth of July, you know, before they sell out next month. You coming with?” She asks. Dean feigns a sigh of regret.
“Mmm.” Is all Cas can manage. Dean chuckles. Who would’ve thought he wouldn’t be a morning person? With all that angelic grace, you’d think he would be full of energy. He hears Cas starting the coffee pot.
Dean wonders,
“Oh? Why’s that?” She asks. Dean inhales deeply.
“You take that back.” Dean threatens.
“Don’t leave. You still have more to say, I can see it.” Cas rises, approaching him. “You’re scared,” he peers into Dean’s eyes, which are filling with the tears he can no longer fight. “You’re afraid I might… be angry at you, or push you away. Don’t be. I won’t.” He points Dean back to his spot. “Just tell me how you feel. All of it. I’ll listen.” Dean returns to his seat next to Cas.
- nightmares
“I’m making smoothies.” He explains, returning to the kitchen. A few seconds later, a dreadfully loud grinding noise erupts from the kitchen. Cas drops his head back down onto the table, the sound of the blender overstimulating his brain, which feels like it’s pounding against his skull. A few moments later, he takes a sip from his mug, scrunching his face in disgust.
“What makes you say that?” Dean tilts his head.
Dean offers his cone in trade.
“Wow, Jack, that looks really good!” Dean says. Jack nods.
“Woah! Slow down, Cas!” He approaches Cas, who is no longer adding sugar to his coffee. Dean laughs, “Don’t dump it all in, next thing you know, you’ll have a sugar crash!” He grabs the sugar from Cas, shooing him away from the mug on the counter. “Let me.” Cas grabs the ends of his blanket, pulling them together so he’s warm again, and waddles back to his chair, defeated. He watches from the table, as Dean empties the mug into the sink, and refills it with fresh coffee. He then uses a small spoon to scoop a few mounds of sugar into the mug, stirring it. He then goes to the fridge, and grabs the milk. Cas watches as Dean pours the smallest amount of milk into his drink. He stirs it, then brings the spoon to his mouth, taking a sip. He nods his head, satisfied by the concoction before him. He brings it to the table, and sets it in front of Cas. Cas takes a sip of the sweet drink. “Better?” Dean asks. A smile creeps across Cas’s face. He likes this very much.
He scrambles down to pick them up, scanning the surrounding aisles to make sure no one else noticed. He feels his face get hot, and his stomach twists. He shoves the books back into place, and darts out from behind the aisle, hugging the “ultimate guide” to his chest. Luckily, no one else seems to have noticed his little misadventure. He manages to sneak off to a small corner with a table to read.
Dean catches himself.
“What? Why?” Sam asked.
Warnings for:
“Dean, I think we both know I can-”
“Alright, kiddo.” Dean lifts him up so he can sit on the counter. “We’re gonna make the best sun tea in the whole world!” Jack squeals. “First, we take the tea bags and put them in the water.” Dean explains, dropping one of the bags in and setting the string on the side. He hands Jack the other tea bag, and Jack drops the string in too.
“Can I see?” Dean lifts his hand to show Jack. “Does it hurt?” He asks.
“Thanks.” Dean’s learned to just take the compliment. They find a place under a shady oak tree. Jack curiously picks up an acorn and tosses it as far as he can. “Careful, Jack. Here. You’re dripping. Eat first, play later.” Dean says. “Cuz if you drop it, Miracle will eat it.” He nods toward the dog, who Cas is currently tying to a low enough hanging tree limb. They picked up one of the small ice cream cups and a water bottle for him. Cas pours a little bit of the water for Miracle, who laps it up quickly. Cas returns to Dean and Jack, and Dean passes him his cone. Orange sherbet. Dean takes a bite out of his own ice cream, which is chocolate raspberry truffle. Cas smiles.
“Look, I'm just saying I don’t want to take advantage of you. I can’t tell if this,” he grabs Cas’s hand. “I can’t tell if this is what I want, or if it was just me coming to terms with who I am.” Dean releases his hand. Cas nods, understanding. “Cas, I can’t tell you what I want, because I don’t know what I want yet. You want to know right now, but I can’t tell you, because I don’t know right now.” This seems to hurt Cas. “But, I do know what I need. I need to figure it out. And…” he looks down at his hands. “And I need you. I need you here, because I can’t… I can’t do it alone.” He looks at Cas. “I don’t need you to do anything, and I don’t want to try anything with you, but… I just need you here, man. While I figure it all out.” Dean feels Cas’s hand rest on his shoulder. His grip is firm, but gentle.
Early Morning, Monday:
“Dean, I need to understand. What do you want from me?” Cas asks.
“I don’t know.” Dean admits. He decides it’s probably best to go ahead and tell her the truth. It’s Charlie. If anyone understands, it’s her. And who’s she going to tell? She wouldn’t tell anyone. And if Dean’s being 100% honest, he doesn’t know for sure that he is straight. He was pretty damn sure until recently, and if he was… not straight, wouldn’t he have realized it a lot sooner?
“Couldn’t sleep.”  Dean answers.
“Guh-morneen!” Jack exclaims, joyfully. Dean turns Jack, so he’s facing Cas.
“Is that solitaire?” Sam asks, rubbing his eyes.
“Like your leg!” Jack interrupts.
“It’s the plant that monarch butterflies rely on as caterpillars. I saw a documentary on them a while ago. They’re an endangered species, so I’m hoping starting a milkweed garden will help them a little.” Dean smiles to himself. When he composes himself, he nods.
“So what are you thinking?” She asks. He sighs.
“Yeah, you know, pride? Hang on.” She pulls out her phone, typing into it. She hands it to Dean, scrolling through the thousands of images on google of… people. And rainbows? It’s almost overwhelming, but in a good way. Dean’s eyes dance around the screen, following all the colors and joy. People… a lot of people, smiling, laughing, marching in groups with banisters and flags like you see during parades. “These are pride marches, people from all over the world celebrate them year round, but especially in June.”
“What are you talking about? Of course I am. Jack is family.” Dean sits on the couch, setting his beer on the coffee table in front of him.
“Now what do we say, Jack?” Cas asks him. Jack beams at the man who scooped their ice cream cones.
“Sorry, Cas.” Sam starts, “We’ll try to make more palatable dishes in the future.”
“Since Sunday.” There’s a very brief pause between them. Cas continues.
“Cool.” Dean plays an ace, stacking nine of his cards on top of it. “Haha! Crazy 8’s!”
“Angels, mostly.” Billie answered. “The angels went too far this time,” She explains, “we need to put some measures in place to make sure that doesn’t happen again.”
. Cas thinks to himself.
“Right. Okay, well then what was I saying? In my… prayers?” Dean hesitates to say that last part. Somehow, this question is even harder for Cas to explain. But he tries his best.
“But it’s not something to be scared of, Jack. Because it’s good, it’s not a bad thing. And Cas and I are gonna make sure nothing ever hurts you. Okay?” Jack nods.
“No, no, no. This is bad, Cas. This isn’t-” Dean stops himself. “This isn’t supposed to happen! I’m not-” Dean rubs his hand over his face, then runs it through his hair. Trying to find a way to articulate his feelings.
“How many sleeps is next… next weekend?” Jack asks.
“Damn it, Dean.” Cas says, under his breath. Dean can feel him sliding back down so his head is level with the pillow. “I chose this.” Cas tells him, voice low and soft. “And I’d rather use my grace to help the people I care about than to watch it fade idly away for the next fifty years.”
Dean’s never dealt with a picky toddler before. There were times when Sam was younger that he would complain about having to order in chinese for the 500th time in a row, but Dean always tried to talk Sam into shutting up about it so John wouldn’t yell at him. It didn’t always work. Eventually Sam learned to stop complaining.
“Maybe. Or, you’ll get tired of me taking up space, and
“What about the balance?”
“It’s not pity, Dean, it’s guilt.”
“Yeah, well, you’re always trying to start some bar fight.” He returns Dean’s phone.
“Of course, when I said that, I hadn’t realized how terrifying of a thought it actually was for any of us. I’m starting to realize now, this may not quite be a ‘piece of cake’ as Dean often says.” Miracle licks Cas’s hand, begging for more pets. “Anyway, that’s the story of how we beat god.” Cas tells the dog, petting him, “I hope I didn’t bore you.” The dog yawns, and lays at Cas’s feet, rolling over to expose his belly. Cas hears a door slide open behind him.
“The storm.” Sam says. Dean nods. Sam’s always hated thunderstorms. Dean remembers all the nights he would spend trying to calm Sam down. He always promised that the lightning would never hit them. When Sam would ask how he knew, Dean would answer that he wouldn’t let it. Sam would always point out that Dean couldn’t control the weather, and Dean would say it didn’t matter, because he knew if anything was going to kill them, it wouldn’t be lighting. Not after everything they lived through. The game continues, Sam throws down the queen of spades. Dean grunts, frustrated. Sam somehow
“No.” Amara answered, though the confused looks on Sam and Dean’s faces said it all.
--------------—--- End of Fic-----------------
“Castiel?! Cas! No... No! CAS!” Cas looks at the alarm clock on his nightstand. It reads 3:17 AM. Cas, remembering the events from the night before, manages to calm down before exiting his room. This time, he flies into Dean’s room, to avoid opening and closing his door, which may be loud enough to wake him. Repeating the same ritual as the night before, Cas reaches his hand over Dean, using his grace to bring him peace, then flies back out again.
“I suppose it does sound a little strange.” Cas offers, “but, I’m sure other people do it, they just don’t know.” Dean looks beyond confused.
“What? No, no she’s not- nothing. It’s fine, Cas.” Dean says, finally breaking eye contact with the woman to give Cas a reassuring look. Cas, who still isn’t completely convinced, looks from Dean, to the woman, and back to Dean. He seems to put it together.
“Hello, Dean.” Finally, the dog the angel had on the leash broke free of his grip, and darted down the stairs to Sam.
“Jack, are you ready?” Amara asked. Jack nodded his head.
“Yeah, uh… yeah. Just a… a breeze. Ya know, cross-winds and that stuff.” Dean says, clearing his throat. Sam nods.
“Sun tea?”
“Milk… weed? What’s that?” Dean asks.
“Good. I’m glad you’re feeling better about it.” He scoffs lightly.
Weird. Dean closes the tab on his phone. He feels exhausted, despite not having left his place on his bed. A few minutes go by as Dean contemplates all the information he’s just received.
“What is this, guided meditation by your own personal shrink?” Dean asks.
“I slept fine. The whole night... I was never awake.” Cas says, his voice rougher than usual. This gets a confused look from Dean, who blinks as if he heard Cas wrong. But Dean shrugs it off, likely adding it to the long list of Cas’s attempt to abide by a social cue he doesn’t understand.
“Can you make tea out of lavener?” Jack asks, pointing to the purple flowers in the yard. Dean nods.
Dean pulls into one of the public libraries in Lebanon. Usually when researching for a case, he doesn’t have to look further than the library in the men of letters’ bunker. But then again, Dean highly doubts any books on… this stuff would be found among the collections of the men of letters. He turns off the impala, taking a deep breath. Dean ponders going back, forgetting about all of this and drowning his woes in some city bar. It’s tempting. He reaches for the key, to turn the ignition. His thumb strays a second longer before he yanks it out of the ignition. He needs answers. And he needs them fast. There’s only so long that he can avoid Cas, and he’ll feel better when he can push this all aside, chalking it up to some sort of psychological meltdown after his therapy session and call it at that. He steps out of Baby, locking her up, and heads straight for the tall library doors.
” Dean furrows his brow in confusion.
“Um… well, I guess that sometimes, you… kind of… pray… in your sleep.” Dean is taken aback by this answer, which he was not expecting.
“Can I have sghetti-os?” He asks.
“Oh yeah, typical, you always blame everything on Dad, well give the man a break! He did his best!” Dean exclaims.
“No, Cas. I’m not risking it. I’m the only reason you got sick in the first place. I’m not gonna be the reason you lose the rest of your grace too.” Dean shuffles over, no longer facing Cas, making it final.
Dean thinks to himself. He pauses before clicking his answer.
After dinner and a shower, Dean heads straight down the hall. He didn’t talk to Cas at all because he knows he messed up. But now, he stands outside Cas’s door, terrified to make it right. He swallows his fear, and knocks lightly on the door. It swings open almost immediately, and Dean watches Cas’s face freeze at the sight of him. Dean’s throat goes dry.
“It was Lucifer!” Dean hissed. “He called me again.”
“No, I don't think that my people skills would benefit that job very much.” Dean offers him a side-eye.
“I know.” Dean answered, offering him a smile. Jack laughed. He then held up his hand in his own special wave. Amara did it. Sam and Dean watched as he shrunk back down to toddler size.
“Yeah! But we still have to wait one sleep, okay?” Dean says, pointing up his index finger. Jack nods, thoughtfully, before darting down the hall. Cas and Dean follow him, just to see him curl into his bed, pulling the covers up to his chest.
” Jack says. Dean smiles.
“Well. If I can’t hunt monsters, I’ll just have to annoy homophobic-”
you.” There’s a lengthy pause. Dean just stares at Sam, saying nothing. Sam isn’t about to give up on this. Not this time. Dean uncrosses his arms, leaning forward in his chair. Sam sits back down in his own chair, determined. Stubborn. Dean rolls his eyes. Even as a kid, Sam was stubborn as a mule. Always rammed headfirst into trouble because he was just too upset to let things go. Sam points his finger at the table, as if the wooden furniture were to blame for everything. “We’re gonna deal with this.”
“It’s lgbtq pride. Basically like a big holiday to celebrate being a part of the queer community.” Dean can’t wrap his head around just how many people there are in these pictures.
“What? Nowhere. Besides, you should probably catch some Zs anyway.”
Dean’s head feels heavy when he wakes. He feels stinging, and peers down at his knuckles, which have mostly scabbed over. He doesn’t treat them. He doesn’t even leave his room. He just spends the day withering away, regretting everything he’s done since the moment he got Cas back.
“Are you gonna let me heal your nightmares, yet?” Cas asks.
“Yeah.” He takes another sip of lukewarm coffee, before dumping it in the sink and heading to his room to get dressed.
“I don’t know, Dean. I thought… I thought maybe…” he stops himself. “It doesn’t matter.” He turns to leave, but stops. “I just, I need to know something.” He looks Dean in the eye.
“I had an accident.” He tells him. “It doesn’t hurt anymore, though. It’s healing. Jack nods, as if he understands. He grabs Dean’s other hand, and brings them together, as if he were praying. Jack sandwiches his hands over Dean’s. Dean furrows his brows at him, but before he can ask, he feels a warm sensation pooling in his hand. He looks down, afraid to bleed on the couch, but finds no blood. Instead he sees a faint glowing coming from Jack’s own hands. When it’s done, Dean pulls his hand away, peeling off the band-aid. The cut is gone. He turns his hands over to see his knuckles completely healed. He looks quizzically at Jack, who beams with pride.
. That’s the emotion he feels imagining how John would talk to Charlie… or Claire. Dean stares at the question on his screen, frustrated. There are many things about John that Dean would have worshipped him for. But this? Bullshit. Why the hell should Dean think of an answer that would appease John, knowing how he would treat the people closest to him? Dean makes his decision. He presses “A.” It’s the truth, after all. What’s his dad going to do? Tell an angel to smite him? The next question loads on the screen.
“Well you know what? I’m going to bed. Because it’s just a stupid nightmare and I can sleep it off. But if you want to burn the midnight oil playing your stupid frickin games, be my guest.”
“Push me!” Jack says, trying to squirm his way into the chair.
“It’s bedtime!” Dean says. Jack leaps up from his chair, not even finishing his tea… which Dean forgot was caffeinated. Still, Jack darts to his room and scrambles into his bed.
“It’s not completely dark.” Cas nods toward the window, which has a small slit of moonlight spilling onto his pages.
” He can still feel the death grip John had on his arm, dragging him back into the apartment. Dean smelled the burnt dinner right away. But John was so angry… Dean had burned dinners before. This was different. John spent the next few hours berating him until Dean was almost too tired to retain any of it. Dean managed to convince John to take it outside so he wouldn’t wake Sam. Dean remembers what John told him.
” Dean doesn’t click the link. Instead, he just tries to process what he just read. Dean knew that some people existed that liked both, but he never assumed that there were nearly enough for them to get a whole category on their own. He continues reading the other fine print.
“... ya know, Cas, if you wanted to go back- to heaven, I mean, we wouldn’t blame you. Sam and I can take care of Jack, and you can visit for the big things… birthdays and stuff. And-”
“You’re a great salesman.” He teases. “I know, Dean. but- it’s like something I told Jack a while ago, humans burn bright, but only for a brief amount of time, compared to things like us.” Cas laughs at himself, as he remembers that conversation. “You know, Jack was upset about that, but I think he had a point. I see that now. Then, I just told him that we were supposed to let humans, even the ones we love, die, and move on without them.” Cas returns his gaze to the world in front of him. “But after everything, I don’t think I even could, Dean. I don’t want to be an infinite being that only experiences-” He stops himself. “I don’t want to be here after you’re gone. I don’t want to do the same thing I’ve been doing since the dawn of time. I want to live. I want to have a life on earth. Almost- almost like a human life.” He pauses. “You know, ever since I first disobeyed, I’ve been haunted with this idea, maybe it’s possible I was never cut out for carrying out heaven’s duties. Maybe I was never any good at being an angel. Maybe I’ve always been so drawn to earth, to people, because I was supposed to be…” When Cas doesn’t finish, Dean finishes for him.
“Very.” Cas answers, trying to compose himself. “How do you stand it?” Dean lets out a light chuckle.
“Don’t worry, here let me help.” Dean leans over, taking a bite out of Jack’s ice cream. Jack squeals and starts laughing.
“Even if it’s bull?” Dean asks.
“That’s all you need to know for now.” Amara chimed in. “You should leave now.” Dean nodded, heading back to the Impala so he wouldn’t do something he’d regret. He sat in the front seat, while Jack sat in Sam’s lap in shotgun.
First thing’s first… research. Dean already feels like his head will explode from the “research” he just did, but what better things does he have to do? He forces himself out of bed.
“Shhhh!” Dean exclaims, unable to hold back his own laugh, either. When the laughter dies down, Dean sighs. He stares at the coffee table, kind of zoned out, realizing what he’s just agreed to.
“You’re not a terrible friend.” Cas tells him.
“Thank you, for everything. I love you guys.” Sam and Dean, now able to stand, approached Jack.
“I know it doesn’t look like normal pizza, but you never know how it tastes until you try!” Jack nods his head, crossing his arms.
“But what if I’m not? What if I really am norm- straight?” He catches himself.
“You think it’s your responsibility to fix the world, but it’s not. You think you’re good for nothing else, but that’s not true, Dean. You only think it’s true because that’s what Dad made you think.”
responsibility. I mean, really, he’s more your kid out of all of us, but, yeah Cas, I’m helping whether you like it or not!” Cas feels a smile creep across his face, which turns into a laugh.
“To stop listening to that voice in your head that tells you you can’t be happy. That you don’t deserve to be happy. Because we both know that’s not the truth. That voice? It’s Dad. It’s him, telling you that you fail at everything, and you’re only good for breaking things. It’s a lie, all of it. Just stop giving into it. That’s all I want, that’s all Cas wants, that’s all any of us want. Once you do that, maybe, just maybe, you’ll let it all go. Then you can actually start to
solemnity.
Dean’s grip tightens on his shovel, the next words landing almost as hard as they did when he first heard them.
“Jack and I were thinking of planting milkweed in the garden.” Cas suggests.
“Okay.” It’s silent for a while, but not an awkward silence. More of a coexisting-in-a-peaceful-quiet type of silence. A silence that is only broken by the occasional tap from Dean setting his bottle back on the wooden table after taking a swig. Soon the silence is broken by the ambient drizzle of april showers that have started outside the kitchen window. They stay like this for nearly an hour. Thinking silently to themselves, sharing the same space. Alone, but together. The rumbling thunder outside is not loud enough to catch either of their attention. Cas waits patiently for Dean to share anything he feels like he should. Dean sits, thinking. Letting his thoughts drift down the endless bunny trails that call to his attention. Finally, Dean allows himself to open up to Cas, at least a little bit. Cas only asks these questions out of concern, anyway. And after everything he and Cas have been through, Cas is owed a little bit of truth. Cas constantly puts himself on the line for Dean, and everytime he reaches out, Dean pushes him away. Every time. That can’t be fair. A little transparency isn’t too much to ask. And Dean knows Cas would always be willing to give more for him.
“You have an interview?” She nods.
“Dean?” It’s Cas.
The tortured screams of Dean Winchester ring through Cas’s head, startling him awake again.
“Cas, I…” he runs his hand through his hair again. “I dunno. Maybe.” Cas furrows his brow.
“Dee, can you s...sing Blackbird?” Jack asks. Cas stares at him, expectantly.
“Dude, anytime. That’s what family is for.” She shuts the door behind her.
He scooops more dirt.
“This is pointless.” He says, voice lowered.
Dean rubs his face, knowing it won’t do much for the brainworms swirling around in his head. He needs a beer. And a burger.
“Fine. Don’t hog it all. And if you make another peep, I’ll kill you.” Cas slinks under the blanket in complete silence, heeding Dean’s warning.
“Is… something wrong?” Cas asks him.
“Mmhmm. I promise.” Dean smiles.
“Well, that’s the thing. No, I don’t. I mean, it’s hard. Knowing what we know, what’s really out there. And knowing how to take care of it. Helping people. But I don’t know, now, with Billie and Amara’s plans for Jack, I guess that’s still helping people. ‘Saving humanity’ according to them. And if I screw up their plan, because I’m restless, I might rob Jack of the chance to fix things. To make it right, after Chuck. But it doesn’t feel like enough. I don’t want to stop hunting. But I don’t want to hunt. And I don’t want Jack to get hurt.” Cas sits a moment, after listening to Dean’s answer. He leans forward slightly, as if to stress the importance of his next words.
“I suppose. Here, let me show you.” Cas proposes, “What emotion are you feeling right now?” Dean looks slightly taken aback by the question, but answers it.
“Yeah. Holy smokes.” His eyes land on the carpet at his feet.
. And he adores you!” Dean pauses to let Cas take it all in, “And maybe that won’t be enough, sometimes, but that’s okay. Because if that much is true, everything else will fall into place. Some people… no matter how much they love you, they just can’t… make it work. But you’re not like that, okay, I can
“And when he does, we’ll have everything prepared for him. Amara and I have agreed to make all the necessary changes together while Jack grows up, so that by the time it’s his turn to take over, he won’t have to change a thing. In fact, think of it like closing a chapter of a book, the book being the story of Chuck.” Billie proposed, “That way, Jack won’t have to insert himself into the story. He can be the God he was always meant to be, and save humanity like he always hoped, without making the same perilous errors as Chuck. Amara and I are already in the story, but Jack doesn’t have to be.” Now, Dean could’ve only thought to ask one thing.
“I think so.”
For the first time since the hospital, Dean doesn’t wake to a nightmare. He turns to blame Cas, but finds that he’s gone.
. “You might get cut.” Dean stands.
“That or you’d drown it in ketchup.” Sam mutters from across the table.
“Okay goodnight.” Jack makes a point of squeezing his eyes shut. Dean snickers.
“Yeah, I… I think so.”
“Seven mississippi, eight miss-” then they hear it, a deep, yet quiet “
“I’m cold.” He answers, taking a seat at the end of the table, across from Dean. He groans. “And.. I feel heavy. My head… is spinning.” Cas says, dropping his head in his hands. Sam laughs from the kitchen.
“They’re back, aren’t they?”
is she brought Jack into it.” Dean returns. “Like she had the right. People are such assholes.” Dean mutters.
“Sam and Eileen left for a hunt.” Dean explains from the couch. “Vamps in Oklahoma. Should be back in a few days.”
“Yep.” Dean followed Cas down the stairs. Cas approached the toddler, who was now on the ground, petting Miracle. Cas crouched down to his level.
” button.
“Why?! Chuck is gone! We don’t have to hunt things anymore! We don’t have to follow Chuck’s story.
“Yeah. Dean and I are just gonna go get some ice cream, but if you wanna stay here instead, you can. We’ll just eat it all for ourselves.” Dean has to bite back his smile, following Cas, and turning his back to Jack.
“Can I play in the sandbox?” Jack asks. Dean checks his watch, and nods at Cas.
“What?” Dean asks, confused.”
“Assholes?” Cas finishes, brow raised.
“Why are you telling me this?” Dean asked.
“Just shut up, Cas.” Dean mumbles into his pillow, kicking him. Cas shoves his leg back, but not hard enough to send Dean sprawling on the floor. A few minutes pass before he breaks the silence.
