“Hmm. I always liked the name Redbeard.”
“I can’t help it!”
“You’ll find the right one, just give it a few months to heal up before you dip your toes back into the dating-pool.” John just smiled and they headed for the motor-pool. He would take John, and pinged Sally to have her borrow another marked car to drive Judith out to the scene. He fired off a text to Sherlock with all of the details he knew about this latest case and received a swift response that he would meet them on-scene, and asked who was on Forensics. He rolled his eyes.
“I’m fine.” John leant his head back and looked up at Greg, who stood before them with his arms folded across his chest and doing his game best not to smile.
“I don’t want to be your conscience, but human lives are not bargaining chips or game-pieces.”
“This is a rather unusual coat. What is the lining? A fur?”
“Oh, I noticed.” She made a face, “Bit of a prick, isn’t he?”
off to?”
O, pheathraichean, rachamaid sios,
“Well, Richard’s family. But…yeah. My family.” Judith sighed, “Christ.”
Once everything was where it belonged, John signed the log-sheet and turned away from the desk. It was quiet as he left the processing-area and as he stepped out onto the street after passing through an even quieter but not quite empty central reception, he looked around for any late-going taxis. He had no idea how he would get home, his watch read just past 10.00. Doing some quick math, he realized that he hadn’t been in Holding even two hours.
“Work?” Sherlock finished rinsing off, noticing that he would now smell like John’s body wash. Something cheap and neutral but so very familiar.
. I know ’ow people think.” The cabbie rolled his eyes, “I know ’ow people think I think. I can see it all, like a map in my ’ead.” Sherlock turned his head away, exasperated and fighting down a wave of something very much like panic.
“You were making an awful lot of noise upstairs.”
Good Lord, show me the way!
“No, I’m afraid I haven’t.”
“Jesus, Watson.” Greg rolled his eyes and peeked around John to Sherlock, who still sat on the wet sand, “What about
“It may take one more victim to catch him, but his reign ends here shortly.” Mycroft was dead serious. Judith sipped her tea and knew she would keep her eye out for the cab over the next few days.
As the claxon sounded for Sanctorum, Stephen Strange was not expecting the doors to open on Judith Watson, of all people. She had come straight from London, by the looks of it, she wore a rumpled, stained Met uniform. It took him moments to deduce that the blood on her uniform and hands was fresh and not her own. Her eyes were dark and haunted, as if she had seen something unspeakable.
“I’m not stupid, Sherlock.” John’s voice was equally soft as he produced from his pockets an unopened pack of Lucky Strikes and a lighter. He ripped the cellophane off with his teeth and flicked the lid up with his thumb as Sherlock quietly took the wrapping from him and stuffed it into a pocket.
“Plenty of people will miss me. Though, I couldn’t say the same for you.” Sherlock gave him a once-over. “Who are you, anyway? One of my brother’s stupid lackeys, no doubt. I
“He was my best friend. Saved m’life, that one, didn’t know he’d done it, neither. Never said it, didn’t want to.”
“Yeah, I know, I got fat.” Stamford beamed at him. “Take a seat, Watson.”
“Someone’s keeping the River Police
What felt like hours later, she was yanked back to consciousness by raised voices. Her hearing was fuzzy and her head was swimming, and something was making her nauseous. Moving hurt, her limbs felt heavy. If she’d been more aware, she would have pulled into the Astral Plane to get a look. Lifting her head, she tried to get an idea of where she was. The room was tiny, cramped, and dark. The air smelled heavily of chlorine and pool chemicals. Ah. She was in a pool deck, then. Desperate for some mobility, she shifted into the Astral Plane and heaved a sigh of relief as she was able to move around freely. Her physical form slumped against a cinder-block wall. She was tied up in a supply-closet full of equipment and containers of industrial-strength treatment-chemicals. They had used her own handcuffs on her, tied her hands behind her back, gagged her with duct-tape, and she wore a green parka with a fur-trimmed hood, which was weird. That wasn’t her coat? What had they
“You know, I’m rubbish at emotions and such things.”
“Well, if you don’t mind, Captain, I’d really very much like to kiss you.” Now they were almost touching noses and John wasn’t sure when Sherlock had decided to lay on top of him, but he didn’t mind. “In fact, I’d love to kiss you.”
“But they never found the man who broke into the house.”
“Well, boys, if you can behave yourselves, I’m off to bed!” Mrs Hudson said cheerfully, “Already taken my soothers, and I’ll have earplugs in, so don’t worry about me!”
“Not telling.”
“Oh, you’ll be damned useful!” He heaved a sigh of relief, “You still looking for work?”
“I have to be, sir, or I wouldn't have made it this far in my life.” She cleared her throat, “Where are we going?”
“The Windsor Castle?”
“Whole Network. Smart people, they are, good to those on hard times and down on their luck.”
Kitty.”
“Starving. What’s on?”
you. Enjoying a little game. I was supposed to be playing to Mr. Holmes, but you seemed to be a bit more fun.”
“We’ll leave you to it, and be in touch.” John got up and they shook hands with the couple. At the door, Pongo came for a final pat and he ruffled the dog’s ears.
nice.” He smirked as he came around the bed, “You don’t get sea-sick do you?”
“Oi!”
The former soldier was nothing if not clever and crafty and resourceful. He had withdrawn a hefty sum from his bank account, nearly wiping it out in fact, which had given him the cash he needed to go off-grid completely. Cameras were useless, as he proved rather adept at hiding in blind-spots and blending with the crowds of London when he couldn’t.
“Go away, Mycroft, we don’t want to talk to you.” Sherlock growled, “We’ve had a long night and we’re hungry. Now, go away.”
“He usually does, if I call him.”
“Yes, I do.” Greg stepped past him, clearly brushing him aside. “Besides, I know you don’t mind Sherlock nearly as much as you used to.”
“You wouldn’t outgrow these alterations even if you gained an extra five pounds past what you weighed in 2011.”
to go after some nobody?”
“Of course it will matter, you caught his game before anyone else did.” Mycroft looked at her, “It was a brave thing you did tonight, Judith. We taught you well, didn’t we?”
“Your name sounds a bit familiar, like I’ve heard it before, seen you somewhere.” He studied the other man. “What did you do before your accident?”
“Back when he was a teenager.” Richard nodded, “I waited that long because I didn’t want to anger Beverley. See, she was so convinced that John was mine, but...well, how could he be? Doesn’t look a damn thing like me or any of his siblings.”
O mothers, let's go down

“So, where did you learn to speak Arabic, then?”

“I’ll say. I
“Mostly?” He winced.
“I’m forty-five years old, Sherlock, I should
?” He looked sideways at Sherlock, “Maybe. But for all anyone in London knows, I’m either dead or off the grid. And no one who knows would have talked.”
“Oh, thanks for that!” He smacked Sherlock on the shoulder, “Brat!”
While he was busy grooming John, the rest of Lestrade’s team arrived, bringing with them the coroners’ van and an ambulance. Sherlock watched things unfold from his perch on John’s back, while John lay curled up by the front door of Baker Street, and when he was aware of someone picking him up, he almost bit them before he realized it was just his brother.
“RAMC, attached to the Marines for a while, and the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers for the rest.”
“Quick, sir?”
“Well, you are.”
“We will, Mrs Hudson. Thank you for everything.” He smiled and took Sherlock’s hand, heading for the waiting car that would take them...wherever they were going until further notice. His brother’s driver held the door for them and closed it once they were in. Sherlock knew better than to ask where they were going, he would find out soon enough.
“Oh, god, I
“Bit of trouble too, I bet.” A great deal more than a “bit of trouble”, to be completely honest.
“Yeah. Where’d you go?”
“Yeah, I can do that. Where are you off to?”
“Ooh. That’s rough.” Lestrade made a face, “Bless you.”
“All three of you?” Both eyebrows went up, “The boys run?”
“Yes, I was.”
“Hold any cases, Mrs Hudson. Unless it’s Lestrade.”
After that one inspection, Judith renewed contact with the Holmes brothers. She didn’t see much of them through the next three years, except on rare visits home during Holiday leave or the occasional inspection. But she kept up communication by letters, phone calls and emails.
“If I tell you everything? Yes.”
“London, actually.” She grinned at the pretty doctor, “My brother lives on Baker Street, I live behind the Kensington Police Station.”
“Thanks.”
“Didn’t think we had, 008. Good luck in the outside, do stay out of trouble?”
thought it was strange that Judith was out of uniform, no one said a thing about it.
“None of you should have liked that, that
“Frances Almond, age six, youngest of six children, lived with her grandparents part-time.” She cleared her throat and looked over her shoulder at her brother, “John, it’s Frisk!”
“At least I didn’t shout down at her this time?”
“Oh. Handsome family.” Greg picked up the picture, “And that, I assume, is your ex-wife?” The picture had been torn off and the adult woman was barely in the frame.
“Shit. I found her alright.” Judith groaned, “Damn it!” She clicked her radio and called for Homicide before setting up the first stages of the crime-scene. She crossed her fingers she would get Greg Lestrade tonight, she needed a friendly face. Hell, at this rate she’d even put up with Philip Anderson, if she got five minutes with Greg and Sally.
“Yes, ma’am. Good memory.”
“Can I still have a kiss before we go?”
“Sorry, old chap.” He muttered before he cleared the area.
“John!” Sherlock finally gave up trying to be proper and rushed to John’s side, throwing his arms around his mate as John slipped to his knees and folded. “John, breathe, please. I’m here, John, I’m with you.” One hand reached for him, closed tight around his, the other…John had reached for his mother and found purchase on the material of her hi-vis Anorak. She had come from the same scene they had just left, the stench of dead bodies was still on her clothes. Alexandra shifted, but did not pull away from them. Instead of abandoning them, she knelt and put her arms around her son, and Sherlock as well. He remained still, unwilling to correct her.
“Well, I’ll be off then. I’ll keep you in the loop about Hope, yeah?”
at all. It was Roben. Smart fucking cloak if it didn’t like Roben.
“I wouldn’t blame you at all if you did, though.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, “I never ever meant to hurt you like that, I just didn’t ... I didn’t think you would understand.”
“Your family?”
“Stop, right this instant, stop it. Stop it.” Sherlock said roughly, fingers tightening on his wrists. “I know what you’re thinking, and you will stop that nonsense.”
“I don’t know why I’m telling you any of this, it’s none of your business.” He said thickly.
Mycroft letting her live was a bad idea, no matter how “harmless” she was, how inhibited she was. How secure her cell was.” It was clear there was no love lost between Lestrade and his late sister-in-law, but it was also clear that he had no idea that Eurus Holmes was dead and had been since just shortly after the East Wind Incident. John finished his beer and set the empty glass down carefully.
“Thought I heard you were somewhere getting shot at?”
“A name, Mr Hope, if you please.” Sherlock set his pill back in the vial and screwed the cap on tightly. “You underestimated my friends and my resources. Don’t do anything foolish.” He reached across the table to seize the cabbie by the hand to keep him from trying to ingest his pill.
“Nice work, Doctor Watson.”
“No, I let it ring to voicemail.” Sherlock handed John his phone and let him dial into his voicemail to see what Greg had to say.
“You can’t stop me,
“So sorry about that, love, looks like you’ve already got your hands full today.” Meaning the rows of gurneys along the walls. “By the way, where’s Sherlock?”
“Can I?”
“Ah, so good to see you tonight, Mr Holmes! Are you going to have company?” Hakim Masoun came to his table after the set was complete and the girls had disappeared to take a short break between performances.
“Yes he is, poor woman. But she’s as much an idiot as he is, so I don’t feel too bad. They’re kind of perfect for each other.”
“Is Q working tonight?”
“Dismal day, ain’t it?”
?” John raised his head, intrigued by talk of the future. “You get bored without something to keep you occupied.”
“Well, come on, you two.” Greg had clearly made his mind up about something and headed down the narrow ladder-steps.
“This way! Track him!” She led the charge into the forest, and they chased down the perpetrator. Judith did something a bit risky and used a spell to bring down the runner. It was Doctor Frankland, of all people, who had a perfect excuse for why he’d done all those terrible things to Henry

“Care to run The Mall?”
“I’m fairly certain he doesn’t do it
“Uh, no, I don’t think I ever did.”
“Well, I already told your friend, Mr. ‘olmes. I’ve got family to look after.”
“Another victim?”
“Oh, of course!” She just stood at the bottom of the stairs, beaming but sad, as John hauled Sherlock to his feet and they made their way very slowly up the stairs. “I suppose I’m not to tell anyone about this?”
“Serial-killer?” He made a face, “What gave it away?”
“Only if I gain back all of the weight I lost in the past three years.” He sighed and dragged the jumper over his head. It was a little loose on his frame, but not awfully. Sherlock looked him up and down and came over, sliding two fingers under the waistband of his trousers with a nonchalance that would have annoyed John any other time. He hummed and gave a quick tug.
'S có gheibh an trusgan 's crùn nan seud?
“I’m so sorry, John.” Sherlock did a risky thing and hugged John. It seemed the proper thing to do, and it was not a gesture rebuked. John shook and his head dropped to Sherlock’s shoulder. But that wasn’t enough. Adjusting his angle, Sherlock got John settled with his head against his chest and one hand on the back of his mate’s neck and the other arm wrapped around his shoulders. Lestrade stood guard for them, a couple of nearby personnel crept closer but still kept a respectful distance. There was some whispering, concerned looks, and he saw one of the constables take off at a run.
you?! And know if you hurt Judith Watson, your head is mine!” Greg snarled, held at bay only by his discipline, years of training in hostage situations, and John’s hand on his shoulder. John, who could make a perfect kill-shot at a hundred yards without a thought for it, who held his service-weapon in one hand while restraining Greg with the other.
“Two weeks in the water, I’d look for any missing person reports filed under a victim with shoulder-length red hair and grey eyes.”
“How did ... ”
“Wait. Sherlock’s an
When Judith Watson disappeared with a few of the dancers, Greg Lestrade knew something was up. She’d said that this wasn’t her first visit to Maroush, and he believed her, but the way she was comfortable with the dancers spoke of some different familiarity. He liked Watson, he really did, more than he probably should He knew if Sherlock ever found out just how much, he would never hear the end of it. It wasn’t like today was the first time they’d met, anyway, so he was allowed a bit of fancy. He wondered if Judith remembered, he certainly did. It had been years ago, they had both been a bit younger then than now, but he had made himself a promise to remember the feisty medic he had met on a deployment to Canada, and again in Afghanistan. Judith Watson had saved his life in Afghanistan three years ago, he wondered if she remembered that. He had been Army Reserves for most of his career with The Met, at the mercy of the needs of the military, and had left for a two-year stint in the Middle East. That had been their second deployment together, and his last.
“What?”
“Yes, sir.” Judith smiled and squirmed a bit to make more room, “Oi, Baxter, budge over, mate!” Obediently, Gerald’s eldest son, who was three years older than Judith, squeezed over to make a space. Malembe’s wife Sarah brought out tea and biscuits, which Judith and Donovan were happy to accept. Sarah peered at Donovan, and put a hand on one hip, eyes narrow as she looked the detective sergeant over.
“John, don’t. Please. Not here.”
“What about it?”
“Doctor Watson?” Hutchison spoke up carefully, unwilling to interrupt a private moment.
“In my defence, I returned as much of my equipment intact as I reasonably could be expected to. And I always returned my weapons intact.”
She was only half-joking.
He was debating a proper response when his radio squawked at the same time his desk-phone rang. John picked up the radio and adjusted the volume as he picked up the phone.
“Oh, but you are! Sorry, Colonel!”
They ended up digging a safe from the wreckage, inside which they found a pink mobile-phone that was reminiscent of the phone from The Study in Pink. This led to a chain of clues and victims strung along the city by a clever anonymous bomber, who was playing a deadly game with Sherlock. Judith remembered her encounter with Moran and Moriarty. Oh Jesus, this was the game he’d warned her about!
“Lestrade.”
She scrambled to her feet and reached for her Browning. It was instinct, long-ingrained instinct that countered an impression that any weapon she possessed would be of little use against what was on the other side of that door.
be, but not usually.” He snorted, “Lord you missed a show-down at Baskerville.”
.” He made a soft noise of distress and clenched his teeth. The young constable gave him a measured, sad look and John cleared his throat abruptly. That wasn’t pity, but John wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know what it was. He hated people feeling sorry for him, it always made him feel worthless.
you liked the dogs!” He snickered, “Pretty sure Judith could do anything she wanted in there and they’d let her. I’m not exactly sure what she said to Barrymore, but she scared the subs into straight order.”
“Thought she wasn’t a housekeeper.” John murmured once she was out of earshot.
warm where we’re going, possibly an island somewhere.”
“My birthday isn’t until Thursday, Mycroft.” He frowned, he was fairly sure his birthday was in three days, that he hadn’t misjudged the calendar
“I think she’s going to kill the puppies!”
Sherlock held John while he relived memories that provoked as much joy as they did pain. This shouldn’t be happening in public, he knew that. This was a very private matter. And everyone watching it happen knew that. Lestrade came up alongside and put a hand on John’s back, lower than Sherlock’s, and let his Lycan mate know he wasn’t alone.
“You think you can stop me?”
“Right. Be right back.”
“Well…” Judith looked at Mycroft. “She might care a bit more than a little.”
“How do you know?
“Yes. I suppose I was, once.” A grimace of a pain far beyond the physical passed across John’s face, and he struggled to stand. Sherlock quickly offered him a hand up, it was the least he could do.
As he entered the gents, he heard soft sobbing, which stifled as soon as he walked in. He paced along the stalls to the one locked and tapped on the door.
“So am I.”
As soon as her superior officer’s back was turned, Judith turned and headed for her office. She needed to put space between them. She would talk to them, gladly, but…God damn it! Judith heard the two of them talking in quiet voices behind her and resisted the urge to run and never stop until her legs gave out.
“What would you like of me?”
“Because we don’t have probable cause.”
“Doubt it. He doesn’t dictate my schedule

tan. But no sooner had they gotten home than Mycroft was calling on them to dispatch to Baskerville Research Facility, a top-level Ministry of Defense base located in Dartmoor just a few miles outside of Grimpen Village.
“I tagged the cab with a tracking-device when I found it in Brixton. The scans tell me where it is in London, anywhere in London.” She glanced at the screen, then at the cab trailing, “That’s him. Don’t say anything to the boys, I don’t want him to get suspicious.”
“Well, that’s normal, sweetheart.” He studied the worn-out young man. “But you don’t like that, do you?”
“Well, I found Kitty, and Sherlock clearly isn’t out.” John said quietly, “He’s not in the kitchen, so ... ” A quick check found the bedroom empty, and he rolled his eyes. Shaking his head, John looked around.
“No, I know, but you don’t understand. Only one of them was supposed to die! Something went wrong and Sherlock died.” She looked back at the door to London Sanctum, “
“Oh, how can I say no to that face?” Watson chuckled, causing his eyes and mouth to crinkle in a soft, adorable way, and carefully set aside his own clothes. With his back to Sherlock, he stripped to the waist and Sherlock caught sight of a particular scar on his shoulder. It was small, but obvious against the muscled, tanned expanse of Watson’s back. It was an entry wound. Watson had been shot.
“You are
“I am not. Stop squirming or so help me I will break your arm.” He grunted. It wasn’t long before they were surrounded, and John was happy to let the locals have the bastard. They looked at the handcuffs and at each other before turning to John, eyes wide.
you do this?”
“You burned quite a few calories earlier, you need to refuel.” He said as he set into his own breakfast, glancing over the papers. Sherlock grumbled but obeyed, John did not miss how he ate every single thing on his plate. So much for being not hungry. He smiled but said nothing.
“He keeps
“Of course! Just a little something sweet to keep you two going strong! Have a lovely day, you two!” Mrs. Hudson went back into the house with a jaunty wave.
“You girls take a sit-down for a bit.” Malembe Awara said sternly, “And not a word about it, hear?”
“Of course.” Jim moved away across the roof. Sherlock took several shallow anxious breaths, then he stopped breathing for a moment as his brain kicked into gear again. He lifted his gaze and his expression became more thoughtful. After a bit, something occurred to him and he started to laugh.
“That’s going to require dessert.” He grinned, “I would say a bottle of wine, but I think I’ve done enough drinking for a while.”

“Hmm. Time’s quarter after seven. We have a nineteen-hour flight to San Juan.” He frowned thoughtfully, drumming his fingers against her collar-bone, “The jet’s on stand-by, all we really have to do is show up.”
“And I still say you’re an idiot. But you’re a useful, brilliant idiot.” Greg shook his head, “Valuable. Reckless. Caring. Stubborn. Sassy.” Judith swatted at him, giggling. He hadn’t stopped touching, working his fingers in a slow massage to calm the twitching, aching muscles.
“Don’t be, it was very clear you were uncomfortable with being called out for past behaviour. Not that I blame you.” He made a dismissive gesture with one hand, “People are idiots anyway. Well, most of them are idiots.”
“Stop that.” Sherlock growled, looking up from his place between John’s legs, “Right this minute, you stop that.”
“I don’t know if you understand exactly what my son has done for you, Sherlock, in an act of complete selflessness that is completely within his character to look after others before himself and defend those incapable of doing so for themselves.” Alexandra’s eyes darkened and he saw the now-familiar ripple around her that expressed a visual cue of displeasure or sadness. Her voice had hardened, but her displeasure was not with either of them.
“Far too good for any of us.” Stephen sighed and kicked at the fire-place surround.
“Mm.” John looked for somewhere to sit and moved a stack of files from the faded red armchair. Putting his book down to hold his place, he looked for the kitchen.
They got past John, who watched in dismay as they advanced carefully on the open door of the flat. Inside, they found Sherlock shrugging into his coat.

fault, you bastard.” He muttered, face burning. “Completely your fault!”
“There’s a good pill and a bad pill. You take the good pill, you live; take the bad pill, you die.”
The creature turned from Moriarty, who lay still on the pavement, and Sherlock got a good look at its face. The muzzle was stained red with blood, which dripped from its jaws, and it’s eyes…dear god, he’d never seen eyes like that in any manner of hound, Fey or otherwise. They were bright blue and seemed without end, as if he could fall into them and never reach the bottom. Sherlock was reminded of ice, for some reason. The massive creature took out the goons holding Sherlock with two swipes of massive paws, one blow spun Sherlock off his feet and he tumbled. Rolling, he felt a sharp pain in his back a split second before his world narrowed, went dark, and then reoriented itself. It took a moment for him to recover and at first, he thought he’d gone blind, but he hadn’t. He was stuck under his own coat. He had Phased, likely out of panic, and gotten trapped. Tapping into his magic, he let go of the Glamour and felt himself growing. It hurt, it always did, but it wasn’t crippling. In no time, his coat slipped off and he found himself standing on all fours beneath the chest and belly of an enormous Cù-Sìth. But it wasn’t purebred. It was…Hybrid? He glanced up, a little intimidated by the sheer bulk of the massive hound. It lowered its head and he touched noses. That magic felt familiar and he blinked.

“How the hell did you do that?!”
“Any reason why not?”
“Got a list of suspects, but I’ll tackle that tomorrow.” His expression was familiar, “It’s been about two days since I had a break, so I called it quits for now.”

“If I promise, will that satisfy you?”
“Where are you off to at this hour, Doctor Watson?” His landlady poked her head out curiously.
“Yep. Kind of kidnapped John and me one summer, spent four weeks down here, it was amazing!” She bounced in her seat a bit, “We explored Virgin Gorda, the lower bit of it, but we visited this resort a couple of times. I’m fairly certain it’s changed, and help me if anyone here remembers! I only came that once!”
“You alright, Doc?”
cold day in Hell before I let Al Qaida get away with anything untoward.”
“What happened to your mother? It’s unusual for a Royal to leave like that.”
“Shoot the bastard, Sherlock!” Greg hissed behind him, “Or I will!” Jim disappeared from view and the door closed again with a loud bang.
Judith groaned, rubbing her forehead,
“Oh my god.”
“You’re not a real people-person, are you?”
When he got to Tesco, he parked, locked the car, and headed into the store. He found what he needed in no time and checked out, thanking the girl behind the register and carrying the two bags of ice back to his car. As he put them in the back seat, a shout got his attention and the back of his neck pricked. What was that? Raising his head a bit, John saw a commotion by the doors. A man ten years younger than he and in far better shape was running away, people were shouting after him.
“And you found them in Nepal. Kamar-Taj seems to be a haven for the lost souls.”
“I’ll pay first round?”
“So disrespectful of everything else, and yet you respect the uniform.”
“I’ll wait until I hear that water go off before I bring up tea, you had better be decent when I do.”
“Hey. I know you walked over here, but let me drive you boys back to Baker Street.”
“Well, that’s easy.” Anderson dropped to his knees and picked up the left hand, inspecting the fourth finger carefully. After a close examination, he looked up at John, shaking his head. “Probably engaged, but I couldn’t say if the ring was lost, removed by force, returned out of spite by the victim, or away for cleaning at the time the victim was killed. The band is so faded and the bloating has taken its toll, too.”
“I’m a Detective Constable with The Metropolitan Police Service. My brother’s a doctor, currently out of work by his own choice.”
“John.”
“Those are my kids. Mark and Kaitlyn.”
“If I knew, wouldn’t I tell you?”
“It was certainly
“Someone’s after
“I suspect, Mrs Hudson, that my mother would be delighted to visit Baker Street again.” John just smiled as he buttoned up his parka, brushing off the left sleeve. “So you may very well get your wish.”
“Jesus, Watson!”
“A case?” John got up and came up alongside him, “What exactly do you do? Did I ever ask?”
She hung up on him first and pocketed her phone while she tried to work out a detour that would get her past the huffy forensics specialist who seemed to have a personal grudge against her. More people in The Met

“Name?”
“I guess?” He blinked, scrubbing at his eyes with one hand, “What are you doing down here?”
“You didn’t have to.” She sat in the open door, watching him, “What’s your deal, then? Hmm?”
“I wouldn't offer you one if I didn’t intend to share. Most people turn me down.”
about me, you know I was more trouble than I was worth on a
“Can’t say the same for the Winter Court, can you, Sherlock?”
“What did…he say?” Sherlock caught himself. He’d almost said “What did I say?”, and that would have been A Bit Not Good.
“Of course! Good night to you, ma’am!” He saluted and ducked into his cab. She watched until the cab was out of sight, followed it to the corner to make sure, and ran back to the house. Before she made entry, she radioed back to Dispatch.
“I didn’t say you
“Doctor Watson?”
“He’s a friend and a resource if we need anything.” John leant his head back, a familiar posture of exhaustion. Sherlock took his hand and got him off the couch. Without a word, they went back to the bedroom and after making sure the flat was shut down, banking the fire and turning off the music-player, closed and locked the bedroom door. It was normal and familiar to brush his teeth next to John, who pushed him out to do his business before taking one side of the bed.
“Oh, really? Are you serious?” Letting the keys hang in the lock long enough to answer her phone, she swiped into the incoming call and took it on the wireless headphones she wore while running.
“Have you thought of seeking rooms with someone else to reduce your cost of living?”

“Just thinking back on a few things.” He smiled and looked over at his flat-mate, who was a bit more than that, “How long do you think it’ll be before Judith jumps to Sergeant?”
“Then what are you?”
“There is that.” Sherlock chuckled. God bless his John. And woe to Jim Moriarty and his alter-ego Richard Brook, if they were, in fact, the same person and not, say, identical twins. God help them if that was true, and he wouldn’t put it past Moriarty to do something like that.
.” She murmured as she stepped into the build-site, sweeping the beam of her torch into corners of darkness. As a precaution, she silenced her radio.
“So…now what?”
“She’s well, busier than anyone has a right to be.”
After leaving Henry at his house, put down with a heavier than usual dose of a sleep-aid, they returned to The Crossed Keys Inn and went to bed themselves. John had out four doses of the same sleep-aid he’d given to Henry, they each downed two glasses of cold water, took the aid, and fell into a fitful, uneasy sleep. Judith ended up sleeping on the floor of the room she shared with Greg, listening to him toss and turn as nightmares of their experience in Dewer’s Hollow plagued his sleep. By the sound of things, John and Sherlock weren’t doing much better in the room next door. Finally, desperate to get some peace, she climbed up on the bed behind Greg and put an arm around him, her hand resting over his thundering heart.
Taking John’s coat and the case after replacing the pelt, adding the ring-box before he locked it up again, Sherlock went out to the sitting-room where he found John sitting on the couch, a case very similar to his sitting on the coffee table with Sherlock’s coat folded on top of it.
“I wonder why.” An eye-roll, but no malice. “So, who’s Lestrade?”
“Hmm?”
“He should be, why? Did you need him for something?”
“You. Belong. To me. Are we clear on this? I
“And then having to
“What?” Tiredly, Sherlock lifted his head to look at him.
“Not if one of us was out of reach.” John mused, “I was with Intelligence ten years ago, they wouldn’t have been able to get word to me, and I wouldn’t have had any way of knowing after the fact, no one ever brought it up.”
“And the chances of her jumping into a stranger’s bed are a bit slim anyway.” He sighed, “God help us, Greg, Judith’s run off to Nepal and Sherlock is all moody.”
“So, now what?”
“Jesus! You were
“Oh, we did, didn’t we?”
“Well, someone’s got to look after you boys, and you won’t be arsed to do it yourselves! Might as well be me!” She just smiled and patted John on the cheek, “You’re a good boy, John Watson. You look after this one, he’s stubborn.”
“That’s Sherlock Holmes for you.” She chuckled, “You know, that kind of thing throws people off when you do it in front of them, right?”
“Mrs Hudson!” He yelled hoarsely. He got no answer and groaned. “Mrs Hudson! The door!” There was still no response and the knocking continued. If it was Lestrade, he would have let himself in by now. Mrs Hudson was apparently out at the moment, and Sherlock muttered as he shoved off the couch and stumbled down the stairs, shrugging into the parka without thinking about it. It was instinct, really, and he pulled the door open with a bit more force than strictly necessary, completely prepared to tell off whoever had come banging on his door to not-so-kindly fuck off. And froze mid-sentence when he saw the man standing on his doorstep. He blinked a few times, wondering if he was dreaming or not. It was him. It was John Watson. He was here. At Baker Street!
“That’s a
“John!”
“Yeah, sure. Coming.” He got out of the car, taking Mycroft’s offered hand, and looked around to see where they were. One of Mycroft’s regular haunts, way out of his price range and definitely out of his dress-code. He blinked at the façade, the glowing windows that promised hot food, good company, and, when he was in the mood for it, better wine.
his ungrateful poncy arse when the caravan is ambushed by a bunch of opportunistic Al Qaida lackeys and dragging him out of harm’s way before going back for your own guys.”
The stand-off at Camden comes to an end, but the residents of Baker Street aren't in the clear yet. Judith is in serious trouble, but she won't be alone while she recovers. There are plenty of people willing to stay with her as long as necessary. Greg, at the very least, is unwilling to leave her alone for very long.
“Oh, damn.” She muttered, “Doctor Palmer doesn’t stand a
“Enough talk, I’d rather fill our time with more interesting things.”
“Nice work, Casanova.” John murmured, “I think that did the trick.”
“Oh, finally!”

“Then neither do I. Just...try not to get into trouble when I’m not around to help you?”
“Hiding something? Hiding
“Alright, you two, let’s get back to headquarters and get your statements.” Greg looked tired as he waved them to follow.

You can trust us, you know.
“Captain, that is as much my fault as your own. Mine for not making myself more clear, yours for not reading the proper signals.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, reflective, and so. Fucking. Smooth. “Of course, last night was a bit ... exciting, and I can hardly blame you for mistaking attraction for adrenaline. I know you noticed. You saw, but you did not observe.”
“Two?!”
“He’d know, too, wouldn't he?”
“Did he recognise me?”
“Judith!” He caught the gifted young wizard, “What
When Sherlock arrived nearly three hours later, he did not come alone. Not that Mycroft had expected him to. With his brother were John Hughes-Watson, who would probably in the near future shed his “adopted” name, Gregory Lestrade, and Gregory’s assigned sergeant, Sally Donovan. Donovan, by Mycroft’s research, had grown up in the same Council Estate housing as Judith until life took them apart when Judith got into the Army Foundation College three months after her sixteenth birthday and gone on to fifteen years of continuous service with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as a medic. Judith was also a gifted marksman and had done her share of rifle-work as a sniper. Her brother had the same skillsets, despite a shorter service-history, and he hoped that they could find good outlets for their work-related skills. Donovan had finished secondary school and shunned university for a head start in a career in law enforcement, which she was remarkably
“Where are you living these days?”
to her? Her first thought was that Jim was going to be furious about this. Speaking of which, where
“No one does. Do I look like it?”
“I can believe that.” Lestrade sighed.
“You ... ” Sherlock sat cross-legged in front of him as he finished that bit of the story. “John Watson, you are the luckiest men in the world. How the hell did you not know you’d been shot!”
“Didn’t think you would be. Me neither. I’ve seen too much out here to believe in a benevolent god-figure.” Judith sighed and rolled her shoulders. Sherlock smiled and turned her so her back was to him and carefully let her hair down from the damp bun, using a comb to work out any new tangles and getting to work braiding it.
“Okay! Love you, Daddy!” Rosie just smiled at him and kissed him wetly on the cheek. John felt some part of his jaded, scarred heart squeeze a bit. How could she be so good and so pure? It wasn’t
After a while, she started humming a slow, slightly sad certain tune. She knew the song in two languages, in English and in Gaelic, but didn’t sing it often.
“Mycroft did.”
“Focus, John!” Judith hissed as they watched Sherlock plummet from the ledge, “Full focus! Don’t look away!”
“Well, that’s my job, innit?”
John flexed and twisted his wrists, getting his left hand free, and reached up to touch. The noise Sherlock made when he ran his fingers through soft curls was adorable, and he smiled into the kiss. Not as easy as literature made it sound, but not impossible. That, of course, led to a break in the action and John took a deep breath.
“You’re getting stronger, Jude. You’re always careful.” Strange took her hand, a familiar touch she was used to by now.
, Riley, and the coldest corner of Siberia won’t be the worst place I can think of sending the likes of you. Shut. Your. Mouth.” Riley did just that, her teeth closing with an audible clack. Brook whimpered, John and Sherlock just looked at each other, a bit alarmed, and Sally nodded approvingly. The last time the boys had seen this behaviour from Judith, she had been tearing down Richard Barrymore during the Baskerville base.
looking forward to this vacation, aren’t you?”
Judith looked over her shoulder at where she thought Seb might be posted. There was only one thing he could be talking about.
“Absolutely.” He glanced at their suspect, then back at the young man he had just rescued from worse than a few bruises. “I don’t suppose you might have anything as useful as a pair of handcuffs on you, would you?”
“Busy as I am.” She smiled, “You take care of us.”
at and showed promise to climb the rank-ladders to a high position, if she could only make better choices in her private life. He knew Sherlock was good about pushing and prodding Donovan to better herself. As the group sat down, he flagged down a server, who took orders for food and another round of drinks.
Judith was aware of her surroundings, and knew she had picked up a tail at the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone Road. She got as far as York and Baker Street before she was jumped. Her tail hadn’t been expecting her to fight back, and she took down two of them before she was dropped in her tracks with a sharp needle-jab to the back of her neck. She was aware of being picked up and bundled into a nearby van, but that was the
“Stop dying on me, Sherlock. I can’t … ” He covered his face with both hands, gone for propriety and anything resembling control. He hated crying, it made him feel so sick and empty inside.
“Yes, ma’am. Her name is Kitty.”
“Oh, look who it is.” Anderson looked past John, who had already turned around at the sound of a familiar voice. “Hello, Sherlock.”
“I’m not stupid, Mary. I know Rosie’s not my daughter. And I know you tried to kill Sherlock twice.”
“Are they talking about Andrew West’s pen-drive? The missile plans?” Judith arched an eyebrow.
“What do you think of it, John?” Greg asked after a few minutes.
“Couldn’t the same be said about working with
“Sherlock and Moriarty’s deaths go
“Alright, I’ll stop. I like surprises.” She leaned across the bed and gave him a kiss, “I’m sorry, that was mean of me. How are we getting there?”
“Happily, dear.” Sherlock got the cat, apparently named Queenie now, situated and grabbed hold of her duty-belt to pull her out of the squad-car. Once she had her feet under her, she took her notebook back and flipped to the page she’s written the cab’s information on.
She had been thirteen, walking home from school with some friends, when she caught up with a group of boys from her school who were busy beating up on a younger boy who didn’t go to their school. He was from a private school, much better financial security than most of them. Judith, as a rule, avoided fighting with other children, especially boys, but she hadn’t been able to help herself when she’d found the older boys ganged up on Sherlock Holmes. She hadn’t even known his name that day, who he was or who his family was or what kind of money he might come from, but she had never been good about letting bullies get away with their cruelties and put herself in the way to take them on.
“I said come back.” John was watching him carefully. “Jesus, what has Moriarty done to you?”
“So, going by the victim’s stats, this was a vengeful ex of some romantic involvement, not sure if wife or a girlfriend. Someone quite a bit shorter than he was, even with a three-inch heel on her shoes, but not used to wearing the shoes, which threw her off-balance a bit. She might have been inebriated. Right-handed. Blonde or strawberry blonde, wearing…Clair de la Lune, and True Dimensions Firecracker lipstick.” Stripping off the gloves, she bundled them and dropped them in a marked container, “Need anything else, gentlemen?”
He raised his eyes to Sherlock’s, grinned manically, and pulled Sherlock closer while he reached into his waistband. It didn’t occur to him how much trouble he was actually in until Jim shoved the barrel of a pistol into his mouth with his free hand and went to pull the trigger on himself. Shock settled in, followed by panic. Sherlock’s brain had shut down and he reacted on sheer instinct. Grabbing Moriarty by the hand, he pulled hard, fighting for control of the gun. The gun discharged between them, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. Adrenaline guided his body and he used his falling weight against Moriarty. There was a struggle, a release, and a yell. Sherlock didn’t feel anything when he hit the pavement. The broken body of Jim Moriarty broke some of his fall, but he was already dead by the time they landed. That sort of thing happened if you managed to get shot in the heart trying to be a hero.
“No, I don’t really. And I wouldn’t be happy doing anything else.” John smiled and came up alongside him, “I knew you weren’t dead, Sherlock.”
“Yep.”
they are!” Mrs. Hudson smiled, “I’m so sorry I missed your promotion-ceremony, my dear.”
“You must have! Bless you, my child! God bless you!” Lestrade huffed, ruffling his hair, “Christ.”
“Should I call the bomb-squad?”
“Open it.” He watched her eyes. “Tell me what you think?” She turned the box over in her hands, studying it, and the look on her face changed as she opened it and found the ring.
Judith and John split their time between their regular jobs, rebuilding London Sanctum, and spending whatever spare time they had left at Kamar-Taj continuing their education in the mystic arts. She heard from Stephen Strange by emails and phone calls but didn’t see him much. Which was unfortunate, but they were both acceptably busy with their respective careers and lived on completely different continents. And Judith maintained her relationship with Greg. He was her normal in a very bizarre world, and she desperately needed normal.
“Teacher is a word, we’re both students.”
“Told you. Octopus.” John murmured sleepily, “Give him an elbow if he gets too clingy, he’ll back off a bit.”
be busy?”
“Why? Why is
“Still, or sparkling, sir?”
“My pleasure, Inspector.” John got to his feet and brushed off his hands before shaking hands with Lestrade, “And don’t worry about your sergeant, she’s far from the first person to call me a mutt.”
Five minutes later, they were parked along the kerb and heading through the doors of Maroush. Judith pulled off and pocketed her beret as she stepped into the restaurant and leant her head back, taking a deep breath.
“Mycroft was right about you, John. D’you think M misses you?”
“Barred. Had a word with Mrs H, no visitors until we say.” Sherlock tracked him with his eyes as he went to check the door, which had been duly locked.
“That’s more like it.” He smiled.
Judith leaned against her Rover, which had seen a bit of action tonight, and looked at her watch as the car pulled away from Baker Street.
“I’d love to!”
“You okay, John?”
The drive from Westminster to Richmond was quiet, and when they reached the cemetery, they only stopped when they reached a particular section of the cemetery itself after a brief stop at the gates to speak with the groundskeepers.
“This is news to you?”
John Watson finally meets Sherlock Holmes, and it's the beginning of something beautiful. If Sherlock can just behave himself for once.
“Where are we going?” She asked, knowing it was fifty-fifty he would actually tell her anything really useful.
“Does that happen sometimes?”
“Možete nam verovati, znaš.” The blond murmured. Judith was glad their car was empty and the only person in danger was the man sitting between them.
lot like Sherlock’s, but different.
She had pulled her hamstring muscle chasing the suspect, but was damn lucky she hadn’t been shot. He
“Sitting up here with you. Is that a problem?”
not good, yeah.” She bit her lip to keep from laughing. They got to the line, got under it, apologized to Lestrade for being late, explained it away as a traffic-delay, and he sent Judith and John into the scene with Sherlock. They were met at the door of the ground-floor flat by a pissy Philip Anderson and Judith looked over her shoulder at Donovan, who watched, making a face no one else saw, mouthing “Fucking Anderson!” to the sergeant.
“I’m sorry. I was…busy.”
“No, sir.”
“Grand idea.” John grinned and settled down next to Sherlock. They spent a few minutes watching the trio of Yarders below them arguing over the gods knew what business, enjoying the last of their coffee. All of a sudden, Greg threw his hands out and turned his back on Donovan and Anderson.
“Don’t be foolish, Doctor Watson.”
“No.”
“I can’t imagine what would make coming out here pleasant, Mr Holmes! Come on, step into my office, gentlemen, we’ll talk inside!” She beckoned them to follow, knowing instinctively that they would, and didn’t say another word until she’d reached her office in the Medical Treatment Facility.
She was not surprised to get home from dropping the car off at the station just ahead of Greg. She held the door for him and locked it once they were both inside. She checked on the wards she had set around the house and all were in place and solid. Nothing was getting through without her knowing about it first. Queenie came out to greet them, climbing to her favorite perch on Judith’s shoulders.
“Well, I couldn't get to Baker Street, they had the whole bloody road closed until half an hour ago.” Mycroft leaned against his brolly, “What manner of ill-begotten trouble did you get into tonight, dear brother?”
“Mycroft.” John nodded to the man who more or less ran the country. Because, really, what else could someone with the kind of power his brother held actually be
The quiet was only broken by the sound of Greg’s phone going off and John did not miss the air of resignation with which Greg answered the incoming call. Crime never took a day off, and even though he wasn’t on for the next case, they were calling him in. After hanging up with whoever had called him, Greg pocketed his phone and looked at Mycroft.
“You called me, Greg, I usually show up when that happens. Kind of habit, yeah?” John held out one hand, “Help me up, mate.”
“When I’m busy, which is all the time? I’ve gone seventy-two hours without food before.” She shrugged, “But if you think I’m bad, you haven’t seen the way Sherlock eats.”
"Down to the River to Pray" is one of my absolute FAVORITE songs, and I have a lovely version of it in Gaelic on my playlist, both the English version and my beloved Gaelic will feature in different parts of this story. It's such a pretty song. Judith gets to show off a bit more of her dancing skills, too, for a VERY appreciative crowd, which is never a bad thing! ;)
“Your undivided attention?”
After situating the cats, who were either indifferent or displeased with being left behind, Judith, Greg, and the boys left Baker Street. Judith took Greg, the boys took a cab right behind. As they headed back to Brixton, Greg kept looking in the rearview mirror, tracking the cab that stayed a few car-lengths behind. They were obviously going faster, but Sherlock would have told the driver to keep their car in sight as much as possible.
“Not yet, but we will. No more bodies on my watch. You two get on home, alright?”
“Ignore the boys, they mean well. It’s not often I flirt with outsiders, most of my targets wear a uniform.”
John was frantic,
John Watson was no idiot, or a coward, but he had to admit that his sister could be one
?” Sally murmured.
“Just talk. Nothing in particular. Please, sit.” Judith was good at charming anyone she pulled, he was curious to see if she could get Hope to cooperate. Sherlock felt a hand on his arm and knew it was John.
“You don’t think there’s gonna be another killing, do you?”
“Ta.” Watson made his way up the stairs, burdened with the garment bag containing Sherlock’s beloved coat and making use of a cane to get himself upstairs. Sherlock had noticed the other night that he walked with a limp, but it was overlooked or ignored when he was busy and it didn’t really hinder his ability to work. Once they were inside 221B, Sherlock closed the door and turned from setting the locks to find Watson unpacking the Belstaff. He had promised that every care had been taken with cleaning the coat, and Sherlock could feel the benign magic that had gone into the process, the familiar sensation of his own magic ingrained into the very fabric.
“I make no promises.” He examined the item closely before carefully setting it down. “What
“Sorry, John!” Another server whispered as they passed, her tray was full of glasses. “Saw you got Moriarty.”
, and it was quiet on Baker Street again. At least until the next case came up or one of Sherlock’s experiments went sideways again.
“Getting away from my brother’s idiot flat-mate.” She smiled as Christine came up the stairs, “I got them out of trouble and he had a funny way of saying thank you.”
“Don’t be, no one else ever was.” Ford just shrugged. Anything else John wanted to say was put on hold when his phone rang.
“Like that?”
“Yep. But we’re both in the same boat about Mycroft, so I guarantee you he doesn’t know that we know, and he won’t. Greg knew it was a fake as soon as he heard.”
By the time he got back to the resort, it was nearly five. He saw the boats coming in and ran back to the room after thanking Bix, who had driven him down to Spanish Town, and paying him for the trouble even though he said he didn’t need anything.
“Nah.” John shook his head and collected empty plates, “Greg knows I come back here when I need a safe place to stay. Told the boys over there at The Met that if they saw the curtains move, don’t bother until they got called.”
A few people he encountered on his way exchanged greetings with him, but he had the feeling his impending retirement and dismissal was no secret. So few agents lived long enough to retire that when one of them
“A little better at solving crimes at the moment. I’d be down to occasional locums work, maybe a half-time shift at a clinic I can talk into taking me.” Judith shrugged, “I’d kind of rather do something that lets me keep my own hours.”
“Not often. No real call or need for it.
“Who’s what?” She sat up straight, “What’s up, Sal?”
Judith smiled as she tapped out that reply. Up at the scene, her brother looked at his phone then at her, his eyes narrow. She waved her phone at him and put a hand on Sally Donovan’s jacket as she came alongside her. Her phone chimed, but she ignored it for a minute.

to say something, but the complaint didn’t get very far and he settled for a hostile truce. Enough people
Hanging up, she looked at Greg.
“To what?! I don’t know if it’s occurred to you or not, but I don’t exactly have much worth going home to!” She sniffed, “I sure as hell don’t want a thing to do with any of my family, and most of my friends are in the Army. Where am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do?”
“A few hours, max.” He ruffled Sherlock’s hair, he seemed to do a lot of that, and smiled, “You have my number, sweetheart, call for anything.”
“I took my vest off in the ambulance and my nurse saw the blood on my uniform.” He shook his head, thinking of Bill Murray and how shocked the man had been as John explained himself while Bill stripped him to the waist and got busy stemming the bleeding and packing the wound, trying to keep him from bleeding out before they got to base. It had been a close one, and they’d taken him straight to surgery to stop the bleeding and remove any shrapnel in his shoulder. That had been the beginning of the end and the following year had been absolutely fucking miserable. Then Mycroft Holmes had found him, and the rest was happy history.
“What for? I’m the one who died again.”
“Another one?”
“You…
“Just a bit ago. How long have you been in here?”
I can’t keep you safe, Mr. Hope. Men like Moriarty, whoever he is, have people
“It’s okay to grieve. You don’t have to hide it from anybody.”
“Eh.” John shrugged and collected his cane from the sand, brushing off his clothes and hair.
“No!” John snarled, pulling away from him, “It’s not something you get used to! It’s never something you get used to! Never let someone treat you like that!”
“Should it?”
simple. I’ve seen the spells Judith and John can summon, the things they can do.” He ruffled his hair and chuckled. “Wow.”
“Annoyed, actually. Angry was three years ago. Five, maybe. Heartbroken was five. Angry was three or four. Now I’m just bloody exhausted and annoyed.”
to go?”
After a while, he was aware of being watched. Not by anyone wishing him harm, but just a casual, curious gaze. He was one of many people crowding the footpath for Hoot tonight, just another face among hundreds. Sherlock wore nondescript clothes suitable to the venue, a far cry from his usual get-up. Tonight he wore fitted skinny-jeans, a pair of John’s old desert-boots that he had recovered on one of many visits to London, and a red V-neck that was a hair shy of too tight and barely reached his waistband, above which a peek of his underwear was visible. His hair was much shorter than it had been five years ago, and he had lined his eyes. Not obviously like some blokes did, just a hint of it. He didn’t get out very often, not for something like this, so it was exciting and liberating to be out tonight among his own kind. Even if he was feeling rather sorry for himself and probably should have stayed home by himself.
it?!”
“He’s alive.”
“There’s a chance she’s split town, we’ll find out pretty fast.” He let them read the warrants, “If you want to come along, we’re not going to stop you. Pretty sure the family will be there, they called in another tip about DeVil. How did you know it was her?”
He sounded so smug.
“Couple thousand miles from here.” She wondered if she could take Greg to visit Kamar-Taj some day. “You believe in magic?”
“What kind of research?”
“Jesus Christ! John! Where did you

“Oh. Um. Thanks?”
“Well, you
“Almost six milligrams of Ativan. And I definitely feel it.”
“That’s no excuse.” John just smirked.

“Go ahead.” A mark was placed on the list and he ducked the velvet rope. The first thing he did was run upstairs to the first floor, where he stopped by the bar and got drinks. Hennessey for himself, Connemara for John. As soon as he had the drinks, he headed for the balcony where he’d last seen John. From a distance was one thing, up close was…breathtaking. In fact, he stopped dead in his tracks in the doorway and stared. Oh. My god. Sherlock stared for what felt like several minutes, committing every detail of this to memory for the rest of his miserable days. There was something about the way the lights of the club, and the street outside, caught on John’s hair, the lines of his face, reflecting in his eyes like stars in a clear night sky.
“How long will it take to get to Spanish Town and back?” He heard voices and realized that the practical half of the test was about to get under-way. Judith caught sight of him by the water-sports shack and peeled off.
“Oh my goodness! You’re the Baker Street Boys!”
“It’s all right, John.” Sherlock looked at John, who paced the room nervously.
“My brother promised to handle that for me.” Sherlock moved so he was sitting behind John and put his arms around the expatriate prince, not afraid of expressing intimacy in front of Alexandra. He felt John relax and rested his chin on John’s shoulder.
“Oh, stop it, you big baby.” Sherlock returned to tending John’s wounds, “But if I’m coughing up hairballs for the next two weeks after this, I hold you responsible.”
“I’ve got you.” He put one arm around her and called in over his radio for an ambulance and a bomb-disposal team. Both were already en route.
“Okay!” She ran off and Sherlock followed her into the house. John heaved a sigh of relief and looked over at Sherlock’s parents, who looked relieved but saddened.
“Wait a minute here. You’re a CEM too?” CEM (pronounced with a K-sound) was an acronym for “Council Estate Mutt”, which was a derogatory term for the kids who lived in Council Estate housing with their families.
“Although I have loved this – this little game of ours. “He put on his London accent for a moment.
“But you know ... um, what you’re looking at?” Anderson gestured at the body on the muddy beach.
“Do not let my appearance fool you, Mr Holmes, I’ve

“D’you know what happens if you don’t leave me alone, Sherlock, to you?”
“I don’t

“Oh, don’t worry, Gregory, I can be subtle when the situation calls for it.” Mycroft just smiled and waited until they were both safely on the wet sand before he disappeared.
“That’s two
“Good morning, you two. Please come in.”
“Just fine, ma’am.” He peered at her tag, “Uh, Constable Watson? Yes, thank you.”
“Oh, gee, thanks for that.” He snorted and tossed his spent cigarette, stubbing it out with his shoe.
“Everyone’s so stupid – even you.” There was deliberate venom in those words, a baited hook. Sherlock’s gaze sharpened a little as he looked back at the man who had kidnapped him and then made what could potentially be a fatal mistake of bringing him

do that.” She headed off for the other end of Chester Place, Greg tagging along behind. They finished their run with breakfast at Cafe de Fred and showered at home before heading out for work.
“Pity.” Moran snorted and ducked into the car, “Goodnight, Watson!”
“Tell me I returned the coat of a Winter Prince and I won’t believe you.” John folded his arms across his chest.
“I know. But not just
“All of our students are shown the way, if they wish.” The Ancient One smiled as Judith got her feet under her, “But, you might want to brace yourself. The trip can be rather…exciting.”
“But apparently, money to be had for…
“No you won’t.” He calmed down again.
“Yes. Please.” John stepped closer and he carefully removed the last pieces of clothing. The bullet-wound was not his only scar, but it was by far his most prominent. Exploring could happen later, shower now. John steered him under the water and took the time to properly wash Sherlock, going over every inch of him that he could reach, which included
“I’ll tell him it’s Timothy Almond they need to question.” She stepped into the apartment, seeing remnants of a house she had played in as a child. She followed the sound of raised voices into the bathroom where she found Sherlock and Anderson going at each other’s throats.
“Moriarty.” Hope spoke the name a bit hesitantly, “H-his name is…Moriarty.”
“Nothing terribly exciting, maybe a bit too boring for your taste. Just assist on masters’ level coursework and mentor the thesis students who can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.”
“Who are you?”
“After  you, Doctor!” Sherlock grinned and followed John into the shower. The hot water felt absolutely glorious and despite John’s intimation that he had plans for post-shower antics, they took their sweet time. As he washed away the cares and grime of daily life, Sherlock noticed new and different scars on John’s body, scars that had not been there five years ago. Some were quite old and faded white, others were much newer and still healing up.
“Why doesn’t that surprise me?” Greg just looked annoyed. John just patted him on the shoulder.
“I…Mum.” John’s voice was hoarse, broken. “I’ve
fond of you.”
“Careful what you ask for, Lucifer.” Moran cautioned, “He’s a collector.”
“And another one on the way, it looks like.” Greg raised an eyebrow, “Good breeding-stock in the Hughes family, eh?”
“I was in a dark place at the beginning. Spent every dime I had to my name looking for answers.”
“Not his scene, never is.” Sherlock wasn’t even looking at the fence, he was completely focused on the cat.
Jim Moriarty?”
“John!” He choked, “Oh, I missed you!”
“Clever girl.” Bond chuckled, arms folded across his chest, “One step ahead as always, aren’t you?”
“Oh!” Hooper gave a start, he wasn’t quite sure if it was because of the noise of the door or because he spoke up. She turned sharply and when she saw John and Stamford, she kind of deflated.
“Because a charitable benefactor has forced this upon us, you get to babysit the consultants for Lestrade’s division.” Roben snarled. “Keep them
“I am very fine being on it’s white-list.” He chuckled as the cloak wrapped itself around his hand. “Oh, whatever happened to Colonel Moran?”
“Oh, not anymore, I’m not.” She murmured, remembering something she’d gotten done today. For once, it had nothing to do with friends or relatives getting involved. She had done it herself, earned it herself with hours and hours of diligent hard work proving herself worthy. And for once, even James Roben didn’t have anything to bitch about. Puzzled, he pulled back and looked at her, eyes narrow.
“What is it, Hutch?”
“Actually, we did.” Stamford looked a little uncomfortable as she pulled the sheet down and reached for the closures of the body-bag beneath. “See, Doctor Watson is looking for work to do and I thought I had better introduce him to you before sending him anywhere else.”
“You’ve been with the Army for almost thirteen years, having forgone traditional university to enlist, which was due to a number of circumstances, eventually deciding to go to medical school in order to have a serviceable talent after you left the military.” Will flicked ash from the end of his cigarette and looked at her, “Have I forgotten anything?”
“I might have to kill you if I told you exactly what I’ve done since the Army bade me farewell.”
“You’re not going to hurt me?”
“Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? You can choose either one.”
He raised an eyebrow and looked at Sherlock,
He sounded muffled,
“Yes, I am.” She beamed at him, “What about you?”
“Strongest girl I know, but the shade of her mother’s cruelty and the memories of her father’s abuses hang over her shoulders.” Greg folded his hands behind her back and watched Judith interact with her step-siblings, “I’ve got a question for you, Mr. Hughes, if you’ve a moment?”
“What?”
“Moran says Moriarty’s gone.”
“Oh, she’s amazing.”
“Oh?”
And that was the last she heard before the line clicked over. She stood dead still as a woman stepped through the doors, through some kind of barrier. It looked like pure energy. Magic. But…
“Oh, Donovan, if Doctor Watson needs anything, make sure she gets it, will you?” Sherlock ducked under the line and headed into the room. Judith caught sight of a housekeeping cart just up from her, and chewed on her lip. Like hell was she about to ask Donovan for help, but she could slip through before anyone caught her.
them. It was. Shutting down, he unbuckled the helmet and tossed it back onto the seat as he hopped out of the chopper. Sherlock was right behind him as they ran towards the centre of town.
“Asking what?” Stamford just looked at him, eyes wide and innocent.
“You two keep an eye on the git, will you? I don’t need babysitting, just make sure he doesn’t do something stupid.”
“No. I wouldn't be talkin’ to you if I did.”
“Um, can I help you?”
After she was done eating, she binned her trash and went upstairs. He heard the shower run and wondered. It was his day off, but he was still a DI of New Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Major Crimes division. Going upstairs to his bedroom, Greg took a fast shower and got dressed before he placed a call to work.
“You’re not playin’ the numbers, you’re playin’
?” He very carefully took Strange’s hand in both of his, “Christ, man!” A broad network of scars crisscrossed Strange’s hands, he could see where the tendons had seized and caused the fingers to curl. It was painful just to see.
Mhic Dhé, stiùir mi nad cheum.
“Put a muzzle on your mutt, Holmes.” Donovan sneered. Sherlock saw the air around John rippling and realized it was the Glamour. Uh oh.
“What do I tell them?” She kept her eyes closed. “Sherlock is going to read me like an open book, and we
“Ta.”
bad, Sherlock. Really he’s not.”
“Nope, but she’s definitely going to be my only.” He studied a very simple ring, a band of silver engraved with the Claddagh symbol and simple Celtic knotwork. Judith was a very practical woman, and not at
going to kill me, you do know that, yeah?”
“Nothing.” He looked at Stamford and grinned. “Well, shall we interrupt?”
“Do you think you’ll be needing Sherlock?” An eyebrow went up in question as they walked back to the car.
“Huh. Wasn’t expecting someone like you. I thought maybe one of Moriarty’s goons would get it, or some stranger had it and wouldn’t know the first thing about what it was.”
“Oh, I didn’t say
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course he is!”
“Mm. Not me who needs luck, A.” John just grinned at her after stealing a kiss that made her squeal.
“I’ve endured far worse than snapping from you, Judith Watson, and I’ve the scars to prove it.” It wasn’t often he genuinely smiled, but he did now as he got her up and pushed her towards the stairs. Greg was right behind her, naturally, and steered her into the bedroom at the left of the stairs when they got to the third floor.
“Mycroft.”
“Clearly.” John just smiled. Kitty had gone from sitting on Sherlock’s lap to occupying his whole upper body practically. She was stretched from waist to shoulder, curled up a bit, just like she did with John after a long absence. “Well, she clearly likes
“Because I was moving when they hit me, and when I initially felt the impact, I just thought a piece of brass had fallen under my armour and gotten caught*.” He shrugged, feeling the stretch and give of healed scar-tissue. “It wasn’t until I’d managed to call for help and gotten my men to safety that someone else noticed.”
As it got later, she stopped off for a bite to eat and asked for any affordable hostels in the area. She got the name of a few with reasonable rates and set off again to find a place to stay for the night. All of them were full, and none of the secondaries she got were in her price range. It was getting late when she found herself wandering the streets of Mayfair. Judith wasn’t too worried, but she resolved to stop at the next hostel she saw. But Judith never got that far. She saw a flash of lights behind her and looked over her shoulder as an unmarked silver car slid up along the kerb and stopped. She stood on the sidewalk, wondering what on earth had happened, and briefly if Sherlock Holmes had anything to do with it. The window rolled down and she almost laughed as she recognised the driver.
who these gentlemen are.” The change in dynamic was glorious and sudden and perfect. Everyone under the rank of Major immediately stood at attention, the guards took two steps back, and she had her credentials out as Barrymore turned on her like a snake on its prey.
Just before noon, things started happening. Judith was walking a short patrol when she suddenly saw John come tearing out of the hospital in a fit. She had picked up a call over the radio for shots fired on Baker Street, so she had a pretty good idea where he was going.
“Makes sense.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, “Black Widow killer, perhaps?”
“Just seven.”
“Oh, it’ll grow back!” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “And speak for yourself! What’s all of this, then?”
“Come home, John. Please come home.”
“Glad to.” John took the gloves Greg handed him, offering one pair to Sherlock, “Take it the Evil Twins aren’t thrilled about this?”
“It’s such a common name is all. I know approximately twelve other people named William. I’m not fond of the name.”
she’s busy!” Judith chuckled, “She’s a sweet girl.”
“Jesus, that’s a hell of a resume.” He chuckled, “You’re a doctor, then?”
“Just following orders, ma’am.” He grinned weakly as she fished a kit from a pocket, “Remembered what you told me when they shipped me back. “Stay out of trouble and don’t do anything too stupid. Find a foundation that works and build on it.””
“Good. Now do we wait for back-up or do we go in on our own?”
, anyway. So, ever the dutiful if not ever so slightly more desperate, husband, John had agreed. He wasn’t stupid, he knew his marriage was on the rocks. But he felt…trapped. It wasn’t Rosie’s fault, she was an angel, the sweetest little girl. It was what John had gotten himself into and turned his back on when he decided it was a good idea to marry Mary Morstan and stay married to her. He had done it to save himself, and Rosie, because he knew that if he left them, Rosie would suffer. And despite having no blood between them whatsoever, John loved the little girl. He knew for a fact, thanks to a friend of his who worked at Bart’s, that the baby wasn’t his. It was a blessing, a relief, actually.
With that taken care of, and all the proof she needed that the driver of the cab she’d seen down in Soho was the killer, Judith decided to call it a night and go home. Thanking M for letting her use MI6’s rather valuable resources, and bidding the boys goodnight, she returned to her car and drove home to Kensington. She returned the car to the police station, marked the station-log for her time, and walked home to the flat. A light was on, so she guessed Greg was home, and when she got inside, the house was warm.
“What else are we up against?”
you got a warrant?” He demanded of them, “Have you?”
remembered to eat after going without for a while.
like you.”
“He already has.” Judith ruffled her hair, “His name is Jefferson Hope.”
“Impeccable timing, Captain Watson.”
?” He looked up at the bartender, who just gestured over John’s shoulder. He looked back, scouring the small crowd for anyone who might have thought it was a good idea to buy him a drink. There, at a corner table near the door, was a gentleman in a two-piece suit. Nothing fancy, rather simple, it was clearly not new but it was clean if not slightly rumpled with a white button-down and a rather gaudy tie. He had the air of the academic to him. He was rather heavyset with thinning, short brown hair cut high and short, and green eyes partially concealed behind a pair of thick glasses. Someone he knew? He didn’t look familiar right away, but that didn’t mean much. John shrugged and turned back to the bartender, who nodded. John sighed and finished his current drink before picking up the one a potential stranger had bought for him. For a minute, he studied it, but there weren’t any people who would want to do him harm
John made some strangled noise and hated himself when Sherlock’s smile turned into a predatory smirk. Caught like a deer in the headlights. Fuck. He found himself face-to-collar bone with a very naked, very wet Sherlock in the time it took to blink. Everything he was holding hit the ground with a soft thump. The top of his head reached Sherlock’s jaw. A wetness on his cheek startled him out of his head and John refocused.
Sherlock rattled off everything they had on the victim and she folded her hands under her chin as she processed what they knew already. She was quiet and still for so long Sherlock actually dared to poke her in the back of the thigh with his foot while he stood behind her.
“Well, I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but I do know this was a hate crime, probably an intimate one which points to either family or significant other as a suspect.”
“Who said anything about flatmates?”
“Oh, you love me.” A soft, sad chuckle, “I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
“Stop feeling sorry for yourself or so God help me I will beat it into your head that
“We’ll see about that.” John was going to reserve his judgment until he actually got to meet Sherlock Holmes.
He was halfway to the Press Room by the time she caught up. Sally met them there, confused when she saw Judith.
“And police-work seemed a natural next step for you.”
“What?” She fought to sit up, peering out the windscreen of the Rover. Greg pointed wordlessly at the cab that had just pulled up. On her laptop, the indicator showed that Hope’s taxi was in front of them.
“It’s not that, sir, I just don’t think we need him every time we get a case.”
those? Hmm.
“Oh, Inspector?”
He hung up and looked at Hutchison.
you live?”
“Jesus, I’m sorry.” She groaned and rolled over in the other direction, “That’s two hours!”
“Trust me, Greg? Please?” She rubbed her forehead, “God I need a shower.”
“I can take care of that.” She smiled and leaned down for another kiss. She touched two fingers to Greg’s temple and felt his body relax and slow down.
“A useful friend! Oh,
“Old habits, lad.” He shrugged, giving his shoulder an experimental stretch.  This was one of his old fans, from back when he and Sherlock had worked together.
be happening again. It wasn’t fair, he deserved better than a simple “thank you for your service and efforts, good luck with your future endeavours” and a handshake. Which was, more or less, exactly what he was getting. John sighed and pushed the file on his desk aside, putting his head in both hands.
?” She narrowed her eyes. The train was beginning to slow as it pulled into Barbican Station.
“Oh, what did you
, do you?”
She bit her lip and sent another message right behind the first.
“Posh bastard.” John recovered, covered his mouth, coughed again, and reached for his drink. Sherlock handed it to him and let their fingers touch.
“Jesus. Is one
“I treated you like shit and turned my back on you!”
“Oh, god, don’t be sorry! You kind of turned my night around anyway, so I won’t complain!” He smiled and pushed her in the direction of the stairs, “Top of the stairs, second floor, alright? Either room you want is yours!”
with his time? Sherlock finished what he was doing in the kitchen and went out again, taking his place next to John, it seemed natural for him to be there. John sat down in the red armchair, Sherlock stood by him for a bit.
“God bless you, Watson. You’re a rare one.” He pocketed her card and they shook hands again before she left to see where Holmes had gotten off to. There was no sign of him on the floor, Donovan wasn’t much help, and she didn’t see him outside. So the sod had gone and run off again. Fantastic. Shaking her head, Judith called Mycroft Holmes, who offered to have a car pick her up and take her anywhere she wanted to go. But she didn’t have anywhere to go, no residence in London, and only the clothes on her back.
“What’s over there?”
“You had a good reason to. Not that I believed you for a minute, of course.”
“First time we
“I have a half-blind cat, she’s no bother though, minds her own business but puts herself quite firmly in mine.” John said, “And I object to unnecessary noise, I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours if I sleep at all, and I despise being idle for too long. I don’t like being bored.”
“Hey! Hey, no fights!” The barman shouted, a minute too late as the giant pulled his free hand back to punch John. John managed to duck at the last minute and winced as another patron took the full force of the giant’s fist. It turned out to be the man who had initially knocked into him and started this, so there was some kind of twisted justice there. John got himself out of the giant’s grip with a bit of dirty play, this wasn’t the first brawl he’d been in and it wasn’t going be the last, but he didn’t get very far before a blow from behind took him down. He hit the floor with a grunt and flipped onto his back, his vision swimming a bit, and tried to ward off the oncoming attack. A different patron had come after him but didn’t get more than a handful of John’s shirt to drag him back to his feet before he was bodily hauled away from John by someone else. There was so much commotion, so many people shouting and beating the shit out of each other, but John took the opportunity to scram and bolted for the door. One foot out the door and he was grabbed by the back of the shirt and shoved onto the pavement a split-second before someone was kneeling on his shoulders.
“It might be the only thing that is.” She looked at him, “It’s Sherlock. I need … to save his life.”
She had taken refuge in the motor-pool, sitting on the bonnet of a parked truck with her feet resting against the engine-grille, when she heard footsteps on gravel and raised her head enough to see him but not his face.
“Did someone else?” John frowned, not saying what was in his head: “Tell me their names and I will make them sorry for every word, every action they ever said or took against you.”
“John, his flat-mate Sherlock, and my flat-mate. Greg Lestrade.”
“Don’t ever,
“Not in practice, not anymore. I was never that interested, but my brother refused to suffer alone, so we went in together.”
“Not usually, no. I mean, she
And that was the last he heard before the dial-tone buzzed in his ear. Confident that he was completely alone, Sherlock put both hands to his face and sobbed. It was adrenaline, fear, and ultimately relief. But he had no control over his emotions right now, and he couldn’t be bothered to care.
“Hey, it’s me. Yeah, I’m alright. Listen, I just wanted to call and let you know ... ” he paused and looked over his shoulder at something John couldn’t see from here. “No, no, I’m fine. Yes, I promise. I just wanted to let you know I’m going to be home late tonight, so ... don’t wait up for me. No, I know I promised, I’m so sorry, love, but I have a couple of drunks to book in and reports to file before I get to come home. I know I have better things to do, but try telling my bosses that. And no, that was
“Hmm?” Rick was keeping an eye on the street. She read the message from her brother and chuckled.
“I had no say in the matter, you may take it up with M if you need someone to rant at.”
It got quiet after a while, and someone brought out an acoustic guitar, strumming random soft chords. There were tears and whispers, of course, but it wasn’t like any wake or house of grieving Judith had been in before. But then again, the Almonds were a unique family and didn’t approach things like death the same way others did.
He begged.
“From walking through a door?!” She let the boys help her up, trying to get over just how
“You know what to do with those, A.”
Families gathered to cheer on their loved ones up for promotion, and Judith knew better than to think anyone she considered family would actually make a show. Yes she had told John and Sherlock to come so she wouldn’t have to explain herself, but that didn’t really count. Not surprisingly, Greg and Sally showed up, but she had kind of expected them. But when John, Sherlock,
“I can’t
“M.” He squared his shoulders as he looked at the man sitting on the other side of the desk. “I came to return this to you.”
“Well, that’s very kind of him.” Sherlock just raised an eyebrow as John turned again so they were back to chest.
“Sherlock Holmes?”
“Nope.” John shook his head quickly, “What about you?”
“I just want you to understand that Constable Robertson’s reaction was completely normal in the circumstances and does not reflect on his character in any way.”
“Well, if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I should prefer having a partner to being alone.”  Stamford looked rather strangely at John over his pint-glass.
“Yeah!”
As he pushed the door open, a uniformed constable behind him to help with the arrest, he pocketed his phone. Time to put a spiteful, hateful woman away for good.
“Pleasure.”
“Used to say “You see but you do not observe.” Funny words for a genius like that.” The man chuckled, a soft, warm sound that shot through Sherlock’s heart and settled in his core, “Wise words, those. Learned more from that smug bastard than anyone else in my whole life.”
Word flew like wildfire and flowed like water around camp, so it wasn’t long before several of her men poked their heads in to see what was going on. As it became clear that she was getting a fast-track ticket home, they rallied and cleared out her barracks-room and her office. In under an hour, everything she owned in Afghanistan had been packed up and organised. She stacked her bags on the bed and checked to make sure she hadn’t forgotten anything. All of her personal effects and all of her clothes had been packed, everything was ready. Judith paced her small room, twirling an unlit cigarette between her fingers.
“Easy, Sherlock.” Judith put herself between the brothers, “Please, Mycroft, he’s in a bad way. The last thing he needs is the kind of stress you’ll put him through. He was kidnapped by the serial-killer responsible for Beth Davenport’s murder and the previous three. He took out another victim tonight and Sherlock might have been his sixth, but we got in the way.”
idea, their words that were circulating in The Met. If friends were the first ones to say it was all a conspiracy, that Sherlock Holmes was a true psychopath and a dangerous liability, it would be better for him.
“So, I doubt you went to all the trouble of coming down here just to see
“What are
“I’ve got personal interest in your boss’s safety and well-being, like hell am I going to sit there and let his bitch of an ex-wife tear him down.” She clenched and unclenched her right hand. Donovan’s phone rang, it was Lestrade with a case. Apparently this was an-all hands sort of affair and on top of calling in Sherlock Holmes, Lestrade wanted Judith and her brother along.
“Not yet. She’s got influence like nobody’s business. I don’t feel like levelling accusations that heavy against a woman far better equipped to fight me in court without solid evidence.”
“Sherlock?” He called out.
“Because she killed another Lycan.”
Checking the time, Greg realized he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, surviving on bad coffee and vending-machine snacks since then. Such was the life of a homicide detective. He groaned and ruffled his hair, irritated. On the other side of his desk, another glance was exchanged. He wondered if Judith and John ever actually spoke out loud to each other, or if they had adapted a silent method of communication.
“Ow!”
, specifically, to another island!” She grinned at him, “Oh, god, I never thought I’d get to come back here!”
“Not gonna happen.” Her brother muttered. They caught Sherlock with the safety-net of magic and lowered him to solid ground. The spells wrapped in around the troubled, disgraced consulting detective, and disappeared as soon as his head touched concrete. He was unconscious, and when they missed his pulse, John freaked out a bit. But cooler heads prevailed and Stephen took his pulse in his left wrist instead. He was alive but very death-like. A team of agents from Sherlock’s network disguised as hospital staff emerged and shuffled him off to the morgue.
“Are you ready?” He asked, making eye-contact with Sherlock.
with the likes of Stephen and Sherlock. They were careful with her, always, knowing she belonged to Greg.
John meets Mike Stamford in a bar. No brawls this time. Next stop: Saint Bart's Hospital.
“How did you know we were armed? You didn’t even look at us.”
“What?” His voice was nearly an octave lower. If she’d been booted from The Met, he would have been the
“I’m fine.” He raised his head, “You?”
“It never seemed important.” He shrugged. Sherlock snorted. Saying their goodbyes, John and Sherlock stopped by The Met to file formal reports on the case and then returned to Baker Street. Not quite business as usual, but damn close enough. Now all they had to do was come back from the dead. Well, Sherlock had to come back from the dead, John not so much.
On one occasion she had spent six hours of her own time, while on the clock, tracking a tricky suspect across half of London. She had ended up pursuing the bastard right off of the Millennium Bridge into the Thames in the course of a foot-chase. A River Patrol boat had hauled her from the water six minutes after she cleared the railings and she’d spent the night in Saint Bart’s. Another boat had dragged the suspect out a few miles downriver, waterlogged and half-dead from exhaustion and hypothermia. Greg had been at her side from the minute she was pulled from the water until they discharged her the next morning. , He’d actually been on that boat and pulled her from the river himself. It had not been a pleasant night for either of them.
“Well, if she’s going into CID with Lestrade and Donovan, a year. Maybe. She went to school for forensics and criminal justice, and she cleared her required two-hundred hours of operational service and got Independent Patrol Status last month.” Sherlock mused, grinning as he looked at something on his phone, “That’s why they put her up at Detective Constable. She’ll take the necessary courses immediately, but there are no concerns for where she’ll go from here.”
John and Sherlock come back from the dead, having never actually BEEN dead in the first place, and it's back to business as usual for Baker Street.
brother, making a pittance on private cases when he gets them?”
“Right, sir. I suppose I could call you damn well anything I wanted, since I outranked you a long time ago.”
“Absolutely. Nice to see you again, Greg.” Hooper smiled as they headed for the door together. “Bye, Doctor Watson!”
comforting.” He snorted, “Fine. My eyes are closed. Now what?”
“No rush, Jude, take your time. This isn’t a small affair, anyway, and the press-con’s just for the sake of the press before word gets out somewhere else.” Greg followed her to the door and hugged her tight, wishing her luck as she set off on her own.
She yelled as she took off for the door.
! Thank you!” He lifted his right hand as if to embrace Sherlock, but then lowered it and offered it to him to shake instead. “Sherlock Holmes.” They both looked down at the offered hand, then Sherlock slowly raised his own right hand and took it.
O sinners, let's go down
“Does he, though?” Greg raised an eyebrow in challenge. John couldn’t imagine they were hiring completely incompetent people, but something told him that Anderson, whoever that was, wasn’t among the best of them.
“Miss you for lunch, then?”
“Just a bit. Wanted to know who you were.” He shrugged.
“You’re coming with me, Sherlock Holmes, and none of your friends can stop me.”
“You’re…”
“You are a father, with a four-year-old daughter, no one could realistically expect you to have enough time to yourself to maintain a military-strict exercise regimen.”
“Git. I can’t imagine what time it is there, nor do I care. That was terrible timing!”
, John, I don’t mind the company.” Sherlock’s smile was ... well,
“Oh?”
“Your ticket out of this hell.” He folded his hands behind his back, “I’d like you out of here before you get yourself shot.”
“Yes, ma’am!” His smile was a bit brighter and she handed him the second wet flannel, which he used to wipe his face. She pressed a packet of oyster crackers into his hand as she got up, nodding as he ripped it open and nibbled on the little crackers inside. It wasn’t much, but it would settle his stomach a bit.
“I’m not being dramatic!”

“You took that better than I would have.”

John returned home to his flat, paid for and kept up by MI6, and looked around. He felt kind of ... lost, but he suspected that was just normal for someone in his position. He remembered feeling the same way the first time he’d found himself in this position, back in 2009, and how much he had
“Mycroft.” They said in unison, with a great deal less of the usual spite. Sometimes, Mycroft Holmes could be downright useful. This mess was definitely one of those times.
“Fancy running into you on a late train like this, Colonel Watson.” The blond menace was just as soft-spoken and careful not to smile. Judith hadn’t been addressed by her rank in almost nine months and sat up a bit more. Had she
“What did you have in mind?”
“Judith, calm down. You just got the absolute worst news anyone ever gets, you can be forgiven for letting it slip your mind. I mean, it’s

of my problems, and it’s easier to just ignore him.” She got up and brushed off her uniform, “Well, I’ve got a date with the Chief Superintendent. So, if you two will kindly excuse me, I’ll try to make it back down for the press-con.”
“When did you move back in?”
“Frostbite and hypercapnia.”
“Why, what is there against him?”
“Yesterday.” John flicked a piece of sand off his collar, “Did we really get another one?”
me any different, never let on that you knew what you knew.”
“One person. She thought I was mad.”
Sighing, John leaned his elbows on his knees and ran his hands through his hair, sitting still for a moment before he heaved himself off the bed. He made his way to the water-closet and took care of business before returning to the small bedroom that would be his until further notice. He had no intention of moving out of Baker Street, he rather liked the cluttered flat and it’s very unusual tenant, but it wasn’t for certain just how

called
“You’re…what, in your early thirties?”
“Well, it makes sense that an older man of your age might need to rest a bit.”
.” A dismissive gesture at his state of dress and appearance. It was the worst Sherlock had seen John in...well, he wasn’t sure he’d ever seen John this dishevelled.
“And you’re his sane handler. Oh my god.”
“Incredible.” John just smiled at him and he momentarily forgot what he was doing.
“I think you’re…a good person. Desperate and driven to do unforgivable things.” She tapped her fingertips together, looking across at her suspect, “Can you go to prison with a clear conscience?”
“Your brother’s been quite a busy bee. Nearly all of my things have been moved in and unpacked.”
I used the “Unaired Pilot” instead of ASiP for the final showdown between Sherlock and Mr Hope, but this is where things veer a bit off-course. As if they haven’t already. But you’ll see why!  Credit for ALL quotes from this and other episodes goes to the lovely Ariane DeVere (arianedevere@livejournal.com), who painstakingly transcribed everything from ASiP (both versions, God bless her!) to TAB.
“Not at all.” Hutchison just smiled and they moved the ice to the boot of his squad-car. John gave his keys to Ford, who would follow behind, and got in the back seat of Hutchison’s car with Sherlock.
“I don’t know. I always wanted an Irish Setter.”
“What business is that of yours?!” she hissed.
“Mother.” He lowered his head, a sign of submission? Or repentance? Watching someone like John Watson kneel to another was almost heartbreaking, Sherlock forced himself to remain still. It was clear life had not been very kind to Alexandra Watson, that she had suffered in the thirty-two years since her exile. But she was stronger for it and while her scars did not define her, they had made her the woman she was now. For a moment, it was quiet in the room, and then she reached out one hand, slowly, as if uncertain of the reception she would receive. Sherlock saw a shudder wrack John’s body as the outstretched hand came to rest upon his bowed head and it took every ounce of self-restraint he had not to go to his mate’s side and comfort him. This was not for him to interrupt.
“Mmm, yes.” A tightening of his expression was all the warning he got, it was time to tread carefully.

“You’re just like him. So critical.”

“Wouldn’t be a game if you knew.” The cabbie shrugged, “You’re the one who chooses.”
“Found work for me. Well, us.” He got up, pocketing his phone and went to fetch his coat. “I don’t suppose you’d like to come along, would you?”
“That bad?”
“Mm. Mycroft’s then?”
“Oh, right.” Hooper seemed to realize that John and Lestrade had never been properly introduced. “Um, Greg Lestrade, John Watson.”
“Well, as for me I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. There is usually some manner of human body parts involved.” Sherlock studied the concrete between his shoes. John could only imagine what he was looking at. “Would that annoy you?”
“Yeah.”

He sounded very serious,

“Oh, you don’t…”
“Not that I minded. Could have done without the armed escort, but the dogs were nice enough.”

“That’s Mary Morstan. She’s been here about a year or so, I think?”
“Hmm?”
“Boys! Door!”
“Ironic that it’s always soldiers. Your soldiers no less.” He rolled his eyes.

“John and I think it was, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Sherlock says the same.” She looked around, “I am so sorry about all of this, I really wish I wasn’t…well, I’m not telling you anything you didn’t know already, but…you’re my family. I hate giving bad news like this.” Gerald’s father-in-law, who lived next-door in Unit 31, came over and hugged her tight before ushering her to a seat on the crowded couch.
“Christ. Just don’t abandon her, Sherlock, don’t run off on her! Hear me?”

“You’ll see! Something to keep you busy a while.” He kissed the tip of her nose, “I will keep my word. Go on, you’ve been missed.” He let her go and headed off down the street. Judith watched until he was out of sight, wondering what it was about Moriarty.
It was a quiet drive from the Tesco to the Billingsley’s house, or as quiet as it could be with three squad-cars making a show of force with blues-and-twos on full. When they arrived, he got out of Hutchison’s car and looked over the roof at Sherlock.
“That’s not fair. There’s two of you!”
“Jude?” John watched her, “You alright?”
“Thanks, Gary.” John smiled at the man. Gary just nodded and went back to serving customers. Judith drained hers with a speed that had won her many drinking-contests in their Army days, setting the empty glass down with a thud and turning from the bar. She didn’t care for anyone who might be watching as she took a bit of her mood out on poor Greg, who didn’t seem to mind much.
“I thought you might pick those.” Magnus just smiled at him and set the tray aside. “Anything you want to add to them?”

“Christ, you’re mad to think I’d leave you here! I only leave for work or to take a shower and check on the cats!”
“Can I take you to dinner?”
“We’ve got proper warrants, Mrs Hudson,” Judith called back, coming to a halt halfway up when she found her way blocked by her brother.
“Are you leaving, Daddy?” She asked sweetly, looking up at him with the prettiest brown eyes. He smiled and hugged her tight.

been his coat, all along! Watson had kept it for him all these weeks, protected it without even knowing what it was! The magic knit into the fabric made his skin tingle pleasantly, and he sighed a bit selfishly.
“And this, too.” He handed over the glass of whiskey and fetched up the card and change.
“Absolutely. And I think we’d better make sure we close Mrs Hudson’s door or she might have some cross words for us.”
have a ring, it wasn’t something he’d come here to do anyway. But he had the feeling if he asked the right people, he’d find what he needed. He knew Judith’s ring-size, so that was the simple part. Going to the front desk, he begged the pretty clerk for help.

there to make a nuisance of myself.”
“Are you nervous, Zazi?” Riyah smiled over her shoulder.
“Oh my god. Is this ... ?”
“Met Police, open up!” She called out loudly. There was a commotion inside, she heard John yelling at someone, and looked at Sally, who nodded and stepped up to the door.
“Yes.” Sherlock pushed back and up on his elbows, making eye-contact. “I’m ... clean. I have been for quite some time. Please, John. I want this, I really do.”
Another ten minutes had them calling his sister’s name.
“Ohh.” The cabbie turned away with a sigh. Hmm. He looked at Sherlock again.
“Are you alright, Judith?”
Then, in 2009, Judith received new orders. She now had fifteen years of commendable service under her belt and she was eligible for retirement. She wouldn't have made a huge deal out of it if the orders had been handed over by one of her commanding officers, but she knew something was up when, as she returned from a morning patrol, she saw a chopper coming in from the east, in from Kandahar by the looks of it.
“Throw in dinner and you have my attention.”
“Kept him alive. You’re welcome.”
“Not on our end, they didn’t.” Hutchison smiled and helped them stand. Sherlock looked for the projectile and found a hole in the wall.
“I…abandoned you, Sherlock. Spilt my guts over your grave, and then a few months later I turn around and forget about you completely.” A sniffle, a stiffening of his shoulders. “I wish I could say you would have adored Mary, but...maybe you would’ve. I don’t know, she was so…so…”
“If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t be married to that insufferable government prick.” John knew what had been left unsaid and smiled a bit. “You’re welcome, Greg.”
“What a strange family.”
good. But?”
“I told you. Next time, aim for the head.” John said calmly. “But there’s not going to
“Yes.”
“You know, this is where we send difficult students to test their ability to get out of a difficult situation. You come here for escape.”
“See what, exactly?”
“You?” Greg clearly didn’t believe him. “But you were still in the Army, why would MI6 care what you had to say about a body-guard?”
“Catherine House. This way.” She headed north a bit on the foot-path and turned the corner going left to reach Catherine House. She would bet money the rest of the Almond family already knew, but she owed it to them to give them the affirmative in person. She and Donovan climbed the many stairs to the third floor, and she counted doors and apartment-numbers until they got to 30 Catherine House. The door itself was propped open a bit, which she remembered as a habit from her childhood. People didn’t really close their doors around here, which would probably make canvassing the area much easier. And if her name got around before they started asking questions of the neighbours, all the better. Most of these people knew her, had for years.
“Oh, well, I don’t know what kind of work you’re
“Hmm?”
“If you’d like.” He balled up the tape and threw it aside, unzipping the parka, “Christ.”
“That’s an interesting mix. I guess you don’t have much to do with the Court, then?”
men for less than the behaviour I’ve seen from you today. I am not the sort of person to insult, to underestimate. I will take great pleasure in proving you wrong, violently if I must.” He smoothed a wrinkle out of his coat sleeve and looked up to make deliberate eye-contact again. “A little respect where due, Mr Holmes, will take you far in life.”
Sherlock sat on the bed, long legs stretched out, back against the headboard, looking at something on the tablet John had given him for his birthday last year. God, had it been that long? Hearing him come out of the bathroom, Sherlock looked up and when he saw the expression on John’s face, he quickly set down the tablet.
“What about you, then?”
“Oh, Rosie.” John sighed. He still had his keys to Baker Street, Mrs Hudson just wouldn’t take them back, she said it wasn’t right to take away the only safe place John really had.
“Precisely the point.”

“Good night, boys!” Mrs Hudson called cheerfully from the bottom of the stairs. “I’ll have earplugs in!”
of their two layover stops. She slept through the stop they made in Madrid to refuel, and most of the overseas flight from Madrid to Miami. They watched the sunrise in Miami, and ate breakfast in San Juan, catching a chopper-flight from San Juan to their final destination.
Two days later, John looked out the window of Baker Street and found the sidewalk crowded with reporters. It was barely past eight in the morning, he noted with a sense of disdain.
He could see Sherlock’s fingers twitching, but it wasn’t a tremor, it was a nervous tic. John chuckled and dug a slightly-crumpled pack of cigarettes from his back pocket. After checking to make sure that the pack wasn’t empty, he gave a soft whistle and got Sherlock’s attention. When the young detective looked at him, he gestured with the pack in question. Already dilated eyes got wider and he just smiled as he tossed the pack to Sherlock, who caught the pack, flipped it open with a practised flick of his thumb, and extracted two cigarettes.
“I didn’t
“Where’d Barstow run off to?”
“Oh, no! You’re a proper puzzle, John Watson, and I can’t wait to figure you out! You are one of the most interesting people I’ve ever met, never mind that you used to work for or with or do whatever with my stupid older brother. How could you
“No, Mr Brook.” She held out one hand to him, “And I have strong words for the people who did this to you. Were you hurt at all last night?”
that good! No, he didn’t have time to wonder. He looked up at Magnus and picked up both rings.
“This is Confirmed Bachelor John Watson on the pull, looking for the best potential target to fill an empty, cold bed for a night.” A shrug and another sip of the whiskey, “Like it?”
“Shit.” John groaned as Sherlock got busy.
“I’ve known him a bit.” She shrugged, “Besides, I’ve seen and handled far worse in Afghanistan.”
“Excellent. Yeah, we’ll go. Sherlock?”
“Oh, they just like me because I bring them catnip and cheese.”
Crawling out from under the trailer, Judith wondered what anyone who might have seen her would have thought. She knew there were cameras all over the site, and wondered if Mycroft was watching tonight. He’d been keeping closer tabs on her and John and Sherlock after the third suicide, concerned for their safety. It was a kind gesture, but unnecessary, as Judith and John were far more than capable of handling themselves in nearly every violent situation they might get into. She carried the box back to her car and set it on the front seat, holding the door for the mother cat, who had followed along at heel like a dog. She watched as the mother hopped into the box and started grooming her kittens.

“Yeah, absolutely! And uh, just call me Greg.”
“Of course.  Thank you, sir.” He said carefully. John maintained a calm he did not feel as he M got to his feet and held out one hand. Shaking hands with M, he looked around the office one last time. M walked him out, as was customary, and he paid a quick visit to Q-Branch before leaving MI6.
“What?” John looked round at him. Where were they? Sherlock looked round to get an idea of things. Oh, there was Greg Lestrade, Sally Donovan, and Judith Watson was behind them. That radio was Greg’s. There was no way he had simply forgotten his radio. This was Greg’s car, the silver BMW he drove when he wasn’t in Judith’s Rover, which was parked at a bit of an angle nearby. That was Greg’s radio, and he felt something in his pocket. Judith had just dropped a key into his trouser pocket. Handcuff keys. The keys to the exact set of handcuffs he and John had been locked into.
“Absolutely! She’d never forgive us if we left her out!” He smiled, “She’s been wanting a dog for years.”
“So you came
“I can still find out, you know.”
Judith couldn't help making comparisons again between Stephen and Sherlock. They were the same height, the only difference between them was their accents, hair-styles, and what they did for a living. They both had a fondness for dramatics, and slightly ridiculous clothing choices. They could talk faster than most people processed a single thought, and were both much smarter than anyone deserved to be. Reckless, careless, but aware of their loved ones. She was pulled from her train of thought by a soft metallic clatter. Stephen had found her id-tags. He read them to himself, smiling.
“Well, we’re not strangers.”

“Don’t we always?”
“Oh, I said it.” Anderson looked smug as he walked into the flat.
will not be harmed.”
“I don’t know what you’re into, but you’re coming back with me.” He took her by the hand and pulled her to her feet, “Come on, you.”
“Didn’t mean it as a compliment.”
“Then you don’t know him very well.”
“Of course, Mr Holmes.” Mrs Hudson just followed Mycroft downstairs and saw him out. Once Mycroft was gone, Mrs Hudson came back upstairs. She had tea, which Sherlock was grateful for.
“Then, where do we go? What can we do?”
“Which “look”?”
“No. I’m...not. But you came. How did...?”
that?”
“Did you have any plans to leave the house today?”
“What is that?”
“Maybe. Definitely an amateur.” John drummed his fingers against his thigh until Sherlock took his hand to stop him.
“And I’ll do it many times more, son.” He closed his eyes and let the sway of the cab lull him until they reached their destination. He got out behind Sherlock and paid the fare, just like the old days, thanking the driver, and looked around.
“I think it is best if we took our leave now, Gregory,” Mycroft said quietly. “With Your Majesty’s leave.”
“That’s alright, Mrs. Hudson. We’ll wait for them to come back.” Greg just smiled at the kind landlady. They cleared the seventeen steps to 221B and searched the flat. Not that they had to look very far, a pink overnight case sat open on the coffee-table.
. Proper genius.” The cabbie turned and walked back to the table as Sherlock’s head slumped down onto his hand again. He felt terrible, far worse than any hangover or high. And he was more likely to suffer a hangover than a high these days.
Sherlock was distracted by a tug on his hand and he turned away. He let John lead him out of the sitting-room, back through the kitchen, and into his bedroom.
Sure enough, they didn’t wait five minutes for a call to come through on the radio for a potential domestic disturbance called in by neighbours.
“Mm, didn’t think we were.” John smiled, “So?”
“Y’know, I thought we were lucky this thing wasn’t a dog or a cat, I kind of expected it to hiss at us.” He rubbed the soft fabric between his fingers and smirked as it twitched. “Touchy thing, ain’t it?”
“Ma’am.” His brother dropped a deep and proper bow to the exiled  Summer Queen and took his leave quietly. The bodyguards withdrew as well. As the door closed, John finally just…Sherlock wasn’t sure how to classify the sound. It was something deep and gut-wrenching, pulled from some untouched depth of emotion locked away for so long. It almost sounded like a mournful howl.
“John.” He held out his hand to his mate, marvelling at the colouring of his pelt, which he had seen only very briefly. The fur was soft under his fingers and he discovered that John liked being scratched behind the ears. He was careful of the wounds, but John didn’t mind being handled. Leaning down, he kissed John on the forehead, stop, and muzzle. And John let him.
“It is, too! Lucky bastard, you’ll be the one salt-and-peppered with those gorgeous curls.”
“I know them.” He looked down at the body now covered by a sheet, watching as a couple of techs took a gurney down to collect the body.
“Thank you.”
“I know, I know. It’s awful.” He grabbed his laptop and sat down on the couch with Sherlock, browsing news-sites for any information on the case he was calling A Spot of Mystery in his head. There wasn’t much, maybe a couple of second-page spreads, a few ads placed in the wanted columns. They spent the rest of the day working on the dognapping case.
“Well, here goes nothing.”
“English or Gaelic?”
“I think I’ll be a bit worried. Well, this is my stop, gentlemen.” Judith got up as the train slowed to a halt and the recorded voice announced their stop, heading for the opening doors. She had a short, six-minute walk from Barbican Station to Saint Bart’s Hospital. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, a message from Sherlock.
It took John almost two hours to find it, buried in a skip under a pile of trash-bags. It reeked of god knows what, but John retrieved the coat, a beautiful custom-made Belstaff coat with red button-holes on the lapels and a blue cashmere scarf stuffed into a pocket. Bundling the coat into a handy, clean paper sack, John made his way home. He would have the coat cleaned tomorrow and return it to its owner at the soonest. He had an old Army buddy of his who ran a bespoke dry-cleaning service, gave fellow vets a healthy discount and did uniforms for free up to three full kits.
“No kidding! Oh my god, Watson.” Lestrade set his empty glass down on the table and stared at it for a minute. “And, um, thank you.”
“Well, if I thought I could coax you out of the house to come

seen them before, it had just been so very long since. On the left upper arm, from shoulder to just above the elbow, was a black line-art tattoo of a caduceus, the Rod of Asclepius and the two snakes; on the right, a quarter-sleeve tattoo in full, vibrant colour of the coat of arms of the Royal Army Medical Corps that stretched from shoulder to elbow; and peeking above the collar of his shirt, an anatomically correct heart. The arteries and aortic arch were clearly visible in strokes of black ink against pale skin that held just a hint of tan, and Sherlock recalled where the knotted lines of the scar on John’s chest broke up the lines of the tattoo. A reminder of just how frighteningly close they had come to losing each other without knowing. And how many times since 2011 had the same damn thing happened? Sherlock sighed and took a fortifying sip of his drink, leaning against the door to watch. He didn’t even notice John was gone until a hand landed on his arm and tightened, until a puff of warm breath hit the side of his neck as he was used as leverage to get John up on tip-toe.
“We met at The Criterion this afternoon. We visited Saint Bart’s after talking for a bit and a round of drinks.” He said. “I got to meet Doctor Hooper, she’s quite lovely.”
Two voices were in perfect unison. She sighed and looked at her watch. She had to be at the Swearing Room by noon, it was half eleven.
“Absolutely.” Lestrade nodded and stepped close to Sherlock, carefully putting a hand on his arm, a neutral, supportive grip. “I heard about this morning. Are you okay, Sherlock?”
Finally, Sherlock made a move. A daring move, he started to walk slowly towards the calm hostage. Judith pulled open her jacket to reveal the bomb strapped to her chest and Sherlock felt a deep dread.. From somewhere in the upper gallery, a sniper’s laser immediately began to dance around over the vest as Judith blinked a subtle S.O.S. message that he would have missed if he hadn’t been looking at her eyes. Behind him, Greg and John both made the same noise.
“Perhaps.” John smirked, “So, what am I to do with you, boy? Hmm?”
“That’s a sonogram photo.” Sherlock indicated a little printed black-and-white photograph.
“Ta. You’ve got a kettle in working order, I hope?”
“Of course, yes.” She worked in a bloody war-zone, trouble was part of the lifestyle. “Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.”
“Of a sort. I’m not
“Unless you’ve got Werekin blood. I do.” He sighed, head bowed, “My Mum was a Werewolf, Lycan, actually. Shapeshifter. Da was a Cù-Sìth, never knew ‘im growing up, he didn’t stay after I was born.”
“You’ve rather shown your hand there, Doctor Watson.” Something had just happened, Sherlock had caught a glimpse of red light in the corner of his vision, and Judith’s expression had softened into horror. He shook his head slightly. This wasn’t out of their hands
“Oh, this is lovely. Such pretty colouring. I didn’t expect you to be so large, though.”
“Yes, Lestrade.”

“Aneurysm.” The cabbie lifted his right hand and tapped the side of his head. “Right in ’ere. Any breath could be my last. It’s your only ’ope, Mr ’olmes. Bet on the aneurysm.”
me, you wouldn’t have to worry about that.” John smiled as he took Sherlock’s hand in his. “I’ll settle for a proper goodbye kiss, however.”
“Sorry?”
lived long enough to retire from the Agency. 006 and 007 had both retired in the past two years, settled into some semblance of domestic bliss that worked for them, and now it was his turn. John was the last of a dying breed, the last of the Old Timers dying off or being phased out and replaced by younger, more able-bodied Agents more than willing to take over the mantles of their famous or infamous predecessors.
Just what it says on the tin: Part 1 of 2.
She snarled, rubbing her cheek,
She remembered to breathe a split-second before his lips touched hers in something slow and frantic all at once that tasted like toothpaste. They hadn’t eaten today, but she detected a hint of curry. Probably from yesterday’s lunch? A door opening downstairs broke the moment, and Judith caught her breath again.
“Hi, sweetie.”
“Oh, lovely. That’ll do, when we figure out what in hell’s name is going on around here.” Greg rolled his eyes.
“Ask him about what happened in Singapore sometime.” John’s smile was positively wicked and Sherlock was left to follow after him.
“What’s in it for me?”
“Me, too.” He sighed and took John’s hand. The bed was as large and soft as he remembered, the mattress felt too squishy to be the one he’d slept on before 2011, but it was familiar. It didn’t take long to get situated, and he found himself in a very familiar, very comfortable position. Whatever John did with MI6 kept him in excellent physical condition, he was missing much of the softness he had acquired living with Sherlock after leaving the Army. Sherlock made note of old curves and new ones, found new scars in new places, badges of honourable service in the name of The Crown. Touching led to kissing, kissing led to other more interesting, more intimate activities, and Sherlock revelled in the sound of his name uttered in soft gasps and curses.
A week after the final confrontation at The Diogenes Club, John Watson had quite literally disappeared. When questioned, Martha Hudson admitted only to seeing him leave with a rucksack full of clothes early one morning, upon inspection of the flat it was discovered that he had taken cash, his driver's license, and passport but nothing else. Two weeks worth of clothes were gone, as well as one of Sherlock Holmes’s dressing-gowns, a much-worn and beloved blue silk number that had been retired after an accident with sulphuric acid and cow tongues had burned a hole in one sleeve. No one had been hurt in the accident, but the last time the robe had been worn was the night before Sherlock had become one of London’s most wanted potential criminal masterminds. His toiletry kit was intact, which led to the understanding that he would have purchased the necessary items as he needed them.
of opening the doors.
“I don’t suppose you’d accept an apology, would you?”
“Still haven’t caught the bastard, have ya?” Kittern’s boyfriend, Louis Raleigh, shuffled his feet, swaying.
“Can you
“Safe as I can be, sir.”
“I think you deserve better, but look at the life you’ve made for yourself. Hell, Judith, you just made retirement as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the bloody British Army, honors to boot! Would I be mistaken to think Richard Hughes and his existing family were more the family you deserved than your own?”
“I haven’t heard from her or seen her in thirty-two years, I don’t even know if she’s still
Moran chuckled,
“These are coming with us.” He said simply. Sherlock nodded and made sure he had everything he needed. Going out to the sitting-room, he found Alexandra in conference with his brother and Lestrade. Working out the specifics, no doubt.
“You have better things to do than keep a retired veteran out of jail, Inspector.”
He enjoyed seeing how Sherlock reacted to him, how he reacted to the way John did things in the bedroom. The soft moans and cries, the way he arched off the bed so much John could slide an arm around him and hold him up. The angry red tracks that were being scratched into John’s back and shoulders, marks he would wear with honour. The sloppy, off-centre kisses, the quiet reassurances and pleas for “more, more, please”, the dampness on Sherlock’s cheeks as they lay together after, recovering.
“Then I choose for you, and I force it down your throat.” The cabbie shrugged, “Right now there’s nothing
“This is going to sound a bit silly, I’m afraid, but, uh, I seem to have come up with a plan but don’t have anything to do with.” He looked around, double-checking for any sign of Judith. She was out on the water at the moment, so he was safe. “You see, I, um, I was hoping you could point me in the direction of somewhere I could find a, eh, ring of sorts?” God, he was stumbling. The clerk studied him and he groaned.
“And you were a Double-Oh?”
“Computer error, Major.” John had a notebook out and was writing in it, dead calm and very serious about the whole mess, “It’ll all have to go in the report.”
They walked a ways together, not saying anything, but the silence was not uncomfortable. Whatever questions he had would only be answered if he was brave enough to ask.
“They’re so
“Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths.” They both knew the answer to that question, ta.
One of the lead dancers, an absolutely gorgeous Amazon with caramel skin, wavy black hair, and eyes like quicksilver, approached their table. There was some elbowing and chuckling and teasing as their company took bets on which among them would be the unfortunate sacrifice to the mild humiliations of the stage. Judith was quick to deduce her purpose and raised an eyebrow as she took another sip of her beer, maintaining a passably straight face. Someone had passed word to the people that mattered here and she had a damn good idea who. As the tall dancer, a girl named Riyah, approached Judith’s side of the table, there was a murmur among their group. Lestrade watched with an unusual intensity, prepared to step in on her behalf if necessary. Judith signalled him to stay put, using hand-signs they had learned in the Army. He nodded, leant back, relaxed, and picked up his beer again. She was in no danger, and any trouble that might arise was nothing she couldn’t handle by herself. He would know if she required intervention. Taking Riyah’s hand, she got to her feet and turned to her highly-interested table-mates.

They decided against calling in back-up just for the moment, but sat on the flat for a while to keep an eye on things. Mrs. Hudson went out after a bit, drinks with Mrs. Turner next door, she said.
“Where’d she go?”
Judith could just see the smug expression on his face as he typed that out. What kind of research required a night in the morgue? Best not to ask, she’d probably find out anyway.
“Absolutely
Mycroft’s voice was calming to Sherlock, which he needed and appreciated just at the moment.
“I can’t possibly mean that much to him.”
“What?” John was a little confused by the sudden change of subject.
“I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone.”
“They’re all former patients of mine.” He cleared his throat.
“You make it sound so…
“What? Besides drink myself stupid in crowded bars on weeknights and get into fist-fights with people twice my size but not my ability?”
“Yes, ma’am.” The pair of constables saluted and took off. As soon as they were out of sight, Judith looked at Sally and let out the breath she’d been holding for what seemed like hours.
“Sorry, it’s a bit of a gift.” She shrugged, “God, I sound like him, don’t I? I’m sorry.”
Judith was pacing the ruins of the Map Room in Kamar-Taj, waiting for Stephen to come back, and knew the worst had happened when she saw the tears on his cheeks. But the current trouble with the Zealots kept her from offering him any consolation. She found John in Hong Kong, and they stood witness to Stephen’s risky bargain with Dormammu. As the city continued on its way around them, it’s citizens unaware of what had just happened, they watched as Mordo decided it was time for a crusade.
“He wouldn't. Brook isn’t as important to him as Moriarty was.” John leaned his head back, far calmer than Greg would have been in his place.

“Greg.” She was trying to get his attention, but he was too focused. Finally he managed roughly strip the jacket and vest off Judith’s arms.

“Right
“She has a way with animals,” Sherlock said as they reached the top of the stairs, waiting for John to catch up. The door of 221B was closed, but Sherlock opened it as John reached the landing. The flat itself was cluttered and messy, but it didn’t really bother John.
, but it’s my job to notice things, and let me tell you what…”
They found an empty table for two and sat down to talk a bit.
last night! Too damn close! What did Hope tell you?”
“Quite alright. It’s not like I didn’t get a medical degree in forensic pathology, is it?”
“Yes, I think we can go to Baker Street.” Sherlock rubbed her shoulders, “But we’ll go tomorrow, okay?”
“Well, that took long enough!” She snapped. “You were out on an ice-run, not a manhunt.” Then she happened to look over his shoulder. She missed the police at first, but not Sherlock. Her eyes widened and she turned white as a sheet.
“That’s my girl.” John was
“Not here, the killer took it with them.” Someone else provided.
“You okay?” Donovan asked in a quiet voice, “Off again?”
He had seen the girls of Maroush dance many, many times in the past and always adored it. It didn’t take a genius detective to recognize Judith Watson as the lauded Zazi, but Greg was absolutely floored. It was like watching magic happen, the way she moved so effortlessly, so confidently. She had experience with this, obviously, and as the set continued, and they pulled off different dances, he watched her confidence blossom. She had started out with a bit of reserve, almost nervous, but as she hit her rhythm, her confidence took front and center and it showed in her energy.
“An honest mistake I will never, ever repeat.”
“I’m good for now, John. Thanks for…well, whatever this is.” She hugged her brother, “See you in the morning?”
“Oh, I’ll say you did!” Greg grinned, “Oh, we are
“Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present,” Sherlock called out, announcing himself. “Oh, that’s what it’s all been for, hasn’t it? All your little puzzles; making me dance – all to distract me from
They must have wasted nearly three hours out on that balcony, drinking and smoking like the old friends they were. When they were down to dog-ends, they scraped out the fags, dumped the stubs in Sherlock’s glass, which had a half-sip of alcohol he had no interest in finishing anyway, and went inside to close their tabs. Then it was downstairs through a mass of humanity, Sherlock leading the way, John’s hand tight in his, out to the bustling street where he materialized a taxi, and John gave an address somewhere in…Baker Street?
“That’s fine, Mike. Shall we, then?” John got up and collected his coat, Stamford followed suit.

“I never said you couldn’t.” That got him a sly smile, “Get in the car, I owe you dinner.”

“That’s amazing!”

“Thank you, sir.” It was a quiet drive back to Risby, and John got them heading back to London once they got the all-clear from the units on the ground. They got back half an hour before the caravan from Risby, and they took the chance to return to Baker Street, take a shower, and make themselves presentable. Greg came and picked them up, driving them down to Lambeth at the head of the Risby caravan.
“You’re an angel, Mrs. H.” She kissed her brother’s landlady on the cheek, “Are the boys home right now?”

“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are.” An eye-roll, a huff. The taxi began to slow and Stamford looked out the window. “But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.”
“Eh, the lads are used to seeing me like this.” He shrugged and turned, hopping off the retaining wall.

“Bloody hell. If Sherlock could see me now, he’d laugh until it killed him.”
“You kept two of them, yeah?”
“Or doesn’t.” Stephen rolled his eyes. Judith chuckled.
“Right. Your service-history is a bit shorter than Judith’s, yeah?” He shook his head, “She’s been in the Army almost as long as I was married, for Chrissakes.”
“Yes. So do you.”
This is a short one. Sorry. I broke up Part 2 of A Spot of Mystery, figuring the formal, public return/resurrection of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes deserved it's own chapter. I might put up more in the future, despite this being marked "Complete", I have more written.
