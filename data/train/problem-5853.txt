"Not so rude, when you practically bring a child with the same hair color and skin ton as you to the house, tell me Stark, how long have you been cheating on Steven?" Natasha gave a smirk as she walked toward Tony and Steve, probably thinking that she finally managed to drop one on Tony; the woman had been practically hounding him like a leech for years trying to find something imperfect with him. so far, out of every annoying Avengers, Bruce was his favorite, even when the man still glare at him sometimes he was still a friend; followed by Bucky who ended up being desperate enough that he proposed being the second husband and even accepted being in a threesome relationship if it meant being with Steve… that man is persistent, Tony had to give him that.
"So finally you showed your face." Tony snapped as he stood up, carrying the pup with him frowning as at the redhead officer that was glaring at him. "Where were you when that fucker was going to kidnap the pup?" Tony nearly snarled glaring at the people hiding behind the officer wincing as the furious Omega hissed when the officer took a step forward. "Everyone with two brain cells and a nose can see that this fucker was not the pup's parent! Why the fuck didn't you do anything? Or was it because he wasn't one of yours?" Tony raged at the bystanders as he stalked toward the officer with a dark glare on his face, ignoring when the woman blink and looked at the man that was still lying where Tony left him looking at the Omega in fear, the people around them flinch at the scent of an angry Omega.
"I did." Tony seemed so happy when he said that, like being able to go through that small promise meant the world to him, it made Steve pause a little and he gave a hum, looking at his feet before letting out a sigh and glance at the Alpha that was chatting with Peter happily while sending Steve glances now and them.
' as he held Tony tightly, causing Tony to nod his head, not making any sound as he tried to regain his bearers.
Luck seemed to be on his side when he saw the man once more, he was older than the last time he saw him, instead of being a young man in his prime, he was clearly old, old enough to have children and for them to be out of his house, that was the first time the star was shocked because it was then that he realized how fleeting Midgardian's lives were.
Four months passed and Steve did end up getting better, he put a little weight until he was finally what considered a healthy pregnant Omega, Steve made sure to take care of himself after his visit to the hospital, he was still struggling financially but his work at the book store and the college saving helped with the rent and the necessity he needed or wanted, using from his college's saving meant that Steve ends up dropping from college, it was hard being an Omega in college as people still weren't that open-minded yet, but a pregnant one? It was going to be a nightmare. Steve had the choice between, struggling after the baby was born if he continued going to college, or having a few dollars that will help him after the baby was born… it was obvious what choice has won.
The first night Tony spent in the house, he spent it crashed in the bedroom on the first floor, not having enough strength to get up the stairs and go to the room he planned on being his. Despite the mild weather considering that autumn started, the house is freezing, and Tony burrowed into the sheets and bed, shivering at the coldness while wondering about the weather considering that it was warm this morning, but Tony shook it off, thinking that it was just moving jitters.
"What? Why the fuck will you give him the serum if his chance of survival is this slim? Are you crazy? Do you realize how much he is hurting now?" Bucky screamed, nearly attacking Howard if it wasn't for Natasha pulling him away this time, giving him a harsh look that ordered him to calm down.
"So what, you are telling me that he can see the future? A lot of people can see the future, he is not a special snow flack, Thor, he is just a normal, crazy bastard like all other people out there." Tony walked to Steven, frowning when his eyes fell on the man's face that was scrunched with pain.
Tony doesn't know how long it took him to hail a taxi and drive toward the building that Sam Wilson was in, his heart was pounding so loudly in his chest that Tony feared it will rip out of his chest any minute now when Tony reached the building and paid the driver fee while tipping him for driving him here in record time.
In the end, Anthony agreed, his heart was pounding in his chest when he returned that day when he told Steve, the Omega had looked at him with a shock then a small smile taking over his beautiful face, the Omega had hugged him and kissed him, telling him how proud of him he was, how he could do it, Anthony's heart flutter in his chest.
Gamora told him that Asgard wouldn't stand a chance against Thanos any longer, that in a day or two, Asgard would be wiped completely from this realm; Thor seemed to know that, as well as his mother, which was why they came in contact with the guardians, in hope of the guardians being able to extract Steve from Midgard and hide him away. The two of them took that risky plan in hope of Thanos leaving Midgard alone after learning that the Ancient One was no longer in this realm, it would also give Midgard three months to prepare to evacuate earth if something went wrong.
"This is not moving on, sweetheart…" Steve whispered as he kissed the back of the Omega's head, making tears that Tony tried to hold in, to trickle down his face as he shook his head, which only succeeded in making the Alpha shush him gently. "Baby, this is running away! Trying to destroy the last link you had with your baby, just so that you will forget him, this is not you, Tony, this is not you, sweetheart." A sob left Tony at that as he tried to control his breathing, trying to stop crying.
"Shit… you made them angry…" Tony laughed nervously as he looked around, he can already feel the anger Steve and Serpentine were emitting in the room, slowly but surely, Tony slide down his chair, waving goodbye to Fury (It could be the last time he sees the man alive) before hiding under the table, kicking out the idiot PR member who thought hiding in Tony's hideout was a good idea… it was then that the screams started…
Tony didn't know what was special with the tree he leaned on, it was like any other tree colored red, yellow, and brown like any other tree in the fall season, but Tony was tired, and he ends up sitting on the ground under the tree his legs too shaky to even keep him up anymore.
It was only a few seconds of walking before the Alpha finally spotted Tony, and his heart pounded with happiness as he rushed toward the Omega, hoping to explain to him and tell him that he was sorry for what he had been forced to hear, that they would find a way to solve the problem, and that Stane wouldn't leave unscathed. Before the Alpha opened his mouth though, the Omega whirled around until he was facing him with wild eyes, making the blond take a step back; fear rose inside of him at the look he was getting, the hair on his body tensed when the Omega's eyes connected with his and he saw the dark glee in them.
Steven couldn't help but smile at the way Tony's face split into a grin at something Jarvis said, all the while Peggy looked at Steven who was playing with his wedding ring and looking at Tony with sad but gentle eyes when the realization hit her, she had to use all of her spy training not to let her jaw fall at that…
Part of Anton wanted to ignore the Omega, to open the door and walk away without giving the Omega a glance, another part of Anton wanted to open the door, pulling the Omega inside and scream at him about how stupid and foolish he was, to accept marrying a child that couldn't provide for the Omega or his son, a child that could have been the Omega's own pup had the Omega married from a young age. Another knock on the door, followed by the voice of the Omega caused Anton to grit his teeth, licking the blood from his lower lip he decided to open the door, if this all blows up and ended with a shouting match it wouldn't be the first time, nor would it be the last if the Omega continued in his foolish path. "What?" Anton gritted through his teeth, gazing at the Omega who was raising his brow at him like he was an idiot.
Hearing the word 'Addams' made everyone freeze in place, and Tony's eyes widened at that if that was even possible. "Wait! Addams? You meant like those creepy people who live in creepy mansions near the graves and are more of scary demons than actual people?" Clint asked, and if Tony could move, he would have clapped his hands for Clint because that was exactly what he thought about… but Rogers doesn't even look like an Addams! He didn't have the dark hair or the olive skin the Addams are known to possess, so what the hell?
"She was a mean lady." James peeped which made the Omega sigh at that and gave his babe a look, telling him to stop, he doesn't want the Alpha to lash if the woman was a family. "She said a lot of mean things before she left us too." James not paying attention to Steven's warning said which made the Alpha narrow his eyes with hum at that, though he didn't do anything which made the Omega relax a little.
Steve opened his eyes then, looking around the room to confirm that he was alone before springing into action; thankfully, his wheelchair was beside his bed, so slipping into it was easy. In a matter of a few minutes, Steve was ready, and already wheeling himself away from his room, taking many different paths and making sure to avoid his usual nurses and doctors so he would manage to slip.
Since when did the man knew Steve's name? Steve was sure as hell he hadn't exchanged names with this strange Beta, he was sure he never met him before, so how? How does this man knew Steve's name? Fear and panic sized Steve as he gazed at the older Beta in front of him, wondering if he should run away or call Bucky before it became nasty. "I… I don't know what you are talking about…" Steve whispered, wondering if Bucky would rush to him fast if he screamed.
"Tony!" Peter's squeals as he ran toward him, which made Tony give a happy chuckle and kneel on the ground, pulling Peter in his embrace when Peter finally reached him, getting a giggle from the little boy as he cuddled him in his embrace giving him kisses all over his face, which caused Peter to let out happy noises, to inform Tony that he was happy, which made Tony's heart warm up and flutter in his chest.
"Dear boy, did I teach you nothing in all those years under me?" Howard hummed his eyes sharp as they trailed after Morgan; Morgan let out a whine as she finally started waking up from her nap. "It's better to give the prey a sense of security, I always say." Tony's eyes trailed on Howard, taking in how his father's eyes became dark. That was Tony's cue, as he started running like hell, running up toward the stairs and trying to outrun Howard.
"God, you are really an angel; an angel your idiot husband doesn't deserve." Natasha grumbled to herself as she took a sip from her coffee. "
"OK… yeah, let's do it." Tony smiled in the end, shushing his girl when she started to get fussy and whiny. In the end, Tony knew that he had to choose, and his choice will always be protecting his girl from whoever wanted to harm her, be it Stane and his father, or this strange town with the strange monster that lived in the lake.
Antonette was beautiful with her curled black hair, and her teal eyes, with her milky skin, she was smart, as smart as his Anton and liked to study everything new that her hands fell on, but unfortunately, that was not what her parents want for her, her father was the lowest of the low, that only cared about getting into the high-class, so he forced her to marry a complete stranger, she was young, a child, only thirteen, younger than Tonton when he died, but her father may have killed her with his betrayal.
"There is a way to make this right. I know you, Howard, so please, if you have a way to make this right, maybe this is the time. Do you not wish to mend the broken bridges you burned years ago? Howard, where are you going?" snapped Jarvis when he saw his friend turn around walking away from the scene in front of him.
A scream behind him made him turn to look at Peggy who was looking at the Omega with horror, she was trying to run inside the room, but Natasha was holding her back. "Natalia, take her away!" Snapped Steve making Natasha who was looking at the Omega snap and tries to pull a thrashing Peggy out of the room, Steve sighs at that…
"'K, Mommy…" The boy said not turning from his toys, it made Steve smile a little and walk toward his son and picked him up which made the boy squeal in joy as Steve start tickling the little boy mercilessly, just hearing his baby's squeal and laughter made everything worth it in Steve's eyes.
Steve and Tony discuss how to tell the kids about the baby for a few more minutes before leaving the bed, taking turns showering before ordering takeout, not so surprisingly, the kids came running when they saw the delivery man stopping in front of their house, which informed Tony that the kids were not so secretly staking out the house. As always, dinner was a lively affair, with both Harley and Peter trying to steal as many slices of pizza as their stomachs can handle, which did nothing but made Tony concern about sick children come tomorrow.
"Tony, please put that alien down!" Howard said which made Tony blink at his father's words, and he turns to his father while holding the cat looking at his father with an unimpressed voice, it's just a cat. "Tony! Don't point that thing at someone, Steve! Do something to stop your demon!" Howard screamed as he hides behind Steve, who was laughing his ass off at everyone, to say the truth everyone was hiding behind Steve, only Jarvis was near Tony, and it was to steer Peter away from Tony who was holding the cat.
What is happening here? Is this real? Is Bucky really innocent all along or is there something fishy going on here?
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! Tell me why Stevie went and destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. with his Ma; they will never do something like that!" Bucky, poor, poor Bucky stood up from his place with shock on his face; if only that poor, poor bastard knew what his precious Addams were capable of, Tony wondered what would Bucky think of them if he was stuck for an hour and a half in a massacre ground full of bodies and screaming agents that turned into cursed dolls.
"Well, wasn't that an interesting choice for a wedding song," Steve murmured as he took Tony's hands in his, a dark grin taking over him, and Tony was 200% sure that Steve was imagining Tony coming after him with a knife, which Tony did a couple of times before they got engaged, and no doubt it excited Steve; because only Steve would get excited by Tony running after him with a knife.
It started with someone running fast, the road was deserted a little considering that it was early in the morning, it ends with Anthony panicking and hitting the breaks hard, but it was not fast enough as the car hit that person who runs in front of him, Anthony could remember how his heart nearly stop in his chest as he felt the loud sound of something getting hit, he remember rushing out of the car, heart in his throat fearing that he hurt the person on the other side, or worse that he killed him when Anthony reached the person lying on the ground looking at the sky, he nearly let out a whine as he realized that he hurt not only a child that could be in his fifteen but an Omega at that, a small Omega who was blinking dizzyingly at the sky.
Everyone was having fun, and Tony made sure of that, even his father seemed more relaxed as he exchanged stories with everyone and answering their questions about how Malibu was. Tony was happy that his father was finally reconnecting with everyone, on the other hand, Tony doesn't know what to do about his father and Steve's mother becoming rivals for the competition of who will gain the title of the most amazing grandparent, it was scary seeing the two of them glaring at each other and competing for Peter's attention.
It made Steven's eyes darken at the thought of the king sending his son to spy on him, and the Omega wanted to head toward where the king was and scream at him, scream at him for being a cruel person, a bad father, and a heartless monster, Steven has so much more he wanted to scream at the man for, for what he did to Steven and his friends, but the Omega gathered himself and let out a sigh, taking a gentle hold of the small pup and standing up planning to return the pup to his room.
"Good." Tony said after he finished chowing and swallowing the food, feeling more relaxed than he did last night, which was kinda strange considering that he doesn't remember how he slept on the floor when he was sure he went to sleep on his bed. "It was calm; though my back hurts a lot, probably need to change the mattress." Tony justified his sleeping on the floor, is that the bed was bad enough that the brunette decided the floor is nicer than spending a second too long on it. "It was cold too…" Tony grumbled which made Natasha paused and shook her head.
"I will leave you two to talk, shout if you need anything," Natasha stated before giving them a nod, leaving the living room as she disappeared to God knows were; the living room was silent after Natasha left, leaving the two men festering in the awkwardness before Bucky finally decided to be the brave one and break the silence.
The doctors wanted him sedated and drugged so he wouldn't be a danger to himself, like the many time he did after waking; trying to run away and move his useless body and fall of the bed more than once. They wanted him to go through tests after tests to see what made his brain tick. The last thing Steve heard was Bucky nearly starting a fight with one of the doctors that insisted Steve was still in a coma of sort and that he may never recover if Bucky didn't force his memories to come by using his Alpha voice. The last thing Steve heard from Peggy (Who still comes daily to update him about everything going outside, trying not only to communicate with him but hoping to make him remember his real-life… or so she thinks) was that Steve was going to start his physical therapy soon as well as his sessions with a trauma therapist.
"Are you OK?" Peggy asked with a worry in her voice, which made Steve crack his eyes open then groan and curse under his breath…
"You will get used to it Clint, after all, it's not every day that you get your atoms ripped off and then attached once again." Steven said as he stretched himself and then he took Edith from his pocket with a small smile, wearing the glass and see how it activated the second he did it, Steven really missed the AI, but sadly he couldn't use it when he was on Asgard, least something happened to her.
"I… the pup called me Cap… he said when he saw me 'You are here'… he acted like he knew me." Steve stuttered making the doctor pause at that with a frown.
The trip back to earth was silent and thankfully not that bad as their first trip to Asgard, Clint didn't throw up on Thor's boots this time so everyone counted it as a win. It had been nearly two weeks since they went to stay in Asgard, in those two weeks they learn so much more about Asgard and about Steven, who was still considered a mystery to everyone, but what they heard from Steven about their dark future made everyone shiver and pause, hoping that since Steven was here now, he will right the wrong everyone claimed will take a place in the future.
"He is working aboard; Mommy said he is the best inventor in the whole world, even better than you." The pup said which made Tony's lips twitch up a little at that, an inventor better than him? That should be interesting.
"Because she died at birth." These five words caused Tony's heart to still in his chest, his breath left him in a rush as he gazed at Fury with disbelieving eyes, his lips trembling at the dark image of his words being true. "She died; everyone knew that, especially when the bullet wound was clear for everyone to see…" Fury trailed off when he saw how pale Tony was becoming; it took a few minutes before Tony finally managed to calm down, holding tightly to Morgan as he tried to reign himself. "We didn't know what to say or do. It was then that Rogers did something; no one knows how, or what he did, but he managed to bring back your baby… no one saw Rogers after that day, even when Barnes and Carter went to talk to him, it was like he… disappeared." Tony took a shuddered breath as he tried to wrap his mind around what Fury told him, knowing deep down where Rogers went to and what he did since he disappeared.
"As a matter of fact, I do!" Steven said sarcastically as he sat up and looked at that metal thing, which made it tilt its head waiting. "You see there, that dark sky?" Steven said as he pointed to the sky. "He was floating in space wanting to return to his own body after a decade of refusing to be in it, but this…" Steven said taking the necklace with the glowing blue stone that refused to be taken off no matter how much Steven tugged. "Slammed into him, cutting him from 'His brooding hour' as you put it and made him fall into this wasteland with a creature made of metal, breaking his leg in the process!" Steven snarled which made the creature take a step back away from him, which made Steven take a sick pleasure in that.
"It was Johann's…" Steven finally admits which caused the Beta's eyes to widen all the strength seemed to leave her as she gazed at her hands helplessly. "That foolish king could not touch me even if he tried which he did not, though, from what I have heard around, The Iron King is the kind of person who will kill anyone who takes pleasure from another without consent, charming is it not?" Steven informed Margaret, he can see the tears sliding down Margaret's face, and he felt more helpless than he did before when they didn't stop.
"What time is it J?" Tony asked as he put the rag in the stool going to the sink in the lab to wash his hands from the grease and dirt, waving to Peter to come and wash his hands which the pup did with a skip in his steps.
Tony hummed as he walked toward his favorite bakery, planning on surprising both Steve and Peter with something sweet today. Tony knows he should be back working, but meh, it wasn't like Tony didn't own SI, and if Tony wanted he could just retire any time he wanted and be a house Omega if he liked. But Tony wasn't like that, he loves his job, and love terrorizing the people working under him, besides if his father heard about him retiring, the man will probably think Tony was expecting and will cry in joy… which was an idea that Tony couldn't keep his mind off.
"No!" Tony screamed in terror, his heart hammering in his throat the thought of Stane and his father finding him and doing this sick joke, made his breath fasten even more. He scrambles off the bed, his socked feet slipping on the floorboards, and stumbles over to the kitchen, he was thankful that he didn't fall and hurt the baby. It's too dark to see clearly, and he slams into the wall, still unused to moving about in the new space that was his home. On the kitchen counter, there were some supplies he picked up in town planning to do some fixing of his own, and he fumbles blindly through them, knocking over the jar of instant coffee and sending the saw to the floor with a loud clatter. To Tony's horror the thing that was under the floorboard, shifting back and forth beneath Tony's feet. Which made Tony stamps his foot and swears his hand closing around the smooth wooden handle of a claw hammer.
Tony sigh tiredly when his girl whine and start moving her arms in an angry fashion; his girl wasn't hungry, she doesn't need a change, she wasn't tired and need sleep, Tony met all of her needs an hour ago when she woke up from her bed with a mighty cry. If his baby doesn't need any of the above, that what does she want? It wasn't like Tony wasn't trying to understand her; he was a minute away from calling Jane or Bruce, wondering if his baby was sick.
When he hit his six months sober mark, his friends surprised him with a party, everyone hugged him telling him how proud they were of him, he saw his father that day, his father who hugged him and refused to let him go, telling him over and over again how sorry he was, and how proud of him he was, and that he was finally opening his eyes, and saw how wrong he was all alone, how he saw what Stane was after all alone, he was told that Stane was finally out of their lives, Tony cried that night, holding his father, he never felt this close to his father since his mother's death. It ends up with SI changing its detraction from war into clean energy; Tony was never proud of working with his father as he did now.
Because Steve and his Ma were driving Tony crazy, Tony started driving Pepper crazy, which caused Pepper to through her high heels at Tony's head and ordered him to meditate or do yoga if he was
"Blue is really your color, it brings out your eyes." Steve answered him with a proud grin, causing the Alpha to give a small smile, and it was the first time that Steve saw the Alpha smiled ever since he starts living with them which made Steve a little proud of himself. "Say what, why don't we go to the barbershop we saw on the second floor, after that, we are going to the food court." Steve grinned as he held Bucky's arm in his, and start dragging him to the cashier, he wondered if they also have delivering serves, for Steve was sure he had bought half of their shop.
"What happened?" Thor asked in such a young voice it made Steven press his lips hard, for even if the Asgardian before him was deemed a man to the ancient being in other realms, he was still in fact just a youngling in Steven's world, a youngling just like his brother need guiding.
God, how much Tony wanted to sigh like an Omega in love, not like he wasn't, oh he was, he defiantly was. At first Tony expected to fall in love with Steve to be all firework and fire like he normally heard from the Omegas back when he was at MIT, he even fantasied a few times about being in love when he was a teen…
"OK baby, so you want a Pete story? I will tell a Pete story." Tony sniffed lying next to his son, hugging him. "So where to start… oh! I know… so one day before Captain went on a big mission to save the world and fight the evil Red Skull… he gave Mama a seed and told him to take care of it…" Tony pauses a little and gazes at his son who scrunches his nose when he stopped making Tony sighs at that returning to the story. "Mama did what Captain said and took care of the seed, day and night until one day Mama came to take care of the seed and saw a baby instead, because you see the seed was special it gives the person who takes care of it a beautiful baby, so Mama took the baby and decided to name him Peter…" An 'A' for the originality and being able to think of the story in the spot, his son didn't complain so Tony took that as a good sign.
Anton will greet him like this every time he saw him, playing his games even when he couldn't see him, only his light.
"… and then Ned nearly throw up in the bushes!" Peter babbled gaining a nod from Tony who was covering containers of food and putting them in the fridge as the excited birthday boy continued to talk about his say. "....Harley was so angry, Mama, he kept saying that he was waiting until the clock ticks twelve before he pulls my ear off for throwing the pie at his face." That gained a wince from Tony as he still remembered how Harley had screamed bloody murder as his face was cover in wiped cream from the pie.
"Do you want to adopt him?" Tony questioned, wonder painting his voice. Tony knows that if Steve and Peter were already feeling this attached to Harley, then they were possibly thinking about adopting him into their pack; probably they couldn't do it, considering that Tony as the Omega of the house has more say than both of them.
The next time Tony opened his eyes, he was surrounded by the team, aunt Peggy was looking at him with happy tears in her eyes, Bucky was in the back looking at his with guilty look, the Hulk and Thor were both there too, but Tony could only look at the sky and let out a laugh, his prayers were answered…
"Thor can we please get this over with, I don't want to be in Odin's presence more than necessary." Steven said coolly which made Thor pause and look at Steven with surprise and a little bit of confusion. "You will know everything when we reach Asgard." Steven said which made Thor nod his head and clear his throat and call out for the guardian of the gate, Steven sighed at that, this was going to be a long day, though on the bright sight…
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, Tony can't helping but being a little shit, Steve will scream his head off, while Thor will have a heart attack! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Steve… are you staying with Master Anthony just because of the guilt you feel?" Jarvis asked slowly looking at Steve with a hard look, Steve, on the other hand, was furrowing his brows thinking.
"Oh… hey, Mama…" Peter laughed nervously, an innocent smile on his face while gazing at Tony with wide puppy-dog eyes, hoping that Tony would give in and let him continue wasting his time; Tony only raised his eyebrow, his lips twitching down when he saw how rumbled Peter's clothes were, they were so messy that Tony wondered if the shirt Peter was wearing was the same one that Tony spent his morning cleaning and ironing.
His mother's snappish voice made Steve's lips twitch up when it was followed by more grumble of his grandma, Morticia, and Gomez wishing him luck before dragging his grandma away or locking her away, he doesn't know, for he can't hear any noises other than his Ma's grumbling about old hags.
"Nothing…" Steve whispered after the broke the kiss, looking at the Alpha with adoring eyes. "Just thinking about how much I love you." Steve said which made the Alpha's eyes sparkle in happiness.
Steve's heart hurt at the thought of losing Tony, seeing him standing there in front of him, Steve could only remember the times that Tony was taking away from him constantly. Tony was a mortal, Tony was going to die sooner or later, leaving Steve alone once more; that was the truth that Steve lived with and would continue to live with for the rest of his life. The thing was Steve doesn't want to shorten Tony's lifespan more than he already did, if Thanos was after him, then he was after Midgard, and by default, he was after the Avengers, his family… Steve knew that Tony would do anything to protect him, even if he was stupid enough to sacrifice his life, something that Steve would never allow, especially when Tony had Peter to think of. "Tony…" Steve stood up, taking Tony's hand in his gently, tightening them on the gauntlet of Tony's suit.
"Are you sure you don't want a sparring partner?" The voice coming from behind Steven made him pause in his punches and turn to Peggy, who was looking at him thoughtfully, making the blond press his lips tightly as he gazes at the destroyed punching bags that were lying on the ground. "I'm tougher than I look," Peggy with a teasing smile, getting inside the boxing ring and taking a stand making Steve shake his head and follow her.
"Oh, I don't know your family? Your intentions with my baby? Your past relationships? I will even tell you about me and Joseph if you want! I am sure you will enjoy this story, Steve loves it every time, especially when I reach the part when I kill his father." Serpentine giggled, causing Tony to choke on his ice cream and start coughing like no tomorrow, she did what? She killed her husband? Is she for real? Is this what Steve will do to him when they get married?! "Don't worry! We were already divorced by then; after all, no one raises their hand on their spouse without heavy consequences, especially if one of the spouses was an Addams." Serpentine stated, patting Tony's back gently until his coughing stopped and he could finally breathe.
Tony smiled as he saw all the children eating breakfast, the screams and squeals were heard inside of the dining hall, but it was happy sounds, Tony gave a nod to the other workers and volunteers, smiling at the children and waving to them before heading toward Darcy, knowing that the woman was going to eat him alive if he didn't tell her what she wanted to know.
It was when it turned midnight and the Alpha didn't show that Tony start worrying, after all, by this time all four of them, Steve, Tony, Peter, and Goose, would have been already in deep sleep in their places, enjoying a full night of uninterrupted sleep, but the Alpha didn't show, even when the clock ticked away until it was midnight, and Tony was worried, he was so worried about why the Alpha wasn't here, and why he didn't even call him to inform him that he will stay away for a little longer.
"You don't look that much fond of me, son of Sarah." Odin said off-handedly which made Steven snort at that rudely which made Frigga look away from her husband a small smile taking over her face, at how red the man's face becomes, she was happy that someone was able to take her husband down a few pages.
It’s not his birthday — that’s still four months away — nor is it near any of the other Avengers’ birthdays. The next one is Hank’s, and while the two of them were good friends, Steve sincerely doubts that Hank wants a cake based on his likeness. So not that.
“Looking for something, Captain?” Jarvis asks as he enters the kitchen, carrying assorted dishes to the sink.
“Sundown at the Atlas it is!” Tony reached into his inner pocket and procured his flask. Steve shot him a disapproving look. “...It’s not sundown yet.” He brought it to his lips, frowning when nothing came out. “And as luck would have it, it’s empty. How disappointing.”
“Not even a swarm of bullets or the entire Wrecking Crew could keep me from breaking it. And you did hold your end of our deal today, so it’s like you said, it’s the least I can do,” Steve said, his voice sweet and sincere. “Even if you do wrongfully manipulate the time of your town’s law enforcement.”
But even so, it’s only been four months since he and Tony started dating. Not exactly a milestone mark worthy of celebrating, especially when they didn’t do anything for months two and three.
Tony heard the gunshot, but strangely enough he felt no pain. He didn’t feel anything at all. Opening his eyes, Tony looked up to see a small stream of smoke coming from Steve’s gun and the robber clutching his now bloody hand, his own gun on the floor by Steve’s feet.
“For your sake, he better.” The purple-masked man -- Wrecker -- turned to his other two lackeys, nudging them forward. “Go on now, get ‘im.”
It’s a photo he remembers taking all too well, on this very day, seven years prior. It was the first photo he’d taken in decades, and with the people that would become his team. His family. His home. It’s been cropped from the larger, original photo so it’s only him and Tony, or rather, him Shellhead, the armored Avenger’s arm securely wrapped around his shoulder. There’s a Sharpie-red heart drawn around the two of them, and when Steve flips it over, he finds a small note written in that same bright red ink:
“Gah!” Wrecker cried and fell to the ground, his gun skidding across the wooden floor. “Piledriver, this is all your fault! You went and led us right to the damn town Sheriff!”
of nasty names — but maybe that had to do with the person saying it and the underlying hurt in the way he said it.
“Don’t have to tell me twice.” Steve took a gentle hold of Tony’s chin and tilted his head upward. He leaned in, colliding their lips together in a soft, sweet kiss, which Tony gleefully returned.
“To some, I reckon,” Tony said, shrugging his shoulders. “You gonna throw me in jail and throw away the key?”
The lone server ceased his conversation and approached Tony and Steve, greeting them with a smile that was a little too enthusiastic. It was pretty common for the Atlas to go days without having a customer, so the man was probably elated to have not one table to serve, but two!
“What about it?” Tony repeats, glaring at Steve as if he just said the most ludicrous sentence imaginable. “You come home with a massive scar and you don’t think that’s something you should tell me about? I’m a doctor!”
“Alright, looks like we’ve got ourselves a deal,” Steve said, grinning a little. “How's about sundown at the Atlas, then?”
“No,” Steve responded immediately, and Tony huffed in disappointment. “But maybe there’s something else I can do for ya that’s just as good? Somethin' long overdue?”
“First things first, you need kisses,” Tony says, tracing his finger along Steve’s lower lip. “And lots of them.”
Tony stared in sheer awe, his heart pounding against his chest. Good lord, Steve just shot a man for him! It wasn’t the first time he’d done done it -- and it certainly wouldn’t be the last -- but damn, it never got old.
He very well could have swung by the Sheriff’s office for a visit, asked him about how his investigating of the not so mysterious lynchings was going, maybe even made some polite conversation while he stared into those pretty blue eyes.
“Yeah, and the competition is still pretty steep,” Tony jokes, visibly trying -- and failing -- to hold in a giggle. “And if you wanna stay the favorite, you better make sure you follow my treatment plan.”
“Right this way, gentlemen, only the finest table for our own Sheriff and our own…uh, Mr. Stark,” The server said, leading them to a candle-lit table in the back corner, nice and cozy and private. Not that privacy was hard to come by in this place.
Had Tony not just downed an entire flask of whiskey, he might’ve been clever enough to choose the former.
Tony makes a small noise into Steve’s back that sounds like a laugh, and he burrows his face in further into Steve’s cotton t-shirt. “Still mad at you.”
Steve’s prepared for a multitude of different reactions — tears, cussing, things being thrown at him. He’ll take it all, and deservedly so.
Slowly, Tony lowered one of his hands and reached into his inner pocket for what little money he had on him. Just enough to cover dinner for two. But as he was about to grab a hold of the small coin sack, Steve reached across the table and grabbed his hand.
But Steve can’t exactly blame him. Tony’s a genius, so of course he knows that Steve forgot all about their special day. Whatever it is. The temptation to lie and play it off like he’s just as prepared for today as Tony is crosses his mind, but it just feels wrong. Steve knows he has to come clean.
Grabbing the cuffs from his belt, Steve clicked them over the Wrecker’s wrists and escorted him out of the restaurant. He left the incapacitated three behind, at least for now, but he also lef Tony, who was still cowering under the table.
Steve stared at his own glass, drumming his fingers against the side of it. “You sure do know an awful lot about silverware,” He said, breaking the brief and slightly uncomfortable silence. “And with your fancy dress, makes me think that dinin’ like this is relatively common for you.”
“Well, if you’re mad at me--” Steve grabs Tony’s hands and gently removes them from his chest. “--I guess that means no more cuddles." A somewhat cruel ultimatum for both of them, as they've been devoid of cuddles for three long lonely days, but Tony's not talking and Steve
“Take you on and win,” Steve corrected, lifting the not so fearless leader of the crew up and restraining his arms behind his back. “Looks like your days of ‘wrecking’ have come to an end, partner. And nobody else move! I’ll be back for the rest of you.”
“Tony, get under the table, now!” Steve ordered, and Tony didn't have to be told twice. He jumped out of his seat and under the table, catching the attention of the smaller of the two lackeys. The man smirked, cocking his gun and pointing it right at Tony.
Steve’s cheeks turned a little pink, and Tony immediately panicked. Was that too bold? It felt a little too strong, maybe more than Steve was bargaining for tonight. Chewing down on his lower lip, Tony opened his mouth to correct his little blunder, but stopped when he saw Steve’s lips curl up into a smile. It was big, bright, easily the most genuine smile Tony had ever seen on him.
That leaves an anniversary. His breath stills and his eyes go wide. Oh god, did he forget? Panicking, he slams the fridge door shut and scans the calendar hanging on the front of it. He heaves out a relieved sigh when he sees the date — the tenth, aka,
The two lackeys nodded, moving toward Tony and keeping their guns raised. “Cough up the loot, money bags, whatever you got.”
And more importantly, Tony knows it too. He snorts loudly and smirks up at Steve. “Sap.” The warmth then abruptly drains out of Tony’s expression and he bites down on his lower lip. “You mean it, right? You’ll always come home? That’s a promise?”
And whatever he’s writing is making him smile in a coy and cute fashion, like a lovestruck teenager doodling their crush’s name on a notebook. Steve loves when Tony smiles at him, but there’s something extra special about the way Tony smiles when he’s alone. Shields down and out of his armor, both the literal and the figurative.
Tony had wanted to stay and wait up for Steve, but the chef, understandably so, insisted that they vacate the space and company of three notorious bandits. And really, Tony couldn’t argue with that.
Steve inhaled deeply. “Alright, fine, fair is fair. But just a quick one, and don’t you go tellin’ no one about this, ya hear?”
Steve frowns. He opens his mouth to speak, but Tony hands over what he’s been hiding — what he’d been smiling at — before Steve can get a word out. It’s a folded piece of paper with Steve’s name on it.
But Steve doesn’t think it’s ridiculous...even though, yeah, it kind of is. He’s a super-soldier for crying out loud, and he’s come home with far worse injuries than this. No, all Steve can think is how lucky he is to have someone in his life that cares so deeply about him. His beloved, sweet, and slightly melodramatic Tony.
He heaved out a heavy sigh, burrowing his face into his pillow. How would it sound, he wondered to himself, closing his eyes and trying to envision it.
“I’m fine, really,” Steve insists. “I didn’t think it was that big of a deal because it’s not hurting me.”
“No, well, at least not until we have dessert. It’d be a shame to waste a perfectly good slice of pie.” Steve chuckled, his eyes locking onto Tony’s. “I’m glad you agreed to come out tonight, Tony. And I’m especially glad that I got to see this side of you, the ‘fancy’ one. He’s a nice feller, and I hope I get to see more of him.”
Tony’s grin morphed into a frown and he bit his lip, shifting a little his seat. It was true, of course, but the word ‘addict’ just sounded so...harsh. Far worse than any insult he’s been called over the years — and he’s been called
“Alright now, we’re gonna make this nice and easy for all of--” The tall one in a purple mask began before pausing, his eyes scanning the near empty restaurant. “--seriously?
“You have my word,” Tony blurted out before his drunken brain could properly properly register what he’d promised.
What he’s not prepared for is Tony to smile at him, sweetly, and with a look of sheer adoration in his eye. “You’re far too humble, you know that? If I had a second birthday, aka, another excuse for presents and everyone to fawn over me, I’d take full advantage of it.”
Jan, the unofficial planner of any and all Mansion parties, didn’t mention anything about a shindig today. And she usually had the decency to give Steve ample notice to put together, in her words, “an outfit that isn’t thirty years out of style”. So it couldn’t be that either.
Tony blushed, taking off his top hat and hiding it behind his back. So much for off to a good start.
“...I think you’re the first person that’s ever got himself locked in the pillory without actually breakin’ the law, Stark,” Steve said, kneeling down so he was eye level with Tony, an incredulous look on his face. “Do I even wanna ask how you did it?”
“War changes a lot of people. Sometimes for better, sometimes for worse,” Steve said softly. “I'm just please it changed you for the better.”
Steve’s eyes well up with tears and his hand trembles as he stares at the photo. As he stares, he sees not only the frozen moment in time, but seven years worth of memories. Beautiful, wonderful memories, all starting on this exact day, all starting with Tony.
“Hey, I’m just glad I won’t have to eat a whole cake by myself. My tailor will be glad, too.” Tony chuckles before he smiles brightly. “Happy March 10th, Steve.”
Still, he obliged to their demands, raising his hands above his head. Steve did the same, but not without a stubborn scowl on his face and a curious look in his eye. Tony knew that look well; he was plotting something.
“Wouldn’t dream of it, sir.” Jarvis smiles back, but Steve senses that his is also forced. Honest old Cap never was a good liar. “Now, would you like a slice to go with your milk?”
“Fine,” Tony concedes and he pulls back, looking Steve square in the eye. “When were you planning on telling me about
Aiming their guns, they both fired countless shots at him. Glass shattered and bullets bounced off the walls, but none landing on their intended target. Steve boldly -- and somewhat stupidly -- charged right at them, in true Sheriff Rogers fashion. He swiftly dodged each bullet that came his way, and once in a close enough range, he aimed not for their heads but for their knees, landing both shots with only two bullets. An amateur slinger, he was not.
“You sure about that?” Steve asked, and in the blink of an eye, he was on his feet and grabbed the barrel of the robber’s gun. He snatched it, flipping it over in his palm and aiming it at the robber's head.
“And can I interest either of you men in a drink?” The server asked, looking right at Tony ostentatiously.
After fussing with his appearance for a good hour or so, he headed down to the restaurant. He caught sight of Steve as he approached, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. Upon seeing Tony, Steve stood upright and grinned.
“No, thank you, I couldn’t possibly cut the cake without Tony,” Steve declines. “Speaking of which, have you seen him?”
There’s a cake in the fridge. It’s beautiful, at least three layers high, and with an intricate red, white, and blue frosting pattern that perfectly emulates a certain shield. It’s very obvious that it’s for Steve. But why?
“Hey, it’s alright, it’s—“ Tony pauses. “—wait, how did you know I’ve been celebrating this day every year?”
Tony scoffed. “I’d hardly call this a change for the better. Do you not recall how I locked myself in the pillory this afternoon?”
“No need to be embarrassed, Stark, you clean up nice,” Steve encouraged, turning to open the door to the restaurant. “Shall we?”
"OK… that was interesting!" Serpentine grins darkly, wondering what kind of torture Steve made his friends go through; the ghost couldn't be prouder than she already was, her baby was making his mark on the world, in the biggest way possible! She wonders what his kids are going to be like, and hope desperately they won't be blessed with that awful blond hair and sparkly blue eyes like their father (She still blame Joseph Rogers for her son's look, but he paid for it dearly… with his life) even when her baby grow up to be a beautiful kind of murderous ghost that represent the Winter season.
"So you are the Scarlet Witch?" Nebula stated more than asked, distaste coloring both her voice and features, sidestepping the table that was thrown at her by the enrage witch that was glaring and growling like a while beast; truly a pitiful sight, Nebula wondered what Thanos saw in this weak female that he demanded Nebula to recruit her, it was probably because she performed a forbidden spell thought to be forgotten to turn the Golden Bride into a human, even if temporarily.
His husband surges against him with a particularly vicious thrust, but Tony feels nothing but love, love, love as Steve made him orgasm. Steve's knot slipped in and it's like a sigh of relief as Tony's body stretches to accommodate it, and when Steve bit his gland, Tony couldn't help but give a wake moan as another orgasm wracked him.
J.A.R.V.I.S.'s voice made Tony blink his eyes and let out something between a whimper and a choke, wondering when did Rhodey arrive here; Tony sure as hell didn't call him. Though on the bright side, Tony rejoices that his best friend was finally home, and maybe will be able to save him from the craziness that seemed to happen around him. J.A.R.V.I.S the saint that he was seemed to have taking Tony's noises that resemble whale's dying as permission to let Rhodey in. And boy, oh boy, does Rhodey look like death warmed him over?
"Shut your yapping hole, arrogant Alpha, this realm does not stop for you no matter how much you order it!" Snapped the Omega back which made Jamti blink at that in shock looking at his friend to see that he was back to glaring at the Omega like he was some unpleasant creature he stumbled upon in his voyage, though the smirk on Loki's face as he eyed the Omega with interest stumped him, considering that the green eyes Alpha showed no interest in anyone…
, wait, Mr. Stark!" That was Steve who cried out and tried to rush after Tony, making Bucky squeak as he held onto Steve's mid-section trying to pull him back from going after the inventor.
"Who?" Steve asked part of him intrigued by the person who came to see him, managing to go through Natasha and gaining her permission in the end; that's something rarely happens, especially when Natasha and Sam were in an overprotective mood ever since that night two weeks ago. Natasha only tilted her head to the side, pointing at the door, causing Steve's eyes to widen when he saw Bucky standing near the door, nervously playing with his hands as he tried to look as calm as he can; what made Steve's jaw drop a little was the black eye dominating Bucky's left side, leaving him looking like he gets the left side of his face painted. "Bucky?" Steve asked in shock, wondering if he finally lost it and started seeing things.
The king's harsh words sport his people to action as they start pulling the servants and guards, ripping their left sleeves and gazed at their wrists, the sound of Margaret's snarl made Steven look at her, as she growled at the Alpha who pulled the small pup from her hands, she pushed him until the Viking let go of the pup, who then ran to Steven and clutch his skirt tightly. "
"I did not!" Peter said as he puffed his cheeks and cross his arms over his chest. "My school is out for a month because some idiot eighth graders decided to blow the labs at night, which burn half of the school." Peter said with a pout which made Tony blink at that and hummed.
"Stop it!" Someone cried out before the men attacked, and Steven turn his eyes only for them to widen when he saw the king's son run toward Steven and stand between him and the men while growling at them, Steven doesn't even know how to react when he saw the small pup, smaller than his babe, glaring at the man, daring them to take one step.
It took them two extra days to reach the land, and in those days, Steven made sure to spend talking and teaching his friends a little about what they to expect in his people's lands, not knowing if he will be granted the chance to meet them once again when they were finally inland, so Steven taught them about his people's ways, how to not offend them, how to deal with their currency, the kind of food they eat, they kind of people they have, how to just lower your head and ignore arrogant warriors, how to never ever walk alone in the village but in a pair of two, last someone got the idea that they can torment them because they were slaves of the Hydra king… all the while he taught his son what to do and how to clean something, how to rush to him or Margaret and their friends if something happened, thanking the Gods when his smart baby just nodded his head and took everything in.
"I was pregnant…" Angie whispered, her words freezing Tony, causing his breath to hitch. "One day, one day he took it too far that no painkillers could do the trick. I was bleeding heavily and when he finally took me to the hospital, I was informed that I had a miscarriage… I didn't even know I was pregnant, you know?" Angie took a shuddered breath and Tony, couldn't help but tighten his arms around his sleeping baby, his mind couldn't help but give him the horrifying image of him losing his baby the day his father beat him black and blue. "It was then that I decided that enough was enough and ran away, I don't know how, but I ended up here one day. Let me tell you something though, the town's people were still as foolish as they were back then, never telling anyone about Steven Rogers unless they had to; unlike you though, back then I didn't have it in me to play around and fool everyone while doing my research behind their backs, I went straight to Peggy and called her on her bullshit when Rogers killed my husband when he found me…" Angie stood in front of him, causing Tony to swallow as he tried to make sense of what Angie just told him. "You know, maybe –this is my theory- the town's people just wanted to forget that Rogers ever exist; I think they felt guilty for being the reason of his death as many didn't believe him when he accused Pierce of killing Peggy's sister, it was only after his death that people realized the grave mistake they made, and for them, protecting Rogers's existence is their way of asking for his forgiveness." These words made Tony swallow and look at Angie who turned around and start making tea.
So finally after going back and forth with himself and J.A.R.V.I.S. Tony accepted marrying Steve; mainly because that meant Tony won't die alone or get killed by anyone without Steve avenging him, another was because he really started to like Steve. Believe it or not, the man wasn't that bad when you get to know him; especially the protective side of him.
The Alpha couldn't wait for the next month, he couldn't wait four weeks to inform Peter that he was his real father and that he has missed him like he had missed a limb that was taken forcefully from him, just the thought of holding the small boy in his arms and for the boy to call him 'Daddy' made his heart nearly fly in joy, breaking the kiss, Tony dived for another one and another until the two of them left standing breathlessly in the kitchen, gazing at each other's eyes. "Thank you…" Tony finally gained his voice to whisper those words, which got him a gentle smile from his Omega… his, Steve was finally his… it made Tony wonder what his Omega will do when Tony informs him of the plan he had hatched years and years ago, will the Omega and his child come with him on a long-needed vacation if the two of them realized that Tony still kept the safe houses he bought for them, especially that house in Ireland the late Sarah Rogers always talked about, her family's house, that he was finally able to buy after he returns from Afghanistan, he wondered what Steve will do when Tony tell him about the house.
"I… I brought you something…" Howard said after passing Morgan to Sarah who tried to show Harley and Peter how to hold the baby. "I… I don't even know how to say it because it was so bizarre that I couldn't believe it myself…" Howard said, taking an envelope from his suit jacket and giving it to Tony, who held the envelope and turned it around a few times. "It's about Harley…" Howard continued in a whisper, so the boy in question wouldn't hear them.
“Four months from now.” He informed them, knowing that they had their doubts at how rushed all of this seems like, how it was only a year and a half in a relationship with a divorced Alpha who had a son, before deciding on marriage, but his friends ever the supportive, just joked about giving Steve the shovel talk, though, in Rhodey’s case, Tony knows that his best friend won’t rest until he gave Steve a piece of his mind. They spent the day catching up, joking, and celebrating, and when it was time to leave his friends objected, stating that Tony should stay in the Rhodes’ household, Tony didn’t even know how the small get together turned into a slumber party, but everyone was happy to sleep the night in the guest rooms.
"He is my son, of course, I will help my family; who are you to decide instead of me!" Tony snapped letting out a growl as he took a step toward Barnes, that display made Bucky smile and he hummed at that, snatching his phone from Tony before the Alpha destroys it.
Walking, Tony froze in front of the entrance to the living room, his breath hitching in his chest when he caught from the corner of his eyes someone sitting on the armchair. Turning around slowly, the breath rushed out of Tony's lungs, his eyes widen in terror when he notices who was sitting on the armchair making himself comfortable as he gazed around the room in boredom.
"Just as soon as we find where they are staying." Steven said as he starts walking, looking around the place hoping to spot someone familiar, his heart was pounding uncontrollably in his chest, especially when people stopped in their places and start gazing at him while whispering and pointing, and Steven wondered if he should return to the king's house, maybe demand that he be the one to escort him, which will probably get him a screaming match with the Alpha and the man refusing to let Steven leave the house again, so the Omega kept quiet and walked around, trying to push his fear and heartbreak in the back of his mind as he tried to search for someone from his friends.
The days after that trickled, uneasy at first, before the fear finally disappeared, leaving the family back to their normal lives, enjoying what's left of summer before welcoming autumn. And with autumn, came the fifth member of the Rogers family… a beautiful girl with dark brown hair and breath-taking blue eyes… a perfect mix between Steve and Tony.
One sob followed by another, and another, and another; Tony ended finding himself clutching Steve's hand and leaning on the bed, sobbing his heart out as he held tightly to Steve. Begging his love to not leave him, begging him to hang on, begging him to stay with him and Peter; Tony's body shuddered, breath ragged as he tried to get himself together, but saying that was easier than doing it.
As everyone knows, this story, the first part of my fairy tales series, if you have a fairy tale in mind and wanted me to write it, or request me to write you a spine of the fairy tale you love just PM me, and I would answer…
The sound of splashes made Tony blink his eyes and turn to the lake, his face soften when he saw a mistrusted blue eyes gazing at him. "Hello, Steven," Tony called out as he started walking to the deck, ignoring the angry hiss that Steven send his way, and who was going to blame him? Tony did leave him in the dead of night, not even a goodbye before taking Morgan and disappearing. "Are you angry at me Steven? You know I had to do it, Steven, I had to protect Morgan." Tony offered his words causing Steven to frown and looked at Tony's legs.
God, how much does Steve wanted to share this happy moment with his husband, but the problem is, his Alpha wasn't with him, his husband thinks that his job is more important than him and the baby if today was anything to go by, just thinking about that caused Steve to sobs even louder and he tried to calm himself down, looking at the doctor who was gazing at him with a worried look on her face. "Can I… can I please have this picture printed?" Steve asked as he wiped his tears off, trying to calm himself down.
So after two tiring and draining weeks, Steve finally told Fury that he wants Stane in the interrogation room, he felt he will be able to question Stane without bashing his head into the first hard surface he saw. Steve and Fury were in the room, with Steve sitting on one of the chairs and Fury standing behind him, looking at Steve every once in a while. "Ask what you want Fury…" Steve said with a tired voice making the young Alpha pause a little.
The change of position made the pup whine, but a few seconds later he hides his face in Steven's neck letting out a broken purr in happiness, making the Omega hum a little at that and start walking down the stairs, humming to the boy gentle as he headed to the said boy room, putting him in his bed before covering him with his furs, leaving the room and closing the door after.
"Is everything alright? What happened?" The sound of Braes broke both Steven and the king out of their staring match; it was only a few seconds after Braes showed up inside the room, the king rushed out, leaving the healer and Steven confuse about the king's reaction.
But everything starts changing two weeks later when he started feeling sick every morning, the first time it happened, he thought he caught a stomach bug, that it will go when time pass but after a month and a half? He knew something was wrong… in the end, he went and bought as many tests as he could, hoping against hope that he was wrong…
It wasn't until the doctor left that both Steve and Tony managed to snap out of their stupor, the two of them looking at each other before Tony went to set on the bed, his legs became too weak to hold him up. "Are you OK?" Steve asked after a few minutes, coming to sit beside Tony who leaned on him, his nose scrunched in deep thoughts. "What do you think?" Steve prompted Tony once more, trying to make him talk; his action only got him a blink from Tony before the Omega let a tired sigh.
Save for security, the residence is empty, if not hollow. Somehow, Tony notices how vacant this part of the White House is. “Must be lonely living here on your own.”
She hugs him tightly. “I love you, Tony. And believe me when I say that that won’t ever change.” She strokes the back of his neck. “I miss you sometimes, too.”
Cassie smiles even wider and dashes over her godfather to give him a hug. “Good to see you, Uncle Tones.”
With the television as background noise, Tony taps away on his tablet, making notes on various pieces of legislation that he has had to put on the backburner. On the surface, things are business as usual for the Democrats and their associates, but behind the curtains, the investigation had escalated from a small house party into a rager with an entire high school of uninvited guests, thanks to Fury’s and Coulson’s sudden interest in his team’s extra-curricular activities. With that and all the new information that’s been coming in, Tony hasn’t had any time or energy to deal with his actual, constitutionally bound duties as Speaker of the House.
The two nod concurrence and are dismissed, leaving Steve to his thoughts for a few moments. It’s going to get worse before it gets better, he thinks, but he knows that he can’t invest all his energy into this. There are still so many things to be done, so many problems to solve, and the American people will need a levelheaded president if they want to get through this budget crisis relatively unscathed.
If there is one thing that haunts Tony about his former life, it’s this—a pipedream that he had chased secretly for years, even well into his booming political career. He would do research and tinker even in his busiest and most stressful of times, something which he can’t afford to do anymore now that he’s Speaker of the House.
Steve stands, buttons his suit and extends his hand. “I appreciate you coming in, Mr. Speaker.” His tone is professional and detached, a far cry from his greeting some twenty minutes before.
Pepper arrives with Janet and Hank not ten minutes after the assistants do. Thor comes in booming and Wade trails behind him. Natasha arrives last, but most definitely not the least, and Clint is thankfully sober enough to function. They all start to congregate on the sofas the moment Kate announces that dinner is served.
Tony rubs the back of his neck, a little hesitant. “It’s an old project. I’m trying to miniaturize a theoretical design that could potentially produce unlimited clean energy. This is just the skeleton frame of the arc reactor.”
The Democrats gather around in an uneven circle, animated by the astounding legal developments of the day, all thanks to Jessica Drew’s explosive press conference earlier that morning. The excited murmuring dies down when Natasha raises her hand, drawing everyone’s attention to her.
“Don’t worry about it, I’ve taken up so much of your morning already. Thank you for taking my call.”
“I don’t understand why you Republicans have this incessant need to shove your beliefs down everyone’s throats. Most employees of religious hospitals and universities aren’t even Catholic, Hill. Religion is not the issue here. It’s women’s reproductive health, their right to choose for what’s best for their bodies, and it’s the government’s duty to provide women with all the possible options.”
