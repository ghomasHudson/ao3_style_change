“I must have missed the class where they said, ‘hey when you have anal sex make sure to hit the prostate ‘cause it feels amazing.’” John laughed, forgetting about the burning until Sherlock removed the finger and tried to add a third one. “Ahhh, no Sherlock that’s too much, wait ‘stop!’” the boys last word went up an octave as the man behind him worked the tips of three fingers into his small hole. He began to squirm and whimper, but Sherlock pressed his chest to John’s back, holding him in place and thrusting his fingers in time with his cock on the boy’s leg. “S-stop, it hurts, Sherlock, please,” the teen couldn’t stop the tears welding up in his eyes from the burning pain he felt in his anus.
“Good, now get some rest and we’ll talk some more tomorrow.” Mycroft squeezed John’s leg gently. “Thank you for trusting me,” he said as John’s eyes fluttered closed.
“No, no, goodness no, it is perfectly fine that you are a virgin. You should wait until you really have feelings for someone. You are too special to give yourself away that easily, John, do you understand me?”
John’s long cursing session in his mind was cut off when he felt himself being picked up off the bed. “I know just how to show you how teenagers are supposed to act,” Sherlock laughed, hauling the boy into the bathroom with surprising ease.
The plan seemed to work too, as Sebastian released John and focused on Sherlock again. “Sherlock,” John called to him, making his heart melt from only two syllables.
“John,” the velvety voice stopped his rambling, “take your trousers and pants off.” Without thinking, the boy did as his
“Not as sorry as you are going to be,” Mycroft told him, motioning for Sherlock to have a seat on one of the chairs on the opposite side of the desk. “You need to learn your place John, and that does not include running away or taking innocent people hostage. You are our Sub, and it’s our job to discipline you.”
“I was seven when I saw the movie. Mummy said I was too young to watch it and Mycroft made fun of me, so…so I snuck down and watched it through the crack in the door.”
John put his arms on the rail and tipped forward, feeling the hands of his mother, Mike, his teachers, the Headmaster…and Jim grabbing ahold of his shirt collar and pulling him over the edge into blackness.
“Put the soap back in your mouth and stand with your nose in the corner, John.” Mycroft said but still didn’t order. John really could have used it too, the numbness spreading through his burning thigh muscles would have been appreciated but alas, the Dom just stared at him calmly. “Things don’t change just because we have company, John,” he stood up from his desk and started walking,
John jerked at the strange silicone intrusion, craning his neck back to look at what Sherlock had done. The detective just smiled back at him, planting several light kisses over the sweaty face and neck, assuring the boy everything was okay. “So that you’ll always have me inside of you, with you; even when I’m not holding you, you will still be able to feel me. Can you feel my come inside you, John?” He asked, nosing the exhausted boy’s cheek, making it sound like a great honor to be plugged with his lovers come,
“Sorry,” John apologized before he could stop the words from coming out of his mouth. John realized he had been doing that a lot lately, but had no idea why he was losing control of his words and actions. He had been lowering his head, saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’ or ‘sorry’ way too much.
John ran back down the steps, using his hand to flatten his hair down. Sherlock was waiting for him with an eagerness John had seen many times when they were in bed together. It didn’t take them long to catch a cab, nor was it a very long drive to the crime scene. Perhaps it only seemed that way though as John was so busy smelling the fresh air, looking up at the grey sky, and watching people walking outside. It was always strange, John thought, to watch other people, realizing that they had a life completely different than his. They had their own troubles, own families who they went home to every night or called every weekend. Everyone he saw had their own life and they were completely oblivious to everyone else’s secrets.
Without thinking, Sherlock twisted his head and bit down on John’s arm as hard as he could and pulled. Putrid sulfur filled his mouth as a deafening scream filled his sensitive ears. But he was free! John’s hands let go of him for just an instant and Sherlock was on Greg.
“Mmhm, mmhm, yes,” Sherlock continued nodding his head, “well I don’t see why not. You must be gently though, just like when you patched up Leopold, yes?” Molly nodded seriously again.
“Sherlock!” John shouted breathlessly, sitting up quickly and looking around. Pain decided to explode everywhere in his body, especially in his left chest and ankle. His head became unnaturally light, forcing him to lie back down before he yakked all over himself.
It took him all but three minutes to grab his suture kit and a few other supplies. He ran back downstairs and thankfully found the man still waiting for him. “Good man,” John said, as he kneeled down in front of him. “What’s your name?” he asked, trying to get the kid’s attention away from the wound on his hand.
As the adrenaline from his dream started to wear off, John went against his vampire’s judgement and released the hunter. Greg immediately collapsed to the ground, gasping for much needed air. “How did they find us?” John demanded. If his senses were correct, which they always were, the League where a quarter of a kilometer away and closing fast.
“Of course not,” Mycroft confirmed, “he’s been taken care of. Are you quite done with young Archibald?”
“It’s alright there, lad,” Greg told him, running a hand through John’s hair. “Bring him up when you get into the car, Sherlock. This can’t be good for him to be dropped that deep that fast.”
After much debating, Sherlock decided it was best to only text John that night instead of call. He wanted the teenagers imagination to run wild at all the things they would do together and the detective knew he had conditioned John enough that the boy would only think of the good things, never negative scenarios like the possibility that the man he was about to meet was ten years older than he said. His boy was too trusting for any of that kind of nonsense and the detective was far too clever to ever put that seed of doubt anywhere near his mind. “Yes, when I come to pick you up tomorrow my dear John, you won’t run, you won’t be frightened. No, you will hug me and let me hold your hand, just like you were meant to do all along. Because you love me.”
He felt Sherlock lift his hips slightly, then pull down his sleep trousers just to the top of his thighs.
“You are very welcome. Sleep well John,” the boy hung up and Sherlock added, “my John,” while he began wiping off his come with the black briefs his John had given him.
“Oh, I understand just fine. You found some secret way of domming people with RDD and now you expect me to be happy that I can go down into subdrop now and suck your dick for you! Tell me Sherlock, do I look happy?”
“You’re going to hurt yourself,” Sherlock told him when he stepped out of the bathroom. The Dom quickly strode over to him and placed his hands on either side of John’s head, making his thumbs meet just between John’s eyebrows. He started massaging the area, forcing John’s face to relax in the process. “Stop thinking so hard and the answer might come.”
“Hello John, you don’t have to be afraid of me,” he told the boy, who looked smaller in real life than he did in the pictures and surveillance tapes. Mycroft watched, both sad and awestruck, as the two people in front of him calmed immediately as they embraced. Sherlock had become agitated from their conversation but was now losing the tension in the wrinkles around his eyes and the mounds of his shoulders. The worst part of the scene before him though, was how John, who had two casts on, no doubt Sherlock’s tactic for making the boy dependent, some sort of cock ring based on the slight tenting of the duvet, and naked with two grown men in the room seemed to melt as soon as his younger brother put an arm around the small shoulders.
“Yes, yes, it’s brilliant! I think we both are going to pass math finally, I really appreciate the help.”
“Yes,” Mycroft nodded. “I will ensure you never see the like of me or Sherlock again. You will be relocated and start a brand new life. All you have to do is say yes, and Mr. Lestrade will take you where you need to be.”
Thanks to Ebrill for suggesting Archie be thrown into this mess. I hope you're happy with yourself. LoL!
As he started on the ‘H,’ John’s iron grip started to slacken and Sherlock realized he was beginning to pass out from the pain. Perhaps it was better that way though, Sherlock thought as he completed the final vertical line and turned off the pen. He sat there a moment, stroking over John’s belly, watching as some of his blood from the bite mark dripped onto the tan flesh. “Good boy,” he praised again when John whimpered. “You can go back to sleep while I fix you up,” Sherlock whispered to him, relishing in the dead weight of John’s body on top of him.
“That’s enough,” Mycroft said calmly this time and John felt pain shoot down his neck all the way to his toes until the boy finally fell to his knees. Like that, the calm numbness he had felt from the command was gone and replaced by a constant throbbing in the back of his neck. The room filled with an awkward silence. However, Mycroft seemed content with how things had turned out; John wobbly on his knees from the mixture of dopamine and pain running through his system and Sherlock moving to sit down in the only other chair at the table.
Not only did his bum hurt, but his pride had taken a beating as well. The fact that at sixteen years of age, he’d had his pants pulled down, and was then bent across someone’s knee made his confidence in his ability to fight Sherlock and Mycroft go down the drain. They were just too smart for him, and not to mention they were both right about John deserving a spanking after the stunt he pulled at the hospital.
“Good. Good boy, Sherlock,” John said, loosening his grip on the young vampire just a touch. Sherlock tried not to smile as his plan was working out just how he wanted. John was letting his guard down. “Okay, now for part two. Greg, I want him to either drink from your calf or forearm, which would you prefer?”
“Shhh, tell me what happened,” he asked but the answer was obvious. However, Sherlock knew it was important for John tp say it and hear it for himself. That’s the only way he would learn the lesson and his mother’s betrayal would sink in, bringing him one step closer to the man’s hold.
“I don’t think he will give us anything to go off of...do you?” He asked tentatively, his voice laced with fear and anticipation. Even though John was five years older, it was still so easy to anticipate exactly how he would act. Not that it was boring, no, John could never be boring, but the fact that Sherlock could hold living putty in his hands gave an unexpected rush to his already aching member. It took a minute of steady breathing to not immediately come in his pants.
“I can do it. I won’t mess up, I promise,” the Sub pleaded, even as Sherlock left the room to find the restraints John had been tied up in after he bit Mycroft.
“S-s-she didn’t a-answer,” John cried, gripping ahold of Sherlock’s robe, causing the detectives heart to break. “She d-doesn’t c-c-care about m-me!” He hooked his arm under the shaking boy’s knees and behind his back, lifting him up to spread out on the bed. Quickly, he sat the glass of milk on the side table and brought the plate with him on the bed, propping himself up on the head board. John was still whimpering when he pulled the boy to his chest, letting his head rest on his right shoulder.
Tears started to well up in John’s eyes. Hopelessness took over until he felt the tracker in his pocket. If he called his Doms now, then they could take Harry, Mike, and Jim to a safe place. It could get rough though, John thought, knowing how angry the Subs were just at the thought of being taken in. No, he wouldn’t give away his friends, even if it was the best thing for them. He loved them and couldn’t betray there trust like that. If he tried again another day maybe, or had more time to prepare a speech, maybe he could convince them.
“Wh-What happened? Sherlock, why are…” he could see more awareness come back into the boy’s eyes and knew their next exchange was critical in keeping John calm.
“Hello there,” the deep voice said, an amused smile causing little wrinkles at the corners of the man’s eyes. Panicked and still having left over adrenaline and rage from his failed attack, John tried to spring off his back to strangle the man but the hand in his hair and now a heavy body straddling his chest, prevented even the weakest of attacks. “Easy, calm down,” the volume of his voice never changed but the depth, or perhaps it was the tone, which made the words into a command. John had no idea, as a Sub, the only way he could tell a command from normal conversation was the tingling, which was now threatening to spread down his back and make him ‘calm down.’
“No, stay on your stomach, John.” Sherlock bent down to hover above John’s back, his knees digging into the boy’s hips and his obscenely hard cock pressed against the blonde’s ass. “You’re hurt, I need to fix you.” John couldn’t help but smile at the word choice, understanding why ignorance was bliss. Those simple words of ‘I need to fix you,’ warmed the fourteen year old John’s heart to the brim at the thought of every trouble disappearing because of Sherlock’s touch.
Mycroft had been sitting in his office when a text came over his phone at the same time Anthea burst through his door, panic in her eyes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The large man put a gentle hand on John’s shoulder, turning him to walk towards the black car. “Please,” he begged one more time, unsure of what to do. Even though it was impossible for John to do anything anyways, deep down Sherlock knew he didn’t want to question, didn’t want to fight. No, all his sweet boy wanted to do was lay in Sherlock’s warm lap, and thankfully, that’s all Sherlock wanted too.
“But you-“John started to say but was cut off when Sherlock went in for a deep kiss, biting slightly at the smaller bottom lip.
Sherlock took the opportunity to take a seat next to his lover again, pressing up against his body was like lying in front of a calm fire during a winter night. It took every ounce of self-control not to capture John’s lips and take what was his. “Well there are hundreds if not thousands of beers around the world for you to try. That’s what’s cool about trying new things and having as many experiences as you can, yeah? Well, I don’t…that’s what I think at least.” The detective knew there was a fine line between giving advice as an adult to a child and talking about things as friends, so he decided to add a bit of second guessing himself to appear as unsure as the boy sitting across from him.
“You haven’t met John, Mycroft, he is different than Victor, so different you won’t even believe. Plus, John wants to stay here with me, I’m not forcing him. You’ve read his file, I’m sure you’ve stuck your nose into the CCTV and watched him,” Mycroft raised his chin slightly, but didn’t show any confirmation the allegation was true.
John stared at his hands, recalling every single time Sherlock touched his back and wondering if his mind was ever his own. It was obvious he was under Sherlock’s control when he went into a deep subdrop, but the other times John couldn’t identify. “So you transmitted through touching my back?”
As he looked at Greg, who was unconsciously transmitting bliss to the Dom in his arms, John got an idea.
“Basically, yes,” Mycroft nodded and smiled as he could almost see the relief rising from the boy’s shoulders. Once the confusion was gone it seemed John was able to work out what was going on in his mind and why he was feeling those feelings.
if John was being honest with himself. If he and his sister hadn’t presented as submissive, then he wouldn’t be a freezing homeless runaway thief gang leader,
“Can you tell me now, why am I here?” John asked, feeling amazingly clear headed and ready for action. It seemed as if the bliss he created himself amped up his adrenaline and sharpened his senses almost.
Hello(: Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos, they really make my day and encourage me to keep writing.
“I know, Sherlock, I know,” John sighed, disappointment clear in his voice. “Just try to concentrate. Control your urges.”
“Please,” he said as he slowly grasped the laptop, making sure not to frighten the boy into doing something rash. John had always been a huge boulder sitting on the edge of a cliff just waiting to tumble down. However, over the past month Sherlock had done his best to build stilts and braces under the unsteady boy but when there are gusts of wind and monsters with saws out there trying desperately to cut away the supports, it was almost impossible to keep him safe.
“Good boy, that’s it,” he praised and John was disturbed at how much he soaked it up, acting like balm on the soreness in his arse. “Come for me John, come while I’m inside of you.”
“Yes, sure, sure, we’re leaving now. You need to be quiet, Molly,” John said, picking the girl up in his arms and pressing her face into his chest so she wouldn’t alert anyone to their presence.
John stepped out of the car and waited for the ‘minder’ to catch up before they went inside the store. “Just need to grab a few things. I’ll only be ten minutes or so,” John told the man, grabbing a trolley to put his weight on as he walked.
“My, my,” the head hunter tsked. “John Watson, you’ve caused quite the mess haven’t you? Hmm, take him back to HQ. I’m interested to see what kind of vampire is capable of such influence over three of our best hunters.”
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said, standing up and walking over to the Sub lying on the floor, sprawled out and panting. “He’s just panicked by his own nature finally returning from its dormant state. A cave with silhouettes is nothing compared to actual grass beneath your feet, is it John?” The tall man was now standing above him, looking down with a wide smile on his face. “The pound wouldn’t know what to do with him, you know that Mycroft.”
“Alright, you know the drill, inform the necessary departments please, Anthea. I want a tracker on John Watson at all times and do tell them to try to find a way to bug my brother’s flat without him finding them in the first hour, yes.”
“John,” Sherlock called to him from the kitchen, his face concerned at the site of the boy who was paler than bleached parchment. “What’s wrong?”
John sighed, already tired mentally and physically before the day had barely begun. He knew there was no time to rest though as his mind ran through data and information, trying to sort out what the Holmes’ knew about him, the other Subs, why they might be taking him to IBAD, especially if Sherlock said they weren’t selling him?
John squirmed, as much as his injury would allow, under the scrutiny. Unsure of what to do, he said what he truly thought. “He would do the same for me.” It was true, more than true, and both men in the room knew it to be fact.
“You were high,” John said, holding out the toast for Sherlock to finish eating. The human took it and threw it across the room, his eyes focused on nothing but John. “As I take your blood, I release some neuro chemical that affects humans. It makes you feel like everything is okay, so you don’t run.”
John was silent for a moment, unsure of what Mycroft meant. He had a life, a life with Sherlock. It wasn’t what he had planned, but what else was out there that Sherlock would approve of? “My life?”
They stared at each other for a long time, until John realized how unacceptably rude he was being. After Sherlock was so understanding about his soreness, hell the man didn’t even make fun of him, the least he could do was repay him. “Can-can I taste you?” The words came from his mouth before he could stop himself. His terror and uncertainty was washed away, however, when he saw the delight in those silver eyes above him.
“John,” there were voices around him, too many voices, too many colors, too many people trying to grab ahold of him. It was all just too much and he needed Sherlock but he wasn’t there,
John hadn’t even realized he’d said it, to be honest; it was just old hat by now because Baker Street was his home, so why wouldn’t he call it ‘their’ flat. “Yes, well, I guess it wasn’t at the time but now…”
Hey everyone, so after a lot of debating and brainstorming I have decided to do a sequel. One person, sorry I can't remember your username, suggested a few ideas, which got my imagination working, so thanks for that(:
The scones were delicious and, to John’s relief, the milk tasted fine too. After five minutes, the plate was void of all crumbs and the milk was gone. John decided it was time to go home so he could think about what happened this weekend without those piercing eyes staring into his soul. Sometimes it seemed like Sherlock was forcing thoughts into his head, or at least making them muddled enough so it was hard to think. “If you can’t drive me home it’s no big deal. I can ride the tube if that would be easier.”
Before he even knew Sherlock was sending wave after wave of Bliss to him, John was boneless in the man’s arms. “Nnngg,” he tried but even his tongue wouldn’t work.
“He’s fine, Mycroft. He’s in the bedroom sleeping, well…more like hibernating,” John said, trying to reassure the man who, even in this state, was worried about his little brother. These humans were starting to grow on him.
“Sherlock’s a new vampire and you’re the first human he’s been around, save for that nurse at hospital. Of course he’s going to act like an animal. We all did…and some of us still do; the ones who don’t learn to control their urges, that is.”
Although, the DI was a smart man and most likely knew everything that was happening to John, he just couldn’t bring himself to ask, which again, Mycroft was more than thankful for.
“But, but I…I need,” yes, he did want to do it now. It was already there, in his grasp, why not take it and be done?
“It’s all been taken care of; you never have to go back to that horrible life again, love.” Sherlock’s hand began moving down from his chest to the hem of his pants.
“Come on, we’ll see him in a couple of days,” Greg said, putting a sympathetic hand on Mycroft’s shoulder and turning him towards the exit. “John will take care of him.”
“Yeah, I was pumping it out pretty strong at the end there after my trouser leg caught on fire. Hey,” John remembered, “how are Jim and Greg?”
John knew he wouldn’t be released until he did what Mycroft said, so John swallowed and lowered his head. “I’m sorry for using foul language in front of you, Greg.”
“Sherlock!” he chastised, then refocused his attention on the lady at the front desk. “One in the same, though this little one is suffering with RDD, so we took him for his own safety.” Mycroft said, looking down at John who continued to stare at the floor.
“Sherlock, stop,” John groaned out, undoubtedly still sore and tired from their midnight festivities.
“John, I need you to come with me, now okay? There’s a good lad,” another voice said to him, or maybe it was to somebody else, another John perhaps.
John paused, shocked at the man’s confession of love. He racked his brain trying to remember if Sherlock had ever said that before but he came up empty. “You’ve never said that…that you loved me.”
With that, Sherlock hung up, placing his phone in his pocket and turning his attention to his microscope. He grabbed a small piece of plastic and used a pipette to drop some of John’s blood onto it. With the blood in place, Sherlock set it under the scope and ginned at what he saw.
“Indeed, I had the good fortune to be born with a receptor, but I am like you John. All of the Subs in our cause are like you.” She turned back around to face John.
“I don’t care,” the boy chuckled and he could feel the warmth of tears soaking into the cotton over his chest. Sherlock smiled and wrapped his arms around the shaking body, pulling him tighter to him to let John know he didn’t mind the weight. “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you,” John apologized, making Sherlock cringe, knowing he was the cause of the two steps back in making his boy blame himself for a burden that wasn’t his to bear.
“Yum!” She licked her lips, because yes, macaroni and cheese did sound delicious. Molly ran up the stairs and into the bathroom. There was a stool set up just for her, so she could brush her teeth and wash her hands without Greg’s help. Not that he minded of course, as he always tucked the little girl in at night without fail.
“First,” Sherlock said, placing his hand back on John’s shoulder even when he tried to shove it off. “we go home so you and Mycroft can heal properly.”
“Why did you blow up the conference center, Ms. Adler?” John asked. He couldn’t even fathom being so angry at people that he would consider blowing them up. Hatred just wasn’t in his soul.
He sighed when he saw the contents, his shoulders dropping and losing their tension. Sex toys, Jim had left him different varieties of sex toys for him and John to play with. Sherlock, smiled thinking about all the things they would do together for the rest of their lives, how much fun they would have being all each other needed. The detective had learned from his mistakes that much he was sure of and he was also sure that John was different than Victor, different than all of them. John was special, John was perfect and John was his and he’d never felt this way in his entire life. That boy was his perfect hit and Sherlock knew he would never get bored.
“Well, that’s a shame,” the woman said and began walking towards the edge of her row. John watched as she left the building, wondering where she was going. Everyone found out a moment later when a loud boom echoed through the large room and the walls started to fly through the air.
“Go to sleep for me,” the voice reverberated through his bones, caressing his muscles, and wrapping his mind in warm calm water.
“We’ll talk about it while we eat, yeah?” Sherlock smiled and pulled on his sleep trousers and a baggy grey shirt.
“Please pullout it hurts,” John sobbed, but Sherlock observed the trembling hips jerked back towards him, subconsciously seeking out the pleasure the man could give him. He stood there for a moment, enjoying the feeling of being inside that warm twitching canal, imagining how full, how complete John must feel now that he had his lover all the way inside of him.
It felt good, it felt right to have his arms tied behind his back so he didn’t have to worry about doing anything. It felt right to have his face pressed up against his Dom. It just felt right. With a smile on his face, John closed his eyes and breathed in clean scent of Sherlock’s clothes.
“Why?” John asked, knowing there had to be a trap he was missing. He had had enough missteps over the past couple of days and he wasn’t going to put his friends’ lives on the line if IBAD was planning something.
He lifted the man over his shoulder, needed to add more bliss to handle the weight. Sherlock might be skinny, but he was still a good head taller and much more muscular than John gave him credit for. John grunted under the weight, but settled the man on his shoulder.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but stood up and motioned for John to do the same. John stood, wincing at the feeling of blood flowing back into his bruised bum. He followed them both into the main foyer and jumped at the unexpected knock at the door.
“Help what?” Jim scoffed. “Help give us giant scars on the back of our necks? Help brainwash us? No thanks,” he stepped in between John and Harry. “I think you need to leave, John. I don’t have any use for Dom lovers in my group.”
With one last rinse of his body, John jumped out of the shower, dried off, and got dressed in record time. He was out of the flat with a piece of toast in his mouth and thirteen minutes to make it to his class. “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he cursed, but was thankful when a black car pulled up in front of 221B. “Bless you Mycroft,” John whispered and got into the car.
John kept his mouth shut, unsure of what he should say. What would Mycroft do if he found out John could create his own bliss?
“Let go of me! I don’ want your food,” John said, feeling like a little kid throwing another tantrum because he didn’t want to eat his vegetables.
After at least five turns down endless hallways, John was lost and his head was pounding with an ache that made his eyes water. Hoping maybe he could use his small stature to his benefit, John dove into a room and looked for a hiding spot. Instead, he found himself in a room with doors on either side and a shocked nurse.
“John?” Sherlock called from just outside the door, “do you need some help?” The voice asked in a sultry tone. The Detective was insatiable, even with John being so young it was crazy how quick Sherlock wanted more, always more. Sometimes, when Sherlock would make him come so intensely or when he kissed him too deeply, John felt as if the man was sucking the life right out of him, as if he was some kind of succubus. Sherlock seemed to not only want to drain his will to escape but also, there was something deeper that the man wanted from him; his soul perhaps.
“Now, now,” the Doctor said, grabbing some gauze out of a draw, rather slowly for having a boy bleeding from his neck on the table. “It should stop in a moment.” He pressed the material hard against John’s neck and then that’s when the Sub decided he’d had enough. “Now, let’s check your vitals, shall-“
John did his best but his leg was getting tired and sore quickly until he was lifted into a familiar bubble bath, lying on top of Sherlock. The water felt amazing on his arm and leg, which had avoided any liquid over the past month. The smooth large hand ran soap through his hair, which had grown at tad longer as well and had even taken a slight curl at his nape. “Why don’t you wash your leg while I finish up here? I don’t know how sore it still is and I don’t want to apply to much pressure, yeah?”
“How is John? Has he asked about me?” The look on his brother’s face, although Mycroft gave a valiant attempt at hiding it, made Sherlock panic. “What happened?”
His John smiled back with adoration in his eyes, “cheers,” he said, but as soon as he took a sip, the smile faded and Sherlock could tell he was not a fan. However, even if he could coax the boy into drinking half the bottle, with his low tolerance level, it would relax him enough to stop jiggling his small knee. “It’s not bad, I guess but I don’t see how people can drink this one with dinners and stuff.”
“Let him go! You can’t do this! He doesn’t want you to take it off!” John wrapped his arms around the bigger man’s arm and yanked, while his foot slammed down on Daniel’s. The older man seemed indestructible though and didn’t even flinch from John’s onslaught. “I’ll tell you who Mycroft is seeing,” John said without thinking.
“Just breathe and stay calm, John,” Sherlock whispered to him before he opened up the door to reveal a massive room. There were at least two hundred white chairs in rows leading up to a large table with a red cloth hanging over it and seven chairs behind it.
With a hand at his back, Sherlock ushered John up to the second floor. Something started burning in John’s eye when they arrived in Sherlock’s room.
“I know you do, Sherlock. I understand, but you have to trust me on this. I will give you the blood; you just need to calm down for a second, okay?” John reached out and touched the sweaty curls plastered to the vampire’s forehead.
John tightened when he felt a large hand on his shoulder and pathetically gave into the slight pressure Sherlock added, pushing the Sub back down to the bed, chest first. “Please don’t,” John whispered, still keeping his eyes closed.
John began to squirm and struggle when Sherlock grabbed the waistband of his pants and trousers and tugged down, exposing John’s bare arse for all to see. Sherlock held him tightly to his lap, like a Venus flytrap that finally found its prey. John whimpered slightly at the fact that his hands barely touched the ground and his feet were completely off.
He smiled and took a sip, trying not to grimace at the harsh whiskey but if Mycroft knew anything, it was that appearances were everything.
Again, it took another hour and a half to get back to Baker Street, while Sherlock flipped between the three camera images, looking over John’s room with a fine tooth comb. Once he made his way up the stairs to 221B, changed into his robe and pajama trousers, made a cup of tea, and synced the camera feeds to his laptop to see all three views at once, it was five minutes past eight. No sooner had he looked at the clock, a teenage boy was walking into view on the laptop screen.
“Y-Yes, Sherlock,” John squeezed his lips together in a tight line, trying desperately to be brave for him.
The boy’s orgasm caused the walls inside to contract dramatically, squeezing and begging Sherlock to replace the seed that was dispensed only moments ago.
“He’s been horrible to you,” Sherlock said seriously, as if John wasn’t considering the question all the way through. “He bought you against your will. Made you put soap in your mouth. Forced you to eat out of his hand. And still, you almost drown pulling a man who weighs nearly twice as much as you out of the Thames. Why?”
“Excuse me, ma’am,” John asked one of the ladies who seemed in a hurry. He had no idea if this would work, but he might as well give it a try.
His feet began moving towards the Dom and before John knew it, his knees were on the ground and he saw Mycroft give his brother a smug look. A wide grin came across John’s face as he forces down the wonderful tingles in his spine. Before Mycroft could even react, John lunged forward, head-butting the man right in the crotch. A loud shout in pain made the hand on his head forcing his face to the ground worth it. “You little-“ Mycroft said, pushing John’s face roughly into the carpet.
“We’ve capture twenty two members of the Resistance already, John,” Mycroft told him, taking a sip of his tea. “We used the license plate of the car you stole to track them back to their hide out. Irene and most of the higher ups were already gone, but the few stranglers were…strangely cooperative.”
Sherlock’s face tightened then went lax, and then tightened again in concentration as he jerked them both into hardness and worked himself open.
When he came too, wiping a bit of drool that had traveled down his chin, John had to fight back every instinct, which told him to defy and fight until one of them was lying unconscious and bloody on the floor. There were too many odds stacked against him though, the Sub knew this, and used the brain power that was used to locate weakness and openings for fighting, John thought about how he would escape from right under their noses.
“Alright, let’s go shall we and remember, if you see anyone, assume they are a Dom and get the fu-“ he stopped, glanced at Molly who seemed more interested in the hole in the hat John gave her than the conversation, “heck out of there. If they catch you, we can’t get you back without the risk of them Domming us too. Ten minutes and then we’re gone, understood?”
“Sherlock, settle down, you are only making it harder than it already is for the poor boy,” a familiar voice came from somewhere inside the building.
John put his head in his hands and pulled away from Sherlock. He had to stifle a whimper as the warmth was ripped away as the touch was lost.
Then, the thought dawned on him, realizing Sherlock was still trying to show how worthwhile he was to him. As John was about to profess his acceptance of both himself and the way Sherlock felt about him, a voice shouted from downstairs.
“You brought this on yourself, John,” he said, untying his robe and letting it fall gracefully to the floor. “If you just did as you were told and bent over, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” Sherlock stood behind John, rubbing his hands possessively over his flank, from his neck all the way down to his arse. He started using his nails, making John groan and shiver in response.
“John,” Sherlock’s smile was gone and he squirmed uselessly in John’s grasp. “John wait,” he said, but it was too late. Drool fell from John’s mouth landing on the pale neck, numbing the area. A growl came from somewhere deep inside him when he heard his prey whimper. After a moment of looking down into panicked eyes, John struck with the force of a shot gun.
“Yeah,” John answered with a nod. He remembered how Greg had lowered his gun at the hospital when he saw how terrified John was.
“The only reason you were not shocked was because I rather like that china you have in your hand.” Mycroft put his coffee down and pulled out the remote, fixing John with a deadly glare. “But know this, if you do not sit down and eat within the next ten seconds, you will be shocked and then I will tie you to the chair myself.”
John balked, angry at the man for not even letting him speak. He glared at Mycroft, who glared right back at him, except the latter’s was much, much more terrifying. The Sub’s teenage stubbornness decided to kick in, so John dug his feet in, ready for whatever Mycroft was about to do to him.
Hello everyone(: As always I really appreciate all the lovely comments and kudos, you don't know how happy it makes me that so many people are enjoying the story.
“No!” John grabbed his friend’s shoulders to hold him back from the house. “You-you and Harry go get Mike. I’m the only one who stands a chance at not getting Dommed, or at least I can buy enough time to get us out of there before…well, just go, I’ll get Molly and meet you guys back at the Pipe.”
“You took that young girl hostage, which forced Sherlock to take you down as fast as possible. That is hazardous behavior at its peak and I will not have any Sub of mine running around like some wild animal!” Mycroft’s voice was rising with every word, until finally it reached a bellow.
“If you need anything, just wright it down on a piece of paper and look at it. We will see it and be in contact with you as soon as possible.”
“Even your blood is hungry. It attacked my human blood cells when I added them to yours. Brilliant!”
Greg’s eyes widened. “What? Wait, no!” he shouted, his body automatically dropping into a defensive posture. He could take down three, maybe four of the other Hunters, but eventually Greg would fall and all four of them would be taken. That fact still didn’t stop him from backing down when Lynn, a second year hunter with the London branch of the League, came at him with a spool of ghost twine.
As they walked through the row of cages to get to the other side, John learned what desperation and hopelessness truly were. The terrified eyes that peered up at him shifted something inside John. He understood what kind of horrors went on behind closed doors. He understood what cruelty truly was. He understood why the collar could save so many lives. He understood.
“John,” he heard Greg say from behind him. John looked up to see the hunter with a crossbow in his hands. “It’s over,” the man growled, his eyes dark. Before John could react, a wooden steak shot through his heart by the humans he was trying to help.
John cursed himself for envying Jim, who had seeming lost his will to live…no, not his will to live, his will to fight. Jim would have a comfortable happy life, while John was always on edge, waiting for the chance to run away. He was very good at running away after all.
“Just over a year ago,” the other man said, “he seems to be coping rather well, but he might still be in shock. Children Services is on their way now.”
“You had that dream again,” it wasn’t a questions. Sherlock knew, he always knew what was going on in the Doctor’s head.
“I know.” With that, he started pushing his much bigger than three fingers cock into the boy’s red hole.
After what seemed like an eternity of time standing still, they pulled away, John slowly opening his eyes. As he came back to himself, John’s eyes grew wide, while Sherlock had a sleepy smile on his face.
would be the winner. He had watched how Sherlock had gone from calm and docile to panicked, angry, and belligerent at the drop of a hat. The same process repeated again and again as Sherlock cursed at the solicitors and officers who tried to question him but would answer all the questions when it came to telling them that he was the one who shot Moriarty, not John.
Greg opened his eyes slowly, as the pain in his head was too painful for any sudden movements. The sirens had turned to a constant beeping noise and the numerous people who had swarmed him had been narrowed down to two. A burly man, who Greg knew was the ‘muscle,’ and of course, Mycroft Holmes sat next to his bed.
“That’s better. Now you’re in the correct position,” Mycroft said without even looking up from the papers on his desk. John tried counting by threes, reciting Pi, which was stupid because all he remembered from his two years at the Sub school was 3.14, naming the oceans, naming the continents, anything he could think of to stop his mind from being in the here and now. It was working until suddenly, his friends floated into his thoughts as if paddling down the river he tried to damn up. They were caught, being auctioned all because he couldn’t keep them safe, all because he couldn’t protect them.
He paused, in fact, dealing with his brother was the only time Mycroft hesitated in his decisions, and quite frankly it was pissing him off to be so inefficient. He sighed, leaned back in his chair and sealed John’s fate. “No, send one of our officers to find the evidence at the beach and then contact Mrs. Watson. Keep our men on the case, Anthea, I don’t want anyone sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong.”
“Okay…okay,” Greg said, pulling away from Sherlock and running a hand through his hair. “This is a phase, In’it? You just want to do your stupid little experiments and then let him go, right? Just like that whole hedgehog thing last spring, yeah?”
The contact of another Dom made John melt even more as his blood turned to lava and his brain turned to mush. “I dropped him a bit too fast,” Sherlock said as they started moving.
“I-I didn’t mean to,” John cried into the pillow. John tried to handle everything this world was throwing at him, he really did, but at the end of the day, he was only a scared teenage boy. He’d almost been shot by one of his best friends,
“Yes,” he said without hesitation and Mycroft tried to keep his face from falling. The boy had learned nothing and because of that he would have to prevent Sherlock from ever seeing him, at least until John was grown.
“Thanks,” Sherlock said, but obviously didn’t mean it. He handed the man his fare and slowly moved himself from under John’s body. It must have been the painkillers from earlier, because even as Sherlock picked him up gently under the knee and ribs, John merely mumbled. Being careful of John’s shoulder, he let the younger man’s feet down on the stoop, but kept one arm around him while Sherlock opened the door.
“Please, just listen to me okay,” Mycroft said, not wanting to hear those words out of a fourteen year olds mouth again. “Look at it this way; let’s say you had to do one hundred pushups every morning for one year, yes. It would be hard at the beginning but then you would become really strong and by the end of that year you could do the hundred easily, right?” John nodded but Mycroft could tell the boy didn’t know what pushups had to do with him and Sherlock. “But what if someone else came along and said you only had to do ten and they would do the other ninety for you. Then, it would be really easy but by the end of the year you wouldn’t be as strong.” He finished his little story, proud at how he was able to think abstractly enough to explain a complicated matter in such terms.
It was like something out of a movie, John thought when he saw someone had already set the table for them. There was only one plate of food though, and he knew what was coming next.
This chapter is very dark and has some violence and creepy psychological manifestations...you'll see what I mean, but it is quite disturbing so prepare yourselves(:
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” John shouted and stood up from his seat, ice cream be damned.
Deciding this was too serious to handle on his own, the teen wanted to ask for advice, after all asking for help is a grown-up thing to do, right?
“Yes, John, yes, I’ve handpicked the families myself,” Greg assured him, and John had no choice but to believe him. “We just want to help them.”
The teen wasn't sure what was happening to his body or mind during school. The professors’ voices echoed in the background but all he could focus on was hearing Sherlock tell him how beautiful he was, how he wanted to touch his chest and stomach, he’d even asked to come in him. Suddenly, John felt his pants get very uncomfortable very quick.
“Oh, I’m sorry love,” Sherlock smiled again, rubbing his hand over John’s belly. This did not help John’s task of deflating his cock, either. With a soft kiss to the forehead and a playful pinch to the bum, Sherlock left the bathroom to get dressed in the other room. “There are some bagels on the counter and orange juice in the fridge. You should eat, John, build up your strength to help your immune system.” Sherlock reappeared in the doorway, his loose gray shirt and checkered sleep trousers billowing behind in his wake. “I have a very important experiment I need to finish up today and I believe you have two essays due tomorrow, yes?”
“It will take a few months for the initial hunger and instincts to die down, but even then it is always a battle to control one’s hunger,” John said, stroking down Sherlock’s back as the young vampire clung to him.
He sighed when she finished, giving him a pat on the head before she left him in the room with a distracted Sherlock.
“Sherlock, please, you don’t have to do this,” John begged. Another sob escaped his lips when he tried to reach out to the man but his upper arm only twitched, mocking him cruelly.
“But I compelled you, you shouldn’t even remember me,” John shouted this time, his anger rising. All he had tried to do was help, but he ended up exposing himself to a hunter.
When John arrived in the bathroom, he placed his crutch up against the wall. Sherlock was right behind him, turning on the tap and closing the door. “Hold onto my shoulders,” he said, kneeling down in front of John.
“Yeah, sorry, I’ll just be a minute,” the boy yelled and flushed the toilet and turned on the tap to wash his hands even though he hadn’t done anything. When he stepped out, Sherlock was standing just outside the door and John hadn’t realized how tall the man was until they were standing face to face, well more like face to chest. The man put a warm hand on his shoulder, leading him back to the couch.
“Boys!” a silky voice purred to them as they were ushered into a large office. There were no pictures on the walls and only a three tier plastic filer on the desk, along with a laptop and a few pens. The back of the chair was facing John, bringing a smile to the boy’s face when it reminded him of The Matrix.
“I crushed it about two kilometers away,” Mike lowered his head, still kicking himself for something.
He let go of Sherlock’s hands and licked his own lips, making sure to get every drop into his mouth. Sherlock’s eyes were half lidded, a dazed look covering the man’s face.
“Yes, John I want you to listen to me very carefully, can you do that?” John nodded, giving the DI his full attention. “You were kidnapped, you are not John Thomas, you are John Watson and you live in Southampton with your mom, not at Baker Street.”
“Do you trust me?” Sherlock lowered his head so their eyes were only centimeters away but the bastard kept his hips elevated so John couldn’t sneak attack and rub himself off quickly.
“Which would you prefer, John?” Sherlock asked, his lips right next to the Sub’s ear, causing the receptor on the back of his neck to go haywire.
“Hey, John come on, we’re gonna be late,” John looked up from his phone to realize he had walked all the way to school while texting.
Not wanting to go under and be completely naked and dressed by the infuriating man, John turned around and used the towel to somewhat cover his rear while he slipped on a pair of pants.
With that, John shoved his mobile in his pocket, trying to forget about Footballer17. “You okay, mate? You look a right mess,” Mike slapped his shorter friend on the back as they walked into class.
John felt and heard every slap of his foot as it hit the cold tile. The sound seemed to echo through the halls the same way the shouts from behind him echoed into his ears. “John, Stop!” Sherlock shouted, but even though he felt compelled to stop and kneel down on the floor, he knew if he did, that fucking lead would be clipped to his collar. So John kept running; to where, he had no idea, but he kept his feet moving nonetheless.
“Okay,” John whispered, making all the lights in Sherlock’s mind glow with a light brighter than the sun.
“Good boy,” Sherlock said, stroking John’s spine slowly. The warmth of the perfect tea and Sherlock’s touches calmed the boy’s nerves slightly, allowing him to focus better on Greg.
“I won’t My,” Greg whispered, looking over at the limp, pale form on the bed. “I’ll protect him. Don’t worry, My, I won’t let anything happen to either of you.” Something akin to an atomic bomb exploded in Greg’s chest when he heard the bedroom door open. For that split second, he prepared his body to fight until every Hunter was on the ground or he was completely subdued. But then, the first words Mycroft ever said to him flashed across his mind and made his hands still. ‘Don’t be an idiot, boy,’ the posh man had said to him, his umbrella digging into Greg’s chest after taking him down in two precise strikes.
“I…I’m sorry, I’ve never sired another vampire before and this feeling of possessiveness is getting the better of me.” John patted down Mycroft’s shirt, even as the man backed away. “Just let me see Sherlock for a moment and you’ll see how my presence affects him. Don’t let you hatred for me jeopardize your brother’s life.
It hurt to open his eyes, hell, it hurt to even breathe, but John forced his lids open. The walls were white with various patterns in turquois and coral on a thick border around the middle of the room. The door was closed, but John could hear commotion going on outside his room. As he continued to scan the room with groggy vision, John’s eyes came to rest on a man he knew all too well.
Without hesitation, Greg spoke up. “I can help,” he said, his voice confident and unwavering. John smiled, but inside he knew the risks of what the hunter was proposing. If he couldn’t control Sherlock, if the young vampire went into a frenzy, John wouldn’t be able to stop him.
“You were having a horrible nightmare early this morning and when I woke you up you were already in a panicked state. I tried to calm you down but I imagine that dream was a pretty nasty one because you tried to crush my bullocks and then ran out of the room.” Sherlock wiped his thumb over a few tears, smiling when he could see the apology wanting to escape the trembling lips. “It’s okay, you were just scared, you didn’t hurt me,” he assured the boy even though his groin still ached like a bastard. “I’m afraid you hurt yourself quite traumatically though, sweetheart. In your panic you fell down the stairs, oh God John I was so worried when you tripped.”
Deciding to try and make a little peace with John, or at least to get him more comfortable before the final experiment, Sherlock grabbed a cup and filled it with orange juice. This would be a perfect way to relax the fidgety vampire,
Well, there it is...I hope you enjoyed and the next chapter will be parallel to this one but from Sherlock's POV. So it will be the same scene and dialog, however, Sherlock hears some things that aren't necessarily accurate and you'll find out a little more about his plans for his John.
He could feel his climax coming, building up like a tidal wave behind a dam as all the worries and fears Sherlock had pointed out stacked up one by one, preparing to burst at any moment. Finally, when he heard Sherlock say, “I love you, John,” he came with a shout as everything left him, until there was nothing left but the water and Sherlock below him. “Good boy,” the praise took away the ache in his injuries and his straining thigh muscle, which had been propped up the whole time.
But the thought was short lived when he came to his senses that of course a college student wouldn’t want to shag a stupid kid like him. Deflated, the boy sighed getting out of the shower to brush his teeth and get dressed. The smile returned a second later when he heard the familiar ‘ding’ that meant Sherlock still wanted to talk to him.
“The Southsea Skate Park in Portsmouth, Sir. It appears he’s using Timothy Marcus, homeless for six years, to drop off the letter, skateboard, mobile, and shoes at the beach. Shall I intercept?”
John put his face down so he didn’t have to look at those all-knowing eyes. He knew the answer, of course he did, Sherlock had repeated it over and over again until sometimes he could hear it in his dreams. “It’s hard,” the boy whispered because it was, it was one of the hardest things he ever had to do. To trust someone, to allow them to take responsibility for things that should be his, and his alone to bear, was just too hard. How could he put such burdens on Sherlock, the man he loved with all his heart and soul, he had to protect the man who would do anything for him, that’s who he was.
He heard a sharp groan of lust from the boy and rewarded him by stroking over his cock. “Shhhh, this is what you want. I know it is,” Sherlock cooed, rutting against the boy’s spine, spikes of electricity shot through him while he rubbed John’s back, slowly working his way down to the ultimate goal. Still rolling the tight sac in his hand, Sherlock brought his hand down to the beautiful smooth arse, kneading the flesh slightly.
“John,” Mycroft called without even looking over at the Sub, “my apologies, did my brother wake you with his wailing?”
“I know you’re up there vampire. I will only tell you once; come down with your hands up and we won’t hurt you.”
“Mr. Holmes! Mr. Holmes, don’t do this!” He heard a woman yell, but it was of no consequence. Sherlock was dead.
John narrowed his eyes. Of course he was hungry, he was almost always hungry, but that didn’t mean he was going to bite this guy just for some experiment. “I’m fine,” John said, keeping his eyes on the table full of needles and vials.
“Yeah,” John answered, smart enough not to mention Greg. Even if the driver seemed to be on his side, John knew if he even hinted at talking to someone at the store, Mycroft, and consequently, Sherlock would hear about it.
After a minute or so, John’s eyes started to become slightly more clear, his vision coming back and the voices sounded more defined to his ears.
He took off his trousers and jumper, then pulled on a yellow Adidas shirt that was made out of a material called ‘slim fit,’ and then replaced his boring white y-fronts with blue boxer briefs. John frowned at the mirror when he saw how the shirt clung tightly to his frame, because all though he had a flat stomach, he still hadn’t achieved any definition in his abs like most of the football players did. However, he did like the briefs much better than the pants his mum bought him. As soon as he started to get flustered and unsure, a ‘ding’ came from his mobile, which was in his trousers hanging on a hook.
John was placed on a soft bed, belly down, as he gave a loud groan of discomfort. A soothing hand ran up and down his back while another fiddled with the shock collar around his neck. “Are your toes numb?” Sherlock asked behind him, “wiggle them for me.” John sighed into the pillow positioned under his head, not even realizing it was a command before it was too late. Drool pooled out of his mouth as his toes twitched and danced of their own accord. “Good boy,” the praise created a strange haze around him, offering an oasis for his thirst, which he thought unquenchable until he’d stumbled into the Holmes’ household.
The next time John opened his eyes, big curious ones were staring at him. “You talk in your sleep,” Sherlock told him. He turned around and slid off the bed, looking at John expectantly as he reached for his robe.
Sherlock felt his cock twitch, when his boy didn’t even question how he tripped or if the casts were even necessary. All his little John was worried about was if he had accidentally hurt the man and if his lover was worried about him falling.
At that, Greg nodded, took his trousers off, and sat on the couch with one leg propped up. Sherlock could smell the fear coming off of the human. The stench set off something inside him, triggering a reflex that made him want to chase down his prey and hold it in his mouth until it died. He couldn’t stop the small growl that came from his throat.
“My pleasure John, you’re wearing out this old man. Well, I better go change; we’ll talk tomorrow, yeah?” Sherlock had no intention of changing out of his clothes until the morning, after all, waking up with the pleasure John caused him was becoming his new favorite pastime.
Grunts filled the room as he came closer to the edge just from the smell and look of the boy below him. Finally, he gave a rough stoke, thrust his hips forward and came all over John’s chest, the white pearly strips matched perfectly with the lightly sun kissed skin under him. “Mine,” Sherlock panted as he massaged his seed into the teenager’s chest. Even going as far as to trace an ‘SH’ into the white liquid that made its home right over John’s heart. That’s where Sherlock was now and that’s where he would stay, “forever.”
Though Sherlock couldn’t be completely trusted, he was a Dom after all, John knew out of all his options this was the best bet. He had no idea what Sherlock was planning or why he had seemingly enjoyed watching John ram himself into the glass, but he did know it was a thousand times better than being strapped down to a table for experiments. Sometimes, John thought, the devil you don’t know is better than the one you do.
“What do you mean?” John asked, sitting up in his bed, wincing when his bliss started to fade from worry.
“Shhh, I’ll take care of you, John, do you trust me?” The deep voice whispered into his ear, making his cock twitch in the small space. He gave a few more huffs and desperate attempts to pump himself up into the infuriating man.
There was a loud bang at the other end of the alley of a rubbish bin falling to the ground. John turned so quickly he almost fell down. In the bright moon light stood a tall devilish figure with a pale face and a wide grin.
Thank you all so much for the kind words. I was in a really bad place in my head and your guys' willingness to stick with me and wait really helped me through a dark time. I won't go into details, but I'm still working through some things, however, I think I will be able to update once a week for both this story and the 'Strange Desires' series.
John didn’t answer, he wouldn’t, or maybe couldn’t. He loved Sherlock more than life itself, but for all the man’s assets, he was a crazy possessive bastard who liked to fuck John in mind and body.
“You seemed to enjoy it,” Sherlock answered as got into the bed. He pulled the covers up around him and snuggled down deep.
After he finished his homework, John made some canned soup and garlic bread then waited for his mom to get home from work. “Well I’ll be, what’s this for, Johnny?” She smiled as she walked in the door and set her stuff down on the chair.
“You’re sorry?! What, he drank from you on accident?” Mycroft said, taking a step forward and clenching his fist together. He wanted to strangle the life out of this vampire right now, but he knew he would have to be calm if he was to find out more of Sherlock’s…condition.
“John,” he moaned, realizing the breathlessness he felt was due to the teenager sprawled out over him. “I think you’re crushing my lungs,” he tried to laugh, tried to regain some form of stability and bring them both back to the here and now.
Sherlock had held John tightly to his chest, stoking over the freshly applied gauze as the boy slept. With his mind calm, Sherlock dove down into his palace and went over the information he’d retrieved about the three children.
When the young vampire was good and handed over the bag without a fuss, John would reward him by pulling down Sherlock’s trousers and slowly sucking on his cock until he came with a cry, arching his back and spurting into his sire’s mouth. Then, John would feed him the rest of the bag after he’d come down from his orgasm. If Sherlock was bad and tried to be greedy with his blood, John would simply plant a gentle kiss on his cheek and walk off with the blood. Sherlock wouldn’t get to feed for another hour as punishment.
He took a deep breath, then smiled at the sound of harsh breaths coming from the other end of the phone. “Okay?”
“Don’t stop,” John told him in a groggy voice. That’s when Sherlock realized the best way to help his boy through the pain. If he could create enough endorphins running through John’s body, then maybe it would take away some of the pain he had caused.
“No, no, you’re alright, leave those on, John,” a hand rubbed over his clothed back and it wasn’t Sherlock’s, it wasn’t Sherlock’s and he was alone, he’d killed somebody and he was alone.
“John?” he took a step towards his boy, “I think I might actually need a shower, do you…um, well you don’t have to, but I’m sure you feel pretty gooey too. If you wanted I could wash you, you know like give you a massage. I’m sure your back is soar from lying on the couch. Like I said you don’t have to, but…” It amazed the detective how quickly John responded to him when the teen thought Sherlock was having second thoughts or nervous. If that was the case, he could provide a whole vat of honey for his little fly to feast on.
“I think so…ohhhhh,” just like that, understanding dawned on the Doctor and he had to force himself not to laugh. “You mean the part where he puts those worms in their ears to make them talk?”
“John!” he groaned loudly, pain evident in his voice. Sherlock gripped his chest and started shaking. “Please, I need John,” he cried.
John heard the sound of lube being squirted onto Sherlock’s hand, and that’s when the Doctor truly started to panic. He wasn’t prepared for Sherlock’s large cock. It was going to hurt, and Sherlock didn’t care as long as he had a place to come inside.
John continued looking back and forth between his immobilized limbs and the man relaying the story of what happened. “You were?”
“Don’t ever leave our sight, Molly, this is very important. You always hold one of our hands while we are in these houses. Do you understand?”
As time went on, John watched every single Sub go by. Some crawled, some walked with their heads hung low, but the one thing John did notice…
“John! I won’t tell you again,” Sherlock smacked him on the thigh again, bringing a comical image to John’s mind of Sherlock riding a horse and whipping it to go faster.
With those words and that beautiful mouth back on him, John could practically feel his come revving its engine in he bullocks to explode at any minute. Then, the mouth was gone again and something tight was pulled over the base of his cock. Pulled out of his blissful moment, the boy startled and looked down at Sherlock who was adjusting and inspecting the red ring, which was now tight around his flushed member. “Wh-What are you doing? Please, Sherlock, I need…I-“
“Don’t lie to me, Sherlock! I will help John but I need to know exactly what happened,” he was losing his temper, which thankfully…or not thankfully seemed to only happen when dealing with his brother.
“Hello, yes, Mr. Lestrade, I have Jim here at IBAD for you. Yes, I’ll put him on,” the woman said, handing John the phone.
“N-not helping,” John laughed again, looking up at the grinning man who rested his forehead on the teens.
Although he knew his efforts were eons too late and in vain, John panicked and bucked up his rear in an attempt to knock Sherlock off. However, the Sub realized that his thought process was working against him when he recognized his action would only spur Sherlock on as the Dom’s cock was right above him and...
Irene’s voice faded out as John did as instructed. He felt Sherlock holding him, cradling him in their bed. John loved waking up first thing in the morning when Sherlock was still unconsciously emitting bliss that the Sub just soaked up. Sherlock took care of him. Even when John didn’t want it, the man was always there for him, willing to offer as much bliss as the teenager wanted. It felt good. It felt safe. It made John feel whole.
“It is the hormones from the ventilation system, Sherlock, you know that,” Mycroft said, readjusting the straps to secure them properly.
This chapter has some dub-con verging on non-con oral sex, so please check the tags and know what you are about to read is dark and disturbing. If you've made it this far though, it is not as upsetting as the last two chapters.
The last thing Greg saw was the butt of a crossbow slamming into his face. He knew that was definitely not going leave a sexy scar.
“John Hamish Watson, a 16 year old Sub bravely rushed into a burning house to save his fellow Sub Jim Moriarty and his Dom Sherlock Holmes. All three are recuperating in the hospital, but doctors say they will be discharged within the week. The question is, however, how did the young Sub do it?” Mycroft finished reading, putting the newspaper back in his lap. He looked up at John, fixing the Sub with an unreadable stare.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the vampire, but nodded his head once. “I don’t see why you fight it so much. It’s obvious you love it by the way you couldn’t even control your lust.” He lifted his shirt up to reveal two reddish bruises forming on both his pale hipbones.
When John stepped out he realized where they were. “Sherlock, no!” John’s voice was shaking as he pulled on the lead with both hands. There was no way he was going into the kennels, no fucking way!
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand, and to the boy’s horror and secret glee, the man kissed his knuckles. After a brief moment, Sherlock placed John’s hand back in the water to continue covering himself. There was a bright smile on Sherlock’s face now, one John had never seen before. It was akin to Molly’s joyous expression when she had chocolate for the first time.
Unfazed, however, John went to the kitchen and opened the package, thankful that Sherlock had followed his advice and went to take a shower before bed. Pulling out a large aluminum packet, a large grin came across the Doctor’s face when he saw the one-inch white capsules covered in plastic. “Perfect,” he said, breaking off one perforated section and placing it in his pocket. Before going upstairs, John threw the box in the rubbish bin and placed the rest of the medicine in the freezer to keep it hard.
“Yes, I’m afraid it was a hit and run,” Mycroft explained, “the driver left his car and the Yard still hasn’t located him I’m afraid.”
This earned a barked laugh from Sherlock, though John had no idea what was so funny. “That’s not really his area, nor is it mine.” Sherlock nibbled on a piece of toast, spilling the crumbs everywhere.
“We’ll talk about all this once you get your collar removed. I don’t know what kind of listening devices could be in there. Our magnetic field disrupts any trackers, but not audio.”
“I’ve have a physical scheduled for John today. Then, if there is time, I’d like to check on a few cases. How’s Sebastian doing, any progress?”
“I have a much better chance of escaping than Molly, so if they stop me from leaving the house I want you to promise you won’t come back.”
“Good. Now, Anthea, please continue.” He motioned to the woman who stared at John a moment longer, then focused her attention back on the paper.
“Too idealistic?” John asked, picking up his cup and sipping the now cold tea. “I think this world needs a little bit of that right now.”
The mic was handed to a man in the audience who had a pen and paper in his hand. “This question is for John, if he may answer.”
John sat there, content that no one could hurt him while Mycroft answered questions about the new collar. Most of them were technical specifications, but John’s ears perked up when they were about him.
He gave a quick thanks to whoever was watching out for him that Sherlock still hadn’t come back, and quickly turned on the tap and began stripping out of his soiled clothes. It was surprising how much calmer his mind was that he was able to take of his clothes and get into the shower without the man’s piercing eyes watching him like a hawk. He worked the knob to adjust the water to warm but not hot, when he heard the older man come in with the extra towels. “You okay?”
Now though, John didn’t know what to say in response. He stared up at the ceiling too, hoping he would find the words like Sherlock had done. “Erm…it’s okay.”
He smiled at the way Sherlock seemed to curl around John’s body, his good hand on the boy’s ribs protectively, while the other was spread through short blonde hairs. The Dom’s knees were huddled up in the fetal position, with one leg over John’s good one.
“Sherlock!” Mycroft shouted as he and John burst through the door. Sherlock hissed at the human, then continued draining the nurse dry. John closed the door and took a deep breath, staring at the vampire he created.
“For right now, yes, and she will continue to be cared for unless you decide to run. Running,” Mycroft said, standing up from his chair and slowly walking over towards John, “is the only infraction, which will ruin young Molly’s chance at a comfortable life with kind Doms to take care of her. I want you to be honest John, no more manipulating or ‘playing’ submissive to work your way out of punishment. Your full cooperation is necessary if the results of this experiment are going to be accurate. Now, do I need to make a call and tell my people to send Molly to the auction house? I’m sure someone would love to have such a sweet-“
“Yes, I believe that is for the best,” Mycroft said, motioning them over to the door of the massive room.
John lowered himself down to a squat, and quietly made his way over to the door. He placed the side of his face against the wood and was pleasantly surprised when he could faintly hear people talking.
“So you took a feral Sub into your house, yes?” a woman from the crowd asked. “You weren’t afraid he would harm you in your sleep?”
“That’s his collar, John,” Sherlock said from the doorway. “It’s still very sensitive, so be careful.” With that, the Dom left the room and closed the door, no doubt going to the observation room with Mycroft.
“Your turn, John,” Mycroft said, patting the seat next to him as Sherlock scooted over, leaving a small space between the two brothers. “I need to clean and redress your burns. It needed to be done last night, but I opted to let you two sleep. Come,” he said, looking at John expectantly.
Sherlock didn’t understand until the boy spoke through endless sobs. “Y-You lied to m-m-me! Y-You said I was spe-special.”
Through all this, John continued to cry from someplace deep down inside where all his guilt and hatred lived. He hated his parents and those stupid collars, but most of all he hated himself. He let Mycroft and Jim get shot, he failed his sister and Mike, he held an innocent woman hostage just so he wouldn’t have to put on a lead. It was his fault, and his alone.
“Okay,” was all he could manage, still confused but would accept it if that was what Sherlock wanted. After all, Sherlock was a zillion times smarter than everyone so he must have a plan, John realized, smiling a bit to himself at the thought.
“Right, in you go,” Sherlock picked him up again, bringing a loud embarrassing squeal and a bright red blush all along John’s face and chest. He stayed suspended in the air until the older man sat down in the shallow water, placing John in between his legs and lifting his casted leg and arm onto the tub edge where he realized towel cushions had seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Sherlock squirmed under him, making John feel like a rag doll as he was pulled and placed until his head was lying on the man’s chest; his good leg all the way up to the top of his stomach was sitting below the surface of the warm soapy water.
John sat quietly in his booth, sipping on a dark ale and watching the patrons interactions. He loved watching people, especially in pubs where they were at their most honest. Over the past hundred years or so, John had learned how to pick the best target for dinner. It wasn’t hard when there were at least ten drunk people who wouldn’t be able to remember why their neck hurt in the morning.
John growled. He wanted to just take, and now Sherlock was stopping him. It took everything he had to fight off his predatory need, and be patient with the human who had already made his way to the center of the spider web. “Why’s that, love?” John purred, keeping his finger circling Sherlock’s hole while he kissed along the man’s back.
“John,” Mycroft said, his voice not as annoyed as John thought it would be. “It’s very complicated, but if you are good while we go over Saturday’s schedule, I’ll explain it to you. Deal?”
“But…”John lowered his head. This conversation hadn’t gone anywhere near how he thought it would. Sherlock was mad at him and both Greg and Mycroft are telling him he’s naive and stupid. John just knew there had to be some way to get his idea out there and start a revolution.  “But it’s not fair,” was all he could come up with.
“That’s it,” Sherlock said in a long exhale as his hands met at the base of John’s spine. The teenager shivered slightly at the contact, still on edge, prepared for anything and unwilling to relax in case the man above him attempted to use his domination to question him about the other Subs.
“Umm, yeah,” John nodded in agreement. His school work was the only connection to the outside world really, at least until Sherlock decided to trust him enough to take him outside. Hell, the Detective still checked over his homework, discreetly of course, to make sure he wasn’t sending secret messages. John had never tried though, was too scared of other people getting involved in this…whatever it was. If he reached out to anyone, he knew they would share Mary’s fate. “I’m almost done though.”
“Which might explain why you are trying to manipulate me,” Dr. Magnussen said. John opened his mouth to deny the accusations but what came out was a blood curdling scream. His mind finally caught up to his pain receptors when he realized the Dom had ripped out the collar and was now inspecting it curiously. “I told them it wouldn’t work. Reading Sub’s hormone levels? Peh!” The man sounded rather disgusted by the whole thing, though not for the reasons John would have hoped. “I must say, Mycroft will be very displeased when he learns his little charity case ripped off his own collar.”
“Sh-Sherlock, I-I…I understand,” he forced out while the knot in his throat grew larger. With a final kiss, just below his left eye, John realized he would never be alone again in carrying his weight.
She sighed once, answering him as she turned her back like it was nothing, “he said he would wait,” it was everything.
“I see,” the voice chuckled behind him, which created goosebumps on the boy’s skin at the thought of making his Dom laugh. “What if I ‘asked’ you to tell me about the others, hmm? Would you do that for me, John?”
“Yes,” everyone said in unison, nodding their heads nervously. It wasn’t the first time they’d robbed houses and it most certainly wouldn’t be the last. Taking from the rich was the only way to survive under the radar and away from the clutches of a Master. Not the best life, John could admit to himself, but it was much better to be a runaway than a pet at someone’s feet who could be forced into a drugged haze at any time.
“Y-Yes, sir,” John said, not meeting the old man’s gaze. His body was a giant bundle of nerves, making his entire body shake
“Subs don’t get organ donations,” John said angrily, lowering his head. The room was silent for a long moment, as all men knew what John said was true.
John only nodded in the grip, then averted his eyes. After a moment, Sherlock let go and placed an arm around John, pulling him in close whether the teenager liked it or not. They sat that way until the car finally stopped and Sherlock clipped the ever-dreaded lead to his collar.
After his ‘break down’ as Dr. Landbury, the child psychiatrist, had called it, they told John they didn’t have any more questions. “Why did you try to hurt yourself on the table, John,” the lady asked, smiling with her clipboard in hand and one knee crossed over the other. John tried not to laugh at the stereotypical therapist spiel as he sat in an overstuffed chair that made him sink down too far.
“John, don’t!” He head Sherlock shout at him, as if the man could see the half-baked plan coming to fruition.
Sherlock looked pensively at John for a long moment before he crawled onto the bed and yanked the teen up to lay beside him. John squirmed against the two hands around his stomach and the chest at his back until he realized it was useless even on his best day. “You’re Subs, John, I can’t change that. All I can do is make life easier for you…make it so you never have to suffer again.”
“Oh my God,” John whimpered to himself, thankful that Sherlock held him close, protecting him from all the Doms.
When he looked at John splayed out on Sherlock’s chest, he saw that teddy bear so long ago being suffocated by his brother’s relentless hold. Mycroft knew events were unpredictable, even more so when dealing with Sherlock, so he took it upon himself to give John a steady platform to jump onto if things went south. “I will leave my number in your mobile in case you ever need to get in touch with me, yes? Sherlock, walk me out,” he said, nodding once to the boy and leaving him to his fate.
Moving quickly to avoid any protest from his lover, John began licking slowly along the crack, only dipping his tongue in between the cheeks ever so slightly. Sherlock moaned again and, John happily noted, removed his hands from his ears in favor of clutching the sheets. “M-more,” the detective tried to demand but turned into more of a pleading whimper. John took pity on him and gripped the two cheeks, pulling them apart slightly and finally…finally swirled his wet tongue around the needy clenching hole of his husband.
That’s when John realized it was he who was holding the gun, not Lestrade. He tried to lower it, but something in his muscles wouldn’t allow it.
“Mary! Oh fuck, Mary!” A voice Sherlock vaguely recognized shouted, followed by a grunt and high pitched shout. The banging halted and all that filled the flat was panting.
John grinned, blushing at the complement from a seventeen year old, knowing the bloke was just trying to be nice.
“Sherlock, come,” his brother ordered, as if Sherlock was a young Sub. Usually he would scoff and do the complete opposite to make a point that his older brother had no say in what he did, but right now, he needed to get to his computer and start going through the surveillance tapes. Sherlock lifted up his nose as he followed behind Greg towards the house.
At his touch, John calmed considerably, making a small smile come across the Dom’s face. He relished in the fact that his Sub, his John, settled by his touch and his bliss. That’s all he ever wanted for the boy; from the first time he tried to attack him, that’s all Sherlock wanted for the boy, peace. The memory of John, who seemed so much smaller and younger back then, coming at him with the tact of a baby kitten, made Sherlock’s smile widen even more.
“If what I’ve been told is correct, then all the Subs are just children. Then if this is true, I can personally guarantee that they will all go to good homes with Doms who are pro research for Subs suffering from RDD. All-“
John screamed again, and screamed, and screamed, and screamed against the skin keeping his voice from being heard.
He found what he needed by slamming hard into John’s prostate and sliding his thumb over the moist head. John came with a shout, spilling and clenching in tandem, which forced Sherlock’s body to tighten. Two more thrusts had Sherlock was coming hard, shooting spurt after spurt of his seed into John’s willing hole.
John had killed someone. Someone who was about to kill Sherlock, yes, but that still didn’t change the fact he had pulled the trigger and now there was a man lying dead on the ground.
“Eat, John,” they both said in tandem, causing John to accidentally drop his fork from the overwhelming sense of numbness in his extremities.
“Sherlock’s sleeping,” John told Mycroft as he kneeled by the man. There was a bit of life coming back to the man’s eyes. The glass of juice was empty and the wounds Sherlock inflicted were completely healed, if not a bit bruised. Everything was okay, no one died and everything was fucking okay.
“Ah, Sherlock, glad you’re here,” a man wearing a suit said, motioning them over. “It’s happened again; same method, same profile, same everything. Two parents killed and one child left alive, a boy this time, Archibald Clemmons age ten, but still the same history as the others.”
John walked slowly into the bedroom, grabbing the letter opener, which Sherlock had left on the bed after their scuffle, and placed it between his hip and the elastic of his trousers. He would show them what a Sub was capable of, even if it meant blood needed to be shed.
“I understand John, it’s okay to be nervous in new situations. Quite honestly, I’m a bit shaken too.” The man whispered, looking down and letting go of the chin in his grasp.
John growled viciously, then threw Sherlock at the wall. “Leave,” he said and rolled over on the bed, pulling the comforter up around him.
“You were robbing us,” Sherlock argued, closing his eyes as John started to work the soap into the brown curls, building up a lather.
“Fine,” John rolled his eyes but squatted down and snuck into the quiet house without another word. As he made his way through the kitchen and into the living room, John could see the people running around frantically through the window. He smiled despite himself and kept moving, trying to figure out where they would keep her.
There were glimpses, little flickers, which made the lights shine bright in his mind palace when he saw his John come out, becoming completely vulnerable. It was those moments when John would ask him not to leave the bed, or to hold him just a moment longer that drove Sherlock’s mind to find the quickest and most painless way to once and for all rid the thoughts plaguing his boy’s mind. Then, as proof that the Gods were still on his side, a plan arose, dropping right into his lap in the form of four serial murders.
The man laughed along with John’s bashfulness, “thanks, I try,” he said, adding in a hint of humor to once again lighten the mood. “You know, I’m that big right now. Are you…are you hard too?” He laced his voice with uncertainty, drawing John in like a moth to a flame.
“You are home, John,” Sherlock smiled at him like he did when they were kissing on the couch and when he looked at him naked for the first time in the shower. If it wasn’t for that smile, John would have ran for the door without a second though, but instead he only scooted his chair back from the table.
“Okay,” John said again. He was still getting used to the blinking line in his view, but John made an effort to look at the woman in the eye.
“No, not rubbish at all my dear John, beautiful,” Sherlock could feel is cock swell, whether from the new picture of his John or because he knew he had him.
“Come,” Mycroft said, letting his threat hand in the air. They walked out of the building quickly, John finding it much easier to walk without arm restraints. “In you go,” he opened the back door, placing a hand in the center of John’s spine. Sherlock walked around to the other side before he got in to meet John on the other side. The younger Dom pulled him in, placing an arm around his shoulder as to not jostle the Sub around too much.
“It’s okay, love,” Sherlock comforted his boy as he went over to sit next to him, getting a good look at the slightly tented blanket, indicating John was still hard and wanting from their earlier love making. He put his arm behind John’s back, scooting him over to lie partially on his own chest. “This is my brother, Mycroft, he wanted to meet you,” he felt the boy relax a tad as he held him but when the elder Holmes took a step forward, John stiffened again.
“John?” The man called, taking a few steps towards him, “I think I might actually need a shower, do you…um, well you don’t have to, but I’m sure you feel pretty gooey too. If you wanted I could wash you, you know like give you a massage. I’m sure your back is soar from lying on the couch. Like I said you don’t have to, but…”
The small boy was in a drug induced sleep and would be for another six hours. Sherlock had injected Archie with a homemade sedative and the boy was out like a light. It was perfect and soon, John would come home and realize how much he needs this life, how much he needs Sherlock. The plan was perfect and John was perfect; there was no way he could fail.
“Freeze!” an unexpected voice shouted. Sherlock looked up to see an injured Greg running into the room, his gun drawn on the two rolling masses on the floor. “I said freeze!” he shouted again and fired his gun at the roof, causing both boys to stop and look up. “John, get up and walk over to me,” Greg said, commanding the room better than Sherlock would have thought. Perhaps this would go much easier than he thought it would. The sooner he could get John home, the sooner he could fuck the boy senseless.
“Seeing as how upsetting it was for you to be dressed in the hospital, I took the liberty of changing your clothes while you were down,” Sherlock said as he walked to the other side of the bed. He too was dressed in sleep trousers and a grey shirt, except his was much longer than Johns.
“That was…that was bloody amazing,” John said, in awe but completely freaked out at the display of an almost omnipotent nature.
When he double clicked in the URL address bar at the top of the screen, a list of frequently visited sites popped up, the chat room where they first met showing at the very bottom of the list.
He quickly typed in the name Sherlock under the number. Without hesitating John replied with his name.
“You will obey me John,” Sherlock snapped and with the speed of a cobra, he grabbed the boy’s arm, yanked him down to the bed, and straddled him with all the weight of his body stemming through his hands onto John’s chest. “I know what kind of darkness is out there, John. You have no idea, no idea what this man is capable of…you have no idea what I am capable of!” He shouted down at the boy as the violent storms racked through his brain, flooding the avenues and demolishing the cities. “Why can’t you see I’m trying to protect you from him, from me. I will kill you before I let him touch you, John!”
“Calm yourself,” Mycroft said, glancing at the heart monitor, which was beeping a tad faster. “The time will come when you will be required to talk to the press, but now is not it. I will see to it that you have proper recovery time and you will not overexert yourself, is that understood?”
Sherlock finally made it down the stairs, his erection flagging enough under his robe so it wasn’t the first thing greeting his brother. Mycroft Holmes stood in the center of the living room, twirling his umbrella in one hand and holding a stack of papers in the other. Sherlock slowed down his pace, keeping his face neutral as his older brother stared daggers at him. “Sherlock, please tell me you do not have John Watson in your room,” Mycroft got straight to the point, which for all his faults, eating everything in sight being one of them, Sherlock admired his brother’s bluntness. Although, he would never tell him that of course, after all, you don’t compliment your archenemy.
“John already knows I had planned to keep him from the moment I first saw him. I don’t keep secrets from him anymore. John and I love each other, which is something you will never understand.” Sherlock said, lifting his chin in both smugness and defiance. He had had enough of this game, and if the sounds outside the building were anything to go by, Mycroft had located them.
With that, Greg left the room and closed the door, leaving John and Sherlock alone in the room together. “Sherlock, I’m…I’m-“
Without thinking, Sherlock dropped the laptop, which he would burn later, and sprinted up after the wayward teenager. Hopefully, he would be able to talk some since into him and salvage a month’s worth of hard work. “John!” he shouted when he saw the skinnier leg give way under the force of the boy’s running. In one swift movement, with both John’s safety and knowing this was the best way to rebuild trust on his mind, Sherlock leapt up three steps and caught the falling boy in his arms. His back hit the wall but their descent had been halted and now John continued to struggle in the make shift bear hug he’d used to catch him.
Of course there is a touch of Stockholm Syndrome in there too, but this is taking it a step further, where Sherlock is actually 'infecting' John. So anyways, yeah, this is pretty fucked up and I'm sorry...not really(:
“Hey there, you all right?” John asked, taking a few steps closer. The best thing about being a vampire was that he was never scared of anyone. This guy could be crazy, but it didn’t matter, he couldn’t hurt a vampire.
“I know, Molly,” John leaned down a bit, taking off his worn wool hat and placing it on her head, earning a grin from the girl. “But we are going to find a nice house to stay in tonight, one with some soup that we can make later and maybe even some sweeties. Now, do you remember what Harry told you?”
“Sherlock? Yeah, he’s fine. It’s a little trick my sire used on me once or twice.” John gave a sad smile, reminiscing. He had lived a long time, and far too many of those years were lived alone without anyone to watch his back.
Sherlock finished up the note, looked it over to make sure every letter was perfect and then brought it into where John was still sleeping soundly. He placed his gloved hands over the boy’s soft shoulders and ran them up and down a few times, feeling the warm friction they created together. Pushing back the wonderful thought of having John drugged and pliant under him and ready for the taking, Sherlock worked meticulously placing the boy’s finger prints all over the note, the envelope, and finally pulling out the small tongue and licking the adhesive. “Good boy John,” he whispered down with a sweet smile.
This chapter doesn't have any explicit material but still deals with disturbing behavior and subject matter.
After a few moments, John was able to collect himself and continue on trying to get his ridiculous husband to take the freaking ear drops. “Okay, okay, I’m sorry, so let me see if I understand. You are scared-“
However, thoughts of his mates sleeping in the cold, starving, just as he had done to avoid situations like this started to return, making the food churn in his stomach. He would rather starve than be hand fed delicious food,
“I’m fine, Gary,” Sherlock said, flopping back down in his chair and looking up at the ceiling. He never noticed how great it was, how ceiling-y.
Sherlock sat on their bed, gazing over John’s limp body with a slight frown on his face. He didn’t understand why the boy had become so hostile all of the sudden and even went as far to say he didn’t belong at Baker Street. At that moment, Sherlock had realized how much he actually loved John. Anybody who could cause his heart to ache just from an angry look and a few harsh words was very special indeed. He stroked a hand through the youth’s blonde hair as he injected a small dose of the same sedative he had given him the other morning. However, this would only keep him asleep for two hours, providing enough time to put on the plaster gauze and let it harden. Sherlock had always kept gypsum powder and impregnated bandages near his experiments, just in case he needed to make a cast molding of evidence. Now, he could use it to make a molding to hold his John together.
“Shut up!” John shouted, his erection still hadn’t flagged, especially now when Sherlock was practically purring on the other side of the curtain.
When he put down his phone, Sherlock licked his lips and grinned wildly down at the picture of John’s cock, knowing that tomorrow it would be in his mouth. He pulled the computer onto his lap and began researching The London Metropolitan University scholarships to print out. After five minutes, the detective had a stack bigger than ‘War and Peace’ sitting beside the printer. “That should be enough,” he smiled to himself happily, knowing that him and John would start to fill them out at the coffee shop down the road but then his boy would become tired and they would have to come back to his flat to finish. However, they were all valid scholarships he knew would benefit the teenager, after all only the best would do for his John.
“John,” was all Sherlock could say because that’s all that mattered, in that moment and forever. John, a child, had saved him from the worst monster of all, himself.  Suddenly, the brave face turned into a crumbling mess, breaking right in front of his eyes. In two long steps, the death on his hands gone, Sherlock grabbed the tight shivering ball and held John to his chest, hushing him. “Shhh, you were such a brave boy, John. I need you to do one more thing for me, can you do that, can you listen to me?” He received a small nod and continued. “I shot Moriarty while you hid under the blankets, do you understand me?” This was the way it was supposed to be, had to be. Inevitably, Mrs. Hudson or someone else in a nearby building heard the shots and Lestrade would come and question them. This chapter was over but it was still his job to take care of John, that was his promise, his one purpose no longer controlled by the darkness.
“Good night,” John sighed, scooting deeper into his sleeping bag, letting the warmth protect him. It took another hour and a half for the teen to finally fall asleep, every breaking branch or car passing by made John opened his eyes, preparing himself to fight off any intruders. Finally, he closed his eyes and let a light sleep take him until dawn.
“Arseholes,” Sherlock mumbled under his breath. He held his stomach with both hands, grunting and growling every time the car jostled.
The inside looked just like an office building, but a bit grungier, as if the place was abandoned and then repurposed. “Irene’s waiting for you two,” the man said, keeping a hold on one of John’s straps, just in case the Sub tried to bolt.
“No, no, I didn’t mean that, it’s just that you’ve never done anything with a guy before have you? No, so it’s kind of hard to explain to someone who is inexperienced.”
The man worked clinically though and gently put John back into his pants and trousers, then pulled him in close for a warm hug.
Fearful but curious of what Mycroft told the cabbie, John gave one last look at Sherlock and then walked towards the car. “Thanks,” John whispered. It was strange, but as he thought back, he realized no one, let alone a rich Dom, had ever held open a door specifically for him
“Is…” Greg swallowed, squeezing his eyes together from shock and perhaps a little bit of pain, “he okay?”
It wasn't until lunch when John discreetly checked his phone, almost bouncing in excitement when he saw there were four unread texts.
“That’s very generous of you, Mr. Holmes,” the lady nodded and smiled, “can I help you with something today, or are you just here for rounds?”
, John kept repeating in his head. His back was facing the person he was supposed to hate and the thing was, he wanted to be there with Sherlock. To be vulnerable and safe at the same time, just like he was when Sherlock was spanking him. His Dom never truly hurt him,
The worst part about the day was when John was at school and Lestrade had no cases for him. His mind began turning in on itself, attacking like a civil war was breaking out among his consciousness. To shut it off, he pulled up his favorite picture of the blonde boy, shimmied out of his trousers and started rubbing himself slowly. Filling his spastic mind up with pictures of himself over John, under him, spooning him, inside him, soaking up his innocent cries, and then in record time he came all over his hand groaning with a sated smile on his lips. His mind was calm.
“No John, when they ask you what happened, you tell them you didn’t see anything because you were hiding under the covers, tell me you understand,” he held on to John, stroked his hair for what he knew would be his last time. “I’m going to text Mycroft now, okay,” Sherlock grabbed his mobile from his pocket.
“Yeah, while I was doped up!” John snapped and pulled on a pair of checkered sleep trousers. Lastly, he put on a black long sleeved shirt and hung up his towel. “You just don’t get it, Sherlock.” John shook his head and opened the door, only to be stopped by a hand on his shoulder.
With that, John logged off the chat room and closed his laptop, a giant grin on his face. Grabbing his mobile off the desk, he started to type in the boy’s phone number. Before he could finish, however, a text message popped up labeled ‘unknown.’ Sure enough, when John opened the message it was footballer’s number.
“Be that as it may, it will be a perfect time to promote the collar and possibly save some Subs,” Mycroft said, standing up. “It’s best you two take it easy for the rest of the day.” With that, Mycroft left the room.
“That’s not why he did it, Sherlock,” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration, concern, and uncertainty broadcasted from his movements. “Do you not even realize how much your tampering with his mind affected the poor boy? John thinks you are in jail and he actually blames himself. Now tell me, Sherlock, use that brilliant brain of yours and deduce what kind of mind set someone has to have to think like that? To blame themselves even when it is blatantly obvious they had nothing to do with the outcome? My God, Sherlock, look at the evidence of what you’ve done,” Mycroft shook his head, a shocked smile on his face that meant John’s actions had even awed him.
His boy’s displeasure opened a door of opportunity and Sherlock took it with the swiftness of a snake striking its prey.
“John, John my love, you need to wake up,” came the voice, slowly lifting him from his deep forest of bliss out above the canopy of trees and into the warm sun. He felt warm, he felt safe, he felt happy, and he felt good as he finally opened his eyes to see two silver irises staring back at him. Something, maybe fear, scratched at the back of his consciousness when he gazed into those eyes but the unconditional love John could feel washed away any negative thoughts…and he felt good.
The vampire stared at the contraption for a moment, then decided it was better to just break the thing before it shot a net at him. John lifted his foot and brought it down hard on the toy. “John, NO!” he heard Greg shout from the other side of the room. It was too late.
‘WAKE UP, JOHN’ the green writing read. ‘FOCUS.’ John didn’t know why they were telling him to get out of such an amazingly calm state. ‘I KNOW IT FEELS GOOD, BUT YOU NEED TO FOCUS. WAKE UP.’ John groaned and dug his face deeper into Sherlock’s chest when he felt the cold winter air hit him.
“I can…” John said sleepily. “I can take care of myself.” He could, of course he could, he had been doing it since he was ten years old. Now though…well, now things had changed. He had people who fed him and kept him warm and safe. There was still much to do though, John knew. He had to worry about Harry, Mike, Jim, and Molly, had to help IBAD track down the Rebels who blew up his home, and now he had to figure out how Subs creating bliss was a positive to Doms. But for right now, John supposed he could sit here for a while longer, letting Sherlock rub his belly and feed him.
“I am not like you. You treat yours like they are nothing but vessels for your pleasure, like they are nothing. I love John and I would do anything,” Sherlock sat forward in his chair, assuring the other man that ‘anything’ meant killing, “to protect him from the bad things in this world.”
John whimpered slightly as they walked up the stairs to the main level. Not only had the anxiety built up for the exam, but now there was no doubt a very angry red haired Dom was waiting for them at the top of the steps. As a Sub, John knew he was always going to be the one to take the blame, even if Sherlock did take him down there on purpose. His fears were justified when he felt an overwhelming sense to go down to his knees and hide behind the taller, bigger man next to him. Mycroft was angry, livid in fact, and John could feel it just as he felt his own heart beat increase pace in his chest. “Keep your mouth shut,” Sherlock’s voice was serious, but the smirk on his face told John just how funny the Dom thought he was.
John walked next to Sherlock with his head down in embarrassment, while Mycroft walked a few steps ahead, confident that the Sub couldn’t attack his blind spot. John just burrowed farther into his toasty jacket and tried to ignore that he was being led by a piece of leather.
When they first walked in, John noted an odd chemical smell just before he was hit with a wave of bliss so powerful his legs completely gave out. He whined through the mask, trying to catch his breath but breathing through his nose wasn’t doing the trick. “What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, though John had the feeling he was more intrigued than worried. As Sherlock went to take the muzzle from John’s face, the elder Holmes stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
He gently pulled back the duvet and caressed the two small orbs of Archie’s bum. The pale flesh felt amazing in his palm, but it was missing something.
He had no idea what was wrong with the normally cuddle and touch obsessed Dom. “Well, goodnight,” John said, scooting over a tiny bit towards Sherlock so he didn’t fall of the bed.
With that, John jumped out of bed and made sure his gown was tied in the back, because the last thing a spy needed was to have his bum exposed for everyone to see. He made his way to the door and poked his head out to find the hallway empty save for a few nurses running from room to room.
John was about to open his mouth to protest at being talked about like he wasn’t there but when the man named Mycroft turned his gaze upon him, John couldn’t help but lower his and continue eating. “And you propose this…feral Submissive will provide us more useful information than the two hundred we hold at our facility, is that right Sherlock?”
“I know what kind of bugs are out there John. I knew it back when I was a child and I know even more now. Who knows what it is that chemical abomination you want to put in my ear, which, in case you didn’t know, leads straight to my brain. My hard drive!” Sherlock huddled up into himself again, rolling over into the fetal position on the couch.
“Oh…umm, about what?” the boy stuttered out, deliberately trying to keep his eyes off the thick bulge in Sherlock’s trousers.
“Don’t move your hips, John. We wouldn’t want to mess up,” Sherlock whispered, moving his hips up to grip the boy’s hips, making them immobile. Just as he was about to turn on the laser and make contact, John bit down on Sherlock’s forearm. It hurt but Sherlock only held on tighter, feeling as if the circle was being completed as John marked him as well. The bite only grew stronger as Sherlock turned on the laser, starting with the curves of the ‘S.’ John was using him as a mouth bit, transferring his pain over for Sherlock to take and devour so it never bothered any of them again. That was his job now, and he would do it for his John. “That’s it, just a little more, John, just a little more.” Sherlock kept repeating how brave he was being, how much he loved him all the while blood began dripping down his forearm from the boy’s powerful jaws.
“I used my own bliss. Irene taught me how to do it, and it worked! I was able to go through the surgery without being put under.”
“We’ll get her back, Jim, I promise. I’m so sorry, I…I don’t know what happened back there,” John held back the shiver threatening his spine when he thought back to how much effect that man had on him. How strongly he wanted to submit for the first time since he had bloomed at five years old. He held Jim for a moment longer until the smaller Sub finally relaxed a bit and discretely wiped away his tears on John’s jacket.
I wanted to give you all an early update this week. I'm going to try and get another chapter up by Sunday or Monday, so you can have two for the week.
The man patting Molly’s head chuckled quietly, while the other, older man, only tilted his head with a tight lipped smile on his face. “Are you sure about that, John?” He said, taking a step closer, resulting in John taking a step back until he hit the wall.
The man sounded sincere, but John knew how good Doms were at lying. It was strange though that Greg had not tried to Dom him. It probably wouldn’t have worked, as John was in a hyperaware state, ready for anything to come at him—but still.
Suddenly, he was being flipped over, his casted leg and arm settled in a new position but he couldn’t feel any pain coming from the injuries. “As you wish John,” he heard Sherlock whisper from behind him and that’s when he felt wet fingers circling his arse. He was still sore from the days before but soon he found his new position allowed him to thrust his frustrated cock against the sheets in an attempt to relieve the pressure. When a finger slipped in, it didn’t hurt but still felt strange and foreign to him but that was okay because the sight of his orgasm was near, so, so near.
Panicked, John looked around for a weapon and found a sharp looking scalpel on a tray. He picked it up and then looked at the nurse who shook her head as if reading his mind. “I’m sorry. I’m not going to hurt you, I promise,” John said before quickly wrapping an arm around her chest and holding the sharp instrument just under her ribs. The young woman squirmed a bit and started to cry, but stilled when the door opened.
Breathing deeply, John ignored what Sherlock’s presence and voice was doing to him, and continued to wash his hair.
“Mycroft, must you be so intolerable?” Sherlock shouted from the kitchen, making John’s mind click the name into place.
“Ahhh!” John heard someone groan from down the alley way. That’s when he smelled it, blood. John slowly made his way down between the brick walls to find a young man, who appeared to be homeless hunched over on the ground.
“A’right mate, we’re ‘ere,” the cabbie said, turning around and quirking an eye brow at the two men.
“Don’t,” John growled. It burned something terrible to have such a bright light shone directly into his superior eyes. John knew how much better he could see, how heat signatures of where blood was located filled his vision.
Out of nowhere, John reached out and grabbed the collar of Sherlock’s shirt. “Maybe I should just kill you. Save us both a lot of trouble, eh?”
“He’s fine, Mycroft, don’t get your knickers in a bunch. I’ll talk to Greg, I already know where their little hideout is, quite obvious if you weren’t so-“
“Alright then, dear, you feel better,” she said and actually petted him on the head. If it wasn’t so degrading it would’ve felt pretty nice.
When they arrived at the bedroom, Sherlock herded John over to the bed and sat him down. Sherlock had brought John button up shirts to the hospital, aware of how horrible it must have been to not be able to wear his own clothes. Plus, it was easier to take them off without hurting his injured arm.
However, it wasn’t only the way Sherlock’s movements had become more fluid instead of sharp or his eyes stayed on him instead of dart around, looking for threats or God knows what, no, it was his voice and the different tone he used when he talked about John that convinced Mycroft the boy might be better off at Baker Street. If John was the teddy bear then anyone who tried to hurt him would get a sucker punch to the stomach or most likely worse now that Sherlock had access to guns.
His whole body tingled and his cock was still hard in his pants from the adrenaline pumping through his veins.
“That’s not what I meant, you stupid infuriating boy!” Sherlock growled at him. John couldn’t help but shrink back a little from the anger of the man. If this was how Sherlock wanted to play it, then by all means John would show him he wouldn’t back down from something so important.
Sherlock smiled, actually happy that he had misread the situation. The lights inside his mind glowed dimly at the new found information, and Sherlock was getting harder by the minute. He needed John now, hard and fast against the floor, but he knew if what the boy said was true, then he would need to work fast.
“No, I would imagine not,” Mycroft said, placing a hand on John’s knee. John noticed how the Doms always had a hand on him. Whether his back, his neck, or even his knee, it seemed like they were always touching him.
“He’s sleeping with you brother dear,” he said, his voice dripping with faux generosity. “In case he is in another biting mood, I do not wish to wake up with any of my appendages missing. You are responsible for feeding him, bathing him, and putting him to bed. I, however, will be responsible for punishment, seeing as you lack the ability to discipline young John here.”
“Indeed,” Mycroft said again, though this time his tone was rather annoyed. “Now, we are leaving in ten minutes whether you are naked or clothed, so I suggest you hurry.” The older Dom left the room with a dramatic flair that rivaled that of his younger brother’s.
“Well I’ll be damned,” John stoked his chin, wishing he could grow a goatee and pondering what all this meant. If the press found out two Doms, especially two male Doms, were fooling around it would be a field day. Not to mention Greg works for Mycroft.

Maneuvering himself from under John and dressing the seared wound, Sherlock hummed softly to lull his boy back to sleep. After John was tucked back in, lying on his side and supported by a barricade of pillows to insure he wouldn’t roll over and hurt himself, Sherlock carried the laser pen and his kit back into the bathroom. As he sat on the edge of the tub, Sherlock wiped the sweat off his right shoulder. It would be tricky to place a ‘JW’ using his left hand but he had thought long and hard about the location of John’s mark for him and had decided to choose his right side where John always rested his head. It would be a perfect display to both of them how much they were two halves of a whole.
That is why only a day later Mycroft wasn’t surprised when Anthea brought him a file on a fourteen year old boy from Southampton named John Hamish Watson.
“Rest, Sherlock, you’ve earned it,” John said softly, standing up even slower. He cupped the younger vampire’s cheek, caressing the pale flesh gently with his thumb.
He figured he looked like a beached fish flopping and shivering around on the bed but none of that matter, at least not when the loud moans above him approved so wholly of his actions. “Mine!” Sherlock shouted and then there were warm streaks hitting his belly, chest, and face. When John opened his eyes he saw pearly white come spread over him and a large leaking cock deflating in Sherlock’s hand. He was marked,
One more note, Ignorance was Bliss is not a Muse song, but I really liked the title so I used it, so don't be surprised if you can't find it.
Just a warning, this chapter has some explicit material at the end but nothing as bad as the first part of the series.
The old vampire chuckled and shook his head. “In a couple of hours we’ll do it again, but next time we’re going to stop several times.”
“I…thank you for the offer, but…” John paused, swallowing the dry pit in his throat. “I have to stay with Sherlock.”
“I’ll protect Sherlock,” Greg said just as John was about to close the door to the bedroom. “I’ll…They won’t hurt him, not if I have anything to say about it.” The human’s words were true, naive, but true.
“Sherlock,” John said, propping himself up on one elbow, “neither of those sound good. Subs aren’t just something you can control by putting a collar on them. We’re people, not some horse you need to break in.”
“Yeah, these people had everything we needed! Guess what, it was even sitting out on the counter top, like it was just begging to be taken,” Harry laughed, excited at how full her tote was.
John woke up with his head on a soft, warm lap and a soothing hand running down his arm. He blinked a couple of times, clearing his vision, then decided to tell Sherlock to stop touching him. He opened his mouth…or, at least he tried to open his mouth, but it seemed something was stopping him.
I went a bit off track, but I promise Greg will be in the next chapter. Sorry, I just get excited when I write fluff and angst(:
Mycroft actually smiled with triumph but then frowned at his new data. John was too kind, too brave, too loyal, too caring; it’s what drew Sherlock to him in the first place and why he was so affected by the boy’s presence
John had learned over the years that Sherlock couldn’t quite shut off the rapid information running through his mind. It didn’t really bother him, in fact he thought it was rather sexy, but what was even better than that was being able to make him shut up. Doing just that, John took the large cock all the way into his throat, gagging slightly and pulling back a touch, then swallowing right before he gave a loud humming sound in the back of his throat. He smiled around his husband’s member, as soon as said husband lost his words and could only moan and chant his name.
Sherlock still tasted like fire. Like smoke and burning cedar, but his lips were something akin to cinnamon. John sighed a little, letting his hand rest on Sherlock’s pale chest. Then, going against all his survival instincts had ever taught him, John let his Dom in. He opened his mouth slightly, letting Sherlock’s tongue in to explore his mouth. The man was gentle, oh was he gentle, as he caressed the back of John’s head and moved his tongue slowly against the roof of the Sub’s mouth.
NOTICE: This Chapter has been updated due to the fact I had no idea 14 year olds could drink in their homes in the UK. One of my amazing readers let me know, so I thought it was important and small enough to change easily. Only one paragraph has changed so if you've already read it, you're not missing anything new, except Britain is awesome(:
“He’s fine, John. Please, try and relax,” Mycroft said, placing the water back on the table and once again fixing his icy stare on John. “You are safe, as is my brother, which…which is why I am here.” Mycroft sighed and pursed his lips together, not sure of what he was about to say.
“Hi,” John whispered, giving the man a sleepy smile, not caring to wake up yet from what had to be the best dream he’d ever had. He racked his foggy brain to try and remember the last time he’d ever woken up feeling this…
With one last pat to the boy’s bare chest, Sherlock began preparing his work station. He laid flannels and towels on the other side of the bed, rolling John over to lie on top so plaster wouldn’t spill on the bed. Next, he brought over a tray with the rolls of plaster soaked gauze, a bowl of water to trigger the chemical reaction, scissors, and some soft cotton cloth to protect his boy’s delicate skin from the gypsum.
By the time he had put his pajamas on, making sure to choose one with pockets to put the capsule in, Sherlock was dragging his feet over to the bed. He looked exhausted, making John’s heart melt recalling how his husband is usually a ball of energy right before bed. “Come to bed, I’ll give you a nice back massage to help you fall asleep, how does that sound?”
When the young vampire finally came back to reality, he was being held around the waist by John and Greg was pressed back against the door like he’d just seen a ghost. Sherlock was breathing hard and he could feel that his fangs had dropped.
Sherlock found himself rubbing slow circles with his thumb on John’s scalp. It was quite soothing, and John’s eyes began flutter. “You really think I wanted to know how violent my entire body is, including my blood? You think I need reminding what a monster I am? Jesus, Sherlock, just do your tests and leave me alone.”
After the sigh, he made his move, adding slight pressure on the boys cheek so he couldn’t pull away from the man’s lips. Sherlock started slowly, coaxing the teen into the act with soft gently touches, until he heard another moan and began deepening the possession he had over John’s lips. Giving a few licks to the small puckered lips, as a request for entrance, Sherlock almost tackled the boy right then when he opened so beautifully without hesitation.
When John drank from him, it was the most sensual, fulfilling feeling in the entire world. The slight suction and draw of blood pulled on Sherlock from the inside, making him shiver just recalling it. There was a lightness, a floating feeling as he lay there and let John drink from him and hump him until the vampire was done.
The sound of two heart beats and the thumping of the tires on the road were soothing enough for Sherlock to close his eyes. “It’s okay, Sherlock. You’re going to be okay,” John said quietly, running a hand through Sherlock’s hair. His body felt so tired now. Sherlock finally drifted off to sleep, knowing his sire was there to take care of him.
“Good luck,” Mike smiled and then followed Harry off towards the other home, preparing the bombs as they went. Only a moment later, John heard, “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE!” and then he could smell the burning grass.
“Five years?” Sherlock whispered, mulling over his brother’s words, trying desperately to find a loop hole that he could scoot through and be with his John in five hours. Nothing, there was no possible way he could be with him, watch him perhaps, but if the look in Mycroft’s eyes was anything to go off of, Sherlock would have to wait the whole five years.
Once he had his hit, the detective leapt up, pulled on some presentable clothes, and began texting a friend in his homeless network as he walked out of the flat with the note in a bag, John’s shoes, mobile, and longboard.
“You and Sherlock have been through quite an ordeal, and I imagine both of you are still ‘on edge,’ so to speak.”
“That was so messed up, mate. That’s never happened to me before, well, I mean I’ve had erections before in class but I can usually calm myself down enough so I don’t have to shoot off in the toilet,” John was shocked at the confession that slipped from his mouth. He wasn’t sure if he was just getting more comfortable with Sherlock or perhaps this was what happens now that he’s getting older and more confident with himself.
“John, you know I can’t do that. Now, just calm down and tell me what’s going on?” Greg had his gun in his hand, but when he saw the fear in John’s eyes, he slowly put it back in its holster and held up his hands, palms forward.
“The boy, Archie,” Sherlock pointed over to the small form sitting in the back of the ambulance, “do you think he knows anything?”
She brushed the knots out of her hair and washed her hands thoroughly before heading back downstairs. Greg had already set the table and was adding cheese to the instant meal. “Alright, let’s eat,” he said, giving her a hearty helping and a kiss on the top of the head.
“Of course, of course,” the woman said. “A little deterrent for some of that naughty behavior, yes? We get that a lot around here.”
He could tell John was already in distress just from seeing the boy, causing Sherlock to bask in his own brilliance for just a moment.
The boy laughed at the text as he was pulling a green and white striped jumper over his head. He decided it might be best to stop at one of the clothing stores, after all, the money he got for his birthday a month ago was really burning a hole in his pocket.
“Hmm,” the little girl pondered, staring at John just as Sherlock had done, though her gaze was much less scary. “He looks sad,” she finally said, looking back at Sherlock.
“I’m not breaking him, Mycroft. Just give me one more day to reason with him. I know he’ll come around. He threw away his link to the Resistance; that has to mean he’s close.”
“Oh, now you’re scared?” John mocked, his voice an octave lower than normal. He could feel the slight tremors under Sherlock’s skin, taste the hormones his body was creating, hear his heart beating like a wild rabbits caught in a snare. It was all perfect, or at least the predator inside him told him it was. “I could kill you right now. Drink you dry, Sherlock Holmes,” John said, making the ‘s’ sizzle on his tongue.
John looked up at Mycroft who looked both terrified and distraught. The old vampire had seen that look before. His mother had looked at him with such sadness that it almost broke John’s still heart.
Sherlock's POV directly after the events of chapter three. An unexpected visitor shows up at Baker Street.
That is why, again, there was no surprise when Anthea informed him of Sherlock bugging the Watson house, the phone calls the two made, and finally the detective convinced John to come visit him in London.
“John,” he whined again, gripping Mycroft’s sleeve. “I think…I think I’m changing. Please…please, My, I need John.” Sherlock’s voice was pleading, a tone Mycroft had never heard before.
“I’ll say, I look like I decided to get a tattoo of your hands on my chest,” John finally gave a hardy laugh. The feeling of the young body shaking over him because of joy instead of anguish warmed Sherlock’s heart and welded the doors that secured the storms shut again. “Maybe I can get a big ‘SHERLOCK’ tattooed right over one of them,” he giggled again, earning a playful swat to the backside.
John was breathing harder, still coming down as Sherlock placed his hands under the boy’s armpits and hoisted him up to maneuver him into a better position for the second part. Sherlock pulled his kit back onto the bed with one hand and then leaned back to use the headboard as support. John’s fist burn was the main concern, so the older man made sure to position him to where his back was resting comfortably on Sherlock’s chest, his head resting on a pale shoulder, while the bandaged shoulder hung to the side. “There we are,” he said, patting John’s tummy, making sure the boy was still calm. He didn’t want to cause John pain, hell, he would kill anyone who even tried. This though, this was something different, something essential for John to feel owned, feel needed. If a little pain was necessary, then Sherlock would be there to kiss away the ache every time, even if he was the one who caused the hurt in the first place.
John sighed. “As I already explained to Greg, which I’m sure you saw on the surveillance videos,” John accused, angry that he hadn’t spotted them before now. It was the only explanation for why Mycroft showed up after Greg’s attack. “Sherlock is a new vampire. He is strong, he is hungry, and, as you very well know, he is manipulative and brilliant. These traits are like tender just ready to be set ablaze by the presence of blood. This is dangerous, both of you knew that before offering to help.”
“Drink slowly, Sherlock, slowly,” John said sternly, gripping his hair a tad harder. “Savor it, don’t gulp it.”
“Are you sure?” he asked, picturing that small boy pointing a gun at the world’s most dangerous man and pulling the trigger.
”You know he wasn’t happy, hell, did you even look at his mother’s financial state? She can’t provide for him and I can, this is not like Victor who had a good rich life before me.” Sherlock continued to stare at his brother, who never lowered his gaze but twirled his umbrella quickly in his hand.
“What the fuck are you on about, John? This is prime stuff, we can’t survive without it,” Mike challenged, holding some of the food Harry handed him closer to his chest.
“Oi!” John cried, trying to get up, but found that even with one hand, Sherlock was much stronger than him.
Molly nodded and held out the bar for John to take some. “He said it was for being such a brave girl when you hurt your neck. He came over ‘cause Greg was so worried, but it’s okay to be worried. That’s what My said.”
“Oh, uhh, no, I really don’t know where else they’d go. The pipes are the only place I know about,” John lied, proud of himself for keeping cool and not stuttering over his words. The Doms however, didn’t look convinced, which made the teenager start to squirm in his seat.
“She didn’t even try and call, Sherlock,” he whined, trying his best to look up at the man behind him.
“Mmhmm,” was all John could get out, his voice catching when Sherlock started thrusting harder between the two mounds of delicious flesh. It was enough, not always, but most of the time rubbing off on John would sate him for a while.
“Sherlock, I believe we need to set some ground rules first before you start your little experiments; such as what is expected from the boy and what will happen if he tries to stab you in the foot again.” Mycroft was still sitting, sipping his tea slowly and looking at John, studying him.
Hello again everyone, thanks to everyone for your kind comments and kudos. I really appreciate them because this fic is really wearing me out, a lot more than I thought it would.
John just stared at the man. He was still a bit confused, but John just chalked it up to the morphine they were pumping into him.
“Let. Me. Go,” John growled, his eyes staying blue but his teeth descending, adding to the intimidation. The vampire tugged with all his strength on the two chains holding his right appendages. He tightened his hold on Sherlock’s throat and hissed at him, showing all his teeth. “Give me the key or I’ll rip your throat out,” John snapped, looking up at Sherlock, who was starting to turn a tad blue.
“Oh, I fell,” John told the man and put a hand under him to stand. Sometimes he hated his stature. Although it wasn’t horrible being on the shorter side, having Sherlock, Mycroft, and Greg, who were all at least six foot, hanging around made him feel abnormally small. Greg stood before him, John head level with his upper chest, and gave him a disarming smile.
John tried to bring up images of Sherlock domming him, but during a fight it was hard to focus on anything other than being tackled. David grabbed John around the stomach and lifted him high into the air to land on the taller Sub’s shoulder.
“I’m not,” he wasn’t overtly laughing, but on the inside…well, on the inside he was rolling on the floor with a bright red face laughing.
Sherlock ran his hand over the parchment, knowing that this was John’s true life, not the simple existence he lived in Southampton. No, John was just wondering around waiting for his lover to come along and save him. And save him, was what Sherlock was doing while his boy slept peacefully in his new home, his real home.
"Time to go, kiddo. We’ll pick up some food on the way,” Greg promised. “Alright, up you go,” he reached out and plucked the girl from Sherlock’s lap as if she weighed nothing. Instinctually, she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his hips, though his hand on her back and under her bum would have kept her from falling. Her eyes closed again, drifting back into a sleep only children could manage.
“Indeed. There are more pressing matters that need attending to, however I do not wish to burden you with them yet, especially after your confession of producing your own bliss. I foresee many interviews, but I will make sure your first is with Greg.”
“I do know your hideout but I never said you told me,” Sherlock kept his eyes focused on John’s hand.
For what he gathered, Sherlock had captured John Watson and held him captive to preform experiments. Sadly, this did not surprise the League member. He knew knowledge came first with his wayward brother, and it turns out it would come to bite him in the arse. It appeared John had broken loose, or even worse, Sherlock let him lose, and the vampire attacked him.
“No,” John whispered, when the name changed to ‘Sub John Watson, Died at age 16’ written on the white stone. He looked up to see hundreds, if not thousands of tombstones spread across the field.
“See, this is what happens to scared little boys who try to act tough,” Mycroft said with a smile. It tasted horrible, not at first of course because thankfully the man didn’t wet it, but now, as John’s own saliva and warm mouth started to turn the solid form into liquid, the taste was putrid.
It took two more hours of hunger and boredom for Greg to show up. “Stay on the couch,” John told him, as he walked to the door. At the angle Sherlock was sitting, he couldn’t see behind the opened door. Bright light shown through, forcing John to move to the side of the opening to allow the man entrance.
“Mycroft’s men took him back to the hospital. He won’t remember a thing, not even those lovely sounds you made last night, John.” Sherlock’s smirk grew wider as he placed his hands under his head and stretched out completely naked on the floor. It was obvious how unashamed the detective was of his dried-come covered chest or his bit, which not so surprisingly, were half erect.
“Oh, well isn’t that lovely. Have you bedded him yet?” she asked, pulling slightly on her lead to make sure her Sub was still there.
The two Doms walked over from the corner of the room until Mycroft stood on one side of the bed and Sherlock on the other.
“You won’t what, John?” Sherlock smirked, snaking his hand down underneath the elastic waist band of John’s trousers. The boy gasped into Sherlock’s mouth when a warm soft hand took hold of his cock and began squeezing and stroking up and down. Their kissing halted when Sherlock moved his swollen lips down to the bobbing apple of John’s throat. His sucking was obnoxiously loud but John could care less as his hips started bucking of their own accord, seeking out the friction Sherlock was giving him.
“Yes, I’m still here,” Sherlock told him as he grabbed his coat from the hanger. “Let me know if your men find anything, won’t you?”
“Do I look like I’m the leader of anything,” John said of his own volition. He pointed to the collar around his neck and the well-fitting clothes of a pet, not a homeless Sub.
John nodded. He could smell himself and it wasn’t pleasant, so he headed towards the bedroom. “Sherlock, go help him, please.”
John got more confident with kissing the older man so much that the hands that had been lying limp at his side decided to reach up and cradle Sherlock’s ribs. The heat radiating from the core to his palms was incredible, so while keeping one hand still, he moved the other up to the man’s chest to feel how fast his heart was beating. Sherlock broke their kiss with a smile, placing the hand that was by John’s head over to the small panting chest below him. The boy grinned because he knew his heart was beating just as fast Sherlock’s and once again, he was not alone in his excitement.
“You have? Why?” John had the slightest feeling it was because of him, but the logical side of his mind said he was just being a stupid git.
John hesitated, his fingers frozen on the keyboard. This was the first contact he’d had with anybody except for Sherlock and the one visit from Mycroft.
“So I’m a prisoner of war now, is that it?” John asked, getting ready for a fight. He might be small, but damn it, he would never go down without a fight.
“Because you,” his mop of curls disappeared underneath the ruby covers, “have a Sherlock to make you feel all better.” The deep voice was muffled and John only had a second to wonder what the man was doing until he felt something warm and wet engulf his entire cock. His spine arced off the bed, the only thing keeping him from floating were two large hands holding onto his hips. Sherlock kept him safe, Sherlock kept him from floating away and never coming back.
“M-Mycorft…” John stuttered, having second thoughts about calling the brother of the man who was in prison because of him.
Hello everyone! Thank you again for all the comments and kudos. I can't believe I've received over 100 kudos for this little fic.
John growled ferociously and swung Sherlock down onto the bed. In a flash he pulled Sherlock closer to him, bringing the chains over his own back, and straddled the hunter’s hips. John quickly inspected each of Sherlock’s pockets before moving to his socks. “Where is it!?”
and Sherlock made his way to the spare room to grab the extra towel he had prepared for this evening. Once he located the materials they would need, he listened for John to turn on the tap and get in. It was obvious the teen was self-conscious and it wouldn’t do to scare him from taking off his clothes and getting into the shower. Yes, it would be much easier for now to let John undress in private and wait until he is caged in the shower waiting for Sherlock to come and take him. The detective calmed his mind with the promise there would be plenty of time for examining the gorgeous young body later.
John’s sweet induced bliss was interrupted by a door hitting him in the side. “John? Molly? What are you doing on the floor?” Greg asked, poking his head around the edge.
“S-Stop,” John said, keeping his voice stern and hoping Sherlock didn’t hear the slight quiver. “I won’t…don’t make me-“
“I’m sorry, please don’t be mad me. I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he bit his lip, new tears welling up in his eyes.
“See? I know you love it, so why do you always run from me?” Sherlock gave a particularly harsh thrust, hitting John’s prostate head on. The Doctor yelped at the sudden stimulation, his cock fully hard now. “I think you like it when I do this to you. Force you to take it. Hmm, do you like it John?”
Sherlock pulled out his mobile to see where John’s mother was. The little green blip was at the WestQuay Centre, so Sherlock grabbed one last cab and got off a half a mile down the road from John’s old house. As he walked up, the neighborhood was still as empty as it was the last time he broke in, as if they were all helping him get John away because they too knew this wasn’t the place for him. He slipped the note, without touching it, gently into the post box and made his way, one last time, into the Watson home.
“My neck….it’s numb,” the Sub said, closing his eyes until Sherlock shouted for him to keep them open. The commands washed over him, taking away most of the pain, but soon it wasn’t enough and a sharp ache started to build in the base of his skull.
“Don’t tell me how to take care of my Sub, Lestrade,” Sherlock said, but John had stopped paying attention a while ago and was trying to focus on what was happening to his eyes.
“Damn,” Greg sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. A little bit of life was starting to come back to the human’s features. “What do we do now?”
“John, your ice cream is melting!” A high panicked voice said to him. John’s eyes flew open to see Mycroft staring down the bed at him with a soft smile on his face. He tried to pull back quickly, but his limbs refused to hurry from their hypnotic like state.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Just hear him out, John,” Sherlock told him, rubbing the teenager’s back up and down lightly. John nodded a few times for Greg to continue.
He thought to himself as he put on the clothes he came in with and pulled the three pairs of briefs and two shirts into his arms, heading towards the queue.
“Easy, Sherlock. You just lost a lot of blood,” John said, sympathetic to the human. John leaned over the other side of the bed and grabbed the piece of toast Sherlock had brought for him. “Here, eat,” he said, holding the toast to Sherlock’s pale lips. When Sherlock tried to push it away, John sighed and grabbed ahold of him, pulling him up to lay half way on the vampire and half on the bed. “I said, eat,” John said again, grabbing Sherlock’s jaw and opening it easily. He placed a piece of toast into his mouth, sighing with relief as the man started to chew.
“Alright,” John said, walking into the bedroom and closing the door. He put his crutch by the bed stand and just as he was about to sit down he heard a slap from the bathroom, followed by someone cursing.
“I don’t believe that’s what she’s referring to,” a deep voice came from behind him. John froze, panicked in that moment as a thousand thoughts ran through his mind of what he was going to do. When he turned around, the man who helped Molly sow up her bear was looming over him and John came to the conclusion he had made a very bad decision. Through the back window, Jim was looking on, his eyes wide. He blinked once and then ran from view, leaving John and Molly alone with this freakishly tall Dom.
He filled his days with pulling on his restraints, trying to sleep, and waiting for Sherlock to come back and do God knows what to him; and Sherlock gallivanting around, presenting his neck all the time didn’t help either. John wasn’t sure how much longer he would stop himself from grabbing Sherlock and latching on to his neck. Especially when the man came in with some toast and jam and a cup of tea, his veins displayed for John to see every single one of them.
“I’m calling Lestrade,” Mycroft told his brother, who was still looking around the house with a curious expression.
Mycroft set down the tray of food on John’s lap, then grabbed his brother’s good arm, hauling him up. “Come, I’ll take you back,” Mycroft said, holding onto his brother’s arm, as if the younger was about to run away.
“You are gorgeous John, please let me see you,” Sherlock whispered, placing a hand on the shivering boy’s shoulder, applying pressure enough to coax him into turning around. When he did, the small eyes were tightly closed and his shivering turned to violent shaking.
“The shot?” Greg asked, confused for only a moment. “Oh God, John, no, nothing like that is going to happen to you. Sherlock won’t let it, Mycroft won’t let it, and I won’t let it.” He took a step forward, causing John to take a small step back, leaving only a little room between him and the door at his back.
“What’s so funny?!” John shouted at the laughing man. “Even if they did tell me to kill you, which they didn’t, because nobody is talking to me through these contacts, but if they were I could kill you and your stupid brother.”
“Shh, fuck, Jim shut the hell up!” John chastised, removing his hand when the other Sub nodded slightly. “Where did she go? Why didn’t you hang on to her like I told you to?!”
Ummm yeah, so you remember at the very beginning I said this was going to have a dark ending and then I was all like 'no, no, I can't do that to poor John'...hehe...well, I changed my mind. Due to all the comments about adding a third part to the series and the amazing support I've received for this fic, I've come up with a darker ending, which will allow me to continue on with their story. So really, you guys are to blame for snatching away John's happy ending(:
John opened his mouth wide in a silent cry and clinched his eyes shut as his muscles tightened. He jerked himself brutally fast until every last drop ran down the drain. His breathing was labored as he rinsed off his hands and feet.
“It’s true! How do you know? You weren’t there!” John shouted at him, feeling a few more pieces of himself fall off onto the table.
“No, Sherlock, you were supposed to let Gregory handle it. He is trained for such things, after all. But honestly, do you really think John would stab some innocent girl?”
“Cool,” John smiled, trying not to show the concern and confusion on his face. “Where did you get that?” He examined the bar, making sure no one was trying to poison her.
Thinking quickly, and cheating a bit, John looked at Molly’s ice cream and a light bulb went off in his head. “I wanted ice cream and the nurses wouldn’t bring me any.”
As soon as he heard the water turn on and the shower door close, he made his move back to the bathroom. “You okay?”
page to see if I've updated early. So, here it is, folks! Let's get back into the swing of things, shall we?
“I know, John. Everything is forgiven, I promise,” Sherlock rubbed the Sub’s back gently. The little gesture was too reminiscent of his mother taking care of him when he was sick…
“This is for your own good, John,” Sherlock said as he positioned himself behind the Sub. He started with the two wrist restraints, clicking them into place. Then, he used the chain linking the leather together to position the second pair of leather cuffs just above John’s elbows, ensuring the teens arms stayed motionless behind his back. Finally, he snapped the chest harness in place, connecting it to the leather and delicate chains.
“I…I-“ he squeezed his eyes together and tried to roll in on himself at finally hearing somebody else say the words. People had called him the victim, Sherlock’s victim, and all this time John had convinced himself that he was taking advantage of the man so he didn’t have to carry the burdens of his old life.
Thankfully, he saw a patch of red hair breach the surface as well. Shivering, John pulled an unconscious Mycroft on to his own chest as he floated on his back. He didn’t know what to do now. His feet were completely numb and most likely his insides were turning into little pink ice cubes. John almost started crying when he heard the only voice he’d ever obeyed in all of his sixteen years of life.
John felt tears in his eyes as he tried to breathe through the pain. His head started to feel a little light until Irene grabbed a hold of his cheeks, forcing John to look directly at her.
“Don’t brother me, Sherlock. Do you know how much trouble you are causing, both for me, the Watson family, and for the police? What were you thinking? Taking the boy for the weekend is one thing but to keep him?! Did you not learn your lesson last time?” The man was livid, which Sherlock expected but was still mulling over the entire playing board to see where his brother would move next.
and then pulled the duvet all the way up to his neck. “S-Sherlock?” John stuttered, his eyes flicking between the men, looking for reassurance from his keeper.
“No…no, I don’t believe that,” John said, stopping and looking pensively at the medicine in the coat. It was strange, but at the time, he hadn’t realized how everything they needed was sitting right there in the medicine cabinet.
“It was the same with the money! John look,” Jim said, holding up a big wad of notes, “this was just sitting on the coffee table. There has to be at least £4,000 here and it was just sitting there, can you believe that!”
“Greg says John’s just a stubborn little thing, but he’s really worried about him too. I can tell,” she told him, in hopes Mycroft could comfort the man.
“Someday you’ll realize why Mycroft and I do what we do, John. I don’t expect you to understand it now, you’re just a child.”
“Sherlock, please,” was all he could manage because his body felt like it was on fire, scorching every thought or repercussion he had about what was about to happen. His only goal, or so his cock was telling his brain, was to find a way to release the pressure building up in his groin and belly.
“I got my information from a six year old. It turns out there was nothing going on at all. I’m sorry, but you’ll just have to find another way to strike a blow.”
“Easy,” Sherlock said, rubbing John’s chest and belly like he was a scared animal. “Don’t look yet. I don’t want you to see your ankle,” Sherlock said, while Mycroft began unwrapping John’s ankle.
Sherlock leaned up and caressed the ‘SH’ on John’s shoulder, while his other hand ran through the sweaty blond locks matted to the boy’s head. “Mine, he whispered to the only person in the world who mattered.
“Jim!? What about Jim? He’s still alive?” John shot up from his seat, his hands firmly placed on either side of his plate. If Jim was still alive that meant John wasn’t responsible for his death. Giant lead weights seemed to grow wings and lift up from his chest and shoulders, freeing him of the guilt in his heart.
