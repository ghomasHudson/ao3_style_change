It didn't take long for Steve to fall over the edge again, Tony following him a few thrusts later. He collapsed against the bed, gasping in ragged breaths. Tony slid from his body, dropping down beside him and gathering him into his arms. He didn't say anything, letting Steve drift, soothed by the steady rhythm of Tony's heartbeat beneath his ear.
Sorry this one took a little longer. This was somehow a difficult chapter. I think I'm too used to writing mean Tony. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it, let me know what you think in the comments!
“There you go. You took that so well, pet. And it’s all better now, isn’t it? All I have to do is activate it, and then you get your reward.” Steve turned his head to watch Tony, desperate for the other man’s reassurance. His eyes flared the same shade of blue as the arc reactor and Steve felt a brief pulse from deep inside. A soft vibration inside of his prostate. Then Tony’s eyes returned to their normal dark brown. “Ready, baby?”
Steve took a slow breath, almost afraid to read what his Sir had to say to him after that performance.
They stayed that way for a long time, enjoying the closeness, before Tony soaped up a soft rag and began to tenderly clean all of the sweat and come from Steve’s skin. He was practically purring by the time the other man finished, eyes half lidded and heavy with exhaustion.
Sucking on the skin made Steve press back harder against him, soft cries falling from parted lips. So damn beautiful that Tony could barely stand it. Without letting himself think about it, Tony sank his teeth into the side of Steve’s neck, pressing deeper until he tasted blood, and a hint of something sweet. Vanilla and honey. He dug in harder, arms wrapped too tight around Steve to allow escape, heard the cries turn into satisfaction. Tony could feel Steve shuddering against him. This time the soft sobs were of pleasure.
Steve followed him obediently back to the bedroom and then indulged himself by carefully untying Tony's bowtie, slipping the jacket from his shoulders, and kneeling at his feet to remove his shoes and socks. Tony watched him with a soft smile, ran a hand through his hair. "What do you want tonight, sweet boy?"
“Yes. Because instead of coming to me or asking for help, you acted like a brat and tried to take what you wanted. So what you’ve earned, is a punishment. And since this has gone on for days… Well, I wouldn’t want to be you right now.” Tony lifted him easily, rearranging his limbs as well as the restraints until Steve was draped over his lap, exposed and unable to cover himself. “I think the first thing you deserve is a spanking. Maybe a sore ass will remind you to be sweet for me.”
"Yes, please..." Steve tried to arch up, but hard pressure against his hip held him firm against the bed. Tony took his time, opening him up slowly, making him wait for every stroke. By the time his fingers slid away Steve was a needy wreck beneath him wanting nothing more than to be filled, fucked hard and deep. "Tony, please!"
“Override: Avenger’s team captain, Steven G Rogers. Alpha seven sierra eight four echo.” The doors hissed open and Steve pushed through them. He had intended to rage. To yell and demand to know why he had been shut out. And then he saw Tony.
His hand came down hard on his ass, the shock of it jolting through Steve. Tony kept going, pausing occasionally to rub or squeeze the flesh beneath his hand. It wasn't long before Steve was whimpering and rocking his hips up to meet each strike.
"Pet. Loki. He's been very good for me, for the last several months." Bruce's eyes were hard, defensive.
Tony studied him carefully for a moment. Bitten lips, red cheeks, blown pupils. "You like that don't you? You like that a lot."
“Oh sweetheart…” Tony sighed. “Look at me. Please?” He gently guided Steve’s tear streaked face away from his neck, tilting his chin so they could look at each other. “I… I made some mistakes lately. And I’m sorry. You deserve to know what happened. If for no other reason than I treated you so badly.”
"Really?" Tony grinned, wicked enjoyment clearly visible. "Just for that, baby doll, we're gonna keep this up until you're coming dry. Until each time hurts just as much as it feels good. And when you're begging me to stop, because your cock is so raw you can't bear another touch, I'm gonna make you come again."
Steve could feel wetness welling up in his eyes, blinked furiously to try to clear it away. “I’m damaged goods, Tony. I know it, SHEILD knows it, and now you do too.”
Tony had spent the day much the same as he had. Both of them were exhausted leading to a simple dinner followed by going to bed early. Steve had a hard time falling asleep that night, tossing and turning restlessly until finally falling into a light doze. Small sounds startled him awake all night, leaving him feeling sluggish the next morning. His exhaustion was obvious enough that Tony handed him the first cup of coffee.
Steve pulled away, turning his back on Bucky, arms crossed tight over his chest. It wasn’t fair. He had Bucky back, and everything was still wrong. All the things he was saying, it was just too much. “So you just happily let him fuck you like a whore now?”
Tony watched the struggling submissive, waiting to see if he was going to use his safeword. When it wasn’t forthcoming, he nodded at James to continue. The moment James’ fingers pressed against the sensitive omega gland, Steve let out a high pitched squeal, tears continuing to pour down his cheeks. James’ fingers stayed buried inside of him, small movements indicating he was driving Steve to release simply by rubbing on the gland. This time Tony didn’t even have to warn him. The second Steve began to shudder in pleasure, James removed his fingers, watching with aroused interest as Steve fell apart. Struggling in his bonds, trying to get what he needed to gain the pleasure he was being denied, and shuddering miserably when he failed.
He threw his arms around Tony’s neck, clinging as he moved inside of him. Thrusting deep, cock dragging over his glands with each stroke until Steve thought he really would lose his mind from the onslaught of pleasure. His release crept over him slowly, tightening his muscles and stealing his breath. Leaving him shaking in Tony’s arms, desperate for the last little push he needed to fall over. Tony kept him there, hanging on the edge, for what felt like hours. All he could focus on was the desire built to a fevered pitch inside him.
The head of the plug was curved, pressing against the numb spot he’d noticed earlier, more a hint of pressure than actual sensation. Tony pressed a sticky pad against his skin, over the spot he kept rubbing into during sex. Thin cords trailed away from the patch and the plug to a black box on the table beside him. Tony settled in a chair next to it, watching him with concern.
“The hell you did. You wanted you to feel good and me to suffer. That’s not how we work, sweetheart. And did I give you permission to come?”
He smiled. "Good choice. But I do like seeing you on your knees. How about you be sweet to me for a little longer and crawl there. Think you can do that baby?"
“Alright, sweetheart. You know I’ll always give you what you need. But how about we make a game out of it? I have a meeting in about five minutes, and then I’m free for the rest of the day. I want you on your knees, under my desk, warming my cock for that meeting. If you can be a good boy, and not distract me, you’ll get a reward. But if you’re a naughty little vixen who teases me and gets me hard, then you get punished. Understand?”
Hello lovely people! Thank you so much for all of the comments and encouragement on the previous chapters of this story. It is deeply appreciated, and definitely encourages quick turnaround on new chapters.
“No sweetheart, never.” He offered Steve a half smile. “I think you’d be an amazing parent. Probably better than I’ll be.”
Gentle fingers carded through his hair. “Yeah. All over. You were such a good boy for me, Steve. So brave. I’m proud of you, sweetheart.”
The pleasure was so intense Steve was nearly sobbing below him. He could feel his legs shaking uncontrollably as Tony's movements became faster. Too much. Too much. He had to come now. He had to. His cock was throbbing agonizingly in the cage. It felt so much tighter than it had when Tony had put it on him last night, like it had somehow shrunk in the night. He could feel dribbles of precum leaking out of the tip of his cock, running down the outside of the cage. "Tony. Please. I'm so close. Take- take it off. Please."
When they finally parted, Steve brushed a finger over his lower lip. It was swollen and tingling. He glanced up to see Tony watching him, possessiveness in his gaze, and immediately flushed a dark red. “Morning sweetheart. Did you sleep well?”
“Oh Steve. I want you happy. And healthy. I know you don’t understand it now, but one day you will.”
He took a deep breath and tried to snap the chain connecting the cuffs, tried pulling against the bedframe. The restraints held tight. They could contain a super soldier. Which meant... His eyes flew up to meet Tony's.
Steve had thought that being sent back to the Commission was the worst thing that could happen to him. Now he knew better. Spending the rest of his life alone in an empty apartment waiting on a man who no longer cared about him was worse. And there was nothing he could do to fix it. Nothing he could say that Tony wanted to hear. He started to reach for Tony’s pillow, wanting to pull it into his arms, hold it close. Inhale the comforting scent of his mate. Evergreen and motor oil. But he didn’t. Over time the scent would fade, leaving him more alone than he was now. He didn’t want to muddy what little of the alpha he had left with the stench of his own misery.
“About the cage. You seemed pretty livid yesterday. I don’t imagine that’s going to go away overnight.”
“I know, sweetheart. But you don’t know what you need. I do. And I promise that I’ll give it to you. You’ll thank me one day.”
“Yes Tony.” Steve turned his face into the side of Tony’s neck again, feeling impossibly fragile. “And you’ll take care of me?”
Thank you so much to everyone who has taken the time to comment on this story. I really appreciate knowing that I’m not the only one who enjoys the twisted little adventures my brain goes on.
The pattern continued over the course of the afternoon. The plug would turn on at random intervals, the strength and speed varying, tease him to the very edge, and then stop leaving him a wanting mess. Steve lost all track of time and surroundings. His body was on fire. Tony had never teased him this long before, not so directly.
"Okay. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. You get your punishment and then all is forgiven. Alright."
Donning the suit, he flew to Romania to meet up with the rest of his “team” for this mission. Charles owed him a favor and Tony had finally called to collect. He had assured him that only the best would be sent to help him recover the man known as the Winter Soldier. James Buchanan Barnes. The love of Steve Rogers’ life.
He didn't know what to do with his hands. Steve was waiting in the penthouse as requested, no, as ordered by Tony at a few minutes before nine o'clock. He was jittery, filled with nervous energy, pacing back and forth on the plush rug that probably cost more than the entire building he used to live in. Moving helped, but he couldn't seem to figure out what to do with his hands. Clasped behind his back? Too submissive. In his pockets? Too casual.
Steve had barely stirred when Tony slipped out of bed early in the morning for a round of meetings. He’d heard the other man moving around the room, felt a soft kiss pressed to his forehead, and exhaustion had pulled him back down for several more hours. When he did finally get up, he took a quick shower, grabbed a cup of coffee and headed outside for a run.
Steve's hands were shaking as he fumbled for the small device, taking a moment to slow his own breathing. When he pressed the power button, the sudden vibrations against his prostate almost made his knees give out. "Tony..."
Steve moaned, arching off the bed, hips rocking up into the air. Tony had thought about this. Fantasized about it. Built toys with his own hands in the hopes of being able to use them on him. "Tony... God, Tony... You... How long...?"
Tony hid a smile at the banter between the two, not so secretly adoring the way they played off of each other. “What do you think, James? Do you want to give poor Steve a break and please yourself for a little bit? Or tease him a little longer?”
Steve gave himself up to the steady stream of releases, until he was wrung out and spent. Tony gently eased him back to lie on the couch, curled securely in the alpha’s arms, as he struggled to breathe.
He took his time, slowly feeding Steve bites of fruit and pastry with his bare hands. Stroking his fingers across his lips. Steve relaxed into the sensation, let the world become blurry and distant. He brushed kisses over Tony's fingertips and lapped the juices from his skin. Time seemed to slow around them. It felt like he was floating a few inches above the ground.
Bucky curled tighter into himself, drawing away from the lure of Stark’s arms, and the feelings of safety and security they provided. He had murdered this man’s parents. Tried to kill him. He didn’t deserve kindness from anyone, much less Tony Stark. The use of his last name was a reminder. They were not friends. They were not close. He was here because this version of Steve Rogers missed his best friend. Sooner or later he would realize that this Bucky was not the one he remembered. And then he would have to leave. Find somewhere else to go and be until death finally came to claim him. “I didn’t mean to bother you. Interrupt. What… What you were doin’.”
Steve groaned, clutching his stomach as another round of cramps hit him, before curling tightly into the alpha’s chest, whining from the agony. “Something’s wrong…”
As Steve's body arched off the bed a final time, Tony jerked on the chain, pulling the clamps free. Pain seared through his nipples, mixing with the pleasure, making him scream.
As soon as he began to clench around the plug, it stopped, replaced instead with a hard slap on his ass directly over the plug, pressing it deeper inside of him. Steve moaned, head falling back, rocking into the motion. A rain of blows fell over his ass, down the backs of his thighs, coming back up to strike the plug again and again. He tried to hold still, but kept losing his balance, feet slipping on the floor, his body swinging from the restraints, back into the blows.
"I know you do. Which is why we're going to have so much fun tonight. Stand up. Strip for me. Fold your clothes on the chair."
Steve felt fuzzy and confused, too wrung out and overworked to process any hidden meaning behind Tony’s words. He was caught by the idea of proving himself to the other man, deserving the moments of kindness and praise that Tony offered him. Earning his forgiveness and affection. That was what he wanted more than anything. “Yes Tony. Thank you. You’re so good to me.”
Steve smiled at the woman waving a microphone wildly in his direction. "No. I'm here to support my boyfriend and the charity he created in honor of his mother."
“And you did say I could do anything I want. No limits. This is what I want. I promise it’ll only hurt for a minute.” Without any further warning, Steve felt the head of the device press against his newly sensitive prostate. There was a burst of agony as something implanted in the gland, lingering for a moment then slowly fading as his body healed. The metal stretching him wide was collapsed down and removed, Steve’s entrance twitching continuously from the abrupt change.
Added to that, Tony and Bucky were both being mysterious and it was driving him insane. Not that he was a gossip, thank you very much Natasha. He just wanted to know what was going on with the two most important men in his life. Tony had a secret project he was working on in the lab, and refused Steve access while he was doing so. And Bucky still wouldn’t tell him who he kept sneaking out on dates with. Which left Steve with no distractions.
"Yes, that's right. My boy's so sensitive back there, isn't he? So sensitive everywhere. I could play with you for hours, Steve. But right now, I have other plans." The fingers leave and return a moment later slick with lube, start rubbing against him before dipping inside. Tony takes his time, slicking him up and working him open. Steve feels dizzy from the pleasure washing through him mixed with the pain from his clamped nipples.
"Spread your legs for me, sweetheart." Tony's hands stroked over his thighs, soothing him as he spread them further apart. He could only imagine how he looked, spread out on the older man's bed, writhing and clutching at the sheets by his head. "That's a good boy."
"Truly...?" Loki's voice was quiet and small, coming from the shadows surrounding the doorway to the roof. Bruce was a protective presence just behind him.
"Tony..." He buried his face in the bed and sobbed. Let his legs collapse underneath him as he shook. "You can't... Please... You can't do this to me..."
Steve tried to relax, rest for a moment, but the vibrations didn’t stop, instead increasing in intensity. His eyes shot up to find Tony, the older man’s eyes dark and hot as he watched him. “Tony…? Tony, please. I need… I need to stop. I can’t…”
Steve shifted back onto his hands and knees, stretching his arms out in front of him, forehead resting against the soft blankets and ass offered up in the air, thighs spread wide. The soft murmur of appreciation from behind him made him flush with pride.
“Yeah. Yes, I… Understand. Thank you.” Steve rose to his feet, a hollow ringing sound echoing through his head. Tony hated him here too, but it sounded like he deserved it. “I’m sorry… For what he did. I did. I don’t know. I’m just sorry.”
“We need you too. Do you have any idea how many calls we’ve answered while you weren’t here? What happens when one of the Avengers die because Captain America wasn’t there to watch our backs?”
Steve reached under the bed, pulling out a medium sized container, and set it on the blanket before stripping out of his sleep pants. He took his time, crawling onto the bed, making sure to give Tony the view he had requested, finally stretching out on his back so he could see the older man's face. "Yes, Tony?"
Just a warning, there are clinical mentions of medical conditions and disorders in this chapter. I tried to keep them non-descriptive, and it is generic mentions not any of the characters in our story suffering from them. I’ll put a description of the chapter as well as the references in the end notes, so anyone who is unsure can decide from there. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy!
Tony twisted a hand in Steve's hair, taking control of the kiss, devouring his mouth. Steve felt his cock try to stir in the cage, try to harden. And it couldn't. He could no longer even get hard without Tony's permission. He whimpered against his mouth, trying to get closer, suddenly desperate again.
Tony gently stroked his hair, pressing soft kisses to his forehead. “I know. We’re asking so much from you, aren’t we? And it’s not very nice. But you’re being so good for us, sweetheart. And we’re almost done. Only one more for each of you. You can do that, right? Be a good omega for just a little longer? Then you can rest.”
They were nearly done eating when Tony leaned back and studied him carefully, dark eyes so intense it felt like he could see into the furthest corners of Steve’s being. “You know I don’t like this, right?”
After adjusting Steve’s tie so it laid smoothly, Tony threaded their fingers together and led him into the elevator. The frustration from earlier had fallen away, leaving him soft and obedient, exactly how Tony wanted him today. As they reached the garage and slipped into the backseat of a waiting car, a smile curved Steve’s lips. After all, even Tony wouldn’t be cruel enough to deny him on their wedding night.
He took a deep breath, steeling himself, before heading to the elevator. No one else was around to care about his wellbeing, and FRIDAY still didn’t know him as well as JARVIS did. If Tony didn’t take care of himself, no one else would.
“A brief demonstration, so you know what will the consequences will be if you try.” Nothing happened for a moment, then a current of electricity poured through Steve. He screamed as the pain sent him collapsing to the ground, struggling for breath as his body spasmed uncontrollably. It stopped a moment later, and he scrambled back to his knees, muscles twitching with the aftershocks. “Need I say more?”
Tony nudged the other man out of the elevator towards Steve. “Go on Tastee Freeze. He’s waiting for you.” He stayed long enough to watch Steve throw his arms around Barnes, hug him tightly before breaking down to sob on his shoulder. Then he pushed the button to close the elevator doors. To take him away to his penthouse or lab. Anywhere but standing alone, watching what he wanted most in the world and would never have again.
“Then yesterday will look like a walk in the park in comparison. I want to be sweet to you, Steve. But the choice is yours.”
Steve ended up spending several hours talking to Loki, before returning to the penthouse to wait for Tony. He must have fallen asleep at some point, because he woke up to the soft brush of lips across his forehead. "Tony?"
“Yes alpha…” Tony felt dampness against his skin. Steve’s tears. “I’ll be good. I promise. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. Anything you want.”
Steve sighed. “Tony left me alone in the penthouse today…” Bucky stayed quiet, waiting him out until he continued. “He… Left me a tablet to use. So I… Looked him up. There were these people talking about him... About how he didn’t know how to commit. And him taking an omega was just a phase. How he was gonna get sick of me. Or bored. And…” He took a shaky breath, realizing there were tears on his cheeks.
There was no response as the first trickles of cool liquid began to fill him. But as the amount increased, it began to make it’s presence know. Steve let out a soft gasp, began shifting slightly on his knees, shuddering as he became aware of the chill saline flooding his intestines. He shivered, whining softly, and Tony shushed him. Offering affection in exchange for the discomfort he was causing him. As the amount inside of him grew, the first hint of a bulge stretching Steve’s flat stomach, Tony brought his cock to full hardness.
Steve gasped, trying to grind his ass down against the sheets hoping for some friction against his rim. “What did you do to me?”
His cheeks burned as he obediently grabbed the small bottle and passed it to Tony. He loved it when the older man was firm and demanding like this. "Yes, Tony."
"Yes Tony." Steve could feel his body tremble. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so helpless, so out of control.
Looking at Steve was a mistake. He knew it when he did it. Bucky wasn’t able to resist the pleading look Steve was giving him. Never had. “Alright, punk. I’ll have breakfast.” He pulled on a pair of thick sweatpants and a long sleeved shirt, suddenly feeling cold, before following Steve out into the living room. Stark was waiting for them next to the table, piled high with different foods. They seated themselves in silence, each man focusing on filling his plate and fixing his coffee. The distraction helped. Tony let them have a few minutes to eat, before turning to face Bucky.
And finally we get some of that sexy sexy smut that everybody’s been waiting for. (Me included.) And what could possibly happen in the next chapter? Q&A about omega biology anyone?
As soon as he’d finished his last bite, the door behind Steve’s back seemed to disappear. Instead of hitting the ground, it felt as though he continued falling. When he threw his hands out in panic, they encountered soft upholstery. Looking around was even more disorienting, as he was somehow in a comfortable sitting room, with an unfamiliar man staring at him.
Tony started massaging his chest, teasing and playing with his neglected nipples not wanting to completely overwhelm him until the end. He worked him up to an easy release using both fingers and mouth, pulling back to watch Steve shudder through the aftermath of his eighth ruined orgasm. Once he was hanging limp and spent in his bonds, Tony pulled a set of nipple clamps from his pocket, carefully placing one and allowing it to snap closed, cruelly pinching the flesh, before moving to the other side. As he finished, James began whimpering behind him.
“So fucking gorgeous.” Tony’s voice came as though from far away. “Tell me sweetheart, did you touch yourself when I was gone? When you were free?”
Steve jerked so hard he slid free of Bucky’s mouth. He let out a soft growl, gripping Steve’s hips hard, pinning them to the mattress. He sucked the little cock again, tongue circling the slick head. Steve struggled beneath him, but Bucky was stronger. Tony was right, he did taste sweet. Bucky chased the addictive taste, moaning around him when Tony breeched him with a slick finger, carefully flexing within him, stretching the tight rim. Without anywhere else to focus the intensity, Bucky turned it on Steve. He sucked and licked at him as though he’d never stop, delighting when Steve would shake and cry, spilling into his waiting mouth over and over again.
“It’s fine.” Bucky can feel himself hunching in, curling up tighter, trying to protect himself. What from he wasn’t sure.
When he drew back, Steve felt a bit light and floaty, curling into Tony's warmth. Strong hands stroked over his sides, bringing him back to the present. "Such a good boy for me. So generous. Would you like to come, baby?"
"Yes, Tony." Steve walked into the bedroom and took off his clothes, folding them on the chair in the corner, before opening the dresser. The drawer was filled with pairs of silk panties in his size. Cheeks burning, he picked out a pair of light blue ones, slipped them on and returned to the living room.
Steve relaxed slightly. "Thanks Nat. I don't know. I guess I'm still used to people being arrested for being deviant. But I like Tony. He makes me feel... Special."
The tears are back, barely clinging to his lashes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. “Because I don’t deserve it. I deserve this. I deserve to be punished. For everything I’ve done. Everyone I’ve hurt or killed. I deserve to hurt. To suffer. To suffer and to die alone…”
He'd made sure Steve was alright, that he wasn't upset. Everything had stopped when he'd used his word, just as promised. Temperature play, at least the kind involving cold, was permanently off the table. He'd been praised for doing what he was supposed to and using his safe word, told over and over again how good he was, leaving him feeling pleased and content.
"I know you have baby. Which is why tonight, you get a reward. Do you want it here, or in the bedroom?"
The afternoon passed in a similar fashion, Steve lost to a haze of desire and agony. Before the end of the movie, Tony bent him over the arm of the couch and took his pleasure, leaving Steve bereft. After lunch, it was a knotting over the table. A few hours after that found them back in the bedroom. This time after Tony came, Steve broke down completely, sobbing like his heart was breaking.
Steve melted beautifully into the embrace, a soft sound trapped in his throat when they parted. “Thank you, alpha…”
Tony spent most of the next week trying to reassure Steve, and help him navigate falling into omega-space. For the first few days, Steve felt awkward and ungainly, but by the end of the week he was starting to learn how to lean into the sensation. Let it carry him away without struggling to control it.
He gasped in breaths, tried to rock his hips back against the plug, hoping for just enough to push him over the edge. So close.
He lowered his head, eyes trained on the floor in front of him, unable to get the words out while meeting Tony’s eyes. “I want you to hurt me. Do anything you want with me. I want to pay. For all of the harm I’ve caused, and all of the lives that were lost along the way.”
By the time Tony returned, Steve was lost to a haze of unrelenting desire. Even the gentle touch of skin against his as Tony released the restraints had Steve moaning and arching. He could hear the other man speaking, but it took effort to focus on the meaning of the words. He tried to listen, but lost most of what was said.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve taken a sub. And never one as pretty as you. I want to play with you, baby. See how far I can push you. Will you let me?”
“H-handler…?” He tried, the answer denied with a sharp shake of Tony’s head. His eyes were dark and blazing as they bored into Bucky. He didn’t have the answer, didn’t know what Tony wanted to hear. He sobbed softly, suspended on the edge of release, unable to tip over. Held there by Tony’s will. Bucky wanted to surrender to this man, give him everything. The way Steve had. Realization dawned. He could see the satisfaction in Tony’s eyes as he finally saw what he wanted in Bucky’s face.
Steve shuddered, grinding down against the hard pressure of Tony's thigh, working himself closer with each strike, until he was there. With a shout he came, spilling across Tony's skin, firm slaps drawing out every last shiver of pleasure. Then a hard grip on his hips was pulling him back onto his knees. He could feel the other man move around behind him, hear the wet sound of lube sliding over his cock. Head spinning, he arched his back, offering himself up as much as possible.
The other man strode over to where he was standing and drew him into a kiss, hand gripping the back of his neck softly. Steve could feel his worries recede and he allowed himself to melt into the feeling of Tony's mouth moving over his. Tony drew back relatively quickly and chuckled as Steve leaned forward to try to chase after him.
He turned, walking back to the dining table, taking a chair beside the wall. The board lifted a few feet off the ground, following beside him. It tilted, leaning back against the wall next to him, leaving Steve easily in reach. Tony poured two cups of coffee, turning to look at the restrained omega. “Do you like coffee?”
James dragged his eyes open, fighting down the arousal to allow himself to think more clearly, gaze running over Steve’s body. Checking for signs that it was too much. That he really couldn’t handle it. Finally he shook his head. “He’s fine. He can take it. Just doesn’t wanna. Probably hopin’ we’ll take pity on him an’ let him come.”
As soon as he was close to falling apart, the motion stilled. He whined, attempting to rock his hips to no avail. There was a tingling inside of him, the toy growing cold, pulling him away from the impending release. When he was desperately gasping but no longer in danger of coming, that too ceased. “Tony…” He groaned, squeezing his eyes shut. It was torture of the best kind.
"This one's a little different." He lifted a small box, held it out to Steve, who took it carefully. "I love you, Steven Grant Rogers, more than I thought I could ever love anyone or anything."
There was the sound of a door opening, voices raised in greeting. Steve let everything fall away, focused completely on the task at hand. He wasn’t certain how long he knelt there, floating along, letting the world pass by unnoticed around him. There was an occasional pulse or twitch of Tony’s cock in his mouth, but he was being so good, holding still and doing nothing to tease or arouse. But even as the thought passed, he wondered if that was what he wanted to do. Tony had given him options, after all. Did he want to be a good boy and get rewarded? Or did he want to be a bad boy and get punished?
Finally, he spoke. “I have some work that needs to be done downstairs. Your tablet has been locked up for the time being and your telephone and television privileges revoked. There are some books on the shelf in the guest bedroom if you get bored. The gag will release for you to have something to drink and eat lunch at intervals. You are to put it back in when you’re done or there will be consequences. JARVIS will alert me of anything else that needs my attention.” Without another word he swept out of the penthouse leaving Steve miserable and confused in his wake.
Before Steve had time to recover, Tony was on his knees sucking his overly sensitive cock into his mouth. That was when Steve broke, realizing that he wouldn’t be able to escape his bonds, that all of his sensitive places were exposed. He cried as the orgasm built within him, sobbing frantically when Tony pulled back, ruining his release again.
The restraints were released, the clamps removed from his nipples, and he was drawn down into Tony's arms, curled up in his lap, surrounded once again with his presence. "Tony..."
“Isn’t that a pretty sight, Steve.” Tony slicked his hand and began long soft strokes over him, the other hand pinning his hip to the bed. “You’ll take what I give you. And be grateful.”
Slick was pouring out of him, sliding down his thighs to drip onto the ground beneath him as he moved. He couldn’t even pretend to be running anymore. Another release pounded through him, trapping a sob in his throat as he collapsed to his hands and knees. Tony gave him a chance to rise, but his legs were shaking too hard to move.
Tony reached down, gripping the base of his cock tightly, soft whimpers and cries spilling from Steve's lips as his cock slowly softened under the painful pressure. He shuddered against the older man's body, pushing weakly against his chest. A firm grip on his shoulder kept him pinned against the bed. "That's it. Just let it happen. Good boy."
“We don’t want you to leave. I want you to know that. That being said, I also won’t force you to stay. But if you’re trying to get away from Rogers, this is the only place you’ll be able to do that.”
Sorry about the short chapter last time, but hopefully this makes up for it. How am I two chapters in and still have plot rather than porn? Is this a new record for me? Anyway, enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!
It was quiet for the first time in his experience. No bright lights. No blaring music. No manic Tony in ripped up jeans and an oil-stained band shirt bouncing around the room. It felt almost unnatural.
"Dinner. Tonight. Seven o'clock. Wear something nice. Maybe that tailored suit, the dark blue one. It should bring out your eyes."
Tony led Steve back into the elevator, thoughts racing a mile a minute. It was shocking to have the other man obediently follow him without making any snide comments. Even more so that having him at Tony’s back didn’t make his skin crawl. This Steve was just too different from the one he knew to trigger the same responses once he realized what he was seeing.
“It’s better for you, sweetheart. You know that. It puts too much pressure on your glands, and if I don’t they’re going to end up impacted again. And we don’t want that. You’ll get used to it. Eventually won’t even notice it anymore. We’ll get you trained up proper, and then maybe I can put you in one of the pretty ones that other omegas wear.”
He could feel his cock getting hard again, the machine's pace speeding up, driving him closer to another orgasm. Pinpricks of pain blended with the pleasure. He squeezed his eyes closed, trying to hold back and failing, coming over Tony's hand a second time. A wail tore from his throat as neither of them stopped torturing his sensitive body.
“Well, you know. Genius.” Tony moved around his body until he was kneeling in front of him, tipping his face up to the light, studying it. “Beautiful. How did I get so lucky?”
A look of immense pleasure bloomed across Tony’s face. “Oh yes, sweetheart. You were perfect. Did you think you did something wrong?” Steve nodded. “Not at all. I have exactly what I want. You don’t need to worry about things like this, Steve. All you have to do is what I tell you to. Alright?”
The next time he was denied, a wail tore from his throat, followed by hysterical sobs. Steve felt like he was burning alive. In that moment he would do or agree to anything to gain the satisfaction he needed. The pause between rounds was getting shorter, building him up higher and leaving him clinging to the edge for longer. Every inch of him was sensitive and aching.
He had started with a generalized satellite DNA scan. For once Howard’s obsession with the Howling Commandos had come in handy. A few strands of hair from an ancient brush in his collection provided the sample. Tony had expected to find weather beaten remains in an icy canyon beneath old train tracks. Instead, he got a moving signal. Hits from a living breathing individual. And down the rabbit hole he went. Facial recognition scans in shady government databases provided him with a horrifying reality.
Before the serum, Steve hadn’t presented a secondary gender. Just another way that he was kept separate from the world around him. But at least he’d been able to come. The SSR scientists had been hopeful that after the serum he would be transformed into a perfect specimen of alpha masculinity. They had been beyond disappointed that their only super soldier had been an omega, immediately putting him on high doses of suppressants throughout the war.
"Still no answer. Anybody know another magic user who'll get their head out of their ass, and fucking help?"
Tony buried himself deep, knot stretching Steve wide, locking them together. He spilled over the alpha’s fingers with a cry, clenching around the cock inside of him. He felt the tingling burn as the alpha’s come flooded into him, absorbing into the delicate tissues of his passage, hormones filling him and bonding them even more closely together. Over time Steve would become dependent on his alpha for the chemicals his body produced. Most likely had already begun to, due to the years of deficiency and his reliance on suppressants to carry him through.
Tony rubbed firmly against the first gland, trying to break up the accumulated toxins. Steve howled, jerking against the restraints, tears quickly spilling down his face. Tony felt bad for him, but knew that it needed to be done. He tried to work quickly, forcing the gland to release. It took nearly half an hour before it spasmed beneath his fingertips and softened. A flood of slick dripped down his hand as he removed his fingers. “See honey, one done. We’ll take a little break now, okay?”
"I'm always glad to see you. And yeah, Bruce cooked earlier. I think he was going to put something in the fridge for you. Have you eaten?"
Steve sobbed, clinging to his thighs, hips still churning helplessly from the plug pulsing in his ass. His skin felt hot and tender, swollen. A glint of silver drew his gaze up to the remote in Tony's hand, watched helplessly as he turned off the vibrations.
“Yes alpha.” Steve trembled as Tony pulled him closer, hard cock grinding against Steve’s soft cocklet.
Tony gripped his neck, letting the pressure calm him. “Such a good boy. Now, are you going to trust your alpha to know what you need from now on?”
“You are so fucking sweet, babydoll. You know that?” Tony scraped his teeth over the bond mark, smiling wickedly as Steve shuddered. “So pretty and helpless for me. You’d do just about anything I asked if I’d give you my cock. Wouldn’t you sweetheart?”
With a loud groan against his ear, Tony thrust deep, knot swelling to lock them together. Steve could feel the heavy pulses of come filling him, the tight stretch as he struggled to accommodate a knot for the first time. His cock ached, and he struggled to free himself from Tony’s grip. “Alpha, please!”
When the doors finally opened, Tony dragged him through the penthouse, straight to the bedroom. He shoved Steve back onto the bed, watching him sprawl helplessly across it. That strange sense of weakness was back, leaving Steve passive and unable to resist as Tony efficiently stripped him before rolling him over, urging him onto his stomach. “Present for me, my sweet omega. I know you want to.”
"This was painted by one of your contemporaries. This is The Wounded Table by Frida Kahlo. It went missing in the former Soviet Union in 1955. Pepper and I played hell to track it down."
"You gonna ask me to lock you up like a good little boy? Come on, baby. Let me hear you ask for it."
“Thank you. Why don’t you go to the bathroom, take care of anything you need to do, then meet me back out here.”
With a shudder, he decided to move on. Wrapped a hand around himself and started to stroke his cock from root to tip, rubbing over the head before moving back down. It felt... good.
“I was happy before! I had family! And friends! I wasn’t some rich asshole’s fucktoy!”He kept his face turned away, even as he heard Tony moving into his space again. Much to his dismay, he could feel tears streaking down his cheeks and dripping off his chin. The entire situation was overwhelming. He didn’t know what to do anymore.
Tony’s thrusts became harder, brutal. Steve could feel the beginnings of his knot rubbing against his rim. It made his skin burn, his body throb with need. He didn’t understand why his alpha wasn’t letting him have this, was telling him no.
"Okay. You just lay there looking gorgeous and keep your eyes closed, alright?" Without waiting for a response, Tony began touching him. Teasing brushes over his nipples, firm strokes across his stomach, a squeeze on his hip. Never lingering long in any one spot, causing his skin to tingle in anticipation.
Tony slid into the bed behind him, curling against his back, his cock rubbing against Steve’s ass in slow movements. Steve arched his back, offering himself to the other man, wanting to feel him warm and alive inside of him. The head of Tony’s cock pressed against his hole, pausing for a moment. Steve held his breath, silently praying for what he needed most. As though he knew what Steve was thinking and had decided to grant his request, Tony slowly slid into Steve’s still open passage, drawing a soft gasp. It felt unbelievably good, better than the day before.
He offered Steve a soft smile. “I asked if dinner was alright. If you liked it. If not, I can always get you something else.”
When he came back to the penthouse each night, the first thing Tony did was pull Steve into his arms and kiss him senseless. He began to look forward to the intimacy of being so close to another person. Sharing their space and breath.
"Captain, per Dr. Banner's instruction, I am to ascertain the intentions of anyone trying to enter his floor."
Tony's fingers trailed over his chest, pausing briefly to flick over a nipple and smiling when Steve gasped softly. "Sensitive little thing, aren't you?"
"Good boy." He let the chain fall from his fingers carelessly, and slid away from Steve's body again, leaving him lying on the bed desperately trying to catch his breath. He could hear several things being moved on the nightstand but couldn't tell what any of them could be. The anticipation only made it more intense.
“You’re welcome, pet. This has all been so overwhelming for you, hasn’t it?” Steve nodded. “And I know I’m not making it any easier on you. But I want to give you a chance to prove yourself to me. You want that, don’t you?
A groan rips from Steve’s throat and again any control he had gained is gone. He braces against the bed with his elbows and slams down against the mattress, grinding the cage into the soft bedding over and over again, desperate for even the slightest hint of touch against his aching cock.
Tony was led down a corridor, glass windows on either side showing various rooms as they walked past. Phil explained the unique qualities of the different specimens they passed, the omegas becoming less docile the deeper into the facility they went. When they reached the end of the hallway, Tony froze in his tracks.
Tony chuckled, pulling him closer. “Alright. Alright. Apparently you’ll take cuddles by force, won’t you, you greedy little thing?”
Steve screamed when Tony seated himself in a single thrust, fingers digging into the bedding from the need to hold onto something. There was no time to recover as his alpha began to pound him with all the pent up lust from watching him suffer through their time in the gym. Steve’s passage spasmed, releasing around Tony’s cock, the other man not slowing or stopping, instead chasing his own pleasure.
Tony woke to soft whimpers and gasps from the sleeping omega beside him, surrounded by the scent of need. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, enjoying the way Steve pressed back against him in small movements. Bruce had been right. The combination of alpha come and having Steve fixed had already done wonders for the omega’s libido. He idly wondered which version of Steve he’d be greeted with when the man finally woke. When they had gone to bed the night before, he’d obviously been too worn out to continue fighting. Tony had no illusions that it would continue. His omega was full of fire and spirit.
As soon as he was within reach, Tony buried his fingers in Steve’s hair, gripping it tight. “I told you to come to me if you needed something and you listened to me. You’re such a good boy. Such a good omega.”
He didn’t notice the car stopping until Tony’s hand was on his arm, leading him into the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, Steve was pinned back against the wall, arms tight around him. He hid his face in the genius’ neck, allowing himself the moment of weakness. To accept some of the comfort he had been aching for.
"Good. I'm gonna assume that he took you. Do you like having something inside you, baby? Do you ever touch your sweet little hole when you're alone?"
Steve slid from his lap down to the ground, watching as Tony casually opened his slacks and pulled out his hard cock. He slid a hand through his hair and guided his mouth onto him. He moaned at the taste of him, and felt the grip on his hair tighten. "Nope. No sucking, no moving. Just... Hold. Keep me warm while I work."
“Not tonight, sweetheart.” He pulled away from Steve’s gland, went back to holding him securely in his arms. “I don’t want to hurt you, and it’s been a long day. We’ve been here for hours. You need a drink and something to eat. I’ll take you upstairs.”
"Yes, Tony." Steve was out of the room in record time, determined not to give Tony extra excuses to punish him. He was waiting on the bed, as ordered, when he heard the other man enter the room. A soft clink was heard as something was placed on the nightstand.
Without thinking, Steve rose and moved around to the other side of the desk. On the ground beside Tony's chair was a thick red cushion. He didn't have to ask, just slowly dropped to his knees on the plush fabric. Tony smiled and stroked his cheek. "Such a good boy."
Tony stood at the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city, scotch long forgotten in his hand. He let his eyes follow the movements of lights and people, so far below that they didn’t seem real. All around him was the perfect silence of his empty apartment atop the empty tower that he called home. For years Tony had been content, but recently something had changed. The instincts that he had suppressed for so long had come roaring to the surface. It was time for him to find a mate.
"Let’s get you cleaned up and then into the kitchen. Get you something to eat." Tony's lips quirked up into a wicked smile. "Wait until you try walking with the plug."
Steve let his fingers brush over the bracelet on his wrist. "Of course, Tony. What would you like me to do?"
"Good boy. Are you ready for your punishment?" Tony laughed at the rapid shake of Steve's head. "At least you're honest. But we're going to start anyway."
When Steve woke, Tony pulled him closer, letting him curl up against Tony’s chest. He enjoyed the soft purring sound that rumbling in Steve’s chest. He seemed to be make it without realizing it, anytime he was happy and content. Tony tilted Steve’s chin up, placed a soft kiss on the tempting lips before drawing back with a smile. Tony had already learned that he needed to be so careful with him. The slightest hint of rejection and Steve would fall apart. He had to be gentle and reassuring. Steve offered him a shy smile in return, peering up through his lashes. Something he did frequently, but never seemed to lose it’s effect on Tony. Or his libido.
“Absolutely.” He accepted the mug and took a sip. Tony knew the way each Avenger preferred their coffee. He always fixed Steve’s a little sweet with plenty of cream and a hint of vanilla. “Thanks Tony.”
With a gasp, he writhed in his restraints, pulling at his wrists and ankles, trying to close his legs, shake off the clamps, anything to lessen the sense of pressure. As usual, he remained exactly where Tony had put him. “Alpha…”
He finally became aware of gentle fingers stroking through his hair, smoothing it back from his forehead, and let out a content sigh.
“Please, Tony? I can help! Just like I did during the invasion. You just have to give me a chance…” Steve could feel tears trailing down his cheeks as the Avengers presented a united front against him. It wasn’t fair. Never would be. The alpha’s arms were crossed over his chest, face hard as he stared down at Steve. As though he were worthless. As though he wasn’t worth their time.
"Shh... Almost there." There was none of the thrusting or stroking Steve had come to expect, just firm pressure inside of him, feeling almost like the build to orgasm, drawing whimpers and moans from him. The tension increased, shivering down his spine, tensing his muscles, but not quite right. And then he felt it. Come dribbled from his cock, with no accompanying pleasure, leaving him feeling twisted and jangled inside like the ruined orgasm Tony had punished him with had done before. The difference was in the duration. This didn't stop. Tony kept pressing against the swollen gland until his balls were empty and aching, until there was nothing left to drip out.
Steve nodded against his skin, still struggling with the fear that Tony would decide he had made a mistake, that he wasn’t good enough. That he wanted someone else.
He had enough time to nod before Tony's hand tightened into a fist, dragging him forward and thrusting into his mouth and down his throat. He began moving his hips, hitting the back of his throat each time, causing Steve to cough and gag around his length, keeping up an unrelenting pace. He allowed him to gasp in a breath between each thrust, pausing buried deep, the wet heat of Steve's throat clutching around him. The world narrowed to the feel of Tony's cock in his mouth, the sounds above him, until with a loud cry he felt his cock throb and pulse, spilling down his throat. He swallowed around him frantically until he was finally pulled away. Tony's hands on him were gentle again, fingertips brushing over his swollen lips.
The corner of his lips turned up in a smirk. “Then I guess you better go tell him that, right punk?”
“Alpha, I…” He couldn’t finish the sentence, dropped to his knees instead, crawling to the side of the bed closest to Tony.
Tony pressed him onto his back, fastening his wrists securely to the headboard. Steve writhed, hips rolling up into the air uncontrollably. The need to come was unbearable. He could feel it building, increasing, with every moment that passed. He tried to grind back against the bed and was rewarded with a flare of pain from his recently abused hole. Steve squeezed his thighs together, willing to try anything for pressure or sensation on his throbbing cock, but no matter what he tried there was nothing. Only smooth metal. No pressure or friction. Nothing to ease his torment. He couldn’t still his frantic movements, rocking back and forth on the bed.
Steve jerked up into Tony's body, all semblance of a rhythm lost, desperately chasing the overwhelming pleasure. His body was burning with oversensitivity, pain twining with the pleasure as Tony forced him over the edge again, screaming the other man's name.
Tony felt his entire body tense and still. Blindsided. He hadn’t expected an attack to come from that direction. “Steve…”
Another strike landed on his clenching hole, making him howl. Tony continued to lay steady blows against the defenseless area, voice conversational, not showing a hint of strain. “That’s right. It’s whatever I want, whenever I want it. But since you’re special, I won’t demand that you call me Master. I want you to do it of your own free will. And when you finally do? I’ll know you’re mine completely.”
When he talked to Natasha, she advised him to let it go. Stark was rich, had no idea what to do with as much as he had, so he enjoyed lavishing attention on the people he cared about. And somehow, they had ended up on that list. Which was fine. Steve could accept gracefully. He could pretend it didn't feel like he somehow owed the man for all of the things he was providing everyone, both individually and as a team. But that was as far as it went. For everybody else. An army of robots skittered through his rooms ensuring they were immaculate, day and night. Alright, Stark loved his tech. It was probably only the work of an hour or two to create a better, more intelligent Roomba. This was still fine.
Tony pulls him closer, resting his cheek against Steve’s hair. “And was there anyone who helped you through that heat?”
Tony was walking down the hall from his bedroom when Steve stepped onto the floor. The time he had invested in getting ready was more than worth it when Tony's eyes lit up in pleasure at the sight of him. "Oh, Steve... You look... Oh honey, you take my breath away."
The vibrator surged up several settings, causing him to drop his face down to his arms and thrust back against it, trying to get it deeper. His hips rolled back, pace shifting with the constantly changing setting, eyes squeezed tightly closed as he imagined it wasn’t him controlling this scene, but someone else. Someone with dark, heated eyes and a wicked grin. He could almost feel those rough hands on his skin, teasing him and drawing out the pleasure. He could even imagine the filthy words that would fall from Tony’s lips as he drove him towards his peak then prevented him from reaching it.
A strong hand fisted in Steve’s hair, jerking his head back. “First of all, my name is Tony. You will address me as either that or alpha. Name calling will not be tolerated. Second, I am responsible for your well being. Which means I will do whatever is necessary for your care. And lastly, if you misbehave I can and will discipline you until you learn better. Do you understand?”
Steve choked on a scream as the vibrator ticked higher, heard Tony chuckle. "Please, please Tony, it- it hurts..." He trailed off on a whine.
Steve’s heat lasted for five days. Tony assured him that normally it would be closer to three, but since it was his first real heat, and medically induced, that it would last longer. Steve was obviously overwhelmed and exhausted. In between waves of heat when he tried to rest, Tony did his best to keep him clean, hydrated, and encourage him to either eat or drink meal replacement shakes. Usually the latter, because he soon learned getting the omega to eat during his heat was nearly impossible.
“No! It’s true, isn’t it?” The tears fell, sliding down Steve’s cheeks, leaving silvery trails on his skin.
Tony walked behind him again, Steve could feel the heat of his eyes on his body. Every thrust of his hips made the weights swing, pulling on his sensitive nipples, sharp pain radiating from the tight clamps. The vibrations from the plug kept increasing, working him up higher. His wrists tried to twist in the restraints, he could barely stay on his feet, but the cuffs held him immobile.
"You look so fucking good in those. Leave 'em on. Come here." Steve slid to his knees, crawled to Tony's feet, drawing another groan from his mouth. "You're so pretty on your knees. Tell me what you want, Steve. How do you want to take care of me?"
He spent some time thinking after the call ended. Kept coming back to the same thing. Bucky had never lied to him. He slid the tablet over, began searching. The first thing he learned was that the world wide omega rebellion their parents had always talked about had never existed. It wasn’t covered up, otherwise there wouldn’t be anything there. Steve found mentions of the protest that had resulted in Bucky’s capture, as well as several others from the past. Easy to find, because in society it just… Wasn’t important. Omegas in general were happy with their lives.
"Well my sadist of a boyfriend had spent the entire day teasing me! Tell me the truth, Tony. If I hadn't done that, would you have really unlocked me and let me come tonight?"
Steve shivered against him. "Oh God, that was terrible. I can't believe you came up with that." He turned, burying his face in Tony's neck.
“Damn do I love hearing that. Okay, up you go. We’re going upstairs.” Tony helped him stand, supporting him to the elevator, as his legs were still weak and trembling. When they reached the penthouse, Tony settled him in the closest chair and disappeared into the bedroom. Steve ran an idle fingertip across the front of his collar, rubbing back and forth in a soothing gesture as he waited for what would happen next.
"Very well." Loki fixed himself a cup of tea and brought a bottle of water for Steve. He sat down across from him, accepting the meal set in front of him. "Thank you."
Tony snagged his cup, fixing it the way Steve liked it again, before carrying both mugs into the living room. “I want to watch a movie. Come watch a movie with me, Steve!”
Having decided what he would be putting his pet through next, he ordered Steve to wait for him in the bedroom before returning to the lab to assemble the supplies he would need. When he returned to the bedroom, a pretty sight was waiting for him. Steve was on his knees in the center of the carpet, head bowed and arms folded behind his back. Tony took a moment to enjoy the sight before alerting him to his presence. “Such a pretty boy I have. Up on the bed now. On your hands and knees, facing the headboard. And I want those thighs wide. I won’t ask you again.”
“I believe you.” Tony’s thumb brushed over the tear tracks on his cheek. “I’m pretty sure that you’d willingly jump off a cliff to prove yourself to me right now. And that isn’t right either. Okay. New plan: I’m going to show you to your room, and make sure you’re all settled in. You’re going to get a good night’s sleep, because you look like you need it. Then we’re going to talk in the morning. You’re here for the foreseeable future. We need to figure out if we can work together without you seeing the version of me you know, and me seeing the version of you that I know. Okay?”
“O-okay…” The word caught on a soft hitching sob, and Tony quickly moved around the frame to soothe him. Steve’s face was red and covered in tears. He stroked the hair back from his face, placing soft kisses on his brow.
As carefully as possible, he slid up towards the head of the bed, extracting himself from the two super soldiers. James stirred, eyes blinking open sleepily. Tony stroked his hair, whispering for him to go back to sleep. He curled closer to Steve, allowing the omega to settle firmly against his side, before closing his eyes and drifting off again.
A low keening noise tore from Steve's throat. He would. He would do almost anything if it meant Tony kept looking at him like that, touching him and teasing him like he had been for the last few days. "Yes Tony..."
As soon as his legs stopped shaking he went to the kitchen, heated up some leftovers for lunch, and settled back on the couch. He had gotten to the second season of Sense8, a show recommended to him by Bruce of all people, and if he wasn't going to get anything practical done today, he might as well watch.
His breath caught, back arching instinctively, as the cool metal settled inside of him. The plug Tony had chosen was a large one, stretching Steve’s rim and pressing against his glands with every movement, reducing him to a shivering wreck once more. “Alpha…”
