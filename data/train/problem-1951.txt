“I had no idea. Mycroft must have put his unlisted income to use. The furnishings are relatively new. Considering his ever-growing appetites, having orgies in his Pall Mall lodgings would be quite awkward.”
Apprehension clawed at his insides, and he shoved the mobile back in his pocket before jumping into his car, practically feeling the blood draining from his face.
Five months later, thousands of miles away, Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, found himself uncharacteristically entertained.
The detective plunged forward in a heartbeat, flat on his stomach as a crashing sound resonated in the building. Whipping his head around, he came face to face with a man armed with a baton and a gun at his belt. His assailant raised his weapon once more, but John was faster and tackled him to the ground. However, the soldier was not quick enough to avoid the next blow that landed across his jaw. He swore loudly as the man extricated himself from under him and elbowed him in the ribs. In a last-ditch effort, John tried to grab the man's sleeve, but his fingers only seized air as the criminal fled the scene.
Red tainted his vision and, before forming any coherent thought, he had leapt the few feet separating him from the man. His fist connected with his jaw with a loud crack. The man swore and threw his arms to grab him, but John was faster and kicked him in the plexus before decking him violently against his knee. The offender collapsed unconscious at his feet, but John was already checking the teenager for injuries. He removed the gag from her mouth. Her face was bruised and wet with heavy streaks of tears. He opened his mouth to ask her what was going on, but before he could get a word out, two figures armed with guns had materialised behind them.
John opened his mouth to speak, a frown creasing his forehead, but promptly closed it. He had no idea of what to ask, and the other two seemed just as confused. He shifted on his feet. Though he had been divested of his weapons and radio, his gear was still quite heavy and starting to take its toll on his stamina. The absence of means to defend himself if it all went tits up did not ease his mind one bit.
He ran a finger across the faint bloodstains on the ground. The pigs had been bled before being brought here and stuffed with the bacteria. The lorry had just been a distraction, a way to destabilise them and pique his interest.
“Either that gran has superhuman strength, or she's not alone,” the woman mused. Turning her face to John, she introduced herself. “I'm Gloria, and this is Scott,” she added, jabbing a finger at her colleague who still appeared to be in shock. He had seen this expression a few times too many to mistake it for anything else. Scott seemed to be on an entirely different plane of existence, pale and unseeing he advanced in the dark without a word. Gloria's complexion was not much better. She seemed ready to carry him through Hell if needed, but her eyes were marked, and her short blond hair was marred with blood. John wondered what he himself looked like. He doubted the answer would please him. They had been betrayed, shot at like rabbits, and, considering the way Major Sholto had reacted upon his return, were about to be punished for their trouble. The form that the latter would take was what worried him the most. The three of them had cheated death less than twenty-four hours ago, and he would appreciate for his next encounter to be as far away as possible.
Sherlock was able to see his every pore, could read the brand name on his glasses, count the threads of his moth-eaten cuffs, but
Each word was perfectly enunciated, despite the throbbing of his facial muscles. Disgust and hatred were twisting his features, and he took another step.
Fifty kilometres away, Rosamund M. Jones and Colonel Sebastian Moran were receiving a similar welcome.
A long string of curses flew fluently from Lestrade's mouth as he stuck his head out the Panda car's window.
Sherlock spotted John reaching for the inside of his jacket and freezing in his peripheral vision. Irate at this hesitation, he rolled his eyes. ‘Now would be a good time to make use of that gun, don't you think?‘
Nonchalantly, the cabbie lifted the pistol/cigarette lighter and released the trigger. The flame went out. “None of the others did.”
His fingers began to tremble with excitement and anticipation. His body remembered as it always did.
‘Oh, please!‘ the detective spat as his blood boiled. ‘Hope? NaCN? As though a low-level aspiring anarchist such as yourself would have wanted me on the case.‘
His blood ran cold. He crouched and looked from where he had come. Gloria was supposed to be behind the hill East of his position. He squinted against the sun as a strong gust of wind blew the end of his turban behind his right shoulder, but was unable to discern anything relevant. Hesitating, he took a second glance at his target through the lens, but she had disappeared.
Rosamund climbed down the steep hill. He had been well placed to take her out, she had to admit. She took off her hat, letting her short dark hair breathe at last.
“For every life I take, money goes to my kids. The more I kill, the better off they’ll be. You see? It’s nicer than you think.”
Indeed, the guards patted him down and released him. He jumped to his feet, ready to bolt, and took in his surroundings. They had ended up in a circular office devoid of windows or any obvious door. At the centre, a man in an impeccable three-piece suit and a grave expression stood. He held a stack of papers in one hand, the other behind his back.
John reached the top of the staircase without breaking a sweat. Almost there! His heart was beating furiously in his chest. The closer he got, the more intense the need to get there became. He made it halfway across the balcony when his blood ran cold. Beyond the staircase that would lead him to the object of his admiration, a man was dragging what looked to be a gagged teenager. The child was clawing at the ground as the man viciously kicked her in the head.
‘Bloody hell…‘ he whispered as he reached down for the culprit. ‘My cane.‘ He turned to Sherlock, aghast. Yet, where he had been expecting surprise, he only met smugness.
What should have been a relatively peaceful evening ended with the death of a soldier despite the Medical Officer's best efforts. It may have been the guilt, the shock, the incomprehension, or a mixture of the three, that lead to the debacle that followed.
They landed. He had barely put a foot on firm land when he was crammed into a jeep that drove them across the city to an inconspicuous house. The interior was quite cramped, and an old lady was sitting on a weary embroidered cushion. She gave them a small smile and resumed drinking her tea and stewing the content of her flimsy pot. Discoloured pieces of fabric hung on the tired walls, making the air feel stuffy and stale.
John barked out a disbelieving laugh as Sherlock parked in front of their flat. He left the keys in the glove compartment, a gesture to which his companion answered by raising his brow questioningly. The detective shrugged, causing John to shake his head with a chuckle.
Only Mycroft had remained. His brother had given him a small pat on the shoulder with an infuriating 'It's for the best.' before leaving him to wallow in his misery. Lestrade, taking pity upon him, had offered him a lift to his flat. Montagu street was far from ideal, but at least Sherlock could afford it. He would need to move, eventually.
A loud sound followed by statics made a chill run down his spine. “Juliet Two One Echo to Golf Two Two Alpha, what was that?”
John was exhausted, and sleep was not on the agenda if being whisked away by a helicopter to God-knows-where was any indication.
At a loss for words, John shook his head in disbelief and, cane in hand- yet not leaning on it- proceeded to his upstairs bedroom.
Feeling a thousand pounds lighter, John strode across the room, offering his hand to the man he had only thought of as 'The Violinist'.
Sherlock's patience was running thin. He took a step forwards, his intent clear on his face. No amount of protest from John would protect the worm this time.
A minute later, a burly man cracked the door open, squinting dubiously at them until his eyes landed upon Sherlock. He pulled the door wide open and gave them a brilliant smile. ‘Sherlock Holmes!‘ he exclaimed in a strong Italian accent, ‘Back at last!‘
In a rush of fury, the detective ducked and grabbed the man by his collar, shaking him violently. ‘I want a name!‘ he bellowed, centimetres away from the other's face. He could smell the stench of the breath coming out his slack mouth, its warm humidity on his chin.
Sherlock opened the door a crack but showed no sign of leaving the room. The rush had transformed into a wave, a tsunami and all forms of rationality were being drowned. Oh, how he craved it, this sweet sensation, the caress of his muse, the simple demonstration of what should figure above Lavoisier's principle:
One thing was for certain: CAM received a bullet between his hateful eyes, and John Watson was the one who put it there. A second of pure silence went by as the man seemed to fall in slow motion. He hit the ground with a limp thud. A beat and all hell broke loose.
For a moment, it was. It always was when taking a plunge. Ten, twenty, forty, eighty seconds went by, and Sherlock almost smiled, but as he took a breath, pain shot through his body like a bullet, and he fell to his knees.
“Blimey…” John muttered. He exchanged a gaze with his companion. She nodded and went to fetch her colleague whilst John carefully went down the first couple of steps. They were halfway down when they heard the piece of furniture being dragged over the entrance.
Each of their hands moved closer to their lips. The detective could almost taste the capsule on his tongue.
Mycroft Holmes, for his part, was not known for such blunders. By the time the British Government was made aware of the confusion, John had already been standing guard outside the enemy's base for an hour. Observing and aware of being observed, he was tense. In retrospect, it may have been his saving grace.
Time was meaningless in his state. He had no idea whether years or a couple of minutes had passed when footsteps brought his focus back for a split second, and it was gone again.
An hour later, he was in one of Saint Bartholomew's hospital's labs when, for the second time in his life, his whole world decided that it was imperative to revolve around a pair of clear eyes.
‘Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.‘ The voice of Greg Lestrade made them jump. The DI had snuck in from the blind spot of the vehicle and was now crossing his arms sternly. ‘Especially the part where Pearson got shot and later died of cyanide poisoning.‘
“Insubordination and slowness. Two unforgivable faults in a special agent, don't you think?” He began to read one of the papers he had been holding on to since they had arrived. “A surgeon. Above-average performances and a glowing review from your C.O., although your liaison with him might have influenced his praise.”
'Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?'
He moved to the computer across the room and clicked around for a bit, before letting out a triumphant “Ah! Here is the ‘dream team’, the ‘survivors’, and the 'soon-to-be-quartered-by-our-dear-Rosie's,” and projected on the larger screen the face and details of two men and a woman: Jonathan Hunter, Gloria Daley and Scott McKendall.
'Oh, just an interested party...' the man looked at his feet, 'Though I would appreciate if you were not. I do not doubt you will find a dancing partner amongst our fine guests.'
he intoned. “But, lucky for you, I'm going to do something reaaaaally crazy, completely mad.” The giggle returned as he lowered the gun. “I'm going to give you a second chance. Oh, don't make that face! I know I'm too generous.”
‘Here you go, gentlemen,‘ Angelo announced as he handed them two paper bags. He leaned in to speak in Sherlock's ear. ‘I put a candle in. You know, makes it more romantic.‘  With a wiggle of his brow, he shook their hands and brought them to their car.
He’s been worried all the way to North Walsham, and when he sensed the bad development upon arrival:
I sent Clara to Baker Street with a note for Holmes and remained on the doorstep, smoking. Holmes came at once; a quick, relieved smile passed over his lips when he saw me, and then he proceeded to my consulting-room.
“Good morning, Doctor Watson, I am Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, investigating the disappearance of one Stark Munro,” the police detective introduced himself.
Since the story was published in 1923, the concept of Holmes’s retirement as a beekeeper had already been introduced. So here’s the continuity is supported by Watson mentioning that CREE is “one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement” and Holmes remarking casually, “It’s surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of my dreams”.
When they discover the body of the German master, Holmes, already knowing that Heidegger gave his life to protect young Arthur, turns Heidegger’s body over
One Friday afternoon in July of 1896, I was resting at home, having completed my rounds during the earlier part of the day. Since Holmes’s return two years prior I maintained a rather small practice just a few blocks away from Baker Street. It enabled me to spend more time with my better half and be available for assisting him at once whenever it was necessary.
Whatever Holmes was doing, it took him until tea-time. His face betrayed nothing regarding the results of his outing, and all evening he spoke only of unrelated matters. As usual in such situations, I didn’t try to force his confidence. If he chose not to share, then he wasn’t ready yet.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. The solicitor continued to stare at me. The thought of remaining there was unbearable, so I turned on my heel and left. I all but ran through the office, not caring what the clerks might think. Thankfully, a cab was outside right at the curb. A tide of emotions within my chest was on the verge of spilling over. It was imperative to reach home before the dam broke.
.” Holmes chuckled at my widened eyes and lengthened face. “The sender is your ardent reader who obviously took to heart the lesson about typewriters and handwriting.”
“That’s Knowlton Court, the place where Mycroft let me know that you were alive. The owner of the estate was his chum by the looks of it,” John said.
“Pack your valise for a couple of days in the country and we’ll be off. Our train leaves in twenty minutes,” he ordered and headed to his room.
Tears didn’t let him finish. Wiping them with his sleeve, he reeled a little, as if light-headed. I was stunned, at a loss what might bring such a reaction. He had never cried in my presence for as long as I had known him. His mood swings were becoming very alarming of late.
Without looking away, I resumed rocking my hips, very gently this time, and frigged his throbbing cock in long, hard strokes. He met my thrusts, his eyes shining and his kiss-swollen lips parted, until he quivered in my arms and spent profusely between us. Seeing his enraptured face while his tight arse was clenching around my prick brought me to the crisis too. As a wave of pure bliss swept over me, I ejaculated, still thrusting into him, and Sherlock clung to me, a few more drops of semen spurting out of his still rigid member.
“For God’s sake, have you no sense at all?” I snarled. “Don’t you realise what’s going on out there? There are hundreds and hundreds of people desperate for medical help, and you drag me here to be your messenger boy? You gave Mrs. Hudson such a scare! What about her feelings? Fine, you have no respect for me; have you none for her?”
5) In EMPT and NORW Watson explained that he didn’t publish new stories for a long time due to Holmes’s explicit request. Taking into account that pressmen chased Doyle himself, it’s rather suggestive why Holmes didn’t want any more attention at that point of his life (in contrast with STUD where he lamented the lack of opportunities to make his name famous).
to see you. The thought of you out there, risking your life every second… I had to bring you back, if only for a few hours. And soon enough, a chance presented itself. You are not angry?”
His mouth drawn into a thin line, Mycroft rose to his feet. He certainly knew that there was nothing to be gained by further argument. His eyes flashed with disdain when he gave John a parting look.
And there comes a question of how exactly far Holmes went to get information from Agatha, and how innocent their dates were. Recently there was a discussion between
His long, pale fingers clutched the revolver. I lifted my gaze to the patient’s face. Ashen, his lips bluish, Sherlock smiled.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, put away my scattered things, and left the room. I hadn’t heard Mycroft’s carriage arrive, but there it was, once I glanced out of the window. When Mycroft Holmes entered, for a moment I reeled internally. He was dressed in sombre black. Again, that was to be expected, and yet…
We were taken to the nearest police station and thrown into separate cells for disorderly behaviour. The reporter was protesting vehemently, saying that I had assaulted him. I didn’t counter his claim, for it was the truth. My knuckles were bloodied and sore. My head was splitting, as if it was I who had received the blows and not the other way around.
That night, as we loved each other, I committed to memory each precious moment we shared, every little detail about my John that I would keep in my heart, facing the inevitable. In the early dawn I watched him sleep and thanked Heaven for the great gift of having met him.
Having reached the coast-line, we climbed the highest hill which provided an excellent vantage point to review the surroundings.
Why was I living and breathing? What for? After Maiwand he had helped me to find an answer, but now he was gone, gone. He had done it out of love. I may have returned home, but my heart remained at those wretched falls. And what was home without him?
“I’m hungry for your cock in me,” he whispered as he pressed me to the locked door behind us. “You gave me such an erotic dream.”
is well-known: its sales plummeted. I hadn’t been interested in money in the first place and frankly was relieved to have stopped there. I missed Sherlock. God, how I missed him. Turning to our past cases had made me feel his absence all the more keenly. My self-control was precarious, and I had to preserve my reason to be reunited with him one day.
I leaned in and claimed his lips again. Casting off our clothes between the hot, impatient kisses, we made our way blindly to the bed. Naked at last, we settled ourselves down, Sherlock on his side and I kneeling behind him. He produced the vaseline jar from the drawer of the bedside table. I took the jar and bent his upper leg, revealing his entrance. My rigid prick twitched at the sight of that enticing little hole. It was so tempting that I lowered my head and pressed a kiss to it, sensing a faint aroma of lavender soap. His cat-like love of personal cleanliness and that soap in particular have always made me burn. I lapped at the puckered rim, lavishing the hairs around it with saliva and grazing the gentle skin with my moustache. Sherlock began to shiver, but I was relentless—I teased the rim with my lips and teeth and then thrust my tongue inside.
We still had half an hour at our disposal, so we complied. I could not care less about my own thinness—it was my usual state—but on John’s account I agreed wholeheartedly. Bringing him back to his normal weight was of paramount importance.
Subdued moans were escaping John’s lips too as he was pushing into my welcoming body. I wished to embrace him, but he grasped my wrists and pinned my hands over my head. I could have come at that very moment. We both enjoyed occasionally a bit of manhandling, and our role-playing turned out to be rather
We washed under the refreshing jets of the shower and agreed to refrain from the plunge into the pool. Obviously, we were in no condition to be seen.
He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. (VALL)
With that, she left the room. Getting up required a lot of effort, for my legs seemed to be made of cotton-wool and my head was singing like a tea-kettle. I trudged to the bathroom where I looked at myself in the mirror for the first time in three weeks. I had grown quite a beard. My face was bloated and sallow, my eyes bloodshot. It was a striking resemblance with my father as I always remembered him. In appearance I took after him more than my brother, and now the image was complete.
He took me upstairs to a small room which was empty but for a few sacks of hay. As soon as the door closed behind us, his lips covered mine in a breathtaking kiss. Beside myself with happiness as I was, I couldn’t be at peace until I examined his wounds. They needed re-dressing, but the stitches were surprisingly intact after all he had been through. One of the sacks in the room contained various clothes, wigs, and clean towels. The latter I ripped into new bandages.
I was ready to strangle him then and there. Over the years Holmes’s pranks have tended to grow more elaborate and devious, but this one really crossed the line. It was no joking matter to me. People were dying, and instead of tending to them, I was wasting my time because of his silly whim!
These two, I have no words. ACD surpassed himself. Also, Watson met the doctor who had treated Holmes in the hall, as the man was leaving. It means that everything happened so fast—the assault, the hospital, being moved to Baker Street—that Holmes had literally no time to send a note to his Watson. He didn’t need to: Watson was there the instant he knew. An important detail: unlike in the Granada, in the Canon Holmes was assaulted in broad daylight in a public place. Meaning it was easy for the press to see. Meaning that Watson could have been simply busy doing the rounds, that’s why he was away—not because of some urgent surgery at night (Granada) or because he lived separately (the period necessary “no homo”).
Holmes sat up and proceeded to tell me about his recent investigation. It involved a cold-blooded murderer whom I later called Culverton Smith in the published story.
Holmes has his personal code of honour, he is ever the seeker of justice and won’t rest until he attains it:
When our lips parted, I kissed John’s neck and then shoulder, lavishing with attention the rugged bullet scar. I longed to feel his skin against mine, yet there was something peculiarly erotic in his being stark naked while I remained fully dressed. John steadied himself, clutching the mantelpiece with both hands again. He was ready for more rough fucking. I obliged and proceeded to slam into him relentlessly so that he sobbed in bliss. He would be sore the next day. Sitting and walking would remind him of our tryst, and he would smile to himself in his consulting-room or on his way to a patient.
I decided to take a day off so that Holmes’s recovery would not be disturbed by my other patients. Although he didn’t say anything, I could see in his eyes that he was deeply grateful. As we sat together smoking, I felt a half-forgotten sense of companionship, camaraderie. Somehow I didn’t believe Holmes had committed a dishonorable deed. I could be mistaken, of course, but I hoped that I was not.
At last he dropped his mask and showed his real self: he was annoyed and disappointed that he couldn’t have his way, but he was abandoning his goal. It was virtually unheard of.
John’s right hand caught mine by the wrist so that I stopped frigging him: he was getting too close to the crisis. I released his prick and circled my arm around his waist, moving slower and hitting his sweet spot gentler, without overwhelming his senses. John sighed luxuriously; tension in his body dissipated, his breath becoming calmer. I pressed myself to him and put my hand over his heart which was thrumming madly. He turned his head, and we kissed, our tongues entwining. Now our rhythm was relaxed, almost lazy, as we savoured the simple happiness our physical union brought us, the consummation of our closeness.
And so, half an hour later, I was strolling along the alley which joined Trafalgar Square with Leicester Square, passing by the military barracks. I was in my army uniform, all dressed up, as dashing as possible. I was pretending to be one of those fellows who didn’t mind making an extra bob by selling their bodies to rich gentlemen with certain inclinations.
I went upstairs to his room—the room which we shared ever since we had become lovers—locked the door, and flung myself onto our double bed. A trace of John’s scent still lingered on his pillow. I buried my nose into it and undid my trousers and drawers. Imagining that John’s hand wrapped around my prick, I gave myself a few strokes, but it only incited my hunger. It was not enough. With a frustrated groan I reached for the bedside table and rummaged in the lowest drawer where we kept a phallic toy. That would have to do until John’s return.
The thought of John, safe and informed, was a great consolation. Soon after Mycroft had let him know, I checked on John myself, in heavy disguise and keeping well distant. He seemed to be carrying on with his life; no drinking, gambling or anything of the sort. Seeing him across the street and staying away from him was agonising, yet it had to be enough.
I think that there’s a similar instance of wishing to protect the loved one at all costs in ‘The Final Problem’. At least this is how I read it: Holmes faked his death to save Watson from Moriarty’s organisation. I agree with Ritchieverse take
I got a present for him from my valise. Sherlock smiled fondly as he unwrapped a mahogany briar pipe. Then he raised an eyebrow, having noticed that the mouthpiece was detachable and that the stem concealed a stiletto blade.
“I’ve just come to England,” I replied, accosted by the saccharine rosewood smell of his perfume. “Back from Afghanistan recently. My tastes are rather extravagant, and I’ve lived a bit beyond my means upon returning. Now I’m open to new opportunities if you know what I mean.”
Holmes got up, made several infirm steps, and reeled. I caught him by the elbow of his good arm and led him back to the couch.
I was grateful for Sherlock’s foresight, for I was ravenous by the time we got to Fulworth. Fulworth was indeed a picturesque village, with solid Tudor homesteads at its core, weather-beaten and lichen-blotched but well taken care of. A small church stood at the edge of the older part of the settlement. Further from the bay and higher upon the hills there were modern buildings including a post office, a pharmacy, a grocery, and our destination—a pub called The Red Lion.
5. And then that infamous experiment with the lamp. Of course Watson wouldn’t leave Holmes to deal alone with danger, luckily for Holmes. It was pointed out many times before that Watson would do nigh impossible to keep Holmes from harm:
“The longer I live in London, the more I find those charms appealing.” John took a deep breath. “Ah, the sweet, tasty country air.”
without a word. While he was reading it, his expression changed from tepid to interested and at some point even amused.
Such was the beginning of my career as a man of letters. The plays I now write for Holmes and his theatre company have gained popularity over the six months we have been in France. This in turn provides us the opportunity to tour Britain, starting next month. The Game is afoot.
His phone chimed again as Donovan approached, eyebrows raised in consternation. Ignoring her pointed glare, he opened the text:
A hand grabbed his ankle, making him jump back in surprise. He blinked, trying to focus on the scene before him.
It was exactly as he had left it, bare and impersonal, safe for the duffel bag partially shoved under the bed. Yet, it felt warmer and more inviting than anywhere in the world at that instant.
,” a feminine voice whispered. “You are not Jonathan Hunter, but he is indeed dead. That idiot Moran, he didn’t even notice that one of his men had been replaced. Figures…”
does not know about you. So, here is what's going to happen.” She leaned in to speak in his ear and he got a whiff of her perfume. “Help is on its way. I have activated the GPS on your radio so they won't have any trouble finding you. You are going back to England or wherever you're from and lie the fuck low.” She spat the last words. “If I ever hear from you again, I will not hesitate to kill you. Have a good life, John.”
“There’s a name no-one says, an’ I’m not gonna say it either. Now, enough chatter.” He nodded down to the bottles. “Time to choose.”
His smile held no warmth, but John merely raised his brow, before frowning and biting his lower lip in mock concentration.
Suddenly, the sound of footsteps caught his attention, and his brow rose. Without looking up from his task, he tried to determine what had piqued his interest. The stride, the shoes... Those were not what one usually expected as such an event. But this night was anything but usual, after all. What an interesting turn of event, he mused. Having the military in the room was bound to complicate matters if push came to shove, which it most certainly would. He blinked as he heard one set of footsteps break the well-rounded rhythm. Curious as to what had led the soldier to distraction, he lifted his gaze. In retrospect, he should have known it had been a huge mistake, but as his eyes met those of the blond man clad in what could only be the night sky, Sherlock could not bring himself to care.
John heard Bill Murray snort quietly next to him. A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. No matter what Sholto might say, they had one night left in London and they intended to make the best of it, even if that required making arses of themselves faffing about in their mess dress amongst England's ponciests. A gala. Christ. He almost shook his head in derision, but their commanding officer shot them a glare.
Bang! The door burst open and they landed heavily on the fire-exit balcony. To their surprise, the suspect was already on the ground, running away from the slaughterhouse. Taking the stairs two at a time, the duo gave chase as fast as they could. Sherlock felt his blood beating in his ears as his feet barely touched the floor. It had been so bloody long!
She nodded, and they spent the rest of the way through the dark tunnel in silence. Finally, they reached a dead-end.
Lestrade burst in such hysterics that Sherlock would have feared for his life as the car almost hit a lamp pole were he not so mortified.
Swearing loudly, he collected his equipment and got to his feet, intent on finding Gloria. He did not have the time to turn around before he found himself knocked on his back. Incomprehension, then an indescribable pain pierced through his shoulder, and he tried to shout, but could not find his breath. He tried to call, but air would not enter his lungs. The second pulse of excruciating pain went through him, and fire ran through his veins. He could not move, he could not breathe, he was going to die, and...
“Understand that you have made powerful enemies, Captain. You might walk out of here alive, but your respite will not last for long.”
Indeed, when orders were delivered to the tent of the late operative where John was still looking for the creature responsible for the tragedy, a mistake happened, and he allowed it to. That might have been why the following day, Captain John Watson found himself escorting a press mogul to a meeting with a prominent figure of the Taliban along with five other soldiers that may or may not have been special ops. Three years on the front had taught him to obey first and ask questions later if he still wished to know by then.
,” he cooed, “I'm not going to kill you! What do you think I am, crazy?” He giggled girlishly until his face suddenly gained back its steel. “You do, don't you?”
She knew Moran and his methods; she might be specialised in assassination, but she had class. Him, despite his intelligence, was nothing but a boar. Where she would be efficient and to the point, even when it came to torture, he liked it long and messy. A faint shiver went down her spine as she remembered him throwing away the pliers she had handed him and using his teeth to tear a prisoner's nails off. Begrudgingly, she recognised his efficiency. The man had spilt the beans and then some...
“Until then it was hardly my business, my dear boy. And it quite bothers me that our best agents are no match for this grey cardinal.”
“Absolutely not,” Watson exclaimed indignantly. “I shall not wear my uniform under false pretences.”
Our time of separation hadn’t been easy on either of us. While Sherlock didn’t care about his own thinness, he took mine very seriously, so our meals were more nutritious, our visits to the gymnasium more frequent, and our workload less strenuous than of old.
“If you have called me via this channel, it must mean that there are some complications,” he continued in a calmer manner.
“Oh, John, do you realise what you’re saying? A stranger’s house, having to act properly, tolerate his family, and being unable to touch you or even look at you in a way that’s not appropriate for a friend!”
We decided to leave in the dead of night, at half past three, and first visit one of his boltholes, where forged passports were hidden. It was surprisingly easy to get ready for the departure: my scarce belongings barely filled my Gladstone bag, and I settled my debts to tradesmen. My rent had been paid until the end of the month. Having put Martha’s earnings into an envelope, I thrust it under her door.
When I woke up in the morning, I was amazingly refreshed despite having slept in an armchair. Holmes was still sleeping, and I allowed myself to regard his peaceful face for a few minutes. It was so good not to be alone. I had rarely, if ever, felt such an affinity with anyone.
.” This is a story in which mystification of the public is an important point of the plot. It’s safe to assume that Watson mystifies his public on a regular basis. He is as masterful as Holmes in ruses of all kinds. Here Holmes does take Watson into his confidence about his plan which means that the statements from HOUN and EMPT that Watson is too transparent to hold a secret are full of bs. Watson was even perceptive enough to see that Holmes was convalescing faster than he appeared to. I think Holmes hid from Watson the intent of burgling Gruner just because Watson wouldn’t have let him to run around with a bandaged head. I wonder whether Holmes deliberately let the thugs injure him to a certain extent for the sake of the plan, because on previous occasions he had stood up for himself just fine. On the other hand, Watson wasn’t with him to help, so who knows.
Newspapers were full of sensational headings about the encounter between Moriarty and myself, albeit all referring to the Reuter’s short dispatch which in turn cited the local Swiss paper almost verbatim. Thankfully, no one seemed to know the real circumstances. Mycroft provided me with finances and other means, so I carried on, deeply under cover, arranging subversive activities against the syndicate.
“No, I’d best retire,” I replied, withdrawing my hand. “Thank you for a wonderful evening, Colonel.”
It was heartwarming to receive some support for a change. Holmes’s criticisms certainly hadn’t given me much confidence, especially at the time of repeated rejections by various publishers. Meanwhile, Holmes looked mildly discomforted by the Colonel’s gesture of familiarity towards me. I was torn between the joy of my writing being praised and concern for my partner, so I changed the topic. It worked. Holmes and the Colonel discussed at length types of soils, and from that point the conversation flowed again. I was glad they found a common ground, and that there was a noticeable shift in Sherlock’s mood. Energy seemed to be returning to him.
In a few moments Lestrade caught up too, panting, and fastened hand-cuffs on Saville’s wrists. However, Lestrade was alone, without Holmes. My heart pounding in terror, I dashed back to the main hall. Five minutes must have already elapsed and there had been no explosion, yet I sighed in relief only upon seeing him by the clock castle, alive and well.
Holmes opened the camera and took out the glass plate. But as he was passing it, he let it slip between his fingers. It smashed to smithereens against the marble floor.
Upon reaching Eastbourne, we hired a dog-cart at the station and had a most enjoyable ride amongst the peaceful hills and meadows of East Sussex. A gentle breeze carried bittersweet notes of wild herbs and flowers and of the soil thoroughly warmed by the sun. The rare rural dwellings were scattered far apart from each other, yet this serene land was teeming with life. There was no clatter of countless feet on the pavement or shrill noises of machinery. Instead there was the singing of crickets and the buzzing of bees.
There was a tap at the door, and Mrs. Hudson came in with a tray which emanated divinely delicious smells.
“Yes, there’s still a lot to be done,” the Colonel said. “But it’s very satisfying to see the results emerge gradually.”
The following passage is quite curious because: a) it shows that not only Holmes can deduce Watson’s train of thoughts by observing his features, but Watson does it with him as successfully; b) Holmes
Now that we are together at last, I don’t want to look back anymore. Sherlock is here beside me. Tomorrow is the 4th of May, and I shall meet the new day with my mind and soul at peace.
“Sherlock, I have an idea,” I said to him. “How about a week in the country? It will do you a world of good. I’ve received a letter from my old army comrade, Colonel Hayter, whom I treated while we served in Afghanistan. He has a residence in Surrey not far from Reigate.”
Suddenly I was grabbed from behind and forcefully dragged into a narrow dead-end between the houses.
Still, he did seem to be especially keen on my opinion about the house. His motive surely lay on the surface. Either way, it was simplicity itself, so I decided to observe and analyse as per his directions.
It was a moment of epiphany. I could not go on hurting John. Ending our relationship was not an answer: that would serve only to put him (and me) on the path of self-destruction. It was out of the question. But I could try and mend the damage—I had to do everything in my power to make John happy, be it abandoning cocaine or learning to keep regular hours. I had to become a better partner for him. From that point forward, it became my resolve.
For a long while we enjoyed the utter languor which seized our still connected bodies. We were loath to become separate, not just yet. I felt blessedly serene snuggled up to Sherlock even as my prick was softening within him. His heartbeat comforted me, sounding steady and healthy, a far cry from the way it had been when he had collapsed. During the three years we had been apart, even though he had let me know he was alive, being unable to help had been the worst for me. Now, by his side again, at least I could take care of him. I could ease his pain if he was suffering, physically or mentally. I had his back and could protect him, either from rogues or from himself.
He almost choked on his next fit of chuckles, and Sherlock joined him, feeling light. It was unlike him. It was only a result of his emotional exhaustion. It was strange. It was out of his comfort zone. It would not last. Yet, for some reason, he could not bring himself to care when the man sitting next to him was offering such a radiant smile.
'… Now, I understand that you may have forgotten what polite company is, but for God's sake, if one of you starts behaving like a baboon in heat, I'll make you clean the entire camp with a toothbrush once we're back in Kandahar. Am I making myself clear?'
Positioning his bow over the D string, he forced himself to focus as he pressed his ring finger to it. Midnight was three minutes away, just enough time to play Shostakovich's Waltz No 2 before joining Lestrade. He needed to confirm that the soldier's eyes were the colour of the sky. It was crucial. Why? He had no idea.
As he walked to the door, he heard the sound of the gun being laid onto the desk and the creak of his adversary's seat.
The sneer on the man's face made him doubt he had not spoken the last question aloud. “Do not concern yourself with such matters, Captain. They are safer than you. In your place, I would rather work on learning to keep my mouth shut than exhaust my feeble little mind with such
Without waiting for an answer, he strode towards the soldier, his soldier, his heart beating loudly in his ears. The man who had looked so fierce upon arrival suddenly seemed a bit sheepish under Sherlock's scrutiny. He did not feel any disappointment as he received a coy smile that almost made him stumble. The man ruffled his golden blond hair whilst averting his gaze.
The shot rang out and their assailant let out a pained yelp. He had lost his grip on his handgun, which crashed on the tiles below.
Then, a toothy smile, the floor, a door bursting open, and the collective scream of thirty trillion cells, all melting together and whirling before his eyes as he gasped for air.
, he wanted to cry. Yet his lips remained unmoving whilst foam began to escape those of the criminal.
John raised gingerly to his feet. His front was now covered in dust, but he could only think of the absence of the characteristic sound of the violin that had ruled his evening. Surely, he had not left, had he? As soon as the officers gave him the go-ahead, he hurtled down the stairs, still feeling their suspicious gaze. Finally, he arrived at the scene. But upon closer inspection, he felt the bottom of his stomach drop.
The demand sounded distant, distorted as the detective's brain provided a flux of information. Memories. Memories of losing the ability to swallow, breathe, of feeling his organs shut down as he fell into unconsciousness, of the visceral and consuming dread that had-
John flexed his leg gingerly but did not feel anything aside from a light soreness due to their running around. He put the cane down and pushed it under his bed. It had not been twenty-four hours since he had arrived, but he already felt at ease, which was a cause for worry in itself. He extended his fingers. His steady fingers.
The man let out a painful rasp akin to laughter. ‘He told me you'd stick your oar in. Didn't think it would end up like that, though.‘
His violin had been returned to him as a congratulatory gift upon achieving long-term sobriety. Whilst under the influence, he had not bothered with working on his scales daily, or even monthly for that matter. The instrument had been left aside not to be touched again the day he had turned twenty-two. His stomach turned. Of course, he had worked tirelessly for the last month to make up for lost times, but every squeak, every wrong note reminded him of how far he had fallen, from being a simple user to 'addict', as Mycroft put it. He closed his eyes shut for a heartbeat, trying to drown the inane blather of the room. It was still early, so only a handful of guests had arrived, but it still felt overwhelming. It could not be over fast enough...
With his pyjamas on, he reached for his cane and stared at it as it rested in his hands. He had not noticed and would not have, had he not tripped on it.
John set his jaw and straightened his back. Two weeks before, he had been flat on his stomach in the burning sand whilst bullets grazed his helmet, trying to pull out one of his mates from a ditch where a mine had sent him flying. He was not about to be intimidated by that toff. Their glaring match was suddenly interrupted by an unholy screeching sound that made both of them jump in surprise.
Flashing blue lights and the click of cameras... John could almost taste the migraine that threatened to rear its hideous head. Hours after the suspect's demise, they were sitting in the back of a parked ambulance, watching the comings and goings of the officers and paramedics through its open doors. They were covered in mud and had sustained a few scraps, but nothing alarming, though John suspected he would have a splendid bruise in the morning.
As unusual as it was, Sherlock Holmes felt anxious. It was peculiar and quite puzzling as he had been certain he had managed to do away with such frivolity years ago. Yet, as he frowned at his violin, apprehension clawed through his gut. Analysing the feeling, he came up with a couple of reasons for its intrusion.
The suspect's tongue moved inside his mouth, and he bit down on something. A faint crunch sounded, and, before either John or Sherlock could act, his face split in a mad grin. ‘Trust me, Mr Holmes,‘ he grunted after swallowing with apparent difficulty, ‘those little pills are preferable to what he does with those who stand in his way.‘
John stretched, feeling better than he had in a long time. The food had been excellent, the wine delicious, and the day stimulating. Next to him, Sherlock was texting rapidly, muttering under his breath. The candle had gone out, leaving for only sources of light a feeble table lamp and the detective's mobile. A yawn interrupted his meticulous consideration of his companion's typing. He rubbed his eyes with his palms as the exhaustion finally caught up to him.
Gloria, who had become his friend so easily when he had lost everyone. When he had lost James and Murray. Gloria and her sharp brown eyes, loud laugh and her cool head. Scott had been more difficult to get along with. He had never managed to get over the death of his Commanding Officer, Colonel Sebastian Moran. John had grown to like him, nonetheless. His stoicism and deadpan humour, the comfortable silence they shared... Then, like so many others, a bullet had taken him. A head shot whilst tracking the last of the men present on the day they all met, John had not been able to do anything about it.
The man chuckled bitterly, bringing John back to his senses. “We may still make something out of you, though I do not hold much hope.” He gave a dismissive flick of his hand and two guards shouldered John. “You are dismissed. Your training will begin tomorrow morning.”
‘...Straight from the bottle, it is,‘ John replied as he popped it open with the corkscrew from the detective's Swiss army knife.
“You’re not playin’ the numbers, you’re playin’ me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff?”
His pager pinged, and he sighed as he reached for it. There was but one person who had access to this communication channel.
With one last glance of confirmation, the soldier aimed. His hand was perfectly still and, with a look of hardened concentration on his face, he pressed the trigger.
Mycroft, that tosser, was trying to keep the soldier away long enough so Sherlock would have left by the time he reached the orchestra. Fury flooded his senses and, impulsively, he gave a sharp twist of his bow across the A and E strings, coaxing an ungodly screech from his instrument. Every gaze turned to him. He had feared that precise situation, but at that moment, his rage at his brother prevented him from feeling any embarrassment at his blunder. The piece had been almost over, anyway. He glared at Mycroft, silently communicating his will to see him lose all his teeth, but luckily for his insufferable sibling, the pleasing view of the soldier's cheeky salute made his anger abate.
‘...Fine.' the man sighed. 'You'll just have to include it in your statement. The poisoning is what killed him, anyway.‘ He took out a file from the inside of his jacket and handed it to the detective. ‘I'm only lending you this, mind.'
He stopped in his tracks. The man was lying on the sofa, immobile, seemingly asleep. John crossed the room to reach him and confirmed his assumption. Sherlock had dozed off in his clothes, his mobile in his right hand. His shirt was creasing in a way that would make ironing it incredibly tedious, but his usually tense features were relaxed. It felt like intruding on an intimate scene, a private moment he had not been meant to witness.
“Wilco, Golf Two Two Alpha.” John shifted, his chest digging deeper in the dust as he got closer to the scope of his rifle. “Target is female, medium height, average build, white. Too far to give an accurate description of her features. Black hat, black bodysuit, bullet-proof jacket, appears to be holding a 308 Win or another type of long-range rifle.”
‘It was me.‘ Sherlock announced in a steady tone, surprising both the ex-army doctor and the DI,  ‘John tackled him to the ground and I took his gun. You will find my fingerprints on it. He escaped, and I fired.‘
Sighing out of a combination of exasperation and disappointment, Hope simply lifted the pistol. “You can take your fifty-fifty chance, or I can shoot you in the ‘ead. Funnily enough, no-one’s ever gone for that option.”
Hot red coloured John's vision, but before any retort could escape his mouth, he was hauled out of the room.
might have repercussions far graver than the death of a handful of soldiers, Captain. You have no idea of what your actions have and will cause.” Reaffirming his grip on his temper, the official turned his back and sighed once more. “I am afraid I cannot let you simply walk away, now.”
Eventually, the officers took off their handcuffs. It had taken ten minutes of the teenager trying to defend him, but breaking down before ending any of her sentences before they finally understood that he had nothing to do with whatever was going on.
That sound. It was gorgeous. It felt like finding the piece he did not know he missed. It was far too much for Sherlock. Any coherent thought left his head as he closed the distance between them, taking the soldier's face between his hands. Indeed, his eyes were the exact shade of blue he had imagined, he mused before closing his and inclining his head to capture the man's lips.
“Now, you might be wondering why you were brought here.” The man suddenly looked very tired and sighed. “You might have also realised by now that you were not supposed to be sent on yesterday's mission. You have witnessed events of the utmost confidentiality and murdered someone of very high profile.”
The soldier had decided to come along, Sherlock observed. Fantastic! Two birds with one stone, he thought as he jumped over the bannister, closely followed by his new companion. The man Sherlock had seen was the missing piece, the Provider, the one bringing all those children to these men and women of power to use and abuse at their leisure. He could not let him escape. The soldier might have realised that, too, as he suddenly accelerated and passed Sherlock to tackle their target. It was wonderful and Sherlock almost shouted out of sheer excitement. The Provider fell face-first against the marble with a loud slam. The soldier, on the other hand, had regained his balance immediately and was putting him in a headlock before tying his wrists behind his back with the handcuffs Sherlock handed him. Satisfied with his work, he got up and tapped his hands as to dust them.
The sudden exclamation interrupted his train of thoughts and he turned around to finally, finally face the person who had habited his mind all evening. A few feet away, he was panting a bit, a thin sheen of sweat covering his sun-kissed skin.
He cleared his throat and took another gulp of wine. ‘Usually, yes,‘ he answered, locking his gaze with the doctor’s own.
“With all due respect, sir.” John winced internally. His sleep-deprived brain was having trouble controlling his mouth. “It was an act of self-defence.”
A surge of relief went through John as the DI walked away, and Sherlock grunted as he opened the folder.
Of course, he had a firm grasp on anatomy, biology, chemistry and physics to the extent it applied to the field of medicine. Certainly, being curious by nature, he enjoyed dabbling in other subjects. He was fond of astronomy and had used this inclination more often than he would like to admit to charm his way into someone's bed. There was something undeniably smooth about sneaking one's arm around the other's shoulders whilst explaining the Kinematics of the Earth rotation and what it implied about the visibility of constellations.
“John,” he answered with a weak smile. Just as she had done, he refrained from offering his last name.
“You’re not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There’s others out there just like you, except you’re just a man...and they’re so much more than that.”
” he hissed. He didn’t have much choice, did he? The inspector unfastened his seatbelt and bolted out, running as though the Devil was on his tail.
‘Thank you, but I think John has had a long enough day dealing with me and would rather go home.‘ He looked pointedly at the bruise that had started to blacken on his jaw.
Sherlock let out an amused breath. ‘Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.‘
Tailing him, they arrived at a door. A green sign indicated that it led outside. They paused and Sherlock counted to three with his fingers whilst John got into position.
He was in free fall and he revelled in it. The violinist was beautiful and it took everything in John not to march right up to him and kiss him. Yet, he could not bring himself to move. He was frozen in place, frozen in time. Fortunately, the other man did not seem to suffer similar affliction and, a few strides later, they were face to face. That was when John realised he had gone into this without a plan.
Sherlock grunted, unwilling to move. He grabbed the bags and rummaged through them, getting a set of wooden cutlery and the candle out. ‘Unnecessary,‘ he remarked as he leaned over the tea table to retrieve his lighter, ignoring John's interrogating look, and brought the flame to the wick. Handing a set of utensils to the doctor, he laid the food out in front of them. Lasagna, two peach and almond crostata, and a bottle of Barbera.
My train of thought was rudely interrupted by a shove from behind. Someone had almost knocked me down while making his way through the crowd, and I had dropped my stack of books.
I whirled around to have a look at him. There was a predatory glint in the fellow’s sly eyes, his face expectant. He was clearly pleased that his words had affected me. I didn’t realise at first that the snarl I heard was mine as I sprang forward. The first blow felled him, and then I was beating him black and blue. His attempts to shield himself only incensed me further. I would have done him grave injury, had it not been for the police. A deafeningly shrill whistle rang across the street, and in a few moments two sets of hands were pulling me away from the reporter.
In fact, everything in the house bespoke Mycroft’s hand: the house was spacious and comfortable to the point of decadence, yet its opulence never descended into bad taste. It was a bigger and richer version of his London club, with its ornate furnishings and soft lights. A drawing-room styled as an Eastern boudoir was adjacent to a large billiard-room and an enormous library whither one could escape unnoticed from one’s guests, alone or in the company of another. The purpose of this establishment was obvious.
Upon closer examination, it turned out that the man had a broken collarbone and a damaged subclavian artery. That was why he was losing so much blood. I had mere minutes to stitch him up or he would certainly bleed to death.
I sat up, adjusting my clothes. Of course Sherlock’s brother would wish to know all the circumstances. One could expect that, and I owed it to him.
In spite of his disgruntled mood, Mycroft considerately remained at the Diogenes Club while I went to see John through the secret underground tunnel which led to Mycroft’s flat in Pall Mall, across the street. It has always been a special pleasure to surprise John. The expression on his face was priceless when I walked into the drawing-room, with no sound from either the front door or the back-door. The next moment I was in his arms. As ever, being apart and worrying about each other had the predictable effect on us. We discussed our impromptu continental holiday somewhat later, in bed.
Suddenly her face became very red, she staggered and started to sink down to the floor. I dashed to her. Having caught her just in time, I led her to the armchair by the fireplace and made her recline. A glass of water with bromide of potassium and an unbuttoned collar had good effect: in a few minutes she recovered enough to be accompanied downstairs.
I rushed to him. Thankfully, the wall behind him had softened his fall; he sank down against it without injuring himself. I took him in my arms and carried him to the couch. He felt lighter than I remembered.
I loosened my tie, suddenly feeling hot. What on earth was happening to me? I had never found men in uniform particularly attractive. Soldiers, sailors, or telegraph boys were often on par with common streetwalkers, offering themselves to anyone willing to pay. But John was a different matter. His honour, his bravery, his loyalty, all his finest qualities seemed to shine as he was standing at attention, devastatingly handsome in military attire. It was a lethal combination. I was slain outright.
“Imaginative, isn’t it?” Holmes said, smiling. “The sender must have prepared and posted the parcel in relative safety, for the strip of paper with my name is cut out and pasted with flour paste in a neat, careful fashion. You recognised, of course, the print.”
I gaped at him, speechless. One might expect him to be a criminal with connections in the government or a foreign spy, but an outright restorationist? And his brother too? While some countries, like France or Argentina, had freed themselves from the yoke of the invaders, I had never heard of restorationists being active in New Albion.
I checked on Holmes several times—he was either asleep or reading newspapers avidly, as if searching for something. He ate every meal that was brought up to him, apparently having set a goal of getting better as quickly as possible. I had to admit to myself that I was as curious as my patients. I kept wondering what had happened to him but he had hardly encouraged my curiosity.
We boarded the Eastbourne train and settled ourselves down in a vacant first-class carriage. Holmes reclined in the cushioned seat, stretched his long legs in front of him, and lit his pipe. He seemed to be in a content, relaxed mood which was rather inconsistent with the austere manner he usually had while at work. On the other hand, on some occasions he preferred to detach himself from the matter until more data was at his disposal.
“Something to think about, eh, Doc?” Stamford said, stamping out the cigarette stub. “Well, I’d best make myself scarce. So long!”
“In time there will be a movement for freedom,” Holmes whispered, his eyes suddenly burning and vehement. Once again, he seemed to be reading my thoughts. “All over the Empire. If other countries could do that, so can we.”
“Don’t you find it still early for that, Mr. Holmes? Consider the amount of stress he’s accumulated over the past three years,” John intervened, before I could retort.
My senses were numb. I had lost the ability to feel or think and merely drifted along. Boarding the train and travelling without Sherlock wasn’t right. My mind could not adjust to the reality of it. I was constantly expecting that he would come into the carriage, maybe in disguise, maybe as himself, and explain that it was a part of some ingenious plan. Yet hours and hours passed, the Channel was crossed, and nothing changed.
“Then this charity event shall be used as an opportunity to attack an MP and his family, with numerous children as innocent victims? By whom? Anarchists?”
Some sort of mechanical reaction took over my body while my mind was stunned. I snatched up the books, uttered an incoherent snarl, and quickly hobbled away. My feet carried me forward without conscious thought; when I had come to my senses, I found myself in the outskirts of the Park, leaning against the fence. John’s emaciated frame and gaunt face were still before my eyes. What in the name of Heaven had happened to him? At the time of our parting he had been a youthful man in his prime, full of strength. Now, at forty-one, he was a shadow of his former self, as if a chronic ailment had robbed him of his vitality and made him wither prematurely. He looked as if he suffered from consumption at an advanced stage.
At last, the police departed, and all was quiet again. The final act of the play was typical for 221b, Baker Street: Holmes and I were sitting in our armchairs on either side of the fire.
A wave of dread crashed over me, constricting my chest and throat. I struggled to breathe, but all I could manage were shallow gasps like those of a drowning man. My mouth went dry; cold, clammy perspiration chilled my skin. I grasped hard at the fence, fighting a fit of vertigo. I must pull myself together. No more running away. I must go and face John properly.
‘Nobody sent me, Mr Holmes,‘ he croaked. ‘T'was my own project.‘ He gave Sherlock a grimace that might have been intended as a smirk.
Sherlock chuckled. It was a sharp sound that almost seemed accidental. ‘Fine,‘ he sighed dramatically, ‘If I must.‘ Taking out a few papers, he began to read. ‘Derek Pearson, 24. Already known by the authorities following several acts of vandalism and disorderly conduct. Ran his inherited family business into the ground and was forced to sell. Combine that with his ideology, and he became the perfect pawn…‘ Sherlock had stopped reading and was now staring into the air. ‘He cannot have carried this out on his own. The operation might have been mild, but it was intended as such. What truly mattered to his "sponsor" was the message…‘
Jesus, even his voice was the loveliest thing John had ever heard. Suddenly, the man interrupted himself, focusing on something behind John before taking off in a flash. Without taking any time to think, he followed him. Whatever was going on, he would not let him face it alone.
