There’s no use resisting, is there?
"Damn it!" John pants, brows knitted, reaching for Sherlock's hand.
He knows this. But it’s so, so hard.
Sherlock can't help but feel a certain gratitude that John was wise enough to push for this respite from the current case.  He'd certainly let his frustrations over the Moriarty situation bleed into the case work.  A bit not good.  Not good at all.  He needs to be clear-headed to tackle these new circumstances.
Sherlock is quick, done before John's finished up the washing.  He steps out of the shower, with the towel around his hips, pulling the ziplock bag off his injured hand, only to stop by the gilt mirror to inspect his hair.  He frowns, adjusts some curls, stretches his neck to see better. Then he grabs the frame and angles the mirror to get a better look, while he attempts to fix the hair on the back of his head.  Clearly, it doesn't work as well as he'd like it.  He drops the mirror carelessly in frustration, making it swing precariously from its hook.  "Bloody useless hand."
“Oh. Right… Actually, I’m sorry I haven’t asked, but what kind of class is that?”
He was selfish to go back to her.
She’s prodding at his sore spots and he doesn’t like it.
"You bloody berk!" John seethes.
John touches it with his thumb.
Below it, stacked against the few remaining boards and battens, is a pile of rounded shapes, blackened and broken.
"He's kept his room tidy, no dishes except for this plate with crumbs and a spot of marmalade and this emptied cup of tea with some dregs of milk."  Sherlock sniffs the mug.  "Not too spoiled, considering the heat.  He's retired, so I imagine he doesn't have commitments early in the morning, except to bring Miss Cushing her paper.  It looks like something or someone must have disturbed his morning routine."
John feels a sudden pang of melancholia.  He knows all about a hard as rock outer shell, with a beautiful inside.  If only Sherlock wasn't so hard to crack open.
, his irrational fear of Sherlock being an actual sociopath. His fear of falling apart, losing control of his demeanour.
“Er, we didn’t really- I mean, I haven’t been the most consistent user of- not just with Mary, but-”
After the accommodation and pick up point is settled, they seek shelter behind the restaurants and shopping malls.  They wait for their ride in the boring residential area surrounding the inner harbour, where giant luxury boats are shielded from the storm.
So he offers a false apology, creates a tale of dangers and risks and horrible outcomes. He writes Sherlock a letter, saying he can’t do such things anymore, not when he’s become a father.
“I don’t know how to fix this,“ he croaks, then sobs. “How to fix me.”
Tears are prickling John's eyes.  "Are we?"
He makes a slow circuit around the body as he puts on a pair of nitrile gloves and brings out his small torch.  "The body is in
Sherlock can't help himself.  He touches John's hair, then the moist corner of his mouth.
Sherlock is apparently already done, as John can see him hovering by the door to the flat.  He comes closer, taking the plastic bag, weighing it in his hand.  "Miss Cushing, exactly how long have you been receiving these letters?"
"In her kitchen?"
"Killjoy," Sherlock scoffs and turns to leave with John.
The only thing he's sure of, is that he can't lose Sherlock to Moriarty's games.  The case was a good catalyst to break the pattern, the trip even better.
“That’s different for everyone. And it’s common to re-evaluate ones views on what brings happiness, or rather what you value in life. The bottom line is if your definition is consistent with what you want to achieve, or if you’re holding yourself to unreasonable standards.”
Mycroft looked at the cake, and whispered, “
“Yes, I see.”
He liked to watch her mouth, her lips, her whole expression, change as she pushed the slicked dildo inside herself.
“Now, if you want Miss Clara to put your naughty willie in her pussy, you’d better behave.”
“Sounds like a plan to me! Gentlemen or players first?”
“True,” admitted Holmes. “But honey, despite what the bees believe, does have its limitations.”
“Wha—?!”
“Like a bat!” cries Lestrade.
Irene twisted her hand and teased Molly’s clit with one finger.
Lestrade aimed his cock into one of the towels and swore as it spit glob after glob.
Sherlock/John. Watersports. First time.
The following morning, the knock at John’s bedroom door sounded about two minutes after he awoke.
“Half of the profits,” announced our good landlady. “Doctor Watson’s share. I advised him to put his restless fretting about your welfare to better use than wearing holes in my rugs, and he did. He produced so many pies, savory and sweet, that I’d no recourse but to sell some of them. Word got round, and, well, for a short spate, Watson’s pies were in demand. I put some of the money earned into purchasing more ingredients, but there is still a surplus.”
“Are you all right, Holmes?”
There are about nine days left in the Merry Month of Masturbation, so I'm going to try to do some more wanking fic.
Sherlock rose onto his knees and pushed Mycroft’s vest up to his shoulders, exposing his chest. “You are not weak, I am not decayed, not yet, at any rate,” he muttered. He licked then scraped his teeth across each nipple.
“Sherlock, I don’t want to tell you your business.”
I'm participating in the DW Snowflake Challenge and Day 7 is to try something new (e.g, a new pairing--or in this case, threesome).
“Confess:  you like the ginger.” He bent his head.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
“Just doing my job. Have a good day.”
A highball is whiskey and sode/gingerale and ice in a tall glass.
Molly enjoys herself at the masquerade. Molly/Multi, Unspecified. Orgy.
“Dear me,” Lestrade breathed at the triangles of lace. “This is new.” The lace was yellow, not pale, not golden, but sunny and rich. “Mind if I call you ‘sunshine’ for this one?”
“Be as bold as you like, Mister Holmes,” interjected Lestrade in a weary tone. “It’s a refreshing as a sea breeze, the one that shows absolutely no signs of disturbing us.”
“Fuck careful!” cried John. His eyes were pinched shut; his lips were pressed against the top of the car window.
They both groaned as their damp cunts brushed over and over again.
“There.”
Damn it!
He took a drag. “Don’t worry. I’m already dead.”
We were keeping out of the storm for the moment, huddled close under a swath of canvas.
But back to the simile.
Since John’s wet tongue met Sherlock’s flat nipple.
“You want me to kill them?”
“If Lestrade weren’t so busy wrapping up his current caseload and finishing his paperwork before his leave, he’d have been round to tell you himself,” said Sherlock, with a tiny bit of whine in his voice. “That’s what I thought would happen, that’s what I hoped would happen, but then you had to get deliciously upset, and he’s still maddeningly occupied apparently, and so I suppose it’s up to me to tell you all about it.”
“Hey,” grumbled Seb in mock protest. “I’m blonde, too!”
“Beautiful suffering never goes out of style, I suppose,” remarked John dryly, but for the first time in his life, he genuinely wished he had even a little artistic inclination. He would’ve welcomed the opportunity to freely ogle, though John doubted his ability to represent the figure in any medium but his own drool.
I slowed my stroking of Holmes’s prick, looked up, cupped my free hand ‘round the back of his head, and brought his face to mine. It was a hard, bruising kiss. I tore my lips away abruptly and began to nuzzle at his neck.
His prick was half-hard, too.
Sherlock began to sashay, swinging his hips, two steps forward, then pivoting and doing the same two steps back like an inebriated runway model trying to find an Uber by shouting.
“To study my scar.”
John’s embarrassment melted in the heat of Sherlock’s gaze.
“Being dead isn’t as much fun as you’d think.”
“Cecaelia Cove isn’t the easiest place to find, Mary,” said John as he peeled off his pants, “and we can’t exactly ask for directions. ‘Oh, have you see a lovely lady who seems to not have her hands full at all?”
“Hold on and let me?”
He smiled and shook his head, then said,
Mycroft rushed forward.
“Well, hurrah for life-long commitment in institutions!”
I stomp to the shed and exchange the rake for a smaller, more delicate version. Then I approach the bed, humming.
“Don’t be cross. I like you. Better.”
“AARGH!” screamed Molly.
“And this is just the beginning, love. It’s your birthday. You get fucked however you want, as often as you want, any position, well, any position I can manage, all day long.”
Sherlock Holmes was also a cipher. He spoke in code. For example, one evening, he asked me to attend a trial on the following day and take notes. I asked him what he wanted with such a case; it had appeared in the papers and seemed to be a straightforward, simple matter of murder.
“The red’s done,” said Kate, wiping the blade and setting it on the cloth which covered the little table.
“Seb and a cat!”
The first time he saw the decimation of his hard work, he was horrified, but then he caught sight of a pair of bright eyes looking at him curiously.
“Not pressing the question of why I am here.”
The Case of Trying it on the Dog
“I would have you near, at arm’s length, within sight, not tucked away up here,” he said and waved a hand.
And I remain,

“In the study.”
An Apocalypse is bourbon, Kahlua, peppermint schnapps, and vodka. Sounds really terrible.
“It’s not a dress.”
“I’ve got you, John. Fortunately, heat pheromones endow me with preternatural strength.”
“How did you know what I was about that night?” I asked when I found breath.
The cottage was quiet, at always, save for the mornings when old Mrs. Whitaker appeared to keep what little house there was. And today was not her day.
“Yes.”
For without change of costume or tincture of hair or face, the man I knew as Sherlock Holmes became another person entirely. And this person I knew, too. I recognised him readily enough though I’d only seen him briefly and but once in my life.
“Sexy shoes stay on. Want those pointy heels tattooing my back later. How’s this?” He spread Sherlock’s cheeks and gave his rim a cursory lick.
Lestrade shrugged. “Your opinion of me may…”
“Yeah.”
“Fuck, John. This is how a plan backfires. It’s me getting hard. Can you tell?”
“The imminent separation is responsible for the timing but…” Holmes ran a hand absentmindedly through his hair, then he threw his cigarette into the fire. He contemplated his pipe for a few moments, then shook his head. “…I’ve been planning it for quite some time.”
“True. Especially in the poor light of that alley.”
Grodman smiled as their glasses clinked. “That business of the Constant murder sent my memoir well into its next printing. I am gratified that you deigned to read it and pleased that you found it interesting.”
What? Two?
“Me? Or Lancelot?”
The tip of the knife pierced the skin of Jim’s abdomen. Seb counted one, two, three seconds, and a crimson rivulet began flowing southward.
“Precisely. Knees?”
I shrugged. “Shall I test your vision?”
Sherlock looked down and smiled at the mess. Then he looked up at the pitcher garnished with a bright yellow wedge.
“They did this to purposefully lead Hawkriver to make his fatal mistake!”
Sherlock has found his sexual appetite, now awakened, is omnivorous. He can suck John’s prick. Or take it in his arse. He can lick John’s balls or his rim. He can kiss John’s lips or lick his scar.
Seb ran a hand down the front of his tuxedo jacket and said under his breath, “Not everyone can carry off the theft of a Paris museum in broad daylight.”
“What?!”
“Then w-w-why, pray tell, after a successful first attempt, was my second one a failure? If s-s-swimming is like riding a b-b-bicycle, once you learn, you never f-f-forget.”
“No, I would not like the last s’more.”
Should he?
“WHAT?! You’re tracking my cycle? Of course, you are. And you know this? Of course, you do. Why don’t I know it? I’m a doctor!”
Or lust.
Sherlock knew it was a dream, not because she was a horse in a stable, but because John was wearing a dress and a hat, the latter of which resembled a green parrot meeting its demise upon her head. The tall glass in John’s gloved hand was sweating, heavy with ice, and dotted with leaves that matched the molting plumage at her crown.
“It never arrived.”
My decision, hard as iron, pierced my flesh and bound me, bloody, bruised, and bowed, to a mad plank, set me on this mad path.

“And to think, we got all this just for singing songs in a bar!” Greg sipped and sighed again. “I could get used to this.”
“Ouch.” John leaned over and pressed her lips to Sherlock’s temple. “Suit yourself. Invitation’s open.”
Lomax shook his head and winced. “I’d already been beaten, but I would’ve been arrested, too, if he hadn’t hidden me.”
Oh, just a home invasion of the fraternal variety.
Mycroft chuckled. Sherlock snarled.
“Yes. I wanted to crawl inside you. Touch, or rather rest inside, the core of you.”
“Yes.”
“Overbright’s in the boot. We got drop him somewhere.”
In the distance, cerulean sky met azure sea with a streak of cobalt.

John turns, dipping his head just enough to nuzzle their noses together.
John’s hand, still firmly wrapped around his own, is tugging again, and Sherlock allows himself to be pulled forward against John’s chest.
A still-warm wrist with no pulse. Hands pulling him back. The buzzing sound of shock settling in his head.
It is oddly quiet, especially for these two, she thinks, pulling out her keys as she peeks through the small window to check on her only charges.
John pulls back abruptly, looking both worried and bit shaken, yet in full doctor mode, as he reaches to carefully check the no doubt darkening bruise at my temple. His touch is light, and though his hand lingers for a moment, he is standing abruptly, breaking all points of contact without a word and hurrying out of the room… and I am alone, chastising myself for thinking the last several minutes were anything more than a momentary lapse of reason. A mistake. Certainly we have crossed some invisible line that

Their lips brush, finding one another as though it were the thousandth time, until John pulls back ever so slightly, his voice a hoarse whisper.
Rosie scrunches up her face in disdain and tries to push the little spoon away.
Greg’s keys clatter against the cell door as he unlocks it with one hand. He tosses a blanket at Sherlock’s head, and sets a tray down on the bench.
“Doing what, Sherlock?” he questions, hesitantly, hands still fisted but nails no longer digging into his palms.
23/04/12, 23:14
John’s hair is dense but incredibly soft between my fingers - a bit shaggier than normal - can’t recall the last time he’s had it trimmed. Hope that he doesn't do so anytime soon.
John’s voice is quiet but ferocious, hand tightening its grip as his other moves from Sherlock’s cheek to neck, tangling into his hair...pulling…
Mycroft eyes him, knowing he may very well end the evening with a broken nose.
I couldn’t let you... If you had... If I hadn’t made it back... If Mycroft hadn’t stopped you - I don’t think I could have…”
He knows Sherlock is reading him, all of him, in these short minutes connected like this. Wonders if he feels the tingle where they are touching just slightly. Wonders what he sees in his eyes. Wonders if he also has the strange urge to lean just a little closer...to reach out...to touch…
Sherlock turns to him, face deadly serious, and puts a finger to his lips.
Letting go of John's hand, he trails one up to card through short hair. The other coming up to rest on John's chest, as John's other hand comes up to gently stroke his cheek.
“It was worth the pain,” John mumbles, his face pressed against the warmth, the scent, of a very much
John can see he is struggling, and takes a step forward at the same time Sherlock blurts out quickly, “I love you, John Watson, from the basement, to the roof. From here in London, through a tour of European Hell, and back again - through it all...I am...I have been...irrevocably in love...with you.”
“Ok, question number one….”
“Hey...Happy Christmas, Sherlock.”
John hands it over with a little huff.

“So...I take it I am being ignored until that dies then?”

“I saw. John. At least, I think I did. On your face - for a second. Before the lights cut out. Which is why...why I am taking a chance I never dared to before.”

The weighty silence hangs there for a moment, before John speaks, his expression softening.
Sherlock’s head moves to rest against John’s shoulder, his breath warm against John’s neck.

“Before assuming that I am completely heartless, allow me to speak.
“Together, Sherlock...always together.”
“What?”
Odd too, John thinks, that he neither seems to want to move away, or speak. There is still the pressure and warmth of Sherlock’s knees touching his. Causing him to think about things he normally doesn’t allow to the front of his mind. Things that other people already assume they are...things, if he is honest, he sometimes wishes weren’t just rumors.
The biting London air doesn’t force John into a cab. Instead he walks, head down and collar turned up against the freezing winter wind, letting his legs guide him. He doesn’t notice the brick and mortar, the glass and steel, the white stone of the silent buildings he passes. He doesn’t see the sparkle of the city against the midnight sky. He doesn’t pay any mind to the rogue pigeons hopping out of his path as he stalks down the pavement, feet falling fast and heavy, as though he were losing his own private marathon through the empty streets.
John giggles, trying and failing, again, to get the piece of metal into the keyhole.

Johnlets out an audible gasp, taking a faltering step backwards, as his friend’s head and shoulders slump forward, with an utterly defeated sigh.

And John’s hand is pulling him in again, pressing his forehead against Sherlock’s.
“John-I...that last question? I understand if you don't wish to answer. However, I...” John can hear him swallow anxiously before continuing,
“Right,” said Seb with a grin. “You are never just in the neighbourhood, boss. What’s the job? There’s no place to bury a body on a rugger field.”
God, he was so hard.
“You might fool me with a penny tart, but not with Mother Not-Very-Superior Sherlock Holmes!”
And it was at that moment that I realised my hand was still in his. I smiled and squeezed his fingers and flung a silent prayer into the night sky that his words might one day come to fruition.

“The window for indulging in this is narrow,” said John when they had been reduced to a pair of sticky, sweaty tangled bodies on the sitting room rug.
“When?” John whined.
“Yes, you were. Wet already.”
Holmes put a hand on my wrist. “Just listen.”
“Yes, yes, I want to be—”
Watson gripped the arms of the chair.
Mycroft hurriedly moved pieces on a three-dimensional board. “I win!” he declared.
To see Jim in his bespoke suit, his armour, one would never suspect just how flexible a criminal mastermind could be, but Molly had his legs hooked over her shoulders and his body practically folded in half while she teased his hole with the dark blue prickhead.
Jim smiled. “Fuck his mouth, my Queen. Fuck it hard. For what you did tonight, he owes you his life.”

Seb smiled as she approached, genuine surprise on her face.
Lestrade’s laugh turned into a snort.

The room was dark and locked. Sherlock sat upright in a dressing gown which was untied, open, and hanging comfortably on his shoulders. His forearms and hands rested on the arms of the chair. His eyes were closed.
“Only ‘be your most idiotic’ day at the Yard!” cried Sherlock, then his expression softened. “I missed you.”
Fist and fingers pumped in a synchronised rhythm, in and out of Sherlock.
I stifled a laugh. “Are you certain your blood isn’t singed?”
Jim gave a minute nod.
“Hello, my dear,” said Mrs. Hudson. “Don’t be alarmed. The gentlemen have invited us to celebrate the conclusion of the case with them.” She held out a chair by the table. “Have a seat.”

His grey eyes flitted like startled birds. “I have a few ideas, but I’d rather you tell me.”

“Yeah, but just to get showered and changed. I’m meeting the lads for a pint.”
“I want to stay. Alas, I don’t.”

The Sherlock and John on the screen were grinning.
“Sherlock was more specific. He said it was from swimming with the dolphins.”

Sherlock had been finishing an experiment early one morning. He’d heard John in the bathroom and, for once, rather than ignore his body’s reaction and his almost involuntary daydreaming, he’d scribbled a confession in the notebook at hand, between observations of the liver cells.

He cried out as I sheathed the entire length of prick inside him with one merciless thrust. Upon bottoming out, I paused, slipping my hands beneath his shirttails and massage his lower back, allowing his body a moment, but just one, to adjust to the intrusion.
“On the house.”
I considered recent events in this startling new light: the time when Holmes’s experiment—gone awry—had singed my eyebrows, and he’d apologised; the time when Holmes’s case—gone awry—had sent me tumbling into the Thames, and he’d apologised; the time when I’d been in bed with an ague following my dip in the Thames and Holmes had shouted from downstairs, “For God’s sake, man, stop malingering! The game’s afoot!”
“It’s a long story.”
“On some occasions…” began Watson.
“Sounds like a lot of work.”
“Kate?”
Jim shrugged. “You look lovely, my dear. Care to join us?”
He began to stroke his hard prick.
The stranger turned and, with some effort, wrenched the windows open. “Love potion.”
Seb sighed. “All right. Where?”
“What’s your favourite season, Sherlock?”
“What’ve you been doing? Counting shadows on the wall? Playing solitaire?”
“Ridiculously delicious, you mean.” Lestrade rose slowly, then whispered in Mycroft’s ear. “How long can you stay?”
“Are you trying to get me drunk, Detective Inspector, and make wicked advances upon my virtue?”
“No, my own’s quite serviceable in that respect. But you already know that, don’t you?”
Molly looked up at the head peeking out from the balcony overhead.
Well, it didn’t take long.
“That’ll do, yeah?” asked John. The slack-jawed attendant strode toward the target and fingered the large hole in the centre.
God, Mycroft looked good. Lestrade shot him a look that was worth a thousand words, most of them obscene.
“Fuck!” exclaimed Lestrade as he spread Sherlock’s lips once more—and came.
“Your work?”
“No judgment, but needle marks don’t really interest me.”
Lestrade grinned. “I’ll take care of that.”
“Yes.”
“Needling.”
“Detect—”
Just then, a window opened, and an elderly voice cried out, "Stop that infernal racket, young man!"
“No, I didn’t. As far as I can tell, no one is being harmed in the process, and I have not been hired to remedy the deficiencies of the Custom and Excise Officials. I have informed Esme.”
“Oof!” said Seb, putting his hand to his chest. “Yes, ma’am!”
“If I’d known, I’d…”
The job was straightforward. Seb could handle it by himself.
“I got trapped in the lift.”
“Excuse me, Holmes. I want to show Mrs. Hudson.”
Moriarty tried resist, but in violation of his plans, his sense of self-preservation, and all his villainous common sense, he fell asleep.
John eased from the bed and padded silently down the hall. Soon he was humming to the rumbling of the machine and inhaling its fragrance.
John giggled. “Oh, no! A poor defenceless Omega! At the whim of every predatory Alpha in the metropolis!”
Not yet.
Ah, here we are.
Their eyes locked.
“Good boy, you want a treat? Oh, you
“And if you can remember the circumstances, which I am not entirely certain you can, you will probably bear witness to my next point.”
I raised the animal to eye level. It licked my nose. “You’re in the puppy business, Raffles?”
Linen. Whale bone.
They both groaned.
“No, but I’m used to military ones.”
“Got it, Boss.”
“Back,” confessed Mycroft, gesturing to his own.
Good.

Then John sighed, “Who needs the moon?”
A smoking chimney jutted from at the rear corner of the cottage roof. The only window, which had been slightly open, was abruptly shuttered as they approached.
Summary: Watson is convalescing on the sofa in the sitting room.
“What do you suppose this was?” I asked, gesturing to an odd corner in what must have been the sitting room.
“Does it, now? Interesting. You, uh, never sweat?”
Lestrade closed the door, spun round, and leaned against it.
Molly and Jim have a normal date (for them). Molliarty. Public sex.
“I think we can arrive at a mutually beneficial exchange,” added Mycroft. “Let’s negotiate terms.”
John continued to tease Sherlock’s hole as Sherlock braced himself on trembling limbs, begging for more with cries, arched back, and thrusts that impaled himself on John’s probing tongue.
“Dear me!”
He leaned back, held up each leg and caressing it from ankle to thigh. He kicked his legs up and down.
“How’d you find me?”
“Yes. No. I don’t know. It seems that world needs a good deal of scolding of the non-recreational variety.”
Mycroft drank.
Mycroft’s brow crinkles.
As daylight filters through the window and lights Sherlock’s nude body, John is left humbled. And wanting.
He was going to fetch a gift for me.
The ball, though, had been a wonder.
I stared at the clerk, then somewhat inspired, huffed impatiently and replied, “Naturally.”
Watson’s last weekend visit to Sussex had been months ago. A warm letter of invitation for a return visit had been answered with a friendly, but vague reply. Another even warmer missive had resulted in a decidedly cooler response. And a third, and Holmes realised now, final, message had prompted this curt note in hand.
Mycroft nodded. “Thank you. Let’s see.”
Sherlock beckoned, and John went to him and looked through the eyepiece.
I sighed.
Sherlock huffed. “I’m still cut off.”
“Is it a pleasant thought?”
“Oh, I like this. Give me some.”
He’d shifted to straddle Mycroft but not taken his hand from Mycroft’s cock. “Yours,” he whispered as he cupped it, “is wonderfully hard.”
Sherlock turned around and wiggled his bottom.
John crawled away on all fours. Then he jumped to his feet.
John crossed his arms over his chest.
Jim slid one hand up, under Molly’s jumper, and the other down, beneath her trousers and knickers. With one hand, he deftly unhooked her bra and rubbed her back while his other hand kneaded her arse.
“Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest. Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum,” he sang softly.
“No guests at all, except Doctor Watson who returned an ID and an umbrella that Sherlock had stolen.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and huffed. “I do not have time for games, Mister Moriarty.”
Mycroft cracked the car window. Drops splashed in.
“You know I prefer pictures, Holmes.”
“I would not have fought back. I would have considered it a fair sentence for having used, aggrieved, and abandoned you.”
I disturbed neither.
Ambiguous ending, dialogue only
It was like magic.
but to have a lie-in and take the mid-day train.
“Gregory!”
Lestrade took John’s hands in his and pressed them to the door and leaned in for a long kiss.
Blonde roast is a kind of Starbucks coffee.
John stumbled but caught himself. His lungs were on fire, and every muscle burned. Adrenaline still pushed his blood hard through the vessels of his body, and he was ready for the next attack.
“Indeed, I wouldn’t. Shall I forgive you for ensconcing my bedraggled form before a roaring fire, pardon you for filling my belly with first-rate duck, and fussing about me with blankets and toddies in much the fashion of a mother hen?”
Damn!
Lestrade snorted. “There’s always tomorrow, too. I’ve the day off.”
In the morning, Lestrade was gone and Lomax was on the sofa, looking very well.
It was Christmas, or so the knob said.
“…’I’m yours.’ I crawl onto the bed…”
“Thank you, Mister Sparrow. May you rest in peace,” said the stranger. He got to his feet and settled the bill. As he turned to leave, he reached a long arm out to slap the far shoulder of the man sitting on the other side of Sparrow MacCoy. That man, too, began to take his leave and settle accounts.
“I get
And then hell erupted!
He winked at her and turned and left.
“Molly?”
Sherlock snorted. “I hate whiskey.”
“You drank the cold dregs on the lift down,” observed Mycroft when Lestrade pulled away.
“Oh, fuck me,” groaned John as his throbbing cock slid into Sherlock. He began to pump at once.
I do, Gregory.
“Good.”
“It’s just transport!”
“You’re awful rude for someone with a knife to his throat!” Seb pressed the blade deeper, and the bubble burst, painting the steel with a scarlet smear. Then he said coolly, “If you’re feeling unsatisfied, you can always safeword.”
“For two solo bassoons,” quipped Lestrade, snickering as he turned and stumbled toward the loo.
And she was having a good time!
“Your reward.”
With blood. With wax. With surprise.
“Yes!”
“Donovan, your shift is complete. When I return in five minutes, I do not want to find any sign of you or your associate. Enjoy what’s left of your Halloween.”
Mycroft nodded.
The rose petals tapered into a trail, which I dutifully followed.
Sherlock smirked.  “No, not even close, but I’m flattered.”
The only thing which kept me on her trail was her loping gait. I have seen far too many people stumble away from serious accidents, not to have genuine reason to worry that her next step would be followed by collapse.
At first, Sherlock complied. Pushing the lube into John’s hand, then cupping John’s sacs, fondling them, squeezing them.
“It’s a bit mad, but the kids love it,” said Stamford.
“Good?”
John twisted and watched his flow splash across Sherlock’s face, hair, and chest.

After a long while, Kate pulled away.
Sherlock caught their reflection in the glass as they left Simpson’s.
Sherlock’s teeth make a delicious crunch as they slice through the candy apple, and he resembles nothing so much as the treat that he is enjoying.
“I can already feel you…”
Lestrade stared at it. One eyebrow rose. He nodded.
Mycroft caressed Lestrade’s face, then he raked his eyes up and down Lestrade’s nude body.
“Devotion shouldn’t be its own reward,” he growled into John’s ear as he pumped.
“I’m surprised.”
He held up a spoon and a bottle. “One Night Cough Syrup.”
“You were so good at it, Sherlock. You fucked me so well.”
Moriarty slid to his knees on the floor as Mycroft reached again for the pocket of the robe.
Lomax took up his original position behind the counter while Lestrade tucked himself as tightly as possible against the stone.
Title: Second Chances
Sherlock grinned, then looked up through sparkly eyelashes and said, “Oh, no, my glitter sweat’s dripping on your costume.”
He reached for the drawer of the bedside table and found the bottle of lube and tossed it on the bed.
Holmes led me along a slippery path to a curtain of turquoise-coloured water. Then he raised a hand and, as with a curtain, drew the water aside.
“But why, Holmes? Not for medical purposes. He’s got plenty of corpses at his disposal without having to dig up freshly-interred ones.”
“Tempting but no.”
“Good. We’ll need it.”
Seb smiles. He reaches for the pistol on the table and lifts it. “I didn’t want to sleep. You never know when your peaceful sett is going to be breached by some unholy vermin.”
“My feet?”
“What, you need an assistant? Or back-up?”
“That mouth,” Mycroft cupped Sherlock’s chin, squeezing the lower half of his face hard, “was meant for filthy things.” He kissed Sherlock’s puckered lips.
He applies a small amount of blacking to the brush, then rubs it on the boot. Then he switches to the polishing brush.
Mycroft welcomed the mundane task. It would keep his mind off what he did not want to be thinking of, namely, one Detective Inspector who he’d been forced by circumstance to look at quite often in the past three hours, a ridiculously handsome Detective Inspector with a travesty of a tie and a crooked Windsor knot that Mycroft could not, at any point in the meeting, reach across and straighten.

What in heavens—?
“Yes,” said Holmes dryly.
Lestrade dropped a hand between them, cupping Mycroft’s erection. “Yeah?” he teased.
“No, no, I’m quite all right here. It’s just…” Grodman frowned at the squares of dainty blue cornflowers and sweet yellow daisies, then shrugged.
With every movement of the creature, with every brush of foreign skin to human, with every sensation, cool, warm, wet, dry, Greg felt himself descend, step by step by step, into a separate world.
“Yes, Lestrade, I’m fine.”

And with that, Seb flipped Jim onto his back and brought him off with two tugs.
“Oh, Holmes.”
Mycroft exhaled a very long “OH!”
Sherlock approached the desk.
“As close as the laws of nature allow?”
“How could he not?” said Sherlock, thrusting deeper into John.
“It’s complete chaos!”
Mycroft’s eyelids fluttered open.
He had been chosen.
Sherlock passed through a side door into the dark alley.

“Client?”
I’d lived as the ghost of Sherlock Holmes for three long years, and in those three years, I’d not been able to push Watson from my thoughts. How I longed during that time to take my ephemeral form in earnest and return to London. Surely, ghost must be able to fly. Or project themselves through the ether.

“What happened?!”
Sally released the tarpaulin. “Fun’s over,” she said with a pout. “What do you say to a drink to celebrate the best Halloween prank ever?”
Molly stared at him.
“You know the secret code words to get a Jack Skellington Frappuccino?!”
Molly smiled.
“Damn it!”
“Well, I won’t have to hear your squawking for one. And neither will the pumpkins, bless them.”
“…it’s tiger. I mean, you look good. All eyes must’ve been on you.”
“One of your foreign newspapers. It is true, Holmes. I can count, let’s see, four times so far this year.”
“Your scent is off,” said John. “Not bad, just off. Different. Maybe it’s nothing, but…”
“Scrub and,” the hand disappeared and reappeared in a cream-coloured mitt, “loofah. For exfoliation. I could, uh, give you a demonstration.”
John looked over her shoulder at the silhouette in the doorway. “Drink?”

“But why? I love it, Sherlock! It’s so freeing!
“It seems strange,” I said, softly so as to be out of earshot of the playing children, “to be so congenially welcomed by a woman I made a widow.”

The door opened.
“Yes.”
John threw off the bedclothes and padded to the door in his pants. He cracked the door and peered out, and what he saw surprised him so much that he opened the door wide without thinking about his state of undress.
“Claimant to the most iron will is,” grumbled Holmes, “apparent, Watson.”
“What’s that?”
“Seventeen. Like taking Captain Watson?”
Kate made a show of pawing Molly. She unhooked the belt and pulled the sides of the gown apart.
I met his gaze and smiled. “Imagination, mostly. A sliver or two of reality.”
“Well, that’s all right then. The thing with the peas, tonight?”
“You needn’t defend yourself here, my good man. Your chivalrous ways are well-documented.”
Some minutes later, Lestrade was opening his jeans and slipping them down.
With a rather elegant twist, Seb flipped onto his back and looked from Molly to Jim.
“Aren’t you supposed to be subspace?” asked Sally.

The shade to the window was drawn. Irene was lying on the window seat, legs curled up. One side of the bathrobe was hanging down, revealing a length of bare skin.
“I think I’ll have to.”
Lestrade closed the file folder, glanced at the time, and sighed.
I smiled. “You know very well that I only agreed, Holmes, because the contest was for a good cause, raising funds for a home for invalided soldiers, and one of judges was, at the last moment, unable to attend. The contest organisers simply wanted a physician on the panel.”
Sherlock swallowed, then said, “Your hypothesis is correct, John.”
“All right. I know you’ve heard everything that’s crossing my mind a thousand times.”
I have already brought you to tears. I tasted those, too.
John looked up and blinked. “For eating a unicorn fairy cake?” he asked in a breathy, unusually high-pitched voice.

“I was thinking two things: one, that it is a joy to fuck you in this way, every way, of course, but I had this way in mind; and two, that this is my division, not burglary, but buggery!”
“I want to rut all over you, My.”
“One practice shot?”
“What mortals these fools be!” I hailed as I crossed the threshold.
“Well, with all due respect, Mister Holmes, there is a difference between the professional crime-solver and the amateur,” said Grodman, reaching to take a sip of his drink.
“I mean, you are a bit conspicuous.”
Jim snorted and pulled away. “Green, indeed. You want me jealous?”
“Not bad,” said Mycroft. “Reminds me of Mummy, perhaps I should collect the recipe for her.”
My notes were on fire!
“Incarceration. Mrs. Hudson does not approve of the inevitable stains on the carpet.”
Sherlock hummed and fiddled with the glass. “I had them refashioned into something more suitable. So, we can sit here and be bitter and muddled or we can go home and sit by the fire and watch things sparkle. What say you?”

Sherlock & John hunting a suspect at a club. Dirty talk. Sherlock in lingerie.
Lestrade spun ‘round.
Harry made a noise of protest, but Clara pulled on the lead, more gently than Harry had, and John sat up.
“I’m sorry.” His voice is high pitched and broken. “I’m so sorry.”
John reaches out, touches his jaw.  It's featherlight and Sherlock breathes again, a rush of air, a little shaky, and he closes his eyes for a moment, feeling John's fingers caress his cheek.  It's like electricity; more intense than when John touched him repeatedly during the shaving procedure.  Because this time, John's touch was openly invited, anticipated.
"That's not unusual."
“If you didn’t love her enough, why are you still wearing your wedding ring?”
They’ve put on white fluffy terry bathrobes and slippers. John feels ridiculous, but Sherlock has grace as always and knows how to move like a fashion model. His hair is curlier and wilder than usual, and a stray curl falls down into his face as he whips his head around looking for John along the low ottoman benches lining the walls.
John’s heart is warm.
“Yeah.”
"Not that it went smoothly.  Last night I had better luck; there were no officers around, and Miss Cushing hadn't come home either. I didn't want to go inside the shed, so I piled up all the jars behind it and stomped down some stems to make a pyre around them.  Once I had managed to set fire to the shed, it felt so good to see it burn, like a big bonfire.  It felt good to know that the place where Brian sat dead for hours wouldn't be anymore.  I stood there crying, watching the flames take hold of the whole shrubbery.  I was planning to call it in, so the fire could be contained, but someone else was faster.  The sound of sirens sent me into a panic.  What would the kids' parents say if I was arrested for arson?  So I fled back in the house, cowardly.  The firefighters knocked on my door to inform me of the fire, and reassured me they had it under control.  In the morning, I went to work like nothing ever happened."  She pats the wrap protecting her braids.  "And you're completely right, I did scorch part of my hair."
"What for?"
He releases the towel from under Sherlock’s bum. Folds it and prompts Sherlock to let it back in under his tailbone. He pulls at his hips and Sherlock moves sluggishly but manages to balance better. John continues caressing his thighs, working down to his calves. Then he grips his ankles, pushing up against the edge of the seat. Sherlock’s head lolls to the other side, watching him as John puts Sherlock’s heels on the edge, legs folded, crotch exposed. John strokes his sticky cheek, slips in a thumb between plush lips and Sherlock sucks it, swirls his tongue, never breaking eye contact. John’s blood rushes. He switches his thumb for his index finger, then adds his middle finger, lightly pressing down into that talented tongue. He can feel Sherlock’s mouth watering.
John feels stupid.
As had John, if he was to be uncomfortably honest about it. He would have run headlong into any danger if Sherlock asked him to. It was just that this time, it concerned Mary’s past, and Rosie had to be taken care of. Otherwise, it would more than likely have been John who ended up dead on the London Aquarium floor.
“You don’t- do you have a- uhm Clara?” he stutters.
Rosie is warm and tired, her weight increasing as her eyes droop. There’s no use to start up a bedtime story, she’ll fall asleep in minutes. He sits down in the comfy armchair, where he’s been sitting so often, watching her. He’s fallen asleep in that chair more times than he can remember. But contrary to his usual routine, he doesn’t put her to bed, instead he lets her slumber in his arms.
John opens it under the fluorescent light by the kitchen table.
"It's not enough, though.  We'll go straight up to the pharmacy on Saint James' Street and get some crepe bandage so I can secure your thumb and you don't damage it more than you already have.  I'll just pop in, won't be a moment.  Our picnic will have to wait."
Miss Cushing is happily recounting her decision to write to Sherlock Holmes.
He can’t speak with his therapist about this. He just can’t.
' as her password said-- she wasn't '
"No.  Is this relevant?"
“Oh, the Doctor approves,” Sherlock raises a brow, a mischievous smile on his face. “I might get addicted.”
Sherlock sees his words land, the devastation in John’s eyes.
Ah, there it is.  Just when his wishes seemed to be within reach, John decides to reach the crux of the matter.  Sherlock turns his attention to the bees once again, still gathering their nectar in peace, unaware of all that just transpired in their favourite spot.  This is what Sherlock's been dreading, but expecting. The friends-with-benefits arrangement.
Catherine, practical as ever, had brought out her hand drill and a drill bit barely as thick as a pencil lead to rectify the issue.
"Dinner?" John dares to ask, fully expecting a scathing dismissal.
“Maybe I did.”
”Uh, yeah. I head-butted him. Gave him a bloody nose.”
“John.”
"Excuse the sogginess of these.  I forgot about them before.  It seems the ocean has a certain way of lulling you into oblivion."
"I trust your judgement, John.  So, not dementia.  I believe there might be a professional behind this; long time psychological warfare, no claims made for blackmail, a noticeable lack of fingerprints and the like, the threat increasing over time, making use of a personal item to demonstrate they have access to her home, and then topping it off with the beheaded funeral flowers.  Those are significant.  And now, a murder in her garden shed.  What's next?"
John points to Sherlock’s face. “I mean it
“You never seemed scared. You always had a clever comeback. As I remember it, you provoked him frequently.”
“Remember when we played with your… fairies?” He clears his throat.
The baby monitor has come back into use again, since John’s moved most of his things upstairs, preferring to spend the night with Sherlock, rather than sharing a room with Rosie.
He doesn't want to fight her. He didn't even mean to, but the force of habit is strong. It takes a lot of effort to break away from it and resolve to be reasonable instead.
He cringes internally. That word might never sit right with him. "I had a hard time accepting my sexuality,” he goes on before she says anything, before he loses his nerve.
Unstoppable, even with John's mouth on it, half a moment later.
"Her house?"
“How do you feel about that?”
“Diabetes?”
Majida plays for them
"Was it Donovan who searched his flat?" John asks.
John turns to Lestrade, hovering behind him.  "Any confirmed cause of death?"
He swallows, letting his fingertips stroke the rough denim on his thigh. Ella waits for him to get his voice back.
“Um, what does that tell you?”
The distancing again, inserted to tone down his blatant enthusiasm, in all it’s delightful glory.
He gets his socks off, but has a difficult time trying to pull up his trouser legs.  John crouches down to help him, feeling slightly unbalanced, realising he's been a bit liberal with the champagne.  It happens to provide a perfect excuse to rest his forehead against Sherlock's thigh, while folding up his trouser legs.  He realises Sherlock will be semi-dependent on him to get through daily functions.  There's an intimacy inherent in the role of caregiver, of seeing people at their most vulnerable.  John would be lying to himself if he didn't admit that his ethics are becoming a little flexible when it comes to Sherlock, given the situation.
"Sorry-” John mumbles, stands up, causing Sherlock instant panic. “I need to-”
He glances at Rosie’s sleeping form when he goes through Mary’s clothes. Do motherless daughters want their dead mothers’ dresses when they grow up? Christ, she’ll not even remember her. In a few months she’ll have been motherless for half her life. And it will only increase with time.
“Goodbye, John,” Harry calls from her chair.
He threads his fingers through his hair, pulling a bit at the strands to ground himself before he explodes.
“That silly wanker. He’s always been bad with timing.”
"Well, I don't really feel like it when you're just sitting there brooding and not letting me know anything about what's going on in your head."
"What are you doing?" asks John, feeling the whiskey burn nicely, warming him up from the inside.
Now that the ring is disposed of, Sherlock can finally think about sex.
"The gardening tools?" John asks, and Sherlock agrees with a nod.  "Well, now I can understand why he kept them inside.  I would probably have disinfected them too, to prevent any involuntary spread of the damned weed elsewhere."
“What are your symptoms?”
“Root the little fuckers out. I’m having a smoke.”
Back in the changing room, they contemplate the remaining content of their baskets.
“Look at the lighthouse! It’s obvious - the politician trained the cormorant!”
When they've sorted through everything, the table is filled with neat rows of piles dating from March last year until a few weeks ago, and John's filled his notebook with matching columns with subsections of shop names.
Miss Badu glares at him.  "I just think he also saw it in a bigger context.  The neighbourhood is being bought up, bit by bit, by people with much bigger pockets than us.  Eventually, there will be nowhere left to live for people with small incomes.  Letting the knotweed loose could at least slow down that development.  But it's a flawed argument, I know.  Eventually, we both learned more about the detrimental effect the knotweed has on the local biodiversity.  That it's an invasive plant with no natural enemies here, outside its country of origin.  Brian had deep regrets.  It was my stupid idea to casually say 'Well we could always eat it, now that it's growing here.'  Apparently it's an Asian delicacy."
"Indeed!"  Sherlock smiles, and John is relieved to witness his returning enthusiasm.
He needs to text The Woman.

He leans back against the chair and looks to the ceiling with tears welling up, letting them spill out of the corners of his eyes. He’s not the victim here. He snorts at his self-pity. Takes a deep breath through his nose and looks out the window.

“Ridiculous concept.”
The rest of the day isn’t any better. He’s restless and jumpy, avoids his colleagues during lunch break.
To counteract such risks, he undertakes the task of securing quality items in all things regarding Rosie. He doesn’t quite trust John’s judgement after he’d seen the hideous wallhanging by Rosie’s cot.
Sherlock moves swiftly and takes him into his arms, soothing him and pressing kisses to John’s temple. But John is overcome with sadness, and weariness over all the things that he’s done.
Sherlock tries not to cringe.  "And what did you find?"
John checks his watch and the sun's position.  "I don't think we'll manage to get there before sunset."

"Um, the same kind of jars, possibly these, filled with homemade pickles.  Miss Cushing used a key to open the cupboard."
John’s resolve abandons him, and the proper words he’s prepared for today’s solemn topic of conversation are lost.
"No?"  Sherlock angles his head away from John and gives him a devious smirk.  "Well then correct me, Doctor."

"Still, I want to know if there's something wrong with the asparagus.  Since the pickles were clearly homemade, we need to rule out the possibility that something went wrong in the process."
“Yes, just like that, John,” says Sherlock, his voice deep and calming.
Soon they get to familiar areas.
"Come on, I deserve it!" John bites. He positions himself, steady legs spread a bit, arms behind his back, defiant stance, chin jutting out.
He’s said that many times, mostly when people have leered and probed at his relationship with Sherlock in recent years, and never once been lying.
They've been more quiet with each other, lately.  That damned verdict really shook them, though Sherlock played it cool, made it out to have been predictable and unsurprising.  Sherlock's sudden silence has been more intense and drawn out than ever before.  John's been feeling left out, rejected.
John doesn’t answer, only swallows hard, tears filling his eyes. Sherlock’s not sure if it’s from the stinging of the slaps, or if it’s emotion showing there. Sherlock is angry and sad, weary of the unspoken hurt between them.
I did not lie to you when I said that ‘a doctor knows.’ A doctor, at least one who has been at the business of doctoring for as many years as I have, does often know when death is drawing near for a patient that he has tended for a long time. And I have been tending this body for the longest of all.

They both fall silent for a moment, avoiding the other’s eyes.
“It is quite likely that this is also where you will break mine.” He stops, eyes meeting John’s and holding his gaze. “This is the hardest thing I have ever done, but it had to be here, where it began...and where it ended. Where I started falling, and where I fell.”
“Always something,” Sherlock answers with a timid smile of his own.

They share a smile, which turns into a laugh.
But then, John exhales shakily and barely whispers, “How could you possibly think I would leave you? After all we’ve been through...after...losing you once before...after all this time. How is it you still can’t see that…”
He falters a bit at this, but stands his ground and resolutely does not look away.
The flat is dead silent but for their breathing for a few more long moments, before the answer comes, so quietly he wonders for a moment if it was actually said.
Sherlock casually pops a mint in his mouth before replying.
On that one hurriedly whispered word, Sherlock’s eyes flick back to his, and the floodgates open into a stream of near manic speech.

And he can’t speak. And he can't look away. Even as he feels the embarrassing heat and prick of tears behind his eyes. He knows it is beyond obvious now, there is no disguising it, no mask he can put up to block it. John isn't an idiot. If he ever thought he saw it before, he damn well can see it now.  He could just say it. He was going to say it. He can’t say it. Any other time and he would have bolted. Escaped. But there is no where to go. He is cornered and terrified and…
There is an indignant squawk of protest from behind them, and then...then there is a hard, urgent collision of lips against his. Far from soft or gentle. It is intense and desperate and needy.

He reaches into his coat and pulls out a very cracked and scuffed mobile, turns it on, takes a cautious step toward John, and holds it out.
“Th-Thank you, John. Y-You’ve two more,” Sherlock stutters out.
Then there is the light press of fingers, lifting his chin. Forcing him to look into damp, cobalt eyes. So close. When did he get so close?

My own hands flutter indecisively at my sides before choosing a safe location to land: one on his arm and one mimicking the one in my own hair.

John sighs, placing it back into the bowl.
John slips, nearly collapses onto Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms wrapping around the gaunt frame before him, as though he were holding a life preserver in a stormy sea, only relinquishing their hold at a delayed wince from the injured detective.
He looks up to the sky, to the constellations, small faraway things that were ordinary and deletable to the man whom he now knows he cannot live without.

“No point in that...not like there’s anyone to impress. Spending Christmas Eve in the nick...probably NOT one for the blog!” he chuckles, snatching some crisps from the tray.
In the cold it feels like days, perhaps a week, before he is there - a man having journeyed through the desert of his own mind - blinking up at an all-too-familiar sitting room window. A window where fairy lights had hung at Christmas. A window from which music had floated in spring. A window which was now dark, save the very faintest light reaching out to him, from somewhere deep within.
He hadn’t expected John to go along with this, and he is feeling a bit exposed from the questions he himself had to answer with more detail than he would have liked. However, learning the smaller details of John’s life, the ones he hadn’t been able to deduce on his own, was worth it. He was sure when John had halted the questions, he would never have agreed to this bit, but in true John fashion, he surprised him.
“Will you tell me?” John yawns into Sherlock’s collar as his eyes slide closed.

And John moves, closes the gap between them - like he is closing the distance that had settled between them from the night Sherlock came back - like he is closing a distance that never belonged there. Stopping only when their shoes touch.
“I do not expect anything from you, John. Just...do not leave?” he pleads quietly to the ground.
“Well, first off, your brilliant mind.”

“This is...different. No deducing, or guessing, involved.”
“Right, so no more peas, got it...and no, you don’t need to try that again with the sweet potatoes!”

He takes a steadying breath.
“That’s not an answer.”
Sherlock huffs, but lifts his head.

“Brillant” John exclaims, then adds “but still a git”
“Sherlock?”
Can’t think of anything sarcastic or witty to say at the moment, so I do as I’m told… not that many, myself included, can just ignore John’s ‘Captain Watson’ voice - throbbing headache or not.
“Sherlock. I love you.”
A shudder of panic and vertigo runs through him and he backs up one step, away from the edge, to catch his breath.

Sherlock sits, then, hesitantly, eyes never leaving John’s, he lies on his side, backing gingerly against the cushions. John slides in against him, chest to chest, face to neck, before he can overthink his decision, and runs one hand carefully up Sherlock’s ribs.
Sherlock’s voice cuts the silence with a sigh.

John can see the immediate war of emotions rush over Sherlock’s face at the command - fear, insecurity, sadness, and something else he can’t put a name to - as those sharp features begin to soften. Doing nothing to attempt to hide or even fight back the echoing tears glistening behind sea-glass eyes.
The grip on my hand tightens, pulling me more firmly against John’s front. His hold says he is afraid I might move.
He shakes his head and that last thought away. Hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.

At that, John’s head jerks back up to stare at him.
Let my eyes fall closed; let the heavy weight of him seep into me…
Sherlock taps in the time on his phone, then scoots a fraction closer to John, knees bumping together, and pushes start.
“How was that sentence really gonna end, Sherlock?”

“36 questions about what?”
[Sent] John. Please. Do not ever blame yourself. You didn't cause this. You did nothing wrong. Quite the opposite; you were, as usual, the only light in a dark place, and had I truly died that day, or should it still occur, having you there and hearing your voice at the end would have been enough. I promise, John, I swear, I will explain the why (and the how) to you. I cannot, at the moment. My time right now is limited, but John, do not blame yourself. This was forced on me and, in turn, forced on you. I would have stopped it, had it been an option, but I was only given one. I only wish that your heart had not needed to be collateral damage.
Sherlock gives him an exaggerated expression of hurt, and John responds with a smile and a fondly uttered “ Git!”
“What could we possibly play in a locked cell?”
John takes the phone, turning it over in his hands. He had held it so many times. Fished it out of pockets, carried it across the flat; he would know it anywhere.
“John...There is something...I need to…”
The space between them closing - one stretching up, the other leaning down, tentatively seeking out the new territory of the other’s mouth. A hesitant brushing of lips. John’s hand sliding up Sherlock’s nape to twist into soft curls. Eyes locking for an instant. Sherlock’s other arm slipping around broad shoulders, his hand splaying over John’s back. A set of mirrored, nervous smiles. Acknowledging, that yes, they can do this now, before John pulls him forward again. Full lips pressing solidly into thinner ones. Sherlock’s tiny gasp against John’s mouth. Moving together, tilting and angling, mouths parting, tongues sliding against one another, meeting for the first time. A soft sigh, and a broken whimper, as they part for air.
“Who?” Sherlock asks.
John realizes they are much closer than before, both leaning in slightly. Sherlock’s words are soft and warm against his face, another inch or so and they would be nose to nose...or…
“You honestly think I would let you go off alone, again?”

It isn't nearly wide enough and they end up pressed nose to nose, lips brushing in soft kisses as they settle in - the weight and warmth just enough to be comfortable.
At those words, a fire lights behind John’s eyes, his expression cycling through frustration, pain, and anger.
The tremor in the hand he has been so loosely linked to is palpable as John is pulled forward gently by one finger, until they are nearly chest to chest - but he keeps his eyes locked on Sherlock’s. Allows it. Unsure exactly what to expect, but hoping... hoping…
John feels his own eyes widen at the thought, and sees Sherlock’s startle slightly at the same time...about a second before a shout from the hall of “lights out,” and the cell lights click off all the way, throwing them into darkness, save the soft glow of a mobile screen.
“I should think...maybe...something like this?” Before he can overthink the moment, he leans in to press his mouth firmly onto John’s.
[Sent] Am I a sharp-tongued arsehole?
“I would have to say...your smile. The real one. Not the ‘for a case’ pretend sincerity, but the real one you get when we’ve had a laugh, or Mrs. Hudson makes your favourite biscuits...you’ve a really nice smile when it’s for real. God, one more...yeah, I would definitely have to say your eyes...they are an interesting shape….and honestly, I don’t even know what color to call them...they are...sometimes they are bright and bluish green, and other times, they are such a light, blue-gray, almost like ice. You really have nice eyes.”
Sherlock's eyes flick away, and find a place on the carpet to focus on instead.
“Ok, then, 4 minutes and we are done?”
John advances again. This time Mycroft retreats several paces.
[Sent] I know you were there, at my grave.
He can’t though; whatever it is John thinks he should see, he can’t. He panics at that thought, wants nothing more than to bolt - but there is no way to run. John stands between him and the stairwell, the edge of Bart’s and enough regret for a lifetime at his back.
The low timbre of Sherlock's voice, just above a whisper, brings his attention back around.

Your sincerity. Every ‘brilliant, amazing, fantastic’ and you go a bit overboard about it, yet you mean every word. Your jumpers...”
He watches as John's self-consciousness keeps him from maintaining eye contact for a few moments, watches him studying his face, before he raises them again and holds his gaze.
“Please Sherlock, look at me? Whatever this is...just...don’t? Ok? Don’t...just...talk to me?”
“It’s more of a an experiment, of sorts - well, a replication of one, anyway.”
“John,” Sherlock begins, then seems to notice the silent tears streaming down John's face - he reaches out in the darkness, hesitates, then brushes a calloused thumb beneath his left eye. Sherlock’s fingertips linger just a moment on the side of his face and as he pulls away, John places a firm hand over his, pulling it back. The tears continue to fall as John’s eyes close.

It's been almost two years since Sherlock jumped, and the pain hasn't dulled. The nightmares are just as vivid. The grief just as paralyzing. Images of flailing arms and that long coat fluttering. The sickening thud of a body hitting pavement. The smell of rain and iron. The blood. So much blood. Blood had never fazed him much; why would it? For a man who had seen people bleed out in his own hands, blood shouldn’t bother him. Nor death, really. He was a soldier and a doctor. He had seen his share of both. Until the day that blood surrounded dark curls and blank verdigris eyes. Until the death of the best friend he had ever known had sucked all the colour from John's world, and the will to live from his soul.

Sherlock snorts.
"Maybe not.  Still, it seems to be working."
"It is?"  John's eyes gleam.  "I'll tell you what's endearing--your response when I touch you, or kiss you, or simply breathe into your ear."  He's clearly waiting for Sherlock to respond.  "This morning was quite enlightening."
"I stand up most of my workday," Miss Badu says evenly.
John takes his hand, heart swelling.
Sherlock doesn’t answer. The blood flowing out of him is hot, but he’s getting increasingly colder under John’s hands.
'.  And I can't work out what that is.  Believe me, I've been trying."  It's frustrating and tiresome, and Sherlock is sick of it.
Sherlock smirks.  "Imagine taking off your gloves, Inspector."  Lestrade stares at the body and his face turns pale.  "I assume I don't need to go into the details, hmm?"
“I want
Sherlock grabs the bathrobe from it's hook, throws it on, steps barefoot into his shoes and stomps back to the bathroom to fetch his pack of cigarettes.  He pointedly puts a fag in his mouth, before he steps out into the gloomy garden, with the lighter in hand brandished like a weapon.
"The floor was concrete, admittedly with some significant cracks, but none wide enough to hide anything substantial.  Only some weeds growing in."  He quirks an eyebrow at John.  "Maybe we should have dug it out?  Hacked away at the floor to find this '
. Do you understand?”
“Why did you take the stitches out yourself? Why didn’t you let me do it for you?
“It’s quite fancy here nowadays. I could sell it with good profit. But I don’t know. It’s calmer than London. Maybe I’m done with flat-sharing for now.”

Sherlock and Baker Street gave a sense of security and stability. It resembled the time during the wedding preparations, but with a little extra excitement in the form of cases. John had almost succeeded in subduing all the conflicting emotions surrounding his marriage. They’d been a team, him and Mary; the ‘Managing a Newborn’ team.
“She gave it to me.”
It ends catastrophically, with Sherlock lying bleeding on the floor, and it’s John who has put him there.
John doesn’t have the energy for this anymore. He’s feeling close to tears.
"She's lived a long life."  Sherlock smirks.  "She's had plenty of time to make enemies."
He's been compartmentalising for most of his life; using drugs to heighten his thought processes, using sex mainly as a means to subdue them, through sensory focus and heavy hormonal impact.
"Irene Adler."
"John, why don't you tell the Inspector what you saw in the cupboard beneath the stairs."
will be waiting for him.
Sherlock comes stalking towards John. Rosie is preoccupied with some small things she’s found on the ground. It seems she’s beyond the stage of putting anything she finds in her mouth. Sherlock hasn’t hindered her as often as John would have liked, but maybe it has paid off, since she seems to have learnt quickly what tastes good or bad.
"She," Sherlock corrects.
"Donkey rhubarb," Sherlock says slowly.  "Of course.
When Sherlock only quirks his mouth in response, John shakes his head, then picks up his tumbler and knocks back the last of his drink.  "Let the woman do her work in peace!" he admonishes, throwing himself back against the pillows and pulling the duvet up to his chin.
"It's nothing, John."  He goes back to running his fingers through the stones, finding a shell.  His thumb caresses the broken and mellowed form, repeating the gesture several times.  John finds it incredibly sensual.

makes him feel like a horrible man.
"Huh. Right."  John makes the razor gently follow the curve of his upper lip and Sherlock needs to suppress a shudder.  "Anyway, as I told Mycroft--"
“Yeah, exactly. You let me. That doesn’t make anything better, Sherlock,
Below:
He could casually touch women. He could affectionately touch women. His hands would roam the usual paths.
"Sherlock.  Let her finish her coffee."
“John, it’s not just climate change. It’s food deprivation! Do you have any idea of the key role of bees in pollination for food production?”
“When I’ve been on and off with Clara, yes. And some after. But at this point in life I’m quite content with living on my own.”
“Do I deserve to feel
“Nothing. Just, you’ve got a lovely face.”
She rushes ahead again.
Sherlock huffs, scratching the stubble with his left hand.
“Have you told Sherlock that you don’t blame him for your wife’s death?”
"I mean, you must have..."
When the music stops, he empties his water bottle in the drinking fountain, turning away from the door. The people mill out, pass by him, warm and red-faced. Some queue up behind him as he fills the bottle. He drinks slowly, walking towards the open doors, and steps inside.
"There was no time to go through anything properly," Sherlock complains.  "I just snapped pictures as fast as I could."
Sherlock frowns.
John follows her to the car, carrying her bag.  When Sherlock hears the engine start, he can't help but walk right over the coffee table and flop down on the couch for just a moment, stretching.
Sherlock's phone buzzes again, and this time, he's ready to actually throw it away.  He fishes it out of his pocket and glances at it.  Two missed calls and one text.  All from Lestrade.  "John.  It seems we have an arsonist to deal with."
“Maybe you should take it slow then, start with something neutral. Or a least not that gay-coded.”
They stop at a remote address on the outskirts of town. Sherlock checks their location on his phone. They search the perimeter. John’s not sure exactly what they’re looking for. ‘Signs of disturbance’, Sherlock had said. John finds suspicious tyre marks on the gravelled backside of the building, but Sherlock dismisses them.
"Sherlock.  Please."  John hates that his voice trembles.  "It's the one thing I ask for.
The frost is near, so Rosie helps picking the remaining tomatoes, bring them inside and put them on the windowsill to slowly ripen during sunny hours.

"Stop."
He busies himself with polishing a large tomato with the end of his shirtsleeve.
“What idea?”
They hug. He holds her tight, caressing the back of her head. Looks to the darkening sky. Closes his stinging eyes and breathes in the cold air, deeply.
There’s something off with the tear, where Sherlock pulled the first stitch out. There’s no scab. It hasn’t started healing. It’s a small tear, but there seems to be fluid oozing out. No, it’s blood. It’s dark red, almost black, deep down in the tear, but it rises to the surface and starts dripping.
If there’s a shittyness-scale, he and Sherlock are close to even these days.
"Of course!  I will examine the contents of this box, and do the soil sample analysis, but this needs to be analysed too.  It
Sherlock complies.  "Could be dangerous,"  he murmurs as John places a dollop of gel in his palm and starts to lather it up.
Next year, there will be bees on their roof, helping save the planet and keeping Sherlock distracted from boredom between cases. John can already taste the honey.
who destroyed you. Who beat you until you were unable to fight back.”
The room opens up towards the garden with a sliding glass door, now covered by a sheer white curtain, with heavier slate grey curtains on the side.  Sherlock sits down in the solitary swivelling lounge chair placed in front of them.  John can't help but notice how the teal velvet fabric of the chair compliments his dark blue shirt, as well as the man himself, of course.  Sherlock relieves himself of his fine wool trousers, and then brings them to the bathroom to rinse out the saltwater.
There's naturally very few people around on a weekday in late September.  John can count up to a handful, as far as he can see, squinting against the sun.  Some are soaking up the sun in plain picnic chairs.  Not more than a couple dare to have a swim, for even though the overall temperature is pleasantly warm, the sea is frigid.  It must have been crowded here earlier in the season.  The beach is mostly deserted, but on Brighton Pier, more people are starting to appear, as it's near lunchtime.
Rosie’s starting to get a real mop of hair.
Harry falls dramatically onto her back, gripping her hair. “
The End
Sherlock is starting to consider this a futile quest.  "I'm beginning to question her statement about not suffering from dementia."  He starts to pace, hands on his hips as he keeps looking over the sorted receipts. "What if she's just confused and made this all up because she forgot she was supposed to send them to her accountant?"
Sherlock gets a grip on himself, and since his aim is fairly good, he manages to hit the mark, though not straight in the bull's eye, like John.
