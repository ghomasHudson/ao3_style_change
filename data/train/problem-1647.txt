Perfume, a bathtub, and a little something else.
I smile. "Hello."
but it really, really,
I straighten and flip the lamp off, the only light in the room being the silvery pathway coming from the crack of the door. "Okay. Call if you need anything."
Sherlock is unusually quiet the rest of the day.
Firm hands grip the sides of my face and pull me back so that insistent lips can latch onto mine. I know Sherlock is trying to distract from his rather ungraceful moment, but no complaint comes from me as he determinedly forces my mouth open with his tongue.
It isn't just the shoe scuffle, though. It's the jumpers and the
So, the next time he shoves against that spot, you do scream.
He taps his brolly before continuing. "It seems my dear brother obtained several…
"Sherlock, you're going to scare someone with that thing."
"Since the Fall, you mean," Sherlock says, with such easy detachment that I want to throttle him.
My tossing and turning has moved me to the far side of the bed, so he climbs on his hands and knees across it until he's hovering above me. His lips are soft but cold when they meet mine, and a touch to his hand reveals that they aren't the only part of his body that's cold. He's freezing.
"No more games, Sherlock." I meet his gaze, and it's as if he's let down a wall as his face falls into a quiet, sorrowful expression.
The grin on my face won't go away. "Sherlock, are you getting sentimental over a dead person's head?"
It was late, the case was over, John was tired. Sherlock should be exhausted. Of course, he wasn't. John mentally groaned. Sherlock drifting off the high of a case was never pleasant. Usually (if John was lucky), Sherlock would walk into the flat, straight to the nearest available surface (sometimes his own bed, sometimes the sofa, sometimes the floor, and once, the damned coffee table) and fall face-first into a deep sleep. This wasn't one of those blessed times. This was one of the rare
"You two doing okay, then?" Lestrade asks suddenly, pulling my thoughts away from comparing Sherlock to crustaceans.
You study him.
Sometimes, when he's standing, watching you work, your mind freezes him in that position. The glint of admiration in his eyes, the gleam of sunlight against his soft hair.
Sherlock pulls off my shirt with his good hand, grunting in frustration when the cuffs catch against my wrists.
I shrug.
The earthquake increases until my eyes blink open and I'm looking straight up at the ceiling of a car. I tilt my gaze, head still fuzzy from whatever we'd been drugged with.
You shake your head. "No, I didn't want to come
There's a startling moment for Sherlock when John suddenly grips both his wrists and slams them above his head. Faces inches apart, John struggles to gain his control back as Sherlock tries to anticipate what happens next.
I flinch when his door slams shut.
The drug had made my limbs heavy, but I still join the search of a way to get out. Sherlock, too, looks as though his arms and legs are weaker than usual. He kicks at a window, but there's not enough force behind it.
"You're going to have to do this," I whisper harshly, throat constricted with arousal.
"I think if you were to locate his daughter, she might be able to shed some light into your cavernous brains," Sherlock says, straightening and shoving his hands into the pockets of his long Belstaff coat.
but he'd gone and gotten three of his ribs broken. He sounds awful, his breathing wheezing slightly, but he had refused to go to the hospital. He insisted I knew how to do it well enough and I could take care of it myself.
When he returns late that night, John is in his chair with a tumbler of whiskey held loosely in his fingertips, the bottle sitting on the floor beside him.
"Sherlock!" I yell, and he finally turns his head toward me.
He had surprisingly soft, warm lips, though.
The detective actually quirks a small smile. "That's considerably better than your first comment."
Comments appreciated. :) -C
The hand in his hair pulled quickly, dislodging their lips and tilting Sherlock's head back, exposing his long throat. The detective whimpered at the loss of contact and absolutely shuddered when John's lips caressed the base of his neck. The doctor made his way up with open-mouthed kisses that left heat searing through Sherlock's body, through his mind. He gasped and writhed and it wasn't enough and John had barely begun.
File away painful images and anything relating or pertaining to the word "lonely."
Alright, since last week's update was so late, I decided to upload this early. PLEASE if any of you guys have ideas for how I should continue this, DON'T BE AFRAID TO LET ME KNOW. I desperately need ideas.
I have a rhythm now and Sherlock's hips are bucking up from below mine to meet in a wonderfully overwhelming brush of skin against skin. I wet my palm and reach down to grasp him, but his hips snap back and away.
So, yes, there are good ways and bad ways of waking up in the morning, results of which show throughout the day. Rolling out on the wrong side of the bed, out of tea, broken down car, lost house key.
He is perfect for you, but you are far from perfect for him.
He dragged him away, left the evidence with one of his agents and then, with John's arm still clutched in his hand, led him to the service car. An old dark blue sedan.
John Watson still hadn't said a word.
He felt as if a beehive full of buzzing bees had replaced his brain.
It was at least an hour before Dr Lewis showed up with his white gown perfectly pressed and clean, his stethoscope polished and resting on his neck, and his operating room shoes on. Grizzled hair combed without a hair out of place.
But Sherlock did not move.
The car park was located next to the underground exit, which had fortunately prevented it from being closed by the police.
We have to insist on physiotherapy and, of course, antibiotics."
"So what have we got?" he asked curiously. The victim's body lay between a concrete column on an empty car spot and a SUV in the next spot. Now that he had approached Greg, he could see it. What was definitely supposed to be a grown man was lying on the ground,  in a supine position. It was a real mess.
"Forget it." He cut off the conversation and closed in on himself, hoping the Scotland Yard detective would get the message. Thankfully, he didn't pursue the topic and the ride was silent again.
John didn't like him insisting like that at all when it was clear that it bothered Sherlock.
"What's that?"
Sherlock slips his hands up the expanse of John's chest, realizing he hasn't been granted with nearly as much skin to explore as John has. "You're wearing too many clothes," he complains.
Sliding lower in the bed, I grip the band of his pyjama bottoms, glancing up briefly to make sure this is okay. He's staring back at me this time, eyes wide and seeking in the dark.
So now, I sit on the edge of the coffee table across from Sherlock as I wrap his ribcage. Sherlock is mumbling gibberish about how long it takes ribs to heal and isn't it
"Don't be silly."
I blink. "
After we're rinsed and I've shut the water off, I wrap a sleepy and shivering Sherlock in a towel and lead him back to his room.
are what drove me away.
"Sherlock?"
I'm uploading this chapter early because I'm going to be gone for the rest of the week. I may or may not post another on Saturday (though I probably will).
"Cold?"
"They're so touchingly loyal."
and it takes you a minute before you can pull out the word
Sherlock sits across from him and plucks his violin.
"I'm a specialist, you see…"
He pushed forward.
"I don't like getting my hands dirty."
Brow furrowed, Sherlock nods briefly.
He finds his pants on the floor and cleans you both as well as he can before drawing you close again.
Sherlock has somehow contorted his body so he has one foot firmly on the floor with the other leg slung precariously around the shorter man's hip. He's shivering and shuddering and it's all John can do not to purposefully slam Sherlock onto the slippery shower floor and take this to a completely different level.
A clock somewhere on the streets of London chimes faintly, signaling the late hour and breaking the stillness between them.
Sherlock! You have people who care about you, who don't want to see you dead. Isn't that reason enough?"
Sherlock hasn't moved, so I crawl over the bed to him and clean his belly, slowly pulling the flannel across skin as the muscles beneath quiver slightly. As I back away to finish the tea, he grips my wrist lightly and pulls me in, initiating a quiet, calm kiss. I tug gently on his bottom lip with both of mine as I pull away, kissing his palm before going back to the kitchen.
And now, let the reading commence!
—and wonderfully naked.
Sherlock picks up his wine glass for the first time that night and drinks a good portion before pulling it away from his lips and studying it. "Mortality."
This has to be the poor girl's murderer. He smells like Mrs. Hudson, too, although I don't know what that means. Sherlock must have figured it out before rushing out of the flat earlier.
"Don't you think I knew that?" Sherlock snaps, piercing eyes boring into John's for the first time since he'd arrived back home.
"Honey, I'm h—"
"I'm fine."
He has to. How can he not after you made such a tactical error?
John caught his eyes starting to roll back in his head and forced them instead on the huge blueish eyes staring up at him.
I choke out, pulling his face to mine so I can kiss him, breathe him in, absorb as much of him as I possibly can. I don't know how long I have with him, or how long he'll be able to put up with the monotony that I am, but I'll be damned if I don't make the most of it now.
I'm already down the stairs before I realize what I've even heard, ignoring the aches from my assault two days prior. I think it was a scream, though it could have been a name. Or anything, really.
Sherlock has an arm wrapped around my chest, and with my free hand I grip his forearm tightly. "Sherlock," I breathe, panting in deep pulls of air. "Sherlock." There's not really a reason to say his name, but it grounds me, helps me realize the severity of the situation and all that could have been lost. I say it simply because I still can.
His eyebrows lift slightly. "And who said I am in the dark?"
"I think if it comes down to your life and catching a criminal—"
Sherlock smiles back. "Please."
I apparently pause too long, because he turns back to his work with a huff.
and any strange attraction to Sherlock is simply a fluke. Perhaps it's a natural reaction to being around Sherlock Holmes. I'm fairly certain even Donovan has a thing for him, despite the fact she calls him names every time she sees him. And Irene Adler, who
Sherlock nodded jerkily.
Sherlock's door is closed, and a distant part of me is surprised that the man actually decided to sleep. Before I can second-guess if this is the right thing to do, I open the door and step inside.
For one terrifying moment, John thought he was going to be sick. A kaleidoscope of feelings slammed into his chest, making it difficult to breathe. This man. This gorgeous, arrogant, brilliant man was sitting in his lap, looking at him with a gaze so heartbreakingly pure that he was forced to face how blatantly
I wait for him to pull me back out, like before, but he doesn't, doesn't, doesn't and I start to wonder how long I can hold on until I pass out and ultimately don't wake up.
"Nothing's wrong, John." He uses his dismissive tone and I know I won't get anywhere with him for a while.
There were little moments, extended looks that hadn't been exactly the same before. There had alwaysbeen the eye contact after a case, or a fit of giggles in the hallway, but this was different. It felt unique.

It's comfortable.
"I can't go shopping tonight, Sherlock. It's late."
You catch your hand before it can reach across the entire expanse of the seat and slap it down onto the space between you and John.
Sherlock turns so he can lie down on his side, facing away from me. "You just needed to know that."
As for myself, I'm afraid my nerve endings are about to combust. The feeling of being inside him with
I'm rather astonished when he comes to me that night.
"Sherlock," I whisper, unsure as to what needs doing.
The detective has absolutely no idea what to do with any of these emotions flickering across his flatmate's face. In all honesty, they actually scare him for a minute.
those eyes—piercing me with curious precision. "Why wouldn't it be?"
"I wasn't complaining."
"It's okay, love. You're alright. I didn't hurt you, did I?" At this, you quickly shake your head. "Good, good. It's alright. Everything's wonderful. It's brilliant.
I decided to update early since school starts next week, and Chapter 1 was really just an introductory chapter. Once school starts, I'm still planning on updating every Saturday night.
Suddenly, the fact that they have all the time in the world doesn't seem to matter to the doctor as he desperately attacks the buttons on Sherlock's trousers. The detective manages to get John's belt unbuckled in the same amount of time it takes the smaller man to leave Sherlock's trousers unzipped and ready to be removed.
naked.
"John."
"You're insane."
I set down my fork and lean across the table. "Is something wrong? You've been acting odd for weeks. Odder than usual," I have to add.
Nobody was John except John.

This was what he wanted, what he'd
He throws his head back. "Trust me,
John is there, wrapped around you, closer to you than ever before, and it isn't enough. You feel like maybe it's ripping you apart slowly from the inside out, because no matter how much of John you get, you'll always want more.
I wake up the next morning with a twinge in my neck and a consulting detective's curly head resting against my knee. The coals in the fireplace are still glowing and emitting a bit of heat.
A few minutes later, we're both propped up on pillows, sipping tea as the sunlight crawls further into the room. It climbs over our feet and up the bed until the room is flooded in all its golden beauty.
After Sherlock unceremoniously announced that he was going to die, all of the morbid statements and odd thoughts about death stopped. It was as if he had come to terms with it, and after stating it, locked it away. That was that.
The day passes slowly and quietly for us inhabitants of 221B. I make Sherlock eat, and have him take a few deep breaths every hour to prevent a collapsed lung or pneumonia. Sherlock sleeps more than he has in months, barely waking long enough for me to do what is required and give him painkillers.
"It stopped again. Oh, god. John, you stopped it again." He lets out a breath on a dry sob and cradles my head in his arms as he wraps them around me.
"Nice work," I say with raised brows.
"I didn't mess anything up, did I?" I ask, taking a sip of the fruity concoction in front of me.
He opens and closes his mouth like a fish out of water for a moment before any sound comes out.
Damn that umbrella.
"Sherlock, run!"
But then I stop. Because Sherlock is now towering over me, a look so full of pain and malice I can hardly recognize him. When he speaks, his voice is lower than I've ever heard it, and chilling to the bone. "Don't ever mention
I have to pause a moment. He didn't demand,
I open my eyes as hands, warmed by the cup of tea, rest lightly on both of my thighs, just above the knees. Blinking lazily at him, I'm remotely aware that this position puts our faces at level heights. I part my legs a bit more. Not to entice, but to allow his slim frame closer to me as I straighten and lean forward a bit.
He wasn't going to hurt Sherlock, and if he lost control, he feared he wouldn't be able to stop.
"Oh, let me guess."
We're in the back of a Land Rover, parked in a large garage as far as I can tell. Sherlock has already clambered up front and is messing with the doors frantically.
You manage to solve the case within a couple of days.
Taking another bite of the sugar-restoring candy bar in his grip, he tugs the other man’s hands into his lap and slips off the gloves. The gentle friction of medicinal hands against scientific instantly warms the detective.
Something stabs through you, painful and
By the time we're ready to go and are in a cab, my stomach is growling loudly.
I give his cock a few strokes and he bites back a cry. Leaving the most blatant part of him, I reach behind and run my fingers lightly
This is one of those shadowed evenings.
What that word jolts through my system is absolutely ridiculous and I tamp it down before climbing in behind the gangly detective.
"You're insane."
"John, wake up!"
There's no way to tell how long we've been here. Precious minutes are ticking away as carbon monoxide slowly fills the inside of the garage, and something from my days at uni flickers through my mind.
The post-case adrenaline is starting to wane as you sit next to John in the dark interior of a cab. You are sunken in your seat, knees bent and braced against the back of the seat in front of you, arms crossed, collar turned up. It's a bit too cold in the cab for you, but instead of complaining, you study John from the corner of your eye.
"Oh, god." His voice is wavering and I realize I'm not the only one shaking now as he studies my face. "Oh god, oh god." He lightly touches my forehead and his fingertips come away red. He shudders and squeezes his eyes shut.
Gentle eyes call to you and you follow. Follow across the creaking floorboards and up the creaking staircase and across the threshold of his room. It's dim and warm and feels like your doctor.
They are small details, most of which would probably be unnoticeable to everyone except Mycroft and myself, but they're also a big deal. Sherlock doesn't let his body slow him down. I know his injuries weren't so bad that he'd let himself be handicapped. So what in his mindset has changed to allow small signs of weakness to peek through?
"I annoy you."
I glance up from my bowl of pasta. Sherlock is sitting in his usual seat at Angelo's, looking out the window at nothing in particular. He's vacantly fiddling with the corner of his napkin, lounged in his chair in a way that shouldn't be possible for legs that long. He hasn't stolen the tomatoes on my side salad yet.
Wait, painful?
"John."
So there's that! This fic is now rated M!
"You've gotta admit that's sexier."
Is John angry? Why does he look sad? How can he not know why he does something? How can
I don't want to watch the life drain from him this way.
The position the detective had taken up during the night can't be comfortable. It had heightened the wheezing of his lungs and I know I need to get him into a better position.
"The cause of this is obvious by the pictures in his wallet. Sentiment. It can get the best of us. And by
It's beautiful—
I have no idea what he's on about, but he's spiraling downward quickly. "Sherlock, look at me. Look." I finally manage to push him back enough to look into his face. His eyes are wide, almost feral. "I don't know where you were today, I don't know what you did or what you thought about, but you have to stop this. Just stop this." The last sentence is harshly whispered, words I've said before to a Sherlock I thought was dead.
I remain still and silent as he sets his cup on the floor, rubbing both hands roughly through his hair and groaning angrily.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So danger was what brought them together in the first place. Fine. That doesn't mean it has to be the thing that
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "I'm naked, standing next to you in a shower, with an erection of monumental standards. What does it
I have a flashback to another fight at another time in another location.
"You didn't bring your gun?" he all but yells.
John chuckles and goes to get his keys. This is the mad bastard's way of apologizing. Plans for a walk forgotten, he tucks his gun into the waist of his jeans. Time to play bodyguard.
Molly blushes.
"Shall we eat at Angelo's, then?"
Mumbling about being summoned like a bloody housedog, I make my way to where Sherlock is.
"He looked like you," he whispers before getting up and storming into his room, slamming the door.
"Sherlock," he says. You can feel his voice rumbling in his chest.
It aches. I want to crawl right into that fragile ribcage beneath my hands and never leave. I've never had an addictive personality, but I will never stop craving Sherlock: his brain, his body, his bloody abrasive self.
Dinner, bones, and an apology.
Collecting himself recklessly, he pushed in another finger.
Sherlock was sure he was breaking in half. He opened his mouth to tell John, but all that came out was a choking sob.
"Tell me you've never fancied ventriloquism."
"You know perfectly well why I'm telling you this.
Eyes sliding shut, my lips move slightly of their own accord against his, and the detective lets out a little sound before breaking away. He's breathing so heavily, I'm afraid he'll hyperventilate. His eyes are enormous.
Still looking ahead, his mouth tilts up in that half-smile of his.
to someone before.
I cry. Not often, but I do. I cried when the nightmares of Afghanistan were too much. I cried when Sherlock took the plunge off the roof. I cried at his gravesite and I cried after he returned. Now, I don't usually have reasons to cry, but that doesn't stop me from waking up in the middle of the night with a wet face after re-living the day from hell, when I watched Sherlock's lithe body lean forward, arms spread, and plummet to the hard concrete. I almost always cry with those dreams. Messy, ridiculous tears will stain my face and dampen my pillow. I rarely make a sound, that I'm aware of. (After all, I'm sure if I cried out in my sleep, Sherlock would be sure to alert me to such behavior with a rude
Punching him sounded like a good option. The daft wanker had gotten himself into a shit load of trouble with this case. Not only had he run off without me
His lips press against the imperfect, stained skin of your palm. Because he can do that now. He can do that.
I do it again, slow and gentle, and now Sherlock is writhing beneath me, tossing his head to the side and exposing his long neck. My lips latch onto a wayward freckle and suck, perhaps marking him.
It goes without saying that Sherlock is burning bridges
receipts—and is now rifling through them quickly.
"British Government," I say in response.
He turns his head slightly so his mouth is unobstructed. "I
I study him, concern probably seeping off of me in waves. He's staring at a spot close to my left hand where it sits on the armrest. Apparently I wasn't the only one affected by the gentle morning, but that's not like Sherlock.
The next day had been slightly tense at first, almost as if we were both trying to feel each other out. I had been up for several hours before Sherlock snuck out of his room.
"Obviously." Because it still isn't enough.
I step a bit closer. "Sherlock, are you okay?"
You come entirely too quickly, with a tiny whimper, and you're embarrassed. You bury your face into John's neck so he can't see your burning cheeks and how much of a wreck you are.
He nods slightly, sucking in a deep gulp of air and then letting it out between parted lips. I tell him to do it again, and then once more, and on the third time my finger presses farther until it's all the way in.
"You can't be allowed to continue."
He hums noncommittally.
Sherlock turns briefly and throws his hands up. "He was in the observatory!" With a brief look in my direction, he sweeps out. If I hadn't known better, I would have said it was desperation.
Delicate fingers against a shattered scar.
Honestly, I'm not sure how this turn of events happened. We'd been investigating a very routine missing persons case (Sherlock had complained about the dullness of it), when Sherlock had suddenly stopped in front of me, causing a small collision between us as I ran into his back. I couldn't really get irritated at him for his abrupt halt because the man
John caught the wrist of the invading hand and gave him a warning look. "Sherlock..."
I have a rather dull name. John. So many people have the name John. It's not a special name. It's not very memorable. I would have liked to have a better name if my mother had let me choose.
He seems off. His gaze is lackluster as he stares out the window when the car pulls to a stop in front of the flat. I thank the driver and climb out behind Sherlock, digging in my pocket for keys even as the front door sweeps open.
You come with a soundless wail, back arching as your hips stutter and falter until you're completely, utterly spent. Your skin is vibrating and your vision fades in and out as your body sucks in deep breaths out of desperation.
You look down and close your eyes, hiding your face, hiding yourself.
"Wear something, you know…" His hand waves through the doorway in my general direction. "
Sherlock diagnoses Anderson with syphilis in front of half the Yard.
After a few more minutes, he finally holds one up. "Ha! Now we have something."
John lifts a long, pale limb over his good shoulder. "Do you want me to use a condom?"
There is no hurry.
I got the title for this chapter from the American novel of the same name written by Alice Walker. The title is the only thing they have in common, however. :) I apologize for the brevity of this one.
You wake up to the annoying
And all thought flies out of Sherlock's brain as the doctor gently eases the first finger in, his free hand grazing up and down Sherlock's leg in a soothing gesture.
, it makes me feel cared for by this nutter in a rush of emotion that has me accidentally nipping at his lips.
With a smile, John takes his hand. "Come on, then."
What happened to the John Watson that ran through the streets of London, chasing a cab with a person he barely knew, for the thrill of it?
It starts with the morbid statements.
He nods and we brace ourselves to kick against the windshield.
I hand him the pills and he swallows them dry. "Sherlock, are you okay?"
"I don't need you here," he murmurs into my stomach.
You are ready for the next step, however. You want to feel John closer than you ever have before. His skin sliding against yours in a silken procession, eyes gracing you with their cerulean warmth as he guides you into a state of blissful oblivion. You want to remove the rough fabric of his uniform from his body, letting it pool around your feet as you press him into the soft expanse of sheets. You want to replace the uniform with your own body, pale arms and lanky legs wrapped around tan limbs. Dark curls against graying flaxen strands.
"I suppose we're all human in the end, John.
of John's typing. Your arm is sprawled loosely over his hips and your face is buried into his side as he sits up with the laptop resting on his stomach. You breathe in deeply, taking his scent into your lungs. With any luck, permanently.
"John, why do you always wear so many damn layers?" I shift my attention from Sherlock's bare chest to where his fingers are fighting to gain purchase on the hem of my jumper. "This is ridiculous!"
John thinks his eyes are about to come out of his head as there's suddenly a very firm grip around a certain part of his anatomy. Slamming a hand against the wall of the shower and trying desperately to avoid collapsing on the floor, he grips the wrist above the assaulting hand. "
I just wanted to thank everybody for all your lovely comments. They make my day!
It's a bit odd for me, really.
"Fuck. Fuckfuckfuck," John grunts, fighting for his rapidly slipping control as he thrusts into Sherlock roughly, pulling almost completely out before pushing back in. He reaches a hand to pump Sherlock's cock, but the detective grips his wrist in a vise.
"But that's never happened before," he says quietly, still fighting off panic.
Cold, heavy reality slams into me with the realization of all I'm taking from the trembling man beneath me. And he
ALSO: Please notice the rating change.
You fall asleep facing each other, hands resting side-by-side on the covers between.
Slowly, the hues in the room change from the cool morning pastels to their glowing warmth of daytime. I have a shift to go to today, so it's really about time I get up. But Sherlock is still asleep and I really don't—
"No," Sherlock says emphatically.
"Not funny," he glowers. "Help me up."
Oh. Soldier voice.
Sherlock ignores me. "It hurts, John. Everything hurts."
Now, several years later and a lot more water under the bridge, I find myself in a similar situation, albeit in reverse. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock is quite attention-grabbing for others in the place, and he has to thwart several efforts before I take matters into my own hands, literally, and link our fingers before dragging him to a semi-secluded table in the back of the bar. I push him toward the chair that has a better view of the entire room and claim the other myself.
I hit his prostate again and the reaction is overwhelming. His entire upper body lurches off of the bed and he grabs me, wrapping his arms around my ribcage and keeping us both vertical, forcing my knees further into the mattress.
You know, because there really isn't any other explanation for what is happening to you.
The doctor notices everything about the man beside him, because he has been taught to observe. There is a faint blush at the tips of the detective’s nose and ears, and the collar of that coat is turned up about his neck. Puffs of delicate smoke move away from familiar bow lips, but this is from the cold, not a nicotine habit.
"At least put on some bloody pants," I grumble, falling out of the other side of the bed. Belatedly, I realize I'm in Sherlock's room, so I stumble my way to the stairs and up to my own room, where I throw on a fresh pair of pants and a pair of pyjama bottoms.
Sherlock doesn't reply, just sits there on the couch, shirtless, staring at his lap.

The detective stared for a long moment. "This is me asking. This is me asking for you to take."
and he doesn't want Sherlock throwing that away by getting himself killed by a crazed petty thief in some back alley. Not after all they'd been through.
Sherlock shifts uneasily where he's seated, having absolutely no idea what's happening.
Nothing at all. Fine, if all you cared about was the work and the experiments and the fucking
"Sherlock, run!"
Three heartbeats.
"That was just maddeningly uninteresting."
The stranger looks at Sherlock, who shrugs an agreement. At least I think it was an agreement.
Sherlock's hand flailed wide and John caught it and brought it to his chest. Sherlock began rubbing his hands experimentally all over the rough scars of John's sternum. It distracted him enough for John to finish preparing him and then he was there, ready. He really didn't want to break Sherlock but he was afraid he would. And it was too late.

This attitude that I've adopted bothers me, because life with Sherlock Holmes is anything
Quiet sighs.
It's rough, not at all tender, as if he's trying to meld our mouths together. He doesn't try to take it any further than lips against lips, and for a brief moment of clarity, I wonder if he's ever kissed someone before. It's sloppy, uncoordinated. Everything Sherlock isn't.
Sherlock jolted and cried out, letting out several shuddering sobs. "JohnJohnJohn
John groans again and shifts so he can hit Sherlock's prostate.
He's leaning against the door languidly, watching the passing lights as they flicker across his face. One of his hands is resting on his thigh, absently kneading, the only sign that the cold is getting to him.
And now he's back, and there are so many things we have been ignoring and

"Did I really make such a fleeting impression?"
He makes himself a cuppa and then heads upstairs to get dressed. He'll go for a walk. The morning air will be nice. Smiling smugly at the rumpled bed, he pulls a jumper over his head.
He shifts from foot to foot in my peripheral vision. Recognizing his nervous (You say: Sherlock Holmes,
John pats his back, signally the hug over, but Sherlock ignores the hint. "Well, actually—"
Sherlock drops back onto the bed, breathing erratically, clutching blindly at the sheets until he finds my arm and wraps one hand around my wrist.
Stop.
"Go by yourself. I'm busy." He turns back to his experiment.
Speaking of which, he felt he was probably exhibiting all of those in the face of Doctor John Watson. It was okay. He could allow himself to be vulnerable in front of the doctor if it would convince him of Sherlock's sincerity.
stress-free. However, there are redeeming qualities, and nothing is more cathartic for me than watching Sherlock work. The energy that zaps through the air as he dashes back and forth, insulting Anderson and explaining
"No." While I was talking, he had started in the direction of the door.
I had been overwhelmed with it all, sitting hollowly on the sofa, my head in my hands. He had sat next to me, put a big, warm hand on my back, and everything…clicked. When I say
You study, watch, notice, observe, see,
Sherlock mumbles something I can't understand as he's said it straight into the cushions.
"John." He heaves in a breath. "John, talk to me. I've never…" He drifts off as I press more tiny kisses below his ear. "I don't know what to do."
Yes, John knew perfectly well how the whole thing worked, but all that waiting was torture. He had to know.
"No idea, but we'll have to hurry up and catch whoever did this.”
"Yeah, thanks. See you later."
Greg pulled the notebook out of his jacket’s inner pocket and a pen out of the other pocket, and placed the items on the bed, next to Sherlock's hand, who stared back at him, not moving a muscle.
"He'll recover. It'll take some time, but he's stubborn. He'll be fine." Obviously, he was careful not to mention that name...
Sighed. Hadn't heard or seen Sherlock Holmes for a year.
"What?" he asked with a face that certainly must have looked stupid on the outside.
As John was engaging in self-pity, the cell phone resting on the table began to vibrate wildly, so much so that he spun around.
He took a deep breath and came close to help Dr Lewis.
"I'm telling you if I don't find something soon Mycroft will hang us."
The eldest of the Holmes brothers stared at the doctor, who had dared to contradict him, showing him all his contempt, but did not reply further.
In the meantime he thought, again and again, about everything that had happened.
Dr Watson, can you help me?"
Why didn't he understand that?
"You did this!" John tried to open his mouth to retort something, but Mycroft's murderous stare made him desist and he closed it again.
"Come."
The nurse walked them to the door of the room and opened it.
But Sherlock merely looked at him with his 'healthy' eye.
"You may enter, but the immediate family only."
"I'll send a car to pick you up around four o’clock, okay?" Greg said.
In his hands had heavy dark wool cloth. Opened it. It was a long coat.
"So, Doctor?"
Sherlock looked like he was looking for something or someone. He stared first at Mycroft, then at Greg, but it was as if he didn't recognise them.
"How long will it take for him to use the other eye as well?" asked Lestrade.
John practically jumped inside the vehicle. It was even colder than the day before.
"Don't make fun of me, Greg: we both know he probably pissed someone off."
See you soon I hope.
"Who the fuck checked it???"
Other interminable minutes passed.
"Yes Detective Lestrade explained to me that you were an army doctor and even after that you continued to work as a general practitioner. You know one of my sons works in war posts, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc..."
Mycroft snapped forward and took his hand.
So perhaps he had not completely given up on his old life. Every now and then he still worked for the detective at Scotland Yard.
"You owe everything to my brother, and my family! If you hadn't met him, your life would still be miserable, and you wouldn't even have that beautiful little daughter you care about so much." he saw him advance menacingly, like a big, ferocious lion, that had aimed for the throat of a defenceless fawn.
Turned to Greg.
Then he grabbed it by the collar and turned it outwards, in the center there was a cloth label, a black silk rectangle, embroidered with a red thread writing, that name flashed like a neon sign.
"He's still alive!"
"I beg your pardon. It's not that I don't trust you, but I've been ordered not to let any strangers in."
John threw the damn thing away and took the poor boy, who was only doing his job, by his neon yellow jacket.
"Sir?" asked the agent confusedly, beside him.
"Alright, we'll take it out now.
He glared in the direction of the driver.
"Who checked to make sure he was actually dead!"
Special thanks to my beta and the person who so kindly and patiently translated this chapter for me.
The lift doors opened in a long corridor. On the right side, it had large windows and plastic chairs under them, while on the other side, there were white doors with numbers written aside.
Strange, usually at the third always answered if was available. John let it fail and put it down. Maybe Sherlock had seen his number, so he didn't answer him…
John stayed behind.
They walked to the end of the corridor and stopped in front of sliding doors, the opaque glass was inscribed with the words ‘
Paramedics loaded the man onto a stretcher and John gave them the full story of what had happened and what he had been doing to treat him, explaining that was a military doctor.
"Better?"
"Is that normal?" asked Greg.
“If you're going to fight, do it outside.”
"I was his housemate. Now I'm not. And she has procedures to follow. Besides, Mycroft must have threatened the hospital personnel enough..."
"Ah well, good for him..." he felt so dazed that he couldn't even formulate coherent thoughts. Dr Lewis seemed to notice because he looked at Lestrade who merely shrugged his shoulders.
"I see."
"I'm Lestrade, do you recognise me?" Sherlock nodded.
"Can you tell me who did this to you?"
There was a large patch of almost congealed blood underneath, it must have been there for a while.
"Yeah, but I'm not a stranger: I'm a bloody Scotland Yard detective!"
"Yes, I can. Now, leave!"
A strange feeling slipped down his stomach.
"How is it going here?" the doctor walked over to check on Sherlock, who squeezed John's hand even tighter.
John left the house. Lestrade was already outside, waiting for him in the car.
"What kind of filthy animal are we dealing with?"
"If you can help me with the procedure. Surely if there are two of us, it will be even better, don't you think?" explained Dr Lewis.
"Oh, of course, okay." he nodded, even though he was alone in the house.
Lestrade grimaced.
Sherlock's mouth tightened, the black seams that held the side of his upper lip together almost disappeared.
"I'll take care of it. And anyway we're still collecting all the evidence and clues, I've sent my officers out to investigate around, when I have enough clues I'll put the pieces together and call you."
"Yeah sorry." there he was, feeling like a complete fool and apprehensive too.
Greg didn't add anything else, and the conversation ended there.
"What do you think about what happened yesterday?"
"Are you Dr John Watson?" she asked, and the doctor in question nodded.
He pushed his friend into the passenger seat and climbed into the driver's seat. Lestrade rolled down the window to turn off the flashing light on the roof of the car and left the curb at full speed.
John's eyes lit up with anger and his stomach clenched.
John's heart started pounding so hard in his chest that he could barely hear his own thoughts.
"Hold me!" yelled with all the air from his lungs and without waiting for an answer, slipped half his body over the edge of the dumpster. Retrieved what interested him and dropped backwards and landed on the tarmac.
"No thanks, I'll take the underground. I need to walk."
John swallowed and swallowed large stone.
"Of course I do! He's right in front of you!"
Lestrade's jaw seemed to drop and he fell to the ground in amazement.
Ask before you use the remaining jam for an experiment.
He looks down, our eyes meeting for the first time since our shower, and I can see the stubble beginning to peek through his skin.
and the only annoying thing about it was that I was forced away from home and all that I have acquired."
He glares. "I am not
I want to help. He needs to know that.
"John!" he shouts, shoving the Belstaff off his mop of curls. "I was studying something!"
Choked back inhales.
I wake up the next morning to find him smoking. He has the window cracked, and breathes out into the crisp city air. His dressing gown drapes over his skeletal form as he lounges against the window, and his cheeks hollow out as he takes a deep pull on the clandestine cigarette.
"Your mouth," he whispers, sounding awed as he takes your bottom lip between both of his.
His only response was to glare and toss the thing in a rubbish bin.
"Johann Sebastian would be appalled."
"This is okay?" he asks. He's kneeling between your bent legs now, so you ease a leg over his shoulder and pull him closer.
I look sheepishly to Lestrade. "Sorry. Call us if you need anything."
"A bit."
And then I gently push in, just a little, just enough for Sherlock to choke out a near-sob and move back.
"Easy-peasy."
This time, it's myself that crushes our mouths together. I can feel this entire thing growing more out of control than it should be. We need to slow down, I know. I need to make sure Sherlock is okay and that we don't overwhelm him with what we're about to do. But this entire thing was born out of fear of losing the man beneath me and I
skull, John!"
"John." He scooted closer until his chest brushed John's knees. "Please."
"Could you speak plainly for once?" I say, voice rising in pitch.
Sherlock glares at a passing couple through the window.
"All the time in the world," you hear him whisper as he slowly presses you into the soft mattress beneath you.
My fingers seek out his shirt buttons quickly, making quick work of the first two before straying, as Sherlock's own hand moves to my hip. His grip is fierce and will probably leave bruises and I think to myself:
The next morning as I leave the flat (after waking up to find Sherlock gone), there is a black sedan waiting in front of 221. Sighing, I climb in and watch the passing scenery as the driver takes me to another abandoned factory. Anthea taps away on her phone, not even looking up as I exit the vehicle. Mycroft greets me with a cold, feigned smile, umbrella in hand.
"John?"
He returned the hug and helped the woman to get in the car. The driver closed the door and went to the driver's seat.
"Come on let's go, I'll drive you home, we don't have anything to do here." Lestrade had put a hand on his shoulder.
At that moment the paramedics arrived. The men hadn't even noticed the ambulance sirens.
John administered chest compressions until the poor fellow choked out a gush of blood. Finally, began to take a few rattled breaths, his chest rising and falling.
"So... where were you between late last night and early this morning?"
“The two boys slaughtered in the park by the pack? No they don't seem to be the culprits. Look at the way he's dressed, he's got shoes that cost at least two hundred quid."
And he laid there motionless.
He filled his lungs with air, then released it. He repeated this a couple of times.
"I understand how upset you are, believe me, I've been doing this job for forty years. We are doing everything we can for your brother. But this doesn't help us, a climate of terror and rancour can agitate other patients - “ the poor doctor had no chance to finish his speech because Mycroft had grabbed him by the lapels of his lab coat.
"I think he means in the ambulance." John replied. Sherlock just laid there, staring at him, and John felt incredibly uncomfortable.
Mycroft, on the other side of the bed, stood next to Greg. He was more still than a statue: he didn't even seem to be breathing.
"Yes I am, but there aren't many clues. That damn car park doesn't have half a camera in it. I mean, come on it's the twenty first century, the age of big brother. It's crazy. What about witnesses? No one saw or heard anything, and everyone was apparently asleep at the time. The nearest pub was already closed. So we've got nothing at all." he concluded the long explanation with not too much concealed frustration.
"I can buy this dump that you call a hospital, and have it demolished if I want to. I'll call one of my doctors who certainly isn't incompetent and have my brother transferred to a private clinic where he will get superior care."
Remember the Stubbylee Park case?"
"What do you mean?"
He pulled his mobile out of his pocket and dialled the emergency number, immediately calling for an ambulance.
Actually, John was almost laughing: in another situation, he would have made fun of them, but raging and throwing gasoline on the fire was not good, especially not at a delicate time like that. So he simply ignored them.
"You two! It's your fault!"
John was tempted to go in anyway: he wanted to see for himself but sat down in the plastic chairs along the corridor, along with Greg.
The paramedics left, getting into the ambulance.
It started ringing on the other end. One ring. Two rings. Three rings.
The idea of hearing Sherlock's voice sent a shiver down his spine.
"But who, Sherlock Holmes?" heard from the other side.
"I cannot believe it. So we no longer have a dead man."
"All of this is because of you! You left, after insulting him and blaming him for the death of your criminal wife!" John felt hatred towards Mycroft for those words but the furious man had intimated him so much that he kept quiet.
Much love
"How old do you think he is?" asked Lestrade.
He closed his coat and went inside.
A black sedan with tinted windows stopped in front of him. The driver got out and opened the rear door on the sidewalk. Mycroft got in first and then Molly, who gave him the same cold treatment.
Racing. Opened the front doors and went up. More eyes.
"I haven't heard from him in a year," he felt bloody guilty.
Rescuers looked at him worried.
He moved closer, seeing nothing but that body lying down.
They arrived at the hospital and parked on the lower floors of the car park.
Mycroft put a hand on his shoulder.
He passed under the yellow tape that had been put up to close off the driveway beside the car park. There were other officers checking footprints; and just beyond, behind a cover, was Greg Lestrade.
Greg's eyes lit up. He patted John on the shoulder.
"That's rubbish," Greg replied testily.
John bit the inside of his cheeks. He was indeed the contact person and the contact number to call in case of any eventuality, but he wasn't sure he still was. Surely Sherlock must have changed it.
The air was brisk and the sky grey, but it didn't look like it was going to rain, at least not at the moment.
"Maybe this is a case were I should call him."
"Don't you dare contradict me! You know very well that I can end your miserable careers! Even that of the luminary here! - pointed at poor Dr Lewis who looked shocked.
Dr Lewis took a syringe from the shelf of a metal cart that a nurse brought into the room and he inserted the needle into the cap of a large bottle with clear liquid.
Mrs Hudson, on the other hand, stopped to hug him.
John rolled his eyes.
John bent over the unfortunate victim.
"Yes however the relatives of your patients usually can't buy your place of job and demolish it after they fire you on the spot." Lestrade attempted a laugh, but Dr Lewis didn't look amused.
John handed him the two packages. Greg opened the bigger one and took out his coat.
No, he categorically refused to believe it. Sherlock played this game once before. He wouldn't have fallen for it yet.
Greg approached the front desk.
John wanted to touch him more than anything, to make sure he was really there, but he wouldn’t do that. He wouldn't move an inch from where he was, and he wouldn't stop looking at him.
At that moment, the nurse returned, but this time without the cart.
Very good. No rush."
John felt anger turn in his stomach but he swallowed the bile and leaned his back against the seat.
It took him a while to leave the house, and another half hour to cross the part of the city that separated him from the crime scene.
"Uhm alright, so the last thing you remember is John... At the car park?"
He drank some more glasses, left the money on the bar and went out. The cold air helped him clear his mind, just enough to remind him where he was. He decided to take a taxi. Even though he wasn't drunk, he was moderately tipsy: his vision was starting to blur and his thoughts were now incoherent. He liked that feeling, at least it could stifle the guilt for a while.
The rest of the buttons are undone quickly, and I shove the luxurious cloth off pale, pale shoulders and then there's
Of course I'll take care of him. Of course. How the hell could I not? I probably couldn't stop taking care of him if I tried.
I nod, not getting up just yet. My morning erection is gone; I don't need to worry about that, but I'm reluctant to let the quiet stillness that had settled around us to dissipate.
Sherlock remains in his place until he hears the door to John's bedroom slam shut so violently that it rattles the skull on the mantle.
You feel John smile against your neck.
Sherlock hums a response that could mean anything from
"A bloody bit not good!"
Then. Just...
Also, I apologize if the Moriarty stuff is just really getting over-milked. I promise it's not going to be all Moriarty-centric like this. :) -C
You wait for it to fill you, the release of the crushing pressure against your chest that threatens to tear you apart, but it doesn't come.
His hands are braced on the edge of the counter, and he's leaning forward slightly, head tilted. It hits me how much trust he's putting in my hands. Literally. This is an extremely vulnerable position for him to be in, and if Sherlock is careful about one thing, it's vulnerability.
Temporary versus permanent, transient versus eternal.
With a jerky nod, he holds his arms up and I let myself be pulled closer by the lanky man beneath me. His bones are small and fragile beneath my touch as I place a hand against his hip. And then…
Reach for weapon.
His brow furrows briefly before smoothing again. He knows, too.
Sherlock groans, but lessens the viselike grip his legs had created. John moves so they're no longer pressed together in lower regions and continues his assault on the tall man's lips. Pulling that gorgeous top lip in between his own, John finally manages to get the top three buttons undone on the detective's dark purple shirt and spreads the fabric wide to allow access to more of Sherlock's upper chest. Abandoning that mouth, he quickly becomes fascinated with the creamy smoothness of the violinist's neck, sucking and nipping until Sherlock is reduced to a trembling mess and there are marks etched into perfect porcelain skin.
Sherlock's hips bucked and he cried out. John tried to calm him down long enough to talk to him. He ran his hands over his arms and kept his lower half completely still.
It hurt. It hurt so badly. But then it didn't, and it wasn't enough. He bucked his hips against John.
"For god's sake, John. How do you ever say anything at all?" A cab pulls up in front of us and he opens the door and gives me a once-over before meeting my eye. "
"You could have been injured, too."
A large part of me is inclined to believe it was just the prospect of losing me hitting Sherlock hard in the face with a frying pan that caused him to lip-assault me like that. But honestly, Sherlock Holmes
"It's really not," he says.
For days, you simply study him more than you ever did before. You watch his habits, his movements. You watch what he eats and what he says. You take notice to what he likes and what he doesn't like. You notice when Lestrade says something ridiculous and the lines on John's face strain against laughter. You observe how John watches out for Mrs. Hudson, checking in on her every night. You see how John tries to make Molly feel good about herself after you insult her.
When this doesn't immediately work, he groans in disgust. "John! I want to see if you recognize it."
and switch into Doctor John Watson mode.
"Gottle o' geer."
The doctor stands and straightens his jumper. He hadn't bothered to change clothes when he got home to find Sherlock gone. "Good."
as he normally would. He had phrased it a bit more like a request. Though that request still brooked no argument, it was unusual wording for the man.
John kissed him briefly. "It's okay. It's okay, baby. Let go."
You have the British Government practically at your beck and call (no matter how much said Government may deny this at times). You have a sweet landlady that cooks occasionally and helps tidy the flat when you're busy chasing your flatmate around London. You get free food at a fabulous Italian restaurant. You get to go behind the caution tape at crime scenes. You get virtually unlimited access to the lab and morgue in Bart's.
keeps clothes of that sort lying around in his closet?"
There are many noises filling the flat, overriding the quiet
This is nothing that needs to be taken further today. It's not demanding. I can hear Sherlock's soft noises as he moves his lips against mine, still not much more than a chaste brush of lips. And it doesn't need to be.
(This thought runs through my mind and I realize how much Sherlock has truly rubbed off on me.)
this. Because he does. He suddenly, undeniably,
I jump slightly as Sherlock's sleep-roughened voice drops into the room. Watching as he unwraps his long arms from around his long legs, I say, "Did you sleep much?" There is a cold patch on my leg when he lifts his head.
They stand off to the side, one watching the scene before them, the other watching his companion. It’s not often that the taller one is content to just stand quietly, but he does this time. The shorter one beside him tugs on the cuff of his coat, urging the detective to tilt his head down, eyes leaving the scene before him.
Unbidden, you let out an obscene moan.
He follows me, holding that towel to his face and looking absolutely ridiculous in an endearing, boyish way. He sits at the table and watches me move about the kitchen. The man's skin is probably well enough prepared to go under the blade, no matter how gruesome that sounds, but he doesn't say anything. I don't make him a cup, and only take two sips of mine before setting it back on the counter.
You love it, the way he laces the fingers from his left hand with the fingers of your right, pushing your joined fists into the mattress beside your head. You let out a harsh breath as he brushes his lips against your chest, latching onto a nipple and gently suckling against the skin. You remain there, pliant and unmoving, letting your doctor do as he pleases. He is the one that knows what he's doing, after all.
I bristle at this. "Is he in danger?"
I leave him holding the cup of tea in the middle of the kitchen at five-'til-four in the morning.
and a man only has so many options in the middle of the desert and…I'll just leave it at that.) Then Sherlock had kissed me, and it was different. Completely different. And I'm not talking stubble-burn-in-the-morning or oh-god-it-has-a-penis different. It was emotionally explosive. And that's just a bit too cliché, so please ignore that sentence.
Eyes narrowed, Sherlock begins pacing, dismissing the brief interrogation. "It's the skull that's missing. Isn't it obvious?"
The sound twitched through his body to his nearly painful erection. He knew Sherlock (or himself for that matter) wouldn't last much longer.
"Sherlock! What the hell?"
He's breathing heavily, barely a foot away. I calmly pick up the tea I'd prepared, then take his hand and place his long fingers around the mug handle.
I blink away some of the fog and look out the window. Multiple cars, all engines running, in an enclosed garage.
I kiss his clavicle through his t-shirt. Memories from the morning he woke up after sleeping against me by the fire are running through my mind. I made his brain slow once, and I hope to God I can again.
Soft, quivering breaths.
"Doctor," he says as I approach him.
"Sorry," I mumble, looking back down to where my fingers are working on the last button.
"I'll burn the
You're not slow now. You're needy. Your hands move insistently to slip the t-shirt he has on up and over his head. He helps and throws it far away before returning to relieve you of yours.
Sherlock Holmes is completely, bitterly done with games.
The detective stirs and rolls off of me. I hear the hitch in his breath and the small groan that slips out. Turning so I'm facing the detective, I slowly ease him onto his broken ribs. Sherlock hisses in a breath, but allows me to continue.
Breathing.
His eyes narrow slightly. "I'm fine, John."
I had never expected to feel this again.
"Sherlock," I say, a bit louder this time.
"It's not terminal, and he's getting treatments." He crumples his napkin in his hand, then adds quietly, "That seemed like something you'd want to know."
Chuckling ruefully, I take a pull on the burning liquid. "I'm not even sure I was going to successfully move on." When I look up, Sherlock is staring at me with an unreadable expression. I sigh. "I just… Sherlock, are you okay?"
"Me? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Fine."
"You're a doctor, John," the taller man says flatly.
"I can't. It's..."
He groans. "John, John.
"Very," I say sarcastically, looking towards the mantle, which, in fact, is missing its usual resident.
"You're me!"
I rinse his hair, but before I can move on to cleaning that gorgeous skin, he leans his head forward and buries his face in the crook of my neck. I feel shy lips press tiny kisses to the skin there, and the blinding innocence of this man cripples me. Wrapping my arms firmly around his waist, I simply hold him as he trails sweet, sleepy kisses across my shoulder.
"But you want to know what...it's...like?"
"You started this and you are
If this kept up, very soon there would be no dishes left unharmed in the flat.
He shrugs delicately, swallows his tea. Smug bastard hadn't spilt a drop during our bout of near-hysterics. I, on the other hand, hadn't been so fortunate. "Nothing as of yet. Perhaps Lestrade will call with a case."
I look at him a moment, then, instead of responding, I reach behind him and wet the same flannel he used before with cool water before patting his face with it. Aftershave is next, and the man smells
You're trembling from head to toe but it doesn't stop you from saying "Now you" and allowing him to teach you how to bring him release. He chants your name reverently until a final yell of
