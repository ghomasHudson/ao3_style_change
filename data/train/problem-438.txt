John chuckled, sending Mycroft a mischievous look.
'Why? You know why. Because you orchestrated this whole relationship in the first place. You knew when I was at my weakest and you took advantage of that. You used my grief against me, to get closer to me, to make me rely on you. You must have loved it right, seeing the state I was in, how much of a pyscho must you be to want to see the results of your bosses plan up close.' He noticed a flicker in her eye, one he might have missed if he wasn't looking for it. 'Yeah, we know you worked for Moriarty. Took a while to confirm it but we know you were there at the pool. Did you get some sick satisfaction from playing house with me?'
‘There's nothing to forgive Sherlock, I already have, months ago. Can you...can you forgive me, for lying to you? For not telling you about Mary. I...I wanted to from the start, but you were still recovering from your ‘hiatus’ and I didn’t want to put any extra stuff on top.
He made to get out of his chair and the file on his lap slid onto the floor, the photos falling face up. He bent down to pick them up and froze. His heart stopped cold.
"So you figured that part out. Honestly it was a period in my life a long time ago. I don't regret any of it, but it's not my life anymore. James has been a great help keeping me informed on your whereabouts. The equipment from Q helps too." He paused. "You have no idea how much I wanted to run to your side, to just jump on a plane and turn up on your doorstep, give you hell for leaving me behind. Thing is I couldn't. Even if you had told me, asked me, begged me to come with you. I wouldn't have been able to," John said softly, running his hand though Sherlock's hair. He felt Sherlock still and look up at him.
"You know none of this would have been possible without you. You started the #I believe in Sherlock Holmes movement, not to mention all the evidence you managed to gather on Moriarty. I don't know how you managed it, and I probably don't want to know, but I'm glad you did."
'How did I not notice? I knew he cared about me, but he... he said he wasn't gay, and he dated all those women.' He spat.
He took in a deep breath as he reached the door of Sherlock's room, he needed to stop being a coward, he was a soldier. He decided that he would tell Sherlock exactly how he felt, and if it wasn’t wanted then... that was fine, it was all fine. He'd probably need to find somewhere else to live and... he stopped. He could hear voices, a voice he knew without a doubt was Sherlock.
'You obviously missed most of the conversation then. He went through hell when you were gone, he didn't think he would see you again, and there were several things that happened where when you did come back, there would be no John Watson for you to see.'
'Yeah, I want to be there, but could you get Greg here to watch him whilst were dealing with her. I don't want to leave him alone.'
'It's damn good to see you awake Sherlock. It's been too quiet in here. Trust you to wake up the one time John isn't here. He literally left about ten minutes ago.' He gave Sherlock a knowing look. ' He hasn't left your side the entire time you've been here, he was worried sick. All of us were in fact.'
'Shit. Dodged a bullet there mate. So who is the father then?'
"Go, your goldfish is waiting for you." Sherlock smiled shrugging on his Belstaff and wrapped his scarf around his neck. He then flicked up his collar.
"You want them to learn to deduce? Are you crazy?" John laughed
John stared at him in shock before looking back at Sherlock. God, marrying Sherlock would be the best day of his life, but Sherlock may not even want a relationship with him, might hate him for putting him through everything the last few months. He abandoned him to his new wife and Sherlock had gone back to drugs, had an affair with Janine, which he wasn't sure was real or not. Christ everything was so shit. Maybe he'd ruined any chance of ever being with Sherlock, christ he hoped not, everything he had done had been for him, he hoped that after all of this, maybe they could finally have their shot. Maybe it could finally be their time.
The two men lay in bed, holding each other after their lovemaking, basking in the knowledge that they were together again. Sherlock's fingers were tracing designs on John's skin.
"Thank you Mycroft," he said softly.
So Sherlock and Moriarty were on the rooftop. He then threatens Sherlock, jump or your friends will Sherlock would have predicted that, he would have been able to have countermeasures in place. His eyes strayed to the bloody pool again. Oh. Oh!
"Still turns me on when you do that," he chuckled, and Sherlock looked down at him eyes darkening with desire. "Yes your right, there is somebody else staying here."
No he couldn’t think like that. Sherlock would come back, he’d be changed, war does that to a man, and that was what Sherlock was doing, waging war on Moriarty’s web, and for once he was the person on the other side, waiting for his soldier to come home. He would do anything to be there for him, and if not for circumstances he would be. But he had other priorities first. Their child came first. Sherlock would need him when he returned and they’d be there waiting to welcome him home.
John felt Greg's gaze on him.
'Oh blimey. John told me about this. Please don't get lost in that head of yours. I'm serious. John is head over heels in love with you, has been for years. He, never told you because you don't do relationships, married to your work n all. He was happy just having you in his life, as his best friend.'
The other man glanced at him in confusion.
"I missed you so much Sherlock," John panted out, his heart fit to burst with the amount of love he felt for his husband above him.
"That's what confused me too. I went for the normal tests when I was younger but I was informed that I wasn't a carrier. I assumed someone had made a mistake with the test results."
Ok. So what wasn’t he observing?
John sighed. Thinking about his father always brought him back to the last time he’d actually spoken to his parents. They hadn’t approved of him going into the army and had kicked him out of the house after a huge blowout. He’d spoken briefly to them over the years, but when he informed them of his pending marriage to Sherlock, they had wiped their hands clean of him. Harry and he had become surprisingly much closer since his marriage, staying off the drink and actually getting back with Clara. She rang daily to make sure that he was ok and was coping.  Of course he wasn’t actually coping that well, but he was making sure he ate, when he could. Morning sickness had started kicking in, something he did not enjoy.
There another chapter complete. Please tell me what you think.
'Not much, just that John was working with Mycroft to bring Mary down and that the baby wasn't his. I assume that John found out stuff about Mary after the wedding since he seemed perfectly happy before then.' Greg sighed.
John quickly made his way through the hospital corridor, anxious to get back to Sherlock's side. The confrontation with Mary had gone far easier than he'd expected, but had brought out the many doubts that he'd been trying to ignore. This is what she did to him, made him feel worthless, made him doubt himself.
"James, James…Your friends with 007?" John laughed.
'I...I didn't know. How could I not have known.' He gripped his hair tightly, his eyes watering with unshed tears glaring at Greg. 'Why didn't he tell me, blame me for making him want to kill himself. Why didn't you tell me?' He shouted hoarsly.
"Well there wouldn't be, would there. My records were wiped." He could hear Mycroft splutter in surprise. It made him feel oddly proud.
'Did you ever tell Sherlock, about how you dealt with it all in the beginning?' Greg asked.
"He was getting too close, I couldn't have him anywhere near my children. I would protect them with my life Greg, they've been one of the only thing keeping me going these past two years."
"You were … when …" he stuttered. John almost laughed, God he thought, he'd finally broken Mycroft.
"Yeah, twins. That was a surprise believe you me."
‘I never thought we'd get here Sherlock. There was always something stopping us. I...I want this, I want us. I’ve never wanted something so much in all my life.’ Sherlock smiled at him, his mask fully down, showing John everything he had hidden from him.
"Yeah, well when Mycroft answered your phone call that night, I thought someone had died. He went as pale as the sheets. The fact that he didn't even question your intelligence before rushing out of bed was enough to tell me something had gone wrong on Sherlock's end. I remember he gave me this look before I left, it was the one where he says we'll talk about this later. I think he's finally cottoned on to the fact that I know more than I've been letting on. I think I've done well to hide it from him for the last two years, something I am totally proud about." John laughed causing Greg to join in, both laughing for a good minute. "Not that I've got anything on you though, I mean you've hidden successfully from the guy for two years, yet both me and Molly are here at least once a week. Not to mention that you've been keeping an eye of Sherlock's movements, helped me on cold and hot cases and on top of that raised two kids. Honestly I don't know how you do it. You do realise he's going to have questions." John raised an eyebrow.
‘So if he was going to leave her, why on earth did he stay with her?’
"It's not something we ever discussed, it never came up."
Leaving the bathroom he paused before making his way across the landing to close the twin's bedroom door. He then continued onto his bedroom, checking to make sure the room was tidy. The bed was made to military standard, something John had never grown out of since being discharged from the army. He looked across the room to the only picture that he kept in there, the one on his bedside table. It was the picture of them at their wedding, they looked so much younger back then. In the photo Sherlock was stood behind John with his arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him closer towards Sherlock. They were only looking at each other, a look that John never got tired of. It was one that spoke volumes, it silently spoke of love.
Sherlock flinched at the reference to the fall.
'Sherlock, your awake.' He breathed a sigh of relief seeing Sherlock looking at him, his eyes slightly glazed. He reached over to press the button for the nurses station.
"Goodbye Mycroft."
John gave him a sympathetic smile and gestured for him to sit down. He made his way over to the bed, gently grasping Sherlock's hand once again.
'He's fine. He's sorting something out with Mycroft downstairs.' Not a total lie, he was sorting stuff out, mainly taking Mary into custody.
"Gregory and Ms Hooper I assume?"
"Hmm."
Sherlock was here. After all this time, he'd finally made it back to him. He almost ran to the front door, before ripping it open.
"I…I want to meet them, but I… I don't really know how to be a dad. What if I'm no good, what if they hate me? I've already missed so much of their lives," Sherlock said worriedly. John shook his head.
He rubbed his stomach, somehow the testing when he was a child had been wrong, because he was without a doubt pregnant. Nearly three months actually, and he had been the one to figure it out, not Sherlock or Mycroft.
Greg smiled and clapped John's shoulder.
"They won't. They already love you." He stepped away from Sherlock and grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the room and back into his bedroom. "I knew that when you came back you'd feel like you had missed too much of their lives so between myself, Molly and Greg, we've been putting a photo album and DVD together. Molly's going to bring it over tomorrow, apparently they've got some finishing touches to put to it. I do have one picture here though." He let go of Sherlock's hand as they entered his room and went to grab his wallet. Opening it up, he removed a photograph and handed it to Sherlock. The photo showed John holding two small boys on his lap. Both boys had Sherlock's dark curly locks and cheekbones. Their eyes matched those of John, as did their lips and ears. They looked perfect. Sherlock grinned and pulled his husband close to him.
John would say that Sherlock had him at 'Afghanistan or Iraq', Sherlock would say it was at 'That was amazing'. Truly the adrenaline rush they had after solving their first case 'The Study in Pink' was when they had actually started the relationship. Both forgot their 'I'm not gay' and 'I'm married to my work' and when they came together it had just felt right. Of course things weren't always so perfect, there were times when John felt inadequate for Sherlock and wondered if this was some sort of experiment he was running. Then there were the times where Sherlock felt John deserved so much better and wondered when he was leaving. It had all finally come to a head at their first meeting of Moriarty. Seeing John strapped to enough semtex to level a building had been the breaking point for Sherlock. After escaping the pool and had gotten back home they'd had slow life-affirming sex, the kind where loving words were spoken and they confirmed with each other that they were still alive. Tears had been shed and before they had reached their climax Sherlock had asked him. Asked him to marry him, to be truly his. To be together always. John had been extremely enthusiastic with his response and both had climaxed not long after, pure love filling the room with their soft sighs and moans. Basking in the afterglow John had made sure that Sherlock knew that he was never leaving, he could never imagine a life without Sherlock Holmes, and he still couldn't.
"What for?"
"Thank you John. I never imagined I would have this, a … family. They look perfect John, your perfect. My one and only conductor of light. I didn't think it was possible to love you anymore than I already did, but you continue to surprise me Dr Watson."
Sherlock slowly nodded.
Greg smiled. See...totally besotted.
"Yeah but you've not been totally out of the game John, your deductions have been a great help to me over the years, and let's not forget that night last year." John shuddered as he remembered what had occurred that night.
'How, how much did you hear?' He asked, he needed to know how much damage control he needed to do.
"Then who, and how?"
"I haven't spoken to them since I informed them of my intentions to marry your brother." He told Mycroft coldly. "And I have no want or need to contact them ever again." Mycroft coughed awkwardly.
Chapter 3
{"You broke in here for a reason. Just tell us why and you can sleep. Remember sleep." The captured man murmured something making the interrogator lean closer to hear his mumbled words. The interrogators companion leaned forward in his chair.
Wow another update so fast, I'm kinda surprised at myself. So we're finally here, we got some angst and a bit of fluff and Johnlock has arrived. Hope you enjoy
'Why?' She finally asked. John looked at her in disbelief.
"It will be taken care of John, I will ensure that Baker Street is set up for your return."
The one thing that Sherlock couldn’t have predicted, the one thing that he would never have even expected Moriarty to do. If Moriarty was still alive then the attacks could still be called off, Sherlock would know this, but dead. There had been a choice he’d had to make, the life of his friends and husband or his life. Moriarty had killed himself, knowing that Sherlock wouldn’t make any other choice than the one he did. He killed himself knowing he had won.
When I started this I honestly had no idea where it would take me. This chapter was really hard for me to write, I struggled almost the entire time, rewriting parts, changing how the confrontation would go so many times. Anyway I finally finished it so I hope you enjoy.
'Oh I'm sure he'll recover, he bounces back quite quickly my brother. Of course I'm sure the first thing he tells us will be the name of his shooter, since they were stood right in front of him, he would have easily have seen their face.' John could see her face had smoothed out into one of concern, but he knew it wasn't for Sherlock, but for herself. 'Of course, a shot through the vena cava is a rather signature sign, isn't it...Rosamund.'
'No, I fell in love with you.' John laughed coldly.
Greg looked like a deer in headlights. He looked like he had just told him he was actually a girl and was having Sherlocks kids.
Greg stood at the window of Sherlock's hospital room, sipping on the fresh coffee that one of Mycrofts men had brought him. He glanced over at Sherlock, lying still in the hospital bed, the heart monitor beeping steadily. It was...wrong. Sherlock should never be as still as he was, he was always energetic, running around deducing crime scenes, running after suspects.
'I heard you. You and John speaking earlier.'
This time he leant in for a kiss, arms still wrapped around each other. It started soft before pushing John forward, lips still connected, closing the door behind him with his foot. The tables turned and he found himself thrust up against the door as John kissed him, their tongues battling for dominance. He could feel John's arousal through his jeans, and more of his blood disappeared down south, causing further stains on his own erection. Oh God, he needed more, more friction. He growled against John's mouth thrusting upwards causing both men to cry out.
John quickly came back to the present as the kettle finished boiling. He quickly made the tea, wrinkling his nose at the fact that it was decaffeinated, caffeine was bad for the baby, and hobbling with the use of his cane he settled into his armchair. He placed the cane against the side of the table and took a sip of the hot brew to calm himself. He breathed out and looked around the room, his eyes immediately drawn to the leather chair opposite him. Sherlock’s chair.
He drained the last of his coffee and crushed the cup in his hand. Damn Mary and her meddling. Quite possibly it would have been Sherlock and John's wedding they had gone to if she hadn't been around, and to think that she worked for Moriarty and even then, when she was getting married to John she cheated on him. It was one blow after another, at least John didn't actually love her, otherwise this would have been a whole lot worse.
'Enough to know that he trusts Mycroft more than me.' he returned flatly.
Tears were streaming down John’s face at the heartbroken look on Sherlock. He'd never seen him so open, never seen so much emotion there before. He didn’t know what to say, he never expected this kind of response.
"And you're confident you have?" Mycroft sniffed. Sherlock glared at him.
The next photo made him wince. It was a photo of the blood pool left behind by Sherlock. Just looking at it made him feel queasy. He rubbed his stomach gently, bracing himself before looking at it again. And again.
The ambulance building made sure that he hadn’t seen Sherlock hit the ground. But he’d heard it, he’d definitely heard a body hit the ground. He’d ran to the corner, seeing Sherlock on the ground, and then he’d been hit by that biker, and he’d hit his head on the ground. The biker hadn’t stopped to apologise, the biker hadn’t … the biker. He knew him, or at least recognised the face. He was one of Sherlock’s homeless network, but why was he there? Why did he knock John down, was it an accident or done on purpose? He’d stopped him from getting to Sherlock too quickly.
"Their staying at Molly's tonight, said I'd text her when we were ready for her to drop them back to me. I wanted the chance to explain, give you time to think about it, adjust."
‘Of course I forgive you John, I always will. Your ...everything to me John,’ Sherlock finished softly, and finally John could see it. He could see it clear as day written on Sherlock's face. He gave him a soft smile, slowly reaching out to gently grasp his hand. He looked directly into Sherlock's eyes and told him what he had always meant to.
‘You have no idea how much I have dreamt about this moment, scarily enough I’ve always imagined it to happen after one of us has been hurt in a case.’
So this is my first posting on here and its a Sherlock fic. I really love this series and the characters are really amazing to work with.
So another chapter for you guys, I'm hoping to update daily until the story is finished. Hope you guys enjoy!
Gred looked at him in shock.
"I know. I really can't wait to go back. Most of the stuff from the house is packed up in the moving van, the furniture is staying so just my clothes, the twins stuff and a few bits and pieces. With all that gone I'm hoping that Sherlock won't guess too much before I tell him."
It had started with drinking, just a bit, and then it escalated. He rarely left the flat, and when he did it was to get more alcohol. He was drunk most of the time and when he had found out, he had asked Mycroft for help. They'd gotten rid of all the alcohol at the flat whilst John had attempted to get back into working at the clinic. When John had come back from work he'd been absolutely furious. He screamed and shouted at them until he'd grabbed the closest thing to throw at them. It just happened to be the skull. He'd gone to throw it at them l, but then he realised what he was holding and had broken down right in front of them, falling to his knees in tears. Seeing John so broken had really shown him how much he cared for Sherlock, and how lost he was without him. Greg blamed himself for not being there for him. He'd tried to stay away due to his involvement in Sherlock's arrest, thinking John wouldn't want to see him. After that he turned up more often, helping John in his worst moments.
"I get by. Honestly I don't really know how I do it. I mean Sherlock he has his mind palace which helps him to work through things. I just have Sherlock. It's like he's in my head and he does all the deducing and I just repeat what he says, in a more polite manner."
"Godfather?"
'No, you just happen to have combat gear and a gun with a silencer as part of your everyday wear. Pull the other one Mary, you didn't save him, you wanted him dead. The only reason you haven't tried it before is because you thought you'd won. But let me tell you something, you lost before you even realised it.'
‘We were always heading towards this John, we would have got there eventually. I want this too, I want you back at Baker Street, solving crimes with me, making tea. I want us to be who we are together.’ John nodded in agreement. It was all he wanted. He slowly leant his head down to do something he had wanted for what seemed like forever. He closed his eyes and gently pressed their lips together, in a brief soft kiss. He pulled back a bit to see Sherlock  with his eyes closed, a look of pure bliss on his face. He felt Sherlock's other hand on the back of his head pull his down for another kiss, this time longer but no less gentle.
Greg looked at him, confusion still showing on his face.
"Case?" he questioned. Sherlock nodded and smirked at him, seeing the excitement in John's eyes. John quickly got out of the chair and called down to Mrs Hudson. She appeared shortly at the doorway, a light dancing in her eyes as she took in the excited air in the flat.
He turned to face Sherlock. The both of them were idiots. They were both in love with each other but neither of them could admit it to the other. It was a damn mess. Sherlock had spent two years pretending to be dead to protect John, and John had married an assassin to keep Sherlock safe. Honestly he thought that Sherlock had it easier than John, at least he didn't think the man he loved was dead, with no chance of reconciliation.
Why too quickly?
Blood drained from Sherlock's face as he put the pieces together.
John gave a quiet sob. Sherlock was coming home.
It was everything he had ever hoped, and better.
'No, he wouldn't. Not John. John wouldn't. That's not...' he looked up at Greg, his eyes pleasing with him to be wrong. Greg shook his head.
There was something about Molly too. She refused to look him in the eye, avoiding it at all costs since the fall. He’d also seen her talking to Mycroft, not odd as she did do the autopsy but it wasn’t a grieving type of conversation, more like a worried one. And since when were she and Mycroft on talking terms? She was hiding something, and Mycroft was in on it too. And there was something else, neither had cried at the funeral. Mycroft he could understand, he was a cold-hearted bastard, but Molly, she was pretty much in love with him, she would have felt devastated at his death. At the time he was too wrapped up in his own misery to think on it, but now.
Sherlocks head whipped round, staring at Greg in shock.
"Sherlock, Moran was a dangerous man. Yes he followed Moriarty's lead, but he doesn't give up a job ever. He's an extremely good sniper, and I would know." Sherlock looked at him, deducing what he knew. John watched as his eye's widened as he worked it out. "Yes, he was the one that shot my shoulder, although he didn't recognise me as I was pretty wrapped up in a scarf to keep the dust out of my face. If things had gone differently that day, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be here now." Sherlock's arms tightened around John, as if to make sure he wasn't going anywhere.
John let out a sigh of relief, and gave Greg a small smile.
"You know, I've lived here for nearly two years, but it's not home. It's never been home. Baker Street became my home, mine and Sherlock's." He smiled looking back over the two years he had spent there with Sherlock and Mrs Hudson. He gasped. "Shit, Mrs Hudson. Oh God, can you imagine what her reaction is going to be when we get back. She's going to freak." Molly laughed.
John flinched. He wasn’t so sure he was ready for this conversation, but here it was.
'He.. he found your stash.' Silence. He looked back at Sherlock who was shaking his head in denial.
I don't own Sherlock
"Thanks Mrs H. You're the best." He said before quickly running upstairs to check on the boys. Both were having their afternoon naps so John quickly placed a soft kiss on both their heads before slipping quietly out of the room. He made it downstairs and answered Sherlock's questioning look with one of his own, letting him know that they were ok and still asleep. They quickly made their way down the stairs and to the front door. Before he opened the door, Sherlock leant down to kiss John, it was just a brief touch of their lips, but it was all they needed. Then they were out the door and into the street, getting into a taxi that Sherlock had managed to stop, ready to go on their next adventure.
It had been so long since he'd seen his husband, he looked thinner, obviously not eating right. He ran his eyes over his husbands form, taking in the same high cheekbones, bow shaped lips, same Belstaff coat with the collar up just the way he liked it. His Sherlock, his consulting detective. He felt himself drinking in the sight that he had been deprived of for so long. He re-familiarised himself with his husband.
"I believe that Sherlock will have no problems with either of their names. Anyway I must go, I believe that Gregory will be proposing tonight." John laughed.
"Children? As in more than one?" John laughed.
'So that's it your just going to let big brother lock me up. I'm pregnant with your child, does that even mean anything to you?'
'What are you talking about?' She turned to Mycroft who was still stood by the window. 'What's he talking about?'
Things weren't all sunshine and daisies though, real life never is. They dealt with the overwhelming amount of nightmares that both men had to endure, Sherlock's about his time 'dead', about the lives he had taken, about his capture. John's were still about the fall, or finding out the Sherlock had died on his mission. These dreams caused them to both wake up, drenched with sweat a fair few times the first couple of weeks. When it happened the other would pull them close together, hands stroking hair to help calm, until they fell asleep again. Eventually the nightmares started to taper off and both were able to get decent amounts of sleep, the wounds in their bodies and minds gradually healing.
The call ended, and John breathed out a sigh of relief. The call had gone better than he'd expected. He'd never heard Mycroft so emotional, or as flustered as he had been. It was an entirely enjoyable sensation knowing that he had been the root cause of it.
‘After almost poisoning myself on alcohol, I worked hard to clear your name, it helped to keep all the bad thoughts away. Once it was done though, they all came flooding back, ten times worse. I just, I couldn't keep a lid on it anymore, it was too much, so yeah, I tried to take the cowards way out, only I couldn't even manage to do that properly. None of this,’ he indicated towards the hospital laid Sherlock ‘would have happened if I had actually died that day.’ A shocked silence reigned in the hospital room.
"I will look into this for you John, you have my word. I would not make you contact your parents if that is what you wish. Sherlock had indeed informed me that they were unhappy with your choice in partner, but I didn't realise that the negativity between you was this bad."
"Have you asked your parents about the subject?" John's face clouded over at the mention of his parents.
"I wanted to tell you, you know. I was kind of hoping you'd deduce it to be honest. You always seem everything, but the thing I wanted you to see most of all, you missed entirely. I assumed that it was because you were so busy dealing with Moriarty, but I really wanted to tell you, I just never got the chance. Finding out you were still alive, it was everything I wanted, and a really big part of me wanted to go after you, the soldier part of me wanted more than anything wanted to be a part of the plan. I couldn't though, I couldn't risk them, and they needed me more than you did. Putting myself at risk would endanger them, it was something that I couldn't, wouldn't do."
His interrogator spat at him, sparing a glance at his companion who was sitting further back in the room, shrouded in the darkness. The interrogator picked up a short metal pipe, and rounded on the prisoner once more.
'You weren't meant to be there, i had no choice, I shot him to save him. He wasn't meant to die, just give me enough time to get away. I knew you were there and the ambulance would get there in time. I was there for Magnussen, he has files on me, he's been blackmailing me, I just needed to get them. You need to understand John, who I was then is not who I am now.' John snorted.
What was going on?
Something was off.
I do not own Sherlock.
'No. He was never In love with her. He was settling for what he had. He thought that she was the best chance he had of a normal life...until you came back. You just strolled right back into his life... like you had never been gone, like he hadn't gone through hell everyday that you weren't there. You acted like you just returned from a brief holiday, not that you were back from the dead. He felt like you just didn't care, that you were just laughing behind his back at poor idiotic John.'
John frowned. He rested the file on his lap and adopted a Sherlock type pose.
"I think Mycroft will get there first, only because he has more information. I mean I don't know everything, which is good, there are parts of it I can guess, obviously I know about the kids."
'She was one of the snipers at the pool. She wanted Sherlock dead, me dead and I just let her waltz into my life, like she was supposed to be there, and everything she said, everything she did was a lie. She had orders to seduce me, to keep an eye on me and I didn't even notice. I thought, I really thought that she would be someone I could fall for, that I could finally move on. That I wouldn't feel so empty anymore. But it was a lie, the whole bloody thing was a con.'
Sherlock, it all came back to him. Even now his mind couldn’t let him go and he found himself unconsciously thinking about that day all over again. He had tried to not think of it, had stopped himself from trying to analyse it, trying to see what he missed, but he couldn’t stop himself. He needed answers, he needed to know why, because the Sherlock he knew would never have been even a little bit bothered by what the press had to say, would never had left John behind for no reason.
'Oh, that was the obvious thing, I can't be the babies dad as I can't have kids. I'm shooting blanks so to speak'
John hardened his face, but inside his thoughts were screaming at him. Was she right? Was he to blame for everything that Sherlock had gone through, the torture in Serbia. He thought back to his sister and his parents, they always had blamed him for everything that went wrong, his dad losing his job, Harry being kicked out. He never could get anything right, maybe it was true, maybe everything around him did go wrong, he'd never stood up for his sister when she'd told their parents she was gay, never told anyone about the abuse his father dealt them, never was serious with any of his past relationships because he was afraid he'd end up like his dad, afraid to accept who he was. She was right, the damage was already done, he'd pulled away from Sherlock to keep his cover as a happily married husband. They hadn't been in contact in months, he didn't even know what Sherlock had been doing since the wedding, well he knew who he'd been doing if the sounds from the bathroom were anything to go by. He certainly seemed very relaxed around her. That if anything should prove to him that Sherlock just wasn't gay, after all he'd been in love with The Woman too. The only man he could ever love, was the one man he couldn't have. He knew he'd romanticized Sherlock after the fall, seeing looks that weren't really their, touches which weren't anything but friendly, and now it was obvious that friendship, if even that, was all that they'd ever have. And he would be fine with that, he'd have to be fine with it. He couldn't let Sherlock know, not now, not ever. All his ideas of a future with Sherlock were gone, all of his fantasies where they both revealed their love just looked horribly stupid and sentimental now.
"How…"
"What can you deduce about the house that I chose to stay in Sherlock?" They locked eyes before Sherlock sat up, back against the headboard of the bed. He immediately went into his thinking pose, steepled hands against his lips. God, it had been so long since he'd seen that familiar sight, and John loved seeing it once again. Sherlock finally spoke.
Knowing that he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep he slowly got out of bed, grabbing his hated cane to help bring him to his feet. The pain in his leg had come back recently, "psychosomatic", Sherlock's voice in his head supplied. John assumed that it was because of his grief, he was slowly reverting back to how he had been pre-Sherlock. He almost laughed at that thought. He now thought of his life as separated into pre and post-Sherlock, and God was his life so much better when Sherlock was around. With Sherlock in his life the days had seemed brighter, more enjoyable. There was always cases and post-case fun. Winding up Mycroft, and deducing Donavon and Andersons affair. It was the best two years of his life.
Harry had also become a welcome part of their lives. She and Clara had been back together since Sherlock had left, and was still sober after all this time. She had been a bit put out that John hadn't told her about her nephews, but had forgiven him immediately after hearing the full story. She had pulled her brother into a crushing hug, he was her younger brother and she felt like she had failed to protect him. The brief mention of their parents had both siblings pausing for a moment, the sting of being unwanted causing them both pain. Their respective partners had recognised this in them and had helped steer the conversation onto better subjects.
"Now be good for Auntie Molly, both of you. Mummy loves you so much." He leaned into the car so he was able to press kisses to both the heads of his children. "And when you get back, daddy will be home." At these words, the twins started babbling 'Dada' causing John to smile. "That's right boys, daddy's coming home." He felt tears welling up in his eyes as those words. The last two years had been difficult, and without his little angels it could have, and probably would have gone a very different way. John shook his head, ridding himself of the dark thoughts that threatened to cloud his mind. He took once last look at his children before closing the door of the car. He turned around to see the pathologist standing by the car, waiting for him to finish. "Thanks for doing this Molly," he said giving her a small smile.
John told him.
Mycroft stepped forward, his eyes trained on Mary.
But Sherlock was smart, so smart that he would have predicted several ways in which the confrontation would have gone down. Where was his contingency plan?
At that moment he had never felt more alone.
'He wasn't fine Sherlock, he was broken. You broke him. How did you think Mary got her claws in him huh. He was literally at rock bottom when she turned up. He had to move out of Baker street because he kept thinking you'd just walk through the door like nothing had happened. You were his best friend, the person who fixed his limp, gave him back his life. Made him fall in love. And then you were gone, and he, he was so lost. He started drinking, he was smoking, and when we finally cleared the flat of those, he ... ' Greg stopped. Maybe he shouldn't, this was John's choice. He'd literally begged Greg no to tell him. Sherlocks voice interrupted him.
6 Months Later
In this case maybe Mycroft was right, caring might make you a stronger, better person, but it also gave enemies a weak point, something to use against you. Moriarty knew this, he would have used Sherlock’s friends against him, would have threatened their lives. Of course Sherlock wouldn’t have wanted them dead, but he’s been backed into the proverbial corner.
"William and Alexander Holmes." Sherlock stared at the picture for a bit longer, his heart full of emotions, love, pride and happiness. Family. His family. He leaned down and kissed John.
'Well for starters the wedding wasn't a real wedding, the marriage certificate was never filed. It also helps that Mary Morstan doesn't exist. She stole the name from a grave. Secondly the baby isn't mine'
'Ms Morstan,' Mycroft said, he inclined his head in greeting. Mary gave him a cold look.
How was it? Please leave a review if you liked it, we writers feed off your opinions you know!
He took a deep breath, before letting it out again. He'd think of something, but right now he needed to get back to Sherlock
'Right after Sherlock came back, after the parliament case. I thought that maybe I'd moved on, but I hadn't. I'd just bottled it all up, and there he was saving my life again. Making me laugh and call him a cock for his stupid stunts. God I...I was going to end it, I couldn't be with her, not knowing that Sherlock was alive. It wouldn't have been fair. Not when I didn't love her like I should of...not like I loved him.' There was silence as he let Greg take in everything he had just told him.
When John had opened the front door of 221B Baker Street, Mrs Hudson had appeared and pulled him in for a crushing hug, telling him how much she had missed him and how worried she had been. Of course Sherlock's arrival with the two baby carriers had entirely shocked her, although the presence of the babies had distracted her from what John thought, would have been a long talking to. She had cooed over them, keeping them well occupied as John and Sherlock, with the help of Greg and Molly moved John's belongings back into the flat. Finally John felt that he was finally home.
John nodded, looking forlornly at Sherlock.
He gently placed a kiss on Sherlock's hand before letting it go, giving Greg a grateful look before exiting the room. Time for the big reveal. Mary wouldn't know what hit her. She had made a big mistake going after Sherlock. One she would now pay for.
Yes they most certainly did. He had questions, questions that needed answering. He looked back up to where his brother was, then re-opened the file that was on his desk.
"Ah yes, I do recall asking if there would be a happy announcement by the end of the week. I don't believe it took even that long, the end of the study in pink case I believe."
Greg nodded.
Greg shook his head, bloody Mycroft. Time for some home truths. Yeah maybe it wasn't the time, Sherlock had been shot and was recovering, but damn the guy needed some sense knocked into him, and by God damn it he was going to get through to him.
John grimaced, and reached out to move an errant curl off of Sherlock's face.
"Moriarty's network – took me two years to dismantle it."
Blood drained from Greg's face. Damn Sherlock and his inquisitiveness. This was John's story to tell, not his.
'Leave? But why would he leave her? He clearly loved her, asked her to marry him.'
'I think they'd make an excellent fire starter at Baker street, don't you think.'
"Oooh, a case boys?" she asked. John nodded.
Greg once again stared at him before chuckling nervously.
"Yes he always was the emotional sort, although he hides it quite well. No one saw it until you though. His conductor of light he would say. He'll be with you soon John."
Sherlock shook his head.
'I deserve a bloody medal for dealing with the two of you, but life's certainly not boring with you guys around.'
The man stood up, disguised in a heavy coat and hood. {"You have no idea the trouble it took to find you."}
"Thanks for helping with the packing today Greg, I didn't realise how much stuff I had accumulated since moving in here."
"I'm not hearing this am I."
“Sherlock!!”
"It's no problem, Greg's going to be busy with Mycroft tonight, and you know how much I love them. You need this time John, you and Sherlock need to reconnect with each other. You'll both have things that need saying, and that means both of you have to be willing to listen to the other, with no distractions." John smiled. Whereas Greg had been his closest friend over the last two years, Molly had been his rock. Breaking the news of his and Sherlock's marriage had been more of a shock to her than him knowing that she had had a hand in Sherlock's death'. Once she's gotten over it she had realised how well he and Sherlock fitted, and with the reveal of his pregnancy and the threat to his life she had risen to the occasion brilliantly. Both she and Greg had helped him move out of his home, to this house. But more importantly it was she that had helped deliver both of his babies, she who had been there for a shoulder to cry on when things had gotten bad. As if knowing where his thoughts were she gave him a smile. "Don't worry John, you'll be back at Baker Street before you know it." John blinked, then laughed.
'Because she was a threat to you, and we didn't have enough evidence to bring her in.'
What he had said to Greg earlier was right though, he'd take whatever sort of relationship Sherlock wanted, and if that was just friends, well it wouldn’t be any different from normal then would it.
"Yeah well only you and Molly know about them. I mean you've both been there for me since the beginning of this ride, you were both there when I needed a shoulder to cry on, and cases when I was bored out of my mind. I think the most important time was at the moment when I really needed Sherlock, and he couldn't be here, you both were to help bring my children into the world. Without your help I'm not sure I would have coped."
'No, that's not true. John loves me, he married me. Tell him it's not true John. Tell him you love me, your wife.' She yelled, twisting round so that she faced John again, who was still pointing his gun at her. He smirked.
John looked up at hearing a knock on the door. He got up cautiously, standing in front of the comatose Sherlock, a barrier between the door and the detective.
"It was one of MI6's undercover locations, I investigated into who had used it recently, I was only able to find their code name, 3CW. This was of course no use to me as there also seemed to be no records of that particular code name. That aside, at least your safe now."
They were both close, and were moving against each other, loud moans and gasps filling the room as they reaffirmed their love.
If anyone could do it, it would be him. And he would do it, he would definitely do it, but why not tell him, why not explain after the fact?
'I'm not proud of my past, but it was over. I moved on, became a different person. I fell in love with you John. I love being Mary Watson. I can't lose you over something I did in my past John, please.' She pleaded, tears slowly falling down her face. John had to give it to her, she was a hell of an actress.
"No-one knew, just me. I did the tests myself at work. I found out just before Moriarty resurfaced. I wanted to tell him, but I didn't want to distract him from the case. There was never the right moment. Then he was gone."
"Of course, you know how much I love the little angels, they're a lot easier to deal with than you two, that's for certain. At least they don't shoot my walls!" John laughed and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
"I didn't start the movement, I just asked the homeless network to spread it around a little bit, next thing I know it's a twitter thing and #IBISH is being spray painted around the city. The info on Moriarty is a bit harder to explain, let's just say I have some very good friends."
"I'm home John. I'm home," he whispered.
'Out of our whole conversation, that was what you heard? Jesus Sherlock.' Greg ran his fingers through his hair. 'Blimey, John should really be the one to tell you this, but I don't know how long he'll be gone dealing with the wick witch of the west. Look. After that first case, when you got back. John...John was going to leave Mary.'
He gave a final squeeze of John shoulder before making his way out of the room. As he opened the door he turned his head to look back at John. 'Oh and Dr Watson, am I to receive a happy invitation by the end of the week? I believe that it's already several years overdue,' and he left leaving John to stand there, looking a bit shocked. John huffed, chuckling a bit at the elder Holmes actions. He remembered Mycroft asking him the same thing when they'd first met. He groaned. What was he supposed to do now? From what he'd seen, Sherlock had no interest in him, but Mycroft's last words said different. How was he supposed to figure this out? How was he supposed to find out if the man he loved, returned those feelings without ruining what was left of their friendship. He just didn't know.
"Hello Mycroft."
'No, he just married an assassin who wants to kill me.' He replied moodily. Greg clenched his fists. Blimey, he may be a genius but he was being an absolute idiot right at this moment, and he wasn't going to take it anymore. He hadn't said anything about it before, but Sherlock deserved to know. He needed to know what John had gone through, because he clearly didn't know. Hadn't realised what his 'death' had truly done to John Watson.
"How long until they figure it all out?" John asked. Greg took a mouthful of tea, looking thoughtful.
Shock coursed through Greg at the sound of Sherlocks voice, and then relief. He was ok. Everything was going to be ok.
'Jesus, your just as bad as he is. Blimey, go deal with the soon to be ex-wife and then you can continue staring dreamily at your future husband. Just make sure to name me best man, I've been loading up on all the juicy stories.'
'Heard...you.' he managed to get out, his voice was raspy and dry. Greg went to speak when the door to the room opened. He stood in front on Sherlock's bed, wary of the newcomer. It was a nurse, and when she found out Sherlock was awake, she asked him a few questions before leaving to get him some ice chips. She quickly returned, giving Greg the cup of ice chips, before quickly leaving the room again. Greg awkwardly fed Sherlock some of the ice chips, damn where was John, this was totally his job.
Christ, where had everything gone wrong.
"I won't lie and say he won't have questions, that he won't be furious. But he knows you, knows you better than anyone else, myself included. He knows you wouldn't have done it without a good reason. He'll hear you out, and he will forgive you. It just might take some time." Sherlock nodded.
From the moment John had arrived on that first crime scene it had always been Sherlock and John. There wasn't one without the other. And then John was left alone, and he had a full face preview of what John had been like before Sherlock, because John had broke.
'I think hitting you several times was bad enough mate, I don't think he wanted you to know. He didn't want to look weak, and he asked, no begged me not to say anything to you. He was just happy you were back, and he'd already forgiven you. He didn't want you blaming yourself, distancing yourself from him.'
Chapter 1
"Yes I did wonder about that, I had calculated that you wouldn't be there until after I had missed my check in time."
“James. I need your help.”
Another lie. As John re-watched the memory something twigged, something he had missed. As Sherlock had spoken those words he’d looked behind him to his right. Why would he do that? Why would he look back, as if he was looking at something… or someone?
"How is it possible that you were an MI6 agent? I have looked over the files repeatedly. It's not in your dossier and there are no records anywhere of your involvement." John chuckled darkly.
'I hope so, he doesn't even know that the marriage was fake and that the baby isn't mine.'
"A good surprise?" John asked worriedly, biting his lip.
John was brought out of his thoughts of the last six months by the ringing of Sherlock's phone. He hoped to God that it was Greg with a case. Both he, and Sherlock had been itching for a case for days. He loved being a mother, loved caring for his children, but he also loved the thrill of the chase, of helping Sherlock with his deductions, the high that they could only get after solving a case. He watched as Sherlock hung up and a gleeful look covered his face.
"Yeah, well they weren't happy when Harry came out, I was supposed to be the perfect son. Of course going into the Army didn't exactly make them happy, but we still spoke occasionally. After hearing what they had to say about Sherlock, well I'm happy to never speak with them again. I still have Harry, she rings me once a week to chat, make sure that I'm ok. She doesn't know about any of this though."
It took a few more minutes before Sherlock came back to himself, blinking his eyes rapidly.
"And John?" he asked, pausing for a moment. A look of anguish was clearly etched on his face. Mycroft winced at seeing the sadness on his brother's face. "How is he?" Mycroft fidgeted feeling uncomfortable as Sherlock asked of news about his husband.
"I had no doubts John. It is the mental damage that I am worried about, he has been on his own for a long time, doing things that he was not accustomed to. He's not a soldier. He will be changed."
"To ending it?" John finished. There was silence on the other end of the phone. "Honestly I don't know if I would have, but the amount of time I spent cleaning my gun, it wasn't healthy. You were right when you said I missed the war. I missed the excitement, I missed the adrenaline rushing through my veins, protecting people. The worst was that I felt so lonely, so out of contact with people that I didn't think anyone would miss me. I didn't connect with anyone anymore. Not until I met your brother. Honestly, Mike recognising me and talking to me, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Meeting Sherlock changed my life, he saved me in all the ways that a man can be saved. There was a connection from the beginning and I think you saw that, even if I did deny it at the time."
Mary stared at them in disbelief.
'Says the one who's a doctor, you can't stand hospital's either dear.' John grinned at her, and began to lead her to where Mycroft had set up. It was in the opposite direction to Sherlock's room, so she had no chance of getting near him ever again. By the time they took her in he'd be a free man again, no longer having to lie everyday to the people he was closest to, especially Sherlock. He hated lying to him, the whole thing made him feel so used, he disgusted himself. Realising they were reaching the prepared room he readied himself for the conversation that was about to happen. He couldn't be more ready for it if he tried.
'Christ I'm glad your here Mary. I... God it's been a long night. I thought he was going to die, and there was nothing I could do about it.' He felt her rub his back in a comforting manner. He kissed the top of her head and stood back, seeing the soft look in her eyes from the kiss.
"Yeah I was about two years in the army when they approached me. How could I turn down an offer like that? So I accepted and went into the training programme. Met a few good guys there, James being one of them. When the position came up me, James and another candidate where chosen for a mission to retrieve information, an UC agent had already been captured. However when we got there it turned into a FUBAR situation. The UC had been badly injured and as a Doctor I couldn't leave him to die. I told the others to carry on and complete the mission. Luckily the mission was a success and the UC lived, although he never fully recovered from his injury. I think it's called dereliction of duty, but because I saved the life of the UC agent they released me back to the army, wiped all my records. It was like I was never there. James of course felt that it was unjustified, but I was happy, and he got the 00 position, told me if I ever needed help, all I had to do was ring."
"John. He just left the building, I've provided a car which will drive him to your current residence. He should arrive within the hour," Mycroft informed him, causing John to breathe a sigh of relief.
"He's coming back Greg, Mycroft will bring him back and this is one less thing he has to worry about. He needs to be free to do what he's supposed to do, be the consulting detective again. I needed to prove without a doubt that Sherlock was innocent, that info just helped to solidify it." Greg gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze.
"Probably, but then I did marry Sherlock. Talking about marriage, you and Mycroft. You finally going to ask him then?"
"Yes, well a concerned party has been keeping an eye on you, a far better one than I have it would seem. Don't ask me how because I don't know. I was contacted the day after you were captured, he informed me of what had happened and made me promise to do all I could to get you out of there, hence why I came myself. I knew not to doubt him so I immediately left arranging for transport, and of course learning Serbian on my way there. He has kept me appraised of the situation in England whilst I was away. He has managed what I was unable to do, he has cleared your name. You're a free man once more."
After waving them off, John returned to the inside of the house, looking around his living accommodations of the last two years. The living room had been stripped of all family photo's which usually hung there, making the room look rather bare. He then made his way up the stairs to the bathroom to pull out his medical kit. He quickly checked it to make sure everything he may require was present, he knew that Sherlock maybe injured during his captivity, and though he was sure that Mycroft would see that his brother had seen the best care, he wanted to check on his husband himself.
Sherlock looked shocked. He was staring at Greg, not even blinking. It was definitely creepy.
'She worked for him Greg, she worked for Moriarty.' she told him softly. He heard Greg release a gasp, his face clearly showing his shock.
He’d wanted to tell him and was planning something for the next day, but then Moriarty happened and John waited, he didn’t want to give him anything he could use against Sherlock. He waited too long though, if he’d have known what would happen he would of told him, would have told him they were going to have a child. Now Sherlock would never meet their baby, would never teach them how to deduce, never threaten their first girlfriend/boyfriend.
"You would have gone, I understand John why you couldn't, and so will Sherlock. I'm afraid I must go now, Gregory will be here momentarily and I believe a chat is long overdue."
"I saw your work, it was very good. What I can't work out though is why you went after him? Surely you knew that Sherlock would get him."
"I will admit to not knowing how he will react. He'll be shocked for certain, but they are a part of you John, how could he not love them. Things will work out John, I promise."
John shook his head.
"So your saying that Sherlock is your mind palace, hmmm. Well it may be Sherlock in your head, but he's not actually here. So technically you do actually see it all but your brain uses Sherlock to work through it."
What was off in the picture?
'Who is it?' he asked, steady hands ready to grab his gun at a second's notice. A muffled voice came through and John, recognising the voice of the detective inspector quickly made his way to the door, opening it to show the worried face of Greg Lestrade, who quickly made his way into the room. Only when the door was closed securely behind him did John relax.
Chapter 4
For two weeks he had thought that he was truly alone, those two weeks were the worst weeks of his life, worse than when he came back from the war. Only the thought of his pregnancy kept him drinking himself into oblivion. But that was in the past, Sherlock was home. He was alive and John needed his husband in his arms, needed him like he needed air.
John bolted upright, Sherlock's name on his lips as he awoke from another re-enactment of the worst day of his life, just two weeks previous. Sweat clung to him and his breath came out in painful gasps. Tears began to fall down his cheeks as he sobbed into his hands. Two weeks of hell. Every night he would revisit that day, and every time he would wake up screaming. He could hardly bare staying at the flat, but leaving was something that he couldn’t, wouldn’t do. He saw Sherlock everywhere and it broke his heart every time. The man he loved, his Sherlock was dead.
'Thanks Greg, your a good friend, for both of us.'
Back to John.
"But why…" John sighed and interrupted him.
"Three months."
‘Never unwanted John. I...I didn't realise what it was until it was too late. When I was on top that building, I realised that it was always this. That I was in love with you.’
"What happened?"
John felt like everything that he had ever dreamt about was coming true.
An obvious lie, Sherlock didn’t apologise for lying. Of course he was able to apologise, but he would never apologise for lying because he usually did it for a good reason.
He leant against the kitchen sink, his arm’s one again encircling his stomach. It shouldn’t have been possible, but then since when did anything either of them ever do be anything else.
So this was it, time to see how much Mycroft had figured out.
He was going home.
"We were ambushed, my team were waiting for extraction. I remember that I had stumbled slightly from a stone, and then I remember being in unimaginable pain. I remember falling to the ground and Murray was dragging me behind cover, staunching the blood flow. He had to dig the bullet out. That's when I said it."
"I thank God every day that I stumbled on that rock because if I hadn't, the bullet would have gone straight through my heart, I wouldn't be here. I never would have met you. So yes, I knew what Moran was like, but I also knew that this was my battle, this was something I had to do. Do you understand?" Sherlock nodded, pressing a kiss to John forehead. "When I figured out what you had done, and why you had done it, I understood Sherlock. I knew why, and yes to begin with I was so angry at you, and upset, and damn right furious. You lied to me, and made me watch and I blamed myself. It took me two weeks to be rational enough to put everything together, but in those two weeks I hated myself, I blamed myself so much. I would have given anything for you to come back, to walk through the door like nothing happened. Since I found out I've had a long time to come to terms with it, I know you probably expected to get punched," Sherlock chuckled.
'I still don't understand.' Sherlock said frustration seeping through his voice.
'No, I'd never think that about him.'
John grimaced and looked back at Sherlock, giving the hand he was holding a gentle squeeze.
'So I'm assuming Mycrofts got this all in hand then. She'll disappear quietly.' John nodded.
This was their happy ever after. They'd faced the demon's and won, had been kept apart, each going down a different path, but those paths had finally met again and now they had the future to look forward to. Soon they'd be back at Baker Street, back with Mrs Hudson, raising the twins, back getting cases from Greg, running through London. Things were moving again and neither man could be happier with their ending, because it wasn't really an ending, it was a beginning. A brand new life. The game as Sherlock would say, was on.
"Wading in? You sat there and watched me being beaten to a pulp." Mycroft frowned.
"Worried, I think he's a bit nervous about how you're going to react. I also wanted to tell you that without your prompt call with the information, his condition would have been much worse than it was."
"War changes people Mycroft," John said softly, remembering his time in the army. "Sherlock helped me last time, now it's my turn. I don't care what he's done, all I care about is seeing him back in my life, seeing him back in his element as a consulting Detective and my husband."
"What for?"
His sobs gradually lessoned and his hands which had been covering his face moved to encircle his at the moment flat abdomen. Sherlock had been right, he was an idiot. He'd been so stupid, thinking they'd have all the time in the world, that it would always be Watson and Holmes. But here he was alone. He should have seen it coming, should have known something was wrong when Sherlock refused to see Mrs Hudson, but he hadn't seen it, hadn't seen the ploy that Sherlock was using. All he'd felt was anger, and his hormones getting the better of him he had yelled at him. He had called him a machine. John sobbed. God, he was an awful human being, he had insulted the one person he loved the most in this world, all because he couldn’t control his temper. And now he was gone, he couldn’t apologise for those words he had said, because he was never coming back. Those cruel words haunting John every moment of every day.
"I will endeavour to try my best John. I will leave you to your reunion with Sherlock. Do try not to knock his stitches too much." John blushed.
Moriarty. He would know that. Would know who was closest to Sherlock, who he cared about, and he wouldn’t hesitate in using that against him.
Until next time.
Under the long bedraggled hair Sherlock managed a small painful smile.
Mycroft sighed.
Mary stared at him as if she had never seen him before.
At Sherlock's words John broke into a dazzling smile and then pressed  a small kiss to their joint hands.
Sherlock breathed out, calming himself. John loved him. He quickly got out of the car and pulled his collar up. Shutting the door to the car he looked up at the quaint unassuming country house. It looked so… normal. At the end of the drive he spotted a movers truck, recently parked. Did that mean John was packing up to leave, to return to Baker Street? The thought excited him and he found himself walking quickly towards the front door. Taking a deep breath he softly knocked on the door.
"That's what friends are for. Mind you I can still remember Molly's reaction to finding out you and Sherlock were married and you were pregnant. I've never seen her so angry."
John finally learn to observe, not just see.
"I couldn't bare it to see you hurt, as Moriarty put it, you're my heart. If anything happened to you, I wouldn't have been able to carry on John. I realise that you were hurt anyway, my leaving hurt you worse than anything. You left Baker Street because you didn't feel safe, and you couldn't trust Mycroft. Then Moran came after you anyway, even when he thought I was dead. He broke script." John rolled over so he was facing Sherlock and their eyes met.
Sherlock chuckled, before gasping out in pain. The pain in his chest that he had been ignoring was making itself known. Sherlock watched as John let go of his hand to press the call button. Seconds later a nurse appeared, giving John a gentle smile  before starting to question Sherlock.
'It was all a lie Mary, the engagement,the wedding, everything. I didn't love you, I hated you. Everything about you disgusts me.' He watched as her face went from shock to anger and then smoothed out. Emotionless.
Greg looked at him dumbstruck.
A soft knock on the door made his heart stop.
"I asked them to meet me at Baker Street after we had sorted the surveillance issue out. I explained everything to them, and Molly helped to confirm that Sherlock was in fact alive. Although she was pretty angry on my behalf because of course, she didn't know me and Sherlock were married and obviously pregnant. I think my marriage was the one thing that Greg didn't find shocking. Apparently there's a big bet that he's going to win when we eventually go public. Once they were both fully informed I had their help leaving Baker Street, I needed somewhere safe where no-one could find me, not even you Mycroft. I needed to protect my children, their everything to me."
"You're the best thing for him as well John, I've seen it. He's a changed person since meeting you. Before Greg I would have said that love was your greatest weakness, but now I see that it is also your greatest strength. Without your love, neither of you would be where we are today." John smiled taking everything Mycroft had said in. He was glad that his brother in law appreciated how much he loved Sherlock.
Sherlock had not wanted him to move, had kept him in a certain position. But why? What was so important that he didn’t move, it was like he was directing his actions for a purpose. But what purpose? He rifled through the next crime scene photos and saw his answer. By standing where he was the ambulance station was between him and St Bart’s. But why would that matter, why would having him so far away matter?
"That's the point, I don't look dangerous, but I am a soldier. People forget that, they just see the Doctor part. That was Moran's mistake," he said darkly.
John sighed and ruffled his hair with his free hand.
"I've had two years to adjust, to think about what I was going to do when I saw you again, so no, I'm not mad. I love you and missed you too much to be mad at you." He gave Sherlock a small kiss on the lips.
‘I do,’ he said flatly. ‘I would never have met Mary, never have married her and she would never have tried to kill Sherlock. The whole bloody world would have kept on spinning without me in it just fine.' Silence once again reigned in the room until Sherlock's croaked voice startled him.
Why would Sherlock say their names, if he knew anything about Sherlock, he never said anything without thoroughly thinking out his words. Those words, he named his friends, the people who cared about him and the people he cared …
He wouldn’t.
‘About an eight.’ He managed to get out. The nurse nodded and reached over to change the morphine drip.
'He what, Lestrade? What did he do?' He asked, his voice wavering. Greg looked away from Sherlock. He knew Sherlock would keep pestering him until he told him. Damn. He mentally apologised to John.
John leant back in his armchair, his emotions all over the place. He was happy, and angry and extremely worried. Sherlock could be gone for months, possibly years. He might not even survive.
"Who is it?" Sherlock asked curiously. John smiled.
"The Serbian side was the last piece of the puzzle. The only one I didn't deal with was Moran, your … agent had dealt with him. I thought you'd said that he had left the country?" Mycroft shifted uncomfortably.
Greg stared at him.
Chapter 5
John glared at her. He knew Sherlock did have feelings, of course he did. He was the most human human being he knew. He didn't care if Sherlock felt the same way as he did or not. He loved Sherlock, that was never going to change. He'd take what he could get, even if that was only friendship.
"That's Dr Watson-Holmes to you," John grinned before pushing his husband onto the bed and kissing him, hands making quick work at removing the dressing gowns they were both wearing.
‘You don’t really mean that, right John, you can’t possibly think that?’ Greg asked incrediously. John sighed. This conversation was not going the way he had hoped it would. Fine, if they wanted the truth they could bloody well have the truth.
"Finally," he shouted, bouncing around like an excited five year old. John grinned, soon the twins would be overtaking Sherlock, in his mental age at least.
'So then Mary comes along, and she's perfect, you know. Beautiful, smart, funny. I should have realised, or as Sherlock would say I should have observe, not just seen, but I was so lost that I would have taken anything, done anything to not be so lonely anymore. And she took advantage of that.'
As they each came down from their high they wrapped arms around each other, revelling in the closeness of the moment, soft kisses being exchanged.
"Oh God, Sherlock. I'm close," John cried as Sherlock repeatedly pounded into him. Sherlock kissed John as he continued thrusting into John, feeling the tingling feeling in his spine that was telling him how close he was. Sherlock moved his hand in between them and started stroking John's cock in time with his thrusts. Both men were sweating now as they neared their completion.
He had lost the very person who had fixed him up the last time, and all the cracks which had been fixed had just reappeared and he had fallen apart. John hadn't been kidding when he'd talked about the booze and the drugs.
The car journey had been too long, all he wanted was to have John in his arms, to breathe him in. To tell him how sorry he was, to tell him how much he loved him, how much he missed him. The length of the journey however had left with time to analyse all the information that he had taken in from his and Mycroft's conversation, and had quickly come to one stunning conclusion. John was the MI6 agent that had killed Moran, Mycroft had said the agent's code name was 3CW – three continents Watson. With there being no files on him led to the realisation that his files must have been erased. Conclusion, John had once been in the running for a high ranking position, but something must have occurred for him to be send back to the army. He also must still have contacts in MI6 to receive the information he'd had, along with the evidence required to prove his innocence. Once again his John had surprised him. He had hoped that John would be smart enough to figure things out once he had gotten past the initial stages of shock and grief. He had worried though after reading his husbands last blog. To know that he may never have met John had scared him, and he had Mike Stamford to thank for that. He had introduced them, never knowing how much that had changed both of their lives.
He’s seen John hold Iris many ways, more ways than even that, and yet he hasn’t yet held her. John has been back at Baker Street for two days now, and while they’re comfortable with each other, it’s not like it was before. They’re treading softly, carefully, and Sherlock doesn’t know how to change it. He wants to desperately, but every time he thinks about how he can possibly make John feel more at home, his heart starts pounding and he feels lost.
“Actually, I was only going to ask if you’re ready,” Sherlock lies.
“I can appreciate the sky.” He sounds defensive and sulky, and John can’t help but smile. “But that doesn’t mean I need to waste space in my mind palace remembering such trivial details. They’re not relevant to me.”
The little girl holds out her free hand, too, feeling the rain.  “It’s never rained here before,” she says.
“The element of surprise,” Sherlock calls over his shoulder, just as they break out of the trees.
The spirits around them have stopped and turned to stare at them, suddenly seeing them for what they are due to John having taken his hand off the lantern, even if it had only been for a second.
When John wakes, he’s holding the black bandana. He smiles when he sees it and stretches out in bed, keeping it safely clutched in his hand. Redbeard gives a sympathetic stretch around his neck, then worms his way up to kiss John’s cheek. John smiles and relaxes back down onto his pillow. He holds his hand out next to his neck and waits for Redbeard to weave between his fingers, and then he drowsily holds him next to the bandana.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, coming into the living room carrying a cup of tea. John raises his eyebrows in surprise, his mouth falling open just a bit as his eyes flit from the cup and up to Sherlock’s face and back to the cup again as Sherlock presses it into his hands.
“Can’t you deduce it, John? Haven’t you learned anything by now?” She means for her words to come out sarcastic, with a defensive edge, but they are somehow tender instead, and John smiles in response, bringing one hand up to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock leans into the touch, sighs when John’s thumb strokes the pillowy softness of her lower lip.
With his thoughts as disjointed as they are, he can’t keep track of them. He doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until he suddenly exhales fast and hard, his posture breaking, and he drops his head almost unwillingly against John’s.
There’s no urgency in his voice, but something about the way he says the carefully enunciated words sounds like any alternative action would be dangerous. John’s heart is pounding in his ears and there is something about this entire situation that is making the blood in his veins sing. He feels alive and curious and somehow
Sherlock shrugs. “Babies like motion,” he says.
“So this place…where is it, exactly?” John asks.
that whimper just came out of? His hand tightens in John’s hair as something deep in his stomach clenches pleasantly, his brain on fire with the sensations of hair on his fingers and tongue against tongue and the silky insides of John’s mouth. He doesn’t know if he’s doing this right but he doesn’t
Silently, he slides out of bed, grateful for the light of the moon streaming in his window that helps him see enough to find his dressing gown. He ties it tight around his waist and silently creeps down the hallway; he mastered the art of sneaking about the house at night long ago.
“John,” Sherlock gasps when John breaks away from the kiss. John looks at him, at his flushed cheeks and wet mouth, and desire swims through his veins, makes it feel like the bottom drops out of his stomach. He shifts down and kisses the base of Sherlock’s neck, licks along his collarbone, the salty sweat of Sherlock’s skin like heaven on his tongue.
“Well, I don’t think Mary’s most people,” Sherlock says. “I think she’ll be fine.”
“You –
“Oi! John!”
“Good,” John says. “Anyway, you said you could feel everyone’s magic?”
is for John and John alone, his
Sherlock goes and grabs his coat from where it’s hung on the back of the flat door and John just shakes his head and stands in the kitchen doorway, sipping his coffee and watching as Sherlock sets Billy down for a moment to put on his coat. Sherlock takes the time to put on his scarf as well, now that autumn is beginning to feel more like winter, and John can’t help but think of what an elegant figure Sherlock makes with his long coat and blue scarf. Sherlock picks Billy up again, but instead of going out the door like a normal human being leaving for a trip, he heads past John to his bedroom, winking at John.
John’s face stretches into a soft, tender smile. “Brilliant,” he says.
Sherlock sits up and sets his pipe down on the side table before standing and crossing the room to John. He takes the grocery bags from John’s hands and sets them on the floor, then puts his hand on John’s shoulder, thumb pressing against his collarbone, and John is frozen in place, unable to move.
Sherlock freezes, staring at John, his eyes flickering over John’s face, taking in the strong set of his jaw, the laser focus of his eyes, the small flicker in his eyebrows that shows he’s nervous despite his bravery. “What –
make me happy, Sherlock,
There is a strange tension between them, born of things unsaid and too many emotions revealed. They never have tension like this, and yet John is aware of exactly how far his body is from Sherlock’s, of the fact that Sherlock’s coat is just a hair’s width away from his thigh, of the sound of Sherlock’s breathing in the silence of the cab.
“Ta, Mrs. Hudson,” John says, feeling unaccountably cheery despite the strange flat he’s in. “That would be lovely.”
“Mm,” Sherlock says, taking a sip of tea. “It’s a sensory issue; I’m overly sensitive to magic, obviously, and because of the way my mind and my own magic process external magic, it can become quite overwhelming in large quantities, and it can become very… it can be abrasive and painful in certain ways. It’s… however, it can also feel very good. It’s… difficult to explain, and few people have ever asked me to and actually cared to hear the answer, so I don’t have a lot of experience describing it.”
“On three,” John says, eyeing the coffee. He doesn’t trust that Sherlock will keep his end of the bargain.
“It’s fine. Whatever you’ve got, I’m sure I’ve been exposed to it, too, working here. How are things with Sherlock?” Mary asks, opening her lunch bag.
Gingerly, he lets his fingers drift over the violin once more, his heart picking up speed, but he doesn’t dare let them close around the familiar shape, doesn’t dare let them lift it out of its enclosure. He carefully closes the case, tenderly re-clasps it, and puts it back where it sat beside the couch.
“Brilliant,” John says again. Sherlock smiles, soft and hesitant.
John gets a job at a new surgery close to Baker Street, and when he leaves in the morning on his first day of work, Sherlock is filled with an unexpected panic that things are back to how they were when John was gone. It only goes away when he looks for clues that John was really there; he is comforted by the disturbances in the dust patterns of the second coat hook that went unused for so long, by the poorly re-folded newspaper sitting in John’s chair, by the used mug in the sink. (He has an absurd urge to dust it for fingerprints or look for skin particles left behind by John’s lips on the rim, but he resists.)
“You should be thankful for the rain,” the man says.  “Without it, where would your rivers be?”
Sherlock smiles, lacing his fingers together and leaning his chin on them. He watches John with a tilted head. “I’d say you’ve changed more than just my eating habits, John. Give yourself some credit.”
He comes back and Sherlock curls into his warmth again, already addicted to the feeling of John’s body against his, still marveling that he’s allowed to feel this, wondering if John will still want this in the days and weeks and months to come, but knowing that just this one moment is enough bliss to last him a lifetime.
“Alright,” John says, voice steeled, eyes focused on the ceiling, brow furrowed.
John sighs, resigned.  “A lovely date typically wouldn’t include you,” he says.  “But I guess a tournament is important.  I’ll text her and get dressed, shall I?”
still, and he feels desperation crawling up his throat, eager to manifest into a sob, but he swallows it down. He frantically checks for a pulse, and he takes a deep, shuddering breath when he finds one. It’s faint and slow, but it’s there. She’s breathing, slow and steady, like someone in a very deep sleep, and when he looks closely, he can see the small movement of her chest.
“You made this water?” John asks, glancing quickly at Sherlock’s face then back at the liquid, lest he accidentally spill some.
“Goodbye, John,” Sherlock says. He smiles at him, sadly, and the smoke grows closer to his face. John reaches out his hand, his fingers trembling. He steps forward once more, closing the distance between them. He’s eager to touch him, to pull him close, to save him from whatever is happening.
“Sarcasm doesn’t suit you, John,” Sherlock says.
“Mmm,” John agrees, eyes still closed, body still trembling.
John stares at Sherlock in confusion for a moment, his lips parted and his brow furrowed. “What – landline? We don’t have a landline,” he says.
“That doesn’t mean I don’t have
magic, a new and different kind of magic is born. Around them, more flowers bloom as the butterflies gently flap their twinkling wings, and in the center of it all, Sherlock realizes he’s found something more beautiful, more precious, and more magical than anything around him, and he smiles.
Okay, DON'T KILL ME!!  The next part will be up within a week, so you won't have to wait long to find out what happens next.  There will be two more parts, and then this story will be finished!
“Yeah. That’s… do you think you can… can you really fix it? Or were you just talking?”
John looks around, but there is no way out.  Other than the strange area ahead of them, they’re surrounded by nothing but grey.  He starts to feel a sense of panic that makes his senses sharpen, makes him more attuned to what’s around him.  He looks at the girl, whose shoulders are shaking, whose face is covered in snot and tears.  She’s staring up at him through wide eyes, and he realizes, with a start, that the same smell he’d noticed when he first entered this place is also coming from her.
“Shall we?” John says to Mary, extending his arm.
“Sorry,” John says. “That’s just –
Sherlock and John greet Angelo and sit at the counter.  Like last time, it smells delicious.
“Go on many dates, then?” John asks.
John shrugs. “Just eating lunch,” he says.
John gently pulls him away, sees that his mouth is beginning to twist, and wraps his arms around him, pulling him close.
“That’s why people think you’re a Squib,” John says after a moment.
John looks between Sherlock and the door, and he only pauses for a moment before he heads out, rushing down the steps. Something tells him to follow the man, even if he can’t tell him what Sherlock said.
“That bloody skull’s been
“John-”
He tastes the skin of Sherlock’s shoulder, breathes warm and humid against it when Sherlock’s arms come up to wrap around him, then shifts down to lick his nipple, swirling his tongue around it. Sherlock moans and arches his back, pressing up against John’s mouth, heel sliding up the back of John’s thigh, cock pressing insistently against John. John flicks his tongue against Sherlock’s nipple, gently bites it with his teeth. Sherlock moans again, helpless and loud, and thrusts his hips up, his hard cock jutting against John’s stomach.
“John,” Mycroft says patiently.  “What do you think Sherlock did while you were with the girl?”
Sherlock nods, blowing over the top of his tea.
“We were just chatting,” Sherlock says.
John rolls his eyes but pours his coffee, as he
They go through the door again and end up in the mysterious darkness of Sherlock’s closet. John feels relief flood over him; the cloying smell of the tunnels is rendered much stronger in its blissful absence. He’s not sure where to go, but he thinks the most fruitful way forward will probably be to think of Sherlock and find a new door.
Sherlock turns over abruptly, staring at Mycroft in accusation. “You’re the one who told me, Mycroft! When you eliminate the impossible, whatever’s left, even if it’s improbable, must be true.”
young woman, has he?”
As soon as he crosses the threshold, he’s plunged into a cold, mysterious darkness. It’s exactly like he remembers, and it threatens to pull him under for a moment, overwhelming in its intensity. He puts his hand in his pocket, though, and pulls out the handkerchief. He clutches it tightly, and the worn fabric against his skin makes him think of Sherlock. Memories come to him unbidden, pushing the darkness out of his mind.
“Enough of this,” Sherlock says, following John into his room. “We’re going to the roof, and we don’t have a lot of time.” He sets the water and urn down on John’s desk for a moment and opens the window, letting in a rush of late summer’s cool night air. It’s crisp against the warm air of John’s bedroom, and John feels his excitement for the evening begin to build.
John is still gaping, and Sherlock turns to face him completely, giving him a shrewd look that John knows means he’s deducing.
“Command the spirits,” Sherlock tells him, his voice intent.
“Oi,” the skull suddenly says. “Don’t put your fingers in my eye socket!”
John shakes his head. Another day with Sherlock.
John smiles and decides to test his luck. “Are you free tonight? Do you want to get dinner?”
he’s annoyed, but he is.
They’re breathing the same air now, the two of them, and the twisting in Sherlock’s chest is beginning to solidify, spreading into warmth. Sherlock wants more, wants John’s air and John’s thoughts and
today,” he spits. “She said no. That’s fine; you’d have been disappointed in the end. You didn't finish your curry at lunch because you spilled most of it on your lap. Your afternoon patient was –”
“He’s been like this since you left,” a voice says, and John jumps and turns toward the mantle, where the skull is resting.
Sherlock shakes his head, feeling his eyes well with tears. “I don’t want breakfast! I want John back!”
“Because I’m
There’s no response for a moment, and John is hyperaware of how close they’re standing, of his fingers against Sherlock’s skin, of Sherlock’s hands twisting in his shirt, and he holds his breath, waiting, until Sherlock nods against John’s head. John pulls away, keeping his arms around Sherlock but looking up at him. Sherlock’s pressing his lips closed, and he looks at John in something like desperation, like something is bubbling beneath his skin and clawing its way out, like he’s trying so hard to contain it but he can’t. His eyes are wide and he’s shaking. John swallows, his heart pounding, and rubs his thumb along Sherlock’s jaw.
- there’s no way you could have lost against Moriarty; it would have defied the magic of the wishes. Our fate has been sealed since long before you were born, and now, we’re here, finally. It’s brilliant, isn’t it? I couldn’t see it all until after we spoke on the roof – or the astral version of it, anyway, but now that I can see it, it’s just so
“Done any experiments lately?” Uncle Augustus asks him fondly.
John rolls his eyes. “Right, that’s why you don’t have to do all this, making breakfast and bringing me tea and all. You haven’t even left any body parts in the fridge.”
like when you were a kid?” John asks. He looks genuinely eager to know the answer.
Sherlock hastily swallows his mouthful of meringue and lets Mummy turn him around, and dutifully holds his arms out to the sides as she aggressively rubs the dust and flour, souvenirs from his little hiding spot, off his back.
“Don’t worry, you don't have to hide it from me,” Angelo insists with a waggle of his eyebrows.  His big, bushy tail twitches behind him.  Sherlock says nothing, and John’s shoulders slump in resignation.
John shakes his head again, mind turning over Sherlock’s words. “I’m making some bloody tea,” he grumbles, heading to the kitchen.
Sherlock leaves off burping her for a moment to write a quick, one-handed response to john.
“I’ll just be a minute before I start,” Sherlock says, voice quiet. “Just lie still.”
“Sherlock, hang on, I didn’t mean –”
“How do we get home?” John asks, once he has recovered enough to speak.
John stares for a moment. He has the distinct feeling that he’s missed something important. He’s having a paradigm shift, of sorts, only he can’t be sure exactly what it is that he’s come to realize. All he knows is that something in his heart is aching.
“It was easy,” Sherlock says with a shrug. “Its magic was very strong, as was the concealment magic.”
“He likes you,” Sherlock says. His voice is softer than usual, and he’s staring at the creature with rapt attention.
John’s jaw drops.  “That’s not mischief.”
“I know,” John says, his voice rough and breathless, then kisses the bases of his cock again.  “Want it to be good for you.”
“And you’re John Watson,” Greg continues, cautiously lowering his arms. His eyes are focused intently on John, but there’s a smile on his face, and he shakes his head. “Never thought I’d see the day Sherlock would be anything but alone.”
The next day, Sherlock starts playing almost as soon as John leaves for work. He’s eager to get back to his violin; he remembers how close he felt to his normal playing the day before, and he feels a tentative hope he can get back to where he used to be. He tunes quickly, then goes right into long tones and scales. By the time he gets through his scales, his sound feels more effortless than it has in ages, and while it’s not yet back to where it once was, he thinks there is a high chance that if he plays for long enough, he’ll find his way back.
“Say hello to Redbeard, then,” Mycroft says with a smile, just as they get to the door.
Molly smiles. “Would you like some tea?”
Sherlock nods, eyes flickering over John and the little animals he’s made that won’t leave him alone.
“Oh,” Sherlock says. “Yes, obviously I know him. Are you coming?”
“Okay,” Sherlock says quietly, holding the nutcracker close to his chest, letting Mummy hold him against her for a moment longer. “Thank you, Uncle Augustus,” he adds, voice nearly a whisper.
“Sit here,” Mycroft says, pushing John down into his armchair. John closes his eyes and attempts to breathe while Mycroft goes down the hall. He tries to calm down, but his brain is spinning in circles and it’s all he can do to just focus on breathing – in and out, in and out, in and out. He looks up when he hears someone clear his throat, and Mycroft is standing in front of him, holding his hand out towards John. Redbeard is wrapped around Mycroft’s fingers, squeaking frantically, alive and whole and well.
“Get lots of rest,” Arthur says. He’s watching John with a frown, his brow furrowed. He looks extremely worried.
“Sherlock!” John says frantically, stepping closer, panic crawling over his skin.
Yet he could say nothing.  He’d had no time to say what he had wanted to say. Even if he had tried, the roar of the helicopter, the megaphones, the horror, and his pulse pounding in his ears would have drowned him out. The words were lodged deep in his heart, and so he spoke easier words instead.  The words he’d wanted to say were nothing but the painful core at the center of his unraveling universe; a rock of emotion deep in his body wrapped up in memories of sentiment he hadn’t let himself think of since he was a child.  He had choked them down and turned to face the lights of the helicopters, thinking only of John, and hoping more than he’d ever hoped before that John could finally be safe.
“Terrible,” Billy says and laughs.
, that his cock is pressed up against his stomach, that he is trembling.

Thanks for reading!  And big thanks to
“No worries,” Greg says, watching him fondly. “Say hello to Sherlock.”
“Right,” John says. “Let’s go.”
“I might be a bit mad,” John says as he refills his own glass, “But it’s a bit scary that you’ll fix my leg, if I’m honest.”
come with me once we’ve reached the other side. I may not be one of you, but I walk among you. You’ve been with me my entire life, only I’ve been too stupid to realize how important you are.”
Mycroft gives a tight smile.  “As you wish,” he says.  “Don’t think I won’t know the outcome of this little tiff anyway.  Good luck, then.”
There was a time when the secret room in Sherlock’s flat on Baker Street was full of beautiful plants. One or two were not-exactly-legal, but they were hidden amongst the splendor of all the others. Slowly, though, the not-exactly-legal plants began to overtake the others until only the most illicit plants remained; ingredients for dark potions, mind-altering magical plants, individual strains of those magical plants Sherlock had come up with himself, and a few other quite illegal specimens of magical flora. Now, though, everything has died.
, but he can’t bear for John to see him like this.
“Apologize,” John adds, wondering when he became so protective of the stupid skull.
Again, he wants to look away, but he won’t do that to John. He
“You must be hungry,” Sherlock says a moment later, leaning into John’s fingers in his hair.
John frowns. “I thought about why I wanted to find you,” he says.
He’s only bought beautiful plants this time, some of which he needs for potions, but some of which he just likes. He remembers when he was small, before he turned eleven and didn’t get a Hogwarts letter, before everyone knew the truth of his magic, how when it was just him, alone in his room, he’d play and decorate his room with magical flowers and lights, how he’d go outside and the magical creatures would come to him without prompting, how he had such an affinity for magic that even the creatures noticed and responded, how he loved magic more than anything. His heart aches, but it isn’t unpleasant.
Sherlock narrows his eyes in annoyance. “I’m not
makes his head throb, the cloying and disgusting smell of malicious and infectious curses lingers in his nose to the point that he wonders if it’s going to bleed, the magic of the lift itself is bright and distracting. His head is pounding, and he can only think of getting to John.
When the lantern is full, they’re both still giggling. “We shouldn’t be laughing here,” John whispers, their heads still close together, but that only makes Sherlock laugh more, and John can’t stop,
He feels panic wash over him; he’d been staring at John like a fool, and he doesn’t understand the way John was looking at him, and he has an urge to flee, to hide away, but John suddenly appears in the kitchen doorway, and Sherlock looks up at him, feeling caught out, though he’s not sure at what.
grown up,” Sherlock protests, looking at Mycroft in annoyance.
“You’re brilliant,” John murmurs again. Oddly, Sherlock feels his shoulders shake, feels something he refuses to call a sob rise in his throat. Shame trickles over him, but one of John’s hands comes up to weave into his hair, fingers warm and gentle. “It’s alright,” John says. “It’s all done. You were – you were incredible, Sherlock. Thank you. It’s alright.”
John pushes past her and heads up the stairs, pulling the door to Sherlock’s flat open without knocking.
“This again?” Mycroft complains. “If you think I’m boring, that’s fine, but I’m getting an education and preparing to enter society. That’s
“Data?” John asks, jaw falling open a little bit. “
“Keep holding on tight, Sherlock, just like that. We’re going to apparate, alright?”
John considers the fact that Sherlock has a demon who governs the rain as a ‘sort of older brother figure’ and that he also considers him his archenemy.  He gives Sherlock a long, assessing look, but Sherlock fidgets and pulls down two teacups from the shelf.
“You –
Sherlock shakes his head. “No,” he says. “I can’t. It’s yours.”
“Oh, I’m glad, dear,” Mrs. Hudson says, patting his shoulder.
The danger of caring, he thinks, is that it can set his mind into these unbearable loops, worrying and obsessing over things outside the realm of black and white fact, things over which he has no control. It’s torture, a sweet kind of torture that burns in his chest.
Sherlock smiles at him for a moment, and then reaches down for the tote bag, long forgotten.  He picks it up and pulls Billy out, holding him in front of his face.  “Thank you for helping John,” Sherlock says, his voice surprisingly earnest.
He doesn’t know why it feels this way; he just knows that something is happening he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t know why Sherlock was apologizing, or why Sherlock is behaving so strangely. There’s so much he doesn’t know that it’s overwhelming.
They stay that way until Sherlock feels like his heart has stopped racing. He’s not sure how long it’s been, but he knows it’s been a while. He blinks a few times and is startled to realize his face is wet. John strokes his hair, holds him close.
She glances at John for a moment, then nods at Sherlock. “Alright. That’s an interesting skull you have. Did you get that at the Halloween shop?”
Sherlock grins. “Come on, we have important business to attend to.”
“Nobody else could detect the enchantments,” John said. “Bloody airtight, they were.”
“No,” John says, smiling. “I don’t need to.”
Sherlock stares at John, cutting off the alternate reality flooding his mind, and tries to search for the right thing to say in this situation. “I’m sorry,” he says, and even
“Oh, shut up,” Sherlock says.
“Of course I have,” Sherlock interrupts. “I’ve just deduced the deterioration of your relationship, haven’t I?” Something is twisting in his chest, something that says his brain is not working with him on this one, and he doesn’t know how to solve it.
“I’ll be back,” John says.  He stands and shoves his hands in his pockets, making his way towards a small drinking fountain.  Frustration is welling up inside him; the day is not working in his favor so far, and he wants to see Mary, give her the cupcake he’d worked so hard to make, and have a nice day with her.  Instead, he’s in the park where he’d nearly died with Sherlock and Billy.  It’s not exactly how he’d planned for the day to go, but he takes a sip of water and tells himself things happen for a reason as he straightens and takes a moment to calm himself.
“John, please,” Sherlock says. His voice is soft and he feels as if he’s under a spell. He’s not sure exactly what he’s begging for.
“I thought of you every day while I was gone, John, and all I could think of was how happy you’d be when I came home to you, but you moved on, and it was foolish of me to ever think it would be any different. I knew we could never go back to how we were, and Mary made you happy in ways I couldn’t, so I did what I could for the two of you, but I was wrong again; I should’ve seen Mary for what she was, and I didn’t because I wanted so much for you to be happy.” He ignores the way John tenses at the topic of conversation because he needs to keep going; this may be his last chance, after all.
Sherlock shakes his head. “She’s here somewhere, since she lives in this world, but I don’t think she’s
“Is it alright?” Sherlock asks, hoping anxiety doesn't bleed into his voice.
This time is different, though, because deep down, he knows that the reasons he stopped playing are entirely due to sentiment. While he’s long since stopped pretending he has no emotions, that doesn’t mean he’s entirely comfortable with their repercussions.
Greg looks serious now, and John wonders if he, too, harbors some ill will towards Mary even though he’s never met her. “I’m sure Sherlock had his reasons for you not to be there with her,” Greg says thoughtfully. “Even
“Move, John,” Sherlock says. His eyes are trained on Arthur, and his voice books no room for argument. There is an aura of power around him that John usually loves to see, but this time is different.
“Yes, of course. Everything requires payment, John. I’ve told you this. There’s a delicate balance that must be maintained. Now your work here will not only cover the granting of your wish, but also today’s services.”
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. “Not on your pension. But as I’ve told you, money is boring.”
And then they jump, and as soon as he feels his feet hit the water, he’s gone.
John is in his bathrobe, his hair wet from the shower, holding a towel in one hand. He’s looking at Sherlock with a warm smile, his eyes crinkling in the corners, sending lines of contentment to sprawl across his temples. He’d cleared his throat for Sherlock’s attention, and now he just looks at Sherlock, who can only stare back in uncomfortable awareness of the softness of the set of his eyebrows, the gleam of emotion in his eyes, the way his mouth is parted, all because of Iris. He does his best to reel it back in, and John’s smile widens as his eyes soften, and Sherlock’s stomach clenches, though it’s not uncomfortable. He feels like he’s in the middle of falling from the roof of St. Bart’s.
“Sherlock?” John murmurs, and when Sherlock turns and John’s hand falls away, John’s wearing that amused, soft smile again. It almost makes up for the lack of warmth along Sherlock’s spine where John’s fingers just pressed.
“Okay,” John says, batting Sherlock’s hands away. “Right. But I need coffee first.”
Sherlock smiles and takes a long drag of his pipe. He lets it out slowly before answering, and John can’t stop staring.   “Don’t be an idiot,” Sherlock finally says. “Of course not. Do
? Then why would you come?” Arthur sounds anguished, his hands tight on John’s arm.
“Yes, I have,” John replies, the seriousness of his situation settling over him once again. He pauses and tries to make himself look as reassuring as he can, knowing that her reactions tend to be strange and unpredictable. “You’ve been a huge help. Could I ask you for one more favor?”
“More,” Sherlock says, his hips jerking up to find John’s.  He shifts until he can curl his leg around John’s waist, then gasps at the friction.
“But of course it is,” John says. “You’re quite brilliant, you know.”
Sherlock looks unrepentant.  “It was quite good,” he says.  “Did you make it?”
“Right, mind telling me what that was all about?” John finally asks, turning towards Sherlock, who appears unconcerned.
“Yeah, what’s the big deal? Is that supposed to alarm me?” John asks, getting frustrated.
“John,” Sherlock finally says after a moment. John looks up and his jaw is tense and he looks ragged and anxious. “Maybe it would help to put her in the pram and go for a walk?”
“You’re mad, aren’t you,” John says as a response.  He doesn’t mean to, especially not with Mycroft walking behind them, but he stays close to Sherlock.  There’s a strange feeling in here, an ominous cold that makes John feel like if he strays off the path, legions and legions of spirits will take him in.  He doesn’t like it.
He swallows, his own lips twisting just a bit, sweat breaking out on his brow.  He doesn't know what to do.
When he had been standing outside Appledore, lights flashing around him and his hands raised in surrender, he had known very well that he’d just done something even
, the wish granter of all the worlds. For that reason, you can’t see my shop, and of course, can’t enter it. You have no need for it because at present, every single one of your wishes goes back to the core of your being, which is unchangeable, as you know.”
His eyes suddenly fly open and he holds himself perfectly still when he hears a thunking sound coming from a room nearby. He’d call it the living room, but he can’t be sure this is actually Sherlock’s room, can’t be sure that he’s actually in 221B, not after the bizarre things that have happened to him over the past few days, and not after he’d been so sure 221B had disappeared.
John sputters, almost choking on his mouthful of kung po chicken. “What?”
John smiles at him, his heart skipping beat at the sight of this annoying man living and breathing and whole.
Mycroft shakes his head.  “Today, I witnessed something I have never witnessed in the duration of my relationship with Sherlock,” he says.  “Sherlock asked me for help.”
Again, Sherlock shrugs.  “Obviously, I can,” he says.  “I just did.”
Sherlock is agitated. He’s pacing the living room, occasionally waving a hand and sending books to the floor or the wall, and there’s broken glass in the kitchen that’s most certainly his fault, and wasn’t an accident.
Mrs. Hudson smiles, but it’s sad. “Oh, no dear, I couldn’t,” she says.
“Er, Sherlock?” John says, following him down the alley and crouching down across from him.
The man frowns. He doesn’t seem to know what to make of Sherlock’s words, and neither does John. “If I figure it out, will my hand get better?”
Sherlock shakes his head, his lips trembling. John can’t stand to see it, he
“Did you just cast something?” John asks abruptly.
“He’s not here, then?” John asks him. Redbeard nuzzles against John’s side, worming his way between John’s arm and ribs, making a soft huffing sound. John brings his hand up and strokes Redbeard’s head, grateful to have him there.
“I can help you,” the woman says.  She smiles at him, and he’s torn between helplessness and distrust of this woman who quite literally stole Sherlock’s soul – though to be fair, she seems to have done it accidentally.
“No,” John says. “I didn’t. I didn’t realize it wasn’t normal to see the things I saw until I’d already mentioned them to enough people for everyone to think I was mad. Nobody wants to be friends with the kid who says there’s an old lady with her head cut off on the swing set.”
John nods, determination clear in the tense set of his shoulders and grim line of his jaw. “Yes,” he says, “and I
, saying there must be something wrong, so he stops talking about it, but at night, he holds the little crown in his hands, and remembers what it was like to have his very own friend.
Sherlock stops talking because John is suddenly clutching his arm. He looks away and closes his eyes, breathes, fights the nausea he feels when he thinks of the words he just spoke, and turns back. John is staring at him, and Sherlock’s heart is still pounding.
“Jesus, Sherlock!  What are you doing here?” he manages to ask, blinking rapidly.
“Will that ring help him?”
“Tea?” John asks, as if Sherlock’s world had not just shifted dramatically.
His heart starts beating fast and frantic in his chest and he looks around in alarm when he sees that there are mice coming out from the floorboards, and he feels himself start to tremble when he notices that he is only a tiny bit bigger than them, but suddenly, his nutcracker sits up all on his own. He holds his sword and grins at Sherlock with his strange painted-on mouth and expressionless eyes, and Sherlock’s eyes widen in disbelief.
,” eh says. “My soil experiment is important.”
“No,” John replies, shaking his head. “I haven’t even meant to come in here,” he says. “I’ll just go.”
can’t bring me back, of course, and there are very few people in this world that could. Fortunately, your wish is very strong and very clever.”
She shakes her head and her eyes fill with tears. “I don’t want you to die,” she tells him.
Sherlock stops moving. His hands go still around a bag of bread. There’s silence between them; the inappropriately fast-moving Baroque music coming from the living room seems deafening. “John, I’m not a considerate man,” Sherlock finally says. His voice is low.
Sherlock wakes with the warmth of John’s skin beneath him. He becomes aware of his surroundings slowly, feeling relaxed and content in a way he never has. John’s fingers are drifting through his hair, and John’s chest rises and falls soothingly beneath his cheek. His arm is tucked around John’s waist, and he can’t help it; he trails his fingers up and down John’s side, unable to keep himself from trying to feel more skin.
John freezes and realizes that he’d failed to notice what Sherlock obviously had not: he’s not had a single indicator that any of these spirits are evil. His palms are sweating, and his heart rate is fast, but that’s a normal sign of nerves, not necessarily of a mal-intentioned spirit.
“You wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t,” she says, looking up at him with big eyes.
Sherlock has seen John hold Iris with two arms, cradling her in the traditional way parents seem to hold newborns, her soft head carefully supported by the crook of his elbow. He’s seen him hold her this same way but with only one arm, propped against a pillow, the other carefully holding a bottle to her lips as she gulps down formula and blinks up at him. He’s seen John hold her in a more upright position, her head tucked next to John’s neck, stomach pressed against John’s chest, as he burps her or soothes her when she’s crying. That’s Sherlock’s favorite way, he thinks, because he imagines she’s smelling John, learning his scent, imprinting him as her most dear person. Sometimes he catches himself thinking foolishly wistful thoughts when he sees John holding her that way, and he tends to stop watching, turning instead to his phone or his computer.
John mulls this over for a moment. “Even though I’ve seen him grant wishes and do magic loads of times, I still don't understand how it works,” he says.
He does his best to push down the rush of emotions, but when he sees the off-center doorknocker and feels the familiar doorknob under his hand, he finds himself swallowing hard, his hands shaking. He’d thought he’d never see it again; he’d thought he was flying to his death.
“Remind me never to drink with you again. Your hangover moaning isn’t worth it,” John says, though he has to admit, it had been nice to drink with Sherlock, to see a more mellow and relaxed side of him. Sherlock intrigues John; he is mercurial, and it seems that just when John thinks he has a handle on exactly what Sherlock is like, Sherlock shows him something new.
Mary smiles and walks past him, accidentally brushing his shoulder with hers on her way. “You’ve got a patient in ten minutes! Best be ready!” she calls over her shoulder as she heads out of the break room, leaving John alone. He watches her go with a smile, rotating his shoulder once more. She really is quite lovely, he thinks.
“But you still have a bad habit,” Sherlock says, setting his tea cup down and leaning forward, steepling his fingers in front of his chin. “How old are you?”
“Anyway,” Sherlock interrupts pointedly before John can finish. “I’m not telling you where we’re going because I’d rather you experience it than listen to an explanation. I’m well aware you have the mental capacity to understand its description, but it’s a place and an experience to which words cannot do justice.” He pushes himself off the doorjamb and goes back into the kitchen, walking with a stiff posture that John knows means he’s irritated, but John’s not really bothered by that, not when he’s so irritated himself.
“Ooh, I’d be careful if I were you, Sherlock, he seems a bit worked up,” Billy warns, and John turns to glare at him again as Sherlock merely smiles.
Sherlock doesn’t move. He stares at John, and then gently, so gently, he swipes his thumb back and forth over John’s hand. “Alright,” he says. His voice is soft and warm. “I will.”
