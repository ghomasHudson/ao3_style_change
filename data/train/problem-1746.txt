The psychologist lowered his eyes and scanned his notes, made an affirmative sound, and looked up again. "Abigail Thomas. She was Mr Trevor's flatmate, wasn't she? Do you have feelings of guilt associated with her death?"
Sherlock started, not having heard anyone coming. Victor peered around the tree trunk and grinned cheekily. Sherlock would have loved to lash out, wipe the smirk from his face, and make Walters see how stupid it was to fall in with someone like
When Sherlock intertwines his fingers and raises his arms over his head to stretch extensively, his T-shirt slips up past his belly button. John's gaze sinks of its own volition, focused on the bared, creamy white skin. Saliva collects in his mouth and he averts his gaze in confusion, feeling the heat that creeps into his cheeks.
John expelled a stuttered breath, increasing the pressure on Sherlock's lower back to bring his omega closer and deepen their kiss again. He ran his other hand down over the thin material of Sherlock's pyjama trousers and pulled Sherlock's thigh up over his hip.
, John."
"And what if it isn't?" Sherlock interrupted, his eyes flashing angrily at Mike. He shifted his weight impatiently from one leg to the other and pointed an accusing finger at the physician. "It's just as unlikely that everyone is following the new rules, or that every abused omega has the strength to stand up for themselves! The alphas who have always treated omegas like slaves or possessions aren't going to stop now, just because a law has changed and a couple of voices of protest have become louder!"
"Well, I'm... not an expert in omega medicine, but... the blood panel does seem a little... unusual. The whole profile looks more like that of an..." John broke off and cleared his throat. He looked up at Sherlock, baffled.
Across from the sofa was an open passageway to the kitchen, in the middle of which stood a table – also covered with junk – and a single folding chair. More folded-up chairs leaned against the wall. Several articles of clothing lay randomly strewn across the floor.
"Where's Mary anyway?" he asked. Less out of any real interest than out of the need to change the subject.
John thought back uneasily to the conversation with Victor.
done that. Anyway nesting only makes sense if there's a potential for offspring – which is definitely not the case with us."
"Yeah, sorry. It's just... this isn't easy for me, all right?"
Victor had no idea how to deal with the forced silence. It made him angry to be left hanging in this zero gravity field. Tossed back and forth between his emotions and what he perceived. Because this 'relationship' – if one had the courage to call it that – with Sherlock was ideal. No strings, no rules. But the thought that it was all just a game, a warm-up for the man Sherlock was actually interested in not embarrassing himself with, gnawed constantly at Victor's gut.
"Yeah, of course."
Sherlock stood with his back to John. His head lowered, he grasped the countertop as hard as he could, his breaths coming in stuttering gasps. The scent was much stronger here, and multiplied John's arousal exponentially. His mouth filled with the familiar taste of honey when he ran his tongue across his lips. Still, he needed to be sure.
"Everything all right?" John asked.
"Show me," Victor said in a gruff voice and pushed into Ryan's willing mouth.
"Despite my efforts, a shot went off as we fell and hit me. The impact with the water did the rest. Multiple fractures, contusions, and respiratory distress. Mycroft's people pulled Moriarty and me out of the water, but I was already unconscious by then. I was put into an artificial coma and didn't wake up until a good seven weeks later."
When the door to Victor's adjacent bedroom opened, he turned onto his side again to hide the bump in the blanket.
Many thanks to
The fear he clearly hears in his voice stabs through John’s heart. The thought of Sherlock wanting him all this time while he had believed it impossible is another painful stab. How unnecessary all this uncertainty and worry has been in retrospect, it’s laughable. And yet, it was an important part of the whole process that ultimately brought them together.
"'s alright," John replies, putting Sherlock's hand back against his head. He shifts his weight a bit more to his thighs so he doesn't have to rest on his forearm, then fumbles with his sweatpants, tugging at them impatiently to free his own erection. But he needs both hands to pull enough of it out to remain over the waistband of his underwear. Taking advantage of the brief respite, John spits in his hand and rubs the extra moisture over his shaft. John makes a guttural sigh against Sherlock's skin, then puts his lips over the swollen glans again to specifically stimulates it. The added arousal that shoots through his own body spurs John to work his lips and tongue faster over Sherlock's penis.
The others joined in the happy clamour and welcomed Peter as well. John rolled his eyes in annoyance. The team spirit simply didn't want to ignite in him. It took a concerted effort for him to force a small smile onto his lips when Peter looked over and gave John a friendly nod.
"No! Please..."
In the meantime, Sherlock put on a pair of latex gloves, took out his retractable magnifier, and circled the body. He examined it from head to toe, trying to make out whether there were any differences in the shape or depth of the incisions in comparison to the other victims. He made one final round of the dead alpha, meticulously feeling for other trace evidence at various spots on the body.
Shapes peeled away from the shadows, faintly illuminated by violet light. Barely enough to make out an entire person. A mosaic of curves and angles. Jaw, collarbone, bicep. Bare skin.
"Wait a second," Victor ordered and moved away from Sherlock to go over to one of the bags they'd moved into the room along with the boxes. He pulled open the zip and drew out a dark blue blanket that he tossed temporarily over the bare mattress and tugged it straight. Without wasting any more time, he grabbed Sherlock's wrist and pulled him in close, kissing him again and pushing him onto the bed.
Distracted by the image, it took Sherlock a second to shake his head. "Unlikely. The killer will be long gone by now. Well then, see you later..." he said, opened the door to the flat, and hurried out.
John was starting to feel a little light-headed from all of the crowds of people. Now and then, he fancied he saw a familiar face flash by, only to have it disappear a moment later. It wasn't until a scrawny figure came towards them with purposeful steps that his body reacted instinctively. The sense of approaching danger sent adrenaline shooting through his veins. Alarmed, he clenched his hands into fists, but just then a heavy-set man bumped into John from behind, knocking him off-balance for a moment. John whirled around to lay eyes on his potential attacker, but he'd already caught up to Victor, who was taken completely off-guard.
Sherlock pulled his shirt back on without turning around to Mike, and hastily buttoned it up. He felt shame heating his cheeks, but shook his head and slid off the exam table.
The air in the glass coffin was already hot and stale. The heavy aroma of the white roses did its part to further cloud his mind. Sweat ran down his face, catching on his eyelashes and dripping off his chin. The rational voice in the back of his mind tried to calm him down and remind him that an increase in muscle tension would only use up oxygen faster and rapidly reduce his chances of survival.
Of course, Bill knew just as well as John that that wasn't the case. Still, ever since the artificial insemination from an anonymous donor had been successful and she and Cilia were expecting their first child, Bill seemed more convinced than ever of the merits of a traditional alpha-omega partnership.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip and shook his head hard. He swallowed over the lump in his throat and struggled against the undesired emotions that were bubbling up inside him, slowly but surely.
"Well, whatever it was, we haven't got time to discuss it now," John cut Sherlock off again and extricated himself from their embrace. "The train leaves in an hour. I hope you've packed?"
The last few rays of the setting sun fractured in the broken window glass, bouncing off the sharp edges and catching on the dust particles dancing across the room.
That evening, home from work and alone in his room, John disconsolately rotated the small bottle of cologne in his hand, pulled out the stopper, and took a whiff. When he concentrated hard, he could smell something bitter in the background, almost completely hidden underneath the fresh top note. It made his nose tingle in an unpleasant way. Now that he'd discovered it, he couldn't ignore the pungent odour any more. He growled and pushed the stopper back into the delicate neck of the bottle, then tossed the cologne into the bin without further ado.
with John, although relationships are
"I love you too."
Sherlock put an end to that train of thought and tried to control the anger coiling in his gut. He felt John regarding him with a contemplative look, but refused to meet his eyes.
John was fully aware of the irony of the situation. The omega who had fought his biology all his life now wished for a regular cycle and was looking forward eagerly to his next heat.
"Maybe that's exactly what you should do."
This chapter got longer than originally planned (erm... as usual...), so I've split it into two parts. ;)
were incredible."
The safe house stood at the end of the lane, isolated up on the hill. Behind it, snow-covered fir trees towered against the dark, starless sky. The house's facade was made of rough-hewn stone and brown shingles. The curtains were drawn across the few windows. There was just a hint of light behind one, nothing more than would come from a small table lamp. There were no sounds at all.
All of a sudden, the lion's share of his tension fell away, and John tucked into his tiramisu with renewed gusto, encouraging Angelo to go ahead and share more anecdotes about those early days. He caught sight of Sherlock's surprised expression out of the corner of his eye and even fancied he could detect something like acknowledgement in his body language. The stale odour was replaced by something soft and airy. Relief and... hope?
When John left the surgery early that evening, he decided to buy a few groceries and pop in at the cleaners'. Knowing his omega, Sherlock still hadn't got round to picking up his beloved Belstaff, despite grimacing every time he had to put on a jacket instead of the coat.
Sherlock pushed the door open and marched up to the desk, slapped his hands down on the desktop, and roared at his brother:
"Have you been able to talk to anyone yet?"
If Sherlock had had complete freedom, he could have finished all of the research within a single week. The other students would just slow him down and in the worst case, fake the results. What was the point of giving assignments like that to a group? The others in the course were obviously idiots who didn't have the first idea about chemistry and would need to study the basics first. Sherlock couldn't understand why he had to take an introductory course anyway. Ridiculous bureaucracy.
"Give it some more time, Sherlock."
"Morning. Tea?" John asked automatically, already preparing to pour some of the brew into two cups.
"Not yet," Sherlock hissed just as quietly.
It was true that John had seemed enthusiastic at the prospect of a renewal. But he'd also made it clear that the decision came down to Sherlock in the end. Would he be angry if Sherlock changed his mind now?
"Unbutton your shirt," Victor whispered, his voice dark with lust. Despite the trace of uncertainty in Sherlock's eyes, he did as he was told and started to release the small plastic buttons at his collar. His fingers trembled – and not from the cold, Victor was pleased to note. Once the shirt was open, Victor ran his free hand across the bare skin, caressing a hard nipple with his thumb, then over the angled collarbone and up Sherlock's neck to rub his quivering bottom lip. Sherlock's tongue darted out, moistening Victor's thumb, only to promptly disappear again as if it had done something naughty. The corners of Victor's mouth twitched in amusement.
John observes the retreat and frowns.
"Sherlock's, I'm –"
"Yeah..."
Aside from that, even if in his naivety he'd once envisioned himself in a healthy partnership with Sherlock, these days he wanted nothing more than to wring the vain omega's neck. He didn't even want Sherlock anymore. And he wanted even less to latch on like a parasite in Sherlock's flat. He needed another alternative in the long term.
Mike shook his head with a small smile. "Not a word – and yes, he's always like that. Come on, Molly, let's leave the two of them alone so they can get to know each other better." He tugged the woman with him as he headed toward the door; she cast a cowed look in John's direction and a wistful one toward Sherlock on her way out.
John might have expected several different reactions, but least of all the hearty outburst of laughter that erupted from Sherlock. John turned around, nonplussed, to look at his omega. He was standing in the middle of the room, shaking his head at John.
John harshly cut off his babbling. "It really doesn't interest me in the slightest what you need, Sherlock."
without the seven dwarves from olden tales
"Are these for me? Thank you!" He took the entire platter out of her hands and into the kitchen, put water on to boil, then waited for the tea to steep while he casually ate two of the cookies. He told Mrs Hudson about their visit at Bill and Cilia's – leaving out the more unpleasant moments – including the fact that the other omega was close to her due date. When he reached for a fourth cookie, Mrs Hudson shook her head in reprimand.
Victor was sitting on the couch, his left elbow resting on the seat back. A cigarette was wedged between his index and middle fingers, slowly smouldering. The ash at its tip was already drooping under its own weight. Victor's inward-directed gaze came into focus the moment John came in. He rescued the ashes in the ashtray on the table and took one more drag before stubbing the cigarette out.
"This round. Was it better, seeing as the first one wasn't exactly fantastic for you?"
"Yeah..." John agreed curtly, collapsing a little more into himself. He was so terribly dizzy. His grip on the bottle tightened, as if it would help keep him upright. He drank some more of the amber-coloured liquid and wiped his mouth. He'd already drained over half of the bottle.
"No, with... feelings. So keep going. And - before you ask - yes, I've had sex before... "
Despite the flare-up of jealousy and wistfulness that John felt when he looked at the two of them, he made up his mind right then and there, heeding some gut instinct. If there was anything he could do to make these two even happier, he wanted to help.
"We've waited so long, and now... it's perfect," John whispered against his sweat-damp skin.
"No reason to make it so easy for me..."
John slowly swivelled around to face him, as if checking that Sherlock was listening, then let out a heavy sigh. "What happened back then, it... it wasn't right. And even though my first impulse is still to say that I was just trying to help, I realise now that we went too far. If it hadn't been for you... If our bond hadn't made sure that... " John shook his head regretfully. "I would have blamed myself for the rest of my life."
. "He trades his omegas, Sherlock. That means there are other alphas like him. Alphas who place no value on the lives of their omegas and treat them like…"
John had even tried sparks once himself. At university, during a short-lived liaison with a fellow student who wasn't disinclined to experimentation. They hadn't had much of an effect on him. On the contrary, the pungent solvent smell had only given him a dull headache, but otherwise not done anything for him. His flings had always assured him that the stench didn't bother them, and at some point John had stopped asking.
"Sherlock," John whispered reverently and deepened the kiss as he reached behind him with one hand, groping for something. When he'd found it, he propped himself up over Sherlock on his other arm and showed him the tube of gel. "May I?"
The taut quivering in John's shoulders slowly settled. He reached up to Sherlock's hand on his shoulder and gave it a firm squeeze, then slowly turned to face Sherlock. It looked as if he wanted to say something, but couldn't get any words out.
"Sherlock...?"
"And?"
He snorted and slammed the drawer shut, then searched under the bed. Nothing. Not even dust bunnies. He pulled back the bedspread and lifted the pillow. Nothing. When he pivoted around, his eye fell on the laundry bin in the corner next to the dresser.
"What about Archie?" Sherlock finally asked.
John automatically leaned forward and sniffed at the creamy white skin. If this man was an unbonded omega, John's hormones should already be roiling. But as hard as he tried, he couldn't make out any special scent markers.
Sherlock opened the laptop again and activated the app to locate John's phone. Only a few seconds elapsed before the programme found his signal and triangulated his likely position. Without wasting any more time, Sherlock tossed back a pill for the pain, slipped into his coat, shoes, and scarf, and left the flat.
Which had the additional effect of making him aware of the firm bulge pressing into his groin. John's breath caught. "You bloody bastard!"
Had that been what had doomed Victor and Sherlock's relationship to fail from the start? Had it triggered feelings of guilt in Sherlock? Or had Sherlock maybe even unconsciously reinforced Victor's impulse to protect him? Question upon question, none of which John would ever receive an answer to.
But Victor hadn't deigned to respond. Neither to the first message nor the next two John had sent in succession. One angry and hurt, the other resigned and apologetic. He felt both guilty and used. After all, Victor had given Kitty Riley a very in-depth interview and blurted out all kinds of stories about Sherlock that John hadn't even known.
Sherlock swallowed heavily. Of course, John wouldn't be able to sit by his bed for six weeks, but he would have been informed as soon as Sherlock was awake, wouldn't he? Unless... Sherlock's eyes darted rapidly around the room before landing firmly on his brother.
It was strange how such small, utterly meaningless things could make him happy all of a sudden.
Sighing, John took a seat by the window, crossed his arms, and leaned his head against the cool window pane, exhausted. He could not for the life of him explain what had just happened. It wasn't the first time he'd eaten at that chain of sandwich shops, so he assumed the products were all fine and the problem was with him. Not much had tasted very good lately, if he'd even got as far as trying anything. It was almost as if his body were refusing to accept nourishment in order to move on to the next plane of existence as quickly as possible.
"John, even you should realise that we cannot know the future. It would be a lie if I said that such a thing could never happen. I just don't know. Don't look at me like that, there are many things I don't know," Sherlock says, without actually looking at John's expression. They fall silent for a while. John is still leaning against Sherlock's back and he can feel the warmth and firmness of Sherlock's body, as well as the painful reality of his words.
He returned the tome on the Crimean War between 1853 and 1856 to the dark wooden bookcase and sighed. Nervous energy pumped through his veins, not allowing him to relax. He paced back and forth in front of the narrow windows covered by heavy curtains, overlooking the quiet side street. It was early afternoon already, and the sun would be going down soon. Would they still manage to fly to Switzerland today?
He was bored to death.
John set down the tray and went over to Victor, scratching the back of his head in embarrassment, and cleared his throat again. "Well... apparently there were more of those letters and Sherlock wasn't the one who sent them, but the recipient. They're from Sherrinford," he explained briefly. When he saw Victor's perplexed expression, he began to recap his most recent insights. He related what he'd found in the box, the revelatory conversation with Mycroft, and the strange similarity between the letters and Moriarty's texts, as well as the fact that he couldn't see any real link between the two.
John himself had to bite down hard on his lip in order not to thrust much harder and rougher into Sherlock's tight body. But he was enjoying the close proximity to his omega too much for that.
Sherlock took another careful sip, shuddered, and poured the contents of the cup down the drain, along with what was left in the pot. He then took the bottle out of John's hand to neutralise the taste in his mouth. If Sherlock was voluntarily drinking beer, the tea must really be undrinkable, John surmised.
Sarah extricated one hand from his grip, laid it against John's cheek, and gave him a sad look. "I hope he'll realise what he has in you one day."
"You were in your room! That's why she didn't want me to look at it, isn't it?"
The world tilted on its side, triggering a dizzy spell that threatened to pull him right back under the water. He reached for his neck in panic, only to jerk back in alarm when pain flashed through the inside of his elbow.
"You sick of being controlled by your emotions? No problem! This shit will get you through the night without you feeling anything, either from them or your alpha."
so despised.
Sara nodded, leaned forward, and brushed a feather-light kiss on his lips. "I still wish it for you. You deserve to be happy."
The young omega female held the needle out to him, offering. Sherlock took it and examined the opaque liquid inside. He hadn't told her how vividly he felt everything John did; the story of soul bonds was widespread in omega circles and had attained something of a mythological status which no halfway intelligent person could take seriously. Admitting that he was able to sense his alpha several thousand kilometres away would only be interpreted as the pain of separation – and that was definitely not what Sherlock felt.
The outer surface of his hand was red and swollen, and a protruding tile had scraped his skin, leaving a helter-skelter pattern of scratches. John shamefacedly rubbed at the injured area and waited for Sherlock to enter.
"I managed somehow. It's… Monsieur Hector was… I…"
"The same bird is stamped on it as on Sherrinford's letters, Mycroft! How in the world is it possible that he was able to smuggle John out of the building without being seen?!"
John turned away, grinding his teeth, and stared out the window of the taxi. He was seething inside, but he didn't know how to respond to Victor's statement. It was true that he and Sherlock hadn't informed Victor about the Moriarty case. But at the time, they'd been working on the basis of speculation and hadn't been able to see the larger picture yet. Moriarty had used that to his own advantage and pushed Victor toward Moran. Whether Nozzer had anything to do with it or had only ended up getting mixed up accidentally was something no one could say for certain.
He stopped speaking abruptly when Cilia's smirk of amusement shifted into genuine confusion.
"That's... that..."
John knelt over Victor, his entire body on edge, gripping his wrists and pressing them down onto the patterned red carpet. A combination of anger, pain, and desire prickled through his body, making him shiver. Victor's chest rose and fell with his heaving breaths. His face was marked by scratches and blood clung to his lips. His eyes were feverish but wary.
John frowned, bewildered, but did as he was told. Mycroft probably wanted to prevent John from contacting anyone on the outside, even if the only person who came to mind was Victor; he would have quite liked to tell him about Sherlock's return. But of course John wouldn't actually have done it.
His grumpy, withdrawn mood meant there was little of John's formerly sunny disposition left. Instead, a deep sense of melancholy had settled over him, which he numbed more and more frequently with alcohol.
"And there's nothing we can do about it," Richard added. "We're at the mercy of our biology."
"John, I…" he murmured, only to break off when John slid out of his chair, knelt down in front of him, and grasped his wrist.
Not with Sherlock. He'd persisted in trying to fit more and more of John's erection in, licking and sucking with abandon, all the while making the most delectable sounds. The whole operation had seemed to arouse the omega as much as John. When Sherlock had finally clambered onto him, he'd been so wonderfully wet and uninhibited that John had almost come right there on the spot.
A growl arose from John's throat, which he tamped down with a great application of willpower. He quickly took a sip of wine and cleared his throat loudly. The alpha in him still wanted to leap out of his chair and tear the other man away, show him his place, and ensure that he never laid a hand on his omega again. The rational side of John knew that such a territorial display was completely out of line and would never be tolerated by Sherlock.
for this awesome translation! <3
"You've spoken to my sister?" John asked, aghast. "And what call from Sherlock… oh
After all, this is Sherlock Holmes we're talking about. Who, if not him, would be able to read John's depraved thoughts and consequently kick him out in sheer outrage? John probably wouldn’t succeed in finding another affordable, well located flat in London again any time soon. He folds the rustling newspaper and gets up, peers questioningly over Sherlock's shoulder. Eyes half closed, Sherlock scratches absentmindedly at the fabric of the backrest of the couch.
Sherlock seemed to be in a similar state; he was writhing in his chair and undulating his hips. The scent of omega hung so heavily in the air now that John felt drunk on it.
Whatever it was, John couldn't – and didn't want to – put a label on it. But it was all right. He didn't feel any resentment toward Sherlock and Victor's previous relationship anymore. Or at least that's what he told himself. There wasn't anything he could change about it anyway. The Sherlock whom Victor had known differed in many ways from the one John had met and come to love. He had no doubt that the younger Sherlock would have meant just as much to him, but that was a train of thought that wasn't worth pursuing.
"How?"
"Look at me," Victor commanded, opening one button after another, slowly and carefully, without looking away for so much as a second. "Put your hands on my shoulders."
What the hell was that supposed to mean? John couldn't match the rhyme to any fairy tale either. But here at least there appeared to be an obvious mention of Mycroft. Or some Mike. Was there a connection between 'W' and Mycroft? What was Sherlock warning them about ? What had Mycroft done? If only there were a date on the letters...
John's heart clenched painfully when he saw Sherlock press his lips together and struggle with all his might to hold back the tears that formed in his eyes. He could only vaguely imagine how difficult it must have been for Sherlock to make those dreadful decisions. There was no telling what might have happened if there had been a bullet in the chamber of the revolver...
It was pouring on the day of his appointment. London was ensconced in a grey-in-grey costume of rain, umbrellas, and dreary faces. The constant rushing sound of the water drowned out all of the other sounds of the city, sweeping together weary thoughts like refuse in the gutters. Faded spots of colour that clung to sewer grates or collected in lonely corners. Cold and wet and dismal.
John shrugged. "Because I'm nervous?"
"Shh, shh…"
John shook his head. "Why should it bother me? As long as Greg consents to it, it's none of my business. I'm not going to try and tell anyone who they can love. If both partners are happy, then I am too."
The small glimmer of hope he'd had that they might put an end to this insane idea disappeared in a puff of smoke. Resigned to his fate, he followed Bill back into the guest room with a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach.
"Why should you?"
Sherlock nodded somewhat sheepishly. He hadn't wanted to talk about this, but the way things stood... "It was last summer... shortly before we left school. A fellow from my year... I don't even know that I particularly liked him. He wanted to have sex and I was curious. But I wasn't allowed to kiss him. The whole thing was rather messy and unpleasant. He'd scarcely got inside me before it was all over and I had no idea if it was always like that. Whether that's all there was. I decided that sex simply wasn't for me," Sherlock said matter-of-factly. "Until I met you."
"Consulting detective? What does that mean?"
"What?" John asked, nonplussed. "What are you talking about?"
That oddball... Tom's "friend" … had intervened, stolen the show and with it any chance of Sherlock succeeding. What did he think he was doing? Wasn't one man enough for Victor Trevor? As if it weren't hard enough to find a halfway intelligent person who piqued Sherlock's interest. A shiver ran down his spine when he recalled the friendly way Walters had looked at him a couple of days ago. Unlike Victor, Sherlock had been possessed of the decency to ask whether he could attend the lectures, even though they weren't on his programme of studies.
The sweet smile and delicate hand squeezing John's lower arm signalled that Cilia had understood him perfectly anyway.
"Molly, I need your help..."
"I could say much worse to you, you git!" John countered, giving Victor a shove in the shoulder.
Cilia looked enchanting in her floor-length silken nightdress, her hair hanging loose in soft curls tumbling down her back. On the other hand, her getup made her look so much like a maiden dressed for a ritual sacrifice that John was torn between laughing and making a break for it. In the end, he just hoped that the omega didn't see herself in that role, because he hated the thought that she might feel she was being forced into anything.
Silence fell on the room. Sherlock waited until John had reached the only possible conclusion and was attempting to process the insight. "An… an… alpha?!" he asked incredulously.
Sherlock pressed both hands over his mouth, digging his teeth into his bottom lip, and closed his eyes.
"Not today, John!"
He set the device down on the floor, took the brass key out of his pocket, and inserted it into the lock of the glass coffin, his heart beating at a hectic pace. His hands were shaking so hard that the key almost fell out of his grasp, and then didn't want to fit into the keyhole. Sherlock cursed as he tried to calm his trembling fingers.
"Sherlock..."
It had nothing to do with his mind palace, although he thought he recognised many of the images. It was as if someone had uprooted them from their accustomed positions and transported them into this empty space where a hurricane was raging. With time, Sherlock managed to catch hold of a few individual images and hold onto them for a few seconds before the storm tore them away from him again.
Victor sighed unhappily and shifted his weight from one leg to the other. "Yeah... I know what you mean. I feel the same... Listen, John, this might be weird and I'd understand if you didn't want to, but... aside from myself, you're the only one who knew Sherlock; who saw more in him than the Consulting Detective, the blabbermouth and the pain in the neck he also was... There isn't anyone else I can talk to about Sherlock. Other than you. And I don't know, but..." Victor bit his lip and his hands curled visibly into fists inside his pockets. "Shit..."
and something that, with a little imagination, might have said
"John..."
His head hurt like hell. A dull throbbing occupied every space, thrumming against his skull as if the swollen mass of his brain wanted to break out of its too-small casing.
Speechless, John stares at his friend.
"That was you, wasn't it? You somehow managed to draw John away from me. You sensed what was going to happen, and you … " She broke off, searching for words. "You put your soul bond into play. Do you have any idea how incredibly impressive that is?"
"Dadaaa!" Henry whinged, leaning away from Sherlock. He extended his little fingers toward the group, but when Sherlock looked over, it seemed as if Henry was pointing straight at John.
The outside sounds died away, and he relaxed markedly. He glanced over at the door once more, checking, then shrugged off his jeans jacket, pushed up the sleeve of his thin jumper as far as he could, and unbuckled his belt. Nervous fingers coaxed the leather through the belt loops, quickly wrapped it around his arm, and pulled it tight.
In lieu of a verbal response, Sherlock kissed John again, licking his tongue possessively and sharing the salty flavour of the pre-ejaculate fluid. He felt John's erection twitch between their bodies, and John's fingers wandered into his arse crack. Although he couldn't reach down very far from his position, the touch alone set Sherlock's nerve endings on fire. The impulses raced up his back, tingling and sparking as they went, causing him to instinctively arch his back and gravitate toward the touch.
Something tugged at the corner of Sherlock's mouth, but it disappeared again so quickly that it wasn't certain whether it had been there at all. "What am I supposed to say to that?" he said sourly and left the tiny office.
"You don't want to, do you?" John said. He propped himself up on one elbow and yawned broadly. Over the past few weeks, he'd become much more attentive to the subtle, often unintentional signals which Sherlock broadcasted.
"You're changing jobs?" John asked, surprised. "What happened to your London job? And your flat? When I last visited, things were going so well for you."
"If you hadn't done that, Moriarty's people might have caught up with us already. You did the only thing that seemed logical in that fraction of a second, Sherlock. And believe me, it's not easy for me to admit that. I was so furious that you'd left me behind. But it wasn't you I was actually angry with, it was Moriarty. He was the one who'd pushed you to that point. I just don't want... something like that to happen again. Do you understand?"
Was it because he was unaccustomed to the nicotine, or had someone spiked his drink? Either way: he felt absolutely fantastic. Like he could uproot tree trunks with his bare hands.
"I'm here because..." The rest of the sentence stuck in his throat when he felt despair inevitably win the upper hand. Tears shot into his eyes, which he struggled to hold back. He cleared his throat, averting his gaze, and tried to breathe normally.
Sherlock, who had barely slowed his movement while devouring the scene in front of him, now bent down to John and kissed him, teasing John's tongue with his. He climaxed shortly thereafter. Pushing deep into John's body, he was only partially able to hold back a groan that sounded as if it were verging on pain. He threw his head back and gasped audibly for air, lazily rotating his hips in order to enjoy the last few drops of pleasure.
, which might require a drug test. Helplessly, he clenches his left fist. He digs the mobile out of his pocket, curses at the sight of the lifeless screen and is just about to climb the stairs to his bedroom when he hears a muffled moan of pleasure. John’s stomach suddenly clenches into a tight knot. A hot wave of arousal flows through his limbs and tingles up to the very tips of his fingers. His mouth is bone dry all of a sudden.
Sherlock's right hand darted back and dug into John's thigh, not sure whether to hold him back or pull him closer. The air froze in his lungs as if he'd been slugged in the solar plexus. He was so full, stretched to the limit, barely able to perceive anything other than the indescribable sensation that seemed to permeate every fibre of his being.
"We've both been too… tense… Are you sure that you—"
The concern in John's voice broke Sherlock's heart. A warm hand touched his cheek, wiping the tears away that welled up over his lashes.
"What the hell, Victor?!" John barked once they'd climbed into the back seat and set off. "Where do you know that nutter from?"
John's face crumpled in pain as he struggled with the burning behind his eyelids. Ella waited, giving him time to calm down. They didn't get far that day. John was only able to get out in a few broken, halting words on what had happened, how he'd witnessed Sherlock's fall from the bridge. How he'd hoped and prayed that his friend would turn up again. Until the point came when he would even have been satisfied if they'd found his body, just so he could attain closure.
Should he inform John? About the possibility that it might really be some kind of soul bond? Should he risk appearing foolish? Being laughed at? Who would be served by the truth?
Victor nodded to indicate that he was aware of that. He placed one hand on John's shoulder and gave him a piercing look. "Can you wait here? I'll just have a quick word with him, and then... we can leave."
Sherlock had just finished his art therapy session, happy to have completed his last picture – a skull on a blue background – so that he could start a new project next time.
Victor folded his hands, trying to find the right words. "Whenever things get complicated, I disappear. It's always been like that. I need distance. Space. To be able to think clearly. I don't know how... Our friendship is important to me, John.
John smiled self-consciously. Cilia patted his hand again, then withdrew and directed her attention once more at Sherlock. "I was so happy he said yes, and I was certain that my wish would finally come true. But when the moment came, something inside me shut down. I wanted John to be our donor, but I didn't want to sleep with him."
"You have an idea... who might have written this letter," John stated with more conviction in his voice than he actually felt.
******
John's blood froze upon hearing those words. "How – in the world – can you still let that man into your flat, much less into your bloody bed?!"
Sherlock shook his head and tried to twist out of John's embrace, but John maintained his hold, laying one hand on Sherlock's chest to calm him and in doing so felt his heart beating wildly underneath.
"Shall we do it right here?"
That same day, John made an appointment with Ella Thompson's office. Since it was an emergency of sorts, he wouldn't have to wait long: he was given a date for the next week. John rang off with a queasy feeling in his stomach.
Victor just gave John a conspiratorial smile in lieu of a response, letting his eyes wander over the other passengers. It was already after eleven; most of the night owls had already landed at their destinations a while ago, but Victor was absolutely certain that the nightclub he wanted to visit didn't have a closing time.
"Naturally," Sherlock fibbed. "It completely obscures an omega's scent. Even during a heat, the pheromones can be minimised to such an extent that they're virtually undetectable. Not even by an alpha who has scented the omega before."
"Pastrami and avocado. A disproportionately high percentage of cases of the common cold in the afternoon. You had to disinfect your hands frequently. And you had a beer. You went to the pub. With..."
"Yeah, I know..."
"Bill..." John gasped with surprise as he tore open the envelope and withdrew a stiff card along with a letter.
"William," Sherlock said promptly. He didn't think it appropriate to give a suspected murderer his name, but he wanted to avoid being caught in a direct lie. Strictly speaking, William was the first of his three given names, even if it wasn't the one he usually went by.
"Er... is that my phone?"
"What are you talking about?" John asked, confused.
The alpha looked anything but convinced, however. "Why do you want to–?"
"Fine, but I'm not cutting any onions!"
John kicked open the half-open bedroom door with one foot, entered the room, and dropped Sherlock unceremoniously onto the bed. The springs protested loudly.
John blurted out a spluttering laugh before he was able to catch it. He hurriedly bit his lip, but he was pleased to see a teensy smile tugging at the corner of Sherlock's mouth. Hoping that the ice had thawed somewhat between them, John screwed up his courage and changed the topic.
"John, you realise I can't talk about that..."
"Imagine that's my tongue," Victor breathed out, intensifying the friction on and around Sherlock's glans, which made him whimper softly. "Or here..." This time he increased the pressure from the fingers of his other hand, pressing harder against the ring of muscle without breaching Sherlock's body. Sherlock inhaled sharply, loud enough to hear. Shivering.
Anthea returned Sherlock's angry glare with a chill that Sherlock was familiar with from his brother. She'd taken on so many of his mannerisms, had virtually become a mirror image of him, yet still couldn't manage to hold his attention. Despite their bond and the young life growing inside her.
"That... you can't know that..." Sherlock said, letting his head droop down and covering his face with one hand.
"Not many, I guess," John finally replied.
Sherlock snorted derisively and shook his head. "I don't think she and Mycroft have one. There are a lot of rumours amongst omegas in particular about soul bonds, so I'm not surprised that she's familiar with the topic. But those are all fairy tales or soppy romance novels glorifying that type of bond. It has no basis in reality," Sherlock said, although the last few words came out sounding somewhat defensive.
John exhaled the air from his lungs, relieved, as the door to the therapist's office fell shut behind him. The sun was already setting, and a brisk wind had arisen. It was still warm enough to go without a jacket, however. John checked the time on his phone and decided to get something to eat. He walked the scant few metres to the main road, turned onto it, and joined the numerous other pedestrians there.
Creamy white semen erupted in two, then three spurts onto his flat stomach, and there was nothing in the world that could have kept John in his seat. He lowered himself between Sherlock's spread legs and licked the ejaculate off his quivering skin.
Wildflower honey, summer rain, and moonlight elbowed into the forefront of his mind, causing him to break off the kiss.
"Harry! You could have died yesterday."
He groaned as he pushed open the door to the flat and dropped their luggage. Sherlock followed close on his heels, pawing through the mail from the past few days. He was unable to suppress a smirk.
"It would be my honour."
John didn't need more than two steps to close the distance and take Sherlock into his arms. "Sher—" His voice failed halfway through. Something in him seemed to crack open, veritably bursting forth, when he felt the incredible solidity of Sherlock's body against his. Relief flooded every single one of his cells, and he sighed into the dark curls.
John realised immediately that 'us' meant 'you', but rather than addressing that point, he squeezed Sherlock a little harder.
Sherlock gave his head a brisk shake and blinked through the stinging at the corners of his eyes. "No, I didn't. I should have done more. I should have stopped all those people from dying. Even if those alphas..." He swallowed down the words
Sherlock pulled up in front of the yellowstone house on the agreed-upon afternoon and got out of the car. Dusk was already falling, and it would be pitch dark by the time they were back on campus. But students had no say in which laboratory times they were assigned. Several names were on the buzzer – as was to be expected for a student flat share. Sherlock pressed the button and waited. No one answered. He glanced at his watch in annoyance. The time was correct. Of course he had to get a reliable lab partner... He rang again. This time, the intercom crackled and hissed.
Later that evening, after sitting down together for a dinner that John had cooked and following several hectic but fruitless phone calls to DI Lestrade, Sherlock emerged from his bedroom on one more call.
John refrained from a sarcastic reply along the lines of an abduction in broad daylight not exactly being 'finding the time.' Instead, he watched as Mycroft placed his signature on a document with a flourish and slid the lid back on the fountain pen he'd used for it.
Sherlock felt his way across the tangled scar tissue on John's left shoulder, tracing the ridges and indentations that were forever etched into his skin, and sighed against John's lips. He tried to make out John's eyes in the near-darkness, only to discover that his alpha was examining him as well, as if trying to read Sherlock's thoughts.
Sherlock lowered his head. He was overcome with emotion at the fact that John was so willing to accept responsibility for this mess, and he was ashamed for ever having doubted his alpha.
"Morning. Thank you." Sherlock blew across the steaming surface of his tea, only to set the cup back down because it was still too hot.
"I never would have thought Sherlock would be so good with kids," John said to redirect the conversation to another topic.
Victor plunged over and over into the tight, damp channel until his breaths became more frantic and he let out a lust-filled sigh. He sucked hard on John's trapezius, sinking his teeth into the flesh there, and snapped his pelvis forward.
Sherlock was staring out the window over his shoulder, his arms folded across his chest. It was sunny and the air full of birdsong; in contrast, the room was oppressively gloomy and stuffy. Too many people stealing his air. Too many pairs of eyes boring into his skin.
The Detective Inspector noticed a foot in a red trainer peeping out from behind one of the boxes. He stopped in his tracks and inhaled cautiously, just enough to get some idea of what lay concealed behind the barricade of cardboard. He distinctly caught the scent of an omega; bonded and non-threatening. No trace of decomposition. Good. But also the acidic tang of vomit and the metallic aftertaste of blood.
"Getting a glass of water. Or am I not allowed to do that?" Sherlock grumbled, refusing to look at John, and stalked into the next room.
Tears shot into his eyes as he lowered himself out of bed and crawled on hands and knees to the trunk where he kept his personal possessions. He tried to work the hinges, his fingers shaking, but he didn't have enough strength to lift the lid.
Sherlock was acutely aware of his pulse beating faster – although he couldn't quite explain why. "Scenting is... something extremely personal and only occurs within a family unit. Parents usually initiate it when their children are small – but I presume that was never the case in your family."
"Are you completely mad?! Tiger tried to kill me! He bloody poisoned me. If the police hadn't found me in time and taken care of that bastard, I wouldn't even be standing here, got it? Your fucking
"John, John! Please... what's wrong? Wake up!"
"I don't understand."
Bill hugged John tightly, giving him a chummy pat on the shoulder as John did the same.
With a flying head start, he sprinted to the door and tore it open before Sherlock even got there.
Sherlock jerked away when John stroked his chin with his thumb.
"Yes, the annual call of duty. But a little break from studying might be just the thing. What are your plans for the holidays?"
John lifted his head a couple of millimetres and gave her an assessing look. "It's generally difficult to deal with being lured into a trap and beaten up. No matter the reason," he said after a while.
She glanced pointedly between his legs and reached for the belt of her kimono to loosen it. "You know..." The silky material gaped open, revealing her nude figure. "You don't have to sleep on the couch if you don't want to..."
John slowly slipped one finger inside. First just the tip, then up to the first knuckle. She was wet further in, and wonderfully warm and tight. He pushed in deeper, soon adding a second finger to the first, plunging them slowly but persistently in and out as Cilia writhed breathlessly under the attentions of their four hands.
"No, I guess not. Not directly at any rate... but... maybe you could... I don't know... talk about it? Maybe it would help to voice your feelings. To have someone listen. Who... John, you know how I feel about you. We could..." Greg broke off and bit his bottom lip, all too conscious of John's stricken look.
"The case yesterday on the Thames. Anderson insisted it was a murder because of the head injury and scratch marks on the man's face, but of course he overlooked everything of importance. It was clearly a tragic accident. I would not have left that idiot off the hook so easily had it been a murder."
Sherlock nodded and rubbed the spot with his thumb. "How did you know about that? Did Mycroft tell you?"
At the same time, Sherlock had to admit that John had changed over the last few days. He acted more self-assured and calmer than before. The cane hadn't returned to the flat; he wore nicer clothes and his face had taken on a healthier colouring. That couldn't all be a side effect of the heat, could it?
Three days later, Sherlock was rudely awakened in the middle of the night when a loud scream tore through the silence. Without taking time to think, he leapt to his feet and lurched out of the room, ran down the corridor, and burst into his brother's bedroom.
"Mycroft, may I introduce my alpha?"
's about to start. Hm... I've never seen it. Is it any good?" Sherlock asked.
His skin was covered in goosebumps and icy-hot shivers ran down his spine. The arousal that collected in his groin was so concentrated he could barely endure it anymore, until it discharged with a ferocity that Sherlock had never experienced before without a knot. He felt every microsecond of John swallowing around his cock, wheezing as he grabbed breaths in between through his nose. He continued to stroke Sherlock's hypersensitive gland until the last ripple of his climax had faded. Only then did he withdraw his fingers and let go.
"Yeah... that was before you two got together, sweetheart. And I thought before you drive off my next flatmate too, I might as well ask you directly." Abigail gave him a conspiratorial wink.
Sherlock leaned into John and hesitantly returned the gentle embrace. He twisted his fingers into the material of John's shirt and drew his alpha in as close as he could.
John arrived at the hospital before his parents and rushed to the front desk at A&E. Sherlock hung back in the visitors' area to await John's parents and give John the privacy he needed with his sister.
"That reminds me of the nightmares he sometimes had. They got especially bad when we were apart for too long. He'd mutter completely nonsensical things, and then he wouldn't speak for days. It stopped after a while, and he even used to deny it had ever happened."
Greg took John's obvious astonishment with good humour and nodded with a crooked grin.
"It's not an experiment. It's tea."
"You can show me how grateful you are by helping with dinner."
The reply brought a small smile to John's face.
"Feeling warm?" John asked.
"I didn't have much contact with any alphas from the Yard. And I've already told the police everything I know," the omega grumbled in John's direction, pursing his lips. "As I'm sure you already know, I was in the hospital for quite a while after... I really can't tell you anything else."
When they arrived in the subterranean office of Section 6, there was no exchange of brotherly affection between Sherlock and Mycroft. But then it probably hadn't been seven months since the last time the two of them had seen each other, John thought, and twisted his mouth grimly.
John or Greg?
"Your partner at the time, Victor Trevor, left for Harvard and you felt abandoned. You'd already had difficulty at school making connections, and Mr Trevor's departure left you feeling deserted and rejected," the psychologist offered as an explanation.
John sat on a park bench, his hands buried in his pockets and his shoulders hunched up. His gaze wasn't directed at the rolling of the dark ripples on the water, but was lost in the void. The hard line of his jaw made it clear even from a distance that he was gritting his teeth like a gundog that refused to relinquish its prey.
why we want you to be his godfather."
John squared his shoulders and strode toward him. Not waiting for an explicit invitation from Mycroft, John drew out one of the chairs which stood in front of the desk and sat down, placed his hands on his knees, and gave the other man an intent look.
Mike lifted his fleshy hands in a conciliatory gesture. "My only intention was to point out that not everything can be explained through medicine. At least not yet. I only know of a handful of cases in which alphas and omegas felt a connection to their partner when they were separated. Those were usually in particularly stressful or emotional situations, which were felt as a sort of echo by the partner who wasn't actually involved. Aside from that, many omegas are more sensitive than alphas anyway, and develop something like a sixth sense for things that affect their partner."
"Fuck..." All of the energy drained out of John. His shoulders slumped, and he sank down on the foot of the bed and buried his face in his hands. "I had no idea it was so bad."
Sherlock was fascinated by his alpha's dark, gleaming eyes as his own cock brushed John's cheek, and John's tongue darted out to flick it. The same tongue that had just... oh, God! Sherlock bit down hard on his bottom lip. His pelvis twitched forward of its own accord, causing his wet, exposed glans to leave a glistening streak on John's face.
Victor glanced over at Sherlock to check on him: he was watching everything intently. What must be going through his head? The scene seemed to please him, but his distance from the proceedings didn't seem to bother him either. His pupils were dark with lust, his breaths flat and choppy. He rubbed and stroked the cock in his hand at an agonisingly slow pace, perhaps to mimic the feeling that was coursing through Victor's body at the moment.
Anthea took it, but the corners of her mouth remained downturned. She gazed down at her infant, but Sherlock couldn't make out any perceptible emotion on her face.
The music in the overcrowded space changed now, slowing down a couple of beats and becoming more insistent. John drank some more, swallowing past the fluttering sensation in his chest.
"What's wrong?" John asked in a low voice. He had stopped caressing Sherlock and loosened his grip on him. His curiosity was evident in his expression.
"I don't know. In any case, he was very quick to pick up that piece of glass and knew how to use it. He didn't just randomly stab at that woman; he went straight for her neck."
John can't look away. He's much too fascinated by how Sherlock's mouth stretches around his shaft, how he licks and sucks on it, and always making with a self-satisfied sigh. It’s incredibly hard for him to interrupt Sherlock so as not to climax too soon. More roughly then he intended, he grabs the brown curls and pulls Sherlock into an all-consuming kiss. Playfully, he bites into the reddened lips, registering with satisfaction how Sherlock complacently allows it.
Sherlock was alive, and yet also dead. Dead and buried. Separated from the few people who meant anything to him, who had given his life some meaning. But there was nothing to be done. Much worse than his own loss was the unsupportable certainty of how much John was suffering under the circumstances. The few pictures and reports that Sherlock had received from Mycroft showed that all too clearly.
"Could be," John answered evasively. He was going to have to consider the question seriously later on. After everything that had happened, he secretly wondered whether it was really possible to say that fairy tales had an educational value.
"Hmhm," John agreed. "That we should."
"Yes, of course. I'm simply tired," he lied. He suppressed a yawn and stretched to lend credence to his statement. "It should be possible to get a search and seizure order now. Especially on suspicion of multiple homicides."
"Have any plans for today?" John asked, looking down at his phone to gauge how much time he had left before he had to leave for the clinic.
"Now you're starting to ask the right questions," Sherlock said with a crooked grin.
Mike Stamford came in a short while later. "Sherlock! Nice to see you." He closed the door and held out his hand. Sherlock took it and returned the greeting curtly.
"You're incredible," John whispered before he could hold back the statement.
But John couldn't help noticing Victor's hand on the couch next to him curling into a fist, practically trembling with anger. Maybe it hadn't been such a good idea after all for them to come here. There were obviously still unresolved differences between the two fronts which John hadn't wanted to stir up. He cleared his throat discreetly and tried to draw the attention to himself instead.
He let go of Sherlock's legs, shifting to grab his arse with one hand and support his lower back with the other, while Sherlock helped by tightening his grip around John's neck. John cautiously set out for the bedroom, all the while engaging Sherlock in a series of heated kisses.
"Does it still hurt from... the other time?" John asked, hinting at the unfortunate night when Sherlock's failed experiment had provoked an unnatural heat.
John couldn't say anything else before the phone slipped out of his hand and a black cloak of unconsciousness wafted down over him.
Victor dug into Sherlock's shoulders, seeking an anchor point, his breath coming in stuttered gasps. It seemed to take forever for the pain to go away, although it couldn't have been more than a few seconds. His arousal was slow to regain the upper hand, and Victor noticed for the first time how Ryan was stimulating the hypersensitive nerves inside him. How that stimulation went straight to his groin, making him shiver and get hard again.
John exhaled the air from his lungs heavily. If Sherlock was 'W', then who was SH? The answer was obvious: it could only be Sherrinford Holmes. SH. The line "Little Mikey, brother mine" from one of the letters made that pretty clear.
"John, I need to go out. There's another victim and I need to view the crime scene before the forensic team start mucking things up in there."
Victor had made use of the scant few days at his parents' to ponder the latest developments in his life and had come to the conclusion that whatever it was that was derailing him at the moment, it must be a temporary glitch. A little distance was apparently enough to set him in his right mind once more.
John put his arms under Sherlock's knees and placed his hands on either side of Sherlock so that he was both supporting himself and holding Sherlock's legs open. His piercing gaze bored right through Sherlock, sending a shiver through his body that he couldn't explain.
"Slow and gentle – just like I promised you. Tell me if I should stop," Victor said in a low voice and waited until Sherlock nodded his agreement. Victor let his hands wander tenderly across Sherlock's body, taking note of every detail. Trying at the same time to calm himself down enough so that he could keep his promise. He arranged Sherlock's legs over his thighs, stabilised his erect penis with one hand, and cautiously moved forward.
"Of course not," John assented. "Sherlock, you sit in front, I'll—"
"Is he often alone in the city?" Donovan inquired.
Bill trailed off, nonplussed, when John froze in the middle of the room and gaped at her with his mouth hanging open.
"I thought you'd approach me yourself and ask, but I should have known better," she said and placed the letters on top of the open book. "I told you he was here a while back."
"All right," Sherlock said on Anthea's behalf, without taking his eyes off the tiny creature. Children had never really interested him much, but knowing that this little person was part of his own family was... well, it was different. New.
It seemed inescapable, sneaking into his dreams, even during the day, distracting him, causing him to make mistakes. Sherlock didn't recognise himself anymore. He'd finally decided his transport wasn't going to give him any peace until he'd accepted the new challenge and conquered it. And now Victor had thrown obstacles in his path. On purpose! It was maddening.
They rode to the Oxford Circus station and walked from there. They left the well-lit shopping area after just a few metres, turning down a lane where the first few pubs awaited them. It was cold. John stuffed his hands into his jacket pockets and wished he'd brought a pullover, but presumably Victor would have talked him out of it anyway.
The bloody trail led down the stairs, but it originated on the upper floor. The brownish-red marks stood out starkly against the beige carpeting which covered both the stairs and the floor of the hall.
"You want it, don't you?"
"Is it all right if I make some tea? John prefers it over coffee for breakfast."
Mycroft curled his hand into a fist on top of the desk. It must have been unbearable for him to see a member of his own family like that. Someone he'd used to look up to. Someone he'd once loved.
Two days later, Mycroft, Sherlock, and John met up in front of the Alpha-Omega Registry. As soon as their eyes met, Sherlock could have sworn that his heart skipped a beat. He felt all too clearly how every part of him cried out for his alpha; how badly he wanted to cuddle up to him and breathe in his scent.
"But why did you have to make me deceased for that?" he asked, and his voice didn't sound half as angry as he'd wanted to make it. His left hand felt its way across the sheets as if of its own accord, searching for the small remote control device, and grasped it firmly, although without increasing the dose of the pain medication. He didn't want to show Mycroft even more of his weakness.
John looked around at the guests, sizing things up. He saw several soldiers along with a few locals. A handful of beta males formed one group, but the majority were alphas, fairly equally balanced between males and females.
A shot tore through the rumble of the marketplace, making John stagger. Loud shouts rang in his ears as he blinked dazedly down at the box of tea. It slipped out of his hand as if in slow motion and fell into the dirt.
"Let me do it," he said as he adjusted the temperature until it was pleasantly lukewarm.
Very good, Sherlock! Although I want to make the whole thing just a little bit more...
"I’ve brought your suitcase upstairs by the way."
"Oh my God..." John broke off and rubbed the back of his neck in an attempt to collect himself. "She... she also said that the responsible party had been caught."
Yet wasn't that precisely what he had attempted to do? Hadn't he wanted to silence that part of John that seemed to be dogging his every waking moment, in order to finally have some peace?
A lopsided smile appeared on Victor's face, as if he'd read John's thoughts and found them amusing.
"Ow! Bloody hell, watch it!"
Victor shrugged nonchalantly. "I didn't think you were actually interested in me," Victor replied with a conciliatory smile.
Pain zapped through John's cheek when he bit the inside. It was unpleasant for him to admit that Victor knew more about Sherlock than he did. That was a weak point for him, a vulnerability. He wanted to fill the gaps in Sherlock's life story, the ones he'd never been able to talk to him about. All the anecdotes from his childhood and teenage years, the little secrets and the course of his personality development. John couldn't really guess how much Victor knew about all that, of course, but every bit of information had the potential to reveal a piece of Sherlock that John didn't know.
"Anyway, I wanted to stop at that point, but Cilia said we should bring Bill in, which I did. The whole situation was awkward; Bill definitely wasn't very happy at the prospect, but she was hell bent on seeing it through. Her presence had a … positive effect on Cilia, and I also started to get aroused. Bill got a firm grip on Cilia, and... "
"What's the meaning of this?"
The whole affair had taken a much different turn than Victor had expected. What would happen now that Ryan was obviously out of the running? Were he and Sherlock together? A couple?
"The cameras have obviously been tampered with," Mycroft complained without looking up at Sherlock. Sherlock sat down next to his brother to look over his shoulder. "It's highly unlikely that not a single person walked down this hallway during a two-hour period at this time of day. There... a brief flicker in the digits." Mycroft pointed at the time stamp in the upper left corner of the screen. "It's barely more than a fraction of a second. Probably a time loop. The IT department will be able to prove..."
"Do you have any idea when you're going to go back to work full-time?"
"You mean blunt?"
He didn't wait for Sherlock to respond, as Bill got into the car at that moment and started up the engine. She soon had John wrapped up in a conversation about old buddies of theirs, Henry, and the preparations for the christening. John glanced in the rear-view mirror now and then to check on Sherlock. But his omega had turned his head to one side and was staring intently out the window. He looked tense, the corners of his mouth pinched and pointing downward. John intended to talk to him later and try to lay their argument to rest. But for now he turned his attention on his former army buddy.
Leslie stood just a few feet away, playing with the nipples and penis of a male omega, who was writhing sensually from her touch. She looked over at John and gave him a lopsided grin. "Is that little fella not doing it for you, Captain? I'm sure we can find someone else who'll finally let you get it in there."
"John..."
Victor grunted his agreement and went into the kitchen to fetch a beer from the fridge. "The bath's all yours. Towels are on the shelf. Help yourself."
"Perhaps..."
"First the bond which wasn't even real, then the refusal to so much as see him even though it was obvious how much he needed it. You haven't the slightest notion how hard it was over there, and how much we had to witness. Coming home to Cilia was the only thing that kept me sane. But John..." Bill raised her gaze to look Sherlock in the eye for the first time.
"So?" John frowned with annoyance when the omega didn't continue. It was as if the vague statement were supposed to answer John's question.
John sat up and leaned back against the headboard; sleep was out of the question at the moment anyway. "What do you mean?"
," Sherlock sighed, enchanted. "John, we simply must get one for ourselves."
A hand was lowered onto John's shoulder, pressing gently. "It's all right, I know him," Victor reassured him.
"Oh, come on, Victor! Don't tell me he plays for the other team! You can't do that to the ladies!"
"D-do you—"
"Hm," Cilia said thoughtfully, refraining from making any further comment on John's statement for the time being.
He watched a small shudder ripple through Sherlock before he lifted his arms and ran both hands through his short hair, down the back of his neck to his shoulders. His hands ventured further, to his chest, his stomach, down to his hips. The sound of the zip made goose pimples skitter down Victor's back. He watched in fascination as Sherlock slid his trousers and underpants down his legs, removing his socks at the same time. Then pushed everything carelessly away.
"Oh," Sherlock said and pulled up his knees to wrap his arms around them. "I... so... technically, that … wasn't my first time."
"Oh." The surprise was clearly audible in Sherlock's voice. "Thank you."
"John?" he said, as if to chase away the mirage. But it didn't disappear. "You came..." Sherlock whispered between two frantic breaths, as his alpha took in the scene before him.
The McKenzie case concerned a series of homicides. Five alphas had been attacked and killed while separated from their omegas; two of the omegas had gone into rapid decline shortly thereafter due to their broken bond, and eventually died. The alphas had been attacked inside their flats or houses. They had been drugged and had their hands and feet bound. Then their jugular and femoral arteries had been slit, and they had bled out.
John was just a step behind him with their two overnight bags. "Really? After that luncheon and the doggy bag on the train, I would have thought you'd go on a hunger strike for the next week. The trip must have taken more out of you than expected, eh?"
John nodded his acknowledgment to Mycroft, letting him know that he appreciated the effort, before returning his attention to the three teacups.
John watched with satisfaction as the cup he'd just flung against the wall burst apart and scattered across the kitchen floor. Unfortunately, the white-hot fury he felt wasn't as quick to dissolve into its component parts. Quite the opposite. Prompted by the gratifying sound of the shattering porcelain, his gaze skidded around the kitchen, eventually landing on the dirty dishes from the night before.
Feeling the strain in his body, Sherlock exhaled the air from his lungs and closed his eyes for a moment. His exhaustion was bone-deep, and demanded ever more of his fragile attention. The pain was returning, slowly but surely: it had found itself a cosy spot in his body, and was only being held in check by the morphine.
The time between each murder had increased, but there was no recognisable mathematical pattern there either. Lestrade had hit a dead end, and Sherlock couldn't help him. Whoever the killer was, he was holding his cards close to his chest.
"Well, you know..." John shrugged. He added soy sauce to the meat and vegetables, being careful that it didn't splatter, then turned down the heat and stirred the pre-cooked rice to the pan. "I just want to be prepared if you go into heat anytime soon."
John had to summon all of his willpower in order not to provide himself some relief. His cock was painfully hard, and standing out from his body like a rod. A fine rivulet of pre-come trickled down the shaft and seeped into his pubic hair.
"And this is Mary," Nigel announced, dropping his arm over the woman's shoulders and pulling her in with a friendly squeeze. "Tell us something about yourself."
"Ah... of course..." Sherlock let the door fall shut and looked over at Anthea. She lay with her face toward the window, ignoring Sherlock completely. It was already getting light out, the last few stars fading into the blue background.
As autumn approached, John pushed any thoughts of Sherlock further into the back of his mind. He knew he didn't have a future with the omega, and it was about time for him to accept that fact in its entirety. Sherlock had made that quite clear from the beginning and never given any indication of wanting to change anything about the situation. On the contrary: he'd never reacted to any of John's intermittent letters or responded after John had turned up in Kensington last winter.
!" Moran hissed, forcing a loud, smacking kiss onto Sebastian's cheek. The omega's scent immediately shifted. A combination of fear and anger flooded Sherlock's nose, making him shudder inadvertently. Sebastian was definitely
John tilted his head as he considered: based on the posture of the two individuals, the woman must clearly be the omega, even if that special scent was missing. Was that the reason why she needed to actively seek an alpha? The man, confidently perched on the lab stool in front of the microscope, must therefore be a scent-neutral beta. Even though his entire attitude resembled that of an alpha. But he didn't smell like one at all.
"Happy birthday, Captain!"
John growled as he kicked at a pile of damp leaves. The expected satisfaction at the flying leaves was foiled by one sticking to his right shoe. As he leaned down to remove the orange maple leaf, he caught sight of a black town car rolling to a stop beside him. John straightened up, already suspicious, when the window was lowered and someone called his name. A young alpha gave John a polite smile and asked him to step closer.
John can think of a number of reasons for such behaviour. Perhaps it is true what so many people have told him, that Sherlock has no actual need for human contact.
He began to experiment with Seven to find a way to break a bond. Unfortunately, his attempts were unsuccessful, and he realised that the only way he could save the omegas was by making the alphas disappear. Their fate thus sealed, Sebastian refined the drug's formulation little by little until he created something that allowed for a bond to be broken without causing the death of the remaining partner.
John was panting and dazed. His heart and pulse were hammering against his ribs with no discernible rhythm. It was as if every one of his thoughts had been extinguished, leaving nothing but
Mycroft withdrew his leather notebook from the inside pocket of his suit jacket and flipped to a page near the back. "Wilhelmina Murray."
Now John didn't need any abstract labels anymore to name his feelings for Sherlock; no definitions to make it easier for others to force their relationship into some pre-conceived mould. The only thing that mattered was that they had each other, that they loved and respected one another.
"No. I found a way to make the whole thing much easier."
Sherlock followed the motions of his alpha's hands, bemused, as he undid the clasps of his leather briefcase and withdrew a blue file folder. He frowned as he took and opened it. Inside, he found copies of reports and several bloody crime scene photos. He inhaled sharply.
It was hard to believe the waves set in motion by Sebastian's admission. Several incredible things happened in quick succession. The public mobilised. Omegas rebelled. Betas rose up, and even many alphas who didn't want to sit by and watch omegas being treated unfairly joined the cause.
"I'm so happy the two of you found each other, Sherlock," she said as she sautéed the onions. "The first time I met John, it was as if some fundamental part of him was missing; not unusual when an alpha is separated from their omega. But with John... I don't know. He really seemed to be missing a piece of his soul. I could always sense this profound yearning in him. Is that how you felt too?" she asked.
"And now… let go."
"All right, fine. And I'm sorry for calling you a poor excuse for an alpha. I knew those words would hurt you, and that was the only reason I used them. I apologise."
"Then what makes you think Bill would? Or that she would even have the right to? I'm her partner, her omega, but I'm not chattel."
Sebastian lifted his shoulders again and looked off to the side, as if he had to think about the question before answering it. When he looked at Sherlock again, however, he looked anything but uncertain. "It's easy enough to find drugs that can manipulate omega biology these days."
"The knot," he remarked, his voice thick. He swallowed hard before continuing: "You've never used it before."
"Likeable... I don't know about that... I'd rather say he's dangerous. An absolute nutter." Tom shook his head slowly, adding a theatrical sigh. "Oh right, I'm supposed to ask you for Abby if you'd help transport the drinks for the party this weekend."
John waited until Nick had walked around him, then reluctantly followed the two of them back to the couch without taking his eyes off Nick. It wasn't until he'd sat down that he felt his racing heart and the pounding in his head, which had been overridden by the burst of adrenaline before.
He was well aware that he should distance himself from John right about now; after all, scenting usually didn't take more than a couple of seconds, but this right here... this was...
"Bathroom's free..."
He wondered what Sherlock and Sherrinford had rowed over, and whether their relationship had already been as cool as Sherlock and Mycroft's. What kind of person had Sherrinford been? Had he been as unapproachable and distant as Mycroft, or as moody and unpredictable as Sherlock? Or completely different?
"Please, I... can't... I can't..."
Visibly caught off guard by the unmatched pair which included an actual
Images from his first and second heat with John flashed through his head. Emotional impressions that were most likely seared forever into his memory. To be sure, he didn't have many points of comparison; after all, John was the first person he'd had this kind of sex with, and their first time had been imprinted vividly in his mind. Perhaps because it hadn't been entirely consensual. Although it was true that Sherlock had been in the throes of the desperation of his first true heat, and he was the one who had called John and informed him of the impending surge. Could he really absolve himself of any responsibility?
"All right... fine. I'll still be discussing the plan with Anthea first and make a decision as to who will bring you to Sherlock. Anthea will show you to the library so that you can find something to occupy yourself with rather than damaging any more furniture," Mycroft commented dryly, albeit with a hint of a smile on his lips.
As always many thanks to
"I could show you how it goes," Victor said, fixing Sherlock with a look that he didn't know how to interpret. "You're a clever kid and you like making sure everyone knows how much more you know than they do. Wouldn't it be strange if you didn't know anything about kissing? Someone like Walters will hardly have the patience to teach you."
"He wanted to help us. I gave my consent and wanted him to do what he'd offered to. But it's true that I got spooked halfway in. I would have gone through with it anyway because it was the only way I saw at the time to make my dream come true. The … episode that John had... it prevented all three of us from doing something really stupid. None of us could have known how Bill might react if John had actually... It took weeks before we could make love again after that without thinking about that night. But it wasn't John's fault. None of it was."
The chamber was empty.
John also preferred spending his free time alone at the weekend. He told his therapist that he met up with some of the club members from time to time, but that was more for the purpose of garnering an acknowledging smile and appeasing her until their next meeting.
Whoever had come up with the nomenclature certainly hadn't been an omega...
Mindful, John positions himself and slowly presses his hips forward, pushing against the ring of muscles. When he sees Sherlock gasp and twitch, he pauses, stroking distractingly at Sherlock's erect penis.
Well, now it was done.
"Not really. But there's nothing to be done in the absence of any further evidence." Sherlock snorted incredulously. "Moran defended him by saying Sebastian was too stupid to commit a crime of that nature. Too stupid because he's just an omega who watches birds in his free time and somehow happened to turn up at the crime scene! And the injury to the beta was nothing more than an accident, in his view."
"Right, I'll go have a look around for a doctor and send Dad in, yeah? We'll just hang out in the waiting area after that."
"Hold on," John growled as he steadied Sherlock and lifted him off the table.
He could virtually smell and taste the omega John was with himself. Daisies, spring dew, lightheartedness... and rock candy? What in the world? Sherlock felt all too clearly how attracted John was to the scent composition and overall presence of the omega.
"I'm quite sorry, but that won't be possible. Your omega is currently – " She stopped herself from speaking further. "At any rate, no, I cannot contact Sherlock. Good day, Dr Watson."
"You feel... incredible..." he panted into the crook of Sherlock's neck. "There's no one else like you."
Every muscle in his body was proclaiming its misery. He would actually rather have gone back to bed instead of going to such lengths as he had that morning, but the restlessness lurking beneath his skin simply wouldn't allow it. If he'd followed his instincts, he would have pursued John up to the second floor and joined him in bed; would have snuggled up to him and breathed in his scent – just like he had for the past few days. But of course that was completely out of the question.
Harry opened the driver's door and got out. She gave John, then Sherlock, an assessing look from head to toe before instinctively straightening her posture as if trying to minimise the significant height difference between herself and Sherlock.
******
A quick sidelong glance revealed a rather taken Sherlock biting his lips unconsciously at the scene laid out before him. Victor slipped a hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and nudged him closer, let go of Ryan, and kissed Sherlock again.
They met once or twice a month, depending how critical Sherlock's needs were. And through those contacts, a sort of friendship developed between them. Well, friendship might not have been the right word for it, but they spent quite a bit of time together whenever Sherlock wasn't involved in a case. It was obvious that Wiggins was interested in more than Sherlock's company, but Sherlock always brushed off his advances.
The woman offered a mild smile. "I'm afraid that property would be slightly out of your price range, don't you think, dear? All the same, I don't think Lord Moran would ever be willing to sell."
The return trip was uneventful. Both men were so tired from the long excursion and the emotions that had been stirred up that they barely exchanged more than three words with each other. Victor nodded off at some point, and John mulled over his own thoughts. He couldn't manage to simply set aside all of the new insights he'd gained in order to give them more attention later.
Her entire body trembled as she quietly wept.
John barked out an incredulous laugh. "How long did it take until you rebelled?"
The first step was usually to check whether the omega had a bite mark, but that wasn't always possible right away. Alphas could lose control over themselves quite rapidly where injured or endangered omegas were concerned, which in turn could lead to them unwittingly destroying evidence in their efforts to protect the omega. For that reason, alphas at the Yard were required to apply a scent blocker under their nose before entering a crime scene – which Lestrade had neglected to do.
After one more sip, he set the bottle down and let his gaze wander across the desk. That strange letter still lay there, the one he'd come across with Victor a couple of days ago. The scant lines had been typewritten. Obviously one of the old models with type bars, which was indicated by the irregular margins of the letters. Some of the letters had sharp edges or notches because the typefaces had been scratched after years of use and the marks had transferred onto the paper through the ribbon.
"I have no idea what Sherlock told you, or what conclusions you may have drawn," John hissed. It took a concerted effort on his part to control his rapidly accelerating breaths, and he noticed that he was starting to tremble with anger. He needed to muster all of his self-control in order not to reach across the table, grab the other alpha by the throat, and shake him until he showed a little respect.
John waited a moment to see if Victor was going to continue. But he seemed to have finished his story and was focused on his potato wedges. John reviewed the last few facts and furrowed his brow. He could imagine only too well how Sherlock increasingly lost control over his drug use once Victor was no longer around.
Precisely half an hour after he'd received Mycroft's text, a black town car pulled up outside of 221B. John snorted, grimaced, and got into the back seat. The driver nodded at him in the rear-view mirror but didn't make a sound; John likewise refrained from a start-of-the-day salutation. It wasn't the first time John had been picked up by Mycroft's henchmen, which meant his level of nervousness was contained.
Victor used the opportunity to land a blow on John, sending him to the floor. "I've wanted to do that the whole time," Victor claimed, following up with a second blow.
"We haven't time for that!" Sherlock snapped. "It's of little consequence whether she's guilty or not. This letter clearly points to Sherrinford." He spread out the piece of paper he'd mentioned and smoothed it down by swiping his hand over it several times. "There must be a clue in it... There must be!"
"Have you never seen her before, or simply never spoken to her?" Mycroft pressed.
"I need to hurry, my next class is about to start," Abigail said, pressing a kiss onto Victor's cheek as a good-bye. Without making a show of it, she climbed over her desk and the next row of chairs to get past the others and slipped out the door. Victor watched her go, then looked over at Sherlock, who didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. His hands were tightly clenched around the page he'd been writing on. His eyes darted nervously back and forth from Walters to the line of students, which was becoming shorter by the minute.
Victor had turned around to inspect the bookshelves again, skimming the titles of the books, pulling one out here and there and reading the blurbs on the back covers. Thus distracted, he didn't notice the cardboard box filled with papers that stood between John's armchair and the fireplace. He tripped over it, knocking it over. The cardboard flaps opened, spilling a large number of loose papers, notebooks, and letters onto the floor.
A distressed sigh escapes Sherlock's lips. It isn’t clear whether it’s the question that annoys him or the topic itself. However, John knows that Sherlock rarely mentions something that doesn’t actually bother him. "I dream of what happened at the pool."
"As I said, I'm
The London weather became cooler. Most of the trees in Regent's Park were already dropping their yellow and brown foliage. One Saturday evening near the beginning of November, John left the gymnasium following a session, ready to go home and make himself something to eat. He'd probably watch a movie and round out the evening in a nice, quiet manner.
"I understand. However, I hope you're not here to further your omega's pursuit of his hobby? Sebastian is quite exhausted from this whole excruciating episode, and we're not prepared to discuss the topic again."
"Why don't you come in at least," John heard himself saying. He unlocked the black door and went into the building. They went upstairs to the kitchen together, where without any ado, John reached for the kettle, filled it, and turned it on.
She knelt down, patted his cheek and forehead, and tried unsuccessfully to get his attention. She eventually gave up and whirled around to face me.
"Of course I desire—" John began, only to be sharply interrupted by Cilia.
When John came to, it was the middle of the night. He whimpered softly and blinked at the bright light shining into his pupils. Pain shot through his head, and he raised one feeble hand to shield his eyes. His throat felt raw and scorched, something was thudding dully against his sternum, and there was an unpleasant twinge in his left arm. He carefully lowered his hand from his face and slowly opened his eyes again.
He forcibly pushed the symbol to end the call and hurled the phone onto his leather armchair with an irritated sigh.
"Never," he whispers close to Sherlock's ear and sinks back into the embrace.
"Sherrinford was already being held in a maximum-security facility at the time. His work with MI6 had been put on hold after he was held responsible for a massacre during a mission in which he was supposed to secure some highly sensitive information. In the event, not only the alleged terrorists but also four of our own people were killed. The investigation concluded that it could not have been an accident; that it must have been intentional. The whole thing looked like a setup from which no one could emerge alive. I had important connections to MI5 and MI6 at the time already, and was therefore immediately informed that my brother had been placed under arrest. I was allowed to speak to Sherrinford, perhaps in the hope that he would open up to a family member. Of course no one had been able to discover yet what motive Sherrinford might have had for his conduct."
But Victor didn't do relationships at all. He was free, and yet he'd still been left with a broken heart. John ran through in his head once more what Victor had said on the train. The story of how he'd fallen in love with Sherlock, how he'd manipulated a lecturer for Sherlock and ended up suffering the consequences himself. In more than one way.
But most of all, he'd never seriously fought a friend – and despite everything, that's what Victor was: a friend.
John dug his fingers into Sherlock's soft flesh to anchor himself as Sherlock lifted his pelvis to position John's erection against his sphincter.
When the sound of someone clearing their throat came from the door, both men looked up. Mary was leaning against the door frame, her arms and legs crossed, watching the scene with one eyebrow perked with interest.
Mycroft pulled up the next picture, which showed Sherlock during physical therapy. The strain was written all over his face as he leaned on a wall in order to take tentative steps.
Beyond that, Sherlock met up with some of his old acquaintances – or perhaps even friends – again. First and foremost was the pathologist, Molly Hooper, the beta from St Bart's who was now working closely with the Yard and didn't seem to have any difficulties with Sherlock's mannerisms. Then there was the beta Sally Donovan, who took an interest in human rights and served as the first point of contact at the Yard for omegas, who often weren't taken seriously.
Sherlock's blood reached the boiling point as it rushed through his veins, causing his cock to swell rapidly. Omega essence collected between his arse cheeks, tickling his thighs when it caught on the fine hairs there.
, John thought and whipped around to deliver a rejection to the umpteenth man that night. Neither his head nor his knees were particularly pleased with the action, however, and promptly refused to function. Before John could fall to the floor between the barstools, the stranger reached for him and held him up.
"John!" he screamed, barely aware of the tears pouring down his face. He was too occupied with the pain pulsing through his body, as if someone were holding a jackhammer against his shoulder. Shaking, he looked down at the tightly clenched hand holding his shoulder and realised there was no blood.
know? Have you ever thought about what a beta might feel? That we're just people who want to be loved too?" she barked angrily.
"Why the game? Why go to all this trouble? What's the point of it all?" Sherlock's eyes darted aimlessly around the tiny office as he tried to put together the pieces of the puzzle in his mind's eye.
The other alpha indicated a metal-bound door at one end of the room, which was just opening. Middle Eastern music began to play, and a woman in billowing robes danced in.
Maybe Nick was with him. Maybe they were on their way back to Victor's place together to have sex. Or maybe they'd disappeared into the back rooms of Deep Purple, swallowed up by the violet twilight, and were doing it there.
He felt miserable. His body was as heavy as a bag of wet sand and still seemed to be asleep. Several tubes were attached to it. One in the crook of his left arm, one in the back of his hand, affixed to his lower arm with white tape. They led to an IV stand with several bags. Two additional tubes disappeared underneath the white bedcover.
"I thought he was in his room... Do you know where he has run off to?" John asks, puzzled.
"Fuck, I had no idea. Why didn't she ever tell me about that?"
John shook his head with a smirk. "And how's that supposed to work, genius? I was able to set aside a little money when I was in the army, but it's nowhere near enough for an investment like that."
"What did he say?" John asked warily.
"John... is there anything I can do for you?" he asked now, still attempting to keep John's focus on him for more than a couple of seconds. It hurt to see his friend so completely beside himself. His helplessness and clumsiness paralysed him, making it clear time and again how much John missed Sherlock.
"On the house!" The bartender's words were barely understandable amidst the general noise.
"It's... fine," John declared, grabbing his forehead.
"Anthea will escort you to another room where you can rest," Mycroft said and slid John's phone across the table to him. "You can have this back now. We'll call you when we need your opinion."
"I'll get us another," Victor said and got up. His hurried departure looked a little bit like running away. John folded his arms and watched as Victor went to the bar and placed his order. While he was waiting, a man approached him and said something, smiling, then gave him a quick hug; apparently an old acquaintance. They exchanged a few words before Victor was handed two bottles, which he brought back with him.
Moran leaned his head back and laughed heartily at his own joke. It sounded like the bleating of an animal, and reminded John of a goat. Beside him, Sherlock tensed up noticeably, and John stroked his bony knuckles with his thumb to soothe him.
"Get away from him!" she ordered, assuming what was probably meant to be a threatening pose directly in front of me. I stood, charmed at so much foolishness, gave her the space she required, and walked slowly around her. She felt my presence like a cold draught on the back of her neck, but her concern over Sherlock was stronger than her unease.
He shook his head when Mary held the device out to him, instead pressing the cream-coloured calling card with golden lettering into her hand.
John was scrupulously scraping together the last few crumbs on his plate, making certain not to miss so much as a single one. He then licked off the fork and rubbed his stomach contentedly before taking a sip of coffee.
"Want to see some more?" Sherlock asked, arching one eyebrow provocatively. He was suddenly very aware of a change in John's scent as adrenaline thrummed through his veins and the lust for adventure flooded every cell.
It was ironic that an omega of all people had saved his sister's life, John thought to himself as he prepared for that day's visit to the hospital.
The image of John staring at the door, his fingers tracing the notches in the door frame, burned their way uninvited into Sherlock's mind. John, here in his old house, no more than thirty centimetres between them, as if they were fated to keep finding their way back to each other.
"I wanted to speak with you about the visit to the Murrays. I… I don't know if I can go with you," Sherlock murmured in a low voice.
..." he whinged, but John couldn't hear him. John wasn't there. Damnit, why wasn't John there? Wasn't it an alpha's duty to put an end to this infernal torture? Shouldn't his mere presence suffice to quench his desire?
"We'll see," Victor replied on auto-pilot. But he was cursing inside. He stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray and took a big sip of his coffee, then another, but it didn't help ease the dry feeling in his throat. He lit another cigarette with numb fingers. The smoke only worsened the strange feeling in his chest that was compressing his lungs.
When Sherlock settles on John's lap and wraps his arms around his neck, they kiss again and again. John strokes Sherlock's long back, his hips, his buttocks, pulling him close, so that Sherlock's erection stubbornly presses against his stomach, making him gasp. His fingers glide over Sherlock's round buttocks, reach in firmly and lasciviously knead the soft flesh. Confident, he feels his way to Sherlock's anus and slowly massages the ring of muscles there.
fun with me!" Sarcasm. "Not as much as you could have had, but... I can’t force you to... like me." Sherlock spits out the last word as if it tasted particularly bad. It wounds John and his stomach contracts painfully.
Mycroft looked him over with a calculating air. John would have missed the twitch at the corner of his mouth if he'd so much as blinked.
Sherlock couldn't have wanted all of that to happen. It was unthinkable that he'd wanted John to see him and Moriarty fall into the Thames. It was much more likely that he'd hoped for assistance. Assistance that John hadn't been able to give him after all. Because he'd been saving Victor's life. Because he'd tripped on his way to the bridge and lost several valuable seconds.
At the same time, a niggling sense of missing Sherlock tickled at his subconscious, trying to break through to the surface. It itched now and then like an annoying mosquito bite, sometimes more faintly and then making its presence known more urgently again, always getting stronger whenever he thought about it. John would have liked to say good-bye to Sherlock in person that morning. Maybe done another scenting. But the omega had still been asleep when John left the flat.
, he would read him the riot act. Hopefully, Sherlock hasn’t emailed Sarah ... Pouring additional oil onto
"Yes. No. I don't know. He knows that I've always had satisfactory sex with betas, and that a heat isn't—"
"'s all right," Sherlock mumbled along with a huge yawn. A few moments later, he was asleep.
"What?! You can't be serious!" she cried, alarmed. "I won't let that happen!"
Free at last, and lying on his back, he sighs with relief and wraps his fingers around the glistening head of his erection, spreads the emerging wetness over the entire length. With almost rough gestures, he pushes the foreskin up and down, rubs circles over the sensitive frenulum and the slippery slit with his thumb, while panting laboriously. His hips tense up, thrust demandingly into his hand, while in his head he replays the images of Sherlock that are etched into his mind. His grip intensifies, gliding frantically over the burning shaft and his sensitive glans until it is finally too much and he comes. More out of reflex than caution, he pushes his shirt up and spills on his contracting stomach. He presses his lips together firmly, so that his ecstatic moans become nothing more than a desperate whimper.
"He was completely out of it on the way over here already. I don't think he's used to drinking so much..." Victor whispered, planting a soft kiss on the corner of Tom's mouth.
Aside from John, Victor Trevor was probably one of the very few people Sherlock had opened up to. His relationship to his friend from his youth … his former lover … confidante... John still couldn't come up with an appropriate definition for their relationship, but it must have been extraordinary. The rational side of John's mind felt sorry for Victor, who must be suffering just as John was. But Victor hadn't come to the funeral either. Maybe he thought it was silly to stand in front of an empty coffin and celebrate an official farewell that could never fix the pain inside him. John could understand that all too well, even if he didn't approve of Victor's absence.
