Sherlock looked at him gravely with the faintest of smiles shining in his eyes. “Are you seriously suggesting accompanying me to a concert of classical music? You? ”
“Well, I can be his daughter from time to time,” suggests Tiffany seriously. “When he wants to do dad things like reading to me and going to museums and buying me ice-cream and books and stuff. I wouldn’t mind this at all.”
His own? Very probable. Apparently whatever he was struck with wasn’t altogether blunt, or the blow was particularly forceful. “
“Yes. Wouldn’t miss that stage for the world. Not sure I’ll survive it, though. But I’d rather go out with a bang – or a crash – than wait until they fire or kill me. Because it wouldn’t just be an early termination of my contract. It could be an early termination of my life. It’d look like an accident, of course. Rogue car or lorry driver, drug overdose, poor chap simply fell asleep and didn’t wake up again because of a sudden cardiac arrest. My blood samples would show that my haematocrit was higher than it should be, that’d be the explanation.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Sherlock with a straight face and twinkling eyes, “I think you should ask Arthur Shappey for a make-over of your blog. It’s rather short of flying aeroplanes, and the colours are dull and boring.”
John’s feet upset some of the puzzle pieces she had set aside for later use. Irritated, she looked up and studied him. John gave her an apologetic smile, which she returned.
“Sure,” replies John, his expression open and genuine. “I’m certainly not inattentive, nor blind, but I’d never have managed to gather so many facts in such a short time. You’ll have to repeat what you just said, and I’ll write it down. At some point we’ll have to tell the police, you know.”
“No, not really,” answered Susan. “But whoever opened it didn’t shut it properly again. It was drawn by, but the latch hadn’t been shut. But the horse itself couldn’t have done it, obviously. The door mechanisms are designed in a way so that even the most ingenious animal can’t open them.”
John nods. “Yeah. Thought I’d enjoy it while it’s still light outside. It’ll be dark by the time we reach Paris.”
“Or if you need some really dark chocolate,” Emma told Sherlock with a wink, at which he inclined his head in recognition and gratitude.
“Think we’ll get Moriarty before this Tour is over? I’d hate to see him win, stand on the podium and all that.”
“Well, Charles, I’d really like to help you, but I’m already compelled to stay over night. But perhaps Sherlock here is willing to swap.”
with most of the sprinters split from the peloton before Col de Menté and is already twenty minutes behind the group with Sherlock and the yellow jersey. The leading breakaway still has almost ten minutes on their
He muses for a moment as he watches John Watson limp into the growing darkness under the trees of Bletchley Park.
Sherlock yawns again. He seems to have dissolved even further into the mattress. His eyes are half-closed and barely focus on John. He blinks sleepily. “You can do that,” he rumbles.
-heavy motorway. For this reason, it was rather busy with cars. Other than that, the centre of town seemed almost deserted. There were some shops and bistros and a fairly large Carrefour supermarket in a small square, but many of the houses along the main street stood silent and forbidding with their windows hid behind wooden shutters. Apparently during summer many inhabitants had moved up into the mountains to escape the heat. A church and the ruined remains of a castle rose from the old part of Saint Michel which climbed the hill behind the town square on its north-eastern side. South-westward across the river, the railway and the motorway there loomed the forested slopes of the Télégraphe, their first mountain-pass to tackle on the way to the Col du Galibier.
“Officially at four, but it might be later, depending on whether Lester is back after his accident. Why? Any particular plans?”
A furious cry sounds from the upstairs window. He knows they’ll be after him in hot pursuit now. Onto the bins and over the fence, he lands smoothly on the other side in a pile of last year’s leaves overgrown by weeds. Beyond there’s a ditch full of nettles, a road, and some meadows studded with trees, with a clump of denser trees covering the hillside above them.
Sherlock exchanges a glance with John who nods emphatically. Sherlock would have preferred to stay around and wait for The Woman to emerge from the stage again, and perhaps watch her at the stage door. Also, what if there is a change of plan? What if Wilcox tells Adler about who he has invited, and she refuses to meet Sherlock yet again? What if she is simply tired and wishes to return to her accommodation right away? Or his? On the other hand, Sherlock knows that in his condition, waiting around here isn’t advisable. As much as he loathes it, with his injuries, he has to ration his strength. He has already been putting a lot more strain on his body than is advisable. And who knows what else the night will bring?
Stiffly, Sherlock lowered himself to the edge of the mattress. John scooted a little closer, noticing that the other wasn’t wearing any socks.
“Yes, go and brush your teeth – brilliant idea, genius – and then get your perfect arse over to the sofa and see what’s on the telly. I’ll join you in a moment.”
“Perhaps I’m worried about you, okay? Perhaps I don’t want you to get hurt by him again, him or anybody else.”
“Yes,” said Katie. “He was taken by the local fallen stock removal firm – there’s one in Melton. The owners insisted his stomach contents be checked. Dr. Hensley analysed the sample, but … well ....”
John was still thinking about the mysterious mail when they reached Bart’s and set out towards the morgue. Why would the Woman send him these photos? Why not Sherlock? Well, he could understand about the picture of his sleeping friend. But the other one? Was this just one of her little games? Surely she wouldn’t do anything without an ulterior motive. He considered asking Sherlock about it, but his friend had fallen silent in the cab and seemed to be lost in thought, his magnificent brain racing at top speed. John knew better than to interrupt.
“Yeah, mentioned it. Oh, thanks for the honey bar, by the way. It was brilliant. Mrs. T. said you suggested changes to her recipe. Like honey, do you?”
“Not necessarily. The archiving of the received, still encrypted messages runs independently of the versions we codebreaker receive for our work. I’ll have to talk to Tiltman, and to those who worked with Jennifer on that day. It’s dangerous to formulate theories without all the evidence to hand, but I suspect that someone noticed the importance of the message and let it disappear, and also removed the copy from the archive. It seems that Jenny got wind of this and somehow managed to copy down some information, meaning that with some likelihood she knew that person.”
Wilcox’s eyes narrow even more, before he relaxes. “Of course I have. So have you, if I’m not mistaken. But I have to be absolutely certain before I take anything of what I’ve learned to the higher ups. And so should you. Irene Adler is a very valuable asset, despite her somewhat ... shady allegiance. We’re better off having her on our side, at least partially, than not at all. Do you understand?”
“Not sure if you’re supposed to have milk,” muses John as he stands and watches her, before stooping again to gently pet her head, “but you look as much in need of a drink as I. Wonder what you’re called.
“Wasn’t there a pizza place near the station?” mused John. “That close to the Italian border, it should be decent, at least.”
“You may do it,” said Sherlock, his voice deep and slightly hoarse. He drew back the covers, swallowed, then lay back again, gazing up at John expectantly and with a hint of his previous insecurity and vulnerability. John smiled when gently, he ran the towel over Sherlock’s stomach and between his legs. “You are utterly beautiful, you know that?” he murmured, leaning close and nuzzling Sherlock’s throat before kissing him.
And indeed, the music the instrument issued forth a short while later sounded strange. John did not recognise the tune in its entirety, although he thought there were passages he had heard before. It was ‘proper’ music, however, at times slow and sad, at times hauntingly beautiful like a majestic, awe-inspiring landscape or work of art, at others strangely discordant and jarring. Now and again Sherlock repeated passages with slight alterations. John began to suspect he was in fact composing. A memory of another incident of Sherlock letting the violin give voice to his emotions in a way he wasn’t willing or even able to with words came to mind.
They reached Liverpool Street Station with about twenty minutes to spare. While Sherlock bought the train tickets, John went in search of a Waterstones to acquire an Ordnance Survey map of the Woodbridge area. Unfortunately the bookshop was already closed for the night, so he just got himself and Sherlock a cup of coffee and met him at the track their train was about to depart from. Their locomotive was called “Rædwald”, which John took as funny coincidence and a good omen for their journey.
He growled softly at his phone which apparently still refused to load the video, typed a short text message, then switched it off and slid it into the inner pocket of his coat. “This is pointless. Moreover we’re already leaving Colchester. We’ll be at Ipswich soon.”
Of course John has heard. Something flashes in his eyes. At first Sherlock thinks it’s anger, outrage, even. Surely John caught the implied meaning. A fierce denial will follow, the one Sherlock’s heard so many times before whenever people suggested they were more than flatmates and friends, when they thought the two of them were a couple.
“They made two versions, didn’t they?” he says. “An official one in which Leander did most of the dancing and singing, and in which they kept her mostly clothed for decency’s sake, showing enough skin to make her enticing, but not enough to get into trouble with censorship. And then there’s a more ... revealing version, isn’t there?”
“In one of the team cars. He gave me your key and asked me to slip in and get him his toothbrush and some other stuff. Sorry for creeping into your room.”
“Yeah, sure. Come on, let’s get you on a stationary bike and some food into your belly before you faint for real. Also, I want to watch how the last few riders are faring, particularly Moriarty.”
Sherlock nodded. “I promise, John. I guess the ‘stick around for good thing’ applies to me as well now since you’re so adamant you don’t want to get rid of me. How odd. I never thought I’d ... settle down with someone. It feels strange, the notion. But ... good.”
Sherlock inclines his head. “I am aware. But it’s about time, don’t you think? The tension – I think it’s called pining – between us has become unbearable, at least for me. And I’d like to try this. With you. If you’re willing.”
“Indeed. But I know you aren’t. Whereas I could be the most obnoxious arsehole on the planet, and therefore not worthy of your repeated attempts at befriending me.”
Sherlock considers this. “Oh, I don’t know. According to what we know of him, he was an aspiring artist before he became an aspiring tyrant. He tried to get into art school and was refused due to lack of skill and aptitude. Lack of taste, too, perhaps, considering what kind of art is ‘official’ now in Germany. He might actually appreciate this building, ugly monstrosity that it is.”
“Lord Sebastian Moran?” asks Lang astonished. “I just read about him in the papers – the same article you were mentioned in as well, Mr. Holmes. He is a local squire, as I’m sure you know. We never had much trouble with him, although I’ve heard rumours that his tenants don’t like him that much. He never involved himself much in the goings on in this town, unlike his mother, Lady Moran, who is a great local benefactor. But her son always stayed a little separate. London was more to his liking, I daresay.”
Perhaps he can at least make a case-study out of it, monitor himself and record the changes his mind and body go through whenever John Watson is nearby. So far, he has noticed a flutter in the stomach area and acceleration of his heartbeat. Palpitations, isn’t that the term? Is that even scientific, or something straight out of a Jane Austen novel? And why on earth hasn’t he deleted Jane Austen? Her writings are hardly relevant for his work, either here at Bletchley or back in London. Or no, wait, it
Sherlock’s lips narrowed. He drew another breath, then nodded gravely. “We’ve been there before, remember? With Moriarty. He knew you were important to me even then, when officially we were still only flatmates and crime-solving colleagues. ‘I’ll burn the heart out of you’, that’s what he said, back at the pool. And he almost succeeded, not just with me. Nine months of grief and mourning for you, and the same time of darkness and loneliness and many things I wish I could delete for me.”
“I was speaking figuratively, Sherlock. So he did something else you didn’t want. And you told him to stop. And he pretended to be hurt and insulted, just because you initiated a kiss but didn’t want more than that. Kissing doesn’t automatically mean sex. You didn’t consent to him groping you – or whatever else he tried – and had he really cared about you, he’d have accepted this. You know, I think what happened between you was an attempt on his side to lord one over you when his prowess at cycling couldn’t match yours anymore. And if that’s true, it was a shitty thing to do. Hell, it was a shitty thing whatever his intention.”
John laughs. “I was rather reminded of some Renaissance sculpture or Pre-Raphaelite painting. With your locks and your mouth you look like you’ve walked straight out of a Botticelli or Burne-Jones. And as for Cubism or Dada, don’t their defenders claim they suggest a new way of perceiving the world, a new form of ‘reality’. You seemed more real to me than anybody I’d seen so far. And that was before you even opened your mouth to say something brilliant.”
John knows their tactic well. If one or two amongst the six are very, very lucky, they are going to reach the final climb still ahead of what’s going to remain of the peloton by then – probably a small group of
It was plain to see that both policemen weren’t happy about the development. In an attempt to establish his authority, the elder of them drew himself up. “What’s going on here? What’s all this with the horses? And what are all the children doing here? Don’t tell me they’re part of the grave-robbing thing as well. And who the hell are you? What’s this about ‘investigating’? You don’t look like you’re here in any official capacity,” he then enquired of Sherlock.
Sherlock laughs at this, the skin crinkling round his eyes. “When I was a child, I wanted to be a pirate.”
“Nor I,” grumbles Mr. Suffield. “All right then, Mr. Holmes. A quick look only, though, and then we’ll call the police.”
Sherlock nods. “The essentials, yes. We were about to take a look at Jenny’s room. Did you inform people at work?”
“The latter, Sam. Sherlock is struggling. He might need a replacement bike. His chain and gear shift are messed up, perhaps the brakes, too. We’ll have to split the
“Don’t you think telling you would put too much pressure on you, if you were to attempt to fulfil my fantasy?”
“I had a bad dream and couldn’t fall asleep again, and then I heard you call out and make all kinds of strange noises.”
John swallowed. Sherlock, despite being aware of the effect his looks had on people and sometimes utilising it for gathering information, at times displayed a strange awkwardness when it came to his features. John recalled an instance when he had found him in front of the mirror in the living-room studying his face from various angles and complaining it was all disproportionate. Back then they had just solved a case involving the murder of an architect which had involved poring over floor-plans and studying architectural designs based on composition principles like the golden ratio. John had shaken his head and resisted telling Sherlock that the very fact his features departed from the widely accepted formulas for rationalising ‘beauty’ made them special, striking and beautiful in their own right. The episode had made him wonder whether Sherlock had been teased for his looks as a teenager or child, along with his unusually high intelligence and social awkwardness. Sherlock never spoke about his childhood or adolescence, but what John had picked up between the lines painted a rather sad picture. Even as a youngster, his friend seemed to have been bright, sharp-witted and -tongued and brilliant. And lonely, increasingly so as he grew up, with a strong fear of abandonment which he had retained into adulthood.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, mutters something John doesn’t catch. He glances at his watch. It’s not very late yet, with dusk having fallen outside and darkness growing in the corners of the room. John is tired, but it’s too hot and muggy to attempt sleep already.
John shrugs, takes a sip from his tea and places the mug on the mantlepiece. He smiles softly. “Don’t know. Bit overwhelming, this whole day. Is this what your life is usually like?”
He withdraws his hand, considering what to do next. Whoever is lying there hasn’t reacted to his whistle nor any of his movements, meaning they’re either unconscious or dead. He extends his hand again, hovering it near the fabric. No trace of body heat, no breathing sounds. He touches the garment again, begins to carefully feel along the arm. It’s relatively thin with little obvious musculature. The sleeve reaches down to the elbow. The exposed skin below is smooth with few hairs. A woman’s arm, then. It’s as cold as the floor.
“Not that John Three-Continents-Watson noticed,” Molly went on. “Ever thought of getting together with Sarah again? I thought you made a good pair.”
Sherlock turns to him, his eyes glinting faintly in the dim light coming from the streetlamp down on the road. “It’s plain to see, John.”
Denniston takes a draught of his tea, then nods briefly at Turing who squares his shoulders. “Enigma is not the only encryption device the Germans use. It is the most widely used one, true, and the one we have found ways to cope with. But there are others, and one is still a great mystery to us.”
John stares at him incredulously. “You’ve just come out to me, sort of, told me the most outrageous thing you’ve deduced about myself, and now you’re offering to buy me a drink?”
For the downward journey they took the shorter route which led them past Beaune and right into Saint-Martin-de-la-Porte, so that in little more than three quarters of an hour they were back in Saint Michel. By then dark clouds had covered the sky entirely, the wind had picked up and it was beginning to drizzle, suffusing the air with the heady smell of petrichor. Thunder rolled in ever increasing frequency, and once John saw a lightning bolt strike the peak of the Télégraphe, causing them to hurry along the main road to their hotel, rain whipping their faces. They reached it just in time before the thunderstorm caught up with them.
Sherlock stops at the front door, also halting Vanessa’s and John’s progress with his hand. Pulling out his magnifying glass, he leans close to the letter-box.
Sadly, it was over far too soon. Just when he thought they’d finally found the right angle and Sherlock, instead of simply holding eerily still and letting himself be kissed was starting to reciprocate, John felt him tense again.
John nods thoughtfully. Something feels off about Sherlock’s disappearance. He didn’t mention any connection of the case and Harrods before. It seems unlikely, too. The museums are more probable. His meeting at the London Transport Museum could have provided a new lead. Perhaps the missing museum person was secretly selling off archaeological treasures from the museum’s archives to the department store or was working on a deal with the Victoria & Albert Museum. Still, why wouldn’t Sherlock have kept John in the loop?
Feeling keen eyes on him, Sherlock becomes aware of Mrs. Hudson giving him a shrewd look over the rim of her teacup while her sister prattles on about dancing and what she thinks of this new-fangled swing music with its jumps and bounces. “Boys tossing girls high up into the air and catching them again, and swirling them about so that their skirts fly up and everyone can see their knickers. Oh, I’m not sure if that’s good and proper. They do seem to be enjoying themselves, these young folks, as well they might, but one shouldn’t overdo it and get carried away so that they forget all propriety.”
“Sherlock, don’t,” pleads John. It’s going to hurt, if he keeps talking. John knows what he’s been doing, why he kept his thoughts and feelings bottled up. He always had to be strong. For his mum, for Harry, for his comrades in arms, for Mrs. Hudson, for his daughter. He used to be the one who had to keep things together – and keep himself from falling apart at the same time. Now, the cracks are showing, also because Sherlock is picking at them relentlessly, like a scalpel cutting away layers of rotting flesh to get at the festering wound beneath.
John returns with Mrs. Gruffudd a short while later, having settled her husband into bed after persuading him to drink plenty of water and checking him over for injuries (only a few scratches and a bruised knee from falling, as well as a lump on his head where, according to John, he was probably hit by a falling or low-hanging branch, but no signs of concussion). Mrs. Gruffudd looks relieved and thanks John profusely. Sherlock feels pride stir in him, as is always the case when John’s competence as a doctor shows.
“Yes, I stayed,” John repeated softly, running his finger along the rim of his glass. Looking up at Greg, he added, “I still don’t know why exactly he took to me the way he did – or I to him.”
Sherlock has to bite his tongue to not reveal the truth. Mary and her and John’s daughter are still alive, a fact that is being kept secret for their own safety. For the world at large, they have perished. “Yes. He is still sad about it occasionally, especially about the child.”
Feeling a sudden burst of confidence, Sherlock decides to test the waters some more. John, however, beats him to it.
Dinner is a lively affair. Team Speedy’s is not the only one accommodated at the hotel, and there is a happy mingling of riders and crew. John catches up with a few of his old teammates who are now riding for different employers. He ends up at the bar with most of his new ones (apart from Sherlock, Gregson and Dimmock), three German riders from Team Selters, and a bunch of Dutch, Belgians and Scandinavians from various teams. Even though nobody drinks any alcohol, the atmosphere soon turns jovial and rather silly when old stories are shared and new gossip is exchanged. John feels buoyed by the high spirits. This is why he loves his life as a professional cyclist, and the Tour de France in particular. The atmosphere is special, and even though there is competition among the teams and riders, knowing that all of them are in the same situation, expectant of the hardships ahead, there’s also understanding.
After inspecting the riding-crop-inflicted bruises on the body in the morgue and taking some notes, Sherlock returns to Montague Street to organise his move. He goes about it more efficiently than during the previous two times so that in the evening, he is fully settled at Baker Street without the need to spend another night at his old flat. Some members of his homeless network have been paid handsomely to see to the final cleaning and painting of the walls. He trusts them as he trusts few other people, despite the bad reputation of some of them. They’ve never let him down, knowing that he looks after them in turn – perhaps because they know that he doesn’t judge them for the way their lives have turned out to be, that he doesn’t expect them to ‘pull themselves up by their own boot-straps’. They know that but for a few different twists and turns (or resets in Sherlock’s case), he might have ended just like them.
Another shudder passes through John. He has to forcefully remind himself that this time, Sherlock is fine. A bit bashed up, true, but he’s been through far worse. They both have. It’s unlikely his injuries are life-threatening. His concussion is a mere nuisance and is going to result in a moping, sulking flatmate for a few days. The fact he sprained the wrist of his dominant hand may require John to help him with certain things such as dressing and undressing.
His hands clenched into the duvet he was lying on. “I shouldn’t have gone,” he repeated, softer now. “I knew beforehand that nothing good would come of it. Fucking selfish arseholes, the lot. I certainly didn’t need another reminder of how messed up they are.”
Sherlock frowns. “Because your wife and you asked us to come. Reluctantly in your case, I am sure. Why? Is there anything you’d like to tell me about your daughter’s disappearance? You know, in a good percentage of cases of disappearing children, a family member is behind it.”
“Not yet. Just tell him to look out for anything suspicious. By now it must be pretty obvious even to more casual viewers that there are certain teams on this Tour who are more accident-prone than others, while others benefit from this fact. Yes, accidents and technical defects always happen, but not always to the same people.”
Sherlock shifted onto his side and gave him a calculating glance. “I don’t have a lot to go on, do I?” he remarked. “It’s long ago.”
Shifting his attention back to the stage, John nods. There are some familiar faces indeed. Their captain and rider for GC, Jim Moriarty, has a bit of a reputation in the cycling world for his daring, sometimes irresponsible riding style. His number one helper, Sebastian Moran, is also a force to be reckoned with, especially in the mountains. Moriarty came third in last year’s Tour, and Moran fifth, a brilliant position for a helper and a surprise for the rest of the teams. Both riders profited from a successful breakaway in the Alps that brought up doping speculations once again (as every daring or extraordinary action in cycling does nowadays). Rumour has it that Moriarty and Moran had been unhappy with their former team and had therefore terminated their contracts mid-season. Neither rode in the Vuelta or any of the smaller races following the Tour which usually give the riders a chance to actually earn some good money. Moriarty and Moran must have used that time to find a new sponsor and shop around for riders to join their new team. John doesn’t know much about the sponsor. Some IT company, apparently, and a successful one, too. Their bikes are the latest models by a very sought after manufacturer. None of the other riders of this team is known for having aspirations apart from a stage win should the opportunity for one present itself. They have all been signed up to help Moriarty who must be hungry indeed to win this year’s Tour, to pay back Wilkes for snatching victory from him during the last time trial of last year’s race. Sholto would have been on his list of chief targets to eliminate, too, but he is out of the picture now.
Sherlock takes another sip of tea, then steeples his hands under his chin, looking at Vanessa gravely. “While he is still out, why don’t you enlighten us a little about the state of your marriage.”
“Yes, I know. Doesn’t account for all her symptoms, though,” returned Sherlock. “There must be something else.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply, nor does John expect him to. He rubs at his elbow where the healing skin has begun to itch under the fresh Spandage he has applied and shifts onto his side to lie more comfortably. “Night, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s words are echoing in John’s ears. He knows what is implied there. Sabotage. Sherlock doesn’t believe his crash was an accident, but rather manufactured. And somehow, it makes sense. So much bad luck during a stage is unusual for a team, although they’re not the only one being pursued by it. Shad Sanderson – who’ve just sped past them –have had their share as well. Shad Sanderson with their team captain Wilkes, a potential Tour winner. Team Speedy’s with their man in yellow, likely to lose his leader’s position now. It could be coincidence, of course. Streaks of disaster are not unusual in a long stage race such as the Tour. But for them to have hit these particular teams at this particular time is suspicious indeed.
Sherlock smiles. “Very likely there are, yes. But I doubt Mycroft would want them exposed – unless a public scandal is helpful to his machinations. But let’s not talk of him right now.”
“I missed your repeated stating of the obvious, too,” replies Sherlock airily, at which John cuffs him playfully and steps back.
After a brief internal discussion whether it might be wiser to leave the bicycles at the roadside, Sherlock decides to take them along, unsure if they’ll return the same way. They follow the narrow path in silence, walking their bikes in single file. It winds between young trees and hedges half shrouded in dewy cobwebs, descending gently. Threads of gossamer stretch across it and have the annoying habit of getting caught on clothes, hair and skin. The earth smells of moss and decaying plants, and of mushrooms. Sherlock things he can detect a faint carrion tang of stinkhorns from the direction of the copse.
John shook his head, grinning. “You really missed out on a career as a professional pick-pocket,” he observed.
“Well, we were working and honestly we weren’t paying a lot of attention to what was passing outside. But we’d have heard if a car had arrived, or even if somebody had walked in front of the house because the flint is so noisy. The only creature outside was Lizzy, and only briefly, too.”
Sherlock makes a face. “Yes, I did. It was informative. Wiggins has indeed contacted him. Mycroft didn’t want to divulge what exactly they discussed, but apparently they’ve cooked up something to help Wiggins get out of his team without losing his life. I wouldn’t be surprised if Wiggins crashed tomorrow and was forced to abandon the Tour.”
It didn’t work. John’s body refused to obey this simple command – or rather, it was not in a position to obey. The reason for that, John realised when his brain had accelerated to working speed, were about six feet and twelve stone of consulting detective draped over him. One of Sherlock’s long arms had securely pinned John’s arms to his sides, their legs were tangled, and there was a warm, moist spot between John’s left ear and shoulder where Sherlock’s nose and mouth rested, continually fanned by deep exhales of breath that tickled the sensitive skin on John’s neck.
He gives her a nod and picks up his spoon again, overhearing Molly’s pink friend mutter in her Welsh lilt clearly loud enough from him to hear, “He is a bit of a freak, isn’t he? Sorry for persuading you to ask him. That’s codebreakers for you. All brains and no balls. Believe me, I know. Don’t recognise a pretty gal when she’s dancing naked in front of them. At least this one knows how to put on his trousers the right way round. But hey, don’t be sad. My friend Jim, he has a good-looking mate who’s in the army and on leave at the moment. I’ll ask him to bring him round when I meet him tonight. You’ll like him. And oh hello, what this? Nice uniform, don’t you think, and the contents aren’t too bad, either. Shame about the limp, but hey, the rest certainly makes up for it.”
The question remains, though, why Nora Perkins was killed, and why Sherlock has been incapacitated and left with her, perhaps to perish, too. If Brompton Road Station is owned privately now, it’s very probable the new owner doesn’t want people to sniff around the place. He, or rather someone working for him. Sherlock seems to recall that there was something about the Ukrainian’s permission to travel that was off. He wasn’t allowed into the country, or to leave his present abode, couldn’t obtain a visa. Something along those lines. Perhaps during his absence, criminal elements began using the station for their own purposes.
Sherlock heaves a sigh. “Well, I hate to admit it, but you are right. While the microscope would be nice, I think your hand will have to do tonight.”
John turns round and sorts through the first aid kit while Sherlock strips down to his vest and drawers, depositing the soiled trousers and the shirt over the rim of the bathtub. John looks around for a place to sit, and finds a low stool under the sink. He sits down, then beckons to Sherlock.
“I’ve been wondering about that, actually. How on earth did you know that there’s an imminent delivery for someone on Magnussen’s team?”
for a while, providing everybody on the team with extra water and energy bars. Anderson who is riding next to John when Sherlock hands him another bottle regards his teammate with raised eyebrows.
he wonders. Are there still residual hormones in his bloodstream that cause this mild euphoria? Next to him, John is smiling, too, so he must be afflicted in the same way.
“I do. Lie down. But remember, tell me if I do things you don’t like. I can stop any time, and I will, if you want me to.”
“Or because I have changed my mind about my previous offer of you sharing my bedroom? Don’t be ridiculous, John. Since we’ll be leaving for my parents’ tomorrow morning, you can leave it where it is, or put it in my room to get your essentials for tonight. Toothbrush, pyjamas ...”
“Yes. Or he went to Moran’s estate near Buckingham. Not a long drive, and he is bound to know his way around the place. I need to telephone Molly.”
When John has finally settled, lying heavy and warm in Sherlock’s arms, his breaths deep and even in sleep, fanning over Sherlock’s collar-bones and tickling his throat, Sherlock devotes the remainder of the night to committing everything there is to know about John to memory again. He restructures and fortifies the parts of his mind palace dedicated to John Watson to make sure he’s never going to forget a single detail about this remarkable man.
As usual, John is interested and asks several informed questions. “You’ve been here before, I take it?”
“Indeed I do.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he gave John a long, calculating glance. “You’re in excellent form today,” he said quietly and appreciatively.
“But you’re right,” she gazed at Sherlock. “Things between us are tense at the moment. Andrew’s death hit her badly – both of us, in fact. She’s withdrawn from me, spends most of her time in her room or with our neighbours’ horses. That, in fact, is the one thing that seems to be keeping us together at the moment: our mutual love for horses. It’s what made us bond in the first place, you see. So when two of our neighbours’ animals died, one shortly after another, Emma was deeply upset. One had been her favourite and she had helped groom it and prepare it for shows for a while now, and was even present when that particular mare’s latest foal was born this spring. Our neighbours breed Suffolk Punches, you must know. They have a considerably large farm and stud, and they also train the horses to pull vehicles and work the fields. Sometimes they’re used for period films or commercials, or educational material. They also have some Icelandic horses for riding and produce cider from ecologically grown apples. Emma spends most of her free time at their place and loves the animals dearly. She wants to be a vet some day – well, that’s her emergency plan anyway if being named the first person to fly to Mars doesn’t work out. So you can imagine her and mine and our neighbours’ shock when in the span of about a month two of their most valuable Punches – their stallion and the prize mare – were found dead in the stables.”
“Moriarty profited from a clever breakaway last year,” says Sherlock, “helped by the fact that after remodelling himself from a Spring Classics expert to a GC-rider for longer stage races as well as a mountain goat, and arriving with a new and completely reorganised team, nobody really knew what to expect of him. He won’t be able to count on the element of surprise this year. He’s made his intention of winning this Tour very clear.”
John snorted, glaring at the other. “Don’t let Sherlock hear this. He doesn’t think he and cute should be mentioned in the same sentence, at least not without a negation. At age four he apparently took down a woman for calling him ‘cute little angel’ by deducing her and her husband mercilessly. Which doesn’t mean he can’t be cute or adorable when he remembers to switch off his ego for a moment and just be himself. I will absolutely treasure the kitten shot.”
He leaned in, but in that moment Sherlock twitched and slapped the back of his own neck with his flat hand. John jerked back in surprise, giving his friend a bewildered glance when he stretched out his hand to reveal a flattened horsefly, resplendent in a splatter of blood. Sherlock looked from the squashed insect to John, his expression a mixture of annoyance, irritation, embarrassment and a tiny trace of relief – feelings John shared in that moment.
Sherlock shrugs. “A little.” He notices the glance Lestrade exchanges with John, and wonders what John told him about Sherlock’s state.
“All of them, obviously. Stephen and Harry are brilliant sprinters, they could win all the intermediate sprints on a stage while riding in a breakaway. Philip could do the same for the mountain classification on a hilly stage. Kit is a good allrounder and being so young, he’s hot and eager for a stage win, same as Josh and Jonathan. And as for our newest teammate, Hol— Sherlock, I recall that he’s an excellent time trialist. They always fare well in breakaways, since they’re used to riding alone in the wind for long stretches. Sherlock is our joker, I’d say. It’s good to have him on our team as well.”
“Hope this hotel has good sound insulation,” muses John. Sherlock only laughs. “Who cares. I will play something soothing. Any particular wishes?”
and what hangers-on manage to follow the punishing pace is soon stretched along the road, the riders almost going in single file.
, ask whether he is a traitor and Nazi sympathiser, the third wonders whether he’s been wrongfully accused by ‘a sleazy private detective and his special associate, both confirmed bachelors’.
He also thinks about his encounter with Mycroft Holmes, his mention of an overdose. That’s a conversation for another day.
“Of course. At first I thought Mrs. Hudson might have taken them to get them cleaned, or treated for moths or something. But since she’s been away all this time ... To be honest, I wouldn’t have put it beyond you to, you know, use them for experiments or something. Douse them with acid or burn them.”
Charles Remington seems similarly thoughtful, even contrite, when they meet him later at Mayfield. Unlike the farmer, he does look a little worse for wear: pale and shaky, his face and hands covered in small cuts and abrasions from where he ploughed through dense, thorny undergrowth in his panic. He, too, has a light cold, as well as a twisted ankle, which has him hobbling around on crutches, his foot bandaged to stabilise it. He, too, seems surprised, even touched by the fact that so many people spent half the night searching for him – and in such nasty, even dangerous weather.
“Yes. But I’m glad you do.” John swallows, scoots closer to Sherlock and rests his head against his chest. It feels a little strange to be the smaller spoon, but not as strange as he thought it would. “And I’m glad we finally got here. I’m aware we’ve only known each other for little more than a fortnight. It feels longer, though, like I’ve known you for ages. I don’t believe in fate and soulmates and all that—”
Now Sherlock laughed, too. “Tempting suggestion, but it’s unlikely to terminate his stay. Mrs. Hudson has been around to light a fire and she’ll have brought him tea and biscuits.”
John watches Sherlock who has sat up, his shoulders squared and his spine straight. The gaze he bestows upon Greg is calculating. It almost looks as if a battle is fought, until Sherlock casts down his eyes and inclines his head. “Understood.”
Sherlock laughs, swinging their joined hands playfully between them. “Of course. The podium would be nice, but even that would be much better than anything I expected to win here.” He turns to John and adds in a low, intense voice, “And I certainly didn’t expect to win you, John Watson. You’re the greatest prize of all.”
“Is she?” growls Sherlock before he can stop himself. Mary winks at him, completely misunderstanding his reaction. “See you around, Sherlock,” she says, before resting her head on David’s shoulder again and letting him whisk her away into another turn.
Sherlock smiles, despite his nerves. He licks his lips, slowly and deliberately, hoping the signal he is sending is clear.
When the piece is finished, he lifts his head and claps. “Beautiful,” he says appreciatively. “But then, I expected nothing less from you.”
Sherlock only frowned as he donned his coat and wrapped the scarf round his neck before flipping up the collar. John shook his head. “It was kind of you to give some to Molly, although she seemed a little irritated by the gesture.”
“It all went pear-shaped when I was nine,” Sherlock said into the companionable silence that had fallen between them. “There were discussions about sending me to Harrow a year early. I didn’t want to go because I associated the place with Mycroft going away. Mummy was against it, too. I had noticed that she and father had drifted apart increasingly, and that there were more open conflicts – always polite, always controlled in conduct, but all the sharper and more cutting in their choices of words. I was glad for every moment I was allowed to spend at granny’s, but even there things weren’t like they had been. She was increasingly unwell. She tried to hide it from Edward and me, but, well, I deduced more than I should have. When I confronted my parents and particularly mother with what I had found out, she eventually told me that granny had cancer and was not expected to live until Christmas. And she was right. Granny passed away in the autumn of that year, her health reclining rapidly despite additional surgery and radio- and chemotherapy. I was assured everything had been tried to help her, and later to at least alleviate her suffering, but part of me always thought more could have been done. Mummy clearly thought so as well, given that her research lies in that direction. Her mother’s death was a severe blow to her, but being the way she is she attempted to cope on her own, and expected everybody else to do so, too.”
“Yes, you can bet on that, Mr. Detective,” rages her father, batting away John’s hand as he tries to inspect a lump on his head, while his wife tries to wrap the foil blanket around him. “We’ve been under attack from lunatics. They hate us and want us gone. They want to ruin us, the fuckers. But my family has been here for generations. The hippies and witches can go and fuck themselves. They’ve tried petitions, they’ve tried bullying campaigns, they’ve tried denigrating us with the authorities and those animal-protection idiots, and now they’re resorting to dark magic. I know it, I know it, I—”
Sherlock talked about these questions with his brother, he only person he trusts enough to not declare him insane right on the spot. But Mycroft told him that he had no recollection of the other timeline, the one where Sherlock fell off the tree in their grandparents’ garden, apart from a diffuse sense of déjá vu right after. Still, Sherlock wonders if these other variations of people affected by the reset, the versions of Mycroft, Lestrade and John, of Victor and his fellow students at Harrow and Cambridge just carry on in their alternative universes, and if a version of himself stays there, too. In several scenarios, he knows he’s dead by now. Or is there just one reality, and he has this special ability to move back in time, a blessing and a curse both? It’s aggravating that there are no real studies about this phenomenon, no science to fall back on. There are no logical explanations. Sherlock is a scientist. He relies on those. He doesn’t believe in fate or the supernatural. And yet ...
“You best go to bed right away,” Aunt Mabel says. “After a good wash, of course. The boys will stay up to watch a video film.
work – with John this time round. Should he reply differently if they do end up at Angelo’s again and John proceeds with his interrogation? And would he be willing to go through with potential consequences? John had barely known him then – and barely knows him now – so it couldn’t have been love that made him inquire after Sherlock’s dating preferences. It was physical attraction, probably, mixed with a certain awe and admiration and the spice of a hint of danger. Was John really after something lasting or simply a quick shag? Sherlock knows he definitely doesn’t want the latter, not if it’s a casual thing. On the other hand ... given the chance of spending one night with John Watson ... it’s not that he hasn’t fantasised about it. John is the only person he has ever met with whom he can actively picture himself having sex at all and not be revolted by it. He tries not to, though, or not too much, at least, because that way frustration and heartbreak lie. Unless the switch back has opened up an opportunity now ...
She takes a look at the muddy carnage of sugar beets and torn up earth and shrugs. “If there was anything else, it’s been ploughed under, I’d say. But feel free to have a look around, if you fancy getting yourself all muddy. I’m going to help Linda harness the horses to the cart again and then we can return to the farm.”
And now here he was, seeking refuge in John’s bed, his face buried in John’s pillow, obviously comforted by the familiar scent. John felt his heart clench as he watched him, a wave of fondness surging through him. This was Sherlock Holmes, brilliant, singular, the only consulting detective in the world because he invented the job, a proper genius, hugging his best friend’s and potential lover’s pillow like a stuffed toy. John felt the acute urge to run his fingers through Sherlock’s wild curls and draw him close.
There’s some hugging and congratulating Daniel (Sherlock manages to avoid having to hug him, and their handshake is very brief with minimal touching), then Daniel tears into his presents, while Christopher, more practically minded, stealthily helps himself to an early slice of cake while the others are fawning about the gifts. Sherlock wolfs down two sandwiches and half a pint of milk before he wipes his mouth with his arm and announces he’s off to Ellie’s. This elicits a nod from Aunt Mabel, a frown from his uncle and a shrewd look from Christopher – Daniel and Tom are too engrossed in a large parcel containing more loopings for his Carrera track – and then Sherlock is dashing upstairs to fetch his rucksack, and two minutes later is out of the house.
John went up to the barricade, rubbing Tjálga’s head when the mare brushed against him amicably. “Perhaps they were the people with the lights the Naylands talked about. Wonder what they’re doing here. Isn’t this still the Millers’ property?”
“You’re very welcome to stay here, John and Sherlock,” said Susan. “As you know, our guest rooms are being refurbished right now, but I’m sure we can find something.”
“What do you mean, you’re an expert?” demands John when Sherlock returns, now dressed in threadbare jeans, an ancient University of Cambridge t-shirt and trainers.
Freak’. Even when he had won the White Jersey for the best young rider, a more than respectable fourth place in the overall classification which took everybody by complete surprise, the animosity hadn’t abated. On the contrary, in some circles of the peloton, it had even increased. John still wonders whether this contributed to what had happened next. Every newspaper must have run the story back then: Sherlock Holmes’ fall from grace. Doping, drugs ... nobody seemed to know for sure, but everybody of course had an opinion. Holmes had never ridden a professional race again after that, had disappeared. Even though they’d never actually exchanged a word during their one Tour de France together, now and again over the years John wondered what had happened to Sherlock Holmes, who’d once claimed in one of his rare interviews that he cycled because he liked it, because it “stopped all the noise in his head and helped him think”. This remark had struck a chord with John back then, he’d sympathised deeply with the idea, because most of the time, John feels exactly the same.
He hands it to Sherlock, leaning in even more closely so that his shoulder rubs against Sherlock’s, who has to pull himself together not to erupt in a happy smile. The photograph shows Moran standing with his friends again, a dark (probably red) carpet under their feet. Mr. Swastika pin is in the foreground, shaking hands with ... Sherlock looks more closely. The man looks eerily familiar.
John looks at him with an expression which Sherlock finds difficult to define. Fond, might be the right term.
John breathes a sigh of relief. Warmth spreads through him at realising how much his teammates have embraced Sherlock despite his prickliness. They really consider him part of the team now. John is touched and happy.
This chapter should have been finished and posted weeks ago, but sadly Real Life interfered on a massive scale. But at least the boys are in Suffolk now, and I hope the next chapter won't take that long to write. Thanks to all who bear with this story.
John laughs. “Right, yes, of course, your leg. Come on, lean on me. No need to further upset your leg, right? Also, if it’s true and somebody spotted us, we can always claim I was assisting you.”
John could not recall what had woken him. He had dreamt, but the dream had been merely strange, involving the mysterious package Mrs. Hudson had mentioned in the phone-call. It had been neither frightening nor upsetting like so many of his dreams. Nevertheless, he was startled into wakefulness, realising he could not have slept more than a few hours.
Sherlock shrugs. “They aren’t very bright, certainly. I wonder where exactly they encountered Nora. One of her shoes lay further up the tunnel and what I could feel of the way the blood had flown over her face from her head-wound indicated that, she, too, had been carried a considerable way. I agree with you, depositing us at the furthest end of the tunnel makes no sense, unless they were planning to somehow open the metal door I told you about and carry us onto the tracks. During the night when the Piccadilly Line isn’t running, they could have carried us to one of the nearby stations and placed us on the tracks to make it look like a suicide. Maybe that was the plan, before their ‘boss’ demanded to talk to me.”
Daniel’s eyes narrow with what Sherlock reads as suspicion, but then he nods and dashes off. Sherlock is left with John and Ellie, who has watched the exchange with interest and, again, barely concealed amusement.
The ‘interrogation’ over, Linda rose and invited them to have a look at the beehives behind the house. Taking a last gulp of his tea, John followed her and Sherlock through the back door into a large garden studded with fruit trees and berry-bushes. As in Katie’s garden, there was an area designated to vegetables, the rest resembled a meadow. Only around the trees the grass had been mown, likely to make harvest easier. In most other places, grasses and wildflowers had been allowed to grow and go to seed, resulting in a varied meadow with all kinds of stalky pods and coloured leaves bearing witness of a past summer, gossamer threads and cobwebs glinting between them during brief spells of sunlight.
“Thanks. But you didn’t answer my initial question. Why? Why does it interest you? What I feel? What may or may not be troubling me?”
Sherlock looked at him before his brows knotted in frown. He cocked his head, his expression turning thoughtful as if he was remembering something. “Tasted?” he asked quietly.
He gives the others a questioning glance, before taking in Jim’s pale countenance. “All right, Jimmy?” he asks concernedly.
Shutting the car door and inconspicuously adjusting the gun in his waistband, John followed the others towards the larger of the stables, Lizzy the dog trotting next to him. He reached out to scratch her head which she seemed to appreciate.
Moving his chair closer to Sherlock’s and leaning towards him, “Did you get anywhere with the strange message?” he asks in a low voice.
“Died in the war?” asks John as he steers Sherlock over to the desk in front of the large windows overlooking the southernmost edge of Russell Square. Sherlock nods.
Sherlock beams at him. “Sentiment, of course. As I said, it must have been a memento, or rather, a token of love. Jenny lend it to someone dear to her and retained it in its used state, or else it belonged to someone else all along, they used it and Jenny secretly kept without the person knowing, to be reminded of them and time spent together. Isn’t that what people do when they’re in love? Isn’t it considered romantic?”
“You can always come back and stay here, you know,” says Ellie. “In case you don’t want to stay at your cousins’. You’re a great help round the house.” She grins at him, her eyes twinkling.
John’s own teammates look grim and defiant. Lyons and Bainbridge seem the most motivated. Both survived the crash unscathed and are hoping to finally win a stage in a sprint finish. Sherlock has been whisked away to sign jerseys again. John watches him stand next to Kit, Trevor and the chap in the polka-dot jersey. Sherlock and Trevor are ignoring each other again, and are even being kept so far apart that conversation is impossible. John thinks it’s for the best, and wonders whether Anthea has had her hand in this arrangement. PR people of all three teams are nearby, and when reporters attempt to descend on both Sherlock and Victor, Anthea and the press manager of Trevor’s team CS Media step forward and take over. To his surprise, John is accosted by two journalists as well, one from
announces Sherlock’s mind before it switches to cataloguing the fascinating new data coming in. John’s hand is in his nape, pulling his head forward and tilting it slightly so that their noses don’t collide. John’s lips begin to move softly against his own. Sherlock can faintly taste toothpaste, and an underlying aroma that hints at several hours of sleep. It’s a little stale, but not uncomfortably so. If Sherlock tastes the same, John doesn’t seem to mind. John’s lips are firm and narrow, a little chapped. They’re very careful, even a little hesitant, in the way they press to Sherlock’s and then relent, only to move in again a moment later. Eventually, there is some light nibbling. Sherlock approves. Somebody makes a low sound, almost like a growl. Sherlock realises it might have been him, because he feels one corner of John’s mouth twitch up in a smile. He moves forward, pulling Sherlock to him. The pressure of his lips becomes firmer, surer. Sherlock feels stubble on his upper lip. He opens his mouth slightly to mimic John’s nibbling. Now John makes a sound. Sherlock makes a mental note that apparently John enjoys what he’s doing. It bolsters his confidence, and encourages him to continue.
His heart beating fiercely, he rounds the fence and sprints across the street. The door is shut. He curses under his breath. Just his luck. Casting a quick glance about to make sure no passers by are aware of him, he presses his ear to the black-painted wood. Dimly, he can hear the two men’s voices, getting softer as they are walking away from the door. Inspecting the lock, he wonders if he could force it open somehow without having to shoot it, which would be counterproductive in many regards. Not for the first time, he wishes he had Sherlock’s lock-pick tools and skill in that department, and vows to ask him for a training session or two.
“We cannot be sure yet,” replies Sherlock, again not mentioning the cyanide. “Doubtlessly, there will be an investigation.”
“Has the value of the land changed in any way, apart from the normal increase in property prices you described?” asked Sherlock.
“Oh, and Miss Riley,” his expression sharpens as he pins her with a keen glance, “I strongly resent your thinly veiled insinuations that my ‘excellent shape’ has been brought on by illegal means. I am very aware of what you’ve written about me in the past. But you’ve seen my records, my stats and everything. They show I am riding clean.”
Daniel has been watching them with a curious expression, then, rubbing the back of his neck, steps in front of Sherlock. Straightening up and letting out a long breath, “Thank you,” he says. He looks embarrassed and distinctly uncomfortable.
Sherlock shrugs. “That’s what he said. He implied something along those lines during our conversation yesterday as well, if you recall. And wouldn’t it be better for one’s reputation if one left when one was on top of one’s game, instead of slowly dwindling into obscurity?
John pressed a kiss to his forehead. “All right, not yet.” Drawing back a little to be able to look at Sherlock, he studied him to gauge his state. In the growing light of dawn, he looked rather dishevelled with his hair a dark mess starkly contrasted against the white pillow. His cheeks, throat and chest were still flushed. There was a faint bruise near the mole next to his Adam’s apple where John had sucked a little too vigorously. His lips were swollen, the skin surrounding them slightly irritated from John’s stubble. His eyes were half closed, heavy-lidded and lacking their usual keen focus. He looked utterly relaxed, almost melted into his pillow. Only the slightest of frownlines on his forehead indicated that he seemed to be engaged in some serious thinking.
John chuckles. “Well, none of your fantasies sound very arousing, the music thing aside, perhaps. You really compose when you wank? That’s ... something. Wonder what the music sounds like.”
Sherlock thinks of the rows of garbled letters he deals with on a daily basis, and the special message Jennifer Wilson discovered and which may help turn the tides in this conflict. But victory, that much he knows, is not going to happen over night. Most probably, war will drag on for years yet.
“I’m fine,” said Sherlock, but he did lay both hands into John’s and let him rub them gently. “I left in such a hurry this morning that I forgot the gloves, and it was freezing in that cellar where they stored the flowers.”
Lestrade sighed dramatically. “So it seems. Pity he’s playing for the dark side. But I’d be damned if Sally wasn’t going to try and beat him still. Look at her. That man’s in for trouble.”
“We did,” says Turing. “We read their communications for a few days, and more importantly solved their
“Later, Mrs. Hudson,” promises Sherlock. “Something has come up that needs our immediate attention.”
With some well-aimed deductions accompanied by icy glares from Sherlock and John they scare off a group of German tourists and so manage to secure a cable car gondola for the three of them only. Wiggins is fidgety and keeps looking over his shoulders nervously.
“Bad luck, but probable, if he was careless enough to navigate the dangerous staircase with an open knife in his hands.”
Gwendolen sighs and runs a hand through her hair. “The thing is ... I don’t really believe any of them would actually steal or hurt our animals, or even try to destroy our cars. They’re not ... evil people. Neither are we, of course. We’re just ... our goals in life and plans for this community don’t match.”
What was more, throughout the film Sherlock was uncharacteristically quiet, and not just because his mouth was full of pastry or tea for a considerable amount of time. There was only a bare minimum of critical comments, no typing or reading on either phone or laptop for a distraction. Sherlock seemed truly captivated by the film. He burst out laughing when Gordie Lachance told the tale of Lardass and the blueberry pie contest that ended in the entire congregation puking all over each other, he gripped the union jack pillow in agitation when the boys were crossing the railroad viaduct and Vern was having his panic attack in the face of a train approaching, he scrunched up his face when the boys emerged from the forest pond with leeches all over them. John who had seen the film on several occasions and knew about its ending watched him sidelong when the four boys were on their way back to Castle Rock after having found and defended the body of Ray Brower, and the narrator was outlining how the characters fared after the summer ended and they headed off to different schools. John had always found the ending touching in its mixture of nostalgia and melancholia, relating to things every adolescent experienced, namely the passing of childhood and the slow decay of friendships over time.
John laughs softly. “Sounds great.” His hand is still cupping Sherlock’s cheek. “About the kissing ...”
“Just out of interest, how does me wearing jumpers make me look the ‘marrying type’, whatever that is?” he enquired.
“Yes, I did love her,” she admits plainly. “And yes, I considered it serious, or genuine, rather. Those relationships I entertain with men ... they aren’t real. They are perfunctory. Enjoyable, too, sometimes, if they aren’t complete morons. Some can be attentive and considerate. Some are rather good lovers. But most of all, my dealings with them are lucrative. A woman has to live, after all, and a war like this is not very conducive to making a living by one’s artistic skills alone. But whenever I date men, my heart is rarely in it.”
“Well, and special guests, I daresay,” says Sherlock airily, nodding towards The Woman’s door. “Or am I mistaken that Miss Adler is currently entertaining a Naval officer?”
Sherlock steps over, looks into the car, then stoops and picks up something from under the driver’s seat. He returns to Wilson and holds out the item to her. Smiling grimly, Jennifer Wilson takes the pink phone. She watches Sherlock, her eyes slightly narrowed. “Thank you once again. You interfered just in time. But who are you, and how did you know about the cabbie?”
“In fact,” Lestrade claps his hands, smiling at his team, “we don’t really have problems. Boys, you have been doing spectacularly well this first week. We could go home now and would have achieved more than other teams manage to over the entire season. We’ve had a man in every special jersey of this Tour, even yellow, and two of them are still on your shoulders. That’s absolutely brilliant. There are still two hard weeks ahead, and much can happen. But let’s not worry about them tonight, yeah? You’ve really earned your rest day. I know that some of you chaps have family and friends visiting, so enjoy the time with them.”
He deliberately steps on a twig to alert the girl to his presence. She looks up, wipes at her eyes, then points at the dog. “He wouldn’t come when I called him,” she says miserably.
“No, just mount. The height of the saddle should be right for you. You can regulate the amount of electrical assistance here.”
Molly put in a word for him in the end. She even volunteered to stay after her shift to help him in the lab, relaxing the tense situation with her colleagues immediately and earning her a brief hug from an exhausted and completely lost in his mind Sherlock, and a promise of eternal gratitude and dinner at a venue of her choice from John.
He’s kept it in there ever since their visit to Chanctonbury Ring in Sussex a month ago. Well, at least they left him that. A small mercy. It means a lot to him, but nothing to his captors. The thought that they could have taken it and simply thrown it away sends another wave of nausea through him. Sentiment. Dangerous. But here, lost in the dark, with his trusty brain in horrible disarray, isn’t it logical that his baser functions would take over? He grips the small stone and draws it from the pocket. Perhaps his captors should have taken it, too. Flint splinters can be extremely sharp. Not very bright of them to leave it with him. If push came to shove, he could crack the stone and use the remains for weapons. As of course he would, sentiment be damned.
“Take them off, please,” groans John, watching him with dark, hungry eyes. Sherlock nods, cursing his fingers which are trembling slightly as he begins to undo the buttons. Eventually, impatience wins over and he nudges John to lift his hips so that he can strip the offending garment off. Then he sits and stares. At the same time, he berates himself for doing so. After all, it’s not the first penis he sees. He’s got one himself, he went to public school where there were shared facilities for showering. One can hardly avoid seeing other men’s genitalia at public lavatories when they stand and piss next to oneself. He’s seen plenty of pictures and photographs, some of murder victims, and some depictions of a pornographic nature.
Sherlock grins at him excitedly, leaping to his feet and beginning to pace the floor in front of the beds. “I didn’t pay enough attention to it back when we found her – unforgiveable, really, but not even I get everything right all the time. There was a small lipstick stain on the collar of her jacket, close to her ear. I seem to recall that a tiny spot was on her earlobe as well. And it wasn’t pink. That’s why I noticed it at all, although I didn’t understand its significance back then, being distracted by the cause of her death and her message. But the reason I saw the stain at all was because it wasn’t pink, thus contrasting the fabric of the garment.”
“Dr. Hensley would know about those,” mused Katie, her cheeks flushed and her eyes bright with excitement.
He gazes at Sherlock, his eyes hard. “Because I thought I could have both. Because I was selfish. I tried to justify it by telling myself that you’d hurt me, and so I kept you at arm’s length. We reconciled without really talking, and then we reverted back to a facsimile of what we had been, only with Mary as an addition. I thought I’d hit the jackpot, you see? I had her, a happy domestic life, and I had you back, and we went on to solve cases and have our little adventures together. But it was all a lie. Because she lied to me, much more than you had ever done. And she did it for selfish reasons, whereas you lied to protect your friends. You planned our bloody wedding, and she shot you in the chest. And then, after you’d flat-lined – fuck, Sherlock, do you have any idea how close you came to dying for real? – after all you’d gone through already, you went and shot Magnussen to make sure Mary was safe, and told me to forgive her and return to her, because that’s what you believed I wanted. Only, you didn’t do it for her, did you?”
“John.” As if on cue, Sherlock’s voice sounds from the bathroom. John jumps in shock, hastily grabbing a large mug from the cupboard over the sink and dashing back.
Have they just left him here for dead, too? Why tie him up, then? Do they plan to come back? Interrogate him? Kill him off for good? How long has he been sitting here? Has he wasted valuable time, perhaps, time he should have utilised to work on his escape? Is there even a route of escape? Or is he completely at his captors’ mercy?
“I don’t know if it was the same car. But this one seems to have stopped here for a moment. And the marks are fresh, not a day old or the ridges between the imprints of the profile would have dried out more. Look, they’re only just beginning to lighten. Likely, the mark was made during the night when the air was humid because of the mist, which would have been thicker than now. As you can see, the grass is still covered in dew in places where the sun hasn’t reached it yet.”
“Would the person who administered the poison be able to stick around unnoticed to make sure the animals ate enough of it to actually die?” mused John, stepping closer to Sherlock and stealing a glance at the report. “If they ... don’t know, prepared some treats and fed them by hand, not many traces would remain that even a thorough search of the stalls could unearth.”
Katie sighed, brushing a curly strand of hair behind her ear as she rose to fetch coffee, a bowl, mug and spoon, and made toast. “I really hope things will improve and you’ll find the foal soon. Emma’s completely out of sorts because of its disappearance, and I fear that the distraction will manifest itself in a lack of interest in school. She used to struggle a little in the past, but things were getting better earlier this year, before Rædwald was killed.”
“Here they come.” Sherlock’s low voice breaks through his reverie. Together, they watch Wilkes and Trevor approach. Both are dressed casually but smarter than John, who feels a little underdressed in jeans and shirt while the other three are wearing nice suit trousers, fitted shirts and jackets.
poisoned. There is no good pill. Somehow, Hope has made himself immune, possibly has an antidote on him or has even swallowed it pre-emptively. That’s how he always wins. Sherlock gazes towards John, nods to signal to him that he understands. That was the missing piece, the one bit of information that had eluded him before. Strangely, he never asked for a toxicology report of Hope’s body in the past. After all, the cause of death had clearly been a gunshot wound. And of course, it took John, Sherlock’s conductor of light, to make the solution to this particular riddle visible.
Dimly, just on the edge of consciousness, Sherlock feels John’s breath ghost over the skin of his face, followed by his fingers at his throat, searching for a pulse.
“I care about some people,” returns Sherlock, his eyes switching to John before he can prevent it. He is sure Daniel notices, and so does John, but he decides he doesn’t mind. “And I can return the compliment, I guess. I always believed you were a stupid, brainless bully who got worse when he was trying to impress his friends – morons such as your cousin Tom. But your daughter adores you, and she’s highly intelligent and observant so I trust her judgement. You can be much less of a macho arsehole when you want to be.”
The two sisters exchange a glance and a smile. “We’re just glad to have the two of you back in one piece, dear,” says Mrs. Hudson. “And national heroes, too, from what the papers say. That Lord Moran, he seems to be a nasty chap. And that man, Brook, who attacked poor Miss Connolly ... Knocked out with a shovel. Good riddance, I say.”
“We did, yes. We don’t have a warrant as yet. There were no grounds on which to issue one, meaning we have to be careful. His manservant was vague about his whereabouts. But even I could tell he was lying on the telephone, so I decided we would pay the gentleman a visit regardless. I have a feeling that Mr. Moran has been avoiding us, and I’d like to learn the reason for it.”
When he has tied the new bandage to John’s satisfaction, John looks up at him. Sherlock notices that his pupils are dilated, too. He swallows when he sheds his jacket, gets rid of his tie and begins to unbutton his waistcoat, all the time aware of John’s eyes on him. He wonders why he feels so nervous now. John has seen him in his underwear before and hasn’t run away screaming. On the contrary, he has repeatedly told Sherlock that he liked what he saw. Perhaps it’s because of the setting. Having John here in his old room seems far more intimate than a shared room at an inn, or the bathroom of an enemy’s house. Or perhaps it’s because of their encounter in the alley. The stakes have been raised. Both of them have made their intentions clear.
“I’ve seen it already,” says Sherlock, and grabbing his rucksack, dashes off towards Ellie’s house. He knocks on the front door and waits. Nothing happens. He knocks again, before stepping over to the living room window to gaze inside. What he can see of the room behind the curtains is dark. Despite the gloomy weather, no lights are on, nor is any glow of the television visible. Sherlock sighs. Returning to the front door, he opens the letterbox to gaze through. The hall is dark, too.
The photo, reminiscent in composition and framing of Robert Doisneau’s famous shot of two lovers kissing in front of the Paris city hall in the 1950s showed Sherlock and him, well, kissing. Sherlock had surprised him by grabbing his shoulder and pressing him against his body, even bending him slightly backwards, and snogging the living daylights out of him. It had been spontaneous, surprising, embarrassing because of the audience of Molly Hooper, Sally Donovan and forensic expert Nikhita Vathijanathar. Sherlock had simply wanted to express his delight about a remark of John’s which had led to an important clue in the investigation, not considering that their relationship had only one day previously advanced into kissing territory and that they had not discussed about how and when to go public.
Sherlock stilled the hand which had been on its stealthy way towards the waistband of John’s pyjama bottoms. He made a questioning sound. “Anything funny?” he asked, not quite hiding his insecurity.
Even though he thought he had braced himself for this very question, when it is asked, Sherlock feels at a loss for words. He swallows, blinks a few times, looks everywhere but at John. Eventually, he clears his throat. “Love is a chemical defect,” he says, his voice rough.
“Am I?” enquired Sherlock, pressing closer and lifting his head from John’s shoulder to gaze at him. “Says he who loathes to talk about anything even remotely personal and who usually keeps his private thoughts and feelings under lock and key.”
She shrugs, gathering together her things. “Just ... he couldn’t have been more obvious, could he,” she says quietly. “Remember what I said, John. I suspect he’s a complete idiot when it comes to romance, worse than you, in fact. But did you notice his reaction? He was totally distracted by half your arse hanging out of your pants, but was too shy and awkward to even enquire how you were doing.”
Her eyes narrow as she watches him. She re-folds her gloves. “Why do you need to know?” she asks at length.
The landscape certainly added to the peculiar atmosphere of the ride. It reminded John of romanticist paintings, shaped as it was by grazing animals with its cropped, flowery grass and the almost orderly thickets of small birches, large lichen-grown boulders like landmarks set between them, and smaller stones piled by generations of farmers to low walls and narrow huts to serve as shelter for lifestock and shepherds. A pastoral, peaceful landscape like an intricate landscape garden, but it had a haunting, slightly dishevelled touch to it. Now and again larger houses were visible between the trees, but they were deserted, empty shells with dark holes for windows in the thick walls, their roofs long collapsed, saplings growing from the rotting wood. The stonewalls were overgrown by trailing plants, and here and there patches of sheep-wool had caught in barbed wire or the low-hanging branches of trees and were swaying, wraith-like, in the faint breeze.
“Yes, of course. You don’t think my parents were rich enough to afford to pay exorbitant school fees for both their sons at the same time, do you? Both had sufficient incomes and we were certainly considered well off, but we weren’t rich. My paternal grandparents were, but they hadn’t approved of my father’s choice of spouse and withdrawn their support early on, and they were certainly not going to pay for my schooling if my grades didn’t justify it.”
Tiffany nods, finally finishing her scone and washing it down with a huge swallow of cocoa. “Just don’t make the mistake and get married. Because if you don’t, you can’t get divorced later, see. It’s such a bother, getting divorced.”
John cocks his head to the side, studying him. He is petulant, indicating that the conflict with his brother is a long-standing issue with both sides entrenched, their positions hardened and immovable.
“Hello, Sherlock,” says a slightly tremulous voice, despite the hard work the owner is obviously putting into making it sound calm and confident. For a moment Sherlock is tempted to ignore it. He recognises the voice
“Oi, boys,” Sally interrupts them via radio, “if you have enough breath left to quote poetry – nice though it was – you can cycle a bit faster, too, and make sure nobody jumps away on the ascent.”
Sherlock heaved a dramatic sigh at this. John bumped his shoulder playfully. “See? People are enjoying it. Despite the ‘ridiculous prose’ and ‘romanticisation of characters and events’.”
“We are here on official government business,” says Sherlock, drawing himself up to his full height so that he is towering over the dog man and the other bystanders. Next to him, John puffs out his chest, too, and assumes what Sherlock likes to think of as Captain Watson stance. “The man whom ‘Dotty’, Mrs. Dorothy ...”
Sherlock looks from John’s puzzled expression to Kenworthy, who doesn’t seem to be quite following, either. God, is he surrounded by idiots again? How can John be so brilliant and not be aware of it, not make the connection?
Breathing hard and trying not to steer too close to the right whenever he was riding next to the unsecured roadside, John began counting down the bends. Three more to go, now two. There was a slight lessening of gradient, the last serpentine curve, a straight stretch ahead with the carpark at the pass already in sight. Looking over his shoulder to Sherlock who this time had chosen to ride second, he saw his friend’s weary but elevated smile. Holding out his left hand, he waited for Sherlock to ride up and grasp it briefly, an action which almost caused the two of them to collide and fall over because of their low speed. Grinning like a madman, John let go of Sherlock’s hand as powered by a rush of endorphins not only caused by the fact they had indeed conquered the pass, he accelerated to cover the last metres in a sprint.
“Okay.” He gazes down at Sherlock splayed out on the bed and shakes his head. “I can’t believe I’m doing this.”
“Is that a not very subtle attempt at making me strip in front of you?” enquires John with a cheeky grin.
“I should have anticipated that he wasn’t alone. No one is this bloody cocky and annoying without backup.”
Jumping from the gate, Sherlock makes his way over to the pond. The water level is still comparatively high. He wonders whether it dries out completely in very hot summers. It looks rather deep, too, although the ground can’t be seen because of the algae and other plants that grow in the water. A few dragonflies are zipping to and fro. Pond-skaters are making tiny ripples on the otherwise smooth surface.
. His thumb strokes the exposed skin. It tickles, causing Sherlock to squirm slightly and break the kiss by turning his head away from John to suck in a breath of air. His heart is racing and his head swimming with emotions he can’t place. To his horror, he realises that the careful, usually well-maintained construct of his mind palace is in shambles. Shelves housing long held beliefs are being torn down and new, temporary edifices are being erected in their stead – vague, rickety things based on the unstable and treacherous ground of emotions instead of the stout foundations of scientific facts. Experience might reinforce these new structures, Sherlock knows, might make them permanent and valuable. But right now, they seem to shake and tremble with each new touch from John. In addition, an entire new wing is being established. Sherlock can’t parse what has been destroyed or deleted to make room for it. It houses John’s reactions to Sherlock’s touches, his gasps and soft growls, the way he tenses and trembles in Sherlock’s arms, the feel and scent of his skin, the shape of his lips, the taste of his mouth.
John wakes at around five in the morning because he needs the toilet. For a moment, he is confused by Sherlock’s absence, before he remembers their peculiar sleeping arrangements. As he walks around the bed, he stops to watch Sherlock for a moment, rolled up in his towel and finally asleep. He is shivering slightly. Over night, temperatures have dropped even more. A fresh breeze from the sea is blowing through the half-open window. John shuts it quietly before making for the ensuite. While relieving himself, he has an idea.
Things were surprisingly easy with Janine. But with John ... it’s not like it used to be, their tight friendship and easy rapport. John is so different now, as if a part of him has stayed behind in the house in Croydon he shared with Mary. And Sherlock, try as he might, can’t seem to find and revive the old John. He’s even attempted to provoke arguments, to shake John out of the grey stupor he seems to be caught in. A month ago, Sherlock laid waste to the kitchen with an experiment. He then proceeded to destroy John’s phone by placing it precariously on the mantelpiece from which it promptly fell onto the floor, shattering the screen. But the result was not the passionate reaction he had hoped for, but merely a sad, defeated shrug and a sigh from John. In the end, Sherlock cleaned up the mess in the kitchen himself and bought a new phone to try and make amends. John didn’t really react to this, either. Often, it feels like only half of him is sharing Sherlock’s quarters now. A shell, or a shadow, the sad ghost of the man he once was. Sherlock hates it, and hates his own inability to change it even more.
John’s head perks up at the mention of the venue. “The Windmill Theatre? Isn’t that the ‘Revudeville’ with the naked girls? Some of my mates from my last ship wouldn’t stop talking about it. Apparently they went during their last shore leave and were rather impressed. Definitely had a good time. I thought they were pulling my leg about the naked girls, though. Nudity on stage? Seriously? Is that allowed?”
John stares at Sherlock’s bright yellow jersey a few rows ahead of him and worries his lower lip with his teeth. “Thanks.”
Flashes of their confrontation the night before Sholto’s accident come unbidden to John’s mind. He inclines his head. “Well, it’s understandable, isn’t it? He worked so hard towards winning the Tour, and to have all of it taken away from him suddenly and without much hope of ever regaining what he lost ... I’d be depressed, too, if that happened. Destroyed, really. And I wouldn’t enjoy being around people who might pity me, and who reminded me all the time of what I’d never have again.”
“Moreover,” goes on Sherlock, speaking sharply while trying to steer the conversation onto safer, more familiar ground, “all this has no bearing whatsoever on what concerns us at the moment, namely the investigation of Jennifer Wilson’s death. On the phone you announced that you had news. What is it? Did you find the message?”
John exchanges questioning glances with the riders in his group but earns only shrugs and confused glances. Zipping up his jersey, he prepares for the descent, searching for Mike, Irene or other Team Speedy’s
“No, there wasn’t. Or you drew the wrong conclusions from what there was. James and I are friends – again. And it’s good. It’s brilliant, actually. Much better than the other thing we tried, which didn’t work. Also, he met someone in rehab, and it appears to be serious. And I’m happy for him, truly, un-jealously happy.”
“Unusual kind of treatment,” comments one of the paramedics, his eyebrows raised he watches Sherlock gulp down the drink.
“I ... er ... I should be off.” He rises and begins to gather together some of the paperwork. “Want to see what Sally got from our special friends, and have another chat with Customs and Forensics before I turn in. Tomorrow’s bound to be crazy. We’ve come to the attention of the press, of course, and I’m going to have to deal with the wolves first time tomorrow. I’ll be round again when I can, okay?”
Sherlock is of course right about the leftovers, and he has to admit John has a point about them tasting even better than yesterday. Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Hudson have somehow heard about the Prime Minister’s visit to Bletchley and want to hear all about it.
John steps closer. “You were struggling and calling out. You seemed in pain or really frightened. I’m sorry, Sherlock, I was in the kitchen to make some coffee for Greg and give my statement. I should have stayed, perhaps even woken you gently before I left. Do you remember what happened to you? Did you have a bad dream?”
“We’ll try our best, Lestrade,” promises John. “Come on, Molly, let’s see if we can tie your bike to the back of our car.”
“I can’t understand that Jenny would have gone out with someone like Moran,” she says. “A Nazi sympathiser. A fascist. She was very outspoken against them, you should know. A true patriot.”
“Well, if your offer still stands,” he released Sherlock’s hand to breathe in deeply again and wet his lips once more, “please, go ahead. I’d really appreciate a ‘helping hand’. And as for not bothering Emma with ‘gross noises’, well, I guess I can always bite into my pillow should the need arise.”
John seems to be faring similarly. “It’s moving again,” he whispers, “into the bathroom.” Suddenly, light shines through the frosted glass door of the ensuite. The bathroom door leading to the corridor is closed and locked. Then there’s the sound of a zipper being opened, the rustle of clothing, and of someone sitting down and relieving themselves. They tear off toilet paper, there’s more rustling of clothes, then the loo flushes and water runs into the sink.
The sun had vanished behind a thick layer of hazy cloud. It could still be felt, but not like the bright burn of the previous day but rather like a dull yet constant, oppressive heat. The air had increased in humidity, making breathing laborious. This became particularly bothersome during the steep passages, which were plenty. At one point the road ran straight for a stretch and the gradient became so steep that John considered dismounting while he still could without falling over. Even in lowest gear it was almost impossible to tread. When he rose from the saddle to put more force on the pedals, his rear tyre lost grip, and when he sat back the front wheel did, rocking off the tarmac. He ended up cycling in narrow serpent-lines, following Sherlock’s lead who, panting, forced his bike up the steep incline.
He pushes past Daniel who steps aside with a stunned expression. Apparently he didn’t expect such a frank speech from his cousin. Sherlock rushes out of the room, his heart beating hard and fast. Has he revealed too much? He didn’t intend to tell Daniel most of what he said. The words simply gushed out. Has he made himself vulnerable now? Will Daniel use what he’s learned as ammunition for yet another vile attack?
Unconsciously, Sherlock runs a hand through the dark mop on his head. “What about my hair says public school?” he asks with genuine interest. His housemaster at Harrow often penalised him for not keeping his wayward curls neatly parted and pomaded down.
“She cried a little on the phone, seemed very grateful. Don’t know what for, really, as we haven’t found her daughter yet. Daniel wrote,” he reads from his phone,
Mr. Holmes sighed again, looking suddenly years older. “Tests are still being run to determine how dangerous and potentially life threatening it is, and to gauge the risks and benefits of surgery, but a recent MRI scan revealed an aneurysm in my brain that could burst any time. You are a doctor, right? You know what that means.”
The boys laugh. “Bad luck for you. We won’t let you out again. You can piss your pants for all that we care.”
“Would you like to kiss?” asked John slyly. “And when did you ever heed any conventions, romantic or otherwise?”
“Yes. It’d like to visit the market, too, and look for possible vantage points the shooter may have occupied. It must have been a professional, to execute a hit in such a busy place and not be noticed. We need to pass by the Yard to see what evidence they have gathered so far. And what they have missed, of course. Dimmock is not the most observant of officers.”
Sherlock gazes at him, his worn, lovely face. The smile has reached his lips now. He swallows. “Yes, she was.” For a moment, it feels strange to admit this. For many years, he successfully managed to convince himself that he wasn’t lonely but merely solitary, that things were fine, that people were idiots unworthy of attention anyway. But deep down, he knew he was deceiving himself. He craved friendship and acceptance like everybody else.
“Vanessa originally booked two. We only have the double and a family room available at the moment because of the birthday that’s taking place in the pub. Many of the guests are staying overnight. But then she called back and changed it to the double only. Would that be a problem? You can have the other room, too, if you’d like.”
Sherlock scoffed, suddenly angry. “Of course not. Over the following days I didn’t see him at all, despite knowing that he hadn’t left for Norfolk but was indeed at the college. I tried to contact him, but only received a brief and formal reply that he was busy revising for an exam. As if he’d ever cared about those before.”
“You could always call in sick,” John tells him matter-of-factly as he walks over to the window to release a squirming Hattie onto the sill where she sits tense and cackling, watching the birds in the nearby apple-tree.
“I think I’d like to take it home and test it for infectious bacteria,” says Sherlock, walking over to the bathroom door where he hung his suit to dry. He searches for a plastic evidence bag in the inner pocket of his jacket, drops the tick inside and seals it. John snorts.
Meanwhile on the television, Jens Voigt was being captured by a small group of riders including Froome in his yellow jersey on the final ascent. His pursuers had shortened their distance to him continuously and were now rushing past.
tries to shush it unsuccessfully, until John assures her that he doesn’t mind. They strike up a conversation about illnesses and modern methods of treatment (with the parrot commenting the odd phrase), which once more shows John’s proficiency as a doctor, and his easy rapport with people (and animals).
Having raised himself into a sitting position again, Sherlock waits for the throb in his temple to subside before he crawls forward on all fours, feeling the floor carefully until his fingers meet with fabric.
“Actually, yes, through Susan. We’d communicated online for a while in the Star Wars fandom, back when we were both at uni and fandom related things mostly existed in newsgroups and on message-boards. Turned out she was interested in historical reenactment as well, so we met at some events. But ending up as neighbours was more or less coincidental.”
