‘Sounds good,’ Dean replied, looking extremely pleased with himself now that Castiel was properly wound up. ‘Talk to you later, Cas. Hope your day gets better.’
, and the easy banter and camaraderie between them made Cas’s chest feel warm and glowy, and he got a stupid smile on his face that both Dean and Charlie mocked him mercilessly for.)
Cas hurried inside, now quite cold, and found Claire and Kaia huddled on the sofa with Amara stretched across both their laps like she thought she was a Pomeranian rather than a forty-five pound pile of fur and drool. Mugs of what appeared to be hot chocolate were sitting untouched before them on the coffee table. Cas sat down next to Claire, and gave her arm a sympathetic pat.
‘Ah,’ Dean said, looking uncomfortable again, ‘From some asshole who thinks he’s artsy or something. Kinda stupid looking, if you ask me.’
shut the fuck up, Dean!’ Cas groaned from inside the bathroom, ‘This is humiliating — I can’t believe you have to put up with this shit.’
‘I...’ Dean said, and shook his head, trying to gather his thoughts, ‘I have a car. Cas loves my car, even better than his car. He should have driven my car today. It’s after Halloween; he never rides the bike after Halloween. Why would he ride the bike when he could have taken... A car?’
a fragile little omega, or been suspicious of what else the cup might contain, but today he’s just glad to have something to do with his hands. As if reading his mind, Cassie casually reminisces about how Balthazar used to make them switch cups, but then concern wrinkles his brow when he points out a potential lapse in safety that Bal made over a
‘My pleasure, Mr Novak,’ she said smoothly, ‘And please, call me Joyce.’ She led him up the stairs, and across the porch, pointing out various aspects of the architecture that Castiel nodded blandly at, then unlocked the front door.
‘I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you doing all this work, not to mention driving me in to the shop every morning,’ he told Dean sincerely, ‘Really, Dean, you saved me a ton of hassle.’
‘Cool house,’ Dean remarked casually, looking in the rear view mirror to steal one more glimpse of it.
Jody smiled warmly at him, a look of fond recollection on her face, and said nothing more as she shifted the car into drive to take them to the hospital.
In the meantime, Jack and Jesse simply remained in each other’s pockets, and had not outgrown their penchant for causing chaos, particularly at school... Everything from managing to set all the clocks ahead by fifteen minutes to sneaking Jack’s dog, Adam, to school in his backpack. They’d only gotten caught when Adam had jumped out, and immediately ran over to the history teacher’s desk to relieve himself. Cas heard from the guidance counsellor so often that he’d saved her number in his contacts, and it took all his willpower to keep from answering the phone with a groan and ‘what did they do now?’. Jack always maintained that they never
‘Babe, if I have another night like this, I swear I’m going to jump off the roof,’ he said, only half joking, his body wrapped around Dean’s as they
One Saturday afternoon, Dean had decided to take Cas’s car into Singer & Sons for a state inspection and tire rotation, leaving Cas home with all four kids. Cas spent the day painting idly in his studio, his mind drifting somewhere between his creation and the chatter of the constant rotation of kids wandering in and out of the kitchen. He was so distracted that it took Claire calling his name several times before he shook himself and looked up.
‘Yeah, you better,’ Dean grumbled, then went off to find a volunteer for a meet and greet between the Jack Russell Terrier, who would eventually be named Adam, and the red brindle Pitt Bull, who would be named Amara, much to Dean’s dismay.
He forces himself to get up, and reluctantly climbs the stairs to his room, stretching until his spine lets out a satisfying series of pops, and silently cursing himself for falling asleep on the bloody sofa in the first place — he won’t admit to being
, and that the stress of their ‘mother henning’ was going to kill him faster than the problems with his heart.
‘Yeah, okay, Cas,’ Dean said, rolling his eyes and looking embarrassed, ‘Still. I don’t know how your brain holds all the stuff you know. God, I love you.’
Cas found his breathing had gone very shallow as Officer Stover explained the details of Claire’s accident, so he gripped the doorframe and once he was finished turned his attention to Claire. She had streaks of black makeup running down her face, proof she’d been crying, and tears were filling her eyes again as she stood there looking shaky and ill. Out of instinct, Cas opened his arms, and Claire threw herself into them, and started sobbing into his shirt. Cas held her tightly, and brought one hand up to stroke her back, feeling as though he might start crying as well.
now. I got two kids — one of ’em just left for college a few months ago, isn’t that insane? And the other one is thirteen, and he’s an artist, just like Cas — that’s my, uh, partner’s name, Castiel, but we call him Cas. Can you believe it —
, then made one final squawk, and spoke no more. Castiel tapped the screen in dismay, and Dean cursed, throwing his hands up in disgust.
The wedding went off without a hitch, despite the snow, and Andrea was absolutely radiant in her high-necked, Victorian style wedding dress that was miles and miles of white lace and sparkly little things that kept falling off and making people slip on the floor, but no one seemed too upset. It was a wonderful, beautiful event, and Dean even found himself getting a little misty when Benny murmured his vow of everlasting love and devotion in his throaty, Louisianan accent. Dean had known Benny most of his adult life, and to see him finally settling down, and taking this huge step was just... Something else. And he could’ve done a lot worse than Andrea, that was for sure.
Cas smiled back, looking proud, and turned his attention back to the jar, which was now half empty. ‘Almost done, Jack, you’re doing such a good job.’ Jack made a happy cooing noise, and Cas fed him another spoonful. ‘Okay, honey bees produce four byproducts that are useful to humans — honey, wax, pollen, and propolis. You can’t have honey, though, not for another six months — you did know that, right, Dean? It’s very dangerous for children under one to ingest honey, because Clostridium botulinum bacteria creates a toxin that can cause infant botulism.’ He dumped another mouthful of peas into Jack’s mouth, while staring up at Dean in alarm.
‘What do you want, Cas?’ Dean asks, somehow managing to sound both more harsh and more vulnerable than he intended. ‘Didn’t take you for the type to go for a booty call, but I’ve been wrong before.’ (
In no time at all, Cas had drawn an impressive rough sketch of a huge Tyrannosaurus rex  towering over the Impala, seeming like it was chasing it down a stretch of highway lined with trees and buildings on either side. The dinosaur’s mouth was open in a fearsome roar, but he was wearing what appeared to be sunglasses and sporting a mohawk, which gave the whole thing a fun, quirky look. He turned to Jack with a grin, and asked, ‘What do you think?’
Dean nodded, before realising she couldn’t see him through the phone, then said, ‘yeah. Yeah, I’ll be there.’
The chapter is inspired by “True Friends” from Bring Me the Horizon and “Blasphemous Rumours” by Depeche Mode. I’ve been really excited to get to this point in the story and I think you guys will see why soon.
“Who are they, Ellen?” He asked her as they approached another door. “We overheard them talking; they were talking about
Finally, War reached his red Mustang, and looked back over his shoulder, and didn’t see them coming. The Horseman reached for the door, and the boys grabbed him. The three time-travelers were right behind them as back-up.
The younger of the two brothers was about two inches shorter and he could do serious damage to Sam, if he weren’t as self-controlled and restrained. Rebekah hurried between her husband and brother-in-law.
Samuel tried to break free and felt the grip on Tim’s neck tightening as the door chimed again, and Reggie came in hauling Lindsay. “Reggie, you got another pair of handcuffs?” The older hunter turned around, momentarily distracted. “Pretty boy here’s hiding Sam.”
If history could be changed starting with the first Apocalypse, then a whole lot of tragedy could be prevented, including their own. These hunters were informed of the risk that none of them would live to see a better future, but they were insistent on saving the world as their predecessors had been. It had been Sam’s namesake’s idea to try to fix the past in the first place.
“Or maybe you’re full of crap. Maybe you’re afraid God will bring Cas back to life again and smite you and your candy-ass skirt, or just let Cas from future come back here.” He continued to taunt. “By the way, hi, I’m Dean, and those three
Emma blushed and she hung up the phone and put it back in her pocket. She knew it was wrong to drink blood from the demon who betrayed her twin brother’s namesake, and it was even more wrong that she developed feelings for that demon. Ruby would mock her for it, if she ever said anything about it, and her family would be disgusted with her for it.
“Why not?” Present Cas asked, confused, and it was kind of cute, not that Dean would acknowledge it, or admit it. The older Winchester pushed the thought of his head.
Sam sighed. “What didn’t you say something? Dude, I don’t have anything against you smoking weed, or taking psychedelics.” He exclaimed, wondering why Samuel was keeping this to himself for these first couple of days after arriving in Oklahoma. “I tried weed in college once. It’s no big deal, man.”
“Yeah. We’re fucked, Emma.” He said loudly with frustration in his voice as their grandparents came through the door with a couple of shopping bags from a local supermarket, and he turned to them. “Hey, Oma, Opa?” He asked them as Dan and Angelika sat the bags down for a moment and slipped their shoes off. “Did you see any demons while you were out?”
“Are you guys friends?” She asked, then glancing over at the boy, who realized his mistake. “You said ‘hmm?’ when he said Samuel, is that your name? Is your name even Henry?”
Castiel had took Sam and Rebekah back in the past first, then came back for Dean. It took quite a bit of grace to take four trips, or five including the initial trip there, so the seraph had to take a break once all three of the futuristic Winchesters’ were at the intended spot. The stories that were told to Sam, Dean, and their two other siblings as children were fantastical, including the event in history they were in now. These stories of their namesakes were tragic, full of heartache, and probably had more death than any of Shakespeare’s plays.
I’ve been listening to the “Rapture Rising” and “Daddy’s Home” Bioshock songs by JT Music a lot recently, which have been motivation for this as well. The director’s cut for the music video “Hurricane,” by 30 Seconds to Mars serves as an inspiration as well.
. It was ingrained in them and it left no room for interpretation, unlike the hero Sam’s teachings that allowed her twin leeway to venture into darker territory.
He shoved Dean into the wall, not focusing on the fact that the door was still open. “If you actually think I—” Sam snapped, but then he cut himself off and after a long pause, he headed back into the room.
The younger Winchester grabbed his shotgun from the top of the row of Campbell soup cans and kid instinctively pulled out a .44 caliber pistol from his jeans pocket, thus alerting one of their demons collecting water of their presence.
Sam’s namesake was a doing a demonstration of loading a shotgun for the young man and pregnant woman. “—Then snap it in.” He instructed whilst Dean’s namesake had set the butt of a rifle on the table and faced the guy who opened the door earlier.
Dean overheard Ellen not far from him as he was assisting with the shotgun training, whilst keeping an eye on the sleeping Sam and Rebekah. She was standing in front of their namesakes, who were sitting in the opposite corner of the church.
“We should probably start with figuring out if there’s any demons who followed us,” he said, turning toward Emma.
Dean heard an annoyed scoff on her end of the line as she hung up and put her contact under the different spelling ‘Rebecca,’ then glancing at Cas, before both headed inside.
Shaking his head, the kid looked back up at Sam uncomfortably, like he was resisting an urge. The younger Winchester looked around for the other demon, momentarily distracted by his concern for the young man, who jumped him from behind.
I should note that relevant details, such as previous fics that inspired this are still an inspiration to that one and previous outsider media influences remain a vital part of the reboot, mainly Criminal Minds and Dexter, but a recent outsider influence has infiltrated this fic, NBC's Hannibal and Heathers the Musical. The fic will stay true to Spn, of course, and I have a tendency to blend in outsider media influences, where I get most of my inspiration to write. I may or may not be throwing in new ideas, change certain things in the original chapters, or introduce certain things earlier in the reboot, so I hope those who check it out enjoy it.
“Or something,” Gabriel said. “He’s very focussed on his studies. Anything outside of that is completely foreign to him.”
“It’s seasonal,” Castiel said. “Primarily during tourist season, and any weekend that the Sugar Heaven has special orders.”
“Let’s just go with the fact that most of my family are entitled pricks,” Gabriel said. “They’ve got big city jobs and think everyone else is below them. If they come into the shop they want something. And do you know what to do if that happens?”
One of the demons pulled out Castiel’s angel blade, holding it to Castiel’s throat. “Should we kill him?”
Dean could feel his anger rising. “You were the one who cut contact! You were the one who made that decision, not me!”
“Okay,” Dean said, eyeing the machine. “I should warn you that the most I’ve ever made is instant coffee.”
“Yet you never explain why,” Castiel said. He looked up at him. “I am of no use to you, Dean. Especially as I am now.”
“Cas is alive,” Dean said firmly. “Believe me. He keeps bitching about that fact. Not to mention he keeps going on about how he can ‘cure’ me.”
“It was also well known that they were a drunk,” Castiel said. “Besides, they only got their grade because their father was on the faculty.”
Sam felt sick. He knew it was going to be important for him to find Dean first and he didn’t even have the slightest of leads on him. Dean had made it clear that he didn’t want Sam to track him. Sam needed to find some way of letting Dean know that the angels were coming after him. Setting his jaw he knew he was going to have some decisions to make.
“Died before she got to that stage, remember?” Dean shrugged it off. “I know what I’m doing, Crowley.”
Dean glared at him and walked out of the room. Crowley let out a long sigh, shaking his head and muttering under his breath as he went back to making the hex bags. He’d finish his current task before starting on the one for Dean. He wondered if maybe he should switch the potion and give Castiel something lethal instead. He knew that wouldn’t work out well for him though.
As Castiel slowly kept rocking his body and growling, his teeth still firmly embedded in Dean’s neck. Dean felt the start of the mating beginning to form. He was overwhelmed as the desire hit him, the screaming of the word ‘mate’ in his head. He squeezed his eyes closed and panted, gripping Castiel hard behind the back and holding him close. Now it was just a waiting game as their connection formed. And Dean couldn’t wait.
Dean practically dragged Castiel through the bunker, the former angel protesting a little but otherwise letting Dean lead him. When they reached Dean’s room he pushed the other man in front of him, then stepped inside and closed the door. He rounded on Castiel, fixing him with a firm glare that made the other man squirm.
“Oh come on, Cas,” Dean said, sitting up. There was a dribble of cum on his chin. Castiel couldn’t take his eyes off it. “It’s going to happen.”
“Does it get busy on Saturdays?” Dean asked as he leaned against the counter and watched the clock as it ticked down to opening time.
“If you were human we would not be in this situation,” Castiel said. “You would never have bound me and used me against my will.”
“Yeah. Said it sounded like she had no future here and to go somewhere where your family doesn’t have reach.”
“That is the downside of being on Main Street,” Castiel said. “It will get busier once the specials menu changes.”
“I’ve got a feeling you’re not going to get anywhere near him,” Dean said. “Gabriel’s pretty set on keeping you out of the shop.”
“Get over yourself, John,” Bobby said. “The life you made for these kids is toxic. I’m giving Dean a stable home and the training he wants. He’s got a roof over his head, clothes on his back, and he knows exactly where his next meal is coming from. That’s better than you ever did for them.”
,” Dean said, a small amount of fear threading his way through him at the sound of his father’s voice. “Sam and I are free to contact each other all we want.”
“Because mates are a burden,” Crowley said. “Your enemies use them against you. They always turn on you.”
“I said stop burning yourself out!” Dean punched him, snapping his head around. “Keep doing that and I will have to kill another one of your brothers and sisters. Do you want that? Because I’ll happily do it.”
“It is long overdue for a service,” Kali said. She pulled out her phone. “Let me just check with him that it’s okay that I give it to you.”
He pulled the computer toward him and stared at the algorithm running on the screen. He knew that without any information it was probably going to take him months, possibly years, to get through the entire database. And he was on a time limit – the libraries would delete old security footage after a while. Some of them already had.
Dean stepped into the room, his eyes instantly finding Castiel. He frowned as he crossed the space toward him. “You look shit.”
When Dean got home he found that Bobby already had dinner started. Dean took over the cooking, not commenting about his aching feet. He didn’t know why they were so sore today. There was really no reason for it. It did feel good to take his shoes off though, Dean padding around the flat in socked feet as he finished making dinner.
Castiel pushed himself up, swinging one leg over Dean’s hips so that he could straddle him. They worked together to line up Dean’s cock, Castiel slowly sinking down onto the length. Castiel flicked the trench coat out so that it wasn’t in the way, and Dean had to admit how hot he looked naked in nothing else. Dean knew that every time he saw the trench coat now he would be thinking of this moment.
When Dean had return to Hell he had found Crowley’s people setting up Anton’s body. Apparently while he had been gone Crowley had taken the liberty of getting what little information was left out of the demon before he had told his people to display the body in a prominent position to remind everyone not to double cross him. Anton’s guts were still spilling out of him, his throat slit where Crowley had placed the finally blow.
“I appreciate the offer, boy, but this is a hard one. Needs expert hands.” Bobby shook his head. “I’m handling it personally.”
Sam and Castiel made their way into the room and closed the door behind them. Dean looked to be asleep, exhaustion etched deeply into his face. As they made their way closer his green eyes blinked open, taking them in.
Castiel had kept in contact, and Dean could still sense him over their bond. They kept their minds open to each other now. Dean tried not to pry too much over his, trying to give Castiel his privacy. He knew that Castiel had gone to visit the angels to reassure them that everything was fine. Dean was scared they would realise who were the ones behind the Nephilim and kill Castiel. Castiel had sent him reassuring thoughts and Dean knew that he was still alive.
They had crossed back into America by the start of week five, Dean finally cornering their prey in San Antonio, Texas. Dean was furious by this point having been lead in such a long chase. The man had begged for his life, trying in vain a couple more spells and traps that Dean had just shrugged off. Crowley had given Dean a list of questions that he wanted answered so Dean had tortured his victim until he got them. Once Crowley was satisfied Dean had taken great pleasure in slicing his victims head clean from his body. Slowly.
Castiel finally set the bee down, stepping up behind Dean and circling his arms around his waist and leaning into his back. Dean smiled. Maybe it was time he and Castiel finally admitted to Sam about their relationship. Dean had a feeling it was the worst kept secret in the bunker but they had never acknowledged it before now.
“Well for one it would actually have to be a committed relationship. Long term,” Dean said. “No loving them and leaving them.”
“Exactly,” Bobby said. “And if you need a part we don’t have talk to me so we can negotiate something.”
Dean stepped forward, reaching up to Castiel’s ear and fumbling for a moment. He found the catch and pulled it free, removing the earring from Castiel’s ear. He frowned as he stared at the hole, the edges looking red and sore. “Is it infected or something?”
The waitress came to take their orders, Dean ordering his usual while Castiel ordered a club sandwich and soda. They settled in to wait for their food, Dean taking the moment to look at Castiel. He was surprised to find Castiel staring at him, blue eyes filled with curiosity as they gazed at him. Dean raised a brow, Castiel eventually looking away.
“The high schoolers tend not to last long,” Benny lamented. “They have a glamourized image of what things are like and then they find out what hard work it really is.”
Crowley straightened and stood, smoothing down his jacket. “How do you think he would react if I were to poison him and end the pregnancy?”
Sure enough he heard footsteps on the stairs, Castiel making his way down. He stepped through the war room into the library, blue eyes searching out and finding Dean’s. A smile spread over his lips for a moment before concern replaced them.
The next week proved to be uneventful, Dean breezing through it without any hassles. He was really starting to get the hang of the coffee shop now, Kali barely having to tell him what needed to be done for Dean to do it. Gabriel still teased him about him arriving early to the shop. Dean didn’t tell him that it was actually a struggle getting up that early and that before he got a cup of coffee into him he was a sloth.
“You’ve got something she wants then,” Bobby said. “You stay away from Anna Milton. Do you realise what she could do?”
“I think we all do,” Gabriel said. “Anyway, I’ll start you on the easy drinks. Nothing too fancy for your first week.”
Dean curled up on the bed, pulling his phone to him. He glanced up toward the door and absently wondered what Bobby was up to. They’d had breakfast together and Bobby had said something about going into the yard to work. Dean wondered if maybe he should have gone with him. Every opportunity could be one to learn after all.
“Depends what it is,” Dean said as he leaned back against the counter, his coffee in his hand as his robe moved with him. “Need me to stash a body?”
Most of the demons immediately rushed to the door to get away from his wrath. He narrowed his eyes as he saw a small group hang back. They were fidgeting and whispering amongst themselves. Crowley scented the air, noting that this particular group was made up entirely of alphas. That intrigued him as most of the demons were betas. Alphas tended not to last long, usually killing each other off as they moved up through the ranks.
“Like I said – it doesn’t matter,” Dean said. “Let’s just say they told me what you would offer. They were right.”
“He owns a sweet shop,” she reminded him. “He’s always first in line at Benny’s on banana and cream pie days.”
“That’d do it,” Bobby said. He sighed. “Anyway it’s late. We should probably head to bed. I’m guessing you’re tired.”
Castiel didn’t need to be told twice. He started out slow enough that it was driving Dean crazy, but slowly increased his thrusts over time. Dean rolled his hips, angling them with each thrust until Castiel began spearing into his sweet spot. Dean grunted, tilting his head back as Castiel began peppering soft kisses over his neck and jaw.
“But he is skilled at it,” Hannah said. “It was his suggestion that allowed us to retrieve the information from Metatron.”
He could feel Castiel’s knot beginning to catch again, Dean smiling. He’d discovered that he loved being knotted to Castiel. When they were knotted Castiel clung to him possessively, mouthing soft kisses over his mating mark. They would remain locked together for what Dean assumed was about an hour before he could pull free.
Dean finished his breakfast and sculled the last of his coffee, then washed up his dishes. As he wandered back to his room he looked over to see Bobby had moved to his computer and was no doubt looking for wrecks to purchase on there. Dean left him alone and pulled out his phone, texting Sam to check and see if it was safe to call. He didn’t even have to wait five minutes before Sam texted back that it was.
“Yeah,” Sam said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. “I mean he did once but he’s never really tried again.”
“I can change a tyre,” Gabriel said in defence. “And I know how to check the oil. That’s all you need to know.”
“You intrigue me,” Anna said. “You’re the first person outside of family to work at the coffee shop.”
Castiel slipped a third finger into him and targeted the spot again, Dean moaning. He kept rolling his hips, reaching down to wrap his hand around his cock and slowly beginning to stroke it. He closed his eyes as he lost himself into the feeling. He could come just from this, he knew that. He sucked on his lower lip as he grew accustomed to Castiel’s fingers. A droplet of precum trickled out of his cock and over his fingers.
Kali sent the text message, Dean taking the opportunity to clean up the tables and wipe them down. He was just finishing up when he heard Kali’s phone chirp. She looked down at it for a moment before looking up.
“Yet all he does is stare at her picture,” Dean said, thinking of the long nights where John would do exactly that and nothing more. “He still thinks it was arson you know.”
Dean had actually mentioned it to Bobby, who had looked at him with sad eyes. “You shouldn’t have had to go through that, boy. I’m glad you’re liking things the way they are now.”
“Maybe follow his lead,” Benny said. “Look, I gotta get back to the counter. But you listen – stay away from that girl. All she’s gonna do is hurt you.”
His body rocked as Castiel thrust into him, the angel’s teeth scrapping over the mating bite. Dean smiled, running his hands over Castiel’s chest and around behind his back, scratching at the skin. Castiel growled at the move and thrust in just a little bit harder. Dean was actually starting to feel a little bit sore in all the right places from their multiple matings.
“Maybe, but there are other fees for owning the building,” Kali said. “Then you have to factor in supplies and ingredients, and the sweet shop has more workers.”
Dean threw back his head and laughed. Castiel shifted uncomfortably on the bed, Dean shuffling so that he could wrap an arm around Castiel’s shoulders. Dean could see that Castiel was blushing harder now and it was endearing. Pressing a soft kiss to Castiel’s neck Dean grinned, pulling at him.
Dean pulled a face at the memory. He could almost smell it again. “You mean the cockroach and rat house?”
“I ‘spose that car of yours does need a bit of work,” Bobby said. “Still can’t believe your dad gave it to you.”
“Your daddy might have let you drink early but like hell I am,” Bobby said, giving him a teasing shove. “I don’t want the law coming down on me.”
“He was a great threat to all,” Hannah said. She reached out, taking his hand and squeezing it. “I am glad to have you back, Castiel.”
“But it’s not all it’s cracked up to be, is it,” Crowley said. “I think you watched too many romance movies. They paint things to be more… glamorous than they are.”
“You are impossible to live with when you’re human,” Sam commented. “I’d hate to imagine what you’re like as a demon.”
“It’s not like I’m planning on spending it all on pie,” Dean said. “Just heard about the place, that’s all.”
“So you made assumptions about me,” Dean said, feeling a hint of anger. He hated it when people made assumptions about him. It had happened enough in the past.
“I’m dealing with it,” Dean said. In some way’s he was kind of glad. He couldn’t stand to hear the disappointment in his father’s voice. He knew it would be there. Not to mention the anger. It made Dean worry about Sam again.
“I have been with you enough when you have ordered it,” Castiel said, taking a sip from his own cup.
They found a table easily as it was still early for dinner, Benny giving them a wave. They slid into the booth, Dean already knowing what he was going to order before he even picked up the menu. He was hooked on Benny’s Bacon Cheeseburgers. He was almost certain that if he was on Death Row they would be his final meal request.
“The guy had the gun trained on us,” Dean said. “And you couldn’t jump the counter if you wanted to. It’s too high. And by the time you did he would have pulled the trigger.”
“Nah, it’s fine,” Dean said. “I kind of got used to it. I always knew Dad would eventually come back and in the meantime I got to spend more time with Mom.”
“Just a little incentive,” Dean said with a smirk. “If it works the way it’s supposed to we should be mated in the next couple of days.”
Castiel stared at him, Dean feeling his glare. He sighed, stroking Castiel’s jawline and feeling the stubble beneath his fingers. Dean glanced up toward the door and wondered if the other demons were trying to listen in.
“Again, maybe you need a better integrator,” Dean said. He ran his gaze over the angel, noticing that he was fidgeting and refusing to meet Dean’s eye. He was surprised that he was getting as much information as he was out of the angel. “Have you tried removing Metatron’s grace and using it as a bargaining chip?”
“From what I’ve seen I’m guessing the former,” Dean said. “He comes across as the sort that would get into his study and lose track of time.”
She hung up the phone before he could speak again. Sam raised his eyebrows and ended the call, setting the phone down on the table top. This whole thing was one big mess. He closed his eyes and thought about praying to Castiel. He wondered if Castiel could even hear him from Hell. Sam really wished he could talk to him. He really missed the angel.
“Yes, this is Cas’ blade,” Dean confirmed for her. “He’s not going to be happy if I kill you. He’s quite fond of you.”
“Before you start reprimanding your boy,” Bobby said. “You should know that he’s a hero. He was robbed yesterday and got the robber captured. You should be proud of him.”
The before school rush seemed to pass quickly, Dean again noting that a lot of the high schoolers preferred the speciality drinks which meant Kali was extra busy during this time. Dean stayed where he was though, helping out when he could. He’d heard the names of some of the drinks so often that he had started to pick up on what they meant. He still wasn’t sure how to make them, but he knew the cup sizes and in some cases how much coffee they needed.
“I had to clean up a few messes,” Castiel answered, letting Dean begin to undress him. “The angels will no longer bother us about the Nephilim.”
During the lull Dean made his way out to clean up the shop a bit. The high schoolers were probably the messiest of the groups, especially the before school rush. He had to pick up a lot of extra trash during that time. He wiped down the tables without needing to be asked by Kali, and checking to make sure they had enough stock out front for the next rush.
“Well you’re not exactly going to be welcome in Heaven,” Crowley said. “Which brings us to Heaven. Do you really think they’re going to allow you to have a child?”
They looked around at the sound of approaching footsteps and spotted Kali and Gabriel making their way down the street toward them. They were talking to each other in hushed tones, Gabriel narrowing his eyes as he saw Aaron. He glanced at Dean and his face lit up in a bright smile, and when he reached him he clapped him on the back.
“I have my books,” Castiel said. “I am also expecting Gabriel to drop in tomorrow, and no doubt a phone call from my father once word spreads.”
“Here’s hoping,” Dean said. Sam really needed a more stable school life to get his GPA though, and Dean worried that he wouldn’t get it. All he could do was cross his fingers.
“In a manner of speaking,” Crowley said. “I’ve just allocated them their tasks and their brainstorming how to complete them.”
“Never knowing where we’re going to be week to week?” Dean asked. “Always on the road. That’s not a good life, Dad. I was sick of it.”
“You just do,” Gabriel said. “By the way, most days you’ll be working with my girlfriend Kali. She can be a little bit handsy, but she means nothing by it. She’s also a bit of a fire breather when she gets mad.”
“We’re going to have to work something out,” Sam said. “There’s got to be some way to get the grace. Just like there’s a way to cure Dean.”
Dean’s frown deepened. He hadn’t really thought that far ahead. He knew that there were probably a couple of years of solid training before he was anywhere near ready to become a fully-fledged mechanic.
Castiel moved back to the wall, checking the time. It was still twenty minutes until Dean’s next injection. He hoped that Sam had managed to get some sleep. The younger Winchester had been exhausted to the point of collapse. With his grace now powering him up Castiel didn’t need to rest anymore so he used it to his advantage.
Dean bit his lip to keep from making a comment about Gabriel being whipped. Something must have shown on his face though because Gabriel narrowed his eyes at him while Kali smiled sweetly. Dean picked up the cloth to wipe down the tables and pick up the rubbish again. Gabriel shifted so Dean could access his table while giving Dean a wink.
“One of the Sugar Heaven’s big weekends,” Benny said. “Mean’s Kali’s at the Heaven, leaving you boys to the Perk.”
Castiel looked him over. “And for what purpose am I alive? Apart from your frequent sexual assaults.”
“For some women all they want is Mr Right Now.” Dean said with a smile. “Like I said – bars are full of women.”
Stepping out of the bathroom Dean started as he realised that he was no longer alone. He closed the bathroom door behind him, taking in the three others in the room. He narrowed his eyes, staring at them and noting the white light shining beneath their skin. Angels.
“I got one thing I’ve got to ask you,” Gabriel said, stopping by the counter and leaning against it, staring into Dean’s eyes. “What are your intentions here?”
Bobby sighed, Dean seeing pity in his eyes. “You realise that’s not normal. Most children don’t go through that.”
For the meantime though all he could do was wait, either for freedom or death. Whichever came first.
and began to re-read it. He spent most of the morning focused on the book, losing himself in the story. He liked to pretend that he was one of the characters taking on the ghost truck, imagining himself as the one who got the girl and saved the day. He wondered what it would be like being a monster hunter. It would probably be a lot of thankless work. He was glad for his own mundane life.
“If you keep showing up so early you’ll start making me look bad,” Gabriel said as he unlocked the door to the coffee shop on Monday morning. “Don’t you sleep?”
“Wow.” Sam shook his head. “Sometimes I think you guys are worse than the demons. At least the demons keep their deals.”
“We do,” Hannah said. “I was unsure if you had already spoken with Crowley about the new arrangement.”
“What has happened to Castiel is regrettable,” Hannah said. “Unfortunately sacrifices must be made.”
“So’s Chuck,” Kali said. “Anyway, Castiel decided he didn’t want to live in his father’s shadow so he changed his surname and moved out first chance he got. Been doing everything on his own ever since and refusing any help from his family.”
“What do you need?” Dean asked, searching the cupboards and finding a bag of potato chips. He pulled it out and opened it, crunching into them.
“No doubt Hannah or Samandrial will hear something and mention it to him,” Castiel said. “And he will call and check on me.”
Dean, but at the same time it wasn’t the man that Castiel had come to know and love. The real Dean was lost beneath the murky blackness of his corrupted soul, the Mark burning into it.
Before Dean knew it his lunch break arrived, Gabriel handing him a coffee scroll as a reward for his hard work. Hearing the door chime Dean looked up and saw a woman walk in. She was stunning, with dark hair and skin. She was a beauty to look at.. Dean watched as she walked around the counter and pressed a hand into Gabriel’s back, kissing him gently on the cheek as he served a customer. Dean assumed this must be Kali.
“I do kind of work for one of them,” Dean said. “Gabriel, I mean. And I sort of met his younger brother today.”
Dean slipped the First Blade back onto his belt and stood, grabbing his bag. It was time to go back to Hell.
“That is the punishment, yes,” Castiel said. He looked up at Sam. “That is why the angels must never know about Dean.”
Dean stared at the phone, wondering what John was saying. He could tell from Bobby’s souring expression that it wasn’t good.
“Oh sure. You’ll be nine months, ready to pop, and killing.” Crowley rolled his eyes, running a hand over his face. “This is a logistical nightmare.”
Dean opened the wrapper, pulling Castiel up slightly. He carefully rolled the condom over Castiel’s own leaking cock and then gave it a couple of strokes for good measure. Castiel groaned, hips stuttering slightly. Dean licked his lips and helped line Castiel up, pulling his legs up to give Castiel better access. And then Castiel slid home.
“You taste so good,” Dean purred, pulling off Castiel’s cock and gently massaging his knot. “Be even better if you were locked in me.” He tapped his neck. “Just need a bite right here and it would be perfect.”
Castiel tried to think of who Isiah was, remembering that he was one of the lower ranked angels. They hadn’t really known each other but he knew Isiah had been working with Hannah. He swallowed down the lump in his throat, feeling sick.
“Yeah, he is.” Dean sighed, leaning back in his seat. “Freebies always make me think I owe someone.”
“That’s the last thing I need,” Castiel said. “I’ll have Gabriel here every night again watching me eat.”
Kali pressed a reassuring hand into his back as she passed him to make a speciality drink, the touch calming him a little. He nodded to himself, closing his eyes and calming his nerves before going back to what he was doing. He made it through the rest of the rush without further incident, actually breathing a sigh of relief as the last customer walked out the door with their drink.
Castiel could feel the last of his stolen grace fading rapidly. He had been deliberately trying to burn it out, using it to try and force himself free of his bonds. He could feel the darkness spreading through him, his senses dulling. He knew it would only be a matter of time now before the last of his grace burned out and burned him out with it.
“Our first step is to find the angel who created it,” Hannah answered. “We have several angels whom we are unable to contact. We have been searching for them. Once we find out which one it is they will lead us to the host and thus to the Nephilim.”
“Because I’m the one keeping your brother in line,” Crowley said. “I’m the one keeping him from going rogue and killing everything on this god forsaken planet.”
“No,” Anna said. “He always did exactly what he was told. He was naïve. He trusted too much. Look where it got him.”
Bobby had a point, but Dean knew that John was very sensitive about his parenting and hated being called out on it. Bobby looked at the phone, Dean knowing that John had hung up on him. Bobby handed the phone back to Dean.
There was a moment’s pause before he heard Dean try the door, then begin pounding on it shouting after Crowley. Crowley stepped away from it and headed back down the corridor. The door would hold for now. The room that Dean occupied was originally a cell designed to hold the strongest of creatures. That was why Crowley had given him the room in the first place. He had expected Dean to turn on him eventually and he was always one to plan ahead.
Castiel watched him go, Crowley disappearing out the door without another word. Strangely he felt as if his hope left with him. He glanced up as Dean stopped beside him, Dean levelling him with a dark look. Castiel set his jaw and met his gaze.
“So exactly how big is Gabriel’s family?” Dean said, curious. He imagined it was probably something like three kids, maybe four.
Pulling onto the main street he pulled the list out of his pocket that he’d written in secret the night before while Castiel had been in the shower. Hopefully he’d be able to find everything in the shortest amount of time possible. First stop though was the bakery.
Stepping into the throne room Dean raised his brows as he spotted a familiar man sitting in the throne. He was surrounded by subordinates who were talking, Dean hovering at the back of the room and only half-listening. Crowley looked bored but was paying attention, barking off orders and questioning when needed.
“One thing though,” Dean said as he pulled out the bread. “If you’re serious about carrying rocks in your bag I am
“Must’ve been hard,” Kali said. “Gabriel talked about when his family travelled. He said settling down was the best thing that ever happened to them.”
“And the clock is ticking,” Castiel said. He looked at Sam. “You really are exhausted, Sam. I will administer the next few injections. Get some rest. Eat. I will stay here.”
“You could say that,” Crowley said. He pulled an envelope out of his jacket and held it out. “Here are the details of his last known location. It will give you somewhere to start. Be aware that he seems to have a little band of followers that you will have to deal with.”
“I’m sorry it took so long,” she apologised as she crossed over to him. “There was a meeting called.”
Dean headed into the bathroom to shower and change. When he came back out Castiel already had his shoes, jacket and coat back on and was scrolling through his phone. Dean packed up his things and put his own shoes on.
As Castiel had predicted there were more customers around the lunch hour but not enough to be considered a ‘rush’. Dean also noted that many of the customers that came in were holding gift baskets and wrapped boxes branded with the Sugar Heaven logo. There was definitely an overlap between the two stores, and Dean had to commend Gabriel for thinking of that.
“No you haven’t,” Dean said. He narrowed his eyes. “And I can see it now. You don’t look like other angels. The grace in you is tainted.”
Dean looked up, his eyes black as night. Then he blinked, the black slowly fading away to familiar green. Sam frowned. This was different. There was also something different about the way Dean was moving; the expression on his face. It was more familiar. It was more like Dean.
“About seven years,” Kali said. “The sweet shop came first. That’s been open about eleven years now. That’s how we met.”
Sam hung up the phone, letting it drop from his hands. He noticed they were shaking and clenched them into fists. He squeezed his eyes closed as he tried to keep his breathing even. Was Dean a demon? Was that possible? Had he taken Castiel and was killing angels to keep him alive? There was only one way to find out.
“I see,” Castiel said. “That probably works best for me as I don’t have school or work, but I do tend to work on assignments on weekends.”
“You’ve got to learn something, Dean,” Bobby said, setting his utensils down on the table. “Sometimes it doesn’t matter who’s right and who’s wrong. What matters is being on the right side when it matters. In this town the right side is the side of the Shurley’s. Are they a bunch of pricks? Sure. But you don’t get caught up in their affairs or it will bite you in the ass.”
Castiel picked up a flask of holy water off the table as Sam approached Dean. Dean snarled as Sam got near him, Castiel splashing the holy water onto him. Dean flinched back and gave Sam the perfect opportunity to stab the syringe into his arm. Sam quickly injected the blood into Dean and stepped back, waiting to see if anything happened.
“Yes,” Anna said. “Lucifer was always a rogue entity. He always pushed back against authority, including our fathers. When he turned 18 our father wanted him to follow a set path but Lucifer had other ideas so Father kicked him out.”
Dean slipped the apron on, noting that it fit perfectly. It was a royal blue with the shop logo and name etched in white onto the front. Dean made his way around the counter, taking in the machinery on the other side. He felt overwhelmed by all the dials and handles.
Crowley stood his ground as Dean rounded on him slowly. He could see the rage in Dean’s eyes and knew that something in him had snapped. Crowley had been expecting this. He had hoped it wouldn’t happen but he knew that the Mark was unstable. Crowley set his jaw, knowing this was a fight he wouldn’t be able to win. Not on his own anyway.
He made himself lunch and then returned to his room to read, and before he knew it it was starting to get dark. Deciding not to cook tonight Dean headed down to the Impala, thinking about what to order. He decided to take a drive to Benny’s. He remembered that they did take out so he could eat in and then bring something back home for Bobby when he finished.
Kali shook her head. “She think’s Gabriel’s too close to the family even though Gabriel actually ran away himself at 16.”
It was well and truly dark by the time they got back to the car, Dean sliding in behind the wheel. They drove back to the workshop, Dean pulling into the reserved park just inside the yard. Bobby closed and locked the gate while Dean pulled the cover over his car to protect her from the dust and elements. Bobby really needed a carport.
“Yeah, it is,” Gabriel agreed. “I’ve tried to talk him into going to the movies with us but he won’t.”
didn’t turn our backs on our family,” Gabriel said. “We didn’t spread lies that brought CPS down on us and start gossip.”
“It kept you out of college for several years,” Dean pointed out. “You might have already graduated if it hadn’t happened.”
“We are having one problem trying to get payment from someone,” the demon said. “They’ve locked themselves in a warded room. We can’t get to them.”
By Wednesday Dean was starting to get into the groove of things. Bobby reminded him to not be too late getting to the workshop after he finished at the coffee shop, Dean patting him on the back on the way out the door. He drove to what had become his usual parking spot now and walked the rest of the distance to the coffee shop, arriving to find he’d beaten Kali there.
“Miss you too, little bro,” Dean said with a sad smile. “You just work hard at school and get those scores for college.”
It was Castiel’s turn to frown. He couldn’t imagine the angels ever working with demons. In fact, he couldn’t imagine the demons working with angels. He didn’t see how that could logistically work, and he knew from experience that it didn’t end well. “Do you have any leads?”
“We do have similar work ethics,” Benny said. “Gabriel too. He doesn’t just hire anybody to work at his shops. He must have taken a shining to you.”
“Dedicated cliental,” Kali said. “Fair prices. Good variety. And we’re next door to the only sweet shop in town.”
“That would really discount it,” Dean said, doing the math in his head. It was a good plan. “Man hours alone eat up a lot of the cost. And new parts are expensive.”
Dean came over to her and peered at the screen. The man looked a lot younger than Dean would have expected him to be, with a beard and short wavy hair. He looked pleasant enough as he smiled at the camera, but there was something shifty about his eyes. “Got it. So if he comes in should I just direct him onto you?”
“Your brother does not want rescuing,” Hannah reminded him. “And it will only be a matter of time before Castiel’s grace burns out and he dies with it.”
Dean nodded, rejoining her behind the counter. He hadn’t been there long when the first few customers wandered in, kick starting the lunch time rush. Dean settled in and began serving drinks, not really paying much attention to anything other than doing his job. He was definitely starting to fumble less and make fewer mistakes, Dean reminding himself not to get too overconfident lest he start making errors.
On the plus side he and Sam knew how to ‘cure’ a demon. Castiel knew he would need to find some way to get Dean out of Hell and back to the bunker. He gazed around the walls looking for something that could help him and coming up with a blank. For now he was completely at the mercy of the demons but would need to keep his wits about him.
Now that Castiel could sense what Dean wanted he began to do exactly that. His thrusts became a little shorter and harder, angling just right that he hit Dean’s sweet spot with every stroke. Dean tugged at Castiel’s hair, his nails raking down his back as he felt Castiel yearn for it. This was unlike anything Dean had ever felt before. He was in Heaven.
“To the unintelligent maybe,” Crowley said. He picked up his bottle of wine and offered it to Dean. “A celebratory drink?”
Castiel growled again, his eyes shining ever so slightly. Then he slammed up hard one last time, his knot catching inside of Dean. As Dean felt the first spurts of cum inside him he was overwhelmed with a searing pain in his neck as Castiel bit down on his scent gland. Dean laughed, finally ripping one hand free and forcing Castiel’s head to the side so he could return the bite and complete the mating.
“He always says family don’t end with blood,” Dean said. “Although he kind of gets annoyed when I call him ‘uncle’.”
“Like I said – technically no.” Crowley eyed Sam. “Be thankful he wants you alive. I’d have had you killed ages ago.”
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding to himself. “Okay. So I’ve got to get you some grace. Got any angels you want dead?”
“Yeah, I know. Your orders.” Dean said. “Maybe I should bring you to the Heaven’s gate and get your to override them.”
The sun was setting by the time Bobby wandered back to Dean. He looked over his shoulder at his work, seemingly happy with what he saw. “Not bad, boy. You’re picked that up quickly.”
Dean wandered into the shop and started the morning opening ritual. It might only be his second week but he’d already worked out what needed to be done before opening. The air was cool in the shop again, Kali turning on the thermostat to try and take the chill off the air. Dean knew the coffee machines themselves would help warm the place up.
“So he mentioned,” Crowley said. “I made it clear that Castiel’s grace was more important and that you were happy as a Knight of Hell.”
“Figured as much,” Dean said. “Because you live so long. But here’s the thing, Cas – I’m already dead. I can live as long as you now.”
“I guess that is one way of looking at it,” Dean admitted. She had a point. Mechanics were necessary.
His phone beeped that the time was up, Dean reaching out and picking up the stick on the table. He closed his eyes, willing it to be negative. The last thing he needed right now was to be pregnant. It would inconvenience things that was for sure. At the same time he couldn’t help but wonder what a child of an angel and demon would be like. Opening his eyes he looked down.
“How would you have me act, Dean?” Castiel asked. “Do you want me to lash out at you so that you will have an excuse to beat me?”
Dean knew he wasn’t going to get anything else out of him. He glanced at his watch and saw how much time had passed. If he was too late home he knew that Bobby would start worrying about him. That is, of course, if Bobby had made his way out of the workshop yet. “I’ve got to go,” Dean said. “It’s been nice actually talking to you.”
“I bet you don’t,” Dean said, eyeing him. “Still it would be boring.” He thought for a moment before an idea clicked in his mind. “Cas, you ever been to a movie?”
Dean nodded. “He really makes the best of a bad situation. He’s even been taking some online classes. Free ones though. I offered to pay for some for him but he refused.”
Castiel twisted the top off, letting out a breath as he brought it to his face. “I suggest you shield yourself.”
“They abandoned him too,” Anna said. “I visit him in prison sometimes but even he doesn’t want to talk to me.”
He shook the thought off. He worried about the fact Dean wasn’t on his suppressants anymore. It was like a beacon shouting ‘here I am’ to every alpha in the immediate area. He was scared Dean would get jumped. He was more scared about what could happen to the alphas that even tried to jump Dean. He had been able to sense the bloodlust coming from the demon. He knew it was probably controlled by the Mark and the First Blade, and that made him even more worried.
“Apparently he’s not nice to his kids,” Dean said. “Well, some of them he’s nice to, but the rest he’ll throw under a bus.”
“Yeah. He always looked down on food service workers,” Dean said. “Just give him another reason to be disappointed in me.”
He picked up the last ingredient that Crowley would need from a mystic in the middle of nowhere, paying her with some rare herbs that Crowley had given him to trade with. Then, with everything tucked into his bag, he made his way back down to Hell.
“Yeah, he mentioned,” Dean said. “Anyway I’ve got Monday, Tuesday and I have Wednesday morning. Also apparently I’ve got to be on call for Saturday during ‘peak season’ or whatever that means.”
“You have no interest in taking over Hell,” Castiel said. “If you did you would have killed Crowley long ago.”
“There’s a few people,” Crowley said. He narrowed his eyes. “Just so you know I just came back from a meeting with Sam.”
They finished up the day’s work, Bobby sending Dean to shower before they went out and then taking a shower himself once Dean was done. They headed for the Impala, Bobby directing Dean to the location of Benny’s. Dean found a park in the lot beside the diner, the two of them heading inside. Dean was surprised by how busy it was, realising that Kali had been right about it being popular.
“A little bit,” Kali said. “But I’m dating a guy who does the exact same thing so I’ve kind of gotten used to spotting the tells.”
He stopped by the counter and ordered some food for Bobby as well as some take out dessert for himself. Benny made him the meal and handed it to him in a takeout bag. Dean thanked him again, then headed back to the car. All the way he felt like he was being watched. He scanned the area and didn’t see anyone so he put it down to his paranoia.
“They make a fun challenge,” Dean admitted. “How’s your stolen grace going anyway? Should I get some more for you?”
“He is a bit,” Dean agreed. He stared down at his cheeseburger. “Look, can we not talk about my dad?”
“Cooperating with a robber is the best way to react,” Kali said. “Don’t put yourself in a position to get hurt. We’d rather lose the money than have either of you get hurt.”
He had no doubt sensed it over their bond. Dean could feel Castiel’s anger alongside his panic now. Dean didn’t answer him, instead keeping Castiel pinned to the floor. He would hold him for the entire hour if he had too. He could still feel Castiel coming inside him, flooding him with cum. Dean knew his heat would end now that it had been sated.
Castiel’s nose twitched at the memory of Dean’s scent. He kicked himself as he felt a thread of arousal shoot through him. Dean had smelt like everything Castiel loved. The fresh smell of the earth after the rain. A hint of a flower filled garden. The soft leather of the Impala’s seats. The slightest skerrick of sugar and honey. Castiel had always had fleeting hints of Dean’s smell over the years, but without his suppressants it had been almost overpowering.
Castiel pinned Dean by his wrists to the ground, Dean wrapping his legs around Castiel’s waist and trying to take him in deeper. He could feel his body over producing slick as he felt another wave of heat wash over him. He groaned, desperately needing to be knotted. Just having Castiel thrusting into him wasn’t enough. He needed more.
“Just remember this whole thing has conditions,” Bobby reminded him. “You’ve got to work hard and not slack off.”
Dean swallowed down his come, the sensation further flaring Castiel’s arousal. He could smell Dean’s sweet omega scent, and the word ‘mate’ echoed through his mind. He quashed the thought as quickly as it had come though. He wondered absently if it was Dean’s smell that made his so receptive to Dean’s ministrations.
Dean moved toward the throne, dropping into the nearby chair that Crowley had brought in specifically for Dean. “Any leads on Cas’ grace?”
“Because I will it,” Castiel said. “It may have been orders once, but now I do it of my own free will.”
Dean nodded and got into position behind the counter. There were a few customers in quick succession of one another, Dean able to fill most of the orders. When the last one left Kali restocked the food while Dean did the cups, Dean then heading out to clean the store and wipe down the tables. He could feel Kali watching him as he worked.
Castiel stepped back into the apartment, the door open. Dean took it as invitation to enter and stepped inside. He found the room to be sparsely decorated. If he had to guess most of the furniture came with the apartment. There wasn’t much in the way of personal effects. The walls were bare, and Dean spotted a desk in the corner stacked with papers, books and a laptop.
The booth they had sat in the week before was free, Dean and Castiel migrating to it. They slid into their seats, Dean picking up the menu and gazing down at it wearily. He wasn’t sure he could stomach a bacon cheeseburger that night so looked for something a bit lighter. He decided on a chicken Caesar wrap, looking up as Benny moved over to join them.
Dean nodded, climbing into the driver’s seat. He waited until Castiel had settled into the passenger seat before he gunned the engine and began to drive.
“I took a Knight of Hell,” Crowley corrected. “Who was one of the most dangerous men alive. It would do them well to remember that.”
“You’re right, we’ll talk later,” she said, giving him a wink. She walked over to Gabriel to relieve him of his duties.
Castiel didn’t reply. He knew he was unwell. He was tired all the time, and had actually started to sweat. That was unusual for him – he normally didn’t sweat at all. His whole body felt clammy, and he was sure he was pale. He didn’t have the energy to fight with Dean should he try anything.
He eventually spotted Kali and Gabriel wandering down the street talking to one another. They were walking so close they kept bumping into each other, and Dean had to admit watching them that Gabriel was clearly completely smitten by her. Dean had to smile at that, remembering how whipped the other man seemed to be. Dean made a vow to himself to never let himself be that way.
Dean knew he should be. They had promised that they would make big decisions together, and this definitely was a big decision in Dean’s book. He sighed, trying to work out exactly how he felt about it. “I don’t know.”
“You have no idea,” Gabriel said. “That woman breathes fire when she’s mad, and she can throw down like the best of them.”
“Oh hey Sammy,” Dean said, not relinquishing his hold on Castiel. “Thanks for making us go on that date. It was awesome.”
Dean pouted, caressing Castiel’s face. “You know I always found you attractive. Since the day we met. Doubly so when I realised you were an alpha. I just considered you off limits.”
“Maybe,” she said. “But Castiel has already cut his hours. He’s just going to keep cutting them until one day he doesn’t work here anymore.”
“I do the same with Sammy,” Dean said. He saw Castiel’s curious look. “My younger brother. He’s 14.”
Dean fisted Castiel’s hair with one hand, pulling him close with the other. He rolled his hips in time with Castiel’s thrusts. He didn’t think this could get much better but then an idea occurred to him. He groaned, opening his eyes to look up at Castiel.
They looked up as Benny brought them their food, sliding the plates in front of them. “Eat up, boys. Enjoy.”
Castiel growled again, pulling harder at his bonds. Dean frowned a little as he saw the faint glow to Castiel’s eyes. He seemed to be trying to use his grace to break free. Dean couldn’t have that, knowing it would burn out Castiel’s grace. He hurried to undress, tossing his clothing against the wall. He reached back and ran a hand through his slick and knelt down again, bringing his hand up to Castiel’s lips. Castiel leaned forward and licked his fingers clean.
“I wasn’t referring to Castiel,” Crowley said, sipping from his drink. “But he is going to need grace soon if you intend to keep him alive.”
“Just smile and ignore them,” Kali said. “People will just assume you’re traumatised and leave it at that.”
When they finished eating Castiel picked up the heart shaped rock, turning it over in his hand. “I saw you looking at this one.”
He went to help clean up but Bobby shooed him to his room, Dean heading into it and applying some of the IcyHot to his ankles. He stretched out on the bed, taking out his phone and scrolling through the contacts to Castiel’s number. Letting out a long breath he hit dial.
“We made do,” Dean said. “There was always some sort of cheesy Christmas movie on tv so we’d watch it while we chowed down.”
Castiel frowned for a moment, a thoughtful look on his face as he looked at Dean. “That would be nice.”
“Stop in tomorrow afternoon before you head home,” Gabriel said. “I’ll give you your first sample for free.”
“Of course he does.” Dean rolled his eyes. Castiel was a Winchester after all. Self-sacrifice was the name of the game. Dean finished his drink, placing the glass down. “I better go check on him.”
“Castiel is very good at hiding his emotions,” Kali said. She eyed him. “Something I think you might do as well.”
Dean couldn’t get over the man’s voice. Dean blinked, tearing his eyes away and stepping aside to make room for the man to take over his job. As Dean headed into the back to remove his apron he realised that Castiel and Gabriel looked nothing alike. For one Castiel was taller, just an inch shorter than Dean was. Not to mention Castiel had dark hair to Gabriel’s blond, and Dean was fairly certain Gabriel didn’t have blue eyes.
“I am aware of it, yes,” Castiel said. “What they fail to realise is that our father held me up to a higher standard meaning I had to work harder for his attention.”
The last wave died down, Dean glancing at the clock and noting it was still half an hour until closing time. He grabbed the broom, deciding to clean the store early. If it was anything like the last week they wouldn’t have many more customers. Dean wondered if maybe the sweet shop had finished its scheduled pickups, although he still saw a few customers heading into the store.
“Good,” Sam said. “I’ve got an amazing history teacher. Really keeps you engaged. Maths sucks though.”
“It is a bit,” Dean said, feeling a slight pang. He did miss Sam. “It’s harder not knowing when I’m going to see him again. But like I said – we talk every weekend.”
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Benny said. “If word gets out you helped her then you’re done in town.”
Dean swallowed nervously, not able to look Gabriel in the eye. There was something about Gabriel’s tone and light heartedness that was relieving though. “So you’re not here to fire me?”
“I was always fairly average,” Dean said. “We moved around so often it was hard to just sit back and study. I spent most of my free time looking after my brother so I couldn’t really focus on school.”
“I thought maybe you could give me a little bit of money,” Anna said, eating a bite of her cake. “In in return I could make it worth your while.”
They found a table not far from the jukebox, Dean able to appreciate the music. It seemed to be a mixture of classic rock and some old school pop and R&B. They settled in, Dean picking up the menu and delighted to find they served BBQ bacon cheeseburgers. Bobby ordered something a little lighter and less greasy.
“So the usual then,” Dean pulled on his jacket and picked up his bag, giving the room a once over to make sure he hadn’t forgotten anything. “I’ll meet you at the car.”
“Let’s see…” Kali said, ticking them off on her hands. “Michael’s the oldest, then Lucifer, Raphael and Gabriel. Then there’s Metatron, Uriel, Zachariah, Naomi, Anna, Ishim, Balthazar, Castiel, Anael, Gadreel, then Hannah and Samadrial.”
“We had a routine,” Castiel said. “We each had our roles. We knew what we had to do to pack up and move from place to place.”
“Perhaps,” Castiel said. “As I said – they took significantly more money last time. It is why we keep a minimum amount of money in the till.”
“You’re lucky then,” Gabriel said. “My family is seriously messed up, but it’s not as bad as she pretends it is. I sometimes think she does it for attention.”
“I see it’s wasted on you,” Crowley said. He stopped by Castiel and looked down at him. “I hear congratulations are in order.”
“Okay,” Sam said. “Crowley says we’re on the clock so hopefully I can come up with something. It certainly narrows down the search.”
“Wipe them all out,” Crowley said. “I don’t care if you turn their pelts into a coat. I just want them dead.”
“Dean, I am here you know,” Gabriel said. “Kali and I don’t do much on Sunday’s. We’d happily take a day to show you around. And if you want information on the town go ask Benny. He knows everything about everyone. And if you’re truly desperate I could hook you up with Castiel. That kid actually needs friends outside of his studies. And if you want someone closer to your own age I could introduce you to Hannah and Samandriel.”
“I’m assuming a lot of sugar,” Castiel said, wandering over to peer into the bag. “That’s what he usually sends.”
Castiel crossed back to the bed and dropped down to sit on the edge. He closed his bond with Dean so he wouldn’t have to see what Dean was going to do. He knew enough – that Dean was feeling the bloodlust of the Mark. That he had a purpose to the torture. That he was actually looking forward to doing it. Castiel had to remind himself that Dean was a demon. His Dean would never have agreed to torture again.
Sam set his jaw and stared at his phone. He was torn. The voice on the other end sounded like Dean and talked like him, but his actions were counter to everything Sam would expect of his brother. He wondered if the Dean he had known truly was dead. After all, the last time Sam had seen him was on his bed with no life left in him.
“I think I’ve already got it out of my system,” Dean said. “Spent my whole life on the road. It’s nice to just settle down.”
“So I understand,” Castiel said. “Dean is resting now. It will take him some time to recover. What he has done weighs heavily upon him.”
“Not going to happen,” Dean said. “Mind you you could give me Metatron. Five minutes alone with him and I will have Castiel’s grace.”
“We must move quickly,” Hannah said. “While it is not a threat now as the Nephilim grows it will gain strength. Even in the womb it will be dangerous. It is essential that we find it as soon as possible.”
“That girl isn’t quite right in the head,” Benny said. “Take everything she says with a grain of salt.”
When Saturday had rolled around Dean could feel Bobby’s eyes on him as he wandered around in the morning. Dean had chosen to spend the morning on the couch just reading, Bobby puttering in and out of the flat to do a few different things including the laundry and a few odd jobs that had built up over recent weeks.
Swinging out of his chair Sam headed deeper into the bunker to begin gathering his things. Crowley was going to have a lot of questions to answer.
So that explained that. Castiel had been wondering how Dean had managed to escape what Crowley claimed to be one of the most secure rooms in Hell. He should have expected that Dean would feel some of the power over their connection. He absently wondered if Dean was still trying to use it to escape.
Castiel raised his eyes toward the roof and felt warmth spread through him. Sam knew he must be alive and still had enough faith in him to pray. Castiel smiled for the first time in a long time, silently thanking Sam. Even though he couldn’t hear the words that were being said just knowing that Sam was there was enough for Castiel. When he eventually escaped he would personally thank the younger Winchester. Knowing Sam was praying to him gave Castiel hope.
He could hear them tailing him as he walked through the corridors and up to the throne room. He stepped inside just as a group of Crowley’s advisors were leaving. He could tell from the looks of their faces that the meeting hadn’t gone well, so Dean braced for Crowley to be in a bad mood. Stepping into the room he spotted a servant on their hands and knees scrubbing blood up off the stones. Dean had missed seeing one of the advisors injured so he wondered if the body had been removed long before he arrived.
The trip in the car had been filled with Dean’s grunts and groans of pain, Sam driving as fast as they could to the nearest hospital. Castiel had sat in the back with Dean, gently cradling him again him and trying to alleviate some of the pain using his grace. The pain seemed to be coming in waves, Dean groaning long as he held his abdomen.
“Not enough to get a charge,” Gabriel said. “Trust me, he was punished. It might not look like it to the outside world but he was. Took a while before Dad spoke to him again and that’s punishment in itself.”
Dean started, not placing the gravelly voice at first. He turned, looking into the dark and spotting the other man standing below the street light, the light almost causing a halo effect over his head. Dean retrieved his keys, sliding them back into his pocket and approaching the other.
“Honestly I think I’d take that over Christmas with the Shurley’s,” Kali said. “It is always uncomfortable. Nobody really wants to be there but Chuck insists on it. They don’t give gifts because they already have what they want. It’s mostly just a whole day of bragging and putting each other down.”
“It was a matter of coincidence,” Castiel said. “Two police officers walked into the Sugar Heaven as we were being robbed.”
He wiped the blood from his hands onto his clothing. On the way down to the cell he had been jumped by at least three alphas. He had made short work of them, slaying them quickly and leaving their bodies for someone else to clean up. Most alphas seemed to be hanging back but he had been able to sense their desire to mate him. He knew his omega scent was most likely driving them insane.
“Place is practically dead now til closing time,” Gabriel said, pulling up a chair. “My assistant can handle things in the meantime.”
“Hey Benny,” Dean said, glancing once more at the couple and seeing them look away again. “What’s got people chatting about me?”
“Yeah, I’m good,” Dean said, glancing up and seeing Gabriel hugging Castiel who looked awkward in his embrace. “Just a little shook up.”
“Figured he might,” Dean said. John was known for his rants. “I guess that means you won’t be coming to visit anytime soon.”
He didn’t. They made it through the rest of the film without further incident. They finished their snacks and drinks, Dean dropping the waste into the bin on the way out of the cinema. Castiel remained quiet as they walked back out to the car. Dean wondered if he should mention what had happened but decided against it.
He blinked again, his eyes going back to their normal green. He pulled at his shirt and stared for a moment at his mating mark. The bruising was long gone now, leaving only the scar from where Castiel had bitten him. Dean kind of wished that when he and Castiel fucked that Castiel would bite him there again, but he knew that the likelihood of that was slim to none. Unless, of course, he convinced Crowley to mix up another rut potion. That week with Castiel had been fun, even though Dean had known that it wasn’t truly Castiel that was behind it. He absently wondered what Castiel would be like in bed if it was fully consensual. He had a feeling he’d been gentle and sweet.
“The Moose is not really a problem right now,” Crowley said. “He still doesn’t know you’re a demon, and he hasn’t yet realised Feathers is missing.”
Dean glanced down at his packet of chips and absently remembered that he was worried about the fact Crowley might poison him. He set the bag back down on the counter. Crowley watched his move with some interest.
Sam nodded. He figured they wouldn’t drop that given how important it had seemed to them. “So you’re wanting to use me as a middle man again?”
“What? No!” Dean set his jaw and stared at a spot on the table. “I was just trying to make a friend.”
He looked up as he heard the bunker door open. He knew Sam was in bed, Dean reflexively reaching under the table for the gun holstered under there. A feeling of reassurance washed over him and caused Dean to smile. Castiel was home.
“Just thought I’d come check on you.” Crowley reached out, turning Castiel’s head and inspecting his neck. “So he hasn’t bitten you yet. Interesting.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. It was an obvious answer. There was no way in hell he was going anywhere with Castiel with his ear like that.
Dean did feel a bit intimidated though. If he messed this up Bobby might be the one who had to wear the consequences. He made a mental note to have Bobby double check all of his work before he gave the car back to Castiel. That way if he did make any mistakes Bobby would be able to catch them before they became a bigger problem.
Dean suppressed the groan he wanted to make, standing up again and beginning to sweep the floor while Kali cleaned the machines. She had him stack the chairs onto the tables once he was done sweeping and then gave him a mop. Dean was instantly thankful that the coffee shop didn’t have toilets as he had a feeling that he’d be stuck cleaning them if it did. He was the rookie after all and he’d heard horror stories.
“Pleased to hear it,” Dean said, pushing the trench coat onto the floor and working the jacket off after it. “Now get naked.”
“Aside from being able to kill you are useless,” Crowley said. “You can’t even smoke out of that body of yours. You can’t do deals without messing them up. Your first thought is to destroy everything you touch. And you refuse to kill Moose and Feathers which means you’re compromised.”
Dean nodded, staring down at his paper and frowning. “You know both of Cas’ birth parents are dead right?”
“Seems you’ve made an impression on him,” Gabriel said with a smile and a wink. “Hear you’re planning on making Saturday’s a regular thing.”
Crowley pulled a notepad out of his pocket and wrote down an address. “This is where my people are based. They can tell you where to find the werewolves. Just one thing,” he said before he gave Dean the note. “I don’t want any of my people harmed. They are all needed for an important operation. You harm them and I will beat you senseless.”
“It will only be a matter of time,” Castiel said. “You are a demon after all, and the Mark demands blood.”
The lackey finished giving their report, Crowley waving that they were dismissed. They bowed their head and headed out, another minion stepping forward to take their place. Crowley squinted at him and recognised him as the demon in charge of arranging crossroad deals. He had a stack of papers, no doubt the latest list of deals.
Letting out a long breath he resigned himself to his situation. There was nothing he could do about it now. All he could do is keep looking for a way out and take it should the opportunity present itself. All he could do for the moment is wait.
“Gabriel says that it’s because I read too many educational books,” Castiel said. “I have also read the dictionary.”
“Destroy me,” Dean finished. “And Crowley will kill you. You keep saying that but you don’t know for sure.”
“He didn’t abandon you,” Kali chastised. “The plan always was he’d work for you until he saved up enough to put toward college.”
“Just don’t leave it too late,” Bobby said. “There’s two types of college students – those that burn the midnight oil, and those who hit the hay early. You don’t know which one he is.”
“So you can convince him to give you more money?” Gabriel said. “I told him to stop lending to you.”
“That kind of sucks,” Dean said, although he could kind of sympathize with Lucifer. It was kind of like his situation with his own father. “Lucifer doing alright now?”
“So he said,” Dean said. “Wants to top his class and graduate with honours, then get his Masters and Doctorate.”
“View it any way you want, Cas, it doesn’t change the fact it happened,” Dean said. “So live with it.”
It was dark by the time that Sam arrived at the empty warehouse. He spotted the other car already there and knew that Hannah was waiting for him. Sure enough he saw her climbing out of the car as he pulled in. Sam gently caressed the Impala’s steering wheel before he turned off the engine and climbed out, heading straight to the rear of the car and opening the trunk. He pulled out the bag from inside as Hannah walked over to him.
He felt a rush of anger flow through him, Dean throwing himself forward and slamming the angel back into the wall. He twisted his wrist and slammed the First Blade into the angel’s gut. The angel gave a cry as he glowed, the light burning out of him as he died.
Every so often he glanced over at a little stick sitting on the table. He had finally convinced himself to buy a pregnancy test. It had been two weeks and he hadn’t noticed any changes so he was starting to wonder if Castiel had lied to him. Castiel wasn’t one to lie about things like that though, so Dean had bought the test. He felt stupid peeing on the little stick, but now he had to wait for it to tell him.
Dean looked down at Cas, a strangely vulnerable expression on his face, but Cas merely gave him a sleepy, gummy smile, which made Dean go all soft and philosophical again, and say, ‘Well, the state says we have to foster them for six months before we can adopt, so we’re, what, almost halfway through? But, uh, I’m pretty... I’m pretty happy, how ’bout you, sweetheart?’ he asked, looking down at Cas.
voice, but he managed to reply, ‘Heya, Castiel,’ without sounding like too much of a moron, ‘I’ll call the shop and have them send the tow truck over. Depending on parts, I should have it back to you within two weeks.’
‘You know if you keep this up, you’re really gonna have me convinced you have a bun in the oven,’ Sam grumbled, as he stood, and started walking out to the parking lot with Dean. ‘Don’t think I won’t drop you off at some home for unwed mothers.’
Cas loved the flowers, and displayed them proudly on the counter, like he always did, and surprised Dean with a beautifully set table with takeaway, ironically, from that French restaurant from their three month date. He used his sexy, sexy, French skills to murmur all sorts of indecent-sounding nonsense (for all Dean knew, Cas could be saying ‘pass the salt’, but tell that to Dean’s dick), and ended the meal by conjuring up an apple pie seemingly from thin air.
‘You won’t be alone, Jack,’ Dean promised adamantly. ‘I’m not going to leave your side. You’re stuck with me now, buddy.’
from Dean hanging up the phone as he climbed the porch steps. He went over to Dean, and gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek, ‘Hey you.’
‘It’s fine, I don’t mind,’ he said easily, separating the frozen foods to be put away in the freezer, ‘Is, uh... Everything okay?’
It was really only a matter of time, but eventually Claire came home from school one day hand in hand with a tall girl with dark hair and eyes, whom Cas could only assume was Kaia. After a few rounds of awkward introductions, Claire and Kaia darted off to Claire’s room, Dean calling ‘and leave the door open!’ after them. (Cas imagined he could
Dean wasn’t surprised at all to find that Jack had ignored both the table and chairs when he, Jody, and Sheriff Barker entered the room. Instead, the kid was kneeling on the cold cement floor, head bowed, gripping his wrists behind his back in an achingly familiar way. The aforementioned clothes and food stacked neatly on the far side of the tabletop, like Jack was afraid to get any closer, lest he be tempted to tear into the packages of chips and candy bars. From the look of his emaciated body, it was probably taking everything he had not to do just that.
Cas nodded knowingly, and watched as Dean and Benny hoisted the dragon into the truck bed. Charlie reappeared then, having been popping in and out of their company all day, as various friends and acquaintances had stopped by to pay their respects to ‘their queen’ (Dean would definitely have to get more details on that later), and punched Cas in the arm.
‘Hey!’ Dean said, rubbing an affectionate hand over the dashboard consolingly, ‘Baby’s a classic. Now,
‘Not like I’m gonna melt,’ Cas replied lazily, the wine he’d indulged after Dean’s repeated assurances that he didn’t mind, making him slow and affectionate, ‘We can run.’
, Jack, you’ll see. NRR — the center — the whole point of the place is to help omegas heal and feel safe, and... And learn how to be happy. It takes time, but it does happen, ya gotta believe me.’
The second floor had three more bedrooms, and a bathroom, and Joyce was explaining the attic and basement situation, as well as the acreage the property came with, which included a pond and small slew of apple trees, but Castiel was hardly listening by then. He waited until they returned to the first floor, and for her to take a breath, then said quickly, ‘Joyce, would you excuse me for just a moment? I’d like to make a quick call.’
,’ Dean mumbled, and leaned over to give Cas a kiss. ‘Mornin’, sweetheart,’ he said, his voice still sleep-rough. ‘Ready to promise ‘til death do us part’?’
Like stars colliding — or perhaps like thunderclaps and lightning strikes — their bodies found each other, and Dean laid Cas down on top of discarded sketches and piles of drop cloths, and kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him, until there was no air between them that hadn’t touched both their lungs, and Cas used his clever artist’s fingers to work Dean open, and then they made love right there on the floor, the flickering yellow candle light dancing around them, casting obscene shadows on the wall, like they were putting on a puppet show for the entire universe without shame.
Dean didn’t want to argue with Cas, not when he was still so weak from surgery, but he vehemently disagreed. He made a vow to himself to remember this godawful day for the rest of his life, because he never wanted to forget the sick terror he’d felt at the thought of losing Cas. Once things settled down, he was going to get his shit straight... He’d always refused therapy before, despite Sam’s claims that it had worked wonders for him in processing their parents’ deaths.
‘Still an old man, though,’ Claire sniffed dismissively, though Dean saw shoulders relax as she grabbed her leather jacket, and slung it over her arm, ‘I needed tampons and Midol anyway,’ she said casually, a clear challenge in her voice.
On a whim, Dean brought home a huge bouquet of white roses, secretly loving that Cas secretly loved getting flowers. They reminded him of the flower he’d pulled off old batty what’s-her-tits-who-lived-next-door-to-his-old-apartment’s rose bush way back when, and Cas had stuck it behind his ear (the dork), then accidentally admitted to an entire coffee shop that he was in love with Dean. He liked giving Cas the daisies, because they reminded Dean of the mural on their living room wall, but he
Jody pulled into the North Cove Police Station where her friend, Sheriff Christine Barker had called her from, and shifted the SUV into park. She shot Dean a tight smile, and asked gently, ‘You okay, kiddo?’
‘Really?!’ Claire exclaimed, and Dean handed her the letter. He watched her eyes dart across the page, and a smile slowly grow on her face. When she reached the bottom, she looked up at him, beaming, and said, ‘I really did it! I got in! I gotta go tell Kaia!’ She gave Dean another quick hug and dashed upstairs, bad mood entirely forgotten.
‘Dean, you just made nearly a thousand dollars in one afternoon,’ Cas scolded him gently, ‘That alone should be proof you shouldn’t refer to your work as ‘this crap’.’
Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, nothing he came up with could possibly compare with the real thing. In some ways, he was incredibly embarrassed about his fixation and lack of professionalism, but despite his best efforts, he found himself unable to stop thinking about the generous, mysterious man with the beautiful eyes who was slowly but surely becoming the highlight of Castiel’s day.
‘For fuck’s sake, Dean — by that standard, your ride is a forty-two year old female named ‘Baby’... Now which one do you think sounds more absurd?’ Cas shot back, quirking his own eyebrow.
Benny lived somewhere outside the city limits, in the middle of nowhere (‘BFE’ or bumfuck Egypt’ as Dean would say, a remnant of being raised by a military man, if only for a while). Cas was immensely grateful for the GPS system Dean’s uncle and aunt, Bobby and Ellen, had given him for their first Christmas together a few months prior, even though it had them going down deserted country roads, getting increasingly farther from civilisation until the GPS told them it was
‘Probably the same kinda asshole who decides to move house in March,’ Benny replied easily, with a grin, ‘Ain’t nothin’ you can say that’s gonna get me goin’ today, brother.’
‘I’m just glad you’re alright,’ Kevin says quietly, earnestly, ‘Just... That’s all.’ He looks at Bal like a scared child might regard their parent during a thunderstorm, like Bal might have the answers to the universe hidden inside his clenched fists and wrinkled brow. Kevin looks at Bal like he matters, and it makes his throat feel tight, and he nods again.
There might be more words, maybe some more tears, but when they finally collapse back into bed, they do so together. Cas folds Dean into his arms, and something inside Dean
‘No, he doesn’t,’ Cas interrupted, ‘And this isn’t about Ian. It’s about me, making a huge commitment. I mean, we haven’t even been together a year, you know?’
or whatever the hell awkward shit Cas had just said, and meets Dean’s heavy lidded eyes for all of three seconds before he
Instead, he found himself stupidly optimistic every morning as he rode his motorcycle down the familiar route to The Daily Grind, (the coffee shop he managed, cos Castiel was nothing, if not living the dream), due to the mystery mechanic who came in every day at quarter to seven, ordered an hot drink with so much espresso, Castiel was surprised it didn’t dissolve the styrofoam cup, paid for his drink with a twenty dollar bill, and dumped all the change he got back into the tip jar. Every. Single. Day.
his friend looks as he settles back down on the log, running his fingers over the surface of the wood just like Balthazar had done half an hour earlier. He smirks a little at that — even all these years later, he and Cassie remain twin flames, family in every sense of the word. He sits back down himself, and leans lightly against Castiel’s shoulder. Cas, in turn, leans into his, and they sit there, pressed against each other, supporting each other, until it’s time to head back inside.
Dean was actually having a great time playing chauffeur, despite the extra pressure he felt to make sure he was in absolute control of his movements at all times, because despite Cas’s reassurances, he remained mortified over the accident. As it turned out, Cas was decidedly
engraved above their names and dates, because it came from Mary’s favourite song. It had been absurdly expensive, but luckily, their estate covered the cost, with a substantial amount left over.
‘I don’t think it was about changing my mind, babe, just about making me see sense,’ Cas replied honestly, ‘Dean, I would love to live with you, and I would love to live with you
Thankfully Ms Robinson took the stage again then, and announced that they were on their last performance of the night, and a moment later, Claire stepped onto the stage, looking like she might faint. She sat on the stool in front of the microphone, and held a piece of paper in her hand that was shaking slightly. Cas saw her take a deep breath, then begin.
‘Where’d you find him?’ Jody asked, in her brisk, no nonsense way, flipping through the file, ‘And has anyone come forward to report a missing omega?’
After dropping Cas off at the coffeehouse at 04:15 on the dot, Dean would return to his own apartment, and putter around for the next few hours until it was time to head back out for work, and his second stop by The Daily Grind. Cas had stopped charging him for his coffee as a thank you for driving him in, so Dean had taken to throwing his cash straight in the tip jar, despite Cas’s protests. It was kind of comforting — this mundane daily routine they had fallen into — and Dean was actually sort of dreading the day he finished the motorcycle repair, because it would mean an end to those few stolen minutes with Cas in the morning.
‘Oh stop it,’ Charlie rolled her eyes, ‘No, I’m totally glad you’re not worm chow, cos, listen, what do you think about making a sculpture for my next Moondoor event? I can’t get that dragon out of my head, and I would totally throw all the dollars your way to make it happen.’
Cas pulled him into an embrace then, and pressed their foreheads together. ‘You should have told me you felt this way,’ he scolded lightly, ‘We could have left at any time. Let’s go grab our coats and leave now.’
Now that he was in junior high, Jack joined the after-school art club that would paint murals on the school walls, and was beside himself with how cool he thought it all was. He also mentioned wanting to play baseball in the spring, and shyly asked Dean if he wouldn’t mind practicing with him. Dean’s only real experience with the sport was a few times throwing a ball around with Bobby, and one notable Minor League game he’d caught during a road trip across Canada after high school, but he was so moved by the kid asking him that he just couldn’t say no, and this is how he found himself in the backyard after work three times a week, trying to learn how to pitch a ball well enough that it was actually useful to Jack.
— he just didn’t think it would happen so soon. The headaches, which had been a consistent hum of misery in the background of every day with peaks and valleys of intensity had escalated to the forefront of almost every day. This tied in with the nausea that made even the idea of eating almost unbearable, and anytime Dean felt brave enough to even try to choke down a protein bar or piece of toast ended up with him doubled over the toilet, retching horribly not ten minutes later.
"That went well" Dean said and Cas just smiled and gave him a kiss "come on, you can show me how to make lasagna"
She rolls her eyes "Yeah we did, but you are making a face like you are thinking about something very hard" she pauses for a moment "you had someone in your future, didn't you?"
While she was on her phone Cas and Dean exchanger a glance, both realising that they forgot about the fact that Sam had dreams about the future, that could be a problem, a big one. But for now they would keep quiet, not wanting to load even more on Jess' shoulders right now. They would talk later when Jess cooled down from the happenings of the day.
In the end everything went the way it should. Dean heard Jess talking with Brady and then saying the exorcism - she was good, no stuttering or stumbling over the latin words. When she came and got him her face was a bit pale but that's it.
Finding the mine wasn't that hard as well, turns out you are able to remember more things than you thought. But now came the hard part - freeing the victims and killing the monster.
He shook his head he couldn't do that. Let history repeat it self and letting innocent and people he loved die. No. He had to do something - just where should he start? His eyes darted to the window of the apartment he just came out of.
"Wow there, what happened to you?" a voice to his left asked. It took him a few moments to realise that it was Dean talking. Right Dean - they were on their way home. Home to Jess, he calmed down.
"Thanks, neither Sam or I can cook - just some basic things so most of the time we just order. A homemade meal is a nice change." She goes into the kitchen and he hears her happy scream "you made lasagna?!"
to get this one!"). It was messy, with cheap decorations and way to many fairy lights...he loved it. Under the tree there was one small package in opposite to the tree it was neatly wrapped.  He went to the tree and put his own present next to the small one. Then he wrapped his arms around the dark haired man who failed to notice him because he was busy squinting at the tree.
Hours away from Blackwater ridge Sam Winchester woke up abruptly. He looks around then stood up looking out of the window he could see the impala.
On the drive back they stopped at the store and got some paint remover and a throw away phone for Dean so they could stay in contact. He tried to tell her that she doesn't have to do that, that he could hustle some pool and get money so he could get his own phone. She shot him an unamused glare and he shut up.
He laid the ingredients down to open the door. Cas was god knows where - probably organising a store room.
"Hey Sam" she says surprisingly happy "yeah I'm fine, I'm on my way home right now...what about you?...mhhh okay...listend I'm sorry my phone is nearly dead, I will call you when I'm home okay?...Yeah love you too, bye! And say Dean I said hello!"
Jess just nods but she doesn't seem convinced. Dean starts the car again. While he does Jess phone starts to ring
"And the last thing:" He grins "this is a journal, nearly every hunter has one so...yeah" he shrugs again.
"I'm sorry" is the first thing he says after Jess wakes up completely. They are on an empty street. Cas is sitting next to Jess, while Dean is driving. They decided, that Cas would heal and clean Jess - it wouldn't take much mojo and hopefully heaven wouldn't think about it.
"Uha a uhm..." Dean stuttered "right pocket" was all he magnet to get out before he looked everywhere but at Cas.
His head was empty, he had played out what he wanted to say in his head in the last ten minutes but now it was all forgotten.
Two hours later they sat in the car on their way to Nebraska. They changed funny stories and Dean and Cas gave Jess some hunting tips. About an hour away from their destination (Dean was pretty sure they were heading the right way) the who would call Mary came up. Dean and Cas discussed if they had a secret the other didn't know about causing a death but came up with nothing. They had spend the last days telling each other so many things, things they felt guilty about, secrets and wishes. Cas said they could try to use one of the victims as a bait but he didn't like the idea, neither did Dean or Jess.
"Are you sure?" He asked Jess the tenth time in the span of half an hour, she just nods and grids her teeth together.
They found a motel half an our away from the shop the mirror was kept in (the fact that they had to search through three small towns did nothing to lower Deans enthusiasm that he had remembered nearly exactly were they had to go). They booked one room with two beds - Jess had no problem in sharing a room with the two of them and Cas and Dean had no problem in sharing a bed, so they could save some money.
He couldn't finish his sentence because there was the sound of a key turning in the lock of the door. They reacted fast, Dean closed the books and Sam was up to put them in the shelf but Jess was faster. They froze.
Cas lashed into an explanation how he was an angel but not a very good one. After he finished Jess only said "okay"
Dean smiled and shook his head "Cas has his angel blade - it's kind of an allrounder so it is fine. We are trying to get more angel blades but they are very hard to get so we have to be happy with those" he tapped the knife.
"If you want to we can take you on a hunt, nothing big but just so you learn how to react when something is going south ." he shrugged and looked at Cas, he seemed okay with the idea. So did Jess.
In their spare time they clean and organised the bunker - it was a pain in the ass the first time around but knowing the bunker had been organised and cleaned by them once was an even bigger pain.
"Jess! Calm down! I'm fine. Th people in the hospital are the ones who were attacked but they should survive."
The light flickered to life and he could get a prober look. It looked exactly like the first time he opened the room, what shouldn't be a surprise but somehow still was.
He picked the first one up "Cas and I did some digging and found two of these - I kept one and this is for you. It's a demon killing knife. You can kill lower demons - so no yellow or white eyed demons with it, and no knights of hell but the one left won't be a problem until later."
The next morning when they sat down for breakfast it was Sam who brought it up "by the way, what did Clara told you?"
Jess sights again and sits next to Dean, Sam is still standing at the shelf "Okay lets get that down...first you" she looks at Dean "turn up here saying that your Dad is missing and that he was on a hunting trip, doesn't ring much of a bell for someone who doesn't know about your kind of hunting. Then you come back and your clothes are dirty and in Sams case bloody, not to talk about the wounds on his chest." Jess gives Sam a pointed look "you didn't really thought I wouldn't realise?" He swallows but says nothing. "That
"Sam?" he guessed and she nodded. "Seems like the two checked into a motel and both of you are okay"
Dean sighed "Fuck it" he said and took a step at Cas collecting every bit of courage he had in his body closed his eyes and kissed him.
Dean persuaded him to loose the suit (but he keep his trench coat (Dean won't admit but he liked the stupid coat)) so now he was dressed in a dark jeans, a black shirt and a blue flannel which was rolled up. Dean hadn't thought that Cas had any fashion sense but he was wrong, and if he was honest Cas' goddamn DocMartens did drive him crazy. He swallowed
The next day Dean was teaching Jess how to shoot - she already was good at it but improvement was never wrong and some basic hunting stuff, what kills what, some fighting techniques and so on.
"Okay next thing" he picked up the ring "this ring is made out of iron and has an anti-possession sigil engraved - so if a ghost comes near you, you can punch him, not the best way but it brings a bit of savoy if you don't find iron near you. I don't think I have to explain the anti-possession thing?" she nodded while she took the ring away from him and slid it on her middle finger - it fits perfectly.
Jess nodded eagerly "Sound good, and Nebraska isn't that far away. I talked to Sam earlier, they are going to be home tomorrow night. SO if we start driving now we can be there in four hours? We can burn the remains and then I catch a flight back home. How does that sounds? "
One month later, at Deans birthday, Cas gifted Dean with and identical ring. Unlike Cas, he had put the ring on his chain for fear of losing it - not everyone can magically attach a ring to their finger, where it now hung next to the cross pendant filled with Cas' grace.
Cas did his best trying to heal them but the usually light coming from his palm was more a flicker than anything. He could heal the biggest wounds so that they wouldn't be life-treating anymore but after that he was pale. To pale for Deans liking.
he thought as the Wendigo attacked again. He couldn't use the flame-thrower in so little space, theoretical it would kill the Wendigo but them as well, so no.
"Good then my point stands. We are going to eat this pice of heaven then paint the frames and catch some sleep, do you know when you and Sam are back?"
Jess told them that Brady had woken up but won't talk. He has some wounds on the inside but nothing life-treating. They only thing the doctors couldn't explain was how so much sulfur got into his system.
Sams brother just... from the future. 2020 to be exact. I know how that sounds, but you have to believe me. I woke up here right when younger me and Sam started their fight and then snug out. I don't know how this happened because I'm pretty sure I just died, and no offence but this isn't heaven because I was in heaven and heaven looks different, so does hell by the way. Now I'm planning on saving your life because in my time you are going to die in a few days. You get killed by a demon." he paused "Uhm yeah demons are real. And other things to like ghosts - the now Sam and Dean hunting one right now. Thats is kinda the family business hunting monsters and..stuff. There are also vampires, werewolves and many more. Please Jessica you have to believe me." He looked at her but cursed himself at the same time, he rambled and told things he didn't wanted to tell - like the whole death thing.  He sounds crazy not just crazy but batshit crazy.
"Sam!" Dean interrupted him "call Jess, make sure she is okay and then we will talk okay?" ha said in calm voice.
"Wanna try it in praxis?" He asked after a few hours while drinking some water. Jess looked up from the gun she was assembling and Cas sat straighter in his chair.
"I mean," she said taking a deep breath "I have a secret about a death - a secret that fits Mary's targeting strategy."
"Ah!" she interrupts him "I won't accept no, you saved my life and you are going to do so much good for the world, let me do this"
After checking in a motel he filled his bag with the essentials, flare guns and flame-thrower as well as some food and a flashlight.
"I'm going to buy the ticket myself." She pouts and Dean can't help to smile, looking behind him he can see that Cas smiles as well.
Gathering himself he righted his shirt. As much as it hurts he had to take care of Jessica before he could search for Cas.
Damnit! He was 41 and she was around twenty, he faced hell and dangerous monsters - he shouldn't be afraid of her!
They made the plan to paint a devilstrap at the ceiling and Jess would call him later asking if he would like to come over, without the demon knife or an angel blade they would have to exorcise him - that opened the question if the meat suit would be still alive or not. If yes they would bring him to a hospital if not they would have to burry him. Jessica was surprising relaxed while discussing this.
"I know, especially with the whole time traveling stuff it seems like you have lots of responsibility - and no offence but I don't want to trade places with you - but you have to know, not everything that is going to happen or what happened is your fault. You are human and humans have limits."
"What exactly? First you made a deal without telling anyone!" Cas ducked his head "then you die, telling me loving me makes you happy, a-and I didn't, I didn't get a saying in that! And you completely son of a bitch think that this is something  you couldn't have. You bastard! You always had me Cas! Always" there where tears forming in his eyes but he didn't care. "And then I died and woke up in the past, a-and I don't even know if this is
Swallowing he raised his hand again when the door opened. Hand still raised to knock he blinked at a very alive Jessica Moore who had her arms crossed in front of her chest.
On the way Dean made some calls - giving some hunters anonymous tips about a ghost in a lake, as soon as they asked about his sources he hung up but he was pretty sure they would take the bait.
"The thing with the apocalypse world...I mean yeah I was pretty beat because of mom, but - but your death, this shit hit me a lot harder because well...
That was an other point they discussed, if they should tell Sam and Dean from this time. They decided they wouldn't, they hoped Sam would tell Jess or at least Sam and Dean would stay in contact, maybe do some weekend hunts. Jess would stay in contact witch Dean and inform him about the things that were going on. Meanwhile he would go hunting, maybe some hunts Sam and Dean would have done, maybe some others. But the first thing he was going to do was searching for Cas. He had no idea where to start but he would find a way.
Opening the bedroom door was even harder than opening the front door, he thought about all the things he got over the years, the things that made this
The bunker was filled with boards full of strings, pictures and notes about cases Dean and Cas could remember, their connection and how to solve them.
"Yeah like I said, I know the basics about monsters and stuff but I still would like to know about, you know... my death" she raised an eyebrow "but I think I can't do that sober" Jess stood up "you want something?"
"It was a shoot in the dark. There are more hunters than just us...of course someone would get wind of the case."
He had to work fast and silent, problem was that the victims weren't really able to walk on their own that meant getting all of them out as soon as possible while have an eye out for the thing.
She was interrupted by Dean "Yeah I know about the men of letters, heck I live in one of their bunkers, but how do
"Bloody Mary" Jess starts giving the two of them a nervous look, she is pale. Cas lays a hand on her shoulder and gives her an encouraging nod. Dean has to take a deep breath and look away for a second - this interaction reminds him painfully of an interaction between Claire and Cas and while Jess and Claire are not really similar in a lot of things that are similar in age and bits of character. It hurts - he doesn't wants to see Claire in Jess and he doesn't, not really, but right now it is hard to separate them.
"Don't bullshit me," Dean said and he sounds pissed "something is going on with you, I just don't know what. You don't sleep and if you are you wake up like right now, you are not hungry and you haven't complained about my music the whole drive - so what's going on?"
Dean nodded and followed her in the living room. He kneeled down next to the body and checked him again.
"We knew each other for twelve years. There has always been something between us but nothing happened, to busy with all the crap that was going down and to much internalised homophobia on my side. Last year he made a deal, he didn't tell me or Sam - I think no one knew, to save someone. The deal was that this one is save and he was going to die when he was finally happy. What is fucked up because he was never really happy? Then we were in a bad situation...and he, he gave me a whole goddam speech and then he told me he loved me. And what did I say?
As soon as they heard the news about what happened in Blackwater ridge they went out. It was there were their Dad wanted them - so maybe it was their Dad.
had each other. Dean hoped he would never have to feel the lost of Cas again, he wasn't sure if he could take it.
Before he can say anything else he is tackled by the young woman "thank you Dean. Thank you so much!" she whispers in his ear and he hugs her back "no problem - you are family."
Her cousin (Cas) was an expert in theology and would help her to get some extra credit - Dean didn't understand why a law student would need knowledge about theology but okay... the other Sam and Dean seemed to buy it.
The first to steps were easy. The cars were already stocked with the essential thing he just had to get some more things.  Then he was ready to go.
He looked at Cas, he gave a nod and gave his hand a squeeze. Dean hadn't let go of his hand since the beginning of the call.
Dean and Cas exchanged a look "Jess..." Cas started but was interrupted "I will tell you - but only after we got her, okay?" They both nodded.
Dean smiled "wonderful - there is now a devilstrap under the doormat and under the bed" Jess nods and put the paint down then she looked around.
Sam always told him he should be open about his feelings. Easy to say but hard to do, especially when John Winchester raised you with his 'shoot first, ask later' attitude. It took him some time to realize how John fucked him up, if it wasn't for Bobby, Sam and later Cas... he doesn't want to think about it.
Dean huffed a laugh "its okay Jess, we talked - well about that emotion stuff. I didn't tell him what happened - thinking about it could you stay in line? We could tell him together and you can tell me if there are news about Brady"
The Wendigo attacked. Dean was fast but not that fast, he nearly wasn't able to get out of the way of the monster. His gun fell down and slid away. He was fucked.
Ofcourse the moment had to be interrupted. To be honest he kind of forgot about the people they just saved -
past because I already change so much! What is happening to the future?!" He was out of breath and Cas only blinked.
His breath stopped. That wasn't a book about theology. The book was rather old and listed supernatural creatures some could find in the US. He grabbed the other book. It was a book about supernatural creatures around the world. He saw headlines like, Okami, Pagan gods and Minotaur. He laid both books down on the table in front of him. He didn't know what to make out of this.
The tall brother came back into the shop a few minutes later, surprising Castiel again. He walked up to the other man, and tried to peer into the parking lot to catch sight of Dean, but the Prius was parked too far away. (
‘I’m not,’ Cas insisted, though the tears beginning to fall down his face suggested otherwise, ‘She was a frigid bitch. She was... fuckin’ awful.’ His face just crumpled then, and he reached for another tissue, and blew his nose. ‘I haven’t even talked to her in... Forever. I shouldn’t be acting like this — I don’t
under the legal age for a collar, but showed clear signs of having been trained as a slave, had been brought into the North Cove Police Department — Dean was halfway out the door, stomping his feet into his boots, and shoving his arms into the sleeves of his coat.
Dean muttered some more curses and complaints under his breath, but did as Cas said, and turned the car around at the end of a long driveway, and headed back in the direction they came from. After another twenty minutes of driving, they were still unable to find the street, and by then, they were both so wound up, neither felt very much like partying.
Cas frowned. He’d been so sure that Dean’s first concern would be the girls before the car, but then he thought about everything the Impala meant to him, and he wondered if maybe he’d been wrong. With this in mind, he headed into the kitchen, intending to catch Dean at the back door and find out where his head was at. Cas had no sooner entered the kitchen when Dean burst through the door, a wild look in his eyes. Even though Dean had never given him another reason to doubt or be afraid of him after the fight they’d gotten in years ago on the anniversary of his parents’ deaths, Cas took an instinctive step backwards, but then steeled himself, and went over to his partner, intercepting him before he could make it out of the kitchen.
‘Sure kid,’ Dean said easily. Claire passed the letter to him and closed her eyes. Dean slid his finger under the flap like Claire had done, and started to carefully rip it open. He pulled the letter out, and right at the top of the page in bright orange were the words
‘Didn’t think to mention that before? I woulda at least said thanks or something,’ Dean jokes weakly, still feeling ill. The acrid taste of self-loathing creeps up his throat, and he looks off to the side under the guise of rubbing the sleep from eyes, though they both know it’s something more than that that needs wiping away.
March also meant that Benny’s wedding was finally here, and thank fuck for that. He loved the man dearly, but the last year had been filled with afternoons at the garage listening to Benny bitch endlessly about Andrea’s obsession with planning their wedding — everything from flowers, to which shade of purple to put her bridesmaids in, to God knows what else. The strangest part of it all, however, was rather than commiserate with Benny’s misery, Dean found himself feeling oddly envious. He’d had never been one who expected to settle down and get married — even before he’d gotten sick — but that was before he’d met Cas.
. Somewhere in the midst of all this, he’s grabbed Cas’s hand, and he’s holding onto Cas just as tightly as Cas is holding onto him, and he’s
There was a melodramatic, maudlin thought in there somewhere, that if this was permanent, he could have done a lot worse than having Castiel be the last thing he saw, but he was too tired to fish it out, and put it into words, so instead he just let his aching head be momentarily soothed by the cool glass of the window, and waited for his brother to come back and take him home — possibly for the last time.
‘I’m his father,’ came a gruff voice from right behind Dean, and he turned to see Bobby standing there, levelling the woman with the same stern look that had always made Sam and Dean stand up a bit straighter when they were young, ‘Heard my boy had an accident with that motorcycle of his.’
‘I wasn’t a part of the decision in choosing my name,’ Cas said, a note of detached coolness in his voice that Dean had never heard before, ‘I didn’t realise this was your show. Fergus from Crowley Enterprises invited us as a thank you for some work I did for him.’
‘Fuck off,’ Dean spat, in a voice that barely contained his rage, ‘You sick fucking bastard. It’s funny how you want to talk about being a bitch, but where you’re going? Well, buddy, hate to break it to you, when word gets out that you raped a fucking kid to get there? I doubt even the criminals will stand for that shit.’ Dean gave him a cold smile, then turned away from the cruiser, eyes searching the crowd again for Jody.
The judge nodded thoughtfully, then turned to Claire and Jack, eyeing them carefully. In a slightly more gentle voice he asked, ‘Is there anything either of you would like to add before I make my decision?’
‘Oh my god,’ Gorgeous Barista said again, though this time was nowhere near as satisfying as when he’d said it only ten minutes ago, ‘Are you hurt?’
Castiel’s eyes widened, ‘Sorry,’ he said faintly, ‘My mistake, I- I didn’t mean to push.’ He shifted uncomfortably, then steeled himself, because he knew he would regret it if he didn’t at least try, and asked, ‘Hey, can I- can I buy you a drink sometime? As a, uh, thank you for fixing my bike? No mentions of festivals or side hustles, I promise.’ He smiled nervously, and wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans while he waited for Dean’s answer.
‘Would I call you Dad?’ Jack asked suspiciously, like he still wasn’t fully convinced he wasn’t about to be tossed bodily out the front door.
‘Okay,’ Dean repeated, ‘I’ll see you there.’ He snapped the phone shut, and dug his fingers into his temples, rubbing at what promised to be a pretty spectacular headache. (There was a period of time in which any instance of pain in his head, no matter how fleeting, sent him into a full fledged panic that the tumour was back, but he’d faithfully attended his checkups every few months, and the scans came back clear every time. It was almost a relief to be able to have a headache and be pissed about it instead of worried.)
‘Mr Singer is being moved to an inpatient room as we speak, so someone should be by to see you up shortly,’ Dr Myers said, and Dean, Ellen, and Jo all thanked her profusely, and went to inform the rest of the group. Everyone’s relief was nearly palpable, and Dean watched Claire take a deep breath, and blink very hard.
So tonight, he sits — considers the moment of quiet, the proverbial calm before the storm — and lets the stifling silence press in against his chest like it might do something to ease the ache he doesn’t want to acknowledge. Christ, he’s lonely.
The end of May came about, and a particularly rainy Monday marked his two year anniversary with Cas, which blew his mind. The longest relationship he’d had before that was four or five months with Lisa, before she ditched him without so much as a backwards glance or a phone call explaining why. The thing with Cas, though? It was a whole other league.
‘Just call me Dean, kid,’ Dean replied, throat tight, remembering the first time Sammy had tasted chocolate. He’d been about two. Dean couldn’t even remember the first time even
They’d tell the story later, and insert all sort of poetic embellishments of how the moment had gone — who’d gotten down on one knee, who’d prepared an impassioned speech of undying devotion, who’d broken down and cried (Dean stoutly refused to be the crier) — but in truth, it had been two simple words to reach an agreement on the biggest decision of their lives thus far, and somehow that was even better.
, and whose only other experience (that Dean knew of anyway) was pissing off a stripper named Chastity, and getting laid (and then killed) by a reaper named April... Sex with Cas is
‘I don’t really know what I saw,’ Castiel replied honestly, ‘Is... Is Dean alright? He looks like...’
‘You heard what she said?’ Dean asked, setting his phone down, and turning to Cas, a smile slowly taking over her whole face. ‘This is the best birthday ever.’
removed from his time in Hell by now, but even still, he’d had to remind himself several times that he was
Jack immediately made a beeline over to where Cas was struggling with the packing tape (again), and asked hopefully, ‘Want some help, Cas?’
‘Lemme see what Cas has to say,’ he said with a sigh, and Claire let out a little cheering noise, knowing that Cas was almost always the soft target.
that made up a surprisingly impressive salad full of cranberries, candied walnuts, and chunks of bleu cheese, despite his insistence that
Castiel’s stomach fluttered pleasantly at how Dean had shortened his name, which might have been what caused him to say, ‘Uh, well... Okay then. If you’re sure you really don’t mind...’
‘Okay,’ Claire said, sounding very young all of a sudden. Dean tentatively reached over, and put a hand on her shoulder.
‘Aw, can it, ya idjit,’ the older man said, ‘I’ve had it up to here with you shit talkin’ yourself. Told ya you had a talent for this stuff, didn’t I?’
Dean was planning on showing half a dozen sculptures, some small enough to fit on a shelf, all the way up to the dragon that Charlie had been so taken with. (He still planned to gift it to her, seeing as she would probably appreciate it more than his employees who had more than enough of his other tripping hazards to get in their way at the garage.) He’d thought about trying to bring in the bear from the waiting room, as that was the one he actually liked (‘Papa Bear’ Jo had aptly named it for Bobby, because of the baseball cap), but that thing was so massive, there was no way to transport it. As it was, he’d had to sweet talk Benny into donating his time and truck to the cause, and even still, they’d really only been able to get the dragon, wrapped carefully in drop cloths, into the bed of the truck.
Dean frowned in confusion, and pulled his wrinkled receipt from his pocket. ‘Hey buddy, I got my proof of purchase right here,’ he said, shoving the receipt in the man’s direction.
Finally, just after dinner time (which Dean and Bobby both ignored), Cas blinked himself awake, and for the first time that day, really looked at Dean, who was still holding his hand, but had slumped over on the edge of the bed, carefully avoiding Castiel’s blanket covered body. Bobby was dozing lightly in the corner, baseball cap pulled down low over his eyes.
breathe, so he might as well. He drifts off to sleep thinking that even though he’s not a cowboy or a mechanic... This timeline is turning out to be not-so-awful, after all.
. Dean didn’t understand a word of this at all, but he liked the way Dad laughed, and he liked the way the nasty policeman got tricked so the Bandit could outrun him. Dad ruffled his hair, and sang the theme song as he carried Dean up to bed, and tucked him in moments before Mom came in to kiss him goodnight, and tell him angels were watching over him.
‘Good,’ Charlie replied, shaking her hair back regally, ‘A queen expects no less. Now, are you getting your usual death-by-espresso?’
‘Nah, sweetheart, you go,’ Dean replied, kissing Cas’s hand in turn, ‘I appreciate you all coming out in the first place. We’ll get Bobby all settled in here hopefully soon, and I’ll let you know what the plan is once we have a better idea of what’s going on.’
Two days later, on June 01, 2011, the Civil Union Act took effect, proving all Dean’s anxiety to be for naught. The news showed footage of joyful couples at various county clerk’s offices. Cas watched Dean watch the news, and Dean felt the weight of his gaze, but it didn’t feel like a burden. He took a deep breath, watching Cas watch him, and said, ‘Well?’
‘Lookin’ good, kiddo,’ Dean said, making a point to sound casual, ‘Are you hungry?’ Jack flinched, so Dean hurriedly continued. ‘For food,’ he clarified firmly, gesturing to the small pile of vending machine snacks, ‘Pretty good haul here — looks like the sheriff hooked ya up with some Doritos, corn nuts, blueberry mini muffins... Oh sweet, here’s a 3 Musketeers bar! I used to love those when I was a kid.’ He picked it up, and handed it to Jack, who looked at him as though Dean might have just handed him a live grenade. ‘It’s okay, Jack... It’s just chocolate and nougat, nothing else, I promise. Look, the package is sealed all around, see?’
‘Don’t gotta be an alcoholic to wanna quit drinkin’, Cas,’ Dean replied quietly. ‘Brought out a sidea me I didn’t like, and I don’t wanna be that guy, ever again. I gotta... I gotta deal with my shit, ya know? Not just from, like, from seein’ you hurt, but from my parents, and bein’ sick, and all of it. I, uh, got an appointment next month to, you know, get my head shrunk and all that, now that you’re feelin’ better ’n everything.’
The first thing they noticed when entering was a striking metal sculpture of some sort of bear wearing a baseball cap, right in the middle of the waiting room. Castiel was immediately distracted, and went right over to it, walking around it in a circle, and taking in every detail — the piece appeared to be made entirely of a conglomeration of metal objects, masterfully welded together to create an intricate pattern of texture that Castiel very much wanted to run his fingertips over, but it was such a true work of art that he almost felt like he should take a step back like at an art show or museum.
It took quite a while to calm everyone down after that. The situation was not helped when Jack, Jesse, and Adam reappeared, looking guilty, then admitting they’d gotten tired of waiting for Cas to come back inside and finish making them lunch, and had decided to take a carton of ice cream up to Jack’s room, and had, all three of them, eaten that for lunch instead. Cas eyed Adam’s sticky muzzle with a groan, already dreading having to wrestle him into the bathtub to get cleaned. In the meantime, when Jack heard what all the drama was about, he went very quiet, and just clung to his sister for a long while.
Sam came to visit in the beginning of May, and they had a birthday party in the backyard for him, a few days late, but he didn’t seem to mind. During a lull in festivities, he and Dean took a walk through the orchard, and he looked over to Dean, hands in his pockets, and told him how proud he was of everything he’d done. They may, or may not have had a whole chick flick moment, right there surrounded by apple trees, but at least no one was close enough to witness it, and if Cas noticed Dean’s eyes looking a little red when he returned to the table, he was wise enough to not mention it.
Out of all the people he might have guessed would be on the other side of the door, Claire, Kaia, and a grey-haired police officer with ‘D Stover’ on his name tag would have been at the bottom of the list.
Typically at this point, Gorgeous Barista would give him a small smile, and tell him to have a good day, but instead today, he glanced over to his coworker, who smoothly slipped in to take his place at the register, and moved a few steps to the side to get out of the way of the line, and said, ‘I, uh, almost thought you weren’t coming in today. I was worried something might have happened to you.’
‘Well hello to you too, sweetheart,’ Dean said, a smile evident in his voice, ‘So you went back to the house without me?’
The horse and carriage ride was just as cringeworthy as Cas had imagined, but it was still at least interesting to have experienced once. Claire looked like she was torn between laughing and hiding under the seat in embarrassment, whereas Jack simply looked mortified. Dean was in a great mood, and wrapped his arm around Cas’s shoulder and made about fifty ‘Cinderella’ jokes by the time they finally pulled up in front of the Chicago City Hall.
‘So as you know... Y’all have been with us for goin’ on six and a half months now, which Jody’s been tellin’ us means we have the opti- er, choice, or, ya know, uh,
, to very possibly simply die on the spot. For being so stilted and clinical when describing anything ever having to do with sex, Cas is very possibly a cocksucking
Dean just watched him — shirtsleeves of the light denim button up shirt that he always wore to paint rolled to his elbows, flecks of paint in his hair, barefoot and beautiful, and lost in a world only he could see — and thought...
, Dean,’ he said slowly, ‘You mean cos of the fight we got into about your drinking that night? I mean, it was a bad one, sure, but you normally don’t drink like that.’
Cas let out a pitiful moan, but opened his eyes a crack, and mumbled something that sounded like ‘...’ean? Wha’...?’ before letting out a sharp cry, and bolting upward to throw up in the toilet just in the nick of time. Dean rubbed Cas’s back sympathetically, then reached up to grab the cup they used to rinse after brushing their teeth, filled it with water, and handed it to Cas.
They pulled into a motel in Lawrence just before midnight, and both all but collapsed onto their beds, exhausted from their long drive. Dean told Jack to take the first shower with a groan, and pulled out his phone to text Cas —
. Dean had somehow infiltrated every aspect of Castiel’s being, and it made him feel solid, and steady, and sure, in a way he didn’t know he was capable of being. It was as though his center of gravity had just... Shifted, and he was tethered to something more than just the earth beneath his feet. Castiel was truly, madly, deeply,
‘She’s a good friend,’ Dean observed, ‘I can tell she really cares about you... I’m glad you have her.’
Both Sam and Bobby argued with him relentlessly about going to the hospital, but Dean knew that once he walked in, he wouldn’t be walking back out, and that there wasn’t anything they could really do for him anyway. Plus, why leave behind a massive pile of medical debt in addition to all the other bullshit Sammy and Bobby were going to have to sort out after. If and when he was going to go, he was going to go on his own terms, in his own clothes, and in his own house.
‘Hey, Jack, I’m gonna step into the hall with Jody and Sheriff Barker here for just a moment, and give them the lowdown. I’d like you to eat something else while we’re gone, alright?’ Dean said lightly, knowing he would have to come as close as he could manage to ordering the young omega who was still reeked of fear. Unsurprisingly, Jack nodded, and picked up the little bag of mini muffins. He fumbled with it for a moment before finally managing to tear it open, and he raised one to his mouth and took another tiny bite, his eyes searching Dean’s apprehensively.
as he put it, Bobby and Ellen showed up, bearing booze, gifts, and a sinful looking chocolate cake that Ellen used her Mom Voice to inform Sam he would be partaking in, no matter his objections to the sugar content. (Sam, despite having a good eleven inches on Ellen, had only been able to respond with a sheepish
Dean doesn’t know what to say, but that seems to be alright, because Cas isn’t half done yet. He makes that thoughtful
Jack shot Claire a mischievous look, which made her grin devilishly, and Dean groan. Cas looked at him in confusion, and he just gestured to Claire and Jack like
Castiel made a face before he could stop himself, and said, ‘Late morning. Charlie, for all her wonderful qualities, is someone who’s going to be late to her own funeral — which incidentally will be sooner, rather than later if she keeps getting us here that close to opening again.’
using our ten year old as a buffer.’ Surprised to get no instant rebuttal to his scolding, he turned and caught Dean grinning like a fool. ‘What?’ he asked, reflexively checking his reflection in the window of the RAV to see if he had something on his face.
‘Anyway — thanks for letting me unload. It’s been... A rough few weeks. But I, uh, appreciate you being a... Friend to Dean. It’s good to know he hasn’t been alone,’ Sam said with a sniff, and ran the back of his hand over his eyes before giving Castiel a clap on the shoulder, and turning, and walking back out to the parking lot.
‘Aw, knock it off,’ he teased, ‘Ain’t no way. She will always and forever be the angry little teen who busted my nose in kickboxing at the center, and nothing you say can convince me otherwise.’
Dean took another deep breath, then forced a smile and said, ‘Hey kid — way to go, you killed it out there.’ He held his fist out, and Cas saw him swallow hard.
he was referring. Sensing their confusion, Judge Turner sighed, and pointed his gavel at Cas, and said, ‘You then. You go first.’
They picked up a few more necessities on the way out — shampoo, toothbrushes, toilet paper,  and the like — and made their way to the registers, where Claire stood, arms crossed watching their bags and bags of goodies get loaded into the cart. Her eyes widened a bit at the total, but she didn’t say anything as Dean slid his debit card through the card reader, and scrawled his signature on the screen, which ended up looking nothing like his actual signature, of course. (He often wondered what the point of signing was if it ended up looking indecipherable anyway. Benny always said he just drew stars and smiley faces, because it didn’t matter at all, which Dean was way more amused by this little quirk of Benny’s than he should have been.)
‘Gotcha. Well... Have a good one,’ Dean said, awkwardness settling back over his shoulders, as he felt the hand gripping his coffee cup start to tingle with that horrible pins and needles sensation. He switched it into his other hand, and gave a little wave as Gorgeous Barista replied
‘I do,’ Charlie said simply, sounding as though there wasn’t a single doubt in her mind, and Cas loved her all the more for it.
It isn’t long before Cassie finds him, of course, and shoves a cup of hot chocolate, of all things, into his hands. Once, he might have scoffed, been offended at the implication that he
By the time Dean and the kids (Cas just loved calling them ‘the kids’, much to Claire’s chagrin. It just sounded so... familial), returned home, sans Sam and Jess, Cas had called Roman Enterprises to let the very annoyed sounding secretary know he was able to drop off the paintings if Dick was amenable. He’d (somewhat) successfully wrapped seven of the twelve paintings, and was currently fighting with the eighth.
‘Sure am, Gladys,’ Cas called back with a grin, then realised what he’d said, and clapped a hand over his mouth hoping Dean might have gone temporarily deaf.
,’ she’d explained to him finally, ‘It’s the first thing my parents ever gave me, and the first thing I tell someone when I meet them. They might end up being just some random person, or they might end up changing my life, but it all starts with exchanging names.’ Cas found himself really impressed with that explanation, and vowed to stop feeling guilty for correcting people who mispronounced ‘Castiel’.)
‘What are you talking about?’ Dean asked, now on red alert for what could be wrong, ‘Ain’t nobody gonna take you, I already told you you’re stuck with us.’ He turned and saw Asa had stopped a few feet from them after having parked their cart behind the customer service counter, and was watching them closely, as if he were preparing himself for a confrontation.
if a pup like Sam-bloody-Winchester is going to cause him to fall to pieces right now. The long-haired man-child shouts himself hoarse, and the air gets clouded with the stench of his barely contained rage, but Balthazar
‘But, bees?’ Dean asked, ‘Couldn’t you go for, oh, I don’t know... A car or something? Get him to open up for Baby?’
The following day, he took Jack out to breakfast at his old family favourite, Jaybird’s Diner, and they ordered half the menu between the two of them. (God bless teenage boys and their insatiable appetites. Every bite brought Dean right back to his childhood... Even though it was more than half a lifetime ago, nothing in the diner had changed a bit.) After that, they took a quick tour around Lawrence, and Dean showed Jack all the old schools he’d gone to, and places he and Sam had hung out at. They drove by where Bobby’s old salvage yard used to be, and Dean was horrified to see that in the years since his last trip to Lawrence, all the cars had been cleared out, the ground levelled, and it was now home to some fancy ass apartment complex. (‘Don’t you dare tell Bobby,’ he’d warned Jack, ‘Old man’ll give himself another heart attack if he hears what some developer turned the place into.’) The second to last stop was the old family home, and Dean just sat out front for a long minute, staring at his old childhood home, but then gathered his wits about him, and drove onward to the cemetery.
It was the beginning of March by the time Dean and Cas were officially approved to be foster parents, but a mere three days after they received their approval, they found themselves sat across from a quiet, but cheerful boy, and his scowling, angry sister.
Of course, even the best laid plans were not infallible, and everything came crashing down when they came to a portrait of what appeared to be a nude young man in a darkened room, standing by a window, moonlight streaming in through the glass. He was standing at an angle where his back was exposed, revealing what appeared to be a tattoo of beautiful black angel wings that reached from between his shoulder blades down to the curve of his naked ass, and seemed as though they were caught somewhere between existing solely on the man’s skin, and starting to come alive in the room. His hips were turned
‘It really wasn’t Claire’s fault, Mr Winchester,’ Kaia spoke up hesitantly. ‘That other lady, she came zooming in out of nowhere, and hit us right on Claire’s side. If she had been just backing out like normal, she wouldn’t have smashed up the car like that. Even the police said it didn’t look like Claire could have done anything to avoid getting hit.’
.’ He finished his declaration with a bit of a growl, and nipped lightly at the side of Cas’s neck, making him let out another shuddering breath, though this time for an entirely different reason.
and then I was flying through the air, and it was like I forgot every goddamn thing I’d ever learned. And when I hit the ground, I had no idea where I was — if I was on the grass, or the road, or someone’s driveway — and I couldn’t move before I passed out, because it hurt so fucking much, and I was just praying that I was far enough from the road that someone wouldn’t run me over with their car. One of the first things they teach you is to try to pick your spot, so you know when you crash you’ll be out of traffic.’
Dean felt that familiar tingling sensation behind his eyes, so he just swallowed hard and said, ‘Okay then.’ Claire nodded, and went back to glaring at the floor.
ago, like it’s something worrying that could hurt him now, and the air turns just a little sad and guilty. Bal may always carry the weight of what the Morningstars had done to him, but with one look at his friend, sitting at his side, defeat heavy in the slump of his shoulders, he realises that Castiel will as well.
‘Come back in a month, and if it’s still gone, we’ll consider you in remission,’ Dr Barnes replied evenly, ‘We don’t use the words ‘cancer-free’ for five years, but these scans... They don’t show any evidence you’d been sick at all. I don’t know if you’re a praying man, Mr Winchester, but if you are, I think you owe someone a great big thanks.’
called Cas that night... And every night after, for that matter. And texted every morning — and sometimes in the mid-afternoon. He slipped easily back into his old routine, but now these little bits and pieces of Castiel had somehow wormed their way into the space in between, completing a part of him he hadn’t known was lacking — even before he’d gotten sick.
‘We tried to give him some clothes from the lost and found, and something to eat from the vending machine — not too much else to offer here, I’m afraid — but so far he hasn’t been too keen to accept either,’ Sheriff Barker reported sadly.
I hope y’all enjoyed this little snapshot of family life for Dean and Cas. We are fast approaching the end, but I’m going to ask you to keep the faith that I promised a happy ending, and I keep my promises... Even when things get rough, hold on to that tiny glimmer of hope, okay?
‘Fine!’ he exclaimed, ‘Get one of the people here to see if we can put the chew toy and the pit bull in a room together without them killing each other, and we’ll take ’em both. Hell, we’ll take ’em all and turn the house into some one hundred and one Dalmatians home for the absolutely insane. What the hell, why not.’
‘I didn’t come here to ‘fuck you’ at all!’ Cas yells, resolve finally breaking, his upset seeming surreal and wholly out of place with his finger quotes, ‘I came here to
The ambulance finally arrived, and the paramedics took over for Garth, commending him on his efforts. They turned to Jo and Dean and said they could take one additional passenger if one of them wanted to hop on board.
‘Well, it’s been lovely to meet you, Ishim. Truly enlightening to see how the other half lives... I’d always wondered how douchecanoes party down. If you need help removing that silver spoon from your ass, feel free to stop by the garage some time.’ He offered his best passive aggressive smile, then grabbed Cas’s arm and steered him away before Dean was any more tempted to punch that self-righteous prick in his smug, goateed face.
‘Hey, don’t tell the kid that,’ Dean protested, ‘He’s gonna think I’m some kinda of accident prone mess that always needs you to fix me up.’
‘Hey kid,’ Jody said gently after letting Dean cry it out for a few minutes, rubbing a soothing hand in circles on his back. ‘Hey. You’re alright now. You did great today, Dean. I’m so proud of you. I can’t wait to tell Cas how amazing you were. He and Balthazar are going to meet us at the hospital.’
how much worse Cas’s injuries could have been — but when he stepped back, and saw Cas’s beloved bike restored again to one glorious piece, it had been worth it.
‘Yeah, I can see that,’ Dean said slowly, trying to figure out how best to phrase his next question without aggravating his husband further, ‘But what’s with the buzzing? I thought you were having some sort of fit.’
‘Yeah, I’m fine, kid,’ Dean said, coming into the living room, and sitting down gingerly on the edge of one of the armchairs, ‘I’m great, actually. Starving, though. What d’ya say about you and me going to get some food somewhere? I could go for a nice pig ’n a poke. And maybe a good cup of coffee.’
Castiel actually laughed, and said, ‘I have... A sizeable ‘chunk of change’ saved as well. My, uh, trust fund kicked in this past year, from my grandfather, who died before he could find out what a disappointment I would inevitably become.’
By then Jo, Benny, and Meg had all gathered around, and Meg had her cell phone out and appeared to be calling for an ambulance. Jo sank to her knees beside Bobby, and grabbed his other hand, murmuring
‘How are you not dying? I think I’m dying,’ Cas whined, groping blindly for the water bottle Dean had brought in for him
For some ungodly reason, people had gone nuts for his stuff. It started with a young couple gushing over the skeleton hands, and asking for a price. Dean had stared in disbelief, every number he’d ever learned flying straight out of his head, and he’d been about to tell them just to take it when Charlie, who had been sitting between Dean and Cas’s tents on a beanbag chair she seemingly magicked out of thin air, was clearly able to sense Dean’s distress, so she stepped in and named a price that Dean thought was almost offensively overpriced, but the couple had paid it happily, and carried it off with only a little difficulty.
‘Cas-tee-el,’ he corrected, with the air of someone who had spend his whole life doing just that, ‘Hello, Dean.’
ALSO, to anyone who does actually enjoy fluff and stuff, I posted a one shot fluffy piece of Dean/Cas/baby!Jack a few days ago called
Their luck might have taken a turn at the end of the summer, when the owner of The Daily Grind announced she was selling the business and retiring to Florida, but by some stroke of luck, Cas had just been contacted regarding a huge commission from Roman Realty. Ironically, it had been Joyce, their obnoxious cutthroat realtor who had apparently recognised Cas’s name as the artist when admiring a painting at her pretentious hair salon, and had immediately gone to her boss, Dick Roman, and told him about the ‘dreamboat with the angel name’ who made ‘fabulous paintings that put Picasso to shame’, and Dick himself had called and requested Cas come in with his portfolio. Dick had flipped through it, a indecipherable half smile on his face, whilst Cas fidgeted in his seat nervously, before snapping it closed with a satisfied smack, and asked Cas if he would be willing to take on a commission for more than a dozen paintings, to hang in the many offices, hotels, and clubs that fell under the Roman Enterprises company umbrella. When he’d shared the price he’d be willing to pay, Cas had nearly fallen out of his seat in shock, and Dick, thinking Cas’s silence was reluctance, had immediately offered a number almost twenty percent higher without batting an eye. By the end of the hour, Cas was stumbling out of the office, check for half the quoted amount, and copy of the contract in hand, wondering what the hell just happened.
‘Yeah,’ Cas replied, and he looked over at Dean, with a hesitant smile, ‘I don’t think we should waste another minute.’
The ceremony ended, and even more photos were taken, then it was finally time to go home and see what Charlie had in store for them.
‘Well get up here, and come check it out,’ Cas ordered bossily, ‘Maybe after Joyce meets you, she’ll stop making comments about what my wife would love about the house.’
The Impala... Was in rough shape. The driver’s side door and bumper were dented in, the headlight completely shattered, and half of the grill looked like a crumpled ball of aluminium foil. Cas’s stomach twisted painfully at the thought that the girls had been in the car when it sustained all that damage. He swallowed hard, and stepped out of the way so Garth could ease Dean’s car down onto the driveway.
