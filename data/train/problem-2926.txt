He savored every trembling muscle under his fingers, every scar that he began to know by heart, and paid special attention to these two reddish marks among the scapula reminiscent of deep cuts. But Dean knew these marks well, and he loved them even more since he knew how to exploit them. Sitting softly on Castiel’s buttocks, he pressed his fingers against the spine of his angel before slowly pulling up each vertebra. He massaged, caressed, brushed and massaged again until he felt Castiel trembling beneath him. Dean leaned a little further forward, so that his breath now came to warm the skin of his lover’s back. He smiles, concentrating his movements on the shoulder blades, teasing the hollows and bumps of his companion’s anatomy while detailing his pale, muscular skin.
Dean stretched out at his desk before he got up. He quietly shut off his laptop and put down the glasses he used for work on top, massaging the back of his neck gently. When he turned off the light from his desk, his room was plunged into darkness and, as if to confirm the late hour, his belly began to grumble softly.
"I know you want to do the right thing, you’re a damn angel with a halo over your head." She gave him a small grin of disgust that made Castiel smile. "But what if they didn’t want to meet you? They are probably—"
"Okay…" He sighed while putting a hand on his belly. It was time for him to return to the real world.
Meg clicked her tongue while pushing the wagon towards the door.
"Oh no, don’t give me that look." She groaned, knowing that it was not good news.
"You hardly left your room in the afternoon, I thought you might need a pick-me-up."
"Meg." Castiel impatiently cut her off.
"Four cheeses Mac’n’Cheese!" Castiel proudly announced, turning to him.
Castiel shook his head on the passenger seat as they drove towards the bunker, returning from a shopping spree at the local apothecary to restock their reserve.
Dean sighed loudly.
"I’m sitting." He simply said, his fingers tightening around his phone.
"I.... I need you to close your eyes. It has to be a surprise or I.... Anyway. Close your eyes please." Castiel stuttered in front of him.
He had been happy to have decided not to listen to this voice the day he opened himself up to Castiel. Although this was greatly encouraged by alcohol, it was all but unimportant.
Castiel nodded slowly.
rose in his ears, so that he thought he had fallen into a pool while he was not paying attention to his steps. Besides, Dean wasn’t even sure where he was, now standing still in the middle of the street. Only a deep and sizzling voice gradually emerged from his torpor.
"… Are you going to punch me in the face if I say yes?" Castiel asked with distrust.
"If you keep going, we both know perfectly well that we will never finish the episode…" Dean growled gently while leaning into the embrace.
Finally, he was unable to remain angry with Castiel for having beaten him at poker, just as he was unable to detach himself from him that night. As the sun’s rays filtered through the closed shutters of Castiel’s room, Dean gently caressed his lover’s face in the hollow of the pillow with a new, fascinated tenderness. He barely waited until Castiel opened his eyes to steal another kiss before whispering against his lips.
"Besides, I thought you really wanted to know the end of
The man on the other side of the phone seemed to take a breath before resuming in an equally nervous tone.
That was the end of their conversation for the moment, as Castiel had gotten back up to continue the class. Dean continued to spend the rest of the lecture staring at Castiel, at one point he even found those piercing blue eyes staring straight into his own green eyes when Sam raised his hand to ask a question. When the class was finally over and everyone was packing up to leave, Dean heard his brother’s name called.
“Yes, just keep going. Trust me, I love this feeling.”
“Hey Ellen.” He said when the phone was picked up on the other end. “Is Bobby there?”
“That’s true. Well we are studying together on Sunday so maybe I’ll ask her then.” Sam said, his words saying that maybe he wasn’t sure still, but his face said different. Dean could see the determined way his jaw was set when he finished his sentence. There was no doubt in Dean’s mind that Sam was resolved to asking Jessica out on Sunday.
“Ohh no.” Castiel groaned, leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, our kids gonna be so fat.”
“Absolutely.” Dean said. “For tomorrow’s appointments though we will have to follow you in our own car as we will have our son with us.”
“Cas?”
“Really? What other surprises do you have up your sleeve tonight?”
Castiel started to pull out of Dean and then slam back in harder than he was before, and Dean just continued to moan and thrust his hips to meet Castiel’s, as he was now having his prostate hit on every single thrust. It felt so good that it was almost torture, and Dean kept clenching his tight passage around Castiel’s cock, making Castiel groan in pleasure above him, being the most vocal he had ever been in bed, but then again it had never felt this good for him before.
“I’m looking Jack.” Castiel replied smiling at his son.
“Yes.” Castiel replied, cocking his head almost like a puppy, as though confused by Dean’s question.
Jo suggested and hung up as soon as she was done. Dean sighed and put his phone down before walking into his room to grab his laptop and boot it up. As soon as he had it turned on he got a notification asking him to join a a skype call so he accepted and his cousin’s face popped up on the screen, looking like she was sitting at her desk in her dorm room.
“I guess now we just wait.” Dean said.
Castiel read the fear in Dean’s eyes and reached one hand up to his face to reassure him. “No, I haven’t. I’m keeping the baby Dean.” Castiel could feel Dean physically relax against him.
“Sorry to interrupt, but I did I hear the name is Kevin?” She asked politely, smiling at the baby.
The two men just stared at the screen for a little bit longer, not wanting to turn their gaze away, when a nurse knocked on the door to see if they were okay. They made an appointment for a months’ time on the way out and asked if they could possibly get a picture of the baby. The receptionist put a mark on Castiel’s file and promised that they would be able to collect the photo the following day. On the way home Castiel got a sudden urge to be sick, so Dean pulled over and let Castiel get out. After a minute his stomach had settled though, so he got back in the car and they continued back to his apartment, once they had entered however Castiel sprinted to the bathroom, Dean followed behind him. When Dean entered the bathroom Castiel was already bent over the toilet, emptying his stomach of his breakfast, so Dean knelt beside him and rubbed his back soothingly as Castiel continued to retch even after there was nothing left to come up. When he was certain he wasn’t going to throw up anymore Castiel got up from the floor and brushed his teeth to get rid of the taste, then together he and Dean curled up on the couch and watched movies all day, talking quietly and starting to make some plans.
As a result, the words were lost, the gestures became feverish to make room only for the language of the bodies. Although Dean was woefully bad at expressing his emotions, he certainly knew how to show them and Castiel undeniably liked to receive. Nevertheless, of all the means they used to warm up on the cold autumn days, this was their favorite.
"Cas." Dean sighed again as he returned to the salon with his findings.
He didn’t know what to think of this situation, it was too surreal. Was he angry with this man? No, not really. Sad? Maybe, but nothing new. Curious? Certainly. There were so many questions that now turned in his mind, almost stunning him. Never before had he heard a similar story and, yes, he was driven to the unknown by the despair of that mourn which he had never ended. But to hell with it, he
At these words Dean let out an awkward little laugh.
"What do you propose?" Castiel asked, raising a defiant eyebrow.
Meg."
Sam still loved to run in the morning to enjoy the silence and fresh air brought by dawn. Jack was expanding his collection of magnets while Sam and Dean were always careful to bring some back from all over the country. Dean was still the fastest when it came to dismantling and cleaning a weapon, but also to improvising meals when there were only three aliments left in the fridge. Castiel, on the other hand, became unbeatable on rock bands thanks to his now husband. Dean could literally spend hours playing music on his phone while questioning him about the title and the band and the Winchester had to admit that Castiel was starting to get good at it.
His own search had also given nothing and the inbox of the website that could put him in contact with his donor’s family remained hopelessly empty. Nevertheless, Castiel did not get the idea out of his head. He often dreamed of meeting these strangers, of the words he would say to them if they had the chance to do so.
" before turning to his friend.
Dean raised an eyebrow before turning completely to Castiel, sitting cross-legged on the couch. He remained silent for a moment before taking a deep breath and finally grabbing the cards that Castiel handed him.
Another kiss, on one of the marks this time, as if to contradict himself. An umpteenth happy sigh. Castiel did not complain about this brief change of rules.
, he couldn’t help but think of Dean over and over again. Finally, everything reminded him of Dean in these songs, because these tunes were each part of his own identity. Arriving at
Dean raised an eyebrow. Had he given his phone number to anyone recently? Not to his knowledge in any case, he very rarely went outside the garage in which he worked. Curious, Dean turned into a quiet street to concentrate on his interlocutor.
When Castiel let out a hoarse chuckle before drawing him closer to himself, Dean promised to do everything to hear this sound every morning now. They were going to need more games night from now on…
"Hello?" He said, picking up, his heartbeat accelerating.
”, just said he liked the simple things of life.
". He felt a strange
"Who am I speaking with?" He asked with a hint of sarcasm.
"I believe you, Dean." Castiel replied automatically with another relaxed smile.
"Thank you, Meg." He whispered.
"No!" The man quickly added. "No, I don’t want to sell you anything. I…" Another inspiration."My name is Castiel Novak. I live in Waterloo. I know this is going to sound weird, but… I received your brother Samuel’s heart."
Again, John did not move.
"Do you mean it?"
"Or will he?" teased Lucifer, earning him a smack on the back of the head from Michael.
"Why are you sorry? There's nothing you can do about it, there's nothing you could've done," said Dean.
"What book?"
"I won't but you have to be careful, Cas. Michael already has his suspicions so you're going to have to be more careful," warned Gabriel, hugging his little brother.
"Good, now wish Charlie good luck for me," Castiel said before hanging up the phone.
"She's going to be sitting with us, I hope you don't mind," said Castiel.
Michael was trying to round everyone up to leave for school. Lucifer was off double checking his secret supply of alcohol to sell at school (how he got it, Castiel had no idea). Naomi was brushing her hair for the umpteenth time. Raphael was looking for his books, which Lucifer had hidden. Gabriel was trying to sneak snacks in his bag and pockets. Castiel was the only child actually ready, just waiting for the rest of his siblings while he played with Anna.
"Dean! I don't really feel comfortable with talking about it," Castiel said, happy that the darkness hid how red his face was.
"I knew it! Sam, don't you think it's weird how Dean talks about his friend?" Jo asked, turning her attention to the little five year old.
"So what were you guys talking about?" Charlie asked.
But Dean had seen what he was looking at and looked at Andy. "He'll take that sucker."
"And that's why I like you more than Jo," laughed Dean, hugging Castiel and sticking his tongue out at Jo.
"My Father takes his faith very seriously," Castiel nodded.
"If I were to tell you it wouldn't be much of a surprise, now would it?" Dean hummed.
"We do that every other weekend already," Benny whined, laying back on the ground and pulling his hat over his eyes.
Everyone cheered, getting up and putting themselves to work. Benny tried his best to fix the roof, using some of the slats to cover the holes and an old ladder to prop himself up. Jo went about cleaning the place, dusting here and there and picking up any trash she found. Castiel was helping Dean by holding the door. He held it upright while Dean screwed back into place. And Sammy… Sam just watched them all.
“I do actually,” said Dean, “You’re still too young to hear about it.”
"You're damn right I think you would," said Dean, "Now, how much money do you have?"
"Shut up, you'd fall for a bucket if it were stupid enough," teased Dean, though he himself thought the same thing.
Castiel was sitting on the slanted roof outside his window when Dean arrived. The moon was already high in the sky by the time he showed up but Cas was fine with it. He somehow knew that Dean would be coming by this night and decided to wait. Besides, the night sky was beautiful. Stars shone brightly across the darkened sky and the moon stood there brightly, it's light bright enough to see for quite some distance.
“Dean.” Castiel whispered in a husky voice that just made Dean want him even more. “I do want you. I want all of you”
“Yeah.” Castiel replied, an identical smile on his own face. “But not quite yet, it will take me a bit of time to pack everything, and I think we should tell our families about the baby first.”
“Sounds good to me.”
“Hi Jack!.” Jody said excitedly. “You as well, hopefully we find your forever home today. Are you ready to go?”
“I just called Ellen and Bobby to let them know I won’t be in tomorrow. You hungry?”
Soon enough the pancakes were ready and so they both sat down at the kitchen island to eat, chatting generally whilst they did so. After they had finished Dean turned to Castiel with a pretty serious question in mind.
One final hard thrust and Dean biting into the skin of Castiel’s neck was all it took and with a scream Castiel came, clenching so tightly around Dean that he came with an equally loud scream of his own. Rolling off of Castiel, Dean allowed himself a moment to gain his breath back before softly padding into their bathroom and grabbing a cloth to clean them up with, simply throwing it into the washing basket before curling up in bed at Castiel’s side, pulling Castiel into him and them both promptly falling asleep.
“Hmm, so you haven’t been hoping to see Castiel every week?” Sam pushed, he didn’t want to be straight out cruel to his brother, but if Dean would just admit he had liked him and wanted to see him again, Sam could help him.
Castiel got off of Dean’s lap and walked out of the room to go have a shower. Dean did as he said he would, first ordering some food for dinner and then calling the doctor and writing down the appointment information. While he waited for the food and Castiel to finish in the shower Dean made one more phone call.
“Alright, you need to sit down Castiel.” Crowley looked at the chair Castiel normally sat on at his desk and noticed it was wet from his waters breaking. “Perhaps against the wall here might be a better option.” Crowley helped lower Castiel to the ground, and asked Bela to grab Castiel’s phone from his desk and dial Dean Winchesters number. When the phone when ringing she passed the phone to Crowley who held it to his ear just as Dean answered.
“Dean!”
“I’m free whenever you are.” Dean replied, slightly out of breath after their kiss.
Jo looked up from her book and whistled.
“I love you too Cas.”
“Okay, maybe we could see if Sam can watch Jack, so we don’t have to take him as well.”
“So close.” Castiel murmured on a particularly hard thrust.
Castiel hid his face in Dean’s neck, embarrassed at being caught. Dean just smiled and stared his brother down. “Cas couldn’t reach my keys.”
“Yes, it can. I do already tutor some students as a job, I just am rearranging my schedule this weekend as some of those students need to change the times I tutor them, so once that is sorted I will know if I can fit any more in.” Sam explained.
“Hello Mr. Novak.” The doctor said, walking into the room with a clipboard in his hand that must have held all Castiel’s details. “I have been informed that your waters have broken, is this correct?”
“This is Kevin.” Castiel said proudly.
“We should see if we can get a picture.” Dean said, still staring at the screen and holding Castiel’s hand tightly. He hadn’t let go since Castiel had laid down.
“I was just hanging out with Sam. We lost track of time a little bit. What about you? It’s a bit late to be having a study session with someone isn’t it?” Dean questioned. He was pretty sure he remembered Sam mentioning that this building was a freshman dorm, so there didn’t seem like any other good reason for why a senior would be here.
“I’m not hurt, but I umm I-I’m…” Castiel was struggling to get his words out. He was starting to sob into Dean’s chest now, which was making him even more worried about what was going on.
“I’m fine with that.” Castiel said, staring down into his sons face with a small smile on his face.
“Did you want to find out before its born, or wait like we did with the boys?” Dean asked.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel said, shifting nervously as Dean continued to stare at him.
“I know Dean, it’s not my first time looking after them. We’ll be fine. Go have some fun.” Sam gently nudged Dean towards Castiel, smiling at the way the two men almost unconsciously leaned into each other and clasped hands as though they were still a new couple.
“I want you to fuck me.” Castiel stated.
It had been about five weeks since Dean first visited Sam at college and attended his class. They had decided to make Friday night dinners together a regular thing, Dean meeting Sam at the lecture hall after his last class, them going out to eat, and finding something else to do afterwards, before Dean dropped Sam off at his dorm around midnight. Sam greatly appreciated his brother going to the effort to spend time with him, but he couldn’t help noticing the way that Dean would scan the crowd of people leaving the hall every week, as though he was looking for someone in particular. Sam wasn’t stupid, he knew exactly who Dean was looking for, but he never said anything. This particular Friday Dean arrived at Sam’s lecture hall building about ten minutes before his class was due to end. Just as he was walking towards an empty seat outside the room Sam’s class was in, he saw a familiar dark haired figure hurry from the room, almost running in the opposite direction. Dean wanted to say something to him, after all he had been hoping to see him again since they first met, but he was clearly in such a hurry that Dean figured maybe he could catch him another time. Instead he sat in the seat he was originally walking towards and waited for Sam to be finished. Ten minutes later Sam emerged from the hall, and they were walking out of the building towards the Impala.
Castiel was in shock, so much so that he could only stare for a moment, unable to make a sound. Dean was really starting to panic now, certain that he was going to get a rejection when Castiel still didn’t say anything, so he was about to get up and try and forget he ever thought this would be a good idea when he heard a slight whisper that was too quiet to make out.
“Yeah, he’s been driving us crazy actually since the day we told him.” Dean replied.
When they finished Castiel once again insisted on helping Dean, clearing the table, and rinsing dishes before handing them to Dean to stick in the dish washer. After Dean had placed the last dish in and started the wash cycle, Castiel mustered some courage he didn’t know he had and spun Dean around, pushing him back against the counter and crowding him in with his hands on either side of Dean’s waist on the counter, not touching him. “Do I get my dessert now?” Castiel asked, using what Dean was certain was the sexiest voice to ever exist.
"It's the name of an angel, my Father loves the names of angels," said Castiel, "Always have."
Tonight, Mrs. Novak had made a full meal consisting of ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, steamed vegetables, bread rolls, and the faint scent of a chocolate cake could be smelled from the kitchen. Dean had never seen so much food in his life, let alone his own kitchen. It surprised him that Castiel's father had all the money for this from being a pastor. Though he would later learn that it was customary for all Novak children to get some kind of job to help support the family.
"Always, why?" Benny asked in return.
"Who let you in?" asked Castiel, his fingers messing with his hair.
Castiel took Dean to a closet and a locked the door behind them.
Dean tucked John in and sat on the edge of the bed, using the blanket to wipe away his father's drool.
"And that's reason enough for us to not help her?" Castiel asked.
"I'm kidding!" Benny laughed harder only to let out a sharp breath from the pain.
Dean could only give her a smile and a nod before looking back at the grave, listening to her leave. It really was nice to see her again. He would have to make a mental note to take her up on her offer but for now, he only wanted to be with Cas. He only wanted to see his ocean eyes again.
“Not yet Jack. Let Dada feed him first, then you can hold him.” Jack pouted and it was so adorable everyone in the room, including the nurse, laughed at him.
“Does that feel good baby?”
“Just for being you, and for loving me.” Castiel let go then and walked back to the couch, sitting in his usual corner as Dean finished up the food and walked over to him with the two plates. They talked about their days, completely avoiding anymore talk of the pregnancy for now, as they ate, and when they were done they put on a random movie to watch. Castiel curled himself into Dean’s side, Dean wrapping one arm around him, his other hand placed on Castiel’s stomach. For Castiel it had been an exhausting day, and halfway through the movie he fell asleep. Dean considered just staying where he was and drifting off himself, but he figured it wouldn’t be the best way to sleep at all, so trying his best not to wake Castiel, Dean gently lifted him up from the couch and carried him to bed. Once he had Castiel comfortably laid down and covered with the blankets, Dean quickly went around the apartment tidying up from their meal, cleaning the mess of tissues in the bathroom and grabbing a quick shower himself, he was pretty dirty from his day at work, not that Castiel had minded all evening. Once he was satisfied that everything was cleaned enough, including himself, he went back into the bedroom in just his boxers and curled up next to Castiel, resting his head on his chest and drifted off to sleep himself. The last thought that went through Dean’s head before sleep took him was that he was going to be a father, and he fell asleep smiling.
“Everything is going to be fine Cas, Dean isn’t going anywhere.”
“Well it’s getting late. Thanks for a great night guys but we should probably all start heading home.” Bobby said, wearing a rare smile as he watched his stepdaughter and nephew fight playfully together.
The following week Castiel and Dean moved into their new house, with the help of their brothers. Bobby and Ellen also helped in their own way by picking Jack up the morning of the move and looking after him all day. With Jack not around Dean and Castiel were able to concentrate more on what they were doing, and the move went smoothly. A few days after the move they went to Castiel’s storage locker and got some of the furniture that they had left in there when Castiel had moved in with Dean, figuring they could use the bed and other bedroom furniture for the fourth bedroom which would be their guest room.
“I know that.” Bela said timidly. She had been standing near by silently since she gave Crowley Castiel’s phone, not sure if she should help or get back to work.
“Both fast asleep. So I take it your night went well though. All surprises revealed and no need for all the previous panicking.”
“Nah, let’s just stay here.” Dean argued, brushing his lips down Castiel’s neck.
Dean pulled Castiel further into him slowly until Castiel started to push himself in. Soon enough Dean could feel Castiel’s balls against his arse and knew that he was all the way in.
“Yeah, I picked it up after work today. Have a look.” Dean said as he pulled a small velvet box from the pocket on the inside of his suit jacket. It held a single silver band, simple but elegant, with three small but classy diamonds evenly spread on one side.
“We’re buying the house.” Castiel answered, not looking away from Dean.
“Yeah, it does. I think I might like a girl as well. But I would be perfectly happy if it was another boy.”
“10 years, can’t believe you two have made it this long.” Sam joked, it was plainly obvious to anyone who looked at the couple to see how much they loved each other. Even Cas laughed.
Jack is now about 1 ½ years old with brown hair like Dean and blue eyes like Castiel, and Castiel had returned to work after his maternity leave a few months ago. He hated leaving his son at day care every day, but he loved his job and had missed working a lot over the year he had off and was excited to be back. At least he was, until one particular Monday where he had to call in sick at around 8 in the morning after having been throwing up on and off for the past hour. Dean had offered to stay home with him, but he had told him to go to work, he would fine on his own, so Dean left for work, taking Jack with him to drop at day care in the way. Castiel had tried to insist that he would be okay to take care of Jack, but Dean said he should rest instead, so when he had finished throwing up and had a shower to clean himself up, he sat on the couch to rest and watch some tv. After ten minutes though he was bored. There was nothing on TV and he was already feeling better, so he went and grabbed his laptop and his phone, calling work to see if there was anything he could do from home. He got a list of correspondence, appointments and other minor tasks to do and set to work on doing them. Unfortunately without the distractions of other workers in the office, and regular memos from his boss for other things he needed to do for him, Castiel got through his list by lunchtime, and decided to order something to eat instead of making something, getting changed into something more presentable than sweats and an oversized shirt (Which was only oversized because it was from when he had been heavily pregnant with Jack), grabbing his wallet, phone and keys and heading out for some fresh air and food. It wasn’t until Castiel had entered his favorite little deli just down the street from their apartment that he got an idea about what might be wrong with him. He was standing in line waiting to order, when the door to the kitchen opened and the smell of some freshly baked items drifted out. Suddenly Castiel’s stomach lurched horribly, and he left the line to move as quickly as he could without running towards the bathroom. Surprised there was anything left in his stomach after his morning curled over the toilet, Castiel threw up again. After he was done he washed his mouth out as best he could, and ordered some lunch while he was still there, but once he left instead of going home as he had originally planned, he headed a little further down the street to the corner store instead. Making his way to a particular isle he stared at the range the store offered on what he needed, picking a brand that was on sale. Once he had paid he basically ran back to the apartment, wanting to get this done as soon as possible, and also before Dean got home from work.
“Cas, I proposed to you tonight. Sure, another baby is definitely not planned and just as big a surprise as both of your previous pregnancies, but I’m not going anywhere, no matter what life throws at us.” Dean could see that Castiel was openly crying and realised that as he was 12 weeks gone he was probably already experiencing changes in hormones and emotions, so he moved his hands from cheek and stomach and wrapped Castiel up in a big bear hug, letting him cry for as long as he needed, rubbing one hand soothingly up and down Castiel’s back. Castiel had his arms around Dean’s waist, gripping his suit jacket in both hands so tight Dean thought the material might actually rip. He was a little panicked at the idea of a third child, but he believed his own words. They would find a way to make it work and they would be fine. Once Castiel seemed to have calmed down a bit and was no longer crying so hard he leaned back from Dean and tried to smile.
“I’m okay.” Dean breathed deeply again for a minute, before locking his eyes on the beautiful blue eyes he loved so much. “Cas, we’ve been together 10 years, and I know those years haven’t always been easy. We weren’t prepared for Jack when we had him, but we managed, and Kevin was another surprise. But despite everything we have struggled through I have never been happier than I’ve been since the day I met you.” Dean paused for a moment to slip the ring box out of his pocket, and then slipped out of his chair so that he was on one knee next to Castiel. “So, Castiel Novak.” He held out the box and opened it so the ring was showing. Castiel was now staring as though in shock, a single tear falling down one cheek. “Will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?”
“Hormones getting to you tonight Cas?” Dean teased, moving his lips to Castiel’s neck.
“You too Jody. Please just call me Dean. This is my partner Cas.” He said, gesturing to the man standing beside him.
“You can call me Cas instead of Castiel if you want.” Castiel said.
“Cas?” He questioned.
Castiel and Dean looked at each other and nodded. “Your office.” They said at the same time. If they stayed there they wouldn’t get much talking done as they would have to keep trying to keep Jack away from the tree house. It was only a few minutes drive back to the office, and Castiel grabbed a toy of Jacks out of the car before they went inside, letting him sit on the floor and play while the adults talked.
Dean was barely paying any attention to what he was saying, instead he was just watching the way his mouth moved as he talked, and the way the expressions on his face changed depending on what he was saying. The first half of the class passed that way, Dean basically just staring at the TA, so focused that he didn’t notice Sam watching him occasionally and laughing slightly. When the TA called for the break, Sam nudged Dean and gestured towards the door with his head. Dean wasn’t sure what Sam wanted, but he followed his brother from the room and down the hall anyway. Apparently Sam had needed to use the bathroom, so Dean waited outside for him, watching students rushing around to get to classes, or away from them to start the weekend, some students were sitting in little study nooks doing work by themselves or in small groups. It was fascinating to watch. When Sam emerged from the bathroom he raised his eyebrows at Dean.
Jack nodded. “Dada and me looked.”
Dean chuckled and stopped teasing, pushing his finger inside Castiel instead, smirking as Castiel gasped and threw his head as Dean crooked his finger at just the right spot. Castiel rolled off Dean as he laid down and spread his legs, inviting Dean back in. Dena moved so he was in a better position between Castiel’s legs, leaning down he captured Castiel’s lips in a bruising kiss as he gently pushed his finger back in. Castiel arched up against Dean and moaned, a deep and guttural sound that Dean could feel through his own body.
“Cas?” Dean questioned, gently nudging his arm. “Cas, it’s your tun.”
“Ohh, Sam’s in trouble!” Dean teased as they walked to the desk at the front of the room together.
“Cas?” Dean called out with concern, walking down the hall towards the bathroom.
“Cas” Dean cried out, “Cas, I don’t want to wait anymore. I’m ready. Please, I want you inside me.”
“Maybe a little bit of both.” Dean mumbled, lips now pressed against Castiel neck, also quirked up into a small smile.
Castiel sighed and turned to Dean, who hadn’t made a sound through the entire interaction. “Dean this is my twin brother Gabriel, Gabe this is my date Dean.”
Dean leant back in straight away claiming Castiel’s lips again, adding his tongue into the mix and moaning as he tasted the inside of Castiel’s mouth. It was a unique flavour, entirely Castiel, and Dean couldn’t get enough. Dean groaned in annoyance when Castiel pulled away, a groan on his lips that turned into a moan when Castiel suddenly latched onto Dean’s neck and started to kiss and suck on the sensitive skin there. Dean was so distracted by the feelings that Castiel was igniting inside of him that he didn’t notice that Castiel had been slowly pushing him backwards until he felt his bed hit him behind his knees.
Castiel blushed. “It’s stupid, but when I was a kid Jack and the Beanstalk was my favorite story.”
“Congratulations, you have a little boy.” She said as Castiel cuddled the baby tight against his chest, a small proud smile on his face.
“Maybe we should share a dessert, pretty sure I couldn’t finish one myself.” Dean suggested, hoping Castiel would agree.
“Jack, can you come down now?” Castiel called up to the tree from the patio where he was sitting.
“OHH FUCK CAS” Dean screamed, “Fuck, do that again, harder please” He begged. Castiel groaned loudly at that, he had never pictured big, strong, masculine Dean being the begging type.
Castiel didn’t say anything, just handed Dean a pregnancy test and the box it had come in so that Dean could see for himself. Dean removed one arm from around Castiel so that he could grab the items and looked at the box so he would understand what the result meant. Looking back at the test he saw that there were definitely two lines. It was positive. Castiel was pregnant. Dean was still in shock. This had not been a part of there plans.
"Take a deep breath." The nurse intimated, securing a mask on his face.
In no time, she waved at him and disappeared in the corridor, taking the empty wagon with her. Castiel went back to his bed with a light smile on his face. Yes, Meg was a good friend.
"Let’s say I have access to this information, and I mean maybe. Just giving it to you could cost me my job, Clarence. Why is it so important for you to find the name of a dead guy?" She snapped.
The hardest part was seeing his friends and family coming to see him every day with a darker face as nothing moved on the side of the organ center. Castiel was aware that he was not a priority among the thousands of people in need of a heart in the United States, but he tried to remain optimistic for the people he loved. His fight was rewarded a few days ago when he was told he had found a match donor.
"Never have I ever…" A kiss. "Loved as much…" Then another. " As with you…"
Okay, maybe he had a thing for Castiel. A little bit. Okay, good time! He wasn’t even sure it was mutual, so he certainly wasn’t going to waste 7 years of friendship on a simple… feeling? For God’s sake, he had spent whole evenings struggling with this very question, thinking about it again and again until he got migraines, and he had finally come to the conclusion that if he did not have absolute confirmation of the reciprocity of his feelings, then he wouldn’t try anything. It may have been giving up without a fight, but whatever he had was too valuable to make decisions lightly. It was not even certain that Castiel liked men! Well, yes, perhaps, his friend qualified himself as"pansexual". What Dean always said to him was that it was just "
"Hello Dean."
"Hi Clarence." Meg, a net of excitement in the voice, hastily replied. "Tell me you’re sitting, handsome, I’d hate to hear you fall on your ass because of what I’m about to tell you."
Dean watched him for a moment without saying anything before finally taking a discreet breath and closing his eyes. As soon as the living room disappeared around him, Castiel’s beautiful face faded behind his eyelids as he tried to ignore his crazy heart beating in his chest. The atmosphere had suddenly become special in their apartment, and this since Castiel had brought up the challenge. Dean’s instincts were yelling at him that this was the ultimate time to trust his friend, because something important was going to happen. He could not explain it more than that, he knew it, that’s all.
Anyway, after months of internal debate, Dean always found himself in the middle of that kitchen, with a best friend and roommate he loved a little more every day, but to which he had to continue pretending to maintain the ideal routine in which they had settled. Dean smiled tenderly at Castiel, who had now finished tidying up the kitchen and, realizing that he might have been staring at him for a little too long now, he sighed and went to the couch to choose their program.
Dean felt a piece of his soul warming up.
… lost in a video game on purpose to massage you." Dean suddenly said before he came to kiss Cas’s upper back.
Castiel had then smiled softly at each of his anecdotes and, when Dean had finally been allowed to feel this pulsating heart against his hand, Castiel had not moved. Dean was almost certain that he had let slip a strangled exclamation, but Castiel had just contented himself with that sweet and understanding look. At the end of their appointment, they had agreed to meet again. They both needed it.
Castiel felt his hands become sweaty as his gaze slid over the address and telephone number of Dean Winchester. A heavy silence filled his apartment, Castiel still unable to detach his gaze from this decisive email.
"And just by doing that, I’ve already told you too much." Meg said, raising an insolent eyebrow.
Castiel suddenly seemed nervous in front of him, which did not help Dean relax. He frowned slightly, uncertain, while Castiel laid all the cards on the table.
Castiel swallowed. He had no good answer to this question. Was he himself certain of what he was doing? Not at all. But he needed Dean to play tonight, because right now, he felt brave.
"Yeah, yeah, if you want. Five jokers each then, but don’t expect that to save you from not exposing those gorgeous leopard panties that I gave you for Thanksgiving last year." Dean replied with a mocking smile.
"Wait." Dean was surprised one day. "Seriously? You never listened to Led Zeppelin, even for fun?"
In a surge of combativeness and surely relief, Dean filled the space between their mouths again and slipped one of his hands to the back of Castiel’s neck to keep him close, preventing him from escaping this time. Once the surprise has passed for Castiel, Dean could almost see his whole body lighten up and melt into their shared kiss. This simple contact seemed to open so many doors that they were too blind to see before that Dean almost had his head spinning.
Dean passed a tired hand over his face as he walked past the windows of an umpteenth shop decorated with trees and garlands. Celebrating Christmas seemed absurd, totally meaningless in such a context. What’s the point if he can’t see Sammy’s jaded face in front of his usual porn magazine that he buys especially for him every year, for the joke? His world has been tasteless for far too long now.
Sam had noticed his little game a long time ago already, but never said anything. Despite his tough guy looks that Dean wanted to give himself for a reason that escaped him, Sam knew that his brother had a weakness, especially for the rare days when their daily life turned out to be calm and domestic. While he was ruthless with the monsters who gave them a hard time, Dean was also the most inclined to make hot chocolates in front of a wood fire while watching a nice movie. Sam called it his "
"I have another idea. For the last match, I’ll give you an extra joker." Castiel began, feeling a knot in his stomach as to the turn the events would soon take.
Dean laughs softly at the mention of that stupid bet that Castiel had royally lost while he was reinstalling himself on the couch with the card game in hand.
Outside, he heard Castiel moving a few pots and he smiled softly. He could always count on his friend to cook for them when he was too immersed in his own classes to care, and truly, Castiel was not such a bad cook as he claimed. Dean walked blindly to his door and opened it to a good smell of melted cheese. Growling with envy and a tenfold appetite, he approached the kitchen to find his roommate tidying up some kitchen utensils, the oven gently purring behind him. Dean leaned against the central island with a relaxed smile.
Castiel laughed softly, playing the game they both took pleasure in maintaining. Despite everything, it didn’t go any further than that: a game to brighten their days. Both knew how to settle for their already atypical friendship.
to thank the family of the one who had saved his life. It was something so important and, although he respected the choice of some to remain anonymous, he felt that he would not be able to leave this all behind until he had put a definitive end to this chapter of his life.
March hosted their first meeting in a private place. Dean had taken care to clean up the mess from top to bottom before Castiel rang his doorbell and, seeing the huge bouquet of flowers that his friend had brought him, an easy smile spread over his face.
Still smiling, Dean straightened up to grab the cup of hot chocolate he had left to cool down until then. He took the drink with a comfortable sigh and wrapped his fingers around the still warm ceramic. A marshmallow floated lazily in the center of the chocolate and Dean melted a little more in the mattress when the liquid touched his lips. He knew that in normal times and with anyone else at his side, he would disown hot chocolate for something stronger. Probably coffee, or whiskey. Or both at the same time. But now, he was too deeply immersed in his trance of total relaxation to care about it and this chocolate was the most delicious there was right now. He let the sweet taste come and tease his taste buds before swallowing it with delight, feeling the still burning liquid slipping down his throat.
"If I beat you again on this game…" He handed Dean a few cards, face down. "You will have the right to refuse to take your clothes off. But in that case, you will have to trust me and let me… challenge you?
, with a little soft smile. Dean retreated to his comfort nest, his hair pointing in all directions as he tightened his favorite blanket around his shoulders.
His feet—which had kept cooling on contact with the bunker tiles despite his wool slippers—were now pleasantly warm at the end of the bed, sending delightful waves of tingling in his legs. He felt like he was floating in a cloud of comfort and, for God’s sake, he would like to feel that way for the rest of his life. Dean barely wanted to get up to get food or go to the bathroom. If he had to die here, then so be it. He told himself that
"Hi Clarence. How’s my hottest patient today?" She exclaimed.
And without really understanding how, Dean nodded and lay down with Castiel. Docilely, he had let his companion draw him to himself until his ear rested against the scar of his chest. Some breathing later, Dean was able to discern the beats under the mutilated skin and the world stopped spinning. He remained there for hours, his eyes open but lost in nostalgia and stifling emotion.
"What?" He asked, stunned.
"Are you certain?" He finally asked, with a short breath.
"Okay." Castiel said after another moment of hesitation. "Well… Sam really is a hero to me, Dean, I wanted you to know that."
Turns out Castiel was either a damn good liar or he had a
An umpteenth sigh passed through the barrier of his lips when a rock-like music rose out of his pocket. Already worried that it was still his mother, Dean took out his cell phone. Unknown number. He raised an eyebrow and picked up.
in front of them. They remained in silence for many minutes, Dean finishing his cup of chocolate while Castiel played distractingly with the fingers of Dean’s unoccupied hand. When his cup was empty and he felt warmed from the inside, Dean rested his mug on his nightstand and stretched out like a cat again. He was pretty sure that Castiel paid as much attention as he did to their series—that is to say, very little—so he was not surprised when his companion straightened up to hug him on his side and bury his nose in his neck. Dean smiles as he feels Castiel’s warm breath in the hollow of his skin.
was alive and well, determined not to disappear. Not this time. When Dean began to cry silently, Castiel simply hugged him harder to comfort him, without a word. This was so precious to him. It quickly became their favorite position, Dean kissing the scar whenever he could.
"I know." Castiel replied, abashed while planting his fork in the mashed peas. "But perhaps they will make an exception? I just want to know them and thank them for the gesture of their loved one".
Castiel turned his head so quickly towards her that he was afraid to break his neck.
"Anyway, the thing is, you have to listen to Led Zepp, they’re the best in classic rock, believe me." Dean resumed as he turned down the alley to the bunker garage.
"I don’t pray to you all the time Cas." Dean huffed, trying to hide the redness of his cheeks with a certain frustration.
Jo took Dean's hand and pushed her way into the store, making her presence known to the guy behind the counter. It caught him off guard as he jumped back a little.
"Can I have a free sample?" asked Sam.
Did it bother Castiel that the moon was full? A little. Okay, maybe more like a lot. He cursed himself for watching that damned film and yet he was still happy that he did. Doing things like that wasn't really something he was used to. But being around Dean somehow made it a worthwhile experience. He would have to ask Dean what other films were showing but Castiel was sure Dean knew exactly what would be best to see. After all, it was an amazing movie, just scary. Too scary.
"I'd like that."
"What is it, Cas?"
There was that one time when he and a girl in his kindergarten class 'dated' but the most they had ever done was share their snacks. And the next thing you know, she broke up with him the second his snacks were all gone. Maybe Dean wasn't as popular as he thought he was.
"That doesn't sound right at all, maybe it was a prank by a friend?"
"Madame Missouri," Dean corrected himself, watching her as she traced her finger along the lines of his hand. "Well what does it say?"
"What's that matter? I usually can't get you to shut up, why are you quiet now?" asked Benny.
"Let me see," said Dean, walking up to Castiel and inspecting his finger. A rather large splinter had found its way deep into Castiel's ring finger. With a quick pull, Dean took out the splinter and threw it to the ground.
"A surprise? What is it?" Castiel asked and stepped a bit closer to Dean, his eyes narrowed.
The sun was already setting when they finally managed to make it to the old house they were soon to call home.
"We won't, you have nothing to worry about," muttered Castiel. It was true that with how busy their Father got with work and how their Mother would be busy with housework, Michael often ended up being in charge of his siblings. Though Castiel wasn't much of a handful, at least compared to the likes of Lucifer or Gabriel, he wasn't going to act up now that he finally made a friend.
It may have been dark but Castiel could've sworn Dean had a black eye. His right eye seemed less bright, more puffy, more swollen.
"What is it?" Dean asked her.
"Language, Lucifer. Father will beat you over the head if he hears you using the Lord's son's name like that," warned Castiel, raising a finger to his lips.
"I do not! Benny just got sick from lunch the day I asked him to be my boyfriend," pouted Jo.
"I'm sorry Dean but you're a bit too big for my clothes," whispered Castiel apologetically.
"Why are you friends with my brother?" Asked Michael back, finding a box and taking it down to look through.
The gentle rocking of the automobile against the old road would’ve been enough to put Castiel to sleep if it weren’t for Michael and Lucifer’s constant need to bicker. Surprisingly, Gabriel had been quiet the whole time yet Castiel had his suspicions that he was the mastermind behind most of his other brothers’ arguments. Maybe it would’ve been best if he just left when Naomi, Anna, and Raphael did with their mother. It definitely would have been a lot more relaxing.
Castiel slowly looked up and at his window. Through his curtains he could make out the faint silhouette of a figure. A slender one that somehow made it to his window and Castiel only had one thought. Wolfman.
"We wanna see what's inside this old hunk of junk," said Jo.
They stood there in front of the grave together, the reality of the whole situation still not setting in. The sun was bright, the sky was clear, and in the distance somewhere birds sang. None of this could be real. Could it? It seemed like some sick joke to have such a beautiful day when such sorrow hung over them. Out of all of the people in the world who had to go, why him? Castiel had done no one wrong. Whatever the reason was, Dean wished he could take his angel’s place.
It was perfect for his imaginative adventures. He could see himself being a knight like in one of his books with the shed being his castle. Yes, yes that could work. But what would he be fighting against?
"I won't," shouted Castiel who just rolled his eyes and went inside to eat dinner with his family. The house loud with gossip and laughter, the typical Novak sounds.
"Perfect! I hope you'll enjoy it, I've spent over a month working on this one and I feel really good about it," said Mr. Novak, his smile almost infectious.
They ate in a good mood in front of a horror film so lame that Dean was seized with a hysterical laugher in the middle and nearly choked on a macaroni. For dessert, Dean got up and came back with two ice creams — vanilla for him and a much more sophisticated taste for Castiel like wild mango or whatever — to finish their meal. Surprisingly, Dean was not particularly tired despite his long day of work and considering the energy that Castiel still had in front of the film, neither was his friend. When the credits began to scroll on the screen, Dean sighed.
"No." He lied.
"Could you have access to organ donor records? You told me the heart came from the next town."
"But it’s quite uneven." Castiel replied, pouting. "You already know the rules, I’ll be naked in less than ten minutes."
He himself was curled up and kept staring at his cards with a sullen expression, alcohol already making him spin his head to make matters worse.
Dean remained silent for a long time, trying to assimilate each of the words he had just heard. At the sound of Sam’s name, he thought he was dying a bit more. A kind of
"Shit." Dean replied, clicking his tongue. "But what do you do when you have free time?"
"What’s up, chief?" Dean asked, raising his voice in the hope of surprising Castiel.
"You don’t complain about it, though." Castiel remarked.
"Mmh?" Dean replied with a questioning look, his curiosity obviously bringing him a new interest.
Dean remained as calm as possible as he tried to listen to what was going on around him. In the first place, only Castiel’s quick breathing made itself heard while Dean remained straight in his place, gently squeezing his hands against each other to control the nerves that he felt rising in him. After a few seconds, he heard movement in front of him and felt the couch rise a little, as if his friend had just changed position. Suddenly, he felt this same rapid breath close to his face and frowned gently, confused. When he could endure it no longer, Dean opened his mouth slightly to ask the question that he was dying to ask before his lips were covered by warm, wet others. Sweet and yet trembling.
"That’s alright. Unless you want to give me a little
Castiel raised an arrogant eyebrow and this time it was his turn to break the contact.
Castiel rolled his eyes and began dealing the cards in silence, ignoring Dean’s bad loser attitude and his naked and shivering body before him for a moment. He briefly thought about an alternative before biting his inner cheek with apprehension considering to the direction in which his thoughts were going. Maybe these two sherry cups finally got to his brain... Castiel had never held his liquor very well. However, he was the first to be surprised — and mortified — by the forbidden words that came out of his mouth:
May marked the beginning of a mental breakdown for Dean. He was definitely falling in love with his now best friend and that terrified him. What if he was wrong? What if the fear of losing sight of the only thing that still connected him to his deceased brother led him to feel faked feelings for Castiel? He had no right to be wrong here, he could not make his friend suffer, for he was too stubborn and miserable to properly analyze his own feelings. His cowardice pushed him away from Castiel — "to avoid making him suffer," he said — and the deep despair that this created in each of them was almost as hard as a second mourning. Almost.
At once, Castiel felt the air blocked in his throat. These words, he had waited for them for months while everything gradually turned into a crazy and inaccessible hope. Suddenly, through a simple phone call, Meg had just remade his world.
Dean shrugged but nevertheless got closer, planting a wet kiss on Castiel’s nose. They were now so close to each other that they shared the same air.
This time Castiel tilted his head to the side before looking at the road, adopting a confused expression that was so familiar to him. He took the time to seek the answer in his mind to a question that should not have been so difficult, he knew it.
Despite his best efforts not to hurt his best friend, June began with a considerable argument. Castiel felt rightfully unfairly rejected, and Dean could not bring himself to pronounce the words that burned his throat. However, neither of them expressed themselves more when Castiel, after a final overwhelming exclamation, brutally kissed Dean’s lips. The latter greeted him with a sob before deepening their kiss. No, Dean did not only love that beating heart in his chest… He had fallen in love with so much more.
"I... of course."
"A card game?" Dean suggested, turning an angelic face to Castiel again. "Do you know how to play poker?"
Neither of them had spoken any more unless it was Dean humming his favorite music. Soon it became a ritual taking place at least once a week. Sometimes Dean would bring food supplies even though the angel didn’t need to eat, and other times it was up to Castiel to bring blankets to compensate for the broken heater in the car. When Dean decided that Castiel knew enough about Led Zeppelin classics, he made him a second tape on Metallica. It took Castiel a month to hold on to the essentials before Dean came into the car one night with another tape labeled "
", to which the other had to answer with a kiss if it were true. To date, no one has stated facts that do not require a positive response. Normally, the game was played in turn, but, engaged in the roll, Dean continued.
Following this, only the noise of the cutlery against the ceramics as well as the television journalist was heard in the hospital room. Meg didn’t move, didn’t open her mouth either, while each of them thought about their commitments in this story.
" without really expressing it… They had developed it at the turn of a drink-fueled evening that had undeniably ended with very few clothes, but their trick had remained and everything was a pretext to reuse it now. It was simple and stupid and simply stupid, everything they needed to know and say what they thought about each other. One said a perfectly obvious fact by beginning his sentence with "
"What?" He asked, stunned. He wasn’t sure if he heard correctly.
"It’s pretty simple once you understand the basics!" Dean assured, already bending over to open the drawer with his plan still in mind. "I can teach you if you want, it’ll save you from getting ripped off by Gabriel the next time we play."
Meg swore softly.
Dean shook his head and smiled. He knew that such a dynamic between them would never have been possible before, even in his wildest dreams. Dean had resigned to his unspoken feelings by persuading himself for years that he and Castiel were a relationship doomed to failure and suffering. That they were too different and that their lives would never allow them any semblance of normalcy or comfort. That he shouldn’t be distracted when he was trying to save the world or taking care of his little brother. That it just wouldn’t work, because it wasn’t reciprocal and he’d make a fool of himself, he’d lose his best friend, he’d still hurt someone he cared about.
The month of February began on another encounter at the park this time, at Des Moines. The winter was still rough and persistent this year, so they had decided to go and enjoy a hot chocolate near the pond. Dean hadn’t told his parents about it, not yet, but this meeting with Castiel did him as much good as the first. When he returned home, he found himself feeling much lighter than before.
Castiel had always loved music. Despite his many centuries on Earth observing Humanity, he had never taken the time to listen to anything in particular. He had attended celebrations in the Middle Ages and music festivals in more modern times. He had even heard a Reggae concert in the distance one day when he was harvesting honey in the countryside. But no, despite his fascination for this human invention, Castiel had never had his own music to listen to.
The operation was a success. He opened his eyes after said surgery. There was nothing more to say except that Castiel was grateful every day for the new beating heart in his chest. It was with this heart that he could now embrace his loved ones, laugh with his friends and discover a world he thought destined to disappear beyond the doors of this hospital.
The latter did not even jump, probably having heard him arrive without showing it. He put away the spatula he had in his hand before responding to Dean with a smile on his face.
She glared at him, and Castiel nodded, mouth open.
"Shuddup." She grumbled with a wink before her pager rang in the room.
"Does that mean you’re up for continuing the night a little longer? I’m starting late tomorrow too, and I admit that I’d like to enjoy the last few hours of the weekend without thinking about my damn essay." Dean pouted.
? He tightened his grip around his roommate’s body, he needed to hold on to something so he wouldn’t fall right away.
, you got me cowboy…" Dean pouted. "Okay… Joker. What should I do?"
"One more thing." She said." I’ll try everything, but if I don’t find anything, you have to promise me you won’t try to get a name anymore. Do we have a deal?"
The line remained silent and Dean frowned. He could hear a breath at the other end of the line, so he tried again.
knack for poker. Dean continued to bitch in his corner while he was already in his underwear and socks on the couch, his five empty sherry glasses on the coffee table while three on Castiel’s side were still full. Not to mention the fact that Castiel was still perfectly dressed and even sprawled out among the blankets in a casual attitude that only offended Dean more.
The ground seemed to collapse under his feet as Dean looked for a way out. The truth is, he didn’t know how to do it without breaking everything around him. His days passed one after the other in a sickly similarity: work, eat, reassure, start again. He no longer had his stupid little brother to listen to his stories, no one to share his Friday night evenings with and who would be there to support him in any situation. He had his friends left, but, honestly, no one could understand him like Sam did for 23 years.
"You’re sulking." Castiel unnecessarily remarked as he was knocking down other cards on their improvised playground.
"At 11:00, I’m closing." He said, grimacing. "But I won’t be spitting on some extra sleep, really."
Dean froze, air jammed in his lungs.
Meg shook her head again with a little compassionate pout.
"Well, the rules are simple. If you lose a turn in poker, you take off one piece of clothing and the last one naked wins." He grabbed another tumbler. "However... Since I am an extremely nice and magnanimous teacher, we will have three jokers each." Dean pointed to the liquor bottle. "Therefore, if you lose a match, you have the right to choose to drink a shot bottom up rather than take off clothes. We’ll have three jokers each for the whole night. Is that all right, Mr. Know-it-all?"
But he fell anyway when Castiel gently pushed him onto the sofa so that he lay down under him. Later that night he fell again into this large bed in Castiel's room, his lips unable to leave the body of the other as if he desired to make every inch of him feel loved. He fell and fell and fell all night long, tumbling down into the most exquisite and liberating of the falls as a smile split their two faces in the frenzy of the moment. Dean kept falling, but he didn’t do it alone, clinging to the one thing he had never hoped for in recent years and that he could finally touch with his fingers now.
Three months. Three long months since his little brother had disappeared in a car accident, leaving him and their parents in the grip of nameless sadness. He could barely breathe most of the time thinking of that youthful face he would never see again.
Castiel raised an almost cruel eyebrow.
"It’s an insult to call Sherry alcohol when you’re under 40, but… fine." Dean said while grabbing the said bottle before heading out in search of tumblers.
"Yes… But there are necessarily registers somewhere, a way to find a contact." Suddenly, something seemed to light up in his eyes and he turned his hopeful face towards Meg.
"Hello?" He said in a hoarse voice.
"Do we have any bottles left from Friday?" Dean asked as his eyes swept over the contents of the closet.
Seeing the wings of an angel was a true honor considering how intimate the gesture was for the angel concerned. Castiel literally laid bare before him, revealing his purest primal form and putting his life in his hands. The wings of an angel were so fragile, so sensitive and yet so powerful and majestic. Even among them, it was not common for this heavenly race to show their wings, let alone in a moment as intimate as the one Castiel and Dean were living. But the months had accumulated between them and from this love a solid trust was born. Dean would never thank his angel enough for offering him such proof of love, but he could nevertheless try to love him so much in return.
"Never have I ever loved the touch of your wings more than anything in this world…"
