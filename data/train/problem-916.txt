Time passed.
“John,” Lestrade assents. “Thank you for your time, you’ve been very useful,”
“It never existed. It was just bribery. Uncomplicated. Less. Beautiful.”
It’s a quiet Tuesday night in Baker Street. Not that any night is loud any longer. He is still here. Just him. Only one seat sits in the centre of the room now, facing the shadow where a second used to be. He moved it some time ago. That chair. It sits in what he now strongly remembers to refer to as “the downstairs” bedroom. Ownerless. As if it’s always been.
“Put the phone down.” The man says to John slowly.
“While I was dead,” Sherlock confirms, smirking a little, the side of his face twitching upward.
“And yet you’ve been back in the country for some time. Six months perhaps?”
“You knew.” John.
Sherlock pushed the note into his dressing gown pocket, advancing on the door in trepidation, as if it were a wild animal.
They sat in silence for some time, both of them contemplating the ticking of the clock.
“There’s nothing you can do now, Sherlock. You can do anything you like with me…” He spread his arms, inviting Sherlock forward, taunting him, “But nothing is going to prevent them from pulling the trigger. Your only three friends in the world will die.”
“It can’t have been him.” John tells him calmly, “Sherlock is dead.”
“Stop it.” John’s voice is quiet.
“What did this Mr Osborne look like Detective Sergeant?” He asked.
John takes a deep breath.
“No,”
It was only later, as he was leaving, that the subject of the flat upstairs was raised.
“I don’t know.” John answers.
“Since you asked nicely. I’ll speak to Molly.”
“You only call me for the weird ones,”
“What?”
“Your sister.” Sherlock again.
The expression is still the same however, nothing will change that, a kind of knowledge about the eyes, as if he’s forever deducing. John recognises it as the same one he’d worn the day they’d met, all those years ago in St Bart’s and then again, in this room, when he’d presented the surroundings to John with pride. It had even made an appearance in the seconds before their first kiss, right there, on that sofa. John knows it better than he knows the expression he sees every morning in the mirror.
There’s a long pause. One in which John gets the curious sensation of watching the scene from outside himself. Circling around them. Serving and volleying and questioning and explaining and separating and accusing. His head is singing with it.
“What do you think I’ve been doing?” He cried from under a heap of bubble wrap.
“You had?”
“Tried what?”
“Then there’s Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock brings him back to the room,
“You can’t scare results any faster than it’s already happening, they have a lot to process.”
“So ‘M’…?” Lestrade tried a different approach, looking down at the card now sitting on the desk in front of him, finally wrapped in a clear evidence bag. “Could be a company? A brand name? Looks like a business card…”
But something isn’t quite right with those eyes. Irises so pale they blur into the whites, pupils wide pits of desire. Too wide.
“Look,” John starts. Sherlock’s hand is cool under his, “I could be completely off the mark with this and please tell me if I am, but…”
“I don’t know the answer.”
“John,” She says on the exhale, “It’s good to see you.”
“What?”
“Christmas?”
“There were.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock turned. Behind him, scrawled in garish yellow spray paint, seven feet high, was a single letter: ‘M’.
“Where the hell do we go from here?” John asks.
“You’re a writer.”
“Any good?” Sherlock.
“You had to find the people he was working with.”
“They threatened Mrs Hudson?!” John’s had snapped up, anger flaring.
John smiled and ducked his head under her scrutiny.
“What?”
“What are you saying?”
“I may have been a little eager to offer my opinions,”
There were a few seconds of silence as Mike looked between Sherlock, practically a stranger, and John, motionless on the bed.
“I do.”
“Which is directly proportional to the destruction of our tableware?”
“Lestrade called.”
“Thursday.” Lestrade answered from somewhere in the back of the room, aware of Sherlock’s fondness of the dramatic,
“You checked my pulse.”
“Yes.” The stranger says in response, not obviously tipping his head to observe.
Silence.
“You got my note.”
“Which is it – Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock repeats.
“Sheila Lay, forty five, lived alone. Hanging,”
John turns to offer his apologies, catching sight of a pale face framed by black curls.
“If it’s so unimportant,” Lestrade pronounced the word in Sherlock’s tone. “Then why send it?”
“Oh.”
The kettle clicked off, bringing John back to the present. He prepared his tea slowly, carrying it with him to the living room and slowly sinking down into the armchair by the fireplace.
A few seconds pass and Sherlock appears around the doorway, pausing on the threshold and leaning himself against the frame. He’s left his coat in the kitchen, probably draped across the back of one of the chairs, and now wears just his dark suit and deep purple shirt.
“John, I…” His voice is low again,
“It wasn’t the drugs?” Sherlock asks, definitely hope.
Two mugs for tea on the countertop.
“It was Moran’s.” John says, his words sucking most of the air out of the room.
As expected, it was embossed with a single gold M.
“Short?” This time John hovering on the edge of being insulted.
Turning John realises the space beside him is empty.
“I’m fine,” John tries to reassure him, fails.
“Absolutely everything you said was true.” Lestrade said, levelly.
They pause.
“It depends on the context. Deduction is usually an exercise in ‘getting the hint’”
“Sounds a bit like exile.”
And John is reminded that this man can always surprise him.
“That describes a lot of women in London.”
“And this person isn’t available at the moment?”
However the moment he turned that last corner he spotted the words written on the wall opposite him. The message was large, covered at the edges with the faded remains of a thousand different pieces of graffiti, accumulated over the years, but the centre remained clear:
Sherlock gestures at the picture lying between them on Lestrade’s desk, printed from the phone.
“How are you feeling today?” John asked the patient as he arrived at his bedside, not giving him time to reply as he picked up his chart and starting leafing through it. It had been a long day.
Sherlock looked expectant in reply and Lestrade relented.
“Dr Hooper already found it.”
Then abruptly the tranquil effigy before him leaps to life; turning to snatch his shirt and coat from the puddles they have made on the floor before disappearing through the door they had so recently entered through. From his position still rumpled on a strange sofa, John can hear as Sherlock dashes back downstairs. The front door slamming behind him with an ominous clatter of finality.
His throat heavy.
“Moriarty, I presume,” Sherlock said icily.
For almost a minute they wait. Though John is uncertain what for.
“But it was important.”
“I’ve been in the mood for socialising lately.”
“The Christmas do,” Molly replied, catching up and giving him a playful bat on the arm. “Staff room, six o’clock, you brought your party frock?”
“You chose this moment to decide to do housework?”
John stood up from the edge of the decking, turning to face Sherlock,
“Where?” Sherlock asked.
“If you wish to be so pedestrian.” Sherlock snaps back.
“You do that,”
“Hospital.”
“It can be.”
From the doorway he’d appeared to be sleeping, but as John moves forward he can see that the patient’s eyes are open. They’re striking. So pale that they make the dark circles beneath them stand out like bruises.
At some point while the stranger has been casting a spell of words across the table he has leaned closer to John, covering the back of his hand with his own amid the stripes on the formica. His cool touch sears into John’s skin.
“Your therapist thinks so too.”
“I just assumed.” She said with a shrug and a smile, “You said you were a friend of Mike’s and so is he…”
“Yes.” It’s a testament to the lethargy in John’s body that he is unable to summon enough enthusiasm to question Sherlock’s train of thought.
John considers it for a moment. The patient still flailing wordlessly between all of them.
“An hour? You got something better to do?”
“Thank you,” Sherlock was too distracted to not remember his manners.
“It was meant politely.”
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock bellowed from amid the mess of a dozen half-emptied boxes as he tossed the contents about desperately, “Mrs Hudson!” He called again.
“Are you…?” The man starts but John cuts him off.
Sherlock dropped it inside with a roll of the eyes.
“Don’t be childish,”
“Was that Mary?” She asked.
Time continued to pass.
“Is there anyone there?” He asks, the wind snatching the words from his mouth as he says them.
“You’re an idiot.” John says as he pulls away.
Somewhere along the way Sherlock seemed to have gotten himself confused between John and his mysterious ‘M’, now seemingly identified as Moriarty. As if somehow solving the case would be Sherlock’s key to understanding the reason for their being able to write to each other.
John laughed, watching her retreating figure and allowing his hand to steal into the pocket of his white coat, the corner of the letter crinkling under his searching fingers.
“About how to kill my landlady.”
“I’m not sure you’re in a position to be making demands.”
“George?” She asked, he simply looked back at her, realisation dawned. “Oh yes, Greg will be there,”
But John doesn’t know how to go on, how to articulate the strange awkwardness in the room. It crosses his mind that perhaps this was how it always was, before, when he wasn’t talking to a version of Sherlock created by his own subconscious. Of course the real Sherlock would seem a little different, if only by the fact that his every word isn’t dictated by the deep recesses of John’s mind.
Minutes pass. A lifetime.
Lestrade nodded quickly once, swallowing, before ducking into the vehicle.
“You’re not at work?” Sherlock asked, knowing his brother’s shared dislike of anyone stating the obvious.
“The ex, of the previous victim… The one I told you to speak to…”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” John replies.
“You went home?” John asks in the face of it, awkward silence isn’t often a feature of theirs.
Her eyes were wide and full of delight, John laughed.
John watches him go for a long time, a tall figure in a long coat cutting a dramatic swathe through the throngs in the station. It’s not until that figure disappears from view that he realises he’s standing alone on a train platform, a heavy pack on his back and a far-away look on his face, watching a man he’d only just met on a train. And that his cane is still tucked ashamedly beside the seat he’d met him in.
For the first time that night John is lost for words.
“Is it going like you’d imagined?”
“John,” John says, “John Watson.”
“God, yes,” Was all John could say in return.
He will have fallen asleep and dreamt of that voice saying his name.
He hands over the cash.
"Oh.” A breathy sigh from behind him, Sherlock’s fingers retreat. “I preferred it this way.”
He laughed, nervously, aware of the high likelihood that he was blushing.
And stops.
“And Mrs Hudson is?”
“You think so?”
“You are,”
It's a 221b - just because I wanted to...
“Forgotten it? Or never knew it?”
“You didn’t…” Her eyes flash up to Sherlock across the room; he’s risen from his chair as she entered.
“It served a purpose,” Sherlock’s answer is typically, cuttingly articulate.
“The yarders cleared your name.” John remembers,
“If you are to believe the papers the police solve the crimes.”
He had decided to reply.
Inclining his head a little, Mike tapped his glass to his. “You old softie,”
“You’re awake,” It’s a deep voice in the doorway that breaks the silence. John looks up to watch Sherlock saunter in. Face calmer, a different shirt.
“Is there anyone else in the house?” He asked, eyes pulled upwards toward the ceiling.
“Jumped.”
“No,” She says slowly.
“You need to speak to the brother.” Sherlock turns back to Lestrade.
“It would explain better than I could…”
“Three,”
“Raise your hands!” An authoritative voice came down to them from the loudspeaker, Sherlock didn’t have to raise his eyes to know that the instruction wasn’t being levelled at him.
“I,” John stretches out his legs, looks down at his hands. “I guess that vodka was stronger than I thought.” He tries lightly instead and hears a quiet laugh from behind him, the gravel of a breathy giggle.
“Well,” He says, limping forward to his chair and settling back into it. “As you’re in there you can put the kettle on.”
“Would you have let me in?” Mycroft held his gaze and Sherlock was the first to look away, a gesture akin to surrendering the point.
“Frequently. People don’t know what they want. What is right.”
“What the hell Sherlock!?” And John’s shout: the most sickening noise of all.
SHERLOCK
John sits:
“What’s interesting about this one?” Sherlock asked, ignoring the inspector’s tone.
“There was nothing you could do.” Sherlock says eventually.
I was so alone.
John watches him listen for a second.
It was, of course, his book. The detective stories he’d left on a platform, so long ago now.
John is on his way home, cane in hand, cursing every other step as his bad leg jolts against the pathway.
A breath, three paces and a turn.
“Yes.”
“And the guys I guess.”
“You’ve never minded too much about family.” Sherlock responded; voice rough, reaching for the mug.
Sherlock is not here.
“Restraints?” The nurse suggests instead.
“But it’s been…”
John wasn’t quite the only one left in the restaurant, but the kitchen was obviously closing and the staff making a show of wiping surfaces and tidying up.
“Yes.”
“Yes?” Sherlock said into it,
Another pause, they both watch as the ticket inspector lumbers up the carriage, punching tickets and chatting as he goes, until finally, he disappears out of sight.
“About how to explain 2010: The year things got better.”
“Yes.”
“I mean it.”
“Whatever gave you that idea?”
“Still.” Sherlock tips his head to one side.
They meet at home.
“I’ll get a candle for the table.” He says, with a grin, Sherlock already forgotten. “It’s more romantic.”
“Stupid idea to have a barbecue in October,” The other said.
“Go to your funeral.” There’s a smirk in Sherlock’s voice.
“I…” John starts.
“You really have no idea?”
“Yes,” John agrees again,
“Do you know what he was injected with?”
“Excuse me,” A deep voice above him cuts into his thoughts and John looks up, lost for a moment in a smooth face and equally startling eyes. “Can you direct me to the morgue?” The man asks.
He wondered what kind of evening he’d be having if it was Sherlock he was watching across the room instead of Mary. But even as the thought occurred, he dismissed it. Sherlock wouldn’t be across the room greeting acquaintances, he’d be standing with John, watching, and probably offering well-timed observations designed specifically to make him smile.
A huff of a laugh: “I don’t need you to tell me I’m stupid.”
“Before you, I thought that being alone would protect me.” He said, dropping his voice to something more intimate, “I thought other people were unnecessary, that I was stronger without them. I was wrong.”
The room is quiet now, almost unrecognisable as the one he’d walked into earlier that day. The patient’s restraints have been removed and he lies huddled on his side on the bed, the absence of his dramatic coat making him appear pale and fragile in what John recognises with surprise as a rather expensive suit.
A beat before Sherlock replies, “What?”
“I doubt it.”
“So,” John starts, glad he’s managed to raise that smile. “How exactly did my idiot receptionist manage to throw you out? Tougher souls than her have tried and failed.”
“Of course not! Who would? I loved her.” He paused, looked up at Sherlock. “You know?”
“What did you think we were dealing with?” Sherlock again.
“I made him think that I had, but it was planned. Everyone was aware of it. There was a code.”
“No,” John says, the feeling of the surreal slowly descending.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we could afford it. We’ll meet there tomorrow: seven o’clock.” He turns toward the door. “Sorry, I’ve got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
“You’re alive Sherlock.” He says finally.
“They are down there. Not up here.”
“Has the kettle offended you?”
“They’re down there?” John asks, wondering faintly whether it is indeed a good idea to keep bringing this stranger’s attention back to the gulf before him, but, well, John would be surprised if he hadn’t already noticed it by now.
“Friends.” Sherlock supplies.
“Can you hear me?” Sherlock continues, too loud, the words are coming from somewhere else in the room.
He also knew that it was likely that there was a letter waiting for him but had told himself that it was incidental and not the main reason he’d gotten himself out of bed early on his only day off.
Lestrade sighs heavily. Studying John’s face as if weighing up a difficult decision.
John sighs, watching the man in front of him with newly remembered affection and using his lifted hand to touch that familiar face. The years have marked it: lines across his expressive forehead and around those clear blue eyes, his dark hair worn shorter now to mask the creep of his hairline, the black curls shot with grey.
“Tell them?” The space between Sherlock’s eyes creases.
“It’s fine,” He stepped forward and dropped his hands back onto her shoulders, “He wouldn’t risk making a move when you are so obviously protected.”
“I’m sorry, what?” John asks as he turns back, finding the man is looking at the computer rather than at him.
“I don’t know…” John trails off.
“Right,” Her gentle smile suggested she was quite pleased with that answer. “So is there anyone…?” She started to ask.
“And all of the husbands were of a certain…” Sherlock falters for the first time. “Appearance.” He finishes finally.
“No, I…” Again Sherlock starts, again John stops him.
John’s eyes snap open:
“Yes.”
“It would have been dangerous if you had known.”
“Not just that note. Every note. I’m a different person because I know you, John.” A careful smile, Sherlock looked as though he wanted to move forward, to touch him again.
“You’re the only person allowed to have that kind of power over me?” John asks calmly,
“He told me once he’d burn the heart out of me.”
A pause.
“I have someone that I…” He thought about it carefully, “Consult with, occasionally.”
Searching his mind.
“You do have a lot of things,” Mrs Hudson said looking around, her gaze moving up the wall, “Is that a…”
“Something you did?”
He was aware that he was gaping.
“It’s been good to catch up,” John said in acknowledgement.
John smiles a little, realising that of course Mrs Hudson would take his statement literally.
There’s another awkward moment.
Time ticks by. John sitting. Sherlock standing. Patient.
“Yes,” He finds himself saying however. Covering for his total lack of understanding with a polite lie, even if the tone he delivers it in is one of complete disbelief. He takes the offered hand. “Hello, hi,”
Sigh.
“Is it not mine any longer?”
“An unfortunate necessity,” Lestrade sighs, tone downtrodden for a moment, before they both turn back to face each other.
“They were under instructions to kill you, unless they saw me die.”
Retrieve milk from fridge. Pour. Stir again.
“Sometimes,” She replied as she stopped them in front of a door about halfway down the corridor, “But generally he’s under pretty heavy sedation. It helps with the healing process,”
“It’s obvious.”
“You’re a doctor?”
“What’s over?”
“I’m sorry?”
“Is there a story behind it?”
“And biscuits, just this once mind.”
“Yes.” There’s hope in Sherlock’s word.
“I didn’t mean about the ‘not being dead’ bit Sherlock. Though it might have been nice to know that before now.”
Since that evening alone in a strange restaurant he’d thrown himself back into his life in the present: a drink with Mike in the local, lunch with Molly, this cake with Mrs Hudson. There was even the suggestion that he and Mary “go for a drink sometime”. But he wasn’t sure what to make of that yet.
“I lost you.”
“You’re…” John starts again. Unable to form the words he wants to say. The external physical representations of an internally incapacitating emotion: “You’re not dead.”
“Likely they were stood together for a long time,” Sherlock explains,
“Consulting detective.” Sherlock corrects, “The only one in the world.”
The stranger raises one eyebrow.
Push it back.
“Yes.”
“They asked me to. I couldn’t.”
She turned to walk away with a smile.
They attempt the ascent slowly, myriad aches and pains in John’s body still causing him vague discomfort. His major outward hurts are healing: broken ribs knitting well, cuts gradually forming into scars, the leg taking a little longer; but showing signs of improvement. Inwardly he’s still tired however, vaguely out of sync with the rest of the world.
“I’m not certain yet.”
“Lots of bedrooms.” John continues,
“I’m not sure where he got to,” John said brightly once he was close enough.
As they walk away the alarms on metal detector behind him leap to life, three security guards moving forward to hinder the progress of a tall man in a long coat. One who seems determined not to be searched.
Lestrade answers: “We believe that there are a number of markers in your wife’s case that match those of the other disappearances,”
Casting about wildly in his mind.
Then he does something he hasn’t felt brave enough to do in a rather long time. He reaches out and covers Sherlock’s hand with his own.
“Oh,” The stranger addresses him with an air of curiosity, “Thank you”
The man jumped off a roof, disappeared into the night, seemingly faked the whole thing and then put John through hell. But he’s here. John is damned if that’s not the best thing that’s happened to him in a long time.
“Is that wrong?”
“And what does it say?”
“No.”
“He cleared my name!” Angelo.
“Text me the address,” Sherlock barked, before ringing off.
And now you’re married, I don’t think I ever will.
“It’s usually…”
The man hasn’t turned. John can only stand alone in the middle of a roof and talk to the man’s back, but at least that’s something.
“Do you have any idea what that did to me? I watched my best friend fall off a roof. A roof for Pete’s sake. No. No, not fall. Jump. Jump Sherlock. You. Jumped. Off a roof. In front of me. Your best friend…”
“I’m...” Sherlock starts again.
they have... We work best alone, you and I.” Moriarty paused expectantly, but received only a cool stare in response. “We have no use for them, but they… They
There’s a long silence before Sherlock responds.
“You heard that. At your grave. You thought I was talking to you.”
“I brought tea,” She replied, the two statements not really going together.
“I cleared up the plates.”
The sitting room was startlingly empty as he pushed open the door. John had to stand for a long time to get used to the feeling of absence in the room.
Why not?
“You think he’ll forgive me?”
“Anything at all, no matter how inconsequential your tiny brain might think it.”
He considered the morning’s exchange now as he moved around in his little kitchen, putting the kettle on for tea and sniffing experimentally at the milk. He smiled to himself at the tone of the letters, shaking his head in disbelief not at the fact that this person seemed to be writing from some time in the past, but that he could know enough from John’s short lines to ask about Afghanistan.
“You’re welcome,” She replied in a tone that showed she had no idea of the significance of the moment, “I’ll see you Monday,”
“I’ve told you I don’t do that,”
“What?” John asks, the tone of Sherlock’s words have an air of finality to them that has upped the rate of John’s heart suddenly.
“That was a joke,”
“Feels a bit like exile.”
“The one whose body we never found?” Sherlock clarified again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who’s brother?”
“Never.”
“Men possessing of a certain degree of conventionally defined desirability,”
“Oh, that’s a shame,” Mrs Hudson said, she was a terrible actor. “But it will give me a chance to get over and see Mrs S, she had her op a few days ago, I said I’d pop out and get her a few bits…”
“So,” Johns says when the silence reaches its peak. “I should probably ask if you’d come away from the edge?”
“He’s introducing himself.” Sherlock stopped, the vague hint of delight touching the corners of his mouth making him look manic, “He’s playing a game.”
“A machine?” Sherlock asks back.
“Perhaps one day he’ll settle down,” She continues, John can’t remember if he’s actually contributed a word. “Difficult when you’re always dashing about, but you never know. If he met the right person. Someone who’ll put up with his silliness. Someone to look out for him. A nice girl is what he needs, or maybe a nice man, I suppose.” Her eyes seem to drift over to John as if remembering he is there “You wouldn’t be…?”
“Don’t step on me,” It was unmistakably John’s voice in the darkness, calling out almost the moment Sherlock stepped out of the kitchen patio doors. It hadn’t taken Sherlock long to deduce John’s likely location; in contrast with the crowded party the night was quiet, the rain having passed some time before.
“I’m sorry?”
“I should get the doctor.” The nurse remembers herself. John doesn’t look up as she leaves.
“Yes, well, go sort these patients…”
“But, “John splutters “This must be the fifth time I’ve said all this.”
“Yes.”
“I knew him.” She said again, her good mood gone, her face pale against the blue of her scarf. “The man who jumped. The one you couldn’t save. I knew him.”
“Well, no”
“We don’t know a thing about each other.” John starts, throwing another glance to Mike as he does, “I don’t know your name. I don’t even know where we’re meeting.”
“And take care of yourself,”
“I’m not sure what it is I’m going up to do.” John says, turning to the window as the train begins to pull away and watching as the faces of those left behind blur into obscurity. “It’s not as if I’m in much of a position to help out, financially, as you took great pleasure in pointing out.”
“He’s a consulting policeman?”
“Change trains at Leeds, yes,”
“I thought,” John can’t quite believe his voice can be uttering these things. To a dead man. “I thought, you… I mean, I…”
“No.” Sherlock says “Your life was in danger.” He repeats.
Mycroft turned his eyes to the ceiling momentarily. “On my way out,” He replied, moving forward, “I wanted to bring you this.”
“Crippled?” John suggested bluntly, trying to shock.
“How you did it. How you left it. That was wrong.” A pause “I didn’t know.”
And the unfamiliar living room of a stranger’s house blinks back at John in the darkness as if confused.
“John!” Molly called from the corridor ahead of him, John looked up from the chart he was studying and smiled. “It feels like it’s been ages.” She said as she caught up with him.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asks from behind John’s lids.
SHERLOCK
“Which she obviously could.”
John found he was only able to stare back at them, astonished. Each was blue, neatly folded, his name carefully looped on the front of the topmost sheet. His stomach dropped suddenly through the floor.
“A simple deduction.” The man states, finishing what he is typing and handing back John’s phone.
“I guess…” Mike finally acquiesced.
“Yes,”
“But I…”
“I…” Sherlock starts, gaze flicking away in a manner that confirms everything.
“Absolutely,”
“If you want to sit you’ll have to use the sofa.”
A pause.
Sherlock’s gaze has shifted.
“The nurse?”
Memories of a dream.
“You did that to me. Knowing that.”
“I know.” She said levelly.
“Sussex.”
And John’s eyes fall to the mobile phone already set out beside a steaming coffee cup on the tray table in front of the stranger, even while he sits typing frantically on John’s own.
Sherlock’s voice seems to suck all the air from the room.
“You’ve been almost incompletely unresponsive since.” Sherlock continues.
“So you do agree?” Sherlock asks as he pulls away, uncharacteristic uncertainty flashing across his pale eyes.
“Was I likely to?” Sherlock asked.
John casts around the room. Looking much as it did the day before. Where are Sherlock’s things? He had arrived last night seemingly with just the clothes on his back. No bag. No evidence to say he was moving back in. Perhaps he has gone to fetch them.
“Thanks for that.”
“Told you you’d get a tan, didn’t I Johnny?” One of John’s companions said, Sherlock caught only the faintest sound of it over the din of the other party goers.
“Took you long enough.”
“You’re still insisting upon the idea that I am your best friend.” Sherlock states.
“If nothing else it’s interesting how you can believe that committing suicide is a valid way of solving a case.” John can’t help himself circling back to the topic at hand.
Covers. Floor. John pulls himself from the warmth of the sheets, finding a discarded pair of pyjama trousers and a t-shirt on the back of the chair beside the bed. He pulls them on as he wanders from the room. His bare feet descending the stairs.
He’s desperate and he’s gripping, stilling the words on Sherlock’s lips. Clutching at that coat and those cheekbones and this collar. Pulling Sherlock’s face close to his: a silent desperate portrayal of everything he feels and thinks and thought he knew and wished he didn’t and wonders if he must.
“Me too,” He offered in reply, watching as she unwound the many layers necessary for venturing outside in a London February. “It’s good to see you,”
“That reason would be sufficient in isolation.” Sherlock agrees, “The man is insufferable.”
“Yes.” He responds tentatively, searching his memories, trying to remember where from.
“Well spotted.”
“Of course I did, he said he didn’t remember.”
“God, I’m sorry,” But despite being covered unexpectedly in a caffeinated beverage, John feels he should be the one to apologise.
“John,” He stutters, “John Watson.”
“I should have realised what he was planning.” Sherlock.
“But you just said I should tell her something…?”
“Yes! Yes, God. What was I supposed to think?”
“You’ve seen my pack,”
“Do you have a name?” John asks.
“I like it,” She announced, bringing John back to the moment, “A lot warmer than the usual place I eat my lunch,”
“Believe it or not Sherlock, we are pretty good at our jobs,” Lestrade followed on behind, “We
“Um,”
“Yes.”
Standing silently now for long minutes, the room held its breath amid the mechanical beeps. He wanted to reach forward, wanted to raise that hand he held to his lips, but he didn’t dare.
“Been empty for months.” She confirmed.
“You and he go back a long time.” Sherlock tells her.
“What else do you know?”
“You need to calm down.” A voice, Sherlock’s voice. Not this Sherlock.
“He’s dead.”
“Is that…?” John starts, feeling somehow as if he’s heard it before; he has to shake his head to clear it, “I mean, I’ve never heard of it. Is that common?”
Before Mrs Hudson lets out a small whimper, leaning back against the doorframe behind her, her hand at her mouth as if to catch it.
“Would it help if I kissed you now?” Sherlock has to know the effect that pitch of voice has on him.
John finds himself throwing a disbelieving glance at Mike, before turning to address the back of the retreating figure.
“Well, what did she have to say?” Sherlock continued,
“Something you deleted?”
“Sherlock!” Angelo calls, and the man rises obediently, coming forward.
“A little, I have a blog.”
“I couldn’t handle it.”
Sherlock exhales sharply beside him in amusement.
“How I did it.”
“I didn’t let myself believe. Not really. I saw you. You fell.”
.” Sherlock volleys back.
“They work at Bart’s,” Sherlock prevaricated.
“No,”
“I’m sorry,” John’s date says finally, she seems to have suddenly remembered that John is in the room. “This is John,” She says to them both.
Does he?
“Three years.” Sherlock says, deadpan.
To John’s delight the dark stranger does the same, pressing forward as much as the throng will allow. They stalk each other. Finally coming close enough for John to appreciate the details of that smooth face curled down above him, dark damp curls clinging a little to the edges of his forehead, spectral eyes drawing him in. Their lips ghost so close they can taste each other’s breath.
And John laughs. His question answered.
“Are you behaving, Dad?” A female voice chimes brightly from behind John, rescuing him. He turns in time to see a woman breeze past him, three boys under the age of ten trailing at her heels.
Their eyes lock.
“And why would they want to do that?”
SHERLOCK
But, already, I’m falling into sentiment, I’m promised myself I wouldn't. You hate that.
“Then…?” John.
“Vanessa Stephens’ boyfriend?”
John whirls around, as if the doorway will hold the answers to the questions his mind refuses to stop asking. Sherlock had stood there. In that doorway. All coat and cheekbones and collar. A red scarf. John didn’t know Sherlock owned a red scarf.
Just standing there. In the doorway. All long coat and cheekbones and turned up collar. A blank expression. Unreadable. No. Patient. There was no chastising for stating the obvious.
“Yes. I may have let the place go a bit.”
The letters in one hand, the book in the other, John cast his eyes in another long sweep around the room. Remembering. Then he lowered himself slowly, to sit on the floorboards.
“Really?” The man replies, John can only watch, “I thought it was a big improvement. Mouth’s too small now.”
I haven’t told you that I love you.
“I was responsive before?”
“You haven’t heard my name?” The man asks.
“I thought you worked best alone?” She asked,
“I said you’re nervous. At first I thought it was the tour, but that’s not it. It’s your family. The people in your life. You don’t have many, but those you do, you value. They make you worry. You beat yourself up in coffee shops over arguments you may or may not have had, but you can’t change the past. The harm you have done to others or that I have done to you. You can’t fix it.” The longer the stranger talks the further away his words seem to be becoming. “And you shouldn’t try. You don’t want to. But I value you. More than you realise. I don’t mean to do you harm. I don’t want you to fix this, fix me. I just want you to come back.”
“Yes...” Sherlock cut him off, his gaze fixed on the wall above Lestrade head’s without really seeing it. His mind was elsewhere.
“They can stay outside,” She called after him as he neared the door, and Sherlock felt that smile tick the side of his mouth again.
“They want to read about you.”
They stare each other down. It’s Sherlock that shifts his gaze first.
“‘Piss off’”
“Should I believe that?” She asks John with a smile,
“What do you remember?”
“You don’t need to apologise.” Sherlock’s voice is softer now, but John still can’t bring himself to look at him.
Sherlock hummed a response, holding his gaze for as long as he could before John became uncomfortable and looked away.
They took their seats. Vanessa’s eyes were on Sherlock.
“You must have misheard me, the noise…”
“By your grave? Yes.”
“It’s been in danger before. Has been practically every minute since I’ve known you.”
Ignoring the shock on Molly’s face he turned and hurried away, transported briefly in his mind to that time two years ago, when he’d rushed this same distance. He was more sure on his feet now, no cane to slow him down, no crowd of people, no collective stare upwards.
“And you’ve been second guessing yourself since?”
“Shaky start,” Lestrade continued with a smile, “But that might be the nicest I’ve ever seen you be to someone new.”
“We’ve seen each other a few times.” Molly seemed to know what he was getting at without him having to complete his sentence,
“You’re still here.”
John meets his gaze momentarily.
Then he stopped.
“Good?”
“He’s a consultant!”
“Sherlock is dead.”
“What then?” He asks.
“Which you’re not willing to share?”
“Ok then.” He hands it back. “Say, you’re not…?”
John checked his watch: 7:05pm. He wasn’t concerned, Sherlock didn’t strike him as the kind of person who was usually on time. But then again, with two years to wait…
“You didn’t come up here at all.”
“You’ve never noticed before, “
“Don’t…” He cautions. Sherlock freezes in the headlights of John’s gaze, one step further into the room, “Just…” John continues, “…don’t.”
His hand moves out to the phone and, uncertain, he has to look down to press the right button to answer.
A pause,
“You asked me if we met on a train.” Sherlock cuts in.
Lestrade looked at his watch.
“Keep doing whatever it is you’re doing.”
“It was a necessity. A necessity is always right.”
“For the mug?”
“That’s better,” She said, coming over to him and lightly looping her arms around his neck, “I like it when you smile.”
“I don’t…”
“Having you believe that of me. That I was a fraud.”
He sighed.
“In a way.” Sherlock agrees “You called me a machine.”
“We got a confession. Eventually. What we didn’t get was any definitive answer on the card.”
“I’ll try.” Sherlock doesn’t sound convincing.
“Bart’s?” Sherlock had been losing interest in the conversation but suddenly perked up. “Do I know them? The colleague?”
“What?” Sherlock asks,
“Yes.” Sherlock replies without urgency. John gets the impression he doesn’t want to share him just yet.
He’s struggling to breathe.
“Oh!” John cottoned on, “You thought we were a couple? No, no, just friends.”
“Mine?”
“Yeah, medical corps.”
“It’s the truth.”
“Well,” Sherlock says, eyes shifting out of John’s gaze. “We were.”
“I can’t stop the police.”
“No.” He replied, too quickly.
While John has been distracted with clothing Sherlock has dropped his mouth to John’s neck. He’s teasing there. All tongue and teeth.  The nips make John growl slightly, giving up on undressing to press against him.
“No?”
“We should try and get some sleep.” John says.
“Are you lost?” She teased, “Or brooding?”
He clenched his fist, striding over to the counter in the staff room and jabbing on the kettle.
“Did you ask him who? When? Where?”
“D…!” John starts to yell, lurching forward a little.
“Is that how you do it?” John asks,
“Sherlock?” It had taken Lestrade a few seconds to realise that Sherlock was no longer walking beside him. He’d had to turn back to call out to him.
As he opened the door of the flat however, the noise in his mind palace was immediately silenced. He froze in the doorway.
“And tell that nice Detective I said hello!”
“If they had they would have taken my name from him.”
“Every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain,” Moriarty stared up into Sherlock’s unreactive face, “I’m a specialist, you see…” He paused, eyes widening in mock realisation, “Like you!”
They meet in a crowd.
John put down his pen.
“John,” Sherlock says again. He’s closer, John grabs at him.
Molly hit him gently on the arm,
“Afraid?”
“No,” John has decided to just go along with it now.
But somehow that previous evening, in the gloom of gathering dusk, it had all seemed a bit less beyond the realms of possibility. As if it could be true. It was that thought that had made him search out that letter from Harry, the one sent to him from that now years-old snowstorm. He’d read it a tent in Afghanistan, feeling more than thousands of miles away from the prospect of snow, unseasonal or otherwise.
“Your uniform says Captain, but the rank is a new one.”
John read the letter with a smile threatening at the corners of his mouth, he replied immediately.
A pause, punctuated with a crackling announcement for the next station. They have to wait until it’s finished to continue.
“Yes.” Sherlock says with a sigh. He tips his face forward slowly to John, resting their foreheads together, John has to drop his hand from his cheek, “I’m tired of people not understanding your worth.” He starts slowly, his breath against John’s face. “I’m tired of idiot receptionists. I’m tired of Doctor Osborne,”
A breath, three paces and a turn.
Mrs Hudson has not seen him.
“Would it have made it any easier if I’d said those things, out loud, before I died?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to say something, eyes darting across John’s face as if trying to read text written there.
There had been no awkward “your place or mine?” conversation as they had left the bar. Sherlock had simply sauntered out onto the pavement and flagged down a passing taxi with practised efficiency, throwing an address at the cabby through the divider without discussion.
A comforting silence falls.
“I didn’t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military.”
“And other people. Harry,” John stops, “God, I heard Harry. She was here?”
A distant rattle and warm surge of air denotes the imminent arrival of the next train. John lumbers forward with his cane. To the edge. Finds himself eyeing the track experimentally.
“Yes.”
Sherlock stood statue still in front of the writing desk in the hallway of 221, staring hard at the pigeonhole. It was empty.
“Both. It served double duty. We knew he would likely make a threat on their lives, and prepared them.”
“Really?”
Three separate men come forward to seize John and he offers no resistance as they grab at their different parts of him, the futility of putting up a fight against this abundance of force immediately obvious. His wrists are manhandled down behind his back and handcuffed firmly in place, instructions still being shouted at him as he’s pushed forward, toward the door.
Standing beside Lestrade was a petite woman with mousy brown hair. She wore a tentative smile and a white coat, it was only the latter that meant Sherlock extended her a grudging respect.
“The private detective.”
“You always mean to be callous, Mycroft,” Sherlock spits the word.
Two if you count John himself.
“Yes.”
“You fought hard for him,” She said plainly.
“You said that you’ve been tracking him since you left. You didn’t leave.”
“I suppose that isn’t the conclusion that everyone would draw.” Sherlock acquiesces.
It was at my lowest point, when the hues seemed to have completely bled from my life, that I met you. All it took was an alarming number in my bank account, a chance meeting with an old acquaintance and a closed off figure across a lab bench. You were so careful not to give anything away. I’m sure I had my heart pinned to my sleeve. Like a rank.
“Predictable.” There’s something like a smirk on Sherlock’s face.
“The brother.”
He was standing alone on a corner of a Soho street, the guide that had walked with him thus far having abruptly turned and left as if with the dramatic swing of a coat. Deflated, John turned a final time, back toward the tube station that would take him home.
“Are you there?” The man asks, rather confusingly. He’s righting himself in the chair now, sitting forward slowly. John eyes the space between bed and chair warily,
“Yes.”
“And they are?” John asks Lestrade this time, feeling faintly like a spectator at a tennis match.
“How is what relevant?” Lestrade.
“Warned you?” Sherlock asked, a little hurt.
“Of course, that’s what has been so off about these last two cases. It wasn’t that they were boring, it was that they were too boring! These people couldn’t have pulled off these murders! Not in a way that meant they flummoxed the professionals at Scotland Yard…”
“Your immediate assumption that my nervousness could only involve the people that raised me.”
“A code?”
“And you weren’t part of that brand?” Sherlock jumped back in.
“You know that?” Sherlock asks.
But he didn’t tell Molly any of that. Instead he said simply: “Hi,”
His name is unspoken on John’s lips as he dashes across the landing and onto the staircase. Looking down.
“That’s not what I’m doing at all…”
“You passed me the sugar.” The man says after a pause.
A letter was waiting.
“You did.” He replies smoothly.
The banter falters. Sherlock’s words having surprised even him.
They meet in the road.
“You seem to know something about this?” Sherlock asks,
Sherlock is visibly unsure whether to defend himself or join John in amusement. John rescues him:
“You did everything you could.” She continued. Her calm gaze was steady on his face and John couldn’t handle the pity he read there. He shifted his eyes away.
John went very still.
I haven’t told you that I came back to life for you. From the greyness, the time before. You made me do that. I should thank you.
They meet in a hospital.
Sherlock took a careful swallow before replying, to both that were listening:
“Yes.” Sherlock’s no-nonsense answer doesn’t help matters,
“Afghanistan.” John responds automatically, “Sorry, how did you…?” He continues,
“Did you always talk like that?” John asks suddenly.
“It didn’t need to, you idiot.” John laughs and bridges the gap between them again. The practised meeting of lips. After all this time Sherlock still tastes like something beautiful.
“That’s it, isn’t it?” John continues tentatively, “You’re waiting for something…”
“We’ll see,”
“What did you want anyway?” John asks,
“We need a unit to the flat of Dr Molly Hooper, address…” Lestrade rattled off the information, but Sherlock wasn’t listening. Instead he was barking his own instructions to the nearest officers:
Abruptly John wants to see more. Touch more. Running his fingers downward he pops the button on Sherlock’s trousers.
“Don’t be petty.”
Mortified John can barely look at him as he takes the offered place, only looking up to offer thanks in time to watch the train doors close on the stranger’s retreating back.
“You promise?”
“You died Sherlock!” John’s voice is too loud. Again. “You died! You fell and you died. I should know. I was there!”
“You knew him?” Mary asked, when John had been quiet too long after she’d said his name.
“Yes?” Mrs Hudson looks up at him again, arms full of bags now.
“What for?”
with him? John thought, like acquaintances or colleagues? Is that all they were doing?
John can’t help grinning like a big kid as he wanders aimlessly amongst it all, watching the punters at the stalls, the kids eating doughnuts, a couple strolling toward him: a pretty brunette and her boyfriend, holding hands.
John shoulders his bag. “Good luck with the rest of your journey.” He continues,
“There is?”
Finally, the door was opened.
“Oh.”
“No, I mean, I wasn’t, fishing or anything…”
Did he really think it would be that easy?
A murmur of laughter followed by words exchanged too low for Sherlock to hear. Much back slapping and brief, manly hugging ensued before John jumped up into the train and his three companions turned to walk away.
“You’re waiting for him?”
“I realise you may be attached Sir…” John starts,
“You’ve asked him about the card?”
“If you must know,” Lestrade gave in with a sigh, “I have a date,”
“I guess not,”
“Thank you,” The word pained Sherlock a little, he turned to walk away again.
“That…” He finally stutters out “That… was amazing.”
He was running the words of his letter over and over in his mind, already memorised, repeating them to himself like a mantra.
“Detective.” Sherlock corrected, “No cases,”
“You knew he kicked me?” John asks, surprised that a blind man seems to have seen so much.
Sherlock took it. “Yes, it’s good to meet you too.”
“It’s an age-old story:” Lestrade continued, sliding a copy of a written statement across the desk, “TV personality, dropped by her publicist, losing her public image, in a bad place with the secret boyfriend. Just add a few paps with some rather unflattering pictures, a spot of blackmail and…”
“If that’s what it takes.”
“Useless,” He muttered.
This detail in particular seemed designed to drive Sherlock to distraction: John in his flat, touching his things, sitting on his chair, sleeping in his bed. Sherlock swallowed, staring at the details on the walls without really seeing them.
“You’ll have to tell me who to thank for that.”
“I didn’t.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak again,
SHERLOCK
Sticking to the edges of the room, he surveyed the small sea of faces around him carefully, moving through them without interacting.
And John forgets. He forgets what he knows, and holds on.
“Yeah,”
“Yes.”
He’s seen the cane.
Sherlock swivelled back, eyeing the man accusingly.
The train doors closed.
“Any word on her next of kin?”
“Yes?” John asked the intruder with a small ‘What can you do?’ look at the consultant, “Is everything ok?” He followed up quickly, hoping the answer was no, even if that meant potential loss of life.
“Are you ok?” It’s John that asks the question.
“Me?” John asks,
He does as he’s told.
“Friends, acquaintances. Mrs Hudson. Lestrade.”
“The occasion being?”
The uncomfortable exchange of glances as four people take up positions in a tiny room, standing mutely to watch the doors as they begin to close behind them. John notices the pretty woman standing to his left and she catches him looking, flashing her bright green eyes.
“I underestimated.”
“Yes, although it’s not him you’re currently leaving London to visit.” The strangers continues, as if what he is saying is as easy as informing John of the quickest way to the nearest post office, “You wouldn’t go to him because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.”
“Well…”
“Yes.” John.
“I’m not good at… sentiment.”
“I did?”
John realises what she’s saying and hurriedly fishes out his wallet.
“It wasn’t?”
“Who’s Mrs Hudson?” John asks instead
“What?” Sherlock asked, “Oh. No. That’s not what I meant. I meant stay for the party. Not for the…” He waved his hands, “The changing.”
A man strides in behind him.
A pause. They’ve fallen back into their easy banter.
“But not the effect on the crockery.”
“Mrs Hudson,” John thinks for a moment, “Lestrade. Me.”
“John!” Mrs Hudson’s voice from the stairs. They stare at each other in surprise.
“No,” John says tentatively, the concept of time still difficult.
“You hadn’t, you thought I was a model.” Sherlock is definitely repressing a smirk.
SHERLOCK
“Sherlock Holmes.” Says the stranger, reaching out to take it.
“What the hell is this?” Sherlock demanded, less than an hour later when he marched through the doors of Lestrade’s office. He threw the newspaper down on the desk between them as Lestrade raised his eyes, half in surprise, half in exasperation.
John walked the length of the hallway and let himself out into the street, the jolly Christmas lights strung beneath the lampposts casting red pools on the pavement as he walked.
“Tell me, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“I didn’t know you so well then...” Molly’s eyes had filled with tears, she looked away to hide them. “He and I were friends.” She sniffed, “At least, I think he would have called me a friend… Can’t believe it’s been two years.”
“It’s a calling card,” Sherlock interrupted.
Sherlock climbed into his, the officers confirming instructions before he was rushed in the opposite direction.
“Not a lot you can do about that.”
A stilted pause.
This time John doesn’t pause, mug in hand. Doesn’t glance around at the room, aware of the state of it. This time he’s on his feet and racing to the doorway. Panic rushing him. The stirrings of his insane imagination.
“And all the other times? Expanding the dataset?”
“Oh,” John questions his mind again.
“When you’re talking to a bizarre genius?” John finishes.
“Aren’t they just?”
“That was a different case.” Sherlock.
“To get my attention?”
“I believed that you died. I believed what you wanted me to believe.”
“Keeping a low profile.”
“Not this time.” Sherlock had stopped still and was standing in the centre of the room, watching him. Each time Sherlock looked at him at was as if he was looking for the first time, drinking in the sight.
“I have no idea,” John says in the end.
But that’s hopeless. He tells himself. They would have undone any mark Sherlock had made on it later in the evening. When they had fallen there: an amorous heap of desperate touches. Sherlock’s hands on him, his mouth, his tongue. What had he touched? He had touched John.
“Gone to lick his wounds I suspect.”
John woke with a start, his heart racing as the hard line of his nightmare pulled taught across his chest.
“Of course it isn’t.”
“Control is a loose term,” John said, handing off the chart in his hands to a waiting blonde nurse with a smile, before picking up the next. Three.
“Do you recognise anyone she is with?” Sherlock asks instead.
“Yeah, Mr Osborne, he wasn’t at home. Not given us the details of…”
Sherlock finally looked up to see her holding his mobile out to him from the threshold. He dashed forward to snatch it from her.
“This isn’t surgery.”
“I’ve seen it before…” Sherlock retaliated, throwing his hands around.
“John,” He says slowly, voice a growl of baritone.
“Nothing in the papers.”
“Yes?” He snapped in response. He was tired and grouchy. The hot London days made his shoulder throb.
“I’m not sure where to start.”
“Am not,”
“The same way I know your name.”
“She can’t cover every death in the city,”
“What the hell?!” John’s voice is a little too loud as he moves forward into the room, arms reaching out to the patient’s shoulders in an attempt to press him back against the bed.
“You have?” She asked, eyes wide with delight.
“You solved the case?” John asked, deflecting slightly, thinking perhaps that was it.
“Yes.” Sherlock pauses “I had to… go away.”
“She was…?” Lestrade started to ask, but tailed off when he realised he was unsure about how to go on.
“Sherlock Holmes!” Angelo all but cries, “He’s sitting just over there.” He motions to a man sitting alone at a table, his pale skin and dark curls highlighted by the glow of Northumberland Street outside the window.
“Of course it’s the truth. I saw it happen.”
“You need to come back,” Sherlock again.
“Well, good for Dr Osborne I guess.” John has a new respect for the man. “I didn’t know he had it in him.”
“Dr Watson!” The voice called again,
“Yes.”
The doors close. They wait.
“That’s what people DO!” He screeched the word, coming closer. He was almost a full head shorter than Sherlock but that served to make him no less intimidating.
He smiled back at her, unsure.
“Tell me why they won’t come up here.” John says firmly.
“But my wife can’t have been kidnaped.” Johns says, incredulous “I mean, it’s such a strong word.”
There’s a long silence as the man contemplates him, he seems to have interpreted it as a challenge.
“I didn’t know anything about it,” He said curtly,
“Though one disadvantage is that I’m no longer sure whether we can refer to it as a bedroom, whether mine, downstairs or otherwise.”
“I hate hospitals.” Sherlock.
“Well, if you really wanted to do it you would, whether I was here or not.” John says, almost thoughtlessly.
“Who is?”
“Yes.”
John still doesn’t know what to do. What to feel. Anger? Joy? Confusion? Perhaps a dumb stare will suffice. Dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word.
John drifts away.
“You know her?”
“Yes and like I said the brother claimed no knowledge. Didn’t say I believed him.”
“That was…” John starts.
And there was a sickening thud as the figure hit the pavement just ahead of him.
A pause.
A long pause. Again John doesn’t know what to feel. Except his own disbelief. He heaves in a breath. Forcing a sloped smile.
“You were talking to your insane imagination?”
“Yes.” Sherlock part answers, part confirms, “I’ve been thinking about it for a long time.”
Would he ever…? Could he ever…?
“Because it’s a mess,” Sherlock is just a disconnected voice.
You brought me back to life. Reinvented me.  Took me out of my head and made me the heart.
They stood like that for a few moments, Sherlock dimly aware of the radio chatter in the hallway outside, the arrival of officers, their routine combing of the street.
John dropped his gaze to look at the letter again, overcome. He could pretend not to know what Sherlock was referring to, but there was no use, he’d not long ago written the words with his own hand, despite the fact that the ink was faded with years of age.
“Mycroft knew.” John slots a few pieces together in his mind.
“So far, no word on the time of death.” Lestrade said down the phone. It was 24 hours later, the crime scene had been processed and Sherlock had been summarily dismissed while the body was transported for medical examination.
“And I’d hear you, sometimes,” John says in reply to it, “You’d be asking me to come back, to open my eyes. Sometimes it was the you in my dream, sometimes I think it was the real you, breaking through.”
Remarkably he finds a seat in a relatively quiet part of the train, by the window, pleased when the space beside him remains empty despite the hordes of travellers boarding. As they stutter out of the station he even prepares to spread out and take full advantage of his apparent good luck at traveling without a stranger pressed close against his side. However it is at this moment that a dark figure swoops in and takes the empty place.
John watches Sherlock’s face as he says this, that familiar set of features, something held back behind the eyes.
“We let her go,” Lestrade had an uncanny ability to grow calmer the more irate Sherlock became. Perhaps that was the secret of their working so well together. “She wasn’t charged with anything. It was never a case.” He shrugged.
“Who Sir?” She asks.
Sherlock growled in frustration, rolling his eyes.
It had been cold when he set out that morning, the world holding its breath for the possibility of snow. It was that dark time of year in the come down after Christmas, when the world realises that winter isn’t all twinkling lights and jollity, but biting cold, grey skies and long nights.
“You think I’m attractive?” There’s something about this that John finds astounding,
“Where it all started?” She said with a sigh, the lightness in her voice showing she was doing her best to lift his mood.
“You’re not…”
“And the others were some kind of a joke?” John’s voice is louder than he expected.
But this wasn’t the only place they had laid.
“Yes,”
“Yes, she may be one of many.”
“Before?”
“You’re not stupid generally.”
“You do that on purpose,”
Sherlock has been knocked off balance, sprawling on his backside on Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor. His long fingers automatically reaching to the juncture of impact.
“Yes,”
“I was being polite.”
“John?” He asks slowly as pale eyes slide open, catching John’s in a disbelieving stare.
It had been a grind of a day.
“That I should die.” Sherlock’s pacing seems to have stepped up a beat.
“Short, shouty,” She replied quickly, casting around for another descriptor, “He was wearing pink trousers, if that tells you anything about him…”
“You’re a regular somewhere else?” John asks.
“Yes.” John sighs “You should clear them up.” He barely registers what he’s saying, too lost in the glow. The feel of a lithe body still stretched out beneath him: the touch and the smell and the taste.
“You didn’t
SHERLOCK
She was an evil genius, Sherlock decided, she knew just how to manipulate him.
“John,”
“You care too much.” Sherlock repeats.
It’s a sound from a dream. The kind of dream that John wouldn’t admit to having.
So now the thanks! Thanks to all those that have read and reviewed so far and been so patient with me as I’ve updated. I think I’ve probably annoyed and confused you all in parts; alternatively you’ve been sitting patiently waiting for me to get to the point already.
It was thirty minutes later; all the details had been taken down and an officer called to read Mr Osborne his rights. They’d taken their leave as the officer entered, moving into the corridor.
“Hm, not interested.”
“Anderson won’t work with me,” Sherlock’s tone is matter-of-fact as he turns away.
“Thanks,” He followed her to the ‘bar’, which, in reality, was just the same old kitchen countertop where they’d usually brew tea, now overflowing with various different containers of alcoholic beverages.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s quick to agree, he must really be uncomfortable.
The only welcome his new building afforded him at the end of the day was the impersonal reception desk and the short walk down the corridor to his deep red front door.
John has turned and retreated back into the flat before he is fully aware that he has moved. His head crowded with thoughts he doesn’t particularly know how to begin to address.
“And you haven’t reported her missing?” Sherlock asked.
“I must say, you’re looking very well John,” Mrs Hudson said sitting back in her chair to look at him properly.
“Yes,”
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock says.
The silence stretches on.
“And I was there?” Sherlock asks
“Nothing.” Sherlock lost his nerve, “Your friends are here…?”
“And since when have you been so interested in the rules?” John accuses.
Reaching down to kiss him.
“There’s beer in the fridge,” Sherlock says, possibly in response to John’s previous question.
“Nothing. Nothing for a friend of Sherlock’s,”
“You aren’t a subject.” John replies.
“You told me to.” Sherlock’s face was barely a hairs-breadth from John’s, so close he could feel the words against his lips.
The stranger freezes mid-movement.
“I’ve forgotten it.” John admits.
“Are you here?” John calls, pushing the door of 221B closed behind him with his foot, juggling his keys in one hand and stack of paperwork in the other.
“Oh my, you did. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Sherlock so wound up, and that’s saying something,”
Mrs Hudson.
“…she’s with a client at the moment,” The receptionist was telling Lestrade as Sherlock tuned back in.
“Were you trying to protect me?”
And then Sherlock blinks.
His phone.
“You haven’t seen or heard from Ms Stephens since Sunday evening?” Sherlock asked the man sitting across from him.
“We know this.” Sherlock’s voice is calm.
They both looked down at it, still in John’s hand.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Sherlock replied.
“John Watson,” John offers his hand,
John harrumphs a little at this.
“And who the hell are you to tell me that?”
Away from his familiar surroundings Sherlock threw himself obsessively into the case. Scattering the details seemingly randomly across the four walls of his bedroom and linking them with pins and thread in a manner designed to find order in the chaos.
It was on his friend Mike Stamford’s suggestion that John came to be here, in this draughty flat, living amongst the assorted possessions of a stranger and struggling with more stairs than his current capabilities really allowed.  It had been something to do with an acquaintance who needed someone to look after his place while he was away, though the details had been vague.
“Yes,” She nodded. “He said you would.”
“It has?”
“So what is it exactly that you do?” John asks, almost accusatory, turning his full attention back to the man and discarding his phone on the table. “Other than stalk people from coffee shops?”
“Bingo,” Moriarty confirmed in a stage whisper, using the purse of his lips to take a sip from his drink. His eyes were wide.
“As long as I need to be.”
Moriarty tipped his head to one side. “Did I get your attention?”
“I cleared it a bit,” Sherlock qualifies to her.
“I have to go.” John repeated, unable to articulate himself any further than those four words.
“Ignore it.” The man orders.
“Yes.”
He’d paced the hallway of 221 for over half an hour after his final reply, but his note had stayed firmly in place in the pigeonhole. Nervous of Mrs Hudson’s return he’d had to leave, but not before he’d thought to slip his old key from the hook beside the door.
“Great,” She turned to walk away, “And John?”
“Well,” John starts eventually, “You seem to know,” He pauses, “Everything, about me. And I don’t know a thing about you.”
“Now we’re resorting to insults?” Lestrade asked.
“What profile?” John breaks in.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock speaks again.
“We kinda lost touch. After,” Mike said, perilously close to breaking the rule again.
“The army.” John starts.
“I’m not at liberty to say, Mr Osborne,” Lestrade replied cordially.
“There’s no signal on mine,” The stranger offers, without prompt or looking up.
“I am.” The man’s response is cool; familiar and alien at the same time.
“Like jumping off a building?”
There’s an awkward pause.
“Then put it back,”
“You think?” Lestrade asks and Sherlock turns his attention back to him.
“We still eat lunch together!” John protested.
“I said fine.”
“I used to.”
The stranger lowers his gaze from John’s for a moment before twitching the side of his mouth in a half smirk. He raises his eyes again as he speaks:
“Anything from the trolley for you Sir?” She asks brightly above them and for a second John is unsure who to answer first.
“Yes,” The patient’s stare flicks away from him.
Sherlock.
“No,” John laughed. He wasn’t wearing a frock. Just the normal jeans and jumper he’d worn into work that morning.
John couldn’t go back to work straight away. He knew it didn’t matter that there were things to attend to, or that he had rounds, or even patients. He knew he wouldn’t be able to do his job with those letters tucked in the pocket of his coat.
“Like last time you mean?.” John accused, “Just try and keep it clean,” He glared and they laughed, “Beers when I’m back?” He asked, turning to retrieve his pack from the bench behind him.
“Is it ‘
“Almost as insufferable as the woman he’s sleeping with.”
“Twenty-two?” He asked, incredulous.
“No, I didn’t think you would.”
“That I don’t wish to be noticed? No.”
John’s eyes flicked over to the writing desk, sitting innocuously beside them.
“Ridiculous?” Louder, ““I’m being ridiculous?!”
“I don’t know,” John starts, having difficulty finding the words he wants to say, “You seem…” John’s words peter out vaguely.
But the stranger hasn’t jumped.
He blinked at her. Forcing himself to ignore the urge to make a joke, to back away.
Blurred silence falls.
A pale face looks out at him from the back window: angular cheekbones and ghostly eyes narrowed at his view of the world.
“I’ve not heard that from you very often,”
“Yes,” He swallowed, “And I find myself without an assistant.”
“We have a name.” Lestrade replied, then paused.
Molly stopped talking, her smile faltering, “Yes.” She said carefully.
“Lestrade, and the yarders. Turns out that cracks appear in a story pretty quickly if the person telling it disappears rather spectacularly overnight.”
She was already up and bustling about the room, collecting the tea things and organising the few items out of place. In the time it took John to rise from his seat she had tidied all trace of his visit away and was standing in her coat. Reaching for his cane, he limped beside her to the doorway, his leg stiff after sitting so long.
“I…” Sherlock starts, but stops.
“Dr Osborne does.”
“No.”
“You’re looking into it?” He asked.
“Oh?”
“Well, it’s been hard.” John continues. “Everything has.”
John feels his face move into something that could be really only be described as a grin:
“From around the hospital?” He ventured.
“I did.” Sherlock.
John folded the reply, standing from the now familiar step in the hallway of 221 Baker Street to take his leave. He’d been sitting there so long his leg was stiff; a strange echo of an injury he’d never quite had.
Well!
“Well, yeah, kinda, she’s taking me to a party,”
“You always seem to know just when I’ve taken a cake out of the oven,” She joked as she ushered him inside.
Minutes pass. They watch one another, seven feet of space between them. Books and papers and notes between them, broken crockery and Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor between them. Memories between them. Years. Lost years. Death.
“You can’t possibly know everything.”
“You didn’t get the lift?” Sherlock asks.
“And was she visiting an older man?” John asks in follow up.
“Would you like me to leave?” He asks with an air of finality.
“I guess I’m just a variable you can’t calculate.”
“If I’d thought the work wasn’t keeping you here I probably would have suggested it myself.”
