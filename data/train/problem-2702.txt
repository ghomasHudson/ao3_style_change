If he was lucky, Sam would actually try to reach out to Cas. Even if he did, he seriously doubted it would make a difference. Dean played every scenario in his mind of what he could do if he caught up with Cas, but deep down he knew that there would be no way out. He’d probably grab the guy and wrap him in his arms, refusing to let him go. After all, that was how his arms itched just about any time Cas walked in the room. and that was also the best-case scenario. He was more than a little concerned about the small bottle of lube in his duffle and what it meant. Grabbing the bottle of water purchased at the gas station, he took a long sip and tried to change the path those thoughts inevitably led him down.
He justified the whole thing, running circles in his mind until he hit the outskirts of Pine Bluffs. The good news was that the town was small. Hopefully, that meant any case would be quick to solve and Cas would be long gone.
“Hey Chief, we’re here.” Benny knocked, and after only a brief moment the door opened to a giant of a man with shaggy brown hair and a serious expression. He looked Castiel up and down as though sizing him up and nodded at Benny.
“I started following your career after I had to research and write a paper on police reform, you’ve been making waves for a while. If we hadn’t met in the manner that we did, I was eventually going to reach out to your team directly to see if I could help. Well, until you become a client. I never mix my worlds.”
“Hey, Cas? I really am sorry. For asking you to leave that time, for…uh, all the times I was a dick to you. I’m just really sorry.”
The bed creaked under his weight as he sat on the edge. Tossing the bag on the floor by his feet, he ran both hands through his short sandy hair and left them there. Head down, raked by bitter sobs, he gave himself up to it. Idly, he thought that he didn’t even think he had enough water left in him to make tears, but they were there anyway. His mind was awash in loss, in “might have beens” and “what ifs.” Not that that would help. He had to stow his crap and get the job done.
Cas, for his part, stood completely still, hands braced at his side, likely from shock, Dean thought, but also likely trying to figure out what was going on with the very mixed messages Dean was sending. His traitorous body, however, ran his right hand up Cas’s neck where Dean had just vacated and cupped Cas’s cheek. He watched in horror as his thumb grazed the angel’s bottom lip. God, how he wanted to follow that trail with his own mouth.
. Embarrassing is what it was. His hair might be soft, and his skin might be the most hydrated it’s been in a decade, but having Sam
“Yes, and no. I haven’t seen or spoken to anyone in my family in years. The two men that killed Jimmy were themselves killed in a car accident a few months later. Their car apparently ran off the road into a river where they both drowned.”
Cas’ fierce blue eyes were still holding him in place, and Dean was happy to stay there all night if that’s what he wanted. If he were being honest with himself, he’d probably agree to anything Cas asked right now. If tonight had gone well, it was because Cas had made it so. It didn’t really matter what Cas said, Dean knew that he’d finally found the piece that had been missing. Professionally, and personally.
When it was over, he sat in the dirt next to his own sick and leaned against the front bumper.  Sweaty and exhausted, he just needed to collect himself before doing anything else.  Cas joined him on his right, sitting on the ground by his side and handing him an opened water bottle.  Grateful, Dean half smiled in thanks and used the first two mouthfuls to rinse and spit; trying to wash the acrid taste out of his mouth.
Still sobbing, Dean launched himself into Cas’s arms, and if he hadn’t been an angel the force of it probably would have thrown him off balance.  As it were though, he just held him, Dean’s face tucked into the crook of his neck and shoulder, Cas’s arms encircling him in comfort, hands resting on his back.  He kept Dean pulled in close and let him cry it out.  Judging by the alcohol on his breath and the empty whiskey bottle on the floor, he figured that Dean would have no memory of this in the morning.  But it was a start, and he’d take it.
“When I told you about it, did I say that he never laid a finger on me again?” Dean’s looked at Cas with intensity, not breaking eye contact.
But not today - at least not to Dean. Cas’ body was coiled tension waiting to pounce, his expression might be measured and calm but Dean could see the way he kept his eye on the window and the door leading outside. The man was on high alert, 48 hours, his ass.
Cas searched Dean’s eyes for the truth and it was confirmed there. He looked up at Bobby who was wearing an affectionate smile as he regarded Dean.
“Hey, listen Cas, a lot of people ask to have their copies of the calendar autographed. If...uh...you’d like, I can sign one for you? I’ll even run back to the aisle and pick you up a copy…”
The remainders of the six-pack were still sitting on the table where he had left it, but honestly, he didn’t want it. Didn’t care that he didn’t want it, didn’t even wish it was whiskey. If this was going to be Dean Winchester’s long dark night of the soul, worrying about where Cas was, if he was okay, he was going to do it sober. He picked up the beer by the handle of the carrying pack and placed the whole thing outside the front door of his room. Someone else could have it, he was done.
“You were incredible this evening, but our time is over.” Dean blinked a few times and sat back up, shaking his head a little bit as though waking from a nap. There was water left in the glass and Castiel handed it to him. The scene was over and having the sub take care of himself was another signal of the change. Once empty, he took the glass back and set it aside. Knowing that Dean’s knees were probably stiff from kneeling so long, Castiel stood up and helped him to his feet. He encouraged him to sit at the table for a few minutes until he felt ready to get dressed.
“It’s open, c’mon in.” The door cracked and a head full of tousled raven hair and blue eyes peeked around the door, and lower, a hand carrying a single mug of steaming coffee.
He slipped the ring the rest of the way on, behind and around him he could hear some “ahh’s” and sniffles. From the side of his vision, he was pretty sure he saw Sam wiping a tear from his cheek while Eileen rested her head on his shoulder.
Dean quickly looked for injuries but didn’t see anything obvious.  He was breathing, but he was also pale, very pale. Dean cradled him gently, himself being almost too exhausted to move and still in considerable pain.  Somewhere in the back of his mind, he thought maybe he was experiencing whatever Cas was, that this was how the healing worked.  Was the drain he was feeling on his energy what Cas had experienced every time he had healed Dean over the years?
“Well, I’m guessing it’s only been a few hours for you, but going on twenty-five years for me.  You don’t need to say anything.”
The last place to check was the small desk along the wall.  The top was empty, save for a fine layer of dust but there was a drawer.  It didn’t look big enough to hold the book he imagined he was looking for, but you never know.  Sighing, he sat in the chair and ran his fingers along the desk edge anyway.  He wondered how often Cas had sat here, what he had used the desk for – if at all.
Letting go of the hand he had been holding all along, Dean reached his right hand into his pocket and pulled out the silver and blue ring he had offered Cas on New Year’s Day.  Taking Cas’ left hand he slid the ring over the first knuckle of his ring finger and stopped.
“It makes sense, thank you.” From his expression, it was clear that he wasn’t thrilled but knew he had no other options. Benny and Jack took their leave, Sam and Charlie were left to deal with the two men who were each sitting expectantly for the other shoe to drop.
Cas quietly placed Dean on the other bed.  He used the dingy old blanket to cover him up and watched him sleep for a few moments, drinking in the sight of the boy who would grow into the man that was now his.  His heart ached for all of the hurt he would still have to endure, tonight was just a band-aid against a lifetime of trauma.  It wasn’t fair.  Tearing up he leaned over and kissed the sleeping form on the forehead, softly whispering: “The world has never shown you the kindness that you deserve.  I’m so sorry.”
“You’re dead to me after tonight, you got that? Dead.” Dean was crying openly now. “I heard all about it tonight Dean, heard them talking about how depraved you are, about how much you like it. They said you were a real treat.  Proud of your self boy?”  John pulled the crying teenager back and slammed him into the wall again, knocking any breath he had left out of his lungs. “I just found out that my faggot of a son likes sucking cock for money, useless piece of shit that you are, I want to see for myself before I finish beating the shit out of you and leave you in the garbage where you belong.”
He mindlessly tapped his fingers to the beat of the music coming through on the radio, the background noise was soothing and helped him focus- something he had learned after years of traveling in the impala.  He needed a solid strategy, he wanted it to work out with himself and Dean. Even if it didn’t, Sam needed things to be better.  Cas felt genuinely guilty about that, he owed it to Sam to at least help Dean break the unhealthy patterns that were weighing him down.
He rubbed his hand over the fabric and smiled softly, again indulging his imagination, wondering what it would have been like to curl up under it on a cool night, Cas draped along and over his body.  He sat on the edge of the bed and then laid back, allowing himself to enjoy that fantasy just a little longer. It took a deep breath and stretch on his shoulder muscles that were stiff from the drive to realize that this bed felt very familiar.
Sam turned Dean’s way again and gave him one of his complicated smiles. The one that said that he did indeed have more to say but not at the moment.
Dean threaded his right hand into Cas’ hair at the back of his head and kept it there, using it to keep him close. His left arm circled around to his back and he clenched a handful of the maroon hoodie. Finally, being able to hold Cas after so long, he had no intention of letting him go again.  The fact of the matter being that Dean had always been touch starved, and now that he didn’t have to be, that he could have this, something deep inside him started to thaw and he was almost physically unable to let Cas go.
Dean wasn’t sure exactly how long he sat on the floor, back leaning against the bed, but it was long enough for the afternoon sun to wane.  The shadows it cast lengthened, and it wouldn’t be long before they disappeared with the sunset.  His muscles were getting stiff, he was too old to sit on the hard floor for hours at a time if he didn’t have to.
Whatever happy bubble they’d been in at the table seemed deflated now.  Cas’s smile had been replaced with concern, not unlike Sam’s resting bitch face, and something else. Something he hadn’t seen in Cas for a long time. Not since before he fell, back when he had all of that badass don’t give me your shit energy. Dean remembered thinking that was kind of hot at the time.
“I’ve existed for a long time Dean, and despite the costs, the time I’ve spent with you was the best. I don’t regret any of it. My powers are almost gone, we’ve established that I’ve outlived my usefulness, and Jack is dead. There’s nothing for me here.” Sad blue eyes looked into his, and Dean swore that the pain in them broke something in his soul. Like the profound bond Cas had talked about just shattered into a million pieces. Tears pricked in the back of his eyes from the pain of it. “Message received, Dean. Goodbye.”
That hurt a little bit, it had been hard watching Cas take his place at the hospital and now it felt like Cas was pushing him out again.  He tried to hide it in his voice but didn’t do a good job.  “But what about food, you can’t cook, and the medication.  What if Dean gets worse and you need to go back to the hospital? He’s my brother and we always take care of each other.”
“For simplicity, let’s just say that I was reassigned. I had, however, been able to maintain a few...discreet connections to Canada over the years.  When I needed a place to land after Budapest, they agreed to take me in, set me up with a new identity.”
“Everything looks pretty flat on the satellite map, Dean, if you can’t see him up ahead, he might already have turned off somewhere.”
“You done? I only came here for the free lunch, and I’m getting hungry.” Bobby’s drawl brought them both back to reality. Reluctantly he let Dean go and stepped back. Covering his sudden sense of vulnerability, he focused on Charlie.
The next morning, Dean had tried again as did Sam.  But he had said no and now, a day and a half later he was still here.  Embarrassed now because he knew he was behaving like a child. Castiel, a seraph, celestial warrior, older than humanity itself, hiding in his room.  Because his feeling were hurt, and he didn’t know to get out of the bunker without getting them hurt more.
Cas didn’t move and was still lying on the bed when Dean turned back to look at him.  He looked damn fine in the rumpled blue flannel and grey shirt that he’d stolen from Dean’s closet.  Ignoring the draw to check out his hips and legs, Dean shifted his eyes up to meet Cas’s deep blue ones.  He wasn’t sure if he was seeing amusement or concern, probably a mixture of both. Cas didn’t say anything and just waited for whatever Dean was going to say next.
Cas continued as if Dean hadn’t spoken.” Sam made me aware Dean that after Lucifer killed me, you didn’t deal very well with my absence. That you volunteered for suicide missions and went so far as killing yourself on your hunt at the asylum. Is that true?”
“No, but as we discussed, it’s your only chance.” Sam picked up the pile of papers he’d just printed and tapped their edges on the table to straighten the pile. “Besides, there’s something about him that I like. Things might actually be ok.”
“Looks great Cas, I’m thankful no matter what.” He took the seat in front of his meal, shooting a smile across the table to show that he was sincere. Canned soup was canned soup, but he had to admit that the grilled cheese was properly made with a perfect ratio of cheese to bread and a deep golden color. “You’ve, ah, done a good job taking care of things around here while I was out of it, I just want you to know that I appreciate it….all of it.”
With one hand on the doorknob and using the other to undo the lock and chain, Dean opened the door just enough for Cas to see him, but not wide enough for him to enter. Maybe he could try to push him away one last time. Cas probably hated him by now anyway, what did it matter?
“I am such a fucking useless piece of shit. I fucked it up, I fuck up everything.” His hands covered his face, but you could hear low sobs and see his shoulders shaking.
Dean wasn’t used to this Cas, usually a little barb like the one he just thew sent Cas off his respective corner to regroup. He had no clue how to respond, he could feel tears well up in his eyes. Fuck, he felt off keel, like he had no control anymore. Cas and Sam were talking about him behind his back, this couldn’t be good.
Dean cried out as Cas absolutely demolished his rim, sucking hard and nibbling lightly on the sensitive muscle.
“Dude, I have never seen wind like that before.” Sam was frowning at the entrance, bitch face in full effect at the state of the weather outside. Dean couldn’t blame him. It was horrific outside, they could barely hear each other talk, and he was so glad they weren’t out in its clutches.
” He was suddenly surrounded by alphas, Gadreel and Sam having materialised out of nowhere. He had about two seconds to gather himself before they all started fucking
A laugh bubbled up, tensing every muscle in his upper body until he let it escape in a deep, elated rumble.
All too soon the bill arrived, and Castiel snatched it up before Dean even had the opportunity to protest. He was the alpha, after all. He was progressive in most fronts, but there were some things he still thought were proper, even if it were only on a first date. Some base part of him wanted to show Dean, to prove to him, that he could provide for them both.
“I am so proud of you, Dean.” After everything was cleaned up and dry, Dean, Cas and their tiny pup settled into the warm, safe nest. Dean was beyond exhausted, so Cas held the infant up to Deans chest, to try and get him to latch. Dean tucked the baby under his arm like a football, and brought his mouth to his nipple. His tiny, pink lips smacked open and closed, sensing the milk so near. Dean sighed and grinned when he felt the first hesitant suckles, but as soon as the milk started flowing, his son was away.
“I can assure you, this is not a dream.” Cas shifted slightly closer, gently taking one of Deans hands, as if he were afraid of startling him. “I’ve been waiting a long time for you, but I knew you’d get here eventually.” Dean’s heart stuttered in his chest as Cas’ very real fingers laced with his, binding them together for the first time in years.
Melissa whispered his last name like it was the dark lords, and her eyes went wide. Ever since he ran from his home, he hadn’t turned the TV to anything but the movie channels, or looked at his cell phone. He didn’t know how his parents had reacted to him being missing. “Oh sweetie, your parents are so worried about you.” She didn’t sound… accusing, more… sad.
“Hey, Cas.” He winced when his voice broke on Cas’ name, but the other guy mustn’t’ve noticed, he just smiled at Dean, and shoved his hands in his pockets.
When he didn’t answer right away, Benny just started yelling. The contraction passed, so he gulped in a quick breath, and tried to make his voice sound strong. He failed pretty spectacularly.
Take a chance and swerve, which would probably be disastrous in the wet weather, or hit the car, and the family in it, side on and possibly maim, or kill a lot of people.
Sam seemed to have the same idea, because he threw his arm out, catching Dean before he could bust through the door.
Dean wandered to the kitchen, where his parents seemed to be still talking. He heard his name, and stopped just outside the door, where they couldn’t see him.
Cas was having none of that. “I want to hear you.” The alpha pulled the blanket away from the omega, who whined in desperation. He couldn’t stop the noises coming out of him, but he really didn’t want Sam to hear him. That was just beyond mortifying.
that word still felt weird to him, so he stopped teasing. He grinned when Cas let out a shaky breath and moved in his seat. Dean almost choked on his food when he saw Cas subtly adjust his hard on under the table.
“Please forgive me, Dean.” He didn’t – he didn’t know what Cas meant, so he stood up and grabbed his shoulder, because he looked like he was going to pass out.
Dean, is that I also, cannot sire offspring.” Castiel was shaking, enough so only Dean could see or feel it against him, but it was enough to tell him that Castiel was barely holding on. He was just as scared as Dean was, taking just as much of a chance on whatever they could be, as Dean. Finding out that Castiel couldn’t have kids either, that was kind of a surprise, but with it came the cold hard relief of guilt washing away like footprints in the sand.
“What are we gonna do?” Dean let the statement hang in the air, looking down at their baby, who was trying to sort of smile. He looked happy, anyway, probably because both of his parents were there with him. Dean felt Cas shrug, and then he was leaning back, away from Dean. He almost whined at the loss of contact, but Cas placed his hand on Deans knee, close to Link.
He had a good routine going, and he felt like he was making enough money so he wouldn’t have to work for the last two months of his pregnancy. Benny hadn’t told his other work mates he was expecting, thankfully leaving the decision up to Dean. Benny had also relented, and let Dean take on more strenuous work. He had the ability, and Dean promised the alpha he wouldn’t push himself. He wasn’t gonna put his baby at risk just for his pride, he was better than that.
“Can i - i need to -” Cas growled, voice wavering. Dean nodded quickly, barely knowing what he was agreeing to. Cas swooped in before Dean had even stopped moving his head and soft, plush lips met his in a hungry, desperate kiss.
“So what did you say to the judge to convince him to just give us three kids?” The idea was slowly becoming a reality and that should have scared the absolute shit out of him. Driving the cart between the isles, Dean watched Cas pick out a huge package of diapers. He wasn’t scared. He realised that with Cas, if he was with him, they could do anything together. They were a great team, looking after three kids would be a piece of cake.
The little guy smiled behind his hand, and rubbed his neck. “So please don’t kill me.” Dean looked back and frowned.
Dean laughed, he couldn’t help himself. The euphoric feeling after a good orgasm had settled over him and he was done. All he wanted to do was crawl into bed with Cas.
The alpha flexed his pelvis again, coupling it with a roll forward that had Dean gasping in delight.
Gagging and shaking, Dean treaded water as he stared at the sagging, bloated carcass in front of him. It must have been washed into the tree during some storm surge, because there it was, slightly submerged, stinking and just what he needed.
“Well, get to know me better, and you might find out.” With a cheeky wink, that seriously made Deans whole body almost self-combust, Cas disappeared out the door. Dean had no idea what had just happened, but he knew he’d taken a risk that he wouldn’t have even contemplated a few weeks ago. Either he was finally getting more confident about his particular singular gender attraction, or he was getting stupidly
He bit his lip when Cas didn’t reply, but decided to give him a couple of minutes. Maybe he’d comed his brains out and had fainted. Dean grinned when he thought of Cas moaning his name. He cleaned up, and snuggled down in bed, deciding he should probably text Cas again.
By the time lunch rolled around, Dean was back to feeling hollow and invisible, even though two girls commented how they had missed him at the party on Saturday. He didn’t even know their names.
what they’ve done, but his inner omega was screaming at him, telling him he should smell like his mate in the basest way possible.
“I don’t deserve you, Cas.” Dean felt all his insecurities suddenly float to the surface, in a bubble of emotion that he could barely control. Dean took a breath and tried to ignore the shaking of his hands as one scrubbed his overheated face. He wouldn’t cry, he wouldn’t. Cas just stared at him, blue eyes wide. “You deserve someone that’s gonna give you everything you want, everything you need, and that – that’s just not how I’m built.” Dean couldn’t help the bitter twist to his words, but they were all true. He would give Cas the world, if he could figure out how to shrink it down and put it in his hands. He could barely even look at the alpha, suddenly feeling so small and fragile.
He didn’t even think he’d be a very good father, but that decision had kinda been taken out of his hands. He had at least three months before he’d have to tell his parents. They would notice when he didn’t have his next heat. Maybe he could play it off as teenage imbalance, they said that could happen in sex ed. The teenage body was still adjusting, so heats could be irregular.
Heavily lubed, gloved fingers probed at his entrance, which was soon going to be an exit. He watched Melissa’s face for any sign of something wrong, but she seemed pretty happy. Well, not
He was actually scared as shit when he boarded the plane to Afghanistan. His mom, dad and Sam were there to see him off, and he hugged each of them like he’d never see them again. A little part of his mind told him he wouldn’t, because how often on the news were there reports of soldiers dying in combat?
Dean found a blushing Sam loitering near the doors, hand in hand with Jess, who looked pretty damn happy too.
Dean sagged in Cas’ hold, all the emotion boiling up inside him, threatening to escape in a way that would be both explosive and dangerous. Instead, he did the one thing that would channel the energy into something he could control.
The way Cas talked was one of the things he loved about the alpha, so he couldn’t really complain. He was about to argue that they loved each other equally, and it wasn’t a damn competition, when a large, excited tangle of long limbs and shaggy hair practically fell into their cave.
“Am I – am I dreaming?” Dumb question, really, but it was a possibility. Maybe he was in a coma, or surgery? He wasn’t a brain surgeon; he didn’t know how that stuff worked. Cas, however real or imaginary, stood before him and chuckled.
“Jesus, Cas. Your something else, you know that?” Dean kissed Cas, pulling back when their smiles made it almost impossible.
Cas opened his mouth, and Dean politely waited for him to say something, when they heard voices, coming from deeper in the bush. Cas frowned, but nodded when Dean held his finger to his lips. They didn’t know who else could be on the island; it could be drug smugglers or some undiscovered cannibal tribe, for all they knew.
The house they pulled up to was decrepit and almost decomposing, a perfect hide out for an angry ghost. Apparently some kids had broken into the house and woken the sucker up, so now they had to clean up the mess.
“Uh, yeah, nah, everything’s – everything’s great, Sammy.” His brother didn’t seem to believe him, and Dean didn’t blame him. Maybe he should just lay everything out, and then let the emotions loose. “You remember a couple of months ago, uh, when Lucifer used me as a punching bag and, ah –” Sam put his hand on his shoulder, cutting him off.
“That was pretty damn hot.” Cas moaned as another orgasm shuddered through him, but he cupped Deans cheek with the hand that was no longer stripping his cock.
Dean grinned when he could practically feel the eye roll aimed his way, and when Cas sighed with what was clearly deep exasperation, he couldn’t help the bark of laughter that escaped.
Nah, he preferred the ones that were clearly homemade, by people who obviously loved each other. To have the kind of trust and commitment to put something so intimate and passionate on the internet… it was something Dean craved, more than he felt comfortable admitting.
Dean spun his chair around in a slow circle, staring at the plain white walls. It really was the most boring office in the world. Maybe he could ask Bobby if he could spruce it up a bit.
“I dunno, but we keep eating it, so we can only blame ourselves for that.” Chuck sat back, staring at Dean. He could feel his best friends gaze trying to penetrate him, in a totally creepy way.
under his breath. He narrowed his eyes at his brother, because Sam could read him so well. There wasn’t any hiding shit from him. Speaking of, “Oh, this is Sam, my brother.” Sam smiled, and shook Cas’ hand.
past Benny and made a dash for the bathroom. He locked the door behind him before bursting into uncontainable sobs. He didn’t even really know what had upset him, but his emotions were going to town with it. He clapped a hand over his mouth after a particularly loud sob, and closed his eyes. He just needed to get it out, and he would be fine. The mood swings themselves came and went pretty damn fast, so he just had to ride it out.
good.” They both laughed, delighted with the fact they both had partners. Dean jumped when a tray was set down next to his, and he turned to see Cas smiling shyly down at him.
to Sam. He had to stop the pain inside him, the pain of knowing he had come so close to finding his happily ever after, only to have it snatched away by some cruel twist of a pin.
“Hey, Dean?” He turned to face her and smiled, hoping to look welcoming. It obviously worked because she smiled brightly back at him. “We’re all going back to Ash’s place, do you wana come too? Chucks keen, well, he’s keen on Becky and she’s coming so of course he is.” Dean chewed his lip, wondering what the hell too do. He didn’t want to seem like a party pooper by saying no, but he really didn’t want to make Cas feel even more uncomfortable either. He could just limit his interaction with him for the night, give him time to cool off… yeah, why the hell not.
Dean made it home in record time, and he was surprised he hadn’t been pulled over. He was probably driving erratically and he was sure he’d sped through at least one stop sign. Hell, he was lucky he wasn’t dead.
to people as quickly as Sam, and that was fine. Everyone was different. It had taken him a long time, but he had accepted who he was, and what he liked. That included not sharing his life story with someone he’d just met. As much as he liked Cas, the short time he had known him, he wasn’t just going to open himself up like that. All it caused was heart break and misery, and they couldn’t afford for that to happen. If they did end up staying on the island, not that that looked likely, they would have to work together to stay alive.
used my feelings against you. So I kept it hidden, despite wanting to tell you so very badly.” Cas looked at Dean, then, big blue eyes asking for forgiveness, which was dumb, because he had nothing to be sorry for.
someone to blame. Otherwise it’s just the world being an asshole, and you can’t really blame the universe, can ya?” Benny nudged Dean’s shoulder, and Dean couldn’t help but chuckle.
Cas stood on the threshold of his house, cool as a cucumber and completely oblivious to Deans internal panic attack. He could tell he was flushed and sweaty, he must have looked
“Yes! Ah, yeah that sounds good. Always studying to be done, right?” For fuck sake, where was a hole he could crawl into?
“He’s hungry, Dean. Why do you try and get him to attach, while I clean you up.” Dean nodded, and let her get on with it. Benny hadn’t moved, for which Dean was thankful. He didn’t think he’d be able to sit up on his own anyway. Very carefully, he lifted his tee shirt up, with Benny’s help, and exposed one of his puffy, slightly swollen nipples. He assumed they were reacting to the birth, getting ready to do their jobs.
He usually read some Fanfiction before getting into any porn, just so he would be quick but tonight he could find a decent video and take his time. He loved his family, but he was counting down the days until he could go to college. Some actual privacy would be nice, even if he had a roommate, he was sure they could work something out.
It should have unnerved him, but instead, a feeling of deep calm and protection enveloped him, making him sigh. With that small breath, he realised two, very major things.
“C – casss.” Fuck he sounded awful. At least he could speak, though. Cas stroked his hair, which felt pretty damn nice.
“What’s your interest in me? I’m sorry it’s so blunt, but I need to know. Why do you care?” Dean was just a troubled kid to Benny, but the Alpha was treating him like he was part of his family. Dean didn’t know what to think. Benny looked surprised, and concerned.
Dean then looked up and noticed Eileen hadn’t touched her beer, but was discreetly only drinking water from the pitcher on the table. An odd buzzing feeling started right in the pit of his stomach, so he carefully put his fork down, and wiped his mouth with the napkin by his plate.
Texting Sam on the way back to his apartment, he realised he was done dating. There couldn’t possibly be anyone more perfect for him than Castiel, so what was the point, really.
“I was under the impression that you and Charlie were dating. Was I wrong?” Everything seemed to teeter and fall as Cas exploded into gutsy, heaving laughter. Charlie was right alongside him, actually falling backwards in her mirth. Dean had no idea what was going on, so he just looked around hesitantly as the whole circle, expect for him and Chuck, dissolved into a laughing, crying puddle.
“If you’ll allow me, I will fix what has been plaguing you, Dean.” He didn’t know what the hell the guy had done, but for some reason, he trusted him. It was like an instinct, something he didn’t consciously decide to do; rather, it was something that had been there all along.
He couldn’t say goodbye, everything was gonna be fine, and if the fucking paramedics hurried up, they would be. He knew that if he could just get Cas to a hospital, then everything would be
“Gadreel and Gabriel didn’t react. What does that mean?” It was a pain to have to constantly find the herbs and mix up the paste, so if he could go without it, he would. Gabriel hadn’t wanted to be near the asshole alphas that had spoken against omegas, so he seemed trustworthy, and Gadreel hadn’t said a word down at the beach. Dean didn’t trust easily, but living that close to people on an island, probably barely surviving, concessions would have to be made.
we had something in common. I just wanted to give you the chance to own up to it yourself, to accept that there truly is nothing wrong with you, but I see that you still need some help in that department.” Dean had no idea what was happening, and he couldn’t decide whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. The threat of an alpha rage still hung over their heads.
Dean fiddled with his phone, turned it on, checked his notifications and then flicked it off again. He contemplated texting Sam, but he didn’t really want to have to deal with his teasing while he was already stressed as hell.
what I was going to say, but if you don’t want to…” Cas looked uncertain for the first time, and Dean couldn’t have that.
“I don’t understand –” Sam dropped his hands to Dean’s stomach, and drew in a shocked breath. Dean just sighed and nodded. “You’re gonna have a baby?” Sam sounded, well, in awe, really. He supposed Sam hadn’t had much exposure to pregnant people.
“Um, well it’s hard to tell without seeing you guys together. I think… if she laughs at your stupid jokes and shit like that, then yeah, go for it. No harm in trying, right?” He grinned over at his brother, who looked equal parts thrilled and terrified.
Right, he had to take control of this clusterfuck of a bad idea. Turning on the Winchester charm, he turned fully around and slapped on a smirk.
“I said, I want to hear you.” Cas grabbed a handful of each of his cheeks and spread them, and Dean had never felt so exposed, or so turned on. If his alpha wanted to hear him, who was he to deny him?
“Nah, I’m good. I was just trying to remember if Crowley gave us any homework, that’s all.” A thinly veiled lie, but a lie non the less. He didn’t want to lie to what very well could be his new friends, and he certainly didn’t want to be caught out. He wanted them to trust him, so he could trust them in return. It was his, and Chucks, chance for a bigger social family, and he wasn’t going to fuck it up.
he wasn’t going to off himself. “Dude, what I meant was, I’m gonna get Cas to wipe my memory of him.” Sam just… stared at him.
“You alright back there, cher?” Dean hadn’t been familiar with Cajun speak at all, so when he’d found out the meaning behind Benny’s use of
“Dean, why are you looking like your expecting me to drink? Do I seem like a hussy to you?” That earnt Cas more than a few good natured shoves and kicks. Dean blushed, but found himself blurting out what he
“I can’t do this anymore, Sam.” He saw his brother’s confused face, so soldiered on despite the thundering headache he still sported. “I can’t live like this, you’ve seen me, hell, I know you’ve heard me at night. I can’t go on like this.” He drew in a shuddering breath, and realised only then that he was crying. God fucking damnit. “There’s only one option I can see.” Sam’s eyes widened in apparent horror, as he took Deans the totally wrong way.
“For fuck sake, we’ve been walking for hours.” Dean wondered if they had been on the boat with them, he couldn’t really remember, that night was a bit of a blur. A different voice scolded him.
Dean smiled; trust Cas to find a way for them to hang out together without attracting suspicions. He promised himself then, that he would take Cas out on a proper date one day soon, no matter what.
Dean slid his tongue in further, testing the waters of Cas’ mouth. He tasted like toothpaste and chewing gum, and Dean found himself wanting to scoop the taste right out of his mouth. His hands had found their way to Cas’ hips, and he pulled him as close as he could until their chests were nestled against each other and their cocks were lined up,
he could feel his tadpole twitching, probably swimming around, happy as pie. He wasn’t losing his baby, he was just feeling its movements.
“No, it’s not.” Cas looked up in surprise, and Gadreel cocked his head to the side, clearly eager for Deans answer. “You’ve got Sam, Bobby, Ellen, you’ll meet her later,” Dean shuffled their pup around to face his father, who he blinked sleepily at, “but most importantly, you’ve got us.” Cas couldn’t fight the smile that crossed his lips, and even Gadreel had uplifted the edges of his mouth.
“Hello, Dean. I’m glad you could make it.” Dean had to be imagining the blush on Cas’ cheeks, or the way he was biting his lip –
It didn’t actually take very long to get back; the rain and darkness making it seem like a long way from the beach. Once they arrived back at their camp, Dean was very glad he had made the group move. Every single piece of evidence they had even settled there had been washed away, and Dean could see by the marks on the trunks of the trees how high the water had risen.
He wrote some notes on the book, pretty much whatever Crowley put up on the board. All he wanted to do was go home and sleep. He was tired and achy, but at least he didn’t feel nauseous, like he had that morning. He’d have to hide that from his family; maybe he should buy some Tums.
“Hello Dean.” Dean couldn’t help the shiver that raced down his spine, nor could he ignore the tension building in his stomach. With Charlie gone, it really was time to ask Cas if he wanted to stay over, he couldn’t put it off anymore.
“Did you…” Castiel seemed reluctant to finish his question, and Dean had a fleeting thought of not wanting him to ask. “Did you have a spontaneous heat, by any chance?” Well, looked like Castiel was trying to figure out what Dean already knew. How Castiel found the balls to ask him right out, Dean didn’t know, but he was an alpha after all. Dean had a choice to make, either he lied to Castiel, once again, or for once, he could lay it all out and let the poor guy decide, like Benny had suggested.
When he saw Extended Stay America, he was impressed. It looked way out of his price range, but he thought he should try anyway. He managed to barter the lady at the front desk down to eighty bucks a week, which meant he had about a month before he would run out of money, a month and a half if he was careful. He made his way to his room, and snorted when he saw it was room sixty nine. Sam would have found it funny.
“Dean, I do believe your little one is movin’ around. That’s what you can feel.” Dean’s eyes widened in surprise, and when Benny took his hands away, Dean replaced them with his own. Softly, so
“Fine, but don’t blame me if you get embarrassed. Have you ever progressed to third base?” Dean knew Cas meant like, hand stuff under clothes, but he watched anyway as almost everyone giggled and drank, all except Cas, Dean and Chuck. He was surprised, maybe Cas and Charlie hadn’t been together all that long.
he was, what a good mate he was going to make, how Cas would take care of him and whatever cubs they had.
“I’m alright. I can understand your trepidation, though.” Cas nudged the spider with the toe of his boot. “It was quite big, wasn’t it?” Cas smiled at him, and Dean was immediately settled. Damn omeganess. It wasn’t so bad, though.
anyone waiting for you back home?” Dean patted the beta on the back, and he could feel the tension there. Poor guy, they’d been on the island for maybe ten weeks, and everyone else had been parading their couplings around in front of him. Dean made a mental note to be less obvious in their PDA.
“Well, who am I to judge, right?” Dean smirked and shrugged, trying to lighten the sudden shadow that seemed to have descended. Cas moved closer, and seemed to be weighing up his options, if the frown pinching his brows was any indication. Dean chose to wait it out, letting the alpha make the first move.
Dean howled into the pillow of his arm, which was not nearly enough to cover the noise. It echoed around the small cave, followed closely by Cas’ own roar of satisfaction at pleasing his omega. Dean whimpered when he felt his cock expel its small amount of semen, but the real kicker was the absolute flood of slick that erupted from him at Cas’ continued assault of his prostate. The alpha cried out in pleasure as his mouth and throat were practically covered in his omegas flow.
“Ah well, I won’t keep you, I hope you have a pleasant day,” Victor says as he begins to walk away, he stops and turns though. “I almost forgot; I’ll see you up at Jody’s later today.”
He’d cleaned himself up quickly using a corner of his blanket to rid himself of the mess and rose as normal to start the day, though a dark feeling settled in his chest.
“What about your shoulder? You can’t think you’re going to lift yourself on it,” Dean asks incredulously.
Dean lays back closing his eyes at the weight Cas’ words carry. He’s never heard those words spoken to him, and until now he doesn’t think he’s had cause to believe them. But with Cas’ hand cupping his cheek and the air around them soft and quiet maybe he starts to believe it.
It feels odd to him that he’s become the person that he used to either try to steal from, bet against, or work for, during the few nights they’ve spent in the towns. Cas seems to not find it at all out of the ordinary. Then again this has more or less always been his life.
Guilt curls in his chest. “No I’m the reason you were in danger, I caused this, my past I—. Just being beside you puts you in danger.”
Intuition tells him that they are as far from harmless as can be. His hand brushes his reloaded pistol and he weighs his options. Brandish the gun now and hope to scare them off or see what they want. Perhaps it's nothing more than a ration of food or directions—though the prickling on his neck shows that he knows how unlikely that is.
“Does that mean that your Sam is gonna go on a nice run with Sammy tomorrow morning?” Dean asked as he plated some sweets.
“Sam, that's incredible, congratulations!” Dean’s about to stand to give his brother another hug and a couple slaps on the shoulder but Sam launches into a breathless explanation.
Dean’s heart had hammered in his chest, no longer from the fear that overtook him as he began to fall, now the racing was from the tension that had settled over them. The air thrummed with it around them. It would be so easy to lean in and close the distance, so easy and so dangerous.
“Of course I would, but I can’t just pick one. Names are suppose’ to mean more than that.” He’s only ever had this type of conversation with Sam before. No one else ever seemed to care one way or the other if he had a name to call himself by.
Precome spurts from the tip of Cas’ cockhead and a shudder rips through him. Like a domino effect, Dean’s own cock jumps and spurts milky fluid into the slick hot grip Cas has on him.
It takes them about fifteen minutes to walk the distance from the main house to where they’ll be living. As the house comes into view Dean’s a bit apprehensive. It’s small, big enough to fit four or five people if they were really packed in there, but if this is the house that the employees share, he thinks they must be living in such close quarters that they’ll be stumbling over each other constantly.
“What’s it like?” he asks. When he sees that Dean doesn't have an idea as to what he clarifies, “Leaving I mean, what's it like to just say goodbye to a place and never look back?”
They bask in the glow for some time, their breathing evening out again as the sweat cools on their skin. It’s quiet and peaceful and it makes his heart clench in his chest.
He lays out the plan, the bare-bones structure of some of it has Sam’s smile wilting now and then but he says he can do the translation if given enough time. He talks and talks until he's covered everything twice, he poses his own questions and answers them too just to show that he understands this plan better than he has any other they’ve concocted over the years. Through it all there's an undercurrent of how much he needs this to work, how badly he needs Cas to come back to them. And they both understand the need in their own way, Jack needs his dad back, Sam needs his friend.
When night comes and Sam heads off to bed, and Jack heads off to do whatever young adults who are actually three year olds, but are
It’s obscene, watching his achingly hard cock pass through the channel of Dean’s taut mouth, watching as Dean gives himself over for Castiel’s use. He feels the stirrings of his climax low in his groin, feels it creep its way down to his balls. His breath is punched from his lungs again as he watches Dean’s eyes roll back into his head whenever he is a titch overzealous in his thrusting.
“So most of the staff lives on the other side of the main house, a few live out closer to the stables, the rest live in town and ride into the farm to work, but this place here is yours.” Jody gestures to the house with her hand and Dean just barely manages to keep his jaw from hitting the ground at the fact that it’s theirs and theirs alone. “There's a stocked kitchen and cold cellar inside but you also have the option of coming up to the main area for food whenever you’d like. If you need anything I’ll be back up at the house, if not I’ll be back in a few hours, right around supper, to grab you both and make some introductions. Give Kevin another few minutes to make his way over here to get Ringer here and get him taken care of.” She sends a slightly concerned look to the horse before waving at the both of them and turning to walk back to her house.
He doesn’t know if Cas is being purposely avoidant or not or if he regrets any of his actions from his first night. Worry curls itself around his chest. He decides that he will act as he would with anyone else, respectful and definitely showing no interest in anything other than an acquaintanceship. It is foolish anyways, his time on the farm will be brief, he doesn’t need to go about forging relationships; his life is not one that lends itself to friends, or to partners of any kind.
“You seem to think that my life on our farm has led me to know nothing of… repugnant activities,” Cas says warily.
He knows there's no way to become accustomed to the feeling but he wishes it wasn’t so overwhelming all the same.
His stomach churns when he digs it out of his closet, unwashed even after all this time. His fingers brush over the edge of the stain as his heart thumps painfully in his chest. Soon, soon Cas will be back with him, soon Dean can say all that he needs to say, he needs to believe that.
As Dean lays wrapped in the blanket that night, he thinks about Sam. Sam, the boy who had pleaded for years for Dean to name himself, who wanted to see his brother escape the life he lived as he himself slowly was. What would Sam think of his name? Would he be happy or angry for it having taken him so long to finally do? Would he think it rude that a relative stranger offered up one name and Dean had jumped on it where he had offered ten, twenty, thirty only to be shut down each time?
Cas plants his hand against Dean’s throat again and runs his thumb down the column of his neck and the bow snaps. He groans as his release hits him like a bull, shattering him, slamming into him strong enough to knock the air from his lungs and he lays there, pleasure drowning him in waves as he struggles to even breathe. His vision whites out as his brain shuts off for a few seconds.
As they travel on, Cas comes alive again, but he also withers. Dean never asked why Cas hadn’t wanted Gabriel to give him an answer about relaying letters, but he reckons it may have to do with the fact that if Gabriel refused, he never would have left and Castiel needed to leave.
When he sees the open door his footing stumbles briefly; suddenly struck with the image of the man from earlier in the day, and the thoughts that had run through his mind and he is now far more nervous than he would have thought at the prospect of meeting the man.
It hurts more than ever when, even after going after their loved ones, Chuck kills all the people they saved over the years in another blitzkrieg. It almost seems like retaliation for daring to demand that the universe be put back to rights. It hurts, even more, when he realizes how close he could be to the truth.
“Hmm I wanted it, hell I had it for a little while, but it's not for me, I learned that first hand, I can't hang up the gloves and leave this for some other poor schmuck to deal with.”
He submits when Cas gently pushes him to sit on the bed, he kicks off his shoes as Cas’ fingers run through his hair, tomorrow he’ll wash, tomorrow he’ll take care of himself, tonight there's no time for that.
Cas looks at him after minutes spent staring at the ground and asks, “What deems a life as unsaveable?”
“I ain't got none, sir, on account of my mama passin’ before she could give me one.” It's only partially true but it’s all this man will be getting from him.
“Cas?” Is all Dean says, the word is let out on a breath, barely audible over the rushing in his ears.
“You better stay awake Cas; I swear to god.” Cas manages to roll his eyes which must be a good sign.
Flashes of heat overwhelm him as he stares at Dean. His hand flexes and tenses both against the wall and into Dean’s hair.
“Morning boy,” his father calls as they get closer. Dean raises his head and Castiel pauses a moment.
“I want to learn,” Cas says without prompting, looking just past him, “I want to go off to school, or even to a job, and just be more than a farmer's son.” Cas sounds as though he's lost in another world, where he has all that he wants and he knows that feeling well; sometimes that feeling is all that keeps him sane.
Together they walked into the library where Sam and Cas were both sitting talking, heads bent over a book. He couldn't think of why they would be doing research now but he didn't ask. He got the smallest glimpse at a drawing of an angel in death, it’s grace swirling around it before the spine was snapped shut.
His mind races all day, landing on Winchester without meaning to. Around his siblings' lunch he stumbles onto an idea thanks to Inias’ praise of his teaching. He had asked them if they thought he could teach anyone and they all replied with varying degrees of ‘you could teach a squirrel if you wanted to’ but he still has reservations about it, teaching an adult wouldn't be like teaching children but he resolves to ask Winchester the next time he gets a moment to.
Balthazar and Duma sprint up the stairs and right past him as he rounds the banister and he almost manages to tell them to stop before Ma shouts the same from downstairs. He gives them a look that says, ‘I tried to stop you’ as much as it says, ‘told you so’ and his siblings respond with a roll of their eyes before they walk quickly to their rooms to change. Laughing to himself, because he really did become what Gabriel had always referred to as the long-suffering older brother, he walks down the stairs and makes a direct path to the kitchen.
“It’s not that simple, you and your Cas you got your heads on straight early, Cas and I; I don't know if he’ll ever be in a position to accept that kind of truth from me, not after everything that happened, that I've done to him. I can’t jeopardize him being in my life because I want more... if he leaves- I don't know what I'd do.” Dean didn't look at the other version of himself while he spoke. He didn't need that barely concealed pity or unrestrained exasperation that might be adorning his doubles face.
“It’s good that you’ll be close to your brother,” Cas says though it seems like he’s unsure, or possibly like he’s trying to convince himself.
Even still a heat rises in his chest and lights a small flame upon his cheeks at what he could mean by it. “I’ll be sure to sneak it past my ma when I bring you supper,” he says with a smile. “Wouldn't do to have her think you've got an issue with the cooking, even if it’s valid."
He’s seen a lot of people in his life and met all sorts of folks, but this man blows them all out of the water. Pretty isn’t the right word for him; he seems stronger than ‘pretty’ could express, but he’s sure as can be that he’s never come across a man as gorgeous as this one.
Castiel wishes he could say how it's never a waste to spend time with Dean, but his father apparently took their conversation last night as a sign that being around Dean was a chore and is trying to alleviate that from his plate.
Cas sends him such a pleased smile that Dean feels the flip all over again. How he can make someone like Cas this happy is beyond him and he finds himself smiling in return because how can he not when there's so much fondness in his eyes.
He’s about to shove Cas’ hand off of him with an aggressive roll of his good shoulder when Cas’ hand trails its way down the length of his back, sliding gently over the ridges of scars he’s all but forgotten about, ones caused by falling on broken glass and knives and brass knuckles, ones he doesn’t remember getting, ones he can't ever forget.
Jack walks past some of the bushes lining the sidewalk in front of the church and Dean watches as they shrivel, almost like their very life is being sucked out of them. As concerning as that is, it's equally concerning when Jack shudders slightly as more and more of the plants die.
Dean has to agree with him, three days of damp cloths and some soap has made him long for even a basin out behind a tavern to clean in. He doesn't even care if the water is as cold as hell as long as it’s not poured from a canteen, he’ll be happy.
“No I know that but, this past year, you’ve really seemed to move past the idea that you needed records to be someone.”
He’s quiet with Cas that night, not reserved but quiet, they talk and play around and Dean finds himself weighed down by Cas in his lap a few times. He says it’s a pre-emptive repayment for the next few days when he’s busy making sure his siblings do as they should. He hates that there's a part of him that can’t ignore that he might just be a warm and willing body for Cas, he hates that he sometimes believes it over anything.
Dean pauses, but only for a second, to think about how truthful he should be in his answer. “We ran into a bit of trouble with some other travellers but we made it out okay.”
“Can you—I mean will you be the one dropping supper off tonight?” he sounds hopeful, but it's like he's trying to hide it.
After he finishes up, he makes his way over to the stables. He watches Cas from a distance, getting ready to face him again, something that has become suddenly and ridiculously more challenging since he finally properly saw his eyes. They’re the kind of eyes that pin you in place and he's left to do nothing but be suspended within their gaze, to allow Cas the chance to see into his soul if he wanted.
It’s an interesting switch for them. Weeks spent with Cas teaching Dean to read and write and now the opposite, Dean teaching Cas. The skills are wildly different but Dean likes that he has something to teach Cas, it makes him feel as though he’s got knowledge—that isn't about horses—that's of some worth for once.
Dean fumbles with the keys, Cas steps in with a questioning glance at him and goes about unlocking the door. His hands are shaking too damn much to handle a simple key. He flashes back to Cas prone on the ground, his hands shaking the same way then, and like a bull it slams into him. Cas is safe, they made it and Cas is safe.
Their breathing begins to settle and their come starts to dry on his chest. A small glob of it begins to slip down the curve of his stomach, trekking a cool path towards his back. Without thinking he stops it with his fingers collecting it on the pads and through a mix of burning desire and general curiosity he acts on an impulse he’s had for weeks.
Chuck fucking salutes him from across the field and that’s the last straw. More than ever he needs to set this right because this isn't how their lives will be lived. This isn't how the world ends, not like this. Not at the hands of some half-cocked megalomaniac with too much time on his hands and an unhealthy obsession with watching them suffer.
A part of him warns against what he knows his next move will be. Stopping for any length of time could be a death sentence, but he’s been walking for a day and a half and has reasonably covered nearly forty miles of terrain. He’s spent his life running, hiding in some way or another and he knew how hired patrols would search if they decided to come for him. So he’d done the opposite, hoping to give himself a bit more time if anyone in town felt he was worth the trouble of going after.
Jody shows up just after they’ve finished with their letters and they head to the stables as a group, though their time there is short, Dean is able to gather a feel for the space and how it all works and functions as a complete system.
Cold washes over Dean’s body, chasing away all the warmth surrounding Cas that used to sit in his chest faster than a bullet. How could he be so stupid as to think that Cas was spending his time with him for any reason other than
He’s not unaware of the fact that his host never gave his name, but he supposes he’ll not be needing it anyhow as ‘Sir’ seems to be acceptable.
Castiel pauses and frowns. He is disappointed at Dean’s words, but more than that, Dean’s behaviour seems different than what he has known. Castiel can’t figure out why, but for a brief moment, he feels panic rush cold through his blood and is certain that Dean knows about last night. Almost as immediately as it came on, it abides; there was no way for Dean to know about his conversation with his father, and it would perjure himself greatly to ask Dean if there was something wrong, or even specifically ask him if he’d overheard something. He figures that Dean must just be having an off day.
He’s quietly proud of the progress he’s made, never one to boast about his achievements, but he can tell that Charles is impressed. It makes something sour churn in his chest but he can’t help but be proud that he’s proving Charles’ assumptions about him wrong.
He’s still looking at the windows—the debate continuing in his mind though he knows he won’t open them regardless—when Cas comes up behind him. His middle is gathered up in Cas’ arms and something cool touches his forearm as he drops his head back to make room for Cas, who is currently kissing and mouthing his way along the cords of Dean’s neck.
Precome blurts from his slit and he can’t remember how to breathe as Cas picks it up on his finger and brings it to his own mouth, groaning at the taste of him on his tongue. Dean can’t imagine he’ll last long if he doesn't pick up the pace.
Cas’ eyes catch his own and holds them as he brings the flask up to his lips and he feels that tug again low in his belly as Cas tips his head back, not breaking their eye contact, and takes a slow sip, his throat working over the burning liquor, the way Cas is looking at him, the way he is making a show of the shared flask makes him think that it might not be the whiskey he’s trying to savour.
“Yeah. I mean we don’t have the best track record with cosmic beings but if the empty wants that so badly and we can give it, it. I can’t see how that's a bad thing.”
How was he already forgetting all of the little things that made him fall for the fallen angel, heaven's most loved, heaven's most corrupted.
“No need,” he says tersely, as he swings himself up onto the saddle, gloved hands gripping the choke and then the reins as he settles into the dip of the leather. “I’ll be fine on my own, Sir.” Dean barely waits a second before he’s kicking Remy’s flank and riding off to the fence line leaving Castiel stunned where he stands.
A part of him has shut down in the wake of the incident and everything he does seems to be mechanical, as though he’s separated from his body, going through the motions but not actually doing them.
After that ordeal it had stopped being too much of a trouble, it twinged when he would put weight on it and it felt better when he raised it up at night when he slept.
Any gentleness that lingered between them disappears with that noise, Dean’s fingers grip almost painfully into his hair at the back of his head as his other arm comes up to loop around his neck, drawing him in closer. He bites at Castiel’s lips when they open for him and that seems to be what causes Castiel to break. He slots his legs with Dean’s as his tongue works its way into his mouth.
As Castiel hollows his cheeks and swallows around the thick intrusion he abandons his cock to reach below his bobbing head and palm at Dean’s balls. Dean’s hips jerk forward at the touch and his cock hits the back of Castiel’s throat but he doesn't stop. Dean’s muscles start to tense around him and he knows the man must be close. Keeping Dean’s sack in his palm, Castiel reaches back and brushes a finger lightly against his perineum. Dean jerks forward again as his hips begin to stutter in their rhythm and Castiel presses a knuckle firmly against the same spot.
His musings carry him up the few steps and into the house, Cas still tucked in against him, now with his arm lifted around Dean’s shoulders. Cas heads into the kitchen as Dean lights a few of the sconces and lanterns to see by.
“What? C’mon Cas it's a bit of blood, I've been dealt worse before. If your ma’s got a bit of wrap I’ll be fine.” It's a lot harder to convince Cas considering he's walking with a limp now that he’s noticed the cut.
As more children arrive at breakfast the volume rises in the house, and he starts to mentally catalogue what he knows he’ll miss when he walks out the door for the last time. Anna’s smile while her mouth is still full of porridge. The way Balthazar slowly wakes up and begins to talk animatedly to Uriel. How Anael manages to sneak in bites of her own food with the chaos of a full table.
Being around Cas is easy, they jibe and banter and Dean doesn't have to bite his tongue to avoid offending by mistake because Cas is familiar with his sense of humour.
“And you’re heading west,” Cas says. It’s both a question and a statement as though he knows but needs confirmation.
“I guess you could say that ya, why, did you? In your happy go lucky world of unions and appreciation for the hell you go through.”
“I just wanted to make sure that when Michael and all of them get back, that you won’t forget to spend time with me,” Hannah says looking down at her twisting fingers.
“I’m having a hard time this time because a part of me thinks just like it did after the whole leviathan fiasco. I swear you’re going to come back, that this is all a mix-up, that if I wait just a little longer, hold on a little longer, put my gun down just one more night that you’ll be back. But it’s been weeks Cas and nothing’s changed. I wake up and I go to sleep in a world that doesn’t have you in it and I was always okay before because you were just there even if I didn’t have you like I wanted I still got to see you, watch you, lo—be with you. But now it’s all empty, and no matter how ironically appropriate that is given the dumbass move you made a year and a half ago, I’m hanging on by a thread man. And Sam doesn't know how to help, even with all his dead girlfriends as experience to draw from.” He’s quiet for a long time, chewing on his lip, flexing his fingers together as he just sits.
He would admonish himself for the thought had it not been one he had already done so for. By now he knew it wasn’t a thought he had control over, it would spring forth from the deep recesses of his mind at inopportune times, often with little warning or reason and if most thoughts leave as a whisper, this one stays like a bad cough.
He waits for Cas to come back in the silence of the evening, thinks of how lucky he was stumbling into that farm, making friends with their son, starting over without knowing he was doing so.
He remembers the malicious smile on Chuck's face that night, as he’d begged for Cas to be brought back even if it meant he died. How he told them that this was their new story. That he didn't care for Cain and Abel anymore. He just wants them to suffer, slowly, alone more and more every day.
He grumbles lowly, Cas is just too green, a curious man with a new subject, he doesn’t care for the answers he gets, he doesn’t seem to know to share the information around and harm his already damaged reputation. That same feeling from the first night settles in him again, he wants to be known by someone, his trust in the man comes back as unfounded as before but just as strong. And just as it had, it scares him, but he ignores his better judgement.
“You working for one of the farms ‘round here?” she questions. Dean can see her take in all the damage to his face but she makes no comment, she doesn't even react.
“Now that that's done, will you let me give my little brother a hug to cement this momentous occasion in his life, or are you going to work yourself into a frenzy all over again?”
“Never Hannah, in fact I think you’ll be spending so much time with them that you won’t even have time to see me at all, but I’ll still show up just so you can kick me out.” He sits down on the side of her bed. “I'm betting that Gabriel is going to try to convince you to let him and Kali sleep in here because you’ve always been his favourite.”
The next day turns his already busy home into a madhouse, there hadn’t ever been a time in which this many people descended upon its four walls at once, and never had all of the children been home at the same time, as the eldest three had moved out before Alfie was born.
“And are you here to tell me to disappear in the night and to never to show my face again on your land?” Dean asks, resigned but challenging, he doesn't want the response to be a yes but he knows that he has no place in which to bargain from. It would either be, leave and never speak of this again or, at worst, ruin whatever shreds of a reputation he still has.
,” Dean says as he rocks down further onto the thick finger. His eyes fall shut as Cas starts to pump it up into him, moaning as it stretches him, the slight pain a welcome sensation.
It had bothered him for days, as he learned what Cas looked like in his different emotions, how happiness tilted his neck back and screwed his eyes shut, how worry brought his brows close together and his jaw clench, how frustration—aimed at him—caused a smile to breach his lips and his eyes to roll as they partially hardened with resolve.
Understanding, Cas thinks for a moment. “I was nine I think, we were in town and my parents had entered some store or another but I didn’t follow them in, content to wander. I trekked around and eventually found my way to an alley, buildings on either side of me, a verifiable maze, really, and I came upon a couple in an open doorway. Standing as if at a moment's notice they might need to break apart and flee. When I got closer, I understood a bit more. They were both men, and though my mind may forget, they couldn’t have been any older than I am now. They were kissing as any man and woman would. It was the first time I understood that I wasn’t the only one who felt the way I felt, the way I feel. That there were others, at the very least there were the two in front of me. They didn’t ever see me. I just walked back to the street and waited for my family to return, but something within me settled at the sight of them.” Cas is looking off above his shoulder when he finishes, lost in the memory.
By some saving grace, his mother is far too involved with his siblings' return to bring up any woman she’s heard is single. It excites him for the days ahead, knowing with more certainty that his siblings would draw the attention away from him.
“Gabriel says that he hopes to visit again soon, and that ah! Kali is pregnant again and they want to get the travelling done before she gets too late into the pregnancy because and I quote, ‘as much as she loved seeing all of you, she was about ready to kill me by the time we returned home’. He’s going to be picking up Hannah and Uriel and whoever else wants to come along too. I can only imagine what their journey will be like,” Cas says with a laugh.
They still sit so close together it makes Dean's skin thrum, Cas still leans in and puts his lips behind Dean’s ear to whisper words that don’t need to be spoken loudly. Uses his skin as a confessional and pours his sins out against him, letting him bathe in all that Cas is. They still end up tangled around each other, chests heaving and skin covered in a thin sheen of sweat.
Cas moves them, sliding an arm around Dean’s waist and turning Dean around in his arms. He ends up on his forearms and knees and has a brief thought that Cas may try to take him before Cas’ hand reaches around and begins to stroke him again. At the same time, he feels Castiel’s other hand press below the swell of his ass. Instinctively he presses his thighs together. But Cas soothes him with the hand, running it along his flank while shushing him.
“Castiel could you do me a favour and check the page? I don't doubt your understanding, Dean. But as witness, Castiel needs to be part of each step to sign in good faith.” Jody speaks up, still looking at him.
The farm is quiet, its occupants asleep as they should be. The ground cools and the trees sway in the night’s breeze. Dean sleeps soundly, it’s new for him to be able to do that.
The day Cas’ family left, save for Gabriel and his wife, was the first day in more than a week that they had spent mostly together. Dean wasn’t sure that night if the decrease in work completed would be noticed by Cas’ father, he also wasn’t sure if the reddened lips of his son’s mouth and stubble raw chin would go unnoticed.
“You aren’t the first person to threaten me Gabriel, and while I know you fully intend to make good on your words, you are also much less intimidating than some of the people who’ve uttered those other threats,” he says as they both stand, brushing the dirt from their pants.
Dean and Sam get slammed across the room. Pain spreads through his side when he lands on the floor in a heap. At least that's more on par for how their lives used to be and hey what's another bruise or two.
“Unfortunately it seems that I haven't learned much from past experiences, I should probably work on that huh?” Dean says in a clipped tone, both from anger and pain.
All direct plot content from the post ends in this chapter (though content from it continues, ie. the flask and the lack of name). The majority of the plot from here on out was concocted in a frenzied late-night text conversation with my friend, 70% of the plot was formulated in about an hour or so which is the fastest I've ever come up with a nearly complete story outline.
Dean never really expected to sleep, but he tossed and turned, pretending to himself that it might happen, all the while shooting fervent prayers Cas’s way in hope that he was listening. He felt dark enough inside that he didn’t want the lights out, so he left the TV on, silently playing an unending stream of infomercials for kitchen gadgets and exercise equipment. The glow was just blue enough to remind him of the light in Cas’s eyes when he used his grace.
“Uh, this is Sheriff Alden Roy from Pine Bluffs outside of Cheyenne. Just checking on Agent Worley.” Dean gripped the phone, that was Cas’s fake FBI name. So much for the universe giving him a break.
“Dean, it took me a little while, the writing is older than I’m used to reading. I have to say, I think Cas was right to be cautious.”
“I thought you were joining me?” Dean was disappointed, to be honest. He had been looking forward to the idea of Castiel sharing the shower with him.
This was the continual loop that played in Dean’s head. Whiskey might lower the volume, but nothing turned it off. Cas had walked out the door and left him. Didn’t matter that Dean hadn’t tried to stop him, hadn’t gone after him, hadn’t reached out. Cas was gone, he hadn’t cooled off and come back, hadn’t texted or called, hadn’t given Dean any indication of where he was going or when he would return –
Without any further ceremony, he took Dean deep into the heat of his mouth in one move. Dean’s knees buckled slightly with the intensity of it but he managed to keep his position. Castiel flattened his tongue along the bottom of his shaft and slowly pulled back, dragging it along his length. Stopping at the band of skin close to the tip, he licked and tickled the frenulum with his tongue until Dean was desperately keeping himself from squirming, and then he circled his cock head to tease him a bit more.
“Well, that’s just fucking fantastic guys. I can’t wait. Sometime in the next 40 years or so I get to lose you both at once. Awesome.”
“So, while the sigil worked, the cost was the rest of your grace and now you and Dean are bound as two humans?”
I tried to be as accurate as I could here.  I did some online research on alcohol withdrawal and spoke with both a friend who had gone through it personally as well as another who is a health care professional that treats hospital inpatients with alcohol withdrawal fairly frequently.  Then I cross-referenced all of that with how I think Dean, Cas, and Sam would have navigated it.
“Hold your temper, people are watching.” He kissed the shell of Dean’s ear and whispered again. “Now look at me and smile. Then, I want you to kiss me back.”
Finally, at about 4:00 am when Dean started to become disoriented and his hands started shaking ever so slightly – he had called Sam for back-up.  Sam got on the road immediately, and within the hour, before the sun had even considered rising, the three of them were on the way to the nearest hospital with an open emergency department.  Sam drove while Cas sat in the back with Dean, and they made record time.
Something that looked like hurt or insecurity passed across Cas’ face. Dean’s heart hitched a little at the sight; it gave him hope that his feelings were maybe reciprocated.
Dean didn’t answer, he just watched out the window. It was almost 11:00 pm, things had gone more smoothly than they could have, much more smoothly.  Trees zipped past his view, alternating with the occasional house. There were also a good number of farms, clearly, they were in an agricultural belt of some sort.
“Dean, do you promise to do your best to do right by Cas for as long as you’re together? Are you going to be loyal and trustworthy, and give Cas the opportunity to be the same?”
“Zu Ihrem und dem Vorteil Ihres Mannes, dessen bin ich mir sicher. Ich werde ein Auge auf Sie beide gerichtet haben, dessen können Sie gewiss sein. Ich schätze, Sie werden Washington im Sturm einnehmen.”
He took a little extra time in the kitchen trying to figure out what to do next. He had seen glimpses of ‘James’ when Cas had asked for the monogamy clause in their agreement, and again when he’d gone all protective with Bobby. The rest of the day, he’d spent with someone he didn’t know, and his next order of business should be finding out how the two facets of the same man fit together. Because make no mistake, he wanted to know Cas. If Cas could make him feel the way ‘James’ did, he wanted it very much.
He got out of the car and left his gear behind, in the back of his mind he wondered if Cas had sent him on an unfinished hunt or something.  But that didn’t make sense.  Nonetheless, he made sure his gun was tucked behind him where he could grab it quickly, and instinctively patted where he’d find his knife.  He might be a retired hunter but he didn’t plan on ever being a careless retired hunter. Everything looked fine, but he circled the perimeter anyway, looking for signs of pretty much anything.  There was nothing out of the ordinary.  He came back round to stand by baby and looked at the cabin itself again.
“No, Dean. I wasn’t. I was going to leave and had every intention of you never having to see or think of me again.” He looked down at the hands that were still intertwined but resting on his lap now. “The accident really was an accident. An animal jumped out onto the road while I was driving and when I swerved to avoid hitting it, the truck ended up in the ditch. I hit my head, there was blood, but my grace easily healed the injury. Then I heard your prayer and just wanted to get back to you, but the truck was too damaged. I walked until I found the phone booth and called you, but I was in a rural area and it took a very long time. There aren’t as many phone booths as there used to be.”
There was nothing else in the side table and he headed towards the dresser next, blue tie haphazardly strew across the top.  Checking all three drawers it was mostly empty, save for a few clothing items.  Socks, boxers – again with the bees, and a couple of plain t-shirts. All in, it wasn’t very much to show for a lifespan that had stretched millennia and more importantly had ended up being the love of his god damned life.  Dean felt guilty about the fact that the only thing he’d ever given Cas to show he cared was an old cassette tape, he could have done a whole hell of a lot better if he hadn’t been such a chicken shit.
“You know Dean, my assignment was to return you from hell and watch over you.  And that is what I have done for all of these years, long after I fell.  I did my best to keep you, to keep Sam, safe and alive for as long as I could, even dying for you-more than once.  My work is completed. There are no more battles to fight and you no longer need my protection. Good-bye Dean.”
And with that, the fight left him. He’d said it, it was out, and he’d probably be feeling free if it weren’t for the fear and longing for Cas that was gripping him. Nonetheless, there was nothing more he could do, Cas was nowhere to be seen. His best option was to go back to the motel and wait. Maybe he’d come back. Maybe.
“Yeah, I did. It’s just easier to deflect. I heard you though, I promise -  if I need to talk, I’ll come to you.”
“Dean literally does not want to live without you Cas, I am so scared that I’m going to lose him if you leave again.”
Without saying a word, Sam took the carafe,  poured Cas a coffee and then topped up his own.  Almost deliberately slow he added a bit of cream and stirred thoughtfully.  Castiel did the same thing, not even bothering to try to make small talk, he kept his eyes averted from Sam as well.  Everything about his body language indicated both defeat, and an expectation that he was going to be on the receiving end of whatever was coming next.  A little bit of Sam’s ire dispersed, this was going to be a conversation that impacted all three of their futures and Sam didn’t want to make whatever this was, worse.
They talked until they had a solid plan for the next few days and both were feeling a little hungry. Dean whipped up a quick mac and cheese casserole and Cas did his part by picking through Dean’s meager offerings of vegetables and coming up with a side dish. They worked companionably and found a flow to share the small place more easily than either would have expected.
Still smiling and staring, neither moved. Wrapped up in the moment, neither noticed when the room went quiet again.  It was Sam who finally broke the silence.
“This has been a real treat, Naomi. If you were here I’d say don’t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out, since you’re not, I’ll just tell you to lose Cas’ number and leave him the hell alone.” He hit the end call button and shoved the phone back across the table where Cas didn’t have to look at it.
He wasn’t fine, but it had nothing to do with the candy and everything to do with the gnawing pit in his gut every time he thought about Cas. The bastard still hadn’t called. If Dean ate a poisoned candy and died, it would serve him right for walking out on him. Of course, he knew better, he just didn’t care. The apocalypse was over, Chuck was gone, and Cas had left him. He was just biding time before he got killed in a hunt anyway. If he died choking on some random piece of candy, so be it. He popped another one in his mouth and shot Sam a cocky grin, “You're just mad because I don't plan on saving you any.”
“Взаимно, очень приятно встретить кого-то столь осведомленного. Вынужден признаться, наблюдал за вашим именем в новостях - очевидно, пресса не отдает вам должного. Примите мои искренние поздравления по поводу свадьбы.”
Castiel unravels and shows Dean the original. "I've studied that photo more times than I can count because you treasure it so much. Since love is such a gift, I wanted you to keep those whom you hold so dear close by."
Out of nowhere, a large black SUV ran up onto the sidewalk bisecting the entire width and separating Castiel from the two runners that had followed him. He turned to watch as the passenger window slid down to reveal a young man with light brown hair. He was holding a gun and it was clearly aimed at the man standing beside the panel van.
Cas finished speaking and the German ambassador shook Dean’s hand. He might be the congressman, but in this situation, he was more than happy to let Cas lead the way. Dean was beyond impressed.
“I have a few boxes in the car, let me go get them.” He slipped the letter into his inside jacket pocket and headed out to the car.
*A: Thank you. I was very surprised to see you in the papers this week. It’s not like you to be so public with your business. I don’t believe what they’re saying about you being a prostitute, but I will say that you and your new husband make a formidable couple. Should quell the rumors and turn DC on its head. Good for you.
Why was everything so hard? None of this was going the way he wanted. Frustrated and afraid he was running out of time, he tried to make it clearer.
While he was waiting for her to justify the intrusion, he rolled out of bed and made his way to the door of his condo to deal with whoever it was that had decided to disrupt him in person.
Cas went to the cupboard and grabbed two glasses.  Filling them with ice from the freezer and then water.  Beer would go down better, but Cas had recently asked Dean to drink less. Dean had agreed, he knew he’d been skating the edge to developing a serious problem over the past few years, and having Cas for a husband was more than enough motivation to pull back.  Easiest decision he’d ever made, anything for Cas.
The back road finally snaked around to the bunker’s garage entry, and Cas was relieved to see that the impala was still there.  At least he’s not drinking and driving.  He grabbed the pie and locked everything up before heading into the bunker itself.  Same slightly stale air and whirring of old mechanical systems in the background.  He didn’t see or hear Dean right away, and that was kind of a good thing.  There were a few things he wanted to do first, to set the stage as it were.
“Okay, Dean.” Sam swallowed nervously. “I’ve noticed that you’ve been eating from my shelf this week, and using my shampoo and shower gel. I smell it on you, man. And uh, then there’s whatever is going on with the duffle. All I gotta do is say C…” Dean cut him off before Sam could finish it and send him back to his room to check the bag again.
“Love you too, ya idjit.” Then he turned to Cas and looked at him with begrudging respect. “You got balls, I’ll give ya that. Time will tell if you’ve got the character to match, but so far it looks promising.”
Know that the sasquatch wasn’t going to bend, he read the note out loud to bring him up to speed. When he was done, Sam spoke a little more softly. “Dean, it sounds like Cas didn’t really want us to do this. I think we should figure out what those risks and consequences are first.”
The French conversation provides the translated words only, I ran out of character space. Thanks for understanding.
“You can tell me, or I will head that way anyway and check every reservoir on the map until I find it. But I’m going.”
“It won’t be fine, this isn’t my world, these aren’t my people. I’m going to fuck things up worse. I can do midwest politics and fundraising BBQs. I was stupid to think that I could come here and play politics in DC.” Dean’s stomach churned, was it too late to back out? Maybe if he called Charlie…
“I was right, you are delicious in every way, and you held position perfectly. I just know that you’re going to be my beautiful boy. So very good for me.” Dean felt like he was going to burst under all of the praise, even with his body aching for completion.”You deserve a reward, and I’m going to give it to you. Do you want to come by my mouth, or by my hand? You may choose.”
Castiel hadn’t asked that as a question, he’d asked enough already. His little compatibility test seemed to have shifted into something more, but that was just fine with him. He reached for his phone, using one app to dim the lights down, and then another to start an ASMR playlist of light rain and wind. Not too loud, just enough to block out all other distractions save for their voices. Closing his phone and putting it down, he drew the plate and glass over. He started with a slice of green apple in his left hand.
Putting the bottle down, Cas met Dean where he stood and took the pizza box from his hands, leaning in for an affectionate kiss on the way by. Placing the pizza box directly on the table next to the plates he turned to look at his husband. “I’ve been reminded that you do so much for everyone else, without asking for anything in return.  I thought maybe I could spoil you tonight.”
Thankfully – thankfully Cas had insisted that they accept him as Dean’s partner the day before because once they got to the reception desk in emergency Cas had simply owned the role.  No questions asked by staff and poor Sam was the one left in the waiting room initially and doing coffee runs when Cas absolutely refused to leave Dean’s side or let go of his hand.
Cas had asked Dean for full autonomy over their bedroom. From paint color to curtains to furniture, he wanted to select and do everything himself.  Outside of a request for memory foam, Dean let him do his thing, going so far as to give him money in a separate account so he couldn’t see what or where he was spending it.
“Green means everything is good, yellow means that things are good but intense, Red means I’ve hit my limit and want you to pull back.”
And behind said reticence, Castiel also recognizes a youthful spark, some precious delight Dean takes in opening a surprise meant only for him. For indeed, the gift is a lovingly crafted surprise. The anticipation for the reveal mounts within him.
Touche. He couldn’t argue with that. Cas didn’t know all of his secrets, it made sense that the man was a little nervous about sharing some of his own. Cas didn’t have to save his life in Budapest, or Lisbon for that matter. He didn’t have to do it again today, and he certainly didn’t have to do it with a new identity and backstory at the ready.  He owed Cas his life several times over. The Russian was his friend, the only one he’s had since getting recruited twenty years ago.  Yesterday, this morning even, he had no one to give a shit about, and no one who gave a shit about him. And now? Now he had Cas.  Why wouldn’t he stay?
Stepping into the alley, it was easy to spot the younger Dean.  He was poking through the restaurant’s garbage, presumably for food that had been thrown away.  Cas saw him pick out a half-eaten hamburger and bring it back to an old milk crate where he sat down and ate it.  In all the years they had known each other, and in all the conversations he had had with Dean from his own timeline, he had never mentioned having to go through garbage to find food.  Cas hadn’t thought it possible, but his heart broke yet again over the neglectful upbringing of Sam and Dean Winchester.
Sam didn’t say a word, he didn’t even look Dean’s way. He focused forward and only watched Dean surreptitiously through his peripheral vision, wondering if Dean would comment on the music or acknowledge why he chose it in the first place. If Dean was aware that anything was out of place, he didn’t say. He did, however, tap his fingers on the steering wheel in time with the music and went so far as to sing along under his breath. Very interesting indeed. This went on for a good while down the highway until Dean seemed to realize something was off.
Cas stepped aside just far enough to open the door. Dean watched him, slack-jawed and speechless. What was even happening right now?
“Left it for me? More like cursed it, right, Sam? I mean, let’s tell it like it is. She cursed the candy, I ate it, now I’m cursed. Does that about cover it?” Crossing his arms, Dean waited expectantly for Sam to be more forthcoming. When he wasn’t, he pressed on. “What’s the catch? Can you lift it? Surely you found something in those books.”
The first thing he notices is the warding. Discrete to be sure, but thorough.  Cas, (he assumed it was Cas), had made this place as secure as the bunker.  Nothing supernatural would get in and it explained why the building didn’t show up on the maps or satellite imagery. It was well and truly hidden.  Not for the first time, he wonders again exactly what the angel had been doing.
Pushing himself up and off the floor, Dean wondered what the hell had just happened.  It felt like he’d been hit by a train. Everything hurt like hell, so much so he wondered if he was going to pass out from it.
“The hit on me is not only because I disobeyed orders. I refused to kill you and then neutralized the agent they sent in my stead, that was enough to sign my own death warrant. Since I had nothing to lose, I defected.”
“Not gonna lie, dudes. That was pretty hot. No one’s going to believe that wasn’t real.” She started heading back to her workspace. “I’m going to go and put the final release together. Sam? Can you take care of lunch when it arrives?”
That was a fair question, and it wasn’t often that Dean asked personal ones, so Sam welcomed the chance to have a little heart to heart. Maybe he could turn it around, back on Dean and Cas.
And if that doesn't have a stone dropping in his stomach. Not only because Jack blames himself but ‘
“No way!” she says excitedly before her face falls. “Castiel says there's no such thing as dragons.”
Cas sweeps his hands up to his shoulders and draws him in again. They are slower this time, just intense as before, but slower.
Through a half-formed sob Cas says, “Sweet dreams Hannah.” before he leaves the room. His shoulders tense once he's past the threshold and Dean can tell he’s trying not to turn back. His hand grips tightly onto the door frame before he moves away from it, disappearing from Dean’s sight.
A countdown plays in their heads and ours, the final moments aren’t the same but they hurt regardless. One year until an empty grave is adorned with a headstone the location of the ashes of who should be found there are lost still. Less than that until a ring is to be slipped onto a finger, a death sentence as much as the grave.
Kids are meant to play, they are meant to get roughed up now and again, having their siblings make them better isn't their job. Ma’s and Pa’s should be kissin’ knees and making their kids apologize not forcing them into facing the unseemliness of an injury. There's a reason you tell a child to look away from the cut or what have you, they are nowhere near old enough to handle that.
“I have half a mind to be offended but seeing how our statures compare—” he passes a critical eye along Dean’s taller form, “—I’m understanding a bit better,” Gabriel says as he sticks out his hand.
Blind determination drives him forward. Keeps him going when sleep begs to be had with every blink of his eyes. His stomach aches with no food yet churns and threatens to empty itself when fed.
Dean takes a deep breath and continues, “a part of you stays in each place you settle, the life—however insignificant—you made for yourself will always leave remnants. And at some point, you’ll see that you’ve left behind a graveyard of whispers of yourself… It's a comfort and a curse. It’s odd to know that you stay in each place but that it’s never really you there. It takes years to learn not to look back. Hell, even with all my practice I still wanted to, still want to. To catch that last glimpse, to see the memories played out in the swirls of dust that kick up and settle, you can’t ever move forward if you are forever looking back, not in any way that matters really. You don’t walk a horse backwards to get where you are going and all that. But at some point, you’ll find that what's ahead might be better than what's behind, and that’ll be enough to make it worth it. Or at least I hope it will,” he says in all truth.
A feeling spreads itself wide in Dean’s chest, stretching itself into every corner, taking up all the space it can until it's the only thing he can feel. Yet he can’t name it. The fact that Cas is prepared to leave this place should make him proud. Hell, it does make him proud because it means that Cas is going to go after what he wants, especially if he chooses to believe that Cas isn’t going to succumb to what his ma wants. Either way he’s prepared to move on, but it hurts beyond comprehension that he doesn’t want to move on with Dean. That he’s content to learn from Dean how to leave behind all he’s ever known but that he in no way wants to do so in order to stay with him.
He and Winchester rush their chores, making sure that enough gets done that they aren’t piling on work for themselves for the next day. The foal takes some work, they need to walk him out and check his shoes on top of their training. They attempt to get him used to tacking but it’s such slow progress that they vow to dedicate more time to him later on.
Dean doesn’t say anything, he just slowly crawls towards Cas. Cas for his part turns more towards him and moves his arms, leaving a space for Dean to occupy once he’s reached Cas’ torso.
He hums lowly, nodding his assent at the dirt. The feeling of exposure squirms along his skin, he doesn't want Cas to come at him with sympathy and a gentle voice, he hates it, always has, when he’s treated like glass, on the cusp of breaking at all times. It rarely matters that they mean well, the second you get treated with soft voices is the second a target is put on your back. There is no difference between showing weakness and having those around you treat you as though they think you need help. At least there is no difference to those who would gladly take on a man they deemed easy pickings.
“No doubt the boy’s got potential with horses, but ever since that first day when he told me that he didn't have a name, I knew he couldn’t stay long. I mean who knows the past he’s had, who he’s made bad with, I don't trust people like that, all they spell is trouble.” Castiel is seeing red but his father continues. “I was ready to have him leave after his screw up with Ringer, but then he started on the beast and I figured he had some uses. Now though? Ringer is done and so is he.”
The woman approaches the fence line, Dean piles his reins onto the top of Ringer's saddle and strides over to where she is standing.
It’s quiet around the farm. That kind of quiet that makes him feel out of place for making even the smallest of noises, as though the night is upset with him for disturbing the all-encompassing silence. Moonlight bathes the paths of packed earth in shades of blue and it only adds to the serenity.
“Nor can I,” Cas laughs, he’s moving slowly, drawn in by the calm haze they’ve made for themselves or maybe because he doesn't want to leave.
Instead he says, “I came from a way’s over, felt it time to move on.” around a mouthful of food. His company has a kind smile and way about him that he enjoys a lot after nearly two days of travelling alone.
“My Castiel was killed years ago while we attempted to stop a massive world-ending apocalypse-like threat, I guess Chuck was too busy with you and your world to bother to check-in and save him.” the other Dean said bitterly, and Dean had to take a minute to be weirdly grateful that Chuck loved this world so much that Dean got Cas back and again and again when other Dean had spent years without his angel. “You have a fucking chance to have what we both know you’ve always wanted and you're blowing it because of what? Angsty repression that we both know ran out of fuel almost a decade ago?
“Yes, but it’s not fair to burden you with it, I’ve been doing so since your arrival here and I’d like to think that we’ve become true friends, it’s not right to constantly complain about this to a friend.”
He can feel his mother's eyes searching for him, in the rippling sensation that makes its home on the back of his neck and causes a shiver to descend his back despite the heat. He wants to turn around, to shoo her away and leave them to spend this time alone properly but that would raise too much suspicion on what they are doing, on his motives behind this time alone with a man that captured and monopolized his empty hours and filled them with pretenses of a timeline in which circumstance were not what they are, one where he could be open with him and the thoughts that have consumed him since he first saw him, could live and flourish within a sanctity that’s impossible for them to ever have.
He can't see Anna’s toy anywhere; he even goes so far as to check in the dirt and sparse flowers that line the raised porch. Gabriel shouts at him through an open window while his head is stuck far closer to a bush than he would have liked, given the gentle wind that's picked up—the last thing anyone needs is him ending up with a stick in his eye—but he ignores his brother, raising his arm into the air and making a ‘go away’ gesture with it.
“Everything looks set Jody,” Castiel calls back, he steps away making more than enough room for her to stand beside Dean.
“He said that happiness wasn’t in the having, it was just being, just saying it and so he told me—he said he—” his throat burns again. Telling someone else somehow makes it all so real, makes it all the more painful and he just can't force the words out.
Everything makes him ready to strike. Every muscle in his body is tensed and prepared to fight if the need arises.
The rest of the afternoon moves on trend with the day, each time he spares a glance to a clock he sighs. The hours tick by slowly until finally, it’s time for supper.
Handing Cas the flask he ensures his distance from him, not trusting himself to keep his decorum if he gets too close to. It almost seems intentional, though he doesn't know on whose part, that their fingers brush against each other and he has to suppress a shudder at the feeling that hits him. He’s never been struck by lightning but he reckons it must feel a bit like this. He drops his hand once Cas has the flask trying to shake out the lingering feeling of Cas’ skin against his, trying to forget the roughness of his farm worn fingers and the warmth they held against his.
A few hours before supper he hears the clatter of the door, there’s a flutter in his chest and a curl of anticipation in his stomach as he turns. He stops though, because, yes Cas has come outside, but with him is a small hoard of children, Hannah’s amongst the group, holding the hand of another young girl, but he doesn’t know any of the other children. A young woman, who must be Cas’ eldest younger sister, is corralling the children along with him.
“It almost worked too, but no Dean when I fuck you for the first time it’s not going to be on the ground. I’m going to wait until I can have you in every way I’ve imagined since the first moment I laid my eyes on you.”
“In a heartbeat.” Cas said as he laid them both down on the mattress, instinctively he knew that Dean needed to be held, that more could happen later, but in that moment Dean needed the surety of Cas being there solid against his chest and so that was what he did. Being human sleep grabbed at him almost as soon as it had Dean and with a smile, Cas let himself fall into its grasp, warm, content, loved, safe, and above all else the happiest he’d ever been.
Dean doesn't look to the sky as his eyes fill again. Sam always said he needed to let himself feel. That ignoring your trauma isn't the same as dealing with it. But he worries that if he gives into it fully he’ll never resurface. Drowned in his own mind with the pain and regret, the fear and the sadness that washes in like the tide when his guard drops.
“Ca-s,” his voice breaks before he manages to speak the single syllable. No one is around to notice though, no matter how much he wishes he was speaking to a person instead of an unfeeling unrelenting piece of wood. Still though, it's easier to talk when no one is there to hear it, he doesn't have to hold as much back.
Dean nods. “So what do you suggest? Tell him a fake spell? Just make it up as we get closer to an actual answer we can use?”
He worries every second that it’s all Chuck's doing but always remembers, Cas never followed the plan, Jack was never supposed to be born, hell he was never even supposed to be good. Every action they have ever made with or for Cas was their own. And that includes this.
I wrote Cas' interactions with his siblings from a mix of personal and professional experiences. If it seems like Cas is acting more like a caretaker than a big brother when he's with his young siblings it's meant to.
The sun dips low, brushing against the horizon just as Cas’ fingers brush against his thigh, the same warmth fills him from both, the same awe fills him as he sits and takes it in.
“I almost lost you,” Dean says, his voice barely more than a whisper but still heavy with emotion. Cas shivers as it ghosts along his lips.
“Yes, yes Cas god I need you,” he says, rocking his ass back enthusiastically, trying to get Cas to go faster.
“Oh please call me Gabriel, 'Sir' is so stuffy and formal,” Gabriel says with a put upon shudder as he pulls a small candy from his pocket. He offers it to Dean but having never gathered a proclivity for sweets he declines. Gabriel gives a half-shrug before he unwraps the treat and tosses it quite impressively into the air and catches it in his open mouth.
The odd feeling doesn’t dissipate, it’s as though his body already regrets the choice he hasn't gone through with yet. Dean settles in for the night, turns out the lantern, and desperately tries to think of what he’ll put into the letter he wants to send Sam. The feeling gnaws at his heart, settles behind it so that with every beat it pains him. He hopes that signing the contract will make it go away, but a part of him knows it will do nothing of the kind.
There had been one day that stood out among the other that proved that perhaps Cas was reciprocating in all areas of Dean’s growing attraction. He’d been working, easy stuff really, but with his myriad of ailments it was difficult. He had been moving Remy’s tacking equipment after his first ride on her—Charles had wanted him to fix the fence posts and Remy was needed for that task—which had gone spectacularly and he was quite proud of himself for riding with only one good arm. But carrying the saddle with only one arm had proven to be more difficult than he’d originally thought.
He lets Cas lead him to one of the beds, lets him strip off Dean’s shirt helping on the right side because Cas can’t lift his shoulder high enough for that—they both chuckle a bit when his head gets stuck in his shirt thanks to the odd angle. He lets Cas kiss the bandaged wound on his arm, lets him kiss the bruises and cuts that litter his face.
Dean’s blood freezes in his veins slowly as Lucifer talks. Chuck is back on the board and he's using the weirdest pawn to enact his will. Lucifer and Chuck teaming up is odd enough but then the devil honest to god just calls his brother a ‘cuck’. That’s his life now, god he misses the days when he only had to deal with salt and burns.
The silence is stifling once the door to their room is closed. Dean is trying so hard to keep it together because he’s not sure if he’ll be able to stop if he lets it go.
Luckily Cas figures it out with him and rips his shirt over his head as he shoves Dean’s up and under his arms. Dean reaches up and threads his fingers into Cas’ hair pulling him down on top of him. The fluttering in his chest at the skin on skin contact is cut off as Cas mouths his way to Dean’s lips. He bites down on Cas’ bottom lip and seizes the opportunity to seal their lips together again, sliding their tongues together the first chance he gets. He gets lost in the kiss, lost in the noises he pulls out of Cas, gets drunk on the feeling.
The man's hair catches his eye because, for all his composure, his hair is a mess, strands group together, sticking up as though he rakes his fingers through it several times an hour. And he’s struck with the intense desire to do just that, to learn what it feels like, but he silences the thought.
On her first day back, she had asked Castiel about the new person. She hadn’t been able to before because she was on her way to the clinic. As soon as he began to talk about Dean, he felt himself begin to blush and smile, but he quickly schooled his expression and told her enough about the stranger to placate her without giving too much away. He knew how much Dean guarded his past and Castiel wasn’t about to betray his trust—even if he was the only one to know he had broken it—by telling his sister. No matter how much she begged with a pleading gaze.
“Dean, my brothers weren't wrong, they have never been wrong, you have always been my priority, losing you as often as I had, I fell in more ways than one since my time on earth started. I know that you technically know this now but I've been waiting too damn long to leave it at being said by the other you,” Cas nudged his shoulder and when he turned he saw that Cas had matching wetness in his eyes. “Dean, I love you, there's not a soul in any of the dimensions we've been in that could change that, there's nothing that could keep me from fighting my way back to you as hard as I could except for you sending me away, if this isn-” Dean couldn't even let him finish that thought, that terrible but so heartbreakingly common thought. He crashed his lips against Cas’ hot, persistent and hungry. Cas made a small noise of surprise that Dean knows he’ll replay until the day he dies.
Occurrences similar to the hand on his back was nearly commonplace by the time he was healed up, and as much as Dean savoured it, it was equally as maddening as he’d still never said a word on any of it. Not that Dean had either, but he figured that Cas held more power in their dynamic and therefore didn't want to endanger himself by acting on an impulse that only continued to grow.
“Hello there! It’s Kevin,” a voice calls from the front of the porch. Dean steps away from Cas and walks towards the man as he continues, “I’m here to take Ringer to the stables.”
No one younger than Castiel remembers Gadreel, Anael was nearing three when he died and Hannah still wouldn’t come along for another two years. But they all grew up in the wake of the loss, with the same parents who changed after his death, though none of them had the frame of reference to recognize the difference.
