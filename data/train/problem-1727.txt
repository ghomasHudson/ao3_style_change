In   the service lift, Sherlock pulled John in for deep kiss.  John felt   something vibrate against his hip.  "Your phone," he mumbled against   Sherlock's lips.  It was probably the casino manager or the head of   security calling about the case.
Then   Sherlock came whirling into the room, two garment bags slung over   his arm, fresh from another victory and with a spot at the final table.    They'd been invited to some kind of black-tie party by one of the   high-rollers that Sherlock had knocked out with a bluff earlier in the   tournament.  Also in attendance: a collection of highly sought-after   call girls, one of whom had been spotted with one of the suspected   players and who happened to be the girlfriend of a dealer in the   tournament.
Sherlock   must have known, or his skills of deduction hadn't been dulled by  lust,  because he shifted his mouth to the sensitive spot below John's  ear and  rumbled, "You've thought about this."
John   obediently held out one arm, then shifted his weight and offered the   other for Sherlock to unbutton.  Sherlock's fingertips skated over his   wrist, then up his forearm and back down.  He removed John's shirt and   vest, then guided John to lie on the bed with another light shove to his   chest.
"You've   lipstick on your chest," he said before he realized he'd opened  his  mouth.  It sounded more accusatory than a simple observation.
Sherlock   humphed, but John continued.  "Because you are.  You're a very pretty   man."  John gave him a smacking kiss on the lips, then pulled back and   smiled.  "You'd make a terrible girl though."
In   Afghanistan, they played for chips only because no one had much to   spare in the way of tiny luxuries and no one could be arsed to figure   out the exchange rates on paper currency.  Most patients were only there   long enough to be stabilized and shipped home or patched up and sent   back to their units, but there were always games going while soldiers   waited for transport.  John hadn't played in many of those games -- even   if the pots weren't for anything tangible, it had still felt wrong to  be  cleaning out a bunch of kids that could die any day.
Sherlock's calf flexed and John felt the tip of Sherlock's shoe tap the sole of his foot.  Through his own shoe.
He   leaned back against Sherlock's chest and craned his neck for another   kiss.  Sherlock's hand cradled his jaw, fingertips caressing the skin   below his ear.  When John's neck began to ache, he pivoted so that one   leg, bent at the knee, sat on the bed and his other foot rested on the   floor.  Sherlock sat back on his haunches and John chased him forward,   leaning on one hand planted on the bed next to Sherlock's knee.  He   rested the other on Sherlock's thigh, hot through the fine wool of his   trousers.
The   game was expected to last anywhere from twelve to seventeen hours,  with  breaks every three hours.  By the second break, Sherlock had  identified  the two cheaters and had systematically eliminated them by  calling one  on a bluff and forcing the other to go all-in with an  inferior hand.
John   hesitated.  Sherlock had already traced it back that far, there was no   sense in lying to him now.  He opened his mouth to contradict  Sherlock,  but didn't have the chance to say anything before Sherlock's  brow  furrowed and he resumed his pacing.
John   frowned.  He'd wanted Sherlock to win, even if he'd have been an   insufferable git for being proved right (in his own mind at least, John   had yet to be convinced that one could win by simply reading the other   players while disregarding the cards one held) and the prize money  would  have been forfeited back to the casino.  So much for luck.
"Why me, then?"  Sherlock asked with detached curiosity, but underneath was a thin thread of something else.
Some   of his most epic rows with Sherlock had been over the stupidity of   gambling.  It wasn't that Sherlock cared about the money John lost   (never more than he could afford, John had learned his lesson) -- it was a   matter of principal.  Sherlock thought it was all a matter of luck  and  that the only skill involved was reading and manipulating the other   players.  More than once, John had tried to explain odds and  strategies  associated with a number of possible hands, but Sherlock  didn't seem to  care about the maths.  From there it had always devolved  into the core  issue of Sherlock's imperiousness vs. John's right to do  as he pleased  when they weren't working a case, and had usually ended  with doors being  slammed and one of them leaving the flat for an  indeterminate period of  time.
John   grunted his assent as his hands bunched in the fabric of Sherlock's   shirt.  He pulled the smooth, fine cotton free from the back of   Sherlock's trousers, needing to get to more skin.  Sherlock nipped his   earlobe and asked, "How long?"
John   was sure he would spend a lot of time reviewing Sherlock's past   behaviour for any possible indicators of interest later.  "We're   idiots," John agreed.  He leaned forward and Sherlock met him halfway   for the kiss.
John,   always careful with his things, sat on the edge of the bed and untied   his shoes.  Sherlock knelt behind him, kissing the back of his neck and   running his hands over John's flanks.  John lined his shoes up   side-by-side, then peeled his socks off and stuffed them into the shoes   before sliding them under the bed.  He needed that little moment of   routine to ground himself.  John wondered why it didn't feel more   awkward, why he wasn't nervous or over-eager like he thought he should   be.
Betting   on races or football scores wasn't his thing.  Slots, dice games, and   roulette were all chance, no strategy and no challenge.  Blackjack was   decent, if you were into quick games.  But poker?  That was thrilling.    He'd played a bit of stud and draw with his mates in Uni, nickel-and-dime games (a term he'd only learned later), with vouchers for housework and girls' phone numbers finding   their way into the pot when things got interesting. It wasn't until he   was in Rwanda with Médecins Sans Frontières that he'd learned Texas  Hold  'em from one of the Americans in his camp.  They'd used the  contents of  care packages as stakes and, by the first month, John had  had a monopoly  on the camp's supply of gum and hand lotion.
Then   he'd met Sherlock and he'd found a better way to get his kicks.  He   still met up with Murray and a few of Murray's mates every now and then   for a friendly game, but his heart wasn't in it.  He usually ended up   walking away with his pockets a few pounds lighter, but a smile on his   face.
Sherlock's   playing style had thus far been fairly loose and aggressive, and   only seemed to get more so without knowing what the other players were   holding.  Even the commentators had noticed and began to bandy about the   phrase "dark horse" while making comparisons to a range of well-known   players in the world of poker, speculating that he would go far on the   pro tournament circuit if his performance tonight was anything to go by.    John found it quite amusing.
"No,   sure haven't."  John shifted himself upward so his body fit tighter to   Sherlock's.  He ran the tip of his tongue around the shell of  Sherlock's  ear, grating his teeth softly against the cartilage before  moving lower  to suck the lobe into his mouth.
Gameplay   resumed and, as predicted, the short stack was knocked out on the  first  hand.  The game progressed quickly from there, the third player  going  bust within half an hour.  It was down to Roylott and Sherlock.   Four  hands later, Sherlock was dealt another pair of pocket jacks on  the big  blind.  Roylott raised, holding the three and six of hearts.
"Had sex?  Yes.  Is that important?"  Sherlock's fingertips traced light circles on the skin of John's lower back.
"Stroke   of good luck, that," he said to the player next to him.  The way   Sherlock enunciated the final consonant of 'luck' and the slight pause   after the word was deliberately for John's benefit, he was sure.    Sherlock being an arrogant prick didn't dampen the exhilaration John   felt in that moment.  It was like the vicarious excitement he felt when   watching a rugby match on telly combined with that strange little bubble of   pride he felt when Sherlock laid out a string of deductions to Lestrade   while on a case.
Relatively   speaking, this incident didn't even make the top ten list of ways   Sherlock had affronted John's not-so-delicate sensibilities.  John   sat staring down into his vodka tonic and wondering, then, why he felt   like one giant, raw nerve.  Maybe the effects of Sherlock's constant   insults and denigration had finally had a cumulative effect.  That didn't seem likely to John, since he'd been brushing those things off   for well over a year now.  No, the issue was definitely centred on   Sherlock and sex.
John   woke up to an empty bed, the sheets still warm beside him.  He   scratched idly at his stomach and stretched, enjoying the slight burn in   his muscles.  The shower was running in the en suite.  He wondered if   it was too soon in the relationship to use the toilet while Sherlock  was  in the shower, then laughed because they'd already hit that point a   year ago.  He thought vaguely that he should be freaking out, but he   simply felt comfortable and content.
Sherlock grinned, then clambered over the bed to kiss John soundly.  "I told you, I was feeling lucky."
John went through a rapid series of emotions, from confusion to elation   to disappointment to embarrassment, finally settling on low-simmering   anger.  Sherlock had crossed a line yet again, purely for the sake of a   reaction and without regard to John's feelings.
John   refrained from lecturing him on the dangers of smoking while wearing   multiple patches (applied to his ribs so the other players couldn't see   them when he rolled up his sleeves), as he knew it was an argument that   couldn't be won.
By   the next break, the table was down to four players, with the short   stack sure to be knocked out in the first few hands after the game was   resumed.  Sherlock accepted a plastic cup of something from one of the   casino staff and bummed a cigarette from one of the other player's   girlfriends before sauntering up to John.
John laughed as he ground down against Sherlock's hip.  He bent down and claimed Sherlock's mouth again.
"Amazing,"   John said softly, shaking his head.  "But that other hand -- you had to   have known that you had almost no chance of winning?"
After   three folds on both blinds and a called bluff on a big hand, Sherlock   was the short stack.  He was so far down on chips that if he didn't win   something substantial back in the next few hands, he'd be eliminated.    On the very next hand, after a very intense round of betting, he went   all-in with pocket jacks before the flop was even laid down.  To say it   was a bold move was an understatement -- pocket jacks were arguably the   hardest hand to play.  Sherlock wasn't playing his cards though, he  was  playing the two men who hadn't folded their hands immediately.
Sherlock   looked at him full-on, presumably reading all he needed to know from   John's reaction.  Somehow, a wire must have got crossed because after a   few seconds, he blanked his expression and cleared his throat, looking   at a fixed point over John's shoulder.
Hunched   over the bar, shirt collar unbuttoned and bow-tie hanging loose around   his neck, John had a tiny epiphany.  At first he thought he'd  been  angry at the nature of Sherlock's presumption and the lengths he'd  go  to for a case.  He knew that Sherlock would have found a way out  of  it before anything went too far, but only after he'd got whatever   information he was looking for from the girl.  That wasn't the issue,   though.
Sherlock bounded into the room sometime the following morning with the name   of the valet that had transported the marked cards into and out of the   casino.  The only would-be criminals left to round up were the players   that were in on the scam.  Sherlock was sure that there weren't  more than three initially and that he'd knocked one out of the  game at  his own table the day before.  Out of the nine players set to  start at  the final table, six (not including Sherlock) were in the  habit of  wearing sunglasses.  Of those six, Sherlock had eliminated two  as  suspects based on opportunity and motive.
"So,   how long are you planning on staying in?  It might look a bit fishy if   you go all-in on a bad hand." John asked casually, trying to gauge   how much longer he'd have to sit there and act as Sherlock's cheering   section.
John   shrugged him off and closed himself in the bathroom.  Three drinks   wasn't enough to get John even close to drunk, but he hadn't   contradicted Sherlock.  He heard Sherlock lurking outside the bathroom   door before he turned on the water.  By the time he finished with   his shower, Sherlock had already left the room again.  John settled   in on his bed and stared at the ceiling until he fell asleep, resolutely not letting his eyes drift to Sherlock's rumpled   bedding.
"Wouldn't want your luck to run out, would we?" John said, then grimaced at how incredibly cheesy he sounded.
John downed the last of his drink and signalled for another as he   contemplated how he would talk his way out of any kind of real   discussion (the kind that involved awkward admissions and the rebuff   that was sure to follow) with Sherlock.  He'd most definitely shown his   hand, and in more ways than just the abstract I-don't-want-you-to-die   way that Sherlock had, and on more than one occasion.  Flouncing off and   having a strop over Sherlock's insensitivity was nothing new, but   when combined with all the other tiny clues over time, Sherlock had   surely figured it out by then.  John was convinced that it would   only be a matter of time before Sherlock's tolerance of his mooning   ended.  John nursed the fresh drink while thinking up all the ways   Sherlock would tell him that the interest wasn't mutual, ranging from   stumbling-but-tactful to being made homeless upon his return to London.
“Hmm,” Sherlock murmured, relaxing against John, head on John’s shoulder, a hand curved around John’s neck.
I harrumphed at how briefly he had abstained from interrupting.  “There were none in the room, but some may have been recently removed, or there could have been some late blooming shrub in the garden, near the windows.  Nothing I recognised in any case.  I’d considered the smell of certain types of wood when they are burnt, but the fire was coal.  The fragrance was gentle and very soothing.”  I shook my head.  “I’d forgotten that.”
I turned my attention from the raucous cock reluctantly.  Small or not, it seemed better to keep him in view.
“It’s like trimming hair,” Sherlock murmured.  “It’s being pulled up by the roots that they get cross about.”
“Ah, well, Henri will no doubt expand on that topic when we have supper with him after the concert.  You two share a tendency to romanticise mundane processes, like hearing a bit of a melody and using it to write a symphony.”
Sherlock opened it, pulled me inside and pulled my cloth over my head.  “Heat,” he repeated and strode to the bathroom.
John smiled down his chest at the furrowed brow and narrowed eyes visible above the swell of his cock.  “I told you, I’m very good with a blade.”
Although the cases had not yet been many, my having accompanied Sherlock when he had helped Lestrade with other
I looked lower.  I’d never heard him sing and yet the sound seemed to come from where he sat on Bert’s shoulders.
I sighed and leaned back, the crown of my head against Sherlock’s belly and followed the Lights’ dance.  “I should have realised.  I’ve always wanted to see these.”
“But he wasn’t able to prevent the execution?” I asked and immediately regretted it.  “Oh, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
The moth’s antennae brushed against John’s skin as though it had bowed.  It paraded down John’s finger, halted in his palm, lifted each of its front legs to its mouth in turn.
The next pot was silvery and covered with designs.  Its handle was also metal in the shape of a swan’s neck and head.  She tutted at it.  “We need to retrace the inscriptions on this one, they’ve nearly been polished away.  I haven’t used it in a while.”  She sighed and glanced at me.  “There’s so much to look after.”
“A bed’s better than a chair, but I shan’t be comfortable,” I complained.  The lack of a proper respite after our last case was beginning to make itself known.
The sun was not far above the horizon when we reached the low wall that marked the northern boundary of the cemetery.
I lifted the edge of the cloak.  A border had been begun in gold threads, a pattern of leaves and flowers, ivy and oak, wood sorrel and holly, foxglove and rose.
"Warm yourself by the fire, John," Sherlock said, reaching for the lantern.  "Listen for the cart coming round.  I'll check on Lestrade."  He clapped me on the back, nudging me in the direction of the open door and headed back the way we had come.
“When?” I said, sitting up.  “Before the house collapsed?  Was it a child crying in the house that Corvus heard?”
I did what he directed, saw him crouch and hook the spear on something above our heads in an arch wrought of bricks.  We slipped under and emerged on the other side into the night air.
They were dark, too, but a beam of sunlight pierced the haze above the courtyard and evaded the waving curtains to reveal an array of textures ranging from brocade to satin and silk, all in shades of green with glimmers of gold thread.  A cloud passed in front of the sun and they turned dark again in the shadows of the room.
"Yes," he grumbled.  "Do either of you have any pennies or tuppence?"  He rubbed his thighs vigorously for a minute before trying to stand again, with better effect.
“He flaunted customs, derided old habits,” Sherlock said, “except for that one.  He took a fancy to the idea that I was destined to be his.  When I expressed my disinclination, he said he’d wait, because we were the only two who weren’t boring and I would realise that eventually.”
I started from the top down with an efficiency I had learned in the treatment of chemical burns.  Top bared, I untied my shoes, retrieved a few items from my pockets, and shucked my trousers and pants in one go.
I tried to look, but there was only shadow, the heat of his tongue and the weight of him pressing me into the warm earth suffused with the scent of lavender.
“It’s made at a monastery in Italy from an ancient recipe.  Its claim to fame is that it has one hundred and fifty herbs and spices in it.”  She raised her cup to me.  “This has far more and the recipe is much, much older.”
There’s nothing like having a lover awake in one’s arms wanting more to bring the blood to all the right places.  I dropped the phone and reached for him.
The cut stung until he covered my mouth completely, tongue stroking the wound.  As he persisted, a great lethargy rolled over me and I closed my eyes.  It was not like the times with a syringe at all.
“One moment,” I said and had wiped the inside of my elbow with alcohol and inserted the needle in a matter of seconds.  I was not giving him diseased blood.  My blood flowed quickly into the vacutainer tube.  I ejected it from the needle and inserted it into a fresh syringe and pulled my sleeve down.
His shirt was clinging to his back.  He had clearly been at it for some time and it worried me because he doesn’t perspire much, unless he’s ill.
“She had a whole story brewing by the end of the evening, with Mr Wells being friends with someone from Chalfont Court and asking them to store the carton for him when he left.”
“You must be famished,” she declared, turning back to me.  She brought a plate of fruit and another of biscuits from the tray.  “This should tide you over until you’re ready to come down to the study.  You can have a proper breakfast there, unless you’d prefer luncheon.”
I felt cold.  I wiped the sweat from my forehead.  I pulled his bottom leg forward, walked to the far side of the bed and pulled the upper leg back.  My throat felt tight.
A minute later, John’s phone chirped.  Eyes still riveted upward, John fished his mobile out of his pocket.
“Let’s get rid of the carton and the papers before we have damp growing up the walls like 221C,” I suggested, snapping the bag open on my way back to the desk.
"Sit still.  It'll pass," he said and scooted forward along the floor.  "Molly," he said, picking a speculum off the floor and handing it to her.  "Have you met Dr Watson yet?"
My hands reached out for it without a thought.  They itched to mould themselves around its tiller, feel its weight-in-hand.  I hefted it.  It was for me.  I sighted along the bolt channel.  I had seen modern cross-bows used, but never shot one myself, and yet my hands knew this elegant ancestor of theirs.
of the same name.  (The screen looks blank at the beginning of the video, but that's how it's supposed to be for several seconds.)
I looked about the room.  There were long, cushioned seats running the length of the outer wall.  I wondered if they contained equipment as the bench in the music room had concealed the harp.
The silhouette of a figure wielding a long oar glided into view, halting when he was perfectly framed in the opening in the balustrade.  Another figure rose up from what must have been a barge, but was invisible from our vantage.  He mounted the stairs, bare-headed, his garments a fall of pewter about his form.  With measured steps, he crossed the terrace.
I pressed my lips together and turned towards the hearth.  I was moving further and further from recommended approaches to job interviews.  The log I had added to the fire cracked, flames shooting up between the halves.  It seemed fitting.
Culvert shook his head.  Bells jangled.  One fell off and clattered on the floor.  His eyes slid to it and back to Sherlock.
Directions in lab notebook for overseeing experiment in progress, enter findings at indicated intervals.  Expect to be back in two to three days.  Mrs Hudson can acquaint you with  more of the house in the meantime.  Make yourself at home.  SH
John emerged from the bathroom rubbing a towel across his chest.  It was not easy to dry off in a wet room that tiny.  He held the ends of the towel with both hands and dried his back.  He opened the wardrobe, bent down to pull a vest out of a drawer with one hand, running the towel over his damp hair with the other.
John pulled another desk chair next to Sherlock and sat down.  “No one would believe this film wasn’t tampered with.  And why is the subject blurry anyway.  I thought this was about the highest speed camera there is?”
“That’s what the French call the clubs.  The first time I saw green ones was at my grandparents’ house.  They had cards with beautiful pictures, like out of a storybook, but the second time was with Frank.  We’d only met the week before and he asked me to go to Monte Carlo with him.  Can you imagine?”  She glanced at me.
The door swung wide.  The last of the sun was pouring in the rear windows, gilding the furniture and reflecting off the lighter colours in the parts of the murals it reached.  John set the warm bag on the side table by the arm chair he favoured and opened one of the front windows.  The air was fresh from the day’s rain and milder than it had been in a week.  He hung up his green jacket, slipped off his shoes and retrieved a beer from the sideboard.  His domain might be small, but in it, all was well.
“I reminded myself that this was a performance by a skilled actress, who clearly could have walked the boards with success.  I concluded that some short-sighted theatre manager had overlooked her talents in favour of more comely aspirants, causing her to eschew the stage and turn her talents on smaller audiences in her back parlour."
“True, but he didn’t just swim to the side or start diving for pondweed; you’re concluding that he took off,” John said.
Holmes did not acknowledge my return, intent on some minute measurement of a fluid he was dropping into a simmering beaker.
“Everyone says that,” Mrs Hudson replied, from further down the hall, “but the manor house goes on to the corner and back to the parallel road behind us, so it isn’t surprising once you know that.”  She waved towards the stairs.  “Go on up, one flight.  The door to the study is open.  Make yourself at home.  Give the fire a poke if it’s got too low.  I’ll bring the tea in a few minutes.”  With that she was gone, another glass door swinging shut after her.
“It’ll be a surprise,” she said, stacking everything up on the tray and whisking it out the door much faster than I would have thought someone with a bad hip could have managed.  “Won’t be two ticks.”
“Do you know what you are, Doctor Watson?” he managed to ask between peals of laughter, his face contorted by the effort.  The colours of his cap were separated by rows of diamonds.  They sparkled as he threw his head back, the bells at the tips of his cap jingling in accompaniment.
I had copied a concise version of my notes into Sherlock's lab book and typed the rough text, complete with the many questions my observations had raised, into a document on my laptop.  A number of books and journals surrounded my seat at the same table where I had had lunch.  I had found most of the reference works I had needed in the library, books and journals on zoology and haematology and infectious diseases, and additional sources in the online databases whose passwords had been added to the lab book along with the directions.  Both had clearly been written in haste.  Despite the records of past results and the directions for the procedures to follow in his absence, there had been no explanation of the objectives of the research.  Their absence intrigued me.  It suggested that he had not expected to need to explain his purpose to anyone at this stage.  I began to entertain the flattering notion that the role of research assistant had been added to the job description during our interview.  I worked all the more assiduously because of it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I doubt it,” he grumbled, but he read Greg’s text and set the book aside.
I didn’t turn my eyes away and instead of the barely audible hum that I’d come to use, I sang it.  I’ve played the notes, whistled them, hummed them both loudly and quietly, but I have never given them full-throated voice.
The carthorse by the southern slope whickered as the side of its cart was lowered.  The two people who had accompanied the cart helped its elderly occupant down to the ground.
He handed off the torch and scampered after them, his freed hand on Midnight’s back to steady her on his shoulder, his other arm around the fallen oak's branches he had gathered.  He caught up with his brother and Wiggins just before all three were swallowed by the throng around an oak such as I have never seen.
His fingers were fast and once I was disrobed, he prowled around me with narrowed eyes, then he moved nearer and explored with his fingertips, leaning so close I could feel his breath on my skin.  He paused at my side, his hand pressed to the pink outline of the bite.
The dances became more complex, our feet tracing patterns within patterns.  I began to see them on the floor, like the trails of snails across a garden path glimmering in the candlelight.  Dance followed dance and our traces grew more distinct, tinted with colours that blended where our footsteps crossed; bisecting the pale trails of others like so much paint on a tarmac.
He leaned closer still.  “But watching him with a well-trained partner would be even more delicious.  What all has he taught you, little one?”
I sat up.  Sherlock must have changed his mind.  It made sense, we were in this part of town and it was very late.  I might as well sleep here.
“We’d stay with you longer, but there are the polar skies to paint,” she said, “and your father has spring blizzards to bestow along the way.  He’s always liked the spring ones best.”
“How’d you get that?” I asked.  “Wait.  Never mind.  Two seconds looking at Swann’s résumé on LinkedIn made you that sure the goods would be stashed down there?”
Nevertheless, I followed. Turning sideways to slip behind the chest-high urn that I had clearly seen touching the pillar supporting the balustrade moments before.  Thus, we progressed, from urn to urn, until we were close to the east side of the steps leading down to the river landing.  Sherlock placed a hand on the balustrade’s rail and hopped atop it, swivelling in a crouch, then easing down until he sat straddling it.  He curled his fingers at me.
The paper rustled when I folded over another sheet.  I put all the blue pencils in my shirt pocket and went to stand by the bottom corner of the bed.
I was very glad I had not given into the other temptation and drawn him bending down to pick up that sheet.  It had been before my mind’s eye frequently enough, especially if Sherlock happened to be coming out of or going into his bedroom or bending down for any reason, anywhere, which happens quite a lot.  Yeah, that image was on my mind quite a lot.  A full figure drawing.  Full.  It was in front of my eyes again.
I nodded and gazed upwards, saw the shadowy outline of vines hanging from the roof.  I was running out of new adjectives to express my surprise and amazement.  It was going to take me weeks to learn basic navigation of the house’s eccentricities, which I suspected had been designed with an intent to thwart interlopers.
He stopped only a step away at a point equidistant between Sherlock and me, regarded me for several seconds, then focussed on Sherlock.  They stood, eyes locked on one another for half a minute or more and judging from the slight movements of their eyebrows, gave the impression that they were having a conversation without uttering a word.
Sherlock rolled me over, arms to either side of my shoulders.  “She’s been feeding you for nearly two years and she always wears this fragrance.”  He waved his fingertips beneath my nose.
"I'm putting this straight into the freezer," Sherlock said and swept around the corner of the half-open laboratory door.
Sherlock regarded me for a moment.  "As you wish, Doctor," he said, ducking his head and smiling as he turned away.
The stag in front lifted up his head and roared.  Before the sound had faded, a pale blur streaked from the roof and, with outstretched talons, Siròc landed on the beast’s topmost antler.
“Perhaps he would like to be her guardian and have control of her assets for nearly twenty years,” Sherlock said.  “It’s a mundane reason, but often more than sufficient.”
“Shall we start calling you Salome, Sherlock?” he said, his hungry eyes sweeping over Sherlock’s chest and shoulders and opening wider as he stared at Sherlock’s face.  “Just the head not enough for you?”
He was halfway up the stairs when I registered that he had moved.  The fatigue I had felt before my flash removal was reasserting itself.  I wondered whether I could make it up another flight.
He landed across the gunwale with a crack that I feared were his ribs.  He drove the spear deep into whatever was beneath the water.  It pulled him forward as he twisted and turned the harpoon, his legs clamped about the seat.
“I’ve nearly finished making a list,” I replied, pulling out a loose sheet of paper I’d tucked into my notebook.
A gust of mild air pushed the balcony doors further open.  It carried the faint spring scent of the flowers in the courtyard mingled with the stronger smell of the roses that had bloomed all winter long around my balcony.  I closed the file, the corner of the sticky note a splash of colour dividing the length of the folder’s age-bleached cover.  Hopefully, I would have a chance to tell Sherlock my theory during the day; perhaps some physical evidence survived on which we could test it.  I tugged the towel from around my neck and rubbed it over my hair.  Clothing or a bit of jewellery maybe?  I didn’t know how long such things were kept; perhaps the paper record was all that remained.  Such basic questions.  Despite how much I had learned, I was still a novice, well, an apprentice perhaps, but it would be another chance to show him how I was taking every opportunity he gave me to learn more.
I poked at the crumpled newspapers overflowing from the cardboard box and wrinkled my nose.  “What subterranean lair did you find this in?”
I saw myself below, curled on my side, mossy log for a pillow.  Snow had dusted me from hat to boot, but I slumbered on atop a cushion of dropped needles and fallen leaves.  They had become warm beneath me.  Only my nose looked cold, the one part not covered by wool or leather.  It drew in a breath of juniper and yew and pine.  A last snowflake drifted down through the branches, green and bare alike, and landed on my nose.  It twitched and I turned my head, tucking my nose into my scarf.
“Ta for that,” John said, bending forward and pressing his lips to the small of Sherlock’s back.  He turned his head.  “I’m strongly motivated.”  He rubbed his cheek over the nearer buttock.
“He stitched me up a few times before I had a doctor in residence,” Sherlock said.  “What did you tell him had happened to you?”
Sherlock was staring at the keyhole.  John thought Sherlock must be deducing Ms Swann’s drinking habits from the scratches on it.  Maybe John was.
My vision sharpened when I saw the back of his shirt.  I let the garments fall to the floor and guided him into one of the desk chairs I had brought.  He sat heavily in it and I lifted his feet into the other.  I removed his shoes, kicked them under the chair and scooped up his other garments and dropped them over a lab stool.
He swayed and I reached out for him, grabbing his hips and scattering the stones I’d still had in my hand.  I looked up.  He braced his forearm against the wall and formed an arch above me.
I had to turn sideways to slip out of the narrow doorway ajar at the top.  I was thinking that no large instrument could be brought up those stairs, when I saw a harp glittering from the shadows of the opposite corner of the gallery.
Mrs Hudson swatted his arm.  “Who knows?  A rare coin, a jewel.  You have to admit that was no ordinary box you scooped up from the kerbside.”
“Ah,” I said between bites and helped myself to a couple more sandwiches.  “I forgot about lunch today.”
John didn’t look away.  “Do I have to sell a kidney to help pay for this or did you get the owners here off a murder charge as well?”
“I gave Sherlock his when he was very young, because he was always exploring the darkest of dark corners,” she continued.
It had been days and the pain in his leg had not returned.  The first morning it had not hurt, he had been afraid to leave home without his cane, but the second morning he had overslept and forgotten it in his haste.  He had not taken it with him since.
I looked over my shoulder at the path and the trees and underbrush beyond.  There was a rambling rose growing up one of the trees.
He smiled.  “They can’t follow where we’re going.”  He took off his cap and tucked it in his coat pocket.  “Do you wish to take these off?” he asked, his hand brushing along her sleeve.
I released my knees, let my arms hang limply by my legs.  Tears were trickling down my cheeks.  “And the other bloke?” I managed to enquire.  Despite my desire to do so, I could not make any sound that resembled a laugh.
“A side channel of the river,” he explained, setting the cooled metal aside on the work bench and placing something else in the flames.
I helped him undo it and roll the shirt sleeve up above his elbow.  “Do you have morphine here?” I asked.
A cool tongue slid over my tongue, its tip touching my palette, my teeth, my gums, round and round my mouth, over and over.
“Tall buggers, aren’t they?” John remarked.  The tip of the swan’s beak was higher than the floor of the balcony.
I waved the newspaper a bit.  “If we are to believe this fellow, they were much more than baubles.  They were works of art, historical artefacts.”
“Thinking will be clearer after both,” I murmured, rubbing my chin.  There was two days’ worth of stubble there.  I drained my cup and peeked into the teapot in hopes that there would be enough for another cup.  There was not.  I replaced the delicate china top and noticed my hand.  The scratch from the thorns was nearly gone.
He was near where I would be strongest.  Well, a couple steps to the right would have been in the middle of the quarter and that would have been even worse for him.
I checked on Baskerville.  Siròc was walking along the lioness’s back, half opening and closing her wings.  Perhaps it was a signal of hers.  Sherlock had never answered my question about how he communicated with her and I had forgotten to ask again.
Sherlock turned his head away and looked at the key from the corner of his eye.  “Not yet,” he said and spit on the key.  It turned to wood.  “There.”
“Almost everyone has someone without our…abilities, who is important to them.  He made it his business to find out who cared for whom and used threats against the more vulnerable individual to control the stronger one.  He’s been doing it for quite a while, although I hadn’t become aware until last year when one of the guests here came to ask for my help on behalf of her husband.  Unfortunately, I had to quell that disturbance in the Artic and wasn’t able to solve his problem before he affected his own solution, removing the burden from his wife’s life by killing himself.”
“He tries to keep himself entertained by bringing his talents to bear on diverting problems and makes the people who bring their problems to him pay a great deal as part of the fun.  He never cares about the havoc he wreaks as long as the solution is clever, and because he thinks I’m nearly as clever as he is, he’s always wanted me to join his enterprise.  If he could seduce me, he assumed I would be more likely to agree.”
Willpower and the exiting throng prevailed.  They bore me past the corner and over the road, leaving me washed up against the damp walls of Lloyd’s when they split three ways and thinned out.  I lingered there, back pressed against the cold stone, out of the bustle of the footpath, and watched the lights at the intersection cycle from green to amber to red and back.  The vehicles crept forwards or halted according to their signals while the pedestrians streamed off the pavement, flooding between the cars, ignoring the danger, the traffic lights and me.
I peered into the dark corners, squinted at the shadows at the side of the stone ledge.  There were several baskets there, covered with straw mats.  From one a spray of white roses hung over the edge.  They looked like ones from my balcony.  There was one red bloom on a thick, thorny stem entangled with them.  Blood red.
“The top of Parliament Hill, long before there was a Parliament to see,” I replied, confident of my answer.  “So why were the trees cleared in this direction?”
I sighed out a long breath; I have found you.  I slipped into the room.  I could smell the lavender.
Sherlock dropped the spear into the boat and took back the oar I had been holding.  He skimmed both oars through the water.  We shot forward.
Several expressions warred for supremacy on Sherlock’s face.  “Its atomic structure is perfect, every proton, neutron and electron orbiting in its proper place unless acted upon by some very powerful external force that very few can wield.”  He rolled his shoulders back.  “Very, very few.”
Sherlock tapped his wings together.  “Father implies the honour is imminent, but it never happens, so he still has Puck under control,” Sherlock finished.
Mrs Hudson poured herself another cup of tea and gazed over my shoulder for a moment.  “It’s hard to say what might have happened if Papa hadn’t inherited the florist’s shop in Bath from his great uncle Angus.”
“Your senses are sharper.  You didn’t hear them last year.”  His hand was firm on my shoulder, drawing me back in.  “We don’t need this much time.  The bells are pealing for those who have farther to travel.”
Seated before the hearth on a footstool, Mrs Hudson was busily hanging thick metal rods on an iron circlet.
“And you?” I asked, my hands taking an exploratory survey of his torso and arms.  I didn’t feel any injuries there, got up on my knees and explored lower.
“Glad I could be of help.”  I finished the tea and poured myself another cup.  “But if this has been going on since I walked in the door, more or less, what’s different now?”
"Disrobe, John," Sherlock said, shutting the door and locking it.  He toed his shoes off and kicked them towards me.  "Quickly!"
John did not care to know how the long, strong legs twined with his looked nor even that there seemed to be three of them.
I put my hand over his and blew out a long, long, breath.  “I cannot see myself, much less observe,” I said.
The biscuits were still warm.  Lemony, shortbread-y things I discovered when I ate one.  “That is lovely,” I said and the memory of Sherlock telling me who Mrs Turner was returned to me.
“You would not grow impatient, if I took so long to choose?” John asked.  It seemed an enormous request.
I edged closer, hairs raising as Sherlock moved so near to an orifice that might just include teeth.
His other eye looked straight up.  His lips, rather than being drawn back in a rictus of agony, seemed to smirk at us.  Considering how close the quillons were to his brow, the blade was likely to have reached the back of his skull.  He couldn’t be alive, and yet his open eye was so clear, the blow must have been dealt only minutes before.
Sherlock heard a sound, recognised the cadence of the footfalls.  He leaned over the edge of the roof.  The bites on John’s face and hands retained a hint of aqua light.  It was sad to see them fade.
I did not pause at the entrance to the passage to the music room, but plunged into the blackness, running my left hand along the panelled wall until I found Sherlock waiting at the other end.
“If you would read it aloud, Dr Watson,” he said to me.  “Pray, finish your tea, Mr Corvus, it will be best to face the coming hours fortified.”
There was an second, inner ring of campfires, which there hadn’t been when we’d arrived.  The crowd around the towering oak was smaller.  It seemed that most people had added their wood to the pyre and settled around their own fires to wait.
“Does she know about the Manor?” I asked as I followed Mrs Hudson between the trees.  She seemed to be following a path that I couldn’t see.
It was a box of pins that Sherlock held out to me.  He had put two between his lips and was pinning a very neat corner of black cloth around the edge of one of the plain stone sepulchres that rose from the floor.  He used the two he had and stretched out his hand for another.
Holmes’s brows lifted only slightly.  “But she didn’t want to go alone and asked Mary to accompany her and you went along to protect both ladies.”
My hands flew up.  The pencil arced backwards.  It may have made it to the skull.  “Christ Jesus, you are a stealthy bastard!” I said, twisting round to find Sherlock stood behind my chair, spectral in his sheet-wrapped pallor.
A taxi stopped at the kerb while John was pulling his keys out of his pocket.  Mrs Hudson was in the hall when he opened the door.
He twined himself around my neck, then climbed up into my hair, his claws scratching lightly against my scalp as he went.
“Damn right,” I said.  “I’m his doctor, his friend, his doctor...Sherlock.”  I was holding his wrist too tightly to take his pulse.  I forced myself to loosen my fingers.  Closed my eyes to feel, to shut out all the blood except what was inside.  What was inside was what mattered.
The library was dim and warm and Sherlock was sat before the fire.  “Come sit,” he said and gave me an appraising look from head to foot.
“She’d entitled her music, ‘Prince’.  Appears she doesn’t care for Prince Siegfried’s given name and went with his title.”
I turned slightly to look at him as he sat with the light of the stage reflected on his pale visage.
Sherlock strode out the door.  A panel was open next to the fireplace on the landing when I joined him.
“Yes.  So, Madame Willow picked up the frame, considered the photograph a moment, then looked at me.
“A sometimes fatal oversight,” he continued.  “The information is useful in forensics as well.  It can provide a valuable clue to identity.”
“And I had a wire just before we left the hotel in Paris, confirming our tickets for the concert in Montpellier.  A suite from the incidental music for
John’s breath quickened.  It made a beautiful sound, almost whistling over his teeth.  Sherlock stung once below the navel, once on the inside of a thigh, then flew up into the branches above the bed.  He clung there, dislodging the cherry blossom petals and catching the fragrance of John as it rose from his overheated skin.
Sherlock looked from my face to my hand and to my face once more.  He was searching for something there.
I made a light sketch of Sherlock’s arm continuing on from the wrist of the initial drawing.  His arms were not as well known to me as his hands.  It occurred to me to omit the flesh on one side, so that I could render the muscles in coloured detail, but I couldn’t bring myself to sacrifice that much skin.  I gazed at the trays of pencils, the creams, the pinks, the greens and the blues.  The underside of his arm would have all of those colours, perhaps more.
We both picked up our spoons.  I worked on not closing my eyes as I took each spoonful into my mouth and I succeeded.  I made myself smile and nod just a bit as I ate, but I did not speak.
Weren’t you just urging me to learn a song?  It's a probationary period; one wants to put one’s best foot forward.  Can’t you just shut up for a bit?
“I do believe we have a client,” John said, setting his cup down and pulling a mask from the box on the desk.
“After only a few minutes, Madame Willow sat up straight and looked around at us all, blinking her eyes as though arising from a doze.
“We should face this danger together and that whatever protection you had created for me – you need it, too.”
“Not yet.”  He took a folded sheet of paper from his jacket and placed it beneath my foot.  “Put your weight on that,” he said.  I stood.  A pencil appeared in his hand and he traced the outline of my foot with it, muttering to himself.  “Sit.”
There was a jingling sound from above us.  "I've got two two-pence coins and three pence," Lestrade said.
is an older traditional folk song whose lyrics have been altered somewhat for the story.  More about the song can be read
I slid to the middle of my seat, retrieved the crossbow from the bilge on the bottom boards, slung it over my shoulder and reached under Sherlock's cloak to grab hold of his jacket.
“No one I chose survived, Mr Holmes.  Not a one, and you won’t either.  Try to resist as you might, I’ll leave with what I came here to collect tonight.  You may not want to come with me, but you’ll come all the same.  You have no choice; it got past all your defences and it’s in your blood now.”
The flute sang.  The flash of a trumpet caught my eye, moving side to side, over the rail of the gallery, panting.
“There’s fresh-baked gingerbread,” she replied, gesturing with her head, hands full of tea and biscuits.
I froze with my hand on the door of the refrigerator.  There had been.  I had used them for a side experiment that had occurred to me during my research.
“Hey!” John glanced down.  The Greylag goose with part of a bread crust dangling from the side of his beak looked up innocently before he swallowed the bread down.  “So, you’re really going to ask her if she wishes to withdraw her case?  Regardless of what’s in the lab report?”
“You’ve been away from London for so long, I’m amazed an engagement necessitating travel would interest you,” I remarked, my eyes still on the scenery.
I ducked into the WC and found the light switch.  It boasted an old-fashioned toilet with the tank mounted on the wall.  A basin faced it with a narrow window above it and my toiletries in it.  I set them next to the stack of towels and sundry bottles on the narrow shelf that ran the length of the small room and rinsed my face in the icy water the tap provided.  Gasping, I grabbed one of the towels and kept the water from dripping down my neck.  My pinkened face appeared in the mirror over the shelf as I lowered the towel.  Behind me, I could see my dressing gown hanging on a hook on the back of the door.  I turned around and felt the cloth.  It was definitely there.
Everything got grayer.  I glanced out the window to see if it had started to rain, but the sky appeared unchanged.  I read the message again as I walked to the lab to consult the notebook.  My appetite had disappeared.  Attending to the lab work immediately held a greater attraction than eating, but after perusing the new entries and checking the samples I saw that there was nothing to be done for another two hours.
I was impressed at his forbearance, but Holmes has an instinct for when to press and when to give people time.
“I suggested he take a break for a while, but he’s not going to stop until he’s done,” she said when she came out.  “But you, young man, need to get some sleep before we go foraging tomorrow.”
I brought us to the door behind the arbour and six steps down brought us to a storeroom whose open door revealed the laboratory beyond.
There were statues of bronze and marble poised on pedestals about the room.  Various tables and chairs were grouped around low bookcases and display cabinets which seemed to hold insect specimens and animal skeletons as far as I could tell.  Every surface was littered with piles of books and papers, surmounted by open journals or unrolled maps.  They spoke of an ongoing occupation or one suddenly interrupted.
Eyebrows raised, John glanced up, shook his head and returned his eyes to the road.  “Could barely call it playing.  I learned the clarinet at school, but was always more interested in rugby practice than scales.  They would have thrown me out of the band if they’d had another clarinettist.”
The garments fell away, the flesh peeled back, revealing the dark heart boiling in its cage of white bone.  The flames rose higher, but they gave no heat, only the smell of burnt cloth.
In some effort towards external verification, I extended my hand past the parapet, snagged my flesh on something sharp.  I swore under my breath.  The moonlight showed the jagged scratch clearly.  I touched the ridges of torn flesh, felt the sting at the contact, the wetness of the single bead of blood.
“Thousands of ordinary insects, yes.”  His fingers trailed down my sides, around to my spine.  “But they’re larger and stronger than most of the dragonflies you’ve seen…I imagine.”  He leaned away to look at my eyes.  “Never totally sure what you see, John Watson.”
Backwards he bent me, like a willow wand, his arms about my waist, his chest against mine, his tongue cool and deep in my mouth.
The scent reminded me of the new lotions in the bath, only sharper.  More like our sheets in the morning.
Holmes held up a hand.  “If we had any doubt as to the style of address of our prospective client after hearing his letter, it has been sufficiently corroborated now.”
I did not know whether he looked at me, for I dared not look at him.  “May I choose for as long as you will have me?” I asked.
Sherlock slipped his hand beneath his father’s, turned his head and kissed the back of his father’s hand.
“No,” Sherlock said.  “As far as I know, her last litter was when Mrs Hudson’s grandparents were children.  Mrs Hudson handled most of the feedings and Chapalu took charge of homeostasis and grooming and when Baskerville got older, she taught him to hunt.  I think she considers him to still be in training.”
Sherlock was trying to watch my eyes.  I bowed my head and looked up at him from beneath my brows.  My hands were clamped around his forearms.  I had pulled him close enough for his elbows to need to bend.  I dug my thumbs into the tracery of veins at his wrists.  His eyes opened wide with the pain.  I pushed my weight on his arms and he went down on his knees.  I pressed again to keep him there.  He bit his lip to stop from crying out, but his eyes had cleared for a bit.  He had understood.
“The boatman should be waiting at the bottom of the terrace steps to transport them to the Tower.  I’m sure they will find accommodation that will suit him.  Permanently.”
I laughed at that.  “From that photographer you suspected of murder.  You sat for a whole series in order to have plenty of time to converse with him and observe his reactions.  You told him you were an actor and had me bring along changes of costume, stage make-up, and props - a skull and a riding crop.   Surely you remember?”
All my fingers found among the tufts of the cushions were more pieces of the pearly stone, some smooth, some jagged, but no knife.
“Not completely,” he answered.  “The last test resulted in rather pungent fumes, which might take some time to dissipate even with the window open.”
I extended the veins and arteries, ran them between the fingers, looped their tapered lengths around the palm.  I used the rubber to open up the veins in the wrist.  Much neater with pencil and paper than scalpel and flesh.  I made a connection that couldn’t work in real life.
John laid his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “I ridicule your grocery shopping and your knowledge of the solar system.  I’d be an idiot to ridicule your investigative technique.”
She pointed to the iron palings by the steps.  “You see where the fence is?  That’s the edge of the Manor land these days.  On the surface anyway.  The cellars go out under the road and below the basement level of the buildings on the other side.  They’re quite the labyrinth, they are.  Best not to try exploring those on your own.”
“You’re not going to stop them?” I asked, bending one leg and then the other to see if the blood was flowing properly through them.
There had been talk of my being stationed there after my injury, but in the end a surgeon with an intermittent tremor had not been worth a staff position.
Like an arrow, I sped down the moonlit slope after a shifting shadow and into the dark beneath the trees.
I tipped my head back.  There was a night sky painted on the ceiling.  Several bird skeletons were suspended from it, wired in perpetual flight, their bones catching the light.  It had been years since I had dreamt of flying.
I stared over my hand at the wide door timbers.  Round depressions and deep gouges marred its beautiful grain.  Long scratches scarred the iron hinge straps, their edges serrated with nicks and dents.
, a servant of the vampire.  Renfield wanted immortal life and he ate living things in hopes of achieving it when Dracula declined to bestow it upon him.  In Renfield's cell in the asylum, cockroaches were the only living things available to him.  He ate them avidly.”
“Wait, Mrs Hudson, let me help you with that,” I called as I hurried down the stairs from my bedroom and met her before she reached the landing outside the library.
Want.  That was the word that summed it all up and he must have felt it burgeoning against his thigh.  I inhaled, my chest pushing against his.  In bed was where I wanted him, and I would destroy anyone or anything that thwarted me having him.  Want.  I closed my eyes – upstairs was too far away.  The floor would do.
Strong arms closed about me from behind.  A long finger pressed against my lips, a long cock nestled in the ridge of my back. His voice at my ear was no louder than the rustle of a dried leaf.  “Do you want to join them?” he asked and one of his hands stroked the proof of my interest.  “There’s still a place around the oak.”  He dropped his hand from my mouth, to spread it below my heart.  He held me firmly against him, his spine flexing in time to the jingling of the bells.
“I couldn't decide between describing the injuries as psychogenic or supernatural, so I didn’t offer any explanation,” John said, “and he didn’t ask.”
“Not everyone is as skilful at searching as you are.  It might have taken him weeks,” I said, "if he succeeded at all."
“It belongs to the one quick enough to catch it and they intended that to be you.  You’ve made many friends tonight.”
I studied the hand I still held, the one that usually had a swollen middle knuckle on the little finger.  I brushed across her knuckles.  None of them were swollen in the least.  I looked up at her.
Carefully, I set aside the drawing of the arm and the atlas I had been using for support and folded back the cover of the pad.  When I glanced up, Sherlock had pushed the coffee table back and sat himself on the end.  I met his eye.  He was close enough for me to appreciate the mix of colours there, to see my own reflection.  Maybe I could draw a picture with his iris as the background and a miniature self-portrait captured in his pupil.  I exist there, in his beholding of me.  Perhaps it was why I had felt so lost when I thought he was gone.
I washed Baskerville's trough and filled it with kibble.  The sounds of the preparations seemed to have distracted him from his melancholy and he addressed the food with gusto as I refreshed his water.  It was a routine I had witnessed often enough in the kitchens.
From the hall, Alan looked back at John.  “At least I see her swan and his mate now and then on the canal.  They always remind me of Madeleine.”  He raised his hand.  “Take care,” he added and headed down the corridor.
“No, and Mum, a paralegal in the City, was making sure this didn’t turn into one,” Lestrade said, nodding.  “The older boy described the chittering as being like words.  That whatever was up under the bridge was calling his name.”
And then he paused, pulled me forward the last couple steps to stand in front of him, letting go of one arm and seizing the other, holding me there, at the centre.
“We shall have facts soon, I think,” he said and held up a locket enclosing a small braid of hair.  “This was enclosed with a letter to Lt Simpson from Madeline.  He had kept them together and she had had them back when he died.  I should be able to test the hair for traces of poison.”
His hand reached up and pushed me over.  He crawled atop me, panting.  “You know all the steps now.  They’re on your skin, in your blood.  All you must add, all you must surpass them at, is passion.”
She picked up a pot of glass held in a metal framework with a wooden handle.  “Now with this one you have to be very careful with the heat, but it’s good for delicate concoctions, perfumes or flavourings, or very subtle magic, or when the colour of the mixture is important.”
“She wanted a selfie, but her phone had no more space on it or something, so she asked me to use mine and email it to her.”
I had noticed that the violin no longer accompanied the harp.  I glanced around the room and found Sherlock joining Greg.
His hand darted out, fingertips stroking over the flints in the floor.  “She’s old and strong, this house; not easy at all to burn her nor those she shelters.”
“Pity to waste it,” I said, moving it back and forth.  The blood was starting to run down the finger.  “Going to make a mess in a minute.”
He held the fragile saucer and circled it gently beneath his nose.  “You went to Summer last night, too.”
“Yes!” Corvus exclaimed as if Holmes having said the word had unlocked something in him.  “Yes, that is what I have.  A feeling that Roderick wanted to tell me more, but could never bring himself to do it.”  Corvus took a deep breath.  “And then that night happened…”  Corvus gestured at the pages of his manuscript that were on my side table.  “…and the chance was gone.”
“Half four, then.  It will still be light.  No rain forecast for the afternoon.  John and I won’t approach you.  We’ll observe from a distance.”  Sherlock’s coat was on, his scarf still wound tightly about his lower face and neck.  “We can meet up later to discuss.”
Sherlock’s fingers opened and closed like a fan, his hand bending at the wrist above its white ruffle, the rest of his arm invisible in its black sleeve against the black cloak.
The stars shone through the bare branches of a forest of trees.  A ruddy glow lit one corner of the mirror.  Shadows moved about in its light.
Mycroft stood before the closing panel to the passageway, sleek in black.  He wore a suit, but the coat was long and the snowy collar high.
By the candle’s light, I could see that the box was bound like a heavy book.  Two walls of the room were lined with bookcases.  Who knew how long it had taken him to find that particular book, which was a fake.  I glanced about but did not see a clock.
I cleared my throat to make my announcement and stalled.  Without an introduction, I was unsure how I should address him, what honorific he might prefer.
I know how to bluff, but I wasn’t.  He didn’t frighten me.  If he was someone I had to get through to keep Sherlock, I would get through him…or die trying.  It was a calming thought.  I pressed my lips together and regarded this brother with an assessing look of my own.  The silver sheath of the rapier visible at his side was studded with dark stones; they gleamed like so many eyes.  I scanned his flowing garments – so much room for other blades.  Something silver moved at his neck and I saw a serpent’s head, like my own, peep above his ruffled collar.  I felt a movement at my throat and wondered how that would work in an encounter.
“Archie saw your branch in the kitchen and wants to take a couple cuttings from it, to root them.  He’d like to plant them either side of the river stairs.  Their roots help shore up the banks.  He asked her to ask you about it.”
For three long years, the thundering falls at Reichenbach echoed in my dreams.  I did not always remember their details, but their moods coloured my mornings.  Mary had been skilful at dispelling my ghosts, but when she, too, was gone, the sorrow with which I woke would run under the routine of my day until I lay my head again on my pillow and prayed that my slumbers would not return me to those rocky slopes.  I am profoundly grateful that I no longer have need of such prayers and earnestly hope that I may never have need of them again.
“And that, Holmes, is the sum total of my evidence for why I think that Madame Willow is not a fraud.  I don’t know how she could do what she did, or what her motivations could be because her fees were not exorbitant, but a fake she is not.  The only person I’ve ever seen come close to the sort of thing she did that evening is you, and some people think that you’re all smoke and mirrors, playing some kind of trick on them, and I know they’re wrong.  I have lots of evidence for that belief, but I only have the amount I’ve just set forth for Madame Willow, the woman who told me that you weren’t in the Land of the Dead.
I passed him another pin, lifted the fabric again and considered the date.  “Only twenty-four,” I calculated aloud.  “Twenty-three.  He didn’t quite make it to his next birthday.”  I had closed the eyes of too many equally young soldiers.  “Three years ago…almost exactly.”
He gaped.  "You are becoming a good assistant," he said to me.  "You might have told me you were already in the area," he said to Sherlock.
“He’s worth the wait though, because beneath that icy shell, I know he’s on fire, too.”  Wild Eyes glanced back at me, his hand slipping up Sherlock’s arm as he spoke, kneading the flesh as he went.  “You saw it straight away, too.  I can tell.  I admire clear-sightedness in a man.”
The ‘little’ might have rankled if he hadn’t been so much of a size with me, but the way he stroked down Sherlock’s sleeve as he finished his little speech, made me want to break his little be-ringed fingers – one by one.
He was gesturing towards the water where a dam of branches and hard-packed soil stretched from our side of the water to the other bank.
“For burning oil.”  He looked over his shoulder.  “Mind where you step; there are other supplies stowed along the way.”
I dried my hands, left Baskerville in the kitchen with the door to the courtyard open and headed upstairs.
I clambered up the ladder and looked down the dock to where Sherlock was already dissolving into the darkness.
John had curled about him, held him in his arms.  It was probably best not to bind John up, no matter how safe and delicious he would be.  His embraces were sweeter, warmer; savoury, too.
drifted over the room.  I leaned back against the window casement and watched for Mrs Hudson’s hands to play over the upper reaches of the strings of the grand harp.
I managed to close my fingers around some fragrant, flaky thing from my plate without the aid of my eyes.
“He said he’d been paid for some big case and if he gave it to me then he wouldn’t have to waste time thinking about rent every month.  I was pretty delighted, I can tell you, but afterwards…well.  That’s why I tried to give you your rent money back,” she said.
“Mrs Hudson has left us a cold supper,” he said, motioning towards the doorway.  He looked me up and down and took the carrier bag.  “One more flight up.”
Even raised in alarm, the voice resonated, deep and dark.  John clutched the bedpost and managed to sit.  The shadow billowed across the room, engulfing him.
I cleared my throat.  “Yes,” I said and raised my hands to undo the cuff of the wrist nearest me.  He was holding his arms palm up and the sleeve drooped from his forearm revealing the tender skin of the underside and the blue tracery of his veins.  I could see no wounds there.
I considered sitting, but my head didn’t feel ready for it.  “That’s good, since we don’t have a week to spare.”  I rolled onto my side facing him and propped myself up on an elbow, although I didn’t think the elbow part was going to last.  “How long have I been asleep?”
So this was Sherlock Holmes, author of monographs on esoteric topics and my potential employer.  I had pictured him older.  The publication dates of his articles went back nearly twenty years and covered such a wide range of subjects I had not been able to discern his specialism.
He looked up at me; eyes not completely focussed.  I bent to kiss his forehead and placing one foot directly behind the other, backed away.  Albeit blearily, his eyes followed me.
My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.  I strained forward, squinting.  Behind me, I heard rustling as others did the same.
John opened his eyes wider and tried working his mouth.  “Yeah,” he said on the second try.  “Thank, thank you.  I’ll do it now.”
“Margaret’s…Mrs Turner’s sister.  She’s the cook at The Holme, Mycroft’s home in the park by the lake.”  She glanced at me.  “Ah, you won’t have met her or the other Holme staff last year because you and Sherlock didn’t get back in time.  We all gather for After Fire.  Most of the people you don’t know here tonight are from The Holme.”
The vision of Sherlock without his sheet flashed before my inward eye.  Might he have drawings of a more private nature in mind?
I was relieved I would not need to hop along a line of posts to board, remembering gratefully as I clambered in how the river had narrowed over the centuries.  Behind me, I could hear Lestrade directing his team.
“John,” Greg called when he spotted me crossing the street.  He stopped at his car.  “Better you than me, mate,” he added when I joined him.
“Just what's visible now. That corner of the king’s card is emptier than it should be if the image were occupying its usual place.”
All around the circle, other sparks flared into life and other voices took up the song.  As the flames grew stronger, all those encircling the pyre stepped back a pace or two and then several more.
I had the oddest impression that I could see the dial of a clock reflected in one of his eyes, the one that was not completely hidden by the shadows.  I glanced about the courtyard; I could not see a clock embedded in its walls.
The room throbbed with the beat of drums.  The ebb and flow of a rhythm I knew, of blood through a beating heart that was slowing down.  I hid my face in Sherlock’s hair.  “Don’t leave
He was sitting across my thighs and drawing a fingertip through the wetness that I assumed was his semen on my chest.  This I could feel rather than see as his bowed head was in the way.  Judging by the wetness, I hadn’t been asleep long.
As the man came abreast of the women, the honking of the geese sounded across the water.  The pigeons rose in a cloud from around the women’s feet and the swans began flapping their long, white wings and rising out of the water.
John looked about and saw a grey-haired woman holding a lead looped around her hand heading through the tall grass in their direction.  “You’re making up that name.”
Mumbling my assent, I lowered my gaze and took to lifting covers off of dishes to hide my expression.  Surely, I was scarlet at that point.
I felt a thump on the mattress.  The vibrations drew closer.  I flung my arm behind me, swatting blindly.
She looked up at him and smiled, then she looked at me.  "No," she said, "You need water." She got up.
“Of course, it’s your recipe.”  She swatted his arm.  “It’s even better than mine and you know I don’t say that very often.”
Sherlock sat by the steps leading down to the toilets and up to the roof.  He touched the mead to his lips and grimaced.  It was never sweet enough.  He spilled some on the table, left a two-pound coin in the puddle and went up the stairs.
Sherlock had draped his coat over the back of the sofa and seated himself upon it.  “That incident would be a good place to resume your story, Ms Swann.”
There was the series with the veins and arteries twined around his hand, disappearing into the flesh of his arm and neck, his face serene above the onslaught.  I dream sometimes about those pictures, about the veins encompassing him totally, like ivy on a tree, tapping into him in all the warm places.  I dared not draw those.  Their intent was somewhat alarming and yet the temptation was always there.  I was grateful I hadn’t succumbed to it now.
John peered across the road.  By a row of ornate chimney stacks, a huge wing flapped across the moon’s face.  He leaned further past the windowsill and squinted at the wavy line.  The moon cleared another wall, illuminating a pale oval at the apex of the rippling shadow near the corner of the chimneys.  Something silvery glittered in the oval.  John focussed his gaze as though he was aiming at the eyes of an enemy.
“Sherlock helped me with that.  Came all the way to Florida and I don’t think the case was that interesting.  He’s such a good boy,” she said.
“Don’t leave me, Sherlock,” I whispered.  My leg burned and a tremor ran up my arm.  I buried my face in his hair.  It smelt sour.  “Fight it.  Fight it for me.”
Sherlock stood, adjusted my cape over his bare shoulder, draping it over the front of his bloody shirt.  It hid the worst of it, but where he’d wiped his mouth on the other sleeve showed.  “They never do.  It’s against their nature as peripatetic creatures.”  He held out his hand to me.  “Our childhood was a trial for them.”
“Black, black, black is the colour of my true love’s hair,” I sang and my voice was little more than a whisper.
Eyes wide, I watched it hover near his shoulder.  A triangle I had assumed was an ornament, held one side of the cap’s rim against the other.  The cap itself bulged with its contents.
“Oh, that’s a pity,” Mrs Hudson said, shoulders slumping.  “Not that you’ve got more work, of course,” she added hastily, “but he wanted to thank you in person.” She sighed.  “I suppose he can leave a comment on your blog,” she said, “me, too, now that I’ve revealed I’m one of your readers.  I liked when you said you lived at the most artistic address in London.”
Sherlock's eyes slid towards me, an odd expression flitting across his face.  It had already vanished when he continued speaking.  “You’re missing my point, John.  The shapeshifter is a living creature with the familiar motivations living creatures share.”  Sherlock jumped onto the platform.  “But what is this supposed to be?"  He gestured at the crouched giant made of resin and wire.  "How is it capable of motion?"  He peered at the bald pate, into an ear.  "What initiated its movement, if some mechanism makes it capable of motion.”  He studied the musculature of the heavy thighs, the knobby expanse of the nearest knee, then leaned very close to the enormous face of the hyper-realistic nude, taking out his magnifying lens and peering at something in the vicinity of the mouth.
Jim’s blood reached the boundary Sherlock had made.  There, it bubbled and hissed, but went no further.
“Well, Madeleine wasn’t like Redbeard, shifting shapes since childhood.  She didn’t find out she could change until she was in her thirties…”
I lowered my eyes, looked across the space between our chairs, and found Mr Holmes swiping through screens on his mobile with rapid flicks of his thumb.
I wondered where Sherlock had gone.  I let my eyes drift shut.  Maybe Mrs Hudson had lured him into her kitchen to feed him.  Each breath I drew was shallower than the last.  I was too tired to eat, not that anyone had asked.
“Where is the blood?” I asked.  All I had seen were the small test tube samples he had been using for his experiments.
“It’s a good point.  I was thinking several cameras hidden in the trees around the pond might catch us clearer images.”
I’d just put another quarter of a sandwich in my mouth, so I tilted my head enquiringly and checked the date along the top of the scrap of paper.  The month was gone, but the year was 1881.
“I am sorry for the pain this will cause you,” he said.  “I should have anticipated your response.”  He took his feet off the chair.  “Sit, John,” he said, reaching inside his jacket.  "You’re going to be needing this more than I will.”  He extracted a slim, leather case from his jacket; unsnapped its fastenings.  Wedged in the blue silk lining was a syringe and two ampules.  A space for a third was empty.
I thought about the enigmatic man in the room, with his laboratory, his abstruse monographs and his loyal hellhound.  I tried not to think of his long, graceful fingers.  Perhaps just one life could be enough.
“Doctor Watson has no free dances this evening,” Sherlock said serenely, but his face was too still for serenity.
The clouds had thinned and though no ray of sunshine was visible, the sky was appreciably brighter than when we had gone inside.  Corvus implored us to come with him in his carriage and Holmes agreed, sending me to tell the hansom driver to trail after us and wait at the solicitor’s office.
His eyes widened, the candlelight dancing in them, then the lids drooped and he scanned me from top to bottom and back.  “And a lively one, at that.  Oh, yes.  A very lively one, I’d warrant.”  He turned to Sherlock.  “Hard to keep the lively ones satisfied, I’ve read.”  His glance flickered back to me for an instant.  “But I’ve researched a lot on how it might be managed.  I don’t suppose you’d like to share your little treasure.”  He laid his hand on Sherlock’s arm.  “Give yourself a little rest.”
Sherlock held a hand out, moved his fingers as though conducting a tune.  “Have a weapon to hand.  Culvert isn’t likely to be pleased when he can see more clearly once the sparks die down.”
I set the empty salad bowl aside and took a peek into the covered platter.  Two roasted birds sat on a bed of rocket, small roasted potatoes and large mushrooms circling them.  I inhaled the spicy steam.  My appetite perked up.
“Clearly, your other senses are sharpening as well,” he said and daintily wiped his lips with his fingertips.
An arc of moon was showing above the trees as our fire lighters approached across the grass, Kit with his hands cupped around something upon which he was blowing.  When Bert knelt down and Kit clambered off, I saw what.
“The death of her son struck a blow to Mrs Knight’s health from which she never recovered and a month before our gathering she, too, had died.”
Sherlock arched backwards and turned his face towards John.  The light was growing brighter and more golden, outlining Sherlock’s profile and casting deep shadows on the nearer side of his face.  John pulled his gaze from the hectic pink of Sherlock’s lips and met his eyes, blue and green and gold on the morning side, a silver gleam on the near side.  They both held his gaze, looked him through.
“They should fit,” he finally said and moved to the desk and set the tray down.  “But we need to check now.  There isn’t much time, if they have to be altered.”  From inside his jacket he slid out a thick envelope and set it upright against the teapot on the tray.  “Since you ain’t dressed, it oughtn’t to take long.”
Sherlock held up his hand and a bird about the size of a pigeon with feathers of dappled brown and blue landed on his arm.
“Wrap it in a clean tea towel,” I called as I bounded up the stairs to my room.  “Just getting my medical kit.”  I grabbed my bag from the wardrobe and ran down again.  The glass door at the back of the hall was open and I followed the smell of baking to the kitchen.
“He was exceptionally good at concealment.”  Mycroft sighed.  “It took us a long time to discover what he was doing to alleviate his boredom while he waited.”
One place by day and another at night?  But I first saw this version of it at night.  What am I supposed to conclude from this?
She pointed behind us.  “Their section is along the wall by the passage to the music room.  Time for that later though.”
I paused when Mrs Hudson arrived with the tea tray and little Martha followed with sandwiches and cakes and fruit.  All was arranged at our elbows.
“Come in and close the door,” Sherlock stage whispered from the foot of the stairs.  “Mrs Hudson will be complaining that we’re letting all the heat out.”
Puck glanced with furrowed brow at the glowing border of leaves and birds and flowers on the scroll.
"I could smell the scent of fresh wood shavings mixed with the fragrance of her perfume," Sherlock said, waving his fingers beneath his nose.
“Stella and Isabelle Knight were separated in age from their two older siblings by over a decade.  When they were still children their brother had left for university, then the City, and their sister had married and moved to Edinburgh.  When their father had grown infirm, it had been Stella and Isabelle who had helped their mother look after him and when he died, they had remained to keep her company and in time, look after her.  Their siblings visited now and then, and their brother looked after their financial affairs.  It seemed no one gave any thought to their future beyond their mother’s lifetime, no plans were made to marry them and their household was comfortable enough that no one contemplated possible occupations for them outside their home.  They had a small circle of old friends with whom they sometimes travelled, one at a time we were to understand; they cultivated ‘their little talents’ for music and art, which pleased their parents, and took advantage of the many acceptable diversions for young ladies in London.  And thus, the decades passed.”
“Well, I don’t remember your asking, but if you had, my answer would have definitely been yes,” I said.
My head sank against his thigh as I caught my breath.  “Did I get anything wrong?” I asked after a bit.
“Well,” she replied, “while we’re getting to know what agrees with you, I thought it might be best to sit with you.  “That dressing has wine from the Vernet chateau in France.”
Evidence secured, we had adjourned to our rooms on the top floor of the picturesque inn’s tower.  There we had carefully stowed the dagger away, and awaited the darkness needed for our next foray.  The westering sun had poured through the semi-circle of windows overlooking naught but the greens and golds of fields and treetops as I had divested Holmes of his muddy garments and checked for any injuries that might require my attention.
You stepped over the places where they had been and offered me your hand.  I clasped it to my chest and we danced as the harp and the violin sang and beneath our feet the rocks cracked and the clay and the chalk and the earth bloomed.
I contemplated Sherlock's face.  His head was tilted slightly to the side as though he were indeed listening.
“If they did, it seems they didn’t tell tales.  No one was disinherited.  No evidence of annulments or divorces, forced or otherwise.”
I held it loosely; I didn’t want it to cut me.  I grasped the hilt with my other hand, carefully released the blade, adjusted my grip, trying to find the fit.
“He had a kerchief of hers that he kept in his breast pocket.  It was perfumed with an expensive French pefume.  Apparently, beating people senseless pays well.  I could smell the fragrance when he leaned in close to me,” Sherlock said.
Returning my eyes to my cards, I explained, “My knaves both looked like you, then the knave of hearts morphed into me.  Gun-in-hand, he has executed a similar manoeuvre, using the ace of diamonds as a stepping stone to reach a rather haughty and steely-eyed knave of diamonds."  My eyes flickered back to Sherlock's face.  That very steel grey gaze was upon me.  I looked again at the cards.  "He is less aloof now, that knave.  He's conjured a violin and begun to serenade me.  I'm seated at his feet, looking up with that look I know I have when you play.”  I glanced at Sherlock again.  Like his simulacrum, his look has softened.
Behind him, Sherlock was perambulating around the room.  John didn’t need to look to know how Sherlock would be glancing here and there with an absent-minded look that proclaimed to any onlooker that he was just passing the time whilst he waited for Ms Swann to be free.  Anyone who knew Sherlock would know better though.
I took a quick sip, keeping an eye on Siròc, but she stayed high above the oak.  I took a longer drink and handed it back.
“Dance with me,” Sherlock said, taking the flask from me and sipping from it before tucking it away.
“Your shirt will need to be removed,” I remarked, my fingers curling against my palms.  The urge to touch him grew stronger the closer I came, but the need to see that he was indeed well-healed was stronger.
I contemplated untying my shoes since we were all on one level, but the packages in my lap were in the way.  If they were lab equipment, it might have been worth landing on the floor rather than having an arseful of glass shards.  I laid my head on my arm, reasoned that a bit of a rest right there might give me enough strength to get upstairs in a while, with or without my shoes
"A spur of the Tyburn," Sherlock answered.  "We can take it west sometime.  There's bound to be mischief in that direction at some point."
“Nothing new there,” John said, straightening up and stretching.  “Can we magnify each of the frames in that sequence?”
“Excellent,” he said and sat himself with his violin case on the seat beneath the window of one of the dancing ladies.  He kicked off his shoes, put his feet up and began rosining his bow.
“Damn,” Sherlock hissed.  The coiled ropes rasped against one another as his weight shifted.  He was no longer in my torchlight.  His feet hit the wooden floor.  I shifted the phone and heard the creaking of hinges.  I lunged forward, caught the tails of his coat.  My phone fell through the trapdoor, its light flashing across the wooden beams before it was gone in the brightness below.
“A woman came by this morning, just after you left.  She said you’d forgotten something at her house.”
Molly sings the lyrics of "The Fairies" (also known as "Up the Airy Mountain") by William Allingham (1824-1889).  Some of the words have been altered to suit the story.
There was the scorching afternoon I had hunched over the wounded soldier I was tending and the bullet had hit my shoulder rather than my head.
I smiled at him.  His hair was damp from a shower; he appeared to have only his blue dressing gown on.  He had been tending an experiment involving blood when I had left in the morning.
“If you had wings, John, how many times would you have taken flight from the sitting room window?” Sherlock asked.
The three men had arrived at the edge of the open space, their faces as brightly lit by the flames as by the sun at midday.  The man in the middle unwound his arms from his companions’ shoulders and turned to face them.  He embraced one of the men, drew back and held his face in both his hands before kissing him thoroughly, then did the same to the other man.  With that, he took his leave, pivoting in place then striding to the pyre.  He scaled it slowly, appearing to think about each handhold before climbing higher.  Around him the burning wood crackled.
Sherlock squinted at the screen and re-played the clip of CCTV footage.  I leaned over, but couldn’t see much at that angle.  Sherlock handed me the phone and started for the bridge.  “You were right, Lestrade.  Unless this turns out to be a very elaborate publicity stunt gone wrong, this might be a ten.”
My eyes shifted to him.  I had nearly forgotten he was there, so silent and still had he been.  He was watching Sherlock.
“I could try to save face and say I haven’t made my mind up yet, but I have.  If he wants me to stay on, I am definitely agreeing,” I said, “so no matter how it works out, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity.”
He edged along the gunwale, retaining  his grip on the harpoon with both hands.  I could hear some portion of the beast sliding along the underside of the boat with him.
"Right," I mumbled and stepped through the pier glass, dragging the branch over the low shelf near its bottom.
Until tonight, that is, when Sherlock waved Wiggins away and finished showing me an intricate set of steps done around two crossed swords.  I’d seen dances like it before, but not ones with steps like his.  Finally, I replicated what he had demonstrated for me and we headed down the corridor and through half a dozen passageways until we found our dinner waiting for us next to the forbidding oak door marked ‘Apothecary’.  Once settled inside, I had set upon the food like a starving man.  Sherlock had eaten a few bites and turned his attention to a distillation that was making its way, as bubbles and drips, through a Gordian knot of copper and glass tubing across the room.
I had not seen him take the violin up, didn’t know if it had been in a case or lying out somewhere, but now it was against his shoulder and he swayed with the song he called forth from it, the song I had been humming.  I sat on the bench, embracing the harp in my lap and closed my eyes to listen.  Images rose before my mind’s eye, landscapes traversed by soldiers in uniforms unknown mixed with flashes of faces from my own past.  I started to sing softly.
The bird sidled closer, the white of its barred breast feathers reflecting the moonlight.  It spread and refolded its wings repeatedly as though ambivalent about remaining or taking its leave.  A silver band twinkled above the talons of one yellow leg.  When it took flight, a feather fell onto the stone.
“There was no case that I knew about.  ‘Course, I obviously didn’t know everything he was doing,” John said.
“You wanted to carry on with your life.  Fair enough.  We all make choices.  So, he gave you blood.  Just a little, mind.  Mixed it in with whatever your doctors were giving you and so you healed.”
I was extremely tired and probably somewhat intoxicated.  I finished my wine and sought out my new bed a happy man.
"I didn't have a chance to observe their researching skills," I replied.  It was true, but I also had not really been paying much attention to them.
Sherlock stopped scrolling and looked at John.  “You work hard at hiding that jealous streak of yours.”
Wiggins lit two torches.  Bert emptied a bucket of water onto the fire.  The fire hissed.  He emptied another.  The darkness edged closer.
The music had a sedate air after dinner; the conversations were quieter.  The guests traced the figures of their dances with a stately grace, as did we.  In the lulls between songs, I did not always hear the jester’s laugh or the jangle of his bells.
“And the basilic vein at the axilla,” Sherlock said.  “Yes, why crowd the entry points together when you have the whole arm to work with.”
I looked around the book-lined room, paused at the doors to the laboratory and again at the glowing embers in the hearth.  “Yes, I guess I do.”
I was not able to see much beyond the railing of the balcony, but I could sense the size of the room from the way it swallowed the sounds of our entry.
I turned the bedside lamp on and gave the room a quick inspection.  The wardrobe was full of my clothing, my books and a couple photographs were on the bookshelf next to the desk, which had my computer on it, the computer bag slung over the corner of the desk chair.  I checked the desk drawers.  The papers and pens I had shoved into the computer bag were all arrayed neatly in the various drawers.
“Those that died at home were no doubt interred there, but as members of the family sometimes succumbed while fulfilling duties or pursuing interests in London, and, as you remark, the journey home would have been a long one, they also had a crypt here and kept a record in stone in that place of those that had died elsewhere,” Holmes added.
Sherlock lit on the root and set the acorn cup down.  “The King has never bestowed one on him because...”
Mycroft covered the king’s hand and set something in his palm that Puck could not see.  He leaned forward.
I slipped the chain of the moon blade over my head and eased my arms back so my elbows rested on the top of the bank.  My muscles appreciated the respite.
A murmur rose from the guests, more like the wind than the voices of people and then, even that, died away.
His piercing gaze stayed on me.  “Even the passage of Time, the dulling of wit, the allure of the trim ankle and the coy passing glance?”
With a final wave, the man turned towards the tree, walking with measured steps to the trunk and then began to climb it.
I cut as bidden.  “I’m surprised you’re taking it down so fast,” I said.  “You only solved it last night.”
Holding the lip of the bottle against his palm, John poured more oil.  It dripped between them.  He rubbed the rest over Sherlock’s chest, circling each nipple before slipping lower.
I drew in a breath and sat up straighter in my chair.  Holmes had not turned when he spoke nor changed his posture in any manner I could detect.  In every way, he seemed as engrossed by his experiment as he had been since breakfast and yet the deep tone of his voice as he pronounced my given name seemed an invitation to activities of a less than scientific nature, activities in which I yearned to engage once more.
I tried to take all of that in.  “Electricity must have seemed as magical as the other things that happen around here,” I said.
“Right again.  So, the nephews in Scotland came into play, at least the oldest one did.  He hardly knew his maternal aunts.  It had been years since he had accompanied his mother on her annual journey south.  He was recently engaged and a property in London appealed to his fiancée.  A solicitor paid a call on the Misses Knight and conveyed the news that they must quit the premises within ninety days to make way for the arrival of the new owner of their life-long home.”
“I reserve my judgement on this Henri," I said, "but I agree with his assessment.  The music is magical.  What other explanation is there for what I’ve been able to see these last few nights?”  I raised a forefinger.  “I could describe the great coat you wore in the mountains down to the astrakhan on the collar.”
Outlined against the sinking moon, a sturdily-formed creature sat upon the parapet.  It reared and bounded into the air, forelimbs outstretched, back arched and tail streaming behind.
Somehow, he was beside me, an arm under one of mine.  “You should sit,” he urged and made to slip the dagger under his belt.
Madeleine looked down at her trousers and boots and laughed.  “I have a spare suit in my locker, but it’s too early for non-club members to swim.”  She put her hand to her forehead, feeling more than a little ridiculous saying that to him.
Lestrade's gaze shifted to Sherlock.  "Some ocean fish trying the hunting upstream?  A shark, maybe?" Lestrade asked.
“Keep watching here.  I’m going to check the other side,” Sherlock said and dashed under the bridge.
“If my mother had stayed, she would have tutored him.”  Molly shook her head.  “He wasn’t strong enough when he and his brother first arrived.  Neither of them were.”
“What does he know?” Sherlock grumbled, turning.  His lips found my neck, a hand slid beneath my arm and down my side.  “I like this one,” he murmured, clutching one of my buttocks possessively.
“Jean-Pierre thinks the syndicate might be involved in the maritime sphere as well,” Sherlock supplied.
She withdrew her hand.  “If you’re sure, dear.  Sherlock had said it would be a pleasant surprise for you when he suggested I make it this morning and he's usually right about such things.”
He drank more deeply and sighed as he returned the cup to its saucer soundlessly.  “Thank you,” Corvus said, his shoulders falling slightly.  The interlude appeared to have put him more at ease.
I may have dozed, surfeited with wine and meat.  I awoke, head against Sherlock’s thigh, to the sound of his voice calling my name.
John rinsed away the traces of lather, cleaned his teeth, and walked into the bedroom with only the towel with which he was rubbing his hair.
Mrs Turner reached out and ruffled Kit’s hair.  “We took care of that,” she said.  “She was sleek and well-healed in no time.”  She glanced at the floor.  “Make sure you clean up after her.”
Flew, for all I know.  Maybe there was an army of them waiting in the music room, on the gallery stairs, in the shadows, behind the curtains.
I was about to turn my attention back to Mrs Hudson and Kit, when Wiggins folded the cushion back, stepped onto the seat and through the window.  His arm reappeared, goblet in hand.  Bert took it, set both cups aside and followed Wiggins into Summer.
The pipes had fallen silent, the birds, too.  They had been since we started across the water.  I could hear the lap of the water against the dam.
A few minutes later, the sound of voices began to be heard over the clatter of the breeze through the bare branches above us.
He lingered by John’s bed.  “You led me to the right spot, like a beacon.”  He pulled the duvet over John’s shoulder, drew on his gloves and turned away.
Within, Holmes was sprawled upon the settee, his violin resting upon his chest, his bow arm dangling off the side, the bow resting along the carpet.  Through half-closed eyes, he watched me approach.
I stared steadily back.  The moon blade grew icy against my chest.  I forbore to touch it. His eyes were too quick.
As a student, what I used for my work was a small tin with eight colours plus a black and a white pencil.  I got full marks for my lab reports and my anatomy course work was a thing of beauty.
He wasn’t haring off as he so often does, but ambling along the bank.  He’d set his cap upon his head.  Its wings half unfolded, then settled tight against his curls.
“We’ll return in a few weeks,” Sherlock said.  “Or next week, if you like.  And you can see for yourself.  It’s best if you see for yourself.”
Yeah, we’re too far back for the gun to work.  Good as I was with an arrow or a dagger, I did often rue not being able to rely on my gun.
She started down the stairs.  “Because they didn’t want anyone else’s results to be as effective as theirs.  Those books almost never contain the whole story.  Each sorcerer has to figure those things out for themselves.”
Sherlock had been so quiet for so long, I had wondered whether he had fainted.  Several times I had looked over my shoulder to check that he was indeed still there, despite the stoutness of the mooring rope and my faith in my skill at tying knots.  Little but his hands around the harpoon had shown at first in the moonlight, but the third time I checked, he had turned his face towards me and opened his eyes as I looked.  I had nodded at him and applied myself to the interminable rowing with renewed vigour.
Sherlock heaved a sigh.  “Clever as I was, I hadn’t really understood that as a child.  He only looked to be a couple years older than me.”  Sherlock unravelled the napkin and smoothed it out on the sofa cushion.  “And when a car took a corner near our friend’s house too fast and swerved into their front garden, right through a low brick wall, Redbeard didn’t jump out of the way fast enough and the bricks crushed one of his back legs.”  A shiver ran through Sherlock.  “The yelp of pain…I will never forget it.
The stone felt somewhat unsteady beneath my feet and I wanted to protest the use of my full name.  I have never cared for it.  Instead, I heard myself saying, “For how long?”
"You missed the discussion Dr Moynihan and I had on that point.  The animal's attributes challenge the definition of death.  I would have appreciated your views on the matter, but you had nearly fallen into the creature's abdominal cavity just prior to our first observations of regenerative behaviour, so I installed you up here," he said, patting the table beside me, "and Dr Moynihan and I carried on."
I sat down at the desk.  “Which one of us is seeing things?  Was that mould a hallucinogen?” I murmured as I lined the cards back up and turned them over one by one.  The picture cards were different than when I’d first looked at them, and I felt my cheeks heating further, but each one was of Sherlock.
Beneath the music, voices murmured, but I could not see who possessed them.  They swirled between us in a blur of lustrous fabrics, but when the steps brought you and I face to face and our hands touched, I neither heard nor saw even that much of them.  I saw you, tall and regal as the night sky, your black garments studded with constellations of crystal, slashed to reveal cloth as radiant as the moon, and I danced for you.
“No,” he replied, and upended his cup of wine.  “But you’ll know what shape your steps should take.”
John leaned forward, resting his head against the side of Sherlock’s.  On the screen, in shades of black and grey, were the windows and the balcony of Ms Swann’s flat with the canal in front of it.
I shook my head.  “I knew that chapter was long, but not a whole night’s worth.”  I fastened the ties on the harp’s cover.
I shook my head slightly.  Whatever grains of truth might reside in the legends must be the echoes of some eccentric forebears.
I continued staring up at him, thought of when I’d spotted him by the light of the full moon on a rooftop in Brixton.  He was the solver of mysteries, not me, and yet, because I had been scrutinising them for hours, I did have a theory.
“Therefore, with the counsel of Crown Prince Mycroft, we have created a title for you that no one has ever had before and instead of your carrying a sword and maintaining a staid appearance at court, it requires that you wear this as a mark of your station,” Oberon explained and held out his hand to Mycroft.
Steam rose about him then, swirling over his head, droplets forming in his curls.  The lightning struck, forked and brilliant and blinding.
Cocooned in his chair, overwarm with spice and beer, John's fingers plucked sleepily at his clothes.  “Swim,” he mumbled.
As I climbed, another part of my anatomy made its interest known.  I scowled in puzzlement and then I caught a whiff of lavender.
Sparks rose like butterflies.  Everything was yellow and orange.  Ash fell like snow, white and grey.  Through it came the spikes of green.
Near the top of the stairs, in languages I didn’t know, Sherlock’s parents were bidding their guests a cordial good-night. Mycroft stood to one side, leaning against the balustrade, nodding at times in silent accord and gazing out over the crowd at others.  No one intruded on his apparent distraction by addressing him.  If he acknowledged them, they nodded to him in return; if he didn’t, they nodded to themselves and passed on.  I wondered for whom he was searching; who it was they all seemed to know needed to be found.
Considering the number of scandals in the press, hacking must have become a common skill since I’d been away.  I looked at his hands again.  His fingers were interlaced and I thought he might be keeping them in check, motion seemed to be their natural state from the little I had seen.  Images of them pulling coins out of the air or plucking scarves from people’s pockets in spills of cards and keys, guns and knives flashed through my mind.
Sherlock climbed back into the bed, swaying above John, unsteady even on all fours.  His head drooped.  He aimed for John’s mouth, collided with his shoulder instead.
I ducked past her to hold the door open while Archie got the feathery tips of the branch through the doorway.
“So,” Mrs Hudson began, “there’s the iron one.  A good material for cooking up most meals, but it can spoil the effect of certain ingredients depending on what sort they are.”
Ms Swann nodded and looked at John.  “But they are the Australian variety.”  She patted the bridge of her nose.  “With the red beaks.”
“Wait,” I said.  “I can just grab what I need for tonight.  Get the rest tomorrow.”  The tightness in my chest eased when I realised he was not suggesting I stay behind.
I stared at this man I had known for an hour.  He had not said I was uninjured; he’d said the injury was not physical.  That is pretty much the definition of a psychosomatic condition, which is what my therapist had been telling me for weeks and it had not made a bit of difference.  She did not see me.  He did.
In a moment, Sherlock was back beside me, his hand on my arm guiding me away.  “And now,” he said, so softly I doubted I could be hearing him over the symphony of crickets and fiddles that was possibly in my head, “we must dance for the rest of the evening.  Ready to begin?”
Two days of Sherlock leaping across ravines rather than rooftops, extolling the eloquence of mud as he went, had frayed my nerves more than a little.  I draped his garment bag over a desk chair and let go of my case next to it.  I wasn’t sure I was going to make it upstairs, but the case and I definitely weren't.
Sherlock set the box on the hearthstone.  He strode to the window, shut it and glanced over his shoulder at the bed.
Bunches of dried leaves and flowers dangled from the dark timbers that criss-crossed it high above my head.  Whatever was between the beams was lighter than the walls and shards of something that reflected the light were embedded in it, too.  I hoped none of it would be raining down on us.
I found another little tart as well and examined it.  The pastry had the shape of an acorn on top.  I’d eaten the other too quickly to notice any detail.  Visual inspection complete, I devoured it.
John sank further down in the chair, hands folded over his full belly, elbows on the armrests, legs akimbo.
It was weighty at my side.  I felt a smile lifting my lips.  There was another weight I often felt at my side.
I looked into the cart as it passed.  A snowy-haired woman lay in her finery upon cushions within, her features tranquil.  I couldn't help wondering whether she had died in her sleep.
I complied.  Over my head and along my arms fell a cloud of cloth.  It was as soft as the drawers, but bleached to a whiteness.
Mycroft looked Sherlock up and down, bedraggled wings duly noted.  “That was a more adventurous evening than I would have predicted.”
“She asked to see the photos on my phone again.  I never got around to forwarding the rest to her and the one I had sent wasn’t as clear as the later ones I took.”
John upended the bread wrapper for the pigeons crowded around them.  “We both saw what we saw last night and we even have it on film, and I’m doubting both my eyes and my sanity this morning,” John said.
Sherlock looked down at me, face lit by the blue glow of his phone.  “I thought you might sleep through the night as well.”
“Last week, I watched a video of the Matthew Bourne version.  It was a present.  I get a lot of presents with a swan theme.”
