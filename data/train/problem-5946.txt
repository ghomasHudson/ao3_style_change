“Dad let me help you, you can’t just do this on your own” his son begs. But Tony couldn’t allow that what if his son gets hurt or worse, he shake his head “no Bambi you can’t, I need to keep you safe from this man and besides I’m not alone I got thor with and there’s also Fury too. I won’t be alone I promise” tony answers.
Fury eye widen, “is that right” he said coldly. “And why that give the information that you seek?” He ask.
“Mute”
That got tony curious, what did she mean by that. “Ok mom I bite I like to see what it is” he replied. Peggy just smile “good, now you better go darling and remember I love you”
Though didn’t find his inner soul which was frustrating to say the least. However something had shifted, Tony left a calling to him, though he couldn’t get to the calling but it was a sign he was getting close.
Rogers face contorted into fury “god you’re arrogant, why did fury let you on this team I will never know, your nothing but a spoiled little rich brat who got everything that you wanted and never had to work a hard day in your life. You’re nothing like us Stark.
“Look pep, things have been crazy for the last few hours and I’ve been busy” he said in his defence.
It all felt like slow motion in Steve’s mind, the hammer crept more closer to him by the second he thought this was the end for him, despite being a super solider he isn’t immortal. He close his eyes and brace for the impact, but it never came, he slowly open his eyes and saw Fury, Clint and Bruce looking shock and then turn his head and look at Peggy and the two  men who look stunned as well which confused him. Then he turns to were the hammer was and his eyes widen at what he saw, Tony holding the hammer with ease preventing it from hurting Steve.
“Is it consensual?” Fury asked bluntly. Steve was shock at that question, why would Fury asked that. “Um yes it is sir” he replied but the answer that he given didn’t sound convincing. And it seems that fury himself didn’t like that response not one bit, “Rogers if you have hurt Stark in some way I swear to god I’ll....” “What no no no I swear it’s consensual, it’s like stress relief for us” he said maybe a tad bit too much which made him blush with embarrassment.
[2012]
Thor just nodded and gave him a proud smile, “then begin Anthony I’ll be here to guide you so do not be frightened”.
~~~~~~~~
But, when he went into the kitchen he was shock to find stark in there as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Sir, I should inform you that agent Romanoff and agent Barton have gone to collect Master Thor and Doctor Banner to come and met you here. And Director Fury and Captain Rogers are coming straight back here” JARVIS informs them.
Hello again
Steve was slightly panicking he didn’t know why he said that, but at the same time he just wanted to stay and protect Tony here. “I could but I think I should stay here who knows maybe Daniel will come here attack us” he said trying to find the reason in staying “but I also want to see” he said with a whisper knowing that Tony will know what he meant by seeing. Tony sigh, he knows that this  isn’t a good idea and should keep his distance from Steve for a while but something inside of him was screaming to let him come with him, god what is wrong with him he shouldn’t do this but “ok” he whispers “but you got to promise you’re not going to interrupt my training or being bossy too” he said, his mom is going to kill him.
It’s now time for Steve and Tobias to have a little chat
“Um after you Tony” Rogers said shyly and tony was surprise Roger never used his first name before and to be honest he like that he it, Tony smiled and said his thanks, then got into the car. Then Rogers followed soon after, once everyone was in the limousines drove off.
Enjoy 😊
But then a quick second later warmth wrap around him. Tobias hugged him tightly, it reminded Tony  back when he was just Tobias’s age when his little boy would just hug tightly saying if he hugged him like this then all the sadness will go away and to be honest it worked at times.
“Is Stark ok?”
“Of course pep just show me the way” he smiled to her and she just smiled back.
Hope you all had a great day 😊
Both of them let go from their hug, but it was hesitant Tony missed his son so much they haven’t seen each other for weeks or was it months he wasn’t sure. With SI, the avengers and Tobias still studying it’s hard to see each other, but they call and text as much as they can and Tony will take anything he could get to talk to his little Bambi.
A small trigger warning there will be non consensual touching in this chapter
“Dad what are you doing here, do you know what time it is?” He said with a yawn. Tony smiled at his, ‘thank god he’s safe’. With out thinking he grab his son and gave him the tightest hug he ever gave, “oh thank god” he whispered which made Tobias confused “um dad what’s happen, is everything ok?” His son ask.
Tony knew Thor and Steve are right but it felt so wrong to stay and not help. Steve felt sympathy for Tony “I understand you want to help, but Tony in your current state you might hurt yourself. Look what if Thor goes to the scene and I can contact Sam he can be there for back, and you, I and Bruce can stay here to help protect your family” Steve compromise.
The creatures eyes grew darker, and then raised Its claws ready to strike, but Tony was ready. As soon the claws strike down towards Tony, he in turn raised his fist up to prevent the attack. And as they both connect, Tony didn’t feel any pain from the creatures claws, in fact he felt warm. He didn’t realise that he had his eyes closed, and once he gently open them that’s when he saw the creature at a stand still.
Today was Tony’s birthday, he hated his birthday.
However Thor on the other hand has been kind to tony, he always comes down to the work shop to ask if he is alright and starts bringing up tales about his home land which Tony finds fascinating. Tony’s likes to him his warrior bro, Thor’s seems to chuckle at that so he sticks with it, thor has been Tony’s only real friend within the avengers, sure Bruce will always be his science bro, but at times, Tony can sense how Bruce, on occasion gets annoyed or frustrated at him, so to prevent the big guy from coming out to play he doesn’t aggravate him like he would with the SHEILD trio.
The last item in the box was a neckless a long silver chain that look old but yet strong. Attach to it was a stone, looked odd the colours seemed endless and they look like they were moving almost Tony couldn’t describe it but it was certainly beautiful. He pick it put close to his face and just stared at it,  something felt different with this neckless Tony felt a pull from it like it was special somehow but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
“Yeah me neither it’s been a long day hasn’t it. Jarvis still hasn’t found the location yet but I am hopeful that he’ll find my dad soon” he stated as he walked over to the couch and sat himself down. He motion Steve to come and join him, but Steve hesitated for a moment which made Tobias snort “at ease solider, I’m not going to hit you again unless you give me another reason” he grins. Steve can’t help but be nervous around the younger Stark, since that terrible fight he had with Tony, all the disgusting things that he said and Tobias heard it all had him riddle with guilt.
It’s then that Tony notice a small light below him, at first he thought it was his reactor. But when he looked down it’s then he saw the necklace he was wearing was glowing. Was his calmness to do with this he wonders?
Steve’s eyes widen, what? How? So many questions, he look at Peggy to look for answers. “Me and Howard had... a moment it wasn’t the best idea it almost cost him his marriage but in hindsight it gave me the best gift that I could ever asked for” she said with soft smile at her son and Tony sighed softly smiled back.
[2011]
At this moment, Tony thought that maybe, just maybe this could somehow be the key to help him find his soul ‘yeah that may sound strange’ He thought but it just felt right. Once he finished getting change, he also grab the braces you know just in case and head out the door.
So Tony told him how the training is going and how he constantly gets blocked from getting to his soul. Once he was finished he looked at John and finally said “ I don’t know what to do John, like if what Thor said is was true and my family is different from everybody else then how come I can’t master it like he said”. John gave him a sad look, “Well it seems to me you need to talk with your mom about this more than me kid. I can’t help you on this one, but what I do know is that you’ll be able to figure it out you always do” he said with a smile and Tony could only smile back at him he was right he should talk with his mom about this.
Once Tony was outside, he called the suit as it will be the fastest way to get to his son, once he was inside the suit. He use the thrusters to lift him up in the air and fly to his son, each second he flew, he tried desperately to call his son but there was no answer which panics him.
Hope you all enjoy it and I’ll see you for the next chapter 😁
Stark looked at him for a moment like he was thinking about something, but with a sigh he spoke to him in a gently tone “sit cap Ill you a batch too since your here and all” and he motion Steve to sit.
Tony smiled at himself, as he saw his boy sleeping so peacefully it made him very grateful that nothing horrific has happen to him like it happen to Tony.
Bruce look confused for a moment and he took the chance to look at everyone in the room there’s was more people then he realised. One he recognised it was Ms Carter and the other two he hadn’t got a clue who they were.
“Sir it appears the Avengers are working together to find us, you in particular. Our spies said that Agents Barton and Romanoff are at the location were Mr and Mrs Marks were killed and they also said Director Fury and a man were seen together at the SHEILD HQ” the agent reported
Steve was nervous as he knew that Fury was aware of the relationship that him and Tony have and worried he might actually get murdered by the director himself. “You said you try last time, are you sure you gonna help Tony this time around” Fury asked, “Yes Sir I will, I swear to you and to Tony” Steve answers.
He paused, looking at the other man, “Is this okay?”
“Go back to bed.” Was Tony’s only response. He looked closed off, radiating anger.
“It’s his soul mark. Huge, isn’t it? He used to show it off all the time. But after being held hostage he started covering it. We think it might’ve been totally destroyed by the reactor. It’s sad, really. Poor thing never found his soulmate and now he doesn’t have the mark to match them.” The agent said, looking solemn at the end of the statement.
“Get your own lab then, Cap.” Tony shot back, smiling.
When they collapsed on the couch, sticky with sweat, Tony reached for a rag and began wiping himself off. Steve turned to face him, a lazy smile playing on his lips. He was not met with the same look. Tony’s eyes were lifeless when he looked at Steve.
Steve nodded solemnly. “I understand. I really fucked things up.” He reached a hand up and swiped tears off of his cheeks, blushing when he noticed Tony glaring.
“Yeah I know.” Tony mumbled. Once again hating himself for sounding so weak. “You can send him on his way, though. We don’t have anything to discuss.”
“I’d do anything you asked of me.”
Shit. If Natasha was here it meant Tony knew he was gone. She’d threatened to tell him, but he didn’t think she actually would. He didn’t deserve forgiveness and he knew Tony wouldn’t be quick to offer it, which meant she was here to tell him to stay away.
Steve was stunned. He didn’t realize how angry Tony was about the entire situation. He had figured that time would heal things. He had figured Tony would’ve said something if he was still this angry. Tony pressed closer, getting into Steve’s face.
“You wouldn’t dare, Potts.” He said, turning to face his friend, who unfortunately appeared to be serious.
“Don’t walk away from me right now, Stark! I want an explanation for this! Sure, you’re mad, I got that loud and clear. But kicking me out? Breaking up the team? That’s real fuckin’ low.” Steve exclaimed.
Steve just shrugged and pressed the slice to Tony’s cheek, laughing when it stuck momentarily and then fell to the floor. Then, it was just two men pressed together against the wall. Steve could feel Tony’s heart pounding against him. He was sure his own heart was beating just as fast, if not faster. His blood was roaring in his ears. He’d never been this close to another man before. More importantly, he’d never been this close to his soulmate before.
“I can’t. It’s all true. It’s always been true.” Steve said softly.
After that first afternoon in the lab, it became a habit of sorts. Steve would come down with snacks and whatnot and lounge on the couch while Tony worked. Sometimes they would talk, but most of the time Steve would sketch different things in his notebook while Tony tinkered.
“You were just going to let me live my life thinking I didn’t have anyone!” Tony roared. “I thought the reactor ruined me, Steve! I thought I would never find someone with my mark on them! And this whole time you hid it under your stupid t-shirts and your suit and acted like it wasn’t even there. You never even mentioned it.” His voice cracked.
“I didn’t ask you to. I just think you should consider talking to him.”
And his smile. Jesus Christ, Steve was so far gone. “Maybe I will.”
“Tony,”
“That’s enough.” Tony panted, positioning himself over Steve. “Want you to fuck me now.”
Steve opened his mouth to argue again but was silenced as Tony raised a hand in his direction. The least he could do was let Tony speak.
“We’re not friends, Rogers. I don’t like you. I like sex. Now get out of my lab, for the love of God.” Tony said, as if he was exasperated with Steve for even assuming they could be anything less than enemies. The home Steve envisioned in his dreams started to burn, beautiful walls adorned with family photos of vacations and Christmases crashed to the ground. THey would never be anything more, he’d really ruined it.
Steve lifted Tony’s face until he opened his eyes to look into Steve’s eyes. They were so blue. A tear rolled down Steve’s cheek, breaking Tony’s heart. They had just started to fixed things and he’d already made Steve cry again.
Steve nodded sharply, failing to hide the disappointment from his face. Tony seemed to soften for a moment, taking a tiny step forward, but Steve knew it wasn’t substantial enough to change anything. It was too late. He’d really fucked this up and there was no coming back.
“Friday”
“Steve” Tony whispered, moving a fraction of an inch closer. Steve didn’t know what to do. It was so wrong, but it felt too right to be there, pressing close to the smaller man.
“Listen,” He started, trying to find the right thing to say to calm the other man. “I didn’t know what to say to you. I’d just gotten out of the ice and I didn’t even know that this was a possibility and--”
Another month passed and Bucky had returned to Wakanda again, preferring to send most of his time alone in the peaceful quiet he found there. The security and routine were good for him, better than busy life in the tower was. Steve missed him though. He was so fucking lonely without him. Tony still wouldn’t speak to him, preferring to glare over morning coffee and stare on the way to the battlefield.
Tony put his tools down abruptly and looked up at him, annoyance flashing in his dark eyes. Before he could speak, Steve held up a hand and began yelling.
When he made it to the lab, he could hear music playing softly and the sound of metal on metal. So he was awake, Steve thought as he stepped through the door. Tony looked up immediately and scowled before going back to his work.
“You don’t have to lie to me again. I know what’s going on.” Tony said dismissively, standing up. Steve grabbed his wrist before he even registered it. He didn’t want to be dismissed. Not again. It was so, so hard to live like this.
“I’m having a heart attack!” He wailed, clawing at his chest and collapsing onto his bed. From the doorway, Jarvis smiled. “This is not a joke! I am actively dying!”
“I’ll do anything.”
Steve felt every piece of himself shatter. He’d ruined everything.
“Fine.” Steve growled into Tony’s mouth, pulling him close again. Maybe this was for the best. Maybe they’d never get their house and their beautiful life, or even their friendship, but they could have this.
“Are you trying to get me to take care of myself or are you trying to set me up with a guy who hates me?”
“Would you like a moment to compose yourself, sir?” JARVIS asked before allowing the door to open.
Later that night, once it appeared Tony had fallen asleep again, she slipped from his room. He wished she would stay, she never stayed with him and he missed her terribly. With a heavy heart, he tossed and turned, trying to clear his mind. After what felt like hours, Tony climbed out of his bed in search of a distraction. On his way to his makeshift “lab”, he noticed light coming from the kitchen. Maybe Jarvis was awake and could be persuaded into making him a cup of tea (or something stronger considering how much pain he’d been forced to endure that night). As he went to poke his head into the kitchen, he caught hushed voices.
“What the hell does that mean?” Tony shot back. “I think I know what this feels like J. And I’ll tell you right now that it’s a whole heart attack.” His frustration momentarily overshadowed his pain as laughter filled the room. “What?” He snapped.
“What in the actual hell gave you that idea?” Tony asked, forcing Steve to look at him again. “I didn’t come here to hurt you, Steve. I came to tell you that I miss you and I want you to come back. And maybe, I want what’s in that picture too.”
“It is. But I’m giving you the chance to fix it. I’ll be back in 10.” Pepper said sharply before moving to exit the room. “Pull it together Rogers.” She snapped, reaching past him to open the door.
Shit. Steve’s heart was pounding. “Does it change anything? If his mark is completely damaged?” Steve asked. Maybe it cancelled things out. Maybe he didn’t have to worry about this. His mark was already faded after all.
“Tony, I’m so sorry. This wasn’t meant to be seen by anyone.” He stammered, trying rip the page in half as he spoke. Tony’s hand darted forward, stilling his movements before he shredded the offending sketch.
“What if I hate him?”
“I’m sorry, Miss Potts.” The psychologist spoke again.
“I wouldn’t dare.” Jarvis said sadly. “I’ve already alerted Howard and he claims to be taking care of things—getting rid of any evidence he might find.”
“Oh.” Tony responded, sounding a bit dejected. Steve wanted nothing more than to cradle him in his arms and promise to stay forever. His entire being was screaming to touch the other man. But he couldn’t, it wasn’t his place. It never was.
Years passed. No soulmate. One day, as he was patching up one of his suits, Jarvis announced an incoming call. Nick Fury.
Steve awoke to pounding on the door of his tiny apartment. He’d left the tower a few days ago, unable to watch as Tony wasted away. It was all his fault and he couldn’t fix it no matter how hard he tried. He lied, and he lost Tony because of it.
Again, nothing. Steve could feel panic rising in his chest. He was sorry. He was so sorry. And Tony refused to see it! They wouldn’t be able to fix anything if they never spoke again. He just wanted to fix everything.
“Cut the shit, Rogers. You may have been born 70 years ago, but I know for a fact you knew what it meant for guys to like guys.” Tony interrupted, seething. If Steve didn’t want him, so be it. But at least give the real reason and not some bullshit excuse about not knowing what was going on.
“Don’t speak yet, Rogers. I want you to know that I forgive you. I do. I understand why you would try to hide the mark. I’m a tough guy to love. It’s not the first time I’ve gotten that kind of response. And lucky for you, you’re off the hook.”
“Stop that. You two are going to work things out.” She replied, stern this time.
“Do what?” Tony snapped, realization dawning as he waited for Steve to elaborate.
Years later, when he awoke from the “procedure” that made him Captain America, the first thing he reached for was his mark. After years of having the raised lines across his chest, they had become a sort of comfort to him. No matter what was raging on outside, he knew there was someone out there with the same marks waiting to meet him. Panic arose in his throat as he felt for the raised lines. The doctors must have noticed his fear because a voice to his left explained that it was still there, but the lines weren’t raised. He wouldn’t have any scars anymore, including his mark. The only thing left that tied him to his other half were faint red lines.
“I wish there was more we could do for Mr. Stark, but there are some things that even science can’t heal.” The doctor said. His voice sounded further away, as if they were leaving already.
The pounding didn’t quit. It rang through his apartment as he tried to ignore it. It was probably Sam again, he’d been coming to check in every day now, forcing Steve to eat and shower and leave his room at least once a day.
…..............................................
“What’s the next question then?” Steve asked, trying to quell the panic that had risen in his throat. He wanted to hide.
At first, it seemed like Tony wouldn’t notice at all. Then, his kisses trailed from Steve’s lips to his neck, tearing a moan from the blonde man. Taking the encouragement, Tony’s kisses trailed down further. That was when Steve’s blood ran cold as he realized what Tony would see should he open his eyes. Steve froze, hands ceasing their movements on Tony’s back. Slowly, Tony’s pulled back, opening his brown eyes and staring at Steve.
After weeks of tears and pain and sadness, Tony finally felt whole. He’d finally gotten his soulmate, the one he’d been waiting for his entire life. Sure, he was nervous that Steve might change his mind, but in that moment, nothing mattered more than being wrapped up in his soulmate.
“Please listen to me Tony.” He begged. Tony shook him off and walked away, leaving Steve on the couch alone, like always.
“I know, Tony. I wish it could’ve been me too. But it’s not me for you and it’s not you for me. And that’s okay; we’ll be okay.”
“What?” Tony was already annoyed and leaving his newest suit unfinished didn’t help his mood. Why couldn’t they just leave him alone? His soulmate didn’t seem to have a problem doing it.
“You can stay. If you want, I mean. There’s plenty of space and Pep hates when I’m alone for too long.” He rambled, waving his arms about the room awkwardly and shoving his thoughts away.
“Can you kiss me?” Steve asked. He didn’t want to talk anymore; he was afraid he would ruin it. He just wanted Tony to want him.
“And what, Steve?” Tony seethed, moving closer. “And not save Bucky? No. And not lie to me? No, that couldn’t be it either. And not abandon me? Oh, wrong again. There is nothing that you would really change. Don’t pull that shit with me.”
Before he could protest, as if he actually would, Tony had leaned up slightly and closed the gap between their lips. When their lips met, Steve felt a sort of ‘click’ in his heart, maybe even his soul, and it was as if all of the emotions he had been avoiding came crashing down at once. Was this what soulmates felt like? Was this the bond that was missing at first?
He opened the door slowly, peering out at the person on the other side. His heart stopped. He wasn’t expecting Tony, in all his manic glory, to be waiting for entrance to the apartment. He stepped out of the way without a word, allowing Tony into his home. The one place he thought he would be alone.
A glare.
After Steve had sulked back to the tower with Bucky in tow, his apologies fell on deaf ears. Tony wouldn’t even look at him for longer than a few seconds. And conversation? Out of the question. But sometimes, after missions, Steve would catch Tony’s eyes and blush at the heat behind his stare. He couldn’t pinpoint when, but Tony had started looking at him again. It wasn’t necessarily a nice look, but Steve had missed those eyes all the same. He wanted to fix things with the other man, so he responded with equal stares; it was the only way he knew how to get closer to Tony again.
“You were just going to let me live my life thinking I didn’t have anyone!” Tony roared, hoping Steve could understand how hurt he was. “I thought the reactor ruined me, Steve! I thought I would never find someone with my mark on them! And this whole time you hid it under your stupid t-shirts and your suit and acted like it wasn’t even there. You never even mentioned it.” His voice cracked at the end, revealing just how affected he really was by the whole thing. He wanted to curl up and cry, but he couldn’t when the other man was staring at him like that. He was too angry.
…..............................................
There, near the center of his chest, dark red lines were bleeding up from under his skin. “Oh my god!” He breathed, reaching a shaking hand up to touch the lines as they began to raise.
When Steve stepped into the tower, things felt so off. It used to be his home and now it was a place filled with so much pain. So much pain, and he was the cause of all of it. His heart sank. As he stood glumly, waiting for instruction on where to go, the elevator chimed.
By the time the sun rose, Steve Rogers was the proud owner of a soul mark. He had never seen a mark this large before. It spread across the small expanse of his chest, slightly offset, with the center covering his heart.
Tony had apparently sensed his discomfort, breaking the kiss to glare up at the larger man. “Ever heard of hate sex, Capsicle? I don’t want to be your little girlfriend or something, I want to fuck.” He snapped.
“Rogers.” Tony said, stepping out of the elevator.
Between the feeling of Tony’s hands all over him and the kisses and his oddly romantic thoughts, Steve could hardly focus. He slowly slicked his fingers and pressed one into Tony, swallowing his gasp that came at the feeling. Ever so slowly, he worked the smaller man open, loving the whines and moans he was receiving in return.
Steve nodded slowly. “Yeah. Okay, Stark. I’ll stay for a while. I could use some quiet.”
Steve flipped them, pressing Tony into the wall beside to door to the lab. His body covered Tony’s perfectly, shielding him from everything else. Steve wished he could do this forever, maybe he could. He considered asking, but Tony began kissing down his neck, tugging at his shirt. They broke apart for a moment to strip off their shirts before falling into each other again.
“So, um, whatcha workin’ on?”
“It’s a yes or no, Steve.” Tony interrupted.
After the first week or so, Steve settled into a routine. He would wake up early and meet Sam for a run, completing a few miles before and after their meet-up as well. Then, he’d return home and shower and dress before going to his balcony to read or draw for a few hours. After that he’d review any new files from Fury and meet with any officials. He was still the team leader, after all.
After that, Pepper found her match, and she continued to work by Tony’s side, never to become anything more. His weapons business was thriving, and he was quickly skyrocketing to stardom. With his fame came a new wave of hope for finding his soulmate. He often allowed magazines to publish pictures of the mark that took up most of his chest, hoping some stranger would catch a glimpse and realize he was waiting for them. He needed them. And yet, no one ever came forward as his perfect match.
Later, Steve would find himself directing a SHIELD agent to get him all the information they had on Stark. For research purposes of course. As he was assisted in scrolling through articles and pictures and video interviews on a tablet, he noticed an odd photograph. It had to have been years ago, when Stark was far younger. College, maybe? He was tiny, perched on a leather sofa and looking into the camera with huge, puppy-dog eyes.
Steve frowned, of course it wasn’t. He shouldn’t even be here. “I should go. This was stupid.” He said, trying to turn and retreat through the nearest exit.
“How do I fix this?”
“Can’t.”
“Thank you.” Maria murmured as she swept towards the door. Tony ducked behind a potted plant, hoping he had not been discovered by the two. His mother walked past him, wiping tears from her cheeks as she returned to her quarters.
Steve frowned. “We won’t make it. It’s just too far.”
“I didn’t ask you to do that either. But think you owe it to each other to try to talk. If not for him, do it for the team. We’re nothing without you two.”
…..............................................
Before he had the chance to launch into another accusation, Tony was right in front of him. “Do not” he began, voice low and cold. “Do not ever accuse me of breaking up this team, Rogers. You wanna talk explanations? So do I. I think I deserve one too.”
She flipped the blades over in her hands when he thrust them at her, busying himself with a pile of various nuts and bolts.
“Tony please don’t make me do this.” Steve begged. He could feel the rejection coming before it even left Tony’s mouth. “I know it was overstepping a lot of boundaries. I know you don’t feel the same. Please, please don’t make me say it.”
“Okay. Get out.”
Tony didn’t leave his lab for days. He spent most of the time laying on the small couch and doing everything in his power to avoid thinking of Steve. He felt empty inside—completely drained of emotion. This whole time, his soulmate had been right there. He’d been so close, and Tony hadn’t even gotten a chance.
When he met Peggy, he felt so giddy. Sure, everyone he’d ever known had said that their lines had burned in the presence of their match, but the doctors had warned him of weakened sensation due to the altered form. Maybe this was enough, light butterflies in his stomach. He was fairly certain that she was his match. Later, he became more certain when he caught a glimpse of a raised line peeking from the collar of her blouse. He’d never seen someone with a mark over their heart like his before. He asked her if she wanted to go out the following night, of course he did. She was his soulmate for crying out loud!
“Couch” Tony gasped between kisses, trying to steer the larger man towards the inviting cushions. As they made their way over, Steve sat, pulling tony onto his lap and grasping at the hair on the nape of his neck. This was nothing like any kiss he’d ever had. Sure, he didn’t have much experience, but it wasn’t his first time kissing someone. But this, this was far better.
“Maybe she doesn’t exist. And that’s okay! I can find someone. There’s plenty of people who don’t have a match. Ya know?” Bucky said, turning away from Steve. Steve knew he was trying to hide his disappointment; Bucky was always hiding things to keep him happy.
“Is Tony awake?”
“Listen, I’ll tell them about the rule if you can’t follow it by yourself.” Pepper said, perching on the couch in the lab as Tony tinkered with one of Natasha’s knives. She was in the middle of explaining, for the thousandth time, her rule about Tony eating at least two meals a day and leaving the lab to sleep at for at least 5 hours.
“Woah, buddy. No ‘how are ya?’ or ‘long time no talk’ maybe? I was expecting more.” Tony replied, continuing to work on his suit.
He stopped at the exit to the room, turning to face his friend once more. “Listen, Pep, I wanted it to be you. I needed it to be you. There’s no one else for me.”
“Why are you here, Steve?” Tony grumbled from under his blankets.
He ripped the page out of the book. It would never happen. He’d given up any chance of that long ago. He’d ruined everything. He wiped a tear from his eye as the page fluttered to the bottom of the trash can in his empty room.
“Okay.” He agreed, turning to face Tony again.
…..............................................
Minutes later, they were covered in the remains of various fruit and laughing. Steve had Tony pinned against the wall, moving to smash the last strawberry slice onto his cheek. “Bad idea, Cap! Do you know what it takes to have skin that looks this flawless?” Tony teased.
“I wish it was you.”
“Something about lying for months and hiding the fact that he’s my soulmate might’ve had something to do with it.”
“What’s going on?” He asked as she walked out of the room.
Steve never went out with Agent Carter. They’d found another HYDRA base to strike before that and then he’d lost Bucky. And there was battle after battle. Before he knew it, he was facing death like it was any other competitor. He looked it right in the eyes, reached up to trace his mark—Peggy's face flashing into his mind—and then he crashed into the ice. Before everything faded, his heart broke for his soulmate, wherever she was.
“Get out of here, Steve.” Tony said, building each of his walls back up before Steve’s eyes. “Get out of my lab. Get out of my tower. And get out of my life.”
If Tony Stark knew anything it was that good things never lasted for him. Over the past months, he had built a tentative friendship with his teammates, inviting them to stay in his tower and interacting with them daily. For the most part, he didn’t mind the company. And Pepper loved that he had people around constantly, convinced it would force him to take care of himself when she was away. He knew it wouldn’t last, and that’s why he chose to lock himself away in his lab. If he avoided human connection, he wouldn’t be disappointed when they decided he wasn’t all that great to be around. Pepper was not impressed, to say the least.
“So, what is it? Is the reactor leaking or something?” She inquired.
“You don’t”
“And here I thought you looked like this without trying. I guess I was expecting too much.” Steve joked, feigning disappointment.
Tony slammed down, gasping as Steve entered him fully. “Fuck” He gasped into Steve’s mouth, fingers scrabbling at his shoulders.
“Would you stop acting like I’m here to hurt you, Rogers?” Tony snapped before softening again. “Just answer my question, is this something you still want?”
“It’s weird. I know it’s weird. I just- I couldn’t get it out of my head. Before Bucky, before everything, I thought we would end up somewhere like that. It’s silly. I should get rid of it.” He rushed. He was absolutely mortified. Now Tony knew everything.
“I always hurt you.” Steve said, trying to show Tony how bad this could be. If they actually tried, and Steve messed it up, he couldn’t live with himself. He couldn’t. Not again.
“What about those times in your lab?” Steve asked, remembering the feeling of total rejection that would wash over him when he left.
“I can’t continue to sleep with you. It’s not right.” Steve said, hoping Tony would understand how much it was killing him to have Tony for brief moments and then get kicked out immediately. It was so hard for him. Too hard.
“I’m afraid you’ll live to see another day after all, Mister Stark. It’s your sixteenth birthday.” He said, coming into the room with the doctor.
“Did you draw this?” He asked, shoving the paper at Steve.
“Bucky? What? He and I- I think you misunderstood. We never-” Steve began, trying to sort out his words. Tony thought he wanted Bucky?
“Next time you think you miss me I want you to change your mind. Don’t come back here again, please.” It should’ve sounded scathing, or demanding, but Tony’s voice was shaky and quiet as he made his request.
At the sight of the great Tony Stark curled up in his giant bed, Steve’s heart broke. He truly was the worst man on Earth. They should’ve just left him in the ice.
If someone would’ve told Steve that one day, he would miss Tony’s jokes, he would’ve laughed. Now, he could cry. He missed the name calling and the stories and the jabs. He missed it all and he couldn’t do anything to get it back. More than that, he missed the relationship he thought they would have someday.
He wished Pepper was his match. Sure, he didn’t get tingly or anything when she was near, but she was beyond perfect. She kept him on track and made sure he was okay without smothering him. He wanted her to be his soulmate so badly, maybe then the mark would be worth it.
Tony pulled Steve into a hug, wrapping his arms around him and burying himself in Steve’s broad chest. “Then I’m all yours, Rogers.”
“What if he hates me?”
“You’re my teammate. We have to act that way when we are on the battlefield and when we are in the public eye. But beyond that, I do not want to see you or speak to you. I think it would be best this way. That way, the bond will fade out a little more.” Tony continued.
“Please.” He said, trying to force a response from the inventor.
The pages were packed with Tony. In some, he was smiling, or laughing. In others, he was focused on his work, building various things with a look of intense focus. In others, Steve had drawn what their life could’ve been. In a few, he’d sketched a beautiful lake house, surrounded by lush trees and grass. I another, he’d drawn two children out on the banks of the water, collecting shells and grinning. The next was the worst, he hadn’t been able to look at it in months. It showed the children from before presenting shells in their pudge hands to Tony. His hair was grey at the temples, and his smile lines were slightly deeper, but he looked so happy. To his left, Steve had sketched himself, looking at the scene and smiling contentedly.
“I brought a jet.”
“Did Pepper send you?”
“Well, I’d love to say it’s good to have you back, but it’s really not.”
According to his doctors that examined him after his return, his bond would be weaker than usual at first. The altered state of his chest would affect the immediate reaction, but not the overall connection between him and his soulmate. If he ever found them, that is.
Steve couldn’t respond, he just looked at Tony. When he saw the other man, the messy hair and dark circles, he felt his face crumple. He didn’t want this to be over. He didn’t want Tony to play with him like this.
“What if I told you I wanted this too?” Tony asked, pointing towards the picture in Steve’s trembling hands.
She rolled her eyes at him. “Three days is too long! You have to take care of yourself and I swear to God I’ll bring Steve into it.”
“And to be quite honest, I don’t want an explanation at all.” He snapped, trying to sound angry instead of completely devastated. “Message received Rogers. Loud and clear. I’m not good enough for America’s hero and that is A-okay, buddy.”
Tony nodded eagerly. “Yes. Yeah. It’s good. Just haven’t been touched there since--” He trailed off, kissing Steve again. Steve wanted to break away and look at Tony’s chest, examine what little of the mark was still there. But that would give it all away. Tony would know that something was up and the moment would be ruined. Steve settled for tracing the raised skin with his fingertips, feeling for the circular outline of the red mark that he shared with Tony.
“Can’t I just stay for an hour?” Steve asked, trying to force his voice to remain calm.
“So you told him to go back to DC?”
Tony chuckled. Of course she did. “She’s always worried about me. Doesn’t really love the ‘mad scientist’ thing I’ve got going on.”
As he turned to voice this concern to his best friend, his chest began to burn. Badly. He clawed at his threadbare shirt, trying to alleviate the pain. “Jesus Christ! Buck!” He exclaimed, feeling a pain deep in his chest. “I think I'm having a heart attack!”
Steve nodded aggressively, making Tony smile just a little. He could watch this man for years. For a moment, they just stared at each other, neither man breaking the silence that had settled around them.
“Tony.” He didn’t know what else to say. There wasn’t a good place to start.
“Tony,” Steve tried to interrupt again. Heart sinking as he realized he’d finally slipped off the edge he’d been walking on for months now.
Somehow, things had spiraled out of control and he never got the chance to talk to the other man. Before he knew it, Steve was fighting side by side with Tony Stark. Of course, during battle Stark was clad in his iron suit, but Steve couldn’t help but want to remain at his side—just in case. He didn’t like Tony, not by a long shot, and the inventor clearly didn’t appreciate his company either. Yet, they ended up together on the battlefield constantly.
“I’m sorry, was that too much? I don’t know how much you’ve done with a guy before. I just couldn’t resist I guess--” He began, trailing off as his eyes quickly moved over Steve’s chest. “Wait. Just a fucking minute.” He said, leaning back to take in the faded lines.
“Get to work.” He said, kissing Steve again, hard.
He called and expressed his interest in the apartment that same evening. Once hearing his name, the woman on the other end informed him that the apartment was his as soon as he wanted it. They agreed on the next day, 8:00 am.
By the third month of their little hangout sessions, Steve couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. On days that he didn’t see Tony, he felt like something was missing. Of course, he didn’t love him or anything. He couldn’t. Sure, he may ‘like’ guys, but not Tony. If he confessed everything now, it would ruin everything they had. He couldn’t love his beautiful eyes, and his hands that were marred with tiny scars and burns, and his soft hair, and his arms, and legs, and t-shirts, and--
“He doesn’t hate you!” Pepper defended, sounding a bit unsure. Tony knew Steve hated him. Sure, they hung out when the team was around, but when they were alone Steve would clear out instantly. Not that it bothered Tony, okay, maybe a little, but he just didn’t get it. Every time Steve came around, he felt drawn to him. Clearly Rogers did not feel the same, he just didn’t understand why.
…..............................................
Before Bucky, and Siberia, and the fighting, Steve used to imagine what could happen between them. He’d developed some type of ‘crush’ on Tony and he’d always thought that maybe Tony felt the same. Even after all of this, he’d thought maybe they could work through it and explore whatever had been developing.
Steve’s eyes were wet with unshed tears and Tony wanted so badly to say sorry and pull him closer. But how could he? How could he apologize when the only one who’d done anything wrong was Steve?
Tony heard Pepper shut the door and begin moving about the kitchen. If her sniffles were any indication, she was still crying. He knew she wouldn’t return to check on him until she was composed. He felt awful. And tired. So tired.
“You know, I get the feeling you know damn well what happened.” Tony snapped, trying to shove his emotions away.
When Tony looked down, he froze. It was huge. Far larger than any other mark he’d seen before. His school friends had gotten their marks years before, as he had skipped a few grades. They had tiny designs on their arms or legs mostly. He’d never seen something so large before. The red lines bled across his chest, creating a circle with lines crisscrossing throughout it. It was intense, to say the least.
As Steve closed the distance between them, something inside Tony snapped. His eyes shone with new conviction and anger.
“The only one who acted irrationally was you. I will not apologize for reacting to your bad fucking ideas.” He seethed, breath grazing Steve’s cheeks.
After Afghanistan, his mark was destroyed, marred by scars and interrupted completely by the arc reactor. At first, it didn’t matter, but as everyone around him found their matches, he was devastated by the loss of his mark that could’ve tied him to someone. What if they didn’t want him anymore because of the damage? Would that effect their bond?
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing, Steve.” His voice was so soft, so comforting, Steve nearly melted. He hadn’t been on the receiving end of such kindness in so long.
Tony stood there in shock on what his son just said, with hesitation he turned his head to face the others. He first looked at his mom and Davis they had the same facial expression as he did, then he looked at Fury who usually doesn’t give anything away but he can tell from his aura alone he was sad about the situation.
Toni was distracted as always at the post-war meeting. Steve stared at the bruises on her face, Toni was uncomfortable with his stare but didn't want to ask him directly, so she asked with a sarcastic, "Why? Is Captain America not happy with me slipping up again? It's not that I don't want to listen to this boring presentation, it's just that my new boyfriend is so physically active these days that I'm a bit low on energy."
"Why?" Pain and aggression combined, and in no time at all tears were soaking through the tie.
"Toni, I said this was punishment." The man guarded her little belly but underneath he was not gentle and jerked his waist wildly. His force was so fierce that the girl's pussy, which had been resting for months, was a little overwhelmed at first, "FUCK, three months without fucking through here and you're as tight as a virgin, you were born to be fucked by me weren't you?"
"Be good." Steve's words were like some kind of magic and Toni was glad he couldn't see her suddenly red cheeks, obediently taking his proffered hand and then wrapping it around his waist and crouching her whole body against him, her voice faint, "I haven't been home with anyone in a long time and I really like you."
"Is that so? That's a coincidence, I'm N-S," Natasha said, still staring at the ceiling, her tone not audibly wavering.
There were other times when he couldn't resist fingering the little hole that had been resting for days, but his willpower always prevented him from plunging straight in regardless, and he simply asked the girl to keep her legs together and press against the edge of the unsatisfied hole and give it out between her legs. His mouth was not idle in this situation either, always taking turns sucking on her two nipples as if she was already producing milk now, and at the thought that this place would be frequented by their child later on, he would viciously add, "You are mine alone, and I will not save a drop of milk for him here." Natasha smiled and just gently grabbed his blonde hair, leaned back slightly and let out a few moans.
The eloquent Natasha didn't know what to say, she just found the piece of mistletoe from some unknown corner of her armour, pinned it behind her ear and kissed him viciously, on the basis that she was about the same height as Steve in the armour.
"It's your fault for being late, I didn't see a single good-looking guy that night, you must not have been there when I left, otherwise I would have met you." Toni said when she found out about it after she got together with Steve.
Steve's promised fifth day out with Toni is ruined by a surprise attack by evil men.
Unlike Natasha's resistance during the night, her moans of ecstasy are now so endearing that Steve kisses the girl on the lips, each one accompanied by a heartfelt "I love you" from both of them. Steve was in such a good mood that, like a baby clinging to its mother, he buried his head deep in the girl's chest and rubbed it against her, licking and sucking at times, causing her to cling to his neck and cry out in ticklishness.
"I worshipped him as a kid, and after all those years, seeing him in Stuttgart and fighting alongside him every day, I just couldn't get him out of my head."
"Forget it, I can't even be bothered to roll over right now, not for sparing you effort."
Grant glanced at it and smiled helplessly, continuing to concentrate on the girl's eyebrows, only looking up at her every now and then.
It was only when she got the "signal lost" result that Iron Woman really started to panic. "Maybe the locator on his uniform was accidentally damaged and he just happened to get lost, don't worry mate, he'll come back to the building and find us." With Clint's reassuring words, Natasha made her way back to the building with the rest of the team.
Steve sighed slightly in relief, "Then who am I?"
And yes. I love you. Only you. Only the you I love now has a demon living inside of it. The girl mourned, her tear-stained eyes looking up at Steve with a complexity that the man could not read.
The second time Toni Stark almost met Steve Rogers, was at a party.
Morgan's third birthday arrived. Every day since then he has dreamt of the inside of his shield with the words "Love you three thousand" written in a childish, and a mature handwriting. But he still watched the reactor go out.
When Toni came back, she said she was too weak to walk, so Steve went along with her and volunteered to carry her the last part of the way back to the tower. At first, Toni would lie on his back and occasionally touch his abs or scratch his chest, to which Steve would respond by running a few quick steps, bumping the girl on his back and shouting, "Armour for sale! Playgirl for sale! The best looking girl in the world for sale!" Then, feeling Toni was truly tired, Steve slowed his pace as he listened to the girl's steady breathing, but he wondered if the wetness he felt on his back was his illusion, but in the end, he said nothing.
"I didn't think anyone would really spend their whole life looking for someone in this day and age." Instead of showing the anger Grant expected in his mind, Natasha actually laughed out loud.
The man's slaps fell in quick succession, one after the other, the sound of the slap racing. He reached down again to free the girl's lips from between her clasped teeth, demonstratively, and the tighter she clamped down the faster he moved, as if he meant to win this. He even slipped another finger into the girl's already full pussy and Natasha finally moaned as he had hoped.
"I want you to stay, to be by my side. A chaperone, a bodyguard, a minder, whatever. Phanie, I'm sure you can do either well."
Natasha was tickled by his blonde hair and just had to incline her head away. When Steve lifted his head after sucking the milk from her body and sucking enough of the two red points on her breasts, the first thing he saw was the girl's pale neck like a silent invitation to him. Natasha felt her whole body burn and wondered if Captain America had been brainwashed with a hard drive of pornography.
He crouched down in front of Tony and held his hand tightly. Tony tapped his reactor, his voice faint, "It's still on, I think I can still receive some first aid."
It didn't matter. I'll never see anyone again anyway. I'll never see Peggy again either.
Grant smiled and shook his head, not picking up the microphone again. Instinct told Natasha that there was something else he should have left unsaid to his longer ago self, but this elusive feeling kept her from asking. So the two fell silent until they walked to the door of the next hotel.
The girl licked the corners of her mouth and giggled, "I'm not changing the subject, this has just happened many times over the past few months, where else would the baby in my belly come from?" With that, she unbuttoned her pajamas slowly and reached up to try and pull off Steve's.
It wasn't until just before the film's release that the two had a new opportunity to be seen together at various promotional events.
"No, open yourself," the man switched sides and continued to nibble delicately, "Think about what I taught you?"
He was just getting up when he heard Toni's voice, "Steve Rogers."
Hearing the two arguing in the living room, Steve rushed out of the room and Bruce immediately directed his anger at him, "Natasha told me a few days ago that Iron man was desperate, unwilling to accept the truth and hell-bent on believing you while you two were right here in the building with no pity!"
The long overdue giggles of pleasure made Steve even more excited and he rushed back in after a hasty release, taking Natasha one step at a time and laying her down on the front hood of the car. The man lifted both her legs up over his shoulders and tried harder than ever to drive the thick head of his penis deeper into her passionate body.
Tony opened his eyes to look at him and closed them again, "I don't see how important it is. Go to sleep old man, I love you too."
With quadruple vision, he could easily notice the way Toni's eyes lit up when she looked at him from the stage as if she really loved him. He mentally warned himself that he shouldn't think so much about it, that the Starks wouldn't stop for any one person. But he didn't hear another voice in his mind: hadn't Howard, the playboy he knew, finally settled down?
"Little boy destined to be alone," Toni took the bottle of water and took a couple of sips, "but seriously, haven't you ever met someone who made you want to settle down?"
Steve paced over and sat on the couch and enveloped him in his arms, "So you waited all night for me, too?"
Steve stepped back from her movements but didn't push her away either, just smiled contemptuously and shook his head, "What makes you think I'll say yes?"
Toni cocked her head, "Enjoying Toni Stark's swimsuit show all by yourself? At least you have to show some reward for me."
"You've always wondered why I wanted you to accompany me in this play, haven't you? It's my birthday present to myself, and after tomorrow I'm going to forget about him. The human brain is such a fragile thing, knowing all this is fake, but I can pretend I have gotten it. I can't be so obsessed with him anymore.  Or sooner or later it will ruin our teammate relationship. You really do look like him, with a name like him and eyes like him even more."
The crew was overjoyed that they could get a top actor of Toni's calibre for this small budget production and were happy to do all what Toni wanted.
Ending:
She admired the man's sleeping face for a moment before missing her fiancé more and more, and she gently brushed his blonde hair and whispered, "I know you're right here, I'll bring you home." Sighing, she gently rose from his arms, feeling a soreness in her back and legs that had never been worse just as soon as she hit the ground. "So that's how awesome quadruple body strength really is, I never thought Captain America would look like this when he launches into a frenzy." While mentally plotting how she was going to get it back from Steve when she got back to the building, Iron Woman casually draped a shirt over her head and opened a hidden compartment in the wall.
His stubbornness was much less, mindful of the girl's health condition and avoided plunging into that passionate little slit, but he still had the desire to relieve it at times, so Natasha had to use other places to keep him entertained under his coaxing. Not being able to inhabit the girl's soft, wet body always took her longer to satisfy Steve, but Natasha was relieved that without the big guy to disturb her dreams, she could sneak him a shot of anaesthetic for blood again while he slept.
Tony helped her sit up, and Phanie by now had completely lost her speech, "That, that won't work ......"
The man reached up to her chest and teased thenipples that were wiggling as he pounded behind her, "If you scream better, maybe I'll have mercy and come quickly."
There were things he didn't want to say or couldn't say in the real world, saying them would only add to Tony's burden, but at the moment in the dream he could perhaps follow his heart for once. After all, Dr. Strange had only said that he couldn't tell anyone in reality, but he hadn't said that he couldn't in the dream. "It's important, I only told Morgan I love her today, but I haven't told you I love you."
The following day Phanie was up unprecedentedly late. She lay in bed remembering the wonderful night she had just spent, when she had become friends with young Butler Jarvis, whom she had met for the first time, and the two of them had sparred in the moonlight, before he had taken Phanie to steal a shield from the Prince's arsenal after saying that Fanny was better suited to protecting others with a shield than attacking with a sword. He has such beautiful eyes ......
"Just a few touches in front of your admirer, and that's how wet it is? What a fuck." He said and then deliberately fiddled with the two red nipples and let out a low laugh. The girl he loved was holding his head at the moment, just wearing the expression of a mother looking at a pampered child, and asked with a soft smile, "Did you hear all that? So you're jealous?"
The girl's face still looked flushed from some excitement, "Because I fly in the sky alone every day, and this time I can hold your hand."
"You have my permission to include the New York magician, the weird guys from the universe, and what's your oldest fan's name?"
Natasha became visibly depressed, and Steve took the girl out for a drive when he had spare time. The two of them spent the afternoon at the beach, but they just played in the water and sun like children, Steve in his regular clothes, Natasha snuggled in his arms, and when she couldn't see his eyes, she was in a trance for a while, as if she was back with Captain America.
"I know, when you say it, you mean the bedroom where lots of love activities will happen. Moral benchmark huh?"
Steve was in a bit of a trance, the girl beneath him was his only love, the mother of his child, the angel who had fallen to earth to be occupied by him, and at the moment that innocent little face was pampering him with a soft, sticky voice that made him want to love for the rest of his life. "Do it again one more time, that time earlier when you clamped down on me too tightly and it was too short, doesn't count."
Steve just smiled, "You can hold my waist and be careful not to fall off."
Natasha was in a momentary trance as if it was still her serious and upright fiancé who sat next to her bed at every post-war meeting. I don't think brainwashing could turn a person from a technological idiot to a technological genius, wondering how he got interested in this, Natasha tried to talk about the science that she was familiar with in layman's terms, except for one thing, she had left back doors in all the programs she could access, and by the time she could bring Steve home, she could easily destroy most of Hydra's electronics.
"You've kept secrets from me too, Miss Natasha Stark. or should I call you Toni?"
Steve casually threw his shield to the ground and as it landed with a crunch, he stepped forward and hugged Toni before whispering in her ear, "But I do."
"Steve, wow, great name. I want you for sure, a week's film deal for whatever price you want."
"So what's next for you?"
Steve, not quite satisfied with the depth of the position, strained in and out for a while before cumming inside the girl for the first time, and Natasha's disorientated look gave him great psychological satisfaction as he reached down and tried to return the flowing fluid to the rapidly closing hole, while touching her belly and saying, "There's going to be a baby here soon." After a negligible period of inactivity, he lowered her down again and lifted one of her legs to her chest, entering at an unprecedented depth with the lubrication he had just got.
Rogers gave a deep chuckle “ oh Stark you have no idea what I’m capable of” he said coolly
Pepper nodded “Good, so Tony there is a General Marcus and Major Peters will like to speak to you about your new defence gear for the soldiers. There is also some important company’s who like to talk about any future business deals with you as well”. Tony nodded and listen to what Pepper had to say, he hated dealing with these kinds of people as they expected so much of him in so little time and the way they use him to get there own way make him on edge at times. But at the same time it’s for a good reason and to protect and save lives is all that matters to him so he’ll interact with these people for that only.
For a moment lily looked sad, “I didn’t come here to take revenge, in fact I was gonna was the glad to sent to that prison. It gave me a lot of clarity, I was in bad place before Daniel came along, he made me believe that my anger needed to be express in a certain way and I just took that as a ok to be a monster that I was to you and I am so sorry Tony. I don’t expect you to forgive me or even believe me but I am truly sorry for what I did to you” she ranted with tears now coming down her face.
Really loved Peggy and it pains him knowing that he missed so much from her life. When he found out that Peggy was still alive, jump at the chance to see her. When he arrive to the home, he so hope that she will recognise him. As he went into her room, he was shock at how different she was, how much older she was. But she was still breath taking like when she was in the 40s.
It’s difficult for Bruce, he at times likes tony. He understands Bruce’s mind and how it works, they can science all night long and never get bored.
What would the trio do?
TBC........
The agent heard the female spy, she knew this was going to happen, but this was her mission. She will not disappoint her superiors, she look straight at the spies who were coming closer to her, she gave them a dark grin, holding a device in her hand and simply said “Hail Hydra”, then she pressed the button.
“Back in 97 I got word that there might be a double agent in SHEILD me and your mother feared it was Hydra and it was most likely that they were after me and what I had. I didn’t have enough time to expose who they were, I needed that time to make sure that you had the company I had a feeling that Stane was working for them but before I could do anything well you know what happened” he said with sorrow
She recognised him and they chatted for a while, they laugh and cry about the good old days and it was good. At least he had one connection from his past, besides bucky who is still out there lost in this new world. But then as he was about to leave her mind went blank and she wasn’t Peggy anymore, which broke him more than anything.
Thor chuckled at the nickname “close your eyes, then open your mind. Find that place that makes you feel safe, find that inner peace and once you find it you’ll be able to find your soul” Thor said
With another sigh steve thought it was best to go to bed himself. Once he went under the covers, he pry that it would be a peaceful sleep.
Tony look at with sadden eyes he knows she wants to know why the others said those horrible thing to him but he guess it’s been long enough to ignore it.
What do you think of the possible little minor Bruce/Natasha ship ?
Anthony was one of them but yet he does not reveal it to them and Thor can understand to a certain extent. But surly with his gift in his grasp the team could become better. Thor would have to speak to Anthony about this matter in private at some point.
~~~~~~~~~
Pps I also wish everyone good health it’s been a bad few months and I wish everyone well and hope you all are healthy and safe x
Once Tony reach to his son apartment without anyone seeing him, he made sure JARVIS jack the security cameras.
*Gasped* Tony open his eyes panting like he ran a marathon. He looked around and saw that he was still at the forest of rebirth like he was meant to be. “Damn it” he cursed under his breath, ever since he agreed to train with Thor and find his inner soul the same fucking thing always happens, he gets close then boom lighting hits him. He can’t figure it out why this happens hell Thor always says it’s because... “you’re doubting yourself  again Anthony” Thor said interrupting Tony’s train of thought.
Natasha groans as she starts to sit up, Clint helps her and stead us her “easy there” he gently soothes. “What about the other agents are thy okay?” She ask him, Clint had a sad look to his face “agent Marcus died on impact I couldn’t Save her” he said. Natasha was sad by this news she like Agent Marcus she had a good sense of compassion and responsibility “It wasn’t your fault Clint we couldn’t have known one of our own was Hydra, we thought we have gotten rid of them during the take down” she tries to reason.
Lily turned away for a moment as if she had been slapped across the face, “I was in prison for a while and it was hell but I got serval years ago and was force to live in an isolated area, but then my husband a army lieutenant had family were I loved and well the rest was history really” she simple answers.
As they both about to walk away, Steve just had to speak up again. “We’re not done here, who is he Stark? Your toy boy or something I know you like them young but god I never thought you be some sort of perv” he sneered. Then a few happens in that moment, firstly Clint snort which resulted him being smack by Natasha. Next Tobias was ready to snap back at Steve, and Tony was also ready to snap back. But surprisingly the final moment was another fist connected to Steve’s face which shock everyone again!
Hello everyone
It hurt, it’s been a while since a man was inside him, so it took a bit longer I get use to the sensation. But once Rogers found those special bundle of nerves tony was relax and moaned from the pleasure.
Tony gritted his teeth, trying to prevent the tears from slipping out from his eyes. He has had enough of his creature, enough of the taunts, the abuse and the mind games. “You’re wrong” He grunts out, the creature look at him as if it was surprised “what was that Anthony?” It coos sickly.
~~~~~~~~
In the background Tony heard Clint scoff, “Really Stark? Well if you’re going to handle the matter. Then was the deaths of Lieutenant Marks and his wife part of it too?” He growled.
But apparently Rogers was pissed, so here they are now and tony guess he have to face the music.
Nat relax and let go dropping the knife, “I thought your kind were dead” she said, which shouldn’t really surprise Tony that she knows about them. “I take it where you were trained they taught you about us?” He ask and Natasha nodded “you were the enemy to us apparently, they said your creed was dangerous but they also said you died out years ago and we didn’t have to worry about you” she said calmly. Took this information and said “well technically they are right, there isn’t many of us anymore and some people have lost their abilities along the way, do you think I’m your enemy?” He ask he knows that she doesn’t like him and she probably say yes to his question, so it won’t be a surprise when she says “No” wait? What did she just say “I said no Tony (whoops he spoke out loud again) I’m not them anymore so I won’t class as my enemy I believe I have may misunderstood you badly and for that I apologise and I do my best to make up for my mistakes” she said sincerely. Wow that took a different turn then Tony was excepting “um thanks” he said dumbly and Natasha just smiled and sat back down.
“Are you ready Anthony?” Thor suddenly spoke, Tony and Steve turn towards Thor and Steve saw Tony’s face change into a more serious expression, he nodded and proceed to sit down in a meditation position.
Now I will apologise for this chapter as it’s quite short but all the same I do hope you like it
[1980]
Tobias understood were his grandmother was coming from after she knows Steve better than him, but he can’t help feel slightly anger at the Captain. He sighs “But they shouldn’t be near each other, that’s just going to cause more trouble” he said, Peggy sighs as well “yes they can’t seem to get away from each other, but they are both grown men we can’t separate them as much as we like to. Though maybe there’s a reason why they are all of the sudden acting close” she admits. That confuses Tobias “what do you mean by that?” He asked. “It’s nothing dear just thinking out loud” she quickly said hoping Tobias wouldn’t pursue, it seem to work though Tobias was looking confused, “Right. So... ur... can I saw my project, I think you find very interesting” he spoke changing the subject from their pervious conversation. Peggy smiles at her grandson “certainly my dear, I would love to” she sweetly said, then Tobias was telling her about his thesis, but her thoughts kept going back to her son and her ex love and hoping they are not making a mistake by being too close.
~~~~~
Meanwhile Natasha and Clint carries on looking around the crime scene, they were silence in last serval hours everything has change they didn’t know what o think how to feel. They know they had fucked up in the worse way possible and they both felt guilty.
Peggy smiled gently “please Nick its Peggy we’re friends aren’t we not. Anyways I’m not here to work don’t worry you can relax” she teased and fury just snorted.
Steve can hear a beeping sound from that he concluded it must be the monitor, he can fell pain all over his body. He’s trying to remember why he would be in this much pain, he thought back the last thing he remembered. And then it hit him the explosion, Hydra and Tony oh god Tony, where is he, Tony Tony Tony. Steve opens eyes and gasp for air in a panic he frantically looking for Tony, “Steve it’s alright you need to calm down, it’s alright” a familiar voice spoke.
That what he hope until tony step out of the elevator and heard “STARK”.
[the next day]
Tobias stares at him as he was walking away, “Hey Rogers” he shouts to him and Steve turns to face him. “You better bring my dad back” he said firmly and Steve straightens himself up “I promise, I won’t fail again you have my word” he promises and then he leaves in the elevator.
“I can gather some samples from the crime scene and analysis it to find any clues” Bruce chimes in as well. This surprise Tony they believe him and they willing to help. He wanted to cry in relief but now there’s no time for that, “thank you” he breaths out, he looks at his family who look proud at him of he just done, then he looks towards Fury “So Tony you got a plan on what your going to do?” The Director ask. Tony turns to Thor and smiles “yeah I got a plan, I guess I need to tell you why I can hold the hammer” he said, they all listen to him once again.
Tony frowned, his eyes were stinging trying not to cry “so that’s it wrong place wrong time is that was your telling me” he shouts, “you are rrrriiigghhtt” Daniel sings. Despite being royally piss off he needed to know why he was here “Why am I here Daniel?” He said with frustration in his voice.
“I’m gonna kill Steve” his mom whispers harshly, Tony sighs at her statement “no your not mom, despite what recently has happened, you wouldn’t kill him” after all Tony can tell by her aura alone that she still cares for him. Peggy gave a dark chuckle as she knew Tony used his abilities on her, like mother like son “curse your abilities, but I still will kick him in the balls for what he’s done” she replied and Tony gave a wet chuckle “and that I can believe”.
Thor continued about the special group of people and how they fought the bad guys for centuries. The tale last what seem like hours and tony couldn’t take his eyes off Thor when he spoke it was captivating the past that Thor speaks off was truly fascinating. His mom told him a similar story during the beginning of his training, but his mom never knew how their abilities came to be.
Hello again
“Right so this former agent could be a double agent as well” Natasha spoke aloud. But Thor has a grim look on his “That’s not possible Natasha” “uh what? why is that?” She spoke with confusion. “The Agent has been dead for 2 months” he tells them and they were both in shock.
Fury was brought out of his thoughts, when a knock on the door came from the other side of the door. He sighed and closed the file he had been reading, “who is it?” He said.
Once Bruce arrived to the penthouse, but he only saw Ms Carter and Tony’s son. Now Bruce wasn’t gonna lie he felt awkward, since that argument between Steve and Tony and let’s not forget the whole revolution of Tony’s past he didn’t really had time to introduce himself. So right now he just standing on one spot not sure how to act around them. “Don’t need to be so nervous Doctor Banner, we don’t bite I promise, well unless you want us to” a teasing tone came from the young boy, who grins just like his father Bruce can really see the resemblance.
“What? How is that even possible, then who recommend her then” Clint ask a bunch of questions. “According to Hill, they forge his signature and possibly used a computer recording device to mimic his voice and as no one for him they didn’t think it would be a problem hiring her” “идиот” Natasha spoke in Russian “how could they missed that?” “I don’t know” Thor just said. “Well come in then let’s go back to the tower” Clint spoke up and they all agreed and left the hospital.
He was angry, at the world, at himself. And what would he do, he’ll take it out on missions, the punching bags and at stark. He knew that stark knew Peggy as well much longer than steve knew her. And he can admit that he was jealous, angry that stark had that luxury so he took it out on him the most, which wasn’t fair but Steve didn’t care.
TBC.......
Tony ask a frustrated sigh, “look Thor I’ll ask your questions later but right now I need you to help me train, so please help me” He pleas.
Scotch burns his throat, the warm liquid warning his insides. Tony knows he shouldn’t really be drinking alcohol, he promise his son and friends. But today was a shit show.
“Yes Sir” an Agent said as she presses a button, it’s time.
Steve wanted to argue that he wanted to do this alone, but that would pointless, but also maybe they both might need to hear what fury has to say. Thor might be loyal to stark but fury would know all the answers that Steve is looking for.
“Oh by the way speaking about your mom she ask me to give you this, I was hoping to give to you sooner but I just can’t send to your tower after all security will be all over this” he said as he left leaving Tony confused. He remember his mom telling him that she got something for him on his birthday but honestly he thought she forgot but he guess it’s not appropriate to send it to his home.
[Back at the Tower]
“Sorry mom I wanted to be a happy visit” he joke. Peggy smiled at her son “it’s alright darling, it’s ok to be sad and let go of your feeling steve does it from time to time” she said gently.
[Avenger Tower]
“I know your awake Stark, you always are”
“Anyways, I think it’s time to make that breakfast, what do you say?” Tony ask trying to make the situation more happy. Tobias smiled “ Sure dad I’m starved” he replied.
Tony saw red “fuck You Rogers, you think I’m not special well your not either, you think Peggy ever cared about you, you think she loved you, you think.....urgh”
“I said you are wrong” Tony sneered loudly looking directly at the creatures cold died eyes. “I’m nothing of what you just said, You discarded looking wet tea bag. I’m not that scared little boy anymore you hear me, I’m a fucking superhero. I got a team now I’m not alone anymore, so you can take that lord voldemort  like attitude of yours and shove it up your ass” he spits out with confidence. Tony feels different somehow, his heart isn’t beating out of his chest anymore it’s calm.
Hope you liked it 😄
[present]
Tony had a similar problem, he didn’t know if he should talk to Steve. But like Steve he feared that if he said something it could make this situation worse, he sighs and continues walking in silence.
“The woman got away luckily, but the attackers got me instead. I... I know one of them his name is Daniel we use to be friends but he left and now he’s change. He ur... he and his gang hurt me badly, they beat me, tortured me and they.. they raped me” there he said it, he wanted to hide away and pretend that this was some fuck up dream.
Thor looked at him like he was an idiot, and to be honest he probably was at this point. “Are you seriously trying to defend yourself after all I have said, do you know why he acts like that. He gives us nicknames as a sign of affection, he talks the way he talks as he trying to push us away as he’s scared to get too close as he think we might hurt him. Don’t you get it, he trying to protect himself” Thor shouts.
“Sir Captain Rogers is requesting to see you” Jarvis said surprisingly gently.
The next chapter will be more interesting there gonna be a surprise for Tony hehe (it’s not a good surprise)
Rogers looked kind of shy, look awkward and didn’t know where to look. “Um.. sorry I didn’t mean to scare you I just wanted to check up on you to see if your ok” he said shyly. This surprise Tony as Rogers never really cared for him until now, why now what’s change.
Oh god oh god oh god, what just happen? Why did he... why did Stark..
Thor sat down opposite side of tony, which tony raised an eyebrow to, what was thor doing.
~~~~~~~~
Yay back with a new chapter hope you all like this one😊
“Dad?” His son softly said “are you ok?” He asks. It brought Tony out of his thoughts and he turned to his son, “no Bambi I’m not, I am so sorry you had to witness that I didn’t want you to see me in that state” Tony looks down like he was ashamed of himself.
But before she left she wanted to say one last thing to Nick, “ oh by the way, he’s your godson too so I expect you to look out for him” she smiled and starts to walk to the door.
But anyways hope you enjoy this chapter and as always sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings
Tony can feel himself going into place that he always goes, it always starts out... pleasant you could say. It starts out bright and warm, trees all around him and healthy green colour on the grass. He would see the river,  clear blue and the fish’s swimming without the care in the world, it was a beautiful scenery.
But first, Fury had to talk to them and Steve has s feeling it’s not going to end well.
It was then in the room was just Tony, Tobias, Peggy and Davis. There was an awkward silence at first until his mom spoke to him gently. “Darling tell what’s going on?” She said.
~~~~~~
And like always sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
Hi everyone hope you guys are all well and safe I’m back with a new chapter way
God knows why fury keeps him around, yes he is smart and has the resources to help them get stronger in each fight. But still after She gave fury her report surly he wouldn’t allow stark on the team, but yet he does, Natasha will look into that soon.
Enjoy 😊
~~~~~~~~~
And not only that there was a mad man named Vanko with electric whips who decided to attack him at the Grand Prix.
Then Lily decide to go a step too far, “How is he, hows my son?” She simply said. Those words made Tony snap “your son? YOUR SON! Let’s get one thing right your not his mother your just a egg donor that raped the man who raised him ok, you mean nothing to him and you never will do you understand” he shouted this shock the woman and she stepped away from him like she was the victim.
As Tony open the door the first thing he spot was a sleeping form of his Bambi. Tony was relived and he quietly walk to have a closer look at his son.
TBC............
Anyways hopes everyone is have a good day and I’ll see you in the next chapter 👍
Whilst Tony was getting change, he took off with ‘extremely’ expensive watch and went to his bed side draws to put the watch inside. As he open the drawer he notice the braces and the neckless that his mom gave to him for his birthday,he didn’t really think much of them at time but now the way the neckless was shining with all kinds of colours is telling him that this might be important.
Really why now he thoughts in frustration, “could it wait Agent Hill I’m rather busy at the moment?” He asked. But Agent Hill shook her head “ unfortunately sir they want to speak with you now, they say it’s regarding Stark. And Agent Romanoff said that she knows one way to get in here without permission Sir” she spoke with frustration in her voice.
Before Tony could ask her any else, Steve comes out the balcony, with frown on his face, “Stark what are you doing? that’s not how you treat a woman, we heard you shouting and now are scarring her” he said with disappointment in his voice.
Dirty hands grabbing him and touching him in places no one should touch without his consent.
“Well glad that was over with” Natasha said as she proceeds to gather her things, Clint nodded in agreement, it was scary for second when the explosion went off but he was glad they both didn’t get seriously hurt “ready to go?” He ask Natasha “Yes” was her answer.
On the data logs, the fucking hydra kept reports on the experiments they did to the men and women they captured. And what disturbed tony the most was the fact they kept records of beatings and sexual assault.
Thor knows what Anthony is, what his bloodline is. It was his mother after all who bless certain individuals to become there better selves to protect humanity from others who wish to control the world and its people.
~~~~~~~~~~
Fury just rolled his good eye, “fine let them in but this better be quick” he snapped, “Yes sir” Hill replies.
Tony gave her a sad look, he knows that everything doesn’t revolve around him, but today was just bad old past memories kept creeping up in his mind and he can’t focus like pepper wanted him to be. “ I’m sorry pepper I am trying to do better I swear it’s just the mission today was just hard” he spoke softly. Pepper was surprise and felt a bit guilty about what she said, “ oh tony look it’s ok it’s next time just think ok. We can rearrange dinner another time, and while I’m here I remind you that the charity gala is coming soon in a couple of weeks so be prepared for me please” pepper said.
“I have no excuse at my behaviour towards Tony, I know that now. When I woke up that day, everything changed I hated it at first, you have moved on and grown old without me, Thought Bucky died  but now he’s Hydras ex assassin who had been tortured for decades and I wasn’t there to protect him. The howling commandos are all gone. My whole past and future was taken away from me and I was angry, but then Fury gave me an opportunity to try and move on, I manage to, I made friends within and outside this team. But Tony he was different, at the time he had everything that I didn’t, you, Howard, a good start in life and the way he acted was nothing I thought I was hoping for when I first met him, I thought he would be like..” “Howard” Peggy finished his sentence with a gentle tone now.
Clint notice Steve straight away and looked surprised. “You alright there steve, you look pale like a ghost or something” He asked. It was then that Natasha looked up as well with an eyebrow raised, “ Yeah Steve are you ok, did stark give you a rough time again” she teased.
Thor gave him a sad look and sighed “No, don’t say that Anthony you can find your soul trust me what I’ve seen proves to me you can do it. You just need to believe in yourself Anthony” he said kindly.
“Captain” Tobias addresses Steve, he turns to the young boy “I want you to know that I’m extremely pissed at what you said about my dad that was just cruel and uncalled for” he states and Steve wanted to speak about it but with the look on Tobias face it wasn’t the right time, so he just nodded. “When I get my dad back I want you to stay away from him for awhile. What you two have got going on is toxic and you both need to address your issues, then maybe just maybe you two could be friends at least” he spoke firmly.
Peggy smiles fondly at Bruce “oh please Doctor Banner just call me Peggy, and I’m glad to see that you care for my son you made quite an impression on him he talks about you a lot” she informs. “He does?” Bruce reply’s, “oh yeah my dad calls you his science bro” Tobias speaks up.
“Don’t you dare speak to him like that who the fuck do you think you are?” The kid growled making himself look taller to intimidate Steve. Steve looked at the kid a bit more, he look like he was in his late teens he was tall but not as tall as he was, maybe 5’10-11. He had dark brown hair and his eyes are unique one green eye and the other eye is brown, it was strange that this kids brown eye looks exactly the same chocolate eyes as Tony’s.
That shock Tobias, he just thought that his dad and mom were just young lovers and made a stupid mistake. But never in his life he expected that confession, then instead of asking more questions he just ran.
Hello everyone sorry for the wait but I have now completed this chapter woohoo.
[Avenger tower]
Also side note I don’t know much about the American education system so I tried to be simplistic as possible.
“I thought last night would a good chance for us to talk properly for once to actually see the real you. But you know what you are Stark, your just a arrogant, egotistical, selfish, slut who just happily spread his legs for everyone to have and not only........Argh” Steve would finish his sentence. But that’s when a fist connected to his face.
Agent Hill open the door even further and the three avengers bursts through the door like it’s a mission. Romanoff was the one who spoke first, “Sir we need to speak with you about Stark it’s rather important”
Jarvis notice something was off in his system, ‘oh no’ he thought a virus how did it get into his system, he scans to try and destroy the virus but he can’t it keeps coming back so he did one last thing before it paralysis him.
The doors to the work shop open, and Thor walks into the work shop with mjolnir in hand. He look rather nervous but Tony wasn’t sure why.
I’m back sooooo sorry for this late chapter was quite stuck on this one but finally finished it woohoo
Please feel free to comment or kudos
She looked at him straight in the eyes, “I’m here because my husband was invited to come here Tony” she spook gently. But Tony wasn’t having any of that, “don’t say my name like that as if we are friends and what do you mean husband aren’t you supposed to be in a prison or something?” He spat.
The creature couldn’t move and it wasn’t able to speak, and not the only thing that was different. The dark and cold forest has change, it was bright, the sun was, the grass was green and he could see a clear river flowing beside him, it was beautiful.
TBC.......
“Urrrrg” Steve groaned, he look at who punch him and he was shock that it was non other than Nick Fury. What’s even more shocking was that Peggy was behind him with a older man around in his late 50s or early 60s, standing beside Peggy looking like he wanted to kill him and more shockingly so was Peggy.
(See the end of the chapter for
But shockingly Rogers doesn’t scoff in disgust, he laughs and he smiles shyly. “Yeah I guess I was distracted by your ass..ets” he joke. Wait what did Captain Spangles actually made a joke, all of the sudden Rogers laughs. Shit did he say that out loud, “I’m afraid you have” Rogers said teasingly. Both of them just laughed and for Tony this is really the first time they’ve been... kind to each other.
[Avenger Tower]
Tony also notice the neckless was still glowing but this time more of a golden colour then it was before. Tony sighs and steps closer to the creature, “you’re the reason why I couldn’t find what I was looking for, you’re the reason why I have nightmares constantly about what happened to me when I was 13. But not anymore I’m going to stop Daniel and when I do I will finally break free from him and from you so goodbye” he said calmly and with that touch the creature with his index finger and the creature disappeared and reveal a golden figure instead “thank you” it whispers
“TONY” a voice shouted.
It was them Steve scoff “I don’t know anymore Stark, so here’s your chance to tell us where you went last night” he said firmly. Tony was nervous now, he knew that the Avengers didn’t care much about him well except for Thor and sometimes Bruce too. But do they really think so low of him? Does he have to confess his past, his son? Why is life so unfair to him he just can’t take it anymore.
Hope you like it and as always sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
This made some sense for Tony it explains why his mom was being paranoid and overprotective during that year especially with Stane. “Okay so why are you in that neckless?” Tony pointed to his chest.
Peggy gave her grandson a sympathetic look and place a hand on his knee, “I know what you mean darling and trust me if Steve ever hurts him again he’s got me to answer to. But I believe Steve is himself also hurting and he needs help”
Steve looked frantically around to see who spoke and then he spotted Bruce. He notice that Bruce was injured, bruises mostly around his face and hands, “Bruce what happen when I got knocked out? Where’s Tony is he safe? Tell me please” Steve frantically ask Bruce. “Easy Steve to ask yours questions, according to Fury they received a distress signal possibly from Jarvis. They came to the tower but no Hydra where around and as for Tony...” Brice hesitated for a second “I’m sorry Steve but they took him” he broke the news.
Anyways he wanted to see his mom, So ask Megan to guide him to his moms room.
The helicarriar battle was bittersweet, him and Rogers work surprising well and spy chick got her man friend back so all was good. But agent- Phil died, the idiot trying to fight someone who was out of his league. But Tony respected him and he will miss him, damn it, Tony was piss and Loki is going to pay for all of this.
Stay safe 😊
Apparently it did as Rogers just walk up to tony and shove him up against the wall and roughly force his lips on his, “ if that’s how you want it so be it” Rogers grunted then he grabs tony wrist and drag him towards the bedroom, so yeah tony thought this is going to be a good night.
Tony realise he’s ignoring the fact that Steve is coming at him which some what scared him. “Um hey Steve, I’m just here to gather some food. Can the yelling wait until I eat” he tried to said sarcastically.
Once they were at the base, they manage to get rid of the hydra bastards and rescue the civilians in record time. But tony, the ever curious cat went snooping through hydras data base, and what he found terrified him.
“Thank you Anthony, this helps a lot come along it time to show you were you’ll start training” Thor stood up then grab his hammer.
“Yes general, despite some minor set backs we got everything in order” he spoke with irritants in his voice. He knew the general since he was a child and help him trained throughout his child and teenage years, but when he went to prison the contact between them stop for a while but that was because the general didn’t want SHEILD knowing who he was and his associations with Daniel. But after a few years the contact came back but also making sure there evidence of this interaction, and when the time came the general got him out of prison and few months ago and since then they were making there plans.

“Nat, Tasha can you hear me?” A male voice echos near her, Nat moans in response. She slowly opens her eyes and notice that Clint is looking at her worryingly. She also notice he has some superficial injuries to his face but what she could see was nothing major.
TBC......
Tony just lays there stunned, he didn’t know what to do, what experiments did Daniel mean? And how did they know about his abilities, Tony has many questions. But for right now he needs to find away to escape and he hopes that the others will find him soon before things gets worse for him.
“Jarvis gather the Avengers and tell them to meet me in the training room I think it’s time for us to start forming a battle plan” Steve informs the AI. “Of course Captain Rogers” the AI replies, Steve then turns to Tobias “I must be off, thank you for this talk, this means a lot” he smiles and walks to the elevator.
But Tobias did want to help his dad in some way, even if he currently didn’t want to inherit the company. So he made his decision, when he was 16 (he got to leave high school early because you know he is also a genius) he got into MIT just like his dad and studied mathematics and engineering he wanted to to know the basic at what the company was all about so a handy degree would be useful.
The three Avengers were knock off their feet and hit the ground hard, Tony needed to get his suit fast, but a grenade came through the window and smoke filled the room ‘sleeping gas’ ‘shit’ Tony thought this is not going well he hopes his mom and son are safe but as he slips into darkness he saw a few pairs of feet coming towards them then Tony descended into darkness.
Thor smiled at tony “it has many names here, but simply put it’s called the forest of rebirth. It’s a place where I use to train when I was younger, I was alone when I trained it was to help me to learn how to survive. But for you I’m going to help you, here you will learn how to control your energy, it will be challenging but in the end you will master it”
Steve realise that he hasn’t spoken yet, so quickly snap out of his thoughts and looked at Nat with a smile. “ I appreciate that Nat but I’m not really ready to date anyone for a while”  he said simple. Nat just nodded like she understood and then continued reading her book, whilst Clint was just cleaning his bow, leaving Steve to his thoughts.
Thor heard the door open and proceeded to turn in that direction with a smile “Ah Anthony, glad you could ma....,” he stops short when he notice Steve behind Tony. Tony notice this as he can see Thors aura change from calm to anger, he can also notice Thors fingers twitching like he’s ready to call for his hammer.
Was the first thing Tony heard was his name bouncing off the walls, what came after that was Steve storming towards him after he saw him coming out of the elevator. Behind Steve he could see Natasha, Clint sitting at the counter eating breakfast. They look some what angry at him, which Tony knew that could be a possibility from last night but this seems different some how.
“Where is everyone?” He ask Bruce as he starts rip out the IV and remove himself from the medical bed. Bruce was in a panic, Steve shouldn’t even leave the medic, “Well Fury is gathering everyone for a meeting about the situation, but Steve you shouldn’t...” Bruce wanted to continue but Steve interrupted him. “Good, show me where they are” he quickly said he manages to find spare appropriate clothes and heads out the room, Bruce rushes behind “Steve, your injured you shouldn’t put to much strain on your body” he informs Steve with concern. But Steve continues to walk ahead “I’m fine Bruce, I heal much quickly than an average human” he tells Bruce, this leaves Bruce with a tired sigh he knows he can’t get through to Steve he’s too stubborn to see reason.
