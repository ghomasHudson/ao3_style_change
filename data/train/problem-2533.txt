“Here now, what’s this?”  The tired woman ladling out porridge snapped to alertness when her eyes landed on Sherlock. “What’s one of
“Christ, I have work tomorrow,” John complained, dropping his jacket to the ground. He sat heavily on the edge of the bed to work off his own shoes and socks.
“In a moment, there’s something I wanted to finish researching before turning in.”
“Oh, it’s nothing.” She looked down, bashful at being caught out, and cleared her throat.
“Yeah, you two can make cow eyes at each other outside.”  Dom winked.
“It isn’t nothing. You’re bleeding. For all I know, she cracked a bone.”
The happy barks emanating from the wiggling pack were delightfully punctuated with stray giggles and the occasional yip if someone nipped too hard. Sherlock heard one plaintive cry and looked for the source, finding Oscar still bound inside his metal cage in the corner, now up on all fours, and whining desperately to be let out. As Sherlock watched, a dark patch grew across the grey pants he wore, eventually leading to a stream of piss that leaked out to spatter over the cage floor.
Back at his hotel room, Sherlock powered up his laptop, plugged in his camera, and transferred all the incriminating shots of Mr. Big Brit onto the hard drive. He tried logging into a secure network to upload them, and received nothing but a whirling circle of doom informing him he didn’t have sufficient wifi access to complete the action. Bloody Afghanistan. Sherlock went to plan B, and copied the pictures to a memory stick instead, wiping them off the computer.
“JOHN?”
‘But you wrote your password for hobbits to read,’ the Little Hobbit managed to squeak.
“I feel blessed already,” Sherlock said. “I’ll hang it in my bedroom for luck.” No reason to say that if he hung it anywhere else in the house, his mother would have it sent to the rubbish bin.  “Thank you, John, it’s perfect.”
“John, you’re drunk.”  Sherlock sounded aghast.
“After a week of shagging Emile to his heart’s content, and stringing him along with talks of a bond, he simply returned to his bond-mate and his job at
“Sherlock.” John turned wet eyes his way. “How did you . . .”
“It’s just understood.”
“Oh, well, alright.” John struggled back to his feet, feeling like lead inside.
Holmeses. He wasn’t anything other than Private Holmes now, and that suited him just fine.
“Naw, might as well have the engineers make sure things are okay over here,” John said.
“I’m sorry, this is inexcusable. I’ll have a new order put in right away.”
“I love you, oh, I love you.” John sounded as if he might laugh or cry, and Sherlock held him as tightly as he could, as if they could sink into each other’s skin and stay together like that for always.
Sherlock was tired by the end of class, but feeling reasonably satisfied with the way things had gone. All in all, it was an auspicious beginning. He bent to retrieve the bottle of water he had brought along as everyone dispersed. After a few good pulls to slake his thirst, he lowered the bottle to find John had appeared before him, smiling.
“Here you go.” John appeared to hand him a chunky, hand-blown glass filled with square ice cubes and water.
“I think you just didn’t notice them.” John’s eyes went soft. “I can’t believe people didn’t notice you.”
“She’s being ridiculous.” Sherlock frowned.
“Oh, now you don’t need to look as dismal as all that.” Mycroft muttered as they fell in to step, moving briskly down the corridor toward the front door.
“I’m not that,” Sherlock protested. “I’m an idiot.”
“Ah, good morning, brother dear.” Mycroft turned to face him. “Your new paramour and I were just getting acquainted.” A smarmy smile slid over his face as he raised his eyebrows
“Erm, okay, right.” John nodded. He tried to pick up an ice cream, but everything slipped away, the dream breaking apart before he could grasp it.
“Fuck you, John.” Harry’s voice had gone icy calm.
“Wow, you never told me your other intern was  . . . ”  John waved a hand as they stepped outside, the toy soldiers standing politely aside to let them pass.
They moved into the dark of the building through a side door to a corridor that looked as if it might lead them back to the lobby. John was just wondering if it would be okay if he took Sherlock’s hand when a very loud male voice reached them from around the corner.
“Oh, that sounds . . . nice?” John frowned slightly as Sherlock stopped to breathe.
“Urgh, look at these idiots.” Sherlock scowled at several couples flirting at a table across the room. “It’s horrid.”
“Are there any other books related to this one?”  Sherlock squinted at the bookcase.
“Yes, Thai can have that effect.” Mycroft turned as the kettle clicked off. “Perhaps you wouldn’t mind joining me in a cup of chamomile?” He lifted the box of herbal tea he had on the worktop. “It has a calming effect on a number of systems.”
“This looks old.” Sherlock knelt down by a box that had slipped open in transit, one of those holding his books. Sherlock smiled as he held up a tattered, thin paperback.  “Timothy and the Two Witches” the cover read.
“Yeah, that was good, wasn’t it?” John felt about ten feet tall as he pulled the door open to usher Sherlock inside.
“I thought I’d let you do this one.”
“You weren’t altogether comfortable with being seen as bisexual.” Sherlock’s voice had gone more hesitant.
“Can you . . .” Sherlock turned to John as they rose.
When John had explained about his mum selling the house, Victoire pulled a face. “Oh, that is hard,” she said.
John hummed something in reply, settling beside him.
“If it goes sour, I want John protected.” Sherlock folded his arms tightly over his chest. “No one goes after him.”
Sherlock’s letters came thick and fast with the Owl Post over the next fortnight, but then they tapered off again after that.  John has already sent him three notes and not heard  back. John sighed as his owl, Simpson, flew overhead at breakfast dropping off a letter from his mum, but no sign of anything from Sherlock.
“Yeah, okay, let’s try that.”
“Damn. Well worth a try.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock looked up from where he was bent over his microscope. He had his safety goggles pushed back, rucking his fringe up. It reminded John how overdue they both were for a haircut.
It took longer than they thought it would, but they managed to round up a good handful of workers to help with the replacing of the tubing. It was grubby, hot work under the sun, and John only let them take a short break for lunch, determined to finish that day. Finally in late afternoon, all seemed ready. John gave the signal, and the water was turned on.
“HEY!” John growled, reaching to reclaim the scroll, but Teddy just held it farther away.
Lestrade nodded. “Well, don’t let me keep you, son. I know you’ve lots to do.”
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock asked when he pulled away, his eyes shining.
Sherlock hit send, and looked up at John, slipping his phone away.
“Oh, pish tosh. Call Mycroft. He’ll know.” Mrs. Hudson waved a careless hand. “You do have Mycroft’s number?”
John stepped around Sherlock to peer sun-blinded into the sitting room. In a moment his eyes adjusted to bring a Mycroft-shaped lump in the sitting room into focus.
“Mmm, that’s really good.” John licked his lips, chasing the last of the flavor.
After months of work, graduation day is finally upon them.
“Bastard. What’s his name. I’ll kill him. Where does he live?” John couldn’t help the anger that blazed over him.
“Of course.” Mycroft looked only slightly discomforted at the touch. He slipped his phone away.
“All right then. Sherlock, it is good to have you over again, dear.”
“No matter. So, how are things with you, dear lady?”  Sherlock locked up to focus on Molly. She had her hair up in a new hairstyle. It looked good on her.
“Prophets, come here.” John reached for Sherlock, pulling him unceremoniously to the floor.
“Good. We can start tonight.” Sherlock looked all together too pleased with himself.
“YES. That’s it! Well, not tribal markings but just as good as! Gang signs!”  Sherlock’s eyes flared to life.
“Mmmm.” John bit down into the side of his Cornetto, glorying in the flavor of ice cream, chocolate and nuts blending in perfect harmony. “God, I haven’t had one of these in ages.”
“I need you,” John growled, grabbing his arse with both hands, something he’d wanted to do since they stood kissing by the beach.
“Can I open my eyes?” John asked as the door swung closed behind them.
“I’m sorry too, Sherlock. It wasn’t supposed to be so much work for you.” Mrs. Watson said with a small smile.
Teddy raised an eyebrow John's way, and wordlessly chomped a bite from his toast half.
“Oh, I haven’t heard of that,” the older lady spoke up.
After settling their wagers, Sherlock led John to seats farthest away from the knots of men smoking like chimneys, and yelling themselves hoarse at the two men swinging at each other. Sherlock had to admit, the fight was a compelling sight. The men weren’t beautiful in a classic sense, and neither were their moves disciplined, but there was something about their muscled, scarred forms twisting and striking, a dance of back and forth that had him riveted. They wore no protective padding besides the strips of cloth wound about their knuckles, and tight leggings, but they had removed their earrings in concession to the match. Sherlock was so used to the chains hanging from the ears of all the Bajorans that he knew, that this omission made the fighters look more naked to him than if they had been truly stripped bare. One of them had words tattooed across his back, and Sherlock squinted trying to read it. Something in Bajoran.
“Actually.” Sherlock cleared his throat, dropping his feet to the floor to sit upright. “John and I were thinking of doing a late check-out, having another swim in the pool. We can catch a cab when we need to go.”
“Lavender,” Sherlock corrected.
Sherlock looked up from where he was stirring a large steel pot of something bubbling over the hob. He had safety goggles on, smushing his wildly frizzing hair back on both sides.
“Oh, brilliant, a cave!” John cried.
“Don’t mind if I do.” Sherlock took John’s arm firmly with both hands.
John thought as he searched through his supplies for more dandelion.
“Fine, yeah, really good.” John nodded, blowing across his drink before taking a sip.
“More like the Elder Wand,” Dom said, elbowing him.
“No, thanks, I’ll just wait for Sherlock to get back.” John retreated to the bedroom. He made the bed and settled on top of the covers to read a book he pulled off Sherlock’s shelf.  When John’s stomach rumbled loudly, he abandoned the book, deciding to go out.
“I’m full of good ideas.” John smiled, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s chest.
When the camera left its close up, drawing back to take in more of the Omega’s body, Sherlock almost growled in outrage. Still the view of the man arching his back as his hand worked between his legs had its own charms.
“But, Sherlock, your bond-mate.” His eyes held a world of pain.
“Look, it’s been a long trip.” John bent to retrieve the large duffle he’d dropped, slinging it over one shoulder, and grabbed  the handle of his wheeled suitcase. “If you want to complain about getting a single, go ahead, but I’m going to get settled for now.”
John couldn’t properly see underwater without goggles on, but he tracked the body splashing along beside him as his arms sliced into the water, his legs kicking with all he had. Sherlock was good. He pulled ahead instantly, long-limbed thing, but they evened out as they had to slow to navigate the shallows. As they pushed off from the side, Sherlock paused, fumbling, and John soared ahead, easily making the other side several strokes before Sherlock’s long arm reached out for the edge.
“Well, it’s just that it’s a bit rude.” The Little Hobbit shuffled his furry feet against the ground hoping to stave off the inevitable. “I’d rather not say it aloud.”
Mycroft wasn’t sure if he was meant to be answering something. He simply whined.
“John.” Sherlock’s eyes darkened as his eyes drank him in.
“Thank you.” Mycroft turned back to glance at John and Sherlock. “Shall we?” He swept his hand out to the right toward a long corridor that must lead to the conservatory.
Mycroft waited, poised on the precipice of something monumental.
“Yes, about that. We’ve an extra suite we don’t need, so you boys are welcome to it,” Mrs. Holmes said.
“Alright, your turn.”
“We’ve been around the island a number of times, and nothing of note has presented itself. Our trip through the maze inside though, navigating in the dark to find these rooms, that was quite a trek.”
“Where you are going is none of your concern, Bajoran.” Sherlock turned toward John, letting the last word drawl out like an insult. “All you need know is that as of now, you are guests of the Obsidian Order.”
“Well, you know how it is when you’re ill. You just want your own bed. I . . .” Sherlock’s heart sank when a familiar voice hailed them.
“The doesn’t sound like much of a plan.”
Sherlock leaned up, craning his neck to see the clock.
“You’ve had lovers . . .” Sherlock trailed off.
“Wasn’t hungry.”
“That sounds acceptable.”
, this wasn’t a bar, it was a brothel, and a gay one at that. Sherlock swallowed, hard, feeling a sudden heat rise over him.
John clamped down on the words bubbling up his throat, and managed a thin smile.
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock found himself replying automatically as a thin trickle of fear unspooled along his spine.
“Thank you.” Sherlock’s tense shoulders eased downward.
“It’s okay if I tell them we’re together now?” John raised an eyebrow.
Irene flashed a genuine smile the man's way, and sashayed into the deep bass of the dubstep rolling out over the main room. She took a moment to scan the place, quickly getting a lay of the land. A central bar lit in blue lights dominated the open space, people, mostly men clumped around it clutching their drinks in sweaty glasses. Irene ignored that to walk a slow circuit around the perimeter.
“Alright.” The mattress shifted as Sherlock’s weight moved off the bed.
“Here, put your arm around me.” Sherlock moved in, threading an arm around John's middle. “Let me take your weight.”
“Yeah, sure.” John brightened, slipping off his perch to follow.
“Yes, I’m sure you’re right.” Irene nodded.
“I need to know what he said to you.”
?” Harry shook her head as she made her way to the door. She turned for a parting scowl. “Fifteen minutes.”
“Yes?” A woman’s voice came from inside after a minute.
John didn’t mean to kiss Sherlock in the lobby in front of everyone pulling their bags past, but before he knew it, they were twined together, and John was dissolving under Sherlock’s sweet kisses, those plump lips caressing his over and over.
“Don’t go. Please.” John's voice cracked.
Sherlock couldn’t help himself, he leaned down to lay a kiss to John’s forehead. “Go on, be a good boy and eat your fruit, and I’ll have a treat for you afterwards.”
“Alright.” Sherlock found a kitchen chair, sitting still while John daubed the cool arnica gel around his eye.
Or you can turn back around,
“You like calling me that, don’t you?” Sherlock slurred beneath him.
“You’re welcome.”
“Oh, GOD,” John sucked in a breath. “I love you.”
“Sherlock do you love me?” John gripped his shoulder.
. He’s come down, rattled the bars, had his say. Now he’ll go back to his lair in London and if we’re lucky, we won’t see him until the next seasonal inspection.”
“Oh, not you too.” John groaned.
Sherlock set the car in motion, slotting it smoothly into gear as he revved it into first. Again, John felt transfixed, watching his long, pale, clever fingers manipulating the gearshift, turning the wheel. They were leaving East Dean, and back on country lanes before John found his tongue again.
“Victory,” Teddy echoed, grinning foolishly at the two of them as he lifted his own glass in toast.
“Are you hurt? Fucking hell, tell me if you’re hurt.” John lay on his belly to better hang over the lip, and peer at him.
“I thought about everything I wanted to do to you when I got my hands back on you.”
“No, of course not why?”
“John, take care, son.” Mr. Holmes had moved around the table to shake his hand. “You’re always welcome with us. Whenever.”
“I’m not sure I want honey in the bed.” Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
“That’s right,
“John?” A velvety baritone rolled in from the nearby pillow.
“What IS that?” the shorter, rounder boy asked.
“I want to watch you touch yourself.”
“Look, I’m sorry, but I have to go now.” John shifted his weight nervously. “You need to use the front door, and I need to use the back.”
“Faster than that?” Furel cried.
(*w*)
Sherlock took a deep breath.
“Would you mind getting my hands free?” John rattled at the hand cuffs.
Finding things of Sherlock’s had been even harder to deal with. Even after he thought he’d purged it all, John still found a letter Sherlock had written jammed into the back of a book as a page marker, and a photo of the two of them at Sherlock’s graduation of all things.
Sherlock looked wryly down at his uniform. “It was somewhat inevitable. But you . . . John what have you been doing?”
“No.” Sherlock shook his head. “That was my idea. I was still sick, at loose ends. I needed something to keep myself busy, and an article I read in a journal about the recent decline of the bees stuck with me. I decided to try my hand at apiology. I soon had so much honey on my hands though that I needed to find some reasonable way of getting rid of it.”
“Yeah, he was a wanker.” Harry blew out her own breath.
“Yer, a bastard, John Watson, a right bastard!” Owen declared tilting the bottle to take a drink.
“No sir, sorry sir.” They straightened to full attention.
“Harry!” Mrs. Watson chided automatically as she set plates around the table.
“Oh, well, good then.” John wasn’t quite sure what else to say, and the two returned to their separate pursuits on their computers.
He barely heard the knock at the door, and only startled slightly when John popped his head in.
“Yes?” Sherlock looked more bright-eyed than he had a moment before.
“Yeah, but I always wanted to order room service.”
“The biggest.” Claudette whispered.
Sherlock noticed that the car had begun to circle around, heading back to the base.
John, Teddy, and Owen had plans to share a flat together in London, and had a few places to check out once they returned home. Tom and Dom would only be a portkey or floo network ride away a bit farther north. It wasn’t impossible that they’d all get together, but it was definitely a breaking up of the old group, the ending of an era.  John blinked his eyes to clear them as he gave Tom a final handshake.
“Magic swirled around her as she pointed a long, bony finger at the know-it-all. ‘I curse you to wear the pain on your skin that you have caused others. May you bear the shape of a monster until you can know true compassion.’
“Oh Mr. Holmes, forgive me I don’t mean to intrude, but I saw you, and I simply HAD to come and thank you.”  She grabbed Mycroft’s hand to pump it vigorously up and down.
“Jesus, Sherlock.” John’s voice had gone reed thin.
“None of that for a few days.” Kira Nerys had slipped into the room behind them. “Well, a girl sleeps in one morning, and all hell breaks loose when she isn’t watching.”
Just watching them gambol around made Sherlock feel about a hundred years old. He rubbed the back of his neck and sighed. Prophets, he’d be happy to wrap this up and return home. Still, they were making good progress with their scavenging, and already had a number of useful things to bring back to the farm. Sherlock shook off his tiredness, and moved to investigate what looked like a collection of old engine parts lying near the fence that circled the yard.
The kitchen held its usual hubbub of noise, and good smells. The kitchen girls rolled out dough, sending clouds of flour around the room as they worked. Mrs. Watson looked up from the large pot she was stirring on the stove.
“PERFECT, let’s go introduce . . .” Bill started.
“No, of course, love. Go, get your bees sorted. I’m still unpacking here.” John gestured to the tangle of clothes he had piled on the bed.
“Well, hello there. I thought this might be the elusive JOHN, but one hates to presume.” Irene darted forward to grab John’s hand, shaking it warmly. The form-fitting robe she wore scooped scandalously low over her bosom, and John’s eyes fell naturally to the skin on display.  “I’ve heard so much about you.”
Sherlock nodded. He forced himself to say it then. “John, you’re bisexual, with a strong tendency toward forming long-term romantic connections with women exclusively.”
“Thanks, mate.” John helped himself to one before passing it to the twins. The crumbly sweetness burst over his tongue as he bit into it. “Oh, these are good. Tell your mum to send more.”
“I think we need to get more sheets, or more towels,” John said as they pulled on shirts and pants for sleeping.
“Oh, you’re working. Here? Today?” John raised his eyebrows, looking quickly around.
John shook his head, trying to clear it. “Anyway, they’ll probably have the bed situation sorted in a couple of days, get two twins back in there.”
“Yes?” He turned, happy for another chance to speak with him.
“I’d love to.” John beamed, quickly getting the directions to the place Bianca suggested.
“How are you? I haven’t seen you in forever!” Molly greeted him with a smile.
“You all right?” John asked quietly, his voice the only real thing in the dark.
The Wizard families looked much more comfortable with their surroundings of course. Teddy’s grandmother, an elegant older woman chatted easily with the Potters though the Middlestons, Tom and Dom’s parents, looked utterly starstruck to be eating with celebrities.  Victoire sat next to Teddy, having stayed behind to watch his graduation, and John felt a pang go through him at the sad looks on her face all through the dinner. Teddy had already informed everyone he’d only be following part of their grand tour, returning to the U.K. to spend the last fortnight with Victoire before his new position began.
“Let’s hope it’s something easy to repair if it is a malfunction,” Sherlock said as they neared the sheds. “Sometimes glitches arise when you combine alien technologies.”
“What?” John sputtered.
“Yes, yes, John,” Sherlock gasped out.
“I’ll put in a word with Kira, if that’s your wish,” Sherlock said finally.
Harry blanched a bit. “Naw, Clara went back to her old girlfriend. I mean we only went out a few times.  I wasn’t too surprised that she ended up with Jamie. I think it was due to that bit of magic Sherlock did that she went out with me at all.” Harry finished her smoke with one long last inhale, and leaned over to stub it out on the stone floor.  “Speaking of that posh tosser. There’s someone I’d really like to pop. Pulling you to the dark side, and then dropping you like yesterday’s news?  I’d knock his block off if I could. How dare he?”
“So, are you from the area, dear, or just here on holiday?”
“Shhhhh. It’s alright. I’m fine, I’m fine.” John’s hands soothed over him, stroking along his back as he moved them to the bed.
Sherlock wasn’t a child any longer. He knew the shape of things.
He slicked his fingers, bringing the wet to paint over Sherlock’s entrance, before gathering another cold stripe to quickly slick his own cock. They cried out in unison as John sank in to the hilt, bringing their bodies flush. They moved in accord, soft and slow, trying to get closer, ever closer, as they rocked and moaned, finally picking up the tempo to finish. Sherlock lay open mouthed, and spent, groaning as John grunted out his release.
“I told them we’d met at a computer camp I attended two summers ago. We’d been keeping a ‘long-distance’ relationship going every since.”
“Ow!” Sherlock turned, a frown scrunching up the bridge of his nose. He pulled the headphones off his ears. “What do you think . .”
“John, would you join me out here, please?”
― Henry David Thoreau
“Hard to tell.” Sherlock shrugged. “But there are always those around, paying attention. Best to keep that in mind at all times.”
“Perhaps the clue is something to do with the titles and we don’t need the actual books.” Sherlock furrowed his brow. “Rings? Kings? Towers?”
When he came back to himself, Sherlock was holding him, long fingers caressing over his back.
John sat up straighter when he realized it was none other than the famous Harry Potter.  Of course, he’d almost forgotten he was Teddy’s godfather. It made sense he’d be here today.  For all the legend surrounding Potter, John found him a rather unassuming looking man. Still, he gave a rousing, inspirational speech, and everyone cheered loudly when he was done.
“Oh GOD. Do you listen to yourself?” Sadiq rolled his eyes.
“Ooff.” Sherlock caught him, letting his hands splay over John’s back as he absorbed his weight, keeping them both upright.
“Sorry, Shanna, have to go. Need to take my great-auntie home.”  John grinned widely, catching Sherlock’s hand in the crook of his elbow.
Together they got both of the beds shoved against the wall on Sherlock’s side, and then slid John’s dresser against the other side to wedge it in. They kicked off shoes, and crawled onto the bed, settling on each side before gingerly rolling to meet in the middle. John slid his hand over Sherlock’s hip. The mattresses didn’t move, but they dipped uncomfortably at the center line.
The other two servers turned their way. They looked if not hostile, at least very surprised to see a Cardassian among them.
“Ah. Well, it certainly fits.”
“How do you do? John Watson.” John stepped forward, extending a hand brightly to Mr. Holmes.
“Or at least a fortnight,” Dom joked.
“I bump into  . . . mutual acquaintances from time to time, and  . . . hear news of you.”
There was no way Sherlock’s mother could read John’s mind, but he felt a wave of embarrassment crest over him all the same.
John jogged back into position, a grin stretching from ear to ear as his teammates reached out for high fives.
Sherlock made sure to tidy up his experiments in the lab space. No doubt Mycroft would have minions sent in to ready the facility for its next use, but he felt loathe to leave anything personal lying about. He gathered what notes seemed useful before moving to meet John in the kitchen. A feast of epic proportions was already laid out over the table as John brought the last of something over from the stove.
“You know I can’t tell.” John laughed, turning toward her. “Wish won’t come true if I do.”
“Well, I . . .” Sherlock looked flummoxed. “John, are you hungry?”
Irene’s place was an odd collection of different eras of house all cobbled together. It was overly warm after the chill outside, and the sheer mass of bodies, lights and noise nearly overwhelmed Sherlock as they pushed into the fray. It was of course much larger inside than it looked from the street.
Sherlock made his way mechanically through the next few weeks, telling everyone who asked that he was fine, just a touch of flu. Sherlock asked John not to share his bad news. They held a simple, private ceremony in their bedroom to honor his father, and then got on with things.
“I volunteer to be your regular partner,” Sherlock said in a rush.
“How old were you?”
“Good night, John.”
“John, if this isn’t too forward . . .” the lovely man stammered, cheeks flushed, his lips swollen, looking like sex on a plate.
“Good,” John said. “You still need to add a few pounds.” He frowned slightly. “I thought we had a deal, two proper meals a day.”
John couldn’t remember spending time with so many Magic folk before outside of school. People apparating in and out, floating objects, magical sweets, and all manner of fantastic goings-on felt oddly comfortable to him now. His time spent at Uptown Realty was starting to feel quite distant, like some half-remembered bad dream.
Sherlock turned away. “I have some things to do. I’ll catch a cab home.”
John gathered up the sad specimens as Sherlock moved to rummage in the cabinet by the sink.
As John’s fingers pushed at the tiles, one swung easily away from the wall, revealing the shallow recess inside.
“Oh, THAT was Mycroft. Well. He’s a bit something, isn’t he?”
After Kurt left, John dished up a plate of the pasta, and ate it alone at the table. He left the rest mixed together in a pot on the stove in case Sherlock was hungry when he got home. Eventually, John stretched out on Sherlock’s bed with a book to wait for his to return. He fell asleep without meaning to again, waking up alone in the dim light of an overcast day.
“John, I’m hungry.” He wrinkled his brow. “I’m hardly ever this hungry.”
“Yeah, well, it won’t hurt me just to see what the class went over Friday.” John accepted the notebook from Mike. “Thanks.”
“Alright, how about you? What would you have done if there hadn’t been an occupation?”
“No, no, I’ve come this far. I might as well see if I can track him down.” John pulled himself to standing, moving to fetch the duffle he’d dropped by the door.
“I know you can.” John squinted up at him. You really are Father Winter, love. It’s just going to be a pain in the arse to replace all these pipes.”
“Okay, I understand.” John took a sip of his tea before setting it aside to eat the banana.
.” Sherlock took the basket, calling John’s mother, auntie, as he often did when his parents weren’t around.
“Excellent, John, you’ve made good progress.”
“I know. I know, John, it’s good to see you too.”
John was completely chagrined when he realized he didn’t know. How could he have failed to learn the name of the angel currently lying in his bed?
“Hullo.” John managed to wave weakly.
Sherlock pressed forward, and the two of them sank to the floor, half on the cushions and half on the rug. They rolled together, kissing wildly, grappling to hold each other ever closer. Sherlock felt like he just might explode from the feelings rattling through him threatening to shake him apart, and he gasped, completely overwhelmed. John wrapped him in arms as sturdy as steel, and gradually Sherlock settled, his ear crushed to John’s chest listening to the steady whump of his heart.
“Have you had breakfast?” John squinted up at Sherlock backlit by the sun.
The light was on over the hob as they usually left it, but so was the strip of lights over the sink, as none other than Mycroft Holmes leaned against the worktop reading a tablet as he waited for the kettle to boil. He wore a pair of navy, plaid pyjamas that looked as prim and proper as the suit he’d had on earlier, but the over-all effect was completely ruined by the pair of thick, fuzzy red socks with white polka dots on his feet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What, and miss the show?” The blonde girl laughed, refusing to be budged.
“War is always brewing somewhere.” Sherlock sniffed. “What’s that to do with me.”
“Let me make it up to you.”
“It went viral last night,” Irene said.
.” Sherlock let the last word draw out, hissing between his teeth as he pressed John's arms back down.
“Oh, don’t be an idiot,” Irene chided, swatting his knee with her hand bag. “Kate loves company, and we hardly ever have anyone over. Do come up.” Irene knew Sherlock had only an empty flat to go home to.
“Alright.” Sherlock let John pull him back down, collapsing.
“Try it out on whom?”
“I’m sorry, John, I’ve some errands to do.” Sherlock had surveillance duty planned. Technically, he should already have already started it, watching the movements of Mr. Big Brit, but John had thoroughly distracted him from it.
The woman looked disappointed, but after a few more flirtatious quips, finally provided them with a slip of paper and miraculously departed.
“So, tell me, what leads do we have on this woman? How are you planning on finding her from a few seconds in a news clip?”
“At least you wrapped it up well. No worries, son, you’ll be back, right as rain, in a day or two.”
“Okay,” John cleared his throat, holding the page upright, “Once upon a time there lived a young prince known as Sir Boast A Lot. It wasn’t his real name, but he was such an insufferable know-it-all, bothering everyone about the castle, that someone called him the nick-name and it stuck. Soon no one even remembered what the prince was actually called. Despite the name, the prince continued sticking his nose in where it didn’t belong. One day a woman, a distant relation, came to visit the castle. Unbeknownst to the prince, the woman was a powerful sorceress. When the prince insulted her that night at dinner, revealing private facts about herself for all and sundry to hear, the woman was enraged.”
“The ministry doesn’t actually have a trace spell on each underage Wizard.  There’s just a spell in place to monitor magic done in any Muggle households with an underage Witch or Wizard living there.” Sherlock rolled up to sitting, and crossed his legs under the covers. “With me visiting, Mycroft would have had the trace lifted.” He shrugged.
“I realized I like boys more than girls.”  Rhys looked a bit chagrined.
“And your eyes, your beautiful eyes. They’re like beach glass, they change in the light. I
“Speaking of romance,” Molly smiled, “I wondered if anything was up with you and Sherlock?”
“Hamish,” John spouted out.
“Yes, okay.”
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t like. It’s not a checklist.” Sherlock looked frustrated that John was being so slow. “It would be about finding out what we both like.”
“Well, if this is the response you get each time you go out, I can certainly see why you pull so many partners.” Sherlock took another sip of his coffee, finding it cooler, but still too bitter despite all the sugar he had dumped in. His gaze drifted down to follow the lines of John’s shirt. It was on the tight side, and he could just make out the curves of John’s defined biceps straining against the fabric. Sherlock swallowed half his cup down in one go without meaning to.
“She was a first year.” Rory shrugged. “Couldn’t hold her liquor.”
Sherlock studied the boy before him, the long lines of his arm as he lifted his hand to take a drag from his cigarette. The end of it glowed briefly like an angry firefly in the shadows. He was already half hard, Sherlock could see the lines just beginning to tent the placket of his finely cut trousers. He wanted to put his mouth on him. It wouldn’t take much, just Sherlock bending down, not even touching, just warm, moist air ghosted over the expensive wool, and the boy would be hard, hard as steel and ready to go. He might even let Sherlock work his fingers into his flies, pulling the sides away to release his cock and put it into his mouth. If he were that far gone, he’d do it, let Sherlock suck him off. He’d call him a freak afterward of course, backhand him for his presumptive cheek. It had happened before. Sherlock shifted his mouth, ran a tongue over his teeth. He didn’t fancy earning a cut off one tonight.
Sherlock was pleased to note that little had changed at the Watsons’ home since his last visit, and no sneakoscopes or other spy devices had appeared about the place. Perhaps Mycroft was finally easing up. Sherlock was legally an adult for goodness sake. It’s not as if he needed an older brother mollycoddling him forever.
“Yes, I think so.” John rasped out, gratefully taking a sip from the glass. “I’m sorry I don’t know what I was thinking to drink from a strange goblet like that.”
“Quite right.” Sherlock nodded.
*Back in the bedroom, John turned the combination lock to read SPINALIRRITATION. To his delight, it opened, revealing a shallow compartment in the bottom of the drawer. John removed the manilla envelope it contained.
Sherlock barely restrained himself from pushing John behind him, and punching the man’s lights out.
Somehow Sherlock maneuvered John through the hall and into the room.
“Oh, I like this kind.”
John knew now that he had a dry cleaners in town do most of his laundry, delivering it to the dorm on Thursdays. John tried to not to stare. He couldn’t help envisioning an overlay of the man in his tights, moving across a room, the well-developed muscles of his thighs flexing as he leapt . . .
Eventually the two pups settled their frenetic romp, and John leaned over Oscar to take his prick into his mouth. It was a bit awkward without hands to help, but the licking and sucking was joyful, and Oscar was clearly ecstatic with John’s attentions, writhing back into the duvet, his mouth open in an O. John couldn’t establish a rhythm to bring Oscar to a release, and eventually they flipped, Oscar returning the favour, working his lips and tongue over John’s ample charms. John groaned beautifully as Oscar’s mop of blond  hair dragged over his belly while his tongue licked down his length. They looked so lovely together, the gold of John’s skin complimenting the milk-white of Oscar’s long limbs. Sherlock leaned in, elbows on his knees to get just a bit closer.
John moved his hands over Sherlock’s lovely skin, admiring the odd freckle or mole. He wanted to memorize them all. He ran his hands over his trapezius and deltoid muscles, squeezing as he went, marveling at how beautifully put together Sherlock was, all long, lean sinew and ropy muscle.
and typed in one set of numbers after another. To the surprise of neither, none of the previous combinations they’d used worked to unlock the door of the Cold Storage room.
“Oh, and what pray tell do you think you should be doing with yourself?” Mycroft narrowed his eyes. “Becoming a professional gambler? Or perhaps you’d do well as an actor on the vid screen what with all the dissembling you do around here.”
By late afternoon, the caterers had a large purple tent erected on the lawn beside the house, and the guests began arriving in earnest. Sherlock lent John one of his older dress robes, he had so many, that Marie had taken up earlier to fit, and they left the safety of Sherlock’s room to enter the fray. A buffet of nibbles appeared on a row of tables outside as a bright anti-gravity bounce house hunkered nearby to entertain any small children in tow.
“Harry, John’s right.” Sherlock sighed. “It’s a world of trouble putting spells on unsuspecting non-Magic people. It’s not worth it.”
They’d had some rows. Blistering, epic rows. John had been furious when an experiment of Sherlock’s had filled the flat with acrid black smoke, or when Sherlock had thrown out all of John’s old pants to replace them with a newer, more expensive variety. “Jesus, Sherlock, next time ASK FIRST, alright?” John would stomp off to the pub, and return hours later, walking slightly crooked, but calmer. They’d always climb into bed to apologize, and things would seem better in the morning.
“More lemonade?” John asked brightly, lifting the bottle. He refilled Harry’s glass when she waggled it.
“We just needed a little queer eye for the straight guy, huh?” The city boy said, Rupert, John recalled his name, the one he’d been stuck chatting with at the rehearsal dinner.
“Why not? You enjoy the fantasy of being dominated.”
“Noooo, of course not, that’s for Uncle Mycroft to do,” John purred against his belly.
“Our orders clearly state we’re meant to get him back to HQ,
Sherlock flushed happily, and scooped up John’s hand again to press a kiss to the back of it.  “John do you want to order pudding  . . . “ He let the question trail off.
“That’s it! No one is allowed to speak to John again.” Sherlock angled himself to stand slightly in front. “You’re all being utterly insufferable, and unspeakably crass!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If you want to wait, we could postpone . . .”
“What was all that about?” Teddy whispered nudging him in the ribs.
“No, me either. Certainly not of this top caliber.”
“Wicked!” The taller of the boys exclaimed from across the room. Alastaire and John moved to look over their shoulders, peering at their find. “See that!” The boy pointed to a row of hideous shrunken heads lining a cupboard shelf.
Sherlock struggles to solve the clues, but John helps uncover things, remaining a conductor of light.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Am I your boyfriend?”  Sherlock looked up, surprised.
“Sherlock. What is all this?” John’s mouth fell open as dropped his bag on the ground, turning slowly to survey the room.
Sherlock snuffled in at John’s belly, burrowing in. He leaned away just enough to lift John’s shirt, and zeroed back in, this time his lips pressing kisses against John’s bare skin.
“John, how do you feel?”  Sherlock’s head of tangled curls popped up to fill his line of view.
Mycroft’s recorded message continued “ . . . you are now considered fit to return to society at large. Sherlock, my generous offer still stands for employment, but you are free to chose or discard the opportunity as you see fit. Your accounts will be available to you once more as soon as you reach the mainland.  And Doctor Watson . . .”
“What?” Sherlock asked, wondering how silly he looked. “What’s wrong.”
“Yeah, good.” John flexed his limbs, finding himself well caught. Rather than struggle, he relaxed into the feeling.
“Sherlock.” John grabbed one of those lovely, long pale hands in his own.
“And I think they are— That is to say… I…” John sighed. “Look, Sherlock, I don’t care how we met. The fact is, we did. And whether or not we wear rings, or whether it makes your brother thrilled or miserable...well, I don’t really give a toss about that.”
John raced upstairs to the bedroom, but the bed was empty, still made up from yesterday. He ran through the house calling Sherlock’s name, but no one answered. When he made it back to the living room, he spied his phone still on the coffee table, and thumbed it to life, checking his messages. There was finally a text from Sherlock.
“John.” Sherlock looked almost surprised to find him reading in the kitchen. “There you are.”
“Oh God, Sherlock. I love you too.”
John lay sprawled on the grass, breathing in deeply, enjoying the smell of green things reawakened. Teddy had the best ideas he thought as he bit into a jam biscuit. He glanced toward the lake, and chuckled at the wand duel Teddy and Owen were enjoying. Owen had just zinged in a hit that left Teddy with a large purple horn spiraling out of his forehead. Teddy frowned a bit in concentration, and the horn simply shrank away.
John continued to turn wide, sad eyes his way.
“Mmmm, that is good,” Sherlock said, a fire twinkling in his eyes as he crossed to the bed.
Sherlock sighed and gave in, letting himself go limp and very quickly falling asleep.
“Didn’t you hear? It. Won’t. Work.” Sherlock rounded on him. “I should have admitted it from the start. This isn’t the right solution.” He moved away to pace in a tight track, waving his arms. “I can’t get an accurate enough reading for it to be meaningful. I know the coordinates given are on the island, but there’s no way I can pinpoint it to any degree of accuracy . . . this was useless.”  He moved back to give the cross another swift kick, miscalculated, and promptly fell on his arse.
“Well, acting DOES come in handy occasionally in detective work. It helps to have a variety of skills.”
“John, I know this is sudden, and you’re free to say no, but I could use an assistant in my line of work. Your military and medical training could come in handy . . .” Sherlock trailed off at the odd look on John’s face. “What?”
“Yes, of course. Boys, this is Nigel Beedles, he’s our top agent. Come and say hello, dear.” She waved the man over.
“You won’t get ANY food this good in London,”  John said forking up another bite with completely different flavours.
Sherlock made a small cry when the slat slid open and a metal cylinder fell into his palm.
“You came.”  Sherlock grinned in reply, dropping his legs to sit taller. With Sherlock on the stool, they were almost of a height, with John standing only slightly above him.
Sherlock had retrieved his fallen disruptor after John had left the park that night, and chivvied Anderson out of the damn pub to finish their watch before returning to base quarters. He didn’t have much privacy, sharing a room with a number of other soldiers, but he quickly found a small utilities closet with space to store things, and began “midnight requisitioning” supplies, lifting things when no one was watching.
Sherlock went back to his experiments in the morning, and they fell into a bit of a routine over the next few days. “Who you really are” remained up in the air as a puzzle to solve. One evening, they went through the CD’s trying to play each other songs they enjoyed to see if that sparked any ideas. John ended up trying to teach Sherlock to do the Macarena, and Sherlock insisted John get the rudiments of a Tango down. It was silly fun, but nothing clue-worthy came of it.
“Cheers!” John said as they touched the rims of their mugs of wine together.
“Oh everything, though I especially like the dozas.”
“Hmm, you’ve grown rather good at that.”
“I’m glad. You deserve to be better, John. You deserve everything. I have to admit . . .” Sherlock cleared his throat gone suddenly clogged. “I was on my third overdose when Mycroft had me sectioned this time.”
John and Sherlock had continued texting, and even called a few times in the intervening few days. Somehow though, seeing the man in person again was different. John hated to admit it, but he was nervous. What if it wasn’t as special as he was hoping? What it they’d sparked as a one off? The fabulous man might come to his senses and realize how very dull John actually was.  John adjusted his collar and debated trying a different shirt.
They spent some time going over all of the chess pieces and the board looking for hidden compartments, secret clues, markings, but after an hour, they decided it was nothing more than an ordinary chess game.
“Yes, please.”
“That could mean the cupboards downstairs where we first woke up,” John offered.
Oh God. Sherlock.
“It’s been a lovely room.” John turned to face Sherlock.
“You’ll think better. Digestion slows me down,” Sherlock clipped.
“Hmmm?” Sherlock turned unfocused, pale eyes his way.
, John thought wryly, smiling soppily when Sherlock slanted his ocean-coloured eyes his way.
“It isn’t like him to walk off a job like that without another one to go to. Something’s up.”
“We can do it.” Sherlock said, petting down John’s back. “It’s only a few more months. You can apply to hospital programs here when you graduate.”
He had vanilla ice cream smeared all over his perfect cupid’s bow of a lip when he retreated. It was John’s turn to watch mesmerized as the tip of Sherlock’s tongue appeared to lick it clean.
“So what’s the case, then?” John asked around a mouthful of bread and chicken.
“It’s not like that.” John shook his head. “I told you, there’s lots of sleeping around in the ranks. You have to grab life while you can. It’s harmless.”
“Nope. I’m not complaining, either. This is the most fun I’ve had in… well, ever.”
So sorry it was three months since my last update! Real life - meh. I hate when it gets in the way of fic writing! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sherlock peeled the covers back, and joined John squatting on the floor. Rather than tackle the main pile, he worked his wand from the trousers he’d had on the night before. “Accio John’s clothes.” He said with a quick wave.
“A match?” Sherlock flashed a look at John again.
"Wait. Not the dildo."
to Los Angeles?”
John fought his way to the bar. All they had was fizzy water, so he requested a beer for himself and a fizzy water for Sherlock. By the time he’d made his way back to the bridal party, the guests had finally all filed into the room, and they were free to mingle. John pressed the glass of water into Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock led John up the stairs suddenly feeling nervous at showing him the little bedsit he’d called home for the past four months. It wasn’t as if he’d spent any real time in the place, mostly leaving at dawn for work, and returning late at night to collapse into the bed, but still . . .
“Oh, Sherlock, you’re bleeding.” John panted.
“Yeeees. Exactly like that.”
“John .  . .” Sherlock mumbled, half rousing as John pulled up the duvet.
“I better see who it is.” John squeezed his shoulder before extricating himself to go to answer it. “It’s probably Mike.”
"We played with his cords..."
John nodded quickly and began removing his clothing, which Sherlock carefully arranged beneath him as a buffer between his back and the frozen ground.
“Easy, son, just relax.” John looked up to see the kindly face of the man Mycroft had been with at dinner looming over him. “You’ve got a bezoar in your mouth. Just breathe normally and you’ll be fine.”
“Oh, John, relax. I never say anything upsetting,” Mrs. Hudson reassured him.
“Oi, stop that, you. People here.”  John flicked his eyes nervously around them.
“Oh, and you’re married.” Sherlock caught the flash of a ring on Molly’s finger.
“Well, you’ve got one here. Lay one on me, why don’t you?”
“Yeah, I wasn’t much older,” John said. “Sherlock, it can’t be helped. We all want what’s best for Bajor, but if someone isn’t fighting, they’re still at risk to be killed or enslaved in a sodding work camp.”
“Yeah, looks that way,” John said, hefting his bag higher over his shoulder.
“I didn’t realize you were back in England,” Sherlock blurted out in a rush.
“We’re together,” John finished lamely.
“True. We’ll have to thaw him out before we delve deeper.”
The sound of voices talking in the front room caught his attention. Someone new had arrived to the office. Well, perhaps it was not to be such a boring day after all. Sherlock listened to a loud, booming voice that sounded familiar, and the softer tones of the clerk answering. In a heartbeat, his fingers had flown to shut down all the windows on his screen, and replace them with a nice, safe diagnostic tool.
“I think I might have found a clue.”
“Thank you, John, this was delicious.”
Tall one ducked his head. “We, uh, we were just kidding around about the sneaking in . . .”
“Relax.” Sherlock was already reaching for the things, running his fingers over them. “We don’t have to actually USE any of these tools. We just need to search them. They might be another clue.”
“Give over.” John reached for one. He sniffed at it himself. “Yup. Paint thinner.”
“Jaaaawwn,” Sherlock groaned, fingers tightening in John’s hair to pull slightly. “Please, please . . .”
“Walk away, John,” Sherlock whispered from the side of his mouth.
“Did you say you were a doctor?” Greg asked, dropping a handful of sugar packets on the table.
When John felt his blood pressure settle, he turned off the bedside lamp, and they eventually fell back asleep, Sherlock with the ice pack propped against his face.
“Left shoulder.” John said into Sherlock’s chest. “It’s ugly, I don’t want to . . .”
The food was excellent however, and John lost himself in enjoying each course as it came out. Everyone ooh'ed appreciatively over the flaming scallops, and the exploding chocolate lava cake was as delicious as it was dramatic.
“I was thinking something more along the lines of sausage.” Sherlock’s eyes were twinkling as he snaked a hand down to grasp John’s quickly rising member.
“Oh, okay, good, thanks.” John nodded, his face a silhouette in the near dark.
“Fine,” Sherlock ground out through clenched teeth.
“Ooh, perhaps
“I know, John, I just wish . . .” Sherlock embarrassed himself by beginning to cry.
“I’d watch it, Mr.
“No, it’s no bother, sit, sit.”  The woman ushered him to a chair as she moved to turn on the kettle.  “Aren’t you a handsome one?”
“No, I want to.” Sherlock reached up to unfasten John’s belt, glorying in the feel of unzipping his jeans, and pushing his pants aside to feel his gorgeous hot cock spill out into his hand.
“John.”
“Hmmm.” Sherlock grunted, a plan already appearing in his mind of what experimental plant he might gift John with.
“No, it’s great.” John waved helplessly. “I’m glad you could come for a swim. Come on in, the water’s lovely.”
Sherlock continued scanning the crowd after the waiter moved on, drumming his fingers on the table as he waited. He scowled at a Bajoran youth bedecked in gold cuffs and pink bits of fluff who looked about to join him. The boy squeaked before scampering off.
“Bloody magnificent.” Rhys finished reaching out to touch John’s cheek. “Thank you.”
“You’re busy, I understand,” Sherlock said. “We all have things to do.”
“Yeah.” John cleared his throat, grateful for the distraction. “Sherlock graduated last year. I’ve still got one more year at school left.”
“Come on,” Kira said, leading the way as they jogged forward.
“Hey you two.” Harry pounded on the door. “Hurry up in there. I don’t want to be old and grey before we get out of here.”
Still, John felt an itchiness building between his shoulder blades. He spent long moments looking out the windows as Sherlock worked in his lab, watching the clouds scuttle across the sky. He wondered what he might have done differently in his life, and if it still would have brought him into Sherlock’s path.
John barked a short laugh. “Sherlock, I’ve lived you with for the better part of a term, I think I know you by now. That isn’t you.” John released Sherlock’s hand, reaching for the other.
“You got it.” Lupaza smacked a button on the side of the dash, and the truck lifted a meter off the ground, leaving the road to pitch nearly vertical as it skimmed down the side of the incline. Lupaza turned the steering bar sharply and they leveled off in a new directions, twisting and weaving between rock formations.
“Thanks so much,” John said. He couldn’t remember his own father showing him how to do much of anything. Except perhaps how to pop the top off of a beer bottle on the side of the kitchen bench.
“I just need a few things . .  .”
“No doubt,” Sherlock agreed. “What room are we in?”
They soon found a rather battered looking copy of the game in the back of the cupboard.
By the time the show ended with someone being voted off the competition, Sherlock was yelling insults at the recording. “Why did they get rid of the Yorkshire man? The woman from Bath was clearly the inferior baker. The judges are idiots.”
“Mmmm, beautiful man, my man,” Sherlock crooned in his ear, his fingers doing wicked things over John’s cock.
John made the tiniest sound of regret.
Hmm… Operation was pretty fun, but…”
“Was your mother really angry?”
“God, you!” John leaned in to kiss the beautiful man again.
“Yes, what . . .”
The portal slid open to reveal the clerk hovering nervously outside. “Sir, you’ve an urgent message coming through from high command?”
“I don’t know. Can we?” Sherlock muttered, cutting Mycroft a sharp glance.
“Did you take him up on it?”
“Blame her? Of course I do. This is practically sexual harassment. I mean certainly you’re an attractive man, but this is absurd.”
The man had moved dangerously close, his thumbs caressing over Sherlock’s hand, as the smell of him danced over Sherlock nose, a pungent mixture of cologne, alcohol, and musky sweat.   Sherlock blinked at him and swallowed, momentarily at a loss for words.
“It was a crazy time.” Molly waved a hand about. “I moved offworld with my own family to Enteros 9 for awhile.”
“Oh, sorry, must dash. John it was really good to meet you.” Evelyn reached for John’s hand. “It’s lovely to see you and Sherlock together.”
“Do what? Give me a chance? Give us a chance?”  John dropped the water bottle to take Sherlock’s hand in his own. It was ice cold. “Sherlock, please. Please let me try. Let us try.”  John warmed his frozen hand between his palms, something like hope kindling inside his chest.
“Sherlock?” John stepped toward him, uncertain.
“What do you think about Victor? Should we set them up?”
John tries his best not to tug too hard on his bindings, but this is driving him around the bend. Sherlock continues by going back up to his cock and running the edges of his teeth gently over the tip. John does his best not to giggle, but can’t suppress it.
He strained upward meeting each of John’s thrusts, a humming building under his skin . . . suddenly it was all too much. Sherlock fell apart with a cry, pumping out hot splashes. John drove into him with a few more thrusts before grunting out his own release. He collapsed heavily over Sherlock, lying as if stunned, while Sherlock waited for the world to coalesce back around them.  Sherlock squeezed his eyes tight feeling a tear sliding out from underneath the lids. Others joined.
“Yeah, good job, mate!”  Yet another male speaker.
“You’ve already taken anti-inflammatory medicine?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and dropped to John’s glass clearly asking the same question.
"Maybe I should spread these lovely legs and bind your ankles." Sherlock sits on his haunches between John's thighs to admire his captive. "You shaved them just for me." He runs his hands up John's calves, over his knees, and caresses the top of his legs. "So smooth."
“Want to touch you . . .” John murmured. “Please . . .”
John picked his way around the chaos of the other students moving into their rooms, narrowly missing a skateboard left in the middle of the corridor. He grinned when he spied a face he recognized and stopped to speak to Mike Stamford, a friend and fellow pre-med student. John was glad to find that Mike was on his same hall, just a few doors down from his number, 221. After a few minutes of sharing how their summers had been, Mike asked if John knew who his roommate was.
“Simple for you, maybe. Mental arithmetic was never my strong suit.”
“Look, can you two magic your way home or something?” She leaned close to whisper. “Clara’s asked me back to hers, and I want to get going.”
“Then GO!” Kira raised her arms, and the children scattered like small birds flying away.
They’d taken a picnic one nice afternoon to a park, and eaten sandwiches on a bench by the river.
“Steady on,” John said. “No way out but through.”
“There you’ve got what you came for. CLEAR OFF!” he bellowed, punctuating his roar with a blast of flame. The dwarves offered no dissent. They quickly grabbed their things and ran, obviously chalking up the Little Hobbit as lost, and were heard of no more.
Finally, before mid-day, Sherlock reappeared, needing John to help him unlock the front door to go out and continue his measurements. John sighed, trailing after Sherlock with his hands in his pockets. Sherlock stalked quickly off with his notebook ready to record another day’s numbers.
“People always have a choice.” Sherlock said darkly.
“Mycroft, I was terribly sorry to hear about your grandmother. She was a wonderful woman. I’m glad I got a chance to meet her.”
“I’ll warm it up,” Sherlock leered.
“How is that?” Sherlock’s deep, honeyed voice rumbled out soothingly.
Sherlock’s back arched up as John kept a steady march downward, laving and kissing his way down Sherlock’s body .
“Poncy bastard.” He complained  shifting the case slung over his back. “How many pairs of shoes does one bloke actually need?”
They manage to procure drinks, switching to fizzy water, and took them out to the courtyard to cool down a minute. White fairy lights shone invitingly in the small potted trees set around the edges, and a few outdoor heaters kept the partygoers milling about the space comfortable. The smell of burning tobacco drifted over from one corner where the smokers were allowed. John saw Sherlock lean unconsciously that way, and steered him toward a bench farthest away from them.
“What’s so funny? A pengwing is a perfectly good guess. If you’re trying to be a duck, you should put your hands up under your armpits.”
English: snowball
“Come here, you.” John pulled his head down for a goodbye kiss that threatened to tip into something altogether more time consuming when Mrs. Watson honked the horn.
“Okay, John.” Sherlock smiled as he lifted his pastry.
Sherlock’s veins turned icy. “Good afternoon, Gul Dukat.” He forced his face to calmness as the man cleared his throat, shifting to lean closer to the screen. Sherlock strained to listen for any activity in the corridor beyond his room. Were guards already gathering to come for him?
“Go left. We could drive near the beach.”
“Yes. Come on, we have to go before they take the next round of bets, and I have to be back at the library in time for my driver to pick me up.”
“Oh, right.” John watched as Sherlock snatched up the copy of “the Hobbit” to rifle through it. He had his doubts, but as Sherlock typed the words found, sense was actually emerging.
Although he wasn’t sure it would do any good, Sherlock had to try. Later, after the others had gone to sleep, he crept back to the console, and punched in a code, calling a private line.
“God, did you see that, did you see that goal?” John shook his head all the way back to the dorm when he’d finally been released.
“Yes, alright . . . okay . . . I understand.”
“Yeah, well  . . .” Suddenly John couldn’t bear to talk about Sherlock any longer. He felt a prickle building behind his eyelids, and he blinked hard. He’d be thrice damned if he’d start crying in front of sodding Mycroft Holmes.  “So, what brings you to Hogwarts for graduation?”
John shivered, and reached back to pull the plug.
“Yes, fine.” Sherlock winced at bit at making his aching body obey his commands. “I’ve been thinking though.”
“I don’t have anything here, we’ll have to go out.”
“I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that I’m not good at multi-tasking. I mean, hand jobs are easy — I’ve been practicing on myself since I hit puberty — but blow jobs take a bit more concentration. Every time I get you in my mouth, I feel like all of my attention is on what I’m doing to you, and how you’re responding. And yeah, it drives me wild, but it’s your pleasure that I’m getting off on, and having my own cock sucked at the same time would almost be a distraction. Does that make sense?”
“Yeah, I know, it’s a crap situation. They screwed up, left a bed from when they rented out the dorms over the summer.” John sighed. “We keep calling about it, and getting a run around. They’re really busy with start of term.”
The offices were on the other end of the athletic building, and John made his way through the many corridors that connected through. It wasn’t a section of the center that he usually frequented. His head turned as he heard a sultry pop tune coming from one of the rooms as he passed. It looked like a dance studio, and he glanced idly in the window on the door. The sight within stopped him in his tracks. Almost in a trance, John moved forward to stare inside.
“Not really hungry.” Sherlock flicked his eyes quickly over the laminated page. “Tea will do.”
“I understand.” Sherlock put his nearly empty mug down on the table with a clunk. “Perhaps we can arrange a place for me to simply drop off supplies.” He made to unload his bag completely, piling the things he’d brought on the ground. “I can go.”
“The point is accidents do happen. I know magic gets out of control sometimes. It’s all right.” The side of Mrs. Watson’s mouth hitched up slightly.  “You, however,” she rounded on Sherlock, “will need to stay out of the office for the duration.  It won’t make sense if everyone but Edith knows you’ve been there for two weeks.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to wince. “I might have. I was bored one afternoon. I need to keep my mind occupied. I pick up information all the time. Take you for instance.”
“Excellent work, Lor.” Sherlock closed the panel and passed it back to the boy. “You can put it with the rest of our collection.”
“We can be creative,” Sherlock added.
“No, no it’s fine. Come here.” John turned his attention back to Sherlock, greedy fingers pulling him into another searing kiss. John urged him down as they moved toward the bed, tumbling over to land on the mattress together. John wasted no time in crawling over him.
“A scientist.” Sherlock raised his chin defiantly. “I’d love to do some work with hyperbolic phase transmission. There are some fascinating new discoveries being made in the area, but the field is still wide open for advancement . . ."
“Yup, still here.” The man leaned in to drop a kiss to Sherlock’s nose. “You fucking gorgeous, amazing, best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“No, dear, you don’t want to hurt your back the day before the wedding.”
“I know, love, me too.” John ran a thumb over the back of Sherlock’s hand and tried not to think on tomorrow, hoping it might never come.
“Yes, he is. It will be a bit weird to finally meet him in person.”
But although John really did want to play, he was still caught up in thoughts of his previous disastrous attempt at 69. It was etched in his mind as one of his rare sexual failures — a painful and humiliating experience. Tentatively, he kissed Sherlock’s thigh.
“Oh, Harry is Harry.” His mom waved her wad of napkins in reply.
“Well, now that’s getting a bit scary.” John glanced around the room suddenly worried about cameras again. “Did you say we need a GPS device?”
“You know I would.” Sherlock softened to see his face.
“Nearly lost my damn trunks,” Sherlock admitted. “They were sliding right off.”
“What did ya do to the poor man?” Furel’s barrel form filled the doorway.
“Yeah, good, and you?”

“Can I come visit you on your side?” John asked.
“We could get a good price on rekja if we could find a way to sell it offworld.” Gant Izar, their new engineering head, leaned in to grab a small cake from the plate in the center.
. . . Sherlock moved back, feeling a flash of irritation flow through him. He had only wanted to go out for something hot for lunch, not enter a daytime vid drama.
“Fuck!” John breathed.
John bustled over him like a mother hen, checking over his injuries, and Sherlock let him, sighing as John ran a tissue regenerator over his cheek, and several sore areas across his ribs.
“How’s the investigation today?”
Sherlock has some news that might be good, and might be bad. It depends on John.
“My, my, my. Well, I’ve some big shoes to fill then.”
Life at the farm gets increasingly interesting as more people arrive to join them.
“God, love you,” John panted when he could speak again. “Love you.” He pressed open mouthed kisses across Sherlock’s face.
The other two boys sat down on the floor with a thump looking terrified.
“I love you, too.” John gathered him close, dropping a kiss to his forehead like a blessing. “I’m sorry I had to bring you here.”
“Good night, John. Love you,” Sherlock whispered.
“Come on then. I’ve already sent a security team there.”
“Ach, yer too polite,” John said. “If you really want to talk to someone you leave the workplace behind, and you stalk their house. There’s yer story.”
“So did you meet in a club? I used to love to go dancing. I’d be out till dawn back in the day.” Mrs. Hudson smiled, sitting down with her own cup.
“I don’t understand.”
Twenty minutes — and one very confused John Watson — later, they turned their plastic game units around to show each other.
They toppled over onto the mattress. Sherlock was suddenly desperate to have them skin to skin, reassuring himself that John was really here, and whole. They moved apart for just a moment to strip bare, coming back together in a rush. It was an explosion of bliss to seal himself over John, pressing them tightly together.
Sherlock saw red.
The flowers of the garden nearly glowed in the buttery afternoon light cascading down. The sun seemed to be making a special appearance just for them. Sherlock shook off the fanciful notion, and showed John to the gardening shed where he kept his supplies.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock murmured as the woman moved to speak to some jewel-bedecked women sitting farther down.
“Molly.” The girl reached out to shake her hand with a firm grip before releasing her.
“Is that alright?” John licked a stripe up the underside, enjoying the heft of him on his tongue enormously. Sherlock’s cock was long and elegant like the rest of him.
The off-time train was only partially filled. They found seats easily enough, and settled in for the trip. Sherlock instantly popped open his laptop and got working, but John enjoyed kicking back, watching the scenery sliding past the windows. A thick morning mist had settled over the green fields, giving everything a blurry, impermanent feeling as if they were adrift in some magical faery realm instead of traveling on the 7:05 train from Brighton to Cardiff Central.
Sherlock pulled out the phone, and after a modicum of trial and error managed to switch it on. Sherlock was disgusted to see Mycroft’s smug face filling the screen as it flickered to life. John crowded round to watch.
“It’s… a rather valuable family heirloom which…” Sherlock placed the box on the foot of the bed and blinked repeatedly, staring off into the distance.
John jumped in, “And you prevented his execution of course.”
“Mmm, that was good.” John smiled, leaning back.  “Damn, I could eat three more of those, I think.”
“Well, thank God. I didn’t fancy doing any death-defying rock climbing today,” John huffed.
“I can find something.” Sherlock nodded. “Just let me pop online.”
John could smell him. He obviously hadn’t had time to shower and apply more of that poncy hair stuff that smelled like a Tahitian wet dream, but his scent was delicious all the same.  John’s eye latched onto the mole in the center of his long, pale throat,  leading his gaze down to his open top button. In a flash John had a sense memory of the man’s body pressed against his own, the heat where Sherlock lay, lax and vulnerable, a solid, grounding weight on his torso, a long leg tangled up in his own.
One good thing to come out of the Bludger Caper was a thawing of relations between John and Alastaire Holmes. While he and the posh nob were never going to be great friends, the boy had stopped openly antagonizing him, and had even given him a bit of advice in a Potions class to add more lovage than the recipe called for.
Sherlock groaned from deep in his chest as John set to kneading the muscles of his lush backside in earnest. When John felt Sherlock had melted into the sheets beneath him, he poured a bit more oil on his palms, he continued down to work over the muscles of Sherlock’s long whipcord thighs and calves.
“Trust me,” Sherlock said as the knocking grew more insistent behind them.
“God, I can’t . . . I can’t  . . .”
“Something quite rude.” Sherlock risked a smile, and John laughed.
The train ride home felt too long, but John was grateful beyond all measure to have Sherlock’s warmth pressed against his side. Sherlock stayed busy with his laptop while John half-heartedly read a new spy novel he’d picked up. Really, though, he stayed preoccupied with sneaking glances at Sherlock and his elegant, long wrists and fingers poised over the keyboard, still not completely sure he hadn’t dreamed the man up. Eventually Sherlock snapped his computer closed and slipped it aside.
“It’s not words that I’ve ever seen before,” another declared, scratching his bushy beard.
“ John, I missed you!”
“Unauthorized perimeter shut down in one minute . . .”
giving John advice behind, muttering in Bajoran.
“John . . .” Sherlock trailed off, a crease between his brows.
“My!” The woman rounded on them. “How good to see you! And Sherlock, there you are.” She raised her eyebrows in surprised delight as if Sherlock had been playing at hide and seek in the garden, and just agreed to come in.  Mycroft moved forward to drop a kiss on her cheek.
“Oh fuck, ye bonny thing, ye fuckin’ gorgeous wee  . . .” John growled out nonsense as the both of them chased their pleasure, hands pumping together, so far apart.
“Bajor is the only home I’ve ever known.” Sherlock shrugged, answering her in Bajoran.  “The land and the people are one.”
“Well, you’d better hope that I am, too.”
“It’s just, I know my penis is so small compared to yours . . .”
Oddly, John chuckled at that but he held Sherlock’s hand tighter.
“No, of course not.” Sherlock shifted back to better see John’s face. “I can’t let on I know what a monster he is. I’ll tell him the woman was someone else, a stranger.” Sherlock shrugged. “I’ll be looking more closely into his past though. If he’s abused one woman, there must be other atrocities he’s committed.”
“Thanks, Mycroft.”  John said.
Sherlock continued to look so formal, John couldn’t resist rocking up on the balls of his feet to land a smack to his lips.
“John, we’re getting a circle dance going, join us?” Kira swung into view, grinning, half breathless.
“I’ll see you Sunday.” Sherlock nodded.
“Alright?” Sherlock’s voice came from nearby. His warm palm settled across John’s bare back.
The room flooded with another flash of lightning from above, but this one was weaker, and the accompanying boom was merely a rumble, even farther off. The storm outside was finally moving on.
“You’re my Honey,” John smiled, reaching over to trail a finger down Sherlock’s arm.
“So, how was your day?” Sherlock tried to keep his voice light. “Lupaza went out and didn’t see you anywhere.”
A drunken idiot noticed Irene, and stumbled over to block her path. Sean moved quickly to intervene and easily knocked the man aside. Irene nodded her thanks and continued through the doors unimpeded into the cool night beyond, her shoes clicking a steady, staccato rhythm.
“Oh, John, I’m sorry,” Molly waved him back down. “It’s just, Sherlock. He’s been mooning around the labs all week, acting odd. I saw him doodling your name on his lab notes, he tried to hide it when I walked by, but I saw it anyway. Then just the other day, he grilled me on the appropriate ways to show affection in a relationship and what sorts of gifts and gestures were appropriate. I finally told him to go do some research online. I thought maybe you had a ‘one month’ anniversary coming up or something.”
“Sorry, Mum, didn’t mean to.” John slid the bolt back, and opened the door. “I’m not sure Sherlock is up yet  . . .”
“Oh God, Harry. I think he’s left me.”
“Thank you, Edith, ma’am,”  John said, and Sherlock struggled not to laugh as the woman’s mouth twisted up into an irritated little pout.
In the aftermath they collapsed together onto the soiled sheets and just let their brains reset before they tried anything complicated like speech or movement.
“God, Vic I wish I knew what happened. I don’t know, I just don’t . . .” John’s voice cracked horribly, and he had to stop.
“The spell is
“JOHNNY SO HELP ME IF YOU DON’T OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW . . .” Another knock came that rattled the door in its hinges.
Sherlock wanted to protest that he and John certainly weren’t married, but they did share a bedroom. They did spend as much of their free time together as possible. Everything he did, he did with John in mind. They didn’t have anything official, but surely they were as committed to each other as people could be. But married? A Cardassian and a Bajoran?
And then it was easy. Easy, and simple, and completely
“You got this from Milly’s.” Sherlock named the right cake shop straight away.
“Thank you, John.  You look quite edible yourself,” Sherlock returned, dropping a kiss to his cheek.
“Let’s find THE worst one.” John smiled.
“Arithmancy exam. All afternoon.” Sherlock sighed, eyes closed as he tipped his head back to give John better access. “Have to go . . . few minutes.”
John climbed awkwardly out of the cab dealing with a cane and bag, as his wretched shoulder and leg both decided to act up.
“Mmm, John?” Sherlock mumbled sleepily as he stirred.
John watched as his photographic self leaned in to drop a smooch to Sherlock’s cheek. Good man. “You look fabulous to me, love. Good enough to eat.” He grinned. Sherlock pinked a bit and agreed to split a serving of baklava for pudding even though they were both stuffed.
“‘Behind the oak.’”
“Yeah, thanks . . . I . . .” John frowned, clearly uncomfortable.
“Sherlock, that was a cracking good speech!” Amir, a fellow Ravenclaw, crowded close to grab Sherlock’s hand. “You really woke everyone up from their snooze with that one. Good luck with next year, mate. I’m going to miss those deductions of yours!”
“I wasn’t clever earlier. I knew it looked familiar, but it just didn’t click.”
“Posh Boy,” Sherlock exhaled.
Sherlock worked his way through the other diners to join her. It was a nice place with real silverware, and thick cream-colored tablecloths. It wasn’t a spot he would have chosen on his own.
“That’s not a pirate.” Sherlock’s frown shifted the cranial bumps over his forehead. “It’s just Old Jenno, the gardener.”
“So, how was the wedding?” Molly leaned in.
“She’s pretty.” Molly nodded toward a woman with her hair up in a messy bun at the salad bar.
“Wow, thanks, John.”
The twins had traveled to see the Quidditch World Cup in Ireland and had plenty of tales of the game, and the dancing veelas at halftime to share. Owen, it seemed, had got himself a girlfriend over the summer.
“What?” John burst out.
“Oh really? Have you tried . . .”
Tentatively Sherlock pushed his cock alongside John’s, keeping the stretched skin clamped over their overlap. It felt lovely, and strangely, oddly intimate in a way John hadn’t experienced before. By small degrees, Sherlock worked his glans back and forth, rubbing against the head of John's cock. Watching the tip of Sherlock's length disappearing into his sheath was wildly erotic, and John clutched at Sherlock’s shoulders to keep himself upright as his knees weakened. He struggled for a good breath as the pleasure built inside him.
Sherlock climbed onto the bed, collapsing against John when he gathered him close.
John grunted in reply as they rounded the sheds to find a small huddle of giggling children hiding behind the out buildings.
“Sir, some men they came to ask about you at the front desk. My uncle he tells them that you go out to work during the day, and go out to party just like the other white men at night.”
Sherlock pocketed his phone with a smile. He tossed a few notes on the table to cover the stir fried rice he’d picked at, hoisted his camera bag over his shoulder, and left the restaurant with a step that was decidedly jaunty.
business, soldier.”  Sherlock narrowed his eyes menacingly, and the man recoiled slightly.
“You’ll put in a good word for me, won’t you, with the Prefect?”
Lestrade joined them shortly thereafter. “Is that him?”
The next John knew, he was on his back, untied, in Sherlock’s lap.
When they parted, John squinted back at this nameplate.  “I dunno, somehow I don’t want to leave these here. It feels like leaving a bit of ourselves behind. I’d rather take them with us.”
John couldn’t help the laugh that burbled out of him.
Powerful creatures.
Sherlock advanced over him looking simply murderous.
“Naughty boy, playing with your food,” he growled by John’s ear, sucking at the sensitive spot behind his jaw as he fondled John balls, returning to massage over his cock.
“Oh, throw in some chips at least.” John smiled.  “Then we can call it a draw.”
“Yes, of course. Grand-mère . I’ll get you the address in Germany as soon as I have it," Sherlock said as his grandmother hugged him tight about the middle.  “We have some time yet.”
John glanced back at the tangle of notes left by Sherlock across his page. “Yup, Sherlock says yellow is best.”
“Victor.” Sherlock looked between the two men with wide eyes, his naturally pale face gone even whiter if at all possible.
“Can I call you?” John breathed.
“What’s the point of great talent if you don’t use it to help the world?” Sherlock lifted an eyebrow.
“Hey, hey.” John nudged the bundle of gently snoring man.
“Oh, love.” John took a step and crushed Sherlock against him. Sherlock buried his face against John’s belly and breathed. He smelled deliciously of warmth and sleep. Sherlock thought he might cry. “No, I’m not disappointed in you. I’m just worried. God, it’s bad enough with Harry’s smoking and drinking . . .” John trailed off.
“Well, I certainly won’t stay where I’m not wanted.” The man flashed a smile full of teeth. He took a last pull from his cigarette, and leaned over to grind it out in a bowl on the end table.  John could see that much to his dismay, it held a whole collection of dog ends.
