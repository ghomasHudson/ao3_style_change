John unbuttons Sherlock's cuff and rolls up his midnight blue shirt up to his elbow. He puts a small quantity of ointment on Sherlock's wrist and start massaging it.
Sherlock's eyes are the thing that struck John first. Not so much for the particular color and the feline shape, as for the feeling that they are capable of giving to be scanned body and soul.
<< A crime scene is not the most suitable place for a child! I thought you was more sensible, Mr Holmes. An important man from our economic scene has been kidnapped with his wife and his son. I can't believe you take the opportunity to teach your work to your heir! >>.
<< I just wanted to tell him that I'm not one of his men and that I don't take orders from him >>.
Dry blows break the whistling of the wind. They don't even bother Sherlock anymore. They have become part of the context, now.
<< Of course >> the old man says, going to the cash desk, where a huge woman is about to deposit the contents of the overflowing basket on the counter.
<< Do you recognize him? >> he asks.
"You know, I'm wondering if yours is Stockholm syndrome or if, in some way, you see yourself in her" Moriarty observes, chuckling. "I just think that if you came back here before passing away, it's because this woman allowed the circle opened by that other woman to close. Here, because of your mother's reprehensible behavior, you were almost killed by your father, "he says, showing him his left hand. "There, because of your doctor's equally reprehensible behavior, you allowed Mary to kill you," he says, showing him his right hand. "That's all," Moriarty concludes, joining his hands. “Here is the circle closed. A frustrated woman created the problem and another frustrated woman solved it. Easy isn't it? "
<< He found someone able to stand up to him, finally >> Margaret says hard. Her husband calls her back and she ignores him. William barely turns to his father before turning his amazed gaze to the mother. He has never seen her so determined.
<< The wife? >>.
John hears Sherlock laugh. A free and cheerful laugh that Sherlock rarely allows himself and that John had deluded himself that the consultant dedicated only to him. The punk in turn laughs and hands him the cigarette again. No, it definitely cannot be simple tobacco. When Sherlock gives it back to him, the man grabs his wrist, the same one that John squeezed. He seems to be asking him something and when Sherlock minimizes the man turns on. John tends his ears, hoping that the wind is favorable and brings him some excerpt of conversation. Unfortunately, however, the air is still and John must be content with looking and he doesn't likes what he sees. Sherlock seems to be saddened by the punk's excited words. He shakes his head, dejected, and the punk reassures him by caressing his face. The consultant gladly accepts that cuddle, as well as the man'sface that comes closer to his more and more. Although John only sees the back of the punk's neck, who impales his flatmate's face, what he is doing is eloquent.
Sherlock and John arrive at 221B after a taxi trip spent in silence, each lost in his own reflections. John lets Sherlock lead the way, as always, walking in front of him. Sherlock reaches the apartment first and when John closes the door behind him, he finds him intent on fixing the chairs on which the three Lestrade have sat.
John frees Sherlock's wrist from his grip and takes two steps backwards, shaking his head. John brings his hands to his mouth and feels them tremble slightly, shaken by this violent anger that still invades his body. They were talking about the case, about Greg and his daughter and he turned the conversation on that damned guitarist.
<< Ok, ok, Sherlock you convinced me. Howard Byron was here with a man >> says Greg.
<< Oh. What's happened? >> here is the inevitable grip on the maternal and female protective side. John usually pats himself on the shoulder mentally when he manages to attack from that front. This time, however, Annette's hand immediately placed on his hand annoys him. John must make a real effort not to retract it.
Five days have passed since the storm gave them a truce. Days when there were still mild snowfalls which then gave way to a great cutting cold. Hataway was forced to give John and Greg a snowcat to take them to the Ski Club and there they discovered the first sad truth.
<< She was so boring that it is not worth spending the night with her. I knew it! Never can be trusted >> the consultant shakes his head, annoyed.
Greg look at John amazen. They exchange a long look and then laugh, waking the puppy, who, annoyed, yelps and covers his ears with his paws.
November 13th
<< Here they are >> says Sherlock, delivering to John the samples of urine. << Stay there until Molly has the result and let me know immediately. I need to know if they gave me some drug >>.
<< I'll must know it? I didn't know could be difficut to do >>.
<< I can check both >>.
<< You reacted like this because in reality it wasn't that woman who killed all those people, didn't you? >> John whispers, holding the back of Sherlock's hand very close to his lips. Mary's eyes. The sudden way in which they changed after that moment of freezing. John reminds them well. << If your desire to help her is so strong, there must be a reason that goes beyond the banal Stockholm syndrome. You fight for justice to be done and evidently she is not the culprit to be executed >>.
In dreams Sherlock returned to many episodes of his past. From some of these he woke up panting, from others in tears, from others even screaming. Sherlock always found Mary- child sitting on the chair. A wet handkerchief in one hand, ready to wipe away sweat, and a glass of water in the other.
<< I won't go to the club, Greg >> John warns him.
Mrs. Hudson surprises them embraced, but there is not the usual smile of someone who knows a lot about her face. She became very interested in the case of 'that poor girl', as she used to define Mary, and immediately senses something happened to her. Ms Hudson sets the tea tray on the table and takes the letter. She read it, crying in turn and without saying a word goes to the door and from there goes down to her apartment.
<< Of course, as always >> John reassures him with a smile.
<< You saved him for Molly >> repeats John, who struggles not to laugh hysterically.
<< I think you can get dressed >> John whispers.
<< So September last year >>.
<< Forget it >> John chuckles, shaking his head. Sherlock first looks at him in amazement, then joins in his laughter and there they are, laughing again like two teenagers.
<< Where he is going? >> John asks.
<< I wasn't expecting anything in return. I am happy to know you are clean. For a long time I wondered what could push a man with a brilliant intelligence like yours to throw himself away like that. After what happened to Lizzy, I think that you, like her, also had bad parents >>.
<< Apparently >>. Sherlock lets go of the blanket and shakes his brother's hand. << You have always been at my side every awakening from those frightening journeys that I made in the abysses of my unconscious >> smiles at him, seeing him blush just on the pale cheeks.
<< Do you remember what dad said to me the night I ran away from home? >>.
<< You, a London's doctor who as a hobby helps a private investigator, want to come here, in the north west, to teach us how to deal with the rigors of our winters? >>.
<< No! She will suffer. Molly will suffer a lot, instead >> she replies desperately bringing her hands to her hair.
<< Yes >> answers with conviction. << For too long I have fought against people's boredom and idiocy. Maybe that's the better thing for me >>.
Two knocks on the door interrupt them. A breathless Greg joins them by taking a seat on the armchair left especially for him.
<< What? >>.
<< You are so sad >> she whispers, sniffling. He wipes her nose, by running over the sleeve of his felted sweater. Sherlock doesn't know what to argue. He no longer hears anything now. He has nothing in his head anymore and that's really strange.
<< I am not addict of it, I use it >> he  replying. Sherlock feels tenderness for that desperate boy who tries to find the courage to stay there, standing, before that ruthless court that has already condemned him.
<< Lizzy doesn't expect to find us here? >> asks Greg.
The woman suddenly walks away, leaving him panting and trembling on the bed. Sherlock for the first time feels his broken leg ache, while a thousand white dots explode before his eyes. His head, already painfull by the blow, begins to ache right in the injured areas.
<< You too, little brother. I want to know him, you knows! I'm curious! >>.
Someone knock on the door and both are taken by surprise. John goes to open it and a smiling girl hands him an envelope, telling him it's for Mr. Sigerson. John takes a moment to remember that it is the pseudonym chosen by Sherlock.
<< I know. I know that you will take care of me, my captain >> Sherlock says, running his erection with his finger.
Sherlock grabs the fork and realizes that he is weak enough to struggle to hold it in his hand. Pinch a potato taking a significant amount of time and bring it to his mouth.
Sherlock picks up an excerpt of what appears to be a conversation. The voice is very low. He cannot say whether it belongs to a man or a woman. This person insists on how angry was for not being taken seriously.
<< Annette, really, I prefer to go >>.
<< How can you implore me by showing off your lie, damn wanker with no respect! >> she shouts, putting more emphasis in her shake. Sherlock force himself to not vomit all the lunches he has been forced to eat in these days.
John puts on the table one of the register he brought away from her home, which seems to cause a slight reaction in Mary. In fact, she opens her eyes wide and moves slightly back. The guard, on the other hand, comes forward slightly.
<< Why not? The ‘salt and pepper’ man is very sexy, don't you know? >>.
Lestrade remains of salt after this other revelation.
<< I'm sorry, Mary >> John says. The woman smiles and slowly shakes her head.
<< And it would be? >> asks Greg.
Something happens to the entire human machine when we helplessly witness the suffering of a person it loves. Any kind of suffering. From the simplest flu to the most complex of surgical operations. It tries to do the impossible just to see the other return to shine with health and well-being. At the same time, it experience the powerlessness of being unable to do anything but stay there, by the other side, waiting for it to pass. It hopefully that will pass quickly.
<< What kind of stupid thing you say?. It doesn't disgusts me. It amazes me. Do he deserves your attentions? >>.
<< There it is >> she says handing it to him.
<< So is this the reason? >> looks at him in amazement while buttoning his shirt. << I remind you that there may be a maniac in this super luxury hotel >> he says undoing his belt.
A couple of hours after his first awakening and his first meal, Mary went up to the room armed with a basin, sponges and towel. The idea of being washed by her, of her hands on his body, had made Sherlock shiver. Mary had already stripped and washed him while he was completely unconscious and totally at her mercy. Sherlock proposed her to permit him to wash himself to relieve her of the burden, but this  infuriated her. Sherlock had done a good number of repentant and contrite looks to calm her.
<< Apparently it's just you and me, doctor >> says Mycroft, taking a cigarette from a package hidden in the inside pocket of his coat.
"As you said yourself, people only see what they want to see," says Moriarty, shrugging. "For the agents of Scotland Yard you are a freak. For your brother a hopeless case. For your father you were a whore. For me a succulent challenge ...".
Sherlock laughs heartily again. The saliva goes through him making him cough and Mycroft, annoyed by his attitude, in truth, offers him more water.
<< It is dangerous >>.
<< Are you listening to yourself? 'Mary-child' >> Mycroft repeats in amazement. << It doesn't matter if a single personality of that woman wanted to kill you. The action was brought by her, regardless of which personality governed her actions >>.
<< Mary Abbott >> solemnly replies. << You can call me Mary >> she adds cheerfully.
<< Are you sure? Couldn't she be scared enough to hide her corps somewhere? As you said, she is a six-year-old child and children at that age are afraid of being reprimanded. I seem to have understood that that woman had a very severe father >>.
"It's over, yes," Sherlock sighs as he look at Mary slipping towards the door.
"What does that mean? You made yourself men of every color under your weapons. Do you become homophobic?"
<< I don't want to have the same thing >> she says, indicating Sherlock.
<< I'm better and then I couldn't wait for tomorrow. I would spend the night in white anyway, you know me. I want to take advantage of the surprise effect >>.
<< Nobody outside this office will know about your presence within these walls >> says the manager << Just say at the reception that you have booked the 'Ocean Blue' suite >>.
<< John, I guess it is better if you take him away from here and quickly >> Greg said elbowing him, when he saw him shake off Bryan, that he was taking too much freedom whit him.
<< Are you really sure, John? >> Mycroft challenges him, suddenly becoming serious. << Do you really think you know my brother to the point of being able to put limits on his grudge? >>.
<< It was quite exhaustive, Mr. Holmes. I too would have preferred never to have the pleasure of meeting you >> Fox replies and John cannot help but admire the tough face of this man, whom he knows very little about.
<< It is a piece of cloth >> Sherlock whispers.
<< In fact, if you want to became dog's friend, give him some food >> says Greg.
<< A real infestation >> confirms John, standing in the doorway.
<< The employees of the Spa are actually hired by the sauna master >> he tries to unload the responsibilities.
Sherlock brings his left hand to the back of the neck, without realizing it. He feels under his fingers the thick scar that had given him the torment in the first days after waking up from the short period of coma.
<< We also found a pair of boots, presumably the same that she wore to kill the dog and kidnap the Ford >> says Greg, appearing on the screen next to John. << Ah, I confirm you that both, you and the child, were right: the autopsy on the dog confirms that he was poisoned >>.
<< I am not a whore and neither was she, damned killer! >> Sherlock cried out, exploding the anger of his crazy parent. He found himself chased again by him along the corridors of that old and dismal house. He had managed, however, to escape him that time, to find his way out of the snowy countryside. Thus began his exile, his slow fall in the tunnel of actual addiction.
<< This is what worries me. I don't want you to have a concussion >>.
Sherlock was eight years old. He takes the run-up, determined to make a nice jump. Mycroft is so kidnapped by his book that he realizes what is happen at the last moment, or so he lets him believe. A funny expression of amazement and resignation in front of Sherlock's childish idiocy is drawn on Mycroft's face. Sherlock jump and his thin, small body impacts against Mycroft's fat and soft body. They fall to the ground, one to snort and the other to laugh happily. Mycroft was fat when he was a kid. Fat and soft and it was a pleasure for Sherlock to stay on him. He found reassuring the mass of fat that surrounded him from head to toe.
Silent again. There seems that Moriarty has been hurt by Sherlock's indifference.
<< How can you remember the commitments that I myself forget? >> John question, annoyed by that second unwelcome intrusion into his private life. << We are on a case and I ... >>.
"It seems, however, to be a magnanimous woman, in her own way," continues Mycroft. "She could give you the opportunity to choose whether to lose one or another part of your body. I'm curious to know which one your choice. "
<< You're right >> nods Sherlock.
<< What reputation? >> question in turn.
John agrees with Mycroft in thinking that only thanks to Greg's loving presence will his children come out a little bruised but substantially unharmed from this bad experience. John would never have imagined finding such comfort even for himself in Mycroft's words. Words that, although they were not addressed directly to him, he had been waiting for years. The stomach has stopped hurting him and has relaxed. Finally, after so many days, it is giving him a breather.
<< Who are you talking about? >> she replies amazed.
“Of course, because you doesn't get involved. A one-night adventure and then everyone on their way. "
<< In my country this is called throwing petrol on the fire >> says Ulrika.
<< It shouldn't have happened at all, Sherlock. We do not solve the criminal investigation in this way. By not becoming victims >>.
<< I'm fine >> he says.
<< No! >> exclaims, shaking his head.
<< The stomach upside down >> he says, looking away from him.
<< That there is nothing wrong with sharing a cigarette >> Sherlock replies, by taking a mouthful and then blowing the smoke away. John has to admit it's a somewhat erotic scene, but he immediately shakes off that completely out of place thought. Sherlock extinguishes the cigarette that has just started and throws it away along with the whole package. He stop a taxi with his usual tried and tested gesture and let them take them to Baker Street.
<< Oh, so it was the sauna that killed him >> Greg replies, scratching his temple.
<< A nightmare? >> he wonders in amazement. It was so real. So damn real.
<< Oh my God, Lestrade, how can you not understand it yet? >> Sherlock blurts, moving away from John. << Against the wall. A blocked arm. The face pressed against the wall so hard to creating a laceration to the right temple and, above all, the murderer's elbow pressed against the victim's collarbone for a time long enough to leave another mark! No, it's not about theft >> Sherlock scout. After a moment of confusion, Greg's face open in a comic expression of amazement. << Better late than never, Scotland Yard! >> Sherlock exclaims, waving his hand in an attempt to create some wind. << Will never understand if Howard Byron was consenting or not. Have your men collect all clothes and towels. You will surely find unequivocal body fluids there. Also on the body, of course. Cardiac arrest caught him before he could get into the shower, luckily for us >>. Sherlock hurries to get out of that warm and unnerving environment.
Sherlock doesn't answer John. He sighs heartily and shakes his head. John understands that it is better not to insist. He follows Sherlock out the door, down the long corridor and down the stairs. John feels the tension that comes from him. Not anger. Not even the energy activated by a case that is proving to be very interesting. John perceives melancholy and a lot of sadness come from Sherlock and realizes that the presence of the child has something to do with it. The consultant and the child seems to have many things in common. John thinks that are this communance that upset Sherlock.
<< How is it possible? >>.
November 17th
<< All this is beautiful, John >> Sherlock said.
<< A lot >> says John, decide not to add anything else. << The only one who may know something about Sherlock is his brother. You know he doesn't lose sight of him for a single moment >>.
<< Holà, Fox >> replies at the investigative journalist.
<< I'm tired, Sherlock. I'm  unreasonable >> John says, yawning.
<< Yes. It served, yes >> John mind, reluctant to destroy the hope of that creature.
'Sit down and shut up' in german
<< Sorry, Mary Abbott arrived first >>.
John wonders. The puppy reach Sherlock's side and crouch down. The consultant raises his head and turns to face toward the puppy.
<< I will find McNeel's victims one by one and I am sure they will tell me that they have received a letter. This one was for Howard Byron. The thing that disgusts me most is that you felt so confident that you didn't get rid of it. This letter contains a request for money in exchange for silence. Martin was hired three months ago and since you discovered his 'hobby', let's say, instead of denouncing and hunting him, you has leveraged the embarrassment that a man can feel at the idea that people known that he was abused by another man. My compliments. You are almost worse than him >>.
John sits on the bed, intrigued by that hint of childhood he just gave him.
<< Oh! I knew! I knew that there was something! >> she screams cheerful like a child. << Don't let he go, Johnny >> adds serious.
<< Yes, I'm Sherlock Holmes's flatmate. I am here because I want to talk to you about the investigation that Sherlock was carrying out and that has passed on to me, at least until he is able to take it back. What do you say we sit down? >> John proposes by moving the chair. The woman imitates him and sits down immediately after him.
<< I am your friend! We are friends, Mary. The things I told you, my nightmares, my stories that went wrong, are true, Mary >>.
<< You discovered me! >>
John holds out his hand to the woman, politely. An unpleasant sensation envelops him when John sees his hand, already small in itself, disappear swallowed up by the huge and massive hand of Mary.
<< I have not attacked anyone! >> the chief  blurts, crossing his arms over his chest. Behind him, Greg rolls his eyes and John shakes his head in resignation. << I allowed you, Mr Holmes, to take part of our most important cases and what do you do? Contaminate the crime scene by going through it with your dog! Do you even carry your son with you? >> cries the chief indignantly, pointing William.
<< Yes, I realize it, but this is not a good reason not to say things as they are. You saved the life of a friend's daughter. You made a beautiful gesture and you are doing everything to minimize it, to not get emotionally involved. You can't become a cold machine just to stop Moriarty from acting his intent, Sherlock. Don't you realize that, by doing this, you still play his game? >>.
<< Our daughter attends art school. She has always loved drawing, since she was a child. She has notebooks full of her drawings and is organizing a portfolio to be able to take them around publishing houses, fairs and in all those places where it is possible for a young artist to present her work >> says the mother with a whisper.
<< Sure. Except that the doctor is never there. 'You know how it is, he's on a mission with the private investigator' >>.
<< At this time, however, it would have been more difficult not to be indicted. I don't want you to go to jail because of me, John >> Sherlock says taking care of the other hand, the left one, where the grazes are greater.
Sherlock closes the folder and opens the e-mail. He foundi the exchange of e-mails, first friendly and then more and more animated, between Milton and O’Hara.
<< No >> John answers, by crossing his arms over his chest. Sherlock watches him silently for a long time and John lets him doing, not at all intimidated by his inscrutable poker face.
<< Leave me! >> growls Sharon and she is so full of energy that it is difficult to keep it against the wall.
"This time I'm afraid it's all my fault, Greg!" John thinks, greeting him with a wave of his hand. He closes the doorway and looks at the door of their apartment.
Sherlock and John exchange a long look. In that silent exchange of glances, the speech mentioned in the cab finds a tacit agreement.
<< Cardiac arrest >> the doctor answers. << We could be sure of this after the autopsy, of course, but I can say he died following a cardiac arrest >>.
<< Eh, but that's how he was raised. With animals it's like with children, John, we use the educational methods that parents used on us. Luckily you have John, little one >> Angelo says, giving the giant bone to the puppy.
<< You leave dad >> the child nods. << Sherlock said you would do it >>.
"This is the day of oddities!" John thinks and his eye falls on an abandoned backpack next to the table, cluttered with laboratory equipment. He turns to ask for explanations and only now does he see it. A guitar lying at the foot of the sofa.
<< It is the beginning of the third phase >> Sherlock nods and George looks at him worried, his hands graps at the edge of the seat. << A further selection is made at public seminars and only a few of the young guests are invited to private ones. I don't know much about this part yet. The bastards who run this site are damn good at hiding their movements >> Sherlock says between his teeth.
<< The fact that he is divorcing your mother does not relieve him of his duties as a father. Whatever you are about to tell us, he has a duty to take care of you and you have the right to be protected by him >>.
<< Mr. Fox >> resumes Mycroft. << It is useless for me to tell you that I do not approve in the least the methods that you, your boss and your colleagues are used to implementing. However, I think this situation is absolutely exceptional and only and exclusively for this reason will I allow you and that cybercriminal of your colleague to access the government main frame. I want it to be clear that, when the case is closed, all the passwords will be changed and any attempt to force it on your part will be prosecuted, at the risk of compromising the diplomatic agreements that we have had with your government for years >>.
Morgan barks and draws Sherlock's attention, who quickly approaches him and William, crouched against the wall.
<< It is better to obey the doctor's orders. Then Morgan also seems to be hungry >> Sherlock tells to William.
<< Do you really want me to tell you, John? >> Sherlock asks him in a heavy tone, articulating the words well. In the depth of Sherlock's clear eyes, the doctor realizes that he doesn't want to. No. It better that remain in the past what belongs to the past. << Your new and very recent conquest awaits your response. Don't keep her waiting >> Sherlock adds, even sketching a smile, while the boy intones Ashes Remain's 'End of me'.
<< It is really a funny name >> John reopening his eyes and finds himself close to that terrible big woman met at the shop. << Where is your flatmate now? >> she asks him. The woman prevents him from escaping, by holding him in the strong grip of her legs.
<< He, however, put me there >>.
<< You should go and lie down on a real bed >> his friend says, tapping his shoulder.
Te pub is crowded. Maybe it is not a good idea for the puppy, that jumps restless .
<< Where do you think you are, Sherlock? >> Mycroft asks, taking him by surprise. Sherlock looks at him more carefully and then turns his gaze to the room. Suddenly the memory of what he has experienced explodes in the mind's eyes.
<< No, in fact I have no commitments >>.
<< Finally dressed in a decent way >> nods Sherlock. John glares at him. << With these you are perfect >> he adds passing a pair of glasses with a large, thick and black frame.
<< It shouldn't be difficult to get a child to speak, Inspector >>.
<< This put your reputation at risk. It's a trivial criminal investigation, I can do it myself. Enjoy the hotel >> leaves the room by slamming the door.
<< And isn't that so, John? >> Sherlock blurts, getting up in turn. << Do you think I was pleased to see you dressed in explosives? That I was pleased to see you used as a pawn in a game? It was one of the worst moments of my life! >> Sherlock shouts, clenching his fists and John grabs them holding them tight in his small but determined hands.
<< Yes, but that's not enough! >> insists the consultant, returning to sit at the pc. << Maybe by scrolling the others novels we will get more clues >>.
<< That's how it goes >> Sherlock growls, holding her still. A loud snap announces the breaking of Sharon's arm. She pass out due the strong pain.
John's voice tells him in his head.
<< Your kids just wanted to protect you, Greg >>.
"Please stay alive!" he thinks, making screech the wheels. "Stay alive!" he repeats, hurtling on the road just swept by the snow, against which the chains fixed to the wheels creak, producing a ghostly sound.
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly. The light in the room hurts his eyes. He twists his nose by puffing. His disapproval does not go unnoticed and the lights are dimmed. Encouraged by the twilight, Sherlock opens his eyelids and meets his brother, sitting on the chair beside him.
<< Why not? I will train him and he help us in the investigation. A spare nose is always useful, as yours doesn't work >>.
John takes a while to figure out what he's looking at. The video is a piece of footage taken by the camera placed in front of the changing room. Shows Howard Byron exiting the locker room. He walks with an uncertain step, one hand pressed to his mouth and his gaze lost in front of him.
<< Just? >>.
John would like to ask him many questions about this hint of the past that Sherlock has given him. He, who, perhaps, can say, with embarrassment, that he was more on the side of the bullies than the victims. John never participated in beatings or humiliations against those targeted, but he never did anything to help them either. At least before these things didn't spill over to his sister.
<< No, Jesus, it's not you… >>.
<< What happened, Sherlock >> asks him John, feeling the blood freeze in his veins.
<< John, you and Morgan wait at the back of the room, please >> says Sherlock to William.
<< Actually not. At least not directly. I have heard many times your countless ex yelling at you >>.
<< Is it a bad thing? >> asks William to Sherlock.
<< No, these are too far >>.
<< This time I haven't been alone >> Mycroft says, looking at the empty chair. << I didn't really want to consider the possibility that you had disappeared. I couldn't believe there was something so crazy behind it. John, however, has not thought about it even for a moment. He remained clinging to the belief that you were alive, always >>.
"When did I fall so low that I wasted my time with such subjects?" he wonders and the expression of disgust that Sherlock assumes in front of human idiocy comes to his mind. John does not realize that he is replicating it very well.
<< Of this >> he says, pointing to the double bed in the center of the other room.
<< Officially by my side >> Sherlock replies, taking John's face in his hands. << I would be lost without my blogger >> he whispers, sinking his hands into John's hair, involving him in a kiss full of passion, which extinguishes reason by letting their bodies speak silently.
The musician turns to them and John has to admit that he is beautiful. Long, smooth, blond hair, a tanned face with clear blue eyes. The ex-soldier is shaken by that moment of estrangement when he realizes that those sensual eyes are staring intensely at his flatmate. And to make matters worse, which amazes John even more, Sherlock returns his gaze with equal intensity.
<< I couldn't miss an opportunity like this! >>.
<< Because this would have destroyed Greg, John. His reputation. This would destroied what's left of his family in an even heavier way than a suicide >>.
<< The universe is never so lazy as to get lost in coincidences, John >> Mycroft replies, nodding satisfied.
<< Sherlock must have crashed into that tree >> says Greg, pointing to a tree with a large stem hovering between the road and the precipice. He goes to remove the layer of snow deposited on the trunk and finds the marks of the paint.
<< Here it is! >> exclaims, indicating a small sign on the immaculate wall.
<< Today we tried a few, but he didn't answer to any of these >>.
<< Nobody are never too young to tell the truth and to ensure that the wicked are punished and justice is done >> says Sherlock, glancing at the nanny, that blushes embarrassed. << William has already helped us and I think he has something again to tell us >>. The child nods seriously.
He puts his hand on the girl's hay-blonde hair, so similar to his in a past age. John pushes the hand away after that light caress, closing it in a fist as he moves away from the girl.
John takes a showers, gets dressed and goes back to Sherlock's room to retrieve the puppy.
<< John! John, that's enough! So kill him, enough! >> says holds John tightly in his arms to stop his fury. << I'm fine. He did nothing to me, calm down >>.
He says nothing. He only looks at John, his face red with passion.
Morgan draws the consultant's attention by barking. He sit diligently in front of the wardrobe and looks at Sherlock, wagging his tail. Sherlock nods and approaches him.
<< It is not a good thing, Eddy, no, no! >> Sherlock says and then explode into a loud laugh. He laughs, feeling his aching throat, his stomach too full, his broken leg that seems to have woken up only now and his urethra on fire.
<< The certainty came when we compared the messages sent to the children who committed suicide with those received by Daisy Cooper, Rosaline Jackson and Elisabeth Lestrade >> says Fox.
<< It's late, John, go to sleep. Tomorrow you are on duty early >> he says, surprising John once again with remembering his commitments.
<< Mary !! >> cries in the face of a nascent panic. He pushing aside the sheets, ready to get out of bed and who cares about the leg in traction, the pain, the reproaches on Mary's part, too.
<< I would say yes >> John answers, feeling himself as a child in front of Sara's severe gaze.
<< Honestly, I thought they were playing with double meanings, John. Since I know you, I have only seen you dating women. God, what an evening >> Greg sighs, putting his elbows over his knees again. He also takes his head in his hands, this time. << So, if Sherlock wasn't the first, what scared you? >>.
<< Oh, here is my client! It's definitely too warm here, you know? >>.
John should stop. He knows he should because his friend is drunk. In more sober circumstances they would both sit in front of a movie or each in their own beds. But John doesn't stop. He doesn't want to stop!
The consultant comes out of the dressing room with the intention of going away from there, but finds his way blocked by a little man with a notable belly and a shiny bald head. This man looks at Sherlock with huge eyes, visibly upset.
<< Not at all >> Sherlock says and this time it's him to chuckle. << This story is anything but easy. The 'final problem', as you like to call it, may also have been created by my mother, but she is not the cause >>.
<< Yes, the registration forms to mom's creative writing course. She has many students. She is avery good teacher! >> says William proudly. << Usually she puts manuscripts here too. They are not there, so the kidnapper really took them >>.
<< This Abbott, my colleague ... >>.
<< No. He just rubbed himself >>.
<< Let me ask you the same question in a few hours, when we have delivered that asshole to Lestrade >>.
Morgan led them to little Ford's bedroom. Sherlock's keen gaze is immediately captured by a beautiful two-masted sailing ship placed on a shelf in a position where it is impossible not to see him immediately. The bed is unmade and some toys lie on the floor. Well-kept and therefore very important toys for this eight years old boy. Sherlock looks around and is surprised to see himself wearing that stupid hat again. The photo that portrays him peeks out from a series of newspaper articles about his cases, stuck with the pins on a cork slate. On the bedside table a crime book with a bookmark diligently positioned, indicates the kind of reading preferred by the child. In the small but well-stocked library there are others books of the same literary genre, written by more or less famous authors .
<< Yes, of course I remember it and that's why I didn't disturb you >> Greg roll his eyes. << It is one of those cases of his sure interest. I don't understand why Sherlock doesn't answer me! Can I know, then, where he ended up? >>.
<< Holy God, what happened here? >> Greg asks, looking first at Martin then Sherlock and John.
<< Idiot! >> John exclaims ironically, hitting Greg's shoulder. << I take the baby home. Thanks for the beer and the chat >>.
<< Forgive me for discussing about my reputation >> John whispers stroking his nose with Sherlock’s thumb.
John invites Sherlock to follow their client. His gaze is uncompromising. Sherlock snorts, looks up to the sky but obeys. They enter the lift and the director takes a key from the pants pocket and inserts it in the lock on the button panel. The lift moves slowly to the top of the six floors of this super luxury hotel. The corridor in which the doors open is illuminated by many fan-shaped wall lights, which cast yellow beams of light on the white walls. This creating a contrast with the burgundy carpet that the consultant dislikes. The temperature, however, is definitely cooler.
Instead, as they went away from the scene of crime, tired, dirty and dented, Sherlock pricked up his ears and headed for a lush green spot, very similar to many others in that remote countryside where investigations led them. John moved in the same direction, when he saw that Sherlock was taking too long to return. John called the consultant several times without being answered, till Sherlock came out from the tall grass to tell him to stop making so much noise. The doctor, full of anger, needed to control himself to punch Sherlock's face. But when the consultant turned toward him, the anger melted into surprise.
<< It is not important what there is, Greg, but what there isn't >> says John, who opened the rear door and the hood, while the two policemen were trying to understand how the accident had gone.
<< As I said it's a very big thing. Rosaline Jackson and Daisy Cooper appear to be the first two cases in England, but there may well be others. Not all the details are always taken into consideration when it comes to suicide >>.
<< No, I have not say anithing to the jurnalists about it >>.
<< Lizzy can take home herself alone! >> George replies, planting his hands on his hips. << Come on, dad, I also took part in the investigation! Had I not copied the photos of those  bastards, Sherlock and… this man >>, he says, indicating uncertain Fox, << they would not have been able to locate them >>.
<< Do you really think so? >> Sherlock laughs in turn. << Right now, the police team sent to Milton Keynes is pulling Mr and Ms Fords to safety from the cellar in which you have hidden them. A damp, moldy cellar, like your at home. It was very simple to force the PC password and read your latest unpublished novel. I found it compelling and, by the way, thanks for the detailed description of your grandfather's cottage on Willen Lake >>.
<< Was that jumble of songs without logical sense a message? >>.
<< William is our only witness and, luckily for us, he is a clever little guy >>.
<< If I was in your shoes, I would not make him angry >> John says, pointing the top of the stairs. << Sherlock really took the puppy to heart. I would never have said it >>.
<< Obviously it hurts. It is broken >> she replies, indifferent to his pain. Sherlock stares at that frowning face, the huge body, the hands anchored to the hips and cannot help but laugh. He laughs because he could have made that joke in a similar circumstance. Why reaffirm what is obvious? A broken leg can only hurt. He himself would have been in the same way insensitive. Feeling how bad it is to reiterate the obvious with an air of sufficiency and annoyance, causes him an even greater pain than he feels in the leg and belly.
<< Ours is a mutual exchange of needs >> Greg replies, turning his gaze to Sherlock who reciprocates him. << Sherlock needs unusual cases and trust and I need help to solve them. I allow him not to have to resort to ... external chemical agents to eradicate boredom; Sherlock avoide to make my liver rotten not knowing where to go banging his head to get out of certain situations. We save each other's ass, in short >> chuckles and Sherlock smiles in turn.
Sherlock follows in the footsteps, that branch out between overturned tables, chairs moved without grace. On the large burgundy fabric sofa the fugitive ended his run. Sherlock deduces it from the soft cushions, bruised and fallen on the floor in disorder.
<< Don't spit! >> order the woman, by pointing at him with prongs of the fork. Sherlock shivers at the firm tone of her voice. The fierce eyes with which she threatens him do not promise anything good. Sherlock gasps and executes the order. Burned throat and palate were what it took to complete the situation.
<< To attract his attention, Cooper told him who was your father and the master must have spent a bad quarter of an hour, fearing to see the whole Scotland Yard swoop into the apartment. He must not have liked it and decided to punish the girls. The master will have used the tactics of cyberbullying and instigation to commit suicide, to punish the girls for endangering the organization >>.
<< We got carried away a bit, Sherlock >> John had started, serious and distant. << We were both drunk and ... it can happen. Yes, I would say that can happen >> he had wrinkled his nose in the way Sherlock always found funny, but that at that moment it was not at all. << I think it is better that this remain an isolated fact not to be repeated. I think it's better for both >> he concluded by wetting his lips.
<< Especially Lestrade >> Sherlock says trying to stop crying. << If Anderson and Donovan were to find out, it would be the end >> a sob escapes, catching him unawares.
Proud too, although Sherlock doesn't know why he is. With a gesture of the head, John encourages Sherlock to go ahead and ask to the child the most important question.
“Come on, won't you be condemning her? Everyone is looking for their love. 'All you need is love', the Beatles also said. Oh yeah, you don't even know who the Beatles are, am I right? " Moriarty asks and Sherlock just shakes his head. "Yeah," James replies, smacking his lips. “Your father was the type of person I would have happily collaborated with. Colder than your brother. The king of ice men ”he says satisfied. “This anonymous creature must have given her the warmth she didn't get from him. Who knows, maybe what she didn't even know existed. Was she a math, am I right? " he asks and Sherlock nods. "Perfect. Numbers and feelings travel on opposite tracks. It must have been a real discovery for her. Who knows, maybe this would have made her happy. She wanted to take you with her, so somehow she cared about you. Who knows what it would have been to grow up with them, away from the ancestors' house? I bet you thought about it now and then ”says Moriarty on by elbowing him.
<< Yeah >> Sherlock nods. << Mycroft constantly tells me what to do and continually discredits me, but he is not crazy. John fucks me and then tells me it was a mistake, but he is not crazy. No >> Sherlock whispers with a soft growl. << The 'crazy' is me who wants to be free to express myself. I who fell in love with that idiot! >>.
<< I want to see the scene first and understand what it happened. So, if I consider it, I will have to talk to them >>.
John, Mycroft, Hataway and his men broke into Mary's house at just past midnight. They found her wrapped in an old shawl, confused by their presence. John let Hataway do his work by arresting her and he rushed into the house, followed by Mycroft, looking for Sherlock.
<< I had no doubts >>.
<< Mary! >> calls and his voice echoes in the room.
<< That's right, Greg! >> John exclaims. << If the trolley is not there, it means that someone has taken it >>.
<< Thanks >> John whispers, placing a hand on Greg's shoulder. He feels him twitching under his fingers. Greg is far away. John can touch him and speak to him, but he is far away. They are not sharing the stress and pain of that bad situation. The detective has decided to keep his concerns to himself. That secret that John confided to him was a low blow for Greg.
John agrees and places more kisses in Sherlock's hair. He stops for fear of being inappropriate. He doesn't wants to give him the idea of taking advantage of the situation.
John in turn remains silent and returns to abandon himself against the floor. Only then does Sherlock approach his lips again, which torments with slow, warm kisses.
<< Oh my! You ... you are Peter >> exclaims the girl, pointing to Fox with a voice so high as to startle everyone ... except the person concerned. Fox smiles at her and nods without taking his eyes off her stunned gaze.
Sherlock intercepts John’s hand and examines its wounds. He also takes the other and studies them for a few moments. Sherlock’s hands are cold, a sign of blood circulation that is not working as it should. John is about to point it out, but the sentence dies on his lips when he sees Sherlock grab the disinfectant. He pours some onto a cotton ball and gently dabs the wounds that McNeel's beating left on John’s knuckles.
John arrives in front of the indicated door. From the porthole takes a look into the interior of a large room where there are several women. Some sitting around tables, others standing talking in groups, others alone. Mary stands tall and powerful among all the others. She wears the blue uniform given by the structure and that is decidedly narrow and short of sleeves and legs for her.
<< Yes >> he admits. << Evil-Mary is a convinced homophobic and very aggressive. I think I should thank Molly. It is only thanks to her that I won the attentions of Mary-child >>.
Sherlock glances at the man and John realizes that they are communicating without opening their mouths. A series of small nods and expressions just mentioned, those that never escape the insightful sight of the consultant and apparently also that of Fox.
The voice of Mary- child calls Sherlock from his Mind Palace. He has no idea how much time has passed since the  evil-Mary locked him in there. He only knows that the morphine is over and that the abstinence crisis has started and is currently at its peak. He finds himself surrounded by his own vomit. He lying in the urine and stools that he has not even realized he has evacuated. Chills and cold sweats run from Sherlock's head to toe. The leg, oh God, the leg hurts Sherlock as if spiteful goblins were having fun prodding it continuously with red-hot pins.
<< You too lied to me >> he replies seraphic. << You said you hadn't been able to retrieve my suitcase >> he says, still pointing at it in his hands.
John approaches him, coming out of his stillness, and picks up the letter he can't help reread.
<< Definitely unusual, yes >> Sherlock admits, trembling more and more. Another retch surprises him and what he sputs is now a stinking white foam.
The burning of tears comes back to his eyes, but he pushes it away. He opens his eyes and meets John's gaze that appear infinitely sad.
<< No, you have none >> Sherlock confirm, seeing John's head bend over even more. << I ... I felt used >>.
<< That is, to get you back to the storage room? >>.
<< I am dedicating on it >>.
<< The police  hypothesized it to be a cemetery or a mass grave or that the corpses are victims of some mad assassin. I only know that everyone speculates here, but nobody moves and I need someone to move, Mr. Holmes >> and Sherlock has moved.
<< What do you want to say to me with this? >>.
"This isn't the final problem, though," James whispers as he gets close again.
<< I was away for a whole week, engaged in a complicated negotiation aimed at avoiding the onset of a third world conflict, John >> informs him, leaning on the back of the armchair, his hands crossed on his belly. << You will excuse me if I didn't have time to check what you and my beloved brother were combining >>.
<< Yes… it's true >> Sherlock says in tears, continuing to curse Paddington's phone call.
<< Here she comes. I sure hope she didn't get your wife's temperament, Giles. Even if I can't say how much better is yours >> says Sherlock, making the detective snort.
<< If this is the result, it would be worth fasting too, wouldn't you? >>.
<< So you're the little Ford >> he says trying to sweeten the voice.
"What if she occurred to her to ... play with me? What do I do? What the fuck I do, huh? "
<< I don't put the stic ... >>.
<< Yes, because that's the truth >> retorts him, trying to keep the courage alive.
<< I'm afraid so, Sherlock. As for what happens to you ... In your shoes, I too would prefer no one to know about it. It is embarrassing, and I believe this bastard continues to act undisturbed precisely because no one else has reported the abuse. Maybe these other victims said the same thing you said: that bastard just rubbed himself. Unfortunately, however, the idea to be use, and in a moment of malaise and physical weakness, still hurts >>.
John sighs. He has now stopped replying to the jokes that his mind proposes to him, using his sister's scornful voice and tone.
Hataway chuckles, shaking his head.
<< Mary! >> exclaims sitting down too quickly. A dizziness forces him to go back down. << Jesus, for a moment I thought I had just recovered from an overdose >>.
Finally the woman lets him go and Sherlock noisily sucks large mouthfuls of air, massaging his throat. A thousand bright dots blur his sight and a long and continuous whistle echoes in his ears.
>> says Sherlock with a different tone of voice. << Canadian-born violinist came to London for an audition >>.
<< No, I didn't mean that. It is unusual >>.
<< Where are your brothers now, Mary >> asks her and the woman suddenly shuts up. Sherlock fears that he has taken a false step. Now, she will fall into a trance and the violent Mary will come out and put an end to Sherlock's suffering once and for all. Instead, the Mary-child shakes her head and shrugs.
<< Oh >> just says the girl. << Did you think he had drugged the victim? >>.
<< No scene, Greg >> corrects him John. << I think it's the worst thing. His gaze. Its silence. Jesus, what an idiot I am! >>.
<< No, even if I would be tempted >>.Sherlock lets him go cautiously and John approaches Martin still lying on his side and grabs him by the collar of his shirt.
<< There is an atmosphere far from pleasant here >> he says with a smile. << Your faces don't say anything good. What is happening? >>.
John encourages Sherlock to continue talking about the case even during the exercises, which helps him do them without complaining. The foot flexes, now, much better and, although the balance is still precarious, the support on both feet seems to have been regained.
<< Damn, I couldn't have left you there! >> exclaims. << I lost my best boots, damn you. Why did you come to travel in this weather? >> she says, pointing to the storm outside the window.
<< However, they must have a common characteristic  >> Sherlock says, jumping in turn into the hole. He  kneeling next to her.
Sherlock sits on the bed and looks around, disoriented. The broken leg sends him a painful tingling muffled by morphine, but still capable of blocking it there.
<< Aren't you mad at me, Ed? >>.
He can't finish the sentence. Something hits Kelly in the head. The woman has only time to make a weak 'ah' before falling to the ground. The child barely has time to move away before that Kelly falls over him. Morgan puts himself between William and the skinny woman, armed with a baseball bat, standing in the doorway.
<< My colleagues and I are working to make the truth surface, detective. We do not hinder justice, on the contrary. When possible we help you >> replies the man, smiling cordially.
<< And are you so sure, that you don't even bother to do more detailed checks? >>.
<< Sherlock, Jesus, think! With the rhythms of life we have we cannot keep a dog >>.
<< Tell your dog to end it! >> shout out the man, trying to get closer to his wife, but Morgan growls even more, causing him to back away.
<< There, however, how is it going? >> John asks him with a nod of chin to Fox, concentrated on the laptop screen.
<< Yes, it is possible that our daughter had problems and that we did not notice or did not want to see them or ... or I don't know >> the man whispers. << What she did, however ... the way she did it ... is strange. Does not find? >> he hopeful question to Sherlock. John presses his arm against Sherlock's, who just turns to face him before answering.
One breath after another.
<< Oh, stop it! I'll stay here and wait for your return as a good boy, happy? These semples are extremely important and equally important is that nobody suspects who we are and what happened >>.
<< Lestrade! >> shouts Sherlock, who gets up hurry and, taking Greg by surprise, grabs the detective by the collar of his jacket. << There was no news about the discovery of the son of the Ford, right? >>.
<< Is this what you fear? >>.
<< Really? >> asks John surprised.
<< I told him that what had happened should never have happened. That it had been the fault of alcohol and that it was better for both of us to forget everything >>.
He shudders from head to foot, wet with sweat. Sherlock looking for comfort in a self-embrace that, however, very little warms him. Those images, those terrible images come back to him overbearing.
<< Sherlock would not be the case we went home? Greg should have already sent you the drawings of the girl >> John exclaims, crossing his arms over his chest, intimately annoyed by Sherlock's attitude.
<< Ok, Sherlock, now you can leave her >> says John, approaching his man. << William and Morgan are fine, the Fords too and the case is solved. Let Greg take Sharon away >> he adds, placing his hand in the middle of Sherlock's contracted back. At that secure contact, Sherlock relaxes. He turns to him, as if he only now realizes his presence. He nods and lets Sharon go. Immediately, five agents take over the woman, passed out from the pain of her arm's fracture. They handcuff her and lead her away.
<< Hey, Billy, I think you're right, you know? Adults lose sight of priorities and sometimes forget to be simple human beings. Maybe this story will help your dad to learn that it is good not to underestimate others >>.
<< Get me the phone records of the last two weeks of Sherlock's number and ask the technicians to let me have all the shots that concern him in the shortest possible time >> with a gesture of the hand Mycroft invites her to go. The woman nods, turns on her heels and leaves the room, obedient like a soldier.
This time the woman returns to the room with a vial in her hand and Sherlock realizes that, just before vibrating the blow that most likely would have killed him, something inside Mary must have warned her that his condition was linked to the absence of morphine .
<< Philipp, shut up! >> Lestrade incinerates him. Anderson, resentful for being scolded, leaves the door. << Sherlock, tell me what you know. I don't have all day and I'm dying of heat >>.
John is amazed and sees his own amazement reflected in Greg's proven face. It is not only for the long monologue held by the English government, but for the many awards in favor of the detective. The sentence with which Mycroft closed his sermon, then, will also be put there to get the right effect, but summarizes many things. Things that John does not know, some that he may have guessed and others that perhaps will remain unexplained .
<< The flatmate >> she says.
<< Well ... there is always a place in the dormitory for you, Captain. It is not a problem for me if you wants to stay. And you too, Mr. Holmes >> the detective says, turning to Mycroft. << I have a communication from Scotland Yard here for you, colleague >> he adds, handing Greg a circular. He takes it, reads it and snorts, rolling his eyes.
<< Yes. It was my favorite game. I had built a tricorn hat and a wooden sword. Red Beard and I ran together in the garden of Musgrave, the house where I grew up. We played together for five years. Dogs' life is too short, John. Or maybe humans's life is too long >>.
<< Oh… good morning Mr inspector >> she mumbles, keeping her eyes down. It makes an impression to see so much submissiveness in a creature so large as to give the idea of being able to land men of his and Hataway's size with one shot.
<< Since Silver's death, the bickering between Mr and Ms Ford increased >> says Kelly. << Billy has lost a lot of weight. He didn't want to eat and every morning I found the bed wet. Billy his very embarazed for this and asks me to promise him that I don't tell nothing to his parents. He would like to say it to Ms Ford, but He his afraid that  this thing could escape to her during one of their quarrels >>.
John smiles and lets his fingers slide from the puppy's soft head to Sherlock's cold hand.
<< Exactly! Here's what struck me about her. Her face wrapped in a scarf and huge hands held in gloves kept coming back to my mind. Even in a dream ... >> John stops abruptly at the memory of what then turned into a nightmare. << Sherlock is there, Mycroft. That woman found him and God only knows why she didn't say anything >>.
<< Not for us >> sighs John.
<< She was arrested, Sherlock. She is in prison now, where it is right that she is for what she has done to you and to all the others >> Mycroft explains to him and in a slightly too peremptory way, notes John.
<< I always thought that excess does not lead to anything good, John, and you? >>.
<< It is a spite >> says William, immediately seeking Sherlock's approval. The consultant give him it. << Mum listened to me when I showed to her the photos, not like dad. She loved Silver like me and knew he was fine and could not have died of old age. She thought like me that someone poisoned him. I heard she talked about it with dad, but he kept saying it was a nonsense, because Silver would barked if someone tried to enter >>.
<< Sherlock! >> John calls him, who does not find it very appropriate to take sides of one parent rather than the other.
<< It is possible that he was already sick before. I found an anomaly of the mitral valve. That man should never have gone to a sauna with a heart in those conditions. Poor guy. He would have needed help and instead was the victim of abuse >>.
<< I thought, Mr. Fox, that you and your colleagues were fighting to bring the truth to the surface >> Mycroft begins, sitting down theatrical in his armchair.
<< Don't think you can handle it like this >> John points him with his finger. << At the end of the investigation I want to be made aware of everything, Sherlock, have I been clear? >>.
Greg claws John's shoulder again, who would like to shake him off and hit the old obtuse and prejudiced policeman.
“You said you would never adapt to survive. That you wouldn't have been like me ”Mycroft's voice. Far. Weak as a whisper. However, Sherlock does not believe he is adapting to anything. It's just that he no longer hears anything.
<< I am here! A moment of patience! >> John shout down the stairs. He opens the door and finds himself in front of Lestrade.
Take care of yourself, brother
<< Could I take your beats before leaving? >>.
<< And since when would we be? Why, sorry, but I missed it >>.
<< What do you mean, doctor >> asks Hataway, amused by his statement.
<< Why? >> asks him, amazed.
<< You solved the case. Why? >> asks him, by moving the topic to something more comfortable for him.
<< You are really so brave, Eddy >> she tells him, by printing a kiss on Sherlock's forehead.
"If you are resurrected and you want a beer, you will find me in the usual pub." writes Greg.
<< This room has been not only cleaned, but recently disinfected >> Mycroft tells him, wrinkling his nose at the intense smell of ammonia. << The mattress is more loose than that of the other rooms, a sign that it has hosted someone for a long time. The fireplace has just been turned off >>.
<< Hey, where are you going? >> cries Greg.
<< There were also the calls >> continues Ulrika.
<< The irregular I put behind Lizzy offered me a shot and I accepted it out of courtesy >>.
"What the hell are you doing, Johnny?"
Those clear and clear eyes are so innocent and at the same time aware of the answer. John smiles at him and realizes Sherlock doesn't know how to answer his question. Sherlock has decided to be brave and denounce what that bastard has done to him, facing what will be the people's judgments. This criminal investigation made John understand even more, if ever it were needed, how strong he is for this brilliant and courageous man. It's up to John now to be brave. He approaches Sherlock’s lips and places a light kiss on it.
The heavy footsteps announce that Mary is about to return and Sherlock would like to scream and at the same time to have the power to lock that damned door with the only force of thought.
<< What? >> John asks.
<< Of corse, it doesn't make sense! >> Sherlock exclaims. << ‘Acting under an altered state of consciousness’, this formula is a mitigating factor, even for the most heinous of the murders. It matters little if the person has a consciousness altered by a drug, alcohol or schizophrenia >>.
<< I hope you are right. Rapists are a category that I just can't stand >> John says, leaving the room.
"It is terrible not to be welcomed for what you are from your family," Harry's voice whispers in his mind and John really struggles, this time, to hold back his tears.
John clenches his fists and tries to stay calm. Mycroft's hand rests on his shoulder and John is amazed at the calming effect that that simple gesture can have on him. Mycroft says nothing. He just squeeze John's shoulder before withdrawing his hand. The phone rings and the inspector does not let him arrive on the second ring. He mutters a few monosyllables before hanging up.
At his feet there is  the body of a child no more than five years old.
<< No, no, John, this is not my intent >> reassures him, pushing away what he said with a quick gesture of the hand. << You will agree with me, however, that you have a remarkable resistance to the effects of alcohol, while Sherlock definitely does not >>.
John realizes that his way of looking at Sherlock has changed. Everything that John previously thought about and that he represses by repeating that 'Sherlock is married to his job and uninterested in such human and earthly things as sex and effusions', now they come overbearing to his mind, also affecting his body.
A deaf and sudden noise snatchesm Sherlock from his Mind Palace. It usually takes a lot longer to get him out of there, but in recent days, his defenses are apparently much higher than usual. Mary is bent over Sherlock again, intent on straightening the bed.
John is tense and ready to return to the charge.
<< As always, Fox. But I think you have something more urgent to tell me >> cut short and the journalist does not go further with questions and curiosities.
<< When? >> John asks her with so much emphasis to scare her.
<< This place is full of cameras >> says Sherlock, who pulled up his sleeves and unbuttoned two more buttons of his shirt. << There is one at each entrance >> indicates them. << But there can only be one place where there aren't >>.<< The changing rooms >> John nods, snatching a satisfied smile from Sherlock.<< Exactly >> he says, going to the men's locker room. << Stay there still and don't touch anything! >> intimate them entering.
Sherlock brings the violin under his chin and closes his eyes. He stay for a few moments with the bow on the strings, listening. Then he hears a sound. Greve, prolonged, which spreads from the shoulder to the left arm and on the face. When the vibrations reach the chest, then he takes a deep breath making them expand from there to the totality of its being.
<< You no longer demand anything! >> shout out the woman, in a tone capable to silencing Morgan. << I have had enough, Albert, and this story made me realize that I wast too much time. Whatever you want to tell me you can communicate it to my lawyer >>.
<< Have you noticed the conditions in which my father is involved, I guess? >> he says with a remarkable language property for his age. Both nod and exchange glances. << He is already taking too many from my mother, lawyers and judges. I do not want this thing to come to give him other concerns >>.
<< yes, of corse >> Sherlock answers, resolutely.
Sherlock does not question the truthfulness of his brother's words. Nobody more than Mycroft would move seas and mountains to find him and make sure he is well. Certainly it is a huge ball-breaker that insinuates himself into his life, by pretending to be informed of everything and to control him. It is also true, however, that Mycroft is the only one who has a valid reason to save him. If only to prevent him from throwing  mud on the reputation of Holmes family, as their father used to shout. That's why Sherlock decides to listen to him this time.
Slowly Sherlock goes to the lift and goes up to his room. He opens the door with the magnetic card and drops on the sofa. He tears off his fake beard, feeling his skin burn, and tries to restore order in his head.
‘I give for you to give’ from Latin
<< As grandfather! >> she exults. << Play how you're feeling now >> asks him, sitting on the chair. Mary puts her elbows over her knees and places her square face on her hands, excited at the idea of hearing him play.
<< I ... I have no idea >> Sherlock admits won by the tremors. << I'm not foolproof. Some cases I just can't solve them >>.
<< Oh ... yes. Animals need food and I need something too >> she replies, blushing conspicuously. Mary steals glances at John, who is struggling to sketch a polite smile.
<< You look like an homeless. It's not a good thing >> says the woman, pulling a freehand razor out of the pocket of her flannel trousers. Sherlock shivers. He has no intention of losing his nose or being scarred or slaughtered by Mary's coarse ways.
<< Who is Peter? >> Greg asks with a frown. He turns his gaze to Sherlock, who nods, giving him to understand that everything is in order and the detective catches the message.
<< Where are you, little bastard? Where are you?! >>.
<< He is in love with me, Greg >> whispers to the point that the detective has to get a little closer to him in order to hear. << I thought he wasn't able to love. Jesus does nothing but reiterate how stupid feelings are! Instead I saw this love. I heard it and ... he also told me >>.
<< Mister Holmes? I ... I thought he came to the police station. He left the club on November 10th in the morning in the car he had rented >>.
<< Hey wait there, you two, I can not make you go down alone! You risk polluting the evidence >> shouts to them Greg. The child and the dog are immobilized a step away from the door. The detective reaches them, holds out his hand to William who takes it with a grimace and, followed by Morgan, leave the room.
The door opens and the light hurts his eyes once again. The last. From the bottom of his desperate condition, Sherlock can see Mary rise in her mighty size. The ruthless gaze, the mouth a pale clean line. She says nothing. She stands there, one hand at the door and the other along the side.
The doorbell rings by interrupting Sherlock's loud arguments.
<< My son? >> Sherlock asks in amazement.
<< I'm Sherlock Holmes and I think you know who I am >> Sherlock says. Something moves from inside the wardrobe.
<< Also count on me for the continuation of the investigations >>.
<< I don't know how it can be possible, but in any case after all these days any disguise will be extinct. Obviously if he is still alive >>.
Molly, however, does not ask questions. It must be the result of too much time she spent with Sherlock.John analyzes the urine searching some drug. It finds nothing, however. No opiate or hypnotic.
“… But only for one you are fantastic. Unbelievable. Astonishing ".
<< We can go >> says Sherlock, grabbing the custody of his violin.
<< No. I don't feel anything >> Sherlock replies, shaking himself from his numbness. Sketch a smile just looking at it.
<< Because he's wrong, it's true. He has committed an ignoble lightness, but he sincerely cares about you, Sherlock >>.
<< They do it every afternoon at 4, before the tea >>.
<< And you are lowering the average IQ of all those present, Anderson >> replys Sherlock. William holds a laugh by sinking his face into the consultant's curls.
<< With the nanny. I left Morgan with him >> he adds and the two men exchange a worried look . << There is no time to waste! >> Sherlock shouts and with John rushes out of the apartment. Greg communicates to his men in Milton Keynes the place where the Fords can be held prisoner.
<< You shouted. Many times >> she says. Sherlock didn't hear her go up the stairs. He didn't realize how firm she was at the door. Mary-child's eyes look at him curiously, leaning on the chair next to the bed.
<< Tomorrow the three men are at work in the morning. Only one of them, however, will be present at the Aufguss session, just like today, and it is not said to be him >>.
<< Fortunately, the intelligence is inherited through the mother >> Sherlock winks and the boy smiles. << Did she tell you to lock yourself in the closet? >>. William nods.
"I'm not dead yet," Sherlock thinks, as he tries to rub the frozen and bare limbs. A painful grasp harps his stomach, causing him to vomit at almost regular intervals.
The tone and the way in which Sherlock gives this news exacerbate the sense of embarrassment of the ex soldier.
<< Yeah >> Sherlock whispers, taking up the cell phone. << I need advice from an expert >>.
The thundering voice of the chief commissioner startles the small group gathered in front of the desk. William jump into Sherlock's arms and Morgan starts to growl at the man in a suit and tie that, hands on his hips, looks at them furiously.
<< The calls? >> asks Greg.
<< Take a nap now, you're dying of sleep. Do we have any food to give him? >>.
<< I am George Lestrade >>.
Nothing even towards the Abbott farm, the only one they have failed to contact, given the communications that always stop there with these climatic conditions. The inspector tried to convince John of the impossibility of Mary's involvement in this story.
The documents were in what was that woman's bedroom. A room that does not have to be very different from the one where Mary are sleeping now. A simple bed, a small wardrobe, an old desk, few personal effects, few clothes and all worn and many years old. Mary Abbott gives the idea of never having had anything. Nothing except five dolls. The dolls stood next to each other on the window sill. Porcelain dolls with ancient and well-worked clothes, with glazed eyes, pink cheeks and heart-shaped lips. Needless to say, they contributed to making the environment even more disturbing. These dolls must have been Mary's companions in those long days spent isolated from all sentient life. John's heart had tightened and he hadn't understood how he could feel tenderness and pain for the woman who almost killed the man he loves.
"Idiot!" he would like to conclude, but let the sentence die in laughter. John turns his gaze several times to her confused face and then turns him away, shaking his head.
Greg faces him. A palm from John's face, Greg looks at him with stern eyes that he has never seen. Don't turn to him, at least.
<< Okay, I'll let him live. Just let me get a concept into his head >> John says.
<< Mr detective, my dad was kidnap, so I am the landlord no. Do you know? >> William retorts, putting the hands to his hips. This time also John joins Sherlock's spontaneous laughter. Kelly's reproach falls on deaf ears.
Quote from 'The seven percent solution' by Nicholas Meyer
<< Your mother's novel talk about a woman obsessed with religion, who becomes a serial killer. She says that she is a merciful mother sent by God to punish sinners. Trivial, obvious plot. I'm sure that if your mother has success only because she is your father's wife,  >> Sharon says, climbing the stairs slowly.
<< You saw you too, Captain. That woman is big and strange, but she has the soul of a child just six years old. If she had rescued someone would have told me >>.
<< It is not easy to understand the human soul. Trying to understand what a teenager lives is almost impossible. They become easy preys of evil intentions and ... chemical solutions to the pain of living >> Mycroft says, taking a look at his brother.
<< Your children defend you, and a parent defended so heartily can only be a good parent. Not only. Your children want to protect you. They acknowledge that you have been able to endure so much and that you are tired. As Dr. Watson said, however, they are young and still inclined to take upon themselves faults and responsibilities that do not belong to them. This also shows how well you have educated them to respect and a sense of duty. I therefore believe that you are blaming yourself that for a blame that isn't yours. I think you have already received too many, absurd blame and that therefore you can exempt yourself from doing the same. My brother >>, Mycroft says, pointing at Sherlock, strangely silent and too still, << acted in an attempt to save the salvable and do justice to everyone. Fulfill the desire of your children to keep you out of further worries and resolve a situation, which turned out to be too complex without the right means, trying not to cause you trouble but only bring you good news. It is not the first time that I tell you how I think Sherlock consider you an older brother much better than me >> Mycroft says, taking a look at Sherlock who just shifts his gaze to his feet. << And it is not even the first time that I thank you for what you have done for him in the past and for what you are still doing. So allow me to do you the favor: you saved my brother, let me do everything I can to resolve the unpleasant situation in which your daughter found herself stuck >>.
<< 'The other' thought that you and Edward were together. She hit a lot him the first day >> she confesses sadly, confirming John's intuition. Johanna is none other than him. Sherlock had to change his name in a female name to be able to tell her how John used him. Why Sherlock let himself go to such confidences John does not understand it. Maybe Mary threatened him in some way, or ... or, more simply, in the absurdity of what Sherlock was experiencing, he felt the need to let off steam with someone. Of course Sherlock is not the type of person that tell his own business around, but John himself is realizing how sweet, welcoming and protective this version of Mary is. And he realizes, too, how she has become infatuated with the consulting detective, to the point of hating with all her might the woman who dared to harm him.
<< Then it is possible that what you call 'sensation' is actually a detail that your eye has caught, but that your conscience has not registered it.
<< What should I think about, huh? >> scout Sherlock. << His hands? His breath on my neck? The splash that wet my skin? To his tongue in my mouth? Should I be thinking about this? >>.
<< Oh my! What are you saying? I don't want to know these things, Johnny! >> she says horrified, vaguely assuming the tone of their mother. John laughs amused. << Why on earth do you call me after ... well come on you understand. It's not normal! >>.
<< What else should I do? >> Mycroft retorts, shrugging. << As I already told you, what happened between you and my brother is not my business. Any kind of involvement is none of my business. What fault would you have if not that of behaving like most men? Of course, I would have hoped it would not be so and, of course, especially Sherlock hoped it would.
The man gasps against Sherlock's ear until his verses turn into a muffled cry against his neck. Something hot pours on Sherlock's abdomen, while his assailant slows down more and more until he stops.
<< One only! >> Mary exclaims surprise. << I have five >> she says proudly.
<< You lie >> he says.
<< I can't stand contact lenses, Sherlock >>.
<< But it was you who put him on her >> Greg continues, moving away from him, while still keeping his hands on his shoulders. << I don't know what I would have done if Lizzy had made that crazy gesture. She is now destroyed and it will take time for she to recover, for everyone to find a bit of balance. But she's alive and that's what counts >> Greg says, smiling while his eyes get wet.
<< Yes, you are an idiot! >> says Greg, crossing his arms over his chest, his severe face. << Though one cannot claim to be loved, if I was in Sherlock's shoes, I would have hitten you, John. Because of your non-existent self-esteem, you hurt Sherlock just when, also thanks to alcohol, he showed you his feelings, the ones he keeps damn well hidden. Well, at least now I know why we're here! >>.
<< You are such a drama queen >> he chuckles, placing light kisses on Sherlock's completely inert pale hand.
Sherlock is located immediately next to this corps. It lies on his back, his glazed gaze fixed on the sky and an expression of frozen amazement on his face. This man was hit in the chest by a gunshot. Straight to the heart, with no escape.
John goes to get the first aid kit in his bag and takes care of Sherlock’s injuries with a safe hand. Sherlock sets an unspecified point before him and is too silent.
<< Oh my God, you can't imagine how grateful I am with yuo, Mr. Holmes >> she says, stamping a wet kiss on Sherlock's cheek, before moving away and hugging John this time. << You saved us, we owe your life, thank you >> she adds, smacking a kiss on the doctor's cheek. << You too, Morgan. You fought like a wolf >> Ms O'Hara says, going down to caress Morgan, who can finally satisfay his desire for pampering.
<< What should we have done? >> John interrupts him. << Rest assured, basking in the idea that Sherlock Holmes will surely be trapped in a ski club in the mountains? >>.
<< That Johanna, instead ... >>.
<< I didn't understand if you tried to take revenge or if you really like all of this >> Martin roars in Sherlock’s ear while holding his head against the wall. << You know? I do not give a damn >> laughs Martin, starting to undress Sherlock.
<< You still gave way to talk about you and throw mud on this family! >> growls, moving threateningly towards him. << I should have killed you then. I made a serious mistake in thinking you were already dead. You have always been stubborn, William. I had to expect that you had a rather hard head >>.
"She is reasoning without becoming catatonic" Sherlock notes, fascinated by this new and unusual thing, but fortunately without danger and pain.
<< I was, in fact. Sherlock dedicated time to this little one and now he is into a coma now
<< You tickle me! >> he says, laughing.
<< No. You are yourself. You have never done anything that could have led others to think that we are together >>.
<< Lestrade back here? He will have forgotten something ... >> he stops, by refining his hearing. John looks at the door, amazed by the consultant's behavior. He hears footsteps slowly climbing the stairs.
<< But ... no, come on, it's too early >>.
<< Not bad >> Sherlock nods, savoring with his eyes the beauty of this unusual John Watson, who blushes evidently. A nervous laugh escapes the lips of the doctor who brings a hand to stroke his neck.
The girl shouts hysterically and shackes her body, moving away and beating again against the wall.
<< Deductions, John, no guesses >>.
<< Do not leave me >> John whispered to him like a mantra, holding Sherlock close to him. << It doesn't matter if you'll never want to see me again, I accept it, but don't leave me. Don't make me live in a world where you are not there, please >>.
Nobody is in the living room. It is even quite in order.
<< Bad story >> she notes serious. << What do you have to do with it? >> asks him and John doesn't hold back from being annoyed this time.
<< Was the master an adult? >> John asks.
<< And how did you do it? >>.
<< Okay. But do not make our names. We will be undercover, so you do not be surprised if you sees us different than we are >> Sherlock smiles, turning to John, who looks at him in amazement. Sherlock will also agree to do the doormat with wealthy clients, but that doesn't mean he has no intention of taking revenge on John for it.
<< Do you understand what? >> asks John, realizing how his tone of voice has changed, which Sherlock has also noticed.
Sherlock sketches a smile, taking a sip of the tea and takes time. John lets him do it. Patience isn't what he needs, no matter what the journalist says about anger management.
<< How about? Do we go to the pub for a beer? >> John asks to the puppy, that looks at him curiously and then scratches one ear with his hind leg. << I take it for a yes >>.
"And you, on the other hand, were expecting declarations of eternal love and much more tender sex," shakes Moriarty.
The man takes a few steps back. He puts a hand on his face and shakes his head. The sight of one's own blood has the power to detonate Martin. He responds to the punch by hitting Sherlock in the face.
<< I authorized him to help us >> says Greg with perhaps a little too much emphasis. He doesn't like Mycroft's seraphic and feignedly friendly being. << Mycroft, I ask you to allow Fox and his team to try to destroy that portal. It is not enough for me to have brought in prison those who risked pushing my daughter to commit suicide. I want to prevent those who created that abomination from reaping other innocent victims >>.
<< I want you. God, as I want you >> he says, letting his hands slip in Sherlock's pants to grab his firm buttocks.
John leaves the apartment eager for a breath of light air that contrasts the heavy deadly atmosphere in which he has been far too much. On this morning in mid-June the gray sky foreshadows impending rain and certainly does not help to find a good mood.
<< No. The investigation has nothing to do with it >> John chuckles nervously, caressing that thin but strong wrist.
<< In the dog's story Sharon talks about a cottage by the lake >> says John, who immediately goes into action, leafing through the pages of the manuscript.
without problems, but this is Greg this time.
The door closed and Sherlock sighs. His stomach is in turmoil. He lifts the lid again and tries to eat but he can't. He takes the violin, checks the tuning and starts playing.
The doctor does not want to fall into his tricks and in response simply limits his gaze to him.
<< This is not a good thing to say about me >>.
<< And Greg's daughter ended up on this hell >> John sighs, placing his hand on Sherlock's shoulder.
<< Tell me about your nightmare >>.
<< Sure. First of all the duty and then ... sorry, bad choice of words >> chuckles to dissolve the tension always so palpable between them.
<< William, this bad story made me understand many things and I made an important decision >>.
They take their leave of him, who takes them back to the lift smiling cordially, until the doors close.
<< Really? >> John snorts biting a biscuit.
<< Have you ever thought about it, John? >>.
<< He is not dead, Mycroft. I feel ... yes, I feel it. He's still alive, Mycroft. One like Sherlock is not killed so easily >>.
<< December 10, 1999. Reginald Connery. 38 years old. Unmarried. No living relative. Exposed fracture of tibia and fibula. Withdraw £ 20,000 from his checking account and 4 well-listed stocks. Settled on December 30, 1999 >>.
Sherlock smiles at him. He doesn't know what will happen, but he feels he is doing the right thing.
<< The situation >> he answers, keeping his eyes down on the massage he is carrying out on Sherlock's wrist.
<< Relax, Sherlock >> John replies beyond the door.
<< I dreamed about my father >> Sherlock says, shaking her hand. << He ... was a monster >> stops, his throat tightened with emotion. << He killed my mother and her lover
<< Did you notice something different in her? >> John asks. The woman shakes her head firmly.
His heart begins to beat wildly when he sees Sherlock walking towards him. John shifts the weight of his body several times from one foot to the other, feeling strangely uncomfortable. It is the first time, this one, that he will find himself talking to Sherlock face to face after that absent-minded kiss that he placed on Sherlock's forehead the night before. A trivial matter, which could also be considered normal between two friends. What harm is there, after all, in a gesture of affection? However, this is not their case. The tension between them is so high that it sometimes leads him to leave the house just to be able to breathe. Even now John wishes he could get out of that house, get away from him.
<< I at least eat, Sherlock >>.
<< The moment we discovered him, he deactivated all his accounts and we lost his contact. It would have been difficult to trace the real host from the fictional Caribbean one, but at least we would have had a chance. Now not even this >> Fox snorts. << As I said, we will continue the research of other cells around the world, in order to eradicate them. The portal no longer exists and many people linked to it have been arrested. We just have to hope that no emuls are born and that the young in crisis can really be helped by those who are able to do it.
Sherlock looks away. He can't stand John’s stern eyes right now.
<< I'll take you to the train station, colleague >> Hataway intrudes, giving one of his men orders to prepare the car.
He discovers, John, by kissing the man who loves, how curative the truth is. Once the weight of fears, of the sense of duty, of the memories has been removed, he lives this beautiful moment with serenity, touching Sherlock's long and slim body with his hands, holding him in an embrace perhaps too possessive, but which he now needs.
The window half a meter from the bed is full of condensation. A residue of snow has deposited at the base of each of the eight squares in which it is divided. It seems that the storm that was announced out there, and that he should haven't met, is doing his best.
<< Between one thing and another, you skipped your exercises today >> John points out, taking advantage of a Sherlock's short break. The consultant looks like a boy caught with his hands in the parent's wallet. He finds boring the exercises that the physiotherapist has imposed on him and tries in every way to escape. More than boring, John thinks that they are painful and that Sherlock tries not to do them so as not to show how much his leg is giving him problems. He try to appear stronger and indestructible than actually is.
<< I haven't save her >> Sherlock whispers.
<< We won a stay here >> John replies.
<< You never do it >>.
<< Don't frighten me >> John whispers, placing a kiss on that usually cold hand.
<< Don't lie to me! >> shouts, grabbing him by the shoulders. << You were sitting up there and suddenly I didn't see you anymore. Did you meet him? What did he do to you? Tell me! >> shakes him violently.
