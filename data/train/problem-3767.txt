to dedicate as much energy into making Dean feel amazing as Dean did for him. He wanted to take his time and learn all the ways to pull moans and gasps from the man he loved, all the ticklish places, and all the spots that would make Dean shudder and ask for more.
His fingers glided through the slippery mess he’d made, gently finding their way to where Dean was silky and wet.
People were starting to leave the bar. It wasn't that late, but it had been a good show, and most of them had been standing though all of it.
Castiel still looks so pained, and now Dean can see how tired he looks. He’d assumed Cas had slept soundly last night like he had, but now he isn’t so sure that’s the case.
That's when the hunter glanced in through the window, and saw a woman gagged and tied to a chair in the living room. He looked back frantically to the man, who blinked, revealing black eyes.
Massages weren’t something he had much experience with. Dean had given him a few in the past when a tension headache had gotten so bad it brought tears to his eyes. Staying up with him, loosening the knots in his shoulders and stretching the tendons in his neck until the pounding in his head subsided, and he could sleep.
“Tilt your head back and close your eyes,” Dean said, almost whispering. This felt too intimate for anything else.
“No, Cas, look,” Dean scoots his chair closer. “I’m sorry, okay? What I did... I thought I was protecting myself. And you. But all I did was make things worse.”
Dean had dropped the fork he’d forgotten was in his hand and pulled the angel into a hug. The weight that had been growing in his chest for days had lifted instantly, and Dean had been downright giddy.
Cas paused again, breaking eye contact with the hunter. He toyed with a loose thread in the sheets, watching it like it was the most fascinating thing since sliced bread.
Deciding to just leave and call Bobby from somewhere else, Sam turned and started for the door. His phone started vibrating in his pocket, and for a moment, he thought about ignoring it, but he didn't see anyone else in the parking lot or even on the highway. Cas was still in the truck, patiently waiting. He was alone, and Bobby had been calling all day... The hunter picked up on the second ring.
Dean sips his coffee, humming appreciatively when the faint taste of cinnamon mixes with the dark roast. Castiel likes to add a little to the grounds, and Dean loved the boost it gives the coffee. Between that and the memory foam mattress and the shower pressure in the bunker, Dean feels he’s getting a little spoiled. Motels and gas station breakfasts were never great, but now that he knew what he was missing, he got homesick on longer hunts.
The angel mumbled something in Enochian that neither Sam nor Dean understood, before his legs gave out and he fell against the car. Sam rushed around to help his brother load the drunk angel into the back seat, both of them grumbling at how heavy he was. Dean climbed in after, saying he would ride with him. Sam smirked and returned to the driver's seat.
“Because this is one of the few ways I can get you to eat fruit,” Castiel teases. “And you like them.”
“Exactly. And each time, all we did was make things worse. We hurt each other, we nearly lost each other more than once.”
“Then what is this about? I might not be an angel anymore, Dean, but I know you. I know something is wrong. What aren’t you telling me?”
Castiel wasn't helping the situation. He had one hand on Dean's shoulder, and the other running through the hunter's hair, holding his head in place.
Mostly, Dean was so happy he didn’t even mind the waiting. But he was concerned. He knew Castiel was new to being human, new to being in a relationship, new to intimacy, that was a lot of new all at once. It would overwhelm anyone. Adding sex into the mix might just be too much right now. If Cas wanted to wait, that was fine.
Castiel must have smelled his concern. He answered Dean’s questions by pulling him into a kiss. It was gentle and intense, and Dean hummed into it happily. His hands rested on Cas’s hips, toying with the hem of his shirt in a silent question.
Dean nodded and moved his hands out of the way. Cas leaned in to kiss him, just once. Short and fairly chaste, but it made Dean smile.
Walking over to the monitors, one by one he turned them off, tears rolling down his cheeks as he did. The steady beeping and humming of the machines had become something he was used to hearing in the back ground. Silence seemed wrong.
Sam was sure he saw Dean's eyes flash green and his features soften for a second. Cas reached out and held on to Dean's arm, looking up at the stranger in front of him.
Bobby was pacing the room, trying to calm down. Sam had taken off a while ago, heading to town for a supply run.
Eventually they fell silent, both just staring up at the beautiful night sky illuminated by a full moon. Dean smiled at the ex-angel on his right. Reaching over, the hunter wrapped his arm around him and squeezed in a one armed hug. He felt Cas lean into it, and he let his arm rest on the guy's shoulder after, both content to watch the stars with each other in comfortable silence.
“I am very sorry that has been your experience in the past. You deserved people who saw who you are and loved you for that, not for who they were pretending you could be. But I am not them. And, if you would let me, I would be honoured to show you how I see you.”
Dean only fought harder to get free. Sam was at least slightly relieved to see that his brother's unnatural eyes were focused on Magnus and not him. If anyone should be the focus of Dean's rage, it should be that sick fucker. With a loud groan and a sudden snap, one link in the chains snapped. That's all it took. Dean practically launched himself across the room, eyes locked on his target, blade raised and ready.
Groaning as he moved to stretch stiff muscles, he heard the bed beneath him creak and strain under the weight. He slowly became aware of a warm, pleasant weight against his back and around his waist. It felt so familiar, so comforting, so full of love that Dean was sure this must be a dream. Yup, a dream. That's why he didn't have a hangover, and why there was actually sunlight in the room. Even half asleep, he knew that last night the only window in here had been covered up with a towel. Still, even as he convinced himself he was dreaming, the warm embraced didn't fade away. He could swear this is what it used to feel like when Cas held him. That's when Dean noticed the smell. It almost smelt like...but it couldn't be. It smelt like Cas.
His lack of sleep, and his morning cleaning spree, are finally catching up to Dean, and the coffee isn’t doing the trick anymore. Sam, thankfully, doesn’t push for more info as Dean makes himself some toast. For a while, they eat in easy silence, and Dean appreciates Sam’s quiet support. He’s almost feeling better. Until Castiel joins them.
Dean's resolve broke with a choked sob. Even though he'd been sure it wouldn't be much longer, and had been readying himself each day for Cas to tell him to end it, finally hearing it was different.
“Okay,” Cas said, kissing him again. He felt Dean melt into the bed below them, a happy hum trapped between their lips.
He’d watched as one angel made a cut at the base of Castiel’s throat. Once she’d coaxed the grace out into a separate stone bowl, the second angel placed her hand over the cut, healing it instantly. The next part had been up to Castiel. He’d taken the bowl that held his swirling grace and began chanting in Enochian. As he began repeating the chant, the other two joined in. The grace shone brighter and brighter until it changed from a cool blue to a blinding white. From there, one angel cradled it in her hand, gentle compared to how she had to reach into Castiel’s chest to place it.
They both took in deep breaths of the fresh air. It was nice after hours in the somewhat dingy and very humid bar.
“Cas,” Dean said, his throat suddenly dry. “I thought... I mean, you... fuck, Cas, I thought you were a beta!”
He’d probably thought Cas was asking if he could remove his boxers, and let out a sharp, surprised exhale when Cas lowered his head to mouth at Dean through the fabric. His lips and tongue gently worked over the thin material where Dean was hard and wet, pulling noises from him that sent white hot lines of pleasure through Castiel’s core.
It was just past noon, and Sam and Bobby decided to check around outside the house and make sure all the angel/demon proofing was still good. It might not stop the leviathans, but it gave the hunters a few less things to worry about. Bobby was looking over the symbols painted on the house and nearby trees while Sam stood guard with a sawed off shotgun, watching surrounding woods. The youngest Winchester decided to bring up what he'd noticed about Dean, to see if Bobby had notice the same thing.
“It’s fine, I get it,” he said. “When Jess went into heat, we had to specifically request a beta to deliver our takeout because I went all red-eyed on the first alpha who showed up with pizza.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s had this conversation with Cas a million times in his head and it never went well. What if Cas left him? What if he never wanted to see Dean again? He said he didn’t want to lose the trust between them again, but hadn’t Dean already ensured that would happen? He’d lied right from the start. How could Cas ever trust him now?
There was no way Cas would stay after this. It’s too big. And Dean is too scared. He wants to keep his life with Castiel. Imperfect as it is, it’s still worlds better than the alternative.
Dean wakes up then, and his throat is sore like he’s been crying in his sleep. Nausea swirls in his stomach, and when he sits up, he realizes he’s sweat right through his shirt and into the sheets.
doing the dishes, “More than purgatory, Dean. I hate this more than purgatory.” But he still did them when it was his turn, grumbling the entire time.
Castiel could tell that Dean was crying, he heard it in the blond's voice, but he only held his hunter tighter. Tears clouded the angel's eyes as well.
Magnus' smug grin was long gone, replaced with wide eyes as he stumbled backwards. Dean was quick though. He grabbed the man by the throat with his free hand and lifted him off the ground, before slamming him against the nearest wall. Sam heard a /crack/, and he wasn't sure if Dean had broken part of the wall, or Magnus' spine. Letting go of his neck, Dean grabbed him by his hair instead. Sam heard the brunet let out a pained grunt, followed by him choking as he tried to breath. Dean brought the first blade to his prey's neck, and slowly, without letting his intense eyes leave Magnus', pushed the blade through until it touched the wall. The dead body fell to the floor, bleeding out and leaving the hunter holding a dripping head.
Sam didn't know what to do. He was confused and a little at a loss for words. Had he been right in assuming his brother and the angel had been more than friends?
Bobby shook his head, wishing he could rid himself of that memory. The boy was like a son to him, no parent ever wants to see their kid go through something like that. And though Bobby didn't know exactly how Dean felt, because the circumstances had been drastically different, the gruff hunter did know how it felt to lose someone you love like that. It wasn't something that he would ever wish on anybody.
“Yeah, Cas, I’m good with that. Honestly, I’m about two minutes away from falling asleep standing here.”
been allowed to help Dean undress before, but those were usually because of injuries and were accompanied by concern and pain. This is different.
a flu, I don’t know what a doctor could do for him. What else would it be?” Sam asked, shutting his laptop and finally looking at Dean.
But Dean and Castiel aren’t angry, and this isn’t exactly a fight, right? This is just a conversation.
Dean was vaguely aware of a group of four guys watching him and Cas from a corner booth, but he shook it off and tried to ignore them. It had been a tough hunt, and he decided he deserved a relaxing drink or two.
He bit back his own sob, trying to get rid of the catch in his throat. Their last few meetings had ended like this. Teary and sad, desperately wondering when they could see each other again. Dean knew they were in this way too deep. Had it just been for the sex, he wouldn't have minded leaving so much, and he wouldn't count down the days 'till his next couple days off.
“Cas, I was the one who lied. I’ve had a lot of practice, I’m pretty good at it. It’s not your fault for not knowing. You shouldn’t have to spend time figuring out if I’m being honest with you.”
“About Dean. I talked to him and...I guess we were right about him and Cas. He's really upset. I don't know how to help him. He says hunting just reminds him, and not hunting is obviously not helping.”
He knew both he and Cas knew the answer to that. They could never tell anyone about this. Ever. Not even their families. Especially not their families. Dean could still remember what had happened to Eddie Geller and Patrick Green when they got caught. Eddie's body was found miles out of town, so beaten and bloody that for a while the sheriff hadn't even been sure it was him at first. His face had been beaten in with a tire iron, both is arms and one of his legs had been shattered. If the beating with the tire iron hadn't killed him, everyone was pretty sure his broken ribs stabbing his lungs had ended it. No one knew who'd done it, but after they found out about him and Patrick, no one had cared. The sheriff hadn't even pretended to try and find out who had been involved. Patrick ran away the day after Eddie was found, and no one had heard from him since. His family didn't seem to care.
Bobby smiled. Underneath his gruff exterior, he really was a big softy, and he was glad Dean had someone. He still didn't completely trusted Cas again yet, but he was going to work on that, for Dean's sake. If Cas was really serious about being sorry and trying to make up for it, it wouldn't be too hard.
Cas stepped out of the pants and soaked underwear at his feet, kicking them off to the side to be washed later. Dean was about to shuck his pants when Castiel’s hands stopped him.
The open trust Dean saw in Cas’s eyes was overwhelming. After everything they’d put each other through, Cas still had complete faith that Dean wouldn’t hurt him. Dean felt a catch in his throat. Instead of trying to reply, he just nodded and reached for the soap again.
Dean realizes he has been standing at the door, one hand on the knob while watching Castiel. He doesn’t want Cas to think he doesn’t want him here, so he moves away from the door. Probably too quickly to look natural, but Cas doesn’t comment on it.
“Okay, well why don’t you go have a shower and I’ll change your sheets while you’re in there. Do you need help getting down the hall?”
He accepted it. Fully. It was Dean's choice and none of the older hunter's business. Besides, there was nothing wrong with it.
Dean has only been awake for 20 minutes, and what little caffeine he’s dumped down his throat hasn’t kicked in yet. He sucks at these kinds of conversations on a good day, and he really doesn’t want to mess this one up. Last night he’d felt like he and Cas were on more solid ground, but today he realizes his lies have shaken their foundation more than he’d thought.
He kept the thrusts of his fingers deep and quick, curling them against Dean’s walls and feeling them clench in tandem with his movements. It had him rutting down into the bed without his notice, but he didn’t care about his own pleasure at that moment. Not with the gorgeous sounds that were spilling from Dean’s lips and the way he shook under Castiel’s ministrations. Not from worry this time, but from uncontainable pleasure.
Sam squirmed uncomfortably, trying in vain to move away. He watched in horror as Dean lifted the blade, and felt it pressed against his throat, putting just enough pressure on it that Sam knew if he moved, skin would be cut.
“Nooo!” Dean bellowed. Tears that he had been holding back in faint hope now wet his cheeks as he doubled over, as if in real, physical pain. After losing Jess and Amelia, Sam knew that he was.
People talked about how much it hurt an omega to be rejected during their heat, but no one ever told Dean it hurts alphas just as much. The pain was like a physical punch to the gut, and suddenly Dean couldn’t breathe.
When Dean had to leave on a hunt, he and Castiel talked on the phone every night, until Sam yelled at Dean for using up all the minutes on their shared plan. But once Dean taught Cas how to text, they kept the calls short and instead spent hours texting until one of them fell asleep.
"Uh...so," The hunter started. "There's a-there's a band playing in town tonight at the bar. I was thinking about going, and I was wondering if, uh, you wanted to come with? Unless you're busy."
Dean adjusted his grip on Cas, holding the angel's arm over his shoulder to support his weight. The hunter lead him down the hall to his own room. On the way, Cas insisted he was fine and could walk on his own, but when Dean let him go, the angel slumped against the nearest wall like a wet rag. Ignoring any further protests, Dean wrapped an arm around his friend again and helped him along.
The room smelled like sweat, and Dean realized Castiel had probably been sleeping on the same gross sheets for the last four days. Normally Dean would wash all the bedding every two weeks, but with Cas being in his room so much this week, he hadn’t had the chance. Poor guy. That couldn’t be making him feel much better.
Dean squeezed Cas tighter, hiding his face in he angel's neck. When he spoke next, it was mumbled into Cas' skin.
He was looking tired, so Dean gestured for him to climb into the unintentional nest he’d made. Once Cas was settled, Dean sat at the foot of the bed.
“I want this to work, Cas,” Dean says, the most sincere thing he’s said all night. “You have to know that.”
Sam paused. He had an idea, but he wasn't sure if it was a good one. Or even a possible one. He'd certainly never heard of it working on that kind of level, but maybe...
Castiel felt tears build behind his eyes at the hunter's outburst, hot and insistent, but he held them back. He had never meant to hurt Dean. Working with that demon just seemed like the only way to stop Raphael from unravelling all the work the brothers had done to stop the Apocalypse. Castiel hadn't thought the leviathans would be strong enough to take control of him like that, or that he would go power crazy. He was ashamed of how he'd acted, and what he'd done to his friends and family. Cas certainly had never wanted to cause any of them pain, especially not Dean.
Or at least that’s what he used to be. When the other angels gave Castiel an ultimatum, return to heaven permanently or fall and become human, Dean had been sure that was goodbye. He’d seen the wistful look on the angel’s face sometimes, when Cas would look up at the stars on a late-night drive back to the bunker. Of course Cas would want to be back home with his remaining family.
Now Castiel looks sad, and Dean knows why. He doesn’t care that Dean dated in the past, he’s more mature than that. What bothers Cas is that Dean had four relationships, or whatever passed for a relationship with him, that ended so painfully he never told Cas about them.
The next day, Dean was the first one up. The hunter woke up with a nasty headache, and a pit in his gut. As slowly as he could, he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the couch, wincing at the ache in his knees and back. The couch was too short for him, and he was sure he'd contorted himself into some interesting positions last night as he tried to sleep. He really should have slept on the bed in the other corner of the room, but he just hadn't been able to make it that far last night. He'd sat down to drink, and just hadn't gotten up again until now.
Dean would love to stay like this for hours. Feeling Castiel’s arms around him, enjoying languid kisses after days of feeling so distant, but he is too tired. He can tell Castiel is mere minutes from falling asleep too.
The ex-angel went to take a few steps forward, when he became aware of the fact the he was holding on to something warm. Looking down his arm, he saw that in his fright, he had grabbed the hunter's hand.
Dean hummed happily into it, letting his hands glide into damp curls. Cas smelled like happy omega, but the underlying smell of Dean’s soap thrilled his alpha.
Emanuel seemed a little surprised by the question, but he quickly recovered. Just as Cas had been, his face remained nearly void of emotion as he spoke.
By now he could tell Dean was a bit more than tipsy. His brother was on his eighth beer in two hours. Cas had only had five, and it took much more for the angel to feel anything. Sam, knowing he would have to drive back, was only on his third. He didn't have the tolerance for booze Dean had worked up, but he could still drive after three drinks.
“Holy fuck,” Dean panted. Cas looked up to see that Dean hadn’t opened his eyes yet. “I can’t feel my legs,” he laughed, the sound a little shaky but good.
“Relax, Dean. I told you, no one ever forced me. Alphas are aware of the strength of their urges and are careful to make sure the omega is willing before getting too close.”
He would have liked to use a can of air freshener to get rid of the smell, but Cas always bitched about the chemicals in those. So instead Dean found some scented candles tucked in the back of the linen closet. He took them and some extra pillows to Cas’s room. The candles were nice, one was lavender and the other smelled like the sea. Dean just hoped that would be enough to cover the smell of sex that Castiel probably wasn’t enjoying. One of the bad things about living underground was the inability to crack a window once in a while.
Sometimes, Dean thought about that time. Before the Apocalypse and angels and the demon blood and his forty years downstairs. Hell, even before Sam had gone to Stanford. He thought about those years. In comparison, they seemed so easy now. The hunter wondered if, given the chance, he would prefer to go back to that innocence. If he would rather have never met Cas. If everything he felt now, the pain, the betrayal, the confusion, the hurt, the abandonment, the... insignificance, if they outweighed the love, the acceptance, the friendship, the forgiveness, the happiness, the safety the angel had given him. Even if it had all been just for a short while. He didn't know.
“Tell me- you tell me that's not true. That's not true.” Dean begged, his mind still trying to cling to the faint hope that the shifter was lying, even though he had no reason to. And that whatever was in the box most certainly wasn't the head of the angel who had changed everything in his life for the better.
“No!” Cas said, his grip on Dean’s hand tightening and the smell of fear growing in the room. “No, Dean. I love you. I have for years. Why would I want to break up with you?”
“Yeah, we can do that,” Dean says. Cas grins and resumes kissing Dean. But now his hands are pushing the flannel off Dean’s shoulders and letting it fall to the floor.
Dean's head snapped up to look at Cas. Realizing he was just sitting there, probably with his mouth hanging open, he tried to say something. Nothing came out.
“Wear scent blockers or not, that’s your choice. Don’t do anything for me you wouldn’t want to do for yourself, okay?”
The Winchester parked the Impala as close as he could get to the main doors, and lead Castiel inside.
He feels like crying. Never in all his years of hunting did he ever see himself settling down. It just wasn’t possible. Any time he’d gotten close, with Cassie and then with Lisa, something happened and he realized it was selfish to drag civilians into this life. Or use them to pull himself out. Hunting had been his life since he was four years old. He couldn’t shut it off.
There’s entirely too much concern in that tone, so Dean tries to play it casual. He turns his head just enough to show he’s paying attention, but not for Castiel to see his face.
“After I fell... I didn’t enjoy the effect my scent had on others. It drew unwanted attention, and I didn’t always feel safe. I thought it would be easier if others just thought I was a beta. I bought the deodorant while I was still homeless, and another omega gave me the soap. I liked them both, so I kept using them.”
Cas stood and positioned himself in front of Dean, grabbing the hunter's shoulders and looking him in the eye, waiting for green eyes to meet his blue ones. When they did, Castiel spoke.
He’s pulling the burners and elements off the stove and putting them in the sink when Sam gets up. He stumbles into the kitchen in only his boxers and an open robe, which he quickly ties shut when he sees Dean.
But, despite everything the angel had done to him and his family, Dean couldn't bring himself to hate Cas. He had tried. Man had he tried. He'd tried to think of all the reasons why he should be relieved Cas had walked into that lake, why he should hate the feathery bastard for betraying him, for taking down Sam's wall, for nearly killing them when he'd first gotten his power. He knew it would be far easier to deal with the loss if he hated Castiel, but he just couldn't. Despite everything, a small part of him had always hoped that somehow, they would have been able to get past all this and still be together.
Dean nodded, still drunk on Cas’s smell. It took serious effort to pull away, but knowing he was doing it to help Cas made it slightly easier.
Dean walked up to the bar and sat down on a stool near Beth. She passed him the shot glass, filled to the brim with a golden liquid. Dean smelled it, but couldn't place what was in it.
Dean pulled him out of his thoughts by saying they should head to a bar to celebrate. Cas agreed, after saying he needed a shower first.
“Look, I know what you two were to each other, Dean told me. He also told me you loved him. I need to know, did you?”
A continuation of the first chapter, starting immediately where the last chapter left off. In this chapter, you will get to see Dean's reaction to what the shifter did
Though he had never said so, Castiel was pretty sure Dean had gotten in the habit of wearing so many layers when he was young to hide things he didn’t like about his body. And even though surgery and hormones had alleviated a lot of that discomfort, Dean’s wardrobe choices had changed little. He still dressed in layers of flannel, with dark shirts underneath. Not that Castiel would complain. They looked good on him.
Before he had known Cas was an omega, Dean had never worried about his smell having any effect on him. Now, as Cas buried his face in Dean’s neck, the alpha hoped Castiel found comfort in his scent.
Laying back down on the couch upstairs, he finally gave in to the urge to blackout, sinking into its warm oblivion.
Bobby turned to face Sam. He hadn't been there himself, but he'd heard about the last faith healer the younger brother had found. Reaper on a leash, and in the hands of a conservative, backwards preacher's wife. Not exactly a great solution to anything. Even if it had worked for Dean, if it had saved him once, some other poor bastard had died for it. The guy hadn't 'cured' anything. He'd transferred the Winchester's heart attack to someone else.
The drive back had been tense, to say the least. Neither Dean nor Sam had spoken to each other, and the radio had quit working, so the silence was even more unbearable.
Dean had helped an omega with a heat once or twice, and it was pretty common for them to feel like that between sex. They must have caught Cas post-jerk-off.
Matthew hesitated, it was clear he would really rather be talking to Bobby, but he figured he could tell Sam.
Dean shrugged and downed the liquor in one swallow. The bitter sweetness burned it's way down his throat. It wasn't unpleasant as far as hard drinks go. It almost had a liqueur taste.
The younger hunter felt a twinge of sympathy for the stranger. Hunting was a dangerous job, anything could happen. Matthew kept talking.
Sam hurried up the stairs and into the room when he heard the call, not sure what to expect. The look of anger on his big brother's face directed at him was certainly a surprise.
Emanuel seemed to get into what could only be described as a work mode. The last of his nervousness and fear seemed to vanish, and he concentrated.
As much as Cas would love to rush in, he knew too much excitement would just make Dean worry Castiel would be inevitably let down. Better to start slow and let Dean see how much he affected Cas.
Sam wanted desperately to help as he watched Dean beat Cas around the room, the angel telling him all the while to fight the mark, to take back control.
After 12 years, Dean had assumed he knew Castiel well enough that there weren’t any major surprises left to find out. Especially after going through figurative and literal Hell together several times. He could tell you the guy’s favourite food was a simple cheeseburger, that he put up with Dean’s music but would rather listen to something instrumental and calm, and that when he was pissed Castiel’s eyes were still an electric blue even without his grace.
“I didn't remember anything before that. But she took me in and cared for me. Soon after, we found that I had...abilities.”
/“I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending. I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end.”/
The bottle Cas handed over was Dean’s. Whether it was because he wanted to smell like his mate during his heat, or because he was off the scent blockers for now, Dean didn’t know. He didn’t ask, at least for now. Cas could figure out what he wanted.
Dean didn’t bother trying to play dumb. He’d been getting more distracted for weeks, especially on hunts. If it got much worse, he’d be a liability soon. He was already worrying Sam with how often anxiety drifted into his scent.
“I... Yeah. It’s not like I’ve never done this before. And it’s you, so... it makes sense that we do this, right?”
“Uh....yeah. He. I'm not...it's just...I'm not gay, but I don't know, he's different. I've never even looked at a guy that way before or after him.”
Castiel’s expression softens further, and he holds his arms out, beckoning Dean into a hug. After the last few days, Dean can’t help but collapse into him. His arms wrap around Castiel’s middle tightly, and he buries his face in the former angel’s shoulder. It takes him a moment to realize he’s shaking, and when he does, he isn’t sure if it’s from relief, or residual fear.
“Yeah, uh...the, uh...the guy my brother was...” Sam was going to say 'in love with', but Dean had never told Cas he loved him, and Sam figured his brother should be the one to tell the angel first, if Cas ever got his memories back. “My brother's boyfriend...” he finally said, though the words sounded strange to say out loud. “...betrayed him and lied to him, then something bad happened to him and...After that, Dean kind of went into a downward spiral. The last time I saw him was yesterday, he had barely eaten or slept in days, and was living off bourbon. The only one who can get him to eat anything is Bobby, he's a friend of ours who is over there now. Man, Cas sure did a number on him."  Sam mumbled the last bit to himself, but Castiel still heard it anyway.
“Yes,” Castiel says. “You said you were worried I would reject you if we were no longer having sex.”
Dean slowly looked up from where he stood slumped against the wall. Sam was pretty sure if Dean hadn't had chains wrapped around him, holding him against the pillar, his brother would have fallen to the floor. Something about him was noticeably different right from the jump. Sam couldn't pinpoint what exactly, except that Dean's movement seemed... Rough, jerky. His body was still shaking, but for a different reason now. Not out of fatigue or an internal struggle, no, this was from raw energy. The mark on his arm was glowing now, the pulses of red travelling visibly through his veins and crawling up his arm and down his hand to the blade. A slow, totally wrong smile tugged at the corners of Dean's mouth, making him look maniacal. Sam didn't know what the first blade was doing to him, but he knew that /thing/ smiling at Magnus was /not/ his brother, not really.
Now Sam was confused. How could Cas not remember him, after everything they had been through? What was going on?
“I know,” Dean said. “I tried to be quick. Sam went to the store to get supplies so I could stay with you.”
,” Castiel said, and for a moment his voice took on all the strength he’d possessed as an angel. But behind it, Dean heard the fear.
There were probably a lot of other, more important questions to ask, but the first one Dean’s brain spat out was, “Why?”
“You've made quite a life for yourself, Dean. Despite everything.” the monster droned. The hunter barely hmm'd in acknowledgement. Just enough so that the damned thing wouldn't repeat it's self, as it seemed so found of doing.
Dean held back the tears that threatened to fall, swallowing hard around the lump in his throat. Ever since the hunting accident, they had all known from day one that Cas was paralysed and wasn't going to get better. He'd lived longer than Dr. Russell had guessed he would, but now his declining health was speeding up. It was only a matter of time until-
Cas wished he’d thought this through more before bringing it up. If he had more concrete desires beyond
He grabbed the heat pack from the microwave and Cas’s tea, hurrying out of the room before he bit Sam’s head off again.
The hunter paused at the sound of a second, new voice. As Dean whipped around, he moved out of the way just enough for Sam to see Castiel standing in the entrance. His brother growled, and left Sam for the time being, turning to fully face Cas.
Dean made the first move. He covered the distance between him and the angel in a few quick, long strides, his face unreadable. Cas nearly took a step back, not sure what Dean was about to do. Honestly, he'd expected the hunter to take a swing at him. He would deserve it too. Dean reached him quickly, and without hesitation, wrapped his arms tightly around the angel, pulling him into a tight hug. Castiel didn't hesitate to return the embrace just as strongly. Relief flooded though him, making his knees week and his head light and a little fuzzy. He had been just as prepared for Dean to come back angry and yelling. The two wouldn't let go of each other, they both just stood there, shaking in each others' arms, and though Dean couldn't see them, he know Castiel's wings wrapped around him too.
“Dean, I want... can I...?” Cas trails one hand down until it rests on Dean’s ass. They don’t do that as often, because Cas really enjoys bottoming, and Dean really enjoys that Cas comes fast when he’s getting fucked. When Castiel fucks Dean, he draws it out, tries to turn it into 40 minutes of making love. That’s not something Dean can handle tonight.
He doesn’t even know what he’d say.  “Uh, hope you weren’t planning on cooking breakfast,” he says, gesturing to the partially dismantled stove.
The smell of slick hit him hard once that last barrier of cloth was gone. The smell was incredible, and Dean definitely wanted to get a better whiff of it, but he still didn’t feel so much as a twitch from his dick. Somehow, his body knew that wasn’t what this was about.
“I'm in the same line of business as Bobby, if that's what you mean. Do you need backup or something?”
At some point, I want to add another fic to this verse exploring how Deana and Cas deal with Dean's rut, since they clearly won't be spending it in a typical matter for an alpha/omega couple. I don't know when that will be up, but probably not any time soon. For now, I hope you enjoy this one
“All you need to know that this might not be common, but it’s totally healthy. Nothing is wrong with your alpha friend, or his omega,” Charlie reassured.
That seemed to relax Castiel somewhat, but he was still looking at Dean curiously, waiting for the truth.
Sam knew that if it turned out that Dean and Cas had been a couple, Bobby wouldn't see Dean any differently, right now he was just defending the hunter since he wasn't here to do it himself.
“Okay...” Sam said like he was about to explain something very simple to a very small child. “But I know Cas isn’t on fertility suppressants, so if you two don’t want pups, then-”
Dean stirred a large scoop of honey into Castiel’s tea while he waited for Sam to figure out what he wanted to say. It didn’t take long.
Without really talking, they all finished their beers, then decided it was time to leave. People gave them a wide birth as they left the bar, but the brothers and the angel didn't really care.
Angels didn’t have a secondary gender like alpha or omega. Hell, Castiel didn’t even have a primary gender. He could have just as easily taken a female vessel from the beginning, and Dean would have called Cas “she” for the last twelve years.
“You haven’t lost me,” Castiel says quickly. “You won’t. I told you last night that I’m not going anywhere unless you want me to. That hasn’t changed.”
Sam's face was turning a dangerous shade of red. Gary quickly realized that had been the wrong thing to ask. When Sam spoke next, he practically spat his words.
“Well, obviously I can’t decide someone else’s sexuality or anything, but it sounds to me like that omega is asexual.”
Those warm hands pull his hips back until they are flush against Castiel’s groin. He isn’t hard yet, but it never takes long. One hand stays in place, while the other explores under Dean’s shirt. Fingers trail lightly across his stomach, and Cas keeps sucking on his neck. Dean closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
“You can take my shirt off,” Cas said, moving back in for another kiss before Dean could ask if he was sure.
Dean had chosen this place so he could see Beth again and let her know everything had worked out, he figured she deserved to know that she had helped. Plus, she had seemed genuinely interested and hopeful for him.
With a new bed in place, Dean grabbed clean sheets from the linen closet at the end of the hall. Tomorrow he would go into town and pick up a waterproof mattress protector for Cas. But for now, he covered the bed with a fitted sheet, laid down some towels, and then put a second fitted sheet over that. Hopefully, it would be enough to save the mattress for tonight.
“It’s how alphas stay anchored to an omega during mating. When the alpha orgasms, the base of their penis swells into a knot, keeping them locked inside the omega to increase the chance of a successful breeding.”
Dean had to really resist the urge to pull over and kick Sam out of the car. The cabin was still a good fifty miles or so away, it would be interesting to see how fast his brother could make it back.
Sam sat in his idling truck, fingers thrumming on the wheel, anxiously waiting for Emanuel to come out of the house. The last time Sam had seen his brother, Dean had been sleeping off his latest hangover, and from what Bobby had told him last night, Dean had spent the better part of the day curled over a bucket. He hoped that today Bobby might be able to get some water in his brother's system, and maybe some proper food too. They had to be running low on whiskey and beer by now, and there was no way the older hunter would supply Dean with more, or let him go into town himself. 	Sam heard his phone ring and checked the caller ID. Bobby. The Winchester was about to answer, when he saw the healer walking towards the truck. He couldn't tell Bobby what was going on with Cas/Emanuel in the passenger seat, so he decided to stop in a town for gas on the way back and give Bobby a heads up then.
The Harvelles were family friends, apparently Mr. Harvelle used to work with John, so when Dean needed a job, they happily gave him one. Dean suspected they payed him more than the work was worth, still, he wasn't gonna complain.
The whole night he was plagued by dreams of his angel walking into that river, and never coming back out. It was torture, but his body needed sleep too much to let him wake up, and he was forced to watch the image replay over and over for what felt like hours.
Cas nodded against Dean, and a fresh burst of tears streamed down his cheeks as he buried his face in the blond's shoulder, inhaling a scent he hadn't known he'd missed. Neither of them wanted to let go, but they knew that had to at some point. Slowly, they pulled apart. Dean lifted a trembling hand up and cupped Castiel's face, finally allowing himself to do so. His fingers traced Cas' jaw gently, feeling the permanent five o'clock shadow there. The angel leaned into it and closed his eyes, a small smile graced his lips. Dean smiled through the tears of joy running down his face. Castiel opened his eyes and slowly reached a hand up to gently wipe Dean's tears away with his thumb, only to find that his touch triggered more. They both lowered their hands, bringing them back to their sides. Dean took in a few deep breathes to try and calm himself down and stop the tears, when he saw that Cas was crying too.
In what he thought was either a moment of clarity, or a moment of insanity, the hunter paused. Dean. The angel had called him Dean. No, not just any random angel. He recognized him, Dean was sure of it. Like seeing a familiar face on the street, one that you can't quite place, but know you've seen before. The angel was still talking, still begging.
Dean's mind was racing, trying to figure out if he was dealing with monsters, and if so, what kind, or just people.
It took a couple of weeks for his body to settle down and work itself into a routine. He still slept late most mornings, but Dean had a feeling that was just the type of guy Cas was now. Not a morning person. He barely spoke without two cups of coffee in him. Except for that one time Dean bought him a coffee with a shot of espresso in it, and Cas hadn’t been able to stop fidgeting for 5 hours. Never again, he and Dean agreed.
“What are you sorry for?” Dean asked, gently rubbing Cas’s hand, trying to be the comforting alpha even when he felt lost. He wasn’t sure what Cas needed from him right now.
“I know we still have much to talk about,” Castiel says. “I have a lot of questions, and I’m still upset that you kept this from me.”
Cas must have heard him or caught his smell outside the door. Dean pushed his confusion and worry to the side for now. His need to take care of his omega was stronger. He opened the door and the rush of smell hit him hard, but all he felt was concern. Castiel didn’t smell
Sam tossed the dirty rag into the trunk before he climbed into the car. Dean joined him soon, after he set the barn on fire. They had to get rid of the evidence, and with the vamps and the bodies of all the victims, burning everything was the easiest way to cover all this up. No need to cause suspicion and confusion in the local police station when the morgue attendant noticed fangs.
Matthew didn't want to start talking about monsters to someone who didn't know they were out there, hunters had to tread carefully. Sam realized he still hadn't answered.
Dean grabbed his keys to the POS car and headed towards the door. He turned around when he realized that Sam wasn't following him. The younger hunter was still sitting at the table, glaring at the floor, thinking over their argument.
The thought of it made him shift even closer to Dean, if that was even possible. As if thinking the same thing, Dean hugged the brunet with his one arm, almost protectively. He couldn't lose Cas like that. He would rather never be able to hold him and touch him and kiss him and see him again, but know that he was alive and well somewhere, than have to read about his death in the paper. He blinked back the tears he could feel stinging the corners of his eyes, but he knew Cas could probably feel how shaky his breathing had gotten.
Dean dipped his head down until he could nuzzle at Cas’s neck, running his nose and lips over the spot that his alpha wanted to bite. He felt Cas shudder against him, breathing suddenly ragged, but his smell was all happy omega, so Dean kept going. He kissed and nibbled at that spot a little more firmly. Not anywhere near enough to leave a mark, but enough to tease Cas’s mating instincts.
Dean realized he’d just been standing in the door, saying nothing, staring off into space vaguely near Castiel. He came to the side of the bed where he set down the plate of sandwiches and settled himself on the edge of the mattress.
Dean was also incredibly relieved that Castiel had made that choice himself rather than forcing Dean to say something. Castiel had also been the one to suggest that Dean and Sam train him. But Sam, the conniving bitch, had wiggled out of that almost entirely. He took Cas on his runs most days, but anything that required any kind of closeness, like sparring and shooting, Sam left entirely to Dean. Not officially, of course. Somehow, he was just never around when Castiel wanted to train.
Bobby heard the annoyance in Dean's voice, as well as the added weight he gave to the words when he said he could take care of himself. He almost sounded... defensive. He decided it was time he spoke to the oldest Winchester himself.
“The next time was after the Leviathans got out. When you walked into the water and disappeared...” Dean shakes his head. He lived that heartbreak already, he doesn’t enjoy thinking about it. “I was back on all my bad habits. Drinking, getting into fights, and... I just wanted to feel close to someone, you know? Me and Sam and Bobby were holding up in Rufus’s cabin, and when I went on supply runs, I met Aaron. He worked at the grocery store. We started going out for beers here and there, and one night while we were leaving the bar, he kissed me. I was kinda drunk and really alone, so I went along with it.”
Castiel’s heart ached for Dean. He didn’t talk about his past lovers often, if ever, and he talked about his transition even less. In fact, the only time he’d ever brought it up himself was on their second date.
It was then that the wannabe bikers broke out of their shock and rushed to help. Two of them went to help the leader, while one tackled a swaying Castiel to the ground.
“I guess that's what you get for barely sleeping and living off of booze for...six days? God, has it only been that long?” Dean thought to himself.
Dean looked down and away from Cas, ashamed of the way he'd acted. He really didn't want to talk about those months he had thought his angel was dead, but he knew he had to tell him the truth.
The hunter wasn't fooling himself, he knew that he was being pathetic, but he just couldn't find it in himself to stop it and move on. Cas had done some serious damage to him. He didn't know what could possibly fix it.
colouring his voice. His eyes locked on Dean’s, watching him nervously. Dean held up his hands, leaning away from the bed.
They spent most nights curled up on Dean’s bed watching a movie or two. They took turns on that too. Dean showed Cas Indiana Jones, Star Wars, several westerns, and Jurassic Park. Castiel enjoyed it enough that he picked the next one in the series when it was his turn. Though he mentioned several times that dinosaurs did not sound or look the same in actual life as they did in the movie. That turned into a three-hour series of questions from Dean about the prehistoric animals.
Dean doesn’t get the chance, though. Even if he could have worked up the nerve then, Castiel takes his coffee and cereal to the library. It’s not like having breakfast together is a rule, but it still hurts when Castiel goes to eat elsewhere.
He got his answer when the hunter moved the rest of the way towards him until he was sitting on the bed at the angel's side. Dean wrapped his hand around the back of Cas' neck to help gently guide him closer. It only took Cas a second to realize what was happening, and he quickly obliged the hunter, leaning in eagerly to meet him in a slow kiss.
“Is... kissing alright?” Cas asks. Dean can hear the hope in his voice, but he can also tell Cas is trying to sound neutral. He doesn’t want his desires to impact Dean’s choices. He is one of the most selfless people Dean knows, and that is saying a lot.
Sam steeled his nerves. Even after growing up around death and decay, sometimes something seriously gross could still trigger his gag reflex. Slowly, the Winchester opened the box the rest of the way. What he saw inside made him scream and jump back against the Impala. His shoulder hit the bumper hard, but he was numb to any pain at this point, his mind reeling.
Now that he was closer, Dean could see that Castiel didn’t look sleepy at all. His eyes were wide open, staring straight ahead at the wall. His hands curled and uncurled tightly around the pillow in his grasp, and beneath the covers his legs shifted restlessly.
Man, he needed Charlie to come to visit soon. He’d take a road trip with Sam and Cas to see her, but she moved around more than they did. And unlike them, she didn’t have a home base.
Dean stomped his foot with the base and joined in for the chorus. His voice wasn't heard over the noise.
Cas propped himself up against the headboard and reached for the food. Dean smiled and handed it to him, watching as Cas practically drooled over it.
Fierce, protective anger flashes over Cas’s face, but he says nothing. Dean appreciates the restraint that he doesn’t think he would have in Castiel’s situation. But the only way he can get through telling this is if Cas doesn’t make this about his reactions.
“I don’t want to go through that again, Dean. I don’t want to lose you to secrets or lies. We’re supposed to be honest with each other. We’re supposed to be a team. But that only works if we want it to.”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean asked, turning his head to face Cas. “I feel like I should buy you a freaking
He came in to see Cas untying the woman in the living room. He had never seen the angel that scared or genuinely afraid for someone else, other than maybe Dean.
Dean had made some selfish choices in his life, but he would never ask Castiel to give up his home and his grace just because Dean didn’t want to lose his best friend. He’d had nothing but time and chances to tell Cas how he felt about him, and maybe try for something more, but he’d feared losing what they had. He’d convinced himself having Cas around was good enough. That he could settle for loving the angel from afar. But faced with the reality of losing Castiel forever, Dean had felt hollow and cold inside.
“Please look at me?” Cas asks, so quietly Dean almost doesn’t hear it. Or maybe Cas is speaking normally and it just sounds quiet by the time it passes through the fog in his mind.
“... one of those ways is... how we reproduce. Angels have no gender, but there are other traits that separate us. The main one is whether an angel is an alpha or an omega.”
When the next song started up, Dean didn't recognize it. It wasn't a classic rock song like what they had opened with, but he had to give the band credit for their diversity.
The angel ran his finger tips over the materiel. It was dirty and stained black and red from the last time he's ever worn it, when he'd walked into that lake. Dean wouldn't wash it because he'd wanted it left the way his angel had left it.
Getting up, he made his way down the hall towards Cas' room. It was across the hall from his own, and he could see the ex-angel's door was open. Glancing in, he saw Castiel sitting on his bed, reading a book from their library. Ever since he'd lost his grace, he'd pretty much made it his job to read every book in the Men of Letters' library. He was frowning in concentration as he studied the pages of his most recent text. Since Cas had been an angel there wasn't a single language, monster, sigil or spell he didn't know, however, he enjoyed going through the books and making corrections for future use. He hadn't noticed Dean standing in the doorway yet, to busy writing something in the foot notes of his book about extinct creatures. Clearing his throat, the hunter knocked on the door jam.
Sam sighed, forcing himself to calm down slightly. He took a few deep breathes to control himself, then finished wiping down the inside of the truck so he and Cas could leave. He decided to call Bobby quickly and let him know that Castiel had his memory back.
“Hello? Who's this? I think I might have the wrong number.” said a man's voice on the other end of the phone. He had a slight drawl when he spoke. Not exactly southern, more small town.
“Hey, no one is gonna make you do something you don’t want, okay? If you say no alpha, then that’s it.”
Sam replied with a little defensiveness in his voice. He raised his head a little and stood up straighter.
When Cas paused to look up at him, he saw that Dean’s pupils were blown, and his lips were red from him biting them, trying to hold his sounds in.
“He won't talk to me Bobby. Something is really bugging him, he just gets quiet and annoyed then ignores me or tries to leave whenever I try to bring it up. You had to have noticed he's been different since the day Cas died.”
“Just...make sure you talk to him tomorrow. You can stay here tonight.” he said before stalking off.
Cas set his half-eaten sandwich back on the plate. He was tense, and he could hardly meet Dean’s eyes as he spoke. Dean thought Cas looked embarrassed.
Sam shoved the demon back hard and pulled the knife from his belt, preparing himself to fight. The demon's smile vanished when he saw the blade. He lunged for Sam again, but the hunter blocked him easily and stabbed the knife into the black eyed man's stomach. Orange lights flickered from his open mouth and wide eyes, before Sam pulled the knife out and shoved the body away. It rolled down the stairs to the side walk, stopping at a man's feet. Sam panicked a little. He thought fast.
Deciding he wasn't going to get the fight he wanted, he raised the blade above his head, ready to strike.
Dean sighs, but he can still feel his heart thundering in his chest and a pressing need to find Castiel humming under his skin. He won’t fully relax until he sees him. Still, he tries to move calmly as he dresses for the day. Running through the bunker in his boxers isn’t a good look.
He remembered how betrayed he'd felt when he'd found out that Castiel was in cahoots with the king of Hell, and not only that, was actually working against them and trying to open Purgatory.
A fresh set of tears formed behind Dean's eyes. He wanted to refuse, to tell Cas 'no way', but he couldn't. If it was Cas' last wish that Dean help him with this, than how could he say no?
The last hit had knocked Cas to his knees. His face was bloody and cut in a few places, his jaw was puffy, and his left eye was swollen shut.
“Maybe in a nicer way, but yeah. Just check in with him. Maybe he thinks you should make the first move because you’re an alpha, and you have more experience.”
Dean finally looks up at Castiel and sees tears shining in his eyes. Cas reaches gently cups Dean’s face, holding his gaze steadily.
Castiel doesn’t get into the bed right away. Instead, he sits on the edge and watches Dean close the door behind them. It doesn’t feel like he’s looking at Dean any differently. There’s nothing cold or withdrawn about his gaze. It’s still so full of the love and admiration that took Dean months to get used to seeing there. Even so, he worries.
“I left after that, obviously. And I didn’t try again until Lisa. You know what happened there. She was the longest relationship I’d ever had, and it went to shit slowly and then all at once.”
There was no defensiveness in Castiel's voice when he spoke next. He sounded calm, simply stating a true fact.
Well, I think that about wraps it up. Thank you so much to everyone who read my fic, I've never gotten such a strong response so quickly to any of my stories. PLEASE comment so I can know if I wrecked you day of if I should try and make it sadder to be more successful in my day wrecking goals.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean said. “But it’s nice and warm in here, I didn’t want you to get cold walking down the hall in a wet towel.”
Part of the reason I left was that she was already moving on. She’d met a guy at work and started dropping hints I should move my stuff to the spare room.”
Gary slowly dropped his hand from his bleeding nose and stood to leave, but Sam wouldn't move out of his way. He wasn't getting off that easy.
“He just told you.” the shifter joined in, his eerily calm tone doing nothing to help Dean's distress.
“I’m not gonna break,” he said. Cas could only nod and allow himself to settle fully on top of Dean.
Castiel sounds somewhere between panic and anger, and Dean doesn’t know how to make this better. He’s tried to imagine how he would feel if the situation were reversed, and those imaginings were part of the reason he said nothing all this time.
Dean was just arranging the pillows in a sort of upside-down U when Castiel came back, wearing sweats and a shirt this time. His hair was still damp and clung to his forehead as he looked around the room.
He doesn’t know what he’s asking for. He hates how distant they are, and he wants to go back to how things were before.
Sam hesitated. What had the angel been to his brother? A boyfriend? A lover? Any word that came to mind didn't seem right.
Castiel had been trying to defeat his older brother because Rafael wanted to start the Apocalypses again, and everyone Dean and Sam had lost and everything they had sacrificed would have been for nothing. The angel of Thursday hadn't gone to Dean for help, because the hunter had already give so much, how could Castiel ask him to give more? Dean realized that through everything, his angel had still just been trying to help him.
Dean was struggling hard against his bonds now, looking like a wild animal caged. Sam was terrified to see that the chains were actually warping like they might break.
Dean didn't know what to say. He thanked every god above that he didn't make some ridiculous face, or say something dumb. Cas waited for an answer.
“When I walked out of that river, I didn't remember a thing. Who I was, what I had done, nothing. Not even you.”
Castiel grins and gets into the bed properly. Dean takes a moment just to watch, thrilled to see Cas back where he belongs. It wasn’t only the bed that felt empty without him here. It was the room, it was Dean’s entire life. None of it made sense without the dorky former angel here with him.
He shakes his head and tosses them into the basket along with everything else. Last night was awful, but he’s not pathetic enough yet to leave dirty pants lying around because they remind him of Cas.
“No, I mean-” Sam said, still sounding baffled. “Whenever you would hook up after a hunt, you stank. I couldn’t even be in the car with you until you showered.”
Castiel was back to avoiding his gaze. Instead, his eyes were fixed on where their hands were still joined. Neither had let go, and neither was willing to let go. Dean knows he has to say something, and he just hopes whatever he comes up with is the right thing.
“Then you need to have a complicated talk with Cas. Look, Dean,” Sam says as he butters his unholy breakfast bagel. “This is what relationships are. A lot of hard, uncomfortable conversations. You’re always gonna hate them, but you have them so you can get to the good moments. Letting shit fester never ends well.”
His sobs were becoming harder as he wiped his face. Cas' fingers brushed his hand lightly. Dean could barely feel it, but he squeezed in return.
The angel looked up from methodically wiping down the door. He could see Sam was standing now, leaning on the roof of the truck. There was anger in the hunter's eyes, and with good reason. Cas stood up as well and turned his full attention to Sam.
Cas didn't have as many ties to his family. Other than his brother, Gabriel, Cas really didn't like his siblings or his parents. His dad was almost never around, Cas never knew his mom, and had mostly been raised by Michael and Gabriel. Dean doubted Cas wouldn't have much of a problem up and leaving.
Sam sighed in relief, knowing that at least for now Dean was mostly his normal self. His brother stayed where he was on the floor, holding Cas upright until the cuts on his face started closing and the swelling began to go down as the angel healed his vessel.
Dean cast a quick glance at Cas, who was still swaying back and fourth, staring at the ground. The hunter quickly decided the angel wouldn't be much help if this turned into a fight. Which it looked like it was going to. He looked directly at the leader.
Dean could tell Sam was becoming a little exasperated with Dean’s paranoia. In a brotherly, good-natured, ‘you’re-an-idiot’ sort of way. He was maybe a couple of minutes away from rolling his eyes and calling Castiel himself.
His own heart was racing now, and he struggled against the chains wrapped around him, furious at being contained. He pushed harder when he felt a slight give, it fueled him to keep trying.
Now, Cas applied his limited experiences to relaxing Dean. He started by running his hands up and down Dean’s back, sides, and arms, encouraging blood flow to help the muscles relax more. Once Dean’s skin felt warm, Cas began his dedicated work. Almost meticulously, he encouraged Dean’s muscles to relax under his touch, unwinding knots that had been there for years. He watched with satisfaction as the tension drained out of Dean slowly, leaving him half-asleep on the bed and letting out pleased
It’s not that he hadn’t tried, but Dean always brushed him off and Castiel didn’t want him to feel pressured. So, he made sure the offer was always there, but Dean never took him up on it. The most Cas ever got to touch him was when Dean was focused on him, and even then the touches were reserved to places that were “safe”.
The singer's voice sounded sorrowful and yet hopeful, further conveying the message of his song. Dean decided it wasn't bad, as far as that slower stuff went at least. Anyway, they more than made up for it when they started playing "Travelling Riverside Blues". It was one of the hunter's favourites, and he had to sing along and play some air guitar on his leg, making Cas choke on his beer as he laughed.
They sat in the POS car, since the rain had begun to come down harder. Sam squeezed into the passenger side and closed the door while Bobby settled himself into the driver's seat as comfortably as he could. How the hell did Dean drive this thing? The boy was a good six feet tall, how did he fit in here well enough to drive?
On the day Cas had picked to fall, it had surprised Dean to learn the process was boring. Two angels he didn’t think he’d ever met, whose names he wasn’t able to pronounce, had shown up to help. Apparently, it was more of a ritual than he’d thought, and far nicer than when Metatron had cut out Castiel’s grace. They had needed some of Castiel’s blood, but they had used grace to acquire it. About a vial’s worth appeared in the old stone bowl they’d brought, mixing with other substances Dean didn’t recognize.
He heard the men talking, and their voices were irritating and grating, making him push harder against the chains. He needed to stop it.
Apparently Dean had heard him this time. He tore himself away from Cas and started to get out of the booth, his fists clenched and all signs of booze gone. He was royally pissed, and he wasn't the only one. Sam's blood boiled. Before Dean could figure out who had said it, Sam stood and stormed over to where the guy was sitting. Before he could say anything else or even stand up, Sam hammer punched him, breaking his nose with clear intent.
That had been before Sam lost his soul, or the war in Heaven, probably when they were the happiest together.
Dean lifts Castiel’s hand to press his lips to his knuckles. It was something he’d done as a joke months ago, but when it got a big smile out of the former angel, Dean made a point of doing it again. Now, he rarely did it consciously, but it could always brighten Castiel’s day.
Dean grips the counter tightly, hoping the tremor in his hands isn’t obvious. No, no, no, none of this is right! He should have had more time. They had sex yesterday, Dean thought he would be safe for at least a day, three if he was lucky. He can’t do this, he can’t be what Cas wants right now.
Castiel set his empty pistol down on the counter and pulled off his ear protectors. That something as simple as sound could now damage his body was something he’d known before but had a hard time accepting now. Going from unbreakable to fragile was a tough change, and his many stubbed toes and burnt fingers reminded him of it often.
Sam waited until the older hunter was gone, the deep rumble of his truck clearly heard pulling down the dirt road that acted as a type of driveway, before he walked over to the TV and turned it off.
Dean nodded and followed Cas to the foot of their bed. When they sat, Cas took Dean’s hands in his own, and Dean let his knee bump against Cas’s. Neither had undressed yet, but there was still a warmth that seeped through two layers of denim. Castiel focused on that, clearing his mind and putting his attention on the way Dean looked at him.
Dean drifted in and out of consciousness, only partially aware of what was going on around him. He'd woken up somewhat when he'd heard a phone ringing, the next thing he knew, it was dark out and Bobby was waking him up, a bag of greasy, stick to your stomach food in his hand.
“Cas.” Bobby acknowledged, his toned and measured and firm. There was no way in Hell he was trusting the angel yet.
“Well, clearly something isn’t right,” Cas pushes, taking Dean’s hand in his own and bringing it to his lips. They brush over Dean’s knuckles, and Dean practically melts at the tender gesture. “Please tell me. Whatever it is, we can fix it.”
Castiel has never really understood the appeal of dirty talk. It just seemed like a redundant and awkward practice to him. That is, until Dean started doing it. Now, it didn’t even have to be anything explicit, just an implication was enough.
Sam nodded. It made sense. Emanuel, Cas, whoever he was, was still an angel, of course he could heal people. The fact that he didn't know who he really was, or what he had done... That was a more difficult topic to broach just yet. Maybe Cas would remember when he saw Dean? A nagging voice in the back of the hunter's mind traitorously whispered; “What if he doesn't?” Sam tried not to think of that possibility. How would this affect Dean if he found out Cas was alive, but didn't remember anything? Would he get worse?
“Dean.” Sam supplied, watching the angel out of the corner of his eye for a possible reaction. There was none.
He hesitated again when he reached the door, half expecting to open it and see an empty room. For a moment he though about leaving, but it was a fleeting notion, he wanted so badly to see Castiel again. Dean slowly opened the door and peered inside.
Bobby was getting anxious waiting for Sam to call and let him know what was happening. Dean was not improving. It was like he'd had a lid on his emotions, and now that it was open, it couldn't be shut. Dean was just sinking deeper and deeper, withdrawing more and more. That was probably what concerned Bobby the most. When the eldest of the Winchester boys had problems before, he'd become violent, short tempered and sarcastic. He went out and started fights to work off some steam, things like that. He didn't sit around feeling sorry for himself.
Dean decided to call it a night and try to figure out how to get the angel and himself back to the cabin. He didn't trust Cas to mojo them there, and the last thing he wanted was for them to end up in Egypt or something. Yeah, he didn't want to wake up tomorrow on the sphinx. He thanked Beth once more when he paid for the drinks. He had to use of of his fake credit cards this time, because yeah, Cas had had a lot. Dean then hauled a stumbling Castiel out to call either Sam or Bobby for a ride.
“Just give me a minute and then I’ll return the favour,” Dean said, blinking slowly up at the ceiling like he wasn’t really seeing it yet.
"Not a lot." He replied, moving towards the counter and slowly pulling things out of the bags while Dean put them away.
Bobby's face kept it's hard set. He was pissed, and had every right to be. Dean, who was like a son to the older hunter, was a mess, and all because of this angel.
“Cas, how are you here? How are you alive? What happened?” Dean sounded calm, he was simply in awe that his angel was here, in front of him again.
Dean was silent for a long moment, but Cas could see it wasn’t because he had no answer, but because he was working up the courage to give it. Cas didn’t rush him, merely held his hand and waited for Dean to find the words. Finally, he spoke.
“I understand why you did it,” Sam said easily, never looking up from organizing the trunk. “Why you killed Amy. You were right, if it had been any other monster, I would have ganked her too.”
He wasn’t entirely sure how it worked, but he’d heard several omegas say that the cold made their heat cramps worse. Especially if their feet got cold. That’s why he’d also brought Cas a pair of wool socks normally reserved for winter hunts, and the thickest pair of sweats Cas had.
Sam sighed. He was really starting to worry about Dean now. His brother hadn't eaten and had barely slept since the day Bobby had spoken to him. He was getting worse. It was rare that he came down from his room, and Sam was pretty sure the only thing he had been drinking these last few days was whiskey. It wasn't so much that Dean refused to eat, as it was he forgot, and it wasn't like he couldn't sleep, he was just too busy drinking. They needed to find someone or something to help him. Fast.
Sam's eyes shifted out the driver side window, he didn't want to remember hearing Dean cry, or seeing his brother shut himself off from the world like he had.
Now it was Dean’s turn to be surprised. Had it really been two months already? Well, seven weeks at least. He hadn’t realized so much time had passed.
Sam snorts but grabs the carton and the bagels anyway. He cuts one in half and pops it in the toaster, leaning back against the counter to watch Dean wash the same burners and elements he’d washed last week.
Suddenly the need to be near the angel was so strong Dean nearly jumped off his chair and ran to the door, but stopped short. He turned to Beth.
The guilt on Castiel’s face now kills Dean. He hadn’t said that to make Cas feel bad; he was just being honest.
But by the time they hit day 3 and Castiel only seemed sicker, Dean was getting worried. The former angel had only emerged from his room once yesterday, and Dean only knew that because Sam had been in the kitchen when Cas came in and grabbed a handful of granola bars and a Gatorade.
“Dean, don't try to tell me you're okay.” Sam started, catching his brother's attention. In retrospect, it probably wasn't the best way to start the conversation, but he needed Dean to be honest with him. He needed to know what was wrong. “I mean, you kept zoning out on that last case, the drinking, you clearly aren't sleeping. What's going on with you, man? This isn't how someone who doesn't feel guilty acts.”
Dean blinks against the sting at the back of his eyes. To think he’d slept soundly while Castiel was out here, thinking these horrible things, and reaching worse conclusions. They should have talked more last night before they slept.
And they did spend more time together. Besides continuing Cas’s training, Dean also started teaching him to cook. They started with the basics, and once Cas had ramen and sandwiches down, Dean got him to help with lasagna and burgers. Cas was a quick learner and soon became proficient in the kitchen. Though he and Dean discovered Cas
Cas nodded, climbing out of bed and shuffling to the door. Dean wasted no time pulling the comforter onto the floor and moving on to the sheets. But when he went to grab the fitted sheet, he noticed it looked soaked. Way more than sweat could account for, especially with Cas wearing a robe. Dean turned to ask about it when he noticed that Castiel’s robe was also soaking wet all up the back.
“I understand why you didn’t tell me. I’m not saying it was right, but I can’t say I would have done things differently in your position.”
Power walking back to their room, Dean could smell Cas’s heat, but there was something off about it that hadn’t he hadn’t noticed before. He’d been too busy processing everything, but now he’d had a moment to calm down and prepare it was unmistakable.
“Can you at least tell me what’s going on?” Dean asked. “If you don’t want my help, alright. But I’m worried about you.”
Sam wanted more than anything to be able to tell his brother that the monster was lying. That Cas was back at the motel, safe and sound and watching bad daytime T.V, eating chips that Dean had taught him how to steal from vending machines. He wanted to tell Dean that they would go back tonight and find everything just as they'd left it this morning, and that tomorrow all three of them would pile into the Impala and leave town, and the shifter would just become another bad memory. Sam wished with everything he had left in him that he could tell his brother all that, and he felt his heart break at the desperation in his brother's voice as he begged for reassurance that couldn't be given.
Dean set the tea to steep and turned to lean back against the counter. Sam was still watching expectantly. There was no way he would let Dean get away with telling him nothing.
“Shut up.” Dean told the monster, still watching his moose of a brother doing his damnedest to sprint over the rocky ground.
He now folded that blue sweater neatly and set it on the bed, deciding he would return to thank Emilia for all she had done for him, and to give her the sweater back when he said goodbye. He then grabbed the trench coat and shrugging it on. It felt familiar, and more suiting for his vessel. Castiel wasn't sure what to do next. He wanted to go see Dean, but he knew the hunter needed time to process everything on his own before he could face Cas. Going to see him now might only push him away more, and at the very least it would make this a lot harder for everyone involved. The angel decided now was as good a time as any to go see Emilia as he'd said he would. Before he left, he made Sam swear to pray if Dean came back before Castiel returned. Cas didn't want him thinking he'd left again.
“I think we still have a few of Sam’s danishes in the fridge. How ’bout I heat some up?” Dean tries not to sound too hopeful. “There’re those raspberry ones you like.”
“So, you know a lot more people than we do, and I know you have unique friends... Have you ever met an omega who didn’t get... you know, interested in sex during their heat?”
One last kiss, and then Dean tucks his head back under Castiel’s chin. He drapes his arm over the former angel’s side, pulling him in even closer. Above him, he hears Castiel let out a bone-deep sigh and relax fully into Dean.
They stood there for a moment, smiling at each other and enjoying the mingling scents of omega and alpha joy. Dean felt almost high on it.
Cas gestured to his sweaty, disheveled self. Yeah, clearly he wasn’t done with... whatever this was. Dean kept silent, afraid if he said the wrong thing, Cas would stop talking.
“I spent a long time, years really, trying to prove Alistair wrong. He said he would transform me into something I wouldn’t recognize. I thought he meant turning me into a demon, so… when you pulled me out, I figured I won. I got out while there was still something in me I could salvage. And I thought… if I just tried hard enough, if I just pretended long enough, things could go back to normal.”
When he got back inside, he was about to go check on Dean, when the heavy flap of wings announced the arrival of the angel and Sam. Bobby turned and saw Cas, not quite sure he believed the guy was really here.
But that hadn’t happened. Castiel had been starving, thirsty, and tired immediately after he fell. After a couple of days, he got the hang of other basic needs like showers and keeping his body at a comfortable temperature. Now, he was as human as Dean and Sam. He needed entertainment, sunlight, and unfiltered air a couple of times a week. He needed exercise and rest after that exercise. But after months of living as a human, he still didn’t feel arousal.
"Dean, I know you can hear me. I know you're in there." His voice was ragged and tired, begging Dean to listen. Dean didn't, and landed another punch. He seemed fed up with fighting someone who wasn't fighting back, and grabbed Cas by the shoulder to hold him, while raising the blade above his own head, ready to strike the killing blow.
Dean grins so hard it hurts his cheeks, but he doesn’t care. He felt like he was floating. The weight of this week, of the last seven months, really a weight he’s been carrying since Hell, lifts. Not entirely, it will take more than one conversation for him to fully accept that his sexuality will not change with Castiel. More than that, that Cas doesn’t
Hearing that Cas got it, that he could empathize with Dean’s reasoning, helped Dean relax. It gave him hope Castiel would forgive him for lying and causing them both so much pain.
His fist connect with the strange man's jaw in a loud, wonderful crack. He was please to see the surprise and pain flash across his features. Refusing to let up, and trying to instill fear in his prey, Dean followed him where ever he swayed, continuing to deliver painful hits that caused resounding crunches and cracks, as well as grunts of pain. Despite that fact that Dean was crazed with bloodlust from the mark, he could sense a supernatural power similar to his own in this man, an angel, he realized, and why he didn't fight back was confusing, and infuriating.
“I honestly thought you knew. You’d spent time with Jimmy while I was in Heaven. You must have noticed he was an omega.”
Sam decided he needed to change the subject soon, before he outright told Castiel everything and pleaded with him to remember.
Dean nearly had to sit down as several emotions hit him at once. Relief, for one. Cas wasn’t cheating on him. And on the tail end of that realization came shame that he could think so lowly of Cas. Before he could process that, shook and confusion took over.
Sam woke up more when he heard that. Reflexively, his back straightened and he stood up taller. Any sluggishness in his movements was gone, and he couldn't keep the excitement out of his voice.
“Comfort sex. But... I still couldn’t enjoy it. I asked him if we could just hang out instead and he said he just wanted sex.”
"Look uh, back at the bar....When that guy said...what he said, and you-" Dean sighed. "Just uh, thanks. For sticking up for me and Cas like that. It means a lot."
Dean had lost his mother and father. He'd lost Bobby and all his friends and even Sam a couple times, but he'd never felt this. This was something new and powerful and crippling in a unique way. It was grief and loss and hopelessness all wrapped up in memories of past good times that would never come to pass again. All Dean had left of the love of his life were memories.
Dean's voice went quiet and soft on that last sentence. Sam frowned before realization dawned on him.
But Castiel sets a closed bottle of Astroglide on the nightstand and moves off the bed. When he returns, this time laying beside Dean, he’s wearing his boxers. A warm hand settles gently between Dean’s shoulder blades, rubbing soothing circles that help him relax.
The Impala purred as Dean pulled into the parking lot. Even though he hadn't said anything, Dean could tell Cas was at least curious, if not excited about the game. He had never really watched sports before, certainly never been to a game.
It hit him with the force of a high speed accident. He would never again be able to hold Cas, to make love with him, to joke around with him. He would never again hear that voice, see that smile, smell that unique, clean musk that the angel left on his clothes and their sheets. The reality that he would never get to say goodbye to Cas broke him even more, as he slowly realized that this morning had been his last anything with Cas. The last time he would ever wake up wrapped up in the angel's arms, the last cup of coffee Cas would ever steal from him, the last kiss he would ever be able to claim from those lips. All of that was over, gone. Just like that. Dean screamed.
It seemed whatever kinky request Dean had been expecting would have been less surprising than what Castiel said. For a moment he just blinked, then a cautious smile played at his lips like he was waiting for a punch line. When Cas said nothing else, Dean’s cheeks turned bright red, and he looked away.
Dean began to stir late the next morning. He could feel sunshine on his face, warm and bright, steaming in from the window above the bed. For a split second before he opened his eyes, he almost thought today might be a good day. Then the memories came flooding back like a tidal wave, just like they always did.
Asexual. Dean hadn’t heard of that before, but his social circle was pretty much only other hunters. They talked about monsters and guns and scars. They didn’t get into stuff like this.
Dean was about to tell Cas that might get complicated if he didn’t want to have sex, but he realized he’d been in here with Cas for several minutes and neither one of them was even a little aroused. Cas smelled like heat and slick, but somehow that didn’t turn Dean on right now.
On the other hand, it reminds him they still have a lot to talk about. They’d put a pause on their conversation last night because Dean had picked 2:56 am to start being honest, but they had agreed to finish that talk in the morning.
He and Sam were trying to play cards since the Wi-Fi and cable weren’t working at the motel, but Dean was having a hell of a time focusing. He wasn’t even returning Sam’s playful taunting. When he couldn’t even get through a game of crazy 8’s without throwing unplayable cards, Sam finally had enough of waiting for his brother to say something first.
. Not the cocky hunter, or the rebellious Michael sword, or the gruff man. Cas saw through all of that to who Dean really was, and
“He...he just...when he saw me he...it was like he couldn't stand to be near me.” the angel said slowly, more to himself that anything. His eyes were glazed over as his mind replayed the last thirty seconds over and over in his mind. “Sam, does he hate me?” he asked, now looking desperately to the younger Winchester.
Dean focused his attention on the man across from him, knowing that the man beside him was trapped anyways.
Dean shook his head, though he knew why Cas would think that. Benny was the closest friend he’d had in years. They fought together for a year, trusted each other with their lives. You can only do that for so long with someone before they become important to you.
“I knew I loved you. I’d known for a long time. But I didn’t want to watch you leave when I wasn’t enough. I thought it was better if we just ignored what was happening between us, at least then I could have you as my friend. But after you said those words, I couldn’t pretend anymore.”
“Cas, it’s just... being trans? That’s something a lot of the people I was with in the past wanted to ignore, you know? It always felt like they were just pretending I wasn’t. So I got used to not asking for much.”
Castiel fell into him like stress had been the only thing holding him up, and Dean’s touch released it like air from a balloon. He clung to Dean like he was scared this was the last time he would be able to, and Dean held him back just as firmly.
“So every time we had sex...” He gulps. “God, why wouldn’t you tell me? How could you let me touch you like that if you hated it?”
But now, those two days were over. Dean had to work the next day around noon, so he had to leave in the morning. And he wasn't sure when they would get this chance again.
“I know you and Sam are trying to help me, Bobby, but there is nothing either of you can do, okay? Nothing can make me stop thinking about him, what he did, what I could have done to stop him, or what I never said to him. Hunting doesn't distract me, booze doesn't dull the pain anymore, and talking about it makes it worse, because now I can't even try to ignore it.”
“You got a problem?” Sam demanded, eyes blazing with barely restrained fury. The other man quickly shook his head.
Soon, Dean’s breaths turned shaky and his movements erratic. He gripped the sheets so hard Cas was surprised he hadn’t heard them tear. But really, it was the way Dean called his name, desperate and low, that told Cas Dean was close. He stopped thrusting his fingers and instead reached deep and rubbed, putting constant pressure on that spot that had Dean panting out little
“For the flu?” Sam asked, not looking up from his laptop. They weren’t really on the hunt for a case just yet, but it didn’t hurt to monitor the local news.
After Bobby had sat on the couch with Dean and watched him down most of the burger and all of the pop, he went downstairs and outside to call Sam again.
Cas did, a scent-drunk smile pulling at his face. Dean knew the feeling. The shower stall was small and their combined scents were building up. Dean was pumping out pheromones meant to reassure omegas in heat, and Cas’s body responded in kind. He gave off a happy, safe, omega smell Dean couldn’t get enough of.
"Cas, I'm not someone you should trust or waste time on. Everyone who has ever gotten close to me has wound up dead. Or worse."
Castiel doesn’t exactly avoid him for the rest of the day, but he does an excellent job of timing his exits right as Dean is entering the room. When Dean comes to the library, Cas is already halfway to the hall, disappearing to the bathroom to take a shower. When they run into each other in the kitchen for lunch, Castiel is just finishing up a serving of leftover lasagna and leaves shortly after.
“Oh, no,” Dean said. “C’mon, showers are one of the great pleasures of being human. Here, turn around.”
“It’s just kind of the standard when someone is sick, you know? Keep ’em fed, hydrated, and comfy while they get better.”
“Sam had to calm me down. I was crying so hard I couldn’t talk. I didn’t even know why at the time. The next day when I tried to explain it to Jill, she told me she would refund me the nights I paid for in advance, but she wanted me out immediately.”
For the second time in less than an hour, Dean’s heart dropped. He’d been right. Cas didn’t want him.
The last 15 years had given him plenty of new material for his nightmares, and it was rare he went a week without at least one. Dreams of Hell, or of losing Sam or Cas or Bobby, played through his mind easily. After all, they had all come true before. Sometimes dreams of losing himself and becoming a demon again woke him up shaking so hard his teeth chattered, and he struggled to remember what was real.
“I think we can manage that,” Castiel says. For the first time in a week, his smile isn’t guarded. He looks at Dean with all the warmth and love that had been there before.
Dean nodded, trying to keep his face as neutral as possible so Cas wouldn’t think he was freaking out. Which he wasn’t, mostly. He was definitely going to see if the bunker library had anything on angel heats later, though.
“Is it this vessel?” Castiel asks quietly, his gaze dropping away from Dean for the first time since they’ve been talking. “I know in the past you’ve shown a strong preference for women. I’m sorry if-”
Dean was still moving around the kitchen, opening and closing cupboards and the fridge as he put the food away. Shopping might be Sam's job now, but Dean would be damned if he let his kid brother organize /his/ kitchen. He waited and listened for Cas to answer.
Dean didn't say anything, but he made a point of not letting go of Cas' hand. His glare and clenched fist was his only response. The hunters and angel all knew this guy wasn't sorry for what he said, he was just sorry he'd pissed off the wrong people.
Castiel lets go of Dean’s hands and climbs from the bed. But instead of getting under the covers and beckoning Dean to lie down with him, Castiel heads for the door.
After his talk with Sam, Dean was feeling pretty good about things. They finished out the hunt easily, and Dean was singing and drumming on the steering wheel on the way home. He was always excited to see Cas, but this time there wasn’t so much lingering doubt bogging him down. He just wanted to get home, scoop Cas up into his arms, and test out Sam’s theory.
“No problem, Dean! If you have any other questions, just shoot me a text or call. Oh! But if someone else answers, say you’re calling for Giselle. It’s a long story, tell you later. You know, when that anonymous omega isn’t waiting for their mate to come back.”
Dean said nothing to that. He wanted to take comfort in it and believe what Sam was saying. But his doubts weren’t erased so easily.
"Oh! Right," He fished around in his inside pocket, feeling for the paper. "You've been human for a year now, and you've been on earth a lot longer than that. It's time you became more cultured."
The hunter finally sighed. His mind made up, he nodded and sat back down on the sofa. If right now Dean needed space, then space Bobby would give him.
Once the gun was empty, Dean dropped it and sunk to the ground in a heap. Sam immediately went to him, sinking down next to his brother and wrapping his arms around him. At first Dean tried to push him away and struggle out of his grasp, but Sam only held on tighter. It only took a few more seconds for Dean to give in and fall against his little brother, weeping and screaming and wailing, the sounds punched from his body as if he'd been physically hit.
When they heard Sam coming, Cas reluctantly pulled away, a question in his eyes as he glanced between Dean and the door. Dean just smiled and took Cas’s hand.
Castiel's resolve broke. The tears ran down his face, but he was too busy grinning to notice. Even though he had seen it when Dean looked at him, felt it when they were together, it meant so much to the angel that the hunter had finally said it.
“Dean,” Castiel said, sitting up to catch Dean’s nervous eyes. “I’m not interested in what makes sense, I’m interested in what you want. Do you want this?”
“I didn’t want you to think it was because of something you did,” Dean says slowly. “You knew I’d had hook-ups after Hell, you saw me try to make it work with Lisa...” Dean shook his head. “Like I told you last night, I really thought it would be different with you. By the time I knew it wouldn’t, it felt too late to say anything.”
Dean woke up to silence. He was surprised he had managed to sleep at all, though looking at the time on his phone, it hadn't been for long. Maybe a half hour max. He sat up and groaned, glancing around the dingy cabin room. They wouldn't be staying here if those damn leviathans hadn't burnt down Bobby's house in the first place.
Cas nodded. “Despite what my body wants right now, I have no desire to have sex with anyone. I don’t want to be a slave to my instincts when I know I’ll regret it after.”
Feeling pain rising in his chest, Dean took a long swig from his flask. It didn't help. He had seen a lot of violent deaths. People he loved being killed on the job, some people who he thought were friends turning out to be enemies. All of that had been hard, but that night had been the worst. He had felt such a profound sense of loss and anger and betrayal, that he really was surprised he had been able to act normal around Sam the next day.
It didn't take Dean long to find a bar in town. He had thought about just buying some hard booze at a store, but he couldn't go back to the cabin yet, and he wasn't about to sit in his car drinking. He wasn't quite that pathetic. No yet at least.
It had been a standard salt and burn hunt. The ghost of some old janitor had been scaring kids at a local high school. He hadn't even hurt anyone really, he just hadn't moved on when he died. It was an easy job, his spirit hadn't even put up a fight when they torched his bones.
“I need you to understand, Cas, you are so much more important to me than sex. No question, I’m always gonna pick you. If that means we just keep doing what we’ve been doing, that’s okay with me.”
“Is there anything else I can do for you?” he asked, letting his breath tickle over the spot that made Cas shiver.
“Yes, it did. You were right, being clean feels much better. Dean, how did you know to do all this?”
Dean almost drops the burner in his hand. He glances at Sam, cursing his brother’s ability to see right through him. He still thinks Sam is mildly psychic or something from the demon blood.
After the song ended, the crowd went wild, cheering and clapping and whistling. The band smiled and bowed, thanking the crowd for coming to see them. Dean and Castiel both clapped loudly as the members left the makeshift stage.
Sam nodded, even though he wasn't convinced. Dean had been in worse situations than this before, and had still coped better. Something else was bothering his brother, something big.
The parking lot was nearly empty, only two or three cars remained, parked near the building, and Dean figured a couple of those had to belong to the staff.
The angel looked perfectly fine now, cuts, bruises and swelling gone. He was standing fairly steady on his own, the only sign he'd been in a fight at all was his messy hair and rumpled clothes.
About two hours later, everyone, even Cas, was smiling and having a good time. The brothers shared a few funny hunting stories they had, making Cas laugh and grin at them.
Seeing just how much Dean was enjoying this was a confidence booster. Any hesitation in his movements, uncertainty in his resolve, vanished. Castiel dropped his jaw further and redoubled his efforts.
It was a simple enough house. Two story, bushes lining the walkway, a few stairs leading up to the door. Nice, big windows, a patio. It looked like a family home, the type of place Sam used to think about living in.
The two that rushed Dean were smaller and obviously very inexperience in fighting. All it took was a few well timed punches and kicks to lay them out on the ground.
“Whoa! No one is trying for pups,” Dean said, only just remembering to keep his voice down so Cas didn’t hear.
The worst part is, Dean doesn’t know how to convince him. He’s spent months lying. How can he expect Cas to believe he’s telling the truth now? How can Cas ever trust that his touch is wanted and not just tolerated?
He opened his eyes, searching out his prey. Through a red haze, he locked on target with the man in front of him and grinned. He /needed/ to kill him.
Dean felt the urge to reach out and run his fingers through Cas’s sweat-damp hair, rub his shoulder, something to comfort him. But he kept his hands firmly on his knees.
Before Dean could process the fact that Cas knew what he normally smelled like, the former angel was rolling back over to watch TV. A close-up of a weird-looking monkey was playing, but Dean could hardly focus on that.
Dean cried out wordlessly, going taut as a bowstring as he shuddered through his orgasm. The sounds he made were too much, and Cas ground forward against the mattress, his own peak following shortly behind Dean’s. Somehow he had the presence of mind to keep working Dean through his pleasure, gradually reducing the pressure from his mouth and fingers before Dean could become over-sensitive.
The heat that had been simmering low in Castiel’s gut turned molten when he heard Dean beg. He groaned loudly, loud enough he almost didn’t hear Dean’s answering moan.
“Let me just get this straight. You love me, you don’t want to break up with me, but don’t want to have sex with me?”
Cas wishing he knew the right words to soothe Dean’s anxiety. It wasn’t the first time Dean’s insecurities had come up, and each time Castiel felt like he was flailing as he tried to find the right thing to say. But he knew he had to try something. “I have no expectations here. All I want is to make you feel good, and if this is a way I can do that, then I want to try. If it doesn’t work, that’s okay too. We can do something else, or stop entirely. But no matter what happens, I will not be disappointed. Alright?”
Sam was clearly annoyed at being interrupted, but Dean was grateful for the distraction and the excuse to stop talking to his brother for the moment. They stared at each other in silence for a few tense moments, only interrupted by the shrill ringing of Dean's cell. Sam was the first to look away. Dean fished his phone out of his pocket and looked at the number before answering.
The only light in the room came in through a high window, a breeze gently cooling the air within. The barely there light of the moon lit the cabin bedroom in a soft blueish hue, just enough light to make out the shape of the two men tangled together on the lumpy mattress.
That was putting it mildly, but Dean didn’t want to go into detail. About how Aaron started dodging his calls, then was how he would duck into the back of the store when Dean came in. How Sam bitched when Dean started driving an extra half hour to the next town over for supplies, and how Dean didn’t know how to explain why.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Castiel says, pausing in the doorway for a moment. In that instant, Dean can see his cold exterior fall away and reveal the hurt and the fear beneath it.
Dean grins and leans in for another kiss, greedy after being denied so long. Castiel obliges happily.
There wasn't a hint of sarcasm in the hunter's voice, he genuinely felt bad for Dean. Bobby wanted to try and talk some sense into him, but he knew the younger hunter wouldn't listen, so he'd left him alone and went back downstairs.
The hunter nodded again. He had noticed moving patterns with some other creatures, but never shifters.
Sam had his back to the door, slowly pacing and subconsciously checking for anything at the scene that could be linked to him. Once, he'd almost dropped his wallet at a scene like this. Thankfully, Dean had snatched it before they left, otherwise they would had gotten in deep shit. From the cops and John.
A few weeks later, Dean and Castiel were sitting in a bar, celebrating their most recent successful hunt. A wendigo of all things. Dean wasn't a huge fan of the things, but they were less cleaver and easier to identify than their usually prey. Well, Dean was celebrating, Cas was more the hunter's ride home, seeing as how Sam had dropped them off at the bar and then took the car to go back to the cabin. He hadn't felt like drinking, mostly he just wanted to sleep. Dean could understand that. Sam had been the one to lug the gasoline jug all the way out to the body to finish the job the flare guns had started. A good four or five miles through rough terrain. He was was tired and sore and had told Dean he was going back to the cabin. Dean had just waved him off with a grin, before wrapping an arm around Cas' waist and pulling the angel with him to the bar.
He heard a rumbling sound, and for a moment he worried it was the pipes before he realized the noise was coming from Cas. The omega in his arms was purring.
He took special care to stop at each of Dean’s scars, smothering them with as much love and devotion as he could. Cas knew Dean was still a little self-conscious, but he wanted him to know the scars didn’t bother him in the slightest. They made him feel even prouder of Dean than he already had. It took courage to be who he knew he was, especially when he had people trying to tell him otherwise. Dean hadn’t exactly grown up with a lot of support, besides Sam, but he’d never let that stop him from asserting himself as a man and doing what he had to in order to feel at home in his body.
Settling himself between Dean’s legs, Cas leaned forward to catch his mouth in a kiss. Dean eagerly accepted, parting his lips for Castiel’s questing tongue, moaning when it found its way inside.
“Can we just go to sleep, please? I’m exhausted,” Dean says, even though the anxiety running through his system is definitely going to keep him awake for hours.
Dean’s heart lept into his throat, but he tried to get his emotions under control before he started to smell sad. It would just confuse Cas and upset him more. Instead, he moved the plate of sandwiches to the nightstand and shuffled over until he could gently pull Cas into his arms.
“No! No, not in that way,” Dean says quickly. “I- Look, Cas, I thought it would be different with you. I thought if I just kept trying, things would get better. By the time I realized they wouldn’t, I didn’t want to mess things up.”
When he wasn't working there, he was at the Roadhouse, doing whatever the Harvelles needed him to do. Some days it was dishes, others he mopped the floors and cleaned up the kitchen, or wiped tables down and took out the garbage. After he turned eighteen, some night he even worked behind the bar, serving drinks. He liked doing that the best. Not because he was particularly fond of the actual work, but because he could make a lot of money in tips.
Dean heard his phone start ringing. That was probably a good thing because it wouldn't have been much longer before one of the brothers either left or threw the first punch.
Leaning over, the hunter pulled the angel a little closer and kissed his forehead. Castiel closed his eyes and leaned into the hunter. Dean pulled back to look at the fallen angel, still gently cupping the back of his head, his fingers tangled in the messy, dark brown mop. He knew what he did next would only make this harder, but he couldn't resist. He needed this, one last time.
Dean dumped the pillows on the bed and then headed down the hall for his room. If Cas was going to be stuck in his bed for a few days, he’d need some sort of entertainment. He didn’t even have a radio. So Dean grabbed the small TV from his dresser and carried it to Cas’s room. Netflix must have
"Dean," Castiel wished Dean could see how good he was, how many people he'd helped that we're alive and happy because of him. "You aren't a bad person. You are a very good person, who bad things have happened to. And though it is tragic what happened to those you loved, their deaths were not you're fault. They made their own choices, and could have turned back at any time."
“Sam, Dean is dealing with a lot right now. He's worried about you and how you're coping with Hell seeping through your noggin, we've got at least sixty leviathans on the lose, probably more, and we just lost Cas. That would make anyone seem 'a bit off'.”
Sam lowered his gun further and turned to look at Bobby for the first time since they'd been out here.
“I’ve wanted to bathe with you long before my heat started. I just didn’t want my intentions misconstrued.”
Dean can hardly bear the thought of losing Castiel. Even back then, before they both got their heads out of their respective asses, the idea of Cas leaving him forever hurt almost as much as the idea of Sam leaving.
this talk, remember? Listen, I’ll explain later. For now, we do really need the other stuff on that list, though.”
“That shouldn't be a problem, I can cure certain illnesses of the mind too. Many mental issues are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Once those are remedied, often the problem goes away What 'exactly' would you say it is?”
The smile quickly left Baldy's face and he took a blind swing at Dean. The hunter blocked it easily, he had seen it coming, before landing his own upper cut to the guy's stomach. The biker doubled over in pain. Taking advantage of the position Baldy was now in, Dean grabbed his head to keep it in place, before swiftly bring his knee up and hitting the guy square in the jaw, knocking him out cold.
“I must just be smelling the trench coat.” Dean thought at first. But as he woke up more, he realized the smell from the coat had been long gone, and this was stronger and different. It smelt like Cas, like his angel, but it couldn't be...
Dean wouldn’t bother saying anything normally, but money was tight right now, and heat-strength k-condoms were pretty expensive. No sense in Sam buying them if they were just gonna sit in a box until they expired.
For the first couple weeks after his brother told him what was going on between him and Cas, Sam had been surprised and a little uncomfortable with it. Not that Dean was with a guy, he hadn't cared about that, it was just odd thinking of him and Cas and him /and/ Cas. Thankfully, the couple had been discreet at first, mostly because they were still getting used to each other. Now though, they weren't subtle at all. Sam saw the exchanged smiles, the touching of hands here and there, even a few quick kisses that were meant to be mostly private. Never in public though, Dean wasn't /that/ open about it.
It wasn’t like Dean could go get them now. If he left, even for an hour, Cas’s omega might think his alpha had rejected him. According to some omegas Dean had spoken to, it was a horrible feeling. Not just emotionally, but physically. Dean couldn’t put Cas through that. It was his first heat; he deserved to be taken care of in every way he needed.
“Easy, alpha,” Cas said, amusement in his voice. “Are you gonna be like this the whole time I’m in heat?”
Though, now that the hunt was over, thoughts about their earlier spat arose. Sam still needed to find out what the hell was bothering his brother. Dean had been even worse on this hunt. He couldn't focus or stay on task, and it had been up to Sam to do most of the planning and killing. The younger Winchester was worried some vamp could have gotten the jump on them, because his brother clearly wasn't as focused as he needed to be. Anything less than fully alert was dangerous.
The grins that spread on both men's faces was nothing short of shit-eating. They locked eyes for a moment before leaning back in and meeting in the middle.
Concern showed clearly on Sam's face as he watched his brother over the roof of the car. Dean sighed and ducked his head, breaking eye contact in favour of staring at the sidewalk.
Being human was hard enough. Good for Castiel if he didn’t have to deal with all the alpha crap. Not only that, betas gave off the same pheromones as anyone else, but their sense of smell was nowhere near as good as an omega or alpha. They couldn’t pick up on the subtle scents caused by emotions. Which, though helpful at times, probably would have been overwhelming for Castiel now. Dean counted it as another plus for him.
But even though Dean knew Castiel had been an angel for most of the time they’d known each other, sometimes it was easy to forget what that meant. The whole size-of-the-Chrysler-Building thing was easy to forget when all Dean saw was a guy with messy hair and a backward tie. Cas was his friend, his family, and sometimes it was hard to remember that he was actually so unfathomable most people couldn’t look at his true form without dying or seriously hurting themselves.
“Yes!” Dean says, maybe a little more eagerly than he’d intended. “Yeah, I do. It makes me feel, y’know, close to you.”
He turned his head when he heard a strong heartbeat, and honed in on the sound of blood rushing through someone's veins. He didn't know who it was, and he didn't care, he just knew he needed to stop that noise.
When Sam hit the wall, he dropped the knife, and watched as the demons proceeded to kick it away. The Winchester knew he was in trouble now.
Castiel’s voice cut through Dean’s realization, slamming him back to the present. He looked on the verge of tears, and Dean didn’t like that at all.
“But I felt like... like I didn’t know who I was anymore. I tried to be the Dean from before, but… after a while, I figured out that guy... he didn’t exist anymore. How could he, right? No one could come back from Hell unchanged. I had to learn who I was now, and... that took a long time. It got easier after a while, but… I had to come to terms with the fact that there were some things I was never going to get back.”
can’t be normal. Maybe he’s cursed, or sick, or something is up with his hormones, but you should get him to a doctor-”
Dean hates when Cas makes a really good point. It makes it harder for him to remember why he ever had a different opinion.
Dean turned as much as he could on the bed without bumping whatever was behind him. Blinking his eyes open, he found himself face to face with a sleeping Castiel. The angel had his arm flopped over Dean, and was snuggled against the hunter as close as he could get. He looked peaceful, content.
“No, I...” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, not sure how he was going to explain this to Sam. “Actually, I need to take something off it.”
Dean stood awkwardly by the bed, fiddling with his hands when he noticed the smell returning. Castiel’s shower must be wearing off faster than he’d expected. Dean couldn’t imagine feeling painfully horny for a week with no outlet. Even if there wasn’t a willing girl or guy around, at least he had his hand, or-
When he got back to his bedroom, Cas had already changed the sheets and made a nest with what looked like every extra pillow and blanket in the bunker. He sat in the middle of the bed with his bag of trail mix, looking far better than he had when Dean got home.
It had been three days now since Bobby had started calling other hunters and friends, asking about faith healers, and Sam wanted to know if the older hunter had found anything or heard back from anyone.
That Cas is reading at the kitchen table means he was waiting for Dean, proving that he’s no longer avoiding him.
And Sam, the sneaky bastard, knew exactly what he was doing. Dean knew too because it wasn’t just the training that he bailed on. Sam was never around for movie night, he somehow always made grocery runs a Dean and Cas trip, he even found excuses to leave the room if Cas and Dean happened to both be in it already.
Dean turned to look at Cas, his gaze immediately softening. Anger left Sam's face, replaced by worry and morbid curiosity as he looked to his brother, needing to know the answer.
“How far does it go?” Cas asked, fingertips still exploring in slow, light touches that Dean had begun leaning in to.
Definitely people, monsters would know who he was and call him by his name. Amazing how your relation to someone changes what's important.
Dean hated that Sam could always get through his panicky, mother-hen instincts and make him see the logic. It made his brother a smug bastard in situations like this. Of course Sam was right to suggest asking Cas, but somehow that never seemed like an option to Dean. But if Cas was going to live here, and Dean was adamant he did, then they would have to learn how to talk.
The drive back to the bunker was silent for the most part. Once or twice Sam had tried to say something, but when he'd hinted at what Cas had said, Dean immediately turned up the radio and ignored his brother. He couldn't think about that right now. He couldn't dare to hope that Cas had meant what he said, or that he had even heard him correctly in the state they were both in. Later, with a bottle of whisky, while Cas was resting, he would let his mind wander. But right now, it was still too fresh. Too raw.
Castiel thought for a moment. Now that he had permission, he wanted everything and didn’t know where to start. But he held his excitement for now. He didn’t want his eagerness to make Dean nervous. He knew Dean well enough to know that disappointing people, especially those he loved, was a major fear of his. And now he knew Dean had been acting the way he had in bed because he was scared his body, his desires, would disappoint Castiel.
That didn’t sit right with Dean at all. Castiel was clearly suffering, and the idea of him doing this alone for millennia was just too sad.
Bobby took a sip of his beer. 	He wasn't sure how to help Dean either, but he needed to talk to the hunter himself before they made any plans.
About half an hour later, Dean's stolen car could be heard coming up the street. He was relieved, it wouldn't be too much longer until his angel passed out, and the Winchester just wanted to get them both home.
“Don’t worry. Omegas in heat give off very strong pheromones that trigger a protective instinct in alphas. You’re probably feeling a little of the effects from being so close to me.”
Carefully, so as not to damage whatever was in the box, he cut the tape, then put his knife away. Slowly, he opened the first two flaps, half expecting something to jump out at him.
There was a pause and some shuffling on the other end of the line. Sam heard a squeaky door open and slam shut, he guessed Bobby had stepped outside.
“Sam, Cas was one of the best friends Dean ever had. Your brother has been so busy worrying about you, and trying to figure out what to do about the leviathans, that he hasn't had time to get over the feathery asshole dying. It's probably just bottled up emotion that he doesn't want to talk about.”
However, Dean knew there was no point in lying. He was sure his brother had already told Bobby everything, the older hunter just wanted to hear Dean say it himself.
Sam smiled and quietly turned to leave the room, knowing this was a private moment between the two. He didn't see Cas lean in and meet Dean's lips, or his brother hold the back of the angel's head as he kissed him back gently, but he did hear the quiet moan which made him hurry out of the room a little faster.
“Anyway, Sam, you don't know what I'm going through, and no, I'm not okay, not by a long shot, but I am going to deal, alright?”
“Yeah, I would,” he said, so quietly it was almost a breath. Cas knew Dean dealt with complicated feelings it came to enjoying sex. Part of him felt like he shouldn’t enjoy the pleasure his body could give him. And while Cas knew he couldn’t take that shame away, he would do everything he could to show Dean it was alright to enjoy himself.
He had a question of his own he had to ask, but it didn’t scare him like it would have a few minutes ago. He was pretty sure he knew the answer, but he still had to ask, or his mind would hold on to it all day.
Sam nodded. It was true that the last faith healer had been a fake, his wife had been helping him by controlling a reaper. And Sam hadn't heard of one curing emotional problems, but there had to be a healer that was the real deal, and powerful enough to help Dean. Maybe one that could heal his mental state.
The eldest Winchester had tears running down his face now. He looked Cas dead in the eye and took a deep breath to steady himself.
Cas looked like he wanted to argue, but kept his mouth shut. He fidgeted uncomfortably as Dean pulled his shoes off one by one. Dean could tell he wanted to say something, but wasn't sure how. The hunter had a pretty good idea of what the conversation would entail, and he wasn't sure if he was ready for that yet.
While he let the conditioner soak in, Dean asked Cas to pass him the body wash. Once again, Cas picked Dean’s, and Dean grinned when he realized Cas would smell like him.
Once Dean was sure he was mostly okay, the Winchester stood up and walked over to his brother. After helping him out of the chains, he checked Sam to make sure he was okay.
“Don't worry, I don't judge. And don't worry about him being the exception. Stuff like that can't be put into quaint little categories, and it isn't a fixed thing. Who you love is who you love.”
Sam had hoped Dean would start acting more like his old self if he knew he was forgiven. That for once, this was the only thing bothering him, and acceptance for his actions would be enough to pull him out of whatever funk he was in.
Doing his best not to trip, the hunter carried the bags down the stairs. He spotted his brother leaning over the maps table with Cas sitting beside him. The two were talking and making marks on the grid, Dean wasn't sure why though. As far as he knew, they weren't on a case.
Once they arrived back at the cabin, Dean went strait upstairs without so much as a glancing nod to Bobby. Sam flopped on the couch and ran his fingers through his hair.
“For not wanting sex. I’ve tried to want it, Dean. I’ve tried to make myself feel aroused when we touch, but I just can’t figure out how-”
The younger hunter wasn't dumb, and he knew his brother so well he would know if Dean was lying to him.
Yeah, Dean remembered that. He remembered using that to gross Sam out when he was younger. Until Sam also presented alpha and could do it back.
“I was shocked when I saw him.” the hunter went on. “This morning, I mean. I was glad I guess. Hell, I haven't been happier in months. But at the same time...I don't know, I was pissed. He did something that was...I just don't know if I can forgive him.”
Sam knew it was a rhetorical question, Bobby didn't think there was any possibility that the angel and the hunter had been a couple, but he answered anyway.
His phone says it’s almost six in the morning. There’s no way he’s getting back to sleep now, not without Castiel here, so Dean gets up. The sheets need washing anyway. He strips the bed, everything but Castiel’s pillowcase is thrown into the laundry basket, along with his soaked shirt and whatever other laundry he sees lying around. Castiel’s clothes from last night are still on the floor by the bed, and Dean hesitates when he picks them up. Part of him wants to leave them where they are, to make the room look more like Castiel had stayed last night.
Sam sputtered, looking like he had about 500 sentence beginnings running through his mind and no idea which he wanted to start with.
So far, it seemed pretty quiet. No weird deaths in the obituary, no missing persons, nothing. He was about to fold the paper back up when something caught his eye. There was gonna be a band playing at one of the bars in town. Dean didn't recognize their name, he guessed it was probably a garage band. They were pretty good sometimes, usually they just played songs by other bands. Quickly, an idea formed in his head.
“Bobby, did you notice that after Cas had been around for a while, Dean stopped trying to pick up women? Most of the time he ignored them if they started hitting on him.”
“Hey, what happened to you two?” Sam asked when he saw the blood on Cas' face and Dean's dishevelled look.
