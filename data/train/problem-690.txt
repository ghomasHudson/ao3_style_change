Try as he might – and granted, he wasn't trying very hard – Sherlock could not stop himself from imagining John locked in the bathroom, his hand fisted around his cock and two fingers deep within himself as he came, Sherlock's name on his lips.
At Sherlock's skeptical expression, he carried on "Look, Sherlock, I- I lost you. I lost you once and I- when I first saw you when you came back, when I saw you here- this is it. This is it for me. I'm just- I don't want a relationship anymore" he said very seriously, before amending quickly "with other people! I don't want a relationship outside this. You and I. If we're going to be friends, we're going to be friends. If we're going to be more, we're going to be more. Whatever it is, this is it."
The doctor couldn't help but smile at it; it wasn't very common that he'd get any kind of response from his friend.
Convinced that John was never going to get around to it, Sherlock felt his lips twitch a bit and said "I know."
He found himself laughing in a fatalistic sort of way- he was never getting out of here, was he? He was never going home- he was never going to see John again. He closed his eyes as he heard the door to his cell being opened. In the beginning he had even attempted to subdue them when they came in, but now they were smart enough to chain his ankle to the wall.
"Dr. Watson, I need you to step outside, now." She ordered in a very steady voice, even as she paged someone.
That he did, and Sherlock was soon rocking his hips against him, fucking John's hand in slow thrusts.
The piece of wood wasn't even round and he felt every one of its corners being shoved into him. It was larger than any of them and it scrapped against his already torn entrance; he couldn't help but scream. It hurt like the slashes on his back had hurt, it hurt like pulling his nails off had hurt. It was pain like he hadn't felt in weeks.
and not the other way around." He enunciated "You obviously don't think there's anything wrong with your team treating him like shite. So why are you here?"
A bit tiredly, but accepting, Mycroft simply got up and took his phone out. "I'll have John's things transferred to the flat" he said to no one in particular, as he allowed the doctor to speak to his brother about the finer details of his future routine.
Two fingers in, more lube, three fingers in, and Sherlock even found himself rocking onto the intrusion. That John would often remove his fingers to let them play with his rim and stroke his cock helped greatly.
When he had suggested, back in July, that he ought to get back to work, Sherlock had absolutely lost it. It wasn't even that he started sulking or being passive aggressive or doing all of those annoying things he used to do before. He had accepted the idea, understood John's reasoning, and then proceeded to have several panic attacks in the days following the conversation. It wasn't hard to put two and two together.
"A ground team was… interviewing the members of the group for information. I was unable to see to the proceedings in person, but I made sure to assist with the… interrogation methods remotely." His eyes right now were the reason why Moriarty had dubbed Mycroft the Iceman. He went on "Unfortunately, after information was acquired, rebel forces bombed the building they were being kept in and the men were lost to the explosion. Interpol has already been informed, of course."
"Never…? You never felt- you never wanted to? Have sex with anyone?" and it was one of the Things They Never Ever Talked About.
"Today we celebrate!" he said joyfully, and then he gave Sherlock's mutilated feet a couple of pats that would have looked much like camaraderie in any other situation. It just made the detective hiss and pull his feet towards himself.
She was startled at his voice, but relayed the information all the while telling the operator that she didn't trust the man standing in front of her.
! I could get captured tomorrow or on the next case or the one after that- it's what I do. It's who I am." He tried to explain.
There was some shuffling from inside and another sigh. Then finally, the detective said "You can come in." and he sounded defeated.
Sherlock groaned and arched into John even more. For a moment, the doctor was afraid it had been a groan of pain but the detective was clutching onto him tighter. "Deep like that" he instructed.
Rhythmic grunts and the sounds of skin slapping against skin were heard for the next couple of minutes as the man mechanically fucked into him. He felt his eyes prickle, but he just blinked it away; it'd be over soon.
He looked down at his hand. Semen was drying on his skin and he really wanted to get up and clean it off-
Sherlock shook his head, and then he gestured to the vast amount of gauze, bandages and plaster that had just been discarded to the rubbish bin. "I took it off, but now I can't do it." It hurt too much to bend and try to re-do the bandages himself, but he had been trying to avoid John seeing the scar. So much for that.
He flicked through them like an album. And like an album, every single picture came with a collection of memories. He remembered all of them, he remembered exactly what they smelled like, what they tasted like, what they sounded like, if they were bigger or smaller or rougher or faster- he remembered everything. But they were dead. They were dead and his nightmares were just that.
That Friday, they were having another of their get-togethers, and the party ended up being brought over to Sherlock's cell. There were eight of them in total, probably the number of men that were at the base at any given moment.
"I see you are rather aware, brother mine. Welcome back" the man said, balancing on his umbrella, but Sherlock could read his emotions like a book. "Doctor Watson, I believe you would find fresh air to be quite invigorating this evening, I'm informed the staff has just brewed some tea" he said to John, but his eyes never left his brother.
Sherlock was blinking at the carefully picked out, thoughtful gifts, and his throat closed up. After a beat, he cleared it and finally looked up at the policemen in front of him.
This was the night Sherlock cried from the pain. It hurt, it hurt, it hurt deep inside of him and he wanted to claw his insides out so it would stop. Something was wrong, something had teared and he couldn't do it- he couldn't do this anymore.
When Lestrade first got the call, he wasn't briefed properly on the details. The superintendent had simply sent him off to the scene and he'd been expected to read the whole case file in the car.
He stared at his hands. Even hastily bandaged as they were, it was easy to see he was missing two fingers off his right hand, one finger off his left. His feet were even more unpleasant to look at; all his toenails were missing, there was dried blood all over them and they were still very angry and red – this one was recent, only three days ago.
Mycroft said something about needing to talk to doctors, but John wasn't listening. He was slowly approaching the bed like he half expected Sherlock to jump up at him when he reached it. But the detective lay as still as death- no, terrible comparison- still in sleep, there better.
But Sherlock was like a dog with a bone and they all knew it; he wasn't going to stop until he found what he was looking for.
"John" Sherlock's voice was steady, but firm, and the doctor had to grit his teeth to stop  himself from talking.
The smell made Sherlock turn his head away in disgust. He was gritting his teeth hard as he took the pounding from the man behind him; he couldn't bring himself to open his mouth to take the other man in.
He felt as Sherlock trembled under his hands and he knew that the detective was cold. He was only wearing a hospital gown and- god, he was thin. He was so, so thin.
Lestrade's response didn't take even a minute and he was dashing to his room and pulling his clothes on in a hurry. He almost forgot his gloves in his haste and had to run back to get them.
He was growing weak and everything felt cold around him, why didn't he have a coat? He should be wearing a coat in the winter. He'd stare at his hand and was horrified to see he was missing fingers- what had he done? His wrist looked thinner and thinner every time he did that. Was he dying? Was he sick? Why were his fingers falling off?
"Right. Well, I'll ah- be back in just a bit" he said with finality as he got up and went for the door.
It was one of the most terrifying panic attacks John had ever seen. That the poor men saw Sherlock gasping for breath in John's arms and tried to help only made things worse. There was a lot of yelling involved, and John almost phoned an ambulance. When they finally made it home, the detective hid in the bathtub of all places and stayed there for over an hour with hot water running down his face.
The unspoken question still hovered in the air, but John went on to take care of the surgery scar on Sherlock's leg. This one he had already been helping with; it was essentially healed and only needed a bit of creams applied on it so it'd heal faster.
John seemed to stop and consider the question carefully. It was the first time Sherlock attempted anything even remotely resembling a conversation. Trust the detective to jump straight into the hard questions.
"The mission was a success, the information found on the base was the last piece of our puzzle and we're officially closing the file on Moriarty." He tapped at the table, having sat down again. "Your name has also been cleared back in London, and you will be welcomed back into your previous position should you wish to do so."
"I can't bring it over to Baker Street, it's evidence! Ask for anything else, come on" Lestrade pleaded, feeling like he was walking on thin ice.
Sherlock only woke up two times that night and John merely ran his hand up and down his arm in reassurance before snuggling up to him even more; it worked and the detective was soon fast asleep.
What they had between them was still in its infancy, but more importantly, the nature of Sherlock's trauma made everything that much more fragile. There was something intensely intimate about sharing a bed with someone else.
Their old kitchen table had literally fallen to pieces after one of Sherlock's experiments exploded. John spent days brooding over the table, while Sherlock had spent days brooding over his lost chemistry set.
The man stayed silent for a while, looking around as if he was grasping for words, and wasn't that a sight?
"John, I am… a ridiculous man. I honestly question your sanity at times, to have chosen myself for a partner, but I find that I cannot complain." He smiled, his eyes crinkling "The things I have put you through, and all our ups and downs… How, even so, you found me deserving of your loyalty is something I cannot comprehend, but I am incredibly grateful for it. You are a soldier with the highest of morals, a doctor with the kindest of hearts, and to be loved by you is the single greatest honor I could dream myself receiving." He looked down for a moment, trying to blink away a tear that simply wouldn't go "I cannot say much of myself, but I can tell you this: you stand here today before the person who loves you most in all this world. I promise I will never let you down and I am privileged to have a lifetime ahead to prove it."
"I love you, you know that?" John's voice, when it finally came, was almost a whisper. He lifted his clean hand up to tangle in his partner's curls and bring him down for another kiss. "I love you so much, Sherlock."
"Sher- please" John's voice broke and his eyes were shut, but he had turned his head and Sherlock took it to mean he should kiss him.
John eyed him a couple of times and then traced his fingers across the table, looking very much like he was trying to properly phrase something.
And so he said nothing. For as long as he didn't put the cards up on the table, he didn't have to deal with the consequences and he could imagine whatever outcome he wanted. Although, to be honest, he didn't even know what outcome he wanted anymore.
. It had been two years, and it felt like it'd been yesterday; it was a wound that had never closed and sometimes he thought it never would. Trust Mycroft to waltz in and twist the knife that bit more, as if John needed a reminder.
Sherlock listened for the pattern and then he narrowed his eyes at John. "You texted Mycroft." He accused pointedly.
He didn't want to hover around his flatmate, but the man was taking a shower on his own, with no support bars like the hospital had and John didn't want the detective to slip and hit his head or something. He was taking too long.
They stood at that altar, flanked by a falsely disgruntled Mycroft and a beaming Lestrade. And they knew it was their vows, out of everything from that day, that would stay with them for years to come.
He was so focused on texting John – and stopping his partner from mobilizing the entire British Intelligence – that he didn't hear the footsteps approaching and only realized he was no longer alone when Donovan's voice cut through the scene.
He almost jumped in anticipation at getting a text. Only three people ever texted him: one was currently doing the dishes a few meters away and the other two usually only texted about cases.
"I thought that was a murder?" John countered, still frowning, but now with his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes narrowing the slightest bit.
It honestly sounded like they were getting him a replacement deerstalker, but when Sherlock opened the envelope it was to find a picture of a solid wooden table.
John's huff was affectionate and he got up, folding his paper and placing it on the coffee table. "Alright, fine. I was going today anyway, might as well do it now." He said, in defeat.
He bent down to kiss his detective, but did not move to straddle him just yet. "You sure, love? If you were on top, you could control things better."
Into the second week, one of the men walked in and nudged him with his foot "Go" he told him, gesturing vaguely to encompass that Sherlock ought to position himself rather than be held down like they'd usually have to do.
"That would be Lestrade" Sherlock said simply. As he looked out the window and saw the car pulling up across the street. "And Donovan" he added just as nonchalantly when he saw the woman exit the car first.
He had also brought puzzles, actual picture puzzles, and Sherlock had taken to putting them all together as quickly as he could. It made for John sitting and staring at him for hours at a time, staring at his right hand with the three fingers and his left hand with the four fingers and a ring finger that did not move.
He had been allowed to interrogate their suspect, but there was only so much he could do with a freshly showered, custodial-uniformed culprit. He was going to go through the man's actual possessions, clothes and flat later.
It was somewhat bittersweet and surreal to be leaving this place after two months of pretending the outside world didn't exist. But Mycroft himself was there leading their little party out into the halls and into the sleek black car that awaited them, and it seemed to ground Sherlock.
Sherlock had already left his Belstaff by the door, but he'd also removed his suit jacket once he'd come into the room. Now he was on his side, lying on the bed and staring at John silently.
He put his skills to use and with the feeling of being surrounded by his lover, and having the man's hands in constant contact with his own, petting him lovingly, Sherlock literally couldn't pull himself away from the moment. Perversely, defiantly, he'd even tested, just to see what would happen. He tried for a second to allow himself to be pulled back into Serbia like it'd just happened in the living room, but the amount of contact and the staggering differences in situation did not allow for it. He was stuck in the present and the realization only made him pleasure his lover even more enthusiastically.
The room was dim enough that it'd be very hard to see what Sherlock was holding unless one angled it towards the light. No lamps were turned on in the room, but the moon was full and shiny in the sky and it casted a bright, white glow through the large windows.
And like he'd do often, he checked to see if his friend had woken up. And when he was certain John was dead asleep on the couch, he reached into the side table by his bed and opened the file Mycroft had given him so he could look over the pictures one by one.
He knew he needed to say something, anything, but there weren't any words- there were no words. His heart was being stabbed repeatedly in his chest and he wanted to bolt from the room so he could cry in peace yet again.
to. I understand you want to help, but… Sherlock, even I don't want to see it. This… it could be very… " he trailed off.
"Do you want my coat? I can give it to you." he offered, because when he'd been in her place, his blanket had been the most comforting thing he'd had.
He could see the evidence clear as day. The circular bruises on her wrists, the tears on her lips, the finger marks under her knees. Her cheeks had mirrored idents on either side, her hair had been pulled out in places and there was human skin under her fingernails-
He moved a couple more times at almost the same speed, but it was hard to move so slowly when everything was so slick. Still, he did his best until Sherlock's fingers dug a bit more pointedly into his thigh and the man tilted his head slightly before moving his hips against him. It was a non-verbal command, but it was clearly understood.
As the door was closing behind Greg, Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked up at John. "It's like they're blind on purpose." He told him, shaking his head. And then grabbed the other shoe and started scraping something off the laces.
When John walked into the kitchen, looking for paper towels, Lestrade was stood there frowning at him. He'd clearly come up to bring forensics down with him.
Needless to say, his captors had been less than pleased to find him out of his cell and the security on him had doubled. They did not, however, realize what he had managed to do. As far as they were concerned, they had an MI6 agent on their hands and were going to push him till he sang.
"Is that Greg?" John rounded the corner into the living room, looking extremely confused in his large bathrobe. His hair was still dry so he clearly hadn't started his shower yet.
The doctor was staring at him in puzzlement, but he still looked slightly exasperated. He looked around the room, as though still searching for words, as though gathering his courage again. He wiped his hands on his trousers and closed his fingers into a determined fist. It was now or never, he didn't want there to be any ambiguity to what he was saying.
Sherlock's left hand sought John's other one, but this time he placed the man's fingers on his hair, before letting them go. Taking the hint, his lover ran his fingers continuously through his curls and the detective smiled against him. "That's perfect. Perfect" he told John, just before taking him in his mouth again.
Sherlock had propped himself up onto his elbow and was looking down at John's face now "I know you meant it." He said it with an earnest and open expression, and then he put his Consulting Pillock face back on and continued with "How could I not, what with how many times you've locked yourself in the bathroom to masturbate the past five months."
John helped him off his bed the first time he decided to walk outside of his room – balcony trips notwithstanding. He held onto the army doctor and onto the IV stand as he slowly put one foot in front of the other until they made it past the door.
The glare he received in return was answer enough so he just snorted and picked up the paper. "Alright then, suit yourself."
"The guys from forensics picked those out." Lestrade spoke, breaking the trance that both John and Sherlock had fallen into.
"Why! Why didn't you tell me!" he demanded, shouting even as he knew he probably shouldn't do it in a hospital.
Once past its initial stage, their relationship slotted into place like it had always been there. They moved in sync with each other like a dance they had rehearsed and everything simply fit.
She shook her head softly "He pulled on some stitches, that's all. There's nothing to worry about." She assured, even as she refused to elaborate. These people were clearly under strict orders to not discuss Sherlock's case. "I did up his morphine a bit for now, but if he continues to show signs of distress, please let the nurse know." Smiling, but clearly putting an end to the conversation, she nodded to him and walked off.
The detective didn't mention hearing it, and John didn't mention his missing fingers; the unspoken words hung between them like a cross that neither wanted to carry, and it only grew in size and weight as the days went by.
He fell asleep halfway through the ride back home, leaning on John's shoulder as the man wrapped an arm around him invitingly.
"Do you ever wear pants, John?" he commented light-heartedly, and it did break the tension somewhat, but John still felt as though his heart was going to leap out of him.
He spent the whole night dripping wet, shaking in the unforgiving cold as he had neither his blanket nor his trousers anymore. He wondered what John was doing right now, half a world away. He was probably sitting in his chair by the fire and having a hot cuppa as he read the paper or wrote on his blog.
"You counted the-" John interrupted, spluttering. Then he shook his head "I can. If I want to, I can."
But Sherlock was way too drugged, way too confused to do or say anything. It was clear from his glossed over eyes that, yes he was awake, but saying he was aware or conscious would have been a bit of a stretch. His eyes kept rolling back into his head, like he was desperately being pulled back into sleep, and for some reason his mouth was open even though he wasn't making any sound.
John almost jumped from his seat in alarm, his eyes wide as he stared towards Greg and Sherlock in turn. What- what? How did Greg even know- and weren't they all dead-
Realization dawned on Lestrade's face, and for a moment Sherlock was impressed that the man had actually deduced what he and John had been up to. The DI was quick to prove otherwise: "Oh, yeah. Are you feeling better? Sorry, I know you were a bit under the weather yesterday, but listen-"
Sherlock had immediately hidden his hands inside his dressing gown and was schooling his features into something casual. "Ah, Lestrade. I assume my brother couldn't keep his abnormally large nose out of my business, as per usual" he drawled, and he sounded exactly like his old self; it made John smile.
The young detective rose from his seat almost tentatively and walked towards his lover like he didn't know what else to do. Truthfully, he could feel his blood pressure had plummeted and he was extremely dizzy.
He ate a spoonful of the soup and the look of pride and happiness on John's face was enough motivation for him to keep going.
There was an apology on the tip of Sherlock's tongue, but he knew the doctor had no use for it, so he just nodded and watched him enter the house through the back door.
Reassured, John started pushing back in just as slowly, and he could actually feel Sherlock relax around him. "You feel absolutely amazing, love" he whispered against Sherlock's skin, because he had never felt anything like this before. He'd never been inside another man, and it was tight like he couldn't believe it.
When they sat at their usual places, each holding a cup of hot steaming coffee, it almost felt like time had turned back.
"I just- need a minute" he said and his voice was so breathless that he wondered if Sherlock even heard him.
Once his lover's sweater and jeans were off, Sherlock felt the traumatized, wounded animal inside him uncoil. He was dressed and John was not; he was the one who had the upper hand. John was the vulnerable one, not him. He wanted to reprimand himself for thinking it, but it was as instinctual an association as 'fire burns' or 'water is wet'.
Slowly, but surely, they made their way out of the room and into the halls; the faithful IV drip being dragged along with them. They came across some of the nurses they knew, and Sherlock was trying very hard not to let his imagination run too wild at the amount of people he was surrounded by. His gaze focused on the two men standing by the hospital entrance up ahead- Mycroft's men.
"Why does he keep doing that?" John asked out loud once when Mycroft's visit coincided with Sherlock waking up.
. John wasn't a sadist, he just had the same vein in him as the Sherlock who'd thrown an American agent out the window for hurting Mrs. Hudson – it wasn't sadism, it was satisfaction in revenge.
"Do you- do you want-" John started, clearing his throat "Do you want to try it?" he asked, full of uncertainties, gesturing vaguely towards Sherlock's lap.
Immediately, he yanked down on the handle and opened the door, but the room that lay beyond was in complete darkness.
"Stop looking at me like that. I was half planning to seduce you into round two, this morning" John said, and it probably wasn't true, but it helped ease the concern on his lover's face. "It's a nice sort of ache." He added, because there was no use trying to deny the soreness altogether – his lover was a bloody detective.
"You'll be the death of me, won't you?" John sighed, dropping his head onto the mattress before him.
He knew he had to make it worth his while. He knew he needed to give them incentive to go for his mouth instead of fucking him. And so he breathed in heavily and tried to picture exactly what would feel good. If this had been John in his mouth, how would he have done it? What would John have said?
The complete non-sequitur left the detective frowning, his mouth slightly open in confusion. He nodded mechanically, because he didn't know what else to say. All he could do was stare as John got up from the bed, a smile on his face, and left the room. The door almost managed to close behind the doctor, but it stayed open much like their oddly unfinished conversation.
He could actually concentrate on John's taste, on the smell of his naked skin, on his soft moans. And all he had to do was opened his eyes and look up to see his lover's face contorted in pleasure.
"No! You sent him there! You could have sent the entire British secret service to get the job done, but no! No, you sent
His hands roamed up and down the detective's thighs, and Sherlock tilted his head back, giving him more access to his neck.
It was obvious to the detective that his lover had just gone on a mental tangent, but he couldn't tell what it was just from looking. The silence held for so long that he was about to open his mouth again, but John finally nodded and leaned over to kiss Sherlock on the forehead.
something. While Sherlock had his experiments and his remote case-solving, John had spent the last five months holed up in the flat and almost climbing up the walls.
A couple of nights after The Incident, they were on their bed and Sherlock pulled away from kissing John to stare at him for at least a whole minute before finally speaking "I want to see you."
He wanted to corner her and ask her all the details, but she was gone before he could get his voice back.
The video on the tablet was of a room- a hospital room. There was an extremely gaunt man lying on a bed, heavily bandaged hands sitting atop the covers while the rest of him was hidden beneath them. He was bald, recently shaven, and a variety of bruises decorated his sunken face- it looked like a corpse someone had dug out of a fresh grave.
He kissed Sherlock's neck, nuzzling softly as they enjoyed the hot water hitting their skin. Droplets would fall from Sherlock's curls, landing on John's nose and he almost wanted to lick them away.
The younger man continued heaving; subdued moans accompanying each spasm. But there was little more than bile coming up and soon it was just dry heaving that kept him hunched over the side of the bed.
When they dragged him back to his cell, the chair was gone and so were most of the men. Unfortunately, no one had cleaned the floor. So now the cell smelled like a mixture of the usual semen and blood and the new stench of urine and bile.
Suddenly John wasn't eating his breakfast so much as angrily stabbing at it and shoving it into his mouth without even tasting the food properly.
Sherlock wanted to say that he wasn't actually protesting, but he couldn't voice the realization he'd had just yet.
The detective looked suspiciously between his brother and John – who was still eating like he had nothing to do with this.
The squeeze he received in return made it clear Sherlock'd understood, but the younger man was not pulling off of him.
"How did you even find this place?" Lestrade's voice echoed through the room as the man stepped in, soon followed by Donavan and then John.
"Are you trying to get rid of me?" The doctor asked skeptically and Sherlock looked sheepish. "Does this have something to do with those skin samples in the fridge?"
The hospital – private facility? – was an enormous estate just outside London. It sat surrounded by carefully manicured gardens, beyond which lay vast stretches of green fields as far as the eye could see. John felt as though he had been transported to the early 1800s; surely the building was that old, if not older.
Under the detective's scrutiny, John cleared his throat "I didn't- well, I mean, I had been thinking about it. And, well, just in case, you know?" now he suddenly felt embarrassed by his forethought.
because of how vile they sounded. And it baffled him that the DI thought nothing of it. "She was one of the people who sided with Moriarty last time, have you forgotten that already? Sherlock is a psychopath? Let's arrest him and make him jump off a roof?!"
No, it hadn't been. But still, Sherlock dutifully sighed and murmured "Dull. Can we go now, John?" he asked, turning to his partner.
"You're not serious, are you? The investigation! John- Sherlock, come on-" the DI reasoned behind them even as they left without even looking back.
His still unbroken will refused to comply, refused to willingly display himself like he was agreeing to it. He looked away and towards the wall, closing his eyes and waiting for the blow that would surely come.
"Yes, your assistance, Dr. Watson, in a matter of utmost importance. Now if you'd please accompany me, I have a car waiting ou-"
"Don't move." She ordered, keeping her eyes locked on his and her gun aimed at him as she snatched the coat like a snake and slowly put one hand through each sleeve, while holding the gun with the other.
John hated few things more than feeling helpless. It always reminded him of standing there uselessly with a phone in his hand while Sherlock jumped to his death right before his eyes.
He even tried to angle it that way; he tried to reason that, to some people – the likes of who would visit Irene Adler – this captivity and submission would have been extremely enjoyable. If people paid money to be treated like this, surely it couldn't be as bad as he was making it out in his head?
He nodded slowly, but he realized how tense his posture was and how tightly he was squeezing his hands shut.
The three of them were quiet, standing there a bit awkwardly as they tried to ignore the unspoken words they all knew to be there.
He moved onto the next picture with the same hungry eyes, and he glanced back to Sherlock only for a second. "Mycroft's been busy, hasn't he?" but as he cycled through the pictures, his expression started to shift into something more guarded and his grip on the photographs tightened.
When the man pulled out, Sherlock couldn't help but clench trying to spare himself further pain, hoping none of them wanted to go a second round. But the hands let him go as the men stepped away, laughing merrily among themselves.
Later they found out that, in fact, the entire hospital was MI6. The facility belonged to the Secret Intelligence Service and catered exclusively to agents returned from missions requiring long term care. Mycroft had casually offered the information up when John let it slip Sherlock might not be feeling terribly safe.
He had his team ready to go in five, and Sherlock was leading them in like he couldn't sit still for a second.
It was a gentle prod, but Sherlock knew what the question really meant. He wasn't put off by John's concern; he knew how careful his partner was about not mollycoddling him and could appreciate his support.
The two years and a half that had gone by stretched all over the flat, griping every single surface even as the rooms looked identical from before. Mycroft's men had done a thorough job of putting everything back exactly where it had all been. But like Sherlock's too short hair, too thin frame and mutilated hands, it was impossible not to see the difference.
He let them slide together a few times, absolutely reveling in the feeling of the warm, sticky mess between his lover's thighs.
"It didn't hurt." He blurted out "I knew you would try to lessen the pain for me, but I just assumed that the act was inherently painful."
They hadn't been in the car for a full second and already John was demanding answers. Mycroft just put a hand up to silence him and then reached for glasses in the compartment near his door, poured them both a decent amount of scotch and nodded toward it "You'll be needing that, I imagine."
"I figured as much" Mycroft said, seemingly a response to his unspoken words. And then a tablet was being thrust into John's hands. "It's a live feed."
Turning back to the girl, he recalled the name in her missing person's file and spoke in the softest voice he could manage. "Amanda, I'm with the police. I'm here to help you."
John wasn't even trying anymore. He was sniffling as much as those gathered around them, and this time it was him who almost jumped the gun straight into their kiss.
"That's what it was" Sherlock interrupted, shaking his head. A small, disbelieving smile tugging at his lips.
The group that stormed into the site was heavily armed and many in numbers. They spread out to cover the most ground; there were dozens of tunnels and spaces under the station, and even Sherlock wasn't sure where to start.
"Alright. Come on" the doctor nodded, getting up off the couch and offering his hand even as he zipped himself back up.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut for a moment before answering, still facing the back wall and not John. "It's not like I planned-"
"Mr. Holmes, I need you to lean on the door frame, can you do that for me?" she asked as she already pushed him towards it.
Sherlock woke up to John's hand around his cock, and a couple of minutes and very few words later, the doctor was straddling him on their bed and riding an orgasm out of both of them.
His hand was forced one night when he woke up from one of his nightmares. Well, it wasn't forced so much as politely nudged. He could have ignored it, but in the end he didn't.
The DI went on "He showed us where they get the films. It's a site on the deep web. It's got all sorts of security measures in place, but his account is already verified – we have access to all the content now. They do livestreams, we recorded the most recent one." He turned to look at Sherlock. "If you can get anything from the video- anything that could tell us her location… "
Ignoring her, Lestrade just motioned towards a shed where the naked body of a girl lay on the floor.
John stood in front of Sherlock, his hand raised and placed gently on the taller man's face. The detective was leaning down and into the touch, his gloved hand coming up to cover John's own. They seemed to be talking, their heads pressed close together almost as if-
Crouching in front of the detective so that they were pretty much eye to eye, the guy blew out the cigarette smoke onto his face and proceeded to put it out on Sherlock's exposed shoulder. The detective gritted his teeth, breathed out his nose, but said nothing. This was child's play considering what they had already done to him.
He would touch John all the time. He'd kiss him without a warning when he took a break from his experiments, but he would also drag John into their bedroom at night and snog him passionately.
John had kicked some of the sick off, but there was a lot still there and the smell wasn't that faint either. He was a terrible liar, so he made sure he was facing the sink, away from Lestrade, before answering "Sherlock's got a bloody stomach bug. I told him not to go out on a case today, but you try stopping him from doing something he wants to do." He said with his best Disgruntled Sidekick voice.
He felt himself twitch slightly at the sight of his naked lover spread out in front of him – he'd have never understood physical desire had John not come along, he was sure – and he slowly made his way towards the bed so he could join him.
And so John helped him back to the the(ir?) bedroom, noting how exhausted he seemed from the simple act of taking a shower. He came back with an armful of medical supplies – Mycroft had stocked the bathroom cabinets full – and quietly cleaned and dressed Sherlock's incision scar again.
When they were done with him, they clasped his chain back onto his leg and Leader patted his face twice before squeezing his cheeks between thumb and index finger. "You do that again." He dared and then got up, not looking back once as he left with a bloodied piece of wood in his hands, his two subordinates following after him.
He pointedly widened his eyes and shook his head a bit, trying to call himself back to the real world, the room. Scotland Yard. Case.
John smiled indulgently and bumped their shoulders together. "Ok, you bloody genius. Go prove everybody wrong."
After that, John stopped holding himself back. He allowed himself to fuck into his lover as fast as he could as hard as he could, egged on by the obscene squelching noises they were making and by Sherlock's punctuated moans of pleasure.
"So, ah, it was very- there was a lot of… internal damage." He finished, finally, because he couldn't think of anything else to say aside from getting into details.
The door was opened in a powerful move and only then did Sherlock realize he'd been pounding furiously at it, while still pressed against the wall by its side.
They stayed in silence for a little bit, and then the detective was hiding his face into the base of John's neck, nuzzling the pillow underneath. John brought a hand up to pat his hair, turning his face to kiss the curls with affection.
"Will you let me show you something? I'm just going to take my gloves off." He moved his hands very, very slowly. "I'm not going to do anything else, will you let me do that?"
"It's healing pretty well, no signs of infection." He commented when he was done, because what else could he say?
John widened his eyes and instinctively searched for Sherlock in the darkened corridor, but he couldn't see much from his vantage point.
The girl was turned on her side, and the shift in position cued Sherlock into looking back at the screen. She was flailing as her captors moved her around and didn't leave her with much to hold onto. She tried leaning on her elbow, but one of the men pulled her hand away and she was back to scrambling.
"I don't have the keys" he told her calmly, still holding his hands up. "But I will get you out of here, just let me call-"
"It is, also." Greg agreed, reminding the other two that he was still in the room. "Listen, can you come down to the station? We have him in custody. We can use him to find the others." He was addressing Sherlock, now.
It's like the day knew what had transpired between the two men, for it woke up sunny and bright. May was here and with it, spring was in full bloom. The scenery outside was positively gorgeous and John couldn't help but smile when he looked out the window after rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
When morning came, however, Sherlock simply put his plastic tea cup down on the table – he'd taken to having breakfast sat down on the cushioned wooden chair with John, rather than propped up on an excess of pillows on his bed – and said "I want to go home."
They didn't move and didn't say anything for a good few minutes. The post orgasmic haze left them both lethargic enough that they could actually sleep for the night. John hadn't made a move to pull out yet, and Sherlock enjoyed their intimate connection very much.
John couldn't speak, because if he did, it would have come out as a sob. So he gritted his teeth together and was thankful that Sherlock was the one to break the silence.
He kissed his lover lovingly, but also opened his mouth against him, knowing by now that hungry kisses turned the other man on. And then he started working on his cock expertly, his fist moving up and down with a constant rhythm. He hadn't touched another man since his army days, but he could still apply what he knew he liked on himself.
He covered Sherlock with one at a time. And almost immediately the detective curled up on his side, bunching the blanket in his hands as he drew it up to his neck like a cocoon. The expression of pain on his face, however, didn't go away.
"How are you feeling, love?" John asked, running a finger through Sherlock's curls, tucking a strand behind his ear.
"You obey, or I chop your dick off" his captor told him very matter-of-factly. "We no need it" and then he let go, Sherlock's entire body slumping in relief, even as his lower body still pulsed in pain from the grip.
Lestrade made a sympathetic face "He wasn't hit or anything. But yeah, he's gone tracking them down. You know how he is, 's like a bloodhound"
The cheekbones, partially hidden by a respirator, were more pronounced than they had ever been. The shape of the nose, of the lips, it was unmistakable- it was Sherlock.
"Hey, what are you doing up? You alright?" he asked again, and he was now standing just a foot away from the bed.
"Morning, love" John said as he heard the detective slowly walking out of the bedroom. "Here, come on." he closed the distance between them in quick steps and offered his arm for Sherlock to hold onto. "Bathroom first?"
The consulting detective could only wish she had met the same fate as Anderson – kicked out of the force and out of his way, but no.
John, closest as he was, didn't think twice before dashing head first into the dark figure and jumping on his legs. "I've got him!" he yelled, as he trapped the guy face down into the dirt, and the man's hands in a military grip.
Again the doctor cleared his throat and looked away "I wanted to try it, first. I wanted to- be prepared in case you- you wanted-"
"I know. I know, Mycroft told me. He told me about Moriarty's web, and about the snipers, and everything." John said and his hands were closed into fists. He looked like he was going to say something else, but then decided not to.
She stopped when she arrived at a picture that had obviously been taken at Christmas, and by a third party. The two men were dressed in absurd sweaters and were sharing a chaste kiss, the barest hint of a mistletoe peeking from the top of the frame.
The man nearest the door seemed to understand and he started gesturing and giving orders to the others. Sherlock had no idea what he said, but one of them left the room, only to come back with a chair.
Once he realized it, Sherlock's entire demeanor changed and he stood up sharply, leaving his mug behind and shoving his hands into his pockets. "Great, well, everybody's said their piece, now you can all leave." His voice was falsely courteous and his blank face left little room for an argument.
At the assent, he continued, but very, very, very slowly. It was nearly excruciating to do it like this, and John had no idea where he found the self-control for it, but he'd rather suffer than hurt his lover and undo months and months of progress.
"Shut up, John, you're rambling." Sherlock snapped, but there was no bite to it. He closed his eyes as well, just for a moment, before letting out a breath and looking down at his hands. "I had. Since the pool – I knew then." He explained "What I felt. I knew then that it wasn't just- that it was more than just friendship, for me."
, because she had thought it was a corpse. She had thought it was a corpse because that's exactly what it looked like.
And then Sherlock was off, walking down the main corridor while murmuring under his breath, just to walk back up again. And then he disappeared off towards the kitchen, not offering a word of explanation.
Some part of him still looked around and rattled off deductions in his head, still tried to think of ways to escape, still tried to think of how to get the upper hand.
"Alright, everybody ready?" Lestrade finally said, sounding tired and reluctant. No one was looking forward to seeing it.
When they woke that following morning, it felt like there was nothing standing between them anymore. They stared at each other instead of immediately moving to get up, and if Sherlock ever needed to define the word 'Home' with startling precision, this moment would have been it.
The wool coat fell behind him and he stepped to the side before kicking it across the floor towards her.
you planning to make an honest man out of me, Sherlock Holmes?" John prodded, as he moved on the bed so he was sat right next to his fiancé.
It was six in the morning when, finally, the exhausted detective felt his eyelids start drooping. He snuggled close to his army doctor, who was also half asleep, and hid his face into the man's neck. "When the case is done. We'll do it then."
John temporarily looked like a fish, opening his mouth to say something and closing it again over and over "Oh. I- that's, then, great- it's good. That's good." He cleared his throat and felt his heart attempt to leave his chest via his mouth. "Alright. Ok. Then. Yes."
She shook her head, but it was half-hearted. "If you're one of them, you're just going to bring more of you-"
"Mycroft, good evening! If you would be so kind as to uninvited yourself. You know where the door is." Sherlock said immediately, not even looking up.
The request was a bit confusing, but John planned to figure out the ambiguity by trial and error. Slowly, so that Sherlock could still change his mind if he wanted to, he slid his hand down his lover's side almost teasingly. Even clothed as he was, the detective shivered under his touch.
"Ok, what? What are we talking about?" John, of course, had gotten up from his chair and was now standing behind his lover with a very deep frown on his face.
"No, John. I will go into spontaneous combustion the minute you set foot outside the door" Sherlock responded, and it made him smile that his friend was starting to sound like his old self, but John also wondered if he was just putting on a brave face.
The question brought just a bit of blood back into John's head as he processed the information "I- ah, actually…" he murmured and then he got off Sherlock and the bed.
John had sat and listened for hours as the notes came out, completely garbled, a shadow of the song they had once been. It was painful to listen, and not because the notes were wrong, but because of the pained expression on Sherlock's face.
There were roughly twenty different men stationed on the base, granted they weren't ever there at the same time, but Sherlock got to know every single one of them. They would come in in turns every couple of hours during the day, and usually there were two to three visits for the ones on night shift.
John couldn't stop looking at the wound he had just bandaged, much as he couldn't stop replaying Sherlock's words over and over again in his head. He nodded if for no reason other than he wanted his friend to know he'd heard everything; that he understood.
She had to wait for him to go back to sleep to continue, because he wouldn't let her near him. Fortunately, it did not take very long and she was finished a half hour later, leaving to allow Dr. Watson back in.
John was clenching his fists and looking away, positively trembling with the effort to stand there and listen.
When he took too long to answer, the detective took it as acquiescence and slowly started unbuttoning his jeans.
They didn't exactly coordinate it, but that night – their second night back in the flat – Sherlock slept on his back, tucked up against the wall while John slept on his side, completely flush against the detective's body.
Sherlock became a writhing mess under him. He had a hand thrown over his eyes, his head facing off to the side and his teeth digging into his lips. His moans were throaty and breathy and nothing close to words escaped him.
As soon as they were out of sight, Greg groaned in frustration and turned to look at his befuddled team. "Are you happy now?!" he barked at Donovan, dropping his files angrily onto the table.
Mrs. Hudson's grand entry was not as subdued. The woman shrieked, passed out, yelled at both of them and then passive aggressively offered to make them dinner that night.
"If I was one of them, why would I need to tell the others where I am? Wouldn't they already know their own hiding place?"
In fact, the doctor in him understood much more from the words 'internal damage' than he had at first.
The implication was there, but it had been almost two years since their relationship started and Sherlock had never shown any hint that he wanted to cross that particular line. It was reasonable to be unsure of it.
"God" he breathed out once he finally felt Sherlock's thighs under his arse. His hands were trembling on the detective's stomach as he held on for support. He was trying to stay as still as he could, because any movement would pull at him very uncomfortably.
There was absolutely no build up to it, someone simply pulled his trousers down, spit onto their hand and then there was a cock being pushed into him and a groan echoing in the room.
"You think this is funny, don't you?" He asked, and he was riling himself up pretty quick, so he just turned around and went towards his own chair, but didn't sit down. "Should have saved yourself the trip" he said, and it was a dismissal if ever Sherlock had heard one.
Most of the men had had their penis chopped off, most likely while still alive, and it was a glaringly obvious statement. It was a punishment fit for the crime and Sherlock's hands trembled because he didn't want John to know.
"Why do you harbor this delusional notion that I have any control over Sherlock Holmes?" the man demanded, and his voice was still level, but very, very serious. "I didn't have control over him when he became a drug addict at eighteen and I don't have control over him now. He was going to track down Moriarty's network with or without my help, and I could either join him or wait at home for the body bag. So I did. What. I. Could." He enunciated each word, and every inch he had on John was now clearly delineated as he towered over the shorter man.
After the whole thing was done and the media blinded John and Sherlock with their excessive flashes, both men were subtlety escorted out of the room by Lestrade.
She was face up, arm visibly twisted and skin littered with bruises. There were several scars on her legs, but almost no trace of blood anywhere. The body had been in the river for quite some time before being fished out – it looked blue and swollen.
"You're having a panic attack, you're not going to die." She told him very clearly, and then gestured to her own chest, before she breathed in slowly "You're going to breathe with me, ok? We're going to count together." And she stood there with him until he calmed down after twenty three long inhales-and-exhales.
He admitted to having disposed of the bodies, but refused to talk about his accomplices or about where they had kept the women.
"No. No, you're not. You're not." The doctor agreed, immediately, matter-of-factly. "You, Sherlock Holmes, are the strongest, bravest, most brilliant man I have ever met."
Lestrade gave him a side look but sighed "But there are no signs a murder was committed inside the house. Or outside, for that matter."
Greg still lingered for a bit, even had some coffee with them, but then he had to go back to the Yard and he left with the promise that John and he were going to catch up over a pint very soon.
With his heart beating in his throat he leaned forward, almost on his tiptoes, and closed the distance between them; his lips pressing ever so softly, chastely, against his flatmate's. It was the culmination of years' worth of waiting, of hundreds of unspoken words and missed opportunities, and yet it did not hold any of that weight- it was light as a feather and it filled both men with a sense of peace.
"I've made arrangements for your commute, you may remain in London or make use of a flat twenty minutes off and I've assigned a driver-" the man went on, but John ignored him. He wasn't leaving this hospital room. He wasn't leaving this hospital period, unless it was with Sherlock by his side. He hoped Mycroft hadn't paid rent in advance.
"What's that?" the doctor asked, unconsciously licking his lips as he stared at his partner's mouth.
It was a bit awkward, for both of them kept their hands firmly and stiffly by their sides, unmoving; Sherlock still holding onto the IV stand for support. But the skies were still blue and John was still there and he could feel the warmth of his body and he wouldn't change a thing about it. This is who they were- stilted, grown Englishmen with the emotional maturity of a tea kettle, but at least they were navigating this new thing together- they'd figure it out in their own time.
Amanda was shaking, her blue eyes completely bloodshot, but there was a slight glimmer of hope in them. She wanted to believe him.
Sherlock sat by the window, and it was equal parts refreshing and intimidating to watch as the scenery went by and he took in the outside world for the first time in forever. He looked a bit nervous, bundled up in a dressing gown over hospital clothes – he hadn't bothered to change and they were comfortable and familiar.
"He wasn't in on it as in, he didn't rape them." Sherlock clarified, like it should have been obvious. "He's not part of the group. Probably paid off to disappear with the bodies, no questions asked." He narrowed his eyes. "He's willing to go to jail for them, but why would he? They either have something on him or on someone close to him – a drug tab, most likely. He's a user, but a casual one, so he's taking the fall for someone else – his sister, probably, did you see the tattoo? He's got strong incentive, so don't bother, he's not going to give you anything. His shoes, on the other hand…" he trailed off and was already heading towards the evidence room.
The DI started almost comically, stopping in his tracks as to not run the doctor over. "John!" he said as he exhaled.
"That's exactly what I'm worried he'll do" Sherlock heard her say, but it was very faint since they had already started to walk away.
"I shouldn't have said those things about you. I'm sorry." She said, straight to the point. Despite her cool demeanor, it was very clear her words were sincere and unprompted.
He closed his eyes shut with force and tightened his hands into fists. Trying to put two years' worth of misery into spoken language was a ridiculously difficult task.
He spent that night thinking, looking at John's sleeping face, memorizing his features and internalizing how much this man trusted him, loved him. If he told John to jump, he'd just ask how high. His lover was willing to lay himself bare and be completely vulnerable in front of him- it was actually touching.
The words were barely out of his mouth and a whirlwind of consulting detective was swishing past him to go and get dressed for their trip to the Yard.
There was a lot of rapid Serbian being spoken and he could only catch certain key words here and there, but he could tell they were terribly pleased with themselves.
He made for the hallway, but stopped long enough to nod towards the army doctor "Good to see you, John." And then he was out, letting the door close behind himself.
John didn't even think, he just placed the chart on top of the nearest surface and followed Mycroft Holmes like a drowning man in search of air.
"I can arrange for a nurse to come in at least for a few hours each day" Mycroft started once they had gone over Sherlock's case and the Doctor seemed opened to discharging him.
"Lestrade, I need to be alone, get your sniffer dogs out of here, please." He ordered matter-of-factly. It was a request he'd made countless times before, unlikely to rouse any suspicions.
The fact that John had confessed his feelings for him – had that actually happened? – only seemed to make things harder. It felt like he was handing John something broken.
He stopped just before opening it and said "If you- need anything…" the offer was left open, but it was another clear gesture of brotherly love, and Sherlock had the mind to nod in acknowledgement even if he couldn't bring himself to say thank you. "You might want to put those away." Mycroft gestured to the envelope, and then left the room.
That was the closest Mycroft would ever come to expressing his brotherly love, and the words soothed Sherlock like nothing else. He closed his eyes and breathed out slowly, nodding.
But things only got better and better. Sherlock didn't leave the flat, but he was always up and about, doing his experiments, solving crimes remotely and watching crap telly. He took cases online, now, two and threes that he solved with a simple email reply, or six and sevens that he spent days pouring over. The fact he couldn't exam the crime scenes himself actually added an extra layer of challenge, and Sherlock made it his goal to see each and every one of them to its conclusion.
Sherlock, who was still lying on his back, only had to give it a second's thought before he answered "Like this. I want to look at you."
He lay back down on the floor; he didn't have a cot, but he did have a dirty, thin blanket which right now was the single most comforting thing he could ask for. He wrapped it around himself like a cocoon and lay on his side, trying to ignore the persistent pulsing pain coming from his abused backside.
She lifted her hand toward it, almost as if she had forgotten about it. "Yeah, I got it cut. Needed a change, you know?"
Sherlock himself pulled on his trousers a bit so they would ride down just enough that John could have slightly better access.
"What?" he asked when he finally managed to speak again. He was holding onto the check-in counter for dear life as he didn't trust himself not to fall otherwise. "What did you- what are- what?"
"What are you grinning about, I'm still making you apologize" he told her very pointedly, running a hand up and down his short hair.
Still, the word washed over Sherlock like a balm to his soul and he closed his eyes to savor them, to savor that they had finally made it.
But his doctor was raising one hand to stop him mid-sentence. "Sherlock, did you even hear what Greg said?" he asked, his expression serious "I'm glad this isn't some kind of crazy scheme of Moriarty's from beyond the grave- that's great. But that's really not what I'm focusing on right now."
His nightmares ranged from Moriarty being back to life, to John being killed by a sniper, to John being pushed off the roof of St. Bart's, to Sherlock being forced back into Serbia, to his actual time in Serbia and-
"Sherlock?" John prodded, looking over his shoulders as if to check that no one was paying them any mind.
John had thought that they had already reached their peak; that there was nowhere else to climb. And yet, it seemed Sherlock was constantly determined to prove him wrong. Their love for each other grew, and grew, and grew, defying all odds that it could possibly grow anymore. And, sometimes, that love would manifest in shows of trust, of giving.
Her chin trembled a bit and her eyes stung again at the prospect of this man really being her rescuer.
He didn't even see where they got it, but suddenly Leader had a piece of wood that looked like the broken leg of a chair and only beat Sherlock with it once before he nudged him onto his back with it.
"The first three weeks or so I spent there, it was interrogations only" He was looking down at his hands, flexing the fingers that were still there, while alluding to the ones that weren't "But after they got the information out of Robinson, I was no longer an asset. So the last three months I spent there… it was every day. They would- they would just come in and" he deliberately stopped the phrase there, because he still couldn't speak the words. He wondered if he'd ever be able to.
The policeman only vaguely registered the scene as odd, frowning at John's potentially naked form before nodding at him in greeting. "Yeah, but listen. I need you to come to the Yard. We have a video, now." He was looking specifically at Sherlock again. "We might be able to get to our current victim in time. No body yet, we think they still have her."
"Ok, ok! To the side, now, come on." He urged immediately, trying to move his friend enough that the worst of the vomiting landed on the floor.
"Dr. Watson" a voice called out evenly and John felt an odd, prickling sensation in his skin- he knew this voice.
She checked his lungs, his airways and moved him this or that way, but there was nothing wrong and yet he was still gasping wildly for air. It was his eyes, his terror-filled eyes that gave it away and she put a hand on his shoulder comfortingly and tried to get him to look at her.
This wasn't so bad, he decided after a minute. It hurt, and it burned, but losing his fingers had hurt much more; even the whipping to his back- that had been the worst. This was- it was just- he didn't need to attach a separate meaning to it simply because it was sexual. So what if it was? Pain was pain was pain. And as far as pain went, this didn't rate that high on the scale. He was fine. This was fine.
When his phone buzzed he was drinking his morning coffee and carefully scanning his emails. Surely there had to be something here above a six? Above a five? He was on the verge of taking a four at this point, honestly.
And then he realized it'd be the first time Sherlock would be left alone in the room. Well, aside from John's little stunt yesterday, but that had hardly been premeditated. So he couldn't help but hesitate at touching the door knob.
He was dragged kicking and screaming back to his cell, the sting of frustration and almosts and what-ifs suffocating him. Leader had walked in with the other men, this time – he wasn't usually at the base – and he looked murderous.
Lestrade was looking at him like he was crazy. And Donovan, who had just returned with a report from the outside team, had her nose scrunched up as she stared at him up and down. "What's wrong with him?" she asked.
John had to laugh at that, burying his face momentarily in his partner's neck. "Well, I'm glad you do." He said, kissing whatever part of him was closer.
Sherlock shook his head and was still holding the pictures face down on his lap without knowing what to do.
"What you see is the result of the Serbians' hospitality." Mycroft went on, gesturing to the tablet. "He has been back in England for a week, now. I was waiting for him to stabilize before attempting to contact you." That the possibility of Sherlock dying on the table had been very real went unspoken. "I'm afraid he sustained a rather extensive list of injuries- some of which are not of the physical variety." His voice sounded contrite again and John wanted to sob in frustration at the information.
The next couple of weeks went by excruciatingly slow and unchanging. Men would come in, fuck him, sometimes his mouth, then they'd walk out. He would eat, and sleep and get fucked again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
"I like this" Sherlock said, afterwards. And it was the same tone of voice he'd have used to declare the results of an experiment.
The ride home was silent, but filled with a very physical Sherlock. He had removed both his gloves, despite rarely doing so in public, and held John's hand between his. All the while keeping his head on the shorter man's shoulder and his eyes closed as they made their way to Baker Street.
Sherlock didn't really understand what John wanted him to do until the doctor pulled him close by the shirt and kissed him, slow and sensuous. He didn't stop kissing him, but the detective felt rhythmic movements start and realized that John had started jerking himself off slowly.
"Sherlock- maybe this was just a detour. Maybe they killed her outside somewhere?" he offered a bit tiredly. Honestly he was getting dizzy just watching the taller man move.
"John, I'm, I can't-" and then the younger man half groaned and half cried, quickly switching hands so he could stroke himself with his left and hold John's hips with his right. John let him do as he wished, and Sherlock essentially held him in place and fucked himself back onto him, rolling his hips so he could get extra friction to his prostate.
Fingers ran through Sherlock's hair, keeping some of his curls away from his face so they wouldn't get caught in the mess. He dry heaved a few more times, still holding onto the doctor, and then his body finally stopped spasming enough that he could lift his head and wipe his mouth with his ungloved hand.
And then someone was saying something about… something or other; they'd stopped paying attention. They stared at each other like mesmerized children, and were only snapped out of their trance when they heard:
Hands now clawed at the welts on his back as a strangled noise of release echoed in the room. He felt a hot, sticky substance being shot inside of him and he started going through all the possible STDs he could have just been infected with when he remembered that it didn't matter- corpses needn't worry about diseases.
Less afraid, John started to thrust in harder instead of faster, driving himself in all the way before pulling out.
John let it go and gave the whole thing up as a lost cause. He started finding things to do around the flat, instead. He taught himself how to cook – he was actually rather good at it now – he grew plants under the smiley face graffiti and he jogged every afternoon while Sherlock had tea with Mrs. Hudson. Well, she sat there having tea and talking while he pretended to ignore her and continued doing whatever he'd been doing before she came in.
But Sherlock saw the slight flinch on his lover's face as the man moved to sit up, and he put a hand over John's and shook his head "I'll go" he offered, but then didn't move at all. He was staring at the doctor intently, and it was clear to John that his detective was trying to assess the damage.
He actually left the hospital building and hid on the steps near bushes so he could let it all out unbidden. He cried again, like he had when Sherlock had died, like he had when he saw the man's mutilated hands. He cried with his hands over his mouth and snot running down his face because god- it hurt.
"Well I'm glad you like it, because it's being brought over to your flat as we speak." The DI added, breaking the tension a little bit.
And then he stared at the finished product, blinked twice, and then proceeded to push John onto their bed and undo the entire work by opening his trousers and devouring him down like a man starving.
Sherlock didn't say anything. He kept his hand on John's own as he leaned a bit so he could rest his forehead against the cool tiles of the bath. His back was still flush with his lover's chest as he pulled him closer, and John went with very little resistance.
And indeed, unlike his prolonged torture sections, this was quick and to the point. The man finished, zipped himself up again and left without as much as a word.
"Sir, we've run him through the system, no matches." The mousey boy said, fumbling with his papers like he needed a cheat sheet to report to Lestrade. "We're trying to get a match on the samples we took from the body-"
"There has to be something we're missing!" he yelled in frustration, walking a hole into the carpet as he moved up and down. "This is the perfect house for a murder!"
When they did reach the bathroom, however, things changed rather drastically. The memories of the painful, painful, painful trips to the toilet back in Serbia were very fresh in his head and he shut his eyes forcefully as he tried to chase them away. But it was fear like he couldn't explain, irrational, overwhelming, of the same kind that made him refuse the food he'd been offered.
, but he also thought about their bed and the other positions it allowed for. Here, in the living room, Sherlock had pretty much no choice but to kneel in front of John if he wanted to suck him off. But on their bed, he could spread the other man down, hover over him and-
But he learned to let it go- Sherlock had been tortured and starved, and that was that. Finding out exactly what the torture had entailed would only serve to soothe John's curiosity. It wasn't going to undo the damage and it wasn't going to help the detective.
One day, Molly came over to deliver fresh body parts as per Sherlock's insistence. She cried and hugged him, but John later found out that she had known about the whole faking-his-death thing, and he couldn't help but brood the rest of the day.
Sherlock was stopped, looking at him like he didn't understand English. He was just staring and staring, for a really long time. Maybe he was having an inner conversation? But it really was taking long, and John started looking at him questioningly, wondering if he should get up and go fetch a nurse.
"Wow" came the low exclamation when John saw the first body, it was a subdued type of approval, but it was approval nonetheless.
And then the pounding on the door resumed and the detective yelled out in frustration, before jumping off the bed, pulling his pajamas and dressing gown on before slamming the door to their bedroom open. "Someone had better be dying!" he shouted towards the living room, to John's amusement.
"Sherlock," John started, smiling like a fool "You are… the most infuriating, brilliant, brave man that I have ever known. I am- I am honestly… astounded by your strength and your courage and your selflessness." He chuckled, because most people would probably never understand that last one. "And every day that you let me be by your side- I am so incredibly humbled by your trust in me. I was so alone before I met you and I- I owe you so much. I owe you everything. And I am so incredibly thankful to be standing here today and sharing the best day of my life with the love of my life."
It was the hand that only had three fingers and there was something symbolic about holding it so gently. Sherlock looked at him, having been pulled from his musings and allowed himself to bask in the touch. He stopped himself from kissing John as it would be too much – he couldn't do it in front of his brother.
He didn't have a sleep pattern anymore. He – tried to – sleep when they weren't there, woke up when they fucked him, went back to sleep and rinse and repeat.
When he turned and saw the hesitance on Sherlock's face, he frowned. Something was off. He opened his mouth, about to ask what it was, but his lover looked away.
There was silence in the room for the next few minutes as John looked at the pictures again, and again and again. His eyes glued to them because he couldn't look anywhere else. His eyes were watering and his throat was closing and he didn't want to break down in front of Sherlock and just make it all worse.
"I brought breakfast, if you feel so inclined" Mycroft told him when he'd left the bathroom with his teeth brushed, hair combed and a fresh set of clothes on.
It got to the point where he was working himself into a full blown panic when he felt the need coming on, and a week after the ordeal with the wooden leg, he couldn't bring himself to eat anymore.
John had already given up and was sat on one of the comfy chairs in the living room, watching as his lover paced.
When Sherlock seemed to be done, John slowly leaned him back onto his pillows, but not before propping the bed up. The last thing he wanted was for the younger man to choke on his own vomit if he started again.
He spent most of his day reading and doing the crosswords on the paper. Sometimes he'd put his chair by the window so he could enjoy the sunny skies and nature – one would think they had left England, the weather was so good these days.
"Why? Sherlock, they're… there isn't a reason for these things. People do it because… " John couldn't find the words to say that rapists raped because they simply did.
"Do you see! These are all consistent with underground facilities, and I knew it had to be industrial storage- it's clearly not a basement. I showed you these marks before, the light had to swing on the ceiling, that's why the wire is falling out in this exact pattern. But we have those windows on top and they don't lead to the outside- it's concrete and-"
Sherlock brushed his hand slightly against the shorter man's and they both had smiles on their faces when they dug into their beans on toast.
"Well maybe you should start to" was the immediate, but almost inaudible reply that came through the young genius' gritted teeth.
He twirled around sharply and held out the boots in his hands. "If you'll excuse me, I need a lab." Another one of his punctuation smiles. "Come, John."
Sherlock was asleep by the time he got back, so he went to his couch, lay down and tried to sleep, but failed miserably for hours.
"Please. I- I just-" he tried to bargain with another unmoved captor, but then he got onto his knees and voluntarily moved closer to the man, even before he was ordered. "I'll use my mouth, please, let me-" his hands were shaking, still free from his stunt yesterday, and he reached for the guy's trousers with urgency. The man almost moved to stop him, but once he realized what Sherlock was doing he allowed it.
Things started to blur and he started forgetting; he knew he had been waiting- for someone? Something? But it was all foggy and unclear. He would wake up naked and cold and he couldn't remember how he had gotten there or where he was.
The doctor immediately stiffened and he broke their kiss, bucking backwards like he'd just been burned.
The long slender hands hovered over the waistband of his trousers - he wasn't wearing any pants, and for a moment he wondered if he should say something about it. But then the detective was pulling his slacks down and John's neglected cock bobbed up, finally free from its confinement. He was so hard and so desperate that he groaned, because even the touch of the cool night air was stimulating.
He felt his back hit the wall as he tried to escape his racing mind. He didn't want the input from the scene anymore, he didn't want to be here.
Out of all the scenarios Sherlock had imagined when he first heard the gunshots, this one was probably the last on his list.
He had swallowed dryly at the question, his mind battling between the two evils, but had nodded in the end.
"I need you to come with me" the man said, finally, inclining his head. "I require your assistance."
But Sherlock glanced at him and then back at the woman, before nodding towards Lestrade. "You go ahead, John. I'll be right there."
At John's behest, and Mummy's enthusiastic agreement, they got married in a church. At Sherlock's behest, and with absolutely no opposition, John got married in his army dress uniform.
They fell onto the couch in a tangle of limbs and Sherlock discarded his gloves along the way – Mycroft had simply showed up one day and handed him a box containing designer leather gloves; they fit him like they'd been made for him, which granted, they probably had. Every time the detective went out, he'd wear them. And while four of the fingers either didn't move or were empty, no one would notice if they weren't staring fixedly at his hands.
He searched the detective's eyes for answers – afraid, so afraid, that Sherlock was only doing this because he thought he owed it to John – but the man simply looked earnest; curious?
"Fine. Yes it is, are you happy now?" the detective finally got up from John's chair and then closed his dressing gown with more force than was probably necessary.
He kept the time by watching the tiny holes near the ceiling, where a bit of light shone through; he'd been here for three weeks now.
And as he felt the warmth of John's fingers cradling his hands before their friends and family, as he looked down into those beautiful blue eyes, his uncertainties shrunk into nothingness.
There were more people roaming the halls of the hospital than Sherlock had initially expected, and though he tried to hide it the best he could, John recognized his erratic breathing pattern and panicked looks almost instantly.
"I believe I shall go fetch Doctor Watson now, then; he starts brooding rather glaringly when he's made to wait outside." His brother said as he got up and grabbed his umbrella, heading for the door.
For the first couple of seconds, John frowned the tiniest bit, not understanding the question; they were literally touching from shoulder to feet. When the meaning downed on him he felt his heart skip and his cock twitch at the same time.
"That's it! That's it, John!" he exclaimed, pulling his chair out and sitting down. "You're brilliant!"
"I'm really glad you hadn't done your hair yet." John, flush-faced and panting, said, because his lover's curls were pointing out in all odd angles from his grip.
"Alright. So just- let me clean this up and I'll be right back. Even a cab won't pick us up looking like this." John gestured to his trousers.
John was positively fidgeting, but he discretely placed his hand on Sherlock's back and ran it up and down soothingly. He was trying to offer his lover support, but honestly needed the connection just as much.
Sherlock was pale, his jaw was tense, his hands closed into fists and John could already tell he wasn't breathing as smoothly as he should. It wasn't enough to intervene yet, but it was clear the detective was struggling to keep his eyes on the screen.
"You'd think they'd try and cover her mouth. Even in a secluded area, that much noise…" It was Donovan speaking. If anything, she was trying to lessen the mood somehow with her comment; no one had spoken in minutes and the air in the room had grown heavy and thick with tension.
They pulled away quietly, John barely able to look Sherlock in the eye "Is this- is this ok?" he asked almost in a whisper, very conscious of this extremely fragile thing growing between them. He had no idea how far the detective's ban on physical intimacy went and he didn't want to destroy this.
He half expected Sherlock to shrug his worries off completely, but the detective just looked away for a moment, before nodding. "I know."
But he nodded, glancing towards the door beyond which his friend waited to be allowed back in. He could do this, they could do this together.
"Do you want me to touch you?" he asked softly, trying to refer back to his previous strategy of getting the detective out of his own head.
He walked up and into the woman's personal space to the point that Lestrade readied himself to jump in between them.
"Ta" John nodded, and looked nervously towards Sherlock for a moment, before sitting down at the wooden table to eat. Granted, the food had gone cold by now, but it was still much better than what they had at the hospital's canteen.
He never touched the keypad, for when he was about to, one of his captors spotted him and then there was a lot of yelling and movement.
"You tell me to stop, any time, any reason and I will, ok?" the soldier reassured, his eyes serious, but his expression loving as it always was.
Sherlock didn't really open his eyes so he was probably just moving in his sleep. It still drew John's attention every time, no matter how insignificant a movement his friend made. The stirring persisted for longer than usual, though. And then, still with his eyes closed, the detective started coughing.
Both their breaths were growing rapid, and Sherlock felt himself grow hard in his pants from watching his lover. It was every bit as erotic as he had imagined, and he licked his lip unconsciously.
The way they were positioned now, Sherlock towered over John even as his mouth hovered over the man's half hard cock. He was lying down comfortably in his own bed, propped up on his elbows, instead of kneeling on a hard floor. His own cock was nestled warmly against the mattress, pulsing ever so slightly, making Sherlock rock his hips the tiniest bit as he enjoyed the friction. It was a much better situation.
Sherlock closed his eyes and rubbed at his face forcefully. "I don't know! Yes! No, I don't know- that's what I'm trying to say- I don't know if I can trust myself with this."
In an attempt to get some information- any information on Sherlock's case, John tried to ask the doctor in charge, once, why they were feeding Sherlock through an IV rather than the less damaging feeding tube. He knew very well that the former was used in cases where that was damage to the digestive track. The doctor had simply told him it was the best approach for this case, and did not elaborate further.
Seeing John looking so worried about him, with his hair all mussed up and his reddened lips from kissing, and the flushed tint to his cheeks- this was John. This was his John, the man he loved, the man who loved him. He'd made John feel good, and he had been enjoying the experience right until it was interrupted by his dark thoughts.
"Homicide, multiple suspects, most likely a group effort" he rattled off. He knew the easiest way to lie was to tell the truth while omitting facts.
Their relationship had him on edge all the time; it was like being a teenager all over again. Sherlock only had to look at him with those piercing pale eyes of his and John would be wrapped around his little finger.
Clearing his throat a bit, he let his hand slowly travel down his own body and his fingers ghost ever so lightly over his clothed erection.
The lube warmed up and by the time John experimentally dipped the tip of his finger into him, his lover was already completely relaxed.
"Yeah, you would know, freak." Donovan bit back, annoyed "You get off on it" she added under her breath, but the room was small enough that everyone heard it.
The cock was shoved into his mouth with a distinct lack of finesse as it hit the back of his throat in its first go. The following thrusts were more shallow, but equally erratic. He had no idea what to do, he had never done this before, so he just tried to stay still despite his position and take it as well as he could.
"I can't breathe" he told her at the threshold, unable to step into the bathroom. "I- I can't breathe- I can't- I- I'm going to die-"
Sherlock looked down, like he was gathering his thoughts, and for a moment John remember that first case years ago. The detective had made that same face when he'd tried to figure out how to best turn John's advances down.
They both stood there having a staring contest, neither willing to back down. Eventually, Sherlock growled in frustration again and spun away, going to stand by the window before turning back sharply.
When he did not stir, the man crouched in front of him and patted his face with just enough force that he'd be roused from his supposed sleep.
His bandages came off a few days later, no longer needed aside from the ones on his torso. It was the first time John saw his feet and his hands properly and that night, when he thought Sherlock was asleep, he had locked himself in the bathroom and cried like he hadn't since Sherlock had died.
Once he was fully in, he stopped, panting and focusing very hard on not coming right then and there. He was painfully hard and it felt unbelievably amazing to be inside Sherlock. It was hot and tight and slick and wonderful, but it was also, simply, Sherlock.
"Can't have that" John smiled, shaking his head again. "Sherlock Holmes, with the mind that's like an engine, a train racing out of control, trapped on the launch pad!" he teased, echoing the words his lover had said on many occasions.
It was a not-so-small, beautiful ceremony, compromised of their friends, family and a bright spring day.
John was the one to groan angrily at the noise and finally give up on sleep. "I'll get it" he bit out, grumpy as he had all rights to be.
John was about to protest that he had no interest in fresh air or tea when he realized he was being politely asked to get out. Sighing, he hesitated for a couple of seconds, but just got up from his chair and nodded to the both of them before leaving the room. Might as well take a walk.
But all it took was the time for him to go inside the room to fetch a glass of water for things to turn sour. When he returned, it was to find Sherlock in the middle of a panic attack. He nearly dropped the glass in his haste to get to the man.
As the afternoon grew into evening, the question of sleeping arrangements came into play. It made itself known in the tension that grew between them – well, the tension was more akin to anticipation, at this point.
Sherlock's fingers curled softly around John's and the doctor couldn't help but lean down to press a kiss to the back of his lover's hand as well as bump their noses together, stealing a kiss that ended in a shared smile.
"I want to." Sherlock said; it wasn't a tense, determined voice. It was a light, simple statement of fact.
The doctor kissed his damp curls and slowly removed his fingers from inside him, not bothering to clean them as he applied more lube onto them and wrapped a hand around himself. He didn't need to stroke his cock any further or get himself any harder, but he wanted to make sure he'd be slick enough to enter his lover smoothly.
The door to his cell opened hours into it, the smell of cigarette smoke being let in and he almost asked for one, himself. He saw four of his captors file in, all chatting animatedly in Serbian. He didn't catch much of what they were saying, but thought they were discussing something trivial, like a game on the telly.
It was an attempt at casualness that came out as unnatural as small talk was between them, but she was trying.
"Oh?" the doctor was coming over with his own cup of tea now, and he sat down on his chair before nodding towards the laptop. "Any luck with the emails?"
In the back of his mind, Sherlock registered that this was the first time John had come out to someone about their relationship or the implications thereof on his sexuality. He wasn't sure if what he felt at that was pride, but it was something akin to it.
He glanced towards the door, beyond which lay the man who stuck with him through it all, through thick and thin and death and back. Then he looked back at her hopeful, frightened face and smiled.
Before he could think much about it, he raised a hand and ran his fingers across the locks; it's something he'd always wanted to do. Sherlock looked at him questioningly, but just smiled. And then he leaned over ever so slightly, the detective meeting him halfway in a kiss that tasted like eggs and butter.
Inside there were twenty-one pictures of twenty-one corpses, each mangled in varying degrees of creativity.
Completely thrown by the conclusion, John even sat up a bit to look down at his lover with an even deeper frown. "What are you talking about?"
John shot the whole thing back in one go and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, ignoring the look of distaste on the other man's face.
