Steve shook his head, but he was still smiling.  “Tony-”
He was tired.  So tired.  The act of drawing the noodles up on the tines of the fork was almost more than he could manage.  The first bite took everything he had, just to manage it.  He let his eyes slide shut again, focusing on the act of chewing, of swallowing,
“Yes, he is.”  Sue took a seat across from Tony.  “Let me bring Franklin and Val over.  Playdate.”
Bruce looked at Steve, who shrugged, helpless.  Bruce took a deep breath.  “Yes,” he said, with unexpected firmness.  “I would.”  He strode into the kitchen, his shoulders squared.  “Or, you know, a plant?  Plants…” He blinked rapidly behind the lenses of his glasses.  “A plant would be nice.”
“I want you to consider this as a tithe from a worshipper,” Harris said, “rather than the sort of indignity that would cause you to consume my soul or perhaps one of my legs.”
“I’m considering crying in public is what I’m considering.”  She braced a hand on the end of the pew.  “I work for a 24 hour wedding chapel in Vegas, you really think I’m not already knee deep in the mystic arts?”
There was a moment of silence, then Tony said, “So you’re looking at this wrong, botbrain.  You’re not the reason for the fight.  You’re the reward.  Every time we have a…  Creative disagreement-”
“Then by the power vested in me by the state of Nevada, you may kiss each other,” Elvis said, and it came just a little too late.  Steve didn’t know if he’d moved first, or if Tony had, or maybe, knowing them, they’d both jumped the gun, but by the time she said it, they were already doing it.
Wanda reached for a cookie.  “It’s a long story.”  She took a bite.  “I think that we really need everyone, if you’re going to-”
“Still no sign?” Bruce asked Natasha.
It was quick, almost chaste, his lips ghosting over Steve's, both of them unnaturally still, as if they knew it wasn't going to last.  It shouldn't last, after all.  It wasn't real.
Steve exhaled.  “Did I ask?”
“You can fight Jess for them,” Tony said.  “And I'll buy you a fresh box of cannoli.”
“Tony.”  Steve shook his head.  “I have to do it on Friday, and you're booked up for all your seatings all weekend, and you have two catering events.  You have enough problems without wasting Friday morning dealing with primer.”
Tony reached for his coffee cup.  “To recap.  Chefs of New York.  Stop being fucking lazy.  Diners of New York. Stop being fucking racist.”  He saluted the camera with his cup.  “And we’ll all get fat and happy and probably die of clogged arteries because goddamn, kale is still fucking nasty and if I hear the word ‘superfood’ one more fucking time I’m going to clock someone in the back of the head with a frying pan, Bugs Bunny style.
Steve paused, his expression very disapproving.  “Tony-”
Steve was already shaking his head.  “Thanks, but not today.” He pushed himself to his feet.  “I’ll get out of the way so you can change and-”
Moments later, Steve heard the traditional wedding processional start up, and he smiled down at the certificate.  “Are we ready?” Tony asked Steve, as Steve signed his name, as carefully as he’d ever signed anything in his life.
DJ’s mouth worked.  “I can’t,” he managed.
“Oh.  Right.  His driver.”  Steve took a step back, waving Hogan through the door.  “Come in.  I-”  He shook his head.  “Is there a problem?”
“Please,” he said, and DJ gave an approving nod before twisting around to look at Steve.
“At this point, any more input will likely just confuse me,” he said, taking a drink of his coffee.  The heavy bite of whiskey hit hard, and he coughed, his head snapping back.
“No trouble at all, sir,” Jarvis said, his voice calm.  To DJ he added, “Shall we make lemonade?”
“I am,” Steve admitted.  “Could stand a little less of it, though, to be honest.”
Jarvis nodded.  “Why not?”
“Speaking of wearing pants, is Sam hungover?” Tony asked.
“Not our Tony,” Harris reiterated.  His mouth went tight.  “Oh, God, we have a Tony.  There’s one.  I mean.” He rubbed his forehead.  “There’s more than one, I have personally spoken to two of them, there’s at least two, oh dear God-”
Steve grinned.  “Yes, you do.”
"A SECOND-"
Val was out of the car almost before it stopped moving, running for the door as soon as her feet hit the ground.  “Hi!” she said, sliding through the door.  “We're here!”
“Have a good night, Mr. Stark,” she replied, and even though he couldn’t see it, he could hear the smile in her voice.
“I am fine with Hill,” Tony said.
He reached up, and rang the bells.  Tony’s head swung in his direction, a curious look on his face.
“Eight pm,” Tony said.  The same time he always called.  Regular as clockwork.  The one appointment he never missed.  But he could hear the faint strain in DJ’s voice when he asked, when he looked for confirmation, and so he repeated it.  “Eight pm tomorrow.  Before bed.  But if you need me, when can you call me?”
Tony smiled back.  “I swear,” he said, his voice soft.  He moved his arm, and Furbro hopped into his lap, flopping down on his knees.  Tony barely seemed to notice.  “No matter what.  I’ll take care of him.”
“But he does.  He found a problem.  And he figured out how he could help.”  Steve tried to smile.  “I’ve seen those wish lists, Tony.  Socks and laundry detergent and winter boots.”  He took a deep breath.  “He used his money for something he believed in.  And next week, he’ll have another deposit to cover his expenses.”  He gestured at the tablet.  “What little expenses he has.”
“I do not believe either of you,” Tony said, but he picked up the lemonade.  “I've had a very hard day.  I had to pose for pictures, and then I was expelled from my workshop, and I had to climb up the trellis twice to retrieve an intruder-”
Steve stared at the wedding chapel.  It didn’t inspire confidence.  It could’ve used a coat of paint, at the bare minimum.  “We’re doing this,” he said, because yes.  This was absolutely what they were doing. “It’s better than a city hall wedding.”
Tony pointed at them.  “You two.  Not to be trusted.  Inherently untrustworthy.  I'm watching you.”  As Val giggled, and Franklin rolled his eyes, Tony looked at DJ.  “Check in.”
“We've got teams on the street behind you, ready for sweep up any stragglers,” Coulson said.
“Oh, absolutely.”  Isaiah’s cane tapped again, once, twice.  “I’m just not sure why, to be honest.”
Jarvis inclined his head.  “Of course, sir.”
Steve bit back a smile. “Looks like you did a good job.” He tucked a finger under DJ’s chin, tipping his head up.  “I’m sure that Nat was grateful for your help.”
“Well, yes, I'm always saying something,” Tony said, waving a hand through the air.  Sue leaned back against the workbench, her arms crossed over her chest, amused despite herself.  Tony was on a roll, and that was always amusing to her.
“Oh my God, it was ONE TIME and I was RIGHT,” Bucky yelled into the couch cushion.
“He’s good,” Clint said.
Billy leaned back, his elbows braced on the stairs behind him.  “The coat and hat were shabby and cheap,” he said.  “Shoes weren’t.  Take it from a former shoeshine boy, you can tell the ones with money by looking at their feet.  Rich man, he’ll wear a coat that’s falling apart at the seams, a hat that’s been run over by a horse cart.  But wearing ill-fitting or cheap shoes?  Makes your feet hurt. They’re cold, they leak, and no one will put up with wet socks if they don’t have to.
She covered her eyes with both hands.  “No.”
“Yes, and you can be diplomatic when you try,” Steve told him.  To Jan, he added, “Have we heard from Jean and Scott?”
"You invited me, and I have a plus one, my darling, you know I do," Miss Van Dyne said, letting DJ tumble onto the bed to bounce against Thor's side.  "You invited me, thus, you invited Hank."  She glanced at Steve.  "Hank's my fiance," she explained.  "And, despite his current temper tantrum, one of Tony's best friends."
“What?” Harris asked.
He looked back at his sauce.  “Cod,” he said, his head down.
Steve ran a spoon through the sauce, and Tony intercepted him.  “Stop licking my food,” he said, laughing as he took the spoon out of Steve’s hand.  “For heaven’s sake.”
Tony nodded, very slowly.  “Take your shirt off?”
She'd caught only the barest glimpse of movement, out of the corner of her eye, but she had instincts by now.  Instincts for small people who shouldn't be playing around large, dangerous pieces of equipment without supervision.  No matter what their father said.
The door to the dining room shut behind him, and Tony reached for his glass of water. “Did you fail?” he asked, his voice calm.
“Hey, hey, no.  No, Steve.  No, it’s not-  It’s not formal, it’s a holiday party, nobody’s coming in a tux.” Sam huffed out a breath.  “Why are you-”
DJ shook his head, and the bald man huffed out an exasperated breath.  “Just...  Pick him up,” he said to Stark, who gave him a look.
“Oh my GOD,” Sam called.  “You have to see the BATHROOM.”
Steve stilled, one foot braced on the bottom of the stairs, his hands still hovering in the air.  “Are you sure?” he asked, and he sounded torn.
“But you step up and be the one that they need,” Steve said.
“I mean, I would, but I’m stopping at In n’ Out on the way,” Clint said, tossing his bags on top of the rest of their luggage.  “I want a burger.”
Clea on the third floor glanced down a the Clea in the stairs.  “What did I think that would accomplish?” she asked, and went back to flipping through her book.  The pages appeared to be on fire.
Tony heaved a very put upon sigh.  “Is this song on repeat?”
"I'm fine," Tony bit out, and Steve was abruptly, suddenly done with this conversation.
Steve moved cautiously around her, ducking his head to clear the threshold.  “I suppose it will,” he said.
Tony tipped his head in her general direction, his eyes still locked on the screen, his mouth open wide.  Jan braced a fingertip against her cheek.  “Really,” she said, her voice flat.  “We’re really doing this?”
"Shut the door," Duck said, and Jesse shut the door. He looked back at Rogers. "Wanna stick around? That's the quickest I've ever gotten him to stop talking."
"Considering how many problems you have, his salary must be obscene by now."
Dummy’s support strut sank down, and he gave a pathetic little shake of his head.  “Okay.  Right.” Tony sighed, taking the file folder from Dummy’s claw.  “Fuck it.  Nothing gets done around here between Christmas and New Year’s, anyway.  Can you put those away?  You’ve got a diagnostic today.”
“Right!” The hint sailed over Hammer's head with about a foot and a half to spare, and he started fumbling in his own pockets. “Now, where did I put that ticket?”
Clint sighed.  “She’s right here, Tony.  She’s-”  A beat of silence, then, “There.  I’m holding her hand.  She’s right here.”
Callie peered around Clint, her fingers still locked on his vest.  “Is it...  Still there?” she asked, her voice shaking.
Rhodey looked over the top of the book at him, one eyebrow arched.  “How old are you again?” he asked.
DJ grinned up at him.  “Cookies!”
DJ looked at Steve.  “Do you want to  go watch a movie?” Steve asked, his thumb rubbing back and forth over the back of Tony’s hand.  “Bet we can find Star Wars.”
DJ’s stomach sank.  “You left him,” he said, and Steve fell silent.  DJ shook his head.  “Shouldn’t…  Shouldn’t do that.  He’s no good alone.  You know-” His throat worked.  “You know he’s no good alone, Steve.”  He tried to smile.  “That’s…  That’s why he made me.”
Steve shook his head. “You need to get dressed so we can go upstairs.” He tipped Tony's head up, brushing a kiss against his lips. “You promised to fulfill my fantasies. And I've got a major one about you. And your bedroom.”
“When this comes up later,” Steve said, his voice tense, “remember, you pulled it first.”
“More sense?” Tony repeated, as Rhodey picked up some chopsticks.  “More sense than WHAT?”
“Yeah, she’s a peach, and what the fuck did she put on me?” Tony asked, already knowing and dreading the answer.
“TONY!”
Leaving him to scrub the plates clean, Steve headed to the small shared bathroom at the far end of the hall.  He could hear his neighbors moving behind each door he passed, could hear them talking, their voices rising and falling in familiar waves.  Some were quieter than others, but the walls were so thin in places that he could almost always make out the words, no matter how quiet they tried to be.
For a long time, they drove in silence, the streets flying by as Happy accelerated across the city.  He slowed down only as they finally approached the estate.  “He knows that.”
“You nearly ended up in jail,” Steve said, shaking his head.  “So...  Not sure you made the best choice there, pal.”
Jarvis's eyebrows arched, just a bit.  "Are we certain that is a good idea, sir?"
He gave her a half bow, inclining his head.  “Then, please.  Do not let me interrupt.”  He tossed his reins over a nearby branch, and took the water flask from Steve with a nod of thanks.
Harris looked at her.  “I don’t have a gun,” he pointed out.  A Roomba was trying to collect the remains of his sandwich.  He lifted his arm to give it better access and it beeped at him in an approving manner.
“Well, you're sitting on the roof of a warehouse, some people would interpret that as 'not really fine,' so you can see-”
“I'm just curious if this is an 'armed response' threat sensor?” Tony mused.  “Or is it more of a 'oh no, the 90 pound child has a rock' threat sensor?”
Tony kissed her hair.  “What brought this on?” he asked.  “What’s Hank done now?”
Steve caught his jaw, and tugged his head back around, his fingers gentle on Tony’s cheek.  “I love you,” he said.  “And I need you right now.”
At this hour, the stable was mostly deserted, save for a sleepy looking boy who emerged to take the horses from them, one after another.  T’Challa tossed him a coin, and looked at Okoye.  Okoye leaned against wall of the stable, a heavy staff braced in one hand.  Her fingers flexed against the wood, and she nodded.  “Take her,” she said, a thread of steel in her words.  Exchanging a glance with her, Nakia slipped into the night, disappearing around the corner and vanishing in an instant.  “We will wait.”
He glanced up at the ceiling, at the crisp, clean lines of the room and the walls.  “And sometimes, everything on the surface looks fine.  There’s no way to know if a tiny little part, buried deep down inside, is what’s causing the problem.  Or if there’s two, three, ten gears that are misaligned.  You can’t just assume you know why something’s not working.  Even if you fixed a problem yesterday, and it seems like this is the same problem, you can’t-”  He waved a hand through the air.  “You can’t assume.  So we do a diagnostic.
“My favorite news article was the one about the guy who stole the cookie money from those Girl Scouts,” Shawn started, and everyone else came to a stop, looking directly at them.
DJ smiled, peeking out with one eye as Steve herded Tony and Clint back into their dining room, his expression exasperated.  Clint had a tower of corn dogs on a plate, the pile wobbling with every step.  Tony had a cup of coffee and a slice of pie.  “I’m just saying-”
“My life is confusing,” Clint said.  “So you ran away?”
“Your place,” Tony said, wrenching the front door open, taking the stone stairs two or three at a time.  “Where else would he go?”
Jan was flipping through a huge catalog of invitation samples, a pencil tucked behind her ear, and a piece of toast clamped between her teeth.  As Steve walked in, she scribbled something on a legal pad and snagged the toast, tapping the crust against her plate.  He knew the moment she spotted him, because her face split in a wide, warm grin.  “Steve!  Perfect!  Now that you're dry, come here and help me pick a font!”
“Right,” Tony said, shutting a drawer and dusting his hands on his thighs.  “I somehow am not convinced by that.”  He caught DJ’s hand and steadied him as DJ scrambled up the rungs of a stool, dropping down onto the seat with a pleased smile.  Tony grinned at him.  “Tell you what.  Let’s go up to the kitchen, and see if Clint has a jar you can have to keep all your treasures in, all right?”
Steve reached for the remote.  With a flick of his thumb, he turned off the tv, and sank down into a chair at the conference table, his head falling into his hands.
“Ah.  Furbro.”  Natasha straightened up, not seeming to mind as the cat wound its way around her ankles.  “I shall notify the chef that we have another mouth to feed.”
She straightened up, letting the leaf fall away.  “Until they finally asked him to make something he wouldn’t make.  Something…  Unconscionable.”  She smiled.  “Then, they shot him.”
“Okay.  Good that that’s the theme for our cookies this year, Phil’s mom’ll be pleased.” Clint ruffled DJ’s hair, kicking up a cloud of powdered sugar and flour.  “You keep doing….  Whatever that is, I’ll mix you some more orange and also see if if Jarvis can pull up the right Wikipedia page for me, ‘cause I don’t think I can even spell it.”
Tony choked on a laugh.  “What’s your play, Captain?” he asked.  An expression flickered across Steve’s face, there and gone in an instant, that Tony didn’t understand.  His eyes narrowed.  “Steve?  What’s the plan?”
“Can I have-”
“Sure,” Sam said, giving his phone a quick toss in the air.  He caught it and slipped it into his pocket.  “You could.  But you’ve got to come back eventually.”  He flashed a bright grin in Steve’s direction.  “And I’m a very.  Patient.  Man.”
DJ looked back at Steve, his eyes narrowed.  Steve did his best to look trustworthy.  DJ gave a quick, sharp nod, and leaned in.  "Ramen," he said, in the tones of someone conveying a very important piece of information.
Agatha’s eyebrows arched, her cup held in spindly fingers.  “I have.  That is why we’re here, my dear.”  She took a long sip, and lowered the cup to rest in her lap.  Her eyes reminded DJ of mercury, hard and sharp.  “Unlike you, I knew her.  I fought her.” Her fingers flexed against the cup, and it seemed to bend beneath her grip.  “I would recognize her.”  She set the cup aside, and reached for gnarled wooden cane leaning against the side of her chair.  It met her hand halfway.  “I did recognize her.”
“Would you like to look at it before you pass judgment?” Tony asked him, throwing a hand in the air.
There was a sudden, violent explosion of wind that sent napkins and hats flying, a flash of lightning, a clap of thunder, and a burst of flame, splashing across the floor in a flare of flickering green light.  A dark figure emerged from the flame, rising from the depths, a great, winged shadow that that towered eight, ten, twelve feet high, the black tips of its outstretched arms scraping across the ceiling.
“But I had no idea what would become of either of us.  I had savings, more than most would’ve, and I’ve never shirked a day of work in my life.  But I found myself, alone but for a small boy, at the grave of my husband, and-” She met Steve’s eyes squarely.  “I had no concept of how I would survive, let alone how I would protect him.”
“My fees are reasonable and I’m very liberal in offering credit,” Sam said.  “I’ll be down in ten.  Have coffee.”
"I'm upright," Tony mumbled into Steve's chest, his arms hanging limply at his sides.  "I win."
“That was terrifying,” Tony told them.
"No," Tony said.  Steve just kept smiling at him, and his shoulders slumped.  "No."
Hank shrugged, but there was a softness to his face now, a slight smile tugging at the corners of is mouth.  “There is.  Beat it out of him.”
“I mean, he can try, but I’m wily and fast.”
He grinned, boosting himself up to sit next to her. She leaned her head against his shoulder. “You loved that shirt.”
Jan sank down next to him, drawing her legs up and wrapping her arms around him. “We were worried,” she said, her voice soft.
“Thanks,” he said, and she met his eyes, one eyebrow arched in question.  He gestured between them, awkward and stuttering.  “I know that-  That sort of thing isn’t your-”  He stopped.  “Sorry.”
He looked back at DJ.  “There’s empty seats.  Up on the mezzanine, the balcony.  It’ll be farther away.  And there’s fewer people up there, so if we need to leave, we won’t be in the way.  Likely, no one’ll even know.”  He straightened up.  “And-”  He shrugged out of his jacket, draping it gently over DJ’s head.  “There.  If it’s too bright or too loud, you can make it- Make it less.  You can muffle it, or make it stop entirely.”
"Yes.  I-"  He fumbled for the file folder, managing to get a solid grip on it at last.  He held it out to Stark.  "Yes.  The commissioner-"  He stopped, and tried again.  “The commissioner reviewed everything personally.”
“Yeah, I’m a delight,” Sam agreed, and against his will, Steve smiled.  Sam rubbed a hand over his mouth.  “Seriously, though-”
“All the damn time,” Rhodey muttered.  “It’s the number one form of entertainment in this house.”  He flipped a page.  “Sometimes it’s not even for money.  Just bragging rights.  Or chores.”
Tony’s eyes darted over his face.  “What’s wrong?” he asked, and there was a break in the words, a crack in his voice.  “Steve.  Are you sick?” His throat worked.  “Are you dying?”
Steve looked up, and found Tony’s eyes.  Tony shrugged, his face set, and Steve exhaled.  “For now.  He’s supposed to have some more information for us tonight.  We’ll…”  He straightened up, and Tony resumed his pacing.  “Things might change, after that.”
Tony laughed.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I…  Yeah.”  He looked up at the sky, and felt his stomach shift.  He went back to his phone.  “As soon as the Tweedle Twins and Harris are done with their mischief, we’ll get you something to eat and a bed.”
Carol gave her a look right back.  “That's true,” she said.  “But I need to show off the guns.”
“What’s going on?” Billy asked, scooping up the phone.
He stepped off the stairs, and the instant his foot hit the floor, a pale blue light bloomed, filling the cracks between the stones, flowing outward like water.  It lapped along the floor, swirling like mist around his boots, clinging to his legs as he walked.
Tony nodded.  “Did she introduce a sugar based black hole into my workshop?”
Steve grinned down at his bread dough, his hands working with practiced speed.  There was flour dusting his apron and his bare arms, swirling through the late afternoon sunlight air around him.  Tony watched him work, snuggled down on the couch under a half dozen blankets.  It was calming, and somehow intimate, to watch him go about his baking with his usual care and patience.
“So sorry to interrupt, sir,” Jarvis said.  “But if you’re done?”
“Sweet mother, how have you not learned to recognize an ex-soldier?  There are enough of them in this damn city,” Tony said.  He looked back at the window, a nervous twitch of a movement.  “The way he stood, the way he moved, the way he kept his head moving?  He was a soldier.”
O'Brien reached for his coffee.  "There's no 'going with' here, Rogers," he said.  The cigar by his elbow smoldered in the ashtray, and he reached for it.  "He confessed."  He glanced up again, his eyebrows drawn up tight over his eyes.  "Confessed to being a communist and trying to take out Mr. Stark for the good of the cause."
Ellen rolled her eyes. “Yes.  Haha.  Very clever.”
Steve gave him a withering look. “He’s surprisingly slippery when he’s wet,” he said.  Steve was damp, too, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, the knees of his pants soaked through.  His face was flushed, his hair wet, dripping over his forehead.  It should not have been attractive, but on him, it worked.
Steve went still, and from the bedroom, Tony said, “No.”  Then, “Don’t make that face at me, botboy.  Okay.  Fine.  I’m not mad at you for being here.  I’m not mad at you for the magic thing.  I’m not mad that you didn’t….   Didn’t tell me.  I’m a little mad about the ‘dropping the armor and going into freefall’ thing because we’ve been over that, and it’s not cute.”
Steve smiled against his palm, and when Tony’s fingers twitched, he reached up, catching Tony’s wrist and lifting his hand away.  He didn’t let go, just let his fingers tangle with Tony’s.  “How about I just ask you out?” he whispered.
Tony looked up at her.  “I’d hug you, but you probably have at least six knives on you right now, and I’m not taking that fucking chance.”
Tony looked at it.  “I want to hate it,” he said, slipping the paper from her fingers.  “But I don’t.”
“Here, you can wear mine,” Thor said.  He sat up, and started to shrug out of the jacket.
Sam spread his hands.  “Okay, everyone in this room who has super strength, bench press a piece of furniture with one hand.”
Sue crossed her arms over her chest.  "As well as can be expected," she said.  Her head canted towards Steve, her face drawn and pale.  "You know.  When the government apparently decides it's a good idea to unleash giant mechanical horrors to patrol the streets looking for people like them."
Steve waited, but Jarvis didn't offer any further information.  He stifled a sigh.  Jarvis was being recalcitrant, and that was never a good sign.  “Did he have a nightmare?  Or did he just talk Clint into an all night marathon of the Mummy movies again?”
She smiled.  "I promise nothing of the sort.  You are not showing up in filthy jeans and a shirt you got six years ago because you signed up for a credit card or won it in a beer pong tournament."  She waved her pencil at Thor.  "Thor is getting a new suit!"
“Do we get to choose the piece of furniture?” Jessica asked, giving the couch a considering look.
Peter didn’t move.  “Suffering,” he mumbled from under the pillow.
Tony considered that, his mouth pursed.  “Huh,” he said.
“How can you possibly call our monthly office chair derby a  mistake?” Sam asked, folding his arms on the top of the table.  “I mean, damn.  That’s cold.”
And that was still on the table. He could still do that. He was actively thinking about it.
“Yes, we found him, and this is Officer Rogers,” Natasha said, her head bent over her bowl.  Her spoon cut through the batter, whipping it into smooth, creamy waves. “Officer Rogers, this is Peter.  His aunt is the housekeeper here, and Peter helps in the gardens and grounds.”
She took a breath.  “He cannot accept who he is, until you do.  And at some point, he will lose that battle with himself.”  Her fingers whispered through the armor, and it fell apart, shattering to electronic fragments.  It rained down, whispering away into nothing, and whatever rage was sustaining him disappeared with it.
There was no mistaking it this time.  Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, half dressed in the same clothes they'd had on the night before, side by side at a graceful wrought iron banister.  Beneath Tony's half-buttoned shirt, Ellen could see the faint, cool glow of the arc reactor.  One of Steve's hands was buried in Tony's hair, his fingers sliding through the locks.
“As many as I can.”  Steve took a deep breath, and tried not to think about how much it hurt.  “That’s what you goddamn do, Tony.  You save the ones you can, the ones you can reach.  Maybe it’s one or two, maybe it’s ten, but you save the ones you can, and you keep doing it, you keep trying, because the rest of us don’t have the privilege of waiting around until the system changes, until everything’s perfect.
“I’ll make it up to you later,” she said, amusement running through her voice.
“And this is…  A good gift,” Tony said, his voice flat.
“I'm not certain how to answer this question, sir,” Jarvis said.  He sounded appropriately apologetic.  Tony was well aware that it was an act.
Only after they'd cleared the room did Marcy look at Tony. “Do you want me to start on the press releases?” she asked.
Harris looked down at Slink.  Slink licked a paw, clearly unconcerned.  “Of course he did,” Harris said, as Slink wriggled out of his grip, hopping down to the ground with a thump.  “If you puke-” Harris called after him as Tony walked back into the room, stepping over the cat.
“Enjoying your bath?”
"Is Happy waiting for me, or is Rhodey doing the driving today?"
Tony’s eyes canted downwards, a wicked smile curling his lips, and Steve felt his face heat.  “Trust me,” he said, his voice a low, warm purr, “I noticed.”
“It’s not.”  Tony slipped into the library, trying to close the door before Peter could slip through, but he was remarkably quick.  Sighing, Tony headed for his desk, Peter dogging his heels the entire way.  May, who was tidying Pepper’s desk, gave him a sympathetic look.  “Peter-”
She went on tiptoe to brush a kiss against his cheek.  “Tomorrow, we've got your last fitting for your suit, you'd better show up, or you get to wear something held together with pins and tape.”
“Right,” Clint said.  “Right.”  He leaned back.  “Phil!  Do you want to decorate cookies or learn about modern art?”
Across the great hall, Peter was chasing DJ with a mop, his face flushed, his hair bouncing against his forehead with every lunging step.  His laughter was bright and loud as he swiped at DJ’s feet with the threads of the mop.  DJ scrambled ahead of him, hopping from foot to foot, making a cheerful moving target.
"Ours is not to question why, Rogers."  O'Brien reached for his pen.  "Ours is to do as we're told.  Your life'd be a lot easier if you'd just learn that."  His eyes canted up, glaring at Steve from under the hard line of his eyebrows.  "Be here at two pm, sharp, and remember, you're representing the police force.  So I expect you to be on your best behavior."
DJ took a breath, ignoring how his throat hurt.  “He…  Knows you.”
“It may be,” she said. Hank was yelling upstairs, and Tony turned to look up the stairs.   Jan grabbed his elbow.  “I need your help.  I need fabric, Tony.”
“Old books,” Harris repeated.
“She’s alive?” Strange asked, his voice rising, and DJ winced.  “She’s still ALIVE?”
“I’ll have you take another look at it before the frost,” Obie said.  He took a long sip of his wine.  “Repaired the shelves in the dairy?”
He shook off Tony’s hand, and Tony scooped up the journal, closing it and putting it safely out of reach.  “And yet, you’re still down here, asking for help.”
Steve’s cheeks hurt.  “I’m fine.  I’m-” His hands flexed at his sides.  “I’m fine.”
Jan made a grab for her menu before it could be added to Jess’ wardrobe.  “I need to-”
“We think it's a cat,” Tony told her, his chin braced on one hand.  “For our own mental health, we've decided to agree that it's a cat.”
She set the bowl of peelings aside.  “Servants are always expected to be invisible.  Their work must be efficient, quick, silent and, and most importantly, invisible.  You must exist as a non-entity.  You must be there when needed, and disappear when you are not.  You are privy to everything that happens, and expected never to judge, never to speak, never to…”  Her words trailed away.  “In any case, I sat there, that night, looking at our savings, looking at what I could scrape together, if I sold everything we had.  What did we need, to live?  How much would I have to have, and how quickly could I get it?
Watching Seamus stare up at the foyer, his expression awed, Steve wasn't sure he cared.
There was a beat of silence, and then all of them moved towards the door.  He gripped the door frame with both hands.  “Don’t even try it,” he said.  “Someone’s telling me.”
“I can help,” Bruce offered.
Jan stared at her, her mouth pursed. “The guns,” she repeated.
She covered his hand with hers, her grip firm.  “Sam,” she agreed.  She looked concerned all of a sudden.  “We were-  Talking about Sam?” She ducked forward, trying to meet Steve’s eyes.  “Are you-  Are you all right?”
His hands moved, before he even knew what he was doing, and he didn’t know why they shouldn’t, after all, it was good, it was good for him, it was something he needed, something he wanted. It was-
“No, but I’m sure you can afford to replace it, even though you probably shouldn’t.”
One of Clint's shoulders rose in a slight shrug.  "There's fresh fruit, apples and pears and plums, and probably some berries in the ice box, oatmeal's in the pot on the stove.  Bread's baked fresh daily, and we've got eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese.  Mrs. Parker makes the pastry, so we've got pie and sweet buns, tarts and biscuits.  Coffee and tea, milk and juice.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  "So.  What's your pleasure?”
“I refuse to talk to any birds, no matter what you-”
May reached up, her fingers stroking against his cheek.  “No, Mr.  Stark.  I don’t think I will.”  She took a step back, wiping her hands on her apron with brisk, efficient movements.  “And I will thank you not to tell me how to raise my nephew.”
Tony checked his watch.  Late.  Later than it should’ve been.  With a sigh, he stacked up his paperwork.  DJ dropped the nut, letting it bounce across the bench before picking it up again.  Tony smiled, warmth flooding over him.  “You like that?”
“Mostly I'm going to punch the shit out of something, but I guess I can work in making snide comments between punches,” Jessica said, her head tipped to the side.
He raised a hand, tapping his knuckles on the door, not hard, not loud, but still, Tony’s head swung in his direction.  He smiled, waving Steve in, and Steve reached for the keypad.
She didn’t look at him, just shook the last drops free of the bottle.  “You shouldn’t.”
“I'm fine,” Tony said.  “I've got-” He held up his cup.  “All I need.”
“Technically, I was-”
Peter smiled.  “I’m not going to college, Mr. Stark.”
“No artist ever has too many sketchbooks.”  Steve dragged another crate of the damn things out from under the table.  “At least, that's what my brain keeps telling me every time I'm in an art supply store, looking at a display of sketchbooks.”
“I’ll find you right away, Mr. Stark.”  She looked at the bill, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  “You already gave the whole staff a tip, Mr. Stark, I’m happy to-”
He turned his attention to filling the coffee pot.  It was nice to have a task he could accomplish.
The headline was “Superhero Shocker!” and Steve could almost forgive that because the picture was perfect.  Tony, his legs a tumbled mess in front of him, had fallen back into Steve's arms.  His head was back, and he was laughing, his face flushed and his eyes closed.  Steve, behind him, had his arms around Tony's waist, holding him up, his skates braced on the ice.  He was grinning down at Tony with an expression of such obvious adoration that it was embarrassing.
“That was very nearly something,” Rhodey said, holding up his thumb and finger an inch apart form each other.  “So close. Almost words.”  Clint flipped him off with a grin, and Rhodey laughed.
Clint moved so fast that Tony could barely track it.  One second, he was propped up against the doorframe of the bedroom, the next, Tony’s hand was empty, and Clint was dropping into a chair, his face buried in the cup.  He drained it in two long swallows, and then his head fell back with a sigh.
There was a beat of silence.  “Hi, Tony!  It’s Alison!”
“Wouldn't that be a refreshing change?” His eyebrows arched, and she caught herself smiling. “No one ever asked me, Ellen. And I never volunteered the information. What you did? Was save me from having to make up a press release, and I understand why you're conflicted about it, but...” He nodded. “I'm grateful to you.”
“Ooooooof,” Tony said on a long, pained exhale, and Steve could feel the heat of his breath against his neck.  “Okay.  Wow.”  He reached past Steve, fingers brushing against the touchpad, and he was so close that Steve could smell his cologne, a subtle, pleasant scent made Steve’s mouth go dry.  He shifted in his seat, feeling awkwardly out of place in his own body.  He didn’t know where to put his hands, or how to breathe without it sounding desperate.
“And we’d just had sex in a car,” Tony said, still laughing.
“Alison Blaire,” she said, and she sounded amused, which was probably a good sign.  “Of NYC Nightline?”
“Are you both out of your ever-loving MINDS?” Bobbi yelled, bringing their heads around.  She stared at them across the length of the road, her hand gripping the door of the car.
Harris took a deep breath.  “He’s Tony Stark’s kid,” he said.
“I starting to think my Skrull theory was correct.”
“They just emptied the trash,” she said, and then she smiled.  “But we could use more water?  If you have a chance?”
DJ stared at the tv.  “When I was-”  He stopped, unsure of how to make the concept fit what he was, what he had been.  “New,” he said, and that word wasn't right, but his words often weren't right.  He was used to it.  Used to the frustration of words being wrong, or being just right enough that he could use them without worrying that he'd confuse everyone.  “Back when I was just Dummy, I got-”  His fingers rubbed against the curve of his knee, back and forth, trying to ease the ache there.  “Lost.”
“I'm going to take that as a yes.”  Tony straightened up, groaning as his spine twinged.  He braced his hands on the small of his back, groaning as he stretched out the kink. “Right.  Let's go take something apart.”
“There’s artichoke hearts today,” Benito told him, wiping his hands on a towel.
“No,” Tony said, very emphatically.
Thor scooped him off the ground in a bear hug, pinning Stark's arms to his sides, a laugh booming out of him.  "My friend!" he said, as Stark's feet pedaled desperately in mid-air.  "Why did I have to read about your new son in the newspapers?  You could not have told me?”
“You're adorable, Rogers, you really are.”  Sam held out a hand.  “It's up to you.  I'll support you, no matter what.  But if you can't make him see you as a romantic possibility now, Steve, it's never going to happen, you know that, right?”
“Yeah, of course, we can do something for lunch if you-” That was as far as he got before all three of the kids took off towards the elevator.  Steve stared after them, amused despite himself.  “Aaaaaand they're gone.”
Tony braced a hand on the counter, his mouth going tight.  “Right.  Schedules.  You like to know what's happening, so you can prepare, right?”  DJ nodded. “Okay.”  He glanced up at the plans.  “In one hour,” he said, looking back down.  “Okay?”  DJ considered that, and nodded, but his face was creased with worry.  Tony took a deep breath and tried again.  “Play for one hour, then you can help me with the chestplate, then we need to get ready for dinner.”
“No.  My dinner is going to be an entire box of crab rangoon and a spinach kale smoothie,” Tony said.  “That balances out to a complete meal. That is all I need right now, so-” Sam made a darting grab for the container, and Tony fended him off with a pair of chopsticks.  “I will stab you.  Do not think that I won’t, Wilson.”
“I’m thinking of asking him to Jan’s party,” she said.
Strange reemerged.  “DJ?”
“It is, here.” Jarvis met his eyes without flinching.  “Marriages work on similar terms.  As do families.” He sighed.  “If a company is owned by a man, but the board is made up of cousins and son-in-laws and childhood friends, all of whom will be excised without a second thought if they do not produce, if they step out of line or fail in their duty, is that so different?”
DJ gave him a slight smile.  “I miss Jarvis.”
“Going,” Tony said, and he went, and Steve was right behind him.  He was pretty sure that Steve was laughing, and even more sure that Steve thought he didn’t know.  He glanced over his shoulder, giving Steve a bright grin.  “See what you did?”
“I have already dealt with this particular call,” Jarvis said.  “As it turns out, it requires your direct intervention.”
“So what’s your solution?” Steve asked.  “To sit here, in your house on the hill, making up a private army and waiting until you can make things perfect before you do anything?  And to hell with everyone who’s dying while you’re waiting for the stars to align?”
"Misery loves company," Tony agreed.  He took a deep breath. "I know you think this is the right thing to do."
“I'll keep that in mind,” she said.  “Now, unless anyone has any other questions, I can-”
Trip folded her arms on top of the desk, leaning her weight into them.  “And will they?” she asked, curious despite herself.
“Apparently.”
"Wine?" Natasha offered Steve.
"We do not tell him," Hitomi said.  She glanced in Steve's direction, a puckish smile curving her lips.  "Let him think we have only organic juice and fresh vegetables here."  She stood, wiping her hands on a tea towel.  "When we are sick, sometimes the things that are good for us, are not-"  She stopped, her eyes narrowing.  "Not good for us."
There was a faint beep from his phone, and then Steve's voice. “Hi! I'm either out of range, or not available. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks!”
“Yes,” Steve said, at the same time that Tony said, “Wait.  Did Harkness stick me with the check?”
“I'm so sorry,” Rhodey said.
“There is a tendency, amongst families of extreme wealth, to try to protect their children,” Jarvis said, and Steve got the feeling he was choosing his words very carefully.  “When you are, in fact, extremely wealthy, you are, of course, going to deal with people who wish to take advantage of that.  Children are especially vulnerable to false friends who seek a financial windfall.
Hogan nodded.  “Lemme guess, he woulda been in trouble.”
Steve stared at him, and Nicholas chuckled.  “You always were one for a straight frontal assault,” he said, his voice warm.  “How did you survive a war?”
Tony grinned.  “But I bet you know some Italians, don’t you?” he said.  That won him a nod.  “Well, I’m Italian, too.  Half, at least.”
The innkeeper didn’t even look up as they entered his attention focused on the ledger book spread open in front of him.   Half a dozen coins, polished and bright, stood out amid the piles in front of him, and he gestured behind him with a twitch of his head.  “Back parlor, my lords,” he said, his voice rough.  Bucky took a step forward, his booted foot hitting the ground with a thump, and the man looked up, peering through the smoke from his pipe.  “And my lady,” he amended.
He looked up, but for once, Steve was oblivious to what was happening.  Tony reached for DJ’s shoulder.  “What’s-”
“That being said-” Sam cut in front of Steve and came to a sudden stop, making Steve backpedal to keep from crashing into him.  Sam rested a hand gently on Steve’s chest.  “I’m going to ask you a question right now, and I’d like you to really think about answering it honestly, at least to yourself.  I can’t make you tell me the truth, but for you-” He tapped Steve.  “In your head.  Answer this honestly.”
“It had to happen eventually,” Natasha said.
Sam ignored him.  “Jan roped a bunch of our teammates into it, but you were late and I had a counseling session that I couldn’t just ditch,, so the session had already started by the time we got there, and instead of interrupting them, we just decided to shoot some hoops.”
“I'll find a nice, affordable Chianti,” Tony said.
“Still my damn wedding,” Stark pointed out, throwing his arms across the back of the pew.  Next to him, Rogers ducked his head forward, not quite fast enough to hide his smile.
Steve barely got the word out before her hand came up, staving him off.  “He can answer for himself, Captain Rogers, and I think it’s best that he does.”
“Or maybe someone’s cut the line,” Steve gritted out, pushing himself to his feet.  “Go start the car.”
Tony grinned at him, broad and easy, and Steve’s heart still skipped a beat at that.  The way that Tony’s eyes crinkled at the corners when he was really, truly smiling.  The way that he stood, his chef’s whites unbuttoned and open over his rumpled Metallica t-shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, as if he was utterly relaxed at that moment.  The way his face softened when he looked at Steve, like it was okay, like everything was okay, like it would be okay.
The oven beeped, and Mackenzie reached for a potholder.  "Long night?" she asked, as she snagged the scone from the warming oven.  She dropped it into a bag and rolled the paper down before tossing it to DJ.  He caught it, the familiar weight falling into his hands the way it always did.
Steve gave him a look. “Yes.  She has.”
“We might know a guy,” Luke said.
Steve’s eyes slid shut.  “I love you.”
DJ’s hands stilled.  “No,” he said.  He looked at Tony, a faint smile on his face.  “You’ll go looking for her.”
Tony nodded.  “I know.  But-”  He glanced over, a faint smile creasing his lips.  “Grasping at the thinnest of straws, I suppose.”
Rhodey wrapped his hands around his coffee cup, his fingers smoothing against the porcelain.  “What’s he done?” he repeated with a fond smile.
“It is,” Tony said.  “Wait, for me to-”
“You lie,” DJ said, his eyes canting upwards towards the ceiling of the elevator.  He knew just where the camera was, and even if he couldn't see Jarvis, he felt better knowing that Jarvis could see him.  “All the time.”
Rhodey held it out to him. “No.”
“Miss Van Dyne has notified us as to her plans,” Pepper said.
“That sounds likely,” Miss Potts said, breaking a scone apart with her fingers.  She gave Steve a gamine smile.  “There are bowls there to the right of the stove.”
“I would.”
“We can’t,” the kid said, at the same time the blonde said, “It’s complicated.”
“Maybe you could shower, you smell a little ripe,” Jan shot back, as they cut through a pack of orderlies, heading straight for SHIELD's version of an ICU.  People scrambled to get out of their way, and Tony barely noticed.  “Look-”
“I suspect we won’t find a listing in the financial pages,” Jarvis said.  “But I also suspect that Miss Potts has ways around such a trifling problem.”  He leaned forward, picking up the decanter from the corner of Tony’s desk.  He flipped over two tumblers and filled each one with a hefty dose of amber liquid.  He offered one to Tony.  “But I don’t think that buying any number of orphanages will solve your problem, sir.”
“Hey.” Tony reached out, his fingertips stroking DJ’s hair away from his forehead.  “All right, then, the movie’s done, you great waste of money..”  DJ kicked out with one foot, digging deeper into the nest he’d made of Tony’s jacket.  Tony caught himself smiling down at the oblivious brat.  “So what’s this?  You live here now?  You’re not going to come-”
“But let me see DJ first.”  Steve’s throat worked.  “He’s-  Let me see him.”
“I-” Tony’s eyes slid shut.  “Yes.  I do.  I…  Like him.”  The words were all he could manage, all he was willing to admit, but they hurt.  It hurt to say them, in a way that he couldn’t quite explain.  “So.  Leave it alone.”
DJ looked at Franklin, who was scowling at his sister's back.  DJ set his screwdriver down and pointed at Val.  Franklin dragged his legs in, the movement awkward and unsteady, and pushed himself to his feet.  “Sorry, Val,” he said.
“Yes, Ma.”  Steve fished a potato out of the soup with the tip of his spoon.  “Want to know what I think?”
He heard it, and knew, without even having time to think about it, that something had just gone very, very wrong.
“They might not be,” Steve pointed out.  “They seem to have a mind of their own.”
Steve retrieved the file from his bag.  “Does Mr. Stark know that Miss Potts made the request?” he asked.
“Breakfast,” Miss Potts said, her voice firm.  “Natasha, would you mind making certain that Officer Rogers doesn't escape before he's had something to eat?”
“And he didn’t stay there,” Tony said.  He waved at Jarvis over his shoulder.  “Do me a favor.  Make dinner?”
“He does not get a seat at the dinner table,” Tony said, and he tried to sound like he meant it.
Natasha frowned at him.  “How do you know that?”
Steve waited, but that seemed to be the end of the rant.  “How much did you drink last night?”
“The government is coming for my child,” Sue said, her voice flat.  Her smile was thin and brittle.  “So my mood is swinging wildly between 'how do I get him to the nearest boarder,' and 'how do I overthrow the current administration?'”
DJ grinned at her, his feet bouncing against the side of Tony's desk.  “Furbro.”
Bucky stared at him.  “I do not know what to say to that.”
“All right.  Let’s see if we can remember where the places go,” Steve said, pulling an armchair over for DJ.  “All the pawns in front, and the bigger pieces in the back, right?  Where does the king go?”
“Oh, well, that’s Darcy’s trash, anyway,” Harris said, and this time, the smile felt a lot better on his face.  “She’s got an emergency box of Lucky Charms squirreled away somewhere, because I refuse to put that in my closet with the real food.”  He leaned back against the couch.  “Someday, someone’s going to try to rob this place and they’ll find a box of breakfast ‘cereal’ taped to the ceiling of my closet or something, and think that’s where the drugs are.”
His voice trailed away, and Bobbi was already shaking her head.  “We don’t need to follow him,” she said, straightening up.  “If we already know where he’s going to end up.”
Tony nodded.  “I know.  Thank you, Jay.”
“Terrifying?” Rhodey offered, offering Tony a screwdriver.  “If you take that off, don’t forget-”
“You need more than that?” Clint asked.  DJ nodded, but he was already holding up socks, staring at them with narrowed eyes as he tried to make pairs.  “Okay, well, I’ve got presents to wrap and also I hate sorting the recycling.”
His skin was warm under Steve’s fingertips, so soft and so familiar, and it hurt to touch him sometimes.  “I’m not going to apologize for that.  Not if it keeps you safe.  Not if it keeps all of you safe.”
Tony blinked.  “The coffee grinder?”
Jarvis smiled. “It’s not a curse unless you’re determined to treat it like one.”  He stood again, giving Tony’s hair a look, frowning at it like it had insulted him somehow.  “Now, all we have to do make you somewhat presentable before he next visits.”
Her smile dimmed, just a little, and one shoulder rose and fell in a slight shrug.  “It’s the only way we can copyright the name,” she said, her nose wrinkling beneath the bridge of her glasses.  “If it has three letter a’s.  So we have to make sure that we always pronounce all of them.” She took a deep breath.
“There's a fountain under the stairs,” Rogers said, his voice flat.
And, as it turned out, it was also just big enough to hold what seemed, at first glance, to be about fifty SHIELD agents.
“No, but I'm driving you into the city at a very early hour tomorrow morning.”  He crossed his arms over his chest, bracing one shoulder against the doorframe.  “And despite what Mr. Stark might think, we both need sleep.”
He squeezed his eyes shut. “I can't do it again, Pepper. I can't. You get used to the weight, the pressure. Of, of life. You get used to it and then you don't even feel it anymore, because it's always been there and it has to be borne, so fuck, just handle it, just bear it, and don't think about it.
Tony’s head snapped back.  “Wait,” he gasped.  He stared down at Steve, his eyes huge, his pupils blown wide.  “Those flowers.  Those were MY flowers.”
“A conservative estimate for Deathclaw’s feeding instructions would-”
“Mmmm.”  Tony was thinking about pasta now, garlic and onion, the heavy acidic bite of the tomato, mellowed with the earthiness of fresh Parmesan.  Maybe gnocci...
“Comeuppance,” Steve said, his voice bright, and quickly got out of range when Sam took a swing at him with his flowers.  Laughing, Steve backed up, holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender.  “So suave, so charming, I can’t believe-”
“I have no idea what's going on,” Tony admitted, as Steve smoothed his hair back.  Giving up, Tony leaned into the contact, needing the support more than he liked to admit.  “What's going on?”
“Okay,” DJ agreed.  He scrambled off of Steve’s back, grabbing the hand Peter held out to him.
Bucky’s shoulder rose in a shrug.  “One place is the same as any other,” he said, and Steve looked at him.  His face was expressionless, his mouth a tight line.  But his posture was relaxed, or as relaxed as he seemed to get, nowadays.
“Right.”  Steve shoved a hand through his hair.  “He's going to be fine, Hitomi, but he's really out of it right now.  I can wake him, if you-”
DJ gave her a suspicious look, and Wanda drew her legs up, bracing her heels on the edge of her seat.  “So.  What do you want to do?”
She hooked a thumb over her shoulder towards the chapel.  “It got its own certificate.  We keep it on display.  No one ever reads it.”
“So noted, sir.” Jarvis sounded amused.  Almost affectionate.  “I have started coffee in the kitchen, sir.”
“I am asking the camera, Parker, but since it’s not answering, fuck it, yes, you can give me your best guess.” Tony flopped back into his seat, all loose limbs and easy grace.  He pushed a hand through his hair and almost fell sideways out of the seat.  “Is this on?”
She grabbed for his shoulder, then his arm, then his neck.  "Not at all," she said, her voice rising to a panicked pitch.
Isaiah gave a snort.  “All right, then, Mr. Perfect.”  He pulled out a seat, sinking down into it with a faint groan.  “Can’t believe you made an old man chase you all the way down here.”
Steve rocked backwards, taking the brunt of the hit without difficulty, but the sudden impact of Tony’s body against his sent a shock through his system.  For an instant, Steve just stood there, his arms locked tight around Tony’s chest, his feet braced, his heart in his throat.
“Like a hermit, lost in prayer,” Tony said.  “Sackcloth and ashes.  There might even be fasting.”
“Hey!” Tony tried to move it out of reach, leaning sideways with the carton held out as far away from Steve as he could go.  Laughing, Steve just crowded in on him, his chest pressed to Tony's until they both unbalanced, tipping over onto the roof.
But his phone was doing a little sideways shimmy across the edge of the sink, and he reached out to steady it before it ended up on the tile.  And once he was that far out, it seemed stupid to go back in.  Sighing to himself, he turned off the water and reached for a towel.  A few quick swipes of his hands and the plush terrycloth, and he was dry enough to risk the phone again.
Tony paused, halfway to the bedroom door.  “Right,” he said, scraping a hand over his jaw.  He needed a shave.  And a shower.  And a change of clothes.  He huffed out a breath.  “Fuck it.  He's seen me looking worse.  And I need coffee.”
Steve threw an arm around Sam's shoulders.  "Sam?"
She met his eyes without flinching.  "It's legal."  Tony stared at her, his hands spread wide, and she set her tablet down in front of him, the gesture somehow gentle.  She took a deep breath.  "Tony.  I'm sorry.  But we can't touch them."
DJ shook his head again, but he watched, his gaze intent, as Jarvis set Pepper's cup in front of her and filled it from the tea pot.  Pepper smiled at him. “Would you like a bite of my strudel?” she offered.  He shook his head again, but picked up a spoon from the table, running his fingers over the curve of the bowl.
Steve stared at him.  “You skipped my question.”
“You chose the location for that date, so I think that one’s on you,” Harris told her.  “And we’re holding up the line.”
“In her defense, that’s the general response of anyone not from New York who loves baseball,” Jess said.  Steve raised a hand.  “The Dodgers are in LA now, baby, you’re gonna have to give up on that.”
“Ah, thank you, dear.”  Obie stood,crossing to the coat rack to reclaim his jacket.  He shrugged it on. “This discussion isn’t over, Tony.”
“It's so nice to know that you're there to keep them on the straight and narrow,” Pepper said, sipping her lemonade.
She shrugged.  “Because everyone else asks questions,” she pointed out.  “I call you, I call Jane, I call Thor, even if I call Harris, everyone-” She spread her hands.  “Everyone asks questions.  I call Clint, and say, ‘I need you to come pick me up, right now,’ and the only thing he asks is ‘where are you?’”
She didn’t say who ‘he’ was, but Bucky pushed himself upright, his face set.  “I’m fine,” Steve said, but Bucky passed him as well, the heavy strap of his rifle thrown over his shoulder.  Steve shook his head.  “I don’t-”
Steve paused.  “All right,” he said at last.
DJ nodded, his skin warm against Tony's hand.  Tony smiled, and it didn't hurt the way the way he'd expected it to.  “I want you to remember that.  It might not make the nightmares stop, we both know that nightmares are, they're weird things, Deej.  But if you remember, maybe next time you have one, you'll know.
“It was almost done!” Peter said
“And the thing is, if either of us cared less, it’d be easier, Deej.  If either of us could say, ‘you know what, whatever, do whatever you want,’ it would be so much easier.  But being your parent, it’s…  It’s something I’m not good at, but I’m…  I’m not willing to give up on it.”
The word echoed inside the helmet, and a cursor flashed on the HUD.  No contact.  DJ took a deep breath, and another.  “No Jarvis.”  The words were jittery, uneven.  He nodded.  “Scan.  Find anything familiar, anything-”  The table he was under jolted as someone bumped it, and DJ jerked sideways, drawing his legs up and out of the way.  “Get me a network.”
“Hello there,” Pepper said, smiling at him.  “Did you help Bruce in the garden?”
“They offered him a large sum to set the fire at the boat house, as a distraction, and using the surrounding chaos as cover, to make sure that the gate was open.  Likely he was offered a partial payment up front, with the rest to be handed over when he accomplished his tasks.  Maybe he was going to get paid that night, maybe he was supposed to meet up with the fixer later for his payout.  There are risks to both.  You don’t want to be caught by the police that sort of money if you’re searched, but if you agree to a payment later, there’s a chance it’ll never happen.
The trip from the curb to his door was a blur, in the edges of his vision, he caught a glimpse of familiar faces, voices trailing behind them as they took the stairs at a run, Tony sprinting along ahead of him.  Steve’s door always stuck, the hinges tight with rust and the wood swelling every time it rained.  Tony hit it with a thump, and Steve reached past him, his hand closing on Tony’s.  Together, they wrenched the door open.
Steve shook his head.  “We’re not lost,” he said.  The road stretched out in front of them,  the dirt pounded flat by thousands of feet that had been this way before.
DJ blinked, slow and careful.  But some of the tension went out of his face.  “Yes?”
Steve stared him down. “Don’t do this,” he said, his voice blunt.  “It’s not funny.”
Steve let out a raw, angry bark of laughter.  “We-”  He sucked in a breath, and another.  “We don't know if that's...  Permanent,” he said.  Tony's fingers stilled against his hair, and Steve's head turned, twisting away.  “We don't know anything.”
Tony leaned over, pressing a kiss to Pepper's knuckles.  “I'm never dancing with you again,” he said, his breathing ragged.  “You're a menace.”
He blinked.  “I wanted to ask you something, actually.”  He rolled his cup between his hands, his fingers flexing.  “Why you wrote that story.”
Steve had given up on the bed by the third night.
Jarvis was already moving, lifting one of the long lengths of wrought iron that were leaning against the wall next to the door.  "Yes, sir."
"Pizza," Steve agreed.
“Right,” Steve said.  “A spy.  A sniper.  A fighter.  An underworld contact.”  He nodded.  “Who’s the demolition expert?  Mrs. Parker?”
“That he did,” Jarvis agreed, stacking up Peter’s school books.  “Shall I put these on the shelf, sir?”
“Yes, neither do I, and that’s why we’re leaving,” Darcy said.  “Does anything hurt?  Did you hit your head?  Does anything feel broken?”
May’s head tipped back as she stared up at Steve.  She nodded.  “There are bigger problems than this?” she asked Pepper.
“And you can’t say anything when I go to a fifty dollar buffet and eat nothing but eight corndogs,” Clint said.
"Yes," Jan said.  "Jess, too."
“We went to Mjolnir, you started a bar brawl, Thor finished the bar brawl, then he and his people and the SHIELD staff all went back to SHIELD and then we drank a lot of things in the dark and you tried to get Fury to admit that the wiring had failed completely and he challenged you to cook something without using the words ‘foam, smoke, dessicated or infused,’ and so then we went back to TOBRU and ate chicken and waffles and then there was another bar and a secret underground place where everyone was terrifying and then you called Jess-”
“I can-” The girl stepped forward, her hands coming up, then she stopped, as if she didn’t know what to do.  She gave Darcy a hopeless look.
“No,” Tony said, but he was pretty sure that Rhodey had already hung up.  “Does it count as getting the last word if the other person doesn't actually hear it, Jay?”
Harris nodded.  “Did he mean we’d know it when we saw it, or he’d know it when he saw it?”
Jarvis studied him for a long moment, then set about collecting the tea cups.  “And why not?” he asked.
“Right,” Steve said, shaking his head.  “Of course he was.”
Tony pulled back.  “Do as I say, not as I do?” he asked, with a wry twist to the words.  “A bit hypocritical, don’t you think?”
“You should go lie down,” Steve called from the cockpit.
Steve leaned backwards to stare at him around the fridge door.  "As opposed to?"
“My grandfather followed me around yelling at me that every subpar bowl of soup I served was a dagger in the heart of my entire family, living and dead,” Shiro said.
Tony slouched lower in his seat.  “I still say it’s been longer,” he muttered.  Because it had.  It absolutely had.
“I can smell the eggs, thank you, that’s close enough.”  Pepper pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, her head tipping to the side.  “But I think you’re going to be fine.  Because I just got notified of this tweet from user HouseInternAnon, which reads, and I quote, ‘Wow, this food truck guy is tearing the congressional committee about twelve new assholes.’”
“Perhaps we are at an age where lying at the floor is more of a detriment than a pleasure, no matter what company we might have.”  Brisk footsteps, and then Jarvis stepped in front of Tony, offering him a hand.  “Up we go, sir.  I’ll run you a bath tonight.”
Steve choked on a laugh, and clamped a hand over his mouth.  “I’m sorry,” he managed, through his fingers.  “I’m-  I’m sorry.”
“If you want the lead, better take it, Mr. Rhodes.”
“A team,” Tony said.  “A team of remarkable people.”
“Actually, I went to the building across the street, to see if I could seen anything.  With my camera,” Jesse said.  She was smiling now, just a little, a small, smug smile.  Ellen was pretty sure she'd earned it.  “I like my camera.”  She flopped back on the bed, her arms thrown out to the sides.  “But I'd like to point out that I out reported you.”
Everyone stopped, and Tony looked at DJ, who was still studiously copying strings of figures.  Tony leaned in.  “What?”
“I need your help,” Tony said, and Steve grabbed his arm.
“Isn’t that heavy?”
Steve heard the bedroom door open and waved a hand in Tony's direction.  “Have you seen this trash?” he asked, scowling down at the file in his hands.  “I swear, if they even try to move forward with this, I'm going to march down there myself and start knocking heads together, this is absolutely-”
“Excuse me, it's our kitchen, and we have two more seatings, so-”
Steve struggled against a smile.  “I have a gun,” he said, stopping in front of the table.  It stretched between them, an unfathomable barrier.  “You made it, actually.”
“What am I supposed to do with these?” Tony yelled after him, and Steve bounced around to face him, still moving towards the elevators.
“Yes,” Tony agreed.  “The ‘shutting up thing.’”
“I was always an iconoclast,” Tony said, selecting a bottle.  “And I’m doing what you won’t do on your own: make you relax for at least ten minutes.” He poured shampoo into the hollow of his palm.  “Come here.”
Tony paused in the doorway, his hand still resting on the doorknob.  It felt cold and damp under his palm.  “Good evening,” he said, and the words echoed, hollow and empty, in the massive dining room.  Obie was seated in his customary place at the head of the table, his large, ornately carved chair having the appearance of a throne.  On his right side, and slightly closer, Ty was drinking his wine, ignoring his overflowing plate.  He was slumped low in his chair, his well-tailored clothing in disarray and his face set in petulant lines.  He glared at Tony over the top of his wineglass, his eyes promising retribution.  On Obie’s other side, Justin was focused on his plate, his movements quick and nervous as he reached for one thing, and then another, indecisive and uncertain.  Ty flicked a pea at him, and it hit Justin in the shoulder, making him twitch.
Giving up, he sat up, scrubbing his hands over his face.   He resisted looking at the clock.  However long he'd been lying here, it had been too long.  And despite that, it was still far too early to get up.  Steve considered his clothes, neatly folded on the chest at the foot of the bed.  A quick patrol around the house might exhaust him to the point where sleep was possible, and even if it didn't, it would at least feel more productive than lying here, wondering why Stark bought mattresses filled with quicksand.
“Right, the Cliff’s Notes version,” Tony said, rubbing his forehead.  “DJ’s apparently apprenticing himself to his universe’s Stephen Strange.  Who came looking for him, but for some reason, DJ wasn’t able to utilize the portal he’d created to bridge our worlds.”  He took a deep breath.  “DJ thinks that our Strange might be able to shed some light on the situation, but he’s AWOL.”
“I realized when I was saying it that it was not my best move, but every so often, I do like to appeal to your rational side,” Pepper said.
“No,” DJ told him, and Steve tried to muffle his laughter behind a hand.
"Where-"  Tony spread his hands.  "Where are you going to find this mythical, unicorn like reporter?"
"It's a dark reddish purple," Steve said.  "Almost a brown."
“People need to eat and when governments attempt to control and confine the feeding of the poor to sanctioned locations, chosen for their convenience and minimum disruption to the convenience of the monied and powerful, then they are sacrificing the health and well-being of their most vulnerable populations for a matter of public preception.” He smiled.  “Every one of them would should be held accountable for the damage that they’re doing, and moreover, they should not be shocked when their own people step up to oppose them at every turn.”
“Yeah, you should have.”
“Uh-huh, well, guess what, we're going to-”  His phone vibrated in his pocket, and he fumbled for it with one hand.  “Hold on.” Tony made a grumbling noise, his eyes fluttering shut.  Steve found himself smiling at Tony, even as he answered his phone.  “Hey.”
"I like a challenge," Jesse said.  "Also, not much to go by.  Usually, famous people, you have horrible paparazzi photos to mock.  Him?  Not so much."
Steve considered him, his face unreadable.  And then he reached out to take the ornament from his hand.  “I'll wear my best suit,” he said, and Tony heaved a sigh of relief.
The video was the last thing he'd done on the phone, so it was still sitting there, ready to go.  The sound wasn't the best, but the footage was clear enough.
“He should be used to that by now,” Carol said, tripping over her own feet as she tried to follow Jess through a complicated step that Steve was pretty sure had been a fox trot once upon a time.  Laughing, Jess did a side-step and a shimmy, keeping her feet just out of reach.
Another beat of silence.  “Don’t kill the kid,” Tony said.
“For you,” DJ repeated, tapping Thor on the head with the box.  Laughing, Thor put him down and took it.
He held it out, the battered watch cradled in the hollow of his palm.  “If you’ll let me.”
Bobbi crossed her legs, settling the file on her knee.  “I think you’re right,” she said.  “Do you want to share, Officer Rogers?”  She looked up, the hard line of her brows arching as she flipped through the pages.  “Or did you not know?”
She reached for the doorknob, and before her fingers could make contact, the door swung open.  Jarvis stood there, framed in the light of the foyer.  “Welcome home, sirs.”  He inclined his head in Steve’s direction, but he was clearly speaking to Bobbi.  “Mr. Stark has asked you to join him for a drink.”
He walked across the kitchen, sliding a knife out of the block as he passed.  “You.”  He waved it in the direction of the boy hovering by the table, his hat in his hands.  “Sit and eat.  Jarvis’ll bring Mr. Stark’s reply as soon as it’s ready, and in the meantime, you’re getting in my way.”
“The people who need to believe already do.”  Nicholas smiled.  “T’Challa’s missive didn’t reach me unopened.  And I’m sure my reply was more public than I would’ve liked as well.  Which is why I met with Wilson in person to assign him to go and fetch you.”  He paused, his eye cutting in Sam’s direction.  “You were slow, by the way.”
Steve smiled at his back.  “Yes, sir.”
Steve laughed, some of the strain going out of him. “Thank you.” He tipped his head back, and Aimsbridge took the strip of silk out of his hand. He made quick work of the knot, his fingers light against Steve's throat as he tightened the tie.
“Weird how that happened.”  Tony grinned down at his phone.  “Hysterical, though.”
“Every person I’ve ever been in a relationship with has stabbed me at least once, you think I’m scared of THAT?” Clint asked.  “Actually.  New plan.  Group cosplay.  We’re all going as Tony Stark.”
“She fled.  The field.  At a run,” Jess said.
“If you say so, Phil.”  She braced her hands on her hips.  “I’ll call your mother back and let her know she can cancel the plane tickets.”
But when he smiled at T’Challa, his whole face lit up.  “Your Majesty,” he said, inclining his head.
“Well, it's your lucky day, because I intend to show up this time,” Tony said.  “Just you and me and a couple of hundred boxes of ornaments.”
“Revenge seldom is.”
Tony took a deep breath.  “Parker.”
“At the end of the night, everyone is welcome to take one of these assorted dessert trays.”  She gestured at the display platter with all the grace and charm of a game show hostess.  It had been wrapped in colored cellophane and topped with a big bow. “Or, if you’d prefer, we’ve partnered with the Maria Stark foundation to distribute the extras to their network of homeless shelters, domestic violence safe houses, and children’s charities.”
She nodded.  “I think you just might be right.”  She extended a hand to him.  “No promises.  But I'll look for your boy.”
Steve pulled back, just far enough for his breath to wash over Tony's lips.  “Hi,” he repeated.
Tony arched an eyebrow.  “I mean, you left me to freeze to death, cold and hungry, and he fed me and gave me socks, so-” His lips curled up in a wicked smile.  “He's looking pretty attractive right now.”
Bucky had called that a deathwish, and Steve had never really understood why.
Tony braced a hand on his hip.  “I’m confused.”  He paused.  “And a little disappointed.”
“What if he’s expecting you to, you know, propose?” Darcy asked, taking the bottle of water out of Tony’s hand and sitting down on the ground to pass it to DJ.
"Officer Rogers."
Tony waited.  Steve didn’t volunteer anything else, and he sighed.  “Yeah, so do I, so cough it up, Rogers.”
He bit back the very real urge to say 'well, that's never going to fucking happen,' and instead, just gave the room a slight smile. "Thanks. We appreciate it."
“No,” Tony said.  “But LGBTQ people have to deal with it.  Because the moment you exist, fully and openly, people consider that you've opened the topic up for public conversation.”  He gave Steve a sarcastic sort of smile.  “After all, if you didn't want to answer questions about your sex life, then why start talking about your sexuality?”
“Well, fuck that, then, he’ll staple my complaint form to my forehead,” Tony said, and he knew she was laughing.  He closed his eyes, trying to ignore how they burned.  “Romanov?”
Natasha looked up, and realized that the cop was staring right at them, his eyes narrowed against the afternoon sunlight.  She nodded.  “I think it's time to tell Coulson.”
Tony took a deep breath and tried not to throw up.  “I'm going to need a link to that story.”
He opened his mouth.  Frowned.  “Touche.”
"I'm here, Tony.  I got here, right on time, and there's candles and this tablecloth probably cost more than a year's worth of my old Army salary, and-"
Tony gave Dummy the instructions back. “Right.  Right.  Where are the fish instructions?”  Dummy shook the pages three times.
“Wonderful, SHIELD must be having a complete meltdown by now,” Harris said.  “Are we going to-”
"Out loud?  With my best Emperor Palpatine impression?"
In the silence that followed, the sound of the pot being returned to the coffee maker was very loud.  “Why the sudden concern?”
"It's fine, Officer Rogers. I'd like to think he's a friend of mine," Pepper said, as Billy dipped a low bow over her hand, doffing his cap with a flick of his wrist. She struggled to keep a straight face as he gave her a theatrical kiss on the knuckles. "And quite the gentleman."
Safe.  As far away as he possibly could get.  But safe.
‘It’s your turn.’
“I expect you to research anyone who shows up claiming a relationship to him,” Tony said, cutting him off, his voice tinged with ice, “and if you find their claim to be plausible, I expect you to pay them off and send them packing.”
Steve stared after her. “I’m so sorry.”
“I know that it hasn’t worked for anyone else yet,” Tony pointed out.
“Imagine my relief, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said.
Steve straightened up, his cap tucked neatly under his arm.  The question hadn't been addressed to him, but he answered it anyway.  "Officer Steve Rogers," he said, his voice crisp.  "NYPD.”
Instead, Tony picked up a toy from the pile, without even looking.  Something to do with his hands.  “I left you alone for a long time, and I'm sorry about that.”  He paused.  “I've left you waiting a lot, haven't I?”  He glanced up, meeting DJ's eyes.  “How much of your life has been spent waiting for me to remember you exist?”
DJ looked up with a grin.  “Yes.”  He looked at Steve, still seated on the bottom of the stairs.  “Dinner?”
“Morning, Chef!” Peter came bouncing through the kitchen door, fastening his jacket as he skidded across the floor.  He grinned at them, his brown hair flopping over his forehead.  “Bruce said to check with you for prep today?”
Jess considered him.  “Sure,” she said to Jessica, a grin sweeping over her face.
“Ha!” Tony stabbed a finger in her direction.  And he had no idea where to go from there.  “I-”  His eyes darted towards Nebula, who was just sitting at her desk, her head cradled in her hands.  “Ha?”
“Good!”  She squeezed his hand. “Now, turn.”
His shoulders twitched into something like a shrug.  "It's not my place to approve or disapprove, ma'am."
In between them was Officer Charlie Maguire, his cap in his hand, his head tipped back as he stared at the ceiling, his mouth hanging open.  Steve must’ve made some sort of sound, because Maguire twisted around, his eyes going sharp.  “Rogers,” he said.
Shiro peered over his shoulder.  “And I know udon,” he said.  He patted Tony on the back and stepped back, moving past him in the claustrophobic space that made up his kitchen.  The restaurant was barely more than a stand, a handful of stools set up in front of a counter that faced the prep area, and two tiny tables wedged into the remaining space beside the door.  Light filtered in through the flapping cloth flags over the door and windows, and from the counter, Tony could see people darting past on the sidewalk outside.  Despite the early hour, people still paused, peering in over the top of the ‘closed’ sign and testing the door to see if it was really locked.
Sam sucked in a breath.  “Okay, so if we don’t go back to the movie, things are just going to get worse, so we’re going back there, but we need to talk about this.”
Tony’s head bobbed.  “Do you want to leave?” he asked, and DJ went still.  Tony smiled at him.  “We can.  I came here for you.  I like movies.  I want you to like movies, too.  And if this is-”  He patted the seat next to him, the plush cushion giving easily under his fingers.  “And if this is too much for you right now, than that defeats our purpose for coming here.
Harris looked at the broom in his hand.  “No, uh, no, I’m-”  He looked at her.  “I’m-”  His eyes darted to the side, towards the tray of dirty dishes next to the door.  “Is this the VIP lounge?”
“Don’t go down beneath the hill,” she said, a faint hint of an Irish brogue curling the edges of the words.  She pushed herself upright, reaching for a bottle up on the shelf above her head.  “But if you must, carry cold iron against your breast, and hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.”
“Fuck you,” Clint said, and shut the door with a bang.
“Don’t be,” Steve said, almost smiling at that.  He shifted in his seat.  “In any case, it’s pretty clear he’s come into money lately.”
“It’s like watching a mama bird feed her chick,” Greer said.
“TechWire didn't get it, he's asking-” Tony turned back to the mic.  “Yes.  I am married.  I married Steven Grant Rogers in Symkaria, on our way back from an official trip to Latvaria.”
“He’s not wearing that,” Tony said.  “He’s not wearing that, because despite what he wants all of us to think, he does actually have standards.”
Tony pried open one eyelid, glaring at the blurry, dark form that loomed over him, blocking out the light.  "Steve's couch, actually," he said, yanking the blankets higher up over his shoulder.  "And it's currently in use.  Fuck off."
“Damn straight.  So, you bringing him back to your place?”
“Fine.” His lips went tight, a thin, hard line.   “Here’s a question, Steve.  Would you have arrested Rhodey and Pepper for their marriage?”
“Doesn’t.” Tony agreed.  He scraped a hand over his face.  “Fine.  How do I get better?”
Nothing.
“Another cab,” Tony said, ignoring the way that Steve was clearly trying not to laugh.  Tony glared at him.  “Which I also told you that I’d pay for. Parker.  I told you that five hours ago.”
"Yeah, but that was, what, twelve fifty?  Thirteen dollars?" Tony asked, and it wasn't funny, it really wasn't.  But his voice was warm and familiar and Steve loved him so much it hurt.
"C'mon."  Obie wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders, his fingers almost painfully into Tony's arm.  "Let's go meet our new guest."
“Okay, that’s…  That’s bad, too, you know that, right?” Bruce asked.
“I haven’t decided yet,” Tony said, and he did his absolute best not to let that sound like a lie.  He took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders.  “Look, it’s not-”  He shook his head.  “It’s not a big deal.”
"But you want to," she said.
It wasn’t much.  But it was a victory.
“You know, this is why you can’t make rent.”
“Nothing,” Stark said quickly.  He waved at the sidewalk..  “I’m going to go-
Just a crack, barely an inch, as if someone hadn't quite pulled it shut behind them after walking in.  But it was most certainly open.  From the shelter of the house, Steve eyed it, waiting for someone to realize their error, to appear to push it closed and lock it.
“Because Steve's my friend and you're terrifying,” Sam told her.
Tony paused.  “My…  My what?”
“I don’t suppose we have any leads on that,” Happy said.
“He stayed with you,” Darcy said, her voice thin.  “I-” She gestured at Clint.  “I told him, I saw him walk away with you, right between you and Harris, he was never with us.”
“And you knew you were going to do it, and instead of trying to find a safer, healthier way to deal with your insane need to do something, damn whatever torpedoes are currently in the water,” Stark continued, his voice vibrating with the force of that, “you just…”  He spread his hands wide.  “Did it.”
“Where is he?”
“Charming.”  Tony made a face, then twisted around, his body rolling away from Steve's  “Don't answer that.”
Peter raised one hand in a weak wave.  “Tell her hi for me.”
"Right.  So this was a waste of everyone's time.”  He flipped through the pages to the back of the file.  "But I appreciate the update."
“Steve?”
Through the glass door, Tony watched as Steve handed each of the baristas a bunch of daisies and sunflowers, his face bright with laughter.  “Oh, my God,” Tony said, ignoring the way that his chest ached.  “He is painfully perfect, isn't he?”
Bobbi flicked a strip of apple peel free from the blade of her knife, tossing it in his direction, and it landed squarely on his forehead.  “Can we say we’re more united than we were?”
Clint considered that.  “Okay, one?  The con wasn’t that big.  And two?  SHIELD employs more than half of the people on that list.”
"He is on his way to the roof now," Jarvis said.
Tony considered him.  “You're getting cryptic again.”
“Yes, we have, and yes, we will again.”  Obie leaned back against the desk, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Until I feel that you’re taking the appropriate precautions.”
May wrapped up a fresh turnover in a napkin, holding it out to Tony.  He shook his head, and she scowled at him.  “You need to eat.”
Someone laughed, a laugh that sounded almost like a sob.  No one stopped working.  Across the floor, Bruce kept scrubbing at his station, and Tony was almost certain that he was actually unconscious.  Peter was leaning on his mop, slackjawed and swaying on his feet.  Tony resisted the urge to kick the mop out of his hands, mostly because he didn’t want to pay the workman’s comp claim when the kid faceplanted onto something sharp.  “We’ve still got to set the walk in, Chef.”
He was pretty sure Steve was in shock.
“Likely not, but I do enjoy the attempt,” Thor said.
“We're not having sex in this car,” Steve said, and Tony stripped off his jacket and tossed it over his shoulder.
DJ immediately tried to tuck his bare feet out of sight under the blankets. "No."
He leaned back. “I didn't care about being a symbol, back then. I just wanted to do something big, something important, I wanted to make a difference.” He smiled. “Now, I guess that means being a symbol.”
“The Frenchest,” Tony said, grinning down at his paperwork.  He crossed off a clause in a contract with a heavy hand.
Steve walked around the full perimeter of the grounds twice.  The second loop had been necessary, because after the first one, he realized he had no memory of anything he’d just done.
“She's terrifying and I'm finding I'm okay with that,” he said.  He looked down at the napkin wrapped bundle.  “Wonder if she likes cream puffs.”
"I'm actually surprised he didn't get more," Rhodey said.  He shifted his coffee cup from one hand, and back to the other, his fingers rattling against the porcelain.  "You were gone, Pepper didn't have executive status, I didn't have access, and the board would've done whatever he asked, without question."
Steve smiled at him. “By 'arrangement,' you're referring to my marriage?” he asked. “My marriage to my husband, Tony?”
"Clint?"
Steve stabbed a fingertip against the folder.  "He's been arrested more than a dozen times, sir.  He's got an arrest record longer than half the breadlines in his city.  He got picked up at age eleven for discharging a pistol in the middle of a street fight.  We've got him for bootlegging, attempted murder, half a dozen organized crime rackets-"
“No.” Tony was already shaking his head.  “No.  Absolutely not.  I'm sure that some day, in the far flung future, you'll wear me down and browbeat me into marrying some eligible daughter of some excellent family, but today will not be that day.”
“Anyway,” Carol said, “it DID get turned on and now it’s a hot tub full of bright red, bubbling, viscous liquid.”  She paused.  “That’s when Jess yelled ‘Magma, all in!’ and jumped in fully clothed.”
“No.  But I fake it exceptionally well if there’s a camera in the vicinity,” he admitted.  “Or if I’m drunk.”
Steve sipped his water.  “She'd do it.”
"No, HE is," Tony said.  He pointed a screwdriver at DJ.  "He's Dummy."  Sue looked at him, looked back at DJ.  DJ nodded.  She looked back at Tony.  Tony sighed.  "He's Dummy.  My bot."  He waved a hand at the rest of the workshop.  "You and Butterfingers."  The two bots, busy on the other side of the room, wheeled around at the sound of their names, their cameras coming up.  Tony pointed at DJ.  "And Dummy."
Bruce was still working, his hands fast and steady, the movements practiced, almost unconscious.  “You need to go home.”
"Something's new here," he said instead, because he could bullshit with the best of them.  He braced his hands on the back of the couch, narrowing his eyes at Steve, who just smiled up at him, his expression amused.  Tony leaned in.  "New shirt?"
“First-” Tony stalked around him and grabbed a box from the shelf, tossing it down on the counter.  It bounced hard on the wood, and Hank glared at him.  Tony arched an eyebrow. “That wasn’t flirting.”  Hank snorted, and Tony ignored him.  “Second, yes.”
Carol looked up.  “He’s fine,” she said, heaving a massive chunk of concrete onto her shoulder.
“Give them to other people,” Tony said.  “I don't ever have to deal with them on the long term, Steve, I buy them and then foist them off on someone else.  Let someone else find a vase or, I don't know, this is like having a child that's going to die in three days, this is horrible, you've done a horrible thing.”
“Which is cute,” Natasha said.  “If I couldn’t, then she won’t.”
"No," all three of them said at once, and he subsided back against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest.
Steve choked on his punch, his hand coming up to cover his mouth before he could end up dribbling all the way down his shirt.  “Ah-” he managed.  “That’s a-”  He swallowed.  “That’s a possibility.”
DJ smiled at him, quick and bright, and Tony’s shoulders relaxed.  “But this was her favorite place, in the whole house,” he said.  “She loved it here.  She loved the quiet, she loved the fountain, she loved the fact that it was all hers.”  He closed his eyes, and he could almost hear her, the soft way she laughed, the way she sang, old, old Italian folk songs and the occasional aria.  “I used to sit here, because if I did, I had her all to myself.”
In the bright light of day, it looked almost real, the state seal of Symkaria affixed in the bottom right next to their signatures.  His looked rushed, small, almost embarrassed.  Tony had signed with his usual aplomb, the stroke sweeping across the full length of the line.  Steve's thumb swept over Tony's name, his signature, a faint, unmistakable warmth curling in the pit of his stomach.
“I was trying to be diplomatic.”
“He’s a practical man,” Natasha said with a smile.  “It was there.  He was tired.  Probably seemed almost logical at the time.  He’s a special boy.”
“I'll keep you appraised on both.”
Clint set his knife down.  “When’s the last time they ate?”  he asked.  The boy’s shoulders went straight and tight, his chin coming up, and Clint let out a sigh.  “Right.  Right.”  He reached for a pot on the stove.  “Here’s what we’re going to do.  You’re going to sit, and eat a proper meal.”  He took the lid off, releasing a wave of fragrant, spicy steam, and reached for a ladle.  “And I’ll make up some things for you.”
Tony ignored him.  “Not all of you, of course.   Not even most of you.  But some of you fuckers?  The ones who have a Michelin star or more on the door?  The ones with shiny magazine covers with your smug little faces on it framed in the front lobby?  The ones charging fifty dollars or more a plate for an entree?”
“I’ll tell you later,” Darcy stage-whispered to Neena.
“Right, I’m going to need you all to leave now,” Trip said, “We’re closed.”
Tony’s head was throbbing, the sound of his own pulse a physical force that he couldn’t get away from.  He rolled onto his side, trying to go fetal, and immediately regretted it when his stomach decided to keep right on going.  He gritted his teeth against the rising tide of nausea and regretted that, too, when pain shot through his jaw, and straight into his skull.
“No hospital,” Happy said, sliding behind the wheel.  He waited for Steve to pull his door shut before he started the car.  “The doc stitched him up at home.”
“Then eat a cookie because it’ll settle my nerves,” she said, her voice arch.  She pulled a handkerchief from her purse and started wiping DJ’s face.  “And because DJ was kind enough to give you one.”
Tony's head jerked in her direction.  "Jess?"
“We have a meeting,” the man repeated.  “Hello, Miss Potts.  Mr. Rhodes.  Officer Rogers.”
Steve bit back a smile.  “I take it you don't mind driving it,” he said, his fingers still stroking back and forth over the fender, enjoying the smooth rise of the metal beneath his palm.
“Yes,” Val said.  She frowned.  “And no.”
Tony dropped the phone back into the cradle.  He looked up to find Obie watching him, a strange expression on his face.  Tony smiled at him, his lips thin against his teeth. “Learning from my father’s mistakes,” he said, lowering himself into his chair, bracing his elbows on the top of his desk.  He folded his fingers in front of his mouth. “I overheard a lot of things.”
“Is he all right?”  In the front, a flash of red hair.  Pepper.  She sounded afraid and Tony didn’t understand.  Didn’t know why she sounded afraid.
“No,” Harris repeated.  “I’m not discussing reality tv with you.  Especially not anything involving s-t-a-r-k.”
“Yes, sir,” Tony said.
“Good?” Tony said, and Steve laughed, reaching the bottom of the stairs and turning to wrap his hands around Tony's waist.  “Hi.”
Steve nodded.  “Will you tell me?  If someone comes looking for me?” he asked.
Clint snorted.  “Jesus, wow, no.  I absolutely do not.”  He balanced the box on the palm of one hand.  “But if you don’t want me to wear this one-”
“Art school?” he managed, and Tony was laughing against his throat.  Steve grinned at nothing and everything.  “You making assumptions there?”
“DJ?”
"I may go?" Rogers echoed.  But he did take a step back, and as much as Tony missed the heat of his body, that did make it easier to think.
“No,” Steve said, but Tony was pretty sure there was wiggle room there.  He was grinning as he took a bite of the flatbread stuffed with sausages and a mix of pickled vegetables.  The wax paper wrapping it crackled as he tried to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand without dropping his drink.
"Yes."  Ed grinned at him, one arm braced on the side of the machine.  "I thought you could use the extra kiss up points."
“You and me both,” Tony said.  “I’m…  I’m going to hang up on you now.”
Mesmerizing.
Tony let out a bark of laughter.  “Oh, God, I’m sure he is.”  He handed Rhodey the remains of a screw.  Rhodey looked at the sheared off end and made a face.  “Agreed,” Tony told him.  Then, to Natasha, “How long do we think that’ll keep him busy?”
"She's the one who broke the story."  Marcy paused.  Then, "This story."
She fluttered her eyelashes at him.  "Fine."
“Obie thought it would be a good PR move,” Tony said.
Another long pause.  "Shouldn't you sound happier about that?"
Nicholas’ chin dipped in a nod.  “Unless we can stop them,” he agreed.  He smiled.  “Just like old times, Captain.”
Steve paused.  "Mr. Stark?"
Something in Tony recoiled from that, from Steve being taken away from him, from the idea of being relieved of this burden, physical or emotional or both.  But he was exhausted, and he knew it.  He took a deep breath.  “Thanks,” he said.  But when Sam slid an arm behind Steve's shoulders, helping Tony to lever him up, just far enough so that Tony could slip out from under his weight, his eyes burned.  He ignored that, making sure that Steve was settled back against the pillows before he collapsed into the nearby chair.
Steve sighed.  “No.”  He crouched down next to DJ’s chair, his eyes pained, his mouth a flat line.  “You can fly, though.”
Tony opened his mouth to say something, and Steve's fingers tightened on his.  He was tall and broad and perfect, his pale hair ruffled by the cold wind, his cheeks pink, the red scarf around his neck a spark of color and light in a world that had long since gone dark and gray.
Understanding hit like a brick upside the head.  "He's checking on our kid.”
Steve looked up at him.  It was a long way up.
“I kind of think it is,” Steve said, smoothing his hair back.  His hand might've been shaking.  He chose to ignore that.  “I've never asked anyone to dance.”
Tony considered that.  “I’m going to be honest, Steve.”
“Asleep.”
Steve sank down into a chair.  “You want me to go off on them,” he said.
“Yes, sir.”
Obie’s eyes flicked up towards the ceiling, a beseeching glance at an uncaring God.  “Tony…”
There was a long moment of silence.  “I’m bi,” Jess said.
Tony had so much blood on his hands and he needed to repent.
Tony spins around to find Pepper trotting towards him, files clutched protectively to her chest as she tiptoes around discarded metal parts and tools.
It makes Tony wonder if Sam ever read the first version of the Accords, or if he had just blindly trusted Steve’s judgment as they then went on to prove why such legislations were necessary. Would there ever be a time where the rogues could believe in Tony enough to trust that all he wanted was the best for the Avengers while keeping the public safe?
“Where’s Tony?” Someone - Tony guesses Sam - asks, making Tony’s stomach clench uncomfortably.
"The day can wait." Rhodey deadpans in response, a firmness in his tone that leaves no room for argument. “Tell me about your dream.”
“Tony, Dr. Lee is a highly renowned therapist with a masters and PhD in physcology who’s been recognised as one of the best therapists for patients with PTSD, depression and anxiety.”
Tony raises a half-empty glass of whiskey to his lips in celebration.
“Are you okay? Ton-“
Thank you EVERYONE for your patience, and I hope you enjoy this chapter.
Dated a week before the incident in the bunker, it was a portrait of Bucky.
“What does Dr. Lee know?” Tony scoffs in response.
Let’s ignore the part where I ghosted this story and went on a five month hiatus after posting the FIRST chapter.
“Sir,” FRIDAYS voice cuts through the audio. “They have arrived.”
That’s the only useful comment Steve (or anyone else for that matter) makes. Though Steve has millions of other suggestions and questions, they’re constantly shot down by the lawyers explaining safeguards Tony had worked into the Accords that wouldn't allow said issues.
Why is it that Tony only ever seems to let Steve down?
It makes Tony want to leap into Rogers’ arms and kick him in the balls all at the same time.
“I have to go.”
“This is only a relapse Tony, just a minor setback.” Rhodey swallows, choosing his words carefully. “Remember what Dr. Lee said? The nightmares are supposed to get worse as the days narrow to their arrival. That doesn’t mean you’re not getting better though.”
Tony didn’t cry when he found out his parents died in a car crash and he didn’t cry at their funeral. He didn’t cry in Afghanistan when Yinsen uttered his dying words or when Pepper left him after Ultron. He didn’t cry in that godforsaken bunker as he watched the truth about his parents’ death unfold before his eyes and he certainly didn’t shed any tears over that pathetic excuse of a letter Steve sent him after everything.
Tony’s heart drops. He had really hoped Rhodey hadn’t noticed, Tony didn’t want to disappoint him again.
Growing up with Howard, Tony has only ever known untucked bed sheets, forgotten birthdays and cold, dismissive sighs; so sue him, it still takes Tony a second to differentiate between a look of irritation from concerned eyes.
“What could go wrong?” He finishes with a grand wave of his arms, nearly whacking Dum-E who has rolled closer to the both of them as if wanting to join the conversation.
“Tony?” Steve repeats, sounding concerned. “Are you okay?”.
In Tony's defence, he'd had a particularly awful nightmare. As much as he appreciated and cherished his few yet loyal friends for being there for him during his recovery and relapses and night terrors, they couldn't flush out the deathly chill of Siberian air from his throat and lungs.
“A PhD you say? How big we talking? Because I haven’t seen any action in a long time and it gets quite lonely som--”
Tony doesn’t finish his sentence, instead bites the inside of his cheek and allows Rhodey to fill in the blank. Running a hand over his face, Tony steadies himself and forces a light tone through his teeth.
"I-- look, Rhodey s’not important.” Tony starts with a sigh. “We’ve got a massive day ahe-"
“I’m going to sue you for sexual harassment in the workplace.” He grumbles sourly but Pepper only laughs.
And every now and then all of Tony's reoccurring dreams would combine like some sort of fucked up compilation featuring Maria's crying as a backing track.
“I have another meeting—”
Tony is back in The Cave and he’s surrounded by dead bodies.
“So that’s everything?” Sam asks as their meeting crawls to an end after four intense hours. The disbelief in his voice is insulting like he was half expecting the contract to demand the Avengers to be physically shackled both in and out of combat.
“You don’t say?” He jokes lamely.
As they walk along the corridor, Tony raises a hand to his heart, oddly comforted by the erratic beating under his fingertips. If Tony could fight aliens and robots and super soldiers and make it out alive then he could face the man who had betrayed him in the worst way possible.
“You got my letter?” Steve asks through a strained throat.
For a few seconds, neither of them say anything. Tony takes the opportunity to relish in the quiet company, suddenly aware that this was probably the last time he and Rhodey would share the house together alone.
“Okay.”
Then he remembers how Steve failed to show him a similar mercy back in Siberia when he left Tony for dead, in a foreign country with blood spilling from the gaps in his broken suit. Suddenly Tony’s fingers twitch to throttle Steve instead.
“Talk me through it.” Rhodey prompts gently, laying a reassuring hand on Tony’s sweatpant bound shin. Tony’s eyes dart to the interaction and he tenses as he tries not to flinch.
With that, he turns and makes towards the elevator.
“Good talk, guys.” Tony says, ignoring Sams question. “I’ll add in a passage about stepping into stop small-scale crimes using our own initiative without needing permission and I’ll tweak the wording in a couple of the more tightly bound statements, the vaguer the better.”
Pepper raises an eyebrow, her expression unconvinced. They’ve had this conversation a million times before and it always ends in an argument -- Tony’s sense of responsibility too overbearing for them to ever make progress.
“Tony?”
His eyes are soft around the edges but tough in the middle, a hard glaze layered over his gentle blue pupils. For a second, Tony almost believes the concern in his eyes is genuine.
No, Tony will never be able to trust Steves soft baby blue eyes ever again.
Tony barks a spiteful laugh at that, because does he look okay? but the tightness in his chest causes it to come out in a pained grunt.
“I will make sure Sir showers, Colonel Rhodes.” FRIDAY replies, as reliable as always. “He is in desperate need of one.”
Tony knows he should feel some sort of wicked satisfaction every time his lawyers describe yet another countermeasure put in place to protect the Avengers and their freedom, but he doesn’t. If Steve had just given Tony the chance to explain the Accords back then, if he’d been willing to talk, compromise even — hell if he’d have just listened to Tony then maybe… maybe...
It had been a while since Tony had resorted to the sharp sting of alcohol as a way to cope with his dreams. Had you saw him a year ago you would've found a broken man with scarlet threaded eyes searching for answers at the bottom of a bottle but recently, especially over the last few months, Tony hadn't touched a drop.
The day Tony finally managed to pull himself together enough to clear out Steve’s belongings, however, was the day Tony completely broke apart. Somehow in the midst of sorting through Steve’s room, Tony ended up curled on the floor against the foot of Steve’s bed, tears streaming down his face and convulsions racking his shoulders as he fought for breath. Tony remembers being surrounded by a sea of Steve’s old hoodies with a leather bound sketch book clutched tightly in his hands open on a double page spread of Steve's last entry.
“I never needed you.”
There goes that streak.
Ironic isn’t it? How the Accords, which once destroyed the Avengers, was now the catalyst reuniting them.
Other than that, welcome home.”
“I’ll be up in a minute.” He manages with a forced smile. “I just need a second...”
There is an overwhelming smell of something like iron, subconsciously Tony knows it’s not the metal from his suit.
He ends with another hiccup and smiles sadly at Rhodey who stares back blankly, utterly speechless.
Pepper sends him a questioning look and Tony elaborates.
“If that’s all then I’d best be going--” Tony starts suddenly, pressing his hands flat against the conference table and standing up.
“You know you don’t have to do this for them, Tony.” Pepper begins, as if the thought had never occurred to him before. “You don’t owe them a thing and they don’t deserve your hospitality or forgiveness or-”
“Thanks for waiting.” Tony apologizes, pinching the bridge of his nose and rubbing the inner corner of his eyes. “I didn’t mean to be late, just got caught up in some paperwork and didn’t realise the time.”
The lawyers stand and extend their hands, taking turns to shake everyone's hand -- bar Tony’s of course who instead nods at them in praise. They file from the room one by one leaving the broken Avengers team alone, a zone of no man's land stretching between the two sides now that there were no lawyers sitting in between bridging them together.
Meeting? Therapy?
Natasha cracks a smirk at that.
“I like what you've done with the place.” Steve suddenly bursts, making Tony jump. “The compound suits you, I’m glad you live here now.”
“To talk?” Steve elaborates.
“That’s our cue.” Pepper tells Tony. “C’mon, ladies first.” She swatts Tony’s bum and he glares back at her, bringing a hand to rub at his bruised bottom.
Tony drops his arms sheepishly.
Jumping suddenly, Tony’s hand flails out and knocks over a mug of coffee. It smashes against the stone floor, murky brown liquid spilling everywhere as pieces of broken china scatter across the ground. Dum-E whirrs at the sudden commotion and from the doorway Pepper gasps.
"Morning Rhodes." Tony croaks with a weak smile.
“Anywho,” Tony begins, pulling out a pair of blue tinted glasses and resting them on his nose as he flips the front page of the document that sits in front of him. “Let’s get started.”
“I’m peachy Rogers. Just a busy man with places to be.”
Tony swallows the bile that threatens to spill and forces a tight-lipped grin on his face.
“How’ve you been?”
“I,I I was- euh, I was actually wondering if, if you had a, a spare minute?”
“Siberia.” He mumbles, a small hiccup following shortly after.
“I’m having my publicist drop by on Friday nonetheless. The Avengers don’t need another scandal and after the Civil War? I’ve done enough damage control to last me a lifetime.”
“Whoa whoa whoa, slow down Tony!” Rhodey rushes, interrupting Tony’s spluttering train of thoughts. “What do you mean you’re worried you’re not gonna get better?”
*****
"Anyways, next thing I know, I'm choking on vomit; hence the smell and dirty bed sheets.”
Tony raises a manicured eyebrow in question.
Friends? He remembers the weight of Rogers’ arms around his shoulders, pulling him in for a warm hug on Tony’s birthday. The soft pressure of his fingers on Tony’s back, squeezing tightly and whispering a gentle ‘Happy Birthday Buddy’ in his ear. (Okay, so the ‘buddy’ stung a little but the feeling of Rogers’ calloused fingers rubbing the small of Tony’s back lessened the blow.)
“In an hour which I can’t miss. It’s been a pleasure.” In three swift movements, Tony swipes his Stark laptop and an annotated copy of the accords into his arms, manoeuvres out from behind the table and paces out the room.
Tony was supposed to be a superhero; he was supposed to save lives not take them.
Tony swallows thickly.
Steve reaches out, hands shaking and lips quivering.
Tony's voice breaks and his breathing catches. He presses his lips together and he screws his eyes tightly shut, rogue tears gathering under the dip of Tony’s nose. Rhodey watches with a heavy heart as Tony’s hands go white at the knuckles as his grip on the glass of liquor tightens.
He’s in his workshop, working on a new lightweight frame to replace Rhodeys current leg braces when the hum of a car engine fills Tony’s speakers. He glances up from the holotable, looking over at his desk of monitors where he finds a live camera feed of the front doorstep.
There goes that irony again.
“But, but,” Steve’s breath catches and he licks his lips nervously, confusion rippling across his features. “But you never called.”
“I- I.. yo-you…” Steve splutters, Tony’s bluntness catching him off guard. “I-I euh, I just… are you-you okay? Y-you left in a rush.”
The stuttering draws Tony's attention and from his buckled position, Tony takes the opportunity to steal a sly glance at the super soldier.
“Sure you do.”
Surprisingly, they manage to have a somewhat productive meeting. That’s not to say it was a breeze because the three hours that they sit together and discuss the contract are the three most rigorous and repetitive hours of Tony’s life. The come away from the meeting is that Tony needs to sneak in some sort of vague statement that allows the Avengers to step into street scale crimes without having to wait for a green light from the UN.
There is such a defeated rawness to his words as if the thoughts had been festering under Tony’s tongue like soiled feelings.
“Are you okay?” The concern in her voice snaps Tony into action and he puts out a hand in front of him so that Pepper doesn’t come any closer.
Steve’s face drops and so does his heart.
“My memory gets a bit foggy and the dream goes hazy for a while, but then suddenly everything clears and all I can see is... Rogers -- he's on top of me smashing his fists into my mask, slamming the shield into my chest over and over, driving it all the way home even though I've --"
Teammates? Tony remembers the elation and happiness that surrounded him after the team successfully completed their first mission together. How he met Rogers’ eyes from across the room and sent a cheeky wink his way as the others popped a bottle of champagne and celebrated.
“Welcome back Avengers.” Tony swallows after a moment of heavy silence. “It’s been a while since we’ve all been together but I’m glad that you’re back.”
“I only have your best interest at heart, Sir.”
The Avengers were not his family, never were and never will be.
Rolling his eyes as Pepper reaches out to pet Dum-E, Tony’s slightly miffed that his bots seem to enjoy Peppers company more than his. Perhaps it was a running theme in the Stark family for sons to hate their fathers.
“I just… feel like everything around me is going a million miles a minute and I can’t keep up. Things were improving for a while but… I can feel myself getting bad again.”
The car rolls to a stop and four black doors open as one by one the people he once called family step out and onto the pavement. They look harmless on screen, like action figures scuttling about trying to balance suitcases on top of each other as if they’re playing a game of tetris, but Tony knows better than to fall for their domestic display.
Steve won’t find his Brooklyn hoodie or sketchbook, even if he checks in the basement, but Tony decides this fact is better off unspoken -- he’d rather not reveal their location at the bottom of his bedside draw.
Across the corridor lies Steve, angry red flesh screaming through the holes in his old navy hoodie; on Tony’s hand, his watch is missing and instead an iron fist clads his knuckles.
Meeting? Therapy.
It's been so long since Tony last heard Steve’s voice, he’s forgotten the effect it has on him. There’s a silkiness that laces Steve’s tone, the same gentleness that used to bring Tony down to his knees. It’s soft and curls around him like a blanket of comfort, invading his senses, helping him draw in cold air through his nostrils and clearing his clouded vision.
“FRIDAY, get Steve to the infirmary.”
“Probably not.” On stage, Steve seemed to be about three seconds from tossing Morrison out of the nearest window. Tony wouldn't have blamed him. “I married that.”
Tony waited, his face expectant.  “And?”
Harris looked at DJ.  “There?”  DJ nodded, and Harris nodded back.  “Right.  There.”
“Jarvis and I showed him the house yesterday,” Pepper said.  “But he's-”  She took a deep breath.  “He's just gone.”
You could fight a lot of things.  But when he fell in love, it seemed like a thing that was always going to happen.  Regular as sunrise.  Natural as the rains.
“That it is,” Bobbi said.  “So.  It was odd.  That starting the night Mr. Stark was shot, the Nomad seemed to refocus his attentions.  Almost exclusively to rooting out the most dangerous elements of the anarchist groups.  Most people don’t believe the rumors, of course.  A single man?  Going after groups like that?”
"I'm pretty certain this isn't actually edible," Steve said.
DJ dabbed another bit of blue, and swirled it into the white glaze.  “Hilma af Klint,” he explained.
“And that has been what I’ve done, ever since.  I’ve given you structure, and stimulation, and a sense of purpose.  I’ve given you a home.”  He set his napkin down.  “That was all I could do, Anthony.”
Tony nodded.  “I knew.  I knew that they-” He swept his thumb across the back of Steve’s hand.  “It was different, though, seeing them with him.”  He looked up at Steve.  “The kid can fly.”
Stark stopped, casting a glance back over his shoulder in Steve's direction.  “Your men have already been up there.”
Steve nodded. "We're still going to do it."
"You seem to think that Tony drinks stronger stuff than Reed, and I can assure you, that is not true."  She nodded, just once, and then a second time.  "Yes.  Thank you.  I'd love a drink.  And more than that, I'd love a chance to talk to someone who isn't-"  She shook her head.  "Who is willing to discuss it."
Tony took a step back, his hand falling away, and Steve swayed on his feet, chasing the contact like he needed it to live.  His head snapped up, his eyes meeting Tony's.  “Right,” Tony said.  His head bobbed in a slight nod, his lips kicking up in a wry, sharp smile.  “Right.  This isn't going to work.”
Sam blinked at her. “I'm not his therapist,” he said.
“I won’t, I won’t,” Tony muttered, jamming the tool between his teeth.
The faint, almost invisible swirl of light played around his fingers, floating upwards like glowing, dissipating smoke.  Frowning, DJ shook out his hand, scattering the last bits of power.  “Not what-”  The magic, freed from his control, continued floating upwards, swirling through through the air.
“Go,” Steve said, and Carol spun in mid-air, shooting downwards in a flat dive, her fists held out in front of her.  Tony was right behind her, close enough to dodge the debris she kicked up when the roof of the warehouse exploded outwards from the force of her entry.
She blinked up at him, all huge, dark eyes.  “Yes, sir?”
There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line.  "Hello to you, too," Tony said, his voice wry.  "How are you?  Having a nice evening?  Enjoying yourself?"
“I never want breakfast,” Tony said, throwing an arm over his face.  “Let’s just stay here and open presents in bed.”
“Yes, sir.”  Easier than the rest, there’d been nothing wrong with it, other than Justin’s general incompetence.  Not that he’d ever point it out, since ‘Justin says it can’t be fixed’ was about half of his jobs these days.
“Double fisting chocolate corn dogs!” Clint told her with a wide grin.  "Keep objecting and I'll end up like Wolverine with a corn dog between each finger."
Pepper caught his other arm, the cup clattering to the floor.  “Tony, he’s fine.  He’s upstairs with May and Peter.  Natasha is keeping an eye on all of them.” He stared at her, and Pepper gave him a slight, tired smile.  “He’s safe.  Natasha won’t let anyone near him.  You know that.”  Her fingers squeezed tight, half comfort, half warning, and then she released him, leaning over to pick up the cup. “You’re the only one who’s hurt, Tony.  Everyone else is just fine.”
