Head Coach Nick Fury has made several strategic moves during both the offseason and preseason transaction windows to shore up the New York Avengers at several key positions.  The late-preseason addition of linebacker Bruce Banner and the return of a healthy James Barnes at cornerback make this defensive secondary a force to be reckoned with.  Banner’s impressive leaps and heavy hits have made him a household name in New York, and Barnes has built his reputation on precision pass sniping on both mid- and long-range throws, to say nothing of the rest of the defense.  On offense, a solid receiving corps, led by the veteran signee T’Challa Udaku, and a sharpshooting kicker in returner Clint Barton makes an impressive statement about the Avengers’ ability to put points on the board.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve murmured along with the rest of the rest of them, but he spoke the words through bloodless lips.
A conversation he’d had with his mom when she’d come home for the last time jumped into his head.  She’d been sitting in the front room, rail thin and wearing a sweater even as the June heat crept through the windows and made Steve sweat.  He’d sat with her on the couch and let her rest her head on his shoulder while he did some reading for summer school, and when she hadn’t been looking at him, he’d finally worked up the nerve to say the one thing he knew he’d regret hiding from her.
He followed Fury out of the locker room and down the hall to the coaches’ suite on numb legs.  Practice squad relegation, waivers, cuts, and the repercussions of all three flicked through his head in quick succession like someone flipping too fast through a PowerPoint slideshow.  No matter what, he’d call Natasha as soon as they gave him his walking papers.  Get her advice on how to proceed.
Steve pulled the hat on and took the shoulder of the number ten jersey Fury passed him then turned a confident smile towards the press pool.  The cheering from the stands set up on the Strip exploded around them along with the flashbulbs from the press pit. In his pocket, Steve could feel his phone vibrating over and over with incoming messages.
“Boys,” Phillips barked, “now we got too much time left to just let this one go, so when we go out there, I need you to move that ball just four more yards.  We’re gonna keep it on the ground, so it should be next to impossible to screw up. Give me those four yards, and we’re takin’ home a shiny trophy that’ll have all y’all’s lip prints on it for the rest of time.”
Steve and Sam shoved the food they’d brought into the already stuffed fridge then Steve hauled the cooler out back himself when Hopkins grabbed Sam by the shoulders and introduced him to his mother.
Steve shook his head against the arc reactor.  “Nah.  The garden center didn’t carry them regularly, and I’da had to order it.  I got her a new copy of her favorite book.  Her old one had fallen apart a couple months earlier, and she hadn’t had time to go get a new one.”
Tony flapped his hand dismissively.  “They only want me there for the first round.  Bring out all the flash for the top prospect.” He smirked.  “Make you feel like you’re going somewhere worth being.”
“It’s fine with us,” he said back into the phone.  He listened for a moment then nodded. “Sure. See you in a bit.”  Dum Dum hung up and pocketed his phone. “Bucky’s on his way with whatever Monty said you needed from Target and Lowes, lunch, and our boss’s boss’s boss.”
Pietro shook his head.  “We’ve found basic human decency carries the day rather well in the wake of injuries like this.  They’ll be fishing, but from everything I’ve seen, you’ve got a canny nose for their bait.”
When Bucky didn’t say anything else, Steve sat back and forced himself to relax as he watched the pack of players’ kids running around the back yard.  The eight or so who looked elementary aged were playing freeze tag, and one of the boys looked like he’d made it his mission to knock as many kids off their feet as he could when he crawled under their legs to unfreeze them.
Sharon clicked on something on her laptop.  “Okay.  Make sure you let my team know if you get one; we can help you get verified.  Anything I need to know about you that hasn’t come up yet?  Anything you think could become a Story on ESPN?”
As the offense trotted off the field at the end of warmups, Sam jumped against Steve, knocking into him with his shoulder pads.  “You two are disgusting, you know?”
“Since I was a rookie, yeah,” Steve agreed under the buzz of the first strokes of ink into his skin.
Tony looped his arm through Steve’s elbow and rolled his eyes.  “Of course not.  But you know I don’t only travel in vehicles that I drive.”
“Easy.  Done.”  He pointed at the Rolls Royce Phantom idling in the driveway by the athletes’ entrance.  “Let’s go home.”
“It--I…” Tony blushed as he met Steve’s eyes then looked down, suddenly shy.  “I wanted people to see something besides a self-absorbed asshole when they looked at me.”
She started flipping through the hard copy of the document he’d been reading and rereading and discussing with her for weeks.  “So I know we talked about this already, but are you sure you don’t want any sort of Combine prep?”
“Why did you decide to draft a quarterback in the first round when you have Fitzsimmons signed already?” a man from ESPN asked.
“Taking some boxes to donate, some to recycle, and bringing us back lunch,” Steve shaded his eyes and squinted up at Monty.
“I wanted breakfast for dinner and I needed to clean some about-to-go-bad veggies out of the fridge.  So, frittata.”  Steve put his phone down and glanced back over his shoulder.  “Don’t feel like you have to wait on me to eat.”
Steve shook his head.  “Nope.  Team agreement.  When we won, we’d get the number.”  He took a breath, steadying himself.  “I’ve been planning something else too, so it just made sense to wait till the end of the season.”
Carol trotted up to them and fell in step as they continued towards the locker rooms.  “Fury’s gonna want you at the podium after he does his postgame.  So get in there, get cleaned up, and get yourself ready.”
Steve nodded, a slow smile creeping across his face.  “That sounds...really nice.  I want to do all that with you too.”  He took a breath.  No time like the present for honesty.  “I know all the...implications of a third date, but I’m...I don’t know if I’d be ready--”
Steve picked up his father’s compass and clipped it to the watch chain before slipping it into his vest pocket.  He finished attaching the chain to his vest before he turned to face his now former coach. “I won’t embarrass you too much, d’you think?”
“You’re a heathen,” Tony said with a laugh.  He dug in his back pocket and produced his phone.  “I was gonna call Happy and have him take us...well, he can take us wherever we want to go.”
Less than an hour later, Steve followed Tony and a TopGolf employee through a packed building and up to a suspiciously primo bay on the third tier, only half paying attention as the young lady explained how to swipe into the computer and how the different games worked.
Once Tony was gone, Steve sighed.  This had been nice.  More than, really, but he couldn’t just play around and just...ignore the consequences.  Sharon and Natasha’s warnings about avoiding off-field drama reared up and blocked out everything else.  He rolled over until he was face down on the couch and groaned into the cushions.  Hooking up with a man, the man who owned his team no less, would definitely complicate his on-field life.
“Why are we being quiet?” Tony poked his head out the library door as Steve turned to finish locking up.
“If it’s that place on Washington, I think I got their classic sandwich every day during summer two-a-days in high school.”
Phillips rolled his eyes and shoved Steve towards the field house.  “Go. Talk to her. Charm her like I know you can.”
Steve flapped a hand at him, and Sam rolled his eyes before disappearing back upstairs.  A quick smell and wrinkle check and Steve decided he could just re-wear his clothes from last night’s date. Instead of immediately heading to get ready, though, he sank down on the edge of his bed and stared at his phone.  The red 5 on his text app glared up at him.  He knew he’d have to face Bucky eventually, in person if not over the phone, so a flick and a tap later, and now anyone could get through to him again.  He scrolled past the string of messages Bucky had sent him yesterday afternoon and evening and jumped straight into the avenue of conversation least likely to involve yesterday at the park.
“Now can we tweet this?” one of them asked.  Between her smile and her voice, Steve pegged her as Dolores from the Bark N’ Purr rescue group.
“Definitely,” Steve said, a small smile tugging the corner of his mouth.  He’d loved vanishing into the crowd, and being able to do it with Tony had been even better.  He’d felt his age, if only for an hour, while they’d exchanged drives and trash talk and not even their bay attendant had recognized either one of them, even though the Draft was on every screen in the complex.
Nine picks later, Eisen announced that New York was now on the clock, and the simulcast screens switched to a display of the Avengers’ draft committee switching between laptops and phones in their suite at the top of the Bellagio.
Wanda nodded.  “Exactly.  So it’ll be some of that, but it’ll also be a chance for us--” she gestured between herself and Sharon, “to get a handle on
“Okay, last thing,” she shook her head down at the page in front of her.  “You refused the agency’s line of credit for post-draft, pre-contract expenses.”
“In here,” Fury gestured to the door of his own office.  He pointed at the chair across from his desk.  “Have a seat.”
However, in the rush of getting ready the next morning, Steve didn’t notice which clothes Tony threw on until the Iron Man suit was closing around his body.
“Hey, Mr. Rogers,” Peter said from down on the floor where he was examining the open front of the copier.  “You need help with something?”
“This’ll probably just be some softball stuff,” Stark said as they trailed the stage manager back into the press area.  “You have a place in New York? I’ve got a realtor who’s worked with our guys. I mean, you don’t
“Do you have any work clothes I could borrow?”  Tony asked as he bent at the waist to peer at the engine Steve had finished since Tony had last come over.
He smiled thinly.  “He only said you worked for an old friend of his.  But since it’s December and I’m a senior, I can guess.”
A quick word about the Draft itself...there’s A LOT of wheeling and dealing that goes on behind the scenes with trading draft spots, trading picks ahead of those picks actually happening.  Not to mention the actual bargaining for contract terms that happens after a selection occurs.  I’ve stripped that WAY back because, let’s be real, we care about Steve getting drafted onto the team Tony owns.
Steve shook his head as he silenced his alarm.  “I’m a terrible multitasker.  No, it’s time for me to start getting ready for bed.”
“Coding for what?” Steve asked idly as he pulled up the run offense section of the playbook.  He started drawing the offense’s lineup before reaching into the bowl he had sitting on the table under the white board.  3-4 nickel.  He hated nickel packages; it always felt like there were twelve defenders in a nickel read.
Thor beamed.  “I was indeed.  Guard. Unfortunately, cap space is a difficult thing on a team with so many veterans, so I decided to seek my fortunes elsewhere.  I’m pleased to meet so many new offensive hires since we’ll be working together.”
He shook his head, trying to jar himself loose before he could wander too far down that particular path.  “That way lies madness,” he murmured. When he got to their film theater, he tapped on the door before just barging in; it wouldn’t do to startle whoever this was, after all.
As Rich Eisen announced that Cincinnati was on the clock, Steve finally spotted Sam sitting a few tables away and caught his eye to wave.  Sam waved back, grinning at him.
“Smart man,” she allowed.  “He’s not alone in thinking that.  Quite a few people think you’ve got what it takes to lead a professional club, potentially as a franchise quarterback, individual collegiate accolades or no.  My boss agrees, and he sent me to see if we could negotiate for your representation.”
Steve glanced up at Tony and brushed his now sweaty bangs off his forehead.  “You expecting an attack?”
Steve felt his smile broaden into something genuine.  “Thank you, Bucky. I really appreciate all your help.”
He rolled his eyes.  “But, I can see the ways you two make each other stupid.”  He wrapped an arm around Steve and squeezed his shoulders.  “Just be careful.”
Out in the hall, Steve forced himself to walk at a normal person pace until he was back in the central atrium.  He really didn’t want to start his relationship with someone who seemed to have his best interests in mind by lying to her, but Natasha had been right.  He was here now, and he would try not to rock the boat.  Although his texts with Tony, which had become a nightly event even after only a week, were making that hard.
He jumped up and flipped the ball to the ref then ran to meet Steve as he was running forward to the new line.  Steve wrapped him up in a rib cracking hug. “You did it!”
“You have double jointed elbows?” Sam asked then immediately grimaced as Steve started shaking out his arms.  “Ugh!  No!  Don’t
“Just like we discussed,” Steve said as he got comfortable.  “I sent you the image of the logo while we were on the phone so you could pull what you needed.”
Phillips sniffed once loudly.  “Now don’t get like that, Rogers.  Go hang around with those silly receivers of yours.  Act your age for once.” He turned and handed the coaches’ trophy to their blindside linebacker, giving Steve an out to slip back to his friends.
They all took seats in front of the Avengers backdrop and representatives from the press immediately crowded around.
“I...look...I already know I’ll have to work.  Whether it’s in the playbook, on the board, or on the house.”
Steve stared at her, at a bit of a loss.  He’d been so sure he’d been brought to Fury’s office to get cut that he needed a moment to readjust his thinking away from
Bucky’s arm around his shoulder stopped Steve from trying to go help find his own Clorox.  “Best to just let us help, don’t you think?” he asked with a grin.
the tower,” he finally said.  “No, I’m--no.  I’m out in the boroughs checking on some of the new signees.  Making sure they don’t want to run for the hills after the first week.  I have a car.  I’ll finish up and head that way.  Yes, I
Sharon turned her attention back to him as Wanda slipped out of the room, presumably to finish whatever she was posting about him on Instagram.  “Now, Steve, there’s a few things I need to know, just so I’m aware of all the pieces on the board, okay?”
to handle.  You should not be doing any of the sorts of things that will make ESPN want to single you out in a negative, or even gossipy, way.  Any coverage like that will almost certainly have consequences for your career. Am I clear?”
Out on the street, the night was still muggy, and Steve made a face as the warm, humid air bogged him down after the crisp coolness of the Tower’s air conditioning.  He hustled down to Grand Central and about fainted when he got down onto the platform right as his train pulled in.  He settled himself in one of the rear-facing seats, still just as enchanted at 24 with the feeling of riding backwards as he had been at 6, and pulled out his phone and headphones.  He pressed play on the album Tony had picked and let the oddly soothing tracks of Imperial Bedroom and the rhythm of the 4 train carry him back to Brooklyn.
“Rumor has it you traded up to get this pick, any worries about how that could impact your effectiveness in later rounds, Ms. Potts?” another man, this time from Fox Sports jumped in.
Wanda had snapped a few pictures while they’d talked, mostly, Steve noticed, when they could coax him into a smile or actual laughter.  They were good at their job, putting Steve more at ease than most of the interviews he’d been a part of since he’d started playing college ball, but this was, at its heart, facetime with the media, so Steve kept his answers carefully “camera ready.”
Steve nodded and smiled a little sadly down at her.  “I get it. Sometimes you hafta play the game with house rules.”
She blinked a couple times, clearly aware he’d brushed her off, but she also knew she couldn’t press him without looking like she was digging for a scoop. She finally settled on “Enjoy your win.”
The spotlight flashed on, she turned on bright media smile and started speaking.  “So, Steve, congratulations on this win. What were your thoughts in that final minute?”
“You do realize I’m in the process of ramping up to eating 3500 calories a day, right?”  Steve asked, even as he rotated his plate back around so Tony could reach. “Everything I put on the plate’s gotta go in the body.”
Steve shrugged.  “Probably.  I took a nasty hit in the Sugar Bowl that had me seeing stars for a few downs.  She had front row seats that year, so I can’t imagine she was thrilled.”
Interestingly, the Avengers’ biggest weakness, although ‘question’ might be more accurate, comes at quarterback.  While veteran Ryan Fitzsimmons is a steady hand on offense, rumors of a nagging knee injury have overshadowed his performance in the preseason.  A veteran offensive line with franchise tag Volstagg at center and returner M’Baku backed up by Thor, who puts on the Avengers uniform for the first time in his career, cannot stop every sack, so it is a question of when, not if, Fitzsimmons will go down hard.  If his knee turns into an issue that keeps him from starting in the regular season, the new question becomes whether rookie backup Steve Rogers is up to the challenge.  With a journeyman who looks to be on his last legs backed up by an untested rookie, there is a lot that needs answering at this, arguably the most pivotal, position.
Tony snuck his fingers up under the hem of Steve’s shirt as he nodded.  “I’ve always appreciated a good visual.”
“Well, thank you.” Steve said.  He glanced up at the man standing behind her, clearly pleased as punch, and smiled at him too.  He looked back down at Ashleigh. “Thank your daddy too.”
The door banging open downstairs cut across Steve’s reply, and Bucky’s shouting traveled up the stairs. “Food and the boss are here.  Get washed, ya pigs.”
Steve shoved his tablet back into his backpack then hustled to get out of the car and catch up with Sam.  “So if you knew I was in Midtown, why the freakout?”
Steve nodded, feeling slightly trapped, and accepted the business card she passed over.  He tucked it into his phone case.  “I’m--I’ll spend some time on your website, and then, maybe, send you an email?”
“Steve Rogers?” A woman in a snappy red sheath stopped Steve with a gentle hand on his arm.  “I’m Margaret Carter with the USO.  Your agent, Mis Romanoff gave me your name.”
“I think there’s a difference between ideal physics and practical physics,” Steve replied through his laughter.  “‘Least that’s what Dallas, my old center, would tell me.”
Steve shook his head with a sheepish smile.  “That moment by itself was scarier than the actual ride.”
“You think she can lift that?” Steve murmured to Dallas as the spindly woman from the committee reached out to present Coach Phillips with the Rose Bowl Trophy.
“As practical as that solution sounds, I can really only go with someone who wants to work with me,” Steve pointed out.  He pulled the box he’d been using the last four years for German flashcards out of his desk. Behind each lettered divider, the nouns, adjectives, and verbs had all given way to a host of business cards, each from someone who claimed they’d be able to make him a household name in the NFL.  They each represented a clamor for his attention that grated on him and made his palms sweat whenever he opened the box. “What’s his name? I’ll see if I’ve heard from him.”
Bucky waved him off.  “Everyone knows Fitzy bashed up his knee in college.  ‘S why he’s always kinda hung around as a journeyman but has never really become, y’know…a household name.”
“Well as much as I want to continue this...decidedly weird and oddly helpful conversation, it’s getting close to that time, boys,” Steve said with a nod at his alarm clock as their laughter faded into occasional chuckles.
Steve shrugged, a small, self-deprecating smile on his face.  “Grew up in Brooklyn. Makes me a pretty easy sell on that one, honestly.”
Steve shrugged.  “I guess so.”  He caught sight of Christine Everheart interviewing Brock on the far sideline.  “How long do we have to stay out here?”
That night, Brennan and Devin, two of his receivers, burst into Steve’s room, all boisterous greetings and friendly slaps to his shoulder.  Their arrival also had the blessed result of stopping him from fiddling with his digital portfolio for probably the tenth time.
Tony rolled back over, and Steve kept pushing them slowly with his foot as they settled into a hazy calm, lulled by the occasional chirp of an insect and the slow rock of the swing.  “Will you tell me something unedited?” Steve murmured.
Steve watched the side of Bucky’s upturned face for nearly a full minute before he felt like he could take a full breath.  He coiled up tighter, willing his breathing to remain steady as he pulled his phone out.  He smiled at the text Tony had sent so late last night it had actually tipped over into early morning.
“Sorry.”  Tony smiled sheepishly from where he stood in the doorway, four glasses in his hands.  “Didn’t mean to startle you.” He nodded down at the glasses. “Where?”
“Take your helmet off.  Get ready to talk to those reporters,” Phillips ordered gruffly.  “You know those media types don’t like to wait on their story”
Tony’s hand had wandered down to his belt and he’d pulled the tongue through the buckle and he flapped it idly while he pretended to think.  “So I was thinking, again, hypothetically, that it might be nice...easy on your chest...to lay you out and attempt to suck your brain out through your dick.”  He grinned, unbearably smug, up at Steve.  “Thoughts?”
Steve laughed and let himself be pulled back towards the penthouse.  “This isn’t your smoothest move.”
When he got to Prospect Park on Friday morning, Bucky and Gabe both trotted over to greet him, dogs on leashes already with them.
Steve tore the baguette from his sandwich in two and pushed half towards Tony.  “I think so. No way to know for sure until it happens though.”
Y'all who are reading this and leaving comments and kudos and telling me how much you love this give me life and so much happiness.  This is such a great group of fans to write for, y'all, I swear.
Sam laughed softly.  “I mean other people.”  He squeezed Steve’s shoulders one more time.  “I’m going to bed.  Don’t wake me up with any noises I can’t unhear or I’ll make sure Cage takes it out on you in the weightroom tomorrow.”
He and Bucky eventually trailed after the upstairs crew up to the second floor to make a start on the bedrooms, but Steve had to pull up when Bucky stopped at the top of the stairs, staring at the stuff Steve had brought back from Austen lining the hallway.  Bucky pointed to the two closed doors and asked, “So which room’s yours?”
Steve stared down at his hand where it rested next to Tony’s on the bar.  The cool stone made his palm feel clammy.  “I think…” he sighed and looked up to meet Tony’s gaze.  “I know you and I are the only ones who know, but I--I think...I don’t want to look at myself and see a liar anymore.”
She laughed.  “Smooth, Rogers.  You’ll go far with lines like that.”  She pulled a folder with his name on it out of her bag.  “Quick bit of business, then I’ll get out of your hair.”
Remember how I told you waaaay back in chapter what-the-fuck-ever that NFL players are required to make themselves available to the media every damn day?  I sure hope so :)
He motioned Tony inside, then turned to head back to the library to get his ‘book’ work for the day started.  “I didn’t think you’d be here so early.  You sure didn’t make yourself sound like a morning person when we were talking earlier this week.”
In the silence that followed, the occasional squeak of his markers and the steady clack of Tony’s keyboard settled Steve into his head enough so he could actually concentrate.  Working his way through the run plays, Steve started to pick up the pattern to Fury’s play design, and he wondered if there were specific collections of plays he liked to run against individual teams.  A question for Monday, he supposed.
Rashad nodded as he passed Steve’s parts over.  “You keep doin’ what you’re doin’, and you’ll make all of Brooklyn proud, kid.”
“So, if this is a date,” Steve said, deliberately ignoring Tony’s bait.  He’d felt like they’d been circling around this very thing, and he wanted it.  Good God he wanted it.  He dropped onto the couch in the front room then patted the cushion next to him.  “Can I ask you something?”
Instead of going for the WiFi password right away, though, Tony came and stood next to Steve and picked up the little green tupperware sitting next to the bowl of defensive schemes.  “I recognize this.”
Steve nodded and hung his bag in his locker without bothering to change.  He thought the notes he’d gotten from Fury that morning had been positive, but maybe they’d been looking for him to do more.  Be better.  He looked at Bucky for an answer, but Bucky just shrugged helplessly at him.
“Says you,” Clint retorted.  “I just get to pound field goals and PATs and nobody’s really trying to block anything yet.”
Tony nodded.  “When I bought the ‘32 roadster, she was an absolute mess.  The tires looked like a dried up riverbed.  Is that what you had here?”
“You’re a good quarterback.  You know this game and you know these guys.”  He clasped his hand around Steve’s neck where it poked out from his shoulder pads.  “Make us proud.”
“Huh? Oh, yeah.”  He reached out and flicked the edge of the card they’d found that poked fun at his refusal to engage with social media.
Bucky squinted up at him with a smile.  “Of course.  Hey, come over anytime after 11 tomorrow.  We’re gonna fire up the grill kinda early so folks with kids’ll have time to eat and play and still get home at a decent hour.”
I’ve already told you both those things.  I would eventually like to spend time with you with no clothes on too, but, well, I’m
He reached out and slipped his hand into Tony’s, smiling when Tony’s face lit up.  It was, he realized, the first time he’d reached out for Tony instead of the other way around.  “All that relationship stuff comes when you’ve got the right person.  They see you.  You see them.”
“Wicked’s right,” Steve murmured.  He pointed.  “Desk’s all yours if you want it, but I can clear the coffee table off too if you need more space.”
“Sure.”  He glanced sidelong at Tony.  “You can pick, though.  Apart from the sandwiches from Lady Ace we got last weekend, I usually just cook for myself.”
Back on the field with only 15 minutes to make something, anything, happen, the offense had to buckle down.  “We know Rollins,” Steve reminded them in the huddle.  “We’ve watched this defense work all afternoon.”
“Sorry, Coach,” Steve replied.  “Won’t happen again.” He waited until Phillips turned to the o-line to remind them that they knew how to create creases and blew Jamaal a kiss back.
“It did,” Steve agreed as he started remounting the handlebars.  “Have you ever seen tires with dry rot?”
Steve used the leverage from his arms still wrapped around Tony to flip them on the couch, smiling brightly when Tony barked out a surprised laugh.  “You know damn well what I mean.”
Steve nodded down at his still-clenched hands.  “And I...I know who I am and what I want, but...” he looked up at Tony, his eyes begging him to hear him.  “I want you to know it too.  From me.  Not someone else.”
Steve nodded.  Ms Hill looked like she was the kind of no-nonsense who could subdue even the rowdiest players without breaking a sweat.
Steve set down his fork and clasped his hands on the bartop.  “One of my receivers at Texas...his guilty pleasure TV show was
Steve turned to the GM as she reached to pin an Avengers lapel pin to his suit.  “Thank you for this opportunity, ma’am.”
“Abraham Erskine?” Steve asked.  He drummed his fingers on the top of the box while his mind raced ahead.  If Dev’s cousin was so thrilled with him, surely Natasha merited a closer look.
Natasha nodded down at her phone, but caught his eye and quirked an approving smile at him.  She’d told him she was going to start smacking him with a rolled up newspaper if he didn’t start at least pretending to be more personable about answering these sorts of questions.  She’d finished that particular lesson with “I do not represent Marshawn Lynch for a reason.”
In this universe, the West Side Stadium is a thing that happened once Tony bought the Jets and rebranded them, so the Avengers have their own home stadium.  Let’s be honest, Tony Stark would not stand for a team he owns to have to share a home stadium.  “But they were practicing across from MetLife!” I hear you shriek.  Yes, this is so.  The proposed footprint for West Side Stadium wouldn’t have fit a practice facility too, and the Avengers would’ve been using those facilities before Tony bought them anyway because as the Jets they would have been sharing MetLife and as a result their practice facilities would be more convenient to MetLife.  I’m telling you all this so you know I do actually believe in continuity and that I didn’t just yeet my story into a settings abyss.
"You're a tease," Tony said.  "I'll say goodnight for now, but I'm going to be waiting on the follow-through from that warning."
Tony nodded.  “You’re sorry you said it.  I’m sorry for making you feel like shit over something little.  Fair enough?”
, back down his shaft until Steve could feel his throat squeezing the head of his dick.  Steve’s orgasm boiled up from the base of his spine until his shoulders lifted fully off the bed with the force of the aftershocks that rolled through him for what felt like a small eternity.
Natasha took her suitcase in one hand and his arm in the other and steered them towards reception.  “Yeah, Steve, your mom must be so proud.”
Tony’s sigh sounded like Steve was both preciously innocent and simultaneously the trial of his life.  “What are we doing here?”
A flicker of motion at the edge of Steve’s attention had him glancing over to the door where Sharon Carter gently tapped her watch then made a ‘wrap it up’ gesture.  Steve breathed a sigh of relief, and Fitz smiled generously at the assembled media reps as they stood.  “We really appreciate your interest in how we’re developing as a team.  I have to say, I can’t wait for Sunday.  We’re gonna have a great season.”
Steve offered him a small smile.  “Just...reminding myself I deserve to want things.  That I don’t belong solely to my job.”
Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket, and a few quick taps later, he held it to his ear.  He shot Steve a grin while he waited for the call to connect.  “You trust me?”  Steve nodded right as Tony shifted his attention to whoever had picked up the phone.  “Raven?  Can you do me a favor?  I need some food this afternoon.  No, just me,” he stopped partway down the hall and glanced back at Steve.  Wary.  “And a date.”
“Not a baby,” Steve muttered, ignoring the second half of Bucky’s statement in favor of being disagreeable.
A chorus of hoots and howls from his teammates rained down on Steve as he mounted the stage to shake hands with the committee members and accept the MVP trophy.
“I’m afraid to let you touch anything back here,” he mumbled with another glance at that pristine suit before turning back to his diagram to see where he’d left off.
Hours later, after another interminable round of interviews and photographs and after Phillips had handed him the game ball to go with his new MVP trophy, calling Steve “the best damn thing the state of New York ever produced,” Steve sat in the overstuffed armchair in his hotel room tired but unable to settle himself down to actually sleep. So instead he sat in the dim light of the reading lamp cradling the game ball loosely in his arms, letting its significance slip through him in the quiet.
Sharon laughed brightly.  “Everyone says that after their first week with him.  He’s cut player time in medical down by more than half, though, so he must be doing something right.”
“I--oh Jesus, sorry, that was an awkwardly long handshake,” Scott said, and he released Steve like he’d been burned.  “Sorry. It’s just--I watched your game--your last game--your bowl game.” He took a breath. “You were amazing.”
“Yeah, you had guys who ran routes in the fall and ran decathlon in the spring.  Which they’d probably been doing since junior high.  You did not have big, Nordic, giants who came to college to swing around a rock on a string and then say ‘oh, what’s football?’ and then end up making the offensive line something people cared about outside of when it failed.”
“Don’t do social media,” he answered easily.  He leaned back and closed his eyes. “Can’t coach what ain’t there.”
Steve’s laugh was a little shaky, but he didn’t try to stop the tears that gathered at the corners of his eyes.  “Awful.”
With that, they stood to go.  Fury nodded once at him, like Steve had passed some sort of silent test.  Pepper patted his shoulder and murmured another word of welcome. Tony, though, shot him a completely self-satisfied smirk and a wink, and Steve felt himself flush all over again.
A few minutes later, when he was trying to wrangle a single tiny screw into place, his phone pinged again.
Steve leaned over to turn on the bedside lamp, gasping quiet breath when Tony’s fingers crept higher under his shirt.  He sat back and tugged his shirt off for the second time that night, suddenly nervous Tony wouldn’t like the one on his chest.
“Just do what she says; it’s easiest,” Tony murmured as he slipped in next to Steve and they shuffled into a tighter group.
“What’s that?” Tony came over and started poking around the engine block, not really doing anything, just putting his hands on the hardware.
“Oh I did that too,” Tony nodded proudly.  “Jarvis, our butler when I was younger, he was a Jets fan, and when the old owner said he was interested in selling, I found myself interested in buying.”
“How’s his knee?” Steve asked Carol when Fitz left with the rest of the captains for the coin toss and the rest of the team had scattered to their last-minute prep.
“Just B?  Or you too, Dev?” Steve asked, stifling actual laughter now as he clicked publish on the latest arrangement of his body of work.
by David Oshinsky is a really interesting look at the panic over polio that swept America during the 1940s and 1950s, up to and including Salk’s life saving vaccine.  It’s a fascinating read, and I highly recommend both it and everything else Professor Oshinsky has written.
“You want to come hang around in the heat while I install a handlebar switch kit?  Tell me how I’m doing everything wrong?” he offered.
Steve shook his head.  “Her coworkers all circled the wagons on me after...everything, and I’m not sure there’s anything more scary than a group of neonatal nurses in protection mode.”
,” Bucky said from where he was laying in a sun lounger nursing a beer and occasionally peeking up over the edge of the grill that Falsworth was manning.
Eventually Monty deputized Morita to start encouraging people to go get food off the long tables set up against the fence “before it all goes to shit” and tiny Cassie parroted “shit” to Bucky and Scott’s delight and Scott’s girlfriend Maggie’s chagrin.  Steve stood and offered to go get Bucky a plate on the condition that Bucky protect his chair from seat thieves.
Pounding on the door followed by an insistent ringing on the doorbell made Steve jump, and the album thunked onto the floor.  He picked up the album then went to see who had come calling so aggressively early on a Saturday morning. He opened the door on a group of muscle bound guys led by one with chin length brown hair and a complicated-looking metal brace strapped to his left arm from wrist to shoulder.
So here’s the deal...when an NFL player (or any professional athlete for that matter) gets suspended, they can appeal their suspension.  Depending on the sport, the suspended player can keep practicing and suiting up and even playing while the appeals process works itself out.
Oh, yeah, a safety is when you get tackled in your own endzone.  Your opponent gets two points out of it.
Thank you as always for your kudos and comments.  Your kind words and enthusiasm for this story make me so happy.
I’m sure you’ve noticed by now, but I’m trying to make opposing teams a group from the Marvel universe (the Giants were all Guardians of the Galaxy, Buffalo is Hydra, you get me).  Well, the Browns are the worst/stupidest villains in the Marvel universe.  Think the likes of Paste-Pot Pete, Leap Frog, and Flag Smasher.  What can I say...it’s the Browns...they’ve been rebuilding since 1964.
“Come on, Steve, it’s the 21st century, rail thin ladies with no muscle mass can lift heavy trophies too.”
In the media room, Steve grabbed his shoes and tugged them on, but he didn’t immediately stand back up to go.  He ran his hand over the couch cushions where, a couple hours ago, he’d been flat on his back making out with Tony Stark like they were teenagers.  Surprisingly, none of the worry or shame that had inevitably followed his infrequent, usually alcohol-fueled, hookups in high school and college crept up on him here.  He felt...quiet.
“It’s always about response times,” he said with a smile before turning back to frown between the playbook open on the table in front of him and the card in his hand as if inspiration would magically appear.
Steve started typing in the shipping address field, but he stopped again when he got to apartment number.  Even if Tony was the only permanent resident, Stark Tower probably handled a ton of mail every day.  He stared at the half-completed address before he thought of a workaround.  Delivering something to Tony’s day job might not actually be that weird at all.  Decision made, he zipped through the billing information, and paused on the last box.
Steve sat and soaked in the frank acknowledgement that he was allowed to struggle, grateful to whatever, or whoever, had pushed Bucky and his friends to come over.
Steve shrugged.  “It’s not the end of the world.  I didn’t like the all-black tires that much anyway.”
Tony waggled his eyebrows behind his red sunglasses.  “Billy Ocean has a suggestion for times like this.”
If you need a place when you get to New York (congratulations on that by the way...looking forward to working with you), mom and I converted the third floor into a furnished rental while I was still in high school, and it’s empty right now.
“Told you,” Tony preened before biting into his own meal.  “Best.  Burgers.  In Brooklyn.”  A few bites later, he set down his half-eaten burger.  “My turn?”
Sam let it lie until he had Steve trapped in his car on their way to practice.  “So your girl must be pretty fancy, huh?”
“Later, boys,” Pepper said.  She handed Steve an Avengers hat and motioned Fury back over.  “Wear that. Hold the jersey with Nick. Smile at the cameras.”
Steve shrugged, trying desperately to keep a straight face.  He wanted so badly to surprise Tony after all.  “Just...y’know…”
By the time Steve made it downstairs, Sam had already packed their meat, the potato salad he’d made from his mom’s secret recipe, and their beer into a cooler.  “I think we can fit two bags of ice on top of this,” he said pointing at the empty space on top of their food.
Later, after they’d cleaned up and crawled back under the covers, Tony reached out and laid his hand gently under his freshly cleaned and lotioned signature on Steve’s skin.  “It goes both ways, you know,” he murmured.
Steve hummed and gathered Tony closer, reaching up to comb his fingers through Tony’s damp hair when he rested his head on Steve’s shoulder.  “What does?” he asked softly.
“You look like you’ve been rode hard and put away wet,” Bucky said as he flopped on the grass next to Steve and passed over a bottle of water.  “Have fun?”
Onscreen, Audrey Hepburn started smashing light bulbs, but Steve didn’t notice as Tony pushed him back until he was laying on the couch, Tony snugged up between his knees.  “This okay?” he mumbled against Steve’s lips.
HUGE thanks as always to betheflame and kestrel337 for tireless cheer, beta, and, to quote Bertie Wooster "just general thing-ness."  You two are amazing.
Steve gasped as Tony swallowed him to the root, his hands tight on Steve’s hips.  Steve writhed down into the tight, wet heat of Tony’s mouth and the teasing swirl of his calloused fingers in the creases of his hips.
“I’m not even sure why I want this to be a surprise,” he admitted while Carla fiddled with getting the stencil placed just right.
Steve threw his towels in the laundry, shoved his dirty clothes in his “ew gross” bag and slung it and his backpack over his shoulder.  “You finally ready?”
Steve settled Tony down in the vee of his legs, but let one of his legs dangle free so he could use his toes to set them swinging gently.  He’d laughed when his mom had found this thing on sale at Lowe’s, and the two of them had had a hell of a time assembling it.  It was practically a daybed hanging between the sturdy beams of the A-frame support, but once they’d gotten it together, Steve practically took up residence, drawing, listening to music, reading, or just daydreaming while he’d push himself slowly with the one foot he’d dangle over the edge.
Steve stood and nodded then they trundled back up and set to work turning Steve’s childhood bedroom into a storage area and setting up the master how he wanted it.  Jacques,
Natasha nodded.  “I get that. But we’re not going to ask you to stick a horse head in someone’s bed if--”
She shrugged.  “Looked solid against Philadelphia, but it looked solid against the Giants too.”  She looked up from her tablet and fixed Steve with a hard stare.  “You don’t get to be Fitz’s age without having some old injuries that just hang around.  We just need to protect him as best we can.”
“Don’t have to run upstairs to look at the router every time I need it,” Steve shrugged, unperturbed.
“Even that,” Steve agreed.  He smiled as Tony rolled down onto his shoulder and threw an arm across his waist.  “It’s funny,” he murmured, “I’ve spent my whole life worried about what ‘everyone else’ would think of me if they found out I wasn’t--was bi.”
“I’d adopt a dog from you,” Steve said from where he was still laying on the grass, completely unmotivated to even sit up.
Steve slipped his arm around Cynthia’s shoulders and smiled.  A couple clicks later, and Natasha was handing Cynthia her phone back.
“Is there a reason you’re trying to crush me?”  Steve swatted an arm back at him, but Sam refused to budge.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Hearteyes motherfucker,” he called over his shoulder as he stepped into his first lunge.
As he wove between the tables towards the stage out on the water, he could picture ESPN and NFL Network analysts breathlessly recounting his collegiate career and his showing at the Combine over a highlight reel of his time at Texas and his week in Indianapolis.  He could practically hear what they were saying, having heard it over and over in the time between the end of the season and tonight. The scuttlebutt calling him a winner in the pocket and touting his overall athleticism were nothing new, but now it would come with the added speculation about how he would fit in as the backup and heir apparent to a journeyman like Fitzsimmons.
Steve dug his phone out of his bag and sent Natasha a quick text while they were sitting in traffic.
Both of his receivers made noises of denial.  “If you don’t get an invite, then something’s really wrong, Cap.”
“50 percent power,” Tony murmured, and the suit’s eyes and chest dimmed and its sweep of the area slowed.  “Let’s start with an easy one...do you like spending time with me?”
Red consulted the appointment book for a moment before he looked up with a smile.  “You must be Steve.”  He grabbed a clipboard with waivers on it, but when he handed it to Steve, he didn’t let go.  “Wait...you’re
Tony slid up to sitting, his legs around Steve’s hips, with a sinuous slide of his body against Steve’s spent and sensitive cock.  “Wanna…?”
Steve looked down at the ratty but clean Texas Strength and Conditioning shirt he had on with a pair of equally ratty gym shorts.  “Like I just got out of the shower?
Every team, it turns out, does their captaincy different ways.  Some have a core group and then rotating additional captains.  Some have set captains and that’s it.  Some rotate their captains by week.  And just like the initial selection differs by team, so to do the policies about replacing a captain with a season-ending injury.
This isn’t a football thing, but Lady Ace was the name of one of the choppers used in the US evacuation of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, so that’s what I’ve named my fake banh mi restaurant.
Once they were inside, Steve had passed from interviewer to interviewer on the way to his seat, giving his same canned answers about how pleased and excited he was to be here and that he hoped to be able to contribute effectively to whichever team selected him.  Natasha had hovered silently in the shadows, ready, he assumed, to swoop in and save him if he stuck his foot too far in his mouth, but she needn’t have worried.
“So...” Brennan started, shoving three of Steve’s sketchbooks into a pile so he could collapse onto Steve’s bed.
“Hell yeah,” he said as he waved them into the house.  “Place kicker extraordinaire.  Haven’t missed in two full seasons.  I broke Vinatieri’s record in Week 13 this past season.”
Tony pointed at the motorcycle sitting under a tarp on the little paved patio.  “So you keep a horse under that cover then?”
Steve stood up and pulled his shirt over his head while Carla lowered her chair and locked it in a fully reclined position.  Steve grimaced at the sticky, peeling feeling of his skin against the pleather upholstery when he laid down then immediately shifted his shoulders to try to get more comfortable.
“That’s just because I’m saving the best for last,” Tony said smoothly.  “Well, the best for today.”
“Be right back with the rest,” Tony tossed over his shoulder.  A few moments later he was back, setting the rest of their glasses on the counter.  He leaned on the counter and watched Steve work for a bit before he spoke. “Got everything settled?”
Steve nodded in the direction of a couple who’d started pedaling their swan shaped boat to get a better angle on them as they ran past.
Tony nodded.  “I helped Pepper and Hill develop the morality clauses in your contract.  We want our team to be something the fans can be proud of.”  He twirled some more pasta around his fork.  “But you haven’t violated any of them.”
He glanced down the range, trying to picture the ball sailing towards one of the targets then back down at his ball and pulled back to swing.  The hollow metallic sound of the club making solid contact with the ball made Steve smile. The ball dropping neatly into the netting lit blue from beneath made him grin.  “I can see why people like this,” he said, turning back to Tony.
kind of player, everyone on the field knows this is your livelihood, so they don’t tend to go for blood.”
Steve laughed and shifted towards Tony like they were sharing secrets.  “I thought when people had a midlife crisis they bought a car.”
Tony fairly glowed as he turned and trotted back over to the, now significantly emptier, pens and called, “Bucky!”
With a quick wave, Steve turned back to where he’d left Tony, texting Sam that he was going out for the afternoon and about their change in Fourth of July plans as he went.  He could feel Bucky’s eyes on him as he walked away, but once he hit send on his text to Sam, he turned his phone on do not disturb.  Out of sight, out of mind.
He shook his head.  “I got a degree for a reason.  If no one wants me as I am, I can get a regular job.”
Steve smacked his forearm.  “Don’t be obtuse.  You’ve forced people to change the way they talk about you.  About SI.  That’s no small accomplishment.”  When Tony finally nodded, Steve prodded gently at his arm again.  “So, come on, why’d you rebrand us?”
“Hey, I put the cover back on the bike and your multimeter’s back in--” Tony stopped short at the sight of Sam.  His too-bright camera ready smile snapped into place and after he’d wiped his hands on the rag he’d brought in with him, he held out his hand for Sam to shake.  “I don’t think we’ve had the pleasure.  Tony Stark.”
“It’s been really great,” Steve said with a small smile.  “I’m really getting excited for preseason now.”
“You made it,” Bucky greeted him with a grin and a slap on the shoulder.  “Let me introduce you to Angie and Dolores.  They run the shelter.”
Dallas, who had beaten them to midfield, was handing out roses from the massive arrangement that sat at the base of the stage, and he handed one to Steve with a wink.  He’d clearly overheard. “Everything’s comin’ up roses, Cap.”
He practically glowed when Tony's reply buzzed in just as the fireworks over the park started lighting up Bucky's backyard.
Steve shrugged.  “The validation of masculinity that comes from large, athletic men and loud, shiny machines?”
Tony had followed Steve into the library, but he veered off to examine the pictures Bucky had taken such a shine to.  “I don’t know.  I just feel like I’ve been hearing about your workouts all week and haven’t gotten to see the…” he glanced over at Steve, “payoff for myself.”
“How awful is this gonna be?” Steve asked Bucky after Carol had stepped into the media room to give her own postgame.
“It’s not like that,” he insisted.  Just to be on the safe side, he jammed his phone between his leg and the couch.  Let Sam come after it now.
“Back here,” his voice filtered through from the back of the house.  When Steve found him staring out the dining room window at the back garden, Tony looked over and smiled.  “You didn’t tell me you had a motorcycle.”
Tony swatted the words away with a dismissive wave.  “He wasn’t wrong.  But it was worth it.  I like seeing kids wearing Avengers jerseys and the way people pack the stadium for home games.  Means I built something people are proud to be a part of.”  He grinned.  “Plus, it’s fun.”
“Now come on over, and let’s get you some more ink,” she said then turned to lead him over to her workstation, tapping on her tablet as she walked.  “Now I know we spoke about two pieces, but you mentioned having trouble sourcing one.  Any luck?”
“Will you tell me something unedited?” Tony parroted back after they’d been swaying for a bit in silence.
In the huddle, Fury was all business.  “We have to assume Fitz won’t be coming back today.  That means Rogers, you’re it.”  He looked at all of them, meeting each man’s gaze before he spoke again.  “Now we’re gonna finish, and we’re gonna finish strong.  You all know the looks these guys have been giving us, so you should be able to capitalize.”
“Sure,” Tony agreed easily.  He resettled a little lower on Steve’s chest so he could lay on his side.
Steve sighed into the easy intimacy of their kiss.  He hesitated to admit it, but he’d missed Tony, even though they’d really only been out of touch for a day.
At the bottom of the heap, Miller and Fitz were both huddled around the ball, but when Miller stood up, Fitz did not.  He curled in on himself then completely stopped moving.  In that split second, the sideline exploded into motion.  The trainers were three steps onto the field when Bucky grabbed Steve’s arm and a ball and dragged him behind the benches.
She’d patted his hand, and he’d fallen silent.  “I know, love.”  She’d laughed at his shocked expression then said, “you realize your generation didn’t invent bisexuality, right?”
“It’s complicated,” he said after a bit.  “I started the Mark 2 largely as a vanity project.  Just to see if I could do it.  But I wanted to maybe be able to do some good too.  It just kind of spiraled from there.  I’m a tinkerer.  There’s always
Steve nodded then swiped at his eyes.  “Will you tell me something else?” he asked, in an effort to shift focus back off himself.
Fury cracked the closest thing Steve had seen to a smile in his time with the team.  “Not yet.  I figured he’d have questions for both of us once I did.”
“This is really good,” Steve said around his mouthful of food.  “Like I think I may be spoiled for other burgers good.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Steve said with a smile, reaching out to take the card from her.  He set it on the table with his jersey and the container he still hadn’t managed to open and shot Tony a sideways glance, but Tony just shrugged, unrepentant.  After their hostess departed with a smile and a word about their bay attendant being along shortly for their drink order, Steve turned his sideways look full on Tony Stark.  “What was
2020 is kicking my ass.  I feel like I've completely ruined my work-life balance.  Which is why this chapter took more than a hot ass minute.  I swear on my everything, I'm working on this fic as regularly as I'm able (usually whenever the NFL is on my TV) and it will be finished.
“I’ve heard a few teams traded up to have a better shot at you still being available.”  She grabbed his hand under the table and started tracing team abbreviations onto his palm, making a list.  “So I’d say you’ll go sometime between nine and twelve based on how high those teams traded.”
Fans lined the sidewalks, three deep in places, in front of the entrance and spilled out into the driveway behind barricades.  Homemade signs in red and gold welcomed Steve and Sam and a few other names like Thor Odinson and T’Challa Udaku that Steve remembered hearing during the free agency window.  A little girl who couldn’t be more than six in a tiny Avengers cheerleading dress waved and shouted Steve’s name as he and Sam made their way across the parking lot.
Sharon reached out to grab his wrist.  “Since this week has been largely ramp-up, we’ve kept the media out, but you can expect time with them starting on Monday.  We’ll have a quick meeting before your first session, though, so you’ll know what to expect.”
“I might actually be dying,” Sam groaned hours later as they made their way back to his car.  “This Cage guy is gonna be an ass kicker.”
“We had a few guys who did football and track at Texas,” Steve pointed out, raking a comb through his hair.
“Only if you tell me why the hell you’re using your pasta fork to eat dessert,” Tony said as he used a spoon to break off a bite of one cannoli.
Tony pressed him back into the bed, his hands squeezing the tight curve of Steve’s waist and down over his hips.  “Smooth lines are for seduction.”
Steve scowled down at his hands, watching as he spun the ball against his own palm.  “I’m not…” he sighed. “I haven’t thought that far ahead.”
My one big cave to self-indulgence is the way Bucky thinks about his female fans.  I am exhausted by the way people (mostly men, but not always) talk about female sports fans.  That they’re only fans of the good looking players and don’t really know the game.  That’s some bullshit.
Steve frowned down at his empty bowl, unsure how to explain the convoluted mess his brain turned into whenever he tried to reason through being in any way out as a professional football player.  Bucky’s easy acceptance wouldn’t be even remotely close to the norm, he knew, and the thought of opening up to anyone else, of opening himself up to anyone else, filled him with a cloying, creeping dread.  Still, he owed Tony as much honesty as he could give him even if he wasn’t confident he’d even be able to articulate what he wanted.
Tony resettled himself against Steve’s chest and tugged Steve’s hands back up towards his hair.  “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Bucky already knows.  He figured it out back in July.  One look at us when you met me in the park after the rundown and he just knew.  Which, okay.  I didn’t set out to show him that way or anything, but when he asked me outright, I couldn’t just lie.  And Sam’s always asked me the kinds of questions I could…”
“I figured you were gonna wear that same suit, so now you got something to carry your compass with.”
Steve could practically picture that airy wave Tony used when he was pretending he didn’t care about something.  “Tony, that fake nonchalance doesn’t fool anyone.”
Carla shook her head down at Steve’s chest.  “I figured out right quick with my Raul that there’s never a simple answer to that question.”  She smiled fondly.  “But sometimes love shouldn’t be examined like a balance sheet.”
Flipping through his high school career, action shots of him on the field started to mix more frequently with his formal team pictures as he spent more and more time in the game, and his signing day and the party Coach Raf had--
He shrugged.  “Sure. I gotta say though, if you’re in the market for an agent, my cousin Kyler got really lucky with his guy.  Dude’s like a second dad. If you can get with him, I’d say do that.”
Before she could answer, the owner Tony Stark, the GM Pepper Potts, and the head coach Nick Fury were all making their way to the podium.  They conferred briefly, then Pepper stepped to the microphone.
“Hooking up with someone who’s a man.  Who’s older.  And my boss.”  He smiled sadly at Tony.  “Take your pick.”
A soft knock on the door put a stop to their conversation.  “I’ll grab the food if you grab plates?” Tony offered, already standing to get the door.
found all the spare sheets in drawers under the bed and stripped the dusty set off and went to put them in the wash while Steve and Dum Dum remade the bed then started in on the boxes in the hall.
She stood and patted his arm, her hand gentle on his bare forearm.  “I know this is overwhelming. Think about it. I know this game. The one on the field
Tony slipped Steve’s hands out from around his empty dish.  “Come here.  Come sit on this stupidly idyllic porch swing with me.”  He manhandled Steve up and onto the swing, before collapsing on top of him back to front, pinning Steve with his own weight.
Fitz rolled his eyes.  “See if she’s still sayin’ that once you bobble a pass some sports talking head says should’ve been an easy catch.”
Steve nodded.  “And that’s a terrible way to treat a friend.  It really is, but tonight when I could see Sam trying to put it together, I just--”
He drew up short in the living room door watching Dum Dum gesture at the other end of the couch.  “Grab that end, Jackie boy. Help me start getting this furniture uncovered.”
“And you’re worried about how you’ll come out in the editing if this,” Tony gestured between them, “becomes public.”
“July.  Right before I had to report back for two-a-days.  Coach let me come back a couple days late because of her funeral.”  His stomach twisted at the thought of someone like Stephen Smith getting hold of his mother’s battle with cancer.  He grabbed Natasha’s wrist as she started to pull away. “You can’t--I don’t--” he took a breath, trying to force himself to make sense.  To explain his desire for privacy in a way that would show her how much he wanted his mom to have her peace. “I only told Phillips because I needed the time.  I don’t want her to be someone ESPN can just talk about. She was sick for a long time, and by the end, it was just…” he looked at her, begging her to understand.  “She deserves to rest, not to be some
Steve refused to answer, sure anything he said would give away the fact that, no, he did not have a sweet girl waiting for him in either Austin or Brooklyn.  And he probably wouldn’t. Ever.
Steve rolled his eyes and went to hang his suit in the closet.  “I love this kind of nosy personal stuff,” he muttered.
“Fuck,” Steve muttered and started speeding through his progression.  He ducked out of Batroc’s arms when he grabbed for Steve, and just threw the ball away, bringing up fourth down.
Tony opened his mouth to, presumably, guess again, but Steve swept him up in his arms, laughing.  He dumped Tony on the bed then crawled up after him until he could straddle his waist
Steve pushed the chair he’d had his feet on towards Tony.  “Please.  I feel like your suit’s glaring at me out here all by myself.”
Dum Dum squeezed his shoulder once more before he let Steve go and glanced down at his watch.  “Jesus. Cho’s minions are gonna beat our asses if we don’t eat soon. We about done in here?”
Steve finally let himself smile back, let himself get caught up in Tony’s boundless enthusiasm.  “Alright. As long as dinner’s in my meal plan.”
Steve obediently tugged his shirt back on while Carla started going over the aftercare instructions.  He trailed after her voice back up to the counter where he paid, left an obscene tip, and finally accepted the little bag with his care notes and a tube of lotion.  Tony poked his head back in right as Carla finished her spiel and frowned at the two of them.
Jerry Jones was adamant that his players stand “toe on the line” when Kaepernick started protesting during the anthem or he would fire them.  So, you know, a real class act *side eye*
Steve nodded and trotted out the back of the end zone and up the tunnel, still fiddling with the football in his hands.  He knew his time playing college ball was almost over, and while he’d had his mom to help him figure out which college recruiters had actually considered him as a whole player and which ones were full of so much bull, he didn’t have her now.  What’s more, he’d admitted to himself when the first agent had come sniffing around that she wouldn’t really have been able to help him even if she’d felt up to--
Steve smiled at the picture of a young Tony building a robot to do the job he’d clearly enjoyed but had to surrender.  Then at an older Tony wanting to keep a bit of that first robot with him in the newer, more sophisticated model.  He’d done the same thing with keeping that silly Clapper.  Sarah had laughed when she’d opened it.  Laughed and then hugged Steve and insisted he pick out what lights it would control.
“No kidding,” Steve agreed, slumping into the passenger seat of Sam’s car.  “I think Blackjacks are my new least favorite thing.”
We’re rounding out our week getting to know our new Avengers with Steve Rogers (QB).  Read his full profile here: https://bit.ly/3cNHmoT
While Sam was still laughing at him, a lithe man with a quick smile dropped into one of the seats directly in front of them.  He turned that smile on them. “Oh, wow, you--you’re Steve Rogers. I know you.” He stuck out his hand, grinning even wider when Steve accepted it.  “Scott. Lang. I was playing last year at Cal Poly.”
“Thank you.  I just…” he hesitated.  Probably shouldn’t go into the finer details of clock management and play selection logistics; no one outside actual players really cared after all.  “I just wanted to make sure I could protect all the hard work our team did all throughout the rest of the game. Make sure all their sacrifices and great plays weren’t for nothing.”
Rollins nodded and moved off, and Steve started casting around for Danvers.  He saw her on the edge of the milling teams speaking with one of the Serpents’ coaches.  Before he could make his way over, though, Bucky grabbed his elbow.
The woman had finally wrestled both the bowl trophy and the AFCA trophy into Phillips’ hands, and the man with her stepped forward to announce the MVP awards.
Please be aware there’s some homophobic language in this chapter.  This is a real-ass part of sports, unfortunately, but for me part of quality storytelling lies in the verisimilitude of the scene.  If this is something that makes you uncomfortable, skimming/skipping the actual game against Dallas is your friend.
Fury appearing on the other side of Steve’s locker paused their conversation.  “Gentlemen, if you would get changed and get into medical or the cafeteria, we’re going to be starting promptly at one.”  Fury turned his focus on Steve.  “Rogers, if you could come with me?”
,” Pepper cut in smoothly, quelling the clamor.  She shot Tony a Look before she continued. “We were interested in drafting a quarterback who would bring local fans into the stadium and would get the ones who couldn’t make it to the stadium to tune in on Sunday afternoons.  We definitely get that by bringing a hometown product back to his neighborhood.” She smirked. “And it doesn’t hurt that he’s got serious talent.”
