His breath quickening, he sits up and turns back to Steve, hope lighting up his eyes.  They’re going to make it, he thinks.  All the crap they’ve gone through, all the shit they’ve had to deal with—it’ll all have been worth it, because a lifeboat’s come back, and now they’ll be safe.  “Steve,” he says, and his voice is so weak it comes out as a wheeze.  “Steve, w-wake up.  There’s a boat.”
"Move the train!" Steve shouted.  He threw his shield, angling it so that it would knock the nearest biter to the side of the tunnel, then repeated it for the next closest biter.
Tony starts walking off, but he turns to wave before disappearing among the other passengers, and Steve waves back.  As soon as he’s gone, Steve turns to a fresh page in his sketchbook and immediately gets to work, hands itching to draw those eyes, that smile before he can forget what they look like.
Ready or not, though, it still doesn’t stop his heart from aching as he meets Tony’s desperate gaze, wanting so badly to touch him, kiss him, hold him one more time.  Belatedly, he realizes that he never did tell him he loves him—but it doesn’t matter now.  It’s too late, and it just seems too cruel to shout it down at him now, at the moment of their parting.  It’s best, he thinks, to just keep quiet.
“Steve!” he cried, running over to his side and placing a hand against his side, feeling coarse fur under his skin.  “Steve, are you okay?  God, you idiot, what did you run away for?”
Stark waved a hand at him before crouching down to pick up some of the fallen items.  "Old bag.  Don't worry about it—I can hold it together until we get back, and then I'll patch it up."
“Uh, duh,” Tony replied.  “I already have one.  It’s called ‘shooting a repulsor blast straight into its big ugly face’.   You won’t have to do a thing.”
Tony tilts his head back, looking up on the sky, and suddenly he seems very subdued.  “It’s like a prison here,” he says at last.  “I know what you’re thinking.  I’m a first-class passenger on the biggest ship in the world and somehow I feel like that’s a bad thing.”  He sighs, closing his eyes, and Steve has to fight the urge to hug him.  “I don’t know.  It’s Sunset.  It’s my father.  It’s everything.”  One eye cracks open, squinting at Steve.  “Don’t get me wrong.  Being rich is great, no offense to you.  It comes with some pretty short strings, though.”
" Steve's voice continued, and the fleeting hope Tony had felt immediately dissipated.  Steve couldn't hear him.  Steve was on a deathtrap and there was not a damned thing Tony could do about it.
He turns to look at Steve, who’s just gazing at him in silence, and once more he’s struck by how comfortable all of this is.  Steve’s seen him at his worst and at his best, and still he’s here, one of the few people Tony never did manage to drive away.  There are still the same three words on the tip of his tongue as they’ve always been, but somehow, as Tony gazes back at Steve, he suddenly realizes that there’s no need to say them out loud.
Steve can feel his heart leap in his chest as he blinks slowly at him in return, hardly able to believe the words he’s just heard.  If he’s being honest with himself, well… he’d hoped for this.  Hoped that maybe Tony would want to throw everything away and just start over.  But he hadn’t actually expected it to
"Hey," Pepper interrupted suddenly.  She motioned ahead, glancing back at them.  "Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"
Tony's eyes flashed.  "We're armed and you're trapped," he said.  "You should rethink your decisions."
“Great,” Steve replied, and once again his smile seemed to brighten the whole room.  “By the way, Tony?”
to be nervous.  “Mostly I just worked from place to place.  A few factory jobs, some construction ones… anything to get by.”
Fortunately, he recognized the hallway he was in, and so he was able to find Tony's room and slip inside, letting out a sigh of relief.  He was alone now.
With that done, he pulled away, scanning the stadium—and there.  That was the press box, and unfortunately, it was right above the entrance the biters would soon be streaming in from.
"This is mostly for Miss Potts' convenience," Tony announced to the people assembled there.  "Since she saw fit to come so very, very late."
, it’s cold.  Tony can still remember that first conversation he had with Steve—God, it must have been ages ago—when he was standing on the wrong side of the rail and Steve was trying to get him to come back.
It had ended in heartbreak or worse every time, and Tony's chest still ached at the memory of it.  And yet—was he supposed to just give up now?  Or keep trying?
"Oh, right," Steve said around a mouthful of omelette, not sure what to make of the fact that his dream self had a Pa who was still alive.  And what was tech stuff supposed to mean? Radios, maybe? "And our Mas also have the same jobs, huh?"
"It's fine," Steve replied, even if he wasn't sure what to make of the contact.  It seemed a little excessive, but maybe it was better that he didn't say anything about it.  "Enjoy yourself with the twins. And, uh, Indiana. I'll have dinner alone."
Finally, he was done.  There were still a few small things lying around that Tony wasn't sure what to do with, so he figured it was better to play it safe and hold onto them instead of just throwing them out.  One was a box, which Tony sat down on the floor with as he regarded it curiously. Would Steve be mad if Tony took a look? Considering how everything else had been labeled, he had to assume that if Steve really didn't want him to look, he would have written as much on the box.
The sabretooth abruptly stopped squirming, then turned, the flashlight laying on the ground in such a way that it silhouetted the cat from the back and revealing Tony standing there, making him feel very much like a deer caught in the headlights.  Well, this was great, just great.  Tony brought the gauntlets up again, aiming toward the face, but if it hadn’t worked before, why would it work now?
Tony let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.  They were all okay.  No one had died on his watch.  "Good," he said.  "Good."
"So, Steve, you mentioned rules in your last voicelog," Tony said once he started recording.  "And that's a - how would you put it - a gosh darned swell idea, I think. First rule: please don't use the bathroom as an excuse to escape a social situation ever again.  I just don't
“You’d think SHIELD would—” He stopped, eyes darting to the gown in Steve’s hand, to his face and the door and then back. “You know what, nevermind,” Stark mumbled, hunching over his phone and shifting so his back was more towards him. Steve could hear the music get louder.
“You owe me three days, though, Steve,” Tony said, fingers still busy. “We’ve never discussed discipline, but we’re going to tomorrow.”
Tony’s eyebrows had curved up, and the expression on his face was surprised and almost . . . hopeful. Although maybe Steve was reading too much into it. Maybe he was seeing what he wanted to see. “Thank you for letting me know,” Tony said quietly.
Tony swallows.  No.  No.  Howard is trying to guilt trip him, and he’s not going to let it work.  He’s
, because holy shit, Cap was suddenly next to him when he wasn't before, and he was using that shield of his to deflect the arrows far faster than Tony could have imagined.  The next thing Tony knew, he'd been hauled up and slung over Cap's shoulder, the clang of metal on metal sharp in his ears as Cap sprinted the rest of the way toward the other end of the room, shield still moving to deflect the arrows coming at them from both sides.
Steve lets out a soft laugh, sounding somewhat pained, and looks down as he squeezes Tony’s hand.  “You killed yourself for me,” he says after a long moment.
So they move, going up whenever they find a staircase, always running uphill.  Tony wonders how much time is left and how many people are still on the ship.  He remembers the diagrams he’d seen earlier, remembers the way his mouth had gone dry when he’d done the calculations in his head—because according to his math, there weren’t enough of them.  Weren’t enough by half.  And yet, given everything he’d heard—he’d thought it wouldn’t matter.
,” she says.  “I don’t know why you insist on ignoring it, but we all know what those of his class are like.  All he wants is your money.”
The helmet gets put on last, and once it’s secured Tony immediately accesses the news outlets, unable to help but grin as he scrolls past the latest headlines.  “You fought another Master Man, huh?  Nice.”
Tony and the suit fight.  He’ll learn, eventually, how Yinsen’s kid managed to program the suit to turn against everybody, but not today.  Not now.  Right now the only thing that matters is bringing this hulking lump of metal down.
It was hard to express all that without making it more obvious that he didn't belong, though, so he held his tongue.  "Sure," he said instead.
Instinct slowly returned to him, and eventually Steve managed to remember the basics of assessing a situation.  Sitting up on his elbows, he scoped out his location as his eyes adjusted to the dark.  He wasn't tied down—that was good.  But he was in some sort of cabin with thick, black curtains hanging off of one wall, likely blocking out the windows—that seemed less good.  Another wall had a shelf with what looked like several cans of food, though most of them were already opened and likely empty.  There was a story here, Steve thought, but he didn't know what it was.
," Steve said next, and his tone was so calm, so accepting, Tony could almost imagine him at the bedside of a child, putting them to sleep.  "
Steve nodded a bit awkwardly in response, again unsure of how to reply, as he continued working on his plate.  Things continued like this for the next several minutes, Steve eating, Jarvis watching. Finally, Jarvis cleared his throat and said, "Your parents will be returning home today."
It wasn't until late at night, as Steve stared into the streets from his watch spot on the second floor and tried to blink the sleep from his eyes, that he realized that not once had Tony ever assured him that his
But despite all of that, despite all of the disruptions and the headaches and the groaning, Tony… sort of liked it.  A little bit. Maybe.
Then he turned, quickly hobbling over to the former doorway and pushing away some pieces of wood.  With one last look at Steve, he got on his knees and then crawled through the gap, disappearing into the darkness of the hallway.
“Uh huh,” Tony replied absently, turning to one side and wincing as he curled up underneath the blanket.  This was going to be a fun night.  Or was it even night at all?  It was probably the morning now.  Well, the morning could go suck itself.  “Don’t let me down, Rogers.”  He took one more deep, searing breath, and then he was out like a light.
He paused, waiting for a sarcastic comment from Tony.  When none came, he blinked, surprised, but continued speaking.  "I don't think I'll ever agree with what you did during the war, even if it helped end it sooner.  That weapon killed people.  I thought it would open a Pandora's Box.  But look at us now—your favorite weapon is a damned shovel, and we're afraid of people because they can bite us.  Everything's changed.  Understanding that, and seeing people die today—seeing
"Yeah," Steve said around a mouthful of the runniest but most delicious egg he'd ever eaten, glad that Tony had already mentioned this detail.
"Maybe," Steve said with a sigh.  "Sorry.  I don't know.  A lot happened today, and you were almost bit…"
"No," Steve said automatically, but then he squeezed his eyes shut, one fist clenching.  "...Yes," he admitted a moment later. "But…"
Steve sighed, deciding not to answer that.  "We need to find a good entry point," he said.  "Let's go."
had happened; Tony regretted not catching up on Steve's journal even more.  Though he obviously didn't spend much time talking with those he delivered to - he was here conducting a transaction, not shooting the breeze, after all - there were at least pleasantries exchanged.
Then he remembered.  There was a reason he’d had to go through all of last night’s bullshit.  A reason he’d broken a promise and dropped dead, kind of.  A very, very good reason.
"I suppose I'll take that as a compliment," Jarvis said.  He took a seat across from Steve, folding his hands in front of him.  "Distracting you from your usual pastries is probably high praise, indeed."
But since Steve was having none of it, apparently, he pulled out another box, showing it to him.  “Do franks and beans appeal more to your picky palette?”  When Steve just shook his head again, Tony sighed, dumping the remaining contents of his pack onto the floor.  “Well, what do you want?  Black beans?  Chicken and noodles?  I’m not carrying around a five-star restaurant on my back, Steve.  I ate pinto beans last night.”
So he kept on looking, ignoring the persistent ache in his arm and the way his heart was pounding in his throat, resolutely downing more aspirin.  He’d find Steve, he told himself.  He just—he’d find him.
“Thank God,” Tony murmurs when he hears the good news.  As for seeing the others, though… he’s not so sure about that.  It’s not—it’s not that he doesn’t like them, or anything like that.  But he’s not connected to them the way he used to be; Carol and Steve are two of the few Avengers he’d kept in regular contact with since leaving.  “I’ll stay here,” he says.
Tony wished he'd brought his notes with him, though rationally he knew it would have been silly to plan to take reams of oracle bone photos along, and in any case, he'd memorized most of it already.  Still.  "The oracle bones talk about a woman named Fu Hao.  She was one of the wives of a ruling king, but more importantly, she was both a general and high priestess.  Both were unusual for a woman at the time, so for her to even be one or the other implied that she must have been extraordinary.  And we know that the people asking the gods questions with the oracle bones did so with the help of our friend the tiger circle, and we also know
"So," Tony said as they walked.  "Lab supplies.  You're finding time for your biology research in the middle of an undead epidemic?"
That was an understatement, but Steve wasn't in the mood to get flippant with her.  "He thinks people dying is a good thing."
Cap shook his head quickly, opening a pouch and putting the fragment inside, and the moment was over.  "Coming."
By the end of the school day, between paying attention to the new things that were being taught and trying to learn the concepts for the homework he'd… somehow already done yesterday (and he had to admit, whoever had written the original answers had gotten every single one right), Steve felt like his brain was as slow as molasses.  He just wanted to go home. Well, he still wanted to talk to Arnie first, but as usual Arnie had left class as soon as it ended, probably to do… whatever fellas like him did with girls.
“I know,” Tony breathes, and he presses a kiss to Steve’s temple, his forehead, his nose.  “I will.  But not without you.”
"Just let me have this," Tony said.  "Anyway, she did mention that the glass on the walls was her doing.  Guess it's supposed to cripple any biters who come close to the hospital.  Well, and you, apparently."  He started to wipe down Steve's calf, his movements gentle.
.  Not that there was any danger of that, since Steve knew full well that he wasn't really ogle material.  But still!
like they were friends, but maybe Steve didn't feel the same way.  And with Steve hurting the way he was, Tony didn't want to burden him with - well, himself.  Steve had enough to deal with.
It was Steve.  Human Steve, his hair a golden halo around him as he was lit by the rising sun from behind, blue eyes shining.  He was, as far as Tony could tell, completely naked, but the furry pelt draped over his back kept Tony from being certain.
"Sal Kennedy," Tony said quietly.  "Botanist.  Smart guy.  A friend who saved my hide more than once.  I met him after the outbreak.  He traveled with me and Rhodey for a while."  He laughed a little, though there was no mirth behind it.  "He was a lot like you at first, actually.  Hated the idea of killing the biters.  Wouldn't do it any under circumstance.  He got bit for his troubles."
His weak attempt at levity or whatever the hell it was isn’t appreciated by Steve, whose frown deepens.  “You agreed to join the Avengers,” he says.  “You talked Luke into it.  Why are you suddenly out?”
"God," Steve repeated, a shudder passing through his body.  Tony had known this whole time.  He'd planned for it.  "Are you asking me to do what I think you are?"
“Left!” Tony yells back, and then they’re off again.  They continue doing this for what feels like the next few hours, though in reality it’s probably much less than that—but God, walking in this is as exhausting as all get-out, and he’s tiring fast.  Finally, though, they reach a staircase, and Steve pulls him up, breathing hard as they finally reach dry footing.
"There are bones everywhere," Rhodey commented, voice strained as his flashlight moved along the edges of the walls, which were lined with skeletons.  At least Tony wasn't alone in his discomfort.
But everything else had.  "Okay," Steve said.  "Well… I'm glad you won't be keeling over.  I'm still upset about… before, but I do prefer you alive."
A moment passed, and then Steve shook his head slowly, causing Tony’s heart to drop.  He wanted to ask what was wrong, but it was actually pretty clear what was wrong.  It was almost sunset.  If something bad was going to happen to Steve, it was going to happen soon.
He bristled.  “And what, you shouldn’t?”  Was it bad that Rogers set him off so easily?  Probably.  But whose fault was that?  If everyone had just let him go treasure-hunting on his own like he wanted, then he wouldn’t have had anyone to get annoyed at.
“It’s definitely better,” Steve agrees, turning around and smiling.  Especially with Tony holding him like this.  The man likes to cuddle.  Who knew?  “So,” he continues after a moment, reaching up to run a hand through Tony’s hair, “did you have anything particular in mind…?”
Steve was suddenly reminded of some of the things he'd seen during the war, his fists clenched as he thought about it.  That people were capable of such malice… "We'll have to break a window, then," he said as he continued following the walls of the school.  "That won't be quiet."
He could figure it out later.  For now, he thought that maybe he was ready to read the rest of Steve's entries, so he padded back to the bedroom, dusting off his clothes to the best of his ability before crawling onto the bed and picking up the journal.
Steve stood, securing his shield against his back.  "Human enemies are one thing, but biters are another," he said.  He still hated the nickname—calling them
With Cap following, he stomped back over to the controls, removing his gauntlets so he could use his hands freely.  "Shh, baby," he crooned, flicking switches and shifting levers.  "You'll be able to rest soon."
ing sound.  “No, dear.  It’s a diamond.  It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth… and today it’s the most valuable jewel in the world.”
Tony stared at the long line of letters he could see on the control panel and realized, with thirty-nine seconds left, that he had no idea what to do with this.
The metal plate was different now.  It had shrunk considerably, just a fraction of its original size, and took the shape of a small circle placed directly over his heart.  Embedded in it was the gem from earlier, glowing yellow the way it had been before Tony had touched it.
Steve snorted, then blinked as something caught his eye.  He reached forward and pointed at one package, looking at Tony accusingly.
“And you deserve it.”  Howard walks up to the table, eyes glinting.  “You are not to see that man again, do you hear me?”
Tony stared at him, momentarily at a loss for words.  Was all that really true?  It couldn't be.  But would Captain America lie to him?
“Steve!” he calls out raspily, heart leaping into his throat as he tries to swim past everyone else, ignoring the screams and the pain and the cold and everything that isn’t Steve.  “Steve!”
There was a pause, but then Cap nodded, running into the room as Tony stepped out in the suit—and there Birch was, holding up an automatic rifle and pointing it right at him.
Then he meets Rumiko Fujikawa.  “If you try to romance me with nonsense words, I’ll probably have to hurt you,” she says with a bright grin, and Tony thinks that maybe he’s found the answer to his aching heart.
That didn't seem right.  Yesterday was Sunday. Logically, it followed that today was Monday.  "Ty, you know that as far as pranks go, this one is pretty sad, right?" he had to ask.
He inhales, exhales, then takes the ring off, offering it back to Sunset.  “Yeah,” he says again.  “It’ll be fun.  Really, really fun.”
do after this is over?" he asked.  "Make a new suit, maybe?"  Steve still wasn't sure what had happened to the old one.
"And you're not?" Cap countered.  His voice was sharp, sharper than Tony would have expected.  "Look, Tony.  We're in a bad spot right now, which, by the way, is
, even if whatever it did didn't manifest itself to him.  But he didn't know what that something was, and it was driving him crazy.
Damn his broken body.  But he’d deal with it, one way or another.  Either he’d find a cure, or he’d die trying.
"Bullshit," Tony said.  If that were actually the case, he would have trotted that excuse out from the very beginning.  "Come on.  Just tell me."
“You’re cold,” Steve replies reasonably, as though he’s explaining that the sky is blue.  “You need this jacket more than me.”
Yeah, Tony could see that.  He'd set up the date, but he wasn't around when the date actually happened, so Steve had to go instead.  Not that Tony minded, really. He was happy to help Steve out with these things, because he was a perfectly dateable young man despite his size - it was just a matter of confidence.  The more practice he got, the better. The problem was that Steve didn't seem very interested in practice, considering how many times he'd scribbled
Completely taken aback, Tony lowered his hand, staring at it.  Had it just—had it just communicated with him?  “What?” he said dumbly.
Then a light shines into his face for a moment before disappearing.  Tony frowns slightly but remains unmoving otherwise, willing to write it off as a hallucination.
Once he was done panting, though, the realization of what this meant dawned on him.  His heart was better, it seemed.  There was no more battery, no more danger of running out of power.  Just the gem, which needed no charge.  Whether it had actually
Steve blinks at him—slowly, like even that small effort is too much work for him—but then he nods and quirks his lips.  “S-sure,” he says.  “W-what about?”
Blinking, Tony follows his gaze to look at his shoulder, then looks back at Steve and shrugs.  “It doesn’t matter,” he says.
"You know," Tony said, confused again by Cap's expression.  It was hard to really dwell on it, though, because he was starting to feel increasingly drowsy.  "After we got you into the airship.  I passed out, I guess, but I remember someone petting my hair."
Stark closed his eyes.  "That was the original plan," he said.  "The war ended in 1945, and afterward we—the government, I mean—sent search parties out to look for you.  But then…"
Jessica rose, looking again at the door.  Steve thought he heard her sniffling, though he decided not to comment on it.  "The food should be in there," she said.  "But…"
There was a caption beneath one of them.  Tony leaned down, trying to read the writing in the fading light.
Steve stared at him, though the gravity he was trying to project was somewhat lost due to the sabretooth pelt that was still draped off his shoulders.  “You’re kidding.  Tony, it’s the middle of the day.  No one’s going to be able to see fireworks.”
Tony looked outside.  "If we're going to be landing around here, then we might as well get as close to the smoke as we can," he said.  "I'm gonna try and land us somewhere on the shore.  We'll get off and wing it from there.  Can you get the suit?"
But it’s okay, he thinks.  Steve’s happy.  Tony’s happy.  This is the way things should be, matching words or not.  This is the way things should
It wasn't long before he found a door that had clearly been taken down by force—kicked in, not kicked out.  Cap, then.  Tony decided to head in, arms lifted and gauntlets at the ready.  If Cap had already been through here, then maybe there was no danger—but given everything they'd been through, it never hurt to be careful.
“A p-pleasure,” Tony says, and strangely enough… he kind of means it.  “Anthony Stark.”  He hesitates, looking down, then looks back up at… Steve.  “I’d let go of this rail here to shake your hand, but, you know.  You’ve annoyingly made me not want to die anymore.”
Stark peered through the next window they passed by, motioning for them to stop.  "This one seems clear."
Stark hesitated but ultimately went inside without complaint.  "Stay low on the ground," Steve heard him tell her, and suddenly smoke erupted from the window.
Eventually, Rogers came to a stop, and Tony only narrowly avoided bumping into him.  “We should stop for the night,” he said.  “Or at least, I think it’s night.”  He brought his wrist up, looking at his watch before frowning.  “Hmm.”
Was Steve even still alive?  Tony could get up and look, but he was too afraid, too ashamed to do so.  Because even if Steve was, what then?  He was still a sabretooth.  Either Steve’s mind was still trapped in that body, or, even worse—and more plausibly, given his recent behavior—everything that Steve had been was gone now, and there was nothing left but a ferocious, wild cat.  And if
The sabretooth looked at him and whined, paws skittish as it attempted to find steady footing.  It seemed to be trying to say something, but considering that giant cats weren’t exactly equipped to speak any human language, it was no surprise that nothing came out.  “I don’t understand,” Tony told it.  “What are you doing?”
idea how—how mortified I was to see that disgusting scribble in the safe?”  She steps closer, pushing right up into his personal space.  “What is it about him, Tony?
“Right,” Tony said, biting his lip.  He didn’t like this.  He didn’t like this one bit.  But what could they do?  The other exit was a pit Rogers couldn’t get out of.  Here, he had a chance… it was just that if Rogers messed up, he’d end up dying as a result.  And Tony really didn’t want him to die.
"You heard me," Tony said.  "Look.  There's a small gap I'll be able to crawl through.  And then you can get out of here without me weighing you down.  We'll meet outside."
Steve stands up.  “Maybe I should leave,” he says quickly, and Tony tries not to look too upset.  After all of that… he’s just going to leave him here?  “It… it was an experience getting to know you, Mr. Stark.  Ms. Bain.”  He turns to Tony, offering his hand, and Tony dazedly shakes it.  “Thank you for the dinner invite, Tony.”
"It's fine," Steve said quickly.  He could hear the biters starting to push up the stairs.  "I'll carry you."  Quickly, he bent over to gather Tony into his arms—
"I'll do it for you," he repeated, mostly to himself, and he reached out, placing a hand against Tony's cheek, feeling the scratchiness of his beard.
Tony snorts, running a hand through his hair, damp with sweat, and Steve can’t help but find it beautiful—almost erotic, even.  “Believe me,” he says.  His voice is just a little bit slurred, but he seems to be as sharp as ever.  “Just because I’m supposedly a gentleman doesn’t mean I can’t handle my booze.”
How predictable of her to care more about his money than him.  It’s almost charming, except for the part where it’s kind of depressing.  Why does his father like her so much?  “Like I said, no one robbed anything.  Just let it go, okay?”
Stark held his hands up in a placating manner, and Steve forced himself to calm down.  "The… 'injured woman'," he said.  "She wasn't the only one injured like that."  He took yet another deep breath, then continued, "It was Hydra."
Tony snorted.  “Well, gee,” he said.  “What a surprise.  Thank you for enlightening me, because I have never heard that before in my entire life.  But I don’t care about big cats or reptiles.”
“Why are you even here?  From everything I’ve read about you in the file Nick gave me, you and I don’t have a lot in common, and those are just the highlights.  That’s when they were trying to make this seem like a bonding I’d actually want.”
And maybe he wanted to give Steve something to think about while he was gone, something worth coming back to.
He had to do it again when Steve shook, Steve’s cock making a wet sound as it slapped against his stomach, and fuck, Tony obviously needed to spend more time mapping out Steve’s pain boundaries, because he wasn’t anywhere close.
The wounded sound Steve made in response had Tony’s cock aching, and not for the first time, he wished he had more hands since he obviously wasn’t going to withdraw the one fucking Steve, and his other one was busy digging into Steve’s ass and keeping him open for Tony.
Bruce modelled his second jacket and third shirt of the day, which was kind of hilarious since he’d already met Mrs. Kent a couple of times before, but considering Dick was trying out outfit number five, it was totally relatable.
happy to see Tony, and okay, there’s no way he’s going to hide that.  Of course, Tony isn’t trying to hide that he’s happy to see Steve either, but it’s the principle of the matter.
Tony started snickering, which wasn’t encouraging at all actually.  “Don’t worry, Steve, we’re only going to be there one night.  I’ll protect you from those big, scary workaholics. Ooh, speaking of which, you know they’re going to want to grill you.”
As always, many thanks to MetaAllu who took time off from like a billion essays in order to let me know this was alright. *hugs* I also wanted to thank ricochet for all the awesome reviews and encouragement; you totally inspired me to write this next chapter, thank you.
“I didn’t think until I reached the coast that you might live underwater, but by then, it was too late to ask for help. Angels go into heat when they’re close to their Soulmate for the first time. I
He angles away from Dr. Stark as he undoes his jeans, heart thudding and hyper-aware that means he’s going to be mooning Dr. Stark as he undresses, but there are no good options right now. It doesn’t help that his jeans are clinging to his legs, which means it’s harder to take them off and that he’s hunched over longer than he’d expected as he shoves his clothes down, but it’s not like Dr. Stark is looking at him anyway.
He refuses to accept it. He isn’t the preeminent engineer in Atlantis for nothing, and there has to be some kind of solution. The Humans wear special clothes and gear to visit them, and he knows he could do better than those ungainly things.
“I can’t use your personal blankets,” he says, but it’s a lie and too late anyway, and it’s not like Steve isn’t halfway wondering if he can smuggle one out without Dr. Stark knowing. Dr. Stark just pats him on the shoulder.
Steve ignored the twinge in his chest that always surfaced when he thought about the people he’d left behind.
It was excruciating listening to Tony’s muffled steps as he walked towards him, Steve’s whole body yearning for Tony to be closer, and he could feel his heart rate picking up, his body trembling in anticipation.
“Yeah, give me a sec,” he says and takes his microphone out. Get it together, Rogers, he thinks and gives himself a shake.
Tony had forced Fury to nullify their contract precisely to prevent that from happening, but when Steve had come back to New York, hadn’t some of the first words out of his mouth been about its validity?
Steve still looked skeptical, not that Tony could blame him, but he hadn’t accused him of lying outright or yelled at him, and that was encouraging. Maybe this could work after all. All he had to do was keep throwing one surprise after another at Steve, and the man could be almost civil.
Steve hadn’t known how Tony would react to seeing him again. There’d been a part of him that had foolishly hoped Tony would be glad, and even though he hadn’t actually expected that to happen, he hadn’t fully managed to convince himself that it wouldn’t either. It was how he would’ve felt if Tony had visited him.
he say? He would desperately love to take a minute to collect himself, to close his legs and pretend he’s okay, but it won’t change the fact that it happened. What it will do is prolong the exam, and Steve can’t do that to Dr. Stark. Not after all of … this, and not after he keeps being so damn kind. “Please keep going.”
He shouldn’t linger, however. No matter how much he wished he could. He’d intended to use his hands so he could watch Tony’s reactions, but regretfully, he decided it’d be faster with his mouth. Regretful, not because he didn’t want to, but because it’d been quite a while since he’d done it for anyone, and he’d enjoyed it the few occasions he’d done it before, had no doubt that he’d enjoy it even more now since it was with Tony. He would’ve liked to take his time. Still, there’d be opportunities for slow later, but Tony was already exhausted. It wouldn’t do to draw things out.
He walked back, sitting down on the edge of the mattress next to Tony in order to say goodbye. It made parts of him ache and throb in a way that had his cock twitching as he flashed back to what they’d done, on what Tony had done to him.
He could admit that denying himself did make him feel a little sadistic, though, so he pushed three fingers into Steve—still a little loose and a lot slick from earlier—before he would’ve otherwise, and his next bite was meaner than the previous one. He didn’t draw blood, but he was tempted, Steve’s body oh so lush and resilient. There was just something about him that made Tony want to bite down hard, harder, as hard as he could, and he’d had to remind himself more than once over the past however many minutes not to get carried away.
saved his life.  He knows, but he can’t help feeling deceived, can’t stop thinking that even though it’d been a business transaction, it’d been an honest one, something he’d entered with his eyes open, and if he’d been crazy enough to fall in love, well, it was no one’s fault but his own.  But this?  “Which parts weren’t a lie?”
He stared out the window of the helicopter and wondered what had Stark—Tony, he thought, a little curl of shame wriggling its way up his spine. Surely by now, he deserved to be called by his first name.
The knowledge still made Tony veer wildly between amazement and disbelief, with flashes of giddiness and terror thrown in just for the hell of it and moments where he felt so fragile that he thought a single word or look from Steve would make him shatter like glass.
“Yes,” Steve said, hesitating only a second before he leaned forward, kissing Tony the way he’d wanted to for days.
“I don’t mind. I like . . . it here,” Steve said, a small pause in his words, but it wasn’t long enough for Tony to think he wasn’t being honest. Tony had never had a hard time keeping people entertained, and furthermore, it wasn’t like before. Back then, Steve hadn’t been working, they’d been newly contracted, and Tony hadn’t known how much Steve really wanted to interact with the modern world. Now, however, Steve choosing to stay at Stark Tower had to be because he wanted to and not because it was the only option available to him.
So Tony takes his time, using his hands, his mouth, a few toys that he knows Steve particularly likes. He’s in no hurry, and it’s not like he’s not enjoying himself in the meantime.
“Download the fucking app, okay? Text him about something that doesn’t specifically have to do with Destiny. Grow some balls, fucking hell.” Bucky mutters the last part before raising his voice to say, “and then handle
One brunch wasn’t the same thing as Steve declaring his love for everyone to hear. Tony knew that, but he’d let a single event overshadow everything that had happened before it.
He’s been briefed.  Death threats, corporate espionage, possible terrorists, the need for a bodyguard, blah, blah, blah.  He gets it.
“Captain Rogers,” Fury said as the entered the workout room, and Captain America glanced at them, not stopping his magnificent display of flexing and twisting muscles as he pounded a hanging bag until he noticed Fury had brought along company.  Tony might have complained about the whole stopping thing, except then he was privileged to witness a sweating Captain America whose chest was heaving and whose nipples were straining against the thin, tight shirt he had on, and yeah, okay, he could deal with that.  “I have someone I want you to meet.”
“Tony is going to be your new Dom for a while,” Fury said, and oh no he didn’t. Tony hadn’t agreed to anything, and he wasn’t going to be known as the guy who’d been in breach of contract with
How long was long enough, though? They’d been living together for over a month now, and he’d still never taken Tony out on that date—even if he did have a good excuse as to why he’d been more than a little distracted lately. He still wanted to, however, but how was that supposed to work if they were keeping things a secret?
The walk to his place is … uncomfortable, although most of that’s because Steve honestly doesn’t know what to say. What
Stark searched his eyes for a long time, and whatever he saw there made his expression gradually change, confusion replacing the anger, until he finally said, “Okay,” letting go of his wrist. “Okay.”
On the day Peggy moved out, Steve stood naked in front of the mirror and looked at all the ragged lines running over his chest, arms and legs.  He felt like someone had taken a knife to him, slicing every inch of him open, and he didn’t understand how there wasn’t any blood.  He traced one particularly thick scar that ran over his chest, gritting his teeth against the pain, and remembered the first time he’d brought Peggy over to meet his family and all the teasing that had accompanied it.  He couldn’t imagine her scars ever disappearing, and in that moment, he didn’t want them to, didn’t want to ever expose himself to that much hurt again.  Once in a lifetime was enough.
He glanced down, reassuring himself that he at least didn’t have any stains on his clothes and that he wasn’t too rumpled. He even looked mostly presentable since he’d had to go into work—not that Tony had ever complained about the clothes Steve normally wore, or that worried about his own attire. Tony tended to wear what he wanted, be it a Tshirt and jeans one day, or a bespoke suit the next.
“I know what you’re doing,” Tony said when they reached the penthouse. Steve glanced back at Tony, but he kept heading towards Tony’s room. It was slow going since Tony was so tired, but they were almost there.
It’s like some horrible superpower really, and Steve should probably mind more than he does, but he can’t bring himself to be upset.  He likes being useful, and well, Tony puts him to use.  It’s comforting almost.  He’s never been the type of person to have people waiting on him, but there are people and machines to take care of the house, the lawn, the cars, and he likes being able to do something for Tony considering everything Tony does for the team.  Besides, unlike the majority of the rest of the world, Tony doesn’t want anything from
He groaned as he forced himself up to his knees and then to his feet, even though all he really wanted to do was to get his cuddle on with the floor mats and never leave them again.
He wished Tony were there suddenly, his heart clenching, wished Tony could see his daughter on her birthday and see all the things his sacrifice had made possible, all the people who had recovered and moved on after Thanos.
People didn’t stay with someone who had made them bleed like this, whose stupid, thoughtless actions caused this much pain, no matter how much they loved each—how much one person loved the other. They shouldn’t.
“Sorry, you just feel so good,” Tony said lightly, and it was fine. He was fine. “I didn’t expect you to come so soon,” he said, and it wasn’t much of a leer, but it accomplished what he wanted. Steve was beautiful when he blushed like that, but Tony couldn’t find it in him to appreciate it as much as he should’ve.
didn't have the time right now, so with a great deal of reluctance, Tony straightened, gripping onto Cap's shoulder for support.  "Sorry about that," he said, even though he wasn't sorry at all.
Steve's heart skipped a beat, and it wasn't in a good way.  He remembered all too well the "experimenting" that had gone on during the war, and he wasn't about to tolerate it happening again, government or not.  "Maya, if you're talking about human subjects—"
Tony turned around, glaring at him.  “What?  How can you have a bad feeling?  Just look at it.”  It was potential life.  Potential salvation.
A large part of Tony very much did want to go, and yet an equally large part also couldn't help but think about Steve.  Not just the fact that if Steve found his new booze, he'd just pour it down the sink again. But also just the fact that Steve would be so
There are, as there have always been, three words Tony has kept close to his heart.  Three words he wants to say so badly, but he never will.  He’s afraid, he thinks.  After Rumiko, maybe it’s best if he saves them for the person his words are for.  And he wonders, sometimes, if Steve is that person—but surely the universe wasn’t so cruel as to bind Tony to him.  After all, how many people have killed their own soulmates?
Or worse, Tony thought, remembering some of the stories he'd heard about their experimentation.  "Are you crazy?"
," Steve insisted.  "You can't have been.  Why didn't you say anything earlier?  We could have—have done something—we can still do something!  I'll amputate—"
It was Steve's turn to look away this time.  "I was wrong," he said again.  "I think… when we last talked, before I went under the ice, I was too quick to judge.  I saw all of the bad in what you'd done and none of the good.  And once that happened, it was just… so easy to let it build up in my head, to make myself think your intentions were worse than they were.  And it took me seeing you almost die today to realize I'd taken all this too far."  He glanced back at Tony then, meeting his eyes.  "I'm tired of being angry at you.  I miss you.  And no matter what I think of you—and no matter what
Well, Steve thought as he approached the pile.  Moving rocks and pieces of wood wasn't what he had envisioned using his super soldier serum for, but he supposed that nothing these days was what he'd envisioned, so he might as well roll with the punches.
it was kind of Tony's fault, because he'd been procrastinating and hadn't expected Steve to take over on the very day his decision was due, but still!  Art? He'd chosen
Suddenly, he’s sitting up as best as he can, looking back toward the light.  It’s further away now, but—but he can’t give up.  “Come back,” he says hoarsely, but the sound of his voice is lost to the ocean.  “C-come—come back—!”
Suddenly, there were sounds of a scuffle as Rogers did—something; it was too dark for Tony to really see, but it sounded like Rogers had jumped onto it from behind and was grappling with it.  “Shoot it!” Rogers shouted.
Tony had sworn to himself as soon as he’d gotten off the ship that he’d never set foot on one again, and for eighty long years, he does exactly that.
to wake up hungry tomorrow.  And then as soon as he was done, he set the bowl aside and started giggling, unable to help himself.
Rogers snorted at him, getting back onto the floor and nudging him toward the rope.  Tony frowned, confused.  “What are you doing?” he said.  “You want me to climb up first?”  Rogers moved and crouched down beneath the rope, so Tony took that as a yes, using him as a stepping stool as he grabbed on.  “Thanks,” he told him.  Even as a sabretooth, he was still very much Captain America, apparently.
wants this badly.  Maybe he should stop playing so they can move on.  So with that, he hooks his thumbs around the band of his pants and underwear, pushing it down, Tony helping to kick them off once they’re low enough—and then, just like that, they’re both naked, looking at each other in the dim light, breathing hard in the silence.  “Tony,” Steve says.
was fine.  But then a biter came a little too close to the home for his liking, stealing his attention away—and by the time it ambled off, his original thought had been scattered to the wind, and Steve didn't think of it again.
Blindly, he scooted closer to the paw, leaning forward to press his lips against it, the barest brush of skin against fur, and he whispered—“It wasn’t worth it.”
It was hidden inside a large bag propped up against the wall, which he supposed kept it from discovered immediately should someone step into the room, though its shape looked plenty obvious to him.  Still, as much as he wanted to take it out and touch it, he kept it in the bag for now, awkwardly sticking it under one arm as he finally went and answered the door to see Bucky on the other side, raising an eyebrow at him.  "What were you packing for, a vacation?" he demanded. "You said you were coming nearly five minutes ago."
"No," he said loudly, and without thinking, he clenched his fists and straightened, ready to defend himself if necessary.
“You’re good,” he breathes.  “So careful.  Are you always this careful?  Wait, no, don’t tell me.  Just—just keep doing this.”  He whimpers again when Steve leans up, licking a wet trail around his nipple, and Steve makes a quiet sound of his own when he feels a hand thread itself into his hair.  It’s strange to be on his back when he’s the one making the initiative, but he hardly minds, not with the way Tony is shifting and moving above him.  Steve thinks he can stay like this for ages, just touching Tony and listening to him whimper and moan.
?" Cap began, but Tony started up the engines as soon as Cap was situated, and in the next second, they were zooming out over the water, Cap letting out a startled sound behind him.  "Oh, my God!" he shouted over the roar of the motor and the wind.
What?  He looked back from the contents of the refrigerator, and yup, Steve was sitting about three yards away, completely out of Tony’ range.  There was no way he could’ve heard him.  And yet . . .
a choice, not for anything. He understood Tony was offering him a kindness, but now that he knew what his punishment was going to be, he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible; to be
He didn’t know how long he stood there, shifting his weight occasionally but trying to be silent in order not to disturb Tony. He considered sitting, but only for a second, because he realized the point wasn’t to be comfortable; it was to wait for Tony’s acknowledgment, just like Tony had waited for his. So Steve stood where he was, watching the ground, because he didn’t deserve to watch Tony, and he thought about being good, about earning Tony’s attention again.
Assuming Dr. Stark even wants to keep going. Maybe he’ll demand Steve leave or that they reschedule to when he can bring a nurse in with them in order to make sure
“It’s okay; you’re okay,” Tony said, bringing Steve’s face to the shelter of his chest.  “You were—but it’s okay now.  I’ve got you, I’ve—”
Bucky sighs, long and drawn-out, and nothing Steve’s said hasn’t been true, so he doesn’t know what’s he done to deserve it.
Tony knows fuck-all about flowers. He could point out a rose reliably--he’s given enough of them to his dates--but that’s about it. It wouldn’t normally be a problem since Pepper long ago hired a florist exclusively for Tony who provides tasteful date bouquets, birthday bouquets, get-well-soon bouquets, and of course, the ever popular, we’re-very-sorry-about-him-there’s-nothing-we-can do bouquets, but unfortunately, that’s not an option right now. He’s five minutes out from picking up the lovely Gabriella, and he may have accidentally just crushed her flowers.
“Tony,” Steve said, his tone already containing a note of pleading, and Tony smiled harder, showing teeth.
“Steve,” Tony said softly, his hands coming up to cradle Steve’s face, and part of Steve wanted to jerk away, didn’t want Tony to touch him, knew he didn’t deserve it and couldn’t stand the thought that Tony would try to comfort him.
, and the longer it went on, the more he hated it. He’d had a purpose when he was cleaning Tony’s lab, and when he’d been standing at the door, he could look at Tony occasionally from beneath his eyelashes, but like this …
Steve had to give himself a mental shake, adjusting his napkin to make sure his lap was covered, even though no one could actually see under the table. He had to stop doing that. Especially at work. SHIELD’s cafeteria was not the place to be entertaining thoughts of Tony.
Steve wanted to believe that, but even thinking about saying it during punishment made his stomach roil.
Steve though, Steve is special, and the fact that he thinks so is enough to make him bury his head in his hands and groan.
, Tony thinks and he doesn’t actually remember walking over to the hallway, but here he is. He tries to take a calming breath, but the scent is more concentrated now, and oh fuck, Steve smells really good. Like, really,
He didn’t know if he should be worried that Tony wanted him to not act like a man. Was it Tony’s way of saying that he thought the only way Steve could be good was if he couldn’t speak or act out?
It became a blur of fumbling hands and hastily shoved-aside clothes, but then Tony was astride his lap and Steve was pushing into him, tears forming in his eyes that he could have this again when he’d thought Tony was gone forever.
It was bad enough to be attracted to Tony, but letting himself act on that, or letting himself nurture that attraction, would’ve been … disrespectful, to Tony and to Pepper. And foolhardy. And for all that Steve put himself in the path of most resistance more times than not, he wasn’t actually a masochist, and allowing his feelings for Tony to grow the way they'd wanted to would’ve been setting himself up for pain.
It was the pain in Tony’s voice that finally reached him, that made him realize how selfish he was being, once again.
as it landed and headed toward the microphone, an eerie silence settling over the crowd. It looked older than Tony had when he’d died, and anger burned in Steve’s chest for a second that it would
The whole thing had actually been a lot easier than he’d expected.  Agents were scurrying around like their tails were on fire, so something big had to be going on.  Lucky for him.
, Tony thought, his hand still tingling from where he’d gotten a good handful of Steve’s ass.  Damn.  Seriously.
“The wider your legs get, the faster and deeper the dildo will go. Up to a certain point, of course. All you have to do if you want to slow things down or need a break is to push your legs closed. Do you understand?”
“Just . . . just think about it, okay?  He’s not one of those one-hit wonders you’ve been seeing lately, and he deserves more.  He deserves better.”  She hugged him, squeezing tightly.  “We’re going to go.  You’ve got more important things to do right now than talk to us.”
It’d been . . . it’d been good to see her. Tough if in its own way, because of all the associations she had for him, but still good.
“At least you know what some of the danger signs are now, so something like this won’t happen again,” he said, squeezing him gently. He let out a long sigh, closing his eyes. “I can’t say it’s a good thing, but better that it happened here, with me, than with someone you’re serious about later on.”
Even knowing all the individual steps they’d taken, he still didn’t understand how they’d gotten to the point where Steve could possibly believe that.
“I know you don’t.” Steve covered his eyes with his hands. “That’s the way you are. You see me hurting, and it matters to you more than the fact that you’re hurting too.”
That opens up a new cornucopia of delights, the soft but firm texture, the gratifying way his tentacle can wrap around Steve’s cock, making it twitch and flex in his grip as he undulates against it, and the taste! Steve is a treasure trove of different flavors all over his body, and Tony wants to bask in every one.
That was arousing too, though, the idea that he couldn’t hide anything from Tony, that every jerk and shiver were out in the open for him to read. By that point, though, everything seemed exciting, even the knowledge that it didn’t matter how affected Steve was, because he was waiting on Tony.
“I didn’t agree,” he said, and apparently he hadn’t made himself clear. “Nick and Tony nullified the contract. I only found out about it after it was done.”
One-point-five, this made the time after an orgasm very intense, quickly catapulting into oversensitivity, which, oh, hypothetically, could make the user tense up more. It shouldn’t be a problem considering item two:
“Are you sure you don’t want me to take some more days off?” Steve asked, even though he was already dressed and getting ready to head in for his first day at SHIELD headquarters.
It’s only when Steve sits that he realizes Tony’s stripped the blanket and put a towel—a few towels, Steve notices, seeing where the corners don’t completely match up—across the mattress for Steve to lie on. Not that Steve had needed them, since he may or may not have gotten out his heat sheets this morning, but Tony hadn’t known that.
“We’ll have to replace the couches with a bed, and I hope you’re a heavy sleeper, because I am in and out of here at all times of the night, but I—”
“Come here,” he panted, grabbing Steve’s face and pulling him down for one kiss, for two, kept kissing him until he felt drunk with it and then kissed him some more.
Before taking the serum, Steve had never really fantasized about being overpowered. He hadn’t hated the thought of someone being able to manhandle him, but it hadn’t been something he looked for either. His dreams had centered around a Dom who’d treat him with a firm but just hand, one that wouldn’t be upset because he had his own opinions or who felt like he needed to fade into the background. He’d wanted someone who wouldn’t be afraid to push his boundaries but also wouldn’t be disappointed when they hit them either, who wouldn’t haven’t felt like Steve was a failure just because his body couldn’t do everything he wanted it to do.
Dr. Stark must too, because he looks down again, and Steve doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, but he lets out a gush of slick in response, as if his body knows it has Dr. Stark’s attention and is doing everything it can to show him just how willing and fertile Steve is.
“I don’t need any help,” Captain America protested, but he shuddered when Tony’s hand touched his chest, and when Tony closed the door, he didn’t seem to notice, staring at him with eyes that were glazing over.
And then later, after Loki escaped, Tony couldn’t keep his mask in place, letting Steve glimpse exactly how much he mourned Coulson’s death. He’d never seen Tony so affected. He’d never seen Tony so vulnerable.
him anything. The only thing he’d insisted Steve do was research Submissives’ rights. Even then, once Steve had a few web pages up, Stark had simply grunted and then wandered away rather than ensuring Steve had read any of it. Which he had, of course, but still.
“Good, now come here. You can walk,” Tony said when Steve hesitated, embarrassed by his cock—which was bare and in front of Tony, so of course it was going to get hard—and he blinked before remembering that he was going to have to crawl everywhere from now on.
“Promise me.” He lifted his chin as Tony placed biting kisses against his neck, little shivers traveling down his back. “You can’t leave me like that again, Tony,” he begged, his voice breaking as he remembered burnt and jagged wounds, and he knew that Tony couldn’t guarantee his safety, knew he couldn’t either, but he didn’t want to hear reason from Tony right now. He needed the blind assurance that he would always have Tony with him, so he didn’t give him a chance to respond, just drew Tony’s head up so he could kiss him again and swept him up in his arms.
He had never, not once, ever seen Tony Stark face to face.  He had never had an actual conversation with him. He had never known what it was like to just - to just be in the same room as him, and he never would.
At long last, classes were over, and Steve trudged back to his room, just about ready to pass out even though it was still light outside.  He supposed he could at least hold out until dinner, though even that simple plan was foiled when Ty poked his head into his room, seeing Steve lying face down on the bed.  "Change of dinner plans," he said.
That seems to be English enough for Steve, who blinks and goes pale.  “Flooding,” he repeats.  “You mean—we’re going to sink?”
Tony hesitated, unsure if he was supposed to guess or say something else.  Was the guy a mascot instead? "Food that actually tastes good?" he tried. The porridge had certainly been nothing special.
Steve looks so frail, so small.  It’s hard to believe a man like this could have ever led the nation as Captain America, but that had always been part of the magic that was Steve Rogers.  It wasn’t his height or his strength or even his shield that had made him so extraordinary—it was his fierce loyalty, his unwavering trust, his devotion to justice.
He’s emptying the pot when his father storms into the room, and he groans, leaning back in his chair.  “Did Sunset come running to you?” he asks.  “Are you here to defend her honor?”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut.  "He wanted me to stay," he said softly.  "I should have listened.  If I'd been there, maybe things would have been different."
his frozen skin crackling and breaking as he does so—and he looks at the light.  A light in the middle of the ocean that’s not the sun or the moon.  Why is there a light here?  What business does such a thing have among the dead?
Soon enough, the airship came into view, but Tony was distracted by movement off to the side.  He scrubbed his watering eyes, focusing them in time to see—a man?  Not walking.  In a—a wheelchair?
Steve blinked.  Or, well, he supposed technically he winked, since he was still standing in the foyer where Ma was holding the cold compress to one of his eyes.  "I did?" he asked, trying to remember. If something like that had happened, then surely it would have stood out to him. He and Dougie fought pretty much every day, and he was pretty sure yesterday had been no exception.
"I do," Cap said.  He reached into one of his pouches and pulled them out, showing them to Tony.  "They snapped together on their own, but you can still pull them apart with enough force.  Like magnets."
"Okay," Steve said, even though he couldn't help but feel as though he was missing something.  "So your—"
Rogers poured a mug of hot water, then added the instant coffee mix, stirring before sliding it to Tony’s side.  “I like it,” he offered.
The other man pauses, turning his head to look at him.  “I didn’t,” he says.  “I realized I already knew.”  He gives him a tiny smile, then goes back to studying the keys.  “These—these are all brass.”  Steve opens his mouth to tell him to go back up, but before any words have a chance to come out, Tony holds up one hand.  “I know what you’re going to say, and I already told you, I’m not going to listen.  Look, I’m—I’m going to check out the other rooms.  Maybe they’ll have something.  But I’ll be back, I
Stark sighed, and for a moment Steve was afraid he was going to delay this response, too.  "First off, that wasn't a question, that was a judgment.  Second, you didn't seem willing to push her off, and if you hadn't, she would have bit you.  Third, she only counted as alive in the most technical sense.  She was dead already in every way that mattered."
Jarvis smiled (and Steve relaxed, because whew, this was indeed Jarvis) and stood up.  "I'll be attending to my other duties then," he said. "Please call out if my assistance is required."
Tony’s hand slides away, and the moment ends.  “Maybe,” he says, his fingers running against the cool metal of the rail.  “And so do you.  But we can’t always get what we want.”  He draws back then, looking at Steve, his eyes melancholy.  “I’d better head back before my father sends people out to hunt for me,” he continues wryly.  “Thank you for tonight.  I think that that was the most fun I’ve had in my entire life.  I’ll see you later, okay?”
But this was different.  This was Tony alone in his room, and no one was going to unexpectedly intrude.
.  Steve is itching to wrap his lips around him and do incredibly inappropriate things, but no, he really shouldn’t.  It’s unprofessional!  And Steve is an
Steve exhaled sharply, turning his attention back to the biters.  "You want to fight?" he called at them.  His shield went swinging as he started to run down the field, being as noisy as possible to deter any of the ones who might have otherwise been inclined to follow after Tony's smell or the fading sounds of his coughing.  He could feel his wound starting to bleed sluggishly again with the movement, but there was no time to do anything about it right now.  Instead, he just kept on running, bowling down any biters in the way and keeping an eye out for an exit route.  Not long after, he caught sight of another set of staircases leading up, and he made a beeline for it, feet pounding with every step.
"Really?" Tony said.  He smiled a little, face full of fragile hope.  "If you want to stick around, I'm certainly not going to complain."
Cap looked hesitant.  Eventually, though, he nodded, pushing it back into the foam and leaning away.  "You'd better call the shots here," he said.  But he smiled right after, and it made Tony feel better after he had seemed so dazed just a moment earlier.  "You've done this before, after all."
From there, he heads west.  He starts a company.  He works with airplanes and electricity and radio and he changes the world.  When the Great War rolls around, he fights as a pilot.  And when the next world war shakes the earth, he spends his days designing fighter jets for the United States, and he is famous and immortalized and loved by a nation.
Tony wondered what she was thanking Cap for.  He also wondered when she'd started calling him that as well.  But he decided to be good and not pry, especially because he preferred to get Cap out of the room right now instead of engaging him in conversation.  "Hey," he said, turning his head toward Cap.  "Don't you need rest too?"
They stumble out onto the deck hours later, grinning ear to ear and clinging to each other’s hands.  At this time of night, the place is deserted, which is probably for the best.  “You were impressive in there,” Steve tells him as they make their way to the rail, gazing out over the ocean.  “I think you just about stomped out every rich-man stereotype they had.”
Steve thought about the routes he'd seen on the map.  "We could go back north, where the river branches into the Naugatuck?"
Tony rubbed his forehead.  That was the hard part.  He'd spent a lot of time staring at the translated oracle bones, but without any good reference images or maps of Yinxu it was difficult to associate any potential places mentioned with locations in the city.  Even being here now wasn't as helpful as he had hoped—there was so much to cover, and he could already tell from a quick look around that there were several spots that would need investigation.  Still, they had to try.  "We know it was buried in a tomb," he said.  "Most likely an important person's tomb, because this was an important artifact.  Assuming the place is structured like other cities from this era, it means there was an ancestral shrine built on top.  The shrine probably won't exist anymore, but the base of it should.  If we can find one that was rounded—a circle—that's a big clue."
“Hey,” Steve says softly.  “Don’t beat yourself up over it.  The important thing is that you’re okay.  And you’re gonna get better.  I know you have some fight in you left.”
The thought had barely articulated in his head when a sharp movement caught his eye, and to his great surprise, Tony was here, his shovel swinging to take down the biters.  "Tony!" he called, but the other man didn't seem to even register it—he slashed the shovel to take the head off one biter, then knocked another one down onto its back before jabbing the sharp end of the shovel into its forehead.  "Tony!" he tried again.
He straightened after that, glancing around the room.  Rhodey looked contemplative.  Pepper was staring at the photos.  Jarvis was drumming his fingers against his arm.  "You've been quiet, J," Tony said.
believe in the most scientifically-likely reason for Steve's existence, which would have been him developing some sort of time-displaced other personality who occasionally took over for a day.  Instead, he'd come up with another idea, even if it meant accepting that maybe the impossible was actually possible.
Confused, he shifts his hips, sticking his hand into his pocket and pulling the item out, and his breath catches.  It’s the ring.  Not the awful, giant one Steve had drawn him in, but the other one.  The one he’d originally meant for Sunset.  He turns it in his hands, enthralled, remembering showing it to Steve earlier, mere hours ago.  Jesus, by now it feels like a lifetime.
"I love you too, darling," Tony said, and he slumped back against the tree, chest heaving.  His eyes fluttered shut, and he forced them open again through what seemed like an immense amount of effort, meeting Steve's gaze.  "Always."
A biter came right up to them, and Steve swung with his shield, hitting it solidly in the head.  It went down, but there were more coming.  "And Tony," he continued with another glance back, "I'll die right here too, because I'm not leaving my men behind, and I'm not fucking leaving you behind, either!"
It seemed like Pepper was at the helm regardless, because the airship shuddered and jerked before tilting upward abruptly.  Tony let out a yell and tightened his hold on Cap, terrified he was going to lose him, and then there was screaming and something exploded and Tony had no idea what was happening; all he knew was he couldn't
Steve whimpers and whines and writhes as Tony continues to lick at him like he’s the best thing he’s ever tasted, toes curling.  Tony must have done this before.  He must have done this a
Steve looks up at him in surprise.  Tony seems pretty serious about this.  “Okay,” he says.  “Sorry.”
It was an astute observation, and Tony was both surprised and pleased that Cap had put it forward.  "You're not wrong," he said.  "Alright.  We're all still carrying our transceivers, right?  No one lost theirs on the way over?  Replacements cost extra."  Rhodey rolled his eyes, which was a good enough sign for Tony to continue on.  "If Cap sees trouble, he'll send out the distress signal.  As long as we're not too far away, our transceivers will start vibrating out SOS."  He had to admit, the idea was something he was pretty proud of.  It was quieter than audio and wouldn't force the receiver to have to pay constant attention like they would have if it were visual.  "If that happens, we regroup and go from there.  Hopefully, that doesn't actually happen.  What I'd prefer is that one of us finds something useful, and we send the signal for
He drifted quietly over to the laptop, sitting down and reaching out to run his hands over the hard surface.  It was, of course, not the same laptop he'd used back in boarding school; that thing was ancient technology by now.  But it was still a laptop, and if Steve had been able to figure out the old one, then…
There was another door, as it turned out, one that swung open after a few well-placed strikes from Cap's shield.  It didn't lead up or down—it led, instead, to another room, one lit by only whatever was coming from outside the room.
There was a pause, and Steve could tell that Tony was deciding if he could trust her or not.  "It's not," he finally agreed.  "It's meant to mass-deliver biological or chemical agents."
In any case, Tony was still home for the summer, and Steve had been free to do as he pleased for the day.  From listening to the voicelogs, it was clear that Tony was taking this time to work on several projects. While Steve wished he could help, he knew enough to know that any contributions he made, whether to Tony's plans or the physical prototypes or the - what was it called again, "software"? - would do more harm than good.
Tony had to admit that wasn't something he was particularly looking forward to.  Still, he could deal with it.  "So which one is your favorite?"
This time, the blast hit, and the plane swerved off toward the trees, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake.  A loud sound seconds later told them what happened to it.  Pepper pulled the wire away in the meanwhile, then sagged against Tony, breathing hard.
"Of course," Stark said softly, gazing at the wall behind Steve's head, "we didn't actually realize that at first.  Everything had happened so quickly.  All we knew was that the bite was fatal.  We thought getting
Breakfast was just as bad as Steve had imagined it’d be, albeit for a completely different set of reasons. Tony kept up a light-hearted commentary about the food and the employees who came in and out for most of it, and while Steve tried to join in, he couldn’t seem to think of much to add. The two of them eventually fell silent, but he could feel Tony’s concerned glances like a weight against his skin.
Tony had to still want him, because if he didn’t … if lust wasn’t there anymore, what could Steve hope for? What was left?
Life is different in the Compound.  Do you remember the days right after the First?  People running, screaming; people dying.  I am trying to keep Them back, trying to keep you and everyone else in the Compound as safe as I can.  Yes, it’s dangerous.  We’ve lost a lot of good people here.  But knowing that you’re back there, you and Bruce and everyone else who’s looking for a cure, it keeps me going.  It gives me the strength to keep fighting so that we can have a better world and maybe get back to the way things were before.  One day.
Steve’s stomach clenched, his thoughts about Hill scattering, and it was all he could do to remain in place. Tomorrow morning? What about the rest of the night?
“For a while now, yeah.” He forced himself to straighten and ignore the pain.  “This one’s not that bad though, although it might take me a little longer to get back than I’d initially thought.  Two miles east of town?  I’ll get the truck,” he said and started figuring out the route he should take in order to get away.
“It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle.”
Tony watched Steve’s chest move as he took a deep breath, his shoulders squaring before he did as Tony had asked. He could tell Steve had tried to wipe any expression off his face, but he’d been heartbreakingly unsuccessful.
Steve considered looking back at Bucky but decided against it.  His mind was still trying to process everything.  He'd found Bucky, lost him, and now he'd been bitten.  It had taken, what, all of five minutes?  "What about it?"
Steve couldn't argue with that logic.  With one last glance at the mirror, he went to go back to the bed, where he could finish the job there.
“It was amazing,” Steve corrects, rolling his eyes and running his fingers through Tony’s hair.  “That better?”
share his life with her the way she needed him to, and in the end, that was what caused her to leave.
In return, Tony writes Steve emails as well, sometimes about whatever supervillains he runs into here on the west coast and sometimes about whatever he and the company have been doing.  He brings up the people he’s dating once or twice, writing about how maybe he’ll have better luck with his words on this side of the country, but drops it after Steve pointedly ignores the topic in his replies.  Every now and then, one of them will mention the past.  Every now and then, one of them will mention regret.
Tony frowned, looking at the cat, then the shield, then back at the cat again.  And that was when he realized what was going on.
—even though this was different from his other missions, where he already knew what the hell he was looking for, he still had hope that there
“Okay,” Carol says, and for a while, the two of them stand in the hall in silence, interrupted only by the occasional surgery updates.
He’s already in the air by the time Carol gives him the hospital name and room, soaring across the country as she tells him the details.  Apparently Steve had been taking a late-night walk when he’d encountered a gang fight and broken them up, and from there one of the victims, still frightened, had shot him at close range.  “Can you believe it?” Carol asks when she’s done.  “The guy’s fought Kang.  Ultron.  The Red Skull.  And in the end, it’s some civilian kid that gets the drop on him.”
But the thing was - Tony wasn't sure if that was actually what he wanted.  Okay, so the few times the switch had happened so far, some inconvenient things had occurred.  For starters, his performance in track had been suffering, not to mention some of his coursework, and only the fact that it was nearing the end of the school year where things didn't matter so much anymore was saving him.  ("I opened a C-P-P file without help today!" Steve had reported in one of his voicelogs. "But oh my God, Tony, why does it say "void" everywhere? And how come there are so many pointy brackets?" Perhaps unsurprisingly, someone from 1940 who had been abruptly thrown half a century into the future was
Finally, the man spoke again.  "In any case, your friend has joined us.  I would much rather include him in the conversation, don't you think?"
Yeah, he did, Steve had to agree privately.  Some people just liked wielding power over others, and it was clear which categories Dougie and Steve fell into.  Still, it could be worse. Dougie could have picked on someone even weaker. As much as Steve didn't enjoy sporting a fresh bruised eye all the time, it was worth it if it protected someone else from incurring Dougie's wrath.
Tony considered it.  Yeah, he could buy that, based on the next few drawings.  “I guess they thought intentionally sacrificing things to them was better than getting mauled.”
Two hours later, he’s back in California, but he doesn’t land on the roof of his office or his home.  Instead, he finds himself in the poppy reserve he and Steve had spent so much time in back when things had been so perfect, and that’s where he ultimately lands.
The next six months pass in something of a haze.  Tony still goes on solo missions as Iron Man.  He keeps in touch with the usual—Steve, Rhodey, Happy, Pepper.  He gets some of his credibility and funds back.  He considers, for a while, sleeping around in an attempt to soothe some of the pain, but it feels wrong, so he doesn’t.
Tony hesitated, torn between the desire to just end this and blast a hole in him, or hold out for more answers.  He spared a quick glance at Cap, who was looking at the two of them intently.  His shield was still out.  Deciding to take a chance, Tony flipped up the faceplate with one hand, then held the gauntlet out in front of him again.  "I'm looking."
One thing was for sure - he couldn't stay.  Gripping his head in a vain attempt to stop the pounding, he managed to stumble out of bed without making too much noise, spotting what looked like his shirt lying on the floor and pulling it on.  Then, with a glance back at Ty to make sure Steve hadn't woken him, he left the room, shutting the door behind him.
, and Tony nearly stepped backward in shock.  Now that he'd said it—yes, he recognized him, even though his face was gaunt and his hair gone.  "You're supposed to be in jail," he said.
Tony shook his head again.  "It's not just that," he said.  "Steve, do you know what we need for a airborne distribution mechanism besides something to distribute?  We need a way to power it."  He laid his hand over his chest.  "I designed it to use the fusion reactor.  It's the most reliable thing there is."
“It’s not a heat reading, so it’s not lava,” Tony replied, rolling his eyes.  “And I’m not asking you to dig any holes.”  Wouldn’t that be hilarious, though?  Captain America with a shovel.  “There’s something else I’m picking up.”  He wandered over to a large rock nearby, brushing his fingers against it.  “Look.”
"Oh, my God," came a hushed voice from beside him, and Steve turned to confirm what he already knew—it was Tony.  Somehow, it was Tony, even though they had parted ways, even though Steve was supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean.  "You're awake."
At that, Steve bolted upward, even if it made his head spin, and Tony was quick to support him.  "Natasha," he snarled.  "She must have—Bucky
Except - well.  He'd been dreaming for all of two minutes and he was already conscious of the fact that he wasn't exactly a
“Let’s not forget that I’m the one providing you with an awesome clubhouse,” Tony replies sourly, taking hold of Steve’s hand to more giggles, mostly from Jessica and goddamn Luke, of all people.
"Well, that was disgusting," she said, turning to face a door in the back of the cafeteria before freezing.  "Oh, my God."  Before Steve could ask her what was wrong, she ran over to one the biters Steve had crippled, kneeling by its side and taking its head into her hands.  It struggled and gnashed its teeth at her, but she seemed unafraid.  Steve watched, ready to act if it attacked her, as she ran a thumb against a grayish cheek, whispering something to herself—"You deserved better, Peter," he thought he heard, and then the next thing he knew, she'd jammed her knife into its skull, and it went still.
Tony exhaled softly, feeling at peace in Steve's arms, like this was where he was supposed to be.  "I wouldn't have changed a thing," he said.
She was frozen in place for a moment, clearly shocked, and Steve realized he probably had done the wrong thing.  He was about to pull away when she at last moved, wrapping her own arms around him tight and holding him close. "Oh, Tony," he heard her murmur against his neck.  "So sweet." They remained like that for a little while until she was the one to finally pull away, smiling and patting his cheek. "You should go to bed now, though," she said.
should, either," Tony replied.  It didn't seem like Cap was deterred, though, because he was starting to carefully unwrap the bandages around his arm.  Well, if Cap was going to be stubborn, Tony supposed he could be stubborn right back.  "And what do you mean, we're not here to talk about you?  You saved my life by jumping in front of a barrage of arrows.  That's worth commenting on."
Tony can’t imagine what he might have written while in the process of losing his mind.  It probably wasn’t good, whatever it was.  “You forgive me?” he asks, half teasing.
Tony struggled to come up with a response.  First it was that Steve had been found, and then it turned out Steve was alive, and
But what exactly could he do right now, anyway?  For all he knew, if he stepped out the door, he'd run into one of the woman's friends.  Maybe they'd been taken to this room because all the other rooms were already occupied.
“Not too fast.”  Before he knew it, Rogers was by his side, slipping an arm around him.  Tony tried to shimmy away, and his confusion must have showed on his face, because Rogers continued, “You’re injured.  Don’t you need help walking?”
There was a long pause.  Then Tony sucked in a deep breath, turning away.  "…No," he admitted at last.  "But I should have done more than I did."
“Power detector,” Tony replied, flipping a switch and turning it to look at the display.  “It can track different types of power.  Electric, magnetic, nuclear… you name it.  It’s bound to show us something more interesting than just wandering around aimlessly.”
If that last bit of the voicelog was anything to go by, though, it seemed like he'd still have to keep an eye out.  It was strange, the thought of having a Pa again. His own had passed away so long ago. But he'd deal with it when the time came.
anymore, was he?  His limbs were longer than his own, real-life-Steve limbs, much less the tiny arms and legs he vaguely remembered flailing about with all those years ago.  They were thicker, too. And he was shirtless and goodness, that was some view, looking down.
Fury almost smiled.  Almost.  "The point is, we know things, and it's been documented, even if you're not on the need-to-know list.  But it's fine.  You need more than what this folder is giving you.  That's why I have this."  He reached into his jacket, then set a small jar on the table.
"We'll be able to land," Tony replied as the airship gave another lurch.  That was the nicest phrasing he could think of.  He pulled away, unsteadily making his way toward Cap and the suit.  "Think you can help me in there?"
Images of his completed homework, of unfamiliar handwriting, of a mysterious phrase all flashed across his mind, but he tried to forget them.  If he followed the train of thought those memories were attempting to lead him toward, he was going to end up someplace very strange, and he didn't think he was ready for that.
"I'd definitely rather be up here than down where you are," Jessica replied with a soft snort.  "I'll just be slow catching up, that's all.  Look, there's not much time—I gotta go now.  Remember, head for the cafeteria!"
But Rumiko is different, he knows.  She wears a mask, but she’s honest about it, telling him about how she doesn’t want to be confined the way her parents want her to be.  She shows him her wrists, but not to convince him they’re meant to be: they’re as blank as his own, having been covered with makeup.  “I don’t listen to my parents or my elders or anyone,” she tells him fiercely as they sit together on a mountainside, picnicking.  “So why should I pay attention to some random words on my arm?  If I go and hang around a super smart ladies’ man, it’s because that’s what I choose to do.”
Three months?  Tony had avoided calls from one-night stands for longer.  He could do three months.  It wasn’t like they were getting married after all, and exclusivity didn’t have to be part of the contract . . . although shit, Captain America.  They’d probably make Tony keep it in his pants if he weren’t keeping it in . . . wow, okay, distracting thought.
After the incident in the gym, he’d been worried Stark would want to talk about what happened, but he’d never brought it up and never acted any differently towards him.
“Fuck, you’re so hot like this,” Tony breathed, bowing his head so he could watch as he slid his cock against Steve’s exposed hole, over and over, but never entering. “I could come just from—”
“I see that,” Tony said, and there was something in his voice that made Steve’s knees flex, made him want to fall to his knees and suck Tony’s fingers into his mouth. “Sore at all?” Tony asked, wet fingers making an idle pattern on the inside of Steve’s thigh as they inched up higher and higher.
Warning: More breath control play. This is probably going to be a theme now, so this will be the last time I warn about it (unless I write a really extreme scene, which I don't see myself writing at this point, but just in case).
Steve tsks softly, but with one last stroke, he lets him go, looking up at him expectantly.  Tony curses again.
Steve had never shared a bed with anyone, except for the times when he'd been young and crawled into Ma's bed so that she could protect him from the bogeymen in the closet.
Steve didn't think he'd relaxed since he'd been brought out of the ice all those weeks ago, but he nodded anyway.  Tony reached out to take his hand and squeeze it, and Steve squeezed back before sleep took him once more.
"There might be a way," Rhodey said from the floor, where he was still sitting near the tile Cap had triggered.  He motioned them closer, then shone his flashlight along the row of tiles that included the rigged one.  Tony realized now that Rhodey had dusted some of them.  "Take a look.  The tiles in the entrance—the ones we've mostly been standing on—are plain.  But starting with this row, and probably continuing until where the skeleton is, the tiles have patterns along the edges.  They're thin, and the dust is obscuring a lot of the markings, but they're there.  But most importantly—"  He jabbed at two of the tiles with his brush.  "The pattern seems to be the same for each tile, but they have different characters engraved into the top right corner.  That might be a clue as to which tiles are safe and which ones aren't."
“That was the gossip of the day, back during the war,” Steve says as he turns to raise an eyebrow at Tony, who holds his breath and prays he hasn’t been busted.  But Steve just turns away again, looking contemplative.  “But I’ve never shown my words to anyone.”
It looked like it might have once been a small city—albeit one that hadn’t made it very far in architectural advances—though now it’d fallen into disrepair, the crude structures crumpled and broken.  At least, that was what the small amount that was actually illuminated by their flashlights looked like, anyway.  “An underground city,” Tony said, barely able to contain the glee in his voice.  “Can you believe it?  There’s got to be something interesting here.”
And so they went.  Not long after that, they were on another street—a street Steve had known well, one that he had come to and left from nearly every day of his life, back when Ma was alive.  God, he was so glad she wasn't here to see this place now—especially because of the bodies.  Heaven help him, but there were so many bodies here.  Some were decayed or mangled beyond identification.  Most were people he didn't know.  But then he caught sight of one of his old neighbors, her lifeless body caught under a car, and he gagged, Tony coming up behind him and rubbing his back.  "It's okay, Steve," he tried to soothe.
It was when the row called "HARD_DATA" was highlighted that Steve made a breakthrough.  He'd hit the key labeled "enter", and the next thing he knew, the original text rows were gone, replaced with a whole new set of rows.  The first one, which was already lit up, was called "CA_forarmy.gif". Steve pressed "enter" again, which then brought up a black-and-white image of a man in some kind of full-body getup and an A on his head pointing at him and captioned "I want YOU for U.S. Army".  Another row called "CA_salutebonds.gif" revealed the same man from the first picture saluting the viewer. "Cap salutes you for buying war bonds," it proclaimed.
