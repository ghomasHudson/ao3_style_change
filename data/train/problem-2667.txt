You have so much to learn about so many things, my love. It is going to be my pleasure to educate you. MH
"That does sound interesting, too bad, she never contacted me!"
Maybe. SH
“It’s only that we think that he didn’t read –”, one detective explains before a colleague interrupts him.
“Sherlock...” Mycroft gingerly moves a hand over his brother’s, unsure of the reaction. Breathing better when he didn’t push him away, he continues, “you can’t help all the kids in the street, all the lost souls, all the young adults who just don’t know what to do to fit in!” They stay silent for a bit, both thinking about Sherlock’s past, but not for the same reason.
"Imagine that he doesn't love him anymore, what if even their friendship is over? Can we take that risk?" The image of his brother, high as a kite in a drug den, springs to his mind. "You know what I'm talking about, we can't take that risk, we can't tell him. He's not ready!"
Overwhelmed by the events, Sherlock was only able to ask a blunt, "what..."
not a lot and really not perfect... My life nowadays! I need a Juan to get me out of trouble lol
We are newlyweds, we can do whatever the hell we want! GL
"It's the perfect disguise, I may even go back to work now that my mission against you is over."
The doctor rapidly opens the door – happy to be able to do so from the inside. Turning on his heel, he watches as his student remains in the closet, quickly tapping on his phone. “This is not the time to chat on Instagram or whatever Gallagher!” John protest, “maybe you didn’t realize, but they were dealing drugs. In a classroom!” As Sherlock stays silent, texting everything to Lestrade while watching the security cameras outside to get a visual on the men, John rushes to open the light.
Don't want to be blunt, but if you want this to go further I need to ask. How much does a doctor make a year in the Isle of Wight? Do you get a bonus because you're so far away? I don't want to work, so I --
"Do you -"
and young people do not generally like those who stand out too much, attract too much attention.”
"No!" He was trying to push tears of rage "NO! You listen! YOU know how I suffered when he... when I thought he was dead. All this for what? Playing whatever game his majesty found amusing at the time?" Looking at his watch, he utters coldly, "you've got 6 minutes left. Choose your words wisely."

It's been nearly a week now and you  haven't replied. In fact, I need to be honest, the message was not from LondonSleuth, but from us, Greg and Molly. Both friends of the wonderful man we were talking for without his knowledge. What we said in his profile and the message that we sent was as truthful as we could make it. It's what we think he would have written for himself if he could...
Dear Sleepless in Yaverland,
After a shower, a bit longer than usual but certainly not because of one ex-army doctor, he is ready to leave.
Re-reading the message of the anonymous that his sister posted, a slight smile appears in John's face.
Stepping away from his old nanny, he sniffed and wiped his eyes.
Do you have anything in mind? SH
Bidget is about to shout to the older man to fuck off when he finally hears the murmurs around him.
What about Sherlock?
"Of all the manipulative..." John mutters, still angry but unable to just go back to his chair to sulk, "for the Grace of God... I'm going to kill you one day, you know!" Extending his hand, he quickly drops it in the exterior pocket of the posh suit.
Once in front of the still uncooperative nurse, a man suddenly appears near him, making him jump.
Using the nearest bench as leverage, Sherlock rises and sits. Defeated. "Okay... Can I just be alone for a bit, please." Not wanting to leave him, the men hesitate until the detective murmurs lightly, "i'm in a bloody church, what can happen to me? Go home."
“You were alone? I’m sure that you were a brilliant kid and –“
“Oh no... Doctor Watson, it’s not a prank.”
Isn't perfect?
After a few minutes, the cleaning team shows up, opening the rooms one by one. Turning off the light and re-locking the door when the cleaning is done. The moment they enter the third room, the lecturer runs to the door and applies a paste before the cleaning staff ends the job and closes the door for the night.
The voice of a fellow officer resonated behind him. “
He was deep in his thoughts, trying to find the will to go on, when a mocking tone brought him back.
, he finds a little door on the side of the church and hides, waiting for the end of the ceremony to...
“Better listen to your sister, Doctor Watson, bring the envelope to the Palace Casa in Cartagena and don’t talk to the police.” The ominous voice said, chuckling, “if you love your sister of course.”
That bastard is getting away! Hey cops, his name is Bidget! #KingsCollege #GetThatBastard
"I thought about that the other day. Do you want to present something to my students?"
Holding Mycroft closely, not wanting to let him go, he asks hesitantly,
“You, bastard!” John is about to push the lanky git away and shout about how ‘not good’ it is to taunt an ex-soldier when Lestrade, Anderson and Donovan enter the room.
Watson, quickly sobering up, grabs William before his head knocks on the floor. “Gallagher... William... Are you all right?” He finally breathes when the young man starts to cough and finally reopens his eyes.
“I’m so sorry John... so so sorry.” Motioning to the street around them, he apologizes, “it wasn’t supposed to be like that… we were supposed to be in the restaurant, I didn’t plan anything!” He pauses as pink appears on his cheeks, “of course I gave that address not far from Angelo’s to the killer, so I knew that it was an option –”
“It’s the proof of an open mind for someone as homophobic as you to know such a word, I am really proud of you!” He jokes, unable to stay silent. He didn’t wait long for a reaction as he was once more brutally shoved against the ancient bricks wall, distinctly feeling the blood dripping from the back on his head now.
"Oh, do shut up, Ms. Hudson!"
A shiver of disgust ran thru his spine at the idea. He had done it decades ago, of course, but the interaction needed to do it still left a bad feeling in his mouth.  As he was against violence, he used to simply ensnare his chosen ‘victim’… with the obvious disadvantage of having to deal with them until his voluntarily boorish attitude finally broke the spell.
You're right. I don't want a flatmate. SH
He is about to start to look under the lab tables when Gallagher finally replies.
Finally able to get the over-eager restaurateur/former criminal’s attention, the detective shakes his head, “no, Angelo, not wine, maybe later.  I’m waiting for someone and anyway I should probably go and –“
"Yes, no, maybe... I don't know!" John wasn't sure if he wanted to talk about the man he saw outside his house. For him, it was something personal, something for him only.
"Sherlock is in danger and we haven't saved him from a Serbian chamber of torture to have him killed in a church in Chiswick!" His eyes were hard but Greg was able to read the fear in them. His voice breaks."I won't let that happen, you understand, not because I didn't consider making a thorough check on his
"He was with me a few minutes ago and now..." his hand instinctively went to his pocket, only to finds out that his phone was missing! With a silent apology to his mother, he swears against his brother once more.
"You are here for real, you are not going anywhere..." The doctor was now holding Sherlock tightly in his arms, not wanting to let him go. "Say that you are staying with me."
“I just want to know how things are going, brother mine, just that.” He motions to the space beside him, “please join me, would you?”
“Sorry to say that he didn’t tell me his name,” the detective turns toward his left than right hand frowning at the handcuffs that still restrained his hands and feet. “Is this really necessary?”
Unable to shake his belief that the man is hiding something, he grabs his bag and runs to his first class.
"I don't want to lose you." He didn't say 'obviously' but it was clear in his tone. " And, isn't that what people do?" The tall man asks, a bit lost.
I play violin when ever I want. Even at 3 in the morning SH
“Or your own mother won’t be able to recognize you! Anyway, how could she be proud of having a lanky twink like you for a  son!”
"You cause me pain because I love you so much! The pain of not being able to get what I want because you didn't feel or do things like that, then suffering from losing any chance to ever get it because you died in front of me! Letting go of the hope for a miracle and settling for second best only to realize that you were still alive! That! That's what pain is!" With a slight pressure, he forces Sherlock around.
"No, never seen him before..." Unable to lie to himself, he mutters, "but he was so fucking beautiful! Never seen a man so.... so... not just sexy or fit, but..." John was clearly looking for the right words without being able to find them. "At the pier, he was focussed but lost in his thoughts at the same time. Moving with a goal, a determination that I haven't felt myself since Afghanistan." Rising from the table, he walks to a window in the front of the house, looking at the road. Not realizing that he has left his walking stick behind. "And then, not even two hours later, he was standing there, in the middle of the road. I don't know why... he was looking at me, transfixed. Magnificent."
Thinking about his still fragile brother, who was starting to talk about going back to Baker Street but Mycroft was against the idea, the younger man protests, "I know that he's doing better, that the therapist has helped a lot with his nightmares, but he's not ready!"
He chuckles derisively "And that means a lot when you think of the fact that people have in fact
December 10: Happy? / Look Ella. I'm writing my blog.
“You are an authority figure –”
For good.
Mycroft's tranquil assurance was the only thing that helped him retains a bit of calm. "and after, when Sherlock going to be safe, it's going to be the correct moment for our real Honeymoon."
Do you have a visual, can you confirm his identity? WG
Keeping his back toward John, he murmurs, defeated. "If it wasn't for me, you would probably have a wife and kids by now! I destroyed everything, I cause you pain... Don't you see it?"
“Boss, something going on at the pub, the Fre –“ the simultaneous glares of Holmes and Lestrade bring her words to a sudden halt before she takes a breath and manages to recover enough to stops, “Sherlock is in the middle of a fight!”
Not wanting to leave, but not knowing what to do next, they both ask at the same time.
Even if he knows that he won't be sleeping that night,
?" The pathologist was, of course, aware that Sherlock wasn't dead and wasn't happy to be at John's wedding either.
"I'm talking about a therapist."
Sherlock, his hand still on Watson's mouth, drops his head to murmur in the doctor's ear, "I'm going to remove my hand, don't scream or talk. I've got the feeling that, like me, you don't want to be discovered by our... friends." Slowly, keeping eye contact with the lecturer even if they were unable to actually see each other in the dark closet, the undercover detective removes his hand.
. He sighs.
“Really sad story,” Alan continues, “he lost his grant and everything. A week later, he killed himself and --”
"It's just that it's our wedding night, but I am so stressed out about... our trip... I can't think about anything else." Hugging his husband tightly, he kisses him softly. "I love you so much Mycroft..."
"Oh... look who's talking! As if --" John regrets the words the moment they leave his mouth. "Harry... sorry!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly, to the men's surprise, the people in the other pods start shouting. "10, 9, 8..."
17:07 Bacon and cheese.
“I don’t want to know about the drugs, I want to stop it.”
Screening rapidly the operation on John’s phone, Anthea realizes that he never read Sherlock’s message! “I can’t believe it! What wrong with men?”
Shaking his head at the lost opportunity, Mike protested, “you know, every day I refuse interviews from major channels and -”
His mind was slowly drifting away when his therapist, Ella, softly calls him back to the room.
“What was it about?” Sherlock murmured into John’s neck.
About a kilometer away from the address, John had to get out of the car and walk the rest of the way, because there were no usable roads for him to get any further. He took a torch from the trunk of the car and pulled his jacket closed all the way up to his chin.
Deep blue eyes found his, the heat in them taking his breath away and John’s shoulders slumped with a satisfied exhale. “Do you have any idea what kind of fucking hot noises you just made? And how fucking gorgeous you looked? I just couldn’t help myself — had to come all over you.”
Sherlock sat up as well, cuddled close to John’s side and intertwined his right hand with John’s left…which of course had the beautiful weeding band on it’s ring finger, the one Sherlock had picked five and a half years ago.
The house was indeed in a semi good condition with a flat roof, which was unusual for how old the house was, but didn’t give John any clue as to what was going on. All windows were nailed shut and everything was more or less overgrown with plants John couldn’t even identify.
“John,” Sherlock began, speaking right into his ear and making his voice as low as possible, “I think you need to relax a bit, get out of your head.”
“It wont. I’m just going to look at it from the outside. No chance of anything happening that way, right?”
“Oh,” John said and Sherlock could make out the blush on his cheeks even in the darkened room. “Do you remember Henry Fishguard?”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John panted and he wanted to say so much more, but what they just did couldn't be put into words.
“Y-yes, Captain,” he replied strained and just to make his point extra clear, John pushed back in with only one finger, making Sherlock growl in frustration, but John really wanted to get his cock into that arse someday soon, so after a few teasing seconds, his middle finger joined the first and a third not two minutes after that.
What happened eight days ago, if it was in fact a Thursday (he would have to check), changed their relationship from flatmates to…well, he supposed boyfriends would be an appropriate term and waited long and hard for the annoyance over something so pedestrian to set in, but was rather annoyed at himself for not being able to stop grinning about it.
Sherlock was still gaping at John, but eventually made his mouth work again. “John? I…”
“Submission,” Sherlock whispered and it was so quiet that John almost missed it.
Sliding off Sherlock and standing on visibly shaking legs, John pulled Sherlock towards their bedroom, leaving him just enough time to reach for the monitor to take with them.
The same kind of chill from earlier ran through John’s body, but he ignored it and asked, “What do you mean?”
I’m going to pull them off, understood?”
“How so?” John tried to ask in his best nonchalant tone and trying to keep his face playfully neutral.
They had done this endless times over the months, so John knew exactly how fast he could go with this and pushed a second finger into Sherlock’s greedy hole a few seconds later.
John got up to his feet again and took in the picture Sherlock presented in front of him. Pale skin was marked with welts and handprints and the flush had travelled down to his shoulder blades, a perfect piece evidence for Sherlock’s arousal.
John fell into parades rest, making himself as authoritative as possible and put as much steel into his voice as he could. “Private Holmes,” he barked and Sherlock almost jumped out of his chair. “This behavior is intolerable. Should I remind you of your duties here?”
John stared at him for a moment and then slid his left hand into the curls at Sherlock’s nape and lightly scratched his scalp, making Sherlock lean into the touch and give a whole body shiver. “I love you too, Sherlock.”
John put the crop down beside the lube and knelt behind Sherlock on one leg. He placed his right hand on the small of his back, rubbing in circles to calm Sherlock down a little.
It felt like hours of ecstasy mixed with an agonizing urge to let go and come for hours and hours.
It didn’t take long until Sherlock was bouncing up and down John’s cock, but the way they sat, John had absolutely no leverage and the urge to thrust made him more and more frustrated by the second.
,” John commanded when he had to come up for air and Sherlock could only nod dumbly and shuffled slowly into the bedroom, trying his hardest to keep his legs from giving out underneath him.
the cover read and John was grateful for the bee covering most of the book, so he actually knew what it meant.
Not betting an eye about what Sherlock could possibly be up to, John started explaining as he wrestled Rosie out of her boots and jacket. “She apparently had an argument with Gwen today, who wanted her toy, which Rosie tried to explain was not her’s to take as long as she wanted to play with it, but Gwen didn’t understand — or refused to. The argument wasn’t over when I was picking her up and now she’s upset that she couldn’t win and on top of that had to let go of the toy.”
Poor John, he lost a friend (more details on that friendship later) to that damn drugs!
His lanky arms wrapped around his knees solidly, as if he was tying himself down, unable to trust his own body, his own mind.
"And whose fault it is? I was late because of you!" Greg chuckles in his ear, thinking back to the lovely time they had, finally without the worry that had surrounded them since they had returned from their honeymoon/rescue mission.
His head falling on Sherlock’s chest, John started to play with his shirt buttons, opening then one by one as he murmured, “I would have let you, you know...”
“Hello?”
When he returned, less than two minutes later, the room was empty. Running to his brother's rooms, he found them empty as well,
He was unable to stay away, the only things he has accomplished in the last days was to think about him, then reprimand himself because he was thinking about him! The discussion with his boss, the tone of William’s brother when he asked him to leave his brother alone.
A small smile on his lips, Mycroft points the tele, “I think he does not need help anymore, don’t you think?”
“Have you received something in the mail from South America?” She interrupted nervously.
Not reading the whole letter or courageous enough to click on the picture, he skips to the next email.
The next story in this series is Sleepless at Seatle, I have also You've Got Mail on the back burner... Let me know if you have any favourite rom-com!
"I'm going to send Simpson to wait for you outside as soon as we are back home..." Mycroft says, holding his brother tight.
December 24
“Starving! Back to Angelo’s?”
"Yes, Sir." The young woman smiles with affection. "I will, right now." She was leaving when she places a few envelopes on the table. "Oh, I forgot! Your personal mail! Simpson gave it to me."
Checking his phone, he read a few articles regarding the relationship between vampires and blood, without finding anything helpful. Looking at his browser history, he chuckled on how single-minded his searches had become over the last few days!
It had become a habit and Sherlock never said anything about it and this time John made extra sure, but Sherlock was fine. Well, he would be sore for days probably, but that wouldn't be the first time Sherlock spent a few days standing, lying or sometimes even kneeling.
When his pants were taken from him and John was standing behind him, out of sight, the anticipation that build within him while John just stood and let him wait made the hairs on his back stand up, let goosebumps break out on his arms and his heart was pounding against his chest.
John bent down and sealed there lips together in a slow and tender kiss and it gave them both the understanding that this wasn’t purely about giving and taking control or the sexual expect of it.
John felt heat rising in his cheeks. “Uh, yes. That was amazing. I mean everything, saving me and now just..that!. Why?”
“John?” Sherlock asked after a while.
“Sherlock,” John said, getting them out and showing them to Sherlock, which turned out to be a very bad idea, because in that one unguarded moment, Winston managed to grab a hold of Sherlock and fling him against the nearest wall as if he were a doll.
“John, what…” Sherlock whispered, voice raw with emotion.
Sherlock went tense, realising what he had done wrong. “Oh god. Sir. Please, Sir. May I come, Sir?”
Now it was John’s turn to clear his throat in obvious embarrassment. “It was a case and you had a dummy hanged in the living room? I found him in the cellar and practiced on him while you were at Bart’s and I didn’t have to work. But I used packing twine, not the ropes.”
Sherlock swallowed. “What you will find on my back will not have an impact on what we are doing. I’ve been able to delete most of it and what I couldn’t will never have any correlation with this. I’m amenable to talk at a later time, but not now.”
The second bar was actually more like a club, dark and loud music with a heavy bass playing so loud, you had to speak directly into the other’s ear to be heard.
“Hi, I’m Dr. John Watson,” John said. “I was one of the doctors who saw him first in the ER. Are you a friend?”
“Yes, Captain,” Sherlock got out, almost stumbling over the words.
“Hell no, you’re not getting rid of me without some answers. Ghost are not real, so what are you talking about?”
“I-I…”
He put everything on as quietly as possible, glad that they still fit, the last time he had them on was now a few years back, but he couldn’t say it felt particularly good.
But it wasn’t born out of anger either, nor frustration.
It was far from being nighttime, but John winced slightly at the volume at which Sherlock was talking nonetheless. “Sherlock, I know this case is difficult, but you need to calm down, we will figure thi—“
John’s position let him notice the exact point when Sherlock came close. His thighs would tense and his panting got faster and faster and right when he started to beg to come, John would let go of his cock and continue stoking just his own.
It would have been so easy to let the anger take him, but Sherlock told him everything he needed to know for now and John would never in his life let the rage he was feeling right now, influence what they were doing.
John shook his head. “I’m sorry, sorry. I don’t know what happened.”
Even breathing was causing him more pain, but when John let go, he couldn’t tell if he was relieved or wanted more already.
“Good boy,” John praised. “You took that so well for me, Sherlock. All done now.”
They cooled down eventually, staying close in each other’s arms, not saying a word because there was nothing that needed to be said and when Rosie’s 34 minutes were up eventually, John lazily crawled out of bed, taking sweatpants and cozy jumper with him and vanished into the bathroom.
He was slamming into Sherlock so hard that he was sliding up the table a bit with every brutal thrust before Sherlock thankfully put his legs around John’s waist.
able to keep your eyes on mine the whole time, they’re going back on and
“Calm down. There’s so much in my head, to much noise, I can’t concentrate, I can’t even go to my mind palace. There’s. Just. Too. Much,” Sherlock grit out, hands going back to his scalp.
Up until now, he didn’t even consider the possibility that this could very well be some kind of drug den and he was about to be confronted with some very unkind people. But all that did was let the familiar calm wash over him and in the end, it probably was only the draught anyway.
For some reason, a chill was creeping down John’s spine, but he ignored it and started the ultrasound to check his organs.
They both had a hard time even getting to actually searching, because once chased away by either iron or salt, it didn’t take long for Winston to come back and attack them again.
Sherlock’s dramatically whined “Joohhhhn” pulled him from the little daydream he had slipped into and the reality of how Sherlock had been the last few dews came to mind again.
“No.”
“So who was he before he died?” John asked and followed Sherlock to the table where he was arranging the articles he’d picked up.
Not so much because they invoked bad memories, he had managed to overcome a lot of them over time with the help of Ella and most importantly Sherlock, but in the prospect of what he was about to do with them…
Sherlock scoffed.
The pain was intense and it took Sherlock a considerable amount of effort to breathe trough the initial pain, hands balling into fists behind his back.
“More than that,” John replied and gave Sherlock a peck to his jawline before closing the bathroom door behind them.
“Salt?”
John plucked a tissue from the bedside table and handed it to Jason.
Sherlock gave him a small smile and said, “I was thinking about getting you out of your head, just as you helped me that first night.”
With the precision of a surgeon's hands and the calmness only John could radiate, he released Sherlock of his bonds, beginning by returning Sherlock’s arms to his sides and massaging his upper arms, then untying his thighs from his chest before he gathered Sherlock in his arms, kneeling in front of him, and removing the rope from Sherlock’s chest.
“Hmm, how could I say no to that pretty voice begging me.”
Sherlock Holmes is going to be the death of him.
“No, Sherlock,” John scolded. “I told you disobeying the rules leads to punishment. Four strikes with my hand, two for each time you didn’t address me. Will you except your punishment?”
Sherlock looked him up and down a couple of times. “That was terrible, John. Start over.”
The air was so electrified and John so turned on all of a sudden that he absolutely had to grab the back of Sherlock’s neck and pull him half across the table to crush their lips together.
He then took the last of the three ropes and did the same to Sherlock’s left leg.
“That’s my girl,” Sherlock said, not able to stop the grin spreading from ear to ear. “Sit with her in your lap in front of me, I have a plan.”
“You’re right, I’m not. Turn around,” he said, wanting for Sherlock to see how John felt about this, they were both often better with just communicating by looking at each other than with actual words.
“Thank you, Sherlock. I…needed this,” John said, but averted his eyes again.
With his eyes closed again, he felt John moving around him. “Put your hands behind your head,” John ordered and began running the rope around Sherlock’s chest, first over, then underneath and once more over his pectorals.
Half an hours later, showered and dressed in his civilian clothes, he was sitting in his car on the way to the address. It really was a terrible idea, if he were honest, because of course he was going alone, there was no-one he could ask, maybe Mike, but he once told John that he hated horror movies, Sarah…well no and what would he say anyway? That he wanted to look at an abandoned house in the middle of the night because he had a bad feeling?
With every finger John added, Sherlock grew louder and louder, moaning and grunting, not caring if anyone could hear them, but given the time of day, no-one would be at these labs and if John were honest, he was so turned on and ready to fuck Sherlock, he didn’t care if anyone heard, or even saw them.
John began to slowly circle around Sherlock, while he couldn’t do anything than stay rooted right where he was, pinned down by the electricity in the air and John’s heated gaze. “You want to know what I’ve been thinking about? The things I couldn’t get out of my head? The things I want to do to you that were so vivid in my imaginations that I actually bought a few things, so if I ever got the chance to play with you again, I could use them?”
“No,” was all John said and continued fucking Sherlock.
He cleared his throat, almost feeling too sheepish to ask this. “How did you learn to do that with the ropes.”
John rolled his eyes and drained his beer. “Okay you prick. I get it. Here again, or do you want to go somewhere else?”
“On ghost-hunting?”
“Hmm, see, even your subconscious thinks I’m amazing.”
So Sherlock had closed his laptop, put his phone on silence and taken John’s jacket off him, had untied his shoes and wordlessly guided him to their bedroom where he had pulled the rest of John’s clothes off and laid him on the bed.
They broke apart and John took the end of the rope on Sherlock’s left side and pulled it through the line of rope over his sternum and did the same with the other.
John bottomed out and the breath Sherlock was holding rushed out of him in a long and loud moan that was outright obscene.
He made his way down a staircase and to Sherlock, politely asking, “May I have a seat here?”
When John didn’t say anything, the stranger went on, “You are such an idiot for coming here, alone on top of that. You could have been easily killed. You have no idea what you are up against, you can be glad that I happened to come here earlier than planned. Why are you
It was the beginning of February, again, fascinating how fast time seemed to run when there’s a toddler living in your home, a curious, ever learning ball of energy.
be true, my boy,” John said and Sherlock preened inwardly at John calling him
“You need a shower,” Sherlock stated, blatantly trying to change the topic.
He was here for John’s pleasure, to be used and marked and handled at John’s will.
Sherlock stopped pacing then, facing away from John. So there was something, John thought, but he waited patiently for Sherlock to decide what to do next.
The fingers were gone, leaving Sherlock empty and surprised at how wrong it felt to not have something filling him.
“I love you, John,” Sherlock said and it wasn’t blurted out, it was the absolute truth and everything he wanted and could say in that moment.
Sherlock was on edge already and he would have begged to come, if not for the clamps to have the fortunate bonus of distracting him from his achingly hard cock too.
Rosie came toddling back, a manilla envelope in her hands that looked almost comically large in front of her tiny body and handed it to Sherlock with outstretched arms.
While Sherlock was on the watch, John dug though old wooden boxes, most of them filled with stuff he had no idea what they actually were, until in one of those boxes under some rotten and foul smelling cloth, John found a pair of old boxing gloves.
He was hot and sweaty, could feel Sherlock’s warm breath faintly ghosting against his neck and was about to throw their little game straight out of the window and snog Sherlock absolutely senseless and possibly take him into the men’s, sink down to his knees and take Sherlock into his mouth while he jerked himself off.
“Please, Sherlock. I just want to help.”
He brought their lips together, the kiss slow and soft and Sherlock reveled in the affection and care John took over him.
“The one who saved your life, now go and use it for something useful other than wasting my time.”
Now John was completely off the rails to understand any of this. “What?”
“Thank you for asking,” John said and gave Sherlock a peck on the lips,”but I don’t actually know what has me so…whatever it is. It was just a shit day, parents with kids that just have a cold, vaccine-activists that seem to just come for the sake of telling doctors why they think vaccines are bad and then just an awful amount of people who think they know exactly what issues they have, me then telling them that they’re wrong to which they just outright ignore me and go on and on, because well, what they read on the internet must be true right.”
After a few seconds thinking, Sherlock answered, “Anthophila, Sir.”
He couldn’t help it, he was half hard from the moment he entered 221b, but seeing Sherlock like this made his blood rush south in now time and it was getting uncomfortable, even just standing in one spot.
“I’ll look forward to see you try, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock purred while leaning over the table.
First the hatch fell shut and wouldn’t open again, which Sherlock explained was the doing of Mr. Winston and then the man himself appeared, looking even more angry than before.
“May I come?”
His arms were flung out, his fingers trying to find purchase on the rug under them and then he came violently, untouched for the very first time.
Very well, he wanted to do this for a long time now and with a good reason it was even better.
And suddenly, John understood and his chest ached for Sherlock and what he had to go through, which John had only the briefest of knowledge about, they never talked about it and John knew he couldn’t press for something that Sherlock didn’t want to share, it would just be selfish.
He never thought doing this would be so much fun, but he was constantly thinking about how he could get Sherlock to finally go with him, it was a thrill, a challenge he didn’t have for months, never wanted to again, because Sherlock was everything he could want and more and in the time they were together, the heat and want was still the same as on day one, something he had never experienced before and not for the first time John thought about how much he could have already had of the love Sherlock had to offer if he just hadn’t been to bloody afraid and stupid.
he smiles, "can be fulfilled by staying with me? And the not being married to me is something that you can do for the rest of your life?"
"Marriage and I were very clearly not meant for one another."
"Sherlock?" He laughs merrily at the idea. "I don't think - it's not really his thing to be interested in that kind of --!"
"You are a darling, but we both know it's not true." John laughs, thinking of his leg, his shoulder, his nightmares, his locum work...
"Oh!" Sherlock's eyes sparkled a second before becoming clouded again. "Thank Lestrade for me when you go back to the kitchen, would you?"
Expecting the worst, he clicks on the message window.
"No, but I've stayed away from the news since I've been back..."
An hour later, after he has to repeat everything a second time because Greg arrives in the middle of his story, Sherlock was emotionally drained.
"Yes!" Harry quickly opens her email account, "look at that one... I think it's perfect!"
"Nothing, happened," the doctor grumbles. "It's just strange, that's all."
John was quickly losing it, thrashing from one side and another, when a hand finally engulfs his cock. “Oh Gooood, yes!” But it wasn’t long before he realizes the hand wasn’t moving. Not moving at all! Understanding that the detective wants to go slow, he sighs, pressing a kiss into the mass of chocolate curl. “Brilliant man... You’re right... Go slow... Do as you wish... I want to come with you inside... I want us to become one...”  Sherlock caressed him lightly one last time before turning the shorter man on his stomach. “Oh Sherlock... more... yes... God... yes...” Pushing him slightly on the bed to restrain him to hump on the mattress, his friend's precious lips start kissing, biting and licking a path toward John’s perfectly round buttock.
“What it is then?” Sherlock asked, wishing once more for the guidance of his old companion.
"Tonight. At midnight."
“The war, I’ve seen horrors... I shouldn’t be that affected by that. This is ridiculous. I don’t even know the
The day was going slowly, it was driving John crazy! Beside the presentation to a dozen staff members, a crash course on the informatic system they used, a coffee with the administrator of the surgery… he found the time to miss Sherlock.
The government man, realizing in what state his brother was, had quickly administrated a light and safe sedative.
A few hundred kilometres away, Clara was now looking severely at Harry, shaking her head. "What have you done, Harry?"
but his text pops back with an error message.
“I told him that if he talked to the cops, I was going to flunk him. I knew that if he failed he was going to lose his grant and his reputation.” Appleton looks away, suddenly ashamed, “never thought that we was going to kill himself! I didn’t kill him!”
Curious, even if she was a bit angry that Harry was laughing at her romantic view of love at first sight, she drops back next to her on the sofa. "Have you received something interesting?"
Stifling a groan, he sits in a place where he was able to see everything. Everything except the altar. The altar where John was waiting for her. For
"Yes, maybe. But John won't be here to save you this time." She gloats as Sherlock realizes that she knew that John shot the cabby.
"That, one way or in other, you'd find a way to go back to John Watson." Her laughter echoes in the deserted church shaking John to the core, "You already died once to keep him safe. Now you must die to preserve his reputation and his liberty. Think about it, you can be a hero and die tragically, romantically, even in this church or the fact that John killed that cabby after only knowing you for one day is going public."
December 24
Until he broke down crying in a dark alley wrapped in his long coat.
"Is it weird, that I kept thinking about you? I've seen you two times and..."
Chuckling, the detective shakes his head. "You know that it's more difficult than you think, forcing someone to commit suicide."
"Thanks, darling..." Silently, the woman peruses Sherlock description before asking. "No picture? And is this a man or a woman? It's kind of unsettling don't you think?"
“I am... I am afraid that you are going to leave because I have done horrible things; I am afraid that one day I am going to attack you... I nearly did in the cemetery...” Tears were pearling from his beautiful eyes. “I am afraid that criminals like Moriarty are going to hurt you to hurt me. that I am going to love you so, so much but one day you are going to die and -”
Taking out his phone, he anxiously texts the doctor, hoping for the best.
“Everything is fine, I simply forgot that I had an appointment, that’s all.” The first year Med student is nice and thankfully not an idiot, and Sherlock is feeling a bit sad at the idea of lying to him once again.
"Yes, it was strange, it was as if you had seen a ghost!" She laughs, fussing with his clothes before kissing him and rushing inside. "Be quick, it's freezing! And we need to talk about that Sara!"
You know. forget it. You clearly don't want a flatmate.
"Sorry to say, I think this is a set-up, Doctor Watson." The voice, echoing in the closed space, was velvety and warm. Slowly, John turns in the direction of the end of the cabin. And he saw him.
His friend's reaction when he found him at the pool even gave him a bit of hope that Sherlock wanted something more.
Opening his eyes slowly, Sherlock murmurs softly as if he wasn’t already awake. “Mycroft, is it you?” As his older brother raises an eyebrow, he chuckles. “Worth a try, sorry!” Mycroft pours a glass of water from a carafe and hands it to his younger brother with a plastic straw in it. “Thank you, do you have news about the man that was there? The third? Do you have his name or anything?”
“Just asking, what about you, John? Any prospect for a Ms or Mr Watson?” Murray repeated, with a friendly but concerned look. The thought of his friend being all alone when he deserved so much love was worrying and saddening him.
Sherlock, already on the edge because of the sleepless night he had, viewing and reviewing all the surveillance camera of the building without being able to get a good view of the two men who left the lab yesterday, isn’t cheered by the idea of getting a full 3 hours with Holt. The fact that he watched for the criminals for approximately one hour (he quickly realizes that it wasn’t able to get a good image) and the rest of the night going over the few minutes of footage where Doctor Watson was didn’t helped.
"I don't like loose ends," the hint of pride for a job well done was lacing her voice. "I admit I was starting to think that the rumours about you being alive were only that, rumours, but I had to be sure."
Waving his man away, the sleek criminal prowls on the other seat to sit near the detective and murmurs, “so sorry my pet, won’t be able to talk to you now, I’ve got to go to work... Five minutes it's not enough...”, as his prisoner tries to talk, he carefully places a finger on his mouth, “shhhhh, don’t worry, it’s only a sedative. Don’t want to destroy your great mind! I’m surrounded by idiots, I won’t risk it!” Holmes, now unable to move or talk, is quickly sinking further away into oblivion as two men drag him inside the building.

Nice, it's going to give me a break from the gititude.
Rising from the chair slowly, he looks away from the young woman not wanting to see the look of sympathy in her eyes. “I’m okay, I don’t need medical attention after all. You know where to find me officer, if you have any questions.”
They remained silent for the rest of the road, each lost in their own thoughts.
John was finally alone.
"What happened? Why did he stay on the church's floor like that? Is he okay? I am not planning to forgive him but I don't wish for him to be hurt. I didn't punch him that hard. Really. And anyway why did he didn't contact me? 7 weeks Greg!"
Finally, John is back to being a soldier! I'm sure that, in another circumstance, Sherlock is going to love his captain voice ;-)
“Sherlock... Now... Please...” The detective remains silent but starts showering him with little kisses, licking and gently biting his nipples. Unable to control himself but wondering how is it possible to already be naked, John jerks into his friend firm torso, rubbing his length on the thin but firm frame of Sherlock. A naked Sherlock. An
"It's okay, a wedding is a nice place to have children around..."
Without quitting his microscope, the detective simply hums, his eyes still focused on the slide.
In fact, the sole presence of the ex-military man is quite distracting and Sherlock, without admitting to himself, would be better off if he left the lab! The fact that the man clearly desires him is strangely arousing to the usually uninterested man. Without thinking, he suggests, “really, you can go. Anyway, you need to take care of your arousal and –”
“I suggested that you stay away from my brother and, on the first day he’s back in your class, you have a... date?” Mycroft was seriously unsettled by the fact that his brother was openly interested in someone
Opening his eyes slightly he moans silently as he realizes that he is blindfolded. Surveying his body for pain, he is relieved to feel that, except for the straining of the handcuffs behind his back and a rope of some sort around his ankles, he is uninjured.
After a hesitation, considering all of the pitfalls of starting something that will only last one night, he gives in to his curiosity, and offers John a pseudonym to make it more safe, “Scott, William Scott.”
He is still doing a mental list of pros and cons when his sister steps outside the bedroom and starts making coffee.
Able to talk in the warmth and affection of the old lady, he murmured, ashamed, “I nearly attacked John, my precious, beautiful, gentle John.”
Knowing that it was futile to resist,
First muttering something about “the boss’ bloody little pet project,” the man finally replies that it wasn’t his business before walking impatiently in John’s direction. “Wakey-wakey doctor,” he tears the blindfold away in one harsh move “Time to talk!”
John is reading some articles about the presence of B/O in Glasgow,
Contrary to the feelings he felt last week, when he last uttered the two tiny words,  John didn't feel a hint of a doubt when he replied, "I do."
Being confronted by that woman about his sexuality and his attraction to Sherlock was horrible, especially when he realized that his exasperated scream
Impressed by the strength of his brother's mind, able to resist to what looks like weeks of torture, Mycroft was praying for a swift and calm flight. Positioning himself near his brother's ear, the stench of his infected wounds nearly insupportable, he murmurs g ently,"you only needs to be courageous a few more hours, brother mine, you are going to be home soon."
A smallish one... sorry!
"So, everything is right. Mary, do you take..."
John looks away in the direction of the DI and Sherlock. He is about to smile at the large gestures and the vivacity of the explanations the young man is giving.
And at your left now, on the lamppost.
"Yes, sorry... it wasn't a really polite thing to do." He was dancing from feet to feet, distracted by the squishing of his delicate Italian shoes.
He was slowly phasing out when he heard his name. “What?”
, you're too cute."
The message was deleted in less than one second!
In the morning... (Day 1!)
Awwwww SweetiePies both of them.
Mike, who was looking at the scene flabbergasted, places a comforting hand on John's shoulder and murmurs "Please come with me, John, you are too emotional right now... Later you --"
"Johnnnnn"
Rolling his eyes at the inconvenient timing, Sherlock replies impatiently "It's better be impo -"  His beautiful face becomes radiant as an exhausted Lestrade explains why he called. "Where? Okay, we are going to be there in 15 minutes." Not explaining anything to John, he grabs his hand again and starts running in thedirection of Belvedere Road to get a cab; his imposing stature creating a path through the crowd, when the voice of the doctor stops him.
Next chapter: John!
Flicking his hand, he pushes the thought away.
A bit shaken, the detective is only able to utter “What?”
A few streets away from the grounds, his mind is still fighting away unwanted reminiscences of his Oxford years.
An evening in 221b…
(See the end of the chapter for
A good talk… AKA: The conclusion to this little story, that finally got really little to do with the movie. Except for the fact that Kate and Matthew are both also adorable.
John is helping Sherlock to stand up and they are about to walk out of the pub when the police finally arrive.
, face. "You have questions?"
“I’m certainly not that late, am I?” John smiles, spotting the candles on the table, “and we can’t let those candles go to waste for noting, can we?”  Sherlock, sitting back slowly into his chair, looks at John with an edge of mania in his eyes. “Everything all right? You look… agitated.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The pub, right outside the castle gate, was warmly lit and cosy. A few locals, as well as a dozen of the wedding guests, were already relaxing and drinking in the main room. Quickly finding his place with a little gang near a pool table, John finally relaxes for the first time since he spotted Fiona.
What should I say to him or her?
“Okay, the day is over!” Lestrade said, massaging his neck. “We have everything that we need to close the case.”
Running away can bring you where you should be...
“Mycroft... thanks. It’s not
Clara was up getting coffee when she hears John talking about the beautiful stranger. Laughing, she interrupts the story. "I knew that something happened at the terminal!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've been honest I think... Don't underestimate his appeal! And without a picture... can you imagine if I had put up pictures! But he'll never know about those messages, the account was opened with a new Gmail address that I've created." She quickly motions in direction of the screen, "Go on! Read!"
Winking a bit more effectively, the other man shook his head, “you need to go out to find someone, you are not going to just fall in the arms of a perfect partner!” Turning around, he spotted an attractive thirty-something, “go talk to her, she looks nice!”
Greg and Molly, as well as Stamford, were able to read the hesitation on John's face.
Morgane
"No, come here..." John pats the bed with hooded eyes.
Sherlock tests John a few more times...
"You are still successful with the ladies... and the lads!" Murray laughed loudly, getting the attention of the people around them.
The argument is heated! He recognizes the voice of McAllister but the second one is unknown to him.
Before he faints on the hot sand among the fellow soldiers he just saved.
Smiling at the question that was showing a curious mind, the doctor asks, “do you have an example?”
"Ouf... I thought they'll never leave." Mycroft falls on the bed with his clothes on, not wanting to move for at least twenty-four hours. They were finally back home, not wanting to spend the night at the hotel as they were leaving early in the morning. Shaking himself, he rises from the bed and starts to remove his suit.
I am as happy as I am capable of being right now. Stop fussing, for God sakes!
"No! My client gave me tickets for the London Eye! It's going to be grand!"
Sherlock said: “Hey, what’s happening? Who left a bus in the middle of the road?” Then, “What a shit place, nothing work!” And, after he saw John and Mary, “Am I interrupting something?”
December 25th: Nothing / I wrote poetic bullshit last night. And I wasn't even drunk. Which I am a bit right now. You see Ella, I'm doing something with my life, I'm drinking!
“This won’t do, Moran, he’s mine,” Moriarty muttered, glaring at the gloriously happy couple on a monitor. “He's going to be mine or he’s going to die.”
He smiles, thinking about his vision of the ideal home. Something warm, clean but crowded. Not in a big complex, like Harry's place, but something more home-y. The continual buzzing of the city around him was similar to the breaking waves. A presence, a background noise, the feeling of being surrounded by something bigger. He knew that hiding himself away as he was right now wasn't a viable solution for the long term, but the idea of being in London to end up in a bedsit was worse!
“Oh, young man are all the same, always running. Always. One day you are going to be old like me.” She sighed. “And die, all alone.”
"It's a blog, from a doctor... I was thinking about asking him about a peculiar gunshot wound as --" Molly stutters as she improvises.
Sarah’s expression softened. “Good, doctors and nurses have access to seminars once a year to learn how to tend to sick or wounded vampires. If you want, I can sign you up for the next session.”
My schedule is off the chart. I go out or get in at the strangest hours. SH
“Just to tell you thank you for your intervention.” Extending his hand for a handshake, the appreciation real, Mycroft smiles and continues after a small pause, “my brother is a difficult... young man, it’s good to know that he’s isn’t hated by all his
Laughing heartily while looking at his phone, Greg thought about Mycroft eating popcorn in his beautiful suit.
"What do you want to say?"
Useless? I don't understand, are you looking for a flatmate or not?
“It’s not a murder!” The detective t-shirt flies in a corner. “Moriarty! Bank of England,” He was panting a bit, trying to remove is pajama bottom while putting a shirt. “Pentonville and... the Crown Jewels!”
"You're lucky, you know, you are perfect together..." After a sad sigh, he murmurs, "I don't think it's going to happen to me you know."
"I don't trust them, of course, and Anthea is with her family, for the holiday."
He wasn't a doctor but, at first sight, the damage was extensive. Surveying the tortured body of his younger brother he was unable to stifle a shiver. One broken arm, broken ribs, eyes rimmed with filth - probably an infection of some sort - and his feet, bloody and raw from many small razor thin cuts, his way too thin body covered in bruises and small wounds. And his back...
Sherlock cuddled close while he let John come down from his high, muscles relaxing and short panting returning to deep, even breaths.
He counted down the seconds in his mind, could see that John’s peak was inevitable, far beyond his control no matter how much he wanted to follow Sherlock’s orders.
Sherlock’s words made John dizzy with arousal, he so rarely talked like that, only if he was really desperate and John was in a much similar state.
He placed the lube on the bedside table for later use and grasped the crop firmly with his left hand, getting a feel for how it lay in his hand and the range of it. The leather was buttery soft and noticeably cared for, although he never once saw Sherlock holding it over the years.
Several minutes, or hours, passed and both drifted in and out of sleep, John wrapped around Sherlock’s body, but keeping a tiny distance between their chests to protect Sherlock’s nipples from further onslaught.
John shrugged, he had done unethical things in his life that were worse and who was here to mind it, Sherlock would certainly not, that was for sure.
“Fuck yes, Holmes. Keep going,” John grit out and started to push his hips forward a few inches, hitting the back of Sherlock’s throat more often.
When he was finished, he leaned up against the headboard and pulled Sherlock into his arms, peppering him with kisses to the top of his head and stroking lightly over every part of skin that he could reach.
John had stopped wondering what those ‘plans’ of Sherlock entailed long ago, now just doing as he was asked, giving Sherlock a welcome kiss and letter him hug Rosie before mirroring Sherlock and pulling Rosie over to sit on his crossed legs.
Sherlock brought their lips together and was pleased when John opened his mouth for him right away and poured everything into it that he couldn’t say with words.
By now, Sherlock’s brain had enough capability left to keep Sherlock breathing and form something that resembled speech and the former was definitely taking priority.
They kept kissing and kissing while John tried to open Sherlock’s belt, thumbed at the button and sliding the zipper down.
Sherlock was unsure what do to, he wanted to close the space between them and get John into a tight hug and then kiss him and try to make him feel better, but maybe John needed some space and the right thing to do was to go back into the living room and be quiet.
“You don’t understand, John. I can’t, not anymore.”
Love, affection, awe, guilt, anger.
“Anthophila, Sir.”
“Alternative first meetings,” was all Sherlock said and left John in the dark about what was going on in that big head of his once again.
When the seconds one was removed with the same feelings added on top of his already freed nipple, a single tear made it’s way down his right cheek.
Sherlock wasn’t hard, which was nothing John concerned himself with yet, but he still took his fill on that beautiful, uncircumcised cock, nestled in a trimmed nest of hair that was several shades lighter than the mop of hair on Sherlock’s head, which John so loved.
“I wasn’t talking about them,” John said. He didn’t know who them were, but he had an idea and it just made him bristle inwardly, so he pushed the thoughts to the back of his head.
John decided right there that this was definitely happening again, because Sherlock dropping to his knees with a throaty moan the second John had spoken the words was too good to only see once.
“Yeah, I’m…oh my god. I just had the craziest, most vivid dream of my entire life.”
A few hours and numerous emergencies later, John got the confirmation that he pulled through. They’d have to see if he suffered any long term brain damage, but the brain compression was relieved quickly and he showed good responses after waking up.
“Uhm. It’s slipping away fast. We didn’t know each other and you were a hunter, er, hunting ghosts and I think other supernatural beings and we met in an abandoned house…and I think you saved my life and…yeah, that’s about it.”
Teary eyes opened and locked onto his and the emotions behind them made Sherlock gasp.
He wanted to get Sherlock nice and ready, scissoring his fingers and sinking them knuckle deep into the wet, hot heat of his body and couldn’t wait to feel that on his painfully aching erection.
“Never mind,” John said, waving the whole topic away with his hand. “So you do this as a hobby?”
John had no idea how much time went by and Sherlock was so still and relaxed, he wondered if he might have fallen asleep, but then Sherlock turned his head and looked at him.
They had to break apart eventually, both panting heavily, and John was already beyond coherent speech, so he just said, “Lube” and held his hand out for Sherlock to coat his fingers.
It all started more or less with a case three days ago.
John took the second coil of rope and unrolled it. “Lift up on your knees. You can take your arms down. Put them on my shoulders if you want to,” John instructed and circled the rope around Sherlock’s right thigh several times, ending it in a knot and letting the end lay on the mattress.
And then it went pretty much to hell.
“Everyone of importance knows that you are a great” he stops as Sebastian raises an eyebrow, “... the best sniper, Moran.” Sherlock argues while shaking his head as the criminal offers him a cigarette, “you’ve been quite discreet over the last two years, did someone get you on a leash?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you sure about that, My'?" Greg was keeping his husband close to his chest. "It's dangerous..." He was confident in all the preparations they had made over the last weeks, but nonetheless, it was a risky mission.
They drank their tea quietly until Sarah sighed while looking at the clock. “Better to go back, or the secretary is going to file a missing person report! Lucy at HR is waiting for you to complete your file, do you have any questions in the meantime?”
For the first time in years, he starts praying, holding the body of the man he loved for so long. All doubt melting away as he presses on the wound.
Closing his computer, John rises to go on with his day.
“Yes, me too.” Thinking about his sister’s reaction to the news of the beautiful man’s particularity, he remained silent on the vampire business.
"Better go knock on the door, Sir, maybe he's going to need help with something. Or I can go if --
Not acknowledging John, Moran walks a bit further away, leaving the doctor alone.
The last image of his friend Paul, a few days before his death, is going to haunt him for the rest of his life.
No, not really. I won’t intervene. MH
“Sir!”, the door where the bodyguards disappeared was now open. “He’s awake, what do you want us to do?” He frowns before adding, “he’s kind of driving us crazy and I had to stop Bob from knocking him up silent. Twice.”
he grabs Harry and Clara by the arms and puts on a happy face. "Come on, beautiful ladies, your carriage awaits!"
He pushes away a quiver of disgust at the thought when the man rises slowly from his chair and walks out.
With shaking fingers, Sherlock hits reply.
The heat is unbearable, the day long and monotonous... A day like dozens of other days since he had arrived in Afghanistan. Looking at the horizon, he isn’t really paying attention to the light banter of the others, too exhausted to laugh at their silly jokes or crude comments about whatever they are talking about. The sun, disappearing behind the mountains, is beautiful and soothing. Hypnotic. Everything is perfect for a second or two.
A small small chapter I know... 3 chapters to go!
John is trying to slowly lift his head without success.
"First of all, I'm freezing, and secondly... we've got a message to write!" Still giggling, she holds onto her wife's hand and runs until they were inside the cute little coffee place.
Me too, little pest! Kiss Clara for me, wish you both a nice Christmas. See you soon.
Angry at what he considers a disrespectful tone and the sexual innuendos, the rugged man nearly loses his temper when he remembers that he had a wild card. “Already tired of you little doctor, Holmes?” Playing innocence, Sherlock cocks his head interrogatively.  “You know, we investigated the dear captain and –“
"Oh! I've been up there many times! It's quite romantic, don't you think?" The pathologist, happy that Mycroft was able to set up everything on such a short notice, couldn't stop grinning.
It was exhilarating to finally know what he wants!
"John is bi anyway. Never had anything really serious with a man, or with a woman, so everything is still open." Thinking about the missing picture, she sighs. "The lack of a picture is more troublesome, but as most of the picture are either trash or too flattering to be real, it's not a big deal. Ready to read the message?"
Standing tall, his hand on the handle of his umbrella, Mycroft waits for Doctor John H. Watson.
Sherlock didn’t have a clue of what to do next, which is a new – and unwelcome – feeling.
He massages the phantom pain in his leg, uncostumarily thinking about how foolish his younger self had been.
Panicking at the mere thought, how dare, how dare his subconscious push ideas like this in his brain, he furiously combs his fingers in his hair to push the thoughts away.
A bit calmer, John frowns and asks, "You didn't know it was me?"
“Put him in my office, on my cot,” after a second or two he adds, “but handcuff him. Both hands and feet separately... you never know with that bloody man.”
Closing his eyes, exhausted, Sherlock nods and murmurs, "I'll think about it My'... I promise."
spectacular that a sexy woman is going to stop her car! “Get in, Doctor Watson,” with a light smile she continues, “don’t worry, nothing is going to happen to you.”
The pathologist, clearly exasperated by the man's comments about her job, bluntly said. “Remove your hand, please.” Laughing, as if it was a joke, Brendon left his hand on her knee with an indulgent smile.  “I. Said. Remove. Your. Hand.”
"Yes, but I think he's not that good at that 'doing nothing' thing. Maybe later on, but now he needs something or someone or he's going to become ancient before he turns forty!" Clara objects.
A couple of hours later, and after far too many drinks, John was on his way home.  He finally opened up a bit about Sherlock to Greg (More precisely, he nearly cried in his arms. "You don't understand Greg...... I looooooooooooove him." (but neither man will ever admit having said it or heard it and they are too drunk to remember anyway.) One thing John can't forget, it's the DI's last words before he pushes him in a taxi. "Go get the man, mate!"
He was pondering what he should do next when someone knocks on the door. Pasting a polite smile on his lips, he shouts a light, "come in!"
Looking in the mirror as he arranges his hair in a casual but neat manner, his own reflection becomes surrounded by dozens of
"Because even dead you were the man of his life and dreams... Now that you are back..."
The ideas were spinning in his mind and, if he was absorbing Watson’s ‘vibe’ (and overall perfect physique and look!), he wasn’t paying attention at all to the discussion.
First day at work.
Clearing his voice, he extends his hand. "Hello, John. I'm happy for you." looking at the people who were starting to gather around murmuring, he chuckles shyly. "Short version. Not dead?"  Right before the groom rushes to punch him.
"Yes, two trucks went down the road and when they were gone, he wasn't there anymore." He tries to remember the car, anything, but wasn't able to do so!
“Yes,” Moran chuckles, “I think it is.” After a moment while he sits without even looking at his prisoner, he asks, “what did you two chat about?”
Sherlock is still trying to find a way to come back - if the thought of his John with another man is repulsive, the idea that he may one day be aware of his not so pristine past is even worse – when one of the guards rushing inside the room stops his chain of thoughts.
Sherlock’s thoughts on his new 'friend' and... a night in the jungle.
Ever.
Stuttering, Sherlock ghosts his lips over John's ear, "I think we should go back home..." Pressing his body upon his lover, the drenched clothes hiding very little, he smirks smugly at John's response that comes in the form of a deep moan. "So, it's a yes..." he chuckles, sending a pool of warmth all over John's body despite the cold rain. "But let me ask one thing." Peppering kisses all over his beloved's perfect face and blond hair, he continues, "after we are dry, after we spent a lot of time taking back the time we lost, do you think your wish to 'not being a husband'..." stopping John's exclamation with an heated
"No, no... I'm going." Getting out of the car, the detective never realized that the rain was pouring, effectively destroying the usual order of his curls or the neatness of his appearance. Walking slowly, he stops in front of the door, looking at the door knocker without being able to touch it. The image of the Baker Street knocker, that he constantly pushed crooked because John liked it that way, springs to his mind.
he raises his shoulders dismissively while he continues his walk,
A few drinks later, John and Sherlock are going back to their room.
"Gentlemen? They are closing..." Anthea was waiting, keeping the door open as both men - a bit stunned - walk out of the pod, Sherlock taking John's hand to avoid being separated in the crowd.
Holding his cup, he thinks about the previous evening. The way he opened up to Mike about his what can only be called sentiment for William, how bad he is feeling even if he can’t ignore the fact that the beautiful witty man already has his heart.
Reminiscence of a night at the museum and a chat with a friend.
We shouldn't text when we are in company. I'll talk to you soon Gregory. MH
"You love me, right?"
“October 31st, the Halloween Party of the veterans committee!” Another one shouted from the other side of the big table, “you bring your date!”
"Aie! What? I'm right! You know I'm right! Since you've been back, have you even looked at anyone? Be honest!"
“He’s waiting for you, doctor.”
"Tomorrow, Baker Street. Don't worry." Holding Greg's hand, the older Holmes walks thru the door, sending a worried look behind him until the door closed.
"Oh..." John murmurs as admiration and love start pooling from his heart to embrace his whole body at the idea of Sherlock'd courage and honesty. Kissing him reverently, he replies with a soft, "me too."
I am curious now… SH
The position was not that glorious and wasn’t worth a big happening, but he was pleased to have his friends around him. It was the best thing that happened to him since… since he cannot remember when! Being able to help, to work as a doctor – even if it was only to give shots and pills for STDs – was way better than staying in his bedsit waiting for something to happen.
"You really think it's for John?
What are you doing! This is ridiculous and you know it! MH
The evening was going nicely. They eat, talk and relax. Exchanging news about their life, funny things about patients, clients or bosses. Harry, with a bit of mirth in her eyes, asks about Sara. John sadly kills her hopes by saying that finally, it was already over.
Rushing thru the path, he nearly runs over a woman and her dog “Sorry!!!!” He laughs when she screams back calling him a nutter.
I really don't remember how many versions I wrote of that first meeting lol
“The same thing as your brother, Sir, I was relaxing at the end of a hard day.” Turning on his heel, he walks back to the car and with a nod to Anthea he instructs, “Angelo’s, Northumberland Street. Thanks.”
Dear Sleepless@Yaverland,
"Wow, I know he's not usually inclined towards romance, but he could have given you a break."
"Too bad  we weren't able to hear what they said," one secretary sighs, "it looked really romantic!"
Sitting taller, Sherlock lets his eyes survey the man in front of him. He is well dressed, hair slicked carefully with just enough product, a slight smile on his lips as if he knew that the detective is observing him… and is loving it! Extending his legs in a relaxed pause, he chuckles softly as if the situation was a daily occurrence.
“You’re a bastard, a criminal and a disgrace to the military, COLONEL.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A few hours later, he seriously doesn’t remember that much now, John tried to walk up the stairs to his floor without killing himself.
Mutual silent pining aside.
Turning his back on the commotion he walks out discreetly, not talking to anybody.
"You know how it is, Sir. People sneak into your office when you aren't there." The woman was looking as pristine as usual, but her boss's eagle eyes were able to see behind the clever make-up.
"Ex-wife..."
.. he thinks as he turns to the back of the car to get the grocery bag.  The aggressive sounds of a car horn wake him from his reverie as John, instantly in doctor mode, looks at the road in case of an accident.  John freezes, dropping his bag and letting his cane drop to the ground, as the man from the terminal was standing in the middle of the road. He was about to open his mouth to say something - anything! - when the man vanishes as if he hadn't been there at all.
want Doctor Watson to become your brother in law.”
"Why do you want me dead? I'm not a threat to your life with John, he clearly doesn't want to talk to me again..."
Not caring about his burning lungs or his painful legs.
His sister-in-law, always the romantic, murmurs to herself, "I'm certain that it was magic!"
Scanning the student,
As a result, he had a lot of time to think, to be bored, to drive everyone around him crazy!
Is it M Holmes?
“You really didn’t know...” Sally chuckles, looking at John in amazement. “He worked undercover for us, silly man, how stupid you must feel right now! He changed his look, colored his hair and everything.” Her attitude switches to pity when she saw the hurt in John’s face. “You know, he doesn’t deserve any... feelings you may have for him. He’s a bloody psychopath.”  The pregnant silence that falls between them was cut short by McAlister angry growl.
“Everything alright, mate?” Mike asks, when they finally stop in front of the pub. “You’re usually more talkative.” A little joyful smirk appears on the man’s lips. “Is this about a laaaaaaady? Or more serious about a gentlemaaaaan?” He always knew that John was bi and has always been convinced that his friend would be better fitted with a man.
“I am not only a one-night stand man for them!” John argued, even if he wasn’t that sure about it! “They are in love with me! For real! It’s just that... life... life is complicated and...” He closed his eyes a moment, the enormous quantity of men and women who only stayed with him for a few dates before breaking.
"Sir, the doctor called a few minutes ago, your brother is finally fully awake and is asking for you."
Surprised and a bit lost, the detective sputters “Where’s everybody?”
“Yes, never been better. I was wondering, anyone up for a pint tonight?”
you have planned for Angelo’s?”
“I’m afraid these need to come off now,” John said with feigned sadness, gesturing to the nipple clamps decorating Sherlock’s chest. “The question is, should I just pull them off, or do you think you earned me taking them off the way I put them on?”
But not fast enough before Winston came back and was now approaching him.
“I will,” John assured and left the room.
He then brought the rope over Sherlock’s right shoulder, down his sternum, and connected the two lines already there, before running it back up over his left shoulder and tying it in the back.
John crossed his arms over his chest. “Says Mister I’m a natural actor and going to play hard to get. I’m so going to get you on the first try in under three minutes.”
John turned his head so he could capture Sherlock’s lips in a slow, still sleepy kiss. “No, not really,” he said when they broke apart. “But you were just as you are in real life.”
After a few minutes of scanning the room, he found Sherlock, in the middle of the dance floor, moving so sinuously and sexy that John’s mouth went dry and his jeans grew tight. He was sure Sherlock had spotted him and was presenting his delectable arse in John’s direction on purpose.
Sherlock urged him to go inside and John barely saw him vanishing around the corner of the building before a heavy wooden door opened and he was greeted by a older man, dressed in a tailcoat suite and he wondered briefly what Sherlock had gotten them into now, but then he stepped in and tentatively made his way through the foyer and was struck speechless when the next pair of doors opened to a massive room.
John was completely entranced by this strange man talking (in that voice) and how he just relayed this information as if he was describing the solar system, so it was completely unintentional for John to breath an awed, “Amazing,” before he could think about it.
Don’t stop, don’t stop, I’m actually going to…oh
They took a cab to the next bar, and although the evening wasn’t exactly happening the way John envisioned, it wasn’t awkward, it was still somehow good, amazing even.
been dreaming about, John.”
Sherlock’s eyes were a mixture of uncertainty and gratitude and John didn't even have to think about it. “I’m sure, Sherlock. I really am.”
When John came back down he practically attacked Sherlock, straddling him and plunging his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth with enthusiasm that Sherlock couldn’t possibly have anything against and was giving back as good as he was getting.
He knew Sherlock loved this, he had outright stated so after the second week of them sleeping together and John had had no idea what hit him, because after that, and John giving his more than enthusiastic agreement, he was the very lucky recipient of multiple blowjobs a week.
“How are you so beautiful,” John said when he reached Sherlock and sealed there lips together again in a heated kiss. It came to an end all to soon and John began kissing down his body, spending some extra time on his nipples before going further down and swirling his tongue in Sherlock’s belly button and finally coming to his attention demanding erection. “Close your eyes.”
John saw a flicker in Sherlock’s eyes and he new it was over. His slips were formed into a thin line, a frown wrinkling his eyebrows and then, “John do you actually plan on trying to pick me up in the next few minutes or are you waiting another decade?”
John started rubbing them with his thumbs to get them hard and the circulation going while murmuring, “You’re so beautiful, Sherlock. All naked and staying patiently were I want you. Maybe we should buy a big mirror sometime, so you can see yourself, see how lovely that flush on you looks and your cock so hard, just for me.”
He was so deep in trying to prevent his own climax that when he heard John order, “Come for me, Sherlock,” he would swear he did not make the conscious decision to follow that command.
“Very good. I want you to choose a safeword now.”
“Good boy,” John praised, “do you remember the other two rules as well?”
He started to stroke them in earnest again and when he felt himself getting close, which only took a few strokes, he said, “Sherlock, look at me.”
“Up you go,” John said and pulled Sherlock to his feet. “Kneel on the middle of the bed, back to the headboard.”
The only answer to that John got was a sheepish nod and it was just so endearing, John couldn't keep the fond smile off his face.
“Please, I—I can’t. I can’t hold out, Sir.”
At this point, John wasted no thoughts on the fact that this was the first time they were going to have sex, or how the progress went from flatmates to kinky sex plays in a matter of minutes, because all he wanted to do was feel Sherlock’s cock in his hand and watch that face when he orgasmed.
“Vengeful spirits are very strong. Especially this one.”
It seemed to take Sherlock quite by surprise as John could see his knees tremble out of the corner of his eyes and Sherlock braced himself on the lab table to his right.
John jerked upright.
So John grabbed the lube from the bedside table and got up on the bed, straddling Sherlocks thighs and the feel of those muscles flexing underneath him and the heat that radiated through his skin brought him so much closer to the edge already, it should have been embarrassing.
When he entered the room, Sherlock was exactly where and how John told him to be and as his gaze fell on the riding crop, his eyes widened, filling with want and his cock gave a strong twitch and John was pleased to have the visual conformation that his choice was met with great enthusiasm.
He was pretty sure, he wouldn’t be here today, if that day didn’t happen, if he had not taken that path through the park, if he had not agreed to have a coffee with Mike, if he had declined coming with him so Bart’s.
It was enough for John to only touch the first clamp to make Sherlock want to screw his eyes shut, but he forced himself to look into John’s eyes, fingernails digging into the palms of his hand and the blatant portrayal of power exchange in that moment made his arousal spike to new heights and his cock impossibly harder.
It didn’t really make a difference, John knew that part where thigh met butt was extremely sensitive and going by Sherlock’s scream, John wasn’t mistaken.
What he would give right now for those beautiful lips to be wrapped around his cock, sucking him down and gagging on it.
“Look at me,” Sherlock ordered softly and when those deep blue eyes found his again, he continued, “You are allowed to have this, to feel this way and to ask for it whenever you want, not just when I know you need it. Understood?”
John new he couldn’t show any weakness or hesitation, so he didn’t and laid the first one perfectly to the center of Sherlock’s left arse cheek, on top of two already very prominent crop strikes.
