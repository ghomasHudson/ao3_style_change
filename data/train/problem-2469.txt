Sitting with his legs sprawled and Cas wedged there in between them, Dean is nearly at eye level with Cas' junk. Dean knows his own boner is tenting the towel in an obscene way, but there's something about the obvious outline of Cas' hard-on that turns Dean into an active, if not more dominant, participant. Riding an impulse, Dean leans forward and sucks at Cas through his pants.
"Yeah, and where the hell were you, Cas? God, it's like you--" Dean cuts himself off and swallows hard. They're not getting into this. Not when Cas is loopy on flu medicine and Dean's running on two hours of sleep.
So, one, not hacked, and two, that's a sigh of complaint on Dean's end because now he's obligated to click the link. He types back quick.
It's no surprise when Cas stiffens. "If it's a choice between your life or mine, if I can save you--"
Dean rolls to his side by way of an answer, dragging the covers up to his shoulders. He ignores Cas's eyes on him.
Dean snorts. In Cas-speak, that's practically like calling them narcissistic assholes. It's a dumb, childish reaction, but Dean feels thrilled by Cas' words for some reason, as if they're buddying up and bonding over the lameness of Sam-and-Amelia together. Like next comes the no-take-backs blood swap and the sworn NO GIRLS ALLOWED oath.
"I heard that, Joanna Beth!" Ellen shouts from all the way in the back storage room, ears like a friggin' bat.
Finally, Cas smiles, but it's so small and so forced, Dean knows he's fucked before the guy even says anything.
Realizing that this conversation is going to continue, Dean tosses his keys to the table. He walks around Cas, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose. "That's different."
A couple seconds later Cas flicks on the light switch that only turns on the desk lamp, not the overhead light, but it's still bright and still an intrusion. The knowing look Cas gives Dean isn't any better.
"Which of course in no way implies we're romantically bound in any way," Cas says then, with an unassuming look at Dean who, in fact, did take that to mean they were romantically bound, so thank god. Thank the non-actual god, for real.
Close proximity with another dude wasn't new for Dean. Not that he'd ever done anything beyond platonic space-sharing. Dean was a tactile guy and if he happened to express his feelings through touch instead of words, whatever.
It's a forced foreplay, and going this slow makes Dean feel like his skin is turning inside out. It sinks down to his bones. Cas closes his eyes and exhales out his nose and trembles a little when Dean snakes his other hand between them, then trembles harder when the button of his jeans is popped open.
Embarrassed, Cas defends, "I believe we may have bonded in our time together. Before the assassination attempt on my life, anyway." Then, like it's highly classified, he confesses, "We're both fans of 'The Greatest American Hero.'"
"Weird night," he eventually goes with. For the record, he knows it's a lame ass thing to say as soon as he says it, but he's owning it anyway.
(Never mind that weird stretch of time in his early twenties when they came close to having sex on more than one occasion. The threat of Ellen shooting him with the shotgun she kept behind the bar far outweighed both his desire to get laid and whatever mutual attraction fleetingly popped up between him and Jo.)
He looks down and finds that, up to his elbow, his arm's been bandaged fully, and now that it's secured, there's only a minor pain. Barely even a throb.
Stirring the onions, he makes room to slide two burgers onto the skillet. Right away hot oil starts popping everywhere and Dean has to turn the heat down low, drop a cover on top.
He's deflecting. Sam ain't stupid. He isn't in the mood to push the point and unleash Dean's anger, either, so he wisely shuts himself up and does as told, chugging it when Charlie starts hollering at him to.
"Come again!" Dean trills sarcastically, and then he accuses, "Freak," under his breath as soon as the door's closed. "What's his problem? Yeesh."
"Vocationally," he shoots right at him with a tight, ain't-my-life-swell grin. More cocky, he adds, "Yeah, and for leisure too."
"Huh," Bobby grunts. There's a lengthy pause as Dean shuts the water off and dries his hands on a rag he guesses is only half-clean. "You believe him?"
Across the booth, Sam kicks back into the padded polyester behind him, dragging out a coaster that'd been tucked into a napkin holder near the wall. "Relax. You're antisocial, Dean. No one's going to bother you."
That's a joke. Sam has three friends, max, and half of those he borrows from Dean. The other one's imaginary.
of that. Who knows how much, but the idea of Cas getting an earful of Dean's private business, even if it was just the tail end, sends Dean stomping past the counter and through the partition until he's alone in the back.
Cas asked while burying his nose into Deans neck- not so subtly inhaling his alpha scent. “Dean, are you ok? I was worried about you.”
His chest burning with love as he thought of how mates would be the ones who usually engaged in such closeness.
“Why would you punish and isolate someone who has been nothing but kind, compassionate and caring to everyone, hmm!? He didn’t ask to be born a half breed!” He held unto Sam’s hand for comfort and to restrain his alpha from charging after the Milton Pack leader.
but found himself drifting off into a pleasant state as a scent so alluring and heavenly permeated the air around them.
He again heard the purring chesty rumble of his alpha. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes at his own wolfs enthusiasm. All he focused on was how happy he was to be given the opportunity to keep his omega warm, comforted and safe while they slept. He nodded, “Ok then sweetheart, hop in.”
without tripping over your gimp leg, Bobby! I wouldn’t be surprised if you fell into the crapper while trying to take a leak too!”
“Nope, not God, Cas. Janes! And, they have been making the best damn burgers for nearly 20 years now. I used to come here a lot in high school”. Cas’ look of bliss was making his tummy flutter- Cas being happy, made him feel all tingly and full with pride.
It was during family time that Castiel got to meet the two legged human versions of the entire Winchester family. It was time for a few beers and hot chocolate (for little Winchester) in the living room, by the fireplace.
with whomever you bring here!... At least you could have respected their wishes, Cas!” He knew he was being an ass, but, like he said, he wanted to push.
. The female omega was of course oblivious to his shifty reactions, purring into his ear, “You’re not wasting my time, baby. How about I take care of you in the bedroom. Hmm?” Her hands were pressing into the front of his zipper- trying to feel him up.
. Silently, his own tears fell, grieving alongside his husband as they both dwelled on the unfairness that has become their lives. That’s how they had fallen asleep- exhausted and thinking of what tomorrow might bring.
He had no one, well except for his half brother, Gabriel. His half brother stayed with his wolf father in one of the cabins in the Milton Encampment- son of his mother’s second mate. The wolf was 2 years younger than him and was always friendly. If there was a wolf he cherished, it was his little brother, Gabriel.
. A warrior vamp, whose specialty lie in wielding knives. His signature weapon was a triangular 3 dimensional silver blade- designed by himself to cut through the thickest of lycan and werewolf skins- like a knife through butter.
He gnawed at his bottom lip, his heart doing a small somersault. He opened the pouch and dipped his hand in. His hand felt something cold, metallic and hard. He carefully pulled out the tiny object, immediately sucking in a breath.
Somehow, Dean and Castiel had paused in their tracks, with John and Sam walking way ahead. Dean just wanted to comfort his upset mate, so he rested his chin on the top of Cas head, blowing the air out of his nose against Cas cute ear. He purred soothingly,
He had watched him grow into a fine young omega. He watched- hopefully inconspicuously- from the shadows of the trees nearly every night- starting from just before the blue eyed omega turned 13. Except that one time a few years back- where his wolf became excited to catch a very first glimpse of its future mate. Thank heavens for the omega running away or else he would have overstepped his boundaries and possibly breaking the truce that had been kept solid for nearly 100 years.
14 years of Dean by his side. 14 years of the alpha rooming right next to him. 14 years of shared laughter and heartache- and now, here they finally were.
. Didn’t mean that it would hurt less, when the truth came out. He cleared the thickness in his throat, and of course, resorted to downgrading himself. “I um- yeah…I mostly kept to myself and stayed hidden. Um- more so, a hermit”.
Dean kept sneaking peaks at his future mates wolf. The first time he had laid eyes on Cas, after transformation, he knew he was screwed for life.
Dean couldn’t help but lower his gaze to the floor of the car, hugging himself tighter as he felt a sudden chill run through his entire being. He flatly stated, “So that I’m sound enough to be sold as a sex slave. No one wants to fuck a beat down omega”.
He smiled half heartedly, “Hey Gabe. What are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be getting all done up for the annual meet tonight?” He studied his little brothers casual wear: Jeans and brown checkered shirt that has seen better days.
The Winchester men chuckled in affection. Meanwhile, Castiel’s heart was melted beyond repair. He responded, “Well thank you for the nickname, sweetheart. I think it’s lovely”. He then answered the little ones question, “And, I think butterflies are definitely cute, Gem”.
Castiel threw his head back, exposing his long neck and luring Dean’s mouth to that perfect skin. Castiel cried wantonly as Dean sucked on his neck hard while he couldn’t help but bounce on the alphas two fingers, “Oh God! Yes I have fucked myself open for you Dean. Oh God! Please give it to me, alpha!”
So, he slapped on a smile behind the camera, and had to make some tough choices. He stood his ground, not taking his eyes off Cas steely blue ones, voice tired as he said, “Cas, I couldn’t come because I had too many things on my plate. It was a sacrifice I needed to make.”
He was shivering in anger, feeling his blood boil as he suddenly narrowed his blurry vision on all the frozen shut faces of Sam, Dean, Mary, John and Gabriel. He felt a bit queasy to be the focus of attention but that was overridden by his unbridled anger at the sight of Dean.
Dinner was hotdogs, hamburgers, corn dogs and apple pies. As they ate, they walked around visiting farm animals in a pen,  green houses and watching a pie eating contest. Dean even took him to game booths and won him a large squishy bee.
Sam was like a dog with a bone to find. When he sniffed its location, you could bet he won’t stop till he digs it up or snatches it away. His brother would get things out of him one way of the other. So, he settled for saying, “look I’ll tell you everything tonight, ok”. He glanced at the papers in his hands, “In the meantime, I gotta get my signed contract back to the accountant, get the tour of the garage done- which FYI I already know the layout, but, Ellen says it necessary for all new employees and no one can argue with that woman anyways”. He sighs, “I start proper tomorrow. I seriously can’t wait to get my hands greased up!”
Castiel thought of leaving, many times. However, he couldn’t. He didn’t want to leave his 16 year old omega brother, Gabriel, behind. Legally, he had no authority over Gabe. So, he was waiting for his little brother to turn 18 and then he was taking his brother and hitting the road. He wasn’t going to linger here any longer.
It was as if destiny was even more determined now that alpha and omega were together once more. Most affected was his heart. Within a short time span, he was already pushing away his anger towards Dean and falling for the alpha- just like he always did, growing up.
Castiel is in his human form, while, Dean and Sammy are in their wolf forms. Dean is speaking to Cas telepathically, whilst, Cas is talking.
As if reading Dean’s mind, Cas guided Dean’s hands down his body till he was gripping that omega ass. He moaned as Dean squeezed those globes, pulling away from Dean’s hungry kisses with a wet pop. He whispered against Dean’s swollen wet lips, “I’m ready for your cock Dean. Make me cum on it.”
Castiel pointed out, “YOU ARE LIVING UNDER MY ROOF! FUCK YOUR RIGHTS, WHORE! Under wolf laws, an omega whose household is threatened may execute harsh punishments, to see there is no destabilization to their family! I am exercising my rights as the omega of this house!” He fumed, “either you comply or I kick you to the curb! I found my loophole, Anna! Don’t fuck with me! That goes for you and the damn wolf council or more so, you and that conniving piece of shit, Crowley!”
Dean quivered under Castiel’s touch, leaning in and crushing his lips into Cas. Yes, after they took care of a few important things.
It would eventually become a bond that will force them to ignore the thought of being brothers. It was one of the purest bonds out there and 99.99% of the time, wolves gave in and bonded with their destined mates.
His eyes searched, his eyes was drawn to him. The graceful omega with the slight limp, in the sky blue gown. Those blue eyes, that dark hair and those beautiful perfect pink lips reminded him of the a certain wolf.
“Son, a promise is a big deal. You only make them if you’re going to keep them.” His dad raised a serious brow.
Ellen threw in an amused brow, “Well, the way I see it, sweetie; if you’ve already been for a first date and going for a second, then, I’ll label you as boyfriends”.
And apparently, so did the blue eyed man- judging by the darker blush that painted Cas cheeks. The shy blue eyed man nodded, “I’m ok with you guiding me, Dean”.
He bit his bottom lip to stifle his smile some, before greeting, “Hello Dean”. Damn, his cheeks were hurting as blood rushed up into it.
Cas pulled out of the hug and smiled shyly at him, “thank you for showing me how to play pool, Dean”.
I’m so sorry that this took me so long to update. I had been going through a massive writers block plus with my added depression, it really was hard to focus.
He nearly jumped when he felt his brothers fingers thread into his. Gabe had decided to accompany him and their father to the drop off point. His little brother, who was the middle child, didn’t feel right staying home or imagining that he’d never see his big brother again.
The jay bird took them onto a hidden path, beyond the boulders. It was still Winchester territory, however, it wasn’t explored much. He huddled close to Dean, as his old friend flew above them, its little wings flapping so excitedly.
It was Castiel who finally spoke. “I’m sorry that I put Kaylen in danger, Dean.” His voice trembled with sadness and an unmistakable fear. Now he just wanted to turn back time and rip Chuck and his posse a new asshole for upsetting his mate. But, he was more focused on the fact that Castiel had felt that he had put Kaylen in harms way.
Dean replied, eyes transfixed on the healed bite mark on Castiel’s neck. “Yeah. God, Cas is so beautiful.” He loved the way the omega glowed in all his happiness.
He scowled at the alpha as he was jerked forward by his binds, nearly making him trip over his own feet, the alpha barking, “Keep up Castiel!”
Then, he felt Dean’s furry body nearly cover him whole. The alpha liked to rest/plaster himself along his entire back- Dean was big enough that his tiny human form could fit snuggly inside the black wolfs underbelly.
Some watched in intense enjoyment whilst fondling their mates, some were making out intensely, some were just grinding fully clothed or bare breasted to the drumming tribal music. It was a little too much sexual energy for him than he was used to. Guess, this is the normal in any barbarian celebration where all were presumedly drunk and horny.
He had already made up his mind that he would return to Lawrence. He didn’t know why! It was the most painful place to come back to, after Jimmy had passed. But, he still had a lot of important people in Lawrence to see. His baby brother, his baby brother’s fiancé, his mom and dad, his surrogate dad and mom (Bobby and Ellen), his good friends Benny, Adam, Michael, Ash, Cassie and Dorothy.
He saw amusement in Dean’s eyes. The alpha looked like he had spotted a prey. And that made him hot under his old nightgown- again felt himself leaking. In his mind, all he could think was ‘
John sighed, sitting on his favorite leather chair. The older Winchester smiled a little on the sad side, ‘Son, you and Sam are sons to the pack leader, therefore, it is customary that you are mated between the ages of 20- 25.’ The alpha leader rubbed a hand down his face, ‘Look son, mating doesn’t mean that you immediately give up on yours goals and aspirations. It doesn’t mean you start a family immediately. You and your intended mate can still continue your education, make something of yourselves and when you’re ready have a family.”
He lightly brought a palm to Cas mid back and applied pressure lightly so the man bent down at an angle, leaning slightly over the pool table; and, he did followed, nearly covering the man’s back with his entire torso.
Kaylen didn’t stop talking, asking with his head tilted to the side, “What colors your wolf, Cas?” He continued to add, “my furs brown like daddy’s and I got a white bushy tail!”
He found it weird that daddy was with Dean today. Momma was always the one that sponged their heads and looked after all of them, whenever they were feeling sick.
He has blue eyes, dark messy hair (the I just woke up from sleep, sex hair kind), handsome features (pink lips, cute nose, strong jaw), he was tall (6’0””), and he had a fit lean body. So why?
“Its ok love. You didn’t wake me. My nightmare did and when I didn’t see you in bed, I thought I’d come check you in the kitchen”. Castiel turned to glare at Anna, who still stood there, in all her naked glory, without a care in the world. He asked, “Do you have any ounce of shame?”
I am so sorry that I did not update in a week. I have been real busy and when I finally get the time to update, I'm tired. Anyway, here's a long chapter for you...I hope you enjoy!
They shared one last hug, before, Dean was sitting himself back by the island and he was off pecking his mom, dad and Castiel on the cheeks with a
. He carefully lifted his gaze, to finally settle on those softened smiling green eyes, hoping Dean could hear his thoughts as he uttered in such fondness, '
Unfortunately, Castiel had had a miscarriage at 3 months pregnant. And it broke both Dean and he, seeing as they had been trying to conceive for nearly 5 years.
Mary nodded, “Mhmm. It wasn’t that Dean just happened to stumble upon a white furred, cold pup near the streams, 10 years back. He was led there, drawn there, by your scent, Castiel. He was drawn there by the destined bond you both share. Your paths had to cross at that exact moment because you were fated to be mated someday.”
Mary smiles at the little omega, and caught the way Dean suddenly turned crimson beside Cas. The little alpha was chewing on his bottom lip, the sound of his heart beat could be heard increasing, and the alpha was bouncing his knees, unable to fully focus on anything but the carpeted floor at his feet. She was going to say something when Dean finally spoke up in a slightly cracked voice, shaking his head, eyes burning holes into the carpet, “We’re sorry mom. We know it’s wrong. We shouldn’t feel this way for each other, because we are brothers.” A confirmation that Dean had been feeling the same as Cas about their
She had said to wear his black ass and thigh hugging jeans, his blue button down with a black blazer and black skinny tie. He had on a pair of black sneakers to go with his look. Yeah, he sort of had an odd fashion choice but he liked it- might as well get comfortable seeing as he might be ridiculed.
Here he was setting up the proper documents for the new employees contract, when his office door was shoved open.
Dean chuckled warmly, before pointing out, “there are three essentials needed when playing pool, and they are- #1 the pool table, #2 the cue stick, #3 the pool balls. The pool balls all have different numbers- there are currently 15 pool balls that we’ll be using for this game.The 8 ball is the black one, the rest belong to two groups- #1 the solids or evens and #2, the stripes or odds”. Dean picks up the white ball. “This one is called the cue ball. This is the one you use to make your strikes. Whoever breaks and whatever ball they manage to drop into the pocket owns that particular group, which means your game involves getting your group of pool balls into the pockets before your opponent is finished with theirs. The last ball to pocket is the 8 ball. You pocket that, after finishing your set, makes you the winner. You accidentally drop your opponents pool ball into the pocket, that’s more points for them. You knock an 8 ball in without finishing your set, you lose”. Dean asked, “I hope you understand, Cas. Let , me know if you don’t”.
Then daddy gestured to the blue eyed person sitting beside grandma, daddy spoke softly and sweetly like he always spoke around him as he said, “And this here is Castiel Novak. He is daddy’s future mate.”
He nodded, “Mhmm.” Before, carefully pulling himself back into a sitting position, rubbing at the back of his head that was slightly throbbing.
The popular alpha stopped Lucifer from doing the horrible and all it took was a shove and glare at the other alpha. The young Winchester alpha growled and snatched back the picture from a smirking Lucifer, “Give it back, man! Not cool!”
John had both Castiel and Dean with him to present their findings and he was hoping that the five council alphas would accompany them to the Novak Pack lands to get a look of what bad really happened there 17 years ago. To hear from Michael Novak’s mouth about the massacre Lucifer Milton had carried out.
It was quiet enough to be eerie. Maybe, he and Cas should just shut up. After all, it was dangerous to be out here surrounded by alphas. They shouldn’t be ticking anyone off! But, his curiosity was just as equivalent to Cas.
This time it was Dean’s turn to securely keep his omega by his side as he could sense Castiel becoming pissed- which was a whole new Castiel for him to be honest.
To his surprise, Castiel blurted out a strong, “NO! I want you to continue visiting me! I need to see you!”
Anna had left he and his baby boy Kaylen, soon after she was discharged from the hospital post delivery. Oh how it was touch and go from there and he never had much time to focus on anything else but his little boy. Thank heavens for his mother, she knew exactly how to help him out nursing his little omega prince.
Well. He hadn’t been out since he touched down in Lawrence. A get together with the guys was actually pretty thrilling. He shrugged, “sure, why not!”
“They were white wolves. Like me dad. At least 20 of them. And, all were alphas except for one who was an omega.”
She handed a few thornless white roses for him to hold. Soon, she walking over to the counter and getting the flowers bundled up with a fancy midnight laced string. He proceeded with the payments before accepting the flowers from her. The sweet smell was so calming. He smiled at Missouri, “thank you. These flowers are exquisite, as always”.
Dean knew in his heart that this was always something he wanted all along. The only difference was that today he wasn’t scared to pursue what he wanted. Cas as his mate. He nodded, eyes smiling,
But just as Dean and Cas were getting up from the sofa, Anna’s voice sounded annoyed and sarcastic just by the entrance to the living room, “oh please. Don’t let me disturb your precious moment. Take your time. It’s not like I was abandoned in the car or anything by my future mate and father of my pups”.
Of course, when he got on his bed, he pulled his knees to his chest, curved up into an almost perfect ball and sobbed quietly. His omega missed Dean.
Dean cleared his throat, “Um- I didn’t mean to make you feel like your eyes aren’t admirable, Castiel. It’s just, the first thing I noticed about you was your eyes, and they are an interesting shade of blue”.
Though he previously worked in an industry that demanded he show his nakedness and sex to select clientele; he was still blown away by how brute and unashamed the barbarians were- literally screwing their mates fully exposed before all at this gathering- both in absolute enjoyment and pleasure, moaning so loud that the Gods could probably hear them from the heavens.
He asked a little strained, “Um- can you get off my chest, little omega. Or else, I won’t be able to breathe in a few seconds.”
That little reminder had him taking a deep breath, and concentrating on the pairs conversation instead. And God damnit, did he find the fact that Castiel didn’t know a damn thing about playing pool
. And after meeting Cas and the way he had fallen so rapidly for the blue eyed man, he would conclude that maybe, he felt drawn to Jimmy because Cas was also a part of his twin.
“I’m more important than her, Dean!” His omega wolf was in total agreement, filled with determination. “Your free time should be spent with me!”
Seeing Cas face when the man inhaled the delicious aroma of food wafting out the little classic diner made him feel super excited and thankful. The icing on the cake was the rumble of Cas hungry tummy-  which got the man to blush so adorably- probably from his shyness. But, he wasn’t focused on that.
Dean answered with a pleading look aimed at him, “The omega carrying the apple pie scent. Do you know who it could be, Gabe? Is there anyone that you are close to that isn’t here?”
Dean was calling his name, Gabe was calling his name. His trepidation began to slowly fizzle away, instead anger and irritation  began to bubble within him.
He already felt tears flooding his eyes, as he stood by the gravestone he so dearly yearned to see. His eyes taking in the fresh white roses placed in a crème colored vase, before Jimmy’s headstone. Someone had been visiting Jimmy’s grave and showering the teen with his favorite white roses.
. He then caught his fathers glassy eyes. The town alpha nodded, signaling that it was time to leave. He believed he was ready enough to too. He nudged Dean’s snout with his wolf nose,
He cleared his throat, rubbing the back of his neck, “Um- sorry- I should have asked you permission first”. He added, “Castiel’s a mouthful. A nice name though! But, yeah…um- so I figured Cas would be catchy.”
Michael narrowed his eyes at the pair that were approaching. What in the hell was Castiel doing, supporting a frail omega like that? He barked, “Castiel! Why are you being so….kind…to this omega? He is a slave of the Novak mansion and should be treated as such!” He sniffed the air, his eyes widening as he caught the unmistakable alpha scent of his brother all over this omega. Oh, so Castiel already had some fun with this omega? He smirked, “Did you drill him, before bringing him over, Castiel? Wanted to have some alone time before we alphas took our turns, hmm?”
Again, it felt like his heart was tearing itself into pieces. He sniffled, “I shouldn’t have called Cas needy, whiny and suffocating, dad. It was wrong of me.”
His heart hurt, but, he refused to budge. He refused to shed any tears, though his vision was cloudy.
He suddenly remembered that he was all dressed up in a black suit and tie, hair combed neat and sleek and wearing his favorite silver watch his father had bought him as a gift a few years back. He refused to leave for the Annual Meet without at least seeing his baby boy off to bed with a bedtime story and a kiss on the forehead. He booped his son’s freckled nose, “Thank you baby. That’s very sweet of you to say.”
Bobby’s truck and a classic 1967 Chevy Impala was already parked side by side, in the yard. He parked his car beside the classic car and got out. Well, his car looked ridiculous beside that beautiful muscled car. Maybe, he should go park his car beside all the junked up cars stacked in Bobby Singers car yard out back.
Dean was fuming and growled. He was going to head towards the disrespecting omega and was thinking of tossing her outside his home when he felt his husbands soft hands grab onto his, halting him in his footsteps. Then, Castiel stepped to his side, meeting his eyes with a much more alert and livened yet calm look.  “It’s ok Dean”.
He watched as Dean basically guzzled two huge slices of pie within minutes. He was feeling damn proud of himself that his date enjoyed the pastry. He was content with just sitting on the dining table a little while longer, staring at Dean or losing himself in those beautiful green orbs, while he sipped on wine, letting the red liquid fill him up with so much buzz.
Now, a full hour later, Dean was coming down hill, with someone else. That seemed to stop the party goers, some gasping and frantically grumbling whilst some just stared on. The most annoying was Chuck, who looked like his eyes were about to fall out of its sockets. Then, his face quickly morphed into one of absolute disgust and rage- all while hawk eyeing the omega in Dean’s arms.
He wasn’t going to stand for Cas degrading himself. He shook his head, “Hey, don’t say that, ok. Not many people travel into the outskirts of Lawrence anyway. And, I have a feeling that you’re not much of a takeout or eat out kinda guy.”
He watched the man take him in too. He watched the man frown at him and finally was the first to speak up, saying, “you’re…are you….Jimmy’s….please just tell me that you’re not Jimmy!” He could hear the nervousness in the man’s tone.
These quick shifts in between moods was making him concerned for his husband. He felt Castiel’s words shake him to the very core as his mate said in an icy tone with a stoic dangerous look, “Oh try me, Anna. I’m a changed omega and I will protect my family at all costs. I’m done with all your shit!”
He couldn’t help but feel a little boldness grow within him and maybe a little coyness- whereby he had no idea where it came from. He asked quietly, eyes searching the alphas, “And, have you found this omega tonight?”
He and Dean cared for each other…a lot….they practically spent a lot of time with each other…so maybe Dean was missing him…..just like he missed Dean, this last week and a half.
His heart skipped several beats, eyes meeting Deans suddenly and equally curious ones. His alpha nodded reassuringly, coaxing him to ask the next question.
He smiled faintly, before his eyes met the ground- pinching the grass out with his fingers. He didn’t even want to look up at the Jay Bird that sat on the little tree branch.
Both lay panting, cuddling and sharing sweet kisses. Castiel loved listening to Dean’s heartbeat and feeling the man’s warmth against him. He thumbed at his lovers nipple. “I don’t want us to ever end, Dean”.
Sam wiggles his nose cutely, a small smile slowly showing itself, “You are not carrying 2 but 3 different scents, which is quite unusual as all wolves are supposed to only have 2.”
So yeah, big surprises when his little brother turned on the charm and made the short blonde omega before him swoon and blush. Cute.
“No Dean! YOU COME! And when you’re done with Anna, then we can work on building this bond between us! I will allow it!” The omega ordered, “DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR ALPHA!?”
Dean loved to look at his kind- Lycans- as more sensible, intelligent beasts. Whereas, the Lycans cousins, Werewolves- were mindless, killing machines filled with wrath and complete destruction.
No one was looking, but, he suddenly felt nervous as he approached the pool table. He watched Charlie make the first break and with it she managed to sink in one of the full colored balls. So that meant that his was the other type of pool balls… right? He pointed to the number 13 orange and white ball, “So, what do you call the pool balls I’ll be shooting in?”
He huffed a tired chuckle, “Oh my God, Cas! Jesus! Charlie isn’t someone I’m boning! Charlie is a female alpha that rooms with me.” He thinks of his red headed friends
Castiel and Gabriel walked over to Sam and Dean with beaming smiles on their faces. Castiel jumped into his alphas arms while Gabe did the same. Castiel laid a quick peck on Dean’s lips, murmuring, “Baby, lets go to the streams where you found me. Please!”
He smiled happily. He liked it whenever Dean inhaled his scent and gave him compliments. His omega wolf was yipping for joy inside him. It was so weird to feel this excited, but, it was nice.
. But, he knew that he’d have to talk to Dean first. He wasn’t going to assume anything. So, he said, “I’ll speak with him tonight.” He smiled, “And, thank you for letting me know what Dean enjoys”.
“He has to know that we will love anyone he chooses to love, right John?”Mary leaned into her husband’s side, finding comfort in her husband’s warm embrace.
Oh how his chest filled with this strange giddy feeling and his heart was once again fluttering in excitement.
Dean is around 9 years old in this chapter. Cas is 5 years old. Dean is in human form in this chapter, whilst, Cas is in his wolf form.
Secondly was Sam Winchester. He was real tall, like NBA player tall. He was at least 6 foot 4. Thank heavens they were seated or else Castiel would have to strain his neck, looking up at the tall alpha. The second eldest Winchester son had shoulder length brown hair that looked glossy under the orange glows of the fire, doe eyes that could sway the decision of any one- even the cruelest wolf out there, hazel like irises that could be compared to kaleidoscope of different shades of brown, soft features, and spoke in the smoothest of tones Castiel had ever heard. Like his elder brother, Sam was a simple man, dressed in a buttoned up blue and white checkered flannel and light blue jeans, coupled with black boots. The alpha was almost 18 and seemed to be real close to his dad, nestling into his fathers chest, as the older Winchester alpha draped an arm over his middle child’s shoulder.
Eventually, legend has it that Lucian rebelled against Viktor, and managed a great escape, with the help of Viktor’s only daughter.
“I was heartbroken that night dad!” He boomed, “You should’ve looked at me as your son who was suffering and confused, you should have said ‘fuck pack traditions’ and guided me towards my mate. It is your job as a father to be there for me, to lead me towards happiness.” He scoffed, “Instead, you pushed me away and sent me off to some Institution where I didn’t get to see my family, Sammy and my mate for 10 years! Did you ever stop to think how it would make me feel? Better yet, did you ever miss me?” His voice trembled with emotion now, tears clouding his vision once more.
Cas straightened as Dean came closer, and his confusion turned into worry because of whatever Dean was staring at him with. It was probably heart-eyes because, nope, no more denying it, no more pretending this wasn't the most profound thing to ever happen to Dean. He was gay out of his fucking mind for Cas.
"Says the man to the girl with eyes, hello. Tell me something I don't know. How's my hair look?" She smooths it down one-handed, taming some fly-aways.
“Try ‘boring as hell.’ You know how many migraines I’ve had the past two weeks? How many allergies?”
The hopeful way she's staring, though, probably means she's not asking him about his penis in the middle of a craft store. Go figure.
He shuts up, though, when the backs of Dean's fingers drag across the stubble of his chin. He's been wondering about that. There isn't a beard, not quite, but it'll leave a burn.
Cas doesn't let go of his bad mood as easily. He wipes the dust from his hands onto his shirt and goes back to the crates.
"You were wrong," he agrees easily, and Cas ducks his head to avoid the truth of it. "You pull the same crap over and over and every time, you're wrong."
Dean eyes a woman down the bar who keeps eyeing them back, her tank top pulled down just a little bit lower each time. He nods at her to reel her in, telling Cas distractedly, “Dude, you need this, okay. Trust me.”
"It's about time," Jo says with a laugh. "I swear, the way you are, and the way he is, it's like night and day."
He squints at it for a solid fifteen seconds before brushing it off as spam. Or, like, a sent message from the recently hacked. Probably Cas, saint that he is, got duped by one of them Prince of Algeria 'send me your bank account number and personal information' emails, and now look what's happened.
It took a couple of minutes -- Cas had to empty out his pant pockets first and slip out of his creepy flasher coat -- but then Cas sank down beside him. Like he was weary, he grabbed Dean's beer from the coffee table and shrugged, taking a long sip. The taste had him frowning before he'd even swallowed.
It's said with such solemn conviction, Dean barks out a laugh. Which, honestly, is the whole point, getting Cas to say that is why he went with this game over anything else. And, okay, a part of him also remembers days like this when Sam was sick as a kid, the two of them spread out on motel beds and their dad gone on a hunt. It's stupid and nostalgic and he knows it's not the same with grown ass men, but those are good memories and, hell, introducing them to Cas can't hurt anything.
Sam spots her as they enter the kitchen together. "Hey. Charlie!" She gets pulled in for a hug. Everyone else is gathered in there, making it the epicenter of social activity. When Sam lets go, he goes down the line of people, saying, "This is Jess, Anna, and Castiel. Guys, this is Charlie."
Sure, Sam seems genuine, but Dean knows that lurking behind that congratulatory demeanor? Is a monster waiting to gloat.
According to his watch, it's only fourteen minutes after six, which means they still have time to waste before setting out. Their plan, roughly thrown together as it is, is to pick a bar and stake it out. The djinn's been attacking every four days, not counting the kill time. That gives them three to work with before some other unlucky sons-of-bitches wind up dead.
Cas made a noise that slipped inside Dean and traveled straight down to his dick, and that was it, that was what calmed the turmoil.
"Okay. Okay, yeah. Something like... 'sorry, buddy, but my girlfriend keeps me on a pretty tight leash el-oh-el.'?"
Cas sticks the paper into his own pocket, then let’s himself be pulled into a much softer kiss, one that makes heat crawl inside of Dean until it reaches his chest; it settles in and claims the space as its own.
Hank looks like he's sporting impressed wood too. Freak. "Yeah. Yeah, man. In the bathroom. 'Cause I went over there to ask, you know, what gives? What's your problem, bro? 'Cause I look out my window and half my motherflippin' 'mingos are pulled out. I go over there after a zen sesh, 'cause I want to rap this out peacefully. So I'm knocking and knocking and no one's answering, and then. It hits me. That smell."
Dean doesn't have that same reassurance this time, so he's left feeling like a fish out of water. Like he's got one foot in both worlds, and he can't tell if this is really it, if he oughta unpack his suitcase and get cozy, or if he should be fighting tooth and nail to get back home.
"Dude, you're ice-skating spilled milk. So, yeah. You suck at this," he notes, pulling Cas from the accident zone.
"The last time we spoke -- well, the time before that. The last time we actually spoke was pleasant, probably because we barely said any words--"
Christine stirs back to life some. At least she looks more tied to reality instead of internally drifting in and out of grief like she's been doing the past five minutes they've all been getting settled. "You're the one who lives with Castiel, right?"
"What?" Dean defended, because Cas was staring at him like he'd gone nuts. "I can't sleep. Turn off the TV."
Six months ago, Cas spent two weeks in what Dean has only referred to out loud as 'the timeout box' but was actually a mental institution that took patients in on a voluntary basis.
Anna files in past him, as does Cas, and Dean wonders if this is some fucked up hallucination or if Cas is really here inside his apartment right now. Which would be nuts if he was, because surely he would've at least mentioned in passing, you know, hey, COMING TO YOUR ABODE.
Dean had given his own responsibilities the one-fingered salute and went with him. Hell, he drove the son-of-a-bitch and paid for half the expenses, but after so many stops at diners and motels and leads that went nowhere, Cas gave up and they returned to Sioux Falls three days after missing Gabe's funeral. And that was the straw that broke Cas. Literally, it broke him, and though Dean sat with him that first day at the hospital, sick with worry and scared out of his mind, he couldn't make himself show up any other time after, too scared of what it meant.
"Hell no." He wraps his arm around his giant of a brother's shoulder and guides them toward an exit. "Any longer in here, I swear. Full on Ted Bundy-ing."
So that's what he does, and Cas goes down easy. "Fuck," Dean says. He blows it out quietly, straddling Cas far enough down that, were Dean not in his jeans still, they would know each other pretty damn biblically right now. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. Cas."
Charlie gives him an unimpressed look for a long beat, sipping judgmentally on her straw as she does. When she finally releases it from her mouth, it's to say, "Check out the girl." Dean, of course, does, scoping out the scene in front of him. "Two o'clock. My two. Not--geez, right over there. Do you even know how to tell time?" Dean notices Cas glancing over as well. There's a dark-haired woman wearing a brown leather bomber's jacket who's cracking open peanuts in a way that has Dean curling inward and instinctively covering a hand over his junk.
Even Cas, who's come down and joined them, seems in on their shared history, making Dean feel like some sort of eavesdropping creeper &/or weirdo loner.
Cas shoots a freaked out look at Dean, then grabs his stomach and curls in on himself, and it's only because Dean raised Sam, the pukiest kid ever, that he even thinks to reach for a waste basket.
He's used to dicks. Social workers who thought they knew better, kids who'd make fun of his clothes—hell, his dad. But he can't remember the last time he so effortlessly got on someone's bad side, and for doing, what? Small talk? Jesus.
the first time!" Dean cuts him off. "I don't know what stick crawled up your ass, but, man, talk about ugly. Sam I know? He's not a bitch like you."
Charlie shoots him a look to let him know this one's on him, and before he can so much as form a response or think up an exit strategy or, hell, absorb any of what he's just been told, she's shooing at him to get a move on.
"I can't force amends," Cas spills real quick. "And I try. I am trying. Except, everything I do only makes it worse--"
With a duck of his head that reeks of embarrassment, Cas says, “You’re very determined to see this happen.” Dean's mind automatically whirs to life to protest—he doesn’t wanna
Slowly Cas' hands come up around him, settling stiffly against Dean's shoulder blades, but that? That is a returned hug. Dean squeezes Cas closer, and it's like that's the last thing Cas needed, because then he's clutching at Dean like Dean's clutching at him.
Meg. He had an evil bitch watching over him that was planning to use him as Crowley bait the first shot she got. Somehow, though, he managed to hold that in.
"Castiel." He adds, "please," almost like it's an afterthought, like something he remembered he was supposed to do more than something he actually meant.
Still struggling, Dean shuffles past, heading in the direction he thinks is his room. He runs into the corner of a hallway and grimaces. "Cas ever texts you for a favor? Ignore it."
Dean stares up at his ceiling, trying to regain his suddenly lost chill. If this was Sam bugging him, Dean would tell him to mind his own business and while he was at it, cut his freaking hair. If it was Lisa, he'd blow her off, and then hopefully get blown. But there's something about Cas, about knowing the guy but not really knowing him, that makes it easy to spill his guts. Or tempts him to, anyway. Probably this is how women fall in love with men in prison.
Sensing that he's not going to get any farther with Dean, Sam huffs out the sort of breath he used to regularly exhale as a moody teenager before stomping to the sink with his dirty dishes, which he dumps without rinsing before glaring his way to his bedroom. Yeesh. Drama queen.
"Maybe you should," Cas told Dean, entirely sincere about it, like Dean wasn't just blowing smoke up Cas' ass, like he'd offered them an alternate solution acceptable to all parties involved. Yeah, wasn't happening.
"Uh, yeah," Benny agrees, chuckling lightly. It's the kind of laugh that starts out in his gut and is barely even a noise by the time it makes it out. "Rough day?"
Then Sam reaches out with one of his ginormous mitts and clamps down on Dean's shoulder in a brotherly fashion.
Then he notices that Sam's got himself a passenger. It's a girl, so he figures it must be Amelia. The wife. That makes something else flare up, nothing close to relief, and he doesn't care for it one bit. He's a grown ass man. He shouldn't be so codependent on his brother; even worse, he shouldn't be so pissy just because his brother is apparently fine and thriving and happy not being dependent on him.
"Die," Sam retorts, pushing past to hog up the bathroom. The door slams shut behind him, and Dean's still smiling when Sam shouts his annoyance over the muggy, slightly damp state Dean left the bathroom in.
The friendship started out slow on the women's side of things, with their different plans to raise their children tempering what was otherwise a polite relationship, but the men were the glue that held the two families together.
Cas follows, waiting as Dean checks the door to see if it's locked. "I wasn't trying to be positive."
But it's silent around him, except for a constant, faraway chirp of some birds and the noisy drone of traffic. Dean twists, and looks, and doesn't find Cas. What he does see is that he's in someone's backyard. There's a kitschy-looking house, creaky back porch and everything, with a friggin' bird bath to boot, but no Castiel.
"Cas." Dean's eyes are squeezed shut. Sam's in the shower, washing off the last five hours on the road, and Dean's snuck outside to pray in the motel parking lot. He tips his head down, colored in the glow of the vending machine. "I know you can't hear me, I know I've got a snowball's shot in hell here, but I hafta try, man. Please. If you're out there, if you're getting this. You gotta fight. You hear me? Keep fighting, 'til I... 'til I can... Please, Cas."
At home, in his room, there's a note on his bed. His closet's been raided of the essentials. That old R2-D2 Star Wars piggy bank he's had since forever is missing its riches of $31, but it, along with the savings account Dean is old enough to have emptied out earlier in the evening, will get him where he's going.
Cas' eyes go sharp in consternation, like he knows Dean's full of crap and there's no need to lash out either, but he doesn't call him out on it. Dean appreciates that enough to drop his anger, at least somewhat. Aside from the lengthy self-reflection, Dean's been standing here thumbing through one of Bobby's old books. It's worn and torn with wear, smudges throughout the whole thing like no one bothered to ever care for it properly. Figures. The old bastard.
"Know what you want?" Dean asks Cas. He hasn't even looked at the menu himself. He knows these kind of places like the back of his hand. Hamburgers, sandwiches, and a basket of chicken tenders, he'd bet his baby on it.
There's such a long, heavy beat of silence that passes, Dean has enough time to reflect on each of his life's regrets.
Dean, again, feels warring emotions, because fuck no, what he wants is Cas. Preferably for forever, but as long as possible works too. But it's not possible, and that already sucks enough as it is. If he's going to wind up alone anyway, why not spare them both the inevitable heartache and pull that band-aid off now?
Cas winces, just barely. With it, he breathes out, meditative and zen-like. "I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You were just trying to..." He tilts his head when he seems to realize he doesn't actually know what Dean's angle is here. The look on his face turns skeptical. "What, exactly, are you doing?"
He'll just... stand here, then. With his hands in his pockets, because that's casual and casual is what he's going for since 'invisible' isn't an option.
Cas gently sets his bag near the door. He takes his time taking in the decor, which, Dean had noticed, is also big on the beach theme. There are nets hung decoratively on the wall and all the lamps in the room are shaped like anchors.
Without saying a word, Sam facially communicates that Dean's intentionally being an asshole and as co-proprietor of a fledgling and struggling business, they want to ensure their customer's happiness, not sabotage it. Also, stop pulling Cas's pigtails and ask him out already.
Cas looks annoyed. Cas also looks thoroughly debauched, his lips already turning red and his mouth messy with saliva. "You love me," he says to Dean, like a reminder that's borderline an accusation. "Well, I love you too."
“You don’t sit this close,” he tells Cas, with a one-handed sweep at the lack of space between their bodies. “Especially not to other guys.”
And Dean, with his eyes locked on Cas and Cas' locked right back on his, both of them numb to everything else, knows the feeling exactly.
Cas lets the moment sit there. And sit there. It stretches on and on while they hold eye contact, until Dean almost blurts, "ALRIGHT, LET'S DO THIS GAY THING" just to quiet the loud, unnerving thrum in his head that feels a lot like an admission, but then:
Dean makes a noise that resembles good-natured complaining, but he clicks away from the canned laughter of yet another show starring a man bickering with another man to the channel Cas had asked for.
"Hungry?" Dean asks him. He's making his world famous peanut butter cheeseburger, which is a goddamn culinary delight. Not that he gets many people to trust him enough to try it. It's Sam's favorite, though, and has been since the kid was old enough to appreciate a decent meal. It's one of Dean's early what's-in-the-pantry creations that passed the taste test and stuck.
Drawn in by the emotion in Cas' outburst, Dean takes a couple steps inside Cas' room. It's the first time he's done more than just sneak a peek on his way to the toilet. "Would've what?"
Sam stabs at his salad, wielding a forkful of it that he uses to poke at the air and emphasis his point.
"Hey, so, I invited Jess over," Sam brings up while they're in the car, the mall many'a mile behind them.
He expects to be instantaneously smoted the second he reaches him, especially because the first thing he does is haul Cas into a hug so enthusiastically given, Cas lets out a grunt when the air's knocked clean out of him.
Cas' voice is as tight as Dean's is. "Like you're the only one," he says. Accuses, actually. "I told you, I said how many months ago now that I was afraid--"
It gets the loudest reaction out of Sam yet. Even Cas, when Dean looks over at him, is into it, his face tipped towards the sky.
From the other side of the bed, Cas stares at him in actual, legitimate contemplation, which, given their history, is fair enough. "No?" he eventually decides, squinting.
"Castiel," she says, hissing it out, but the craziest thing is how she doesn't sound shocked to see Dean; she sounds pretty damn clued in actually, like she knows exactly what's going on out here.
In the stretched out seconds that follow, it's dead silent, other than a mattress jingle on the radio.
Dean snorted, running a handful of water over his face. First time he did that, he half-expected his skin to melt off. Now it was a godsend. "Yeah? Tell that to your thorny Meg love."
He doesn't leave the bed. He doesn't even get up. He stays on his back and stares at the ceiling, but there's a clear divide between them now.
Whereas Sam's eyes were narrowed before with worry, now he looks downright spooked. "Dean. It's me." He goes to take a step forward, still some three feet of distance between them, but when Dean jerks back, tense and skittish, he holds his hands up higher instead to show Dean he doesn't mean any harm. "Look. It's just me. No weapons. Okay?"
That's a weird conclusion to jump to. They've done some combat training, the two of them, but Cas without his powers is a less indomitable force, there's no getting around that. It rattles him a little. "I'm not."
Probably he shouldn't have said that, because it just awakens the big brother part of Dean that wants to good-naturedly bully his little brother around. He swats at Sam's gigantor head, pushing him away by the heel of his hand.
And his bed, which he made earlier like he’s the type of person who does that. There’s a slight dent where he normally lies.
Cas smiles, small and sincere. "Nothing." Abruptly he stands, moment over, all humor gone. "Come with me."
Getting a grip, Dean says, "Name?" as indifferent as possible, even though there's no one else around yet, and even if the place were packed, Dean knows his usual customers. He never has to ask who's drinking what, let alone who he's making it for.
. The makeups and breakups, the moon-eyes, the—the 'profound bond,'” he imitates gruffly, and Dean pulls his hand out of Cas's, not liking the turn this has taken.
Somehow in the middle of Dean's sappy spilling of his guts, Cas closed the distance between them so that now he's in front of Dean with a hand on his shoulder, an expression on his face that's as honest and pained as Dean's own.
"Them tablets--" is as far as Dean gets into that before Sam's practically flapping annoyed limbs in his face, like Dean's got only a few working brain cells left and even those are too stupid to live.
"Pie," Dean acknowledges in a praising, worshipful manner. There are practically cartoon forks appearing in his eyes. "You brought me pie."
The love he feels now, though, that's not family-love. It's not the same thing he feels for Bobby or Sam, that's for damn certain.
Cas's outfit wasn't the only thing that changed; Cas the human was virtually a whole new entity to learn and know.
Dean laughs lowly and freely, the sound spilling out of him from the back of his throat. "That my nerdy best friend's a giant horn dog--"
He was rising to get up and help Cas, but Cas was already collapsing like dead weight onto the couch beside him. He shoved the beer at Dean and ordered, "Drink."
"Yeah, well, what can I say. The second you broke out the Macarena, I was glued to the spot." He slaps Sam across the arm. "Didn't know you had it in you, Footloose."
. Jesus. He'd tell him to keep it in his pants, but most likely that'd get Sam insinuating things about Dean's own desires that are stupid and wrong, so.
The shower's one of the nicer ones he's seen in a motel before, but he still makes quick use of it, out in under five minutes. Cas had beat him to it, too, and even though he was in the thing for a solid fifteen minutes, the water's still plenty scolding by the time Dean has his turn. Not a lot of shampoo left, though.
Dean shoves that back into the space he got it and pretends he has no idea what Cas is talking about.
Dean drops forward, his face lined up with Cas'. They're an inch apart like that, maybe two, and Cas' eyes flick from Dean's down to Dean's mouth. All the times he's caught Cas staring before, who the hell knew it could lead them to this. He curls a hand around the back of Cas' head, guiding him closer, and the sheet on the bed drags toward the middle from Cas' tightening grasp.
Still, Cas' eyes scan the length of Dean's body, and Dean knows the reason for their sudden darkness is 100% him. Cas' voice, when he speaks, is as much blatant desire as it is genuine curiosity. "What were you... doing, Dean?" he asks him.
Sam scoffs, saying, "But it's so boring here! I'm leaving as soon as I get into Stanford. That's where I'm going, I already know," he gloats.
Before he can make his way out, Cas's door opens on its own. At least, that is his thinking until Dean appears with a halo of florescent yellow light behind him, smiling wide. Which seems to lead to a joke, because he cracks, "This makes you the girl, you know."
Cas levels him with a stare that, faltering mojo or not, could wipe out a few city blocks. “What, so I only learned basic skills once
“Absolu—” He smacks into the doorframe. The cabinet beside it jostles. Something inside falls over. That’s cool. “I’m awesome.”
Then Dean rocks forward and Cas moves with him, gripping back. As soon as his hands fist in the fabric of Dean's shirt, Dean sags against him, holding him even closer.
"Just." All the wind knocks out of his cute self-righteous sails because this is a conversation he's not going to ever, ever win. "Promise me you'll at least call when you're being arrested for solicitation."
Cas sags against the door, his face crumpling for just a second. Cas is not a crier, so the fact that he's on the verge of it now immediately raises some flags. Dean feels his own emotions dip south like they're tethered together, the two of them.
"No," Dean says, adamant. That's to Sam, who's holding a towel out to Dean with this look on his face like Dean's a rescue mutt newly brought home from the pound and now that they've got the obligatory familiarizing time over, it's time for him to settle in.
Sam, being a shrimp back then, was an easy target, sensitive and moody as he was. It didn't help that he had the sort of 'David vs. Goliath' complex that meant he wasn't afraid of anyone older, taller, or bigger than him. He was also a pacifist, which meant his problems became Dean's problems.
Yeah she was loyal, and he actually felt like a dick, however, she was an attention freak. Why he only noticed now, he didn’t know. He tried to be as nice as possible when he said, “Lisa, I just don’t feel attracted to you anymore. I don’t want to waste your time.”
There was the sound of an almost quiet engine entering the parking area, before being turned off. Ellen peered through the window, “Our accountant has arrived. Always way before opening hours!”
He had spoken to the Wolf Council’s well renowned therapist, Missouri Moseley, but, all she says is ‘
When Cas had his fill, he lifted his head and surprisingly buried his snout into the underside of his furry black neck. His heart skipped a beat (or several beats) as he heard Cas inhale the scents on his neck, rubbing his head and snout into
Dean cupped Cas cheeks in both his palms, bringing the omegas head down to meet his lips in a quick wet kiss. The alpha met his omegas eyes, “I do, Cas. I seriously can’t be away from you any longer.”
His eyes widened when he saw Dean pull Anna down and connect his lips to hers in a passionate, deep kiss.
He held out a crooked elbow, “Walk with me through the orchid gardens, my angel?”The smile that spread across the omegas lips was reflecting a hint of surprise and joy, those blue eyes peered at him like he was trying to see into his soul too.
Castiel was at least 150 years old. But, looked like he was in his 30’s. He was one of the best fighters in the coven-
Rufus cackled like a manic, while he, Dean and Castiel began laughing hard outside. It was a good few minutes before everyone calmed and that was when he heard the third alpha speak up in a completely uninterested voice- a woman alpha who had the temper of a fire breathing dragon, who could kick the shit out our any burly or masculine alpha in this damn state, “Ok you two! Zip it up! Ain’t got time for your old man issues!”
...He stopped in his tracks, thoughts swirling around the fact that he was going to be taking Cas to one of his favorite places to eat….
And he felt on top of the world because Bal would treat him with so much affection. It showed in his smile and eyes. He glowed.
“You are not my omega! Castiel is!” Dean honestly had the urge to stride over to the red head and slap her silly. Seriously, he never hit women nor omegas, but this wolf was getting on his nerves.
It was happy hour, and usually, music wasn’t played around this time. It was to allow people, particularly workers who had just knocked off, time to wind down in a quiet setting. This usually lasted till 11pm, before music was played- either from the jukebox, speakers or karaoke.
“Tell, me who is this omega that they have chosen to come live with us? And when is he or she moving in?”
He was embarrassed to even think that he had a crush on his brother’s boyfriend, Dean Winchester. Who wouldn’t, when the guy was a walking sex symbol; strutting around with that sneaky smirk and driving around in that sweet ride- a 1967 Chevy Impala.
John centered himself, before he said, “Boys, I need you to look at me, please. What I am going to say or clarify is very important.”
Gabe apparently had enough of his pessimism, folding his arms along his chest and snipping out, “First of all, Cassie, I have no quarrels with Dean- that’s all you! Secondly, Sam is a wonderful man, who happens to be a kickass lawyer, who moved here to open his law firm and at the same time practice law. Thirdly, I met Sam while I was volunteering at the library book sale last week. And lastly, Dean ain’t that bad once you get to know him! He’s just running a humble business, much like you are!” The man then added, “So, get that stick out of you’re ass, will you!” With that, Gabe stomped away into the kitchen.
Castiel shivered lightly when he felt Dean run a finger down the nape of his neck. He met the alphas green eyes over Gem’s head. The alpha smiled softly at him, mouthing an almost silent, “I’m sorry. He gets like this every evening before bedtime”.
Dean honestly felt like he was looking at the alpha before him much more clearly. Though, he was still skeptical and weary. Many alphas, that he’s come across, were very cruel. One thing that had him considering was the fact that instead of being dumped at the back of a holding unit in a van, he was sitting quite comfortably at the back seat of a twin cab. This alpha could have bound him in ropes or chains before driving him off to be sold. This alpha could had strangled him, punched him, kicked him, if he so much as looked at him and uttered a word. But, this alpha didn’t.
“Yes he does need you son, but, not at this moment. Give him room to breathe.” His dad eyed him with renewed seriousness, “Take a seat, son. We need to talk.”
The sight that greeted Dean was expected but heart aching. Castiel was slumped on the sofa, quietly staring at the wall before him with glassy eyes. Dean knew that his sweet mate had probably just finished crying before he got lost in his mind once more. It was honestly worrisome for Dean, which is why the first thing he did this morning before leaving to pick Anna was contact Castiel’s therapist, Missouri Moseley. Castiel had agreed to another appointment tomorrow early morning.
Bobby got up from the dining table and clapped him one on the shoulder. The man said in between laughs, “It’s good to have that spit fire attitude back boy! This place needs it!”
Dean felt that this was escalating and not in a good way. This was definitely a catastrophe waiting to happen.
Castiel closed his eyes; his breathing increased when he felt the press of Dean’s bulge into his own hardened one. God the things Dean did to him. Castiel cupped his lovers scruffy cheek and met the lycans fully blown green pupils, “I would love to meet him, Dean”. His hand slipped down his lovers hard chest, down that perfectly sculptured abs, to finally grip his lovers protruding bulge. He massaged that perfectly hard bulge, panting out, “but after we take care of this baby”.
Dean shook his head, “Nah! Cas and I have spoken and we have decided to give it a few years before we have our first. I mean we’re still young, I have to graduate and find a decent job, Cas still has to complete high school and study something he wants to in college. As long as we’re together, everything will go smoothly.”
Dean was also a hot head nowadays, immediately slamming out, “She’s my girlfriend, Cas! I'm allowed to spend more time with her!”
He huffed, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have made you feel uncomfortable. I know that you probably wouldn’t want to date someone like me-.” He immediately shut up when Cas laid his hand atop his, that was on the table- squeezing his hand lightly.
Castiel thumbed the tear that escaped his husband’s eye. “Oh baby, I know this is hard, but we will get through this together. There’s no pressure, we just need time to heal proper”.
Cas was silent for a while, before the omega released a full on smile- teeth and all, surprising him by jumping into his arms. “Dean! I missed you!”
Gabriel smiled into his big brother’s shoulder. He loved Castiel’s warm hugs. It always felt trusting and comforting. He hummed, “ok big brother”.
He showered well and was completely dead to the world, for the next couple of days. He was only woken up by his smiling mom to get him to eat and drink something before he was out like a light once more.
, princess! But, you also need to be reminded of the rules whilst living under mom and dad’s roof.” He saw Cas shift his focus to stare at a spot on his neck, the nervous swallow followed.
John grit his teeth, squaring his shoulders- facing the challenge of another alpha. “I gave you advice that was part and parcel of being in this pack, Dean!”
. He rubbed at his chin, “very well Dean. If this vampire is your choice then so be it. I want you to bring him over to the lair tomorrow”.
Well, red eyes were one that signified an alpha. He pictured that these soft eyed alphas wouldn’t be capable of causing harm. Well. Alphas were unpredictable, so he wasn’t going to rule their natural instinct for brutality out.
He felt his hackles rise, his alpha was on edge. There was a musky earthy scent mixed into Cas scent-
In the tent of the alpha leader Dean, he waited with a beating heart, wondering when the green eyed alpha would come in, drunk off his ass and demand he strip and present like a good omega would. The alpha would take him, not so gentle at times, till the wolf came hard, howling and filling his womb with thick cum.
“What!?” He blurted, still in shock. Before, he changed his tune and asked, “Really?” His heart was pounding so hard, he could hear it drumming in his ears.
Castiel had had enough of Anna. He replied sharply, yanking her hair a little harder, “No Dean! I am tired of her trying to ruin my life!” He glared at a terrified Anna, “I told you that if you stepped out of line, I would throw you into the basement!” Cas kicked open the basement door and walked down the stairs with a frantic Anna. He tossed her onto the bed they kept in the basement, “now, you stay here! From tomorrow, you will eat here, you will use the basement bathroom, and you will only be out for a few hours to see the light of day….SUPERVISED!”
When they got out of the hug, he apologized, “Sorry Bobby. I had some settling in to do, before I got to meeting anyone. I did meet Sam a few days back and we’re having dinner with the parents tonight. You and Ellen are welcome to join us”.
The alpha took in an audible great whiff of scent, he could hear how the alpha sniffed. The alpha hummed in delight,
Mary clasped her heart, “Oh sweetheart, I am sure you will find him or her someday. Have hope and faith.”
Cas eyed him with those disappointed omega blue eyes. And damn, did that want to make the alpha wolf inside him whine in shame. Again, it was a mystery the effect Cas had on him- even in human form. The omega threw out an unimpressed huff and leaped off the bed, pointedly ignoring him with his white fluffy tail in the air and furry back to him. The little omega stubbornly padded out his bedroom, definitely shutting out his calls.
Firstly, Dean was a heart stopper. The alpha was a dream boat. He was 6 foot tall, had sandy blonde hair (Ivy league cut), had light dusting of freckles on the bridge of his nose, grass green eyes, nicely trimmed beard, thick lashes and pouty lips that could make any girl jealous. The man projected the vibes of simplicity; dressed in a red and white checkered flannel whose sleeves were folded up to elbow and unbuttoned along the torso, a black t-shirt underneath flannel, a nice dark blue pair of jeans that wasn’t on the side of too tight and brown boots. Castiel couldn’t control the blush that crept up his cheeks and the race of his heart as the alpha smiled so handsomely at him.
When he parked just outside he and Cas home, he ordered Anna, “stay here until I come get you!”. He ignored Anna’s sour look and got out the truck. He hurriedly made his way over to the house- he wanted to make sure his lover was psyched and forewarned about Anna’s arrival.
Castiel had Dean pinned up against the wall, by the lapels of the man’s leather jacket. The death dealer sneered, “you lied to me about your father not accepting our love! HOW COULD YOU, DEAN!”
Dean’s eyes diverted to his lap, voice sounding almost croaky as he replied, “Yeah Cas.” The alpha took some time before he aimed his glassy eyes at Cas, slapping on a small smile that looked forced, trying to sound cheerful as he said, “But, cuddles and hugs are still something we can do! That’s awesome….right Cas!? No harm done!”
He spoke through his silent tears, “Guess its just me and you, huh? As always.” He sniffled (in complete sadness) and stood up from his spot in the grass, dusting his jeans down, before he spared one last glance at the Annual Meet. He whispered, “Till next year.”
“Don’t you get it Cas? I don’t think I can control my urges towards you! And I sure as hell won’t do things with you because you’re still a child! So it’s best I just stay away for both our sakes!”
He looked to see one of the servants assigned to him by Dean sitting nearby, her name was Pam. She smiled at him as he sat up slowly, body still aching. He asked, “You dressed me and brought me food?”
He went bursting through the front door, calling out, “Dean!” He could smell bacon, eggs, and pancakes wafting from the kitchen. As he neared, he heard the laughter of family.
Anna this time targeted the distracted alpha. “Prince Dean! Tell him to return to sleep!” Her voice was sharp and impatient. It was irritating, however, it was enough to get Dean snapping back to reality.
Those words bought a flutter to his heart and he didn’t have it in him to scold Dean for calling him ‘little omega’. Mostly, because he missed Dean calling him that.
He didn’t miss how Castiel’s mouth thinned into a straight line, eyes narrowed and scanning him as if he were something foul. The little omega folded his arms along his chest, spitting out, “So, I suppose you’re coming to tell me that you’re leaving now. As usual, after a great night with Anna!” Castiel then tapped his lips and mockingly voicing out, “Hmm, oh yeah. And probably coming to give me another ‘
Castiel scratched down Dean’s perfect back, egging Dean into a faster, more punishing pace. Both sinking their long fanged teeth into any parts of each others bodies they could reach. Bloodied lips meeting in a hot and addictive tongue filled kiss.
He felt like his heart had just been ripped out of his chest and stomped on. However, it was nothing he hadn’t expected….
Of course, his attention was torn away from the blue jay, as Bal sucked on a particular pleasure spot on his neck, right under his ear, while thumbing at his hardened left nipple. The feel of the alphas hard cock brushing alongside his was the best feeling ever.
There were cabins set up under the massive trees, each held a chimney. There were flowerbeds, footpaths, and assorted fruit trees here and there. And the most heartwarming sight of all was the sight of little pups, in their black wolf forms yipping here and there, playing around, scuffling, while their very human formed parents, in clothes, watched on in hearty laughter.
He was spending more time alone now. He was spending more time with Sam. This only resulted in him getting more cranky with Dean.
His anger once again overcame him, and next he knew, he was stomping out his café towards Dean’s café.
And, the way the man had gone out of his way to cook him one of his ‘favorite’ meals, plus, bake him the added bonus of apple pie- completely made him fall so….in love.
Cas face scrunched up in disbelief, “I can’t believe I haven’t come here before! Christ, I’m such a recluse!”
Oh how his heart did another flip. How could Cas be such a loving and caring omega after the crap he had threw at him? He rubbed Cas’ back in such gentleness, murmuring into the omegas sleep ruffled hair, “I’m ok Cas, I promise.” He then pulled out of the hug, to search the omegas face, smiling shakily at the teary blue eyed omega- feeling his heart break a little at the sight. He thumbed at the escaped tear from Cas right eye, “We need to talk, Cas.”
“NO!” Sam struggled to fight off the two bulkier alphas that had a hold on each of his biceps. He was only 16, considerably skinny and definitely weaker than his grandfathers bodyguards. He felt tears pool in his eyes as he watched his now drugged and limp big brother being heaved up and carried in a fireman’s position. His 25 year old brother looked so small and frail-
Dean kissed the top of Cas head, murmuring into the dark hair of his mates, “I think he’ll always watch over us in spirit, baby.”
Lisa screeched, tugging at her hair in frustration. “Fine!” Before she stomped away, she met Dean’s eyes, spitting out, “You’re a hopeless shit, Dean Winchester! That omega will be your downfall!” With those venomous parting words, she stomped off.
He ignored the alpha behind Cas looking here and there, looking as if he wanted to disappear. His eyes met Cas, for the first time his voice had lowered, with no hint of anger in it, “Yes, Cas. I’m a 21 year old virgin. Ok!”
Dean threw his covers off himself, getting out of his bed, and stretching his arms up to get the kinks out of his body. He replied, “you can go play in the gardens today, Cas. I’ve got to go do some alpha work with dad!”
“Mary”, He warned. It wouldn’t be nice to get their scents over someone else’s pup. It was something wolves kept sacred.
For instance, Dean would sometimes step into his personal space, scent his neck, run those fingers down his cheeks and smile at him like he hung the moon. Then, there was that one time, when Cas was 14 and Dean almost kissed him. Well almost, but, snapped out of it in the last minute when the alpha heard
No way was he going to let the heartlessness of one pathetic pack alpha ruin the happiness and love of his children- no matter who they choose to be with. His eyes were soft as he met his youngest son’s fearful hazel eyes, placing a hand on his sons and squeezing lightly, “Listen here, Sammy. I know that it’s a lot to take in and I’m sorry it has come to this. Maybe, Gabe deserves to know the truth about his father and I’ll leave that for you to decide, but, at the same time, both of you need to be careful.” Sam nodded his head, so he continued, “You also need to limit your time spent at Gabe’s for both your sakes. Lay low and off the radar until everything mulls over and Lucifer gets his comeuppance. Is this understood, son?”
He stood there, hope dwindling, the longer Cas didn’t respond. Nevertheless, he felt persistent and determined. He was just about to deliver another series of knocks, when a voice resonated through his head
All this was too much; the moans of ecstasy, the trembling omega body, the wave after wave of delicious sex juices he swallowed, the choking of the omega around his cock, the feel of his cockhead sliding down the omegas throat. The alpha finally threw his head back, dislodging his mouth from the omegas flexing hole, for the first time in this session,  and roaring out into the air as his cock finally gave, spurting cum after cum after cum down his omegas throat.
He gasped, “Sweet Marge has visited Dean’s café!” Marge was their oldest café patron, in fact, the oldest, sweetest, old lady in Harmony, aged 80. He whined, “Oh Gabe. This is not good!”
. The last home cooked meal he had had was at his parents place for dinner- and damn was it heavenly. “There’s just something amazing about home cooked meals”.
He was going to meet Dean again today, as the man will return his contract. He is hoping that all is well with the work conditions and requirements. He really didn’t want to be dealing with a dissatisfied Dean today.
Castiel pulled his baby brother into a hug, rubbing circles into the Novak omegas back. “I promise you will meet him when he is ready”.
. The least the council could do is to bring Anna home. He growled when he watched Anna hugging one of the council members-
He felt suffocated and cornered. It was made worse when John, Mary and Sam’s voices joined in, they were calling out for Dean and Gabriel.
He sat down on a stool by the kitchen counter, watching momma reach out for the necessaries to make pancakes. She still looked worried though and in a different headspace. So, he asked as tenderly as he could, “Momma, what’s happening to Dean?”
Mary resisted the urge to smile hard. It seemed that John did to, rubbing at his mouth and chin, to cover up that smile that was threatening to spill out. Castiel had
Honestly, it’s like Balthazar had swooshed in and swept him off his feet. Which he never thought would happen-
Then, Cas stepped out of his arms and rubbed a hand on his chest, “You are a good man, Dean Winchester”.
He murmured right next to the man’s ear, “Now, I want you to hit the solid number 6 ball that’s very close to the pocket, in the right hand corner. However, you have to alternate your focus from the cue ball, to the ball you want to knock in. Like you’re calculating its direction of travel”. Of course, he was the one to take aim, as he was guiding Cas. He added, “Now, you’ll feel it in you, just how much power you need to hit the white cue ball with, in order for it to hit its target. Feel it in your arms”. He guided the stick back and took the hit. The cue ball hit the number 6 ball, sinking it into the pocket.
Never in his life had he felt more scared than at that present moment in time. Never in his life had he been so confused and betrayed. Never in his life had he ever dreamed Jimmy would take this road.
His tears streamed down his cheeks, freely because no one could see. His heart ached and there was an empty feeling brewing in his chest- much more worse than when he had to reject his beloved mate 10 years ago.
He leaned in and laid another peck on Dean’s lips, before grabbing the man by the crook of his arm, “Come on handsome. Let’s have some dinner.”
Castiel’s smile only grew wider, “You smell like cocoa butter, Dean. So soothing, so heavenly and so calming to the soul”. He loved the way the omega started blushing and smiling shyly. My God, this omega had two dimples just to both corners of his top lip.
Dean finally met his eyes, a twinkle in those green orbs as he replied, “Yes I do, Cas. And, she has a name”.
He nodded, “I know baby. Let’s just work on what’s ahead of us -for now, which is you leaving because I’m sure the trackers will be here soon".
Castiel felt enraged by Dean’s words. He couldn’t help it. His omega wolf was severely heartbroken and disappointed by its alpha,
the act and tell me the truth. God damnit!” He was breathing heavily, staring daggers at Dean- his omega wolf threatening to burst free, out of its human confines.
Chuck used Castiel’s hesitancy to mock the omega, “See, nothing but lies coming from both these two omegas mouths. Castiel and Gabriel are both liars!”
Just his omegas way of course with a few restrictions from him, the alpha. “I will respect my omegas every decision Anna. Of course, with a few limitations that I will discuss in private with my omega”. Dean added with a sigh as Anna's face soured more, “Anna, you have found your true mate. You have told me that he is a humble alpha who wants to someday mate you. I think that you need to focus on him now and Cas and I will continue with our lives".
When Dean finally finds his words, his voice is rough, hollow. "She was a real dick" he concedes, and it makes Cas huff out a surprised breath of laughter. The argument drains out of them both as quick as it came, and Cas, now that he's not all righteously fired up, looks worse than ever. "Come on," Dean tells him, "get back in bed."
"I don't have a 'thing' for Sam," Jo insists tightly. "He's like a brother to me. You know how gross that would be?"
Dean chuffs out a humorless laugh. He closes his eyes, squeezing the bridge of his nose. "I'm not talking about this with you."
Cas joins him in the shower and blows him so hard, and for so long, they have to rinse off in freezing cold water.
They hit the city limits. There's a dingy 'Welcome To' sign. Three minutes and a bunch of fast food joints later, they're already drifting past those places of business their couples had disappeared from. The Stripe, The Lunch Box, and Swanky's, which, in the middle of the day, all look completely dead.
Whatever he should have said, that wasn't it. Dean was expecting Cas to get furious, but instead he just looked like he'd been punched. Worse, like Dean was the one who did the punching, like the blow couldn't haven't been more personal.
"Knock it off," Dean complains, quick to get defensive. He's only two beers in, but the knowing, honest-to-god sparkle in Sam's eyes makes his stomach feel a lot fuller.
"This guy, at Sam's party," Dean begins, purposely toneless. If he delivers it like it was no big deal, which it wasn't, but still. If he plays it cool maybe they'll actually move on quickly. "He gave me his number. Whatever. And the dude looks nothing like Harrison Ford, so knock it off."
It feels like he's picking between Sam and Cas here, but he's not. If he's being honest with himself, Sam has always been his obligation; Cas, though, has always been his choice.
Dean calls Sam before they peel out, tells him to use a burner phone and report the address to the police.
Dean ignores the look and smiles real big at Amelia, who is dropping full sacks of groceries onto the table. "Hiya, Amelia," he says, doing so only to rattle Sam. And if he hears the word
Cas scowls, but it's a piss poor attempt to hide his own smile, which is tugging the corners of his mouth upwards.
. "Gabriel and I both, actually. We're visiting family before the holidays." Absolutely no. Nuh-uh. "And normally I'd take Tolk with me." For real, why's its eyes gotta hold so much evil in it? Looking like all it cares about is chomping someone's fingers off. "But I'd rather not disrupt her from her routine, not when we're both so newly into... Dean?"
Dean flops back onto his mattress and drags a hand over his eyes until the world blacks out. He can feel the nausea creep up his throat, drying out his mouth, stomach acid clinging on sourly.
Cas leans in closer. His eyes flair in conspiratorial comradery. "Am I allowed to watch, or is this a guarded family secret?"
"Thanks," he accepts it, popping off the twist cap. He downs several mouthfuls in one long go, feeling the tension loosen inside of him almost immediately like some sort of Pavlovian response to alcohol. "God, I needed that."
It got way more intense when Dean lifted his head and found Cas staring right at him. It went from basic, mindless rutting to some seriously sappy-eyed lovemaking.
It must be the wrong thing to say. Or maybe Dean senses the lie behind it, so often deceiving others with it himself.
He gets to his feet, sliding his phone in his pocket. Now that he knows freedom is nigh, his mood climbs right back up. He meets Sam halfway.
It doesn't help that Dean finds Cas's cluelessness adorable. That's a word he's using now. He's just gonna have to deal with it.
After a long moment of steadying each other, they pull apart. Dean keeps a hand on Cas's shoulder, unwilling to let go, to give up the solidity that proves he's here.
Dean backs away from the window as those two get closer. He's taking a sip of his beer when the front door opens and Sam comes pushing through, sans knock. Their eyes meet, something uncomfortable passing between them. That fight they had, likely.
And, okay, Cas said he was attracted to Dean, but who cares, he probably meant it in a generic 'Dean is classically handsome' kind of way. Nothing personal.
"Yes." There's a sound like he's put a hand over the speaker and is talking to someone else. Obviously he's not alone. He's probably sitting around the dining table, cutting into some turkey, the whole happy family gathered.
"Like, have beef with me," Hank carries on. "That's totally cool. Sorry you're so mad at life, bro, but I get it. Man is evil. But what did those little guys ever do?" Again with the flamingos. Dean feels his patience running thin.
That is a gentle admission. Like Sam already knows Dean's going to take the news badly. And of course he is, because what the hell?
When he gets out, warm, wet air escaping with him, Cas has already claimed dibs on one side of the bed. He's comfortably laid out atop the covers, propped up by a mountain of pillows against the headboard so he can watch, from the sound of it, an infomercial that promises to sculpt abs. Dean's just glad it's not porn. Because, awkward.
is what's doing it for him. He is painfully, shamefully hard, and all because Cas is wiggling around on top of him.
Dean can already sense the head quirk, the confused squint. From Cas' angle, it must look like Dean's beating up on the staircase. And losing.
"What?" Cas asks, noticing. He's doing the head tilt thing, though it's lost some of its charm now that there isn't any of that otherworldly innocence to back it up anymore. Dean never really thought he'd ever miss that alien-type naivety Cas seemed to wear like a second skin, but then again, Dean wasn't really prepared for a lot of this stuff, was he?
He pushes to his feet, swiping his hands together. "On second thought, I got tired of lookin' at your mug days ago. Go, I'll... okay, I don't know what I'll do, but who cares, I'm in the future, right? I'll make my own fun."
Cas tips his head back in frustration. Dean knows this is killing him because his dick's bobbing real pissed off in front of him, teased and untouched. Dean wants to touch it. Fuck, he wants to.
"What do you mean, you'll be back?" He's laughing some because this right here? This is crazy talk out of Cas.
Dean's head snaps up, looking for Cas', but Cas carries on like everything's normal, like that wasn't just a bomb dropped on Dean's brain. Sam comes strolling back into the room with a glass of water, which he offers to Dean, and Dean takes it, still staring, still grappling.
He refuses to say it again. His stomach falls back down where it belongs, lighting up his nerves along the way.
The springs in Cas's chair creak when he leans back, but somehow he makes it seem less accidental and more on purpose.
For a while they kiss like that, tightly pressed together, taking turns rocking their hips into each other, sloppy and impatient, and Dean keeps waiting for the this-is-wrong moment to hit, but it never comes.
Cas' gaze hones in on his and locks him in a strong hold. Dean has to swallow past a sudden tightness in his throat, Purgatory heavy on his mind with no real reason for it to be. "Yeah, well. You know me. Why travel when you can time travel."
Sam's doing something that is almost like smiling, peacefully so, and Cas is staring holes into the side of his face still, and Dean feels like -- well, like he's been zapped into the freaking Twilight Zone, which, as it turns out, is pretty much his actual life right now.
"Yeah, Dean, if you want," Sam answers back tiredly. Surprise, surprise, Dean's a dick. A little more meaningfully, he says, "I'm sorry about Lisa."
There's a shimmer, and then he's gone and Cas is left alone, still very much in a cornfield in the middle of night. He looks out at the endless rows of vegetation and feels lost, and then looks up at the stars and finds himself even more adrift.
Dean hurries around them, scowling -- at them and everything else. He can't escape the smell of vanilla, not to mention, holy soccer moms. This mall some kind of breeding ground of bad? By the time he makes it to the food court he wants nothing to do with the long lines of yet more prepubescent girls, so he hunkers down in a booth the way many men before him have barricaded themselves in trenches, and waits it out.
"Hey, I heard you were back," she tells him, swiping her hands down her pants. She starts reaching into the bags and pulling stuff out. "Actually, no. Frankenmoose here came home last night in one helluva prickly mood, so I kinda put two and two together."
Dean finally meets Cas' eyes, hard as that even is for him. He bats at Cas' nearby knee, playfully hitting it with the back of his hand. It's an attempt at levity that utterly crashes and burns. "Cas, come on."
And Cas is tangled up behind him, so close that pure, good old-fashioned self-preservation is the only thing keeping Dean believing that’s the lighter in Cas's pocket he feels nudged against his left ass cheek. A very big lighter.
The day of the wedding, the one Sam dragged him to, him and Lisa got into their biggest blowout yet. All because the lease on her apartment is coming up and amid her 'do I renew or do I level up?' conundrum she threw 'moving in together' as an option to consider. Which, even now, sends Dean's pulse racing like he's some commitmentphobe heading for the hills. It's not that. Not just that. There's Sam to consider, too.
He hears Sam chuckling, telling Cas, "Dude, I can't believe you did that. Nice," with a lot of appreciation, like he's actually been impressed.
Business sure ain't booming, but it's steady enough that a lot of the tables are taken. People seem to be heading in and out of the bookshop regularly. No sign of floppy bunny ears, or Castiel, in sight, though.
Cas showed up at the Men of Letters bunker one morning looking like one of those scraggly-bearded douchebags that gets themselves dropped into the wilderness for a week of survival and reality TV fame.
"Dean's been acting similarly all day," Cas, the traitorous bastard, throws in. "I assumed a head injury was to blame."
"I disliked her," Cas confesses along the way. It's right against his ear, which makes Dean realize they're still holding hands, and okay, yeah, fake married, but no. So much no.
"Hey, hey," Dean barks, free hand out in the air, his beer in serious danger of being wasted by way of spill. "I heard you the first time,
"About being one of the men in black," Dean agrees. "Pulling out badges, showing up in a suit. Being a professional bad ass."
As per always, Cas offered Dean his second slice of toast. When their fingers touched, Dean dropped the bread, panic laughed, and then fled, all the while claiming bowel trouble and a forgotten load of laundry that needed some urgent tending to.
Cas took a step forward. Benny wasn't used to Cas and his frequent memory lapses when it came to not invading one's space, so his eyebrows lifted high when he had an angel up in his face all of a sudden. "If you lay even a single finger on Dean--"
The last time they talked about Chuck they were twelve and Dean had thought the best way to cheer Cas up, the only way, was to repress any and all emotions and talk about Star Trek instead. As real men do. He weighs a similar urge now, only his new method of distraction has since evolved to involve the removing of clothing rather than the detailed ranking of best/worst episodes, but one long look at Cas tells Dean this is something Cas needs to vent about. Or, at the very least, not be encouraged to burrow way down like Dean tends to do.
Cas looks up and then over, straight into Dean's eyes, heavy with an anguished gratitude. For a while Dean holds his stare and offers back nothing but support.
"Yeah, obviously, Dean. I'm hydrated," he says, like it's such a hardship to be looked after. Abruptly, things get muffled and Dean hears Sam's voice as if it's coming at him through a tin can.
"Why did you have to fight with him? He's my friend too!" Sam bursts up from the couch. Dean tries to stop him, but Sam wiggles out of his grasp, his whole chest heaving from the weight of his emotions.
Later, when they're parked in what might as well be the location of an opening scene to any number of generic horror movies -- it's a gravel parking lot at the edge of a forest-lined lake, and they are the only people around at a time TV tells him is called 'dusk' -- Cas is wedged up against Dean in the front seat, so close he is forcing the tops of Dean's thighs into the steering wheel. That rush of want and need and lust is back, only more somehow; bigger.
"So, crazy thing," Gabriel says out of nowhere, and it's to him, which catches Dean in surprise. "I sexually harass via spot-on foam dick art the very same dude my baby bro texts me not two seconds afterward to say he's already claimed dibs on."
They raid the mini fridge for breakfast. Its shelves are stocked with things like chocolate and whip cream, and Dean tries not to think too hard about why, going for the plastic cups of fruit.
It's hilarious, right? Dean smiles over it for a solid minute, and never once does he think it's strange that he's getting selfies from some dude. Cas, while out on a morning jog, saw that sign, took the picture, and had the thought to send it to Dean. That's his new normal.
"What do you want me to say?" Sam whines, scrubbing a hand down his face to express his own frustration. "I'm sorry I have a life here. I'm sorry I have friends."
Dean's biting into his burger just as he gets the text. When he reads it, he snorts, and that makes Sam, who wound up unable resist the pb-cheeseburger, raise his eyebrows in a silent 'what's up?' from across the table.
"Hey, you shut your trap." Sam holds back an eye-roll, but only just barely, while Dean hones in on the important stuff. "What do you mean there's a case? Where?"
, Dean would risk it, Cas would be with them, but instead he's bound by this self-sacrificing need to keep Sam safe, even when it costs him—
It'd been three days. Three days since the makeout that wasn't, and Dean and Cas weren't falling into place like normal. Instead Cas kept his distance, and when they spoke he never said more than he had to, and it wasn't like Dean was keeping a diary or anything, but they weren't even hanging out casually anymore.
"Cas, you're sick," he reminds him gently, half-hoping it'll be the thing that gets them both to stop. "Can you even think straight right now?" He pulls back and holds up three fingers. "How many?"
"Got any beer back there?" Dean asks, half-joking, but the woman ducks into a refrigerated section and looks at him expectantly. "Corona's good," he says, friendly.
Sure enough, Cas knocks his forehead into Dean's shoulder. "Go back to sleep, Dean," he says, low and throaty.
Dean settles back against the kitchen counter, thumbing the wet neck of the beer bottle he's been nursing. "Man. Feel the love in this room."
Sam smiles a little at that. All fond and—well, mocking, mostly, like Dean's some monkey at the zoo that picked up fingerpainting for the first time. That smile turns dark and mischievous, and Dean's immediately on the defense.
Dean pulls away like he's been zapped. He can't hear over the white noise in his ears, he might be the world's youngest person to be having a stroke, and he's pretty sure Cas has caught wind of Dean's feelings and thinks he's some kinda pervy sex predator now, so Dean's gotta go drown himself.
“—eannnn, helloooo,” Dean's words turn into. He easily makes the switch from busting Cas, to Stepford ankle-grabber.
Sam sighs real prissily. He squeezes his eyes shut and squeezes the bridge of his nose and looks, to Dean, like he's mentally talking himself down a tall ledge. "Because," he manages through his post-calming zen.
"Would you relax, man? I just met her. She seems pretty cool, though, right? Plus?" He glanced back, eyebrows wiggling. "Hot."
"Anyway," Cas goes on, eyeing Dean like there's a weird smell coming from his direction, "I only wanted to say hello. And to apologize for earlier. I wasn't eavesdropping, although it appeared that way."
Oh God! Now he remembered who these old wolves were. They were part of the corrupt Milton Wolf regime. If they were here then things could go bad for him.
He met Castiel’s smiling eyes behind his son’s shoulder, “You can also have a shower Cas, if you want.”
His eyes snapped over to Samuel’s, his own anger climbing in realization of what had been done to the poor omega. He grit out, “you burnt his mark off!”
, he could wish nothing bad upon Sam. The Winchester Omega was nothing but kind and welcoming to him.
The pup began suckling on one of the toes on his front paws. He found it ticklish, noticing that the pup didn’t have any puppy teeth yet. He shook his head,
It was silent for at least a few minutes, the air slightly tense as everyone took in the information presented. Eventually, it was Dean that broke the silence, saying, “What should we do, dad?”
’; then, he could only imagine how the man would make him feel, looking gorgeous- with his sex hair blowing in the wind- occupying ‘Baby’s’ front seat and eventually sitting opposite him at one of Jane’s tables- shy and smiling- while they enjoying lunch.
It was a few hours that their test results came back, Castiel was once more called into her clinic. The cocky beta winked at Cas and gave Dean a pat on his ass humming in approval, “Mhmm, still firm!” Of course this was completely platonic and Castiel knew that. The omega would only chuckle at the pairs friendly antics whilst Dean would roll his eyes at Pam.
Those were powerful words from his omega. Those words were enough to lighten up the aging eyes of Heather, Michael and all the other alphas.
But, his attention was focused on something else. And boy oh boy was his heart doing a somersault. That voice!
. He could tell, from the corner of his eyes, that Dean’s great alpha head was equally perked up- watching them in curiosity.
Yeah he knew exactly what his dad meant. Again, he had learned a lot of freaky information about how an alpha can relieve themselves during their first rut or if they do not have a mate. Sex toys. That’s what they called it.
Dean knew about the notorious image painted about forest wolves. It was a stain that refused to come out- a link to their barbaric past. He sat up straight on the edge of his mattress, “the past belongs in the past Dad. It’s time we live in the present and work towards building a peaceful future for both town and forest wolves”.
Castiel turned his head to glance at him with a soft smile, the omega nodded and said, “Yes, I do. In fact, I love bees.”
He couldn’t help the bubbling of happiness in his chest, meeting his baby brothers smiling hazel eyes, “Yeah Sammy. It’s falling into place.”
He admits that he is hurt that his alpha let him walk. For a second, he thought that his alpha would treat him differently from all the other female omegas, but no. Unlike Gabe, who rode on the same horse his alpha Sam mounted, clutching his alpha for support, resting his feet.
It took him an entire week and a half before his rut broke. He was exhausted, bone tired and completely drained of energy. During his rut, he only ate and drank very little, hence, after his rut, the results of his improper consumption of food began to take its toll on him.
Maybe, Dean will be…happy....about it? He didn’t want to lie to Dean, so he continued, “And, we were kissing a lot. You even kissed me a lot on the neck.” It was then, that he wished he hadn’t said anything, for when he took at Dean, he could see the alpha retract into that displeased headspace.
’. It was 8pm now- dinner went on longer than expected due to moms hearty conversations. Now, he and Sam’s phones were beeping with text messages from the guys, already in the pub.
He was only midway through the semester and his rut had already began. Usually, it took place during the end of the year, as temperatures were much colder and tolerable to cater for a rut. However, it would seem that he is an early bloomer.
However, he was grateful for one thing. Dean didn’t date anyone after Lisa. His omega would preen when he thought of the fact that Dean was probably doing this for him. It was a pleasant feeling to know that Dean considered him. Their relationship after the breakup with Lisa had been based mostly on comfort and care for each other. He always had Dean’s attention, whenever he sought the alpha out.
Nevertheless, he replied, “You too, Cas”. He walked out of the office, feeling much better than the last time he left.
“But, Dean, you know what this means! If Castiel doesn’t conceive within the year, then you will have no choice but to plant your pup in Anna's womb! Secondly, Anna still has to come live with you both as per order of the Council”.
He knew that he shouldn’t poke his nose anywhere it wasn’t wanted. He would only end up hurting himself if he did. But, it’s like he couldn't help himself whenever he knew that Dean was here. So, when prince Dean came visiting, he would sneak out of the shed that he and his parents occupied- in the middle of the night.
John wasn’t buying it. He squinted his eyes, “what sort of altercation Dean? And don't lie to me because I can smell it on you!”
It was too late to save Jimmy. The doctors said that he had probably taken the pills the previous night and blacked out to the world. He had been dead hours before Castiel found him.
He froze though when Mary turned to him and asked, “Where’s Balthazar, baby? Dad can drop him back now, if you’re done with your studies.”
To be honest, Castiel dreaded should things turn that way. He didn’t want Dean to be in Lucian’s position, helplessly watching him turn to ash under the heated rays of the sunlight. He pinched the bridge of his nose, “I still remember, Gabe. The stories still haunt me”. He turned to face Gabe with desperately searching eyes, “But, we love each other deeply, Gabe. We cannot separate. What should we do before this becomes ugly?”
Dean chuckled lightly and quickly pecked the omegas lips. He pulled his head away and thumbed the bottom of Cas lips, “Shh baby. We have to stop, or we will be ripping each other’s clothes off, soon”.
What a journey it has been and he was sure that there were more chapters to come. He looked forward to whatever came by he and Cas way. He had finally found his better half and deep inside, he knew this was true.
They were both touch sensitive now, seeking the feel of each other’s bodies. This time, a one time quick morning fuck wouldn’t do, because in a matter of minutes after separating, both were horny again. This time Dean fucked Castiel atop the bathroom sink counter. There was this feeling of not wanting to stop and to continue making sweet love till the ends of time. Dean and Castiel knotted once more, right there on the bathroom sink counter.
Dean pulled his fingers out of Cas leaking hole to grab at the now whining omegas waist. “Come on Baby. We need to get to our spot in the barn.”
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being patient with this fic and showing your constant support! You are my inspiration! Much ❤️
He felt slightly dizzy as the scent completely took over the air around him. A scent that made his heart pound in excitement and slight fear.
He heard Mary and Sam gasp beside him, yet, he brushed it off; instead feeling this overwhelming surge of protectiveness and worry fill him. Worry for his boys who had encountered these foreign white wolves. He quickly allowed his eyes to scan their unharmed and unmarred features-
It wasn’t long before Dean released his neck, licking at the mating bite. He felt at one with Cas. It was the best feeling ever, because now, Cas was his for life. Officially. So, he took a step back to peer into Cas blue eyes and all he saw was the love the omega had for him. He smiled,
“We’re not going to drink the night away, Castiel. Just, a few drinks and a place we can talk. Come on, it’ll be good”.
He had felt, seen and heard the want and need coming from the alpha. So, he was going to put his faith in Dean. He willed his omega in, sucking in a breath and smiling lightly, “Ok Dean. Soon.”
“This was the best first date I have ever experienced, Cas. It was perfect in all senses of the word.” He smiled into Cas shoulder, admitting, “I’m damn thrilled that I got to experience this amazing moment with my favorite person”. He shyly added, “And, hopefully…um-…I would get to experience another date to come, sometime in the near future?”
He chose to keep quiet as momma led him to the kitchen. From here, he could still hear Dean’s loud cries. He even picked up the words, “Dad. It’s burns so much. Oh my God!”
A man in a red checkered flannel and blue jeans looking drop damn hot behind the wheel of a sexy classic car.
. But, he knew that Cassie would never hurt him. He asked, “So, Dean Winchester, eldest son of John Winchester, huh?”
. He felt that nagging irritation begin to grow inside him, “And, how did you know about their five star rating, Gabe?”
Dean replied with a clap of his hand, “Ok”. The look of relief on Dean’s face had him feeling slightly relaxed, but, even more hopeless deep inside.
That’s when all hell broke loose and an epic war, that stemmed hundreds of years between Lycan joined by Werewolf vs. Vampires began.
Pam shook her head, “No master Castiel. Dean did.” The servant winked, “The alpha is quite fond of you, I must say.”
Damnit his heart was still trying to calm down from the little lesson, but, he couldn’t now. He also couldn’t help the joy he felt as a result of Cas excitement.
He padded over to his window and pulled his curtains to the side, immediately catching sight of a very good friend of his, sitting outside his window ledge.
This was all he ever wanted. He was feeling slightly nervous, nonetheless, he took a chance and spared Dean a glance. Those calm grass green eyes studying him with such softness, making him want to melt into a puddle of goo.
His family, the Novak Family, wasn’t so much appreciated in Lawrence. His father Chuck was an alpha with
He didn’t know why he was blurting out of the blue, “But, Sammy doesn’t like him very much.” That all earned surprised looks from Dean, Mary and John.
On impulse, he defiantly threw off his covers, sitting up and fixing his sister with a dark stare, “NO!”
Dean carefully walked towards his boyfriend. The lycan gently grabbed a hold of his lovers waist, pulling him into his chest, “I’m saying my dad wants to meet you baby”. He started running his lips up his vampire lovers neck, stopping to suck on the left earlobe before releasing it with a pop, murmuring, “Do you want to meet my dad, Cas?”
The omega was weak in the legs and still a little drowsy. Cas could feel that though Dean looked thin as a twig; he was still heavy. Heavy bones probably? The alpha also realized that if the omega didn’t hunch, out of weakness, he would stand tall at 6’1”.
His eyes drifted to the omegas fluffier than clouds, wolf tail that was up high and wagging in the air. He chuckled and telepathically said,
Charlie hummed thoughtfully into the phone. She spoke in a more lower tone that held slight curiosity and worry, “All is well, Cassie. Though, I’m gonna ask a question that I want you to answer truthfully…..Are you ok?”
of seeing Dean Winchester again and also those other wolves that may still look at him like dirt under their shoes.
Cas would never lie to her. It was one of the things she admired about the sweet omega. She saw Dean shoot
Sure enough, dad brought him a slicked up artificial omega hole for him to pump himself into. He had never felt so red in the face before. Dad only smiled reassuringly at him, handing him over the item and saying, “There’s nothing to be shy about son. I have also done what I can to relieve me from my rut, before your mother. I promise this stays between father and son. Nothing will leave this room. You have my word.”
Yeah he deserved Castiel’s hostility. But, he wasn’t going to stand here and be silent as to why he had to fuck Anna the moment he arrived. He bit back with quite a strong tone, “Omega, I have my reasons for doing what I have to, the moment I step foot here! Too young for you to understand!”
John who witnessed the wonderful affectionate moment between the true mates decided to give them his blessings before all. The great Winchester alpha said,
He was 17, and, definitely turning heads. Who knew that once he bloomed after his first heat, at 16, that alphas eyes would be on him.
He found himself getting breathless, so he stopped in his tracks. He feared to move further; so from a meter away, he asked, “Momma. What’s wrong with Dean? Is he sick?”
He wanted to leave the tent immediately and let the servant do her work, but deep inside, his wolf could not bare another looking at his omegas nakedness- so he found himself dressing Castiel carefully in midnight blue silk before he was satisfied enough to dictate what Pam needed to do and leave the tent.
Mary shooed all that were in the hall, “Leave. We will pick up matters first thing tomorrow morning.”
Still good looking, a little more mature but aged like fine wine. The freckles, those green eyes encased in perfect shaped eyes that had a deeper set of crows feet, perfectly combed dirty blonde hair and much more buff physic that came with age and a good amount of fitness.
And as they locked gazes; he saw the same hunger he felt rattling around in lower tummy and groin. He felt wetness leak out of him and his heart was thumping hard against his ribcage. They were both trying to keep their breathing in check- as want and eagerness flooded their beings.
Then, the blue eyed man glanced up at him with those curious shy blue eyes. It seemed Cas was slightly nervous, but, nonetheless, the man asked so timidly, “Dean, are you….are you asking me out on a dinner date?”
Then, the horrifying day before senior graduation came.  July 6th, Jimmy Novak had overdosed on his anxiety meds. It was on the morning of graduation that Castiel found his brother, lifeless in his room.
He had just gotten out of a messy relationship with a girl named Anna Milton. The red head was an overly controlling woman- and the crazy part was they had been together for 5 years.
He carried Dean into his arms, laying a peck on his sons snout, “Sorry baby. Not this time. I want you to be a good boy and take care of mom, Sammy and your little pup friend whilst daddy is gone. Ok?”
Dean smiled. Well now or never. He inhaled a deep breath and clicked his heels into the side of his horse, Impala. She galloped into the kingdom or Lawrence, eager to get home with her master and his lover on her back.
Castiel walked in, eyes on the ground, a slight tinge of pink crawling up the omegas neck and cheeks. The omega stopped a meter before Dean, eyes carefully finding his. The omega smiled shyly and said, “I um- I couldn’t sleep.”
If Dean was dating and had completely forgotten about him, then he supposes he could do the same too! And that’s why, when the charming British accented alpha named Balthazar Cruise, asked him out, he had said
Man. All this thinking was giving him a whiplash. Because, damn was it one hell of a revelation- and if it happened to be true-
….is not something that can happen in our lives…not in reality. Brothers can hug, cuddle, and have sleep overs, but, they cannot kiss each other nor engage in anything else
Sadly, the rule of Council is law. The pack alphas come under the rule of Council, and have no say in their deliberating-
Dean met his mother and father’s curious gazes. “Mom. Dad. I’d like you to meet someone special to me. This here is Castiel Novak. My beloved. My omega.”
There Cas stood in his slightly debauched state. It seemed that the omega had tried to tidy himself up, fingers through the messy dark hair to settle the ruffled nest, fully clothed and slapping on a smile that didn’t quite reach the omegas eyes. But, there were tells, things that Cas couldn’t hide, such as those bitten red swollen lips, that angry red hickey peeking out just under the collar of the omegas t-shirt, that flushed face, those fully blown pupils, the slightly wrinkled clothes, however, the biggest affirmation yet, was the slightly cautious looking, blonde haired, fully clothed, equally debauched male alpha that stood at least a meter behind Cas.
Chuck gave a smug look, “Why do you think I brought my warriors along with me, omega? They are here to protect me. And these four older wolves are part of the Milton Pack Council, they are here to order the release of the halfbreed.”
Cas eyes the towel Dean's got tucked around his waist like it's done something offensive, all the while creeping in even closer. Dean would be lying if he denied the first twitches of a boner, but mostly his focus is on his heart, which is tapping out a panicky, paranoid beat.
"This is my point. Don't you think you're so hard on her 'cause she's, you know, into Cas? And that freaks you out?"
Cas' angry look softens into something more like awe. He drags his hand out of Dean's hair to stroke down one side of Dean's face. The tenderness of it is what makes Dean huff, try to twist his head away.
Without waiting for another word, he pushes open the driver's side door and gets out, stretching his neck. Cas exits his side a beat after. Their doors click shut at the same time, loud in the silence. Still, neither of them move, the motel lobby a sudden foreboding thing.
That's Sam's voice booming from above and behind, loud like some pitchy overhead speaker meant to publicly shame.
wind up being bunk-buddies with Cas in some 3-bedroom/2-bath model home on the outskirts of an apple pie town. No.
"Put it up myself last night. Good news is, you're not crazy. Bad news is, no more creeping on people."
"YES," Dean says, capslock and all, at the same time Charlie backs away a few steps to physically distance herself from the topic.
Jo, two years younger and every bit the lifelong royal pain in his ass, hassles him tonight when he shows up fresh off securing his job.
But Cas doesn't. Dean knows this because he's tried before to get Cas laid, only it's never worked out. One time, with fake IDs, they went to this shady, rundown brothel. Cas had gotten as far as first base before the
Cas doesn’t say anything to that. He picks up the book and starts flipping through it. At first, with intent, then after a couple pages, with some curiosity.
Dean looks at Cas -- he's already looking at Dean -- and ignores the curl of guilt that winds up sloshing around his insides. "Just a burger and fries for me."
"I have no money," he admits. In the storage room back at the Gas-n-Sip, where his sleeping bag is rolled up and hidden between a mop bucket and a recycling bin, he has three weeks of wages stored safely. However, he's paid by Nora in business checks and the woman at the check cashing store made it clear an I.D. or valid driver's licence is necessary to exchange them for cash. Basically, as Dean would say, he's screwed.
Dean pushes out a weak laugh to cover the fact that he hasn't managed to handle a friggin' thing here. There's nights he sits up still waiting to hear his dad walk through the door, and how fucked up is that?
“You kinky sonuvabitch,” Dean murmurs, drawn to Cas, who falls in close, whose mouth has a tantalizing pull Dean's become unable to resist since they yanked his ass outta the Empty some three weeks ago.
Sam clears his throat. "Right. Well." He glances at Dean again, like he expects Dean to pick up where he's left off. Smooth.
Cas rolls his hips into Dean's, so that Dean can feel through their layers of denim just how hard he is. It's dirty as fuck, which means Dean loves it. "And what do you think now?"
"Yeah, so," he adds, losing cool points by the second. His brain literally feels like it's retreating in on itself.
It's hard not to recall those feelings when the circumstances now are so similar, though Cas at least is marginally more clothed.
"I'm not wallowing! I'm celebrating." And he was. Or, trying to, except Sam sure as hell was doing a bang up job of ruining that.
"Yes," Cas answers himself, standing there in the kitchen's entranceway. He's in Dean's robe (thieved only days after Cas first got there, and Dean still mourns its loss) looking like hell warmed over, squinting like the room's too bright. "And yes."
"Chop or scoot," he tells her, waving his spatula at the line up of vegetables she's supposed to be cutting.
They both gasp, for different reasons, and where Dean is finally starting to feel like there isn't a foreign object lodged up his ass, Cas' response has more to do with the fact that he's penetrating something for the first time. Which is the whole damn point of Dean being the bottom. Call him romantic, but he wanted to make their first time special for Cas since the guy's never properly done this with, you know, anyone. Ever.
Cas slits his eyes at the name-calling but does as told. He copies the way Dean entered, slower, though, while he adjusts.
Dean splays his hands out, gesturing. "I'm in Heaven, right? So, I got all I could ever want." Pointedly, "All I
For some reason, that has Cas frowning. It takes him a second, but then he looks down. He pulls at the coat to reveal the whole name tag. "Castiel," he corrects.
When Dean was a kid -- we're talking six or seven here -- his favorite story to tell was the one about his house burning down.
That was not a pillow. That was Cas' ass, and thanks to the alarm still going off, it was an ass that was also waking up.
"I myself have always been more of a Take That fan. You should see my 'Do What You Like' choreographed routine. It's brilliant--would bowl you over completely. I'm Kevin, by the way," the guy says, holding out a hand.
When Cas only leaned back to get away from the greasy smell of food, Dean dragged a chair around and sank right onto it. He scooped up a forkful of eggs and held it towards Cas.
"That's not what I was apologizing for, however. I realize tonight may have inadvertently appeared to be an 'ambush.'"
Sam's not buying it. Dean glances over, catches the pity, the sadness. It's enough to make his throat bob, for this overwhelming feeling of grief to swell inside, engulf him whole. He almost loses it. Almost, almost gives into the guilt and the regret that has been non-stop eating him alive since it happened. Since Cas got sucked into the Empty. He can't even dull it with booze, and he's tried.
"Calm down," Dean snaps, only because it's easier to accuse Cas of grouchiness rather than join him in the touchy-feely stuff. "Who spit in your Cheerios?"
"But what if my intent was always to roll in the hay with you," Cas argues, stumbling around the euphemism.
Dean hopes to god his judgment translates; like every cliché ever, Cas's drink is fruity-looking with the world's tiniest toothpick paper umbrella propped at the side.
All at once, it hits him. Cas is packing for college. Knowing it'd happen eventually and seeing it actually happen are two totally different things. It's staggering, almost. He thinks he plays it off like nothing's wrong, but then again, he's gone pretty numb, his mind zeroing on 'Cas is leaving' and looping that over and over.
Sam gapes at him a moment, then turns his disbelief over to Cas, who is leafing through the file again, his whole forehead furrowed like he's deep in concentration and couldn't possibly have been paying attention to the conversation happening around him. That's Dean's teachings, to counter Sam's: play stupid as often as possible, especially when hounded on by giant moose.
"So? What he'd say? Did he tell you his name? See, I knew it. You totally want to do romantic stuff with Scarf Guy--"
Dean slips off his own stool. He swallows one last, long pull of beer before setting it down and offering up a fake smile. “You know what, you? Have a nice night.”
Once seated, with a pile of breakfast food plated at the table between them, Dean has to shake his head and laugh to himself, marveling once more at how damn
Next, they tug off their shirts and throw them aside. Cas pulls back to shuck off his pants and Dean uses the break to do the same, only Cas finishes first so Dean's jeans wind up wrapped around his ankles, but who cares.
Cas lingers for a long second, then makes up his mind and comes in. He hovers close by while they ignore the elephant in the room like the emotional robots they both are.
“Burger, and we’ll go 50/50 on the fries,” Dean speaks up, offering the lady a 'he's shy, what can you do?’ smile like that might cut it.
Dean looks up, heart already thrumming wild in his chest, and feels it jump anew because Cas is standing across the room. His Cas. Fresh out of Purgatory Cas. Holy shit.
"I'm attracted to you," Cas says back reasonably, like it's an explanation and excuse all in one. Of course it makes Dean gape at him before he bolts into a sitting position.
"You know, usually when someone gets this close it's because I'm at Comic-Con and personal bubbles are an imaginary thing. Like deodorant. You good?"
Benny picked up on it, his eyebrows lifting high. He laughed, light and rattling. "You got complications inside complications, brother," he said almost happily. He shook his head and chucked a little more with his knife. "He pulled you outta Hell. I get it."
It might just be because his headspace isn't in the best place right now, but Cas is like a goddamn godsend.
' title when it comes to emotional chicken. Then he's sighing out, slumping back onto the sofa. He sits hunched over, his forearms braced against his thighs, back all bent. With his eyes trained ahead, stare lost somewhere in the general vicinity of Dean's boots, he replies on a long, heavy breath, weary once more. "I made a choice.
heard of those before. I wasn't sure. Town secret," she whispers behind her palm, eyebrows darting towards the kitchen.
"You don't wanna--" Sam starts, glancing behind him like there's more mall to be had, but fuck that so hard.
Sam makes a noise of protest and hauls his body weight around him, so that he's stopped Dean dead in his tracks. "Dean, listen to me," he tries, verging on alarm, but before either of them can make another move, that same back door Sam came out of earlier creaks open. Both of their attentions swing around at the sound of a third party, a voice so familiar, Dean could weep.
At this point, hell if he knows. He thinks it might be easier if she went ahead and did it. Ended things with him. At least he'd know where they stood.
"Thank god," Jo was saying, and Dean realized it was her hands that had guided Cas into the spot. She still had a hold of his shoulders, and for one dizzying second Dean felt a territorial urge to claim Cas as his own so strongly, he felt his stomach kick all the way up his throat. Then Jo backed off and said, "You fix him," which made Cas pin one of those intense stares on Dean, like if he looked hard enough, he might be able to see into Dean's soul.
There are a shit ton of things Dean could say right now, starting at the top with 'sorry I suck so bad, it'd be awesome if you gave this thing between us another shot', but in the end, he settles with, "Here," shoving the hot chocolate into Cas's free hand. "Wear the damn scarf next time, you idiot."
He snatches the remote back and turns the TV off before protests can be made, then hauls Cas up and off the couch with him.
“Pretty sure I caught him massagin’ one out over some geek spellbook. Freak,” Dean says with some fondness.
Sam doesn't comment on it, and neither does Dean. Just gets it playing and settles back. Before the credits even finish, Sam stands.
"Don't do that!" he snaps once he's sure his heart isn't skipping its way up his throat anytime soon. Cas only tilts his head at him, all big, round, puzzled eyes. Eventually that softens into sympathy, which Dean likes a lot less.
"I get it," he tells him, hurt, which turns his tone and all his thoughts mean. "When do you ever stick around anyway? Huh? For the long haul? 'Cause we need a guy battin' clean-up, to -- to fall on the sacrificial sword." He smiles tightly. "That's what you're good at, isn't it?"
The Cas/Meg/Sam bedroom monster whooshed out of Dean's head, gone like it'd never been there in the first place. Replaced, of course, by Dean's old friend self-doubt.
He scowls at Dean like Dean's a nasty, foul-mouthed son-of-a-bitch, then snaps, "Fine," like he's agreeing to do Dean's homework for him. Which basically means he's expecting something out of it for him in return, but Dean has no time to process that because Cas slides into the space between Dean's legs, elbowing them so that Dean knows to arrange himself so he's got his socked feet planted on the floor and the knobby knee part up near Cas' shoulders, and then Cas is actually sucking Dean's dick.
They come up to the room as silently as possible, though their feet crunch over broken glass and other debris on the ground. The humming never stops, and when Dean peeks through the wide doorframe, he spots a guy twenty feet away handcuffed to an old support beam in the room, unconscious.
Dean eases his way around Sam until he rounds the counter. He's stealthy about it, borderline ninja, like there's emotional tripwire he's maneuvering to avoid.
They have to be careful; even though this place is tucked into the corner of town people have no reason to loiter at, there are guys out there, guys like Alastair and Crowley, who might show up just to piss everyone off.
A reassuring hand lands at his shoulder, then soon winds up the back of his neck, clasping pretty intimately.
They say the first thing you forget is the sound of someone's voice, but Dean? All he's got to do is close his eyes and his mom's in his head singing 'Hey, Jude.'
It's been a while since Dean's dealt with weeping widows, but, hell. He's a professional. Time to steer this back to business. "So," he starts out cheerfully, "nice place you got here."
There, he holds eye contact and demands, in it, that Cas accepts that this is who he is, take it or leave it. And Cas stares back with his own look that challenges Dean to stop being an asshole as his easiest emotional default.
Dean made Benny join him in a booth near the back instead of taking their usual place at the bar, which got them a scowl from Ellen behind the counter and a raise of the eyebrows from Jo over near the dartboard.
Sam carefully sits himself down at the edge of the coffee table in front of Dean, avoiding the still full glass of water he'd brought in earlier. He fidgets with the towel on his lap. "I get it. I do." Dean gives him a hard look that implies he very much doubts that. "What," Sam defends right away, "you think I don't want my brother back?"
"Cas, he's hurt, he's bleeding--" There's a chunk of glass poking out of Cas' back, and it should be a relief because it's small, it's nothing, but when he rolls Cas back over, he notices Cas has got a matching shard coming out that same side in the front, which means the thing's gone all the way through him.
, which Dean nods at, waving him in with all the annoyance and impatience of a man suddenly cockblocked from years worth of pent up sexual frustration.
Dean sticks the cassette into the old boombox he's got on his nightstand. He presses play and slides down until his ass hits the floor.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, play along. What are your plans tonight?" Before he can get out the words 'not a damn blessed thing' she cuts him off. "Celebrating with your favorite-fave! Hey-o!"
"Dean," Cas calls out, stopping him. It works, and Dean turns back to him, emotionless and indifferent. Cas looks sorry, too, like he knows this conversation isn't fair to either of them but he doesn't know how to fix it.
Dean's shift lasts five hours, and by the end of it he feels each and every one of those hours as if they were a year shaved off of his lifespan. It doesn't bode well for his future.
"You're infuriating," he insisted instead, but it didn't have the same venom as before. It was more like Cas was losing steam but he hadn't said his share yet. "And you do leave the toilet seat up, often enough now that I know you're doing it on purpose."
"Hey," Dean says to Sam over the phone. They're driving through town, heading for the rural outskirts. "There any creepy, abandoned, I don't know, demon-y ruins nearby?"
All at once, Sam's eyes widen even further. He sneaks a glance behind him, at the porch, then scoops his hand around Dean's elbow to pull him to the side of the house, away from any windows.
"There are problems that go back further. Ones you and I have had scratching under the surface for a very long time now."
Because he's always been an asshole, Dean dials up the charm and ducks his shoulder, grinning flippantly at Cas' mom. "Hey, Mrs. Shurley."
He looks back at Cas, and Cas is looking at him already, and he's asking without saying anything if Cas felt it too. There's something about the way Cas is staring at him. Something almost familiar.
In a way, though, this is familiar. This is Purgatory. Cas has Dean's back, Dean has his. And Benny. Benny...
Dean keeps going. He makes it clear out the house, but Naomi's there on the porch, leaning against the rail.
“Does this upset you?” Cas asks him, after another pause. There’s some regret making it's way through the phone.
The table's thick between them when Dean sits, it's also a welcome partition, but he still feels exposed by the sincerity and care Bobby's giving him. It makes his walls hike straight up. His guard, too, shoots into place, making towers of his ribcage.
"Okay," she surrenders. "But don't think I won't crack you. I'll break you like a weak hack. Or an egg. Whichever threatens you more."
Sam's slack beside him on the couch, typing something up on his phone. Probably a text. Probably to Jess.
"Look, you don't gotta get permission from me, okay, I get it. After everything we have been through, man do I ever. I'm--happy for you." He struggles to say it, but everything in him means it.
He whirls around, completely in the dark now because the flashlight Cas had a hold on is currently shining a halo of light uselessly against the floorboards. He raises his shotgun, whispering, "Cas, you okay?" while he creeps that way.
"That's on you, man. Been flirting since day one," Dean jokes, feeling light now that he doesn’t have to hide anything.
It's so brief Dean could've just blinked and blacked out a second, but the flush of Cas's own cheeks when he pulls back and the very real shock and then glee on Sam's face let's him know, nah. That really happened.
"Where we're going to get our dance on later. And our drink, and our sleaze, and if we're lucky, our hook-up, which'll lead us straight into our walk of shame. It's the circle of life."
"Oh, whatever, like that's not a compliment. Sooooo. Tell me everything! Was he hot? I bet he was dreamy."
Dean snatched the beer away a second time and managed to haul Cas up and off the couch before any protests could be made.
"Cas," Dean starts, but Cas whips his head around, all kinds of intense and stubborn like it's just that simple. And, hell. Maybe it is. Maybe Dean's a selfish bastard for wanting it too, but he wants it so bad. And him and Cas, the two of them together, they've always ripped up the script. Why stop now?
Cas doesn't question the mood change; how Dean could be so distant just a short time ago and now they're sharing personal space again, Dean catching his hips onto Cas's purposefully. It makes him think this thing between them might work.
"Okay," Sam interrupts. He sets the hot chocolate on the counter and steps back. "I'm going to... not be a witness to this inevitable double-homicide. From way back there, where I'll be, not insulting the customers. Cas," he says, though Cas is stuck glaring at Dean and barely pays him any attention, "drink's on the house, for pretty much ever. Okay."
Before that, before Wisconsin and the landlady that kicked them out, Dean remembers overhearing phone calls. Sam, six-years-old, asleep in the bed beside him, curled up underneath a small mountain of thin, scratchy motel blankets, and their dad whispering outside the single room, snippets of the conversation he was trying to keep quiet making its way to Dean.
“No. Listen. JoAnne,” Dean starts, trying to come up with a believable reason to get her to give them, oh, five minutes of alone time. That should do it. “Uh, you think—”
"Okay," Sam agrees gently. He stares at Dean a moment longer, sympathy oozing from him like it's turned literal, before shifting back towards the road.
Dean, who's slipping out of his jacket and laying it across the back of a chair. He dumps his duffel near a trash can by the table, eyeballing Cas as he does.
Except Cas pushes Dean down with his weight so that he's practically smothering him into the dusty floorboards, enthusiasm cranked all the way up to twelve. One of his hands gets trapped under Dean's left shoulder and the other's still fisted in Dean's hair, right behind his ear.
Dean tugs his hands out of Cas' and moves away, rolling his eyes. Funny how he's been waiting for Cas to admit he screwed up big time, but now that it's happening, he doesn't want to hear it.
"As Hermione and Harry's one true love, you bet your sweet, freckled ass. Now go break that gay boy's spirit, you stud."
It's not the knowing too much that Dean fears, okay, it's what he knows. Gun to his head, when Dean finally gets home? He can't say he won't try and stop some of this from happening. Stop Cas. And that realization sits too heavy in Dean's head. It's an anchor and he's getting dragged down.
"What?" he gets out once he's able. He's not proud of the fact that his eyes are watering, but he's pretty sure his brother just told him Cas is gay, so.
Benny made another sound, this time like Dean was clamming up for no good reason, like he was gonna go ahead and presume Dean was protecting Cas' virtue or whatever. It made something in his stomach clamp up, something else in his throat tighten.
And Sam out there is the perfect poster boy of content with his long hair and his whole grain food and whatever's happening with Jess. He's got everything going for him. Not to mention, Dean's spotted Craigslist open on Sam's laptop a few times now, and it's always the apartment hunting page that's pulled up. That might be fucking with him most of all because, hey, here's something messed up, Dean likes living with his brother. Kind of can't live without him, actually.
It's kind of an awesome thought. The guy's experienced his share of the shitty side of humanity--homelessness, hunger, there was a meltdown over a paper cut a few days ago they don't talk about--and now Dean's got the chance to share one of the good parts.
Sam comes into the room when they're halfway through their third game, the tiebreaker, since Cas won that first time and Dean won the second and now they need this one to know who can rightfully gloat.
Sam gives him a bitchy glower right back and keeps going. "I see you now, and then I think about my brother who's out there not answering his phone because it's me on the caller id, and I don't want that. It's okay to want things for yourself. Hell, Dean, put me on the back burner for once, enjoy your damn life."
Dean didn't even know what 'this' was supposed to mean, but that didn't stop his heart rate from tripling.
Dean wraps his arm around Cas' shoulders and tugs. Not expecting it, Cas pretty much topples sideways into Dean, but Dean plants a grin on his face and keeps it there, tightening his grip.
For the forty six minutes Cas sits and waits at a bus stop in Dell Rapids, his thoughts turn over themselves again and again. He worries if he made the right decision, when it seems instead to be the selfish one. He wonders if there will be a wedge between him and Dean. If he opened Dean's eyes to something he didn't want to see.
Dean gets up as well, book calmly set aside. They're already short of space between them, and it becomes even less with Sam staring him down like some ticked off moose. "Awesome." He gestures for Sam to bring it on. "Get it out your system."
Slowly, calmer, Cas dips forward, the press of his weight pushing Dean's legs even farther apart. Dean swallows, cursing silently as his strength gives out and his head hits the pillow.
Cas wiggles into the touch, sighing out happily. It happens accidentally, but Dean winds up running his hand over Cas' hair, smoothing the sweaty strands back. Cas shivers and Dean pulls away.
Cas reads it with a look that grows from confused to surprised. By the time he glances up, it's nothing but hopeful longing.
Dean says, with his own eyeballs demanding Cas tone it down, “I hope this isn’t a bad time,” and he starts to step his way in without an invite.
Dean gets up quick, his chair making noise as it drags across the linoleum. "All this talk about bathrooms, heh. I, uh, need to go see a man about a horse. Be right back."
Sam wants to push it, he can tell. Of course he does, he practically schedules these Very Important Talks in at least once a day. But the old lady across the table ain't even bothering to play coy, she's straight up staring, and the last thing Sam would ever do is make a scene. God forbid. He clears his throat, saying, "Yup," in a forced casual way that means Dean is only momentarily being left off the hook, there will definitely be some opening up of feelings later. Fuck that.
"I'm at a bar," he tells him. He has to hustle past a few more people before he finds a side alley he can disappear for a few minutes into. 'Bar' is being generous, by the way. It's more like a nightclub, all emphasis on the 'club.' Techno music pulses out into the street anytime the door opens, which is Dean's idea of hell on earth if anybody had bothered to ask him.
"Whatever. We agreed rings were tacky. We're shackled in our hearts," Dean throws out real quick as passable excuses. "Problem solved."
"I love you," Cas tells him forcefully, this desperate, hopeful attempt to rewrite the past few minutes. Or, hell, their entire summer, for all Dean knows.
Five minutes to eleven, though, and Dean's still in bed, buried under a mound of covers. He woke up with morning wood, predictably so, and has spent the better half of the past ten minutes lightly massaging himself, still drowsy and lazy from sleep and not in any rush.
Dean folds the wallet and puts it back where he found it. He sips his beer and tells himself nothing's changed, and he's halfway to believing that when the jukebox skips to the next track and some Zep starts playing.
"I don't think I can." Cas was starting to look a little green around the gills. Dean might've been more sympathetic, if he didn't feel so strongly that it was Cas' damn fault in the first place for getting loaded with Meg.
Whatever that means. Except it's just another confirmation that all he's ever going to do is screw up every relationship with anyone he's ever cared even a little about. If he's on Cas' shit list -- Cas, the guy who once looked him dead in the eye and announced like it wasn't a big fucking deal that he rebelled against of all of Heaven for him -- then, hey, maybe it's an inherent thing. It's him. Maybe Dean's a bad person and everyone else has finally caught on.
He was just a meter behind Cas, watching the man hugging his giant stuffy bee and smiling as he glanced around here and there. The man looked so freaken adorable and much more younger. He couldn’t help but smile in affection, reminding himself that he had one hell of a sexy man as his date tonight.
They were perfectly fine working without contracts before. Bobby was well known and only had a handful of men working for him. Men, who were locals and didn’t care much for legal documents. He used to just agree on an amount and work for his surrogate dad. He did that a lot in high school. Well, these changes must have come about when ‘
“Dean you’re back”. Dean watched as Castiel decided to turn his head to the hallway as if searching. Dean knew what his omega was searching for.
He saw the most beautiful smile light up Cas eyes, and for the first time, his alpha wasn’t as cheeky, instead it was calm and eager to give its omega the gift of comfort.  Cas didn’t wait a second longer, scooting over and plastering himself to his side, laying his hand and side of his head right above his steadily beating heart.
And he knew that it wasn’t fair for anyone to condemn Cas for choosing Balthazar, because, Dean did date Lisa, but, the important bit was that Dean himself didn’t know or understand that his attraction to Cas was because of a
He slapped on his infamous coy smirk and sauntered his way up to the still oblivious alpha. When he approached, his nose caught a heavenly scent that made the omega within him preen in absolute delight, vanilla and honeycomb.
over Dean. And her little alpha didn’t even realize it, nor did the little omega. One of the signs of a great bond in the making. They would learn of this power as the years pass by. The omega always held the upper hand in the relationship.
Dean dragged his hands up his waist, squeezing lightly and drawing in another long sniff of his neck, and, murmuring breathlessly into his neck, “Mmm. Soon, baby. Soon. I promise.”
Castiel huffed and turned his gaze to meet Dean’s wolf green eyes. He had to ask this question out of curiosity.
- before he looked up to meet the eyes of his smiling alpha standing by the entrance to their kitchen. His omega heart skipped several beats as he took in his handsome alpha- this wolf who was his alone.
“Look. I know how devastated you were when Jimmy passed, so I figured I keep the fact that his twin was working as my accountant. Besides, why should it matter? The kid isn’t Jimmy. Plus, he earned this job fair and square!” Bobby wiped his hands on the grease cloth, shooting him a questioning look, “Unless, the man is already a problem for you?”
It was like he was breathing fresh air again, when the front door to his home, banged shut. His chest felt lighter, the air felt so cool and calming. He definitely felt more alive than he’s ever been. For the first time in months, he felt like he could breathe.
Cas had seemed to bury his face into the crook of Dean’s neck. The blue eyed man still hugged him, but, in a much more calmer manner. It reminded Dean of something intimate. He rubbed circles into Cas mid back, murmuring, “Cas. You ok there?”
He suddenly felt so good. He suddenly felt so accomplished. He whistled happily and grabbed a wrench out of the red tool box, lifting the hood of the rusty Camaro and getting to work. At least, he’d pass the time faster, burying his head into work.
“Pino, Nina, Lenny, Misha and Queen Rose!” Kaylen replied with so much enthusiasm he nearly spilled his lemonade drink, clutching it steadily just in time.
He was actually in awe, his admiration and respect only grew stronger toward his alpha mate. So, he thought he’d be fine that he was given his own bed to sleep in…but no. Something was up and his omega was restless. He kept tossing and turning under the sheets, trying to find a good position to fall asleep, but, no dice.
The Jay Bird only tilted his head from side to side, eyes focused on him, while fluffing its feathers. It looked so happy to be basking under the glow of the sun, and, acted as if it were trying to project its happiness unto him. It hopped back and forth on its tiny feet, as if trying to entertain him with its goofy antics. It stopped and stared at him as he let out a giggle- and to him, the bird looked delighted that it had managed to make him laugh. The bird then sounded a final melodious chirp before it spread its wings and took flight, in the direction of its favorite tree, in the gardens.
The hollowness in his chest only grew bigger with Dean’s words. He tried to hold back those tears that threatened to pool in his eyes, however, he couldn’t keep his voice from trembling as he uttered, “Of course, Dean. Um- no kisses, no um- other things…because we are brothers and um- brothers don’t do stuff like that.”
He smiled up at the ceiling, lightly scratching at Gabe’s scalp. “Mhmm babe. Me too. I’m sure we will have many moments like these, when we become officially mated next year.” Yup, they weren’t waiting anymore longer, as soon as they hit 18, they were legally able to mate-
Now, all these feelings made him confused. What was happening? Why did he feel like tilting his neck to the side, just so the alpha could…NO! He won’t go there!
A few tears slipped into his true mate’s pillow and a muffled apology would follow. “I’m sorry my omega”.
Mazy smiled happily. “Will do Master Castiel!” She had a skip in her step as she returned back to the kitchen. She was always happy to feed people.
Castiel held no irritation in his heart for the littlest Winchester. In fact, he felt protective and nurturing towards the little one snuggled between Dean and he. He shook his head, returning Dean’s smile and whispering back, “It’s ok Dean. He’s most welcome to snuggle in anytime”.
Dean sensing his nervousness (because really they were walking into the deeper neck of the woods), decided to reassure him by saying,
The man’s soft smile and kind green eyes- that seemed bottle green in the lights reflection- was enough to have him slightly weak in the knees. The man had his hands stuffed into the front pocket of his black slacks, not moving any closer.
He balked, “what!?” His eyes swept over his café patrons, as if trying to spot who was missing. And, now that he did check out the cafe, he noticed that there were quite a number of tables empty. He quickly shifted his focus back at Gabriel who was now aiming him an
