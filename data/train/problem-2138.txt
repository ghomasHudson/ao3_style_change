Sherlock’s eyes snapped open as a teacup was placed in front of him. Sherlock looked up to John and took the cup.
“You...love me?” John pulled Sherlock down into a breathtaking kiss.
“I am your big brother,” Mycroft said to the boy, “it may not look like it, but I care about your well-being, brother mine.” Sherlock glared at him and tossed the tissue back onto the table. He grabbed his violin from the corner and faced the window, signalling his brother to get out of the apartment.
“What happened to your eye?” Greg asked as he resumed the movie.
“You daft, daft detective,” the blogger whispered, “I love you too.”
“Then do something else, read a book,” the doctor said, getting quite frustrated with the other man.
“Why can I never say no?” John muttered and growled. He had no idea how to talk himself out of this. He was pulled out of his trail of thoughts by Greg who had somehow appeared beside him.
But to John’s surprise, Sherlock only buried his face deeper into the blogger’s shirt and wrapped his long arms around him.
The boys were finished with breakfast an hour later. John had retreated into the livingroom and started reading a book. Sherlock, as promised, started doing his experiment.
“He has broken his elbow,” one of the medics said to the referee, “he must be brought to the hospital at once.” John winced when the medics helped him up and brought him to the side of the stadium.
“Is he okay?” John asked, looking straight in front of him, not daring to meet the other man's eyes.
Sherlock pulled away, smiling. He kissed John’s tears away and pulled him into a tight hug.
“C-can I put my head on your lap?” Sherlock asked, regretting his question immediately.
“John, I don’t go for walks,” the detective muttered.
“Molly? As in Molly Hooper from our chemistry class?” Greg nodded, “where did she get those?”
Tears started to prickle his eyes and he got out the scalpel that he had stolen from one of the doctors. He cut deep lines into his already broken wrists, opening the old scars in the process. Tears started to fall from his eyes as he cut deeper.
“Why were you put here?”
Suddenly John heard a quiet whimper and he raised his head in horror. He looked at the bathroom door and saw a puddle of blood forming.
“What just happened?” Sherlock whispered into John’s hair, “if this is a dream-” John cut him off with a kiss.
“John!” the man yelled and shook his friend. He soon realized that it was no use so he picked him up and carried him upstairs.
“SHERLOCK!”
“That’s what you get for being weird, you freak!” The boys laughed and walked away.
“Thank you for what you did to my brother,” the voice startled John and he looked at the direction it was coming from. He saw Sherlock's older brother Mycroft, sitting on Sherlock's old bed with his black umbrella.
“We actually met just yesterday, Mrs Holmes,” the woman turned at John’s words.
“Sherlock.”
“It’s 5 in the morning,” John turned around at Sherlock’s statement and shrugged, chuckling.
“Sherlock helps Scotland Yard-”
“I can identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb. Now imagine an 8-year-old me playing with children,” he spoke, “I would be freaking them out by deducing their life stories.” John chuckled, imagining what would it look like.
Suddenly the boy’s phone buzzed and he took it out, half expecting for it to be an another useless text from one of his classmates.
John must had thought that he was a weirdo. But to the detective’s surprise John smiled and nodded. Sherlock stretched out his legs and lowered his head on the blogger’s lap. He was pleasantly surprised that John hadn’t turned his question down.
“Are you out of your mind?” John yelled and grabbed the gun from the detective’s hand, putting it onto the table. He then pinned the other man to his armchair and glared at him sharply.
John watched as deep cuts appeared onto his wrist.
John stood back and then threw himself against the left side of the door. He repeated that a couple times. As he was about to give it the last blow, he heard an another quiet whimper. It seemed to give him more strength so he gave it the last blow.
“Hi,” the boy replied. Silence took over the room, both of the boys wanted to talk about something but they didn’t want to break the silence.
Over the few days, John didn’t notice any new bruises. He thought that his soulmate felt better and that they had overcome their problems. The upcoming game with UCL’s team made him forget all the problems and focus on practising instead.
“Mycroft told me stuff about you, you know,” the shorter boy spoke, “he told me that you sometimes don’t eat or sleep in days. You also smoke and do drugs. And there’s also a slight chance that you start cutting and that time you would die. You clearly need someone to watch over you. And your landlady can’t babysit you.”
“So, an early start then?” Sherlock asked, chuckling lightly. John nodded and grabbed yesterday’s paper, since today’s hadn’t arrived yet.
John stole a glance at Sherlock. He would’ve liked to call him his Sherlock. But as the man himself said, ‘I’m married to my work’ and ‘Sentiment is a chemical defect on the losing side’. John then got up and smiled at the detective before going to the kitchen to make some tea.
Suddenly he heard a yelp and a crash and Sherlock shot up from his seat. He ran out of the door and looked down at the base of the stairs. His blogger was lying on the bottom, unconscious.
“Just wanted to check on you, brother dear,” the strange man replied, then turning towards John, “I’m Sherlock’s older brother Mycroft, by the way, you’ll be seeing me quite a lot here.” Greg turned back towards John, an amused impression on his face.
It was a rainy October night. John was sitting on the couch, watching Lord of the Rings & The Two Towers, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Sherlock was in the morgue, doing experiments on some bodies, at least that was what he had told his blogger.
“You have grown rather fond of my little brother,” Mycroft's statement brought a light blush to John's cheeks, “you can see him anytime you want, I've arranged it so you could be there for any time you want to.”
“221B Baker Street please,” Sherlock said as they got into a cab.
“Did you have a nightmare?” Sherlock nodded, his cheeks burning red in shame, “it’s okay to have nightmares.” Sherlock looked at the clock, it said 3am.
A few moments later, Sherlock finally decided to stop thinking of that painful topic, and got up. He pulled on his robe and stepped out to the kitchen.
“I don’t want to picture it. My flatmate and your brother.”
“I-i’m so sorry Sherlock,” the shorter man said, tears clouding his vision, amongst the memories from the hospital and yesterday. All he could see was Sherlock’s pained face.
John didn’t know what to do with his hands. He wanted to touch the other man’s curly hair so badly but he knew he shouldn’t. That wasn’t what normal friends do. Two male friends didn’t rest their heads on each other’s laps and definitely didn’t think of kissing the other.
John was woken up by a piercing scream coming from downstairs. He put on his grey robe and rushed down the stairs. He knew exactly where the scream was coming from.
“BORED!” Sherlock yelled once again, grabbing the gun from the pit where John had hidden it. Before the shorter man could object, he shot an another hole into the smiley on the wall.
“You okay?” John’s eyes snapped up at Sherlock’s sudden question and after a short pause, he nodded slowly.
“There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'd be needing two bedrooms.” Mrs Hudson suddenly said from behind them and John turned around.
What if-
“John?” John was woken from his slumber by Sherlock’s quiet voice, “what are you doing here?” The shorter boy stood up from his seat and walked beside Sherlock’s bed.
“Apparently.”
“Thank you Sherlock, for everything,” John said, his voice quivering, “I’m not worthy of you, you deserve so much better.” Sherlock pulled his friend into a tight hug and the shorter man rested his head on his friend’s chest.
John looked down and his cuppa, his cheeks burning red. He couldn’t dare to look at the younger man’s direction, fearing that he could realize and acknowledge the blogger’s feelings.
Sherlock shot up, more tears falling from his eyes. He turned to hi friend, suddenly pulling the older man into his embrace, hiding his face into the crook of his neck.
Seeing Greg and Mycroft made Sherlock realise that he would never find his soulmate. Even if he did, they would probably be startled by Sherlock’s scars and not love him.
“Thank you so much, John,” she said and released John.
“What are you watching?” he asked after a few moments.
“Thanks,” he whispered and brought the mug to his lips.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” he asked, “you were screaming my name.”
“Oh dearie, call me Violet.”
“Where are you when I need you the most?” Sherlock muttered and took the violin from under his chin, carefully placing it back to the corner where it belonged. He heard steps coming up from the stairs, they belonged to Mrs Hudson, his landlady.
It all started one night when John discovered a strange bruise on cheek, right below his right eye. He had no idea where it had come from, he hadn’t been hit there in months. Since it was hard to see the bruise, the boy chose to ignore it. He went out of the bathroom and sat back down onto the couch, where his best friend was waiting for him.
John went back to his bedroom and got under the covers. As his head hit the pillow, he fell back asleep, dreams filled with a certain detective.
“Apparently Hudders cleaned my flat,” Sherlock said, a biscuit in his hand, as John stepped into the flat, “she also made some biscuits, I suggest that you try them, they’re really good.” The shorter grabbed one from the table and took a bite.
“Well, I better get going now,” she said, “got a lot of work to do.” She pulled her son into a quick hug.
“Go back to your room, you need to sleep,” he spoke, “I’ll be okay.” John shook his head.
“Thank god they stopped,” he muttered and Greg nodded.
“STOP THIS AT ONCE!” the doctor hissed.
The scars stopped appearing after a few minutes and John breathed out in relief.
“I’m bored,” John suddenly said and Sherlock looked up.
“SHERLOCK! Wake up!” Sherlock was woken up by a very scared John shaking him, “are you okay? You were screaming and trashing around.” Sherlock bit his lip and looked down in embarrassment.
John hissed in pain as a tiny cut appeared on his left wrist. His breath hitched and he looked up at his friend with wide eyes.
Sherlock watched in utter surprise as a burn scar appeared on his right palm. He then looked at his friend who was holding his hand under the water. His right hand…
Greg sent him a reassuring look before going to the field to play instead of the boy. John sat down onto a seat and he was given an ice pack to put against his elbow.
John shrugged and then took out the cookies. He sat down in his armchair and opened the pack of sweets.
“YOU!? Why are you here?” he asked and Sherlock grinned darkly.
“I wonder what is my “soulmate” doing.”
“Sherlock, stop it.” John spoke, pulling the man back to his original position, “what did you just say to me?”
John pulled away a few seconds later. Way too soon for him to like it, but he didn’t want to overwhelm Sherlock. And most importantly, he didn’t even know if he liked the kiss.
“Do something then, go for a walk or something,” John suggested, looking at the now sulking man.
“Why should YOU be concerned?” Sherlock growled, taking a tissue from the table and brushing away the blood from his lip.
John was astonished by the detective’s charming smile. ‘Did I just say charming?’ the blogger thought, ‘I’m turning into a lovesick teenager.” He sat down into his armchair and took a sip of his coffee.
The blogger decided not to ask any questions and started to break the hug, thinking that Sherlock didn’t like it.
John made it to the hospital in 15 minutes. He was under morphine so he felt pretty numb.
Sherlock looked up at his friend’s face. He looked so much younger when he was sleeping, all the worries were washed from his face.
“Did the doctor give you any meds?” John asked, desperately trying to change the topic.
The boy knew that Sherlock had only a few minutes and he would be gone so he rushed back to their room and pressed the emergency button.
“The ambulance should come in a few minutes,” one of the medics said and John nodded.
“I wouldn’t even dream of it.”
“I don’t believe in this kind of-” he was cut off by a sharp pain in his stomach and he let out a loud yelp.
“Don’t even answer, I’ll make some food for you,” the woman exclaimed, “I’ll be back in 10 minutes.” Mrs Hudson rushed downstairs, leaving the door open. Sherlock rolled his eyes, Mrs Hudson with her helping.
“Oh god no.”
“Does this seem like a dream to you?” he asked and the detective shook his head, smiling.
The blogger’s face flushed red as he realized that Sherlock had accidentally touched a private part of his while leaning in for a treat.
“You look troubled, what happened?” he asked and the boy sighed.
The door flew open and John ran in. He found Sherlock unconscious against the wall, a scalpel beside him and a pool of blood surrounding him.
“I mean, they gave me antidepressants,” Sherlock replied, “I take them at 5 in the evening, so I have 2 hours until that.” The other boy nodded.
“Yea, I’ll go soon,” he replied, “night!”
“I have no idea, the bruise just appeared out of nowhere,” John replied, “I haven’t been in a fight in months, and I wasn’t hit in the practise.” At that, his friend paused the movie and looked at him, a mysterious glint in his eyes.
John was released a few hours later. He was lead straight to Sherlock’s room.
When his wrist was almost covered in cuts, some tiny, some big, Sherlock let the razor fall to the ground. The words ‘freak’ and ‘psychopath’ filled his head and he choked out a sob. The boy hid his head in his arms and cried quietly, the bottled up emotions flowing out.
“Sorry Mrs Hudson,” both the men said and pulled on an apologetic smile. The woman let out a quiet laugh before exiting the room.
“How did you know that?”
“Put this under your eye, it will help with the bruise,” she said, “when did you last eat?” Sherlock opened his mouth to reply.
“Sorry,” his cheeks went red as he released his friend and looked down. He fiddled with the sheets, hoping that that the observant man hadn’t noticed his cheeks.
Mycroft spoke-up, "This stalker is his
Puzzled, John tried to stand up but fell as his legs felt like butter. Awkwardly, they didn't feel like his own. John knew all imaginary spirits stayed in their same spiritual forms forever. If someone was the Easter Bunny or Santa Clause or even a Stuffed Bear then they'd stay that way. John's two ordinary human legs shouldn't feel wrong, heck he shouldn't even be feeling tired or sore.
The consulting detective reached for his pocket lens to further inspect the names of the boy and girl's on the pastel artwork; John and Anthea. Suddenly, Sherlock's legs gave out from underneath him as a new wave of pain crashed onto his body.
"What-" No John, think mentally,
He cautiously avoided the jarred pieces of glass as he tried to reach the upturned kitchen; only to find the detective's and doctor's clothes lying on the ground. As if their very owners had perished into thin air, leaving only their clothes behind.
John rolled his eyes when Sherlock sputtered and started laughing again. Lestrade and Donovan both paled at the sight.
the murderer, no," Sherlock exasperated, tossing Lestrade's I.D. card back and forth between his hands. Damn. He was so sure that that was his man; wrong country, United States. American, Californian. Good alibi. "Hey."
"Don't you dare. The government wouldn't like that." John jumped. The man had to be a psychic.
"Hey, isn't that a kid's drawing?" Lestrade peered at the drawing.
However, no one but himself could see John, and that puzzled Sherlock. He was positive that John was as real as himself and any other person. So why was he the only one who could see John's bright smile and sparkling-blue eyes?
forgive me," John choked out the words, "I have to. It's the rules. All imaginary friends disappear on their eighth birthday, at midnight."
The kids were staring intensely at the new intruder, John in all his human glory. He'll need to gain their trust in order to get any information; since, well, he didn't look anything like a kid anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
The retired army doctor twitched nervously under the low lighting waiting for the worst.
John flipped on the light as soon as he saw the boy cover his eyes.
"No I'm sorry for getting you into this mess in the first place," John felt himself calm down as he sympathised with his counterpart.
"You have been doing this forever? Leaving people, as you will leave me?" Sherlock defeatedly seethed out. He felt the tears clinging to his face as John flinched at his words, he hated it.
Wait, human? Where did that human go, the one who looked like him; it shouldn't be hard to find the guy who punched him in the face and John certainly wasn't the 'human subject'.
Sally Donovan raised her brows, "You mean the Freak? Don't even try to talk to him, your just wasting your precious time. I suggest you go back to where you came from."
human being and likes to condemn his own mistakes onto his flatmate who was currently (risking his life) trying snatch that little piece of cheese off the mousetrap.
He nearly jumped when the door suddenly hit the wall with a surprising amount of speed and Anderson was suddenly shoved through the opening, Sherlock also stepped in nonchalantly.
"Yes I
As soon as John entered the small lounge, the presence of a young child filled his senses before his eyes registered what was in front of him.
sir. Now what do I do with this guy right here?" Sally interrupted quickly, and to John, it definitely sounded like she was trying to cover up the gun incident. Before John could strain his ears any longer, the sergeant rolled her eyes and grabbed John's elbow unexpectedly. John let out a small yelp, and his heart hammered against his chest. The contact felt extremely alien.
"Shwrwok, yucnletgnew." Sherlock snapped his head up to see a slightly red John, whose eyes flashed with annoyance. He reluctantly let go of John's head, watching him rub his jaw, waiting for the right moment to speak.
*Surprisingly, I'm trying to limit the cursing
"Oh," John also turned his head, "He's almost eight..."
The young boy turned his attention towards his complimenter, hiding the determined smile on his face as he stared intently at the fiber on the rugs with as much energy any young-year-old could muster. His name was Sherlock Holmes, aged five and as brilliant as ever.
When John woke up lying down on his back, his whole body felt sore. He sucked in his breath and rolled over.
"Was it?" John pouted and crossed his arms, "I wouldn't have known."
"You never mentioned company," Sherlock accused Lestrade.
Revised: Part 1 (6/11/17)
"Sherlock Holmes," John muttered confirmation, before grinning like one of those little imps. In Sherlock's case, he meant kids. However, John's grin was-charming.
of course the mastermind would record this for entertainment. John was slightly regretting his decision at the moment.
"I'll lose you, you're my best friend.
"Sherlock, do you know that I don't exist? I'm just part of your im--imagination," John spoke softly but his voice broke at the end.
Sherlock tried to grab the blond, but John was too far away.
Sherlock Holmes fell down on his knees in shock and stopped crying.
know how to smile right?"
Pfft, or more likely who it is. Shoot did I say too much? >:/
Sherlock lifted a brow at Sally's remark, letting his head drift to John. John was standing by the corner of the room, completely unfazed by the Yard's recent joke. His expression was so flat, so serious, Sherlock had to try not chuckle at John's mortifying neutral expression.
~Lol. Awkward conversation, I know. Hey!
"Smile for the camera," Sherlock pointed the lens at both John and Anderson. John was smiling.
"Sherlock!" John clutches the fabric of his jacket.
Sherlock scowls at Mycroft's cameras across the street. Mycroft picks his pace, "He's currently on the other side of London." Sherlock blinks at the camera again, if Mycroft wasn't his older brother he'd probably thought he was speaking to the word's most stupid idiot. Even worse than Anderson.
So maybe at this point he should accept that he was going mental. Because spirits do not
face, then Sherlock grabbed his coat and scarf and head out for the door.
"John we're ready," Sherlock said as he pushed Anderson into the chair across John's, the doctor could've sworn he saw his crazy flatmate holding a piece of rope. Hopefully John didn't have to knock out Sherlock if he tried to do anything brash.
"Shut up, look what happened," Lestrade pointed at the two halves which now had a grey hue on it. Sherlock lifted them and realised there were now words on the back, he stared at Lestrade in disbelief who shrugged obliviously.
His thought process was interrupted by the dull sound of rapid footsteps along with low-pitched wailing sirens. He quickly identified that the shuffle of clothes next to him was John and quickly (thankfully) grabbed a nearby loose flannel to cover himself with.
W_Holmes.
Sherlock meets John.
Sherlock felt a sudden pang of sentiment, no, shame; ashamed of startling the solider who sat in front of him.
John licked his lips as Sherlock tugged desperately on his thin bracelet. It was their sign, their bond.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock. I am
"John! Now you answer your phone, we're having a meeting. I know you just transferred, so why didn't you pick up?"
John glared at the metal spring which was wounded around the potentially life-threatening hammer held inches away from snapping at his soon-to-be prized snack.
Sherlock glared at the detective inspector. "Don't patronise me, you know better than to do that."
someone with him.
Sherlock sputtered and started laughing really hard.
John swallowed loudly, of course he'd forget that he could still use his powers even if he wasn't really considered an imaginary spirit any more. Adjusting his eyes back to normal vision was easy, but that was what scared him. With "normal human" vision he couldn't see anything, just darkness, but how did the kid know he was there.
Minutes later John found himself in a sealed conference room with only one glass window. Thankfully he wasn't strapped down this time. He wished he had invisibility, which was usually unnecessary for a spirit, but it would really benefit him right now.
"I'm not telling you anything," John stubbornly replied.
Harriet Watson rolled her eyes, "Daniel, tell him he can't see me. And he talk to anybody else."
Which was weird because Lestrade didn't notice, only John did.
"Wha-" John blinked away the tears collecting in his eyes. The voice seemed to groan loudly before becoming silent again, but where was it coming from? None of the other people spoke after the last one asked how was he, so who?
, Violet assured herself as she watched her child scurry away holding onto thin air.
John stared with a mortified expression.
"Ah, Lestra-," He stopped when his eyes snapped open to a blue eyed, short blond at the door.
It couldn't be. Nobody was supposed to see him.
"B-?" Sherlock grinned at the blonde's mistake he knew more than he was saying.
"I don't know, I can't remember," Sherlock muttered.
As usual, I am updating again (yearly? that's bad). D:
"Ready when you are."
John Watson found himself standing right in front of a door of a building surrounded by police cars.
, wants to meet the Freak," Sally gestured violently at John like he was an imminent threat. Lestrade ran his hands over own face like it was the only thing left to smother his frustration.
He stayed broken for the rest of his time in that house, a completely different person. He wouldn't speak, eat, or communicate for weeks on end, doing nothing all day. The once happy face was now solemn, bleak--full of hate and annoyance. In that moment, on the midnight of January sixth, something was born.
The detective inspector smirked. "That was long before you entered my life."
Daniel was about to reply when John cut in, staring directly at Harriet Watson, "For God's sake Harriet, you called me here what do you want?"
Sherlock lifted his head up anxiously, finally something that wasn't boring, "Send him in."
. John only assumed it was just one kid within speaking age. This was serious.
John just noticed he barely made it out of the building.
John stared off as Sherlock left the room, this was it.
John smiled as he remembered some of Sherlock's first brilliant deductions.
And even though Lil Sherlock had bemoaned, he knew that he didn't really want to be like Myc. He wanted to be like John, and he was absolutely sure nothing in this world could separate him from John in a million years.  Not even in a billion! Take that, five-year-old math!
Sherlock chuckles and pauses when he heard Mrs Hudson's footsteps. He smiles at John when Mrs Hudson opens the door, her arms open wide.
"Turn around and put your hands on your head, Mr Watson."
He mentally apologised to Mrs H and was about to send a Type 2 Wipe before he heard a single command - 'Shoot.'
"End of meeting. The children have to go to their proper beds and John, go help the police. We have to go, you know the rules." Harry Watson sighed, "Find a place to stay, I'm worried about you." John stood up nodding, time limits were up.
John's help eventually leads to Mycroft.
"Did you see that?" The oldest child groaned into his pillow, "I knew this house had ghosts."
Oh wait, of course that's why.
John was clenching his left hand trying to rid of the pain,
did John know of that? As if the blond was caught in headlights, he quickly blurted out, "I mean... it
Should John take a risk and teach his egoistic flatmate a lesson? Would Lestrade or Mycroft ever hear the consulting duo?
It was a messy drawing of six stick-figures on a lawn with a smiley face sun on the right corner, on the left-hand corner written in black was Mycroft's name. One the page were two tall stick-figures which Sherlock quickly deduced was a rough sketch of their parents, but there were four kids.
John won't smile, he really doesn't want to. He knows
"Yes. But you're Different. I'll
"It's John, please," John said, hoping that the man didn't know anything about imaginary spirits.
John felt anger boiling within him, the energy was trying to escape. No one should judge a book by it's cover, first Sherlock and now small kids? Donovan had some guts to say such cruel things about people.
"What in the world happened to you?"
carry on," Donovan retorted.
The soldier's instincts were making him want to fight back but he stopped himself when he was half tossed into the living room where the epicentre for this chaos seemed to originate. Mrs. Hudson was sobbing on the couch he was sitting in hours ago, "John, oh John I tried to stop them..."
The grey words which had magically appeared, even to Sherlock's frustration, looked as if they were written by a child. Except Sherlock did not recognise whose writing it was.
Anderson was squirming in his chair at the moment, and John felt bad for him. Just a little bit. The guy was a trouble at times but- no he
"Shoot!" Lestrade ran back out to look for said stranger. Sherlock hummed as he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, waiting for Lestrade to come back with his person. Honestly, coming out once in a while was not bad.
"Lestrade sir, this
"Sherlock, you okay?" John's soft voice brought Sherlock back to reality, his head hurt like hell. What the in the world was that? It couldn't have been a flashback else Sherlock would have remembered what happened just then, deleted memories never come back. Ever.
John quickly spun around and exited the room, pulse ticking like a bomb. It really was not a good idea for Sherlock to find out who he is or was. He hurried past Donovan, rushed outside the house waiting for Sherlock to catch up.
Or kicked open. John flinched as the door made impact with the wall.
No, no, no, no, no, no- That wasn't right, it was supposed to be the other way around; John was the one punched in the face and he never punched anyone in the face at least a few minutes or hours ago.
"Watson," John murmured, "John Watson."
doors hit me?
"Stay
"No!"
, lovely really, having to run and drag an army doctor a whole two meters across the room. Large scaled, not miniature. Sherlock managed to reach their destination in record time; perhaps he should join the Olympics because he just ran what felt like 200 meters within 20 seconds flat
turn into a solid form, especially overnight; let alone change their overall appearance entirely.
John woke up to the rumbling sound of unwelcomed footsteps below the flat and Mrs Hudson's protests.
This was probably a large case, since Sherlock was participating; or John assumed.
"Twice."
He ended up solving that one too.
"John, it could've been the bird giggling-"
Mycroft's face showed signs of irritation but continue to hold his composure and walked up towards John before glancing down at the table briefly looking at a thin file. The blonde curiously tilted his head forward.
Sally squeaked out, "But-"
"You knew him, yet there is no such meeting recorded. You have never crossed paths before, yet you know even more than Sherlock does."
"They thought it was suicide, all of a sudden the police come again thinking murder," Bill frowned, "But I think I saw something. Maybe you can help tell them. Their Mum just came home, someone was with her. Vic needed the toilet and I travelled upstairs where the adults were, but it was darker than a closed closet. I could only make out the pill bottles and the man had a cap."
"Oi! Get out of the way, mate!"
Both opened slammed open the door to a long hallway. Halfway down the hollow interior, the lights flickered out.
"Who's Harry, kiddo?"
"Where, where's that guy," John's throat felt parched.
appreciate it when Mycroft kidnaps me," Sherlock sarcastically announced to the CCTV camera in between some old books making sure that his bothersome brother would get his message. Lestrade turned his head in that direction also and saw the small device, he walked over there and picked up the tiny camera.
Wow, haven't updated for over a whole freaking year. Sorry mates!
from John Watson. He is not supposed to be here."
Lestrade had already ordered food trying to convince Sherlock and John to eat, not like Sherlock was going to eat anyway.
He also can't help but wonder what kind of woman Martha Hudson was. No one could possibly still be sane with such a pair of wild tenants.
"He distinctly told me that, when you're hyped-up you tend to trip over a ton of cracks," Lestrade pointed out. "And you fell on your face while getting here."
The feeling of dread over-powered the sound of keys clattering on the floor.
a git, an idiot at that; Anderson always bullied Sherlock he didn't deserve any of John's pity.
Yeah?
"No!" the detective instinctively ran toward the figure. The one key, to his memories his child, everything would be gone if that man did not provide him the clue.
The now-small baffled doctor uttered in protest when Sherlock wrapped the rest of the flannel over him. Now it was a chase of
"Watson_Holmes holds an icepack and glares at the 'oh-so' innocent detective." ~fin.
"Look. I was looking for that dark haired man that just walked in," John grumbled as he felt the weight of his situation on his shoulders once again.
"Make me," Sherlock stated as he lifted up a chair.
"I'm not your informant, Sherlock," Lestrade growled.
Then again, with all the chaos going around right now it wasn't to hard for the guardian patron to become convinced that he was in another person's body, or his counterpart's body. Or be in a different world where he looked older, and was taller, and was visible to the human eye. They even shared the same status, even for imaginary standards.
*TF2: Oh boy, I wonder which class
Sherlock's mind was racing when Lestrade left. He nearly hissed, "Where in the world did you-"
Sherlock scowled, "Who?"
"Sherlock!" the DI hollered, "Come out. If this is your idea of a joke, I can swear it's not amusing." Silence was all that returned to Lestrade's ears. "Bloody hell, come out already, you've nearly scared Mrs Hudson to death!" Lestrade hoped that John Watson had a better conscious today (compared to the usual) and would stop Sherlock's shenanigans.
we'll be needing two," John blushed.
Revised: Part 2 (7/7/17) a/n: While I've nearly given up on adjusting such a complicated plot, and try to pull my life together; I've actually managed to catch up with Sherlock Season 4. Oh Boy. All I'm missing are the specials now.
Out of all curiosity, the consulting detective peeked his head out once more after hearing the voices dissipate; of all things it was getting late.
It also wasn't his fault when his 'clumsy' (actually severely disgusted) flatmate decided to disrupt his carefully calculated actions (along with other delicate experiments) by knocking over his test tubes and spilling a mass of dangerous chemicals all over both the consulting detective and doctor.
"I can't remember," John lied as Lestrade raised his brows.
He closed his eyes, and rubbed his temple waiting for Sherlock to say something. Nothing - he didn't hear anything. Frowning, he looked up and nearly jumped out of his chair. Sherlock's face was just inches away from his. Sherlock's hands shot out and grasped John's head firmly, using both thumbs to lift the corners of his mouth.
Why was John calling Sherlock by his surname again? Well, the doctor blames both the mouse trap and
Sherlock stared at the short blond headed stranger, and the blond stared back.
John's smile melted even more, and he swiftly wrapped the bracelet several times around his wrist, "Of course I'll keep it with me forever. I promise."
"Great, and maybe you can help me find out who he really is Mycroft," Sherlock drawled sarcastically.
to meet anyway, because there had to be at least
Sherlock couldn't control himself, John looking like a murderer? Definitely something that he can't imagine, an army doctor who wears fluffy jumpers running around looking like he just killed someone.
Hi, 'tis me. I completely screwed up the settings of this fic, and have avoided it ever since. Please feel free to read and comment as I try to re-adjust to writing again!
"Johnny? Answer me, is everything alright?"
The doctor glared at the menacing contraption and back at the flannel-wrapped Holmes.
Sherlock ran up to the next glass display and stared at the encapsulated complex puzzle, fascinated by its art. He had been running around with John all day, so the fatigue had finally caught up a few minutes later as he stood up slowly. Sherlock paused midway when he noticed John's fidgeting in the glass reflection.
"The murderer, I think the cabbie killed them."
Right, Harry probably thought that John was some normal human being who couldn't see imaginary friends.
Sherlock noted himself to categorise this into John's small yet growing file, and for the first time Sherlock relaxed and lets out a chuckle. Then the consulting detective looked down the road to where a police officer was apparently approaching the cab that they had just stopped in the middle of the road. The passenger got out and pointed at both of them.
"Can I go in or not? I work with kids everyday. If these children contain valuable information, it's not my fault you're not getting it," he bit back bitterly making Donovan flinch and step aside.
"I don't give a damn! This violates every law to-" a figure was shoved into the room.
"Nothing. Why don't we go outside?" John panicked brushing his trinket, "I got some information." John noticed Sherlock was staring at the trinket with a confused expression.
"Sherlock, no. We are not going through a window."
"Oi, freak," Sally probed, "What did you do to him? Is your 'sociopathy' becoming contagious? Although, come to think of it, we've all never seen John smile before."
John froze.
And there he was, with a cab literally inches away from running him over.
By now everything around the spirit was drowning out; John barely acknowledged the older Holmes' faux smile and that he was being escorted out the building.
Sherlock swatted the detective inspector's hand away and made a face. He noticed that John's eyes widened then softened at the mention of his name.
"Aw, come on," the blond wheezed through short gasps, "You're laughing too!" Sherlock's eyes flew wider when he realized there were two sets of giggling individuals in the room. The brunet accepted his fate and laid on the ground in a fit of giggles, and not even a minute later John collapsed on the floor along with him.
Angelo's.
"Sherlock," John groaned.
"Smile John."
The consulting detective had ripped the paper away from Lestrade, and glared at it. Nothing. That wasn't right, there
"Doctor Watson, what are you doing here in London?"
Apologies for not updating, (for about 8 months?).୧(•̀ ^ •́)୨
"You... sound weird."
The inanimate scrawny baby-like object, he guessed, was himself and that the other boy was Mycroft. The two other children however were a blonde boy and a dark-haired girl.
"It was very obvious, John," lil Sherlock spoke as loudly as he could, all while puffing his chest out in pride. He took ever one of John's compliments very seriously. After all, John was his best friend. Sherlock smirked, and only John knew about him the best.
"Hey Myc." John grinned evilly. He knew that the boy hated that name.
"So you're the guy who punched me in the face earlier?" John asked as he tiptoed to reach behind the lamp.
"John, you
teleport in his current form. Looking around checking for any people in sight, John slid into the nearest alleyway.
By now the group of people retreated back at a safe distance and were watching him, one person stepped forward cautiously. John was confused, why were they backing up from him.
Sherlock hated limited information he frowned at the blond and returned his attention to the window. "Look across the street. Taxi."
I went bluh, and just stopped, so I'm writing again to make-up this hiatus.
The detective inspector(DI) had invited Sherlock to dinner, and the world's only consulting detective gave in once Lestrade had managed to bribe him with another case. A cold case.
"Seriously, why does he always look so sad and plain all the time?" Sally Donovan frowned in John's direction. Everyone was catching their breath from the latest pun, even Sherlock had to control himself from laughing like an idiot.
"Please tell me this isn't another one of your spider on a tree tricks," Anderson grumbled as Sherlock shoved the lot down the stairs.
funny!" John flushed at his imaginary partner, "I'm not sure why I'm like this anyway, it's not my fault!"
"Why are you here?" Sherlock replied calmly.
"NonONononoNoNOnon- I'm not. I'm not-"
The face in front of him was older, the body taller. Too old and too tall. He comically grabbed both sides of his face and turned his head back and forth. The reflection did the same. John grabbed his arm and pinched, hard.
John sighed thinking of their stupid conversation in the car,
"Are there lights in the room? Can Mister turn them on?" The boy continued to stare past him.
I wanna rewrite this lol. Please bear with me, school life has absorbed me and I'm pretty sure this fic is over 6 to 7 years old. Pretty sure I made it when I was in middle school or junior high.
John woke up feeling groggy and lifted his head up from his chest.
he scares half of the living daylight out of people. That's just the way he smiles, he can't change it. John tried his best to glare at Sherlock, only to be rewarded with a wider grin.
"Will you keep it with you forever, then? Stay with me forever?" Sherlock grinned as he eagerly tugged at John's woolly jumper(sweater).
"Can we find a private place?" John shoved his hands in his pockets.
"If... you weren't born with springy legs!" Lestrade muttered aloud once he caught up.
Shoot did he say that out loud, John felt his blood freeze. Was it his blood anyway, was this now his body, did his thoughts even have any privacy any more? The spirit was just making himself more anxious and confused by the minute. It was already bad that he wasn't under normal imaginary spirit conditions, but this situation at the moment was even worse than before. Maybe, maybe some explanation was the best choice at the moment.
Lestrade slumped into John's chair in defeat and noticed that Donovan was already ordering the rest of the crew out of 221B. No, there has got to be another clue, anything to help the frustrated detective inspector right now who was pondering over Sherlock and John's disappearance. If this was not a prank, but how could he prove it?
like a girl and fainted when he saw the doctor's face, Sherlock instantly burst into a fit of laughter.
"I believe there's also one in your house, specifi-"
John placed a gentle kiss on the other man’s head. Suddenly Sherlock started fussing and John quickly pulled his hands away, thinking that the man had felt the kiss and was now waking up.
It was noon, the boys hadn’t had a case in a week.
In their sleep, the boys unconsciously snuggled together, searching for each other’s warmth.
When the boy saw Sherlock, he could FEEL his heart breaking. The other boy was strapped to his bed, sleeping. John sat down in the corner of the room and faced the bed.
“Oh, don't worry. There's all sorts 'round here. Mrs. Turner next door's got married ones,” the woman lingered on the doorstep for a second before turning away and going down the stairs. The flat was quiet for a second.
“Sherlock helps Scotland Yard with cases sometimes.” John raised an eyebrow at his roommate, this boy was interesting.
“It’s probably caught on the security tape, I can hack into the system and show you,”
John woke up in the intensive care room. He looked around the room and noticed a strange boy in the other bed.
“What do people normally say?”
“GET A ROOM!” he yelled and John heard awkward coughs. Sherlock closed the door.
John stood up and looked at the man.
“Sherlock?” he called out and the man’s eyes snapped open, “sorry to wake you. But can I get some painkillers? My head hurts like hell.” Sherlock jumped up and went out of the room.
“That’s my friend John,” Sherlock replied, “now if you don’t mind, let me get to my flat.” The woman stepped aside, a suggestive smirk playing on her lips.
“You seem likeable to me,” John exclaimed. Suddenly the door opened and a nurse stepped in.
“Oh what happened to you, dear?” the lady asked when he saw the condition of the young man’s face, “did the boys in your school do this?” Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat down onto the couch, there was no point in trying to escape Mrs Hudson.
“Mummy, John was the one who found me. We’re not together,” Sherlock whispered, guilt taking over his mind. Mrs Holmes pulled John into a tight hug.
Sherlock slowly stood up from his bed. John’s hands had felt so nice in the detective’s hair. Sherlock could feel his cheeks heating up when he thought of his blogger. He shook his head and pulled on his blue robe, going to the living room. He flopped into his armchair and went into his thinking position. He then went into his mind palace and into the room labelled John.
“Really?” the boy nodded, biting his lip anxiously, “what’s your name?”
Sherlock went into his bedroom and straight into bed. In a few minutes he was sleeping.
“You ready to play?” Greg said as he threw John his water bottle, “excellent reflexes, you’ll do.” At that, John burst out laughing, giving his friend a pat on the back.
“I’m sorry for crying,” John said, “I don’t know what came upon me.”
“Mummy is coming over in a few hours. She’s worried about you, you know,” he said and Sherlock rolled his eyes, “she was devastated when she heard that you had opened your wounds again.” The man looked at John.
“It was 6.20 when I came to your room,” John replied, subconsciously playing with Sherlock’s dark curls.
“That’s where I put my experiments,” Sherlock said this as if it was a casual thing, which it was, at least for him. When he saw John’s horrified face, he chuckled. “I’m going to start experimenting after breakfast,” he announced and John sighed, going back to cooking.
“You played against UCL, didn’t you?”
Sherlock noticed that his friend had stopped crying, and he was very happy. He didn’t like it when John cried, he felt so helpless. The man just wasn’t good with emotions.
But maybe his dear blogger had a crush on someone?
Sherlock shot up in his bed, tears running from his eyes and John shaking him.
Sherlock slowly stood up, brushing dirt off of his sleeves. He grabbed his backpack and stumbled back to his flat.
John put his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks, wiping away the other man’s tears with his thumbs.
“He’ll be released in two days,” a voice from behind both boys spoke and Sherlock visibly gritted his teeth. John shot him a glare, he didn’t know what his brother had done for him.
John brought their lips together. He could feel the other boy’s tears on his cheeks and he smiled, secretly vowing himself to always be there for him.
John had been completely unattached since Mary’s death, he would’ve told Sherlock if he had started dating somebody.
“Why are you apologising, you didn’t do anything wrong,” Sherlock looked at him, confused, trying to figure out what the other man was thinking.
Over the next 2 days, the boys had gotten really good friends. When it was time to leave the hospital, the were basically inseparable.
John unconsciously leaned into the touch, letting more tears fall. He wasn’t bothered by their proximity at all, he quite liked it to be honest.
“When are you not hungry, John?” Sherlock chuckled as he put down his violin and then stole a cookie from the pack located on John’s lap.
“I might have a few ideas,” he said, “you have heard of soulmates, right?” Without waiting for John’s answer, he continued. “Maybe something happened to your soulmate. I have heard and in fact, experienced, that if something happens to your soulmate, they get a scar for example, you get it too. It’s quite fascinating.” John looked at the boy in front of him with a raised eyebrow.
“Why?”
Suddenly he noticed that his friend’s eyes were squeezed together and he was shaking slightly. Memories from the hospital flooded back and John let go of the other man, facing away in shame.
“Don’t have TOO much fun, boys,” she yelled after them and quickly rushed into her flat.
Suddenly memories of shaking Sherlock took over John’s mind. The words ‘are you out of your mind’ echoed through his brain and he squeezed his eyes shut in terror. He had hurt Sherlock, hadn’t he?
Sherlock knew who sent the text when he read the word case and he smirked. It was Graham Lestrade, the son of one of Scotland Yard’s Detective Inspectors. He was always the one who texted him, since the boy’s dad hadn’t bothered to get his number yet.
John threw his arms around Sherlock and pulled him in for a tight hug. He could feel his friend wrap his hands around him and he smiled, both of the boys’ eyes tearing up.
He then heard Sherlock mumbling his name and his eyes widened. Was the man dreaming about him?
Sherlock’s mum came over 4 hours later.
“The last thing I remember is you shooting the wall-what happened afterwards?” the blogger could see his friend visibly gulping. Had something happened?
But John knew, it was because Sherlock was so affectionate, which made the man fall helplessly in love with him. He didn’t know how much would it take for him to break and snog his flatmate senseless.
“How have ya been mate?” Greg asked as he came to stand beside John’s bed.
“Graham has a scar on his arm, Mycroft has one in the same place, too. Also I could FEEL the sexual tension from the second that my dear brother entered the room. They probably won’t come back to the room.” At that, John burst out laughing.
“There are some cookies in the cupboards,” he heard Sherlock saying and the next second, the detective had gone back to playing his violin.
When the blogger turned around, Sherlock noticed that there were tears in his eyes.
“I would do anything to keep you safe, brother dear,” he whispered, “don’t you dare to think that you’re not worth it. Awfully lot of people care about you, even though they don’t show it, they still do.” Both of the brothers were tearing up.
John was in his bed….and they were cuddling.
“I’ll check if he’s okay,” Greg muttered and went out of the door. John turned towards Sherlock, his eyes widening.
“Can I go see him after I'm released?”
John observed Sherlock’s behaviour for the next 5 minutes or so. The younger man was slowly turning and mumbling ununderstandable words. Then he stopped turning and John resumed the movie, thinking that the detective was okay.
“After all those years,” the shorter boy whispered, “after all those years, you were the one.” Sherlock pulled back and placed his now shaking hands on John’s cheeks, wiping away some of the tears.
John wanted to say so much to Sherlock but he settled on a single action.
“Really? You two became friends very quickly then,” she exclaimed, an amused tone in her voice. She was still thinking that the boys were a couple.
“Don’t go,” he whispered and his blogger only nodded, hugging him once again.
“Bloody sentiment,” he thought, “messing with my brain.” He slowly stood up from the bed and pulled on his blue robe. He then went out to the livingroom and sat down onto his armchair, pulling his knees up to the chair.
“I don’t care what she thinks of me, what anyone thinks of me,” Sherlock growled, glaring at Mycroft, “if I was home SAFELY, I would take the nearest chair and hit you with it. Very hard.” That was enough for John.
“It’s Greg.”
“You haven’t done anything,” the blogger replied, smiling, “you haven’t done anything to upset me.”
John woke up in the middle of the night. He sat up and wandered, WHY exactly did he wake up. Then he realized, Sherlock was playing his violin once again.
“Well, have a nice day boys,” he said and left the flat.
“Yeah, how did you know?”
“They’ve always been like this. From the very start.”
“Whatever you want us to be.”
Hope the ending made you laugh ;)
“There’s a second bedroom upstairs. I’m pretty sure Hudders has already done the bed,” Sherlock replied and the other boy nodded.
Suddenly he heard quiet giggles. The boy turned his head in the direction where the noise was coming from and noticed a group of girls sitting on the grass and looking at them. He recognised only two of them, Mary and Marion, who was Mike’s girlfriend.
Sherlock stood up from his chair and grabbed the bag, walking into the kitchen. He opened the fridge and put the bag into it.
“Ah, Geoff-”
“I don’t need help. I can take care of myself perfectly fine,” Sherlock muttered. John growled, so the other boy had changed back to his arrogant self in mere seconds.
“ENOUGH SHERLOCK!” he yelled, clearly scaring the other boy, “YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK TO YOUR BROTHER LIKE THAT! YOU KNOW WHY YOU’RE ALIVE? BECAUSE MYCROFT HERE BOTHERED TO CAME HERE AT 3 IN THE MORNING AND GIVE THEM BLOOD. YOU WOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW IF IT WEREN’T FOR HIM.” Sherlock stared at his brother in agony.
Suddenly the door of their flat flew open and a very angry Mrs Hudson glared at the boys.
John was startled because of Sherlock’s sudden request. He thought, maybe Sherlock liked him back. But this was highly unlikely. The man was married to his work, after all.
Sherlock flopped down into his armchair and pulled his knees up to the chair, too. Only a moment later a fresh cup of coffee appeared in front of him. The man raised his head and took the mug from his friend’s hands, smiling up at him.
“What are you doing?” John looked at his friend, wide eyed, “why did you put it there?”
“Let’s not do that again,” John said to Sherlock and the other man nodded in agreement, “anyway, I’m going back to bed, you should do.”
John ignored the girls for the rest of the practise. As he was walking out of the stadium with Mike, he saw Mary approaching him. His friend sent him a cheeky grin and waved, then walking away.
“Wait, how do you two know each other?” he asked.
“Why?” John asked and gritted his teeth, “why did you do that?” Sherlock looked past the boy, biting his lip anxiously. John stepped closer to the bed.
“What are you experimenting on?” the boy asked, looking at his friend.
“I cut. Lost too much blood. Brother found me and called the ambulance,” the boy said and John raised his eyebrow.
“Mummy, stop it,” he growled and Violet burst into laughter.
Suddenly he heard Sherlock hissing in pain and he looked at his friend with concern.
“BORED!” Sherlock yelled as he flopped onto the sofa.
“I don’t help, I solve,” Sherlock stated, causing Greg to glare daggers at him.
Sherlock had once told him that he played the violin when he was thinking. John looked at the clock, it was only 4 in the morning, had the detective been awake all night or did he just wake up?
“No problem, Mrs Holmes.”
Suddenly the door opened and a man in a suit and an umbrella entered. Sherlock let out an audible groan.
“Seems interesting.” While John was talking with Sherlock, he hadn’t noticed that his hand was resting dangerously near the stove. He accidentally moved his hand right onto one of the plates and quickly pulled back. John quickly put his palm under the flowing water.
“That was Greg’s voice,” John said with a horrified expression and Sherlock let out a dark chuckle.
“Don’t try to stop me, John. Not right now.” Sherlock freed his hand and cut a tiny line onto his wrist. He watched as blood started flowing, a sudden sensation flowing through him. But he forced himself to ignore it.
“SHERLOCK!” he yelled and banged against the door, wincing as his left fist contacted the door. He soon realised that Sherlock won't open it so he had to break down the door.
“I’m sorry for waking you,” he whispered, tears clouding his vision.
“So, why were you put here?” John asked. His roommate suddenly got quiet and bit his lip. “You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”
“Yes I do. Very much.”
“I’m just a call away, you know,” the older man sighed, going out of the door.
“Oh god, the sight of them snogging. I’m scarred for life,” he exclaimed and John burst into laughter.
“I’m going to take care of you after you get released,” he said and the younger boy raised his head in confusion.
joining in.
“Oh...maybe some other day then?” Mary said and John nodded. She smiled, waving, and walking off.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary. It was quite extraordinary.”
“Let’s talk louder, that’s my brother who’s snogging him,” he said and gulped. As he said that, an another moan was heard, this time not Greg’s.
“Of course we’ll be needing two.”
“I love my William,” Violet spoke, “such a good boy, and I know his father would kill anyone who would harm him.” The woman sent a pointed look towards John.
“I hope they will feel better though.”
“Oh so now YOU’RE bored,” the man exclaimed, “I could shoot the wall right now.” Sherlock didn’t realize his mistake before he finished the sentence. When he did, he put away his cup and kneeled in front of John, taking his hands in his own.
“Like every…?” John started but suddenly he realized how quiet everything was. There were barely any sounds from outside. He could hear few cars in the distance. The usual chatter from the café below was completely missing and even the ever present pigeons had fallen silent. When John cautiously stepped closer to the window and took a look outside there were no passersby.
John's world was rocked by a touch on his mouth — a strange place, gentle. His eyes opened and took in nothing, none of the stillness and wrongness and disorienting not-Namness of the room. But there was a voice.
John's half-woody was trying to sneak itself into the groove at Sherlock's hip and thigh. Sherlock bent his knees lower to allow it. The roaring rushing of the warm water over them was doing things to John's resolve, and confusion nearly undid him, and he had nothing to say to Sherlock's mouth on his. Sherlock pulled away just a little, hot water streaming from his soaked, melting curls. "I brought you in here so we can clean up easy," he said into John's ear. "You can let go anytime. All over me."
Sherlock looked at him with rather a hurt expression. "So, considering we're working on your second choice here, I'm willing to answer your questions about my past."
every flake as it fell.
“We don't know yet. She's still experiencing severe hemorrhaging.”
Sherlock spent his time online and on his case, refusing to deal with the offer that Jon had just made, and how badly he wanted it. It's not like he didn't like sex. He did. He preferred it in clubs devoted to the purpose, with men whose names he never bothered to know. It wasn't frequent, it wasn't on his radar most of the time, but when it did pop up, he knew where to get it easily.
"Well, that too. I won't deny there's a little frisson of...mating. Ownership."
This is a little homage to
"I apologize. Go on. What happened that night?"
“What?”
"Show 'em in, I'm ready,"
John had learned by now it was best to be blunt in these situations. "Sorry, babe. I'm comin’ right back. But first I gotta piss like a racehorse."
It took him a moment to realize that
John rather liked seeing Sherlock biting any kind of thigh, and wanted to say something about that, but held his peace. And Sherlock continued to hold his piss.
Holmes palmed that blacked-out credit card into Holder’s hand and said quietly, “I strongly recommend you retire this. But only after you’ve made a hefty donation to an Indigenous fund, by your standards not mine. And if you want to shoot a nice tip my way I sure won’t say no.”
“What do you want, John?” Sherlock asked, nipping John’s right asscheek hard.
Sherlock laughed softly. That was good to see. Lines around his eyes suggested worry about something, and maybe that sorrow that comes with being reminded that as good as he was at solving problems, the cruelty of the world wasn't a clever thing, it was stupid and brutal.
"You promised," John said. "Just keep going, it's okay. It's not bad for you."
"Sure."
Who hunts the hunter?
In that moment he
“Just ask me if I wanna fuck. I always do. You don’t have to keep setting up these situations.”
“. . . All changed, changed utterly,” Sherlock said.
"And this involved letting him piss in your mouth."
good one. And Sherlock's fancy new Polaroid instant camera was
"That's the way of it sometimes," she said.
"What?"
“Then I'll handle it,” John said, reaching under the pillow where he knew that .38 was kept, and nudged up Sherlock's weight enough to place it on the nightstand.
"Mmm," John murmured finally. "I'm disgusting."
So John knew he’d wind up on his belly gasping and writhing as Sherlock ate him out with shamelessly wet and hungry fervor, and filthy little grunting noises as he fought for breath in the cleft of John’s ass, slick hot tongue working John's hole open.
He wanted Jon. Of course he did. How could anyone with any measure of attraction to men not want him? But Jon lived here. Jon was his best friend. He'd always been told: don't fuck where you sleep.
Quickly and adeptly as before, Sherlock leaped the rotting chestnut log and brought John back to the spot they'd excavated months earlier. Now he had more information, and he was spilling it quickly, like automatic gunfire. “Edie Saltire, nee Bedsaul, born January 12, 1900 – died August 27, 1922. Cause of death was postpartum infection following the birth of her second son Virgil. Virgil Saltire is buried two plots down. Died April 4, 1943. Killed in action in the European theatre of World War II. He was Kelly Milligan's fiancé, and it was here, on his grave, that her body was found. Approximately. The graves were not well-marked at the time.”
John pulled Sherlock against him once more, and kissed his way from Sherlock's throat up to his lips. "We should probably get back.  Got some washing to do."
Jon got up and paced around a little. "Irene seemed to think you played violin. That pretty bartender Nellie told me she said that. She deduced that from your hands or something. That true?"
Sherlock sucked in breath sharply with a little hiss. “You really
She started with a shock at the sight of a shadow in her sanctum.
"Yes."
“Yeah, I . . . kinda love it when you wax poetic about murder. It’s sexy.”
Greg looked at Molly apologetically. "Beaver

"That ain't an old cabin, that's a goddamned gardinel."
"At ease then," Sherlock said, stroking John's shoulders tenderly. "Deep breath."
This had the effect of agitating Holder even more. He let out a wail and lowered his face into his hands for a long time.
"I don't care what Mycroft wants," Sherlock said sharkishly, revealing what he’d stolen - along with two bottles of Dom Perignon -
New Year's Traditions - a little rimming, a little anal, a little gun-brandishing, some explosions...
“It's all over you,” John said incredulously. “Not just your clothes. What were you trying to
Holder just barely managed to shake Sherlock's hand before scarpering out.
“I go both ways, looks like,” John said.
“You're not really single, are you?”
John wandered back toward the bed, led by Sherlock, hand in hand. He'd only sat down on the edge of the bed when Sherlock dropped down to his knees and took his half-hard cock into his mouth, driving it up to full erection with one single vigorous pull of his lips. John groaned and spread his legs, leaning down on his elbows across the bed and just letting it happen.
"You met him while you were cruising
"That sounds scary as hell."
"I have more than that, but I need to talk to your son."
They had trundled up into the woods, with a picnic lunch packed. By far, the heaviest weight was the coolers, with a huge pitcher of Mrs Hudson's sweet tea and a six-pack of John's favorite beer. They pecked at the sandwiches and chips, talking and laughing. John sipped his beer slowly, while urging Sherlock to drink that cold, sweet, lightly lemon-tinged diuretic with great gusto.
Mycroft went into the bathroom and changed his clothes and hair and face completely. Then he walked onto the Mall where the AIDS memorial quilt was first unfurled, acres wide and long. With unerring direction and inside information, he found his way to the only patch he cared about – the one with the microscope and magnifying glass, skull and violin, and the name of his baby brother.
“No idea,” John muttered. “Better than you without one, I bet.”
"Is that...
Sort of a songfic - you'll be wanting this:
"That's one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me," Sherlock said, stripping completely nude and stepping coyly into the shower. John had to suppress his instincts towards the toilet. He followed Sherlock's lead and undressed completely, uncomfortable as he was with his half-mast that was mostly piss.
Sherlock frotted shamelessly against John's wet jeans - had to be getting off on having done that. It didn't take him long to lose all control and become a shivering wreck in John's arms, making even more of a mess of him with his come.  While Sherlock shook and recovered, John kept going with his own hand, pumping fiercely, chasing that sharp ecstasy. In moments, Sherlock's hand came down over his own, and then he was gone over the edge, dropping his head backwards and moaning. Christ, it was intense.
“Over my dead body.”
home. 221 Baker Street in Harlem was home. Not the home he'd expected, but the one where he belonged.
John was about to ask what possessed him, but thought better of it as Sherlock stalked from the shadows and embraced him from behind.
"It's very...intimate," Sherlock said.
"I won this round, John," Sherlock said, strong-arming him up the hill. The brush was still thick, though spiraling leaves from the tulip trees and the hickories swirled around them in the chilly breeze. The full moon veiled and unveiled in clouds.
And especially the bed, showered in petals that looked dark as bloodstains on the white sheets, rays of moonlight striping. “You - Sherlock, you -”
"Where-where did you get this?" Sherlock released the card into John's hands. Calloused; doctor?
The cost was ridiculous. £381.52. But it was worth it because John was worth it, Sherlock decided. And Sherlock needed him.
and that the rude detective is actually missing, only to be overheard and then lectured (quite harshly) by Lestrade.
Anyhow, have a happy reading! >:D
"Someone's in here," John whispered to his counterpart. He could feel the presence of his counterpart tense up as he edged closer to the centre of the small flat.
Sherlock managed to retrieve the phone without getting up. He supposed he had stretched a muscle in his arm, though.
“Do you actually know what it is?” The doctor asked raising his brows and looking steadily at his flat mate.
Stopping abruptly, he pulled John close.
