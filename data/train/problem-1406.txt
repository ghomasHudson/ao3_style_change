“Here, John it’s your favorite.”
Mycroft stood up in response, his whole body tense. Sherlock pulled the phone from his ear and looked at the screen. Mycroft leaned over and the video played. At that moment it felt as if the world had fallen around them.
i added this for fun, it's extra. No charge.
Now it had been two weeks and nothing. No sign of Moriarty, Sebastian Moran or John Watson. All traces of Moriarty just vanished into thin air. Even their informants had come up with nothing. Mycroft had anticipated some kind of negotiation from the mad Irish Omega, but there had been no contact.
“Don't talk. ” he manages, his voice hoarse but unquestionably steady. He is looking at the reflection of a ghost in the clear glass of the window. Not ready to face him, even after all these years. He notes sadly the sun has nearly set, the shadows dance across the buildings near by.
“Sssh, let me.” And blueish gray eyes, pupils wide stared in astonishment as the naked Alpha ran that same devilishly skilled wet muscular oral organ licked his calloused palm straight to his fingers. The Omega was panting a question on his lips, one that never quite made it further then an inaudible whimper. Because the Alpha with bright blue eyes and a devilish grin brought his hand back to it’s earlier ministrations.
“Did they really?” John looked up into the Alpha’s eyes, his hands hovering over Caleb’s upper thighs.
He's in pain, I know it's my fault.
thanks for hanging in there. Here's an update I have the next chapter ready just need a few more tweeks!
Remember friends you are never alone. If you're feeling like u need to talk if you cant reach out to friends or family there is the suicide hotline, dont give up! NEVER GIVE UP! YOU ARE LOVED YOU ARE IMPORTANT!
John nuzzled the taller man, offering comforting pheromones to the injured Alpha. “Your scent is wrong.” John couldn’t help but whine.
“Daddy!” A small voice broke the tension of the hospital room.
“John-” Sherlock stepped forward wanting answers that his mind already deduced. His heart was denying the truth that was so plainly written.
John's great escape slash rescue!
In the rain they shared their first kiss, warm heated, and beautiful.
, his name is
"The one time you forget your damn coat it has to be in nasty weather. No matter. We can make do."
Mycroft only held tighter to the child. He would keep them safe. No one would take Liam or Gregory from him. He would find John so Sherlock could hold his own pup and Mycroft Holmes would then see that all threats past present and future were neutralized.
And then with a growl the Alpha was sitting back panting spilling cords of white over Sherlock’s exposed belly and now limp penis.
THIS IS FOR gaarasgirl389, she said to continue well here go. Lets get John's memory back!!! Find me on Marylousfanfictionspace tumblr we are going to be doing some awesome stuff this spring.

“No. It doesn’t seem...well, I wouldn’t know how to…” John trailed off. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was trying to convey. He was making it sound like he wasn’t sure how to find an interested man, but that wasn’t really what had held him back.
“No.”
“What do you think?”
“What?”
~The end~
John laughed, shook his head, and finished his glass of wine. He brought their empty plates into the kitchen and rinsed them quickly. This was definitely a night for more wine, so when he returned to the main room, he poured another glass for himself and topped off Sherlock. Picking up the conversation where it left off, he said, “Well, Sherlock, you don’t have to be interested in every woman to be interested in ‘women’” — the air quotes were there — “You can be attracted to some people but not all people, you know.”
John watched this happen. He had learned to accept that this withdrawal on Sherlock’s part was due to his needing to consider his next move or, perhaps, to disengage from a situation he did not understand. John was sorry he had caused that need for contemplation over dinner; maybe he should pull back on the interrogation. He had never, ever felt as free to discuss himself and his own thoughts and past as he had with Sherlock over the last few weeks. But he may have pushed this too far. John finished the last bites of his pasta and salad, and took their plates in the kitchen. He had avoided having a drink during dinner, but poured himself a small glass of the respectable Scotch they kept in the cupboard. He could wait for Sherlock to stir.
John asks his next most important question.
“I have a feeling finding a willing ‘bloke’ would be fairly easy in a city of nine million people.”
“You know me well enough by now to know that may be an offer you regret shortly.”
“Why, then?”
By the time John and Sherlock hailed a cab to return to Baker Street, it was early evening. John looked at Sherlock with amazement. “I would take another case like that any day. We just changed a lot of lives in an hour in their house and got their daughter back. That was amazing.” Sherlock smirked, more pleased than he wanted to let on.
It was Sherlock’s turn to look out the window as he answered. “I would not classify any of my prior encounters as involving a girlfriend or a boyfriend. And, in different ways, none of them were very pleasant.”
John found it easier to continue by talking to his wine glass rather than meeting Sherlock’s eyes. “When I was in Afghanistan, I had a good friend, a good drinking buddy I got to know pretty well. In a war zone you get to know and trust people fast, or learn that you don’t want them around you at all. He and I clicked right away. He was a medic. We were both off duty one night, and had enough to drink that we were in that silly, stupid stage without being too far gone. We went out about 50 metres from the last outbuilding and sat against a big rock to look up at the stars and drink and talk. And then he just stopped talking and looked at me. It was definitely one of those moments like in films where you know there’s about to be a kiss and my brain started to kick in with some worry. Then he just said something like ‘I want you to watch me.’  And then he got off right there with me watching.” John closed his eyes for a moment, and exhaled slowly. “It was the single most erotic experience I’ve ever had.”
John rubbed his forehead, hoping both backseat riders survived at least to the bank. “Mycroft, I really don’t want to play games with you. You were not just randomly driving around London. You were waiting to talk to me, so talk.”
Sherlock had essentially always known that his mind did not process emotional connections in the same way others did. The “high functioning sociopath” label was not exactly accurate - a diagnosis from a time when Sherlock rather enjoyed verbally torturing care providers - but a good mystery had always had an appeal. Perhaps with some assistance from John he could solve some of the mysteries of his own life. He consciously matched John’s crooked smile from a few minutes ago and answered, “Let’s find out.”
Sherlock shook his head with some disbelief. “John, I thought you would understand that Mycroft is exactly the poster child for asexuality. At least I hope so.” Sherlock shuddered a bit.
“That wasn’t a question, but, yes. Your comments, however, aren’t hitting on the primary reasons I took the case.”
“Fine. I used to use. I don’t now. I met Lestrade on a crime scene and helped him solve the case, but I was high. He wouldn’t let me near another crime scene until I got clean. So now he feels he can use that against me when he needs some leverage over me, like he did tonight.”
“Sherlock!”
“I need to understand more about what happened with the drugs bust in your— our flat. I asked you if there was anything to find and you didn’t answer. As a doctor I can help with a past history, but I don’t want to risk my medical license getting busted for drugs for someone I met 24 hours ago.”
John saw a Barclay’s sign ahead, so thankfully he could end this conversation based on pure geography. “If this is your ‘hurt him and I’ll come for you’ speech, I don’t want it or need it. He’s fine. I’m fine. We don’t need your help or you lurking around the flat waiting to be my cabbie. Understand?”
Sherlock looked over towards John, who was trying a little too hard to keep his face neutral. He gave John an abbreviated version of the story, enough to to understand both the betrayal and to hint at an almost bigger question for Sherlock— that he had not been interested in touching David in that way.
John actually had been starving when Sherlock asked him to dinner. Starving, high on adrenaline, and curious. More curious than he could ever remember being. In just over 24 hours he had gone from an introduction to a total stranger, to living with that someone, to investigating a serial killer, to being a bystander in a “drugs bust,” — whatever the hell all that was about — to killing someone and laughing about it. So Chinese sounded really good.
John got up fairly early and came down from his room already dressed in his ratty “comfy” jumper, a button-down shirt, and jeans, made tea and toast, and got the paper. They had a quiet morning, John puttering around the flat, while Sherlock remained on the couch, thinking, and eating a piece of toast John made for him.
“I know how that feels. As a doctor and a soldier, we have to talk to people a lot, but I’ve always talked ‘at’ people, not really like this…”. John trailed off.
“Because that’s what flatmates do?”
“Yes, John, I do that a lot.”
“Great. Let me get my jacket.”
“I was hoping we could talk about both.”
“That’s fine, Sherlock, but I’m not sure there’s much you haven’t already figured out just by looking at the wrinkles on my shirt. You probably know what time I was born by the way I cut my hair or something.”
John smiled tightly. He had not yet gotten over the fine line between brother and archenemy. “That’s nice, Mycroft. You can drop me at the Barclay’s up there at…”
John pulled back slightly, surprised. Ah, Sherlock thought, he was convinced of the answer, and that the answer was there had been no prior sexual activity of any kind. John looked away for a moment, studying the street outside the restaurant window. “Well, I guess the first question is whether you have had a sexual relationship. I only say that because it seems like if you have never had a friend before, you aren’t likely to have had some dating type relationship with someone.”
John leaned against the counter and crossed his arms, settling in for what looked to be another puzzling Sherlock conversation. “Well, Sherlock, sometimes people just need a flatmate to pay part of the rent, and sometimes people actually don’t want to live alone, and want a mate or friend or whatever to watch football or go to the pub…and you still haven’t told me what the rent is. I also don’t have a job. And I am guessing that you don’t really go to pubs. So what caused your search for a flatmate?”
Sherlock thought for some time about John’s ridiculous rating scale, which hid his implicit request to talk about some potentially challenging topics. He had surprisingly enjoyed his “pub night” with John and talking through some of the areas he had long ago learned should not be discussed. He often knew what people would say to him, but he was learning that John was unpredictable. John also seemed to enjoy pushing the boundaries that Sherlock had built up over time. Unlike most people, in response to Sherlock’s odd personal history, John had offered neither meaningless advice nor pity. Sherlock was willing to see where this would play out. “That is a stupid scale, but to play your game, 6.94 is the atomic weight of lithium. That seems like a good starting point.”
John noted that Sherlock’s comment was fairly ambiguous on the gender of his partners. He had no idea what that signified, whether Sherlock had chosen male partners and had regrets or just bad experiences. Maybe he had tried his luck with one or more female partners and apparently also did not care to repeat those efforts. Sherlock’s comment certainly raised a lot of questions, and John thought Sherlock might actually be ready to talk about or even work through some of those experiences. They were done with dinner, and John thought any more of this conversation should probably take place at Baker Street. He caught Sherlock’s eye and said “Let’s get the check and head home, yeah?”
John crossed his arms and looked at Sherlock. He was fairly sure that, by way of normal conversational rules, Sherlock should go next. He also was fairly sure that Sherlock was expecting a rude comment on his cat concerto, and John was not willing to play that game.
“I did indeed,” John said with a crooked smile.
John was right. John could not live as his flatmate if at any moment New Scotland Yard could stage another drugs bust, risking John’s future more than Sherlock’s. Having an illegal firearm created potential problems too. It had the downside of being much harder to hide, but the added benefit of the protection it would provide. And a secondary benefit of having an owner who actually knew how to use it. Perhaps a compromise was in order.
“How much detail do you want?”
“No, but that sounds like something Mycroft would say.”
Sherlock sat in his preferred chair. He finally spoke. “Fine, John. Read the email and try to deduce it. Ask me some questions.” John nodded and sat in what was now “his” chair, quietly pleased that Sherlock was willing to talk through something that might help him understand a few more aspects of how that super genius brain worked. John read, and re-read the email several times.
Even though John knew that Sherlock had always lived his life according to his own set of rules — at least as much as was more or less allowed by laws and society — he also knew that having a big brother impacted your life and your choices. It also seemed to be a good opportunity to discuss his choice for his afternoon research activity. “Sherlock, are you familiar with the term asexual?”
John rolled his eyes. “So why did you decide to get a flatmate?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed a bit. “And you asked me to go to this pub with you tonight.”
Sherlock again went still, processing that information. John was nearly done with his pint, so he finished it, pointed to it and the bar, and went to get pint number three for both of them. When John returned, Sherlock’s eyes tracked his hand movements as he set the new glasses down.
John felt a bizarre need to share something he had never told anyone before, something he had not fully processed. After a few gulps from his glass and a top-off, he settled back and looked thoughtfully at Sherlock, who was quite good at staring back. “Can I share with you something I haven’t told anyone? It’s — well, it’s not like your story — but it isn’t really…” John trailed off, starting to lose his courage.
Sherlock rubbed his lips with a gloved finger, not eager to share the part of the parents’ description of the missing girl that had moved him to take the case. He simply decided not to answer and hoped that would be that.
A case hits a little close to home.
Sherlock looked away again and said quietly, “No, I had someone I thought was my first friend betray me.”
“No, but they do involve talking to people to see if they would be compatible for dates, and having sex after they seem at least somewhat...interested.”  John thought for a moment. “And I suppose they have to be somewhat interesting.”
John was starting to form some ideas about the whole “Sherlock-friend” issue that had nothing to do with the detective’s crazed lifestyle. He was also starting to sigh more frequently.
Sherlock looked at John sharply. “What does ‘ahhhh’...mean?”
John thought that was an odd way to say goodnight, but the whole evening had been odd. Wonderfully odd.
Ah, thought Sherlock. That narrowed down John’s concerns significantly.
“I have every reason to believe you are a good doctor. That is among the reasons you went with me to that crime scene.”
They ate for a few minutes in thoughtful silence. As John finished his dinner, and looked at the clock, he thought that he had no idea whether he had much more emotional energy for soul sharing tonight. Sherlock surprised him by saying, “I tried to have sex with a woman in uni.”
Want to see more from ohlooktheresabee?
Sherlock’s phone beeped with a text, and Sherlock sat up on the couch to respond to it. “A text from Lestrade. He has questions on a case we had a few months ago. Do you want to come with me to the Yard?”
“Don’t be silly, John. I also need someone to buy the milk. And I have Mrs. Hudson, although her willingness to make tea decreases dramatically by the third visit of the day.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Really? Please feel free to ask me something not quite as patently obvious.”
Sherlock looked intently at John in what John was starting to think of as his “deducing” mode. After several moments, Sherlock said, “What made you move from a pattern of serious relationships to casual sex?”
Sherlock looked down as he fidgeted with the empty glass he was holding and, frowning, said, “I believed for a number of years that I was asexual like Mycroft. He and I have stood apart from other people as long as I can remember. And my one experience with someone at university was the only time I was interested sexually in another person. I am not as sure now what to call myself.”
“Why did you happen to mention looking for a flatmate to Mike?”
“You don’t make it very easy on anyone,” John said quietly, fidgeting a bit and unsure of himself. John thought that part of the appeal of a drink was just having something to do with his hands. He flopped them around his lap fairly uselessly now that Sherlock had stolen his glass. He wasn’t sure what else to say that wouldn't spook Sherlock, so he just stayed quiet and hoped Sherlock would go on.
John watched as a hint of Sherlock’s usual countenance began to shine through. He stood taller, held his head higher, and his eyes flashed around the room with shaper intuitiveness. He marveled at the change. While collared, Sherlock was still himself. Still, the brilliant and observant man John had come to know so well. But collared, he was softer around the edges, less harsh, and John couldn’t help but wonder if that was the change Sherlock was seeking.
“I’ll see that they get the best support money can offer, John,” Mycroft said with a nod. “In the meantime, if you and my brother are up for it, there are a few leads we still need to track down. Some of the individuals have been sold off into countries where neither myself nor the Met has jurisdiction. However, as you two never seem to take the law into account…”
John let out a short, clear laugh then continued. “He kept glancing from me to the notepad. It was clear he expected me to explain myself, to explain what my intentions were with you. Like he was your father, and we were teen lovers.” John rolled his eyes again, this time at Mycroft’s behalf. “I just crossed my arms over my chest and stared at the wall behind him. I used the time to make a shopping list in my head.”
The worst of the high was beginning to fade by the time someone came to check on him. Sherlock’s mouth felt like it had been packed with cotton, his throat ached for something to drink, and his head was pounding. Every noise seemed ten times louder to him. Something like rusty hinges screeched and Sherlock felt as if someone had ground broken glass straight onto his brain.
John dismissed the message without replying and pocketed his mobile. A quick inspection showed that Mycroft had been correct, so with a careful kiss to the top of Sherlock's head, John made his excuses.
Holmes brothers at the same game. Perhaps, he could have the aid of Mycroft at his back, while supporting Sherlock with his plan. Rather than run around half informed.
“I do, Sir. Thank you for your trust.” Sherlock watched, unblinking, as the leather band wrapped around his wrist. It was only slightly thicker than his watchband, and immediately he welcomed the new sensation.
“Who knows, with Mycroft. Does he even know what sex is?” John asked teasingly.
“What, we stick together, us soulless.” Matt laughed.
“I don’t plan on it, if I’m honest,” Zed laughed, taking John’s hand and giving it a hearty shake. “Wasn’t sure I’d ever see your face again, not here. Not after reading your blog. You’ve taken up with an interesting man, Watson.”
“Baker Street,” John laughed, sliding his hands off of Sherlock’s shoulder, down his arm until their fingers were clasped together. “Just the end is fine; we can walk from there.”
“John…” Sherlock whispered haltingly as one of his hands sought out John’s leg.
John walked for a few more steps, aware that with each splash of his shoes against the pavement, his feet were growing damp.
“Wait, isn’t he supposed to call you ‘Master’ or something?” Greg asked with a confused tilt of his head. “He’s not… Well he’s just himself. You all are.”
“I want a hit before I get home. As you keep the lighting in your shop so dim, I don’t trust a needle.”
The sound of the shower curtain sliding down the rod sent a shiver down Sherlock’s back. He’d begun to slouch while waiting, and his hands had both shifted, palm down on his thighs. Cursing himself for slipping, he corrected his posture and held his head high, displaying the collar and John’s army tags. He heard the sound of a towel being pulled free from its rod. John’s footsteps then plodded around the bathroom. The sink turned on, and sounds of John brushing his teeth sent a stab of impatience through Sherlock.
John shuddered. The movement did not go unnoticed by Mycroft.
“Hot.” Sherlock finished for him. Rising to his feet the detective glided over to him with feline-like grace. Coming to stand behind John, Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist, sliding his fingers over his hips and down his thighs. He rested his chin on John’s shoulder while staring at his reflection, “I might not allow you to wear anything but these ever again.”
“Fuck…” John swore, tipping a bottle back to let the last dregs of beer drip into his mouth.
Time ticked by with no real meaning. Sherlock’s awareness slipped into the narrow scope of John. Of his fingers clacking against the keys and of his aching muscles. His erection, or any sexual hold his punishment had initially granted, was long gone. Replaced with the knowledge that John was promising to be an extraordinary dominant partner.
“So, you want a short leash?” John asked, “Figuratively, or literally?”
A lot of my head bashing against the wall would have been a lot more painful for me if Sara hadn't been around to tell me if my ideas sucked, or if I had a pothole. (Which she did catch!!!!)
“My job is to teach men that ‘mansplaining’ is not sexy,” She says, chastising Zed with a smoldering look. Zed lowered his eyes to the floor and blew a hard breath out through pursed lips.
John snapped his head in the direction of the cry and skipped the next door, opting for the second door on his left instead. His foot met with hard wood with all the force in his body, and the door shattered into pieces. Two more kicks shook the latch free, granting him access to the room beyond. The scene before him wrenched a growl from his throat. Two men, one kneeling, one standing, were positioned against the far wall. The man standing had his back to him. Sherlock, however, watched John with wide eyes as he stalked into the room.
“Yes, Captain.”
“Jesus…” John gaped, his jaw hung open as he stared at the man in front of him. “Every time I think there’s no possible way you can outdo yourself with your next outfit. But every damn time you prove me wrong.”
“What?”
The cold case turns hot, a string of previously unconnected housebreakings and rapes becoming a pattern under Sherlock’s scrutiny, every three years, with one imminent. Rapid footwork, Sherlock’s deductions, and some esoteric medical knowledge from John prevent it in the nick of time. They arrive home, flushed and triumphant.
“Thank you,” John said. “See you in the morning?”
Sherlock picks up a small paring knife from a bin of them by the counter and toys with it. “Well, that’s very noble of you but I’m sure I could never survive on that. And I’ll never give up my leather.” He winks a bit naughtily at the man, who fails to notice completely.
This time they take the scan with John first out of view and then where Sherlock can see him, to compare his brain pattern when he's "seeing" and not.
John thanks him and shuts the door behind him, letting out a long breath of air. Victor is kind and sincere, but being around him is both too tempting and too painful to contemplate right now. But it is a comfort to know that there's someone else out there, loving Sherlock too.
"Christ, John, I could have killed you!" Greg exclaims after John just barely stops the DI from firing at him in the shadows. "When did you get so damned dramatic?"
John gapes at him. "I... I mean, we needed to be sure that... it could have... the dilution..."
“Look, when you started things with me, did you do it because you couldn’t help it? Did chemicals make you?”
"Why are you pulling for him?" John asks after breakfast, as they both collect their things for the day. "You know what it did to me when...when he left."
John snorts. “All right, yes. But at the risk of fatally inflating your ego further, there’s not a woman out there that has a chance either. So take it down a notch.”
She sniffs and looks past him to Sherlock. “You know who
Her calm certainty does make the tightness in John’s throat ease, just a bit, and he murmurs a thank you and kisses her on the cheek before continuing on, just as quickly but slightly less frantic than before.
Victor's expression flickers like he's trying to master some emotion, but returns quickly to normal. "I'm sorry Sherlock, I have no idea. It may have been a family name, or maybe he just met someone with that name or read it in a book. It’s not uncommon. I never had a chance to ask and I'm not sure I wanted to know at the time in any case."
“Advantage?” Sherlock snaps, offended.
,” Moriarty said smoothly. “In fact, a less formidable man would be much,
It’s all too easy for John to haul back and deliver a roundhouse to Greg's jaw. He pulls it, because his full force can do quite serious damage. But not by much. Not as much as he could have and still been convincing.
“Yes. I mean no, sorry.” John shakes his head to clear it. “Didn’t sleep well. What was that?”
“Come on, John, bedroom,
"And if I do die? You'll tell him--"
John feels his climax begin to swell with this additional stimulation and makes no attempt to delay it, rutting back urgently against Sherlock and working himself more deeply into his large, dextrous hand by turns. He feels Sherlock’s tongue along his spine now, and the taller man is mouthing words into his skin that he can’t decipher but knows are urging him on.
No sooner has Sherlock gotten Mrs. Hudson calmed down, sent her to bed with a generous dose of "soother", and installed himself back in his own flat, than he has a visitor. It’s well past midnight and he knows from the first step in the hall instantly who it is.
He handed her several bottles of prescription painkillers, given to him by the doctor. She looked surprised but didn't say anything, only scrutinized the labels. Sherlock added, “If you count you will find that the number of pills in the bottles matches the number printed on the bottles.”
It goes on like that for hours, Sherlock trying to think his way out of the hysteria and almost making it, but the darkness is still there, no longer a thing that lurks in the back of his psyche, tightly under guard, but now literally surrounding him, fully manifested in a way he can't flee, ignore, or fight. What he wouldn't give for any kind of opiate right now, anything to slow him down. If there were some in the flat, he'd probably succumb, calling it medical necessity, but he can hardly ask John. Saying it was for the pain in his ankle would never work. John knows a junkie's gambit when he hears it.
John shot awake, startled. “Lie back down, you’re not well,” he managed, willing his heart rate to return to normal. Sherlock must have been dreaming.
Sherlock nods his acceptance and John runs a hand through his hair.
“It looks worse than it is,” Sherlock said dismissively. “Tie him up before he wakes. There must be medical supplies around here somewhere. What happened to the rest of the guards?”
Then he feels John’s hand on his arms, squeezing with equal pressure. “But,” he says huskily, “I think maybe we can start over.”
Sherlock focuses on him. “Yes,” he manages, fuzzily.
“I really don’t. He’ll only meddle.”
“And I’m not? There’s truth in madness too. What of mine could he possibly burn?”
"I did think of contacting his immediate family after his remains were... returned to them. But I fear contact with me might only add to their distress."
“No. It started in the abattoir, when you first showed up on the killing floor. You were so bright, like your own solar system. I tried to tell you.”
He feels Sherlock cock his head, and continues.
“93. She was 93, almost 94,” Sherlock corrects.
“I am taking it perfectly easy,” Sherlock said, fixing his pale eyes on the quivering guard. “You on the other hand seem quite agitated. Panicked even. Are you quite well?”
The golden god that is John shrugs. YOUR MIND IS ALREADY ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING IN A WAY THAT INVOLVES OTHER SENSES, SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASIEST CONNEXION TO MAKE. SAME WITH ME – THAT PATHWAY WAS ALREADY THERE AND NEVER REALLY HAD MUCH TO DO WITH YOUR SIGHT. MAYBE IT JUST NEEDED TO BE REACTIVATED. SEEING OTHER THINGS MIGHT FOLLOW AS YOUR BRAIN ADJUSTS. HEARING TOO. YOU MIGHT HEAL YOURSELF IN TIME.
John finally arrives home mid-morning and collapses on the sofa. When he wakes, Mrs. Hudson brings him a hot meal, for which he is eternally grateful. Between the stun grenade and the fighting he’s quite sore, and feels a bit aimless without a case. He eats heartily and takes a long soak, which revives him, but he’s still not quite sure what to do with himself.
Sherlock flashes him a brief, genuine smile. “Good, John. Police are saying it was poison. I need you to go to the morgue and confirm for me – I texted Molly to expect you.”
What matters most is that John is here, in 221B, almost constantly. And if Mary’s here nearly as much, he finds he doesn’t mind it as greatly as he should. Or at least as much as Mycroft snidely implies he should.
“It’s not like you’ve never been wrong before,” Anderson adds. “Maybe you just need to get used to it.”
Sherlock tenses beneath his head and he feels guilty for destroying the moment, but there hasn’t been any other time lately that he could get Sherlock to be still and listen. John can nearly hear the gears in his mind grind as he tries to comprehend what John is saying to him.
Slowly Sherlock realises what John is telling him and a tiny, pleased smile makes its way to his lips. He shifts Rosie onto his hip. “John Watson, are you proposing to me?”
“I’m serious. I don’t care what happens or why, don’t ever shut me out like that again.”
Sherlock looks less than convinced and John crosses the room and climbs onto the bed, pushing Sherlock back gently against the pillows.
Sherlock ignores him. “In any case that man was clearly not capable of stabbing someone once, much less repeatedly and viciously. Terrified of blood, physically weak, and I found wool fibres at the scene that didn’t match the victim’s clothes and certainly weren’t from him.”
“Friesland?” John rolls the unfamiliar word around in his mouth.
“It’s possible though,” Sherlock presses.
Once in fighting mode Sherlock's as capable as John, if not as powerfully destructive. But he's a fraction of a second too slow getting there, and in spotting the second assailant. Despite getting a few good hits in, he's quickly overcome and rendered unconscious by another efficient blow from the field hockey stick to the base of his skull.
He says not a word to John about the week’s events, about Ms. Adler’s reappearance, about what they said in the warehouse, but that night he is the man John knows again. Viciously protective, cheerfully callous, brilliant and maddening all at once. John is grateful, even if he resents that the one he has to be grateful to is the one who caused it all in the first place. Sherlock still won’t talk about her, not even to acknowledge her existence, but he plays for John, Auld Lang Syne, and wishes him a happy new year, and John takes the crumb offered and tries to let it all go.
“You slept here last night.”
“Okay. And what do you
They sleep together, when Sherlock does sleep, usually in John’s bed, despite Sherlock’s being both larger and nicer. For Sherlock’s part, this is because he finds being surrounded by John’s scent and the detritus of his life both reassuring and sexy. For John’s part, it is because he hopes the extra set of stairs will prevent their long-suffering landlady from being woken by their exertions at all hours of the night, even if there is no hope of her breakfast not being interrupted by the morning shag in the shower.
This is not going to be easy. John tries again, rolling on his side so he can look at Sherlock properly. “I know this has been an unusually long and difficult case, and I’m sure things will get better when it’s over. But it’s not just this case, it’s a lot of things. I’m…concerned.”
” and then below:
"I'm not dead!"
The figure steps into an anaemic patch of light and there is no doubt left in his mind. John forces himself not to run, walking as quickly and determinedly across the distance between them as he can manage, trying to keep tears out of his eyes. He stops a few feet in front of his friend, looking him up and down desperately. He is whole, unharmed, unchanged, right down to the coat and the scarf and the way his curls fall across his forehead.
He’s on his third when his mobile rings. He ignores it, not even bothering to look. It goes to voicemail but starts ringing again. The fourth time he answers, only for the satisfaction of saying “Sod off!”
Sherlock licks his lips. “I need her to exist. That’s why I saved her. She’s like… my equal and opposite force. She’s the balance to me in the universe, what might have been. Not like Moriarty. He’s what I could become but mustn’t. And not like you. You’re my complement, my other half.”
“Greg.”
“Okay?”
“No, you’re a drug addict!” John snaps.
"Like... Like a cut out of yourself. But fluid. Like molten gold. I can make out your features, faintly, your expressions, when you’re close."
Somehow, this is far more alarming than when John was berating him. John’s aura is crackling and flickering, like he’s conflicted.
John walks into the bedroom quietly. Sherlock is lounging on the bed in pyjamas bottoms and an inside out t-shirt, eyes closed but not asleep.
John tsk-tsks at him and approaches the counter, where their wan, rather ungainly target has been listening to the conversation.
“You got him to clear the charges?”
He tries to keep it out of his voice and eyes as he tells them to dance, but Mary’s realised it and seen that he has as well, and it pains her. John hasn’t yet and might not for a long time, might even fight it, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Sherlock had been prepared to sacrifice so much for John, and still would do, but this sacrifice, this kind of rift between them he hadn’t seen coming.
John grumbles but realises he also hasn’t eaten since breakfast and slowly gets up and collects himself to go out. “I thought you didn’t eat while you were working.”
S-H-E-R-L-O-C-K-?  S-H-E-R-L-O-C-K-?
THERE’S SOMETHING.
Sherlock releases him, pushing him away in revulsion. Moriarty stumbles, laughing for real this time. "You're delusional," Sherlock spits, turning away.
“Yeah, I kind of noticed that,” John said, rubbing the cut on his head. “And I could ask you the same damn thing. What do you think you’re playing at, running straight into a trap after I specifically asked you… you promised me…”
Every so often, after a long period of working without rest or after a string of particularly difficult cases, Sherlock Holmes will stay in bed for several days and do basically nothing. This has happened twice that John knows of since they met, both times prior to the redefinition of their friendship. The first time he had been certain Sherlock had the flu, and the second he had assumed your basic falling-off-the wagon bender. But neither had been the case.
"You're right, John," Sherlock says evenly.
“What did I have to do with it? What did he say?”
Once the first rush of emotion had been excised and John had managed to hold back most of his tears, at least in front of Sherlock, there was the explanation, the apology, the ensuing guilt on John’s part for ever doubting Sherlock, the assessment of Sherlock’s physical condition (not well, too skinny, new scars), and the stern mother-henning, which involved hot food, tea, and ordering Sherlock to the bath, then bed.
again,” a high pitched male voice said. “Isn’t it getting a bit
“What, tell them he can’t have done it because he was with us the whole time, at the scene of the crime?” John asks.
“It’s dark in here,” Sherlock complains, even though his bedroom is well lit enough.
“Warn me,” Sherlock called after him. “When you release him. I need time.”
“Not bad, John. But lots of people go in and out of an office, and there are cleaners. They wanted to be certain they got Bryant’s cells, his DNA, his hair, and no chance of contamination with anyone else’s.”
"I'm sorry," Sherlock whispers, swallowing hard. "Tell me how... tell me what..."
“I have to.”
“We’ll find him,” John said confidently. “Or someone will. The entire police force and half the government is looking for him now. He may be smart, but he can’t hide forever.”
“Well, it did get us a free bottle of wine, John,” Sherlock says smoothly, speeding up just enough so he knows John has to trot to keep up.
,” he shakes the papers in Sherlocks direction, “is just paperwork? Are you really so--” He bites his tongue with a sound of angry frustration and Sherlock can see him working to control himself.
“Not actually,” Sherlock says finally, his voice rough and halting. “The normal routine wasn’t working. I needed something more. I just needed something to feel good again.”
“How could you?” he demands. Sherlock turns around with only mild surprise and looks at him innocently. “He was unconscious, he wasn’t a threat anymore.”
“Enough!” said Moran, putting his glass down on the table with more force than was necessary. “You’ve had your fun there, and whether you are right or wrong really couldn’t matter less to me. You are in my power, you have something I want, and you’re going to give it to me. Or things will go very badly for you.”
“Because of details, John! Now, tell me everything.” Sherlock hunkers down across from John and turns his full attention on him, as usual both unsettling and flattering.
When, after only brief moments, John jerks back, pushing Sherlock off him, it's like having a limb amputated without warning - numb and disorienting at first, then unbearable. The distance between them is worse than on their first reunion, now all the more hurtful for those few seconds of intimacy. John is panting, holding him at bay with body language that is at once screaming hungry desperation and violent rejection.
John reins himself in and does as he's asked. She's still trying to seduce Sherlock, and John's still fuming, but Sherlock is off in another world. Something about John's answer sparked a new train of thought and he's lost to both of them now, probably for some time, wandering into the sitting room and picking at his violin.
He'll have to tell John, he realises. He would have had to at some point anyway, and he'll need John to help figure out what's happened and why, and hopefully reverse it. It might as well be now and reduce the risk of his own nervous system pushing him over the brink as well. He's far too near it as things stands.
“I did,” she stutters. “I would… I am. I just… we have to be realistic…”
"No surveillance inside. Not surprising. They won't want anything found when the police search his house."
“Sherlock… what do you see when you look at Irene Adler?”
“Well, I suppose we must play along, if this is how things are to be,” she said. “But it still doesn’t mean I believe it. And you had another question for me, I think.”
John is indeed gaining on the man, with Sherlock just keeping up when everything goes dark. Completely dark, like a light switch being flipped in a windowless room. Before Sherlock can even fully register what's happened, he stumbles and slams into the pavement.
Sherlock! John was certain of it. And he had been alive and well as of two weeks ago. “Did he leave you a name or way to contact him?”
He looks up from the papers at Sherlock, pleasantly surprised, and he smiles in the way that gives him fairy-light crinkles around his eyes and Sherlock actual gooseflesh at the approval. “That was… good.” He reaches out to touch Sherlock’s arm, but halts suddenly and examines Sherlock with a mix of confusion and suspicion.
Sherlock relaxes and settles against him. “As long as you’ll have me,” he whispers.
MERCURY CAUSES SENSORY DISABILITIES. BUT NOT IN THESE AMOUNTS. YOU’D HAVE MORE IN YOUR SYSTEM AFTER BINGING ON SUSHI.
She smiles. "I'd expect nothing less. And if you could do, I wouldn't deserve him."
John tries to not to panic, coming up with places Sherlock might have popped off to for just a moment. Innocuous places like the corner shop or Scotland Yard. It doesn’t work. He scans the flat for a clue to Sherlock’s whereabouts. There is no trace of where he’s gone, but some of the evidence on the mirror over the fireplace has been rearranged, new notes written over the pictures. He must have figured something out in the night.
John feels a blind fury bubbling up, even as panic dances across Sherlock’s face and then is quickly suppressed. “Are you going to check that?” John asks in his coolest and most even tone.
There was a flash of genuine fear in Mycroft’s eyes. “You saw and felt what Sherlock wanted to you to see and feel, apparently,” Mycroft told him.
“See, that’s the difference between us, darling. I don’t care about
Sherlock shrugs sullenly and slides himself down the opposite wall to the floor, mirroring John’s position but with his feet halfway up the wall next to John. They sit silently for a moment. He’d been so fired up to have it out in a dramatic fashion, but he hadn’t expected the sight of John looking so worn and a little sad. The desire for an argument curdles into its own kind of exhaustion.
“Are we?” he asked.
Hanna is not taken entirely unawares when John finally makes it to the crew berth below the bridge. Perhaps she’d heard the struggling or noticed the resultant too-quietness once her men were down. Either way, when he enters she’s half concealed herself behind a bulkhead and has a crossbow pointed at the door.
First he hobbles then he runs. He hears a shot, and shattering glass, but it’s not from Sherlock’s pistol. He forgets his injury as he races down flights of stairs, heedless of traps. He’s ended up in the front of the house now, grand sweeping staircase and large windows before him. He spies the murderer outside on what passes for a lawn, with a rifle, having just shot at Sherlock through the window.
John finds himself blushing. Praise from Sherlock is rare, and never this blatant. And he is standing too close, dangerously close. “Well, I was pretty impressive,” he admits, faking bravado.
"Damn it, he went up!" He hears John curse from somewhere up ahead. "We'll never be a match for him on the roofs. Bloody acrobat."
“Can’t,” Sherlock says shortly.
“Well, none of us can escape our upbringing, not really,” John says, patting him on the arm carefully. “Family parties always seem to bring out the best in people. You’re smoking, I’m drunk…let’s go home before someone ends up in tears, shall we?”
Sherlock finds himself on the other side of the door, too distracted by what Mary had just said to pay attention to how he got back into the hall. He feels dazed.
Suddenly there a loud noise in his left ear and a spray of wetness on the side of his face. Already wired, Sherlock jumps practically out of his skin and turns to the source, ready to defend himself.
Sherlock manages to pick up on his tone and backpedals. “That’s not what I… I just meant I know you’re not like that…”
John's been trying to ignore it, the pain in his leg. In his thigh. The imaginary wound in the place he had shot that young boy. He hasn't felt it in the slightest since the second day he spent with Sherlock, except for a twinge once when he finally told his friend the story. He's been gritting his teeth and refusing to limp, refusing to take pain medicine, refusing to admit it's back again to anyone. It takes all his energy, but at least the physical pain is a distraction from the emotional pain. Even though that's really just in his head too.
that shape, even hundreds of metres away, even in darkness, even though it is impossible. He freezes, feeling his knees go weak, afraid to go any closer, afraid it might vanish or he might find his mind is playing tricks on him. “Sherlock,” he breathes.
Sherlock is typically calmed by sex, particularly after playing the submissive, but this is a surprising degree of mellowness even by that standard. John decides that this, if not an actual good time to bring it up, is the best he’s likely to get for awhile.
The project takes most of the week to complete, and John gets virtually no rest during the process, but thankfully it’s done in time for Sherlock to return home six days later. He bursts in, completely unannounced as usual, and sinks into his chair.
about me. Well, what I
similar.” Sherlock had lost him in the gloom, but could still detect the sound of his footprints, circling.
“Not quite.” Moran stood and stalked the room lazily. “I’m going to add another player into the mix. Take a page out of Jim’s book, since that was so very effective last time. You see, very shortly, perhaps already, my people will have their hands on one Dr. John Watson, and they have orders to bring him straight here, to me. To us. Won’t you be happy to be reunited with your…friend?”
In early December, the labyrinthine, medieval city is cold, claustrophobic, and aggressively damp. Under other circumstances he might admire the sturdiness and enduring design of the ancient workmanship. As man in hiding who prefers to have a quick exit handy, he finds the habit of streets ending suddenly in high walls or unmapped canals less than charming. Still, the layout could be useful for confounding pursuers, provided it didn't confound him first.
Sherlock paused and examined himself. “Quite right, John,” he agreed. He grabbed his coat off the hook, stuffed something in the pocket, and tightened it around himself. He adjusted his scarf. “Much better. What would I do without you?”
He resolved to wait no more than ten minutes for a reply before calling Mycroft. Or Lestrade. Or going out to search himself. Something. Sitting here like this was madness. But he barely had time to decide on a course of action before a response quickly came.
John finds out the answer to whether or not Sherlock was really oblivious to his trip when his phone begins playing reveille at the highest volume setting at three am Monday morning, and refuses to be silenced. John has to smother it with a pillow until the battery runs down. He doesn’t mind nearly as much as he should.
He can feel John fidget uncomfortably. "Yes. There are a few things it could be that are serious. I mean, more serious than losing your vision permanently."
A week passes. A week in which John tries to adjust to an empty bed, a flatmate who no longer quite belongs to him, and a mountain of things that cannot be said. It seems easy for Sherlock, so effortless, for him to step back out of their romantic relationship, to turn back the clock and return to simple partnership and companionship. John knows it probably isn’t really effortless for Sherlock, but it feels that way and it hurts.
“Well?” John said coldly.
John interrupts this depressing string of can'ts. "We'll go in tonight, at 11 pm. Molly knows a guy and the place will be all but deserted."
Sherlock locks his grey eyes on John’s dark blue ones, unblinking. He opens his mouth and for one terrible moment John thinks he’s actually going to say it. But instead he closes his mouth and leans his forehead against John’s, defeated. John lets out a breath he hadn’t even known he was holding. He puts his hands to Sherlock’s face.
He finds himself face to face with Abel Bryant. Only…not. The man is of the same height and build as their client dressed in the same style, with the same flaming red hair and slight thinning at the crown. But it’s not him.
“Yes.”
John pushes inside him with no warning, merciless, slicked only with saliva, and it hurts but it’s also like sparks going off inside his head, the closest thing to light he’s had for days. And John is so warm, he'd forgotten how warm. John's heat warms him from the inside, melting away the pain. John’s hand on his hip is digging into Sherlock's flesh and his other twists tighter into Sherlock’s hair, as John begins to move, thrusting slowly at first, but hard and deep, as deep as he can go, like he's trying to exorcise whatever demon is within Sherlock.
On Thursday morning John wakes up, as usual, in Sherlock’s bed, with the atypical addition of the detective still sprawled next to him, fast asleep. John moves to get up, trying not to disturb Sherlock, but even the slight shifting of weight on the mattress is enough.
Wait. There is no response.
“If you must know, yes. For some strange reason I seemed to be off my game tonight. How was the cadaver?”
John swivels to stare at him, momentarily floored.
The trial is arranged with startling speed, even given the high profile nature of the case and the magnitude of the evidence against Moriarty. It is only a few weeks before Sherlock is on his way to court to testify, only a couple more days before Moriarty is free again.
“How fast can you do this?” John whispers breathlessly.
John turns back towards him. “That’s one way of putting it, yes.”
“So once again, the drugs got more and more appealing,” John finishes.
“Where’s John?” he demanded.
John does as he is told, though his words are fumbling and he cringes at sporadic intervals as though a bomb has just gone off. He's dripping with sweat now. Sherlock gives his mouth rapt attention, afraid he'll misread something but knowing John is in no condition to code and read at the same time right now.
In response, Sherlock slides another finger into him, searching for his prostate while still smearing his thumb across John's sensitive perineum. John cries out when Sherlock brushes against the gland. He frees his legs and throws them over Sherlock's shoulders, tilting his hips up, inviting Sherlock in.
“You can owe me.” He could feel her breath on his cheek. She was so beautiful, so vital. Everything lately had been death and darkness. He longed for someone to make him feel alive.
“The shipment comes in?”
“Don’t worry, Sherlock, it’s going to be fine,” he says, his hands steady on the skinny leg.
“Ah.” Sherlock turns to go and John returns to his unpacking, feeling bone weary, wanting to just sleep off the emotional exhaustion of the past couple days.
“It might.” He steeples his fingers.
Since that first time, John has let Sherlock come to him. Not every night, but more nights than not he ends up in John’s bed, taking pleasure, taking comfort as he can. John isn’t sure if Sherlock has actually abandoned his internal struggle against the desires of the flesh or if he’s just losing it regularly. John is afraid to push him, sensing the conflict still in him on some level, afraid that if he attempts to initiate when Sherlock is not in the right mental place for it he will spook him, drive him off.
“Why?” asked Sherlock, cocking his head.
“No, I’m angry because you got
Sherlock is even more bewildered now but decides to address what has been presented to him. "You won't have to be. I'm better now. You fixed me."
“If I didn’t ‘wander in’ here all the time, this place would never be clean and you’d never have fresh food in, but if you’re tired of that I am happy to not be your housekeeper. Especially as I’m
“No. Do you?”
Sherlock shifts awkwardly. He's grown nearly as comfortable with Mary as with John over the past months, but between the venue and the stiffness of his morning dress he can't quite shake the feeling that he shouldn't be here. "You...asked to see me?"
John demurs, which is strange because showering together is one of his favourite things, but he consents to stay in the room. He's still and quiet, obviously thinking about something, but Sherlock can still make out his comforting glow through the shower curtain, even if it is dimmed. To add to the strangeness, once Sherlock is clean, he immediately finds that he's exhausted while John insists he's not tired. Sherlock flags this additionally as extremely odd, but is too worn out to ponder it and ends up collapsing on the sofa, dead to the world in mere minutes while John sits up and reads, still near enough to be seen. His embers warm Sherlock's mind as he sleeps.
Sherlock claps him on the upper arm, grins, and disappears, leaving John shaking his head tolerantly.
"How do you know?"
John put his hands to his temples. “I’m going out,” he says quietly, wondering if Sherlock will even notice. He doesn’t. He’s absorbed in his playing, lost in a world that seems further from John than ever.
“It’s Christmas. I have to wear the jumper, Sherlock. Think of it as a present for you.”
Sherlock nods curtly, as if the effort has exhausted his ability to speak for awhile. Both fall silent. John closes his eyes, enjoying the feeling of Sherlock breathing against him.
“Sorry, my fingers are always freezing,” Molly says, her voice oozing pity. “John’s making copies of the scan and then is going to consult with his doctor friend. Can’t imagine she’s thrilled at being dragged down here this time of night. Anyway, do you want to wait in the lab… or I can take you home, if you like?”
John wasn’t sure, but he thought Sherlock might have just told him he loved him. He pulled Sherlock closer in response, crushing him against his chest and breathing in his scent, deodorant and soap and sweat and sex all mingled together. After a moment, John said lightly, “I’ll be lucky if I can walk tomorrow, you know.”
He left out mention of last night’s events. Mycroft didn’t need to know. A moment later a reply came.
John looks down into the heart-shaped face, soft and snub-nosed, framed by wild obsidian curls. Her very earnest attempt to appear obedient and submissive is belied by the current of nervous excitement she can’t quite disguise and a slight upturning at the corners of her mouth that speaks to nothing so much as Sherlock when he’s plotting something.  “Um… well…” She blinks up at him sweetly from under dark lashes and he melts. “We’ve decided…that… you may go out with Trevor. But there are going to be some rules.”
John could hardly begrudge her that. Now she fussed over John like he was the only thing she had left in the world. Maybe he was. He tolerated her attentions, appreciated them even, but did not have the emotional energy to give her much back. She seemed happy enough just to have him there. She had tidied the flat in his absence, but had left his and Sherlock’s things largely untouched. He felt like a ghost in his own home, moving silently through the rooms, unwilling or unable to change or get rid anything.
John isn’t sure whether to be annoyed or glad when his New Year’s plans are hijacked by, for all appearances, Mycroft. Despite his worry, he’s not contacted the elder Holmes for advice. It would feel petulant and disloyal, and Sherlock wouldn’t thank him for it. But on some level, he’s glad that Mycroft has finally decided to insert himself into the situation, freeing him from having to decide to do it himself.
John speeds up, ruthless, his hand around Sherlock like iron and his cock burning within Sherlock's thawing body. But then John he leans forward and puts his mouth to the small of Sherlock’s back, using his tongue flick out the letters, wanting to make sure he's in Sherlock's head, too.
"Well, I'm new at it. Anyway, you still haven't told me how I can make up ruinning your day."
“This is beyond, even for him.” John filled her in on the details of the past few days, and their conversation this morning.
“Hallucinogenic gas was hardly my idea,” Sherlock replies mildly.
This what he needs to keep in his mind in order to be Sherlock Holmes, to do what he has to do to make it a reality.
“John, your shoulder!” he says more urgently. John looks down. His shoulder, not
That was how Lestrade’s men found them, twenty minutes later: The tall, thin detective draped over the army doctor, shielding him from the elements with every fiber of his slender body. The Detective Inspector had to physically pry Sherlock off of his friend – he was delirious, and further into hypothermia than John. John’s wool jumper and the shelter Sherlock had provided had helped him retain some heat, while Sherlock had been wearing cotton (which sapped heat from a body when wet), was exposed to the wind, and had virtually no body fat to help him conserve warmth.
"Horrifyingly, yes. They have a long-standing arrangement.”
But why hadn’t Sherlock just given it to Europol and let them do the work, John wondered. He could have sent it anonymously, if he was worried about being exposed as still alive or that he wouldn’t be believed. It was true there was nothing there to blatantly clear Sherlock’s name – though obviously Moriarty’s, his name was frustratingly absent from the actual data. Sherlock must have meant to confront Moran with the information and use it to bargain for proof of his own innocence. Although given how things had turned out, a plan involving Moran’s death seemed more likely.
"I see. Thank you for telling me. Will you please hand me my violin?"
Sherlock hesitates for a fraction of a second and then obeys. She sleepily twines her arms around Sherlock’s neck as he lifts her, holding her close but little uncertainly.
He plans to do all those things, but realises he also wants to do something for Sherlock, something to surprise him with on his return. He’s just not sure what.
John opened his phone.
Sleeping with Sherlock is both simpler and more of a headache than John anticipated. On the one hand, much of the framework is already there – they live together, work together, and Sherlock has John trained to do most of the domestic chores. People already think they are a couple, and they don’t mention the change in status to anyone, although at least poor Mrs. Hudson downstairs must know, as the walls and floors are none too thick, and Sherlock tends to be both loud and unconcerned about what they might be doing to her nerves.
Sherlock snorts. “Of course not. He knows something is going on, but he’s choosing to let you handle it for the time being. You will be watched, though.”
“Better. Like a Venusian volcano. The lights of an oncoming train. A Catherine wheel at midnight,” Sherlock murmurs sleepily.
Molly shudders again at the anger in his voice. “John, I swear I tried to stop him, to at least wait for you. But Mycroft had his will. There was an overriding clause in it that in case of death by…by…suicide… the body was to be turned over to Mycroft Holmes immediately, without examination or consultation of the inheritor… of you… I’m sorry…”
“All right!” John cuts him off, both embarrassed and pleased. “I should never have doubted you.”
safety, not anyone else’s. It’s my business. I’m as careful as I want to be. Besides,” he adds harshly, “I’m careful with
quickly that you wouldn’t even know until it had gone.”
John leans against the wall, slumping, unable to quite hold himself up anymore. Molly gets cautiously to her feet. “John, I can’t even tell you…” She puts a hand on his forearm and speaks with a gentle voice, more confident than she sounds normally. “I can only imagine what you must be feeling.”
Of course. “Well?”
He throws his arms wide, expansively, on the bed and commands, "Sherlock Holmes, tell me you love me!"
There is some pain, more discomfort than true pain, and the more he relaxes the more it ebbs away in favour of the pleasure. Sherlock switches his grip and strokes John with his free hand, and John fumbles to return the gesture, certain he is doing a terrible job given the addled state of his brain. But Sherlock doesn’t complain, and in fact fairly purrs at his touch.
ALL THE HEAVY METALS, YES. DO YOU THINK IT’S A POISON?
John ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t want to find out the answer to that. Do you?”
“That will all be smoothed over with your employer, of course.”
Eventually John reaches the place where he physically can not cry any longer. As a doctor he understand the exact mechanisms that cause the tears to run out and the tightness in the chest to grow to the point where nothing else can come, but at the moment all he knows is that he feels hollowed out, empty and fragile and sharp as an eggshell. He realises he is gripping Molly’s hand to a point that must be painful, though she has not tried to move, and eases up.
John goes to him, blinking back tears as he checks the detective over and helps him sit up. Sherlock is conscious, but disoriented. The wounds on his arms, three or four short cuts on each, aren’t deep, clearly made by the discarded razor blade on the floor next to him. They are fresh and bleeding profusely as shallow cuts tend to do. “Sherlock, can you hear me?” John asks. There is a glass of water near the bed and he dips the corner of the bed sheet into it and wipes away as much of the blood as he can.
“What did they take?” Sherlock asks Bryant, running his finger through the dust on a still-intact grandfather clock.
“Well, what did he say?”
“Dublin. The conference. Honestly, I told you ten times and put it on the wall chart and
"You can make what choices you like. You can choose your own warped version of good over my vision of greatness. You can stay in your safe flat with your single minded little soldier. You can make each other all the promises you like. But I promise you, John Watson will not have you. I'll make you break his heart. Or I'll break him. Your choice, Sherlock. Isn't it nice to have choices? Make yours carefully, you won't have a chance to take it back."
“It’s nothing of importance, just time sensitive. In fact I should probably be going now,” he says, getting up and gathering his coat and mobile.
Sherlock purses his lips. “All right. John will go to your place of work on Monday to see what he can find. As you seem to be in no immediate danger I think it’s best if you continue to act as normally as possible. This may take some time. And for God’s sake, start keeping track of who these mysterious people you’re seeing are and whether the same people are showing up multiple times. Pay attention instead of panicking, I mean honestly what on earth has been going through your brain for the past six—”
“You won’t be saying that when you try to get out of here alive. You and your friend.” After that there is silence.
Lestrade sighed. “He’s just down the hall.”
All three stare at him in varying degrees of shock, and John steps back next to his friend and falls silent, still glaring, daring anyone to contradict him. Finally Lestrade says, “All right, Sherlock, if he didn’t do it, who did?”
To John’s surprise he looks conciliatory. "It’s how I work, when I'm working out a theory... You know that. I can’t always explain when I’m in process."
"You selfish bastard!" John yells, loud enough to wake the neighbours. "You put me through exactly what you were too cowardly to risk yourself. It was never about keeping me safe, it was always about you, what you needed, you complete, unreserved arsehole!"
John laughed, and pulled Sherlock back to him, encircling his waist with his arms. “There’s no rush!” he told him, kissing him again, revelling in the feel of Sherlock’s slender body in his grasp.
“Sex, John,” Sherlock replies, irritated. “I had thought that was obvious.”
"I doubt it, not very much cause to look at brain activity in dead people. But she can probably find a technician who has no idea who you are and schedule it at time when no one will be around. I won't put your name on anything. Molly can run the blood tests through the lab anonymously and I'll show Caroline the scans after you've gone. You'll be my Patient 1, that's it. And no one who knows you will think anything of you being at Bart's at odd hours. Good enough?"
“Oh, God, yes,” John moans.
“Oh, please, enlighten me,” Sherlock snarls. “Tell me what I’m doing because I could otherwise have no possible way of knowing my own mind!”
“Sherlock, when you’ve got a minute!” John shouts and then puts his head down and rams his opponent full force in the stomach, slamming him into another nearby pallet hard enough to keep him down for at least a few seconds. He jumps back so all four are in front of him and pulls out his Sig. “Stop! Right where you are, hands where I can see them.”
“But you didn’t feel like you had to,” Sherlock presses. “You wanted to, you had hormonal urges, but you thought about it and made a decision. You told me that. And you could have decided it was a bad idea and walked away. You, John Watson, decided you wanted me, as I am, not some fuzzy idealized version of me. And I decided the same. Neither one of us has to be someone we’re not or pretend anything. Despite our respective powerful urges, we walked in with clear eyes, we each made a choice. That’s why it’s better.” He looks exhausted from having to explain this to John.
“I am well aware of that,” Mycroft sniffed. “But you have it, whether you like it or not. You know, even with all my influence we won’t be able to hold him forever. He’s got too many friends, too much money, too many people who owe him. I can’t just make him disappear, at least not for very long, not unless I get something concrete out of him. Is there anything I should know?”
John shakes his head sympathetically.
“Not something I'm liable to forget.”
harder to destroy. Now as for the rest of your heart…well I think we both know where that is, and I must say, Sherlock, I’m just a
"Sherlock, what I'm trying to say is that I’m grateful, above all things, to know that no matter what happens, John will always have at least one person who loves him as fiercely and completely as I do, and would do anything to protect him. That's the most important thing to me. Do you understand?"
Bryant’s townhouse is older, but in a nice neighbourhood, and very well kept up. He meets them at the door, looking haggard and nervous.
“I’m always cautious.” Sherlock pauses and sees this outright lie is not enough for John. “I’ll try,” he says at last.
He can feel Sherlock’s satisfied smirk and grins too. He allows his hand to drift upward and is rewarded by Sherlock’s own change of breathing and body temperature. “Sherlock?”
“What? No. What are you talking about; of course you’ll be here. Where else would you be?”
“So, that’s it. Moriarty’s gone, it’s every woman for herself, network dissolved, end of story?”
It’s an opening. A chance to say one of the many things he’s been holding back, uncertain of the other man’s reaction. A chance to get out before his life becomes any madder, any more the property of Sherlock Holmes. He should run now, save them both the heartbreak. He should speak his feelings, give Sherlock a chance to change his mind. He should jump him and kiss him into oblivion. There are a million things he should do right now, before his friend walks out that door and signs those papers.
“Then where is he? Show him to me.” John’s eyes light on the door to the autopsy room, behind Molly. “No, don’t tell me you’re that stupid!” he exclaims, and jumps for it.
"You're easing up. You've poured more oil in the centre of my back and you're running your fingers very slowly down my spine to the top of my buttocks." Sherlock sighs involuntarily as a shiver of pleasure runs along the path traced by John's hands. "Now you're smiling at my reaction; your knees are squeezing me noticeably tighter and your pulse is elevated."
“Not this whole time,” Mycroft protested. “He only got in contact with me about a month ago. I thought  he was dead the same as you, although I certainly had some suspicions. I still don’t know how he managed it. He wouldn’t tell me, and even with my intellect I haven’t been able to puzzle it out. I think he enjoys making me struggle.”
Two hours after leaving Baker Street for a nearby, perfectly serviceable pub that Sherlock had never set foot in, Sherlock had actually eaten one piece of fish, four chips, and had much of two pints. He had not eaten or drunk that much at a pub in several years. He told John the Mrs. Hudson story. He told several early crime scene stories (with a few deletions of details because John still seemed sensitive to some of his earlier years of drug use). And John was still interested in and, more surprisingly, had asked for more information on the people involved, the observations, and the science behind some of his deductions. Toxic metalloids featured prominently in one of the crimes, and John had asked several insightful questions about the neurological damage caused by exposure. Sherlock could not recall the last time he had talked to someone this much, and there was some chance that he had never talked with someone this much. If it had happened at all, he had either deleted it or he had been high, in which case the recipient of the information may or may not have been entirely conscious.
“Nothing...I just don’t expect you to make food.”
Mycroft smiled knowingly. “I would greatly prefer not to be a cabbie around you, John.”
John couldn't help but laugh at Sherlock’s snarkiness. There was almost no limit to what Sherlock would say to pick on his brother. The comment of “Don’t start a war on your way home” floated through John’s mind.
“Yes.”
“Sherlock!”
John’s face was surprisingly neutral. “And I want to stay a good doctor.”
Sherlock smiled in his own sarcastic way, and asked, “Is that what friends are for?”
Want to see more from helloliriels?
“Seems a little late to ask me that, after you have just finished moving in.”
John signed, and opened the door, flopping into the car. He had not seen Mycroft since the evening everything went to hell with the serial killer. “Good morning, Mycroft. Not any wars to start today?”
John didn’t actually mind the quiet. He didn’t want to engage in whatever deep thoughts Sherlock was apparently involved in, so cooking was a good, mindless activity to occupy himself with. Eventually, he had everything ready, and called over to Sherlock to try to wake him out of whatever trance he had worked himself into.
John sighed a bit because he realized he was heading into tricky territory. Ever since Donovan, who was quite unpleasant, and Mycroft, who was also quite unpleasant, told John that Sherlock didn’t have friends, John had tried to puzzle out what exactly that meant. At this point, he had more respect for Sherlock than either Donovan or Mycroft, but it was odd that both of them had chosen to have a very similar discussion with him at almost the same time. Of course, Sherlock’s comments at Angelo’s about girlfriends and boyfriends hadn’t helped much either, but that conversation could wait for another day … or another month.
“Sherlock,” John ventured quietly, “If you would like to talk about that, I would be honoured to listen to what you tell me.”
That was not his only time with Jacob, but each successive time seemed to have more expectations and unwritten rules that Sherlock did not understand. Jacob was not much better, and within a matter of less than two weeks Jacob had not very subtly let Sherlock know that he was not interested in an actual relationship. Apparently, that was also Jacob’s way of completely breaking off what Sherlock had thought was the beginnings of a real friendship. Jacob made it clear that everything from occasional sex to studying together was out of the question. Sherlock was miserable for weeks. He tried to determine what he had done wrong and could not find anything, other than his own hopeless lack of social awareness. He did not have any great drive to be around other human beings, but he did not want to completely cut himself off from connections either. A few months later, he decided to try his rather embarrassingly awful experiment with the woman he picked up in a bar. That was the last time that Sherlock made any effort to have any sexual contact with another human being. It was the last time he had been tempted to... until very recently.
Towards noon, John announced he was running to the market and had some errands. He had not yet been able to have his allowance from his military pay deposited in the correct account. The day was unseasonably warm and sunny, so John pulled off his jumper and tossed it aside on the chair near the door as he walked out of the flat. Just in case, John grabbed his light jacket — this was London in early Spring — and headed to the bank. Sherlock listened to his footsteps down the stairs and heard the downstairs door close. He looked at John’s favorite jumper, thrown inelegantly in a pile on the chair. He sat up and walked over to the chair, reaching out slowly for the jumper. Bringing it up to his face, he pressed it firmly into his nose and cheeks, inhaling. Because it was a favorite to be worn mostly around the flat jumper, it was not frequently washed. It smelled of John’s shampoo, tea and a musky, somewhat sweaty maleness. Sherlock leaned slightly against the desk. He had not felt this physical urge to be close to another person in over a decade, and was not sure whether he wanted to listen to the very clear signals from his transport. Sherlock’s deduction skills did not extend to his own needs as precisely as they did to outside data. He never entirely understood if he did not attempt sexual relations, or even casual sex, because he didn’t actually need it to function quite well in his chosen lifestyle, or if he had just learned to deprive himself. He obviously needed to eat to survive, and had just trained his body to fast when he wanted to avoid the distractions of food. Sex was not as clearly a requirement as food. He put the jumper back in its place, and retreated to the couch to evaluate his...bloody hell...his feelings.
“Nope.”
“That actually makes perfect sense, which shouldn’t surprise me by now. So...what about wanting to make a new, uh, a new someone to...
John was happy to be fully moved out of that miserable bedsit, even if it meant moving aside a beaker with indeterminable contents to have tea. Or marking containers to identify human and non-human remains in the refrigerator. Wonderful, he was already thinking of meat as “non-human remains.” He actually rather liked the skulls, as they reminded him of medical school. He still was curious about virtually everything regarding Sherlock because it was hard to believe that Sherlock had ever lived with an actual breathing person before or that he would choose to do so now. John walked by Sherlock into the kitchen looking for something edible.
John had enjoyed pub night with Sherlock. He thought he understood how rare the concept of “pub night” had been in Sherlock’s life, but he wasn’t quite sure how to “find out” if Sherlock was able to form a friendship with someone. By Sherlock’s age that ship should have sailed and, in any normal life, it would have sailed dozens of times. And there should also have been double-digit crushes on or sexual relationships with — well, someone. John still hadn’t quite processed the whole “girlfriends aren’t my area but no boyfriend” comment. If Sherlock hadn’t ever had a friend, then Sherlock most likely had never had a lover, although sexual experimentation certainly didn’t require friendship. Hell, the mere fact that it was called “experimentation” was probably appealing to Sherlock.
A few weeks later, Sherlock received an email about a private case involving a missing teenager. The distraught parents included a lengthy description of their only child, Liz, with a description of her only close friend and all known recent activities. The parents seemed very detail-oriented; the mother was an economist for an international bank and the father was a history teacher. Liz was a good student and it didn’t seem that she had caused or gotten into much trouble in her life. A CCTV camera captured her leaving school one day, but the trail went cold a few blocks away as there were few cameras in this part of London. Because Missing Persons wasn’t Lestrade’s division, there was a limit to how much information Sherlock could get from the Yard without calling in a favor from Lestrade, and it was premature for that. Sherlock agreed to take the case and set a time to talk to the parents. John came with him, and Liz’s friend met them as well. Sherlock was grateful for John’s ability to casually talk to the rank and file of humanity; he was hopeless with these emotional interviews. Trying to talk to a teenage girl was also far outside his comfort zone. Although Sherlock struggled with empathy and emotional connection on his best days, any missing persons case carried with it a pressure that most murders didn’t — a disturbingly short window to solve it before it could become yet another murder investigation. Neither the parents nor the Yard had found anything suspect on the girl’s mobile or laptop, which had both been left in her bedroom. That of course was itself suspicious as few teens would leave a mobile, indicating to the parents that she was not a runaway. The mobile also had fairly benign contents; most people, even relatively innocent teenage girls, would likely have had a few more questionable items in the search history or on social media. A question of John’s confirmed some of Sherlock’s deductions - the missing girl lied to the friend about having lost the mobile sitting on the coffee table and claimed she had gotten a new one. A few more questions by Sherlock identified a family acquaintance who lived in the neighborhood and who left his wife and family several weeks ago to move to far north London. Sherlock was confident that an investigation into his credit charges would show a recent mobile purchase to communicate with Liz, and they would find the teen in his company. Sherlock made a phone call to the officer at the Yard handling the matter to share the information. He was not always popular with officers, but few of them completely ignored his insights.
“Mycroft in no way used the phrase ‘killer cabbie.’ Perhaps you should have considered ‘The Case of the Killer Cabbie’ for your blog title instead of ‘Study in Pink.’  More accurate. Alliteration is widely used by newspapers in desperate need of attention.”
“Hmmm...Any hints?”
A game of truth…or truth.
“John, really.”
John was quickly coming to understand just how problematic a bored Sherlock could be. Sherlock had moved on from an afternoon of fairly dramatic violin pieces (after the third “what is that you are playing” from John, Sherlock muttered “Shostakovich”) to something that sounded like alley cats mating. John had no idea how Mrs. Hudson had lived below Sherlock for months or years. John would have to hear that story sometime. After about 15 minutes of alley cats, John had had enough.
“Dull.”
“Less dull.”
Sherlock steepled his fingers against his chest, staring straight ahead. “You are right that she reminded me a bit of myself. Her mother reminded me of my mother. My mother is a gifted mathematician. The girl was a loner but unlike myself did not act out in any particularly harmful ways. It seemed unlikely that she left home without the involvement of a trusted adult who betrayed that trust.”
Sherlock smiled that smirk that John had come to understand meant he was up to something, and asked John, “So, are you interested in men?”
Sherlock smiled and reached for John’s glass. He knocked back the remaining Scotch and grimaced; he had never really appreciated that alcohol burn. John laughed, “It’s not medicine, you know. If you want something to drink, I’ll open another bottle of wine.”
“Well…,” John said around a mouthful of food. He had wanted to bring it up but was now not entirely sure what he could say about Mycroft that wouldn’t annoy Sherlock. He swallowed, and said carefully, “The first hint he dropped was that he knows what happened with the killer cabbie.”
John was angry at every stupid teenager who had a part in pushing Sherlock to create the almost-impenetrable walls he had built around himself. Not many people escaped younger years without some damage, but John couldn’t imagine how anyone could go from childhood to adulthood with only one almost-friend who stabbed him in the back. He didn’t think sympathy would be appreciated by Sherlock; it would read too much like pity.
Sherlock was not sure about John’s rating scale, as “sex” seemed fairly obvious. Perhaps his scale was based on the likelihood that someone would actually ask Sherlock that question. He had not predicted that his meeting with Lestrade and dinner with John would then be followed by a sexual history profile, so perhaps 6.94 was close enough, and he was willing to push his comfort level if John was willing to do the same.
“I’m a good doctor,” John said grimly.
John laughed at Sherlock’s several attempts to tease him in that comment, and added, “I think it was also some twisted attempt to tell me not to hurt you.”
John thought that focusing on Mycroft would be an easy starting point for this discussion. “Do you think Mycroft is asexual?”
“I wanted to know if I was interested in women.”
When he knew he was asking something that could be a ‘bit not good,’ Sherlock tended to lose all expression. He usually didn’t know he was treading into ‘not good’ territory, so when he did, and was trying to be thoughtful about it, he had learned to control his body language tells. He was completely still as he asked, “How do you know when someone is your friend?”
“Well, I’m not going to give you some feel-good answer about love and caring and trust. I don’t want to be ‘obvious.’” The air quotes were rather clear. “So to make this personal, I think that there’s a connection you feel with some people that you don’t with others. You can appreciate spending time with someone who is generally a good person, but not want to go to the pub with them. Sometimes you meet someone and the first thing you think is ‘let’s go get a pint.”
John laughed. Yes, his need to have his flatmate chase serial killers so he could then chase after him for all hours of the night was obvious and probably too dull to even talk about over dinner. And he really did need to fire his therapist. “Ok, fine Sherlock. On a scale of 1 to 10 — 10 very non-obvious— how non-obvious do you want my question to be?” John, happily, felt like he was starting a bizarre game of truth or…, well, truth.
John decided to go all in; he had already learned that short and simple tended to get the most reaction from Sherlock. “When I first met you I was told in no uncertain terms that you didn’t ‘do friends’. I want you to know that I think that is bullshit.”
Mycroft was spectacularly good at conveying with a look something halfway between contempt and threat of imminent violence. “I have two jobs. One involves ensuring the safety of the British people. The other involves ensuring the safety of my brother. I have been more successful in the first endeavor, but am willing to go to great lengths on the second endeavor.”
And there it was. In one moment, Sherlock had a choice to make. In many ways, he could and did control his transport. Food, sleep, libido, personal interactions were his to do with mostly as he willed. But there were days he knew that one small push at the wrong time would lead him back to the next high, and like most addicts he had wanted to keep his options open for when he might just be agreeable to that small push. Yes, there were drugs in the flat. Not many, and they were very well hidden. Anderson would never find them, but someone might one day. And, of course, the whole point of hiding them is that ideally that someone would be Sherlock.
I will forever be grateful, and I'm so sorry I've been a right arsehole and have forgotten to thank you before now.
resounding in his ears. Just when John was beginning to think Sherlock might be down the other end of the hall a sound reached his ears that will haunt him for the rest of his life.
“Was your relationship sexual in nature?”
“And you’re better than him, Sherlock.” John brought Sherlock’s hand up to his mouth and kissed his knuckles. Banishing the memories of the nightmare with his lips, or at least trying to. Still, Sherlock’s bottom lip continued to tremble, and his fingers twitched in John’s grasp. Getting an idea John stood up.
“Yeah, but how much does he know? Can he get us to Moriarty?” John asked as he settled in one of the wooden chairs at the table beside Sherlock.
“He’ll be on the best of behaviour tonight now,” She agreed, accepting John’s extending hand she stood then leaned up and kissed his cheek. “Though, I wouldn’t mind my turn with you. If you and Zed wanted to swap some night at Lotus.”
“I see the rules are still the same.” He said, reading over the words that had once greeted him every weekend.
“Right,” John said, gathering up the dishes and brushing the crumbs off his chest, “What do you want from this, Sherlock. It’s clear this isn’t entirely sexual for you, which is fine,” he added, keeping his tone as light as he could manage without sounding comical. He placed the tray on the floor beside the bed, then turned his body towards Sherlock.
"Used to be a supply room for the dance hall that was here. It held chairs and stuff. We knocked this whole front wall out, and put this in," he said, motioning to the raised platform. On which sat two round ottomans. Each was large enough for a person to kneel comfortably on. "These should work, yeah?" He asked, watching as Sherlock started to circle the platform.
“Prat,” John mouthed, more than said out loud, earning himself a rare smile that made the corners of Sherlock’s eyes crinkle.
Sherlock uttered a low baritone hum of approval, opening his mouth and welcoming John’s cock back inside. John demand had not been the reaction he had hoped for. Part of him had wanted to see John beg, if only a little, for Sherlock to make him come. Still, the command had sent a surge of fire through his veins. Something was intoxicating in the way John’s voice lowered nearly a full octave when he gave a common. It was the same tone he used when he was angry or demanding a criminal let Sherlock go.
“All weekend, please, Sir,” Sherlock answered quietly. “I overheard Mrs. Hudson say she would go visit her sister. Barring any surprise visits from my brother, that gives us a day and a half to explore this.”
“Jesus, are you okay? You fell asleep on the sofa, I woke up to you screaming my name.” John said gently, nudging Sherlock over on the sofa he perched his bum on the edge of the cushion and sat, placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“You know, I was hoping you’d be brattier than you’ve been for me,” John said as he took the tags and slipped the chain over Sherlock’s neck. “Part of me still clings to the hope that your easy submission is just because this is new.”
“And I’ll do whatever it takes,” John said, placing his hand over Sherlock’s.
A few notes here:
“It’s either that, or I stand up, signaling to the whole room that I’m still available. My rules are few and simple but firm. First, we talk.”
“Right, pass me your cuffs then.” John demanded, “We left your collar downstairs, so get my tags out as well.”
When we’re in a scene, I do expect respect, and any backtalk or flat refusal to obey will be punished.”
another part of his mind supplied.
“They did. They arrived every Saturday right at opening, without fail.”
Passing the wall that he’d pinned Sherlock against, he smiled. He’d never been interested in public sex. It had always seemed too risky for his liking. But now, staring at the wall, he heard the echoes of Sherlock’s soft moans and felt himself growing hard at the memory.
It wasn’t until he had a mouthful of sandwich that his brain caught up, and he realized what he’d said.
“Sherlock Holmes, I’m not leaving you,” John said firmly while pulling Sherlock close. “Even if this had been your choice, I wouldn’t bloody leave you. You’re my friend, my boyfriend, the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. Not some fling I’m willing to throw out when things get tough.”
Sherlock gave the woman an appraising glance before motioning her to come in. The woman is tall, though not quite as tall as himself. If she were to remove her black high-heels, she’d be roughly John’s height. In her mid-fifties, Sherlock notices that she’s remarkably fit.
“Bed, John,” Sherlock hummed, bending down and dragging his teeth over John’s right shoulder. He released his grip on John’s cock, and with his other hand against his chest, pushed John to the bed.
“Three days, get here Friday morning when I open, and we’ll make sure everything fits. John, darling, if I see that jumper in my shop again, I will burn it for Sherlock.”
"With the noises you make? Or the way you speak? I'd be an idiot if they didn't turn me on," John replied smugly while thrusting his hip into Sherlock's hand. "If I could get away with it, I'd record one of your moans and set it as my text alert tone. That way every time you send me a text my cock will twitch."
“Sherlock?” John began cautiously, “Can I show you how much I love you? How deep my desire for you is?”
Greg leads them out of the building the back way, into the car park. For the first time since Greg had found him half-dead, Sherlock climbed into the police car without a complaint. Greg could get to Chinatown faster than any cab, and arriving with an officer of the law would speed things up if they met resistance while attempting to access her flat.
notice in those trousers.”
“Next time you apologize, don’t pose it as a question. You know full well that you were a brat.” John said, his voice dripping with disgust. He slid the hood over Sherlock’s head, not giving his sub time to respond or to change his apology. Sherlock’s world went black, and the smell of nylon filled his nose.
“This way,” John called, taking off at a trot towards the flat. After a short distance, John stopped short and spun to face Sherlock. “Back against the wall, and I want your hands tucked away behind your back.”
, with, as you mentioned, boundaries. Your desire to keep this private and not parade it around New Scotland Yard is appreciated.”
Sherlock had been worried that clear access to the key would be a temptation. But as he toyed with the collar, twisting his body, so his reflection shifted in the mirror, he realized he had no desire to remove John’s claim on him.
“Oh, right,” John sat back down, aware that having two men hovering around him the instant he entered the flat might come across as rude.
. You won't be able to do it and remain soft. I give you five minutes before you’re hard as a rock. I think, deep down, you’ll find it intoxicating to have people watch.”  Sherlock leaned forward over the table, his voice dropping to its lowest register, “The real question is, will you be aroused enough to have me in the alley, to mindlessly rut against me until the evidence of our pleasure is smeared all over my stomach. I wouldn’t fight back, you know if you pinned me to a wall and tore my trousers down my legs. Or you could have me in them, your naked cock rubbing against the leather, denying me the contact I so deeply crave.”
stop ringing. At first, it had been John, which he’d blatantly ignored. He had told Greg to call with updates. John would just be calling to check up on him.. He knew he’d pay for his choice later, but he couldn’t lose his train of thought, not when the lives of so many rested on his shoulders. However, it didn’t take long for the caller to shift from John to Mycroft. And Mycroft, unlike John, had multiple numbers, all of which he used to call Sherlock in an endless loop.  One call would end and instantly a new one would begin. In a fit of annoyance (rather than throwing his mobile into the Thames), he held down the power button and shut the device off. Twenty minutes later Sherlock stepped out of a narrow back alley and let out a groan at the black car idling patiently up ahead. Part of him wanted to turn heel and walk away, but Mycroft would simply send another car after him. Then an agent with the ability to keep up with him would be deployed. Not wanting Mycroft to learn more about his bolt holes than necessary, he strode forward and pulled open the door.
“Place it here,” Sherlock suggested, pointing at the darker seam along his shoulder. “I’ll be careful.”
“I’ve got your back,” Greg assured him as he pulled his helmet on and fastened the chin strap.
“What did I say about bossy subs?” John demanded, sticking his head through the door and revealing a naked torso.
“You know the owner.”
“Honestly, I’m not even sure what the point of our conversation was if there even was a point.”
long.” John said, laughing, “It's just past lunch. Are you hungry now, or would you rather wait?”
“Show me,” John requested as his gaze drifted down to where Sherlock’s cock was hidden beneath the folds of his coat.
Sherlock had instructed Elvio to attach the cuffs to the wall just above the level of his shoulders. Now cuffed, with his stomach facing the wall, Sherlock’s forearms were pressed flat against the wall, his back arched, with his arse sticking out. John kicked his legs apart, then gave a single nod of approval as just a hint of Sherlock’s cock could be seen dangling under his skirt.
“I could have the room repurposed by the end of the week,” Shelock considered, closing his eyes at the brief contact. “If you would like.”
“All you have to do is ask if you want something, Sherlock. Chastity doesn’t have to be used as a punishment. Not only that, I view this more as a pirate’s code. Guidelines, nothing more. If something doesn’t sit well but is allowed in the contract, I’ll, of course, not push you.”
“Talk with Lestrade, see if he can get any information on Moon Young, her address, family,
“Sorry mates,” Greg whispered while gently taking Sherlock’s head in his hands. Letting his hands drift with Sherlock’s movements, he made it appear he was
A shadow passed over Sherlock’s face. His mouth opened and closed a few times as if contemplating if he wanted to share what was on his mind. John remained silent, despite the screaming in his heart to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and offer him comfort. Instead, he simply gave Sherlock a nod and tucked a curl behind his ear.
“Yeah, well, I’ve only known him six months, and he annoys the hell out of me. I can’t imagine how yo- Wait… did you say?”
"Sherlock, love. We've got to be quiet. I still have to get you out. Let's play a game, yeah?" John eased them both to their feet. With his gun in his dominant hand, he wrapped his right arm around Sherlock's waist. "Let's see who can be the quietest until we find Greg. Okay?"
“I don’t mean I’ll ask you to sign your body over to me, but a contract can be helpful. It will allow us to outline our Hard and Soft limits, likes, desires, and goals. I can’t memorize things quite as easily as you can. Having it written in black and white will help keep me on the right path. Part of what I intend to put in the contract is this: our relationship as dom and sub will not interfere with The Work, nor will I start giving you orders in front of Greg or anyone else from New Scotland Yard. Now, as you’ve so kindly listened to my verbal dump, I will sit back and give you the floor.”
” he asked in a husky voice, letting the honorific slide off his tongue like sex.
Sherlock’s forehead relaxed, and a smug smile crept over his face as John began pacing the kitchen. John rolled his eyes at him but continued thinking out loud.
“Sherlock…” John warned gently, his previously peaceful mood somewhat soured.
“I won’t ask you to be a sex slave; that’s not what I want. I don’t do this for the sex alone. For me, that’s just a happy benefit. If you do this with me and want a relationship, I want a partner with whom I can share a mutual kink. I will not attempt to boss you around outside of our scenes save for if we attend Lotus together as a couple. If you want something more permanent while we’re here,” he gestured to the flat at large, “I’m more than willing, though we’ll need to set up some clear boundaries, even going as far as formulating a contract of sorts.”
After a short talk with Zed, John replaced both hands in Sherlock’s hair and filled him in on the other half of the conversation.
“Faster, harder, dam it all, give me more, Sherlock!” John cried while reaching up and dragging his nails across the span of Sherlock’s back. “God yes, like that,” he moaned when Sherlock abandoned the slow and torturous pace for something with speed and urgency.
“Less talking, more finger-fucking,” John demanded, swatting at Sherlock’s thigh playfully.
“Keep quiet, and don’t hold back. I want you to come for me right here, but I don’t want the neighbors to hear. Understand?”
“Fine,” John replied with a nonchalant shrug. He wrapped the ends of the rope around his fist a few times, then nodded to Zed.
“I knew you would love this,” John confessed as he dragged his nails along the base of Sherlock’s skull. He stood there for a full minute, letting his fingers wander through damp hair. He gave Sherlock the touch of pleasure he so desperately wanted for a moment. Then, with a wicked grin, he twisted a few curls around his fingers and tugged. Not enough to hurt, but enough to get Sherlock’s attention.
Unable to refuse the request, not that he wanted to, Sherlock fell back into bed with John. Their bodies instantly seeking each other out, legs and arms slotting together as their chests pressed against each other. John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and let out a happy sigh.
“Mmm, you sentimental sod,” John said, giggling and feeling his eyes begin to brim with happy tears. “You’re just saying that because you’re jealous? I saw the way she looked at me… and I think you straight up bruised my thigh.”
“Fine, you git. Have it your way.” John muttered out loud to his phone as the door opened.
“Two more weeks went by, and she never came back. Her friends mentioned they were worried. I guess none of them had spoken with her online since the night before she went home with the Dom. But none of them knew her outside of their group, didn’t have friends or family they could reach out to.”
John’s words echoed through Sherlock’s memory, and he finally understood what his punishment was to be. John wasn’t going to flog him, spank him, put him in chastity. No, John was going to make Sherlock follow him. It would be Sherlock’s one job to keep his cock within John’s reach at all times, regardless of his inability to see or move efficiently.
“Better,”  John says through an amused smile.
I really **REALLY** had fun letting Sherlock be in charge for this chapter. Apparently, John enjoyed himself as well.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade warned in a low voice once they were alone, “While it is reassuring to see the
“My partner Sherlock Holmes,” John began in a husky voice, “stepped out of our bedroom with an air of confidence I had not yet seen in him. You would think, a man dressed such as him would be self-conscious, or perhaps nervous. Or even falling over, considering the height of his heels. He was wearing a tight black leather mini skirt that barely went to the middle of his thighs, with a slit up the left hip leaving
