She seemed to be calling his name. Perhaps something was the matter? He vaguely tried to assess his bodily functions. Was he injured or something? With another stabbed reminder he noted he had a headache. Also his back was killing him. His arms and legs were at unusual angles… well, one arm, that was; he couldn’t feel the other one at all. Also, his bed seemed to have suddenly turned into wood and felt suspiciously like a flight of stairs.
He finally looked back at John, who grinned, already knowing what he’d say. “How about it, Doctor? Shall we give Sally a run for her money?”
At this declaration, the blonde threaded her arm through her friend’s from behind and hung onto her. “Aaaaaaaaaaw,” she squeaked and gave John a look as if he was some kind of adorable furry animal. “
But Sherlock shook his head. “Yes but I have—“ he broke off, clearly a bit confused. He’d worked out the facts but he couldn’t see them for what they meant. John decided that his initial judgement that Sherlock was ‘spectacularly ignorant’ when it came to certain things was definitely spot-on when it came to relationships.
Mary smirked, but there was something thoughtful crossing her face. John figured that perhaps it was time to stop thinking or talking about his genius flatmate and focus more on his nice, currently uninterrupted date. He tried to push the thought away that perhaps, just a bit, he really wanted it to be interrupted. The tension from running after criminals with Sherlock was definitely preferable to the tension rising from Mary’s rising degrees of
He looked over at Sherlock. The man was driving stoically, not saying a word since they left the Holmes house. He didn’t seem mad about John’s outburst. Well, he didn’t seem to exhibit any kind of emotion at the moment, period. Perhaps that was his natural defence mechanism after being confronted with that mess of sentiment earlier.
Something in his voice seemed to give off the wrong impression, however. He felt the hand on his back slip away and the warmth of John’s body recede a little. John cleared his throat. “Um, yes, sorry, I—was just—“ he stammered, drawing back.
“How long did you wait after your burden of a husband passed? Three months, was it? Four?” He tutted in mock-sympathy. “And he never got to enjoy all that lovely
“So glad you worked out your differences,” someone said from the doorway. John’s head snapped up to follow the voice; it sounded like a kind, older woman, yet it was laced with icy steel.
John tried to order his thoughts. “You’re right that I will be disappointed. For Freddy, mostly. He seems to be a nice guy and he clearly loves his girlfriend. It would be disappointing for him to find out she’s a fraud. But you are wrong if you think I want your deductions to be false.”
“John,” Sherlock finally began, and his voice was so perfect and real that it felt as if it was the first thing John truly heard in months. “Please look at me,” he continued quietly. John opened his eyes and found Sherlock looking at him intently. “I am so sorry,” he said with feeling.
Mrs Hudson returned and smiled at John. “Well, that’s better, dear. Care to give me a hand with this one?” She gestured at Sherlock, who seemed to have trouble focussing on anything or anyone.
This was exactly the problem. John was sentimental, and he’d be expecting things from him now – that was how these things went, right? And he’d made Sherlock sentimental, too. He’d distract him from the Work. He’d expect him to hold his hand in public or something ridiculous and sleep with him and he’d want Sherlock to listen to him and to commit to him and he’d be jealous…
She moved closer as well. Even if she wasn’t a good shot, she’d certainly hit him from this distance.  Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw a flicker of movement. Mary was tensing up, preparing herself.
Sherlock was still stubbornly sitting at the other end of the room, staring at his laptop, an untouched glass of sherry by his side. John glanced over a few times but decided to leave him alone for now. He was obviously working on the case, and whatever he did, he wasn’t exactly discussing it with John.
Lestrade shook his head, bemused. “But—you’re in a public hospital! Surely somebody will have seen you by now?”
“Precisely.” Sherlock was sitting on his chair, fingers steepled under his chin, watching John putter around with the tea.
John took the chance to take charge of the conversation. He asked Freddy everything about his girlfriend’s habits, her address, her hobbies and so on, and took careful notes. “So you’ve been together almost five years, and you never moved in together?” John asked after a while.
The next time John managed to glance at a clock it was already way past 2 AM. Mycroft had passed out in his chair for good now, and Mary’s yawns were severely inhibiting her ability to play, chat and drink. The game had somewhat dwindled into the background, since none of them managed to guess what was stuck to their foreheads and had run out of questions. Things morphed into a strange three-way nonsense conversation in which they talked and laughed about nothing and Sherlock interspersed their chats with weird observations or questions that had nothing to do with anything but he insisted were important for future reference.
He pulled on some pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt and padded sleepily into the bathroom. After a quick morning ritual he continued into the kitchen, yawning. He blinked in surprise at the two cups of tea on the kitchen table. Sherlock never made tea for him – or for anyone. At that moment, Sherlock walked in from the sitting room and his eyes met John's with a mild expression of pleasant surprise. He generally seemed completely bemused as to how much John slept, and whenever John tried to tell him that six to seven hours was not above average, all he received was an indulgent smile. It seemed that Sherlock would forever believe that John must surely be having him on, and was therefore always pleasantly surprised when John eventually
“John, I know you were…. But he was only a friend, right?” she said quietly, with a worried, somewhat frightened half-smile, like someone bringing up a painful truth that nobody wanted to talk about. And under different circumstances, John would have laughed. Trust his bloody sister to be the only person who got it right and didn’t assume they’d been a couple.
Sherlock chuckled and he felt the vibrations through his entire body. “About time you figured that out.”
Sherlock took another deep breath and stared back at John’s bed. “When we were facing Moriarty, I got him to come over to me to take... to talk to me.” Greg sensed another omission, but let it go. “He stood between us, his back to John,” Sherlock continued. “It was a perfect opportunity. John used to be a soldier, after all. He grabbed him in a choke hold and tried to get me to... leave.” Greg saw him swallow. He realized immediately what Sherlock’s ‘puzzle’ was. He felt a surge of respect for the doctor.
Helen nodded, and together they went back upstairs, Abby bouncing happily around them. Helen immediately went towards the kitchen, where John could indeed hear Freddy talk to what he assumed was police. She didn’t look back and John was glad; suddenly, the entire morning caught up with him and he felt himself be weighed down with everything to the point where he couldn’t take another step.
John’s fingers dug into the bark behind his back, his heart racing. He suddenly felt the weight of being
About twenty minutes later, Sherlock’s phone vibrated. A message told him that the car was waiting. He was already in the hallway and slung his coat around his shoulders, pocketing his phone and a few paraphernalia. He thought for a moment of the journey ahead, then dashed into the kitchen. A moment later, he emerged again, only to see John standing in the doorway to the sitting room.
Now Sherlock was the one to laugh. As if Mycroft would be able to stop them from leaving if they felt like it. “What are you going to do, defend us with your little sword if Moran comes looking?”
She walked over to Sherlock and stopped right next to him before she left the kitchen. She smiled a little and placed a hand on his arm, briefly. It looked like she was going to say something else, but perhaps Sherlock’s offended look put her off. She merely shook her head, patted his shoulder and briskly jogged down the stairs.
Sherlock was close, holding on to him with one arm as they broke the surface. The detective managed to pull in a rasping breath before his eyes went wide, glancing up. John was about to turn around to see what his friend had seen, but before he could take a second breath, he felt Sherlock’s arm tighten around his torso and another arm push him under again.
Sherlock’s face finally relaxed in the face of such a pathetic display and huffed a laugh. “Come here,” he said, rolling his eyes. He opened up his arm and lifted his coat a little in invitation. John’s brain stumbled incoherently over itself, but his body seemed to be on autopilot due to the cold. He shuffled over and leaned in and let himself be enveloped by the arm and half the coat. He sighed in content.
“Excellent deduction, genius,” he smirked, but his voice was full of fondness. “Come on, let’s get him into a cab. He’s better off sleeping I off at home.”
Sherlock looked up quickly to glare at him. But Mycroft couldn’t help it. Perceptiveness ran in their family; as much as he was loath to admit he had anything in common with his little brother. “I don’t want to drag him into unnecessary risks, but I won’t stop him from working with me,” Sherlock said, studying John’s face again. “Moriarty...” he paused. “It would be something to go up against him again. He’s brilliant. A challenge. Thrilling,” he said with fervour.
They entered what turned out to be Lady Smallwood’s office. Sherlock dug out a small torch from his pocket; John wondered where the hell he’d hidden that, seeing as his dinner suit fit him so neatly. Sherlock switched on the computer and handed John the torch. He pointed at a filing cabinet. “See if you can find anything on Blanchard. They never mentioned the name of the ambassador in question, which was probably deliberate, even by Mrs Blanchard. But it should be in the file, if it’s there.”
Sherlock’s teeth began to hurt. John, on the other hand, had his lips pressed together tightly to keep from laughing.
John smiled, held the post-its and pondered Sherlock’s face a moment. He was definitely tipsy enough to simply look at him, appreciating the fine lines of his cheekbones and lips without feeling too self-conscious; but he also noticed that Sherlock still shifted a little uncomfortably at that.
A snappy retort was on Sherlock’s lips, but he stopped himself. He looked at John and was met with a shy smile.
The long stretch of neatly clipped grass contained small areas of bushes and flower beds, all bare and neatly tied up for the winter. It was probably quite nicely kept during the summer. Bordering the lawn was a gravel path that led to a small cottage. As far as John could make out in the bit of moonlight, it had a bench by the front door, a wind chime, even an honest-to-god garden gnome, happily brandishing a watering can. There was a bird house and a bird bath, and a Christmas ornament decorated the quaint front door.
Sherlock turned to him and studied his face for a moment. “It would not have been possible without her. The fake body… and after,” he said.
“Nothing to it,” Sherlock huffed. John heard the rustle of fabric and the creaking of joints as Sherlock lowered himself into a crouch and then dropped backwards with a soft “
“Ingrates,” Mycroft added as aristocratically as he could, and sipped his wine. As he had predicted, Mary broke out in a fit of very un-ladylike laughter.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered to John Watson, sleeping peacefully. His features softened for a split second, before glaring back at his older brother.
After they had exchanged all of the boring pleasantries, Lestrade began to conclude the conversation. A chair was pushed back with a scraping noise. Sherlock stepped into the doorway.
“Don’t,” Sherlock rolled his eyes in an overly exaggerated manner. “Tedious, most of it.” He began slowly threading in the cufflink through the buttonholes. Their hands brushed and John tried very hard to concentrate on something over Sherlock’s shoulder.
He felt hot under his collar and the irrational urge to hold John again bubbled traitorously in his chest. He valiantly swallowed and tried to keep up. Father kept explaining the intricacies of beekeeping, but Sherlock was only half-listening; half of his attention was focussed on watching John, cataloguing the fact that they were, apparently, not only best friends, but
caught up with you again?” He leaned against the counter and regarded Sherlock with an amused, indulgent smile.
Sherlock laughed, but felt a stab of possessiveness seeing the woman grope John like that. He positioned himself almost without noticing it a bit closer to John, stepping into his personal space. “Remember the case we originally took when we met Irene Adler?” he kept his voice low, murmuring into John’s ear as the crowd grew thicker around them, streaming towards the banquet. “The pictures on her phone?” he added.
They entered a dingy little hut nestled between barren hills somewhere along the Russian-Belarusian border. The last leg of Sherlock’s forced trip had made short work of a rather vicious criminal network that smuggled state secrets from the East to the West and vice versa. Sherlock had been instrumental in discovering the right people to arrest, the correct bank accounts to freeze and which employees to interrogate back home in England. Moriarty’s remaining network was crumbling beneath the combined power of the Holmes brothers, and Mycroft bemoaned the fact that he and Sherlock did not usually cooperate so well. Nothing about the situation was ‘usual’, of course.
“We need to get out,” he managed. He went to his knees and slipped an arm under John’s good shoulder. John winced with the effort, but with Sherlock’s help managed to get himself on his feet. Slipping on the wet and bloodied floor, they stumbled together towards the nearest intact looking door, both coughing and gasping for air. They both pulled their sodden shirts over their mouths and noses against the thick smoke and tried to keep low, Sherlock supporting John as they made their way through piles of sizzling debris towards a corridor with an exit sign. Thankfully, the fire escape at the back of the pool was not blocked. The door had been blown clean from its hinges and the air was pulling at the smoke inside, drawing it out.
The afternoon had given way to a wet and foggy evening by the time they reached the Thames. It would be some time before Sherlock thought anyone was going to make a move, so they stopped by a small fish & chip stall first. They sat on a bench, John enjoying his dinner and pretending not to notice that Sherlock was stealing the occasional chip from him. John enjoyed the companionable silence between them. It was just another day and just another ill-advised stakeout, but he was content. Sherlock made some stray observations about joggers and other chippy customers and John dared him to prove any of them, but pulled Sherlock back when he was about to confront an elderly lady about her gambling addiction. Sherlock merely quirked an eyebrow at him. “You shouldn’t make wagers you don’t intend me to follow through,” he admonished. John laughed, but then the thought flashed through him that there might be a few other things he’d like to
- the conclusion of holmes' rant abt weakness is abridged ofc, from the concepts in i carry your heart with me(i carry it in by ee cummings
When put like that, a fair few cases came to mind, in which a great number of tragedies and worries could have been avoided had the individuals made peace with themselves and their loved ones. I said as much to Holmes, further adding fire to his jeremiad.
. It was a matter of pulling the last few aspects together to form a more agreeable story, as well as to alter it significantly enough not to affect those actually involved, and it was a burdensome process.
From somewhere I could not identify, as was the logic of dreams, some music began to play - a waltz of some sort. Holmes opened his arms to me and raised his eyebrows as if in invitation and I remember laughing, as my friend in real life loathed dances and balls of all sorts, mainly due to the unuseful mingling of strangers, and when he had been made to go he never once deigned to dance unless forced. Still, he looked at me challengingly now, as if daring me to call attention to this, and even in my dreams I was helpless not to agree and go along with him. I stepped into his arms, and felt them take warm purchase on my own, drawing me into his embrace.
“Yes, thank you,” he said, to my surprise, before explaining privately to me, “for Mrs. Hudson. She has been much tried these past few days out of worry for you, and the hidden meanings should escape her in any case.”
Here he cut, as in the time he had been working himself into a strop I had crossed the room and now brought both his arms down, before raising mine to hold fast to his shoulders. “Holmes,” I said, plainly, and I felt more than saw him settle.
Macnair laughed at his joke, and I did too to match his good humor, but my mind was racing with the onslaught of information that had just been given to me.
The Holmes that stood immediately before me was completely unrecognizable, except for the triumphant grin he gave that was likely a result of my jaw-dropped expression. I have always said my friend could have another career as an actor, not just for his talents in disguise and performing but in how he lapped up praise; he was ever delighted in my reactions to his costumes, and made sure to debut them for me even if I would not be accompanying him on whatever venture he needed it for.
He waved a hand. “Of course not, I waived it in the circumstances. But that is not the point. This is just the latest in a common theme I have observed among many of my clients over the years, who instead of being honest with their so-called beloved, get caught up in a series of events that then demands police attention, dramatizing affairs that could be solved with a few words! Or worse, they come to me for answers so I may solve their marriage troubles in some roundabout way when my time would be better spent on the interesting criminal problems still existing for me to examine."
“But you have said it yourself, now that he knows what I am done and what I am capable of, there is no conceivable way that will work! Who is to say he will agree?”
“Ah yes, by ‘88 we’d written him off, to be quite honest, figured he had found someone on the outside, for he when he did visit he was distracted and not particularly
Holmes had bristled, but something in my last sentence had made him relax his shoulders at the last in conciliatory defeat . “As you wish.”
“It is interesting to me, the dual purpose that this language of the flowers pushes onto these tokens. This blue violet for instance, speaks to the florist of faithfulness and dedication to one’s lover, positive behaviors, while on the other hand our suspect has weaponized them to indicate that your movements have been catalogued and surveilled and thus disrupting your sense of security. And then you have those like our Mrs. Hudson, who simply believe that they share the traits that every flower possesses: beauty and a display of Providence’s simple kindness.”
This was not the answer I had expected nor wanted, it sufficed to say. “Is this what you make of me, Holmes?”
For the shop we had chosen at random to hide away from the rain was in fact a florist, surrounded as we now were by flowers of all kinds. The scents and colors hit me at once as I looked around, and I laughed in realization. “Why, and we are barely across the street from Macnair’s!”
As touched as I was by his gesture it meant nothing in the face of our current situation, and I broke free from his grasp. “How can you say that! I doubt I will get any sleep tonight, as at the very least I aim to be by your side as we get to the bottom of this. I believe it is my right.”
Lestrade took his orders and with a meaningful nod to me he said his goodbyes and departed. I noticed that it was now pushing midnight.
The man himself was making his way back home now, and we trailed after him carefully even as a light drizzle began and his pace quickened. We kept him in sight until he finally disappeared up the steps of his townhouse, and only then did we have a chance to take shelter from the ensuing downpour ourselves, ducking into the closest storefront.
So as to not reveal how breathless the image of him imposing and elegant as ever in the lamplight left me, I made a joke that even to my ears marked a clear misunderstanding of what he had been saying, butchering the nuances of his speech. Yet he still barked a clear short laugh as he let us into our rooms, a demonstration perhaps of how on top of the world we felt we were that particular night.
“There have been only two occasions that I had reason to be in Macnair’s home, and the latter was so memorable in its shamefulness that I remembered the address when I made the walk home the next morning.”
“I identified them as such from her missive detailing the matter this morning - the names from the letter are merely the masculine and feminine forms of the names of our queen and her consort, basic yet clever aliases for two individuals conducting a secret juvenile love affair. Upon being presented the letters themselves I was able to observe their wear and tear through the years that could not be avoided although they were well maintained. I judged that
As we stepped safely within 221B again (for it was safe still, Holmes and I would make sure of it), I felt the urge to focus on that instead, for it was a much more agreeable topic, but as always Holmes brought me back down to Earth.
It was therefore Lestrade that cautiously broke the silence. “Would the either of you care to explain what in God’s name just happened here?”
“No, sir. Just that Dr. Watson and you were expecting them, and that they were happy to wait until you returned.”
My friend smiled in a way that indicated to me that he would be at his most charming. “Actually, madam, we were hoping you could do us a favor instead? All we need is some questions answered - they are quite innocuous, I assure you.”
She would have my head for that, but I had the advantage of knowing that she had no small fondness for the Irregulars, complain as she will at the sight of them, and that she would have given him something regardless if I had not asked. Dawson was as fearful of her as the rest of the boys were however, and his eyes widened with awe and his toothy grin returned at my saying so. “Wow! Thanks, Doctor!”
He gave me a look, and my mirth died down. “What I mean to say is, Holmes. If you wish to know the circumstances, you need only ask.”
I endured some twenty more minutes of chatter with Macnair, mainly spent on gossip about other club members that we had as mutual acquaintances, before I finally was able to extract myself, feigning exhaustion and an early start to my day tomorrow. He seemed almost reluctant to part with me, but did so with both hands clutching my right and with a promise that I would not leave him again for so long, as the others were merely a poor imitation of my company. I laughed with him and agreed, before paying my tab and making my escape, hoping to rush home quickly so as not to miss Holmes.
Whoever I had been while in the army, I was not one for dalliances once I settled back into civilian life at Baker Street. One of the reasons I did not return advances or engage in entanglements with men upon my return was of course, self-consciousness and shame due to my newfound injuries, but there was also my growing admiration for my fellow lodger and friend to contend with, that grew stronger and more undeniable day by day. When in 1888 I found my chance to escape this increasingly impossible environment with the events I detailed in “The Sign of Four”, I seized it. For while I had never resented Holmes for my unrequited feelings, I was beginning to grow hopeless, not helped by our growing disagreements about his drug usage that led to a sort of rough patch, and I wanted to avoid any falling out we might have had.
Holmes sat up somewhat against the headboard, and I saw that he was working himself up further. “When I become too disorderly with my discarded notes or with my materials during one of my experiments, and not meeting your standards of cleaning, do you not tell me?"
He was conversing with the barkeep, about something much more than just his drink order, and I observed him at work, his usual queer mannerisms heightened and enhanced in the character he played. I could not hear his words with the distance between, but from the side profile of his face could see that he was affecting an accent.
I must have made a noise at his luck, for he laughed sharply before nudging me so that we may continue walking, now with an eye on Macnair.
Mrs. Hudson rose to take the paper he handed her, and nodded once. On her way to the door I managed to clear my throat, and thank her.
It is a mark of the years that I have spent knowing and indeed studying this man that allowed me the knowledge to see his composed expression and deduce lasting contrition. He was yet withholding. “And what else? For there must be something else.”
He shook his head, casting aside his pipe as he sat up. “Your high regard for me, if not greatly exaggerated by him, is something I wholly do not deserve.”
“Because, Lestrade, however I may need this instance reported and taken care of, I have reason to believe this matter is a personal one, both in how the victim has been prepared and brought to us, and I would not have its delicacy disturbed by the presence of the police. Especially as it is not us precisely that are under threat, but Watson alone. That itself begs your utmost caution, a concept your colleagues are not aware of.”
“But that’s not all, Johnny! For as suddenly as his frequent visits started again, they abruptly stopped in ‘91, with no clear explanation, and not a word to any of us. There have been the theories in the rumor mill of course - I thought him dead, but Longwood said he’d left the country and gone back to France, presumably with the lover that’d broken his heart those years before. But Frank’s the dreamy sort. Maybe it is lucky he’s out of the picture, I would’ve been out ten pounds otherwise.”
“If not with me, but with you! The look on his face when you revealed to him that it was you in disguise last night, he was starstruck I’m sure,” I chanced a glance. “Physical and facial similarities aside, he rather reminded me of me, when we had first become acquainted.”
Again he was quiet, but he did raise his eyes to me, his expression blank. “I believe it would say much the same, as I’ve not much to update it with - although your nerves have much recovered since your time in active duty, and we have locked your chequebook away for some years now.”
“Jealousy, Watson, as I said! He might believe that the strife that the murder caused you would be enough to jar you emotionally, and that as there is no way of finding comfort in your cool-minded companion, you may be pushed once again to need a confidante and return to the club to his nurturance once more. That is just one hypothesis for his actions, but I fear the envious brain is not often the most rational.”
“You cannot expect me to just sit here waiting, twiddling my thumbs like some helpless damsel, while you intend to entertain my would-be murderer!”
As the undertakers performed their duties and the constable followed them back down to the street to assist, Lestrade stepped fully into the room, and in turn Holmes squared his shoulders. “Well?”
Holmes walked the length of the room, agitated. “His decisions were influenced by me, however, and that you cannot deny. Since the moment he met me, I have brought only destruction and heartbreak into his life.”
“Very well,” the woman agreed, but her cheery countenance dimmed somewhat. “Is it to do with the quality of the flowers?”
- what macnair refers to as a history lesson was holmes remembering the story "The Fatalist" by Mikhail Lermontov of 1840, the first trace of the russian roulette
He flipped himself to lie supine on the bed instead, staring stalwartly at the ceiling. “Yes. It was a mere trifle, as I said, but it does present itself to be just another in a trend that I have observed for years.”
Holmes shook his head. “Yes, but only for a time. I am merely here on business, and thought I would stop and see some old friends while I had the chance.” He gestured to Abbott with his hand.
Thankfully, Baker Street came along in good time, and we three exited the cab, Macnair’s hand on my elbow easing my dismount. I let us in and up the stairs, but Mrs. Hudson greeted us before we entered the apartment and I saw her eyes widen at seeing Macnair, another confirmation of our suspicion. Still as I have said time and time again, the woman possesses a backbone of steel, and did not flinch before asking to take our coats and hats, and to tell us that dinner would be up with a ring of the bell. I thanked her with a touch of her hand, and she smiled steadily, inaudibly telling me to be careful.
“Something like that.” I agreed. “But enough of me, there really isn’t that much to it that you haven’t already seen in the press. Not much in the way of excitement going on at the moment.” I thought ironically back to the memory of the man lying dead in our sitting room, and forced myself to hide my shudder. Reminded once more about why I was here, I looked surreptitiously to the bar, but unfortunately Macnair unknowingly still blocked my vantage point of Holmes.
Only for that all now to be spoiled by some unforeseen threat that used my weakness against me, pulling me into danger and dragging Holmes down with me. Another reversal of roles.
I loosened my grip on him in order to draw him into my arms as I had always wished, only for him to supersede me, breaking his fingers from my grasp.
Macnair clapped his hands together laughing, and my eyes finally broke away. “I had almost forgotten what you were like, Vernet, always perceptive. I should have known him to be your type, Watson!”
Holmes met his eyes with his own steely gaze, before unexpectedly, his shoulders dropped. He looked to the floor, and to my surprise, he took his eyes off Macnair to turn to me and put a hand on my arm. “He is right. I would not risk calling on the police, not if it endangered you.”
“How on earth could you know that?” I asked, bewildered. Even all these years later, his deductions could seem more like divination to me.
As I could not take my own armchair, I sat at my desk at Holmes’ elbow as he explained in a collected manner all that had happened since we first arrived home a mere hour ago, bringing Lestrade up to date on the details we had learned from Mrs. Hudson and that he had picked up by examining the body, as well as alerting him to the presence of the mysterious charming companion who had disappeared without much trace.
“It is as your Macnair said: I am a selfish man, and I am bound to disappoint. While I have always known that, and you undoubtedly would one day as well, it was nonetheless my responsibility to make sure you did not make this realization in a way that brought you serious harm out of your reliance in me.”
Holmes only chuckled, and did not stop walking on my account, so I had to hasten my pace to catch up. “I thought not, but not for lack of trying on his part.”
I swallowed, and looked away to think. “I do not know, since soon after our first meeting I would think.”
The records to which he referred to were his vast encyclopedia of London’s dangers, and were there to supplant any knowledge not readily available in his mind. They were built by notes and newspaper clippings compiled by both him and I and detailed information and particulars that helped him keep track of the ever-moving parts of the city’s criminal world. He was right, I was chagrined to realize, that in the months since he had returned from the dead we had yet to dedicate ourselves to properly reinstating it to its former glory and helpfulness.
“You have revealed to me much these past few days, and I did not want you to feel as if that left you bereft in any way. You may trust me, my dear, in kind.”
I need not have worried however, for as I exited there he was, standing by the very lamppost that I had smoked under while watching him enter hours previous. His eyebrows raised when he saw me, and he took a pull from his cigarette as I approached.
“Well Mr. Holmes, I made the requested inquiries, and I was right. A cadaver was unremarkable except for the flowers found with him, and once you mentioned it, his similar physical appearances to this one.”
And then everyone went still. In the newfound silence, we watched as Macnair’s glass fell from his hands as he slumped. My medical instincts moved me in autopilot from Holmes to his side, and I began opening his shirt buttons in an attempt to see the wound, which was rapidly staining his shirt red.
I removed my hat to brush some of the wetness off, cursing myself for having forgotten to bring an umbrella, when Holmes chuckled. “Well, Watson, I suppose we have found our connection to the floriography.” And he gestured around us.
An answer to that rose quickly to mind but it was bitter and had no place in this conversation. I turned to climb the stairs and retrieve my sleepclothes, as we were both still in our evening wear. Dinner and our concert now seemed like a different time altogether. “Goodnight, Holmes.”
“Nonsense! This is a test of Fate, and we should be toasting to her!” Macnair sneered. “Or indeed, to Dr. John Watson himself. Cheers!”
I didn’t turn from my desk, content to keep working and wait for him to explain at his own pace. As expected, he obliged some few minutes later.
- you can thank my usage of "moustache" to ACD, who loved that spelling over the more subtle, smoother,
“And yet you have my forgiveness do you not? And I have your trust. I am by your side now, and I have learned that that is more than enough.”
I stared hard at him, suddenly very anxious to know the answer. “Did you find your curiosity satisfied?”
After an allotted amount of time I felt sufficient, I put out the cigarette I had been discreetly smoking on the other side of the street and made my way to the entrance. Upon knocking the slot on the door gave way, and I saw Archie’s cool dark eyes and how they widened with recognition upon seeing me.
“You will, if I have accurately predicted his behavior, send word to Macnair today, by afternoon at the latest, asking to meet and discuss some matter or other, it is not important, but it must seem vaguely intriguing, and suitably remind him of your existence, as well as our friend Dr. Watson mentioned in conjunction. What is important is that you will want to meet at the club, somewhat earlier than when we had all met yesterday night, at 7:30pm. He will already have planned to be there around that time, predicting that Watson will be making a repeat visit - a prediction we will of course aim to validate, and then the three of you will make the journey to our secondary location. Your role, Mr. Abbott, will be chief in giving Macnair the idea for his next murder.”
“John,” he said simply, my Christian name, before he reached for me and I completed his action by reaching for him, and our lips met the way they had been circling towards for hours, and in fact, years.
I continued. “Holmes, of course I love you. I do not know if there was a time in which I did not have but the highest regard for you. For you not to already have noticed is unfathomable!” I brought a hand up so as to wipe at my eyes, which had at once begun to fill with yet unshed tears that I found mirrored in his own, before returning my hand to his grasp. “But I suppose that if I have always presented like this, hopelessly at your disposal, there was nothing out of the ordinary for you to notice.”
There was a great deal that had been said tonight, and not by me. Whether he knew of the true nature of my regard for him or not, Macnair had been clear when Holmes had been listening, and it would take time and patience to go through it all, and to consider next steps. Especially as I was yet to gather what his reaction to the revelations were, seeing as he had evidently still not found the words.
Instead, his eyes didn’t leave me. “You have a talent for flattery, Watson, that I have observed on many occasions now. With your natural advantages, everyone in your proximity is your helper.”
He merely shrugged. “As I said, this is our simplest strategy. Abbott has already been introduced to Macnair’s line of vision, by taking him in as our confederate we can then control events to our liking.”
- Mrs. Hudson letting ppl into their empty apartment, unfortunately, is true to canon. one of the few slights against our beloved landlady.
I nodded. “Yes, I believe myself to be content and aware of my own worth in a person’s life, and therefore I can place a degree of trust in them to hold me at that position even with the introduction of interest from another person.”
“Yes, of course, if you can spare an extra seat at the table, Johnny, you should absolutely come, Abbott. After all, I would hate to face the great Sherlock Holmes alone!” Although he was grinning, the way he bit out my friend’s name now spoke volumes to me, and I understood with further resolve why I had been instructed to say the next bit.
- abbott's line is reminiscent of watson's own "can i be of assistance?" from  the adventure of the speckled band. but i was hearing granada david burke's voice so i messed with it to match :)
It was just as well that he said so, as I was so exhausted by the day’s tribulations that I had barely undressed for bed and my head hit the pillow than I fell into a quick slumber.
Sherlock’s prediction about the ‘usual crowd’ had been correct. As they walked up to the door of Thames House, he already spotted a few people he knew here and there making their way from assorted expensive cars and taxis. Sherlock recognized members of Mycroft’s inner circle, a few less known members of the royal family here and there. He glanced at John, who seemed impressed by the splendour, but didn’t recognize anyone. That was the point, of course; the people collected here weren’t exactly TV stars. He steered John a little with a hand on the small of his back and whispered, “don’t stare. We belong here. I’ve protected some of these people’s reputations twice over and you’re my famous blogger, so try to stay in character.”
Just as he was drifting off, a hand brushed gently over his hair, and he heard Sherlock’s whispered voice. “I’m yours, too.”
Sherlock frowned. He tried not to let his voice sound too strained when he answered. “Well, I have a lot of explaining to do, Inspector. But all in good time,” he added, nodding slightly towards John.
Sherlock looked up at the nearest camera. “Probably. But seeing as Mycroft is the one who’ll be watching them – and only if this is even detected as a break-in – we’ll be okay.”
Sherlock took an automatic step backwards and suddenly, things seemed to move in slow motion. The man reached behind him and pulled out a gun. John didn’t think, he just reacted. He hooked a leg around Sherlock’s, buckling his knees and bringing him to the ground, making space. He pushed the hand with the gun away before the man could even move and rammed the palm of his hand squarely into his nose. He felt bone crunch and blood spurt. He quickly used the man’s disorientation to disarm him, and finally conked him in the head with the butt of his gun, knocking him to the ground, out cold.
Apparently Sherlock wouldn’t let him have a moment to think things through, either. He came out of the connecting door to the bathroom, carrying his laptop in one hand and brushing his teeth with the other.
John felt that jolt of satisfaction again: at least Sherlock seemed aware how his absence had wrecked his friend. He would endure the embarrassment of that if it meant that Sherlock felt at least some of the pain he had caused.
John placed one hand on Sherlock’s chest. “You should know… I am yours, for however long you’ll have me.” He leaned up and kissed him.
being used to it immensely. Mrs Hudson had called it their honeymoon period and John had cringed at the term, but she seemed so over the moon with them finally getting together that he didn’t say anything.
“I was there barely a week before the cavalry came to my rescue.” He couldn’t quite keep the sneer out of his voice.
He gently eased his hand out of John’s, not breaking the gaze. “We should go,” he said quietly, searching John’s eyes. John nodded. Sherlock pulled out his phone, reluctantly looking away. He sent a text to Mycroft.
, and somehow it felt right and all of his doubts as to what John did or did not want had gone completely out of the window as he leaned closer—
Suddenly, he blinked and sucked in a sharp rush of air. He had wriggled his legs and arms because there
you put away.” Sherlock glanced around, making sure to keep Moran in his sight as he manhandled John into submission.
John followed the unspoken invitation and joined him. Looking out, he saw another few houses along the country road, steam curling up from chimneys. An old woman was sitting by a window, knitting or reading; a man was raking together twigs and leaves that littered his lawn. A car went by.
“Yes. I need to work without Mycroft breathing down my neck. Don’t think I’ll sleep,” Sherlock told the laptop, still not looking up.
“Of course he isn’t, you’re always insulting all of his officers and him,” John felt the need to point out.
For a moment, their eyes were locked and John thought that Sherlock never let him come to his own deductions when he’d already arrived at them first, and he was convinced Sherlock must have a reason for that, because he never did anything unless he had a
Lestrade raised his hands in defeat. “Oh I see, all right – believe you me, I tried getting something out of that brother of yours, but he’s just as nuts as you are. You keep your secrets. As long as it doesn’t get me into trouble again!”
Sherlock always made jokes of even the most serious situation, but he wasn’t joking now. He looked seriously guilt-ridden and sad and yet somehow happy at the same time. Sherlock’s hand, which he had felt hovering next to his head, finally rested on John’s cheek. His eyes fluttered closed. The touch was so light that it was almost not there at all, and it slowed his ragged breathing and his racing thoughts.
“You know me so well, brother,” Sherlock smirked as he wandered slowly back towards the banquet hall.
They turned their backs and walked on, whilst Sherlock was suddenly rooted to the spot. Something about that gesture, about the way he said it… something had shocked and rattled him and made him feel that ominous fondness again, but why…? His thoughts raced through their words again.
last time and nearly drowned and now he couldn’t, he wouldn’t, because he dimly registered that there was something very wrong with the unresponsive, heavy body in his arms.
Sherlock ran down the corridor behind the door. He grabbed a small torch from his pocket and lit the way. Several doors led off into different parts of the building; on the side of the street, the building contained a large shop (shoes, from the smell of it). A few doors led from the linoleum floored hallway to storage rooms and a basement. Knowing John, he’d prefer exit routes and higher ground over hiding out in dead-end rooms. Sherlock ran to the end of the corridor, through the door leading up a staircase. He noted several scuff marks and footprints on the way; two men had followed John and his date, both armed.
Sherlock noted that a few other people had spotted them as well and they had pretty much reached the space reserved for the dancing, between the dinner tables and the small stage where a string quartet was playing a waltz. John still held his hand. He looked up and then at something over Sherlock’s shoulder. “And not just him,” he murmured.
“I’ll be there as fast as I can,” Sherlock promised and hung up. He turned to John. “It’s Helen. Get dressed.”
Strangely, the most unnerving detail of all was that John was close enough to Sherlock to smell his unique and weirdly specific scent; a mixture of freshly laundered shirts, bow rosin and chemicals. He smelled of home and safety and excitement and it was absolutely irresistible. John felt like a fly caught in a very personalised flytrap.
John gently raised Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissed the inside of his wrist. As soon as he made contact with the sensitive skin, Sherlock let out a breath and shivered, goose bumps rising. A similar shudder immediately tore through John as his arousal flared to life, demanding, driving him on. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, feeling Sherlock’s pulse racing through his lips. He heard Sherlock sigh heavily, the sound making him bold. He slowly parted his lips and kissed Sherlock’s wrist again, harder.
. There was a certain air of expectancy. John knew that, from where they were, they would eventually end up at Baker Street if he steered them there, and Mary seemed to be not uninterested in joining him for a nightcap. She could also call a cab, of course, and invite him over. Or he could simply say goodnight after she’d walked him home.
John sighed and shook his head. “Of course it’s all right, you idiot,” he said. “It’s still your home.”
Sherlock was standing by the window, absentmindedly playing something. He had no idea what it was; he just let his mind drift and his fingers and bow arm continued pretty much on their own. He heard John come in at some point. Then he heard John’s soft breathing even out as he fell asleep on the sofa. He didn’t even turn around. He would never admit it, but he wasn’t sure how to act toward John now. He was rather in the middle of working that out, as it were.
Sherlock raised his hand and gently brushed some hair out of John’s face. “To exclude John would do him more harm than good.”
Greg raised an eyebrow and cocked his head. “Well, I was right though, wasn’t I? Come on, gimme that much.”
Sherlock was lying on the ground some fifty feet away, pushing himself up on his arms. John instantly felt relief wash over him as he ran forward: Sherlock wasn’t unconscious and he couldn’t see any blood. “Sherlock, bloody hell, are you all right?” He quickly kneeled by him, checking him for injuries.
Once he got up with his dignity more or less intact, he raised his chin and schooled his features into a calm, neutral expression. He stepped into the kitchen, made a point of not looking at Mary and went straight for the kettle. The room smelled of coffee, shower gel and faint traces of laundered shirt. As the kettle began bubbling away, Sherlock grabbed a mug and a teabag, risking a glance in the direction of his unwelcome guest.
John didn’t ask a single question, simply taking it in stride that Sherlock had bribed one of Mycroft’s ‘actors’ to take them to the train station in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve.  The man drove without unnecessary small  talk as well, and so they spent the short trip in silence.
The sight of John in the hands of that killer turned his stomach. Usually, anyone who came this close to Moran once wasn’t long for this world.
He gently nuzzled Sherlock’s hair with his nose and allowed himself to press a chaste kiss on the detective’s head. And with several new realizations in his mind, he went back to sleep.
A shot rang out, but John couldn’t quite process it. Two fingers pressed into his throat, at exactly the right spot.
“She told me about somebody who sounded suspiciously like you being brought in with a bullet wound. I didn’t think anything of it until she mentioned the unsociable weirdo holding vigil in your room for two days and nights,” she said, sounding exasperated. “She said you barely made it out alive! What the hell happened?!”
“Ah! Good, you’re back,” Sherlock said as John put away the food and milk. “You should try this on.”
“You realise that nobody will really be surprised. They all thought we were shagging already, remember?” Sherlock drawled, stretched out on his back, his hands behind his head, a sheet draped artfully over his hips. John leaned on his elbow next to him and, his thoughts momentarily derailed, wished he could paint.
“He might have kidnapped him after the incident, yes. We do not know for sure, of course, but it is possible that he is using your former team mate to help him pick off his targets now.”
Mycroft had the grace to look uncomfortable and he glanced at John. “We lost track of him when Sherlock returned,” he explained, summarising a whole range of fights and squabbles to this one relative truth. His eyes flickered back between Sherlock and Mary. “But it is possible that it’s him, trying to exact revenge.”
that Irene Adler had basically wanted to shag him blind. He was a little obsessed with her at the time, but whenever it came to flirting, he looked mildly puzzled or, at best, disinterested. It was hard to tell, with Sherlock. John had been wildly jealous, he’d realised in hindsight.
“Alive?” Her eyes flickered to Sherlock. “As far as I can guess, four people. And that includes both of you.”
John’s arm must have snaked around him during the night and his fingers had tangled into Sherlock’s hair. His heart gave a little lurch at the thought of such a possessive gesture. He looked at John with his sleep-mussed hair and his comfortable pyjama pants and his t-shirt; clothes he could so easily be peeled out of at a moment’s notice—
“No,” he said. He thought of John with his girl – or boy, it didn’t matter – behind the gym. He thought of Sarah, who had broken it off and how John had not been too bothered. He thought of the nurse and all of the women who didn’t mind if John
at all. He had tried some experiments (Victor in the garden shed had probably been the most successful and even somewhat pleasurable), but it didn’t hold his interest for long. The mind, the work, was everything; nothing else could compare.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in interest and flipped open the file. He glanced at the picture before skimming the pertinent data. His face remained passive and he was quiet for a while after he finished reading, staring at the page. Finally, he gave a short huff. “Typical,” he groused, but there was something forgiving in his voice.
“Of course.” It sounded as if Mycroft had already known. “Could you tell her I need to see her when you speak to her next?”
Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly, waiting a moment before he replied. “There’s no need to apologize,” he said softly.
John gave her a rueful smile. “I honestly don’t know.” He sighed and looked back at the painting for a bit.
John looked up again and his smile dropped a little. Finally he saw. “Oh,” he said quietly. “Uh, okay. Well, I…” he seemed to have difficulties, and rather sounded as if he wished he could take his previous comment back now that he had to explain it. Sherlock sighed and was about to put him out of his misery when John continued. “I mean, it’s dark and there was a noise and there is...” he gestured between them again, unable to name what
Sherlock felt something bubble up inside him. He took a deep breath and then spoke quietly, with force. “You were going to leave the country, to never see him again. You wouldn’t even have said goodbye. And now that you decided you need help after all, you’re more than ready to accept his hospitality, because you know what kind of a man he is.” It wasn’t what he had meant to say at all. But there it was.
Sherlock was saying something. He sounded concerned. He felt Sherlock’s breathing in his hair. He vaguely registered that he was in his pyjamas, too, and even though that usually didn’t mean that he slept, he somehow felt a little softer around the edges.
“Uh, she was supposed to come over on Friday night. Dinner and a movie,” he smiled sadly. “I saw her last week Tuesday for lunch. I went to the police this Monday.”
He rubbed a hand over his once again clean-shaven face, looking at the person in the mirror. He looked a little thinner, perhaps still quite tired. There were a few more lines around his eyes and a slightly haunted quality to them that he hardly recognized.
Mary had rolled sideways off of Sherlock. She was holding her side with both hands, panting rapidly, shivering. Her face had gone deathly pale, sweat sticking strands of her hair to her forehead. John quickly assessed the angle, guessed where she’d been shot and knew that it wasn’t good. His battlefield training kicked in and he patted his jacket for anything—
He spotted the person he was looking for in the crowd and gave him a subtle sign with his hand. On the way, he politely nodded at faint acquaintances as well as perfect strangers when they looked at him with recognition in their eyes. Several small groups of people actually began whispering excitedly when they passed. John noticed it too. “Yep, still famous,” he said to Sherlock in an undertone as another woman leaned over to her husband, no doubt explaining who they were. “It’s going to be hard to keep a low profile like this.”
John tilted his head upwards ever so slightly and looked up from under sleep-heavy lashes. Sherlock shifted his head to see him better. John’s skin was creased from the pillow. He was a bit pale (
Sherlock sighed like a condemned man and shrugged. “Suit yourself. But don’t say I didn’t warn you,” he added darkly.
, his conscience muttered. “I live recklessly, because that’s how I like it,” he growled. “And I don’t need you, or my brother, or anyone breathing down my neck with all of their
they’d shared had finally kicked all of the physical sensations into overdrive that had been biding their time for the past weeks. These feelings had been growing ever since the pool. Or perhaps ever since John shot the cabbie. It didn’t matter. They were
He could see the same intensity in John’s eyes; saw the dilated pupils and his slightly parted lips. He was close enough to feel his friend’s breathing, John’s chest rising more obviously under his shirt than normal. He slowly raised his hand to John’s temple and lightly brushed his fingers through his hair. John’s eyelids fluttered nervously like tiny insect wings. Their heartbeats became a tangible presence between them.
Sherlock pressed his cheek slightly into John’s face. “All right,” he murmured. There was a note in his voice that sent a shiver down John’s back. And then, Sherlock turned his head ever so slightly, and his breath ghosted over John’s cheek. Lips were suddenly on his jaw, his cheek, searching and pressing and searching for contact a little awkwardly.
, that much was certain. Especially if they kept looking at each other as he suspected they were doing right now.
“A few scratches and bruises. But we’re fine.” He slowly let go and sat back on his heels, peering up at her.
Sherlock blinked rapidly. After staring at John for another minute or so, he finally nodded. “All right. I will say that I still believe that your loyalty is dangerous to your health. However, I know that you thrive under pressure and I think the cases we’ve been on together have brought out some of your more admirable qualities, so perhaps there is an overall gain to you.”
John thought of himself, standing by the grave, imagining Sherlock only meters away. He thought of his little speech.
Sherlock sent him a dramatic eye-roll and made for the door. When Mycroft stepped away, they were suddenly approached by Anthea – or whatever her name was – rapidly striding towards them, holding out a phone to Mycroft. "We have a situation," she said, and Sherlock tensed immediately.
Mary seemed to be locked in some kind of dodging dance with her opponent, evading and deflecting blows and attempted holds. Finally, the man pulled out a gun. Mary lunged for his arm in a desperate bid to wrench the gun away. They were struggling, locked in each other’s arms, the gracefulness of her previous movements replaced by a rough battle of strength.
“No, r-really, though,” he snorted. “When you’re on the couch or just prancing around the flat, you’re like a, a big cat,” John couldn’t stop giggling, and Sherlock felt himself grinning despite himself. John laughing had suddenly become his favourite sound in the world.
, but not obviously so. Had people let him know it? All the time – or just since… What else had Sherlock missed when he was away?
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade raised his hands to interrupt. “I get it. Not a word, Sherlock, I promise.” He smiled.
Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He was staring in utter delight into John’s eyes. His feet, thankfully, remembered what to do on their own, and John was more than competent, as predicted. He held on tight enough so he could lead wherever they needed to go, but was pliant enough to make the experience surprisingly pleasant. Sherlock’s higher brain functions were trying to make something out of the multitude of sensations assaulting his mind, but gave up pretty much immediately when John shifted a little closer and smiled up at him.
Just before they reached the door, it was flung open from inside. A woman with white hair and a large shawl wrapped around her shoulders appeared and beamed at them both. “Sherlock! Oh thank goodness!” She closed the distance between them and enveloped him in a firm, motherly hug. After a moment, John noticed she wasn’t letting go, but neither was Sherlock. His eyes were closed and it seemed like he was taking a deep breath. His mother seemed to be battling with tears, but after a firm sniff, she pulled herself together. “Oh,” she exclaimed, smiling at him lovingly with a slightly wobbly lip, quite too overcome to say anything else. And then Sherlock gently squeezed her arms that still clasped his shoulders and smiled at her, a bit unsteady. John’s heart gave a painful lurch. He felt like he was intruding.
The other people around him were a blur. Sherlock vaguely noticed being checked through and provided with a blanket. Someone led him over to the ambulance and maneuvred him inside, to sit with his friend. His head was feeling feverish and he stared unblinking at the paramedics hooking John up to an IV.
But... an insidious thought suddenly presented itself. Was it just physical? It certainly felt a bit different. The strange urge to simply
John was stepping closer, regarding him with a fond, yet almost pained expression. Sherlock took a moment to recognize it as
Sherlock gaped. Never in his entire life, including some very awkward teenage years, had Mycroft ever made any allusion to… Sherlock’s mind whirled before he finally registered the other thing Mycroft had spewed forth.
Sally’s eyes snapped up to meet his and she had the grace to look uncomfortable. However, she was still a proud woman and she quickly squared her shoulders and straightened up. “What does it matter? He doesn’t care,” she said sulkily.
And as much as Sherlock liked to think so, John wasn’t a complete idiot. He knew his friend and he knew blatant jealousy when he saw it. The pretty nurse had obviously been flirting with him, and Sherlock had obviously noticed.
His voice was much calmer than Sherlock knew he felt. But he was doing his special John Watson thing again, and it was working – Frederic calmed down a little. “You were…? Oh my God. Yes. Of course. Helen was released this morning and came here. She only told me bits of it, but she seemed
territory and he swallowed. He turned to look at Sherlock when he didn’t reply. Sherlock was still frowning at the window in thought.
Sherlock furtively cast his eyes around. The motor of the van was still running and someone was sitting at the wheel, ready to go. Another black-clad figure with a machine gun stood guard next to the cottage door. Sherlock wondered where Norbury had gotten to; was she simply asleep in bed? Or was she watching, making sure it all went off without a hitch?
, Sherlock’s subconscious offered, and he felt the cold twist of jealousy in his guts. He remembered John, on the sofa back at Baker Street, putting his hand on Sherlock’s arm, looking into his eyes.
Mary waved a hand. “Oh! Don’t worry about me. Mycroft actually asked me to stay and work on some stuff with him and some board of inquiry or something…”
His face inched a little closer, almost without his doing. All of a sudden, there seemed to be a magnetic quality to what little space remained between them. He could hear John’s breath catch in his throat. He was just about to formulate a plan on how to continue this particular experiment, when a brisk knock on the door stopped him in his tracks. The door was opened immediately, without so much of an acknowledgement from either of them, and Sherlock drew back sharply, gliding off the bed in one fluid movement.
John laughed. He tilted his head to one side and then shrugged. “No, me either,” he said, and Mary grinned. They shared a moment of looking at each other and all John could think was,
“That makes me still ahead of you. It’s like your stuff has multiplied since we got here,” John said casually, as if the air wasn’t singing between them. As if he wasn’t feeling every minute shift of Sherlock’s muscles under his palm. He brushed his thumb over the shirt a little, revelling in the warmth and familiarity of the living body – a body he was definitely standing too close to. He felt thrilled and bold at his openness, but maybe Sherlock didn’t understand that John had every intention of acting on his feelings. Slowly but surely.
Sherlock swallowed. Shooting Moran… it had happened so quickly, in a life or death situation; he hadn’t exactly wanted to do it, but there hadn’t been a choice. If he hadn’t, John would be dead. He suddenly remembered a case, almost two years ago, when a mysterious army doctor had waltzed into his life and shot someone for him the next day. He could finally relate.
“OH! John, it’s you. Good.” He spun around and grabbed John’s shoulder. He gave him a conspiratorial wink. “You can help.”
John glanced once again at the piece of paper the homeless man had pressed into his hand before disappearing into an alley. He memorised the note, then threw it away. With the reassuring weight of his Browning tucked in his jacket, he made his way to the nearest tube station.
Their first day in Hampshire passed quietly and comfortably. They had some tea, unpacked, and then Sherlock showed John the house. Mummy and Father left them alone for the most part to get settled in, but Sherlock also made a point of speaking to his mother whenever the chance presented itself, and she seemed to appreciate that.
“Well,” John chuckled and he poked Sherlock in the shoulder. “That, my dear detective, might be because I actually do care and empathise.”
“Uh, I—am not sure,” he began. He cleared his throat. He hadn’t expected to really just come out and say what was on his mind. Excuses were usually what people went with in a situation such as this.
“But wouldn’t it be better if I was—out of the way, it would all be over and Freddy would be free,” she reasoned, sounding hopeful. Grasping at straws. And that wasn’t a good sign.
John kept his hold on him. “Now before you run, you listen to me, all right? It’s Greg’s birthday today, I just remembered when I saw the pub. He’s my friend, so I’m going to have a drink with him. He was your friend long before I even knew him, therefore I think you should definitely have a drink with him.”
“The serial adulterer from Finance. He handed in a bill for no less than five dinner engagements in one month, all logged as work related. If it had been his wife, he wouldn’t have gotten through with it so easily – but shagging colleagues is apparently encouraged here,” Sherlock’s voice was bright and cheering, as if he was describing the perks of working for the government.
“Wait! What are we even doing here?” John held Sherlock back before he could move on. “I mean, what if she’s
“Ah. Yes,” he said, and placed a bag he’d been carrying on the floor. He began looking through the drawers on the cart, much easier to do with two hands free. He finally pulled out a roll of plaster and cut off a strip. “Here, let me.”
“There’s a case,” Sherlock said. A mask slid back into place and his face looked impassive again. Back in control. John wished it was that easy for him.
“Did you hear that? Your brother thinks we’re charming,” John observed and Sherlock favoured him with another deep chuckle.
He opened up the text conversation with Mary and realised that this was the longest they hadn’t spoken or texted since they met. Usually, he saw her at work, and after they started dating they often had a chat during breaks, or, if she was working night shifts, they texted. Now, the last thing she’d written was that she would be a few minutes late to the art gallery.
John took his hand and held the man’s gaze for a moment. There was kindness and firmness there, and John thought he saw something of the shape of Sherlock’s eyes. However, Sherlock had something else as well, a sharpness, a keen edge of wit and intelligence that struck you even before he opened his mouth.
It was the pleading that did it. John swallowed as a heavy pain settled around his heart. Suddenly, he understood. Sherlock was completely wrong, he was sure of it. But he didn’t see it, because he was jealous and traumatized by all he had experienced at the hand of Moran’s people. He was afraid. And frightened people generally made
He felt some of the adrenaline ebb away now, replaced with a painful certainty in his stomach. Suddenly, he felt afraid. He sniffed the air and looked around in the darkness, scuffing his boot against one of the shelves. “We’re not getting out of this one by ourselves, are we?”
Molly sent him a grateful smile and they went in search of the morgue’s tiny kitchen. Molly unceremoniously dumped her pile of papers on a counter and began busying herself with the coffee machine. “So! How have you been,” she began, trying to sound chipper, yet sounding sadder than ever.
Almost as if his eyes strayed to follow his thoughts, Sherlock looked up. He saw the kitchen window from where he stood, and he saw John, looking out at him. He was holding a mug, and if Sherlock’s eyes were not deceiving him entirely, he appeared rather
John was blushing a little, but steadily kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s, trying to look nonchalant. But Sherlock knew him better. “You okay?” he asked.
“So what?” Sherlock grumbled. “It’s an arbitrary date to which humans decided to ascribe significance. They make sentimental resolutions that they won’t keep, just so they can feel better about themselves for a few days. It’s an excuse to get drunk, as if we needed another; it’s tedious. I’m just waiting out here until everybody leaves.”
“He was the one who was supposed to... If I hadn’t jumped.” Sherlock balled his fist, and he had to look away from John for a moment.
John leaving was absolutely unacceptable. His life... and John’s life... had become so much better since they lived at Baker Street together. Sherlock knew he’d cope on his own, of course he would. He had before. But suddenly, he didn’t want to any more. Life was suddenly, surprisingly, more enjoyable, and
“No,” Freddy sighed. “She apparently took sick leave. But she never told me she was sick, and the last time I saw her she didn’t seem ill at all.”
, John thought, glancing at the pile of debris that Sherlock had dumped on his own bed. “So you’re just… going to sit there?”
John felt anger rising, his cheeks flushing. “Yes, I know. But I’d have to start somewhere, wouldn’t I?”
John made a disgusted face that warmed Sherlock’s heart with its genuineness. “You… are great, all right? Good.”
An odd, searching expression crossed John’s face. “It was nice,” he said, glancing away. “Although I think I am not into impressionism as much as I thought I was.”
Sherlock lowered his head to hide a rather boyish grin and, John was sure, a bit of a blush. “I don’t know what you mean,” he said, turning away.
A very becoming blush crept up on John’s cheeks. Sherlock was about to comment on it when his mobile rang. John’s eyes flickered to the desk. Sherlock ignored it and continued to stare at John, who raised an eyebrow in question. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, blocked out the sound of the mobile, and focussed on the colours in John’s eyes instead. His right hand was still resting intimately over John’s hipbone, and he began moving his thumb over the soft skin there again. He felt John react ever so slightly, a small tremor that went through his entire body and sent chills of anticipation through Sherlock. John blinked quickly and his lips parted like he wanted to say something, but then he pressed them together sharply, searching Sherlock’s face. Thinking, hard. He could almost hear him.
Once again, he wondered when he had begun changing his mind. Perhaps it was having nothing but John on his mind during his absence, representative of all he missed at home. Perhaps it was the shock of seeing John again, being back at Baker Street, having all these feelings suddenly rush in to fill the void of the past six months. Yes, that was a likely explanation. He would get used to it and then he would think no more of
“Bravo, Watson.” Holmes said, and I rolled my eyes, and gestured for him to continue dictating the report of one Mrs. E. Knightley, a gentlewoman jewelry thief whom I was eager to hear the details of.
Right on cue, the bell rang downstairs. I rose from my seat and looked to Holmes, who did not move but merely sipped at his coffee. His eyebrows raised, a challenge just like in my dream, and I frowned but accepted, descending the seventeen steps.
At this familiar disrespect Mrs. Hudson regained some color. “He denied tea when I asked, in favor of some water for his friend, who didn’t speak a word while I saw him, and I only left then but a minute for me to fetch some water.” She looked down at her lap before admitting one last thing. “I didn’t see the former leave sir, but I did hear the door shut sometime after, though at the time I assumed it was Billy back after forgetting his umbrella again.”
“You may leave the door open too, to hear anything running afoot, but also to see me in the sitting room should you need me. I will keep a fire going in any case, so everything should be visible to you.” He looked to me hopefully, but I could tell that he brooked no argument.
Macnair launched into some explanation of the current landscape of his office’s politics and a colleague who was clearly in the wrong. I did my best to listen intently, but I was still on a case, and I shifted slowly in my seat so I may once again seek Holmes in the crowd. From my new angle I could see that he had moved down the bar, now in conversation with a man I recognized by face alone.
The younger gentleman considered it for one long minute, before nodding gamely. “Yes. I want to help in what way I can. Besides, it is as Mr. Holmes said, I am already involved in some way if he took attention of me last night.”
“Really?” I could not help myself from asking. This particular club had a substantial but not large clientele base, and so it was not unusual for us to know bits of each other’s business, more so in Macnair’s case. A journalist as he was by day, the man never truly lost his habits and thrived on gossip like no one else I knew, barring of course, my own Holmes.
“He gave me a wide grin and said you had set up an appointment this late for his own convenience. He apologized, and was otherwise very polite, sir, so I allowed them in..”
He was distraught, and looked to me with an abundance of feeling like I had never seen in him, and emotions that could not have been possible even if I were dreaming. Desperation. Longing. And yet here he stood before me, living and breathing and
He was being needlessly kind. It was the sort of tone he used when handling clients of a softer nature: younger ones who had been cheated, ladies who had been mistreated, or good working-class people put into dire straits by men more powerful and more wealthy than they were human. A part of me rebuffed the need to be taken care of, but I also recognized that it took a special sort of man to contain the depths and values that Sherlock Holmes did. I was grateful, and so I would tell him all that was needed, for both our sakes.
When Sherlock hit the bed, he dropped down to sit and pulled John closer. For a moment, Sherlock’s curls brushed against his stomach and suddenly his nimble fingers got to work on his belt. John could feel the heat tightening within and felt himself getting harder. “Sherlock,” he stuttered, “maybe this is a bit—“
“Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock’s voice sounded cracked and raspy. He stepped closer, mindful of the broken debris under his bare feet. His dressing gown, he noted, was torn in several places, and it looked like he was covered in plaster dust from head to toes. He shook his curls and some pieces of glass rained down from them.
Mary chuckled. “Wow he really was right about you,” she said, but didn’t elaborate. Once again, Sherlock was dying to know what John had said about him. “Yes,” she continued. “During my jobs, I learned to be quiet… in a way that probably unsettles normal people.”
Her eyes snapped to Sherlock. “Please spare us, Mr Holmes,” she sighed, but the flicker of annoyance in her face spurred him on.
Mycroft laughed softly, still reclining in his armchair, his eyes close and his hands folded on his chest. “Hardly,” he murmured. “I lowered my expectations years ago.”
At dinner, John and Sherlock luckily found themselves seated with a few actually interesting members of the higher echelons of society. John was absorbed by a debate about something military-related with the older man next to him; Sherlock didn’t really follow it.
The only thing that registered outside of them was the woman, gently placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “He’s gonna make it,” she said. Sherlock’s eyes snapped to hers and he glanced her up and down quickly.
He felt sad for Molly at that thought and also a little concerned for himself. He shouldn’t allow himself to think of Sherlock that way; it would only make things harder for him in the long run. He was happy that he was getting his life back, and he was relieved, so the confusing dreams of kissing Sherlock were probably just a… mental manifestation of his relief? Perhaps he was simply overcompensating for six months of emptiness by spurting an overabundance of affection now?
“Sergej!” Moran yelled and stepped carefully to the side of the open wing of the door. He gripped his pistol tightly, training it on Sherlock. His eyes flitted back and forth between him and the side of the van.
Lestrade laughed. A big, warm belly laugh. Sherlock had to admit he liked the sound. “You bastard,” Lestrade said under his grin. “You utter bastard.”
Sherlock heaved a sigh and sank down in one of the armchairs again. He stared into the dying embers of the fire. After a few minutes in thought, he shook his head. His mind was conjuring up the same images again and again: John nestled closely against his chest. John looking up at him with that so very fond look that softened his eyes. John, exasperated, evidently wrecked by such weighty sentiment that he was shouting, talking of regret.
John gaped at the woman, whose dress revealed the bare expanse of her back, and blinked in confusion. “What the hell…?”
He slowly travelled upwards and tangled one hand into Sherlock’s hair. At the touch of John’s hand sliding up the skin of his neck, Sherlock released the most incredible quiet moan into their kiss. John’s heart skipped a beat as the sound struck him at his core. He tried to press closer into Sherlock, pulling his head towards him.
The elevator arrived and, fortunately for Sherlock, contained a doctor, which effectively killed their conversation.
“No. What counts now is the goods. If we find them, we’ll flush them out sooner or later anyway. But I think… they’ll be here.”
“What? Peaceful retirement in Hampshire, you told me – and here we are. I’m not missing this for the world.” John thought it sounded rather as if he had simply been invited over for Christmas by the Holmes family – he wished it was true, and the circumstances less dire.
“I agree, except I don’t know where she is, either,” John continued and Sherlock frowned. “I texted her this morning and again just now, but she’s not replying.”
“John, this… being together, with me, it’s… I’m not…” he began, searching for the right words, but John cut him off.
Lestrade was watching them with some amusement. “Huh,” he huffed, drawing his own conclusions, no doubt. And for once, they’d be correct, John remembered.
When John came in late that night, Sherlock was in the kitchen with an experiment. Examining the composition of the dirt on the windowpane was pretty negligible in the grand scheme of things, but it gave him something to do. John hung up his jacket and then looked in the kitchen. “Hello – still up then?” he smiled, knowing that Sherlock slept very little, of course; but he always made nonsensical statements like this, regardless. It was nice to see that some part of their routine was returning.
and while that was fine by him, he knew he wouldn’t be able to (nor want to) conform to normal expected relationship parameters. Oh, he could sham it, of course – but John would know. And then he’d leave. Despite John’s devotion, Sherlock still believed that to be the most likely outcome.
He took in John’s appearance from top to bottom in a few seconds. He had recently eaten at a pub. One pint. Judging by his attitude, he seemed to have had a good time, and knowing John, probably more fun at the pub than at the gallery. He still hadn’t gone home with Mary. Also, he still hadn’t slept with Mary in general; Sherlock was pretty sure about that. The thought spurred on the slight hope he had allowed himself since earlier, even though he was completely oblivious as to why John having or not having sex with anyone should have that effect on him. The thought of John having sex at all suddenly made him feel a bit of a lurch in his stomach, as if the floor beneath him had given way. He realised he was staring.
John’s eyes were riveted on Sherlock, on his eyes, on his arm, ready to detect the slightest change in tension. He kicked off the ground almost before his friend pulled the trigger.
He waited like this until he heard heavy boots and shouts on the stairs. Mycroft’s people had finally shown up. John let go of him and they slowly got to their feet. John held on to him until they were both sure they wouldn’t topple over again. Mary crawled out from behind the couch and with a hiss, heaved herself on the cushions and sighed in pain.
on his violin. When he was done, he turned around and John could just make out a genuine, lovely smile.
Sherlock’s eyes widened just a fraction and John guessed that he understood at least some of what he’d tried to tell him. He looked away and was quiet now, for once actually listening. John took the chance. “You asked me once whether caring about people will help save them. I don’t think so. But I can’t help but feel for them; it’s just a natural reaction for me. And I think it helps to understand them and their situation better.” He looked at Sherlock again. “You use your amazing brain to solve cases. I use my… intuition, if you will, to help.”
them to be a couple? Oh dear. John becoming sentimental about it might lead to him expecting all sorts of things from him, which Sherlock would be unable to provide. Then John would be upset that Sherlock didn’t play by the mysterious relationship rulebook that John had learned by heart at some point. And he’d be disappointed and...
“I told you they’d turn on you, and they did,” John continued. “And look at them now. Not so eager to condemn you this time around, are they?”
“Thank you.” John, clearly done standing attention, slumped over and fell against Sherlock’s shoulder.
How meeting ‘Richard Brook’ convinced him that he had to complete the strange succession of fairy tales. That Moriarty was just mad enough that it could work if Sherlock pretended to play along. Moriarty killing himself, the snipers, everything – how Sherlock thought he had him, but he had to complete the plan to protect John, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.
John glowered at his phone. What the hell was that supposed to mean? “Interfering git,” he muttered. Sherlock didn’t care whether or not John was still dating Mary, he never did. It was a miracle if he even remembered a name. John plopped down on the bed, contemplating his phone a moment. He’d thought that Mycroft was handling everything in the background, but there was definitely something more going on and nobody was telling him anything about it.
John sent Sherlock a look and before he could stop himself, he said, “can’t have been more comfortable than our staircase.” Sherlock’s mouth shut with an audible click and he narrowed his eyes at John, sending him a look that spoke volumes
Mycroft’s laugh was without humour. “I just might,” he said. “There was not a hair out of place, no forced entry, no prints, of course… and only one thing was missing. Mary’s file.”
John stood at the checkout of Tesco’s, wrestling a few groceries into a paper bag when a noise made him look up. The young woman at the till was obviously new there and seemed a little flustered. John had gone through the checkout mostly looking at his feet, shuffling along and getting out his wallet automatically without thinking. But then she must have made some mistake. The anxious fussing startled John out of his autopilot. She apologized profusely, sending worried glances to the people waiting behind him in line.
Mycroft, still in this peculiar mood, simply nodded. Then, a somewhat fond smile appeared on his lips. Sherlock blinked, sure he must be imagining things. “Good luck with everything, little brother,” Mycroft said warmly.
They had all recovered a little from their scare that morning, supported by copious amounts of tea and biscuits. A big van with a cleaning company’s name on it had picked them up, dropped them in an alley somewhere, only for them to be picked up by individual, nondescript cars again, taking them in roundabout ways to this little safe house.
It was only a matter of minutes before Sherlock had unceremoniously ushered out a laughing Lestrade and dragged John back to bed, his tea unfinished on the coffee table.
. Moran grabbed John’s hands roughly and forced them behind his back. John grunted, but kept his composure, defiance in his eyes. Sherlock felt his heart thud heavily in his chest at the sight.
and thought that his mother had been in luck to find him. She was the brilliant one in the family, her sharp wit and scientific curiosity passed on tenfold to Mycroft and Sherlock. His father often referred to himself as ‘the moron’ of the family, even if that was only ever applicable by the unfair comparison. Yet when Sherlock looked at his father, he felt something completely different respond in himself. There was that quietness, too; that purely emotional, non-rational sense of understanding that Sherlock felt growing in his mind since his return. He really had changed – in a way that seemed to have scrambled his insides and dug up feelings and ideas and characteristics from the very bottom of his soul, from his very genes, and dragged them into the light.
Sherlock chose this moment to come in and flung his arms around John’s shoulders from behind, pressing a kiss into his hair. John felt a flush creeping up his cheeks. He was still completely unused to the kind of random affection he was suddenly getting, still only beginning to understand the slow transformation the cold, distant Sherlock Holmes had undergone; so a public display of their relationship was another cause for amazement.

“Jooohn,” Sherlock whined and squirmed in his arms. John felt a now familiar warmth spread through him as he registered their proximity. He decided to take a chance for once and lowered his voice.
They both looked away and Sherlock quickly suggested following the crowd in to dinner before either of them felt the need to say anything else. It wasn’t until later that he realised that they had just been addressed as a couple again, and neither of them had denied it.
Moran pushed them to the back of the van, nodding for the armed man to follow. He pulled the handle and levered open the two back doors with the other, his gun hand momentarily busy. Sherlock felt his heart speed up and adrenaline kick in.
friends; but Sherlock had never been interested in all the rest of it. Women, to start with, weren’t his thing; he’d found that out early enough. But most men he’d met were so unaccountably
“Difficult to say, sir, since we don’t know who we’re looking for,” Evans replied, still professional, but with a touch of unease.
The people moving boxes faded from John’s perception; in fact, everything except Sherlock’s face was blown clean out of his mind. Sherlock took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh that conveyed so much more than words could. And then he leaned forward ever so slowly, and gently rested his forehead against John’s. As if this wasn’t overwhelming enough, Sherlock closed his eyes and just took another deep breath, steadying himself, breathing in John, and John felt his breath on his face and was reeling with the gentleness of the gesture, and he could feel some of Sherlock’s soft curls pressed against him and his heart was hammering in his chest and all he could hear was the blood rushing through his ears with the heavy beats—
’ every time my mother gossiped over the phone with people.” He made a faint imitation of his mother’s voice and Sherlock laughed, his deep voice rumbling. He finished buttoning John’s cuffs, but was still fidgeting with the fabric, straightening it a little.
“I’m sorry, it was just the way you said it…” John began, grinning, and then sighed. He turned to face Sherlock again. “Okay. I’m sorry. I’ll try and explain. Here it goes.” He waited for Sherlock to look over. The detective noticed that John wore a more serious expression now.
He had one arm behind his head, a rather sweaty and wonderfully warm John resting on his chest. Sherlock had his other arm around him and played with the hair in his nape.
Sherlock began working on the computer, scoffing at the simplicity of guessing someone’s password and taking it from there – as usual. John began methodically looking through the cabinet. The office around him was silent except for the slight humming of the computer. Sherlock was sitting straight, fingers flying over the keyboard, clad in his ridiculously well-fitted dinner suit. Illuminated by the blueish light from the monitor, he almost looked otherworldly.
It was later than late now. Of the NSY group, only a lightly snoring Lestrade remained leaning back against the wall in their corner. Sherlock was silently pleased to finally have his blogger to himself again. Whilst it had been a surprisingly entertaining evening, he itched to be alone again. Alone at Baker Street. With John. Somehow, he didn’t count as ‘other people’ any more.
John smiled, feeling his face relax. “Thank you, Sherlock.” He carefully re-wrapped the cookies he had baked and put them into his jacket pocket. “I’ll hold on to them for later.”
“I take that as a compliment,” he said, with a slight incline of his head. They sipped their wine in silence for a moment. Mary was someone next to whom one could stand quietly without it feeling uncomfortable – yet Mycroft remembered that he did have a reason he’d been meaning to talk to her again. There was something he’d been wondering about, throughout this entire case.
Sherlock leaned even closer into John so that his mouth was hovering over his ear. He thought he heard John’s breath catch again. “Yes, I
“Sherlock,” he murmured, his voice dropping low. He trailed his hand up Sherlock’s abdomen and felt a shiver under his palm. “Come to bed with me?”
John shuffled to the bathroom and got himself cleaned up, brushed his teeth and immediately felt better for it. He let himself relax, enjoying the feeling of being in a warm, clean space again. When he came back into the room, Sherlock was still sprawled on his stomach, his arms curled around one of the crisp white pillows, and he seemed to be dozing off.
“Right,” John got up. “I’m sorry I—“ He looked at Sherlock, and Sherlock wondered whether he could see the rising panic beneath the calm exterior. “No scratch that, I’m not sorry I barged in. I’m glad I know now.” His fist clenched a couple of times. “I’ll let you get on. Good night, Sherlock.”
". He felt the smooth planes of Sherlock’s chest against his, the pressure on his back and front and it nearly made his knees weak. "Okay," he conceded weakly, his hips moulding against Sherlock’s just right. "Perhaps… I swing a bit more both ways than I originally thought."
“Yes, but I’ve been made to wear black tie for every family event since I was twelve. I’ve had more practise than you.”
Once they were settled in the lab, Sherlock went straight to work. He produced the satchels of fibres and dirt and whatever else he’d scraped off of poor Mr Blanchard and began mixing chemicals, sorting drops of various liquids onto glass plates and in petri dishes.
Sherlock smiled back, regarding his friend. He took a deep breath. Whatever happened, they’d be fine.
Sherlock felt the commanding voice reverberate through his core. They were arguably in the worst kind of situation, yet John was in control. He marvelled how he did it. And he realised that even though Moran was probably out there, waiting, trying to pick them off one by one… Sherlock wasn’t worried about himself. He felt John’s arms around him and John’s chest heaving beneath him. John’s strong voice holding them all together. Moran was the one who should be worried once John Watson got on his trail.
John Watson sat in his chair, his bare feet curled into the carpet, lost to his thoughts. He stared unblinking out of the window. The summer heat of the day was finally fading, the sun had long dipped behind the tall London buildings. John had no idea how long he had been sitting still. He hadn’t yet bothered to turn on the light, so he sat in the slowly growing darkness, staring at the empty chair in front of him. The silence in the flat pressed heavily on his ears.
“This is amazing, Richard, thank you,” John looked positively gleeful as he devoured the rest of his toast. Sherlock made a mental note to bring lots of his father’s honey back to Baker Street with them.
“Oh yes,” she said emphatically, grinning at him now. She stood up, glancing at her watch. “Perhaps you and him should have a little talk. You know, from one crazy person to another. Gotta go, my break’s almost over.”
John swallowed and suddenly realised what she meant and why they needed to have this conversation. “I think you’re pretty great, too,” he said, slowly. “In fact, I keep reminding myself how perfect you are, Mary.”
When the light had slowly dipped across the meadow and the morning dew was shining in the winter sun, Sherlock felt a hand on his back. Mummy had come downstairs, as silent on her feet as Sherlock. She leaned into him, rubbing his back, her small form a comforting weight against his arm. Sherlock swallowed and put an arm around her, and they stood there for a long while, looking out at the garden. He was glad that she understood him so well, out of all of them. She didn’t need to say anything. He knew exactly what she was telling him.
“Perfect, as I plan to bring about the end to this wretched business tonight, and I will need your instrumental presence there for the events to play out accordingly. Very soon we will be entertaining someone who is to serve in the little scheme I have constructed.”
This new telling of events heightened the involvement of James Abbott. Holmes claimed that Douglas Macnair had had an affair with the former’s sister, but Abbott had heard rumors of Macnair’s exploits, and so as the protective brother he had broken their engagement, spurring Macnair’s ire. The latter had then begun taunting Abbott with the murdered lookalikes, with the flowers being a result of the sister’s affinity for floriography. It was only at my own coincidental discovery of them at his club and subsequent invitation to sup at Baker Street that the altercation had broken out and resolved itself. Abbott had stepped in, and acted in order to save Holmes’ life, and should be therefore treated with leniency.
Behind them, Mary was already on her feet. She’d grabbed her gun and in two long strides she was at the large French windows, yanking at the handles.
Sherlock left them to it and went to sit in the front seat, tapping rapidly on his phone. John hoped Mycroft could organise them the quickest airlift to the nearest hospital. He did what he could with the limited supplies in the kit, re-wrapped the scarf around the wounds tightly and wrapped Mary up in Sherlock’s coat for warmth.
. John sighed and glanced at Sherlock. The detective seemed deep in thought, which was odd, seeing as Sherlock used every possible opportunity to berate clients about their ill-suited relationships. Right now, the silent figure seemed more preoccupied with the dog in John’s lap for some reason.
“O-kay…?” John ventured, a bit confused now. He searched her face and took in her expression. “Is this a break-up conversation?”
After this, the whole day was nothing but a trial. He tried working on locating Norbury’s house, he reviewed some files for Mycroft, but it was tedious work. What was less tedious, all of a sudden, was watching John helping Mummy bake cookies. He had his sleeves rolled up, his strong, capable hands covered in flour, kneading the dough. The images that sprang unbidden to Sherlock’s mind at that were decidedly not kitchen-appropriate, yet he couldn’t look away. John caught his look a few times with a hopeful spark in his eyes, and perhaps that was why he volunteered to be in charge of the next two doughs as well. John was too observant, Sherlock decided, allowing a smile.
John realised then that nobody he was close to – Mike, Greg or even Mrs Hudson – ever needed to talk to him about it, nor did they seem to want to. They all
“I love you,” Sherlock said, looking impressed and amazed all at once. Whether he was amazed at John or his own admission, John had no intention of pondering at this time.
He barely noticed that he had stepped closer. Suddenly, he was almost chest to chest with John, who glanced up with a worried look. He saw his tongue poking out briefly, licking his lips. An unfamiliar heat grew in Sherlock, working its way up from his stomach through his throat, catching his breath; his heart beat faster and his skin felt flushed. Some still sober part of his brain catalogued all of these sensations for later examination, but otherwise… there was something inescapable about his body taking over from here. Somewhere in the recesses of his mind palace, a certain shelf cracked and tumbled to the ground, evaporating into simplicity.
“It’s just… I’m never quite sure where I stand, you know? Until now I hadn’t even considered I might, uh, be into…”
John pulled himself away from Sherlock’s lips to explore; he pressed desperate kisses to the long, slender neck and under the earlobe, at which Sherlock gave a delightful tremble. In between, he kept whispering John’s name, as if he couldn’t believe he was there. John raked his fingers through the black curls, sighing in contented bliss.
John’s head snapped around from where he’d been looking out of the window. “Why not?” He swallowed heavily, frowning. It was not what he’d expected to hear at all.
Finally the man opened his eyes again, blinking. He turned his head to face John. “Taking all the variables into account, there is of course a certain amount of speculation included,” he stated.
“Hotel. You need some sleep. We’re not going back to London before we’ve seen her anyway, and this—“ he held out his phone, which showed a hotel website “—looks much more suitable than these chairs.”
Sherlock marvelled. “Very observant. I used to take classes as a teenager,” he admitted quietly, delighting once again in telling John something personal that he’d practically never told anybody.
In between long silences, he asked very specific questions which Lestrade had mostly been able to answer. When he wasn’t sure about a certain detail (such as “was the victim a healthy eater” or “when was she last on a bus”), Sherlock waved it away as if it mattered little. Lestrade was surprised, he’d expected his friend to berate him for his lack of thoroughness – something he’d gotten used to over the last years. But the man seemed almost uncharacteristically distracted. Occasionally, he glanced at the sleeping John, as if making sure he was still there.
“Go on then.” Sherlock whisked his phone out and sent a quick text to Molly, warning her that they’d stop by. He hadn’t seen her yet since his return, and hoped she wouldn’t mind that the first time he’d show up it would be on a case.
Sherlock pulled John a little away from her, to put some distance between targets. Mary’s form disappeared into the mist and now all they could do was run. They dashed across the beautiful winter lawn, the bird bath and the stupid ornaments appearing one moment and disappearing the next, their feet crunching in the frozen grass. They made it to the first tied-up bush when they heard another shot from their left. Mary must have spotted Moran and fired a warning shot towards the house, not to hit, but to keep him away long enough.
Without further ado, he turned around and John followed, telling himself that he would pay him back for his restraint tenfold later, even if he wasn’t quite sure how yet.
John stared at him for a bit longer, trying to figure out what his bloody game was now. Sherlock was riling him up and he
. Maybe Mycroft wasn’t a complete idiot for hiring her. Sherlock tugged on John’s hand and they pressed themselves against the wall again.
, looking more in agony than John had ever seen him, looking, in fact, exactly as miserable as John felt all the time now, making
John let go of him then and threw up his arms. “Oh shut up, genius, you deduced that last week when you overheard me talking to Helen!”
The next day, John woke up and took some time to simply process things. He was still not due back at the clinic; he was supposed to recuperate after the concussion for the rest of the week. And seeing as the previous day didn’t really qualify as ‘recuperating’, he decided to just stay in bed for a bit.
They decided to split up so as to not draw attention. John went to the bathrooms while Sherlock disappeared into the crowd. John was glad for a moment to gather his wits. Bloody
She raised her chin. “I didn’t see the point, and neither did Montgomery. ‘Let sleeping dogs lie’ is my motto. Montgomery is—
Sherlock’s breath hitched and it sounded loud in the still cellar. John felt his head dip slightly. A stray curl brushed his cheek. Very quietly, Sherlock said, “of course I do.”
Sherlock sighed and regarded her with narrowed eyes for a moment. “No, I think I see your point. Your husband would not have asked your opinion if he hadn’t thought you’d provide some insight.”
“No,” Mycroft assented, but then gave her another appraising glance. “But I believe apart from your attraction to traumatised army surgeons you do have other rather admirable qualities. Worth another look, certainly.”
The long coat settled on Sherlock's shoulders with its reassuring weight, and for the first time, he felt like he was really back. Their private plane had taken them back to London two days ago, yet Sherlock had been confined to Mycroft’s bloody club since then ‘for security reasons’. Mycroft’s impeccable assistant had seen to it that he was clothed and fed and had everything he needed, except that had yet to return to 221B Baker Street. He had thought it best if he didn’t show up there looking like an emaciated homeless person, shocking John even more than necessary.
The widow acknowledged this with a dignified incline of her head. She poured both him and John a cup of tea. “Brief and to the point. I appreciate that, Mr Holmes,” she said. “And no, your Detective Inspector,” she nodded towards the door, where Lestrade stood, taking notes, “has already asked me all the
Sherlock’s lips curling at the sight, he decided to join the conversation. “Well. Ideally, you left the bees enough honey in the first place. But you can add more if it’s not enough.”
John’s breathing calmed a little. “I understand,” he said after a moment. His voice was still rough from sleep, but it hitched a little in his throat, higher than usual. “But—I need to see him.”
She glanced back at John and Sherlock. “I think I could do with something a little more exciting, to be honest.”
John sighed. Perhaps this was his way of showing he wanted to be close, and John wasn’t going to say no to that opportunity. Perhaps he simply had to be patient and see how things developed.
As they arrived and stepped out of the taxi, it hit him. He slapped a hand in front of his mouth, checked his phone, then looked at Sherlock. A small grin spread on his face.
The discussion went on for some time; evidence was looked at, files scanned. There was a moment when John felt that everything had gone back to normal, but then he and Sherlock were stooping over a folder together, talking through the facts and John got the feeling he was being watched and led along. He noticed Sherlock smiling at him in that seductive coaxing manner that dared John to give this one a go.
all by himself in his brain to get them over with, predicting what you would say and informing you of the result minutes before you even opened your mouth. The kettle boiled and John took a deep breath. He turned on his heel to get to it, but instead walked straight into six solid feet of Sherlock Holmes.
John smiled in surprise, feeling pleased. “Uh, thank you. And it’s John,” he added amicably. At least someone today was polite and normal, he thought. It made for a relaxing change.
John immediately switched off the tiny torch, plunging the room into darkness. A faint blue glow from the computer was the only light in the office. John held his breath as his eyes adjusted and his ears focussed on the noise. Sherlock suddenly darted forward, switched off the monitor and then gripped his wrist and pulled him swiftly aside.
He bounced backwards off the bed in one fluid motion. In a few long strides, he was in their suite’s sitting room. His bare feet made no sound on the plush carpets. The exquisite apartment was furnished with lavish mahogany furniture, art pieces and a marble fireplace on one side. Sherlock wasn’t sure if all the expense was for his benefit or for Mycroft’s or if his brother simply got these kinds of accommodations as a matter of course without really thinking about it. Sherlock had always been used to money, of course, but even he thought this was excessive. Perhaps being stuck in hideouts in the middle of bloody nowhere for months rearranged your priorities. At this point, he would trade all the shiny mahogany in this suite for his chair back at Baker Street.
“I swear I will be a perfect gentleman,” John smirked, hanging up some decorations on their newly glazed windows.
The doctor nodded politely. But he was already smiling and John slowly felt his stomach unclench. “Ms Morstan is going to be fine. She was quite lucky. Her internal injuries were less severe than we first thought. She’d lost a lot of blood, but she is stable now. She’ll be in recovery, sleeping for most of the day,” he continued, glancing from John to Sherlock and back, the ‘
John returned their empty glasses and ordered three fresh pints. He realized that he couldn’t just keep buying drinks whenever he began feeling awkward or they’d be crawling home. As he was waiting to be served, he noticed two pretty girls standing next to him, having a hushed conversation. They were scantily dressed and cast their eyes over the patrons, clearly on the prowl. Suddenly, he caught snatches of their giggling tête-à-tête.
“John. Sherlock,” Donovan said with a nod and turned around to follow Lestrade across the hall. John’s eyebrows rose dramatically and he shared a bewildered look with Sherlock, who looked equally amused.
, really?” Sherlock looked up from under his deliriously long lashes and gave him a small, amused smile. “That’s nothing. I haven’t even mentioned dear cousin
Then he looked up, and met John’s eyes. They were dark pools, blown wide, staring at him in the faint remnants of light in the room.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock paused. They were still staring at each other. He remembered when John had slept at the hospital and how desperately he wanted to look into his eyes to
Sherlock lowered his head for a moment. “I believe the circumstances will be enough for Mycroft to make sure neither of us will be prosecuted. Don’t worry, John,” he added, finding that his voice had softened automatically. “We did his job for him. All of us.” He looked at Mary again. “It won’t be an issue.”
“Oh has he? I doubt he’d see you as more than a liability at this point. A security risk. Who’s to say you weren’t working for Norbury this entire time? Use John to get to me, cash in the reward for the
Sherlock managed a tight smile as he remembered something. “You said you would always jump in front of a bullet for me.”
“I tried that. She’s not at her flat and called in sick at work.” Mycroft left no doubt that Mary was probably the picture of health. “I thought you might be spoon-feeding her chicken soup,” he added derisively. “Or are the two of you no longer a
“I’m afraid you’ve found me out,” the madman declared magnanimously, in full acting mode. “As you can see, there is a story here, and you’ll get the whole thing. But it’s already been a long day for us. Will you please let me and Dr Watson go inside first. I promise you, we’re merely taking a short break, and then I’ll be out of this door again, ready to answer all your questions.”
John gave the chart a cursory glance, his eyes darting to and fro. Finally, he sighed and handed it back to Sherlock. “Ah well, been there, done that,” he remarked drily. Sherlock felt a fond smile graze his cheek and he looked at John with a pang of sadness and respect.
John awoke with a start. A passing light by the motorway blinded him briefly before everything was plunged into darkness once again. He lifted his head and ran a hand down his neck, massaging the stiffness away. God, it was Christmas bloody Eve and he wished he was in a bed. However, if his choice was being in bed alone or being out on the chase with Sherlock, there really was never a question where he was going to be, was there?
I was too late with my protestations, unfortunately, for in that time Macnair had fully turned around in our booth, and called for the man Holmes was talking with, Abbott.
“But you must, my dear boy, or you will be of no use to me tomorrow, and more than ever I need you by my side in this matter. It is of utmost importance.” Holmes turned to me as he spoke, his eyes gentler than I had seen them, and somehow he guided me to stand from my chair and raised a hand when I tried to speak. “I myself will not be sleeping tonight, that is a given, so you may take my room and my bed, Watson.”
I smiled back at him a little dumbly, I will confess, before tucking into my now cold breakfast. When I had finished I maneuvered my way closer to his side and sat back down in the chair usually occupied by a client, knowing that extended time sitting on the floor coupled with the rain would aggravate my old leg wound.
I closed his eyelids shut before stepping back. His blood was still on my hands and in my shirt cuffs, and I took a deep breath before turning around to face the rest of the room.
He gasped at me, and I laughed once more which made him color slightly. His reaction as to my wording essentially confirmed it, and was endearingly sweet in a way that I would never have predicted of him, and I relished seeing this new version of him. I tightened my grip on the hand I held in between my own. It would be quite some time before I could bear to let go.
I raised my hand to trace his sharp jaw and brushed a thumb along his high cheekbone where an impossible tear had fallen, and smiled. “Love is an inherently positive emotion, and if anything, my dear, the warm memories of it sustained me in the three long years of your absence, and it has rejuvenated me beyond belief in your revival. I had no hope that my love would be returned and therefore no despair, so to hear that it is after all requited brings me nothing but joy.”
We operated in this fashion for quite some time, me writing down his amendments and the room silent besides, when there was a knock at the door followed by the entry of Mrs. Hudson.
Holmes was quick to the doorway. “That must be Lestrade.” he said, but still gestured to his pocket, and I understood his signal and grabbed my revolver from my desk before I followed him down the stairs. If our killer was bold enough to enter through our front door once, what would stop him from making another attempt?
He shook his head. “I did not even suspect - I thought I was alone in my affections, and as such employed my best efforts to disguise them.” He lowered himself to bend on one knee before me, so I was now looking down on him and our joined hands atop my knees. “But for years now I have identified it as such. I love you.”
“This is precisely what I had hoped to avoid, dear boy!” He said, stepping closer to me and taking the card back. “I had not wished to alarm you, especially when the facts are not yet clear.”
I was confused at his sudden change in tone, but followed him regardless, just barely remembering to grab my favored bowler hat on the way out. By the time I had caught up with him he was in the street, having called a cab. It was not a far walk, and I enjoyed walking at any rate especially in the temperate if cloudy weather we were having, but it was still February and there was a chill in the air that aggravated my old injury, as I was sure that Holmes had taken note of.
John thought he saw Mycroft give him a look, yet this time it was something that approximated a smile. He decided he must have imagined it.
John swallowed against the lump in his throat. He was thinking of all the other near-misses that usually followed Sherlock’s recklessness. The man texted a serial killer on the day they met, after all. And then of course, he texted Moriarty and met him on that roof. The thought had been at the back of John’s mind all day. It was that nagging feeling that Sherlock might be enjoying all of this again; that he might throw caution out and be tempted back into this game by Moriarty’s right hand man.
John was still trying to catalogue if he’d injured anything when he was heaved to his feet unceremoniously. Moran pushed him forward and then darted after Mary, into the garden. Norbury took him by the collar and nodded at Sherlock to walk in front of her. There was no more sneering or gloating. They were pushed through the house as quickly as possible, and any resistance John might have thought about was snuffed out when he felt the barrel of Norbury’s gun dig into the small of his back.
Sherlock looked at him with stormy features. “Don’t psychoanalyze me, Lestrade. Others have tried and failed.” He pushed himself out of the plastic chair and turned his back. “Thank you for your insight into the matter, it is noted,” he said coldly. He turned a little. “The distraction,” he nodded to the case file, “was also welcome, but now I am tired and you should leave.”
“We’re not really, I mean... We used to text fairly regularly, I guess,” John said slowly. Sherlock’s narrowed eyes immediately took in his discomfort. This was not going to be easy. He avoided Sherlock’s eyes for the moment.
“It’s okay,” John began, trying to help, but Sherlock brushed him off with a clipped, “I’m sorry, too. This is not… easy. So. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
He heard the footsteps coming closer. Moran was being quiet, but a man built like him had a hard time sneaking over frozen leaves and underbrush. John controlled his breathing.
He looked over his shoulder to make out the vague form of Moran gaining on them, but then John reached the trees and was flinging himself between them. Then there was the sound of boots on frozen grass, finding purchase, stopping, and
Sherlock gave him a rueful smile. “I’m sure Moriarty will find a way to continue our game. But for now, I will leave him in my brother’s care.”
“Yes, very enlightening, Sherlock,” he groused. “Now could you two please keep the charming banter to a minimum, I am trying not to kill myself over here.”
Sherlock shrugged and grinned at the familiar joke. They managed to manhandle Greg into the back of the cab.  As Sherlock closed the door, the cabbie realized the two of them didn’t plan on coming along and he leaned out of the window. “Oi! What am I supposed to do with this one, then?”
get up. John found it endearing and endlessly amusing – it was these little unique things that made life at Baker Street so delightfully out of the ordinary. Sherlock's face softened in a way John had slowly come to recognize was only for him. He smiled back happily as Sherlock wordlessly handed him a cup. It was such a domestic scene, he wondered how either of them would have reacted a few months ago if anyone had told them this would happen.
“So, your brother took this one over virtually minutes after we discovered the body,” Lestrade explained, still not moving an inch. “He made sure there was only limited staff here. Bloody annoying, but mostly for your benefit, so don’t ruin it,” he said with a glare at Sherlock. “I’ve filled them in that you’re alive, but seeing as this is now a classified investigation, it’s not like they could blab anyway.”
“It is,” another voice startled them from the darkness. Sherlock turned quickly to look at the shadowy corner behind the door.
True, he was still snappy and to the point, but he didn’t put on an act nor did he actively gallop all over the poor widow’s feelings just because it would speed things up. John was in a constant state of apprehension about his behaviour, so much so that he was easily the most worried person in the room. Mrs Blanchard, by contrast, was a woman of enormous composure; she was in her early fifties and carried herself with dignity that spoke volumes about
“Hopefully tonight will differ in its level of excitement,” Holmes said, straightening and his eyes taking on a familiar gleam, the thought of peril restoring him. “Now here is where we part for the afternoon, dear fellow, for you to further build our puzzle and for me to keep our prey entertained.”
“That may be so,” I said cautiously, “but you forget that other people are allowed to act outside of you, Holmes, whether you would like them to or not. Even if you are in possession of their trust and loyalty, they should not be a burden to you.”
He went on as if he had just not made a statement capable of stopping my breathing completely. “And that is obvious to anyone who wishes to bring about my downfall! You are therefore the natural target as the closest person I have in this world, and of course that means I must take extra measures when necessary to safeguard you against the repercussions of my indulgence of our friendship. I only regret…”
The both of them then came to join us, and I locked eyes with Holmes the second he spotted me. Resisting the urge to fold my tail between my legs I met his gaze head on, challenging him to react to my following him even as his eyes narrowed at me. He had to maintain character, and yet I knew that whatever happened now I would never be hearing the end of it later.
I made myself chuckle. “I believe so, he did not give me all the details, and claimed it was a solitary mission.”
It was rather a role reversal in a certain way, for him to be in the position I so often had assumed, my service revolver ready in protecting him from threat and keeping watch as we waited in some dark niche for some plan of his to come to fruition. And yet now it was him keeping watch for me.
I decided to jump into the deep end. “Sometimes, I will confess, I have been made to feel as if I am a burden to you, Holmes, and that that is why you do not trust me to bring me into your fold during investigations.”
“Yes, and it is these letters that she then wrapped up into her skirts and brought to me today, so that I may judge what is to become of her life.”
I have never been dismissed in this way, while in the middle of a case no less, and especially one that took place within our own sitting room. Therefore I balked at the suggestion. “Of course not, Holmes! Why would I leave now!”
I busied myself with the removal of my coat and hat to give myself time to answer. “Something like that I suppose, although it really isn’t like that exactly - he isn’t my fella, that is.”
It is then that Holmes kissed me, a simple answer to the question we had both been asking of each other since the beginning.
The book was one I recognized as not my own, but of belonging to my late wife. After her untimely passing I had not been able to keep her things within sight out of grief, similar to how I had once avoided Baker Street, and as such much of her things had been moved to storage for safekeeping or to those of her remaining relatives and friends. The book Holmes had in front of him was one of the few keepsakes I kept with me, so as to never fully forget her place in my heart.
“His loyalties ran deep it seems, and he had decided to throw his lot in with your plight from the moment we told it to him.”
“Goodnight, Watson. Do try not to dwell.” My friend said, before he shut the door to the sitting room behind me.
” and then attended a concert at Royal Albert Hall that provided Holmes with both enjoyment and excellent material upon which to lecture me on the cab drive to Baker Street. This in turn brought me enjoyment, as to see Holmes in this element, with his top hat and his tails and debonair air, smiling at me triumphantly upon our front stoop, was a treat worthy of any fancy meal or music.
“Exactly.” said Holmes, finishing, not seeming to notice the tone of jest in my twee statement. It all at once filled me with such affection for the man that I abandoned my manuscript to get into bed beside him. I dislodged him slightly in the process, and he grumbled but otherwise simply allowed me to wrap my arms around him, and kiss his forehead.
I was more adept with my feet than I would have been had this been real. Holmes allowed me to lead at first, but I could tell that as it went on he was growing characteristically impatient, and we soon switched positions. The music slowly grew quicker, more akin to the Viennese style, but we moved regardless as if one body around the room, as if our feet need not even touch the floor. His face was close to mine in a way it had only been when we were forced into close chambers on some watch or another, or when he needed to whisper, and I did not dare to breathe for risking breaking the quiet and content tension between us just then.
This retelling concerns the incidents that took place within the early months of 1895, in what would prove to be a memorable year indeed, not the least because of the revelations brought about by the particular problem that found itself within our very own rooms one chilly February evening. Holmes had been returned to me and the world for close to a year when events unfolded that would further change our regard for each other, beginning first with the arrival of a threatening message.
“Oh!” In my haste, I had not noticed, and I flushed darkly as I pictured how Lestrade had just seen me exit Holmes’ bedroom in only my nightgown and housecoat, and the implications that arose from that. “Quite right.”
He continued his previous statement, unwavered by my gaze, sipping his drink. “The true blame in this matter falls solely at the feet of Macnair, for his jealousy and misguided attempts at vengeance leading to murder.”
(At the time of course, we knew little of how quickly the tide was turning, especially in regards to the matter between Oscar Wilde and the Marquess of Queensberry, and yet the sentiment behind my insistence was rooted in the same fear that would put us on edge when those events did play out mere months later. The question of his being recognized was a very real threat that could very well bring about his ruin, and my talk of his reputation was as much about his personal well-being as his precious career.)
It has always been somewhat of a treat for me to see Holmes remove his artful disguises, and this time was no different as I watched him remove those wretched sideburns and begin wiping his face free of the makeup that dramatized his features, becoming with each move more like the man I knew.
“Never.” I confirmed to this, and the idea that he was alone, so that he may hear again that he was always loved.
“Excellent.” Holmes clapped his hands together, standing to begin pacing. “Now, here is the sequence of events as I have devised them.
“Amazing.” I could not help but tell him, and though his eyes remained closed as he slumped once more, his lip quirked as it always did at my praise. “But if they were written so long ago, why hold onto them? Especially if he has a new lover now, in the form of Miss Finnegan?”
I swallowed, and steeled myself to stand tall. “I do not. He did not exaggerate; I was emotionally distraught over losing one that I had-” here however I faltered, and softened the words by repeating his own, “that I had such high regard for.”
For the next few actions happened simultaneously, and even in the aftermath took some time to unravel. Lestrade, escaping notice in the tension of the situation, had come up the stairs and had just pushed open the door, disturbing the horrified quiet; I darted forward, his looking at me releasing me from my weakness, to push Holmes away in time, surprising him and dislodging the bottle to spill onto his lap; and finally Abbott, to all our surprise, had grabbed Macnair’s gun off of the settee next to him and fired right into the man’s chest, just as he had taken a sip of the fatal whiskey.
“In the story that the term originated from, the men use a loaded pistol that is passed around on turns, to test the theory of predestination and their own courage. We may use your arsenic that you have so kindly provided instead, and reduce the mess my poor landlady will be tasked with afterward. Arsenic is not always deadly, although swift, and survival is a matter of dosage. Whoever does in fact win out is treated to a new lease on life, and the prize.”
Whether it be the relief at his statement or the aftermath of having revealed so much, tears rose in my eyes at his acceptance, and they would have been shed had I not known how uncomfortable it would make my friend. Worry I did not know I had collected in my joints dissipated, and I felt a large relief. I was grateful, and I hoped I could convey the enormity of my gratitude in those simple two words, “Thank you.”
I wished to argue, but the surety in his tone and the quicksilver smile he slipped me prodded my curiosity, as was his intent. “Have you now?”
Holmes seemed amused, so I did not feel too alarmed, but I knew my ears were still burning red as I rushed to my bedroom to change.
“Well,” Lestrade said after a moment. He had eyes, of course. He’d seen the two of them together on crime scenes. He’d heard the occasional rumour. This was dangerous territory.
“Plenty of space,” Sherlock muttered absent-mindedly, gesturing to the bed, but John could see a slight pink tinge to his cheeks.
And Sherlock, so determined never to let feelings interfere, had gotten attached right back. Suddenly, all of the small, unimportant moments of the last few weeks just came together, one after the other, into a big, inevitable puzzle. Sherlock wasn’t quite sure what the final picture would be yet, but he’d seen glimpses of it. But there was John, who had gone from merely tolerating him to kissing him to making him wild with his
Lestrade laughed and held up his phone. “Don’t worry, these are gift enough for me. Come on, first round’s on me.”
Greg looked at him, once again trying to decide if the man with the posh accent was being sarcastic or not. “Huh,” he said.
– anything. She said she didn’t know the guy from their assault and he had bought it, hook, line and sinker. So had Mycroft.
When they reached the stairs, he took the first step, but Sherlock didn’t immediately follow. John turned around to tug him onwards, and was startled to find Sherlock a lot closer than he’d thought. John’s arms shot forward and held on to his shoulders immediately to top him from overbalancing again. His ridiculously tall friend was standing right next to the first step, now suddenly on eye level with him. It certainly gave things a new perspective, John thought as warmth bloomed in his cheeks.
John let Sherlock take the lead, looking at everything with wide eyes. Sherlock had to smile; he never particularly noticed how posh his upbringing had been or in what kind of circles he and his brother moved with such ease. Sometimes it helped to see things through John’s eyes to bring them into perspective.
. His eyes mentally travelling down John’s body under the covers sent certain images from his dreams back through his synapses and he needed to get out of there, absolutely,
“Our client’s girlfriend disappeared; I suspect she’s involved in a series of robberies Lestrade hasn’t managed to solve so far, so…” he gave John a non-committal shrug. “Thought it might be interesting.” His voice belied absolutely no interest in anything whatsoever. John frowned a little. This didn’t sound at all like Sherlock when he was on a case.
“Hey,” he said kindly, rubbing her arms a little. “Come on. What would he say if he saw us two sentimental sobs, eh?” He noticed a faint tremor in his own voice now.
“P-posh git,” her voice broke off as she dragged in another pained breath, and John let out a watery chuckle. He briefly rested his forehead against hers and smoothed back her hair. “He is, isn’t he?”
The thought of certain images involving a certain pair of lips, surrounded by pale skin and soft dark curls under his hands made his face flush and he quickly got up. He grabbed their empty glasses and offered to get another round, feeling Sherlock’s knowing smirk on his back all the way to the bar.
They went for a short walk later, John asking a few rudimentary questions about the case. Soon, however, they ended up amusing themselves with trying to spot who was ‘real’ and who was an employee of Mycroft’s. Sherlock, naturally, had a proper scoring system with logically applied points to discuss. John used his newly developed observation skills with at least some success, increasing his already spirited mood.
Finally he heard something land in the water and the cries from above directed him to a large life ring bobbing on the waves near him. With a last big struggle, he launched himself at the ring, keeping John above the water as much as possible. He entangled his arms through the ring and kept a firm grip on John. He shouted, “quickly! He’s drowning! Hurry!” Thankfully the people at the top were not entirely morons and pulled them up. Sherlock heard grunting and more shouting from Lestrade who was in front, holding and pulling the rope and swearing fiercely at the people behind him to
“Well.” Sherlock swallowed. Mycroft made a further mental note that the long isolation had evidently softened, if not cracked, his brother’s usually so immaculate façade of detachment. He produced a half-hearted smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “That’s good isn’t it? Why are you worried?”
at them and the flirting that came so naturally to him. He thought of how all of them seemed casual and inconsequential when compared to how John had looked at him the previous night. To how John was looking at him right now.
Sherlock frowned and stopped. He had not apologized to her for his jealousy, nor did Mary seem like she expected that sort of thing. Perhaps it was really settled, then. Except…
“He helped,” Sherlock merely said, and John thought he looked a bit miffed that his own substantial intellect, which no doubt had contributed a lot to whatever crazy plan they had pulled, was so belittled. John dangled his legs over the side of the bed and tried to determine whether he was still feeling dizzy.
of our dear Detective Inspector over there.” She nodded at Lestrade, who was laughing at something John said.
It did. Images of John on their first day together flitted through Sherlock’s mind. He had them all neatly catalogued and stored away; in the months he was gone he had to force himself not to dwell on them too much, lest he lose his focus.
Lestrade ended up sitting with them much more than he did with his squads. After another pint or so, John called him out on it, pointing out that if he sat there any longer, he’d join the “weirdo” club.
He had been sure that something was going on with him; and he had finally spent some time last night going over everything that had accumulated in his mind palace. John’s grief. John’s heartfelt confessions about his death. John’s nightmares. John keeping his memory alive. John blushing. John smiling at him. John crying.
Afraid to break the spell if he moved too quickly, he plucked one of Sherlock’s hands from his hip and interlaced their fingers. He drew his face back, missing the contact already. Sherlock opened his eyes, frowning a little, his pupils blown wide in the semi-darkness. John smiled and nudged their noses together one more time. “
John fiddled with his crutch as they waited for the elevator. After a moment, he added, “and that was good?”
“I—wasn’t sure at the time,” Sherlock admitted slowly, and John couldn’t help it, his eyes widened in surprise. “This is all a bit new,” he added, smiling wryly. For once, he really looked insecure. “But I thought about it some more since then.”
The rain continued to drum against the windows. The fire popped. Sherlock thought for a moment, then cleared his throat again. “Um. Are you hungry? I was going to order some take out.”
Sherlock was silent, processing this. Mycroft, likely as not, somehow knew the whole story. He certainly knew about him and John. So perhaps, just this once…
. But as soon as he’d approached Sherlock in the shed, the infuriating man had bolted. At this point, frantic longing and frustration were warring in John’s chest for dominance.
“Well go on then,” John gestured to Mycroft, who was still regarding Sherlock with a thoughtful look. “Arrest her, or whatever it is you do here when you don’t just abduct people.”
Another pause, and Abby chose this moment to whine again. John rubbed her ear again, nodding, as if to say,
. I shouldn’t— I—that was a bit much all at once, I’m sorry, Sherlock.” He pressed a hand against his mouth as if he could make his offending lips disappear.
about it! It had never crossed Sherlock’s mind that anyone could feel so attached to him; moreover he had never thought he’d meet someone as fundamentally crazy as he was. The only difference was, thought Sherlock, was that John was polite and better at hiding it. Also, somehow, John tolerated him.
However, something tugged at his chest at that thought. He glanced down at his sleeping friend. It was very comfortable and familiar, sleeping next to him. The feeling of breath breezing gently through his hair, John’s smell, the rising and falling of his chest... that felt nice. He’d always observed other couples and assumed that having to be so close to someone else would be tedious in the extreme. Annoying, restricting, like being tied to a leash. But right now, he felt only lightness and a strange sensation of pleasure worth indulging in. Sherlock usually indulged if he found something he liked. And he did like John Watson.
“He can’t touch you Helen,” Sherlock said. “Whatever he told you, it’s not true. We can protect you.”
“Yes, I can relate,” he said, pointedly not bothering to soften his blunt tone. Sherlock glanced down and then quickly away again. But probably long enough to imagine the scene John had caused at Mycroft’s bloody club of silence a few days after the funeral. There had been a lot of resentment to go around.
John chuckled and snuggled a little closer, waiting for the new day to slowly wake up the world around them.
“Of course it isn’t,” Mycroft said coolly. “This is one of the calls I usually avoid at all costs.” He pressed a speed dial button. The phone faintly began ringing in the silence.
Sherlock felt his lips tighten at this. What she considered thrilling had been a low point for him. Mycroft was still mad at him and would probably lord his failure with
Sherlock didn’t seem to mind, in fact, he actually leaned in a little. John felt his voice vibrate through his torso every time he spoke. It made him feel warm and comfortable. Everything felt simply… lovely. He couldn’t recall why he’d been so gloomy all day. All that
“Christ. Don’t have to tell me twice,” he mumbled and made his way to the door. Sherlock thought he could make out ‘
"Yes, yes, don't fuss. I'll stay to explain the situation and confirm your story and then I'll leave you and Dr Watson to get...
an advantage, Sherlock. Neither is your pig-headedness. That doesn't mean they're just going to go away if you ignore them long enough. If it were that easy you would be a much more pleasant man to be around."
There were some five or six people moving boxes. One woman stood out; she was by the side, coordinating everything. Margaret, no doubt. Sherlock and John used the cover of darkness to make their way to the boat and clambered over the side. As Sherlock had predicted, it wasn’t a cargo ship at all, but one of the city cruisers for tourists. They weren’t sure at this point whether Margaret had bought up a tourist company of some kind previously or if it was simply stolen, but it amounted to Sherlock hitting the nail on the head, as usual. They were pressed against the side of the ship on a small ledge next to the row of sightseeing windows and John grinned over to his friend. “You were right,” he mouthed.
, Sherlock thought. He pressed his lips together in determination. And decided to stop agonizing about their relationship for now. First, he had to get his John back.
John was surprised. He felt reminded of the conversation about ‘that nurse’ who had also been ‘all over him’. However, that memory led him in the complete opposite direction of where he wanted this conversation to go, so he bit his tongue from letting slip a remark in the vein of ‘are we jealous of dogs now?’. It wouldn’t do to start this kind of banter all over again; it would only make Sherlock uncomfortable. He allowed himself a chuckle and looked out of the other window. A small voice in the back of his mind said,
” and he could hear the smile in his voice. He slowly felt his eyelids droop, Sherlock’s steady breath on his forehead and the flutter of lips against his skin, the soft noises of their combined breathing lulled him to sleep. He let himself nestle a little closer still, burying his face against Sherlock’s neck as he drifted off.
