He and Iron Man aren't holding hands, of course, because no one knows about them except the Avengers. Well, the Avengers and Mr. Stark.
He left Tony standing at the foot of the bed, went to the dresser, and dug an old plain gray t-shirt and a pair of plaid fleece pajama pants out of the drawer. The shirt would be a little big on Tony, but that wasn't the end of the world. The pants would probably fit; they had enough give in the elastic. Tony wasn't all that much smaller than he was.
"I'm the one thanking you," Tony says, and his eyes slide shut as Steve gently starts to work at a spot just under Tony's shoulder blade, one of those places no one can really reach by themselves. "Oh. Mmm. Yeah, right there."
He set the plug down on the bed next to everything else. He was going to be responsible. That would be over the line. He was going to behave in a professional and appropriate manner, because that was the right thing to do. Despite what the rest of the world might think about Tony Stark, infamous playboy, he didn't actually take orders from his dick.
Steve lifts his head and puts his hands behind his back, settling into a familiar parade rest as Tony turns and walks away. If Steve were an ordinary visitor, the next several minutes wouldn't be happening at all.
"You are officially my favorite person I've ever dated," Tony murmured. He was enraptured now, lost in imagination, already planning it out. "Oh, we get to make you a
"Aww, no, Shellhead." Steve said, softly. "Nothing's ruined. I'm sure we can get the mood back if you want."
"Oh, yeah," Tony murmured, his voice gone husky, his breathing ragged. "Oh, yeah, like that, just like that, oh, your
"Your hands are so warm," Tony says, in wonder. "I mean, I knew you ran warm, but I didn't realize it would feel so much better than anyone else." He hums a note of contentment. "That's lovely."
Tony winces. Of course he winces. Steve's angry at him, and Steve already knew he couldn't take that. He still can't.
So Tony had to reason this out from the other direction. He knew who resided in the mansion, and he knew it wasn't his own gear, even though the Avengers always kept a room open for him. Six people on the team plus Jarvis meant there were seven people living in the mansion.
. "I thought for sure I must have missed you. Haven't seen you in a couple days. Late breakfast for you, huh?"
As Mr. Stark leans on the workbench for balance, he stumbles backwards and around the edge of the table, back to his stool, and he sits down hard. He leans to one side, and Steve hears a drawer rattle. A few seconds later, Mr. Stark is fumbling with a bottle of pills, his hands shaking.
He reaches out and runs his fingers through Tony's sweat-dampened curls, fitting his palm against the curve of Tony's skull. Tony presses his head against Steve's hand, then shudders and shakes, a full-body shiver sliding down his spine. Steve watches, pleased, as Tony trembles against the ropes, pushes, fights -- then relaxes into the embrace of the harness, smiling up at him again.
Tony hadn't replied to Steve's text at all, he hadn't replied to Steve's email this morning about the brunch reservation, and he hadn't actually made it back to the mansion last night. But Steve wasn't concerned. Sometimes Tony got busy with work and forgot to come up for air. That was just how he was. And besides, it wasn't like Steve didn't know exactly where Tony was. He'd pinged Tony's identicard. Last night, Tony had gone back to Stark Tower, up to his suite, and he'd been up there all night. He was still up there.
For a few seconds, Iron Man doesn't say anything. Steve can measure the time by the beats of his anxious heart. He wonders if Iron Man can read his heart rate by looking at him.
There was a sigh from Tony's direction, and then the whispering of fabric. Steve wondered what Tony was upset about now, and if it was something new. Probably not. He hoped not. Tony had enough to be upset about.
"It's artificial." Tony's voice was calm. "Cybernetic, actually. So it's not entirely synthetic; there's some organic tissue in there, along with the mechanical parts. It kind of... fused with what was left of my original heart. The scars are from the, uh. The implantation." Steve didn't want to think about what it meant that Tony hadn't described the process as
Iron Man hums softly. "I was kind of hoping you would." The words are a soft, wistful admission. "I mean, if you'd like to cuddle and watch a movie, we could do that, I was thinking. It's why I brought the popcorn. And a screen." He jerks his head toward a computer monitor atop the nearest workbench. Steve hadn't noticed it before.
This wasn't anything like the fantasies, actually. The fantasies -- these ones, anyway -- were lurid, pornographic, nothing but throaty moans and slick sounds, a warmth and pressure Steve could almost pretend wasn't his own hand. He hadn't imagined this. He hadn't imagined the sight of Tony's hand, running over the inner seam of his pants, a caress that was soft and reassuring at the same time as it made his blood heat. He hadn't imagined the way Tony's fingers lingered as he eased his belt undone. He hadn't imagined Tony's face in profile, staring down at him, smiling in joy and utter fascination. He hadn't imagined Tony
He gives Steve a small, hopeful smile, and Steve knows that that's the real him. This isn't an act. Mr. Stark really does want to go out with him.
Steve suspected most of the Avengers were going to have the same reaction. They were going to be happy for them. He just knew it.
But Tony was still talking. "I guess he thought that was too simple. So then he tried telling me, uh." Tony's face was somehow even redder. "Nice things. Compliments. As you. Everything I could have wanted you to tell me. Kept it up for a while. Until I believed it was you. And then after he did that, he had you tell me everything was a lie, and that I was so stupid for believing any of it was real. Then he walked in as himself and told me I should have realized it was a dream because you'd never tell me you-- you'd never say anything like that." Tony halfheartedly wiped his face with the back of his hand and tried to smile. "That was-- that was pretty rough, actually."
The woman startles. Her eyes dart over to Tony; she's obviously hoping that he'll explain. But Tony doesn't.
"I hate the thought of you dying of hypothermia much more than I hate the cold," Steve tells him. "Also, you know, holding you in my arms is definitely not a hardship."
He wished that, just once, Tony would stop hating himself. But he knew that that was a nearly-impossible thing to ask for, right now. Or ever. "None of that makes you a disappointment. Or stupid," he added. "And maybe I couldn't ever have imagined this when I met you, but I mean that in a good way. You're amazing. I'm lucky to know you. And whatever you need, I'm happy to give. I'm sure you'd do the same for me. I don't keep scores in friendship."
It was going to be all right. Steve couldn't possibly hate the truth that much, could he? It was going to be just fine. He had a good feeling about this.
"Technically," Tony begins, with an exquisitely-precise tone that Steve has heard out of Iron Man's mouth during countless Avengers meetings, "you didn't give me a heart attack. Stress cardiomyopathy is actually an entirely different phenomenon that happens to present with similar symptoms--"
, Steve can accept that; it's not like he only wants Iron Man for his body, after all. But it would be nice to know. Maybe they'll talk about that, tonight.
Tony offers him another smile -- still faint, but this time it's real. "Oh, probably, darling. But I asked Greg why you weren't there and Greg said you were tied up in here because you were still a vampire, and I said I needed to see you, and Greg said that wasn't a good idea, and I told him to go fuck himself, and then I got out of bed." He snorts. "Brothers, huh?"
There was an obvious problem with this entire bizarre plan, and Fury hadn't mentioned it, so Tony supposed that meant he had to. "Steve's not even
out of the papers, thank God. But I'm not free of it. I'm never free of it." His mouth was a sad, wobbling line. "My car's not exactly inconspicuous. Neither is the armor. But I've been here before, and recently. And so has Iron Man. Until the story about Ty breaks, I don't think they'll have much more to say about that. But if I show up at your place in Brooklyn, that makes me
. Theaters in his days used to have columns, balconies, painted murals, an organist to play during intermission. Sure, maybe Steve never had enough money for the really nice theaters, the ones that were velvet all over with gilded trim. He was lucky if he had a nickel for the double feature. But even at the kinds of places Steve went to, you used to dress up. You made an occasion of it, because there wasn't much else to do.
Steve's mouth had fallen open again. He hadn't known. He had no idea Tony had looked at him, had seen him, had known this.
"You're going to laugh at me," Tony said, mouth twisting, "but, I swear, sometimes I with my millions of dollars like to buy Ivory soap because it-- it reminds me of you." Now Tony was the one whose face was flushed.
Tony half-smiled. "It's fine. It's definitely not the worst thing that's happened to me in the last-- how long have I been here?"
"I'm glad I could make you happy," Steve tells him. "I'm glad I stayed. I'd do it again. And, like I said, it's enough. It really is. I don't need more."
Even now, Tony seemed determined to go slow. Tony kissed him, slow and lingering, a kiss much sweeter than Steve had expected from someone who was offering to blow him. But then, Tony was very obviously extremely in love. He just hadn't said so. But it was clear with every word, every gesture. If Tony didn't want to say it back, that was okay. Steve could wait. It had been a hell of a day.
Relief flooded Tony's face. "Oh, thank God. I thought for a minute you broke your back. Okay. Whew. You should see the goose egg on your head, though, Jesus. Speaking of--" he waved his other hand in Steve's field of vision. "You want to tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?"
"--the hottest thing I have heard in my entire life," Tony said. He was smiling even more broadly. "Talk about flattering. That's amazing. Look at you," he said, still smiling. "You're gorgeous."
"Do it," Tony says, desperately. He's clinging to the phone like a lifeline. He thinks he might cry or have another heart attack. "Do it, do it now, Christ, Stephen, what are you waiting for--"
Tony was still wearing the helmet, and it was probably better if he kept it on until they got inside. Tony now had his thumb hooked casually inside one of the shield's straps. Steve tried not to think about what the sight of Tony posing with his shield was doing to him.
"Oh, would you?" Tony asked, sounding hopeful. "That'd be really good of you." Tony was smiling now. "Of course, of course. I love you too." Tony smiled once again, and Steve tried valiantly to ignore the now-familiar stab of jealousy. "Tonight, yeah. Looking forward to it. Bye."
Steve's phone rang. Jan must have been right there waiting for his message. Geez. She was probably very, very upset, then. He flipped the phone open and pressed it to his ear as the call connected.
This was probably not something he should have said, he realized, dimly, but his brain didn't seem to be making any of the decisions for him right now.
No, he didn't know. "You'd have known something, all right," Steve said, confused and a little angry, because, God, he'd wanted to be good enough for Tony, he'd wanted to show him he'd liked it, he'd wanted to show Tony he was much better at this whole gay sex thing than he'd thought he was, and apparently Steve hadn't even done that right because Tony somehow hadn't been convinced of his sincerity. "You'd have known I was an
"It's hard to explain exactly what it's like to be an Avenger," Steve continued. "It's not like any other job that exists. But it's a job that requires trust. Immense amounts of trust. More than you can imagine. You're part of a team. For ten years, I've put my life in Iron Man's hands every day, just as he's put his life in my hands." He couldn't not smile, just a little, thinking about Tony. "And I think if you asked him, he'd probably be the first one to tell you that I don't shy away from criticizing him if I believe he deserves it, and he'd probably also say the same thing about him criticizing me. I won't deny that we've had our disagreements." He didn't quite manage to stop the grimace; he could feel his mouth go flat. "Your own program has done a very thorough job of compiling the decisions of his that we've disagreed on, in fact. But none of that means I don't trust him. Because I do. And I realize that this may be difficult to understand, but it's the truth. And if Iron Man says he's innocent, then I believe him."
Well, now Steve knows for sure that Tony, lover of all things King Arthur, was the one who made that account. It's real. Tony isn't trying to deceive Ghost. Steve doesn't think he can. Oh, God, Tony.
Steve was unfastening a belt pouch and fishing out a roll of something white that Tony couldn't quite see and-- oh. Gauze. That was gauze.
"Maybe I don't want to be your friend," Tony said, low and quiet and harsh, which upon reflection was probably one of the least explicable things he'd ever said to Steve, but he didn't really have time to think about it because by then he'd hooked one hand into the neck of Steve's uniform and wrapped the other hand around the back of Steve's head, and he was kissing him.
"Oh!" Tony said, brightly, earnestly, turning to Steve. "Everything's okay now. Ty explained it all to me. It makes perfect sense, you see. I just didn't get it before."
When Steve stands up and turns around, he's more than a little surprised to find that Tony is standing. Tony's arms are outstretched and his feet planted wide on the floor, like he's not balancing right. The faceplate is still pushed up, and that means Steve can see the faint, but pleased smile with which Tony is regarding himself very well.
Steve was vaguely aware that there was probably something he ought to have objected to about Tony's lack of limits -- not that he would have wanted to do anything Tony wasn't going to like -- but that vague awareness was rapidly consumed by the realization that he was here, with Tony, and Tony wanted him to touch him and it was-- well, Steve could see why Tony had talked about all his dreams coming true.
Jesus, if Steve had been going to panic over the fear that Tony was coming onto him, wouldn't he have panicked at some point during the hour or so that Tony had spent desperately holding him?
"Fear not!" Thor says, as always a touch too loud on the comms. "We shall vanquish these foes in thy stead, Iron Man!"
"Steve?" Tony croaked. "What-- why-- how-- what are you doing here?" His voice was slurred. He barely sounded like himself.
"Not like that," Tony clarifies. "I want this. I want you. I want you so much. I just-- I want you to keep the rest of it on. Please."
He'd tried. He'd tried not to think about Tony. He'd tried to distract himself. It hadn't worked. He'd thought it had, for the past couple days, but it was just that he hadn't seen Tony. All the feelings were still there. He'd forgotten, somehow, how much he felt for him. In Tony's absence, he'd convinced himself that his longing was less anguished, his pain less acute, his passion less sharp. And now he was here and Tony was here and it all just came roaring back.
Of course, if this was all a setup, which it probably was, Tiberius was going to be perfectly fine. But Tony didn't know that.
"Maybe," Steve murmurs, and his voice has a low, dark note in it, and he thinks he's still from the forties and he's straight, isn't he, isn't he straight, and he can't be
Does Tony honestly think he's going to let him freeze to death? Does Tony really think so little of him?
Somehow Steve went even paler; his eyes went hollow and dark. "Shellhead, no," he said, softly, and Tony's poor overtaxed heart skipped a beat before he figured out why Steve was saying no to him. "We're not doing this, okay? Not like this. You're going to be all right. You're going to make it. I promise."
"I'm gonna do a lot of things to you now," Steve returned, which was really quite a remarkable statement to make in the middle of Nick Fury's office, and ten seconds after that Tony realized he didn't much care what Fury thought of that, because Steve was kissing him,
It's not the most thrilling conversation, but he thinks Tony just needs to hear him saying anything. Tony's underthings are actually fairly exciting -- well, some of them, anyway -- because sometimes he likes to make himself pretty, adorning himself in little delicate scraps of lace. But now really isn't the time for that, unfortunately.
"I love you," Steve gasps. "I love you so much, Tony, you're so good at that, you're perfect, oh, I'm going to--"
"Seriously, though," Steve added. "The more emotional version of that answer, I suppose, is that you can trust me because you know me. Not just because I'm your friend, but because you know what my reputation is, and you know I've earned it. You know how I try to treat people. You know that a whole lot of my daily life consists of me being honest, straightforward, and trustworthy, both in public and in private. There actually aren't a lot of surprises. Which I know you know." He knew people called him boring. Sometimes he resented it. But right now he'd much rather be boring than... whatever the hell Tiberius was. "I believe in the truth. Which is not a claim you can make about just anyone, as I think you know. And to the best of my knowledge -- which hopefully agrees with your knowledge -- I've never led you or anyone else astray."
He waits for Steve to turn away, to condemn him, to walk out and take his chances in the future with someone safer, someone better, someone who hasn't become a monster.
Iron Man's mouth is soft and warm against his. A mustache -- Iron Man has a mustache? -- brushes ever so lightly across Steve's skin. It doesn't scratch, it doesn't even tickle, but the barely-there pressure leaves Steve wanting
She patted his arm again, and her eyes gleamed. Steve was very familiar with that look. Jan was up to something. "So," Jan said, drawing out the word, "while I've got you here, I actually had a couple of suggestions for the team meeting agenda next week--"
"It's not the super-soldier serum," Tony says, and Steve's head snaps up in surprise. "Well, it is and it isn't. But you're actually only missing about a decade. I'm sorry. I know that's probably not much of a comfort."
cruel, saying them; he just sounds... sad? He's staring off into the middle distance, eyes unfocused, mouth tight with pain, like he thinks he's somehow in the middle of an entirely different conversation, a conversation that's much more distressing than this one should be.
me, you know?" He laughed. "And it turned out that had all been a lie, too. So no one liked me, I guess."
"Yes, of course I still have it," he said, confused, uncomprehending. "And you're always welcome there," he added, both because it was true and because it sounded like the sort of thing Tony needed to hear right now.
Ten seconds later, Steve pinpointed the other thing that had been making his skin crawl: there were no pictures. There were no photographs of friends, family, or even beloved pets. This was the home of a man who loved no one at all. That was a terrifying thought.
Steve's never been very good with relationships. While falling in love with a Nazi spy was an inauspicious start to his love life, it wasn't like he'd done much better with Betsy and Peggy than he had with Cynthia.
Tony laughs. "A strong heart and a chest full of flowers," he mutters, and he lets the drug take him down into a dreamless sleep.
"Here," Tony says. "You can help if you want. Hands-on activity. Let me show you how this all comes off." He grins. "Probably something you should know how to do for emergencies anyway, right?"
"It's okay," Tony says, softly. He's almost accepted it now. The words scrape against his raw throat. "I don't have a lot of time left. I know."
, that absolutely isn't human. But Tony knows, knows in his heart, that this is Steve and Steve isn't going to hurt him, and an instant later Steve's eyes are blue again.
Tony's nod is practically frantic. "You know how I told you that the bondage, with the rope, was like you touching me all over? This is like that, but it's
Afghanistan is terrible, for more reasons than the obvious. Tony has to take a break, twenty-three hours into designing the chestplate. Yinsen helps him dress his wounds again and gives him the last dose of morphine in the first-aid kit. Morphine, Tony knows, is also an antitussive. Thank God.
"Tony." Steve taps the side of Tony's jaw, the scruff of his beard, and Tony raises his eyes. "I'm offering double."
"But I-- I loved you too much," Iron Man continues. His eyes fall shut; he's just barely holding back tears. "I loved you too much, and I wanted you too much, and you made me so happy, and I was so lonely. So I lied to myself. I told myself it would be okay to just... have you, just for a little while. I told myself I'd show restraint. I told myself there were lines I wasn't going to cross. I told myself I'd stop before we went too far, before we got too close. I told myself I'd come clean then. I'd tell you the truth. And if I couldn't do that, I'd probably just leave you, and that would be the end of it." He's crying in earnest now; a muffled sob comes through the speakers.
It's a convoluted story and Tony is trying really hard to take it all in, but he can't help but come back to his parents' assassination.
A few steps away, a console with a monitor hooked up to a VHS lights up. The image is from an old surveillance tape that shows a car hitting a three, hard. Tony knows in his heart what this is even without the aid of the date displayed and the grief hits, sharp. He also knows that there are things that cannot be unseen, and Tony doesn't need the clarity of witnessing exactly how his parents died.
"I don't want to hide it! Secrets got us in this mess in the first place. I swore I'd tell you. I wanted to yesterday morning, after we talked about hiding that you had Morgan—"
Tony turns his head to the right and sees an older woman, he'd guess in her late seventies, sitting in the next chair and gazing indulgently at him. He didn't even know he had company. It's only after a few seconds that he recognizes her as Chancellor Almar, a member of the planet's high council.
He's about to put his phone away when a pop-up alert comes on. It's a message that asks Steve if he wants to accept a shared picture from James Rhodes. He hurries to accept, and it's the earlier one, with Tony and the kittens.
Okay, so Carol is easily recognized, which plays right into their plan, but she could have mentioned she was on a first-name basis with the bouncer. Who looks like Chewie. Tony gives a mental command to his very cool glasses to film the guy, as it's imperative he shows Rhodey. But then again, FRIDAY has standing orders to record everything from this op.
The last prototype isn't to Tony's taste, but he knows that continuing to poke at the design won't solve his problem. Not tonight, at least.
It would be great to have his best friend on board. Rhodey's always been fantastic at calming Tony down and constantly gives him perspective.
"No weapons allowed," Big Purple on the right says, but he throws a look at his friend after his eyes stop on the star on Carol's chest for a second.
"In Washington, there was a special Hydra operative. Well trained, very tough, gave us a hard time. They call him the Winter Soldier. And it's Bucky. Bucky Barnes." Steve was searching his face, wondering if the name meant something to Tony.
Tony opens one eye in interest at the change of tone. Steve looks astonished, and he's definitely not laughing anymore.
Tony's white hospital shirt is still unbuttoned, and Steve presses the device right onto his skin. It immediately sticks to his chest as if it's mounted on a magnet, and a shiver tickles the back of Tony's brain. It's hard to describe; it's more a concept than a clear thought, but it's… potential, possibilities. A lot of them, maybe endless; it almost gives him vertigo.
the male voice says. It's not unlike a director's commentary on a movie, and Anthony just confused himself with a comparison that doesn't quite make sense.
The wolf whines again, putting a paw over his snout, maybe to hide the flecks of blood still staining the golden fur of his jaw. Tony does not know why the wolf seems to want to greet him. He hesitates for a minute before playing along, extending his hand towards the beast who is less than two feet from him now. Its ears perk up and the huge tail starts wagging, which bodes well. Tony nonetheless yelps in surprise and brings his hand back rapidly when a surprisingly soft pink tongue wets his fingers with a sneaky little lick.
"Exactly!" Steve exclaimed. "But you're okay, so there's no reason not to tell you. Not really. Apart from maybe ruining everything—"
Steve shakes his head. "No. West Coast, I imagine a couple of days, tops." They'll want to stop the transaction, but also find the place where they're making the substance.
"How peculiar. On Asgard, cats do not enjoy getting wet," Thor says as he watches the show like the rest of them.
"Yay!" Tony exclaims, because he doesn't like awkward situations and everyone seems wrong footed right now. He'd love to go back to hugs. "It's 'Give back Rhodey friends who supposedly died by explosions' day!"
Every day, and sometimes more than once a day, Steve exchanges texts, pictures and calls with Tony. He's confident – and extremely happy – to say they are definitely friends, not just colleagues. It’s way more than simply being friendly with each other. It took a while, too long probably, and they had to learn each other's languages for it to happen. But now it's true.
When Fury asked them to investigate the F4's mysterious disappearance, Tony couldn't resist Steve's puppy eyes to search the Baxter Building. Tony had held on to his resentment about Steve's secrets and the fight in Siberia for eighteen long months, but it's hard to sustain when faced with Steve's earnest apologies and desire to be forgiven.
But Other-Steve stops them, pushes WIM-Tony so they can talk. "Wait, wait, wait, wait… Tarleton…" He gulps. "Did he survive?"
"Fuck!" he exclaims, shocked when he feels Tony swallow around his length. The final blow comes from seeing how blissed out Tony looks, glinting fathomless pupils in half-lidded eyes, his face flushed and pretty lips stretched wide while encircling Steve's dick. It's the hottest thing that he's ever seen. "I'm gonna—"
It's only once they reach the dance floor that the loud music hits them, which is quality sound design. At first they mimic the Iantusians around them, who look thrilled that they joined, and it’s a blast. No one looks self-conscious; they’re just getting their hands in the air and partying as if they don't care. The bass line is excellent, and Tony lets the music and buzz take over, eyes closed as he sways to the rhythm. It's addictive in its own right and Tony has always loved dancing, but when he opens his eyes, he's bowled over by how Steve is watching him. There's no mistaking it: for a second there, before Steve realizes Tony is looking back, there’s pure want written all over his face. It makes Tony's heart thud, hard, and he's rearranging everything in his head once more.
"I'm fine, we both are," Steve says, inclining his head towards Tony. "This is Tony. He stumbled into a Hydra camp last night."
Definitely a vigil then. Tony must have a severe concussion because he's missing the memory of whatever battle brought him here. It must have been a doozie because Cap looks tired, with lines at the corners of his eyes that Tony has never noticed before. It's as if he aged several years.
There are hands gripping his arms, and Tony tries to get away but he's stuck. Restrained. Oh shit, they have kidnapped him again, he won't do what they ask—
Tony feels Steve's hand rest tentatively, gently, on his back. He's so careful, as if he's worried he’ll be shaken off. When Tony allows it, the comfort grounding in this whirlwind of emotions, Steve rubs small circles between Tony's shoulder blades.
"I wouldn't have known what to do," Steve says. He's intently looking towards the man they could see from Richard's lab. They can now hear him singing while petting a horse that is tied to a post, a few feet away. "That guy looks a lot like you."
"No, I didn't," Steve says with a crooked smile. "I'm very much single and not looking to meet new people. Especially not in space."
Dismissing him for now, Tony stops on pictures of War Machine and someone in a smaller armor, blue and gold and a lot sleeker. Nanotech, like his own, and Tony wonders who the hell he gave a suit to. That’s huge. He almost drops his phone when there's a shot of the open visor and it's
But he has so much to learn. Tony forms two small balls of energy, one in each hand. He throws one to the side, where it hits the cupboards and ricochets straight back towards Steve. He raises the shield instinctively to protect himself, but Tony has already thrown the second one, this one on the floor, and Steve can't deviate both. The small blue ball that bounces on the tiles hits his thigh; even though Tony hasn't made it too strong, it delivers a sharp electric shock that makes Steve yelp in surprise.
Thinking of her hurts so badly, and he doesn’t know when he can think of her for more than a minute and not grieve.
"Yes, that's it. First time with a rubber nipple might be iffy, though her sister took to it like a champ. You need to push on the plunger very, very slowly and make sure she's swallowing by lightly resting your finger on her throat. Newborns don't have a gag reflex, so it's dangerous to go too fast."
"Please, Tony, please," he begs, when Tony rubs the gland on his lips, smearing Steve's pre-come as if it's an obscene version of lipstick.
Tony can't help it. He starts laughing as he throws his blanket on the man's lap. Not that the view isn't great, the guy is perfect all over, but this man might appreciate something to protect his modesty while he gathers his wit.
Steve is pale as a ghost. He drops his hand from Tony's back, and Tony misses the contact immediately or at least he does until Steve speaks. "I didn't tell you."
"There's another boy you've taken under your wing. Harley. But I don't know him much," Steve says. "You can’t do much about Spider-Man, at least when he’s in the spotlight for being a superhero, but you're very protective of your kids. I saw Morgan for the first time when we went to ask you for help with time travel. The entire world knows that you and Pepper had a child, but that's it. The paparazzi fought to publish a single stroller pic from a visit to the pediatrician, and it was with a blanket that hid her completely."
"I'm Tony." He offers his hands to shake, which Steve does with enthusiasm—his big palm dwarfing Tony's—and a beaming smile. God, he's handsome.
"You heard the ladies," Tony says, shuffling into the room. The bed is huge. There shouldn't be a problem if they want to respect boundaries.
"I see how it is," a new voice pipes up from the Compound's sliding door that opens onto the terrace.
They exchange a few punches, and Anthony sweeps Yon-Rogg's legs out from under him with a hold on his shoulders and a leg behind his shins. Anthony might be the most powerful fighter on Hala when he uses his powers, but at hand to hand he nonetheless has the reflex of using his opponents' strength against them. It comes instinctively, and Antony usually goes with it.
From there Tony is off, sketching schematics and pointing at different parts with enthusiasm. When the coffee is ready Steve gets Tony a cup. Instead of taking some himself, which would be the reasonable option even if it would hinder his sleep, Steve continues with the whiskey. Several sheets of paper later, when Tony went from the imagined rolling-wagon to plans for a more effective flour mill, Steve realizes he's downed a quarter of his bottle. It's not as bad as the bender after Bucky's death, but he's definitely feeling it.
Now that the fog is dissipating, Tony approaches too and yes, that's not quite his Steve but it's close enough. Very handsome, of course. WIM-Tony runs to the unconscious Steve but doesn't seem to know what to do, gauntleted hands hovering. "Please be alive." He finally touches Steve's cheek, then his chest, so very carefully.
Tony could do it easily with his nanotech, Steve reflects as he leans against the porch's guardrail to watch what has every sign of being a competition.
Only when he'd walked right up to Tony's chair did Steve seem to falter in his advance. He was looming a bit too close, blue eyes stormy with an emotion Tony didn't know how to decode.
That's the kind of shit that annoys Steve to no end. "He could have called himself. Or, I don't know, dropped by the Compound?"
"I can see that," Tal says, flushed. He's visibly very impressed and turned on at the development. "So, so cool!"
"It will be all right, honey," Tony says, kneading Steve's shoulders and neck. He's been hyper-focused from the moment Carol warned them of the Kree's imminent arrival.
It's heartbreaking how fast alarm ratchets up on Tony's face. Steve lets him go, raising his hands in a show of good faith.
They’re in the middle of a fight, for Christ's sake. He doesn't want Steve to get hurt over nothing. But then Nebula appears, just as concerned.
Speaking of love, Steve is standing tall on the battlefield, shield on his arm. Tony knew they could pull this off, but it's a relief to see that he doesn't appear hurt.
The kitten keeps mewling, though the pitch changes, as if it understands that there is less danger now. Steve picks the second one up with the utmost care, worried he might hurt it. It's so small, barely as big as two of his fingers. It can't be more than a few days old. Its eyes aren’t opened yet, and there's a piece of dried umbilical cord still attached to its belly. Poor thing.
"What do you want?" Steve asks, ripping his eyes away from Tony's cock. There's a flush on Tony's cheeks, dark enough to show in the lantern's light. "Tell me because I can't decide."
"I can close the rarely used partition between the cockpit and the cargo bay if you wish, Sergeant Barnes."
There's a deliberate enunciation with Tony's speech, obviously the result of too much alcohol. Steve's stomach drops; he thought Tony had finally made progress with that demon. He seemed better, tinkering in his smithy rather than spending his time at the casino's bar, and Steve was thrilled about it. Tony was like a new man since Steve's return, smiling instead of brooding and every inch the brilliant inventor he'd always boasted to be.
No one is sure when the Kree will come, but Tony is certain it will work. They are in the tricky situation of knowing about Kree tactics, but also that the Kree are aware that they know, which is why they might change it up. Or, on the contrary, go bold for the element of surprise. What is certain is that the Avengers need to engage the Kree significantly enough to make the point to leave them alone in the future.
But Steve doesn't open the window, just puts his hands on the inside ledge and peers out into the night.
The memories are surfacing more and more rapidly now. Only when Tony has the door closed and is flat on his back on his cot does he relax and allow the images and feelings to come back to him without restraint. It's disorienting; one memory makes him remember another one, and out of context some flashes are hazy and make little sense, but others are a lot clearer, especially when linked to powerful emotions.
Once upon a time, Tony tried to explain to a therapist how his brain worked, and the best comparison he'd found was a computer. A good one, of course, with the perfect combination of CPU, cache, RAM, bus speed, GPU, and operating system. When Tony begins something, be it a project for Stark Industries or something Avengers-related, it's akin to starting a process and allocating part of his brain power to the task. What makes him extremely productive is that he's able to run several processes at the same time, consciously and subconsciously.
"That's a personal pet project, and Earth has nothing to do with it. I don't know if trying to reason with this asshole makes any difference, Tony. He didn't understand the first time around. Maybe we should kill him."
"Ah!" It's true that Steve's skin feels colder than it used to; it might be the contrast because of Tony's now heightened metabolism. "As I said, powers."
." He insists on the last word for the benefit of their audience. "But I've just came back and I'm legally dead, so I think it's a gray area."
The plan is to, at one point, get into a fight. Carol assures them that it's just a matter of time as they happen like clockwork every night, but Tony doesn't want to play the waiting game. He's curious about this place and everyone in it who is so different from the snotty Sovereign and sympathetic Iantusians. The casino is filled with a surprising variety of shady-looking characters and clean-cut business types. They come in all shapes and colors too. There's a gambling table about fifteen feet to their right, and Tony can't resist its lure.
Of course Tony needs good prep or that big cock won't fit without hurting, which no one wants. But there's being careful, and then there's being slower than a glacier.
It's a dramatic exit, but it leaves the rest of them behind like idiots. Tony sighs and extends his arms.
"Yeah, our tiny babies," Steve says fondly. He loves the two little furballs, and co-parenting them with Tony is a gift that keeps on giving, "Speaking of, we should give them names."
The golden coverlet is silky and the mattress the perfect firmness, allowing Tony to sink down a few inches. It's wonderful, and he sighs in contentment.
"Is that a joke? At my expense?" Tony puts a hand over his heart. He's very proud of Nebula right now.
It's crass, and he knows it. But it's also honest. He just hopes that Steve isn't too bothered by Tony leaving with someone else; it is not his intention to make him sad or jealous.
"I can take care of myself on a battlefield and you know it," Hildr says. It has the air of a long-disputed argument.
"As I already told you, 99.5% certain, Colonel," JARVIS says for the benefit of everyone. Only then does Rhodey lift his face plate, and his eyes are wide, clearly astonished.
Tony admits that it's a job with merit. But does he really want to know all about Bucky Barnes' redemption arc? He's not so sure. There's a white cat playing with the tools on the bench, and when Tony tries to approach it—he's always loved cats—it looks straight at him and puffs up. It's as if he can feel his out of phase presence, which is weird but cool.
"Summoned?" Tony asks when Steve sighs in frustration. He took enormous care to be as detailed as possible on his report on Bolivia when he was writing it on the plane coming back, in order to avoid just this. It was a sensitive mission for sure; Steve should have expected not to get out of a thorough review by Fury. SHIELD might officially be gone, but he's still pulling strings in the background.
"My odds were at a fraction of a thousandth of a point of percentage, Sir, but you always manage to surprise." JARVIS' tone is warm now and Tony grins in return.
He pulls in Tony tighter against his body and moves his hips, pushing against Tony in a way that rubs their dicks together. It feels great. He's so keyed up from just kissing and a little frottage, which bodes well for the rest.
Steve's eyes are sparkling with mischief as he shrugs off his harness, and wiggles out of the top of his uniform before attacking the fastening of his pants.
At long last WIM-Tony breaks the totally-a-hug and steps back to now hold Other-Steve with an arm around his side.
As soon as his back is turned, though, it's clear that Other-Steve is not as well as he pretends, collecting his breath and psyching himself to start walking.
It wouldn't be practical in a fight situation, but he's certain that he can carry both Steve and Nebula for a short distance without a problem. Tony touches the shield that’s still in Steve's hand and immediately reorganizes it into stabilization winglets. It's a cool party trick for their audience too.
"I will monitor the babies to ensure maximum comfort," FRIDAY says, with a sense of gravitas that has Steve smiling. He wouldn't be surprised if the kittens are now even more of a priority than the Avengers for Tony. Which Steve doesn't mind at all. It's adorable.
Tony squints at her. Some memories are coming back, though clearly it's the dark and traumatic ones first. It makes sense that they'd be the most vivid. But everything else is very patchy.
"They'll want this one back," she says, pointing at Tony. "Or to kill us both. I'm pretty sure they're regrouping and will be on their way shortly."
"Actually—" He must have waited for too long, because Tony cuts over him and speaks at the same time.
Tony blinks a few times, mouth forming a little 'o'. Steve wants to die. Oh my god, he's going to stomp Bucky to
Callie's always been the more cautious of the two sisters. She might wish to follow Snowball at one point, but Steve will let her go at her pace.
"Thank you, Thor, Queen Frigga, esteemed people of Asgard." Tony inclines his torso to everyone in turn. He sees from the corner of his eye that Cora is following suit by bowing her head in synchronicity, and Tony barely represses a smile. Of course she's a performer. "It's an honor and a privilege to have the chance to be here."
In theory, when facts and needs are calculated without room for emotion, Tony understands the reasoning. In practice, though… It sucks. He can imagine that the lottery doesn’t grant many couples their wish for children, and he has a feeling Chancellor Almar is one of the people whose wish wasn’t granted.
When you don't resist the pull, passing through the portal is shockingly easy. The room they end up in is circular, built around a spherical contraption at its center that rotates with various other pieces of tech. Tony has no idea what this gyrosphere is. The whole place is made of metal, and there are rows of red lights on the wall panels. One small corridor seems to lead out of the room, but it's closed with an airlock. Tony is about to suggest they test if they can walk through when it suddenly opens. A man with an Iron Man armor flies over the threshold, before walking in, cautious. The suit is mainly white with a bit of gold and metallic gray, but it's unmistakably another him as proved by the open visor.
When she's finished and cleaned, Steve switches for the black baby, who only cries out louder knowing chow is coming.
"Yeah. Which would work very well if you want us to explore BDSM, because you, my darling, give all the signals of being a submissive."
As soon as they've entered their ship to finally escape those tedious people, Carol digs at him goodnaturedly.
"Oh my God." The kid takes off his cowl to reveal a baby face and tousled brown hair, eyes wide as he stares at Tony. He looks 12 years old. "Tony Stark! You're Tony Stark!"
"Do you... do you think..." Steve starts haltingly, searching Tony with his big soulful blue eyes. "Can you ever forgive me?"
Something doesn't translate right, maybe Steve's tone or his words are too blunt; fear flashes in Tony's eyes as he scrambles up, almost tipping his chair backwards.
It’s the right thing to say, because Tony nods and his hands slide down Steve's back to squeeze his ass, making him buck forward. It feels so good. Unfortunately, Tony is clearly still apprehensive.
As if they haven't been attached at the hip since his return. But Tony agrees that it's not the same thing as time off and nothing to do but enjoy each other.
He doesn't need it, apart from the link to JARVIS, but it might become useful if sharing a plane with the super soldiers becomes too much (either to shut himself in it or fly it to their eventual destination).
"Ah. In short, the ones who kidnapped me, the Krees, will probably show up sooner rather than later to either grab me again or kill me. They're strong, they're well trained, and they have lots of firepower, including spaceships. It's an all hands on deck emergency, or I'm possibly dead for real. I don't know about you guys, but I'd prefer that it didn't happen."
"Turned him into a furry pincushion. It thankfully didn't take before the danger had passed. The werewolf gig was up when he changed back right before my eyes this morning." Judging by their expressions, Dugan and Barnes seem more worried about Steve's secret being out than the man himself. "I won't say anything, don't worry. I work on classified operations often, I know how it is."
But he has to admit, as they make their way towards a beautiful golden city in the distance, that the place has style.
But Frigga continues with a teasing smile, “Also life magic, mystery of creation, mischievousness, manipulation. More often than not, a trickster.”
Which is… okay, Jim is consistent and trying to prove a point to Tony. It's as perfect an occasion as any for Steve to come clean.
"Hey, hey, hey," Tony shushed, rubbing up and down Steve's arm. "You can tell me anything, you know that."
It's supposedly not his purpose. Or so Yon-Rogg and the Supreme Intelligence keep telling Anthony, at least. He's frankly pissed about it, and would appreciate having this purpose clearly spelled out to him, thank you very much. He's convinced that it has to do with Vers, traitor to the Krees and Enemy Number One, but nobody outright admits it. Hell, Anthony
"You're going to be the death of me!' Tony says once he's painted Steve's tongue and cheeks with his release. Hell, Steve nearly got some in an eye, it's caught in his eyelashes. "Such a good boy, you're perfect."
Tony throws his head back and laughs. Steve should be miffed, but it's a beautiful sight. When Tony looks down again, Steve is making an exaggerated pout for effect, which makes Tony chuckle some more.
Like most of the team, Tony plays in Half State on defense, humanoid but for his short spotted fur, little round ears and tail. He and the other cats have incredible reflexes, and SHIELD is renowned as having one of the best defenses in the league. But where Tony shines the most is when he runs the bases. He obviously has to bat in Half State. But as soon as he makes contact, he leaps and transforms in a second to hit the ground running on four legs in order to speed towards first base. And, well, often to second, third or more if the ball breaches the infield. In twenty games so far, Tony has stolen twenty five bases and managed a whooping ten inside-the-park home runs. He also got caught a few times because he went too fast and got himself stuck behind a teammate that doesn't round the bases as fast as he does. He's learning though, and getting better every game. It's no surprise that Tony amassed quite a crowd of rabid fans- Steve included.
Tracing the planes and dips of Tony's muscled stomach with his tongue, Steve feels better than he's had in years. It's a far cry from mere weeks ago when Lester shot him and Fisk threw him to the pigs.
Rhodes' question makes Tony jump in surprise. He puts his palm on his chest, right over the repulsor pump, and can feel his heart race.
There he goes, the infamous Vers again, or Captain Marvel as she calls herself now. From what Anthony has pieced together through gossip, Yon-Rogg and Vers were close years ago. He used to train her too. But she inexplicably turned against their race to side with the Skrulls, which left a stain on Yon-Rogg's reputation.
"You know Steve is interested, and you do nothing?"  She visibly expected that Tony would fall into Steve's arms, delighted at the opportunity.
"I know," Steve says, voice rough with desire. He tilts his head to the side, offering himself with complete trust.
"Come on, come on!" Tony bunched Steve's T-shirt up under his arms, but now it’s infuriatingly stuck.
Tony's heart lurches and then starts rabbiting at that. It seems pretty straightforward as far as declarations go, but Tony is afraid to hope just yet.
"Of course," Steve says. He wonders if it will top Snowball dramatically crying earlier as she tried to get out of the weighting box, and falling over several times in the process. She's downright hilarious, and a total drama queen.
Tony winces because that must have been awful if he was close to the kid. He can't believe that a teenager followed him in space to fight a mad titan. His death was on Tony, and he must have thought that then too if what Steve is saying is right.
"Everyone starts with three up and three down," Nebula says. "There are as many rounds as there are players. In the end, the person who has the better hidden tile combination wins."
"Yes, please," he says as Steve takes hold of his hand and slides the ring on his finger once more, then kisses it, making something settle in Tony's chest.
He's trying to exercise restraint right now. As tempting as it is to sit Tony on the counter, slide between his knees and go to town on him, Steve wants to pace himself. Add a little romance and show Tony that not only does he absolutely adore his bubble butt, but that he wants to spoil him too.
“Yes, be prudent with your interpretation,” Frigga says kindly. “I agree that crows or ravens are a powerful symbol of war, but they have a special meaning here in Asgard. I have never seen a daemon take that form before.”
"Yeah, that summer I spent some time with Bill Gates – Dad's idea. Bill was, what, nineteen? He was in Harvard if I remember correctly, and he didn't quite know what to do with me at first. But he showed me about computers and all that. And then I built a circuit board," Tony says.
He's going great, judging by how content the small black kitten looks, happily feeding from the nipple. Steve's is squirming as if impatient, and he pushes harder on the plunger with trepidation.
"I don't think so. We put Earth on the map and they're curious already. If we play this right, they'll at least be cautious," Carol says. "A little fight where we kick ass is all it takes."
"If you will excuse me," Thor says, throwing them a look as he spins Mjolnir. "I need to borrow your prisoner, we shall have a chat."
Steve hurries closer and falls on his knees beside Tony, scanning him for injuries. It takes only a moment to realize that's not the issue at all. As it is, the problem is laying on its back on a blanket on the ground in front of Tony, chewing on a tiny fist and kicking its legs while looking at him with round blue eyes. Blinking several times doesn't make it disappear.
By now, preparing the syringes and the milk is almost automatic, having done it five times before going to bed. Feeding the two babies one after the other is different, but it goes very well. Being left hungry and alone in the incubator outrages the black kitten, and she meows until it's her turn.
They hadn't told the team—it made sense, you don't broadcast you are fuckbuddies—even though Tony would have bet that half of them knew something was going on. As Tony was incapable of not telling at least someone, he confided in Rhodey, but that was pretty much it. He loved Steve, and sometimes he thought it was reciprocated, but he'd never dared voicing it out loud and disrupting their arrangement. Time would get Steve there, he hoped, and Tony was letting him process being in a relationship with a man at his own pace.
Light shimmers around the now kneeling man as he raises his hands while the armor he wears transforms to something lighter, helmet gone. He has long dark hair, slicked back, and doesn't look as cocky as moments ago.
"Ah, but that was mostly luck. A series of circumstances that went our way, really. The first fight, pre-Decimation, happened on our planet, and let me tell you, we were woefully unprepared. We lost so badly." He shakes his head, looking at his lap while trying to show as much shame as he can. It's easy. Just hearing the story and imagining the disaster fills him with guilt, even if he doesn't remember the events themselves. Tony had known that it was coming; he can't believe they didn't prepare enough. "I'm certain you would have dealt with restoring the balance in the universe a lot faster than the five years it took us."
It's with reluctance that he finally drops Steve's wrist. It’s strange how he's still angry and hurt but nonetheless found comfort in the contact. Without daring to check Steve's face, because he can’t deal with Steve's feelings on top of his own right now, Tony moves towards the edge of the bed.
A woman enters the room and she strikes Tony speechless. She's a cute brunette with blue eyes and a friendly demeanor, dressed all in white too, but her skin is magenta. A deep, beautiful color, really, but Tony is freaking out. Something’s very wrong.
"Okay, fine, I got hit hard enough. But it's a small one," Tony argues. Slight nausea, and the start of a headache already, but he’s ridden this rodeo more than a few times.
Reintegrating into public life is a pain in the ass though. There's way too much attention on him whenever he goes out, ten times worse than in the past. Or maybe it's that he's more aware of it because he'd been almost anonymous on Hala. On the upside, hopefully it will help to lure Kree.
"I'm fine," he says between clenched teeth. He doesn't seem to appreciate that Tal stopped for a chat instead of getting out of Dodge.
"Country leaders started speaking up, or more precisely, talking to each other about how they thought superhuman individuals, or a team like the Avengers, should operate. They asked for accountability."
"Breathe. Calm down," Steve says several times in a row. He puts a big, warm hand in the middle of Tony's back, just resting there. It helps. "Everything is okay. They removed the shrapnel; you're in no danger."
Tony sighs loudly, but he will go pour them a few inches of water for a bath. He can't refuse those two anything, and everyone knows it.
After a pause he chuckles, and Tony wonders why until Steve smiles at him. "Buck said thanks for the warning and that he won't shoot then."
"Well, tough it. It's about time we finally meet." With that, Cora jumps and flaps her wings enough to reach Tony's shoulder, gripping the armor with her claws. "Please don't shove me off anymore."
They eventually reach Steve's bedroom and Tony gently pushes so he falls on the bed. Tony takes a minute to take in the sight of him; he's a vision, sprawled against the sheet and deliciously rumpled by the make-out session.
High Priestess Ayesha inclines her head very slightly, almost dismissively, and Tony hopes that everyone keeps their cool and bites their tongue. Hopefully Carol and Steve understand that Tony wants them to look borderline incompetent. No one wants those assholes to come and poke at Earth.
"Hi, Cap," Rhodes says. He pauses his conversation with Sam and tilts his head to the side upon noticing the bag. "Going somewhere?"
Clearly, Tal finds the revelation to his taste because he's right in Tony's bubble again, daring to put a hand on Tony's lower back for an instant. It's been a while since Tony's been hit on this bluntly by a stranger, and he won't lie and say it's unpleasant.
Another crazy situation, but that's life as an Avenger, after all. Heroes against foes that are more and more dangerous every day… it keeps them on their toes. Steve's finishing his second glass of water—he hadn't realized how parched he was—when Jarvis enters the kitchen, holding a broom and pan. Dust gets everywhere when the tower withstands damage.
Again, Tony is blown away and has to rethink everything when the wolf very clearly shakes its head no, going left and right several times. It also stays flat on the ground, as if to look less menacing for Tony, even though it's so huge the top of its back is as high as Tony sitting up.
Tony stared at him blankly. "No one. Well, I mean, Donahue's assistant. Plus anyone who had access to his or my calendar. That's not a whole lot of people on my side; I don't know about Donahue's. Oh, and Ty, obviously. I called him to let him know as soon as I set the meeting up."
Tony was checking his injury, Steve told himself. As a teammate. It didn't mean anything. And then Tony looked up and met Steve's gaze. The wordless question was obvious in his eyes:
This is another new addition to the game, which is why Steve had forgotten they were doing it. He's not sure it's going to be right, but there's only one way to find out.
"We both know where the sore spots are, Tony," he said. "And the news doesn't even know about half of them. Yes, there were the Guardsmen at the Vault. But there was also the Kree Supreme Intelligence. Or that time six months ago when Mentallo attacked you and you wiped all our minds."
For most people that would have been just a figure of speech. They both knew that Steve meant it very, very literally.
And Tony was with someone who made him happy. Even if Steve didn't like the guy much, it could have been much worse. Tony had definitely made worse choices. But Tiberius was Tony's oldest friend. Tony knew him. Tony knew him very, very well. It wasn't going to be another Whitney Frost situation, or another Kathy Dare situation, or-- okay, so it was a long list. But Tiberius Stone surely wasn't going to be on that list. He was good for Tony. He had to be.
The praise warmed Steve's heart. Even if Tony would never mean it the way he wanted it, it was more than enough.
, Shellhead." He's still on edge, waiting; Iron Man hasn't given him a straight answer yet. "And I was hoping you might care about me too." He pauses. He hates to think of it, but he should probably start contemplating rejection about now. "But if you don't want to--"
Tony must have been in a bad way, if he was flat-out asking. Of course he was in a bad way. He was crying. But Tony almost never asked for things like this, even when he was sad, like he thought it was a terrible imposition. And of course Steve knew Tony had a whole lot of reasons to feel extremely upset right now. But there was a difference between knowing that and seeing Tony go to pieces in front of him.
"Right," Steve echoed, and though he still didn't sound particularly convinced he stepped forward toward what once had been the main door, leaning on Tony all the way.
Steve brings up a blank Google search page and pulls the keyboard a little closer. What materials had Mr. Stark mentioned? He'd said ceramic first; maybe then that's the best choice. Steve starts typing in his question:
"Excuse me a second," Tony said, and then he muted himself on comms. "I have to find an electrical outlet."
At around two, they stopped to order pizza. Tony put his helmet back on and flew up to get the boxes from the bewildered delivery guy. He tipped extra -- the guy had had to navigate the war zone that was now the front entrance, after all -- then carried the pizza boxes back down and spread them out on the newly-cleared floor as the Avengers gathered around. Tony promptly cracked his helmet, slid off his gauntlets, and, with a flourish, pulled out the paper plates he'd found miraculously preserved next to the fridge in his workshop.
The shears are sharp, and they make short work of Tony's bonds. Several seconds later, Tony is lying on the bed in the middle of a mess of short lengths of rope. He's free. He's physically free. Mentally, he's definitely not all there. He's still not quite focusing. His expression, which on any other mission would be intent and professional at this point, is far too expressive. And fear still clouds his gaze.
Iron Man stares at him for a few seconds. At least he's stopped laughing now. "It's another word for unsolicited commercial e-mail," he says, patiently. His voice is kind. "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to make you feel bad. It's called spam because-- okay, you know what, we can talk about Monty Python some other time." Steve's not sure Iron Man's speaking English anymore. "Anyway," he continues, "even if you're a polite kind of person, which you are, you shouldn't bother reading your spam. No one does. And Viagra
Steve took a few steps to the side and then back, practically pacing, still not looking at him. "Fine," Steve said, and Christ, but he was a terrible liar. "Fine. I just-- I had a favor to ask you, and it made more sense to ask in person. I probably should have called first. I'm sorry."
It's plain to see that Tony hasn't slept here in quite a few days. The linens have all been changed, and the bed is neatly made, professionally made, all tucked in. The sheets are an unstained white, expensive. Bland. None of Tony's usual detritus -- keys, phone, wallet, watch, crumpled receipts, spare change, scrawled notes and other people's business cards -- has accumulated on either of the nightstands. The lamps are dim, radiating soft light. It feels like an upscale hotel room. This isn't where Tony's soul is.
"So Maurice goes and visits him. And absolutely none of Clive's plans work out, because while Maurice is there he falls in love with one of the servants. Alec, the gamekeeper. Alec's not someone Maurice should be with, right? For more than one reason. He's a man, he's working-class. He's not suitable. But he's also the real thing. He's everything Clive wasn't. He's gay. He's not ashamed of it. And he, uh. He does all the gay stuff. They sleep together. And they're in love. And it's everything Maurice didn't know he was missing. He's happy. He's really happy, this time. Alec's supposed to move overseas with his brother, but at the last minute he decides to stay in England and be with Maurice."
"You're a bold one," Iron Man murmurs. It sounds like he's talking to himself. "What in the world am I going to do with you?"
"So we talked. He was a wreck, of course. As you'd expect, from a man who'd just lost both his parents in a tragic accident. There was wine. There was rather a lot of wine, actually." Tony's gaze was very, very faraway. "You know," he said, and he sounded far, far too calm, suddenly, "when I used to think about what we'd done, when I told myself the story of it in my head, I used to say that
Steve's eyes were stinging. He wanted to ask Tony how he knew all of it, how he'd named it with unerring accuracy. Then he realized he knew exactly how Tony knew.
"No, no!" Tony says, hurriedly, stepping back, beckoning Steve forward. "Please do come in. I just need to get ready for the day."
Steve doesn't know who could be so unkind to Iron Man. He turns his hand over and squeezes Iron Man's hand right back. "I love you," he says. "And I'm staying with you for as long as you want me. It doesn't matter to me what you can or can't do. That's not what this is about, Shellhead." He knows his body is doing his best to make that sentence into a lie. He sighs. "It just... doesn't take all that much to get me all worked-up, these days." Another thing the serum has given him. "But that doesn't mean I have to do something about it."
He regards Steve with hollow, exhausted eyes, and he manages a flicker of a smile. "Good morning, Captain."
Iron Man sucks in a noisy breath; his gauntleted fingers twitch like he wants to hold Steve's hand and is trying to talk himself out of it. "Yeah, but," Iron Man says. "But. Me? Really?" He shakes his head. "I just." He sighs. "It always goes wrong. I know you don't believe me, but it does."
Encouraged, Steve uses a little bit more of his strength, pressing down a little more firmly on the next pass. And then he actually digs in, pushing with the heels of his hands, kneading the muscles underneath his hands. Tony is making a constant very low noise, stuttering and changing in pitch as he breathes out, as he groans when Steve hits a particularly sore spot. Steve can feel the tightness beneath his fingers start to lessen as he works at a knot with his fingertips.
"Is the mood any better now?" Steve asked, smiling, between one kiss and the next; he didn't want to stop kissing Tony for any reason whatsoever. "Little more up now, are we?" He shifted his leg, nudging Tony's cock slightly, so there would be no question about what he meant, as Tony breathed out soft and surprised and rubbed back against him.
Did Tony really think Steve was going to be upset with him about that? Did he really think that was why Steve had brought it up? Tony surely had to know that Steve wanted him no matter how many people he'd been with. Steve knew exactly who he'd taken to bed. He had only been talking about his own inexperience.
, that was what that was. The rarest metal on the planet was sitting right here in someone's BDSM toybox.
"I know," Tony said, with a faint smile. "And that means the world to me. It really does. You meant a lot to me when I didn't even know you, too. When I was having a hard time, I'd-- I'd tell myself to be brave like Captain America." He chuckled. "I still do, sometimes."
Impressed, Steve grins back at him. "Well, congratulations, because you sure nailed it. This is wonderful. Not that I remember this place."
This is not the most dignified position he's ever been in, and he feels a little silly swinging one leg over Tony and coming down kneeling, one leg on either side of him. The towel between them slips out of the way as Steve settles, and that's much nicer. He's a little off-balance and his hands end up on the outside of Tony's arms as Steve slides forward. He's putting more of his weight on Tony than he meant to, leaning further forward, pressing up against Tony's back.
But Iron Man lays a hand on his arm. "No, let me," he says, insistent. "I'm fireproof. And I'm faster."
, it's-- it's everything I've ever wanted. I'm dead serious. I can't think of anything I've ever wanted in my life more than this. God."
At least he doesn't have to cut Tony out of this, thank God. But even when Tony's arms are freed, he still doesn't move them; he just lets them hang limply behind his back, like his brain thinks he's still bound. His wrists cross.
The thought of just curling up next to Iron Man and getting some sleep -- cuddling with him the whole night! -- is incredibly appealing, but surely Iron Man has to know why that isn't a possibility. "Your boss is going to get up eventually, Shellhead," Steve points out. "And he's probably going to want to do some work, and then he's going to come down here and find us. I'd love to stay with you, but I-- I'd rather not have him interrupt a private moment."
Iron Man is silent for a long time, but he's breathing so heavily Steve can hear it through the filters, a rasp of static.
"I know." Tony shrugged. "No big deal. It was a mistake, Not the worst way anyone's ever found out who I am. At least this time I had all my clothes on, right?" he murmured, and he raised his eyebrows.
"We really don't have to do anything," Steve said, going back to his original point. "I don't want to push you. I understand if that's not something you want, if it's too fast. I'd be fine with going to sleep. I just want you to know that there are... options."
is not a level I ever thought he'd want to descend to." Pleading, he looked at Steve. "He's a good guy, Steve. He really is. This isn't like him. He's never done anything like this."
inside him? What had he done to Tony's heart? Steve could feel his fists clench. He didn't think he'd ever punched anyone who was unconscious, but the idea was sounding better and better.
Steve was beginning to see the shape of the idea now. "You mean, like a virtual version of the Combat Simulation Room?"
Steve can feel his face go hot. He can't stop looking at Tony, in his shining armor, in Steve's very own bed. It's deeply satisfying in a way that Steve isn't sure there are words for, seeing Tony here, like this. "I mean," Steve adds, "this wasn't really how I imagined getting you into my bed, but I'll take it."
He knows the word is old-fashioned now; he wouldn't have said it if he hadn't been thinking about the bars.
"Whoa, easy there!" Steve said, from somewhere behind him, and when Tony glanced down he could see Steve's gloved hands on his shoulders, urging him back up.
Tony licks his lips again. "I could take care of that for you," Tony offers, slow and lazy. His eyes haven't moved above Steve's waist, and Steve enjoys the rush of it, seeing how much Tony clearly wants to get his mouth on him. Tony's too far under to be coy about it, and Steve likes that too. "You could come over here, put me wherever you want. Fuck my face. I know how much you like that."
"You don't seem like you're enjoying being a vampire," Tony says. "I don't think I would, either." He sighs. "I know you're offering me... a sure thing. I get it. I appreciate it more than I could ever tell you, believe me. But I think-- I think I'd rather take my chances as a human. They say I've got a chance. And that's what I want. Even if I get centuries, I don't want to hide in the dark. I never have."
"I, um," Steve says, roughly. He feels graceless. Inelegant. He doesn't think this could ever be a tactful proposition --
By the time Steve got back to the mansion, he knew he was far, far too twitchy with nerves to be able to do anything remotely productive. Working on team administration duties was right out. And, after last week, he knew that recreational sparring was definitely out. He didn't have the focus. But at least now he was aware of that.
"Yeah, we'll get to that." WIM-Tony looks at Other-Steve critically, who shakes his head and rubs at his face. "Do you think you can walk?"
DUM-E is guarding the door when Steve reaches the lab. He then rolls towards the table where the incubator is set and trills approvingly as Steve follows.
"I do want us to go out sometime," Tony affirms, reaching out to grab Steve's forearm. "Surely you noticed that all of those versions of me loved you back, no? Come on, Steve, it was embarrassingly obvious."
"Awww, don't cry!" Johnny tells Grimm, who rubs the corner of his eye with the back of his massive fist. It's an excellent distraction from staring at what Tony will never have for himself.
Steve hadn't noticed from the porch, but Tony iced the small hill. It makes sense: it must make the descents a lot faster and the slope easier to maintain. It's with reasonable confidence that he won't fall on his ass that Steve starts gliding down. He lowers his center of gravity, extends his arms, and he likes to think it's relatively elegant even as he swerves not to collide with Tony, Jim and their tube. Stopping is the trickiest part: Steve deviates to the right until he can jump and end with both of his boots in the snow that flanks the slide.
"I do," Steve says, vibrating with happiness. Tony asked him to come first. "I miss them a lot." He misses spending time with Tony even more.
"They speak to each other?" Steve had never realized that DUM-E communicated with the AI intelligibly.
"Colonel Phillips thinks everyone is a nuisance." The 'including me' is implied, and it comforts Tony in his theory that Steve is linked to the Army. There’s no other reason for an American to be in this neck of the woods, pun totally intended. "But grumpy Colonel aside, I'd bet that everybody who's ever read and enjoyed one issue of Marvels would love to meet its most famous, rich, courageous, and handsome adventurer."
Something touches Tony's leg and he startles, eyes wide open and heart racing. It's the wolf, who has started to stir and bumped Tony's thigh with a front paw. The night is ending, the full moon setting while the first rays of light of the day are surely only minutes away as the sky is already lightening. Tony dares to pet the wolf again, but flinches and brings his hand back when there is weird movement under his fingers.
"How fascinating," he says, as if he can't be bothered by what is happening right now. One of the biggest lies of his life. "I have the remote, can you get us home?"
He wants Tony. Has for a long time. It is complicated to prefer men, especially with his previous and probably future position as sheriff. Steve's supposed to be one upholding the Law, and many people would probably want him kicked out of town if not worse upon learning about his affections. Before, in the Army, finding a partner wasn't hard, even if most men would swear up and down that the sex was simple stress relief, that they had a sweetheart or wife at home. It might even have been true for many. But it's deeper than that for Steve, it's how he's made. He accepted it ages ago, with the conviction he'd end his days as a bachelor.
That changed the situation here, all right. Now Steve definitely didn't understand what was going on. It was possible, remotely possible, that it could all have been a coincidence. That would mean that the whole fight was real. It was unlikely. But if it had been a setup, that meant that Tiberius either specifically wanted Iron Man dead or just didn't care if he died. And neither of those options were good. There was no way Tiberius knew Tony was Iron Man, because obviously he wouldn't have been trying to kill him. It wasn't like he wanted Tony dead, after all. But if he was the one behind this, then he definitely didn't care about Iron Man's life.
"Who said anything about that?" Steve can feel his face heat, but he keeps talking anyway. "I'm not a saint. And I have hands. They work just fine."
is the one who's prepared. "And there's probably some oil in the top drawer there." He rolls onto his back and throws an arm in the vague direction of the nightstand. "You'll be able to tell which bottle is the appropriate lube. Don't worry." He's grinning in earnest now.
He wanted it to be his decision. His choice. He should have told Steve years ago, but he only had now.
Tony's jeans undone, practically hanging off his hips, barely exposing a tantalizing glimpse of everything beneath--
There's an unexpected ripple of grief across Steve's face; his fists finally unclench. "Truman," he says, and the name sounds hollow. "President Roosevelt passed away yesterday."
He hit Flag Smasher right in the chest, and the man -- LMD? whatever, Tony didn't care -- went down like a sack of potatoes.
It didn't mean anything. Of course Tony was happy to see his old friend. It was just for this evening. And Tony had told Steve they could go out for brunch tomorrow, so Steve would still get a chance to spend time with him soon.
He couldn't-- it couldn't possibly be because he didn't want to talk about Tiberius, could it? Steve had told him it was fine, on Sunday. They'd talked it all out. He'd thought Tony had understood that he was fine with it. So why was Tony acting like he was scared of telling the truth?
. It was wrong to out someone who didn't want to be out. And it was wrong to treat it as a weapon, to make being queer into something filthy and dirty and damaging. Which was absolutely what the press would do, if they found out. And it would be all Steve's fault. Steve would be no better than those he fought against.
Tony's nostrils flare. "Do you know why you're in that uniform? Do you know why you're not an Avenger? Do you know why you tortured those men?" He stabs a finger in the air. "Because you decided to. You're the one who put on that uniform. You're the one who picked up those guns."
The last time Steve had seen Tiberius, Steve had walked in on him with a hand down Tony's pants. Although, Steve realized, he'd been just as confident then too.
It was a miracle he hadn't concussed himself on the way down, really. But blood was still pouring out of him, and it looked like he was all out of miracles.
wouldn't do that," Steve said, finally, voicing his conclusion at last. "You wouldn't, Tony. Because you know it's not right. So it's not right for him to do that to you."
The few pieces of art, here and there, looked like they had been purchased not because anyone specifically liked them but because they had clearly cost some money and would impress a visitor. There was an early Monet on one wall, and something abstract and multicolor that was too modern for Steve to place but that he suspected had been very expensive. It was all... overdone. And Avengers Mansion was clearly a mansion, sure, but it was also just as clearly filled with things that the people who lived in it
Steve's underwear definitely wasn't hiding much of anything, and Tony sure didn't look like he minded. Tony looked, in fact, like he wanted to get right back to touching Steve as soon as possible.
Steve knew he was a little bigger than most guys, big enough that his size was sometimes intimidating to his partners. Honestly he sometimes wished he were a little smaller, if only so he wouldn't put people off. Then he felt odd about wishing that, because everyone knew guys weren't supposed to want that. But if this was what Tony wanted, then, God, for once in his life he was glad of it.
Steve stood there, half in the doorway, and he couldn't stop staring. Tony was sitting at the table, spooning cereal into his mouth with one hand, holding the Daily Bugle with the other. The small TV on the counter was tuned to one of the news channels, volume low, murmuring to itself. Tony liked to call this little ritual his recommended daily information allowance for breakfast. It wasn't anything unusual, anything out of the ordinary. It just... was. And Steve loved him.
favorite," he adds to Eddie, as he eventually manages to peel the sticker off without removing his gloves.
Steve couldn't bring himself to take himself off the active roster. At least fifty percent of the reason was the fact that he didn't want to look Jan in the eye and explain what he'd done to himself. But it was going to be okay. Eventually. He'd heal. He always did.
"No!" he says, hastily, and Iron Man wobbles in his suit like he instinctively tried to step backwards and didn't make it. Steve is aware that, under his gloves, his palms are sweating. "I mean, no, definitely not," he says, softer now. God, he's so nervous that Iron Man's going to think he doesn't like him. "You're great, Shellhead. You're the best. You're perfect."
"As I said, we won a big battle. A lot because of you. It had an impact all over the universe, and several worlds, some who had never heard of Earth before, want to meet us. Carol convinced Fury it was a convenient way to build good credibility if we ever need help in the future."
Surely it's not that bad? Callie probably just needs some reassurance. Steve crouches down and puts his hand under her belly so she's up on her paws once more. He then gently pulls on the leash again so that she can feel the tug, and moves her with it. She lets her legs drag without even trying to stand on her own.
Tony is both entertained and exasperated at them, but the brawl is getting more heated so he can't spare much attention to their cock fight. Ha.
"There's other stuff," Steve replies with a shrug. "Excellent tea, and with more kick than any coffee you've ever had. You said so yourself."
"Fair enough," Tony says. The baby is blowing bubbles now, as if to get Tony to pay attention to him again. Steve can relate: he likes when Tony looks at him, too. "I called you because I was kind of panicking, and my usual reflex is to ask myself 'what would Cap do?'. So."
"Hungry, huh?" Steve asks. She has a stronger appetite than her sister – up to 6 cc now, while the other is at 4 – and is gaining weight more rapidly. She screams again as if she understands.
The tip of Steve's ears go pink as he looks at the floor. He always gets flustered when Tony shamelessly flirts, it's adorable.
"That's quite the story." Rhodey pulls Tony in a little tighter, even kisses his temple. "Thanks for bringing my favorite idiot back, Carol."
Tony nods. "Yeah, for Rhodey." He must see the disappointment on Steve's face because he chides. "I told you, I'm done."
A quick look over the texts on his phone and Steve winces. Okay, so it's not strike soon, it's strike now.
It sobers Steve up, who goes back to intensely earnest. Now that Tony dares to look for it, adoration is all over his face. "Yes, yes, of course. I love you. I've been in love with you for so long. Before we got together, even. One of my biggest regrets was that I never told you."
"You just got scent-marked by your crush, buddy!" Bucky informs him with a grin, hitting Steve hard on the rump. He's always been a little shit.
He's pretty sure that Clint and Nat would blow everyone's mind on that show, but they don't like the spotlight. Ex-spy reflexes. Bruce would categorically refuse to participate. Thor would love it, though. And, frankly, Steve is a wild card: he'd either want nothing to do with the idea or go all in. Especially if there was a good cause thrown in.
"My second comment is that I've been with you every time you've had sex, whether you have known it or not. So it's not like it will shock me or anything," Cora adds.
The exit leads them to a large outdoor space littered with metal containers. Unfortunately, there’s also a small aircraft hovering in the air, waiting for them. It's locked and loaded, and the firing starts as soon as they get out.
"What?" Tony replies, tail swishing. He hates that nickname, which is why Bucky uses it as much as possible.
Steve is flushed pink, either from the drinks or the dancing, or maybe both, and looks happier and more relaxed than Tony has ever seen him, which is a great look on him. He's always been so serious. They met when Steve was still traumatized from his icy nap, and the man perpetually carries the world on his shoulders no matter what. Steve might now be eleven years older than Tony remembers, closer to being middle-aged than in his twenties, but for once he looks young and carefree.
He's about to ask where the armor to go with it is when the arc reactor moves. No, that's not it—particles are pouring out of it, extending in all directions. Nanites. Can't be anything else. It's also the coolest thing Tony has ever seen.
Does it mean what Steve thinks? That Tony believes Steve caught him having… desires, and he tried to get away from the situation? Because Steve might react badly if he knew? The first part is promising, but the second depressing.
It comes to a head when Cora leaps out of the ledge and takes flight. In momentsTony is perspiring and he shakily pushes back his chair to stumble towards the window.
He guides Tony to a door a few steps away that leads to a small sitting room. As soon as he's out of sight of the murmuring crowd, Tony opens the armor. He sighs in satisfaction once he has direct body contact with Cora, who is shaking in his hold. With Thor's help, Tony sits down hard on a two person sofa, Steve by his side. Steve has a hand planted in the small of Tony's back, and it's immensely comforting.
"I’m always shocked that you can swallow a Whopper in four bites," Tony says, but looks through his bag and grabs his own sandwiches. Steve tries not to look as pleased as he is, especially when Tony takes a bite too (admittedly a much smaller one).
"That they are," Nat says as she joins the others. She's staying further away, and Steve wonders if she doesn't like cats. Maybe she's allergic.
Their flyers—War Machine, Falcon, and Thor—immediately engage the hovering fighter planes. On the ground, everyone else pours out of the caches set up by the Wakandans, which had been shielding their heat signature.
Then it's showtime, as he scoots forward and lines up, guiding his dick with one hand and gently petting Tony's leg, now hooked around his waist, with the other. Tony thought he was ready, and he is because Steve did a thorough job with the prepping, but taking his cock is still a
Steve tries to make him back up towards the table, but Tony grabs his arms and reluctantly breaks the kiss. When they're done, Steve will appreciate a soft surface to rest.
"Not even underwear, huh?" Steve teases, his hands dropping to grab at Tony's now naked ass and pull him close. It feels fantastic, both the kneading and the friction on his cock as he bumps against Steve.
"Will you let me take my gun now?" Tony asks, eyeing it. As much as he hates Hydra, they aren't the biggest threat to him right at this moment.
A couple of moments come to mind, including when Nathalie-Natasha jabbed him in the neck while he was sitting across from Fury in that diner, talking about putting a team of powered individuals together. Tony forcefully stops the cascade of memories by focusing on the present. He doesn't want to slip again, and it seems more prudent.
"What are you?" Tony murmurs. Hydra didn't even shoot once at it with a real gun; they wanted to capture it, not kill it.
By his side, the Maximov girl conjures red energy in her palms, looking in his direction with disgust. Tony's read her story, he knows she lost her parents because of a SI bomb, but it's not the time to get into that now. Carol has seen the threat too, and she hovers above ground, going binary in order to burst into flames and display her powers.
There’s enough morning light for Steve's eyelashes to cast shadows that Tony longs to reach out and gently swipe at with his thumb. His breath catches when Steve's eyelids part to reveal a soft blue gaze that immediately focuses on him. Tony's been caught staring, but he keeps his gaze steady, not trying to hide or pretend otherwise. It's a good thing too because the smile that blooms on Steve's face is beautiful.
"Her call sign is Captain Marvel," Steve says. "Super strength, cosmic energy manipulation that allows her to go binary, which means flight, photon blasts, et cetera. Biggest powerhouse we have for planetary defense, I'd say. When she deigns to come back to Earth, that is."
"I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here," the voice says, then a light comes up in a nearby control room, revealing a dark-haired man. It's the fake doctor that interrogated Bucky in Berlin who Tony saw on the recordings. JARVIS has identified him as Baron Helmut Zemo, from Novi Grad, former Colonel with the Sokovian Armed Forces and commander of EKO Scorpion.
"Hey!" Tony interjected, because someone here had to stand up for Steve and apparently it wasn't going to be Steve. "I think that sounds like a great time, actually."
Tony just grinned wider. "Keeping it in mind, then?" He beamed. "Going to tell me more nice things about my abs?"
Sure, there had been a few naysayers and homophobes, but on the whole, the world seemed to have taken the news of their relationship remarkably well. It had probably helped that everyone was so glad to see superheroes back on Earth again, after Onslaught, after the year on Counter-Earth that even Steve's memories of were already almost all gone. It had helped, too, that when Steve and Tony had finally decided to come out, they'd done it as a coordinated PR campaign. Captain America and Iron Man, longtime Avengers leaders, finally together romantically as well as professionally. They'd made it sound like a natural development -- which, honestly, it had felt like, the night Tony had kissed him for the first time -- and that was how they'd sold it to the press, too.
. And here Steve is the one who asked him out in the first place -- but Iron Man is the one taking him on a date.
Dropping his hand, Tony sucks in a breath and straightens up. "Just so I'm absolutely clear about what's on the table, you're offering to... turn me. You're offering to bite me. You're offering to make me a vampire."
"Steve," Tony says in his ear, his voice cracking with worry, frantic with it, like he thinks for one second that Steve believes any of this bullshit, "he's actually telling the truth. There are old weapons prototypes on that system. But none of them worked right. And they were all dangerous. They were too dangerous to let out, even to the user themselves, or the damage they caused was uncontrollable. And I never sold them, and I stopped working on all of them years ago. I don't-- I don't do that anymore. You have to believe me." There's an audible catch in his breath. His voice is thick.
Ghost's head tips to the side; if it were Tony, Steve would read that as confusion. It's probably still confusion. He's still wary, but his hands slacken on the keyboard. He definitely wasn't expecting Steve to engage with him.
Tony's smile is starting to fade, like he thinks once again that this answer is going to disappoint Steve. Okay, sure, it's not what Steve wanted to hear, no. But it's Steve's job right now to handle Tony's feelings, and if he has to stretch the truth, so be it.
He was, wasn't he? He had to be bluffing. All Steve could think of was the fear that had been in Tony's eyes, after Steve had walked in on him with Tiberius. Steve thought of the way Tony had stuttered through the question, asking Steve what he thought of
The casualty list hit the news just before midnight. Radioactive Man was missing, presumed disintegrated in the explosion. There had been four people in the SSN van, including ViaStone's executive director of programming, a man named Milo Stevens.
It was all in Steve's hands now. Literally. But that felt right, too, more right than anything had in years.
It was almost, but not quite, an open floor plan; the more public areas of the suite -- living room, kitchen, office -- were separated from each other by little walls that ran about half the width of the huge long room, a nice trade-off between demarcating areas and showing off the space. Tony's bedroom and bathroom, however, had solid walls and closed doors between them and the rest of the place.
"I wouldn't ask you if there were any other options," Jan says, her tone laden with apology. "I really do need you." She sighs again. "The thing is, I already sent Warbird, Vision, and the Scarlet Witch off to deal with the Armadillo, an hour ago. And then the Super-Adaptoid showed up at the Bronx Zoo ten minutes later, if you can believe that, so I sent Goliath, She-Hulk, and Triathlon -- and Hank just called me back and told me they needed backup. So I was going to go myself and route the monitors to me in the field, so I didn't have to bug either of you. I was about to leave. But I just got an alert that Ghost has been spotted at Stark Tower, and I don't have anyone else to send except you two, and at any rate I'm pretty sure Iron Man has a vested interest in stopping him anyway."
Steve found himself chuckling. "For all you know, I'm an Iron Man fan. Which I am, actually. Big fan."
Tony had already made his choice, and it was the closet. That overrode anything else Steve could want. There was no use wanting it. He couldn't have it. He shouldn't even think about it. He wasn't going to think about it.
But this afternoon he was looking for comfort, and he ran his finger across the shelf until he found the copy of
hanging out of them, and curses inwardly. He needs to be less stupid. So he doesn't get to come. So what? He can get over it.
in a way he's never wanted anything else in his life. It isn't frightening at all. It feels natural. It feels right. It feels like the easiest thing in the world.
Iron Man twists his fingers together in his lap. "It's hard to explain, and I know you won't believe me, but... people would care, if they found out about this. People would think less of me. I know you wouldn't -- at least, I hope you wouldn't -- but everyone else would. I know they would."
Jan was also off the list, and in this case it was precisely because of the plug. It wasn't that Tony didn't think women could like that sort of thing -- hell, he'd been with more than a few subby women with their own plug collection -- but Jan, as lovely as she was, had shown no signs of being kinky in any direction when they'd been together. Granted, she could definitely afford vibranium chains -- but what was she going to do with them? And the most damning thing -- the fact that definitely excluded her from consideration -- was the simple fact that they'd already been together. She'd broken up with him, just before he'd met Indries and begun his slide back into the bottle. She didn't have a secret crush on him because there would have been no need for it to be secret. Jan was a big girl, and if she'd wanted him back she would have just said so to his face. And she hadn't.
. It wasn't you anymore. It was him. Laughing at me. And I was still there. Still trapped. It was all a dream." His breath rattled. "And it felt exactly the same when I came out of DreamVision the second time."
He turned back. Tony was now wearing the clothes Steve had given him and had stretched out on the bed. The rest of his suit was in a messy pile on the floor. His mouth was a thin, tense line, and he definitely hadn't looked like that a couple minutes ago.
The mysterious visitor didn't knock again, but Tony didn't hear the sound of footsteps in the hallway. They weren't leaving. Curious, Tony leaned toward the peephole, and through the fisheye lens he saw--
Steve reached out and gently ruffled Tony's hair. "It was all good, so, yeah, you do. They agreed that you were one of the best lovers they ever had," he informed him. "They said you were kind and caring. Considerate. Generous. Attentive. You absolutely made sure they had a good time. And honestly, I don't see how that would be different if you're with a man. I don't think it would be different at all. I know
Tony remained silent. He hadn't even talked to the Avengers. It was unlike him, to say nothing. Steve suspected it was probably on the advice of his lawyer.
It was a joke, of course, because they both knew -- some of them with less amnesia than others -- that Steve did what was right and not necessarily what was legal. And here was further proof.
So the doctors get a few papers for medical journals on this strange new curiosity, with Tony's identity neatly redacted, and they check up on him about once a year. They can't do anything for him.
Steve is almost always scrupulously gentle with preparation, both because, well, that's the kind of guy he is, and also because they both know that Steve is, ahem, generously-proportioned. But Tony's not in any mood to wait, and he knows Steve isn't either.
Okay, apparently there had been a lot of Avengers romantic entanglements lately that Steve hadn't been paying attention to while focusing on Tony. That sounded like a mess. But also like a mess where no one involved was imminently getting badly hurt. Unlike Tony.
Tony backs away as fast as he can. "I'm sorry," he manages to say. "I have to go. Urgent. Uh. Restroom. Be back soon."
If that wasn't why Tony was balking at intimacy, if Steve didn't remind him of Tiberius, then why? What was the reason? Was it just too soon? Steve knew he had an unfortunate habit of rushing headlong into romantic relationships. But then, so did Tony, so really, that seemed unlikely to be the reason.
, laughing hard and trying to suppress it, and Steve has no idea why. After several more seconds, Iron Man's breath catches. His eyes are wide, and he looks over at the half-empty pizza box, lying open on the counter. "Is this about the pizza? I know I didn't tip the guy in cash, but I'm not that stingy, I promise. I tipped on the card when I ordered. Liberally. Handsomely, even. Trust me, Cap, I gave him more than enough money."
And Tony was still talking. "He also had a few convincing arguments that you didn't have. Things you didn't know. I have no idea if you're still listening. Probably not." He sighed once more, even more heavily. A car honked somewhere in the background. Was he driving? "But I'll pretend you are, so I'll start from the beginning. You know how the news has been trying to paint Donahue and me as rivals? I don't know if you read any of those articles. Those were all lies. Well, sort of. The rivalry wasn't Donahue versus me. The rivalry was Donahue and Ty's father... versus my father. Yeah."
Jan waves her free hand. "You should ask Tony," she says. The intimacy of the name is notable; she's the only one of them who knows Mr. Stark well enough to use it, the only one of them who would presume to call him
, exactly -- Tony wasn't sure when any of the team was ever going to look completely happy again -- but he did look a damn sight less miserable. Tony would take it.
At first, the gossip and speculation had stayed confined to Whiplash's death. Tony's supposed rivalry with Trevor Donahue made the cover of one of the weekly news magazines. Steve didn't bother reading it.
"--and I was lying to myself, too. I told myself it was never going to happen again, and if it never happened again that meant it was all history, that meant it was nobody else's business, and that meant I didn't have to tell anyone. I told myself I had it under control." His mouth went crooked. "But I think we both know I'm not great at self-control, don't we?"
The voice on the other side of the door definitely belongs to Iron Man, but even with the vocal filters, Steve can tell there's something
It's ridiculous, of course -- he hasn't asked Iron Man out yet. He doesn't even know what Iron Man would say. And none of this would oblige Steve to go steady with either of them. But somehow it feels disloyal. And unfair, to get Mr. Stark's hopes up when Steve's heart is elsewhere. Oh, Mr. Stark would be a great date -- the internet has also assured him of this,
"Allow me to doubt that. I'm getting you checked out."  Tony’s voice is firm and a little annoyed.  This isn’t funny!
Tony's fangs are completely out and he drags the sharp point of one over the artery. Hell, he wants this so much that Tony has to be careful not to drool all over Steve's neck.
He's scanned Carol—who is the weapon, Nama is perfectly aware his gizmo is useless—and now it's Tony's turn. Unsurprisingly, the little device beeps over Tony's chest. Knowing it was coming, Tony had already been unzipping his top to show the reactor's casing to the hairy bouncer when the detector beeped.
"We can't have that, can we?" Steve murmurs before gently leaning down for a kiss that has no right feeling so good. It makes Tony wish for it to be the last first kiss of his life.
"No way, show me," Jim says, grabbing the phone from her hands even though Nat was still recording. She allows Rhodes to do things that she'd maim most people for, and Steve sometimes wonders if there's something between them. "Holy shit! She did jump right in!"
"Oh, me too," Tony says. Now that it's leaving his system, he's parched. Hopefully dehydration isn’t looming in his future. "I'm looking for water, if possible."
. But then a miracle happens: Rhodes elbows Tony, which makes him come back to his senses and positively beam with happiness.
"Oh, definitely." It thrills Tony to put his hands on Steve's fantastic chest and have his waist circled by powerful arms in return. "Someone I won't name told me that I'm so smitten it's painful to watch, and I can only agree."
They wordlessly all decide to follow, and Peter grabs the now empty pan and mugs. Steve is last in line to reach the house after Tony, who stops at the door, letting it close behind Peter. Before Steve can ask if there's something wrong, Tony has turned to face him and Steve finds himself lost for words at the affection in his eyes. When Tony grabs the ends of Steve's blue scarf to pull him down, he inexorably follows the movement until their lips meet, powerless to resist. And why would he? It's everything Steve wants, and a burst of joy that feels like fireworks goes off in his chest while his ears are ringing with their metaphorical explosions.
T'Challa perks up and seems ready to sprint away, but Rhodey lifts his gauntlet, asking him to stay. There's a tense pause, and Tony wonders if their reunion will end up in an actual fist fight after all. But, without looking away from Tony, Steve puts a hand to his comm link.
"The Guardians are Nebula’s group. They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy. Not Nebula’s idea," Carol says, anticipating his questions. "Their leader, Peter Quill is originally from Earth, and Gamora, Nebula’s sister, was part of the gang too. Thanos killed her to get a stone, and it's still a very sore subject, so it’d be best not to mention her in front of Nebula."
"I can imagine," Tony says with a wince. The horror of being used as a weapon is hard to understand. "Look, I feel bad for him, I do. But I'm not sure I'll be able to face him, not until I can wrap my head around this."
Steve fetches his half-empty bottle of whiskey in the same cupboard under which the bullet rolled earlier and hopes that Tony understands it's as an olive branch. That Steve is trying not to judge, assuming Tony noticed that Steve's testiness was because of his drinking. When he grabs two glasses and raises them in question, he's surprised when Tony shakes his head no.
"Yes, Rhodes, of course," Steve says, looking earnest. "I'm sorry I didn't take more time to explain."
One night, before bed, while Steve goes through his text messages, he realizes that he's talked to Tony three times that day.
Rhodey nods. "Yeah, of course. Thanks, man. But before you agree, read the damn Accords. It's not that I don't understand why it's not ideal—"
"It's fine, leave the shield," Tony says. They seem to have avoided a direct confrontation, but it doesn't mean their respective problems have disappeared. "What was that about, about five other super soldiers and a shrink?"
With whiskey now coursing through his veins, Steve is finding it harder and harder to resist leaning just a little forward, to get closer. He already stretched a leg below the table and didn't move his foot when Tony bumped into it. Not that Tony broke that contact either, if he even noticed it happened, and Steve's enjoying the connection. But being tipsy on his way to drunk also makes Steve bolder, and when Tony looks up and finds him staring, Steve doesn't look away.
"Yeah! It's not the end of the evening I hoped for, but that's life for you," he says with a mock pout, clearly taking it in stride.
"Got it, Boss." A virtual window pops up ten feet away, closer to DUM-E's charging station, and the robot immediately rolls towards it, chirping. "Yes, I can display the data points that I am monitoring," FRIDAY adds. A few graphs and numbers pop up, that Steve supposes are temperature, heartbeats and respiration.
Tony squeezes Steve tightly and lets himself relax into the comfort of their embrace. It feels so good. He remembers Natasha Stark's vows: your heart is my home and your arms my shelter, and it resonates as exactly right.
Tony has rarely felt so energized, thrumming with power as he straightens up. He happily takes in how relaxed Steve is, eyes glazed over as he pants for breath. His blond hair is sticking up every which way, his lips bruised from the earlier kissing, and the four dots on his neck make something proprietary flare in Tony's gut.
And to think Tony believed he'd gotten close to Steve. He had it all wrong. All the nice things Steve said, they were said out of pity for him and because he feels guilty for the lies. Okay, sure, maybe he has a bit of a crush: Steve kissed him back earlier with enthusiasm, after all. But they were never best friends. Tony feels so stupid.
"Uh-huh. We had a time-space GPS, so to speak. So the plan was to travel back in time to known past locations of the stones, grab them, and use the stones ourselves to bring back everyone and everything lost in the Decimation."
Later, Tony finds both Carol and Steve in the cockpit. Since the ship is cruising towards their destination on autopilot, they’re both busy on their tablets, but they look up when Tony enters.
Steve winces. "Of course not. I'm sorry for scaring you. You weren't supposed to see me, I wasn't careful enough."
"Tony, are you okay?" Steve's blue eyes are wide and worried as he reaches for the side of the helmet.
"Hello, FRIDAY," Steve says. He takes a step forward as the line for the cash register moves. "I'm at the Burger King close to the Tower and I was wondering if Tony ate lunch yet."
The statement rubs Steve the wrong way. Of course he'd adopt one if Tony wanted to keep only half of the pair. He'd protest out loud, but then Rhodes adds: "He wouldn't have a ready excuse to go to the Tower anymore."
The name almost awakens something in Anthony's memory, but not enough to render a picture. The title of Captain causes his heart to flip as well, but it's just a rank; it shouldn't do that.
"Come on babe," Tony says, undoing his earlier steps. "Let's go check the control room and see if Zemo brought anything. I'll prod the consoles too." He didn't even think to grab Zemo's phone.
"Finally!" Nat says as it connects. She sounds exasperated, and Steve knows there will be hell to pay for dodging her for the last hour. Irresponsible, maybe, but he knew this was coming, and he wanted at a few precious last minutes with the kittens. And Tony.
She is indeed and collides against Tony's chest plate a second later. He curls an arm around her so she stays close and buries his nose in the soft feathers of her neck. The relief is immediate and immense, pain giving way to warmth.
Tony doesn't mind at all. He's safe now, and he's certain Steve will succeed. He can't believe Victor caught him unprepared like an amateur. Tony walked right into Victor's trap, disguised in a request for a formal non-aggression treaty. Underhanded, and Tony will make ensure the story is heard all over the world and ruins the little reputation Victor Von Doom still has left.
"It's not my place to set your purpose." Yon-Rogg looks like he can't quite control his expression, as if he badly wants it to be Anthony's purpose. "The Supreme Intelligence knows all."
"As I said, it's complicated. Thor killed Thanos when we found him again, but Thanos destroyed the stones before we got there. It took us several years to come up with a plan, but basically we went back in time and picked up the six stones before him."
"Nah, don’t worry about it. I switched on the armor's air filters before it could hurt me, and it was but an inconvenience. You know me, I'm invincible," Tony says with a wink. "Frankly, I was more hurt by that nose Loki gave the armor." That last bit makes Tony shudder, which makes Steve smile.
"Yes." Steve's blood is pumping again at the mere suggestion of fucking Tony, even though he's too fresh from his orgasm to get hard. It won't take long. "I want that too, I want you," he says, happy when Tony smiles.
"I love babies. Any age, really, it's so cool when they start to learn things, too." Of course Tony would be excited about that. Heck, he makes robots and programs that are almost his own children, just to see them evolve.
"I can give you a long list of people who genuinely believe I'm nothing but a nuisance, including Colonel Phillips."
"No alien invasion, if that's what you're asking," Rhodey says. "But JARVIS and I continued to deploy the Iron Legion. Lots of fights to dig up Hydra, which makes even more sense if you tell me Cap knew about Barnes for the last two years."
There are sounds behind him now; the beast is running too. It makes Tony speed up, and finally at last he emerges in the clearing, hands in the air, his right still clutching his pistol. The soldiers are training their rifles on him, but Tony expected it, barging in like this.
"I had my eyes opened." Memory-Tony stands up and moves behind the podium. He has an arm in a sling, and it is clear he was roughed up recently. "I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International—" the journalists stand up, shouting questions all over each other, flashes going off. A tall bald man in a gray suit and yellow tie grabs Memory-Tony's shoulders, as if to calm things down, then pushes him away from the stage as he continues to talk, "—until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be. What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well."
"I know, right?" Such a pretty little girl. Tony's never seen any cuter, though he is admittedly biased.
"Is it me not knowing either the game or this whole numeral system that clued you in?" Tony raises an eyebrow.
"That didn't come out right. I love touching you, Cora," Steve amends, then turns to Tony. "And I certainly don't mind when you touch Lilly. I enjoy that a lot. I'm pretty sure it's because I've liked you for a while. As more than a friend."
Steve studies Zemo for a few seconds, and his next words are almost sympathetic. "You lost someone?"
Steve hums. "I'm not sure. Is it a good idea to separate the sisters?" he asks, before looking straight at Tony, who is watching him closely. Steve girds his loins and adds, "I'd love to have Callie, but then I wouldn't have an excuse to come see you at the Tower as often."
There are soft, barely discernible footsteps near Steve, and someone sits down in the lounge chair to his right. There are definitely several ice cubes in a glass, too.
But now it's showtime, and they've always worked well together, even when they butted heads at the start of the Avengers. No matter what happens, Tony trusts Steve to have his back in a fight.
"Well, thank you if I haven't said." Tony wants to squirm from all of that praise, especially coming from Steve. He’s longed to get his approval since they met… hell, probably since his childhood, thanks to Howard.
"We could explain. Say it's a misunderstanding due to poor daemon handling on our part," Tony says, getting out of the armor.
The suit that looked so normal a second ago, once finished forming, immediately changes. It's closer to the body, more streamlined. What Tony can see on the hub shows that it's advanced beyond his wildest dreams. FRIDAY is showing him steadicam footage of what must be a lab test, where Tony's morphing the armor continuously. One moment it looks like Veronica, then has big flight stabilizers, only to change to hovering cannons separate from the main suit, and so on. It's mesmerizing. It's also a lot of info for his recuperating brain, and health vitals pop up about his blood pressure. The video immediately stops.
"You have to understand that I convinced myself I was doing the right thing. That I was sparing you some pain," he says softly.
"Yes, yes, me too, so much." Steve bites and sucks on the side of Tony's neck, surely leaving a mark. "I'm right there too, just let—let me—"
The thought is there and then gone when Tony remembers that no, Pepper won't care because they broke up. Maybe it's the exhaustion, but he forgot for a second.
Stone definitely seemed like he was trying to win the handshake, a competition that Steve had always detested, and not just because he was strong enough now that it was unfair for him to play. Steve let him win, and he let go. Stone's smile was broader.
"Never," Tony said, fervently, the word falling from his lips without his conscious volition. No other words came to mind except the obvious. "You're-- you're perfect."
He's at Tony's feet now. He wraps his arms around Tony's legs, abased, a suppliant. "Keep me," he begs, and he doesn't know if he's still down or if he's coming up wrong but all he knows is that he never wants to go back to the darkness. "Keep me here, please, Tony, please. Keep me safe. I'll do whatever you want. Anything you want. I'm yours. Anything."
"There you go," Tony said, with another smile. He pointed with the spatula at the glass of juice that was at his own place at the table. "Have the orange juice. Go on. I haven't touched it."
"You can't sleep either, huh? Do you mind if I--" Tony asked, gesturing somewhere next to where he was standing, and he didn't wait for a response before flipping the bedroom light on.
"Hey, Shellhead?" Steve offers, as gently as he can, because he doesn't know what else to do except be kind, and hope that's what Iron Man needs from him. "You want to come in? Door's always open for you."
Jan had taken it upon herself to show Steve how to use a computer, that first week; Mr. Stark had unexpectedly come in halfway through the lesson, and Steve had tried not to be distracted by the presence of his extremely handsome landlord. He saw Mr. Stark so rarely that every time Steve was tongue-tied and nearly struck dumb once again by his matinee-idol looks. But this was an important lesson, something he was going to need to know about the future, and he wasn't going to let his attention wander.
"Back to the topic at hand, then," Steve said, and Jan gave him an encouraging smile. "But, first, is there something I should know about Wanda and... the rest of them?"
"Say," Tony added. "While we've got you here, would you consider letting us in on what your ultimate goal here is? Did you just want to ruin Christmas?"
The Vishanti wouldn't have made him the Sorcerer Supreme if he were actually stupid, and Tony knows Stephen isn't, but he's too frustrated to get all the words out. Tony hisses. He wants to punch something. He's so tired. They're all so tired.
But Steve just grinned and stretched lazily. "Want me to go get it? You can make your own personal Captain America poster."
He lets his hand settle on Tony's upper arm; Tony exhales in a long shudder and his eyes fall half-shut, heavy-lidded with pleasure. He's smiling. Steve wants to paint him.
The ice of Mr. Stark's regard has melted, and there's something lonely in his eyes now, something sad and bitter and alone, and Steve has no idea why Mr. Stark is doing this. He has no idea why Mr. Stark feels like this. He doesn't understand what's going on.
Tony had liked it that much? Well, that'd be a first. "Not a put-on," Steve said. "It's all me. Everything I think just comes right out of my mouth when I'm in bed." He grimaced. "Not one of my more popular traits. Rachel told me once that I'd never be able to fuck someone hard enough that they'd forget their own name because I'd be reminding them of it every ten seconds."
"Glad you could make it," Iron Man calls back, without turning around. "Go on, have a seat on the couch. Make yourself at home. I'll be there in a second." He coughs. "Unless you were hoping for someone else?"
Tony narrates his actions to himself as he goes, in the hopes that doing so will provide some sort of justification. This was necessary. All this was necessary. One day, Steve will understand why this was necessary. Steve will forgive him. It had to be this way.
He wasn't going to be like the others. He was going to be worthy of Tony's trust. And he wasn't ever going to take advantage of him.
Steve's brother died in 1972. The last time Steve saw him was 1945. He'd woken up and Doug was already dead. He'll never see him again.
by Tony Stark's standards means that the bill was nearing four figures, which was a total they'd achieved without ordering drinks. But not only did Steve pay for it all, he didn't even let Tony see a menu with prices on it. And from the way Tony was smoldering at him from across the table, he's pretty damn sure Tony enjoyed that. Though he'll never say it in so many words, Tony really likes being taken care of. And Steve -- well, Steve really likes taking care of Tony, so it all works out nicely.
"Anyway," Iron Man says. "Much as I wish I could stay, it's past my bedtime. Have to leave before I turn into a pumpkin, and all."
The two of them have eighteen hours of leave remaining and Steve intends to make the absolute most of it.
So Steve hasn't asked Iron Man, and he wouldn't dare ask Mr. Stark. Iron Man clearly must feel that Mr. Stark's safety is important enough to him that it's worth protecting him personally. That's an attitude Steve can respect. He definitely understands and approves of the impulse to do good in the world; it's why they're superheroes, after all. He just wishes he had more time with Iron Man.
Tony obligingly wrinkled his nose, the way he'd been meant to, and Steve was glad to see it. Tony was trying. And that had to mean something.
The feel of Tony's cock in his mouth sated a longing that he hadn't even known he had. Not like this. He'd known for a long time that -- to put it crudely -- he'd wanted to be fucked. He'd known what it was to want that, to see a man and ache to have him inside him. He'd tried toys, by himself, never brave enough to ask it of a girlfriend. And that had worked just enough to take the edge off, but never to fill the need. Here, though -- here was a need akin to that one, but finally met. He felt
He doesn't know what he's expecting, and at first he doesn't even understand what's going on. He hears the faint tapping of metal against metal, then a heavier clunking sound, then a hiss of air, like a valve releasing. Metal scrapes again. He hopes something's not wrong with Iron Man.
Steve was trying very hard not to jump to conclusions, but there weren't a whole lot of reasons for Tony's clothes to be on the floor, and given Tony's attitude in the voicemail he'd left, it didn't seem likely to have been a voluntary act on his part. The implications of that were something that Steve really, really did not want to contemplate.
Tony's fingers skimmed the waistband of Steve's briefs, and Steve shuddered in anticipation, but he wasn't expecting Tony to instead put his lips to Steve's cock right then and there, mouthing the head of his cock through the fabric, dampening the cloth, molding it to Steve's body the way he molded armor. The heat of his breath, the pressure of his lips -- it was all exactly right, exactly what he needed. Except, of course, that now he wanted more.
"Or I could keep you warm right now," Steve offered. "Even better than just thinking about it. So I hear."
He said it like he wasn't sure what Tony would think, which was ridiculous because Tony thought that sounded like the most appealing thing in the entire world. "Mmm," he said, tapping the crop against his hand. "I'll keep that in mind. Ready for a flogger now?"
He reaches out, his fingers trembling, and he brushes the metal of Iron Man's gauntlet, his own gloved fingertips sliding along the grooved striations, red leather on red metal. He knows Iron Man can't feel it, but Iron Man is looking down at their joined hands, in awe. That's exactly how Steve feels about it.
Mr. Stark reaches into the cabinet, extracts Steve's mug, and pours the coffee. When he hands it to Steve, their fingers brush.
"Zero," Steve said, confidently, though he was starting to blush, which was a little weird. "Because Thor loaned you his cape before the paramedics showed up. And it was, um. I thought it was very nice underwear."
Tony was staring off into the distance. "I was nineteen when I met Sunset Bain," he said, lost in the memory. "It was my last year at MIT. We were at a regatta together, and we got to talking. She was a few years older than I was, and I was flattered by her attention. More than I should have been. I was so young, and I was so, so stupid." He laughed. "I didn't even figure out anything was wrong when she asked me not to tell my father we were seeing each other. I just thought it made sense. The first girl I ever fell in love with, Meredith McCall -- she was the daughter of one of my father's business rivals. He forbade me to see her. And I was worried he'd say the same thing about Sunset. He would have." Tony frowned; there was something else in Tony's eyes now, and it wasn't good at all. "I still don't think he was right about Meredith. He would have been absolutely right about Sunset." He still wasn't looking at Steve.
"My pleasure," Tony said, and then he regarded the last plate and the amount of pizza left, as he passed the empty plate to Thor. "Thor, buddy, you can just load that on up. Try to leave a few slices for the rest of us." He'd never been great at estimating Thor's appetite. He'd always let Jarvis worry about-- God, no, he couldn't think about Jarvis like that, in the past tense. Jarvis was going to be fine.
, Steve promises Tony in his thoughts, since he can't say it aloud. Just one more minute to take care of this, and then he can take care of Tony the whole rest of the night. It's all going to be okay.
"It is kind of funny," Sam says. Snowball has wiggled away and now wants to examine the pool. Tony gives the end of the leash to Wanda, who grins at him in thanks.
"I think this is going well," Carol says, sprawling back with her arms extended on the top of the booth like a queen holding court. There’s a smirk on her face, spelling out that she's looking for someone to challenge her.
Tony's lucky that it was Steve holding vigil because waking up as an amnesiac on an alien planet without an arc reactor and surrounded by only strangers would have been terrifying. A shiver of unease travels down his spine just thinking about it.
"Understood. I'll be careful," Tony says, hyper-focused. The black kitten latches onto the nipple as fiercely as her sister did, which makes him grin. "There you go, baby!"
Steve also often lets his actions speak for themselves. He takes one step forward, then a second when Tony doesn't evade his approach, which brings him inches away. Tony is shorter than Steve and has to tip his head slightly up so they can keep eye contact. Steve's always loved his dark eyes and right now they are smoldering. Anticipation is crackling between them.
Tony and Carol fire several shots at the Krees as they back towards the emergency exit. Now that she isn’t holding back her power, the photon blasts erupt from Carol's hands.
"Yes," Tony says, approaching carefully in a way that is belittled by the clanking of the Iron Man boots on the floor. "Restaurants or picnics dates are nice, but too often crashed by fans or paparazzi. I'd like something quiet for a first date."
"If there's any mention of the Guardians, let's pretend we don't know them much," Steve says. "Likewise Nebula will stay on the Blaze, out of sight."
"I'm Carol," she says as they go to the elevator and Tony presses the button to the common floor. "Nice digs. Top floors?"
"No, I'm fine. We can go back, but thanks for the breather." He appreciates that he only briefly freaked out in front of everyone.
His coffee is ready now, and he takes a well-needed gulp that lets him hide his face a bit. He feels as if he's blushing and it's embarrassing.
"In real life? Yes, absolutely. You're a control freak. But sometimes very commanding people want a break, where they relinquish that authority to someone else. To clear their mind, because they don't have to think anymore. I believe you'd like that a lot."
"Yeah." Steve leans in to look at him in the eyes, serious. "Could you please, please stop? I can't take it anymore."
The low blow, that Steve hid this huge thing from him to protect his friend, hurts in an unexpected way. It's different from the grief; it ignites a blaze in Tony's chest that makes him jump out of bed and pace, furious. Fuck.
"Oh God, yes," Steve says, starting to pull out and push in, giving into his need. Tony is all in favor as it feels amazing.
Steve huffs, amused but also clearly fond. "Yeah. I just wanted you to know. I'll let you think about it, and maybe, if you want, we could go out sometime." No pressure, totally Tony's choice if he ever wishes to take the chance. Steve steps back as if he's going to leave.
Tony is so thirsty, he doesn't care. He leans forward and starts licking the water on Steve's finger. Not the way he thought he'd put his tongue on the man for the first time, but he's thankful nonetheless. There isn't a lot to lap up, just a couple of drops, so Steve wets his fingers every few seconds.
It had chilled Steve to the core. No joke or teasing, his first name, and a heartfelt cry for assistance? It sounded very serious.
"Yeah?" He won't say it out loud, but he's honestly terrified of fucking it up. He didn't have the best role model. "I wonder where I got that from."
Steve is handsome as always in his Captain America uniform, and Tony chose his latest armor for the trip, though he's keeping the helmet retracted for the moment. It seemed appropriate to suit up, since he'll be introduced as Iron Man to the Asgardian court. He has nice clothes underneath if the armor gets too cumbersome.
To Tony's horror, Steve is close to tears, distressed. Tony doesn’t want anyone to look at him like that and definitely not when he's just kissed them. Especially not Steve. Tony's stomach drops. Clearly the break in the texting is because of something huge. But Steve said they’re good now; he doesn't understand.
"Fine." She huffs, then immediately perks up. "Hey, Lilly, I have an idea! Why don't you hop on my back?"
"Let's go to your room." It means moving, and a delay, but Steve's protest dies on his lips when Tony purrs, "come on, I want to take good care of you. You won't wish to move when I'm done."
Tony bends down to first nose at the delicate skin of Steve's throat. He stops to take a deep breath, marveling at how there isn't even a whiff of fear in Steve's scent, only arousal and his intoxicating base smell. Even though time is of the essence, Tony can't bring himself to rush it and licks over Steve's carotid, enjoying how he pushes into it and squeezes Tony's arms. He cuts off a groan, which is a shame.
"Okay, I gotcha," WIM-Tony says as he pulls Other-Steve to his feet and gives him a friendly shoulder pat before stepping back.
