If anyone's wondering why I know so much about valium, it's because I have a horrible fear of needles and the only way I can get shots/IV's put in is to put me on valium. That way I'll only scream. I'll be too weak to fight back. Yeah, though, this is what basically being on valium is like. You're really tired and confused, but you'll also accept anything anyone tells you anywhere. Basically, it's like being on the Internet at three AM.
"There it is!" Tony pointed to a lot across the street. There were several limousines parked there, all of them indistinguishable to each other. Steve questioned how Tony could possibly know which one theirs was and that one-second distraction was all that was needed for mayhem to strike. Tony started to step out into the street, directly into the path of oncoming traffic.
It was silent for a while, something unusual for both girls. Nina could barely taste the tea or the breakfast pastry as she swallowed bite and sip after bite and sip. Eventually, Oswin's voice cut like a knife through the tension.
"Yes," she admitted. "Though it wasn't my intent to trick you. I just want you to feel safe discussing your emotions with me."
"No, you've got to work for it." Lara brought the ball down closer to Lucky, and he immediately sprang into action, trying to knock the ball out or her hand. However, he was not quick enough. Lara lifted the ball out of his reach again, causing Lucky to whine and resume his stance begging for Lara to drop it. "No, you aren't going to go anywhere in life if you don't work for it, so work for it."
"Not exactly," Stark said. "After we shower, we're going to have to wait for the CDC to make their assessment. They're probably going to quarantine us, too, since we were likely exposed."
"So you take the world I love as a recompense for your imagined slights?" Thor questioned. "No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki." Loki laughed in response.
"And we're going to give him lots of love because of that," Laura said. "He's a very lucky boy adopted into this family." Cooper's face lit right up.
"I can't say for certain," Romanoff said. "I'd need more time and resources than what I can do here and now on my phone." She pressed the lock button and slid her phone back into whatever mysterious place she produced it from. "However, just a cursory search online brought up several red flags. The group is work looking into, even if they mean no harm to us, personally. I'll tell S.H.I.E.L.D. and start doing some research myself soon as we get back." Steve nodded in agreement.
Ohohoho, do I have a lot of feelings about this topic. Honestly, I'm pretty happy with this chapter as it gave me a creative means to vent. I don't like the TV show Intervention. There are a lot of obvious reasons; it profits off of people's addictions and mental illnesses; it emphasizes the drama and doesn't do much to use the platform to educate the masses about addiction; etc. My biggest problem with it is that it's entire premise hinges on the idea that interventions are helpful when the truth of the matter is that there is little evidence to support that. To quote Joel L. Young, MD writing for Psychology Today, "there's little data on the effectiveness of interventions, perhaps because effectiveness is difficult to define. Addicts are more likely to seek treatment when they undergo an intervention, but interventions don't affect the outcome of the treatment itself. If an addict seeks treatment without being fully committed to a life of sobriety - as some might to in response to the overwhelming peer pressure of an intervention - he or she may be less likely to get better."
Steve looked good; damn good. The new uniform suited him well, fitting like a glove and highlighting all of Steve's best assets. Tony probably stared for a little too long and let his mind wander to dirty places he shouldn't have, given the situation. Despite this, he also managed to notice that S.H.I.E.L.D. had given him his proper shield back. Good. Vibranium was hard to come by and it had already been proven that anything else wouldn't be strong enough for him after he tried to use that replica the last time they fought together.
"What the hell?" she muttered to herself. "You'd think Tony would have the place wired up with nuclear sirens."
"Enough," he screamed as he surged to his feet. "You are, all of you, beneath me! I am a God, you dull creature and I will not be bullied by…" Getting grabbed by the legs and smashed back and forth into the floor with an amount of force that probably should have killed him cut that sentence short. When it was over, Loki was paralyzed – he wasn't sure if it was fear or injury, but still paralyzed. His eyes remained glued to the ceiling as the Hulk walked away.
"I'm not okay," she admitted. "But I just need to get over it." As if to exemplify that, Lara straightened her posture to make herself seem more composed. Brushing a strand of hair out of her face, she quickly changed the subject. "So, how did the meeting go?"
"Not yet," Fury then turned towards Tony and gestured over to the woman standing in front of them. "Tony Stark, Commander Maria Hill. Commander Hill, Tony Stark."
Eventually, the anchor was able to disclose the address – 925 W. 50th Street – which confirmed to Lara that it wasn't anywhere too nearby. With the discovery of the address came images of the building prior to the explosion – most likely found online. Lara was initially alarmed to find that the building was a school, but the closed captions assured that the building was condemned, and it was unlikely any children were inside or anywhere within the blast radius. That didn't guarantee anything, but it did offer sufficient reassurance. A few more recent photos came up, showing boarded up windows and doors, which added to that reassurance. Then the most recent photos came up, and that's what caught Lara's attention.
"Yes." Steve could feel himself starting to smile as well. "I was just calling to let you know I'm alright."
) but at that point they told him to sit down before they called security. Not needing to be banned from yet another hospital, Tony complied.
"Yeah," Rhodey said. "I know it's a sedative and he really shouldn't have mixed it with alcohol, but we just need…"
"What if this is real?" she asked abruptly. "What if the test comes back positive? What if this time, you really do die?"
Tony turned back to what he was doing on the screen. He was still going over that surveillance tape, but he was much closer now to see exactly what had happened that he was that morning. It was extremely tedious, but after rewinding and playing it repeatedly a thousand times, he could now see what looked like a female figure breaking into the locker and leaving the lab with all the chemical components on a cart. He had yet to get a clear shot of her face, but once he did…
Carol tried insisting yet again that she was fine to stand on her own and take off her clothes herself, but again the nurses didn't want to risk irritating any potential internal injuries, so she had to remain strapped down while they cut off what remained of her clothes. It was degrading, but at least they did it in relative privacy, the nurse who did it was another woman, and she was quickly covered with a johnny. After that, she was wheeled to another part of the hospital where they kept the MRI and X-ray machines.
"It's a code that's programmed into all electronic locks when they're still on the factory floor," Knežević explained. "It's supposed to reset the electronic components into an unlocked, disarmed state. That way if something goes wrong and the lock seizes up while they're still putting it together, they can reset it and fix the problem. Usually, they program the override code out before letting the locks ship out commercially, but sometimes either through oversight or negligence, a lock ships out with the override code still programmed in. However, that's rare. We really lucked out. Seriously, that only had a two-percent chance of working."
Gathering up all the wrappings and tags, Carol threw them in the white bag, along with her previous set of underwear. There was no way she'd be able to wear them again, so she was better off throwing them out as well. Collecting the johnny off the floor, Carol draped it over her arm before crumpling the bag into the tightest ball she could. She then left the stall, tossing the bag in the trash on her way out of the bathroom.
He'd been like that since the CDC had taken Stark away. At first, the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors hand tried to reassure him and get him to sit down, but it was futile. He was too full of anxious energy and probably would be until the CDC confirmed it was just nothing.
"Gee," Clint said between hacks. "I didn't realize that. Thanks for the helpful advice." Natasha rolled her eyes before her attention was taken away by the other end of the line picking up.
Tony started to rapidly flip through pages. He planned on reading the whole thing in-depth as soon as he got the chance to, but for right now he just wanted to skim and get a general idea of what to expect. The packet was much thicker than the "fake" one. Tony was not sure whether to take that as a good or bad thing. However, thus far in the skim-through, he had yet to see the words "narcissist" or "compulsive behavior" anywhere, so that was promising. Feeling the least bit reassured, he set the packet to the side and took a spoonful of yogurt on the bowl.
"You've got to be kidding me." Oswin's eyes were heavy with exhaustion and tears were spilling over from the emotional stress of the past twenty-four hours. However, she could clearly see that where Knežević had led her was to a box on the side of the southbound lane of the Pacific Coast Highway on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. He really wasn't kidding when he said all he had to his name was a box. The box was clearly too small to house
Sighing, Lara set off to make herself a sandwich. She didn't do anything too overboard; just bread, Balgonie, cheese, and mayo. After thoroughly spreading the mayo on her sandwich, she went to toss the knife she was using into the sink and caught sight of a bright flash of red stuffed between the edge of the sink and the microwave. At first, she dismissed it as being a dishrag which would have made sense, however, none of the dishrags that they owned were red and this one was sparkly. Letting curiosity get the better of her, Lara gave in and picked up the piece of fabric.
"Why not?" she said. "With any luck it could have fermented by now." She walked over to one of the chairs across from his desk and sat down. Stark, meanwhile, produced two shot glasses from the cabinet (apparently Pepper did not think to take those away,) set them down on his desk, and poured apple juice into each one.
Tony shut his door and locked it behind him. He knew Howard was going to be angry with him for storming out of the party and would probably be at his door once it was over, and he just didn't want to deal with a headache that argument would bring. Sighing, he contemplated what to do next.
Tony pulled back and allowed Steve to lift him into his arms bridal style. Making sure he had his arms securely around Steve's neck, Tony allowed himself to relax and rest his head on Steve's shoulder as he carried him out of the bathroom and over to their bed. It was a relatively short walk seeing as their bed was only about six feet from the bathroom, but Tony enjoyed it, nonetheless.
"I was communicating with the Supreme Understanding," Adoniram said. "I do not need to defend myself to you."
Oh, and if anyone gets the reference with the little girl named Sarah who loves Thor, you're awesome and it's clear that we have the same love of 1980s comedies. In case I forget to mention it (because it's several fics away and I have a very short-term memory) after my Thor: The Dark World re-write and Thor meets back up with the Avengers, he actually wears the bracelet that little girl made him! Feel free to "aww" at the idea of that!
"Like I said, there was something in her voice," Natasha explained. "But also, some of the things she said didn't quite add up. Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. didn't start up until Thor came through town, yet she's saying she was there all the way back in the '90s." Tony furrowed his brow. Having read through the files before the whole Loki situation, he knew that this was in fact the case. So, he had to admit that was odd.
Anyways, I really hope you enjoyed this chapter and the story as a whole. Also, I'm sorry in advance. You'll see what I mean.
When he got home that night, he popped the tape into the VHS player in the living room and went to set about starting dinner in the attached kitchen. For the first minute and fifty seconds, the recording was nothing but snow. Thinking that the tape might be broken, Rhodey rolled his eyes. He finished punching in the time code on the microwave and walked back over to the TV.
Sorry for the short chapter and the fact that it centered on OCs! It can't really be helped, but most of the chapters that I've written so far after this center on at least one of the Avengers, so hopefully that'll make it up to you guys!
"…Can't sit here and tell me that this was an honest mistake. The interview, I can believe, but Stark has yet to explain how someone can get past his 'state-of-the-art' security systems and an entire staff of trained security guards without anyone noticing. Hell, they even managed to get access to our security codes…"
"No," Steve said. "I think I like it? It's just… Very different. A lot of things are. Something I just have to get used to."
"I can," Tony defended. "When they're not forcibly taken from me." Natasha raised an eyebrow at that, and Steve gave Tony a concerned look. "It's fine," he mumbled, eyes fixed on the ground. Steve hesitantly put a hand on his shoulder.
"And I'll be back in a minute." Tony assured. "It's just downstairs and besides, we can't expect her to carry everything by herself."
"They targeted Congress and the media," Tony pointed out. "You – a no-name Secret Service agent who protected low-level diplomats – would have been safe."
"JARVIS, can you turn out the lights?" Almost as soon as the lights went out, Steve could hear Tony's soft breathing, indicating that he was asleep.
S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn't looking for a confession. They had more than enough evidence to nail Sharpton no matter how she plead. They wanted to know if there was any way to fix what had been done. Obviously, there was no cure for Ebola. You could only give the infected person an IV, put them on a ventilator, and monitor their blood pressure. The rest was up to how their body responded to the treatment. However, there was a chance that Sharpton had an ace up her sleeve; something that could undo the anti-biotic resistant aspects of the virus' modifications and allow them to be able to treat Clint better. It was a longshot, but if there was any chance of saving him, Natasha would take it.
"Mission report." His tone was spiked with the tiniest bit of annoyance at the slight. "How is the infiltration plan proceeding?"
Pepper was the first one to return to the room, none too pleased with having to find out from his former insurance provider that his policy was canceled. It was just as fun as Tony imagined. Technically, it wasn't really a secret, Tony just plain forgot to tell her. It didn't matter, though. Pepper was still angry.
The feeling of fire flowing through his brain quickly washed away that thought before he could focus on it. Instead, he focused on correcting this small error. Reaching out with his magic, he felt for the psychic energy the gem in his scepter gave off. Finally finding it, he altered it so it would release double the amount of energy over a larger radius. He then smirked to himself. Even if the Black Widow was able to warn them of his intentions, it was too late to stop it now.
"Don't know yet," Knežević said. "In theory, it's a permeant freezing solution, but I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to see the chemicals react in practice. If you get these chemicals for me, I'll be able to find a practical use for it and market it on an international scale."
"It's a good thing, too," the man said. "Otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation right now."
"I was working on something kind of delicate," he explained. "If you could just tell me what you did…"
"I don't think I can." Her voice was broken, and a tear escaped one of her eyes. Pepper frowned and moved across the room to comfort her. Now that he was out from under Pepper's watchful eye, Tony took the chance to escape.
Knežević pulled up alongside her and got out of the car. With no words spoken, he and Oswin worked quickly to get everything loaded up in under two minutes. They then got in the vehicle, leaving the cart abandoned in the parking lot.
"Hmm," Loki scoffed. "Your heroes are scattered. Your floating fortress falls from the sky. Where is my disadvantage?"
Jessica felt a weight in her hidden pants pocket. She still had a device in there, but she wasn't sure if she should use it. It was only supposed to be for world-ending emergencies. Tony Stark dying constituted a world-ending emergency, right?
On the other side, the puppy sat waiting for him. Despite the agonizing pain his cries would suggest he was in, Clint could see that the dog was perfectly fine. Too fine, in fact. He was trying to play innocent, but he wasn't going to fall for it. He picked the puppy up and held him so that they were eye-level with each other. Instantly, the puppy started licking Clint's nose.
Tony felt a hand brush against his forehead. He opened his eyes to see nothing but concern and worry in Steve's.
"Visiting hours ended four hours ago Mr. Stark," the nurse said. "I've been generous by allowing Col. Rhodes and your assistant to stay this long, but I've got to draw the line now. Lights out in twenty minutes."
"She bit me! Look!" Steve held his hand up for Bucky to see. Sure enough, there was a bloody, crescent line starting from the space between his thumb and index finger down to the edge of his hand. Bucky once again said a word that would have gotten him in trouble if an adult was listening and ran back inside the building, screaming his sister's name. Steve got up off the ground and went inside as well. After all, he couldn't exactly leave those cuts wide open, ready to become infected.
"So," she said. "We know that all of the Avengers seemingly work well together. Did you all know each other or get a chance to work together before the incident?"
"So, he's mad at both of us?" Steve nodded. "Damn. I was hoping you could act as a buffer between us so that way things wouldn't get too ugly when he fired me." Steve shook his head.
"Yeah," Tony said. "She was the first, well, the only person I ever willingly came out as bi to. That's why she told me about you. She wanted me to know that I wasn't the only person who ever felt that way."
"Oops…" Tony's voice dropped an octave. "Uh, Steve, you wouldn't happen to remember what I sent you two Christmases ago?"
"But that doesn't help us unless we know who we're dealing with." Betty nodded in agreement before turning back to the box.
While he was disappointed that their shared shower wasn't going to take a more intimate turn, Tony did relish in each touch Steve laid upon him. Just feeling his deft fingers work to lather the shampoo and conditioner into his hair took Tony to realms of ecstasy that he didn't know existed. If Steve could do that just by washing his hair, Tony couldn't imagine what he when he handed his entire body over to him. It didn't stop him from trying, though.
"Did I see the press conference while I waited in quarantine to find out if I was dying again or not?" Tony asked. "No, Pepper, I did not."
"Yes," Tony shouted, kicking off the covers. "I'm awake! I'm listening! Just please stop that noise!" The noise then stopped completely and Tony let out a breath of relief. If he didn't already have a headache…
"Look," she said. "I don't have much in the way of proof. I still have the original document I typed up and submitted to Fury. I can easily get it for you. However, that is still not concreate. The most I can say is that I know someone switched the reports sometime between me handing it in and Fury receiving it. I notified him of it, and he believes me."
"Don't strain yourself," Steve could hear his mother warn. "It's not good for the baby. Besides, I'm fine with them being in the house, just as long as none of them come barging in."
"This one," Lara said, holding out the paper and pointing to the small sketch in question. "I know I've seen it before.
Getting access to the chemicals he needed was going to be a lot harder than Knežević initially thought. For one thing, some of the chemicals that he needed access to were rather rare and pricey. For another, none of the labs he submitted applications to had contacted him. (Which was a rather smart move on their part given that he had no permanent address and no degrees or credentials to speak of in the field of chemistry whatsoever.) So, in the meantime, he was stuck in a dead-end job working behind the bar at one of the less than reputable establishments in town. It might not have been the best job he could have gotten, but the manager didn't really seem to ask questions. If Knežević could get the job done didn't come in one day and go completely postal, shooting up the place, then the manager couldn't have cared less.
"Never mind," she said. "I don't have time to get into this right now. Just don't do it again." Bruce was only able to nod feebly before Lara turned and walked away. He watched her until she turned a corner and was out of sight. Then, he stepped back into his room, shutting the door behind him and leaning against it.
Natasha glanced over at Steve a few times and found him to be motionless, staring up at the ceiling. Each time she wondered what was going on in her fellow Super Soldier's brain, but she eventually decided that she didn't want to know. After all, the worst-case scenarios he was likely imaging for Stark could easily be happening to Clint, too.
The two of them turned to walk through the archway leading to the kitchen. When they did, they came upon a surprise. Sitting on one of the barstools in front of the island counter was Stark. Other than the facts that he was wearing sunglasses indoors, his complexion was paler than normal, and he looked like he dropped ten pounds, he looked much more put together than the last time they saw him. He was nursing a cup of coffee while Cap stood in front of one of the two stovetops and looked to be scrambling eggs. Natasha took the lead in approaching him.
"Not to this extent," Natasha said. "Not to where I'm stepping out of line and threatening people; coming close to killing them."
"Yes and no," he said. "He knows I have well-founded fears of the mental health system, but I've never told him the nitty-gritty of it. What I heard… It was just awful. It was one of the few times I saw my mother cry. There wasn't much that could upset her, but what they were doing to the people there; what they were doing to
"For the most part, we've managed to break up the protest and bring most of the people involved into custody," the cop said. "However, other than that one guy who violated a restraining order, we can't charge anyone with anything worse than criminal trespass."
By some miracle, one of the nurses was familiar with ASL and quickly offered to translate for him. This clearly came to the relief of Dr. Wayne, who immediately started asking medical questions. Most of them were yes or no – most likely for simplicity's sake – but it was clear the doctor knew how to ask the right questions and glean as much as possible from the limited answers. Clint could tell, though, that what he was saying was concerning the doctor.
All Bruce had gotten for himself was a bottle of water. He said he was still full of all the food he ate at the gala, but Lara still felt guilty about pigging out on ice cream while he had nothing. She would offer to share her food, but she knew from reading Amazon reviews of Haribo Sugar-Free Gummi Bears that eating diabetic food could make non-diabetics very sick. She didn't wish that upon Bruce (or anyone, really) so she refrained from doing so. Either way, Bruce didn't seem to mind.
Debating over the issue kept Tony up, which was honestly a blessing in disguise. Even though he knew getting sober was the best thing for him right now, he was scared to fall asleep without having something to drink first. He was being honest when he told Steve that drinking helped him sleep because it really did. He would sleep soundly through the night if he had something to drink beforehand and if he had any nightmares, they would be dulled. They wouldn't have the same horrifying, panic-inducing effect that would shock him out of sleep if he were sober. That was the worst part of the nightmares and honestly, he didn't want to go through it while a bunch of strangers monitored him on closed-circuit television. So, the distress was a good thing. It kept him awake and therefore kept the nightmares away.
Carol accidentally caused an explosion while fighting two powered individuals at the Peoples Unity Church. She now has to face the aftermath of that.
After taking those few moments to think it over, Steve decided that the best way to go would be for some sort of compromise. Granted, he didn't think either party would be satisfied with that, but it was the best route out of the situation that he could see.
"Can we slow this back down to normal speed?" With a few clicks, the concierge did as Natasha asked. "Thank you."
"You said you should be held responsible," Tony said. "But you never said 'sorry.'" Carol shook her head.
He was intubated; pinned down with nowhere to run. A machine was breathing for him. He was being forced to stare up at blacklights that bothered his eyes and were probably doing nothing to kill all the germs and microbes in the air. Finally, thanks to the tubes, he couldn't speak. He could still communicate with ASL, but that wasn't an entirely effective solution. The vinyl sheet that separated him from Stark wasn't see-through, which meant he couldn't communicate with him. Clint was officially in solitary confinement.
"Dad?" He smiled. At least Audrey recognized him. However, he quickly realized that she wasn't as happy to see him as he was to see her. "What the hell are you doing here?"
"You don't know the half of it." They then got their cue to go onstage and the mask of his public persona slid over Tony's face.
With that, she slid her phone back into her purse and began making her way to the emergency stairwell. However, it was too late. As soon as she opened the door, Lara heard footsteps and several voices trying to whisper as quietly as possible. Before she could even make out what they were saying or who they were, she shut the door without letting it make a sound.
"I'm sorry," Lara said. "Were you sent by Mr. Stark or an Agent Coulson? Because unless you were sent by either one of them…" She was cut off by a swift punch to her jaw and she would have fallen back if she didn't already have her hand braced against the elevator door to keep it from shutting. Her other hand flew to her jaw as she slowly looked up. "Wha-" She cut herself off when she saw that he was gearing up to throw another punch. Leaning forward and ducking down, Lara managed to avoid that blow and sent a counterpunch directly to her attacker's stomach. The man briefly gripped his side but seemed unphased as he tried to throw another punch. Lara dodged that one as well and countered by using all her strength to push him back as far as she could. By some miracle, she managed to make it far enough to buy her some time to hit the button to close the elevator doors.
"You know, I looked into that," Dante said. "The restraining order you had against me expired in 2009. You have no legal right to have me arrested." Lara let out a curse under her breath. That was when Cabe stepped forward.
Luckily, Salinas hadn't been coming and the vial was made of thin glass, so it hadn't made a loud sound. Checking to make sure none of the shattered glass landed in the water, Jessica picked it up and gave it a quick stir with a spoon before heading out of the kitchen. Salinas met her at the threshold.
Happy then pulled the door open from the outside and Tony stepped out into a world that solely consisted of bright camera flashes and forty different versions of "Mr. Stark!" People tried to reach around the metal barrier to try to get a handful of the billionaire playboy philanthropist and reporters shouted out a myriad of questions that all seemed to blur together with the cheers of the crowd. Tony took it all in stride; smiling, waving, and making remarks that he could barely hear. Before he knew it, he had safely made his way to the backstage area and he could finally breathe again.
"So, it's alright not to let a pregnant woman into your inn, but if the baby's already been born, you're a monster?" Peggy gave him a look that clearly said, "not the point."
"No," Steve said. "Something is very wrong. It's been wrong since the Chitauri attack and you won't tell me what it is."
Once he was able to stand up straight again, the CDC workers and S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors surrounded him and demanded answers. "How do you feel?" "What symptoms are you experiencing?" "Rate your discomfort on a scale of one to ten." "How close were you to Agent Barton when he opened the letter?" "Did you get any of the powder on you?"
"Two of the agents just walked out of frame," she said. "I'm not sure where they went, but I think they might know that the police are here."
"And the fact that coincides with Happy Hour at T.G.I. Friday's has nothing to do with it." This time, Tony shot Lara a glare.
Hopefully, I did all of this therapy stuff justice. I haven't been having a good time in therapy as of late (mostly because my therapist just wants to read me "inspirational" stories rather than, you know, actually discuss anything) so I hope my frustration and derision with the topic didn't come across. Honestly, I do believe therapy is helpful and a good resource for people who are struggling, I'm just having a problem with MY therapist at the moment. If you have mental health problems and have the means to seek help (because in the US they really make you jump through hoops just to see someone) I highly suggest you do so.
"Damn," Knežević stroked the dark stubble that lined the area around his mouth. "Guess we'll just have to go in and hope for the best."
"I can already see the looks on their faces," he said. "They're going to have that 'oh shit' look. You know the one…"
"How are we going to do that?" he asked. "Without Freeman there, we can't get inside the building anymore. We're not going to be able to protest in Stark's lobby."
"Why did you stop it?" Things were silent for a moment as Tony waited for her to add to her inquiry. She didn't say anything else, so Tony took the initiative for himself.
Tony had been up most of the night, preparing to take the tower off the grid. While he was doing some electrical work (because apparently the electrician he hired chose to ignore him when he said to wire the penthouse to both the main city powerline
"Can't argue with that," he said wrapping his arms around Steve's shoulders. "Especially right now."
It took only a few moments for Stark to completely empty the contents of his stomach onto the ground and when he was done, he was left raggedly panting. Jessica was hesitant to approach him, unsure if it would be safe to do so. However, Stark quickly got to his feet on his own, which Jess took as a good sign. She quickly moved to help support him.
"Stark Industries was robbed?" She narrowed her gaze as a look of surprise came over his face. She didn't think that was possible.
"I'm sorry what are we talking about here?" Tony looked from director to agent to commander, hoping one of them would fill him in on what was going on. Coulson gestured over to a large plate-glass window that took up most of the left-hand side of the wall with a nod of his head.
"Yes," Pepper said immediately. "Yes, she's telling the truth. I hired her myself along with Mr. Stark and I can get the necessary files to prove that she's employed by Stark Industries."
"Last night?" The words came out of Steve's mouth as a question as his expression turned to one of disbelief. "You kept trying to ask me if I was afraid of something, but it wasn't quite making any sense." Tony shook his head in confusion.
"What the hell?" he shouted. "What are you thinking, making that idiot a Decibel? Do you know what kind of damage he's done to us; to the Church?"
"Damn it," she cursed as the elevator doors opened back up. Getting to her feet, Lara sprinted back into the penthouse. "JARVIS!" she called out. "JARVIS, can you block the elevator so that way no one can access it?"
The first time Tony woke up, the sun hadn't risen yet, but he could still see Steve's sleeping face thanks to the soft glow of the moonlight coming through the window. At first, he wasn't sure what had woken him, but it became clear when his stomach gave a violent lurch. He quickly turned to his other side and was grateful for the fact that he had brought the wastebasket over to the side of the bed a few days ago. He kept waiting for something to come up, but nothing ever did. He fell asleep internally debating whether he should try moving to the bathroom.
"If you are not going to reach out to S.H.I.E.L.D. for help, at least reach out to somebody you trust. Not Steve, but someone who can help you find a professional therapist because you need one." Stark was silent for a long moment before nodding.
The ride to the hospital took longer than she thought it should. She couldn't see where they were going and her ears were still ringing from the blast, so she could just barely hear what the EMTs were saying. Whatever on-the-spot assessments they were making of her injuries were lost to her, though she doubted they were anything to be concerned about. Carol was more worried that one of them would notice that she bled blue than anything else.
Tony knew where he was when he woke up. He remembered passing out on the beach, so he knew that presumably Steve, Natasha, or one of the cops had called for an ambulance and brought him back to the hospital. That was fine. He probably deserved it anyway for sneaking out and all. Oh well, at least he didn't have to worry about the thieves being at-large anymore. Both had been caught and arrested by the police. That was such a relief off Tony's mind that he had time to focus on other things like why exactly couldn't he turn over?
"I think your guess was right, Lara," she said. "It looks like this stuff is related to the bio-terror attack."
"I won't," Cooper assured. Meanwhile, Clint took notice that Lila was squirming about, as if straining to look at something.
"Sorry." It was clear he automatically thought she was referring to the incident on the Hellicarrier.
Within a fraction of a second, Tony moved to straddle Steve and had him locked in a deep, passionate kiss. Things got heated rather fast. Tony could feel his heart pounding in his chest as one kiss melted into another. As they breathlessly parted for a moment, an idea popped into Tony's head. Pressing a quick kiss to Steve's cheek, Tony brought his lips over to his ear.
Alright, I get the feeling this is a case where politically, I'm damned if I do say something and damned if I don't - especially since everything I have to say comes from a place of deep-seated anger - so all I'm actually going to say is try and stay safe if you're living in the D.C. area. Same for anywhere else in the US. As the inauguration draws closer, I doubt this will be the last incident we have.
"Stark, you have to understand, S.H.I.E.L.D. has no nefarious intentions in taking this information from you." The expression on Tony's face showed he wasn't buying it. "We know nothing in there can be used to replicate the Super Soldier Serum. That's not our goal here."
Obviously, Tony was more than a bit antsy to see Steve. How could he not be? The guy was the only thing he had on his mind for the past week, other than completing construction on the tower. It was a little scary to Tony to admit that, but at the same time it was thrilling.
"Shit," Stark remarked. "I know Steve's wary around doctors, but I don't think even he would go that far."
"Can you put the live video feeds from in front of the private elevator and the lobby on the TV, please?" Lara asked.
Natasha sighed as she looked up. Steve was walking by her bed for what seemed like the fortieth time. That was probably forty too many. Knowing what she had to do, Natasha got up off the bed and moved to follow him.
Regardless of my excuses and reasonings, I've made this author's note long enough. All I ask if you've made it through this mess of word vomit is to leave a review. Who knows, it might give me the inspiration I need.
"Of course," she said. "Thank you for your insight, Mr. DeMarcus, Mr. Moss. I'll get into contact with you about that soon." DeMarcus nodded as he and Moss got up.
He was running towards the house. He could see the missiles coming. If he was just a little faster this time maybe he cold gets to them in time to save them, or at the very least, die with them.
Happy Fourth of July to everyone in the US and a very happy 100th birthday to everyone's favorite sentinel of liberty, Steve Rogers - AKA Captain America! Do you want to know the best way you can celebrate? It's by not doxxing me, getting off that hire-a-hitman site your on and deleting the TOR browser from your computer completely. Yeah, it's one of THOSE chapters.
"I'm fi…" He stopped himself, clearly biting down on his tongue to keep himself from saying anymore.
"That's my secret, Captain," he remarked. "I'm always angry." With that he turned back around, his pallor complexion turning a monstrous green and his physical form increasing to at least three times his size. As the sky-whale scraped across the pavement towards them, the Hulk smashed his fist directly into the creature's forehead, causing it to flip in the air as it halted in its destructive path.
"The thing is, I kind of already know it's not anything to worry about," Steve said. "Tony, Natasha, and Clint have all told me it's not likely to happen in the modern age."
"But you did," Lara said. "When it happened, you called it abuse. That's why I stopped and let you go." Tony winced a bit at the revelation.
"Sure thing." Right away, she got to work, pulling out her phone and turning to the correct page in the planner.
"I can't answer that." Duran then pulled a thin, silver camera out from her other pocket. "Do you mind if I take a few pictures?"
After going over the rules one last time, Freeman and Lara left to take their places in the crowd. They would be sitting in the fifth row to the left of the left aisle; easy to spot if one of them became nervous. Despite the hell that he had already been through, doubted that he would need it but had to admit that it was just a little comforting to know that someone familiar was there. He could imagine it would be a lot more so for the others.
"Yeah, but they're not…" The redhead gave up. "You know what, never mind. I'll take care of it." The blonde slowly backed away again, leaving the redhead to turn her attention to Steve. "Hi." Although she was smiling and using a pleasant tone of voice, it was clear that she was not pleased.
The fact that Pepper and Happy were going to be helping Tony to do this and were supportive of him went a long way to ease Steve's worries. By this point, Steve knew them well enough to know that they would never allow Tony to do something that would put himself in danger. (Well, outside of Iron Man.) He could not help but be thankful for that. Not only did Tony have two amazing friends that would help him through something like this, but they could be trusted to keep him safe. Steve missed having friends like that… A friend…
Even though they were arguing, Steve wasn't worried about either of them becoming violent. Lara was clearly furious, but she did keep her hands in plain sight even took steps to appear less threatening. Tony, meanwhile, was too drunk to walk a straight line, never mind start throwing hands. Steve felt like they wouldn't hurt each other, so he didn't rush to approach them. A slow and calm approach was probably the best to diffuse the situation.
"All of it," Fair said. "Everything you just said. I don't think I trust you." Romanoff smiled, but the fury in her eyes could not be disguised.
Carol was shocked by what she found. She could see clear parallels between the attack on New York and a series of attacks that had been happening throughout the galaxy for years. Entire planets had their populations decimated, and the attackers – a group known as the Black Order – would leave those who remained behind to deal with the devastation. Carol hadn't faced them up close, but she had seen the aftermath firsthand and read the reports made by the Nova Corps. The only difference she could see between New York and the planets that had been attacked was that they had the Avengers protecting them, and even then it was a miracle that they weren't all killed before Tony took that nuke up to space. What had come close to happening… It could have been so much worse.
He instantly smashed his head against the phone after pushing the send button and scrambled to add a secondary text to his reply.
"My chest," she gasped out. "My head and my back…" Fury got up and put a hand on her back looking like he was trying to decide whether hitting her back would be helpful. Carol, meanwhile, tapped the screen of her wrist display and did a scan of Jessica's body. When the results came back, Carol raised her eyebrows in surprise.
Tony said he'd be coming around six. That left Steve with a lot of time to kill. Agent Wylie came to check up on him a couple of times but didn't stick around long. One of the times he asked Steve what he and Tony were talking about the night before. Steve knew the agent had been listening in on that conversation, so he had to wonder whether he was asking because he wanted to hear whatever was said up front, or because S.H.I.E.L.D. knew Tony was coming and wanted details just to be prepared. Since Steve didn't know the later for a fact or whether they would be cool with it if they did (probably no to both) he just kept his answers vague, much to Wylie's clear displeasure.
Steve shifted positions to try and get a bit more comfortable and accidentally knocked his compass off the bed. Luckily, he caught it before it hit the ground and it suffered no damage. He flipped it open to make sure it was okay, though. It was the only possession he had left in the world, after all. When he opened it, he found himself faced with the image of Peggy Carter.
Rhodey bit his lip, not liking the situation at all. Tony seemed oblivious to the fact that he was being recorded. He glanced in the camera's direction a few times, but never seemed to take notice of it. That alone caused red flags to raise in Rhodey's mind but paired with the fact that Stone appeared to be completely avoiding the camera made nuclear sirens go off as well.
Tony let out an exasperated breath. Yup, S.H.I.E.L.D. was in some pretty big trouble and of course they were going to lean on their golden boy to make everything alright. Still, there was nothing Tony could do but read the files and figure out a way he could help. Meanwhile, Lara walked up next to him and set her glass down on the counter.
"A month ago," Tony said. "I came back clean and I haven't slept with anyone or played with dirty needles since then." Thinking back, the last person Tony could remember sleeping with was Christine Everheart the night before he left for Afghanistan. Ever since then, his sex life's been dead in the water. It made him a little sad to realize he hadn't gotten laid in so long, but he had other things going on, like stopping insane megalomaniacs from killing hundreds upon thousands of innocent people and dying. He seemed to be doing the latter of the two a lot lately.
"How long has it been?" Freeman asked the person on the other end of the call. The other person probably said that they didn't know. "Well, I got off the phone with you fifteen minutes ago. Have you looked for him?" A pause. "Alright, I'm on my way over there." Another pause. "No." Pause. "Because if we bring him in, it's not going to look good." Pause. "Just think about it." Freeman sarcastically nodded. "Yeah, exactly. Listen, just send the workers out to search for him. He's probably still somewhere on your property. If you don't find him by the time I get there, I'll call the RCMP…"
I hope everyone's having a wonderful holiday because I'm sure not. I have to get blood drawn today and I'm deathly afraid of needles. It's to the point where I need to be put on Valium in order to be docile enough not to attack the nurses. Well, at least I can say I got the scare of my life this Halloween, right?
Freeman straightened up, nodded, and started to make his way down the hall. Adoniram slowly backed away from the door and shut it, careful to twist the lock before backing away from the door. He turned around and looked Salinas dead in the eye.
"Too bad," Lara said. "Here's me reminding you again. We're on a tight schedule. Get your ass in gear."
"Don't worry about Tony," Rhodes said. "He's already been dragged through the mud over this. He's strong enough to go through it again. Hell, this time might even be
Even though he had been feeling much better the day before, Tony was now feeling horrible. Not only was his headache back, but now he had an entire slew of other symptoms on top of it. His throat hurt, he felt hot, and he constantly had to resist the urge to cough. He had most likely picked up a cold from someone at S.H.I.E.L.D. as they had been the only people that he had been in contact within the past couple of days, so it was just the cherry on top of his horrible weekend. The only silver lining of all of it was meeting Steve, which Tony hadn't been expecting when he found out that the super soldier was still alive.
"I know," she said. "I work in law enforcement, too, so believe me when I tell you that without a doubt in my mind, the person who attacked me was Dante Conroy."
Nina collapsed to the ground in a fit of horrifying sobs. Never in her life had she experienced such pain and probably never would again. All she could do was sit, scream, and cry for her loss.
"Yeah," he agreed. "Stay out here, though. Just in case." Lara nodded. Steve slowly pushed the door open. He was met with darkness and started feeling around the sides of the door for the light switch. "Tony?"
"Well, keep scanning until you detect one," Tony said. I don't know what they did to the tape, but it made it…"
"Not here!" Thor grabbed Loki by the shoulders and shoved him a few steps backward. "You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream!" Thor's expression then softened a bit and put a hand on Loki's neck affectionately. "You come home." Loki sincerely looked into Thor's eyes.
"Holy shit," he said. "I know homelessness is a problem, but we don't solve it by running them over." All eyes turned towards him. Relief came across Pepper and Happy's faces.
"Really?" The woman sounded incredulous. It was the first emotion he heard come out of her voice. "Is that why the fire department has been called to put out your 'research' three times in a two-week span?"
Just as he was questioning that, Loki heard the whining start back up and a bolt of pain shot through his head. Bringing his hand up to cradle the affected area, Loki had found it was the same spot the Other had touched him during their psychic conference. His eyes went wide in realization and he quickly put his hands down and calmly waited for the noise to stop and the throbbing to cease. Luckily, within a few seconds, it did just that. Loki swallowed hard.
"Fine," he said. "Make sure he doesn't damage the room and that the hotel staff doesn't see him. If they do, you're paying for it." Clint nodded.
"I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk about something later?" Clint could see the space between Tony's eyebrows narrow.
"Nope," she said, popping the "p." "You can see it written here quite clearly. 'Irukandji Syndrome caused by exposure to the venom of the
"Yes," Bergeron said. "But the only two max-sec prisons that house women are on the East Coast. Even if you go for medium-security, the closest facility is in Dublin, which is all the way up by Oakland. Sometimes you've just got to work with what you've got."
"That is to make sure you don't try to escape again," she said. "The waist restraint makes sure you don't get up, the wrist restraints make sure you don't try to pull out your IVs, and the mittens make sure you don't try to undo the wrist restraints. They're also very effective in making sure that newborns and psychiatric patients don't try to scratch themselves." Tony tried hard to communicate two words in one glare. It seemed to work because the next thing the doctor said was "I'll tell a nurse to switch you to a nasal cannula. You'd waste a lot less energy saying the actual words than you are glaring at me like that."
"See you in a bit," Tony promised before taking his hand off the door and turning in the direction of Pepper's office. A pang of sadness rippled through his chest as he heard the elevator doors slide closed and he had to remind himself that it would be a few moments at best. He was probably worrying too much. Nothing would be wrong, and he would be able to go back to Steve in no time.
Tarquan rushed to the escape pod, just in time to reach the remaining survivors before they departed. Mikah met him at the door. He held her for a few seconds before pulling the disc out of his coat pocket and placing it in her hands. She nodded in understanding of what needed to be done. Tarquan then touched his children's faces in an affectionate gesture before sending them all off inside the pod. The door sealed shut behind them and he could hear the shuttle disembarking. He sighed and a single tear rolled down his face before turning to join the other men in facing the wrath of the Kree.
Tony stayed like that for a few minutes before the sound of knocking on glass broke him out of his trance. He looked up to see Conroy standing at the door to the lab, waving and mouthing the words "hi, can you let me in?" Tony got up and unlocked the door for her.
"No," Bruce said. "Shaking would only happen once the seizure set in. It's just the general absence of alcohol in his system making him do that. Most of the time, there is no warning for a seizure. It just happens. Although some patients have reported certain types of olfactory feedback before experiencing a seizure."
"I found the box that once contained the venom on the steps to my basement," Salinas explained. "Luckily I caught it before I could eat or drink anything in that house. I'm even having the hot water heater replaced, just in case."
"Uh, no," she said as she furrowed her brow. "I mean I'm on Lotensin, but that's for Diabetes, not any heart problem. Why?"
"Uh," Clint said. "An alleyway on 10th Street between a hotel and a Bank of America. I found him eating out of a Lucky's Pizza box, and I was thinking of naming him…"
Most of the popcorn she was able to scoop back into the bowl and dump out in the trash, but there were still tiny bits that she had to pluck out of the carpet by hand. She had a vacuum cleaner and she would run it, except that the people below her got angry and knocked on her door when she did. Although most of the time she was willing to put up the fight, she honestly doubted that it was the right time to do it after an earthquake and gas explosion, so she resigned herself to unnecessary manual labor. She was fairly certain that as she walked back and forth, Telemachus was hissing at her from wherever he was hiding, but her hearing hadn't returned yet, so she could just pretend that wasn't happening.
"Where's this coming from?" Natasha questioned aloud, though it sounded like she was more awed than concerned. There's a trained pilot for you. Loki, however, had a worried expression come over his face.
Lara swallowed hard. As much as she liked Natasha – who was much nicer than Tony had made her out to be – Lara knew that it would be a terrible idea to try to go into a master spy and assassin's room without there permission, even if it was for something as trivial as a hair dryer. In fact, it'd probably be tantamount to suicide. It was probably a better idea to walk blindfolded through a minefield. Regardless, it wasn't like she had any other choice. So, rather dramatically, she sighed.
Natasha had to get changed before they went looking, but she didn't take long. She just put a bra on and exchanged her shorts for jeans, retaining the black t-shirt she had worn to bed. Clint let Lara into his suite and put her in charge of babysitting the dog while they looked for Tony. (He also told her to take whatever she wanted from the fridge and not to worry about the cost. Given how pale she was, that was clearly the smart move.) With both of those concerns crossed out, the remaining four Avengers set off in search of their missing member.
He couldn't find the person that the bartender saw Tony talking with, but Steve did find several people who had encountered Tony. Some of them didn't notice anything wrong with Tony at all. Some of them described his behavior as odd, but nothing too alarming. Others described him as being inattentive and wobbly on his feet, and a few expressed genuine concerns for him. All of them ended up telling Steve the exact same thing: "He was here a moment ago. You just missed him."
"Also, the guy said thirty minutes or less and it's free," Clint added. "And that was forty-five minutes ago." Tony frowned.
Although they had gotten off to a bit of a rocky start (if you define holding a knife to a person's eye and threatening to kill them a rocky start), Lara had apologized for her actions and she and Bruce were on cordial enough terms to where she'd consider them friends. He was nice and she liked talking to him, even if she couldn't fully understand what he said sometimes with the scientific terminology. If she asked him to break it down into numbers though, he'd oblige, and she'd be able to get the gist of what he was saying. Numbers were a universal language after all.
Knežvić was confused by that until he looked up at the TV and saw that it had switched to the news. The reporter – who was identified as Jessa Abello by the news banner underneath her – stood in front of a Jared's Galleria of Jewelry that was surrounded by the flashing lights of police cars. He had to do a double take as his eyes flashed over to the laughing girl, then back to the TV.
"We've fired Freeman," Pepper reminded her. "And the police and our security team are aware of the situation. More importantly, you've taken out a personal protection order against your ex. You've taken all the right steps. You shouldn't have to feel afraid."
Lara sat there for several minutes puzzling over the problem. While she did, security officers continued to bustle about, following procedures to a T. Slowly, they started trickling out of the room to do their assigned duties. It wasn't until there was only one other person left in the room with her that someone finally caught that she wasn't moving.
"There will be no problem," Romanoff said. "As long as you tell us why Salinas is after Stark." A look of disgust came across Freeman's face.
"Send him in right away." Waylon nodded and complied. A moment later, an older man with hair as red as it was the day he was born stepped into the room. If Pepper remembered correctly, his name was Dr. Fredrick Griffith. Pepper stood and crossed the room to greet him.
"Really? Cool." Steve had met Colonel Rhodes a few times; the two of them having been introduced at Tony's Christmas Party two years prior. Steve found Rhodes to be nice and easy-going. He could see through his banter with Tony how the two of them came to be friends. He could also see how protective he was of Tony. Their dynamic reminded him of himself and Bucky back in the day…
Slowly, he began to saunter out of the restaurant when he stopped dead in his tracks. Turning around, Knežević looked at the stone corpse. He glanced down at her name tag and smiled.
"I thought you were dead!" It came out louder than Nina intended, but she didn't care. "Your house exploded! They told me you were dead! I can't believe it! I thought you were dead! Oh my God! I can't believe it! Oh my God!" Nina had her arms around Oswin again at this point. Oswin gently ran her fingers through her hair.
"Absolutely," Betty said. "I know Leonard won't mind and my father is not going to be there. Also, we're having an outdoor wedding at a place that's a little off the beaten path, so there's not going to be much in the way of property damage either." For once, Bruce ignored the part of his brain that urged him to stay away from people and smiled.
Clint didn't know how Fury lost his eye, but when he came over to the house after Lila was born, Cooper wouldn't stop asking about it. So, to shut him up before he said something impolite, Clint told Cooper that he just wasn't born with one and that it happens to people sometimes. Cooper understood as well as any four-year-old could and thankfully didn't press it further. (It didn't stop him from asking Fury if it meant that he hand his dad worked as pirates, to which Fury humored him.) Because of that, both children understood that sort of disability, so that saved them an explanation.
"Never been," she said. "But I've encountered some of the people. They're good people as far as I can tell. Why?"
This hadn't been where he was before. Clint was sure of that. What he wasn't sure of was how he got there or why he was even there in the first place. He remembered something about S.H.I.E.L.D., but that was it. He didn't remember how he had gotten to this field, and it took him a second to even recognize the place. When he did, he was overjoyed. This was the field surrounding his farm, turning around, Clint could spot the farmhouse in the distance and began sprinting at top speed for it.
