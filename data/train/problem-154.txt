The game was on.
?" Sherlock asked as Jim walked away. "That Sebastian is dangerous, and you flirting with his boyfriend is not helping matters."
It didn't take John long to walk to his new school, and he tried to relax as he saw other students arriving as well. He was early, but apparently he wasn't the only one.
"I'm fine," Sherlock said, decidedly
There was no one at the front desk, and Mary let out another sigh, giving an annoyed glance at her currently ring-less finger before following the sounds of the party.
“You’ll make a fantastic detective.” I reply honestly, and Sherlock grins at me.
“You made me look bad!” Cain yelled, rounding on Abel when The Shining One left. “You’re always trying to make me look bad!”
“That is for another time.” Sherlock smiled sadly. “We shall meet again, John, but not for a long time. Go home, and rest. You deserve it.”
“Well, I would love if you played violin for me,” John said honestly, and Sherlock felt warm.
"Is it true?" John asked after he had calmed down. "That thing you can do, where you look at someone and know everything about them?"
John snorted at that, "That's understandable. So, you're a demon that can read an entire person's history just by looking at them. Were you born for the job, or were you hired?"
“Not at all. Maybe we can get Sherlock to eliminate the human himself.” The dragon smirked, turning off the screen. “That is what we do best, after all. Convince them that human life is detrimental to their wellbeing. They all believe it, in the end.”
staying for Christmas.” John shot back. “I’m going to find those keys of yours, and I’ll drive back myself.”
that I just…I felt rotten afterward.”
“Ship?” John laughed. “This isn’t a ship. This is a…I don’t bloody know what it is, but I certainly don’t feel waves or…or whatever.”
"Nope, I'm gonna stop you right there," John cut him off. "I'm no genius, but I'm still pretty damn smart. And I don't copy off friend's homework anyway."
“I…hang on. How did you know that I was in the army?” The blond looked startled. “Have you been
ask for, if Santa Claus could perform miracles. Then, he wondered if he should admit what he wanted aloud.
“Humans lack the proper term.” Greg said patiently. “Here one might call it marriage, but it is far stronger than that. We were created for one another.”
“You believed me to be nearing thirty.” Sherlock said. “It was easy enough to deduce that you yourself were nearing thirty. You talk to me as one would a peer, and not as one would speak to someone older or younger than them.”
As soon as they hit sunlight, they scatter, making their way towards their own homes. Sherlock is left on the sidewalk, feeling unbearably lonely. It’s ridiculous, as he’s no more alone than he was three days before, but the sudden realisation of it all hit him like a truck.
Violet grabbed a stack of books, shuffling through them until she came upon a black and white and green one. “Here we are!”
“Good, I’m glad.” John replied, and they continued their journey along the narrow walking path in the woods.
"Yes, well, we'll need to get you there first," Sherlock said, tapping on the cool metal. "Perhaps, if I fill the boot of a car with water..."
“Obviously the collar is too tight.” His curly-haired master said, red tail whipping back and forth. “Couldn’t you loosen it?”
"Sherlock!"
“He’s a right arse, he is.” I respond. “Now, how again did you want to ruin Trevor’s reputation?”
"Of course!" Tom replied. "I bet Sherlock that if my date went well, he would have to go on one. A date, that is."
"And you've rather revealed yours." A deep voice startles both Jim and I. My heart clenches in my chest when Sherlock steps around the corner, wiggling his mobile between his fingers tauntingly.
DI Lestrade gives me one last smile, then he's down to business, his pen poised over his notepad. There are notes scribbled everywhere, even in the margins, and the little bit that I can read upside down doesn't make sense.
“Ciao, darling!” Victor crows, and my line goes dead. Well, that was interesting.
“12? That means you’re 16 now.” Mike is clearly surprised. “What are you doing in an advanced bio class?”
"Her boss." The silver-haired man looked shocked. "Sorry, how did you know that?"
“Is that what you call it?” Sherlock rolled his eyes, coming to rest beside John. “I didn’t realise putting feathers in my trouser pockets was adequate revenge.”
"Of course I do," John said, clutching the confession picture in his hands as he tried to ignore his instinct to flee.
His mother and father looked absolutely crestfallen, and Mycroft had a smug look on his face that Sherlock knew the reason for.
The pale man he had met in the desert was glowering at him, anger in those blue eyes.
"You look surprised," Victor said, looking amused.
“Mycroft, I have found my soul-mate!” Sheol announced after a long day of soul collecting. “It has taken thousands of years, but he has finally come to me.”
"Do it again," John said after a moment.
"You think so?" Sherlock asked.
The doctors sighed as the heart rate monitor flat-lined, and started to clean up the execution room. Nobody watched as a tall, black haired man left the room, pulling a black leather glove over his too-pale hand. Nobody noticed the man in the long coat sweep through the prison, seemingly at ease with his surroundings. Nobody saw Sherlock Holmes leave Florida state penitentiary.
“But I do.” Sheol said. “I don’t want you to die because of me.”
A blond haired boy stood in the doorway to their carriage, clad in a red and gold Gryffindor jumper and a kind smile.
“I don’t know.” I say with a shrug, hoping that I look completely clueless. “They just came up and started talking to me, it was really weird.”
"Oh god, yes."
“These gloves protect those around you from your powers.” The Shining One said, putting the strange, black skins on his hands. “For you take life, not give it. You did not eat of the tree, so you shall not suffer from it, but are death. You shall live forever.”
"Cause, you didn't deny it." Bill Murray replied. "Come on, introduce us to your boyfriend, or we're gonna keep trying to set you up."
“It hardly matters.” Sherlock replied, leading John into the underground, masses of dragon’s with their human pets milling around them. “I don’t
On this day, August 31st, in 1990, a child by the name of Robottko was born. It was decreed that every year on her birthday, she shall update every fanfiction that is a WIP. So, it is with great honor that I present to you this update.
John continued walking along an unknown London street, his limbs feeling heavier by the second.  He ducked down an alley, trying to confuse anyone who would think to follow him. Not that anyone noticed him, but the less straightforward path he took, the better. He had almost made it out of the alley when his knees buckled, sending him toppling into the side of a skip.
"Anything for you...Tom," He said, steering Sherlock toward the corner table. John stepped in a moment later, his mobile pressed against his ear.
He dashed out of the restaurant, hailing a cab before making his way to Baker Street.
Of course, Sherlock found the attacks nothing but amusing. He had refused to own a slave his entire life, sending away the most professional men and women away with but a glance. It had been a strain on his mother and father, both of whom were convinced that Sherlock could not live on his own. None of their begging and pleading would sway his mind. It proved beneficial in the end.
John snorted, grabbing his chemistry book and pulling it on his lap. "I really could use help with this."
Two fishermen had supposedly caught it just off the coast of Clacton-on-Sea, spearing the creature through the shoulder on accident.
“Of course I’ll take out the rubbish.” Sherlock replied, ending with a final chord from the original Paganini before setting his violin down.
Mummy gave them a disapproving look, and both Sherlock and Mycroft hung their heads in shame and fear. It was never good to cross mummy.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Holmes?" John's eyebrows raised. "So that's why you seem familiar. You talk just like your brother."
“You are so very wrong.”
"This isn't one of my brother's agents, is it?" It wasn't a question, not really, but he felt so foolish for hoping.
“No. God no.” John sighed, unable to look at Sherlock now. “I’m embarrassed cause…well, first of all, you are
to deduce it.
“Fascinating.” Mycroft said, walking closer. “If you paid any attention to current events, you would realise that Captain John Watson was a lead instigator in the war. Why isn’t he in a higher security prison?”
"But, I'm just me..." John broke off, looking shell shocked.
“Red clothing is reserved for Mondays.” Sebastian says, eating a spoonful of what I suspect is corn, though the bright orange colour was throwing me off. “And green for Tuesday. You’re not allowed to wear t-shirts two days in a row, and you’re only allowed to have your hair product free once a week…I guess you picked today.” His eyes flicked up to my hair, which was lying nice and chemical-free against my scalp.
"This morning??"
Obtaining a group of skilled healers is rather easy when one is prince of a whole planet.
"Poor choice of words," Sherlock said quickly, dimly registering the glint of John's forgotten cane as they exited. "What I'm trying to convey to you is that I wouldn't lie to you about who I am...that is, what I do..."
Sheol and the angel watched as the young man disappeared. Turning to Sheol, the angel extended his hand. “The soul?”
“Go on,” Mummy shooed Sherlock, her face practically glowing. “Go make that boyfriend of yours happy. We don’t want to drive him away!”
“A ward for dangerous humans?” Sherlock rolled his eyes at the markings above the door to the corridor. “How on earth could
"Tell me, Holmes, are we going to walk all over London, or will you tell me your thoughts?" Watson asked, and Sherlock could hear his amusement in his voice.
Seriously, I never thought I would get a single kudo on this fic, and now I have the most wonderful readers in the entire world. You deserve hourly updates, you do, and I would give them to you if I could. But for now, I offer this measly present.
"Another one?" John asked as they snuck out of his John's dormitory into the common room below. "You'd think the professors would know who it was by now!"
which she had been re-reading, and pulled out her makeshift bookmark that had the address to the Holmes’ winter estate scrawled messily across the front in blue pen. “Here you are.”
“You’re safe.” The vampire began, his voice deep, calm, and reassuring. “You are always safe with me as long as you serve me well. Your master is thirsty now; be a good slave and offer me a drink.”
"Holmes, Sherlock."
Thank you to everyone who has read the story up to here. I've been typing furiously away at chapter 3, which is looking like it will be twice or three times the size of this chapter. You are all marvellous, and I would hug each and everyone one of you if you lived closer to me, and you wouldn't find it so creepy.
Sherlock turned back to John, his heart pounding erratically, and he could no longer ignore his symptoms.
“That would be…nice.” Sherlock says, looking faintly surprised. “I confess, I’ve missed your family.”
"This doesn't make sense," Sherlock growled, scales forming on his neck in annoyance. "No human would be able to do this."
"Oh." John shuffled, scuffing his shoe against the ground. "That was nothing."
"What you did...seeing or whatever. That was amazing!"
“You kidnapped me!” John threw his hands up in the air. “I think that qualifies as ‘not nice’, Sherlock!”
"I'm the only one of my kind," John lied hurriedly.
“That is…acceptable.” Sherlock sighed. John took that as permission, and he left the house, his coat still wrapped around his lithe frame from earlier.
John thought, looking around quickly to make sure no one was watching him. A small smile flitted across his face when he confirmed the fact that his smaller than average size and seemingly normal appearance kept people from observing him.
"Morning, partner," John said. "How are we doing this fine Monday morning?"
"Hold on," John said, grabbing out his mobile. "Oh, it's Mike. Sorry about this."
John laughed at that, causing Sherlock to laugh as well. “I suppose you’re right. But that’s hardly as interesting as what you do. Consulting detective, right?”
"What do most people say?"
“Thank you, Violet. It’s perfect!”
I study the initials closer this time. I only know one person with those initials, and I never gave him my number. It couldn’t possibly be him, could it? I type out a short response, sending it before I can talk myself out of it.
"You've let your heart rule your head, Sherlock." a voice says from the darkness of the empty hallway. A tall, posh looking bloke steps out from the shadows like a bad James Bond villain. "What have I told you about that?"
“First of all, I don’t know French.” John muttered, crossing his arms over his chest. “Second of all…what is with the dramatics?”
“Right…goodbye.” Sherlock looked up, looking at John one last time before he was gone. John looked back at him, waved once, and then he was gone, trotting after his fiancée like a puppy.
home. 221B is my home...I thought you knew that."
"John? What's gotten into you?" Victor asks, looking surprised.
"Yes."
“This is John Watson.” Another officer said, grabbing hold of John and pulling him behind her before aiming her gun at Sherlock, whose hands were in the air.
“No.” Sheol said, his eyes going wide. “You were my soul-mate, you can’t have died. Please come back to me.”
"Of course it was special," John snorted. "Now, what can we do about these vanishing students?"
"I'm pretty sure we'll have to give statements to the police," Jim said, looking amused. "And I still have to thank my hero somehow. Perhaps a date?"
Namely, that of body of the pink fairy Jennifer.
“I don’t think, I know.” Sherlock says, his face and tone smug. “The killer, or killers, are trying to make a point. What that point is, I don’t know. But I intend to find out.”
"Sarah and I broke up
“Lucky bastard.” She muttered, and she quickly slapped something very fluffy and
“Everyday.” A deep voice responds. “Though not in the way you would hope.”
"I need you to be one hundred percent honest with me John," He said, "Did you kill that human?"
“No.” John huffed a sigh. “What happened back there?”
It was a beautiful briefcase, identical in every way to Mycroft's, save for the initials.
The Hogwarts Express lurched as it began to move, slowly pulling away from platform 9 3/4. Sherlock waved until he could no longer see his father or mother, and continued to wave for an extra minute or so just for good measure. It wasn't until Kings Cross was no longer visible that Sherlock pulled his arm in, feeling suddenly alone.
Sherlock yanked at his hair in frustration as he paced around an apartment in Los Angeles, waiting for a man to die. John Watson was becoming an increasingly appealing thorn in his side, and he didn't know if there was anything he could do to prevent his appalling behaviour, or if he even wanted to prevent it.
“Why not?” Sherlock smirks, pocketing his mobile. “You’re my assistant, and I am trying to solve a murder.”
“Are you ready to read the story?” She asked pleasantly, looking between the two of them questioningly.
“Come on, John!” David called, and John turned to look, surprised to see a smiling woman around his dad’s age standing there, smiling cheerfully.
It's my birthday and I'll cry if I want to. You would cry too if you
The rest of September and October passed in the same manner. I found myself getting closer to the Plastics, as well as Mike and Greg. My popularity skyrocketed until girls would hang around my locker, trying to talk to me, and I got great grades, making my mum and dad proud. But the best thing was my friendship with Sherlock Holmes. Even though there was a distinct lack of murders, Sherlock continued to come over to my house, stealing my laptop for research purposes. All in all, it was a good beginning to my first year in a London school. I was even invited to Victor Trevor’s annual Halloween party.
"Right, okay." I say with a sigh. "We'll have a small party. How bad can it be?"
“You thought I was rude because she was human?” Sherlock scoffed, “Don’t be ridiculous. I am rude to everyone. Molly Hooper, while admittedly more intelligent than most creatures, can still get annoying. She was attempting to ask me out on a date, and I rejected her in the swiftest manner possible.”
"Oh god, yes," Sherlock said, swooping down and pressing his lips to John's.
"Oh, fine. Yes, I did remember his name," Sherlock huffed. "There, my big secret revealed. I'll put the toes away later."
John smiled at him, and Sherlock could see that he had no idea what ‘hospitable’ meant, but he found that he didn’t even care very much.
It takes weeks before the man and woman trust him, though he does not mind. He learns of their names, Adam and Eve, and he learns of their story. The first and second children of God, they were born without sin.
Sebastian darts out of the toilets without another word, a hopeful look on his face. Pleased at my invasive manoeuvre, I quickly shoot a text to Greg and Mike.
Oh no.
Oh, this was bad. This was very bad. Sentiment on its own was a destructive force, but to fall in love with someone who was so impossibly out of reach was a death sentence.
“What are you doing here, you great endoplasmic arse?” Sherlock growled, crossing his arms.
“That…you don’t have to do that.” I say, but I can’t help smile back. Victor seems like a really nice guy. A little strange, but nice.
"Oh, yes," Sherlock nodded. "I would like that very much."
“I’ve been looking for some of these everywhere! Our romantic getaway was this weekend, and I was unable to find a single pair. I had to improvise.” He lied easily. “Thank you so much!”
"After I...no, that was just luck."
“Don’t worry, John. You look fine.” Sherlock tells me, and I grin in response. I figure that even if I wasn’t allowed to like Sherlock, I could still look at him.
John’s jaw dropped slightly when the ‘doctor’ said his name, then he shook himself, smiling ruefully at his forgetfulness. Of course the ‘doctor’ would know his name.
“Thank you, Doctor Watson.”
It only took me eight and a half minutes to get to Greg’s house, though it helps that I was walking faster than normal, and I cut through a few yards. I was met with instant sympathy, and I hated every second of it.
Sheol sucked in a breath, looking down at the young Emperor with wonder. He had never been loved before, and it was a marvellous feeling.
“Mine too.” I reply with a smile. “’Happy Christmas John. Your best friend, Victor Trevor.’ How sweet of him.”
“You really want me to believe that you are a demon?” John asked, barely suppressing a giggle. “That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.”
"Because, I know who wrote the note," Irene smiled innocently.
"I...well, that is to say, what I meant was-" Sherlock stuttered rather inelegantly, jumping when his phone in his pocket rang. He fished it out, wincing slightly when he saw Molly's name. "I should take this. Sorry."
I call the police before leaving Victor’s party, letting them know about the body in an anonymous tip. I shot Sherlock a text, letting him know that there was a perfectly good body outside that he could look at, warning him that I called Scotland Yard, and that they should be there soon. He never replied.
“Just do as I say!” Victor snaps, cutting Sebastian off. Sebastian looks imploringly at Victor, who in turn ignores him. When Sarah Sawyer, the emcee for the event, announces their act, however, he moves where Victor demanded him too, looking more than downtrodden.
"Oh, don't you try to deflect on me," Molly said. "What is it that you know about Tom's date?"
Our plans started the day after the Halloween party. Victor had been complaining all week that his hair was looking less shiny than normal, something we all worked to vehemently deny at every opportunity. It worked to Greg, Mike and I’s advantage, however. Grabbing an empty container from my house, we filled it with foot crème. The packaging was written in Farsi, which was easy enough to play off. I brought the container to school the next day, and I was immediately cornered by Jim Moriarty.
“That would be marvellous.” Sherlock said, “Are you sure it wouldn’t be too much excitement for you?”
Sherlock cheeks flushed as he pointedly looked everywhere but John. "You promised."
"That's true," The boy said. "Were you in need of an owl? Gustav will help you."
I love you all. I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“No, listen to me.” John cut him off. “You can’t believe people that would say that about you, alright? You’re so much more special than that.”
Several more slaves came and went, not a single one to Sherlock’s liking. Most were deemed too stupid for the genius, others too disagreeable. It was on Sherlock’s twenty-first birthday that the Holmes family decided that Sherlock should pick out a slave for himself.
"Oh, fine." Sherlock rolled his eyes. "If you and John have a grand old time, I'll agree to an insipid dated. Happy?"
"You...that is to say...you..." Sherlock stuttered.
“Yes it is.” Sherlock said, a smug look on his face. “And you enjoy my presence, do you not?”
"No?" Sherlock looked amused. "You're an ex-soldier, and not just a soldier, but a doctor too. You're not close to your family, but you'd do anything for them."
“Another death?” I ask.
"Piss off," Sherlock answered. "Though I don't know if that's to my deductions, or to my being a demon."
Victor smiles at me, pulling me into a hug. “Oh, Johnny! I knew you wouldn’t be mad. I mean, Sherlock and I make the
It was as if the young man was glowing. The aura was powerful, and Sheol had the desire to reach out and touch, to feel the glow of Abel. Peeling off a glove, Sheol walked over slowly, transfixed by the warmth. He bent down, placing his hand gently over the brightest part of the glow, right in the centre of his chest.
"Irene..." John warned.
"Okay, what do you know?" Molly asked, resignation in her voice.
“Is that supposed to mean something?” Sherlock asked, causing a grunt of indignation to come from the little human.
"Nice to meet you," the boy said, pulling the letter out of Sherlock's hand while he was distracted. "I'm Victor Trevor. Second year Ravenclaw."
“So romantic!” Violet sighed happily, and John pulled back, his face flushing brilliantly. “Oh, look at you two, blushing like two teenagers!”
And that is where everything went to hell.
“You will?” Sherlock’s eyebrows rose, and John felt momentarily pleased at being able to surprise the demon. “Your sister was right. How very wonderful for her, not so much for you.”
“Oh…Um, I’m John Watson.” I say quickly, turning back to Victor. “I just moved here a few weeks ago from Afghanistan.”
"No," John replied, hitting at the window.
“Thank you,” John said with a laugh. “I’ll be here all week.”
"Sherlock?" John interrupted him softly. "I would very much like to kiss you again, if that's alright with you."
"What do you mean, I don't like you?" Sherlock asked in confusion.
“You don’t get together with your family.” Sherlock reminded him, causing John to laugh.
“I find you fascinating.” John had said, leaving Sherlock completely flustered. He had vanished, unsure of what else he could do at that point. John couldn’t find him fascinating, not how he found John fascinating, at least.
"So...what? You're going to kill me now, too?" I challenge, adrenaline racing through my veins.
“You were supposed to call me last night.” A deep voice says. Sebastian glares at Carl, who gives the tall blond a weak grin.
“Anyone in the area will be in danger of getting shot.”
"Why what?" John countered.
“Well, Victor does this thing…it’s completely ridiculous, but he thinks he’s being funny…” Sherlock began. “He…well, he likes to joke that I’ve kidnapped him, and he really get into the act. Sometimes he doesn’t know when to stop. I know it’s silly, but could you just laugh and play along a little bit? He’ll feel so much better.”
“I’m not Victor.” John said flatly, stepping away from Sherlock’s hand. “I’ve been kidnapped!”
“A gift?” Abel wondered, “What could we give The Shining One that he doesn’t have already?”
"Er...I dunno. Who?" John asked.
John turned to look at Sherlock, a soft smile on his face. "Listen, I did have fun."
"Yer beautifullll," the bloke slurs, dragging out the 'l'.
expect this. Bravo."
"Oh my god, Sherlock. Is everything alright?" She asked, rushing over to him.
“I don’t think I’ve been in here more than once.” Sherlock mused, watching John as he spread the blanket across the glossy wood floors. “There is a sofa behind you.”
Sherlock cursed, climbing out of the ship and inspecting it for damage. A few scratches curved along the front of the pod-ship, but otherwise, it seemed unharmed.
John had said.
" Sherlock hissed, red tail lashing in irritation.
“I’ve never seen you take such an avid interest in a mortal before.” Greg’s voice floated from behind him, and Sherlock turned to glare. “Not even with your name-sakes, or Otto.”
"I'm not so sure," Sherlock said eyeing the owl with trepidation.
“By telling her that her mouth was too small without lipstick.” John looked over at Sherlock in disbelief, ready to tell him off before catching sight of his tail, horns, and claws. “Right…it’s none of my business, is it, Master?”
“I am known as the arc-angel Gabriel.” He says softly. “But you may call me Greg.”
“I’m not.” I say slowly.
Sherlock beamed at him, then turned around, leaving the room. John pulled on some jeans and a jumper, pleased that his headache was going away.
Sherlock smiled at him, flopping down into the rectangle bed. “You are most hospitable.” He complimented.
“I think I would remember you,” John replied, giving him an easy smile.
"Would you like to see some more?" Sherlock couldn't keep the corner of his lips from curling in amusement.
“You could have been more polite to her.” John said as soon as they left the morgue, remembering the distraught look on the human female’s face when Sherlock had rudely shot down her offer for coffee.
Sherlock hadn't spoken with John since he had gotten sorted, but that was to be expected. They weren't in the same house, or in the same year, so their paths never really crossed. So when John pulled Sherlock aside in the library, it was most surprising to say the least.
“Is it your intention to drive me crazy?”
Sherlock and John made their way back to the halls and into Sherlock's room.  Sherlock showed John all the experiments he had already set up and explained what he was trying to prove with each one.  John was fascinated and even provided a new hypothesis for Sherlock to test on one of them.  When they’d finished John looked towards the door.
“Joooooohnnnn.”
There was some low muttering, but everyone picked up their bits and pieces and headed out.  Freddie had pulled Jasmine to her feet and was walking out with his arm around her shoulder.  She held her hand to her face as if everything was just too much.  Stacey followed closely behind, making the most of this opportunity to spend time with Jasmine, regardless of how temporary it probably was.  Sherlock nudged John to look at the eye-rolling going on between most of the rest of the cast.  It seemed no-one was taken in by Jasmine's display.  A few of them announced they were going to go and see Matthew; the person who had an actual injury from the afternoon, discussing it loudly as they passed Jasmine and Freddie.
"Don't." John said, commanding his attention with just the one word. "I meant what I said before. This has been the best Christmas I have ever had."
Sherlock could smell the intrigue in the human’s blood, and he knew that playing a long game of cat-and-mouse would bore the both of them. Pushing himself away from the bar, Sherlock gave Lestrade a long, hard look before striding away. It only took two seconds before the human began to follow.
nervous, you know, to lessen the tension?”
happened, for all the fuss Sherlock had made that morning.
“That’s so kind of you, but really, I couldn’t ask you to-”
"Yes. He would...that's Johnny..." Harriet nodded emphatically. "Please."
“There, a kiss.” Sherlock said quickly, looking flustered.
“I know.” Sebastian growls. “But it
“Of course, dear.” Mrs Hudson giggled, patting David on the arm. “I’ll be downstairs if you need anything.”
“Victor’s coming.” I whisper, “Quick. Get out of here!”
A short, mousy brunette stops me halfway to the cooler, a small smirk on his face.
“Oh, there’s no need to be nervous!” Father chuckled. “We’re excited to meet your boyfriend!”
The soft squeak of Molly's trainers were the only sound that filled the morgue. Normally she would fill the silence with inane chatter, but a poorly timed comment about the sexuality of her previous partners had left her acting particularly frosty towards Sherlock.
“They’re not-
The sorting hat chuckled once again.
-Horace
"Right," John stands, tugging at the hem of the new Christmas sweater. "Well, I had planned on doing this in private, but I think now is as good a time as any."
Sherlock had seen Hogwarts in pictures, of course; His entire family had been to school there, after all, but there was something different seeing it in real life. Windows glittered cheerfully across the walls of the stone castle, reflecting on the surface of the lake below.  Towers rose up towards the sky, giving the castle an imposing look, and Sherlock could see that the large doors had been opened in greeting.
Sherlock walked around the table to sit in the empty chair next to John, who was heaping Yorkshire pudding onto his plate.
“It’s ridiculous.”
"No, of course not," Sherlock replied, the corner of his mouth lifting in a small smirk.
Ch. 6
“Oh hush, Sherlock.” Violet sighed, patting his shoulder. “This is the attitude you always had with your childhood…er…well, they weren’t friends…”
," Tom explained. "Now
Sheol didn’t need to be told twice. Turning on his heel, he darted out of the angel’s office. Mycroft watched him go, not realising that he wouldn’t see the man for another thousand years.
“Delirium brought on by the drugs?” Hudson's voice is weak, but rough.
Robottko
“Simple?” John asked. “Like what?”
Before John had any time to react, the demon shifted, pressing his lips against his roughly, his hand clasping the back of the human’s neck to keep him in place. John’s hands fisted in the collar of the demon’s coat, clinging to him as they vanished in a puff of black smoke.
? Sherlock mumbled.
me, and he’s holding me hostage!”
"Oh, for God's sake. Kiss you two!" Molly said, laughing to herself. Sherlock sent her a half-hearted glare, which she returned in kind.
"Maybe I like you a little less composed," John said.
“Ah, brother mine.” A voice said, and Sherlock looked round to see Mycroft standing there, a lit cigarette in hand.
"I didn’t
“If he had hurt you worse, he wouldn’t have left this room,” Sherlock mutters, giving my hand a squeeze.
“Good afternoon.” A silky female voice said from behind him, and Sherlock turned around in surprise. There, just behind the counter, stood a brunet girl around the age of twenty four. Her lips were painted a vibrant red, and her hair was coiled in a perfect bun. “Can I help you with anything today?”
happy that you’ve found someone, Sherlock!”
"Of course we will, darling!" Violet said, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's forehead. "Even if you're a Gryffindor. You'll be the best there was."
“Getting to know each other?” I was confused. Did they talk turning class?
“Sherlock!” I call at the end of the day on Friday, running to catch up to the curly-haired brunet. He gives me a wary glance, but he stops.
Sherlock froze as he watched his boyfriend walk towards him, his bespoke suit making him stand out uncomfortable among the rest of the coffee shop patrons. Victor was taller than Sherlock, maybe about six foot two, and thick brown hair that most people were jealous of. A bright, false smile showed off his straight teeth, and Sherlock knew that whatever Victor had to say wasn’t going to be good.
It didn’t take them very long to carry their belongings upstairs. The Watson men had never been much for a plethora of belongings. Anything they didn’t need, or that didn’t have sentimental value, was left in their old house for the new owners to have.
“Not really.” John sniffed. “I just don’t approve of dragon elitism.”
I laughed, running a hand through my hair, annoyed when it came back sticky.
Sherlock waited until she was out of sight before entering the building, looking around at the other customers.
John thought savagely, the pounding in his head getting worse.
"See you then." John waved, then made his way towards the changing rooms. Sherlock waved back, a bit belatedly.
"If you need assistance, I would be more than happy to help," Sherlock cut him off quickly, hoping that he was pulling off his normal aloof expression and not the dopey eyed look he got when John happened to pass by him in the corridors.
"Optimistic," Tom returned. "And with that, I must be off. Potential soulmates to meet, after all."
Of course, just because blonds had been given freedom didn’t make them completely free. Their new laws allowed for loopholes. If a blond committed a crime, they could be sold as a slave once more. Sherlock should have known something was wrong when he saw the smug look on Mycroft’s face.
“Is that not what we’re doing now?” He asks, and Victor grins at him.
“Victor seems charming.” Mummy said after a minute, a bright smile on her face. “Oh, I am
"Because he became boring," Jim replies almost cheerfully. "He is brilliant, almost as brilliant as me, but he decided to side with the
After all, there was no way he could remain a slave forever.
"Oh, don't play dumb with me, Sherlock Holmes," Molly said. "We have been friends for nearly five years. I know you better than that. You only put on that innocent air when you're hiding something. And you forgot to pretend you didn't know Tom's name."
"Why did you call off your wedding?"
I shoot the black haired boy a tight smile, and it’s apparently convincing enough, because Jim continues to talk. “I mean, it isn’t really his fault. Victor’s, I mean. He’s just so good looking, so all the boys and girls in the school want him. Who could blame them? But he still feels guilty.”
"You put it on because of the cold..." John said slowly, as if coming to a realization.
"I am Sherlock Holmes." Sherlock replied, burying his head in one of his books to hide his flush. John had
"Yes, John. Do keep up," Sherlock replied, steepling his fingers beneath his chin.
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful comments. You all brighten my day so much. As always, tell me what you think, any mistakes you find, or suggestions you have.
“In love with someone else?” Sherlock repeated.
Sherlock was entirely unsure of what to make of it.
Eventually, watching John on his telescope wasn't enough. John was spending less time at his home, and more time with other humans. They spent time in strange buildings and kicking strange objects, and Sherlock's curiosity got the better of him.
lost her fiancé, after all.
"That's not what people normally say," Sherlock admitted, burying his face in a book to hide his reddening face.
Boy, was I wrong.
Instead of responding, Sherlock reached over and snatched the confession picture out of John's hands, the corners ripping slightly. He took out a pen, scribbling something on the paper before handing it back to John.
The door to Sherlock's compartment slid open, and Sherlock looked up to see a girl around his own age, her brown hair twisted back into a pony tail and a nervous expression on her face.
“Yes, well, you’re stuck here until Christmas.” Sherlock sighed. “You might as well enjoy yourself.”
“What in the hell do you think you are doing?” A deep voice said behind him, and John jumped, his glass falling to the floor and shattering. He whipped around, staring in disbelief at the sight in front of him.
He could feel the train beginning to slow down, and with one last glance at Sherlock, he began winding his way to the doors. They slid open immediately, and John quickly exited, walking quickly for the underground exit.
“I’m not angry at him.” I chuckle, shaking my head.
“The one you boil potatoes in?” Sherlock frowned. “Last year it got melted in an
“Er…hello, you must be the…ah…doctors?” John asked, his voice rough from disuse. He cleared his throat as he looked at the people garbed in long robes, each a different colour. They were all tall and pale, dark hair cascading from their heads. High cheekbones and strong jaw’s suggested that they all had a common family member, though John wasn’t positive that they
“They didn’t know.” Sherlock said quickly, “They had no idea that Victor was actually John.”
“Sounds perfect, dear.” Father said, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
“But you’ve been busy.” John replied. “Solving murders, saving lives. God, but it’s impressive. I just lost my job at the A&E.”
Cain huffs a laugh, grabbing a hold of Sheol’s shoulder, pulling him in the direction Cain had just come from. “You know Abel and I cannot leave mother and father! They need our help caring for the young ones, ploughing the fields and tending to the animals…” Cain frowns, a wistful look appearing on his face. “Perhaps, when the young ones are old enough to help, we can adventure.”
Sherlock would never admit it, but he felt a glowing sense of pride at the comparison. Mycroft may be insufferable, but he was also intelligent; something Sherlock strived to be.
“I would like to try something.” Sheol said as a grin spread across his face. “I believe you to be my soul-mate. If this is true, you should be safe from my curse.”
“Right. Well, we’ve got the paperwork for human #4721 right here. John Hamish Watson. Male. Age twenty five. Status: extremely dangerous.” The handler said, pulling out John’s file with a flourish. “Sign on the dotted line on page two please. And remember, there is no refunds on this human.”
"Your wife. Did she leave you for her personal trainer, or her boss?" Sherlock repeated.
John blinks at Sherlock a few times in surprise before bursting out into laughter. "Oh, you absolute madman."
“I’m not a nice person.” Sherlock agreed softly. “But my mother is happy. That is my only intention in all of this. As soon as Christmas is over, I’ll never darken your doorstep again.”
"Do I know you?" John asked, unable to keep the flirtation out of his voice.
"What if they used a gun to make it look like a human had done it?" John asked, moving closer to the body.
“I will.” John waved goodnight to his father, heading to his room. He opened the door for the first time, carrying his unpacked box and setting it down with an almighty thump. He turned around, barely remembering to stifle a shout when he saw someone already sitting in his bed, reading what looked like a century’s old book. John thanked the heavens that he didn’t yell; the translucent skin and 18
“Maybe if you had tried harder, The Shining One would have liked your gift better!” Abel yelled, ignoring Sheol.
Of course, it was obvious now that the whole thing had been in his imagination. The tall pale figure clad in a dark coat would have stood out in the Afghani desert. No, his mind had merely played tricks on him as he lay dying.
"Is that like a private detective?" John asked.
"Yes," Sherlock said simply.
“Yeah, fine.” I laugh, shaking my head slowly. “Do either of you own any green shirts?”
“You’ll love it here, Johnny.” A feminine voice said from behind him, and John turned quickly, a smile on his face. “You’ve always wanted to live in London.”
“But you
"Jim?" John asked, raising an eyebrow. "I haven't actually been pursuing him. That's all on his end."
“Oh, lord. Not the feather story.” Mycroft sighed as he came out of sitting room, his face pinched. Violet and Siger followed him, looking much merrier than their eldest son at Sherlock’s laughter.
The next day at lunch, John sat down next to Sherlock at the Ravenclaw table, causing a majority of the Great Hall to stop and stare.
"Go ahead, then," Watson said.
Sherlock looks confused for a brief second, bringing a cigarette to his lips and lighting it with a quick flick of a small lighter. His expression clears, and he rolls his eyes at me.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” I reply instantaneously. Does Victor know that I’m currently hanging out with Sherlock? That I’m friends with Greg and Mike, who completely hate him?
“Yes, John?” Sherlock asked, following the angry sounds his flatmate was making, discovering him standing in front of the freezer, door flung open, and a baggie in his hand.
"I did say it was psychosomatic," Sherlock reminded him softly. "Apparently you needed enough a distraction to forget."
Sherlock thought to himself.
"I...would. Thank you." Sherlock smiled at John, who beamed back.
The vampire quickly shut his straying thoughts down, focusing on the rich smell of blood that was oh so willingly following him down the tiny alleys. The copper smell mixed nicely with a hint of scotch and pinecones; not an unusual smell, but definitely a break from the mundane. Sherlock sucked in a deep breath before turning on Lestrade, pinning him against the dirty brick wall of the alley.
“You’re insufferable.” Sherlock sneered at his brother, clipping the leash onto John’s collar. “Come along, John. We have to stop at the morgue before we go home. I want to pick up a sampling of human toes.”
“Right.”
The metal pinched John’s skin as he slid the collar off, but he ignored the slight pain, latching the collar onto a nearby pole. Sherlock would notice his absence eventually, but hopefully not before John was far, far away.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
"And I'm not a pet!" John snapped.
He had heard his mother say to his father while they were washing up.
“That was the best our routine has ever gone!” Jim said, clapping happily as soon as we’ve gotten backstage. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Sherlock Holmes join us, standing next to Victor, but not touching him. He seems rather put out about something, but before I can figure out what it is, Sarah Sawyer’s voice catches my attention.
Sherlock snorted out a laugh before turning to John. "May I? Kiss you, that is."
"You don't believe this, do you?" John asked, horrified. "Sherlock...motives. What motives do I have?"
"An inlet just off the coast of Hastings," John replied, settling down on the sand next to him.
He grabbed a pipette, drawing a drop of blood from a blood-bag and transferring it to the container of water. The men and vampire watched as the blood fell from the pipette, swirling in with the water below.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Anyone who wasn’t blind could observe the signs. Your hair is cropped short, in an overgrown military style haircut. You have a tan, but it doesn’t extend above your wrists. You had a cane with you at the coffee shop, but when you walked up to the counter, you had forgotten it behind. Not on purpose, of course. When you walk, you have a slight limp, so you have a psychosomatic limp. The way you’re holding your shoulder indicates a fairly recent injury to it. Not recent enough that it would still be bleeding, but recently scarred over. So, by simple deduction, you are a soldier recently invalided from Afghanistan.”
"Well, that sounds boring," John said.
“Guys…I’ll call you back.” I tell them slowly, hanging up my mobile and sliding it in my pocket. No matter how angry I am at Victor Trevor, there are some things that can’t be ignored.
Dr John Watson and Miss Mary Morstan are pleased to announce their engagement, and are to be married the 14th of February of this year.
pointed out that he was gay, and had you listened to me, you wouldn't be quite so upset."
-Otto III (June, 980-January 23, 1002) became King of Germany at the early age of three, though several people served as regent until he reached adult hood at the age of 14. In 996 he became both the King of Italy and the Holy Roman Emperor as well. He died in the Civita Castellana (approximately 65 km north of Rome) from fever complications. He had no spouse, and no heirs.
"Yeah, but this one had a bad flavour. Almost like...you know when you get hit with a jinx, and you have a bad flavour in your mouth after?"
"I just talked to a friend of yours," John said by way of greeting. Sherlock looked over at him, surprised by how ruffled he seemed.
"That ghost boy that was following you," Sherlock said. "He looked practically murderous, and I don't think it's wise for you to be around him."
Sherlock stopped to take in the scene in front of him, eyes sweeping along the pavement, taking in the dark blood on the concrete. There was a flower pot that was shattered nearby, somewhere around where the victims head would have been, and a lone shoe nearby. A movement out of the corner of Sherlock’s eye caught his attention, and he looked up to see a harried looking detective inspector running a hand through his silver-grey hair. Just one glance at his face and Sherlock could tell he had come to the wrong conclusion about the murder.
"Once we're done, I'll have Mrs Hudson cook you a big breakfast," Sherlock muttered distractedly, "Now, quiet."
"John?" Sherlock asked dumbly. "I thought you were with Tom?"
“Mom would want us to be happy.” John said knowledgably.
Of course, he should have predicted that gravity worked different on this strange new planet. He expected it to have been stronger, so his pod-ship came crashing down in a loud bang.
“I would like for you to kiss me.” Sheol said softly, his pale face going slightly pink. “I believe it would be mutually beneficial. And perhaps if you began the contact and you aren’t my soul-mate, then you might be spared.”
“Ah, Sherlock, you’re awake.” Violet beamed at her son. “Do you know what I did with my large stockpot?”
Ch. 2
“You think so?” Sherlock looks pleased.
“How-”
“Wait…” The blond turned to look at Sherlock, anger and confusion on his face. “You’re attempting to
"They're
“To whom does he belong?” A male asked, dark hair sweeping across his eyes.
"Another student has gone missing," McGonagall said as soon as she saw Madam Pince.
John slapped Sherlock’s hand away, annoyed as the demon chuckled in response before stepping away. He sat up, rubbing absentmindedly where Sherlock’s hand had been.
About a month after the
"God, not again." John groaned, grabbing Jim's lapels and tugged him into a standing position.  "Come on!"
They made it to their room without further incident. Sherlock shut the door, leaning against the wood for support.
That earned him an odd look from John, and Sherlock reminded himself to keep his emotions in check. After all, they weren't incorrect. John was a very attractive merman, and he really couldn't be annoyed just because other people agreed with him.
“Hmm.” Sherlock hummed, flopping back down on his rather uncomfortable bed. “By all means.”
Sherlock made his way towards the team, feeling more awkward than ever. The rain had abated, thankfully, and Sherlock folded it down, clutching it at his side.
"What?" Sherlock peeked at him out of the corner of his eye.
to put the angel on top of the tree, Mrs Holmes.” John beamed at her, and she smiled back radiantly, handing the delicate angel over to him.
“I am an angel, a warrior of The Shining One. Cain, you have murdered your brother.”
"So what do you suggest?" One of the scientists asked, adjusting her glasses slightly.
“I have no use for a slave.” Sherlock hissed, ignoring Watson. “I don’t want one.”
“Victor is cheating on you, though.” I shake my head. Sherlock doesn’t look remotely surprised by my revelation, however.
He unlocked the phone, grinning when he saw he had full reception, and he quickly typed in a familiar number, listening impatiently as it rang.
reason that you’re aren’t going to spend five more years in prison.” She continued fiercely. “If it were up to me, you would be in there for a long time.”
“I mean, I should have gotten a candy cane.” Sebastian continues. “I was the one who suggested he wear platforms when he complained that he was too short. It made him three inches taller!”
Sherlock said nothing more as he and his family were lead out to the police cars. With the glare that Mycroft was shooting him, and the gold band on his ring finger that felt tighter by the second, Sherlock knew that it was going to be a long night.
Finding Victor is easy as his early morning routine is always the same. I find him camped out in the nicest boy’s lavatory. He’s brushing away at his brown hair, trying to make it stick up the way he wants. I hold out the bottle of foot crème to him, and he shoots me a surprised look.
"That's alright," Sherlock said, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. "There's a nice Italian place on Northumberland Street. The owner owes me a favour."
"And where do you get your statistics from, Mr Holmes?" Tom asked, grinning when Sherlock was unable to answer. "Look, Molly knows me. She knows what I like. I trust her."
"No, listen," I shush him, dragging him closer to the wall. "Sebastian was mad at Carl Powers that first day. You know, when he flirted with me? They had just been on a date, and suddenly he was flirting with me."
"Of course not!" Tom said, grinning. "It's not too often that you get to beat Sherlock Holmes!"
"Who are you playing?"
“Naturally not. He’s coming home.” Mycroft said, flicking imaginary dust off his clothes.
“You’re going to turn me?” Stamford gasped.
“You were fantastic today, John,” A female voice said brightly.
“My children.” The Shining One said, his voice low and warm. “It is wonderful to see you.”
“Well, it looks like my Christmas wish came true.”
I walk away before Sherlock can say anything else. Not once to I turn and look back, but I swear I can feel Sherlock’s eyes assessing me as I leave, his gaze pinned to my figure before I turn a corner and am out of his sight.
"So you don't want me to tell you?" Irene asked, looking amused.
"Sherlock is the angel of death, but without life, there is no death, and without death, we never truly learn to live," The Shining One placed a hand on John, who began to glow a pure light. "So, my child, you shall balance out death, with life."
Sherlock could see that an attack was coming, and he steeled himself to take a punch, but it never came. Instead, he watched as the blond pulled back to punch him, the ice under his feet making it impossible to stay upright, and he crashed to the ground with a nasty sounding crack.
“Let’s just say my expensive down pillows were completely ruined.” Violet said, a small grin on her face. Her smile got wider as John stopped under the doorframe, and she nudged her husband.
“Yeah, I know.” The officer said, “We think someone came to get them.”
"That I would have much more success in relationships if I didn't constantly try to date gay men," She finished, looked harried. "Yes, you've pointed that out numerous times before."
“I’ll leave a salad or something out for him.” John teased. “With all that sugar, he’s going to need something solid in his stomach.”
“Nah,” John grinned. “You just got lucky enough to be stuck with me.”
"No," John backed away, the glint of handcuffs sending a sharp stab of panic through him. "I didn't do anything."
"Could you address me as Tom?" Sherlock asked, stepping back to properly look at Angelo. "It's a...a social experiment to see how...err...how dates react to various names."
Before John could even blink, the handler was snapping a metal collar around his neck. He let out a small growl at the handler, who promptly took a step back.
“Great!” Victor says, his already large grin growing bigger. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
Sherlock bursts out laughing, and I can’t help but join him. We clutch our sides, trying desperately to breathe.
“That implies that you like someone now.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
"What do people normally say?" John asked.
On this day, August 31st, in 1990, a child by the name of Robottko was born. It was decreed that every year on her birthday, she shall update every fanfiction that is a WIP. So, it is with great honor that I present to you this update.
"I thought we needed to have a little chat." Greg said, sighing softly. "It's to do with a mutual friend."
"You know what I mean," Sherlock bit out. "I assume you've come to try and get John to spy on me too, yeah?"
“Anyway, I was calling to confirm the seating order.” Mummy continued. “Victor is still coming to our winter estate for Christmas, correct?”
I let out a small snort, and Sherlock returns it with a grin. Maybe we had a lot to worry about, but for just this moment in time, grinning up at Sherlock like a complete idiot, I felt I could truly be happy.
"And Sherlock?"
“Yoo-hoo!” She called, waving at him. “You must be John!”
John looked up at Sherlock, and sure enough, his face was a matching shade of scarlet. “Oh, you know how it is, Violet. Every kiss with him is like a first kiss.”
It's finally finished! I am so excited that I was able to share this story with you. I got the idea a few days before Christmas last year, and my entire year has been spent writing this story. I am so blessed by the wonderful people that have reviewed and given kudos and the whole works. You all make my heart sing, I swear. I hope you have a merry Christmas, and that you enjoy this last little gift from me.
“That won’t work.” Sherlock said as soon as he opened the door, watching the blond jolt. He snapped on both cuffs before untying the scarf expertly. “But a good escape attempt anyway.”
“No, John, let me speak! You never called, texted, or anything!”
“What do you mean you can’t make it?” Sherlock asked, ignoring the agitated customer who was trying to snatch the coffee cup that he was clutching tightly in his hands. “You promised you would come!”
“Sherly!” Victor chirped, ignoring the full-bodied wince that always accompanied his horrible nickname. “Listen, I have some bad news. I can’t make it to your parents’ estate this Christmas.”
, you prat!”
“I shall consider you my soul-mate even if I pass on.” He said, leaning forward to press his lips to Sheol’s.
"Tom!" She cried, "Oh, you look marvellous."
wrong.
“Quite. He’s rather brilliant.” Mycroft said, and if Sherlock didn’t know any better, he would say his brother admired the blond. “Of course, we need to assign him a master. His punishment for the crimes he has committed will be a lifetime of slavery.”
“What happened to him?”
Sherlock felt momentarily stunned. This strange being was being…kind to him. It was something he was unused to, and he wasn’t sure how to respond.
The creature appeared to be male, judging by the lack of mammary glands and traditional masculine features. (
“Hello, John Watson.”
John laughed, causing a funny wriggling feeling to begin in Sherlock’s stomach. He would have to look up symptoms for different illnesses as soon as he arrived home, because clearly he was coming down with something.
"It's
Sherlock was thinking much too hard about this, it seemed. Apparently the universe agreed with him, for that was the moment that mummy decided to poke her head in, grinning at the two of them brightly.
"No, you never think, do you?" I cut Victor off, feeling annoyed.
"This is a kidnapping?" Sherlock asked, unsure if he wanted to laugh or cry. "Why are you kidnapping me when you should be going on your sex holiday?"
“I have school in the morning.” John said, yawning. “I’m going to head to bed.”
“He will not awaken.” A quite voice said. Sheol and Cain looked up to see a man standing over them.
“You’re an idiot.” Sherlock said, stalking out of the room.
“Tomorrow.” Sherlock promised him, standing up. “I’ll play for you tomorrow."
“I don’t see why any of this concerns Father.” Sherlock replied. “I did not take John Watson, I did not force him to come with me. I explained to him the facts, and he left with me willingly.”
She looked from John to Sherlock, confusion flitting across her face, followed by understanding, then anger.
"Yeah," John agreed, clutching at his chest to calm his racing heart. "Waking up, though..."
"Maybe I wanted to show off my boyfriend a bit, hm?" John asked.
"Why?" Sherlock couldn't keep himself from asking.
Sherlock trailed after him, ducking behind street cars and carriages as he went.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, allowing himself a bit of ogling disguised as observing before beginning his deductions. John would hate him after this, and he wouldn't get the luxury of observing him anymore.
"It is a real job," Sherlock insisted, feeling humiliated.
"That might be your only option," Sherlock says wisely, before stiffening. "I see Moran and Moriarty. Excuse me."
right now.
"It was a simple case," Sherlock said modestly. "It only took me an hour to solve."
“They mentioned that in the report?” John muttered.
"My responsibilities?" John all but squeaked.
the eye roll from Sherlock. “I would have done the same thing if it were a female dragon. Sentiment is foolish, and women are not my area.”
"I came all the way to Bart's to complain to Molly," Sherlock snorted. "Of course I love you."
Sherlock wondered as the other first years fell in line.
“Flirted with you during the Christmas talent show.” Sherlock finishes, a hard look on his face.
“Well, I wish to hear a few songs.” John said.
"I insist," John interrupted. "Least I can do."
a real job," Sherlock insisted, feeling humiliated.
John had not been expecting someone to be waiting for him when he walked past his favourite bench on a rare sunny afternoon. He was lost in thought, despondent after his many failed attempts at talking to a certain angel, when a voice broke through his musings.
"Nonsense, John. There's a crime here waiting to be solved."
“No no!” Abel stops in front of them, winded from his run. “He’s visiting us with good tidings!”
“I am up here, Cain.” Sheol chuckles, and Cain looks up both startled and relieved. “You are acting as if I had ran away.”
The door opened, and Mummy poked her head out, a smile on her face.
Two years after discovering the existence of Doctor Watson, Sherlock was still unable to figure out the secret behind the man. He was a man of solitude, and a man who had many friends. He was cheerful, sombre, snarky and polite. This was a man of many facets, all coming together to create a cohesive whole. Sherlock couldn’t get enough.
Molly had been having a nice dinner with Tom when the police arrived at her door. Tom was, of course, very confused. Not that Molly wasn’t, of course, but when they mentioned Sherlock’s name, she could hardly bothered to be surprised.
“A doctor?” Sherlock frowned, “A brunet has been working for the blond rebellion?”
"You should let your hair grow out," John commented, watching him. "You'd look good with curls. The women would love it."
She gave Mycroft a pointed look. Mycroft, for his part, accidentally dropped a rather large portion of potatoes on his plate, of which some spilled over onto the table. He cleared his throat rather nervously before speaking.
“Obvious, John. I’m going to your house.” He quips, his thumbs flying across the buttons on his mobile.
“I could run out and get a larger pot.” John replied innocently, earning a beam from Violet and a panicked glare from Sherlock.
He had just heard those three words, words that he had been thinking himself for months, come from the mouth of the person he loved most in the world. His brain was working overdrive. He couldn't believe it.
"I love you."
The second the lock clicked shut, Sholto stood up, and growled, "Watson, don't make a sound, or I will boot you. And obey me or I'll shoot you." Shocked and more than a little nervous, I looked up and saw that previously kind eyes, which I had almost grown to f***ing love, had turned absolutely feral.
The Christmas holidays were rapidly approaching and neither boy was particularly happy thinking about all that time they would be forced to be apart.  John was going up to Scotland with his mum and sister five days before Christmas to stay with his grandparents.  Then they were coming home on Boxing Day morning as his mum had a party organised by her work which she had to attend that night.
"I suppose it's not the worst thing in the world."
“Sher…, I’m…”
“Sherlock!”  John couldn’t stop the smile that half formed before he sat up straight again, needing answers before he went further.  “Have you killed anyone?”
“No.  Tickles.”
"Only if you also drank a significant amount of my blood and were near death at the time.  I have never had the inclination to do that to anyone before but I find myself to be not averse to the idea of gaining your immortality if it was ever something you wanted too.  I would never force this upon you, John, and there would need to be intense consideration of the whole subject on your part before any decisions were made unless it was a life or death situation and it meant I would lose you.  In that situation, unless you had let it be known that you sincerely objected to being made a vampire at all then I think I would turn you.  I find myself unable to contemplate my future without you, John, and I think if your life ended then so, too, would mine."
"You gave me a wrong answer, John.  If you want more then you know what you have to do."
"What do they usually say?"
"I'm glad you approved, my liege," John laughed and gave the imitation of a bow from his supine position.  "You'd certainly have no arguments from me about that.  I loved waking up with you in my arms, and what we just did was inspired; what made you think of that?"
“That means nothing.  If you’d seen some of the officers I’ve observed...”
When the bus pulled up in front of him, he stepped back from the kerb as it slowed - though he wasn’t really sure why he bothered, a bit more water could do nothing to make things worse now.  The driver looked at him doubtfully as if he wasn’t sure if he wanted to allow this drowned rat on his bus.  John was taking no chances on being refused though; he was straight on there and marched down to the nearest free seat before the driver could change his mind.  The lady he sat next to edged even closer to the window, clearly not wanting to be anywhere near this wet mass dripping on her seat.  She quickly got to her feet when she, thankfully, neared her own stop, squeezing carefully around him, and nobody else bothered him to try and take the vacant space.
John leaned in closer at that point and whispered in Simon's ear for a few moments.  Sherlock couldn't hear what John was saying.  However, he could see the colour draining from Simon's face and the way his eyes widened and his jaw dropped in shock.  As John pulled back, Simon quickly stepped away and flushed a bright red, as he mumbled out a very quiet 'sorry'.
“I’ll try some out and see how they feel.  Maybe a nice handlebar affair?”  John laughed, especially when he saw the appalled look on Sherlock’s face.  It seemed Sherlock preferred his ‘boyfriend’ clean shaven.
Sherlock pulled away, trying to catch his breath as he looked down at the gorgeous man in front of him.  John was finally where he was meant to be - in Sherlock’s room and hopefully, very shortly, in Sherlock’s bed.  From the dilated pupils and racing pulse, Sherlock knew that John wanted him just as much as Sherlock had always hoped.  There was no longer anything or anyone else in their way and Sherlock couldn’t be happier that his dreams had finally come true.  He smiled at John and kissed him on the tip of the nose, before holding out his hand to pull John over towards the bed.
“Brother Dearest, how goes the nation-running?”
“I do, John.  I think I always have; being away from you just brought it home to me how much.”
John put everything carefully back in its assigned place in the case and closed it up, putting it on the floor beside him.  He screwed up all the wrapping paper and pushed it into the box which had contained the skull.  Then he reached forward and curled his finger under Sherlock's collar.
"So, would you like to meet up again tomorrow and see what further adventures we can have?"
“Thank you for that reminder, Mr Doom and Gloom.  Yes I am very grateful to still be here; you are the marvellous, all-seeing, all-doing saviour.”
"You are amazing."
“I sort of don’t know what to do now.  There are so many things I have wanted to do with you - and to you -,” John grinned, “but I have always pushed the thoughts aside so that they wouldn’t damage our friendship and now, with you saying you want it to affect us, I feel a little overwhelmed.”
John grinned at him and pointed to the centre of the bed.  Sherlock wasted no time in stripping off and laying down in the middle of the bed with his head on the pillow.  John, still fully dressed, climbed on top and sat on Sherlock’s hips, rubbing the material gently against Sherlock’s naked groin.  Sherlock groaned, enjoying the decadence of being nude whilst John was fully clothed; it seemed naughtier somehow and started his pulse racing.
Knowing how much he, himself, had wanted Sherlock to touch more intimate parts of him when the detective had been examining his body during a previous session, John took pity on Sherlock and paid a little attention to his groin as well.  He swept his hand across from hip to hip, massaging the oil in to the skin.  He moved all around Sherlock’s balls, coating them and rolling them in his hands sensuously before he slid his hand in a long stroke up one side of Sherlock’s cock and down the other.  He brought it to full attention, circling the head and dipping his finger into the little droplets gathering in the slit.
“What?”
“So, you’re a private detective?”
“Really?  Because I can think of lots of things I would like more – most especially to kiss those lips right now.”  John blinked as if he was shocked he had actually said that.
“Well, I haven’t tried moving around yet to see how the aches and pains are, but I feel quite rested, thanks.  I always sleep better when I share a bed so I must have sensed your presence.”
“Only to which I seriously object - that means you think there is something to which I will object but you don’t consider it an issue?   Hmm, do you want me to guess what that is?”
“He… he will be happy to see me, though, won’t he?” Sherlock seemed unsure all of a sudden on hearing of the anticipated shock.  He realised he hadn’t actually spoken to anyone about anything genuine in the whole time he’d been away. He’d succumbed to the necessary evil of generalised chit-chat with people with whom he’d been forced to interact whilst undercover, but none of it had related to himself.  Now it was hitting home that he could finally be himself again and how that may impact on the people back home.
“Let’s head on up to our rooms and we can spread our friendliness around.”
The boys headed off on a tour of the house with Sherlock showing John all of his favourite secret places for hiding and spying on the others when he was younger.  He passed along stories of adventures he had had and experiments he had carried out in various attics.  There were even a couple of experiments that were still on-going which he checked up on whenever he came home, so he and John did that now, so that Sherlock could record his findings.  He found it nice to have someone to discuss them with for a change.  One more reason, if it were needed, to be glad that John had joined him for the holidays.
“That’s never a good thing”, John smiled at him and Sherlock rolled his eyes in acknowledgement.  “It’s good to see you.  I… I’ve missed you.”
“I didn’t say he wouldn’t want to, just that we should broach the subject more tactfully, but you just carried on in your usual blunt manner.”
“It was obviously the stable cat, which has free roam of the grounds, John.  It pounced upon the frog and gave it a heart attack before pawing over the body, leaving these slight claw marks on its belly as you can clearly see here.”
John gave him an evil grin and waggled his eyebrows which caused them both to burst out laughing.  John climbed off and started stripping off his clothes.  He made a bit a show of it but was too eager to get his hands on Sherlock to take too long.
“You did indeed, I just heard you.”
"Of course, it's still something I want, idiot.  It's just a bit of a shock to take all this on board out of nowhere.  Before we do anything else, though, could we ease my throat?"
“See!  There you go again.  You do it without even thinking.”
“John!  John, you’re ok; you’ll be ok.  Stay with me, John.”  Sherlock could hear the blood bubbling in John’s chest as he struggled to breathe.  Sherlock bent down and shouted in John’s ear.  “Come on, John.  You can’t leave me.”
“Ummm…  Tommy, no, that’s not right…  Toby, no, not that either… TONY!”
I hope you had as much fun reading as I did writing.
“Of course I would still want you.  You’re the most gorgeous thing I’ve ever seen, Sherlock, but it’s not just your looks, it’s your brain too; the whole package really.  I’m not denying you couldn’t use a little more tact and delicacy in dealing with certain people, but I think they’re all wrong in how they think of you.  You’re amazing and, as much as you try to hide it, I know deep down how much you care about things.”
“Sentiment?”
John actually laughed at that as Mycroft looked so resigned and disappointed.
"I think 'crime' is taking things a bit far, but we could certainly go over there and have a look round - maybe in a couple of days, when I am able to move again."
Moran laid his cards out slowly on the table: seven, eight, nine, ten and Jack of hearts.  John schooled his face to show real disappointment.
“I saw his face as you walked in and I just watched yours now when you saw him.  You both have it as bad as each other and this has gone on long enough.”
“Don’t let me disrupt your work, Sherlock.  You don’t have to stay here keeping me company if you need to go and speak to the police.”
“I’ve got a few here, and there are always some spares provided for guests, so that won’t be a problem.”
“That’s nice of you to say, dear, we do our best.  I think, if you look closely, you may even see a decoration that Sherlock made on there.”
"I don't waste my time hanging round with those idiots."
As the evening went on, John kept winning and the pile in front of Moran was slowly shrinking.  Finally John noted that he was flicking the edge of one of his chips with his middle fingernail which was his tell when he had a really good hand and wasn’t just bluffing.  This was his chance.  When it came time to swap cards he exchanged one of the four aces he obviously would usually have kept and made sure that his hand was low enough to make sure he’d lose.  He kept bluffing along, raising the stakes until Moran was all in.  When John pushed all his chips in to the middle as well, Moran raised his eyebrows.
“Hey, calm down.  I’m not going anywhere.  You can have whatever you want but there’s no rush.  We have all day.”
John turned round as he stripped off his underwear so the first view Sherlock got was of his bum and never had Sherlock wanted to sink his teeth into arse cheeks more desperately than he did right then.  They were round and smooth and obviously strongly muscled as Sherlock watched John tense them as he felt himself being watched.  John looked at Sherlock over his shoulder and wiggled his arse and his eyebrows at him.
John pulled first Greg and then Sherlock up and, keeping hold of their hands, he led the three of them into Sherlock’s room as he had the bigger bed.  Once there, John took hold of the sides of Greg’s shirt and pulled it off.  Sherlock took immediate advantage and started kissing down Greg’s chest, having noticed, of course, how Greg had responded when John had done so.  Greg groaned and brought his hand up to Sherlock’s head, holding him in place at his nipple.  John smiled at him and decided to drive him mad by going for the other nipple at the same time.
"That was impressively worked out, Molly.  Incorrect, but certainly well observed."
“Thank you, Mummy.”
"So they really kicked you out for saying stuff to people?"
Sherlock groaned at the sensations.  He did like any attention on his neck and he loved it when John marked him.  He liked feeling that he belonged to John and that John was possessive enough to show it.  It didn’t matter that it wouldn’t be seen by anyone else, Sherlock would know it was there and he often found himself sitting in lessons, running his fingers over areas where John had left his mark.  John somehow seemed to sense when he did it and would catch his eyes and smile, knowing what Sherlock was doing and a feeling of pride would settle over him.
“You should consider yourself lucky, is what you should do.  You’ve seen me in action, Watson; you know for sure that I wouldn’t have missed.”
“Did you get the licence plate?”
“Please, John.  Please, now.  I need it.”
Sherlock looked at him for a moment, as if he couldn’t believe what he was going to ask, but went ahead anyway.  “Did you mean it?”
Thanks for your letter.  Let me just say, it is definitely worth receiving and nice to have something to re-read so it provides more than just a small respite.
“As soon as I’m fully healed I can’t wait to prove you completely wrong.”
“It felt bloody amazing.  It was like I was completing a circle.  I could feel your life force running through me as I came inside you.  I can see why you never minded when I asked you to bite me.  I’d want that all the time too.”
The driver swerved again, weaving to avoid cars and also to keep John and Sherlock unbalanced.  Sherlock kept held of John this time and they made their way further down towards the driver.  He saw them coming closer and pulled out his gun, aiming over his shoulder.  Sherlock pulled John down as the driver shot high then Sherlock kicked his leg against the back of the seat, pushing the driver forward and banging his head against the steering wheel.  The van veered again and this time the driver was too dazed to straighten up and they crashed into a lamp post.
Another one who seemed too interested in his own script to bother with anyone else was
They met up with Mike and Molly again when they got outside and Sherlock could instantly tell that what John had said was correct.  He could see by the state of their lips that they had been kissing.   Molly's blouse was creased and Mike's hair was mussed so they had clearly been getting a bit handsy as well - though they obviously hadn't gone as far as John and himself had he thought with a satisfied grin.  He hadn't counted on Molly being quite so observant as well; though perhaps if he could have seen himself he might have reconsidered.
John followed Mycroft out to his car and they headed back to his office.  He hoped that Mycroft’s team might have found out some useful information in their absence.
He gathered up the scraps but instead of rolling it out this time, he started moulding it into the proper shape for an anatomically correct heart.  All the ones he has seen on the cards they had been talking about at school and, indeed, some of the little decorations that Mrs Hudson had supplied for the cakes, had been in that stupid heart shape that provided no accuracy whatsoever.  His would be nothing like that; his would be the right shape and have ventricles and atria and he was going to use the jam to be the blood.
John blushed.  He knew how he felt about Sherlock; his feelings having become known to him through his grief, but he still hadn’t been sure about Sherlock’s own emotions – even after what Mycroft had said.  The look Sherlock had just given him was almost shy in its uncertainty, though, and John felt a burst of confidence sweep through him.  He knew Sherlock was inexperienced in dealing with emotions and that this would be another burden which would fall on him, but this was one he would be happy to bear.
“Caring is not a disadvantage, Mycroft.”
Sherlock looked surprised.  'Friend' - that was unusual.  The proprietor had called him John's friend and John hadn't denied it.  He'd also said that they'd be back and it had sounded like he meant together.  Sherlock had not experienced this before and it felt strange, but nice somehow.  Acceptance and inclusion - where before he had always been ridiculed or ostracised.  He found himself liking it and he joined John in waving to Mrs Hudson as they made their way outside.
The following day had been marred slightly, as far as Sherlock was concerned, by an unannounced visit from Mycroft.  Thankfully, he had only stayed for lunch and, once he had gone, they spent the afternoon swimming and relaxing by the pool.  They had decided to forgo riding for the day as they were both still feeling a little tender after their exertions yesterday.  They had found that they both loved bottoming as much as they did topping and they had been taking full advantage of their time alone to try out many different things.
“Can’t you tell?”
"The aroma; it's very distinctive and a favourite of mine."
Sherlock smiled shyly down at him, moving his hand up John’s chest to circle his nipples and then gliding it back down to take hold of his own shaft.  He stroked his hand along it a few times, keeping rhythm as he raised and lowered his body on John, maintaining eye contact the whole time.  John’s jaw dropped open as he took in the happy, confident look on Sherlock’s face as he pleasured himself.
“Why would you need to be good enough for me?”
"That's not what people usually say."
When Sherlock and John got back to Sherlock's room they got comfy on the bed and Sherlock told John everything he had noticed during the rehearsal.  As he had hoped, John's look of stupefaction at his skills was as delightful as he had anticipated.
Luckily the girls had already been removed from the van and were all huddled against the wall so a group of officers moved over to protect them and hustle them out of the back of the building out of the way of any trouble.  The police took down four of the gang members quickly, leaving two who were behind the van.  The first one jumped into the van and slammed it into gear, smashing his way through the doors and the other tried to jump into the back as it pulled away but got his foot caught and fell back again so Greg rolled him as he landed and slapped some cuffs on him.
Once they were inside the fence, they scouted round to find an entry point.  They came at the building at the farthest point from where John thought he had seen the light and luckily found a window on the other side which they were able to use glass cutters and suction clamps to remove from its frame.  They all climbed into the building and found themselves in what looked like an abandoned office.  The desk, chair and a couple of cabinets were still there but all the drawers hung open and empty.
So maybe his own tendency to keep to himself had disguised the fact that John wasn't comfortable touching others as well. He had just assumed that all the times John shied away from Sherlock's (or anyone's) touch, it was out of respect for Sherlock's aversion.
"It went further to shit when Harry came out. Actually, when she was caught with one of her string of 'girlfriends'. He... he was always extraordinarily homophobic, and he screamed at her to get out of his house along with her 'fag'- so she did. I was only sixteen, and I was so scared to be left alone with him. She didn't even look back at me, she just left."
For John to be mentioning this now did not bode well at all.
He had made a grave mistake. Of that much, he knew. He had read the signs all wrong; he should have known that John had not been exhibiting the signs of attraction, but rather, fear. He pretended he couldn't hear the muffled whimpers floating out of John's room down into the sitting room, where Sherlock was frantically pacing. He had hurt John, and John would never talk to him again. And Sherlock didn't even known why.
"What case? We don't have any- ohhh yeah yeah I'll be there!" A knowing snicker from Dimmock.
"Oh, f***. Sherlock."
Sherlock wanted so badly to tell him that he was more than just useful to Sherlock- he was all that was important to Sherlock. Not only that, but he had saved so many lives, so many times, including Sherlock's own. John's impact on the world, despite his humbleness, were much bigger than he could think. He just needed to be reminded of that, maybe. But Sherlock was still fiercely proud of John, that in his darkest moments he had been so selfless. Always so selfless, my John.
They just sat like that for a while, Sherlock enjoying John's permission and quiet companionship.
John loved him.
He considered just asking Sherlock about it. That would be the logical course of action. Maybe then he would debunk all of this, scold John for actually believing Anderson, and get the hell on with it. But John didn't think he could take it if Sherlock didn't refute it. His heart was tearing in two at the mere thought.
As Sherlock dug through his mind palace for more evidence, starting from when they had first met years before, he found that John had always actively gone out of his way to avoid any kind of contact with another human. He would make contact with people only when absolutely necessary, and always kept to a personal bubble of at minimum two feet. He had avoided hugging even the few people he trusted (Lestrade had tried many times, and Sherlock once, when he was really drunk). Sherlock remembered now that on every such occasion, John's eyes would widen, he would step back, and politely smile, giving some excuse, like "I'm a military man, you know me, I'll probably accidentally decapitate you." Sherlock had noticed how fishy that sounded even then, but had instead wallowed in his perceived rejection (he was drunk, he was allowed). No touch from anyone, then, romantic or not.
"Sherlock."
And then-
And then, as if he suddenly remembered something, he directed a confused look at Sherlock and asked, "Why did you come up behind me anyway? Were you... hugging me?"
John still didn't look relaxed or forgiven, but his clenched jaw and hands slowly loosened.
He trailed off, noticing the shock on John's face.
He resumed his pacing, adequately frantic this time, as he often did when he was on the trail of something, something big.
By now John was crying, reliving the repressed memory.
He forced himself to look up at Sherlock's beautiful face, the shadows and lines of his sharp face accentuated in the moonlight, and yet the warmth and concern behind his kaleidoscopic eyes shining through, in the golden light. John's heart clenched painfully, at the thought that such beauty wasn't really his, and that these unprecedented gentle, caring words weren't real. Just an experiment.
Sherlock held John, as John cried. He just held him in his arms, with John's face buried in his chest and his legs in Sherlock's lap, and allowed John to cry away his pain.
They both stepped into each other's embrace, just happy to hold each other. Glad that it really was love, one that would never stop. John was the happiest he had ever been in his life. A stray tear dripped onto Sherlock's hand, where it was cupping John's cheek. He looked straight at John, and then kissed the tear on his hand. It was such a powerful gesture that John's heart stuttered, and his knees trembled. He had to clutch Sherlock for support. He's showing me that he will try to be better.
He had just had his own reservations, hadn't he? He knew it had been too good to be true. That Sherlock never did anything romantic or even affectionate, always just physical. He was more rude to him than before they were 'dating', and seemed never to care for John's moods. He knew he hadn't signed up for a regular boyfriend when he happily agreed to Sherlock's surprising proposal- but he also knew that there was something lacking. It hurt so much, that Sherlock didn't deem him worthy enough to be with him properly.
Sherlock could tell John was scared, but he was brave. And he loved Sherlock.
How could he have never noticed?!
Anderson sneered from the corner. "Hey- it fits all the facts-"
He took out a picnic basket, and spread a blanket on the ground, right in the middle of the path. Cartons of food from St. Angelo's appeared all around him, and John's stomach growled in response to the delicious smells. He hadn't eaten since yesterday evening.
That explained his rather terrible relationship with his sister currently.
"I entered the room and closed the door behind me, excited for a promotion, and maybe to see if the feelings were mutual. In an odd voice, he told me to lock the door. Even though I was confused as to why that was necessary, I shrugged it off and did so.
John didn't know whether he should be affronted or amused. He settled on a little of both and was about to snap back a biting retort when Sherlock physically shook his head and strode over to John. He grabbed his hand and basically dragged him towards the door, stopping for only a second to filch the necessary files from the still-open file cabinet. He threw a cheeky smirk over his shoulder at a spluttering Lestrade, then pulled John out the door. John just sighed resignedly and let himself be pulled along, muttering an apology (that he didn't really feel at the moment) to Lestrade on the way.
John's fists clenched.
John's sole focus seemed to be on killing Sherlock. They both remembered at the same time that there was a knife within two inches of John's reach, and in a panic, Sherlock managed to wheeze out a strangled "John".
"Yes, that's it, you misheard, John, you're really getting old, I clearly thought you had come back early, you know how my mind palace is, I get lost it in it, and I was just telling you to bring me those ginger nuts from the bakery, why would I "confess my love for you" or some nonsense like that, I was merely-"
They were both high off the thrill of a chase, a fully satisfactory, honest-to-god chase, complete with guns and jumping across buildings and tripping over cats (John would never let Sherlock live that one down). Sherlock had been itching to get out of the house for days; his annoying little feelings for John had been driving him insane, and he desperately needed a case to distract himself from the John invading his brain, the John he had to constantly remind himself he could never have, not in that way.
Oh. Can't read my mind then. Praise the gods.
His heart broke for John yet again, the largest in a series of rips Sherlock wasn't sure his self-proclaimed tiny heart could handle- after all, his heart was John.
Hell, he could use a cigarette right about now.
And then he realized that he actually couldn't believe it, that this was the ultimate test, the final part of Sherlock's twisted experiment, to drive a wedge in his heart and twist it, to destroy John. He couldn't even be angry at Sherlock. He hurt so much, but he just stood up, ready to go back home. But a hand on his wrist stopped him.
Once out of Lestrade's office, Sherlock briskly dragged John into the nearest empty corridor and pushed his back roughly against the wall. Sherlock's lips were on John's before he even had time to ask what he was doing.
“They are classics, Sherlock, even you have to admit that Sean Connery looks good.”
Sherlock looked into John's eyes, assessing the truth he could see within.  Knowing that John really did mean that he wasn't ashamed of Sherlock made him feel better and he decided it would indeed be nice to be able to savour this without outside interference whilst they got used to it themselves so he nodded his head.  He stretched his neck closer to John and kissed him sweetly and deeply as if he didn't know when he would get to again.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “John, surely even you have noticed that I am lying in a king sized, four poster bed.  We have shared a bed before – when we were in Dorset to name just one occasion – and we have been sharing a room for the last few days in the hospital.  I am in no way averse to sharing my night time accommodation with you as happily as I do my days.”
“If you are going to do this, John, then at least let me get you kitted out properly.  You will need full back up if we are going to take Moran down.”
“Greg!  Greggie!  Why aren’t you wearing your shorts – should have shorts – good legs.”  John giggled at him as his head tried to sink down on to his chest but Sherlock’s fingers held it up.
They walked to the Post Office and, in spite of the all the sighing and huffing that Sherlock did, whilst he waited for Mrs Hudson to finish chatting with Mrs Boult, the Post Mistress, the parcel was correctly stamped and sorted.  He was assured that it should reach its destination the next morning and, yes, they would be very careful with it.
I am always yours
“When are you coming up this…?  Oh.”
"I still remember it, thank you, sir and though Sherlock hasn't used these specific machines, he has done woodworking at a previous school so he knows the basics.  Would we be alright to go ahead with it and just give you a shout if we need help?"
“It wasn’t my fault, John.  They were trying to make me leave.  You needed someone to monitor you.”
“At least let me say it, if you’re going to force it out of me.”
John walked over to the table where his friends were all gathered; complimenting each other on how fabulous they all looked.  John looked all around the room but couldn’t see Sherlock anywhere.  He sighed in disappointment and resigned himself to sitting through another long evening doing something in which he had little interest or enthusiasm.
“Ohhh, most definitely.  Just as you are mine, aren’t you, John?”
“Well, you’ve wiped me out for the evening, so I guess I’ll have to call it quits.”
John had bumped into Greg when he’d walked past New Scotland Yard on one of his meandering treks through the city.  Even though his injury had been through his shoulder, he had developed a compensatory limp and currently used a walking stick.  He made himself walk as far as he could each day to stretch the muscles in his leg as he refused to pander to the blasted thing when it hadn’t even been injured.  His therapist had told him it was psychosomatic – as if he didn’t know that for himself, thank you very much – but regardless of what he knew, he still couldn’t shake the phantom pains with which he was plagued.
John jumped on the bed on the other side of Greg and kissed the shocked look off his face then he followed Sherlock’s example and started kissing his way down Greg’s body.  They both spent a lot of time on Greg’s neck, licking and sucking over the pulse point on either side, though they were careful not to pierce the skin at this stage, wanting to draw everything out for him until he was ready to come again.  The two men made their way down Greg’s body, covering him in kisses and love bites, sucking fingers and even toes to provide the imagery and sensation of what they were going to do to him shortly.
"Well, I suppose it doesn't sound too bad.  Go on then."
Mike pushed past him on his way to get a drink for himself and his date and John leaned over to get out of his way.  As he did so, he saw him.  Oh, wow – he was here!  He’d actually come and he looked bloody gorgeous, John could willingly admit that.  He’d never had a problem knowing that his friend had amazing looks and had often teased him about it before when girls had tried to chat him up.  He had just never thought it would be himself who turned out to be as bad as one of those drooling groupies who couldn’t take his eyes off the beautiful sight in front of him.
“No! You don’t touch his things.”  John shouted and jumped up.  He snatched the coat out of Mycroft’s hands and stepped back.  “You can leave now.”
"We'll need to call you in to the station tomorrow to take down your official statement but that'll be enough for now.  Thanks for your help."
With that Sherlock swept out of the room and down the stairs.  John raised his shoulders to shrug at Greg and nodded his head to indicate he was following Sherlock.  Greg shouted behind him.
He led the way through to the bedroom where John could see more of the dark wood in the panelling across the whole wall behind the bed.  The rest of the walls were painted in a soft, pale blue, which lightened the atmosphere enough to give an airy spacious feel, and counteract the darkness of the wood.  There was another large picture window looking towards the lake and the forest behind.  John thought if it were his room, he would just sit there for hours on the comfy, padded window seat, staring at the beauty beyond.  Knowing Sherlock as he did though, he doubted his friend would sit still long enough to enjoy that, unless he was engrossed in a good book.
“That’s it.  He’s filling you, isn’t he?  Those long fingers stroking you; feeling every inch of you.  That’ll be me soon.  I’ll be fucking deep into you; long, hard thrusts into that hot passage, feeling you squeeze me on every stroke.  And whilst all that’s going on, Sherlock will be deep-throating your cock, letting you fuck his mouth just like your best fantasy.  The things he can do with that tongue; masterful doesn’t even begin to describe it.  You won’t know where to put yourself.  Can you just picture it?”
He didn’t want Sherlock to think he didn’t appreciate what he was willing to do for him.  Sherlock nodded and turned his face away as he left, but was that a tinge of disappointment John had caught before Sherlock had gone?  John knew their status quo seemed to be changing slightly, but surely not that much.  He wouldn’t push it and wait and see what happened.
“What on earth made you do that?”
Sherlock had left the door slightly ajar and he popped his head round about twenty minutes later to check and saw that John was out like a light.  He was lying on his side facing the open side of the bed which was just perfect for Sherlock’s purposes.  He undressed, put on his pyjamas and, moving carefully so as not to disturb John, he climbed into the bed.  He edged himself closer so that he was lying in front of John and then he spent a happy, peaceful two hours watching John sleep.  It was so restful, in fact, that before he realised it, Sherlock was fast asleep himself, lulled by John’s rhythmic breathing.
John coughed and cleared his throat.  “Sorry, frog in my throat.”
“Yeah, I know that, but they didn’t, did they?”  John grinned down at Sherlock.  “Hi, I’m John Watson.”
"More."
“Well, I’m sorry.”
“I did.  The way you turned my composition into something so uplifting was inspired.  You have a real talent.”
“Therefore, if you are not our dates and you have clearly not been in the military then I can only assume that you are here on business, which means doing detective work.”
I didn’t want to let you out of my sight when they took you away to check you over and to be de-briefed.  I think Mycroft must have stepped in again to smooth the way for you because one of the other soldiers told me that usually they would keep you locked away for days whilst they got all the information from you, but I saw you again only a few hours later.  Even that length of time was too much though.  I doubted that you were really back; that it had all happened.  I’m sorry if you felt smothered by me after that, but I couldn’t let you go again.  It was only when I held you in my arms that you felt real.
Sherlock smirked sheepishly then climbed on to the bed, his eyes fastened on John as he revealed the rest of his body.  John stood back and held his arms wide, holding himself open for inspection.
“Quite - that is what addiction does to the family.”
“What are you doing over here?  I think your table are all making free with the punch – which has been spiked, by the way – so, much good may it do you.”
“Not always.  You have an unprecedented way of surprising me when I least expect it.”
“Oh.  Okay, right.  Well, that’s a bit disappointing.  I suppose I knew it was a bit too good to be true, if I’m honest.”
“I haven’t been dating recently.”
John coughed and shook his head as if to clear it as he took another drink.
John blushed.  Had he really been doing so badly?  It hadn’t seemed too dire when he’d been circling round. Wait a minute - that meant that Sherlock had been watching him during the last dance.  Why would he have been doing that?
“I might be.   Would you be up for that?”
"Well, no.  As I said to you, nobody really likes what I say to them."
“What was the ‘oh no’ for at the end?  Does she not want me to come?”
“Mine!”
“What do you mean?”
“Not that type of Consultant, I’m afraid.  I specialise in criminology, fulfilling private contracts and, more recently, providing assistance to the British Government, of which my brother is such a renowned ornament.”
Yesterday had been nice though.  They had sat companionably together all day; Sherlock had made drinks and served food and been very courteous, helping him get about the flat and resting his hand on John’s back whenever he had walked beside him.  It had been lovely and John felt a tingle in his spine as he thought of that touch.  He didn’t know what had made Sherlock change but he certainly wasn’t going to complain about it.  He would take whatever he could get.  He noted signs of Sherlock starting to wake so he pulled his head back slightly to give Sherlock a bit more space.
“She’s actually arriving later this afternoon to see the play with my brother.  I would be happy to introduce her to you, if you wanted to discuss it with her.”
“Are you ok?”
“Before we get sickeningly mired in sap and nonsense, shall we proceed with our plans?”
"Lucky guess.  I made it with my very first chemistry set when I was four.  I got Mycroft to help me make a star framework and then I grew the crystals within it and preserved it with a special lacquer so it wouldn't disintegrate.  Mummy made such a fuss and always insists that it is put on the tree each year, goodness knows why, I'm sure I could make something far superior now."
Nurse Clarke was in when they got there and they helped Matthew on to the examination table.  She proceeded to unwrap the bandage to check the wound over for herself.  Matthew was a bit worried because he didn't want to have to drop out of the play.
“Which licence plate?”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow but refrained from commenting on John’s lack of observation of the niceties of polite society.
John moved up Sherlock’s body so that he was resting above him, leaning on his elbows.  He looked down into that much loved face and could see the frustration and growing desperation behind Sherlock’s eyes.  John thought that Sherlock would probably only take one more time before he lost it completely.  He planted little kisses over Sherlock’s face, allowing him a moment to recover before he started his next onslaught.
Sherlock was enjoying his dream of John.  This was how he wished he really could wake up; his hands rubbing circles on John’s back and the warm scent of him filling his nostrils.  Not that he had ever really been close enough to get such an all-encompassing scent of him before; only whiffs here and there, but this was how he imagined it would be.  He felt John’s hands in his hair, pushing his head closer to that heady aroma.  He had loved the feeling of John ruffling his hair last night; it had been so tender and he had felt safe and cherished.  It didn’t surprise him that he was dreaming of that again now.
John burst out laughing and hugged Sherlock to him.  “What would I do without you?  Before you launch into a highly logical statement addressing that point, can I just say that I don’t want to find out either.”
He made his way back to his room and didn’t stop to draw breath until he closed his own door behind him.  He stood back against the wall with the lights off and waited to see if the boy opposite would also be returning to his room.  He was in luck because the lights came on in the boy’s room and he saw him putting his violin case down on the table before disappearing off to the side, presumably to lie down on his bed.
It was the worst day of his life!
Sherlock seemed quite relaxed now, so John decided it was time to liven him up again.  As he reached the lower back he shuffled further down Sherlock’s arse and made sure to rub his cock between Sherlock’s cheeks as he had allowed Sherlock to do to him earlier.  The tone of Sherlock’s groans changed from the quiet releases of pressure to moans of pure delight as he felt John sliding across his entrance.  This wasn’t something they had done yet and John wasn’t planning on going the whole hog today, either, but he had decided to introduce some teasing and to use his fingers to give Sherlock a taste of what was to come.
“John.  You have to drink it.  Come on, don’t leave me.”
“Of course.  You asked me once for milk and beans so I thought I’d finally deliver.”
I am pleased you got to have cake if that is what you enjoy.  I don’t think it was quite such good news for your colleague though, as that sounds like a guilt parcel to me.   Severe overcompensation probably covers a heavily guilty conscience.  It might be wise for him to check into his girlfriend’s current activities in his absence.  I wouldn’t recommend asking his best friend from home though as he is most likely the other party involved.  It is common for such people to get together to talk about their absent shared friend and reminiscing easily leads on to consolation and other more carnal pursuits.
He rubbed his thumb down John’s cheek and across his lower lip, smiling as John’s lips tried to follow the movement and capture the digit.  Sherlock did it a few more times, watching John’s face as he seemed to come further awake with each touch, his eyelashes fluttering as they struggled to open.
Greg lifted his head, his eyes narrowing at the pair of them as he came back to himself.  “Yes I think I’d like an explanation on that too, thank you very much.  What the fuck is going on with you two?”
John was looking forward to it.  He thought it would be great to see where Sherlock had grown up and he was more than happy to allow Sherlock some extra time to recover before they threw themselves back into their London existence.  It would also allow Mycroft to use the time to bring Sherlock back from the dead.  He had already provided the evidence to Scotland Yard to prove Sherlock’s innocence in all matters to do with Moriarty and Richard Brook, and it was now a question of restoring all the other documentation needed to allow Sherlock to function on a day to day basis.
"With a throw like that - what else could it be?  It was blatantly obvious that you were a sportsman from your stance and musculature and with that kind of aim at a moving target it is unlikely to be anything else."
“Obviously!”
My Sherlock
“Well, my way of phrasing it was certainly far superior to yours.”
Wherever you spend your Christmas I hope it is (or was, by the time you get this) a happy one and have a great New Year, too.
Most of the food had been eaten and what had been left had obviously now all been cleared away, so there was nothing left there to see.  It would have been put straight in the school mulcher, as they had their own kitchen garden that the students helped to run and everything was recycled.  Sherlock had deduced that there couldn’t have been anything in the food itself anyway, as they had all eaten the same things and no-one else had been ill.
When John had put the disk in, Sherlock patted the sofa beside him.
John took a good few minutes to come round and when he did, he smiled up at Sherlock who has perched on his knees between John’s legs just watching him.
Sherlock’s mother had always seemed to accept John, happy that Sherlock had found a friend.  All Sherlock ever said about his father was that he was very strict and he was as happy to avoid him as was John.  No doubt Mr Holmes had been pleased enough when Sherlock was younger to have someone to distract him so that he didn’t cause noise and disturbances around the house as he had done previously.  Now that Sherlock was nearing adulthood, though, it seemed that John was surplus to requirements.  He sat in Mycroft’s study, feet together, hands in his lap, staring down as he twisted his fingers together, thinking back to when it all began.
“The stump is lacerated as well, although less bruised due to the heavy scar tissue.”
This seemed to fluster the young woman, who turned quite pink.  “Oh!  It was no trouble!  And no one calls me gospozha, everyone just calls me Manya.”
“Good. Ms Hawkins didn’t say anything about Sherlock in her statement. She said she was working late, someone hit her from behind and the next thing she knew she was waking up in the hospital.
Keep breathing, Sherlock. I’m here, I’ve got you, Sherlock.”
“No, I mean – you were in Lancashire.”
She shook her head.
“Yeah, he came by.  Good thing you had a chance to warn Mrs Hudson.”
Ivan’s sword was ready on his hip, but could plain steel be relied on to kill a sorcerer’s heart?  He let the glass drop and studied Sherlock’s wings, then reached out to trace one deep gold feather to its base.  Grasping the shaft carefully but firmly, he tugged lightly to warn Sherlock of his intentions.
Sherlock’s expression shifted so quickly that John blinked.  “Angelo, I’ve tasted your tiramisu.  I don’t intend to leave John here sprawled across the table in orgasmic bliss.  We have
“Yes, but...” Sherlock swallowed and looked away. “It would be easier if we were close. And if we fall asleep on the sofa, your shoulder will be painful in the morning.”
Oh, Sherlock.
They kissed again and John had to turn his face away because it was almost too much, except then Sherlock sucked on his earlobe and John’s hips bucked up. Sherlock’s own hips were moving constantly, restlessly under John’s hands. John wasn’t sure that Sherlock even realized and if this continued...
“Websites,” Sherlock snapped. And then more quietly, “I’ve never been in a relationship that wasn’t for a case. It’s surprisingly complicated.”
Finally Ivan made a suggestion.  “Look, friends, I’ve had a long journey, and it’s getting hot standing here in the sun.  If you would let me in, you’ll be able to examine the tsar’s ring more closely and to ask me as many questions about the tsar and his court as you need to satisfy yourselves as to my authenticity.  There are seven of you, and I am but one man – and crippled at that.”
He called for help again.  Misha Kamen’brodsky showed up, but he just shook his head.  “I told you to listen to her, Vanya Stolitsky.”  He too vanished.
Ivan tucked the sack in his sword belt, thinking he could use it to store whatever food he found or was given.
Watching Molly’s face was like watching a building collapse.  Not a grand building but a small, well-made, pretty one.  Then she visibly pulled herself together – hmmm, thought John, tougher than she looks at first – and replied, “Certainly.  I’ll get them.”
And there it was.  “All right.  Housebreaking, lockpicking...”
“But she wasn’t,” said John. “Scorned, I mean. He was quite, ah, enthusiastic.”
An empty bed. An unevenly raised blind. And an open window.
“...how to throw people. I told Mrs Hudson...”
John looked pointedly around the warehouse.  “Well, thank God you’re above all that.”
what Sherlock intended.  Presumably.
“Dr Watson?” They both turned to look at the nurse. “The surgeon will see you now.”
Smoky sipped more coffee as he thought about it. When he finally spoke it was to ask, “Spare a fag?”
“Christ, you don’t think even Sherlock would walk into New Scotland Yard...”
He got the duffle zipped, got the car loaded, drove back to Baker Street very carefully because a car wasn’t a weapon, no matter how much he wanted a weapon right now. Anderson & Co helped him unload. Sherlock ignored them, busy at work on his laptop instead. There was bloody fluid all over the kitchen table, left behind by something which had once been alive.
“It sounded as if the violin was, well, flirting with the orchestra. Teasing it, maybe leading it on a bit.”
“Now who’s mentioning Anderson?”
“How are you doing this?” he demanded of the voice.
“A year ago you wouldn’t have gone.”
“Exactly my point,” said Sherlock drily. He fiddled some more, and the photo changed.  “This is Campbell-Williams attending a conference at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg last year.”
for emergencies!”
trap.”
“To over-simplify, yes. Foucault delivered an update on their work at the Heidelberg conference.  What’s interesting is that although he’s the senior researcher, it was Campbell-Williams who was quoted as making several apparently off-the-cuff remarks to the effect that practical results were imminent.”
“I don’t
“No, thanks, this is fine.”
“Prima ballerina.”
Sherlock smirked.  “To be a pirate.”
“Come off it, Sherlock,” Mary told him. “He’s been spending most of his time researching, John. Started with human reproduction and branched out from there. It’s like the wedding preparations all over, except this time without serviettes.”
“Please.”
Sherlock’s client had arrived early, it seemed. With three hired security guards, if John was any judge. He almost turned back, but then thought better of it. Mycroft travelled with security, and Sherlock had dealt with Mycroft easily enough. Let him try his arm-twisting trick on the guards – or the client. If someone broke Sherlock’s arrogant nose, John wouldn’t be sorry to hear it.
Sherlock gave his brother a narrow look. “And your team found no significant stores of information elsewhere in the house.”
“Poor Andreyev was far from the worst, dear.  Some of them ran away screaming the first time they saw Sherlock.”
-brother,” said Sherlock with a grin.  “Her Majesty my mother was notably adventurous when she was younger.  My firebird form comes to me from my father by right of birth.”
Dixon brightened a little. “That makes this easier. I’ll give you a summary now and make sure you get a copy of the full surgical report, okay?”
“Yeah. I think he found them – and I think he killed them.  Because that’s what psychopaths
“Molly Hooper, pathology registrar,” Mike explained as they watched her go.
“I’m thinking robbery gone bad,” Lestrade continued. “Young punk with a knife grabs senior and demands his wallet.  Senior has a heart attack.  Punk has enough of a conscience to phone 999 on his PAYG mobile, but takes off before the ambulance arrives so he can’t be arrested.  Takes the wallet with him.”
The guards unlocked the gates and dragged one open, bowing mockingly to Ivan.  “Welcome, both to you and your little friend!” said Mustachios with a wave at Ivan’s shoulder.
The creature looked back at him, its silver gaze direct and disconcerting.  “You don’t know the stick’s proper use and you don’t need it for the purpose which you
John turned to watch water again. “Good for you.”
Ivan if he wants to go to London?”
“I ought to be able to...”
Sherlock was already reading again.  “Bedroom,” he said offhandedly.
Sherlock’s shoulders relaxed marginally. “Really. Some other sort of health care professional?” He put aside the notebook and pen he’d been using.
Sherlock drew himself up and looked belligerent, although the effect was somewhat spoiled by the fact that he kept stroking the outside of his pouch. “Cetaceans are intelligent,” he argued.
“Nope. It’s not the kind of thing you should learn until you’re at least old enough to learn it the same place I did.”
“Right. Yeah, ah. See you tomorrow.” John remained in his chair, not sure he could stand up yet. There were times when alpha physiology was a distinct disadvantage. Besides, the view as Sherlock straggled down the hall to his bedroom was not to be missed.
Sherlock spoke almost as softly.  “Relationship advice, sister?”  Eurus shrugged, laid her violin and bow down, turned away.  Their conversation was over.  The matter was in his hands now.
“You mean you went back through it entry by entry?” asked John, a bit incredulous.
“Not to interrupt your domestic, but could we sit down? It, it wasn’t an easy trip.”
“Let women know you’re available, you mean.”
“Fine,” said Sherlock mulishly.  “If the killer wants to meet immediately, I’ll go alone.”
Sherlock’s smile flickered out. “My father was both somewhat old-fashioned and extremely forceful.”
of January with some trepidation, not entirely sure that Sherlock and Mary would neither kill each other in his absence nor collaborate on setting the flat on fire.
“I’m not really, you know.” Tears were running down Mary’s face. John wondered if she realized. “Neither is he. But which one of us are you talking to, John Watson?”
A man’s voice replied.  “There is a security camera on the building to your left.  Do you see it?”
“Er, no.  He doesn’t, usually.  He just... goes.”
Muircheartaigh giggled again.  “Be honest, Sherlock.  My work fascinated you.  That’s why you offered yourself to me as an apprentice.”
“I’ve performed fellatio before.” Sherlock’s voice was closer now.  John looked up in time to see him settle onto the bed towards the foot.  He was fully dressed except for his shoes.
John had never been particularly
Instead, he contemplated the man lying next to him.  Sherlock had thrust an illegally-obtained gun into John’s hands.  Sherlock, in lieu of informing Lestrade about his plans, had led John into a situation in which John had killed a man and then lied to Lestrade about it.
a beta,” John pointed out.
“Do we know that the Stevens own or owned a laptop?”
“Yeah. He’d stop ranting and listen and answer, pretty sensibly too.  So that was all right and I thought we were going to make it through until Mum got back.  And then...”  Tyler stopped.
“All right, you never heard this and certainly not from me. Someone called 999 this evening from the phone in Magnussen’s flat at the CAM Global News Building. The operator said it was a woman with a strong accent, possibly Australian. She reported that two people had been shot and needed immediate medical attention, then hung up. When the paramedics arrived, they found Sherlock, Magnussen and two more people, possibly Magnussen’s PA and a security guard. Magnussen had been shot through the forehead. Sherlock was lying on the floor bleeding out.”
The real Mrs Holmes wore a similar outfit and carried an outdoor jacket and oversized purse, presumably taken out of the suitcase. “Timothy,” she announced, “You’re wife’s going to miss her flight if you don’t hurry along. Off you pop!”
“He had his regimental mug out where anyone could see it...”
“Not that sort.  Finding stolen objects or missing persons.  Getting people off criminal convictions.  There’s a tavern keeper in Arkhangelsk who’ll provide a free meal for me and anyone I bring with me at any time.  He stood accused of murder.”
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business, Sergeant.”
“My sister Harrieta Watovna is a fine woman, quick-witted and high-spirited, far better suited to hold the throne than I am.  But to do this she must be married.  Drink is her great weakness and the chief reason her previous wife left her.”
Somewhat mollified – although not mollified enough to accept the toast – Sherlock continued.  “Working from this
“Of my
“Sherlock, wait. Stop. Look at me, will you?”
“Public school had been full of people like Sebastian. Despite Mycroft’s warnings, I imagined university as being different, a place where students actually came to
“Neither was Victor. The attack wasn’t his idea – the dog was young and not yet properly trained.  Avoiding the hospital was
“Right,” said John, scribbling frantically.  “Er, AM or PM?”
Perched on the rear seat were two plastic shopping bags, one with a loaf of bread sticking out of the top.  John stared at them a moment, then got in.
John smiled against Sherlock’s neck and kissed his skin.
Considering the events that had occurred after John and Sherlock’s second date, John thought it might be safest if their third date was at home. Within this in mind, he carefully selected a film and ordered massive amounts of takeout from the Chinese restaurant where he and Sherlock had eaten the night he shot the cabbie. He figured that a movie would be just the thing to promote cuddling on the sofa, necking on the sofa and any other activities on the sofa that Sherlock might be up for.
“I sleep too soundly with you in my bed.”
“We don’t have to. Not if you don’t...”
“It would have been simpler to bribe him with a large cake instead,” Sherlock claimed.
“For comfort.  To feel less lonely.  We should set watches and take turns sleeping, so that one of us is always on guard.”
The door to the laboratory banged open and the subject of their conversation stalked out, carrying a pile of books, papers and an ink pot.  “An excess of catalyst!” Sherlock declared.  He deposited the pile on top of a low cabinet, spread the pages out and began to leaf through one of the books, muttering to himself and making notes as he went.  He had a long black smudge down his aristocratic nose and, Ivan noted bemusedly, appeared to be using one of his own feathers as a pen.
Fine, thought John, and went into the bedroom.  In the centre of the bed lay a box.  In the box was a brand new mobile phone.
“Unlikely, considering that I’m both younger than you and male.
Sherlock was at his microscope when John burst into the flat, having practically run up the seventeen steps.  He didn’t look up, but emitted a noncommittal hum that might have been a greeting.
“Oh, hell, I never thought of that.”
“I came back, you great berk, because you owe me an explanation!  ‘Later,’ you said.  Well, later is
“Thanks for the coffee.”
“Oh, no, you don’t.  I’m not going anywhere until I hear you phone New Scotland Yard.”
“Once when he was going to shoot himself at Sherrinford and once when
“Which is fine, by the way.”  Not
“Hmmm. It’s a tempting offer, but... no.”
Sherlock sat there glaring at John like a petulant otter.
“What, you’re going to roll in black mud and try to pass yourself off as a muddy, six-foot tall crow?”
“And you chose to return to the UBR.”
“She means me,” interrupted Sherlock.
When they got back to the flat, they discovered Sherlock and Mrs Holmes immersed in a discussion of her latest project.
Pale marble in the moonlit room, Sherlock moved above and within John, filling him, centering him in
“‘Mycroft’ is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end. And the last time I brought my laptop you covered it with potatoes.”
“Better now?” asked Dixon. “I’m not very good at this part.”
a curse, which...”
“Then luck be with you, Ivan Watovich.”
“Something,” agreed John.  He looked down and realized he was turning his now-empty tea cup back and forth in his hands.  He set it down.  “And then I told you I’d been assigned to stay here, you put that together with ‘soldier’ and knew who I was, eh?”
that your envelope contains access to the right sort of quiet.  And I don’t mean by chemical means, it’s got the wrong sort of feel for that.”
Sherlock perked up noticeably, but Lestrade shook his head. “Amputated decades ago, from the look of it.  Nothing to do with the death.”
“Like Mom and Dad.”
“...wonder if he’s still alive...”
Shaking his head at himself, Ivan opened the case to place the crimson feather with its fellows.  Inside the case lay the other three feathers.  And a red, steadily beating heart.  Sherlock’s heart.  Alive.
“Perhaps I
“They were headed for Muircheartaigh
“Arrrrgggghhhh.”
“My brother,” Sherlock replied drily.  “London is a city-state.  My mother has held the throne for the past several decades.  In her old age, her formidable intellect has become... somewhat detached from the real world.  My brother effectively rules as prince regent.”
“Protecting the shooter? Why?”
“Someone who’s now dead, then.  I’m sorry for that.”
“For Mary, to bite down on so she doesn’t scream,” explained Sherlock.
“Sherlock?”
By Ivan’s reckoning they came to the road a fortnight after escaping Muircheartaigh’s castle.  By then they had taken to calling the widow and the madwoman Bezmolva and Bezumtsa respectively.  The two were always together.  In each other’s company, Bezumtsa seemed just a bit more calm and Bezmolva, just a bit less sad.
into a country illegally rarely is,” Sherlock observed. “John, you need to make tea.”
Sherlock’s smile widened. “Deduced that, have you?”
John limped up the stairs, wondering exactly what kind of work Sherlock had taken up that involved “clients.”
“Dr Campbell-Williams...”
“No,” he croaked. And then more strongly, “No. Whatever your name is now, whatever reason you’re here, the answer is no.”
shut up,” snapped John. “This never would have happened if you hadn’t come back.”
Sherlock froze, then spun around to face John. “Aren’t you done eating breakfast yet? We have beds to swap!”
“What’s that tune you’re humming, mate?” asked Lestrade. He and John were standing by while Sherlock had his way with a corpse.
Sherlock’s mouth flattened into a stubborn line. “Should
Mary the psychopath. Mary the liar. But John might have spent the rest of his life with her, might have courted a beta and raised a family with her, without ever knowing that. Sherlock, quick enough to lie on his own behalf, had believed John deserved to know the truth about Mary and had cared enough to... Cared enough that he’d...
“The bartender, got it.”
They finally reached 221B – and paused on the landing.
John hadn’t quite understood at the time.  He did now.  Four sausage rolls for five dollars and a pushcart vendor who was all too happy to get dollars instead of pounds.
let you in?”
Breakfast turned out to be cold spiced tea and jam-filled pastries.  The creature had a sip of one and a nibble of the other, but seemed more interested in Ivan’s walking stick and examined it closely.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope and studied John a moment. “You think you’ve just realized that in escaping from the hospital, I was risking my life for the sole purpose of demonstrating Mary’s duplicity to you.” He shrugged. “I would have had to leave the hospital anyway. I was too vulnerable lying there, drugged up on morphine.”
“You read the pen drive, then.”
“No other issues. SH”
He looked away from Lestrade to watch as Sherlock traced another character on the whiteboard. When Sherlock turned suddenly, their eyes met.  “
Ivan could imagine Sherlock at fifteen, brilliant and impatient, not yet old enough to be taken completely into his brother’s confidence – but old enough to take action on his own.
Chills had started running down John’s spine at the first words.  By the time Nigel was finished, they’d pooled into a pit of cold low in his belly.

“I wish.
And that’s you told, thought John ruefully as he finished putting the groceries away.  Probably just as well.  Sherlock was brilliant and gorgeous, but at heart he was the same brat John had met 14 years ago.
making progress on the self-confidence front.”
John froze.  “He counted on that, this Phelps fellow.  That’s why he picked the time and place he did.  He was going to use the tide...”
“You know an awful lot about these programs for someone who doesn’t watch them and who doesn’t even own a set.”
“Why do sorcerers do anything?” Sherlock replied with a shrug.
Sherlock frowned. “You don’t need to coddle...”
were an amarsupial, you’d be stuck carrying the child internally for another four to five months until it could breathe and regulate its body temperature on its own.”
John returned to work at the clinic. He needed, of course, a nurse to work with.
At the palace, the tsar stood waiting to greet his son, looking old and worn.  He had yet more bad news: the Prinzessin Clara had returned to her own country and had her marriage annulled.
Any response Sherlock might have made was interrupted by the arrival of Angelo, bearing menus and not just a candle but rather a decorative bit of metalwork holding
“Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize.”
“The dispatch records show that the response time was a couple minutes longer than normal,” said Lestrade noncommittally.
“Thank you.”  The front door opened and shut.
, a piano fitted with a mechanism that extended its available registers. In particular, such a piano was capable of producing a register that sounded something like a cimbalom, a type of hammered dulcimer that was considered to be typical of Romani music.”
John angled closer and peered over Sherlock’s shoulder. “They’re reprints of journal articles.  Sherlock, did you steal these from the lab?”
Tyler seemed puzzled by the question. “You know, about labs.  Like the stuff in them and what it’s used for.”
“I enjoy helping other people with things that I actually know something about.”
“Sherlock had a meeting with a client this morning. He described it as involving ‘simple blackmail.’ But he’s also working on something that has to do with Charles Augustus Magnussen. And Mycroft seemed to think that Magnussen was out of Sherlock’s league.”
a curse, which there may not be.”
“Is Stolitsky just your family’s name or do you really come from the capital?  I’ve heard a story that the tsarevich has ridden out on a quest to find a sorcerer!”
“Yes.”
“I can’t change what was true. I’d might as well tell you the end.”
“Don’t say no right away. You could think about it awhile, y’know? I don’t want you to feel pressured or, well, anything. Well, I guess I
“There
“You wanted revenge.”
“No, I want someone who knows more about tattooing than I do to compare them. And since we’re already going to be doing the rounds of artists who operate in less standard venues than the police will be checking, we’d might as well get an informed opinion while we’re at it.”

“Good,” Sherlock said.
?  It’s no good, you know.  I may have to rush off and deal with whatever little distraction you’ve arranged, but I
Sherlock frowned slightly. “We are.”
“It was... red, I think. Yes, red.” Sherlock began to scribble again as she spoke.  “But what does that have to do with...”
His face started to crumple.  He took a deep breath and finished, “To go with her.  In the end.”  Then he turned his face away.
them to.” Sherlock’s voice would have made the darkest chocolate look pale.
“Luck be with you as well, Ivan Watovich,” said Sara, and she kissed him on the cheek.
In John’s dreams that night he walked endless corridors, a maze composed of every hospital, university and government building he’d ever been in.  He kept running into people he recognized – Harry, Molly, Mike, Bill, Lestrade, Umbrella Man, Mrs Hudson.  They all wanted him to stop and chat.  Umbrella Man even offered him money to do so.  But the person John most wanted to speak with was always just ahead, just barely out of sight.  John would have called to them to stop and wait if he could have remembered their name.
“We should dance the upright mambo instead of the waltz.  I want to feel your body.”
Greg was soon back with his dad, who arrived at the same time as the headmistress.  Before they went any further Mr Lestrade asked for Julian’s parents to be brought over as well, to be present during the questioning.
What he liked to indulge in most when John was stroking his scalp, was to lie with his head facing inwards to John’s body so he could look up into John’s face and watch the little smiles he gave every time he glanced down at Sherlock.  When Sherlock woke up in this position he would often find that John had dozed off, too, and he took great delight in slowly waking him up.  He would start by breathing over his crotch, the heat making John twitch and smile in his sleep.  He would progress to taking the rapidly enlarging organ into his mouth, material and all, and see how long it would take for John to actually wake up and realise what he was doing.  His best effort had been when he had taken John all the way to completion and John had only woken up when he had been coming in his pants, a bewildered but satisfied expression on his face.
Mrs Hudson has just brought me up a plate of scones – I must have forgotten to eat again because I was absolutely ravenous and they’ve all gone already.  She said to say hello and she’s going to bake you a special cake again soon for me to send with my next letter.
"I think we'll start with a kiss for each correct answer and work our way up from there."
"Mike and Molly wanted to sit alone so they could indulge in the time honoured couples ritual of kissing in the back row."
They spent the next half hour getting re-acquainted and were only stopped from going further when they were interrupted by a knock at the door.  John carefully climbed off Sherlock and Sherlock opened the door with his body discreetly hidden behind it and just his head poking round.  It was the maid with John's suit so he took it off her quickly, thanked her and shut the door again.
“By all means, let’s do this.”
Greg got them to replay the scene a couple of times with a few variations; in where Freddie should stand to provide the best view for the audience; and whether to have him put his hand on Jasmine’s shoulder to bestow confidence and reassurance.  Sally and Anderson were both making copious notes about who was standing where; when they needed to come in; what props would be needed to be put in which positions; and everything else they could think of, so that they would be able to replicate everything when they came to rehearse this scene in more detail later on in their sessions.
"If you think about your thirst, you should feel your fangs lengthening in readiness.  They're razor sharp, as you should already know, so as soon as you sink them into the bag you'll feel the blood start to flow and you're away."
By Joolz
He heard a crackle of paper and reached round to pull out whatever he was lying on.  He couldn’t find anything so he stood up to see what he had crushed.  There was nothing there.  He looked around to see if it had fallen on the floor but still nothing.  He sat back down again, still gripping tightly to the coat and he heard it again.  It sounded like it was coming from the coat but surely anything in Sherlock’s pockets would have been confiscated or given to Mycroft.
Sherlock smirked up at him.  “Merely saving the best ‘til last, John.  You wouldn’t want me to rush straight on to the main course without finishing my starter first, would you?  You’re always telling me I should eat full meals.”
The next morning found them on their way back to London.  Sherlock was practically vibrating in his seat as he’d had a text saying their help was needed on a locked room murder so they were going directly to the crime scene and the ubiquitous black car driver, who had turned up that morning just as they were preparing to leave, was going to take their belongings back to their flat for them.
“Well, seeing as you and your brother aren’t really the dates that Greg hired, I’m assuming you’re here on business of your own.”
"How private can it be in a cinema containing other people?"
Sherlock pondered it for a moment.  He was quite enjoying the lack of expectation put upon him by being unable to move.  He didn’t have to reciprocate or wonder what John wanted him to do next, all he had to do was react to what was happening to him and it was quite freeing in a way.
Sherlock continued listening to the messages and they slowly became more like the two he had personally experienced, containing comments regarding plans that John had made as he started getting involved in life again and each one ending the same way with a special message to Sherlock.  Sherlock felt validated.  His feelings were returned, though obviously John had no idea that there could be any reciprocation as he knew nothing of Sherlock’s continued existence.  Sherlock felt bad that he had so many treasured comments to enjoy but John had no affirmation of Sherlock’s intentions or feelings.  How could he give something to John?
“Of course.  Of course, we’re friends; well, more than friends I hope, but that’s certainly the very least we are.”
“What do you mean?  We’ve woken up every morning in each other’s arms.”
"Horses like me."
Wow, you are amazing!  You were totally spot on about Tommy’s girlfriend and his best mate.  He persuaded his sister to go over and see his girlfriend and she just broke down and confessed.  It seemed the guilt was too much for her, just like you said.  It only happened once as she felt so bad about it that she wouldn’t meet up with him again.  Tommy’s got leave in two weeks so he’s going to meet her and see if they can sort it out.  He was pretty cut up about it but they’ve been together for years and he knows it must be hard for her at home on her own.  Good luck to him anyway, I’ll let you know how he gets on.
She shook her head as John started to apologise again and flicked her fingers in a ‘shoo’ gesture at him.  John leant forward and kissed her on the cheek before moving out from behind the table, grinning in anticipation as he left.  He watched as she turned to chat to their other friends, a resigned but still happy smile on her face.  The maturity from her well-travelled lifestyle shone through and she was determined to enjoy the evening despite not spending it with John.  Knowing that she would be okay, John dismissed everything else from his mind as he turned to look over at the only person in whom he was really interested.
The other thing that took up a lot of John’s time was Mike.  They had been friends all through school and Sherlock certainly didn’t want to take that away from him but if he could find a way for Mike to have another occupation for some of his spare time then Sherlock might be able to get John on his own occasionally.  After a few days spending time with John’s group of friends he had decided that what Mike needed was a girlfriend and he had found the perfect candidate in Molly.
“I think you’ll find I managed to survive for 200 years without you there to cover me, John, I don’t think I’ll be in too much trouble.”
“Why on earth would I do that, don’t be ridiculous, Mycroft.  Now, I’m very busy.  Goodnight.”
“Well, would you like to help me with my baking?”
John sighed. “It’s not for want of trying.  It’s... too quiet to sleep here, if that makes any sense.”
Sherlock sighed.  “Or navy blue presumably.  Oh, thank you, John,” he added as he accepted a mug of tea.
“There’s a sandwich shop across the street from the alley.”
Sara and Svinarnikov, who had also arrived at Muircheartaigh’s castle by horse, were confident that if they travelled west, they would come upon a road that would take them to a seaport.  West they all headed, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but they made slow progress.  The pale, silent man would not move unless tugged along by his companion.  The madwoman, on the other hand, was likely to strike out at any moment in random directions if not watched carefully.
They crossed the Outer Circle and left the park.
Ivan took heart, for Sherlock
make... Reality condensed down to two indisputable facts: the pleasure she gave him and the pleasure he strove to give her.
“Yes. It was... nothing was as Angela described it.  The food she’d prepared was gone.  There were dirty dishes in the sink, the bedcovers were rumpled.  The flat was very tidy, but it definitely looked as if someone had been there.”
Muircheartaigh’s amusement vanished.  “Your so-called ‘ruse’ only worked because it was true,” he hissed.  “I would have seen through a lie, Sherlock.  You
Anger stiffened John’s back and shoulders. “Right. Well. Right, then.” He headed towards the door, then turned on the threshold. “I’ll be in touch. If I remember to.”
“But I don’t use drugs.” The boy’s voice sounded very small.
“My idea, Tyuleneva, is that we’re going to be on this road together a long time.  The more we know about each other’s skills and experience, the better off we’ll be as a group.”
John went to the window, but Sherlock wasn’t in sight. He’d probably snapped his fingers and materialized a cab smack in front of Speedy’s.
“John was humming a theme from
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
John didn’t doubt it. Quite clearly Dexter would have preferred John to be still living with Mary, as far away from 221B as possible.
“Really. Any chance of him trying that again?” asked Mary.
Then:  “Yes, I’m still here, where else would I be?  Yes.  Oh?  Oh!  Well, that certainly explains it.  What’s the address?  Ta.”
“So, that seems a bit unusual for brothers to sign up together; especially when it seems incomprehensible that either of you can be short of opportunities looking as you do.”
“Mine!”  John almost growled at him and the noise had Sherlock moaning in delight, his arms trying desperately to reach John, but to no avail.
John smiled as he kissed Sherlock’s forehead.  He knew that Sherlock loved being wrapped around John, listening to his heart beating until he let the soothing rhythm lull him to sleep.
“Bollocks!  Now you’re just having me on.”
Stage Manager –                       Sally Donovan
John passed over the specs and Mr Johnson had a good look.
"That was amazing."
“I’ll see you on your return.”
"Promises, promises."
“Yeah, I ‘membered it for you.”
Sherlock looked shocked for a moment.  He had had his suspicions regarding the depth of John’s feelings but to have it so blatantly confirmed surprised him.  As the comment registered more deeply upon him, the side of his lip quirked up and Sherlock smiled shyly.
When they had both recovered and Sherlock had re-dressed, John just putting on his pyjamas, they sat together on the bed for a while just enjoying each other’s company.  Sherlock rested his head against John’s shoulder, his arm stroking the short hairs on John’s neck.  John has his arms around Sherlock, rubbing his fingers in gentle circles on Sherlock’s skin; both of them making the most of their closeness whilst they could.
