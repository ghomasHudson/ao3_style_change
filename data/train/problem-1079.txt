Irene walked into his office then and leaned against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest and a beautiful eyebrow raised.
child you’re taking care of, he’ll probably tie you up and fuck you over the coffee table as soon as the child is removed from the room. Parents love it when you coddle their kids.”
“You are, quite literally, the worst person I have ever known and I hate you,” Sherlock grumbles as he attempts to pull the covers over his face.
, Sherlock. I've been doing nothing but working in a bloody clinic and planning weddings for almost a year now.”
Molly still hasn’t let Sherlock know she’s been obsessively watching him on tv though, and while she’s feeling a little star struck especially under Iris’ scrutinizing and playful gaze she decides to attempt to make it look like she doesn’t know who the beautiful woman is. She stumbles nervously and, looking to Sherlock, she says with a light little giggle, “So, um, who’s this then? Client?”
“Hmm.” Sherlock said, looking back at Jennifer, an odd expression on his face. He opened up the little box, inspecting the cable again.
Harry and Mary made eyes at each other as John tried his best to continue smiling while staring at the carpet. He wished the chair he was in would swallow him into a magical vortex in space... or something.
John turns back towards him and with a lungful of air says... “Sherlock you know I appreciate everything you’ve done for me - for us, right? Everything you do, even? You’ve...” he struggles, “god I’m shit at this.” He scrubs his fingers through his hair and growls, starting over, “You’ve been a great friend Sherlock. You are a great friend, and I’m sorry I haven’t been a better one to you. I... I just wanted you to know that I see you. I see what you’ve done for me and I’m thankful for it - for you. I’m thankful for you. And I... I... care about you. A lot. And I guess what I’m trying to say is... I just - I want you to be happy, Sherlock. I’ll always want that for you. Always.”
“Thank you,” He replies primly, taking the cards delicately between his thumb and forefinger, “This is why
Harry smiled and almost reached up for it but caught herself quickly, “What? No! I - don't eat that stuff, John!” She finished with a sweet-looking smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.
Harry looked at him for another second, then shrugged, “So... tell me about Mary!” She said instead, excitement clear in her voice and the way she jumped up and down on the couch, her expression eager.
Sherlock reached for the paper but John pulled it back, asking, “What is this?” as he struggled to understand just what he was seeing.
John breathes him in, “Good,” he says, “that’s good,” then giggles, staring again, “god, I’ve really been such a moron haven’t I?”
“Wonderful, wonderful!” Angelo beams and gestures them through to the table by the window that he and Sherlock had sat at the first time they had met. Angelo removes the sign that says ‘reserved’ and helps Sherlock to adjust the high chair that has been placed at the table for Rosie.
Sherlock raises a brow, attempting to look bemused, but he’s sure he’s failed because the look just makes Dorian pout, “Come on, Mr. Holmes, drink with me? Pretty please?” He insists just as the bartender hands them both a glass filled with a mysterious pink liquid. Sherlock distrusts it immediately and hesitates, remembering the last time he got properly sloshed. The stag night with John felt like eons and Sherlock certainly hadn’t handled his liquor well on that night. There was no way he’d be letting his guard down around all these vultures. “I’m afraid this old man’s not much of a head for drinking anymore, little one,” Sherlock replies, attempting to be sweet, while also making it clear to Dorian that he fully acknowledged their age difference. He hands the drink to Jack, who sniffs it dubiously but takes a sip.
Sherlock shook his head in disbelief and looked at the closet. He took out his mobile and snapped a quick photo while John changed into his (ugly) suit.
“No, honey,” John says and lets go of the tray, attempting to regain control of his kamikaze toddler.
Sherlock felt like he was sinking into an ocean. His eyelids felt heavy and he found that he simply couldn't find the strength to speak, even though he desperately wanted to.
“Gray might be a nasty little twerp but at least he’s useful,” Irene comments while she and Sherlock rush about 221B changing out of their costumes and into something more comfortable to attend the club.
“-Tell me or I’m telling mummy that you aren’t being any fun, Sherlock. I’ll tell Mycroft you were crying again and he will be very cross. Do you want to upset them Sherlock?!” Eurus taps her foot impatiently.
John purses his lips and comes over to them. “So how does my daughter know her name after all?” He asks, remembering that Sherlock had never actually told him why Rosie knew her name. He delivers the question with a steely glint in his eye and a shark-like grin, hoping that his attempt at a smile won’t clue Rosie in to the fact that John isn’t happy about her new… ‘friend.’
“Sherrrrrlock.” He corrects, knowing she won’t say it right for another few months yet, but encouraging her to try anyway. She simply giggles and grabs his face, requesting an Eskimo kiss, and Sherlock - unable to resist, complies.
There’s a short silence after Sherlock’s rant and he huffily takes up feeding Rosie. John doesn’t protest.
The table is silent for a moment, and Sherlock now finds it too awkward to look back at John, somehow scared of what he’ll see.
John looked at Sherlock, still smiling, “You shouldn't, you know. He's your big brother. He loves you. He's just worried about you.”
The cabby looked back at the strange sounds of grumbling coming from the back, “Oi, mate, what the bloody hell do you think you're up to?”
“Ah, so you admit that believing in marriage is like the childish belief in Father Christmas?” Sherlock gave John a triumphant smile,
“Ow!” John looked angry for a moment, but soon realized what he'd just said. “Oh. Yeah. That... Thanks. I... um ahem... yeah, right, I um...needed...th- just- you... back to work!”
Dorian’s face lights up in excitement and he asks flirtatiously, “Are you going to deduce me, Mr. Holmes?” He grins mischievously and sits up to face Sherlock at a better angle, “Go ahead, I’m an open book,” he gestures with his arms to emphasize his point. “Though I can’t think what you can deduce about me that you probably haven’t already figured out,” he adds.
Ha... So originally this and chapter 6 and what will be chapter 8 were going to be one chapter but I realized as I wrote them that no... I had to split them up a bit, so I hope you enjoy this one. I was giggling like a dork when I wrote it so I also hope it makes you laugh.
“That’s Dorian’s manager. Though I guess he’s right - he never does manage to actually manage him,” Jack comments with a wink.
“I've got to go!” He said suddenly, and he kissed Mary on the cheek as he ran out of the flat to go catch a cab.
Iris looks to him and then looks to Molly. Finally, she rolls her eyes and waves her hands up in exasperation, “Fine!” She says, her accent adding to the apparent annoyance she feels at letting Sherlock do as he pleases, “Fine, do as you like!”
There's an abrupt movement beside him and when John turns to look Sherlock is blinking at him rapidly, like the time John had told him that he was his best friend, except this time Sherlock looks impossibly even more dumbfounded. Staring at him, Sherlock just says “... John,” in a blank disbelieving tone.
Tess, gaping passes the Microphone to Sherlock and Irene. Irene takes it cautiously and the audience cheers for her encouragingly. Clearly trying to rile Craig up and hoping Irene will fight back, but she doesn’t. In her thick (fake) Russian accent she says, simply, “Understood, spasibo,” She offers Sherlock the microphone. John holds his breath ready to wince at what Sherlock will say. He prays that the man can hold in any deductions he might be thinking of. Sherlock, apparently, hears John’s prayers, as he answers, “Yes, thank you, Craig, we’ll do better next time.”
And so John does - and it’s heavenly. Their silence once again becomes comfortable as Sherlock begins to alternate between feeding Rosie and feeding himself (but only after Rosie had noticed he hadn’t been eating and had said. “Now you Sherrock,” and closing her mouth tightly until he’d raised his brow for what seemed like the millionth time this evening and had speared some food onto his own fork, saying “Happy now?” and Rosie had answered with an approving nod.)
“Very much so, Watson. Is it for me to keep?” Sherlock continues his conversation with her, not knowing how to return to John and hoping Rosie will choose to engage him soon so he doesn’t have to. It feels a little cowardly, and it probably is, but he’s not really sure what to say. John had just suddenly looked upset and Sherlock was sure he hadn’t said anything wrong.
Don’t worry the next chapter is all summarized. I just need to write it. :) it’ll be worth the wait I promise.
“Fine,” Sherlock breathed, with no small amount of insolence in his tone, “Let's get a move on, then.” And he entered the cab's back seat as the cabby got into the driver's side, driving them out into the country side, back where Sherlock and John had come from.
John had almost forgotten that part, “Right? Yeah! – it was after the thing with the gardener that locked Greg in that utility room.” They had been on their way back home from a case and for some reason Sherlock had decided to check if Angelo was still in, claiming to be starving. John, never one to argue when Sherlock finally decided to eat had gone along and actually prayed that Angelo was in. His prayers had been answered as they had caught him just as he was locking up, though John had felt instant regret, while Sherlock had shamelessly allowed Angelo to usher them into the restaurant and gone off to cook for them himself. Sherlock had seemed to only have decided to pay at John’s insistence, but mostly it was because he’d realized that it was, in fact, three in the morning and after taking a look at Angelo had deduced how tired he was. Angelo, of course, had refused, which was why Sherlock had snuck the money in the register. Angelo had noticed, of course, as he’d already emptied the register for the evening. He’d taken the cash but had come back with the urchin dish.
He should have known he’d never stood a chance with Sherlock. God, why had he ever dared to hope otherwise? The man was a whirlwind and John could barely keep up. This shouldn’t be news to John. He should be pleased. He should be supportive of his friend for doing just what John had told him to do. He’d told him to do something while he still had a chance... because before he knew it, it could be gone. Sherlock had taken John’s advice. John should be thrilled, but he... he just can’t be. He’s miserable. Truth be told he’s always been miserable at the thought that he might one day find out that Sherlock might actually feel things that way, and that he might just not feel them like that for him.
Sherlock, when he finally opens his own eyes almost chokes. He definitely loses his footing and he hears Algernon and Jack cheer for John behind him, wolf whistling as John removes the jacket he’s wearing and tosses it aside, moving into Sherlock’s space without quite touching him, looking as if he’s five seconds away from doing so. Sherlock finally regains composure after mentally shaking himself. He steps close to John, daring him to touch him, begging him with his mind to please open his eyes. But John is facing the floor, almost as if feeling the music deep inside of himself. Sherlock frowns and steps closer. John gasps and Sherlock feels his breath even through his shirt. He leans over John while he moves deeper into John’s space and pants against John’s neck. John gives another gasp but this time the gasp is followed by a growl.
Rosie is half-way though shouting “SHEWAAAHH-“ again, when they reach her room and scramble inside. Rosie is standing in her crib, holding onto the rail and wobbling on top of two of her pillows and her stuffed elephant, which she has piled on near the stand where once stood a baby monitor. The baby monitor, which is now shattered, lies in pieces by the wall near the door of the bedroom. “Oh!” Rosie startles, blinking, “Dahdah,” She says, as if she just realized her father also exists.
“Bit not good, sister.” He’d said, using the same line John had used on him when they’d first started living together (and that he sometimes still uses if he feels Sherlock is being insensitive).
John shrugs half-heartedly and responds while smiling at the screen and unconsciously leaning forward, “Guess so… wow, look at him go,” Sherlock and Irene perform a particularly difficult looking maneuver in which she slides across a bar to slide into Sherlock’s arms. He catches her, lifts her in a spin and then spins her to curl her back into him. John, without realizing he’s doing it gasps out an “Oh yes, nice one!”
“Okay, good, yeah, right, because you know, we... haven't really had that kind of relationship before so I just wanted to make sure you were okay with it.”
“Mmm, good, very dashing!” Leonard laughed and mussed John's hair. “Thank you, Johnny.” Len smiled and then in the same breath his eyes twinkled and he said to John, happily “Say, I've an idea! Why don't you...” – He reached into his pocket and took out two rings – “bring forth the rings for the ceremony. And Harry,” – he turned and grabbed some flower petals from a nearby table and put them in Harry's little (now destroyed) hat – “can be our little flower girl!”
Jack pushes John softly along, getting him to join Jack as they step a little closer to the action while waiting their turn. From across the circle, John can see Sherlock and Dorian doing much the same thing except that Dorian is holding Sherlock’s hand and swaying to the music minutely by his side. John tries to ignore them and instead turns his attention towards trying to befriend Jack. Maybe, if he and Sherlock can play along with this little game they can get the small group to go somewhere quieter so they can interview them.
Sherlock and Irene jump into each other’s arms and hug, laughing brightly and directing various “thank you”’s to the judges. John glares at the screen a little bit. He isn’t sure how he feels about everyone gushing over Sherlock using an emotional and physical vulnerability of his just to win some silly competition. What is Irene doing to him this time?
John smiles warmly. “I can hardly wait.” he says, he then extends his arms for Sherlock to pass Rosie over. “Anyway, we should get going. I’ve got work again tomorrow.”
Two eyebrows, “MmmHmm, and I believe you love weddings so much because you'd rather focus on other people's lives than make memories of your own.”
“Please, you dream of me every night,” Irene argues, tearing away the sheets so Sherlock can’t cover himself anymore. She isn’t a bit shy about the fact that he’d stripped himself naked to sleep last night since (and thank god for it) Irene had decided to fall asleep on the couch last night. Sherlock gets up so he can cover himself with a pillow, indignantly yelling “What the fuck, Irene?”
John looks at the man with interest but thinks better of it. No, as much as he was curious to know what it was, if not a phone number, he really couldn’t possibly interfere, “No, that’s alright it really isn’t any of my business…” He starts.
Rosie looks between the two of them and begins to fuss. John is still fuming and looking at anything but Sherlock. The detective stands abruptly and picks up the squirming toddler, “Come on, darling.” Sherlock says to her, gently, “let’s go put an order in for some food for you.”
John looked at Irene. It seemed she was thinking the same thing as she stared between John and Mary with wide eyes. “Th-this morning?” he stammered.
John loses any sort of control he has and hears a voice in his head (that sounds a little like Harriet’s if he’s honest), saying, ‘
“Thank you, John.” His mother croaked out. John smiled at her, took his little sister's hand and led her to towards the reception hall to get some juice, which was where it had been placed. John had made sure to get a note of that as they walked in, knowing that at some point Harriet was going to get restless. She was still very little after all.
“Doesn’t it?” John says stonily, “And why is that Sherlock? Why doesn’t it? Because she loves you, you know that, don’t you? She
He stopped the bike then, put the break down and got off. The cab continued to drive away, but John could still see it in the distance. He'd catch up to it if he was quick. There wasn't much light up this road, but he knew it was relatively straight from here. John took the heavier end of one of the torches Dimock had given John and Sherlock earlier and used it to smash the front lights on the motorcycle (Sorry, Dimock). He then got back on the bike and sped his way up the road to catch up.
“It was just so old fashioned,” Harry continued, “So we were only able to use a few parts here and there.”
John begins to feel the heat inside him grow more insistent - “Sherlo- Sherl- Oh fuck, I’m close. I’m getting so close,” he says through gritted teeth.
Sherlock raises a brow and finally sits up to check for himself, a smile still on his face until he sees who the message is from. ‘Captain Clueless’  the title reads, he raises his eyes to Irene and says “Hilarious.”
A silence waved over the church as Harriet and Molly walked in from each side of the church aisles (one from the north aisle [left] and the other from the south aisle [right]) each holding a bouquet, followed by Archie who walked alone down the centre, holding the rings in a pillow before him.
it. Ah well, it’s not like there will ever be anyone more interesting than Sherlock out there anyway. God and he’s such a sultry creature, lying there biting his lip, waiting for John to respond to him. “Fuck yes.” John breathes, “but I need you to naked first,” he instructs, slipping back to allow Sherlock to strip. They remove their clothes in record time and collide into each other as soon as they’re both completely unburdened by fabric. They kneel on the bed, pressed chest to chest against each other, running their hands over the other’s naked and heated flesh until John pauses. His hands have run over Sherlock’s naked back and he feels something... strange.
OH! The benny and the jets. that's the 27 dresses easter egg! It made a cameo just now at the end. LOL. I had to! *~ B-b-b-benny and the jets. BENNY!
Sherlock picks out a piece of chicken and stares at it, twisting his fork before popping it into his mouth, “I think I’ve done fine so far without it,” he grins, teasing.
John is secretly pleased that Sherlock is so opposed to the idea that he could date Dorian. He’s especially pleased because not once has Sherlock ever made that argument in regards to John whenever it’s been suggested that they might be together. It could mean nothing at all, but it still pleases him. “He’s never going to let that go,” John tells Sherlock, teasing.
His blind faith in Sherlock’s moral character was really quite... sweet. Much like that first night they met, Sherlock continues to just
“Let's call it a new version of my brother's and my favourite game, 'deductions'. Usually, Mycroft and I pick an item belonging to someone and we deduce what we find about the person. But, because it's just you and I here, we'll play it differently. You are going to give me an item of yours and I'm going to use it to guess why you killed Ms. Jennifer Wilson based on what I learn from you using this item.”
John glanced at her as he reached the table with the projector and gave her his best reassuring smile. It seemed to work, as Harry's look of suspicion turned into one of relief as she made her way back toward Mary, beaming.
“No.” John answers quickly, and suddenly flips Sherlock onto his back, this time holding his arms above his head. He sinks down to kiss Sherlock in order to distract him, but it’s too late. Sherlock already knows.
“Alright, alright, geez, I’m going.” The man finally relents, pulling away from Sherlock as he puts his clothes on. Sherlock turns away from him, pulling his own pajama bottoms on along with a soft shirt and walks over to the window. He opens it and quickly lights a cigarette, leaning his head out to smoke. “Is it always going to be like this with you?” He hears the other man ask him.
“That’s hardly fair –” John sees Algernon appear from behind Dorian and Sherlock to join them, followed by Jack and a young pretty read-headed woman John assumes is Gladys, “You’ve already got one person on your team – now we shall have to find another one.”
Rosie gives John what can only be described as a Sherlockian glare of disapproval, “Down!” She hisses (hisses!) in return.
“–shh, yes, Mycroft, told me, but you know what, Sherlock? I'm glad he told me because you never would have. Look, I'm not Victor, I'm nothing like him–”
Sherlock gave Dimock a rueful smile, and began explaining how most of the evidence had been washed away by the rain. “She has this cable attached to her keys, but no phone. She must have had a phone, though. Why would she carry this cable if she didn't? But now Detective, I must ask, that woman at the pub, Wanda, she referred to Jennifer as
John finally stops on the stairs and half turns to Sherlock. He’s about to apologize again, but he finds looking at Sherlock’s distraught face, that no words will leave his mouth.
Dimock went out with him to wait in the car while fred arrived and to grab a police radio for John and Sherlock.
“Oh my goodness! What are you doing here? Are you alright?” the woman (nurse, apparently), asked, her voice sounding sympathetic.
Sherlock gives Irene a look which the others miss. Irene simply shrugs and says, in Russian, so she won’t be understood, “U nas net podskazok poetomu my mogli by takzhe poveselit'sya”
The third week of that month: Photograph of Harry and Mary with the london eye in the background on Mary's desktop screen. (John gives up on Mary doing any of her paper work that day.)
Mary turned her attention to the ads laid out on the desk, “Hmm, I think they're a bit too, you know,” She made a gesture with her hand flicking her nose up.
Irene and Molly leave theirs, but Sherlock, though he removes his, opts to take it with him. They then move through towards the main dancefloor area. The music in the building is so loud that they can almost feel it vibrating in their skin. Sherlock spots the actor, Algernon, making his way down some stairs which lead up to a balconied area. There’s a bouncer in front of this area too. Sherlock waves at Algernon who waves back. The four friends make their way over to him as he speaks to the bouncer, pointing at them. The bouncer nods and allows Sherlock, Molly, Greg and Irene to by pass him to go meet Algernon.
It was the night of the rehearsal dinner now and people milled about in the large fancy restaurant that Mary and Harriet had rented out for their celebrations. John was dressed smartly in a black well-fitted suit and crisp wine-red shirt. He swerved around the guests smoothly as he made his way over to Harriet and Mary, a look of determination on his face.
Sherlock looks directly at Molly with his own scrutinizing gaze and a raised brow while Iris’ wolffish grin grows bigger. “Of sorts...” Sherlock finally answers, giving Molly a suspicious look while Molly studiously ignores not looking at Iris’ almost predatory smile. He holds a hand in Iris’ direction, “Iris, meet Molly, Molly, meet Iris.”
Sherlock tosses his head back in laughter - “It’s in the playlist, but I’m prepared to skip it if it comes on. I don’t think Rosie should hear it just yet.”
I liked the part where Mycroft raged at him and then Sherlock hits him in the face. Oh! And i liked the part when John hit Sherlock in the face.
His girlfriend nods in agreement, “Especially after that bullshit score. I mean, I haven’t seen his other performances, but I’ve seen other people do jives on Strictly before and from what I just saw, Sherlock would decimate any of them.”
Sherlock glared. “Fine.” He grabbed the diary from the now silently amused Anthea's desk and stormed out of the office. It was all for show, of course, because he'd gotten what he wanted in the end.
“Okay, right?” John agrees, excited that his lover agrees, and he turns to her to express the excitement.
Sherlock is perfect at this too), but mostly, this is what Sherlock has been doing on the show the entire time. At this moment John discovers just why he’s hated watching so many of Sherlock’s interviews and interactions on the show. It’s because Sherlock has been flirting with the camera and the audience and the people surrounding him. He’s been telling them a love story and connecting it to himself – the mysterious detective who solves murders has been put into the background. Sherlock, to these people, doesn’t seem as unattainable as he has always seemed to John. To these people, Sherlock is a heartbroken man who just wants to be loved. Sherlock, in their eyes, is available for the taking. The thought that so many people could see him this way – that is why John has been so upset. Likely, that is why his jealousy has spiked and become much more obvious, enough so that it eventually became impossible for him to deny that he’s been thinking about Sherlock in a way that he hasn’t thought about in ages.
Sherlock has the decency to be truthful as he sighs, “She’s only met her the once, just this week. I didn’t know she’d told her her name. Molly brought Rosie over - it was my fault - I told Irene in passing that I hadn’t seen little Watson in a while and she took it upon herself to call Molly over while I showered. I did worry you’d be upset, but she was already here and she wanted to dance — and well, I couldn’t just say no—“
“Hello Sherlock” came Anthea's monotone voice, “Your brother sent me to ask if you ever got round to writing that groomsman's story. What have you got so far? He wants me to read it.”
But only for a little while. I'm still in school and the program I decided to take is very content-heavy so I haven't had much time to write. Also depression. YAY! Anywayyy on that light happy note:
I almost didn't split this, but as September has begun and I'm looking at a full course load I don't want to make you feel like you're waiting too long for them to at least realize they love each other. I do have at least one or two more chapters but I think we're getting close to the end now. I don't want to spoil the rest so I won't tell you whether or not i have any more surprises in store for them though. Anyway, enjoy?
John doesn’t reply right away, choosing instead to look her up and down at first. He notices that she’s dressed up as well. She’s wearing high heeled shoes, a jewel-toned green dress and a coat that looks very much like Sherlock’s. Her hair is styled prettily in a messy bun and she wears simple yet elegant jewelry. Is she coming with us? He worries just as he finally says in greeting, “I see you’re not dead.”
“What are you doing?” John asked as Sherlock removed his rain-soaked coat, scarf and suit jacket and placed them behind his chair. His purple shirt clung to his drenched skin tightly and John tried not to look as he moved to sit down and remove his own coat.
Sherlock seems to hesitate and he looks to Iris who had watched the exchange between Molly and Sherlock with great amusement. He tells Iris something in Russian.
reason to ask him. Did Dorian suspect the same of Henry as Molly and her friends? And If so, why are they still friends? And where does the servant fit into all of this? And who the
William chuckled putting the glass down, “Aw John you were doing so well... That's terrible by the way.”
“Getting to it John. Patience.” Sherlock answered him then, his voice husky as he winked at John, because
John and Sherlock are silent once again, contemplating their entire conversation. Well, wasn't tonight a night of surprises for both of them? But there's just one thing John still doesn't know...
John shakes his head to wake himself and steps over to Sherlock, making quick work of climbing over him to kiss and suck at his torso. “You...” he says, “are going to pay for that.”
John hesitates for what feels like the millionth time this morning, “Well, I’ve better be off then. Gotta get to work,” he explains, pointing over his shoulder at the door. “I’ll... talk to you later?”
Silence over powered the room once more until John turned, finally, and snuggled into Sherlock again. “Thank you. For ... for um...”
His movements are as fluid as water and the way he pushes down his suspenders as he dances makes John swallow hard as he watches the video on the tiny screen. The song replays the chorus and John’s eyes widen while Sherlock unbuttons his shirt bit by bit, one hand slipping into his hair while his hips gyrate to the rhythm of the song. He ends up with his top undone most of the way down and he does not seem at all shy about the way he’s writhing on the dance floor, bringing the hand from his hair slowly and seductively to trail down his chest to his stomach. The woman in front of him leans in closely and they grind without touching each other. Somehow the movements seem filthier with the space between them, their faces just inches away, each one looking like they’re practically panting into the other’s mouth. Someone in the background wolf whistles and another person yells, “Isn’t that your wife Henry?” Just as Sherlock’s shirt starts to slip down one of his shoulders, the video cuts off. The next video is of everyone in the ‘Strictly dance crew,’ as John has decided to mentally dubb it, laughing and drinking together while someone shouts, “goodnight London!” John closes the app just as the video begins to switch into one of Dorian talking and addressing the camera about being excited for next week’s dance or something. John doesn’t really care or pay it any attention. Quite frankly his brain is too fried from the flagrantly sensual display that Sherlock had just put on with a virtual stranger. This was now permanently on the internet…
John sees red when the young musician curls a hand into Sherlock’s hair, keeping his face bent low. John is sure Sherlock can’t see him as his back is turned to him and Greg so he allows himself to growl in frustration beneath his breath as he tries to calm down. His will to stop himself from hurling Dorian Gray away from Sherlock is almost broken, but just as he takes a step forward he catches a glimpse of Greg by his side. Greg is staring stiffly at Sherlock, but it appears to be more in discomfort, and John gets the distinct feeling that Greg is watching him for a reaction. John purses his lips as they watch Sherlock laugh and dance, letting himself be led. John takes another steadying breath, but he’s saved as Irene seems to ooze out of the crowd with a young couple on either side of her. She slides her hand up Sherlock’s bicep and snakes her hand underneath Dorian’s’ forcing him to slip away as she pulls Sherlock’s face towards her own. John frowns minutely until she makes direct eye contact with him while he watches her say something into Sherlock’s ear. He realizes then that Irene has seen him and is likely telling Sherlock that he’s here. John can’t say that that action makes him like the woman but it does earn her some points. Sherlock turns to look, and it appears he can’t hide the smile on his face as he finally sees John and Greg. John waves but he feels like his expression of discomfort doesn’t change much as Sherlock takes a step towards them. John’s frown deepens when he sees that Dorian manages to pull Sherlock toward him by the arm for a second, questioning him. Sherlock seems to say something to him and the boy’s hands slip away from his body as Sherlock turns to jostle himself the rest of the way towards Greg and John.
Molly jumps slightly at the address from him, surprised that the man is speaking to her, if it is her he’s speaking to, “Sorry?” She asks softly, looking at him in confusion.
“What? No, it's an olive green, it's very stylish. It fits really well, I'm telling you.” John insisted.
Sherlock grins, “Hmm, that’s probably true,” he agrees, “No, I was thinking of doing it the old-fashioned way – by asking you questions and letting you tell me about yourself.”
from? But he'd learned not to question Eurus' trains of thought by now. Her mind was faster than his own. Surely by now the observation she'd made that had brought about the comment will have been forgotten. “I wrote you another piece.” He’d answered instead, choosing not to acknowledge her odd statement. He had played for her a piece he’d written meant to explain that his fear from her comment of last week didn’t weaken his affection for her.
John searches his eyes in disbelief, “Listen to me, you beautiful idiot,” John replies, “you are going to tell me who in the fuck did that to you and if that piece of shit is still alive you’re going to point me in his or her direction so I can beat the living hell out of them.” John’s voice is alight with a righteous fury on Sherlock's behalf.
John and Greg exchange a look before following and standing at the bar with them. John makes sure to slip in beside Sherlock’s other side. Sherlock, taking his cue, loops an arm around his shoulder, effectively pulling himself away from Gray and leaning closer to John while Dorian reaches for a couple of the drinks which have already been poured. John thinks he sees a flash of something pass over the young man’s face as he hands one of the glasses to John and the other to Greg, who is standing on Gray’s other side, but the look is so quickly transformed into a pleasant smile that he almost thinks he’s imagined it.
The people in the pub laughed at Sherlock's antics and the room visibly relaxed as they raised their glasses alongside Sherlock, all saying, “To Alcohol!”
“... yes, fine, you win.” Sherlock reluctantly agreed, though his face looked calmer now, “But I'm still going to sneak into Mycroft's and
John nods, “If that isn’t the understatement of the century I don’t know what is,” then, “So you haven’t picked it out yet? Your street dance song?”
The boy grins excitedly and finally detaches himself from Sherlock to jump into John in an unexpected hug as a greeting. He smells of something sweet yet distinctly masculine that should be nice but only makes John crinkle his nose in disgust. He must be wearing too much. John gets a strong whiff of it as the boy speaks into his ear, almost making him sneeze, “It’s an honour Doctor Watson,” the boy praises, “I’m a huge fan of your stories!”
Jack squeezes John’s shoulder, and says, “You know what, Doctor Watson? I like your style. But don’t worry, we won’t have to. I’ll challenge the next person, and if I lose when their challenger comes, you can just follow what I did on your turn, or you can choose not to go and Algy can just go again. It’s up to you. It’s all about having fun anyway,” he shrugs, apparently very blasé about the whole thing.
As usual, no beta, no Brit-pick, and not edited because I’m lazy but also editing on mobile sucks and I’m too lazy to type it up on the laptop / desktop. Anyway enjoy~~
The expression on Sherlock’s face is now completely irritated, “Well what? Am I supposed to think otherwise Dr. John Hamish ‘I am not gay’ Watson?” He asks in a huff.
The video features a crowd of people in a circle, all of which are probably competitors of the dance show. Dorian is standing in the middle of the circle facing a beautiful brunette that John is sure he’s seen in other Strictly promotional videos. On the brunette’s side stands another brunette, this one with shorter messier hair, and a tall man, an actor John is pretty sure is named Algernon. He’d seen him on a BBC show about spies once. On Dorian’s side stand Sherlock and a young pretty blonde girl - the one that John had seen in Dorian’s promotional photographs featuring her as his dance partner on the show. The brunette is challenging Dorian in a sensual dance as the voice of the song playing in the background sings ‘l
“You’ve been sampling from a pool relatively above the average amount of times others in your circumstances would have, yet you are not enjoying yourself. Perhaps it is a matter of quality as opposed to quantity with you. I’m not quite sure. I think I need more data. Have you tried any women or just men?”
“Oof, bad luck old chum,” Algernon comments to John when he reaches him. He extends a hand for Jack’s jacket and John passes it to him, watching the dancers wordlessly. “It looks like they chose for you to go up against Sherlock,” Algernon continues.
John sighs, “Sorry. Alright, go on.” He says, waving her away. She tosses him his robe wordlessly as she leaves the room and he slips into it.
Just then Sherlock steps out from his bedroom, wearing nothing but one of his robes. His hair is still soaked from his shower and he looks positively delectable. Irene snaps a photo and sends it to her own phone.
“With the man who bullied me in college, by the way, so I think you get an extra prize for that.” Sherlock smiled ruefully at John.
“You should come upstairs for bed. Save some of that practice for the cameras. The producers are complaining that they don’t have enough footage of your practice session this week, and you still need to do your voice-over interview.
“Ugh. Boring.” Irene replies, “I suppose it’s just as well, I hate children. They always cry when I hold them.”
“Look, I know this isn't strictly within my jurisdiction, but I'd really like to help.” Sherlock said in a calm and convincing tone, “And with the heavy rain I suspect it'll be difficult for you to do this on your own, please, allow me to assist.”
Harry ignored it, “You're just very trusting and it's not your fault, I suppose,” she continued as she checked a point off on a sheet of paper on her board.
to be impossible. She has to do a double take, rubbing at one her eyes to make sure she’s not imagining it.
drives John mad. He thrusts up into the detective’s warm inviting lips, and savours teasing sensation of Sherlock’s light sucking. He groans at the feeling of Sherlock’s throat on a particularly deep thrust - melts at the touch of Sherlock’s fingers rolling his balls in his hand as dextrously as when he plays the violin. “Ah-hah.
’ He finds that thoughts about the implications of what the congratulatory text means disturb him. How long has John been watching him dance? And has he gone back to see the videos in which he’s not dancing? Did he hear the thing about the theme?
John had been excited, as usual, (and he’d thought Sherlock had been too) to go off on a long case together. He’d hoped that it would feel like the good old days - them dashing about with the blood pumping through their veins with the rush of adventure - and it had, for a moment felt like that. Sherlock had certainly seemed excited when he’d talked to John about the case in the beginning as well, but as the case had gone on, Sherlock had grown more and more... well, irritable was the only word for it. Anything John did had seemed to set him off. John had grown a bit annoyed by the end of the trip and when the case was finally over they had both been a bit distant from each other. Sherlock had twitched and flinched away from him when John had tried to talk to him on the way back, attempting to place a hand on his friend’s shoulder.
Molly frowns at Henry’s story— She had thought Dorian was currently in his early twenties. The man didn’t look a day over twenty, in fact. How could he have fallen in love ‘many years ago’ if he was in his early twenties now? Then again, Gray often did tell people he was older than he looked. If that was the case, she’d seriously have to ask him about his skin-care routine, because nothing about his fact looked unnatural. Then again, maybe his surgeons were just that good. She chooses to keep the question about his age to herself for the moment. She does, however, take the opportunity to ask about the girl. If the text Irene has sent her after Sherlock learned that Basil was a mutual acquaintance of theirs is true, then there might be something to the theory of Henry pushing away people Dorian loves. Who knows? Maybe Henry drove this girl mad himself. “How sad,” Molly mumbles, leaning slightly against Henry’s arm, “Did you ever meet her?”
“Hey! What did I say about looking back here and freaking out! That's twenty pounds down the drain!” John yelled back.
Henry smirks knowingly. “Oh, undoubtedly,” he says seriously as he walks them over to a long settee where Irene and Greg have sat down to join a few of Henry’s other friends while Victoria has run off to the bar. He gestures for Sherlock and Molly to sit while he waves down a pretty young waitress and asks her to bring over a bottle of champagne and drinking glasses for his new guests.
“Please, Algy is choppy and looks like he’s about to stomp on her - and Gladys really needs to learn what to do with her arms. She looks like she’s drowning,” Jack grins.
“Well they’re here for you, aren’t they? You could say it’s a logical question to ask you,” Molly responds mildly.
John notices that Sherlock’s breathing increases and the more he speaks, the more worried he looks so he decides to cut him off, “Alright, Sherlock, it’s alright. Don’t hurt yourself.”
Molly smiles as Tess and Claudia introduce this year’s new addition of professional dancers, the stage exploding with the glitter and glamour of the big musical number that will bring them to the stage. There’s a new male dancer from Spain, a fit young man with blonde hair and two elegant women, one tall with long red wavy curls and one of about average height with short blond hair and hazel eyes. The three look absolutely stunning as they spin onto the stage, dancing to a pumped-up modern version of a song Molly thinks is called ‘Sway’. She watches with admiration as the graceful dancers on the screen put up an amazing performance and subconsciously wiggles her shoulders to the rhythm. It’s a shame she can’t turn up the volume for fear of waking Rosie. Were she home alone Molly would probably be dancing along unabashedly. With a glance in the direction of her bedroom Molly slowly gets up to creep over and shut the door a little. She returns to the living room to grab the baby monitor while she wanders over to her kitchen in order to grab a snack while she watches the show. She can’t really hear what’s going on on the telly right now, but she figures she should grab a snack now before she misses anything more. She places a bag of popcorn into the microwave and waits patiently until it’s done. From there she quickly grabs a bowl, pours her snack into it and rushes back to the living room, baby monitor under her arm while she passes by her chair, stealing the throw blanket on it so she can snuggle into the couch comfortably.
Rosie merely giggles, allowing John to pull the little yellow top Sherlock had picked out for her over her head.
‘Wow, you really stepped in it this time, Watson.’ John thinks to himself, because that had to be it didn’t it? Why else would Sherlock have been so annoyed with him? Why else would he flinch away? ‘Definitely should apologize.’ John thinks. He knows they don’t normally do apologies or caring speeches with each other, but, well... John should really do better as a friend. Sherlock had withstood a beating from him while he was in a delicate state and had almost gotten himself murdered by a maniacal serial killer just to be able to speak to John. A simple apology shouldn’t be too hard, right?
John frowns slightly at Sherlock’s sudden pause but feeds Rosie her bite and patiently waits for Sherlock to start again.
Mycroft sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Alright Sherlock, one chance. If I don't like it you go back to commitments for the rest of your life with a big smile on your face.”
As they made their way up the road, Sherlock tried to think of a way out of this. He only hoped that by the time John noticed Sherlock was missing it would be too late, and if he did notice early, then sherlock hoped he wouldn't do anything stupid. He doubted he would, with the way he seemed to dislike Sherlock, even if he
Just as John is saying, “Well, I can't say I’m pleased about allowing her anywhere near Rosie…” Rosie stands up on the couch, hugs Sherlock around his neck and says “Don’t be angwy Daddy. I love Sherrock,” and then she gives Sherlock’s forehead a big sloppy kiss.
Irene had nodded, “Yes, it’s best to leave him alone,” she had agreed, “Some of his clients are rather particular about their privacy, you know, and Sherlock is very professional.”
John watches her move with a slightly concerned look on his face. She looks genuinely embarrassed and John begins - “Molly, are you alr-?”
Harry looked down, she couldn't look John in the eye for a second and she hesitated until she found her courage and looked at him imploringly, whispering, “Y-you're only going to say what I wrote, right?”
“It looks lovely. I haven't eaten anything, and let me give you some advice, do not drink whiskey on an empty stomach, I feel like I'm about to tip over into my own piss.” He laughed as John frowned at him.
Dorian bites his lip and sits back against the settee with Sherlock, “Yes,” he demures, “I hope you don’t mind. It’s just... I’m quite a fan of your work and… well, aside from Strictly dance practices and the two times you came out dancing with us, I’ve not gotten to know you like the others. You could say I’m quite curious about what you do. I mean, everyone else is either a musician, like myself, an actor like Algy or a dancer like Ceci and Jack. You’re different. A mystery, I suppose,” the boy shrugs, “But, also… well what I have gotten to see of you – it’s – I hope you don’t find me too bold in saying… I, well... I quite like you, Mr. Holmes.”
And oh god, that voice. Sherlock could kill a man with that voice. John ruts up into Sherlock’s hand, wrapping one of his own and helping Sherlock squeeze them tighter together still, following his hand and helping him increase the speed of their jerking.
had sent Irene those photos of Sherlock? Could it have been the man who is threatening her and her friends? Is he getting tired of waiting for Irene to find Hallward? Or does he already know the man is dead? And if so, why is this man looking for a dead person? Is he also looking for the killer? Or is it Henry who had sent the pictures? Does he suspect Irene and Sherlock of investigating him? Does he suspect Molly now? Is that why he’s trying to seduce her? Is he just leading her around in circles? It seemed to Molly that the more she thinks about this case, the more questions she has. How the hell does Sherlock do this all the time and not lose his mind?
“Second-class post, cheap card, bought at the petrol station. And look at the stamp. Three attempts at licking.” Sherlock pointed as he handed back the envelope, “Gigi's obviously unconsciously retaining saliva.”
“About Rosie knowing her name — don’t be angry with Molly. It was completely my fault. I—.” Sherlock stops, suddenly and takes a deep breath.
“Of course dear,” Mrs. Watson hugged John goodbye while Mary and Harry waved at him from the sofa. “We'll see you later John!”
“Shhhhh.” John quiets him, using his half-asleep hand to stroke through Sherlock’s curls comfortingly, the same way he’d done last night.
I tried to make it somewhat entertaining? :/ I dunno how i did tbh. I like it but uh I hope you do too.
Sherlock groans, “To hell with decent,” he replies, “I want you… and she woke herself up. Practically pushed me in here herself – the interfering old buzzard.”
“Come on,” Sherlock finally says around a smile, tapping John’s shoulder and straightening up his body, “Shove over so I can get clean. We won’t make it to breakfast if we dawdle any longer.”
Sherlock shivers at the thought. John grasps onto the hand stroking Sherlock’s cock and gives it two more pulls before removing Sherlock’s hand and pressing it to his side. “No more of that, now, Holmes,” John whispers against Sherlock’s belly. He brings his other hand towards the one still inserting a finger inside of Sherlock and pulls it out, pressing that one to the side as well, but releasing it in favour of spreading Sherlock’s thighs open himself. John gives Sherlock a sultry look and begins to crawl back, licking a trail down past Sherlock’s pubis, between his thigh and his pelvis and down lower and lower until he reaches his prize. Sherlock’s tight hole is already a little prepared from Sherlock’s eager finger, but now John is going to spread it open with his mouth.
They arrive back at 221B safe and sound. Since Sherlock had opted to leave his wine glass mostly untouched and had opted for water, he had driven them back home as well. The two men had chatted amiably the whole way and Rosie had interjected with her own observations from time to time.
“He wants to know someone’s location - but Sherlock… the person that he’s looking for - I’ve searched everywhere and as far as I know, they don’t exist. This competition was the only lead I had - the only indicator that this person might exist linked some money going into the competition through a company that works with the network that produces the show. And that same company also pays for part of the show’s production…” Irene had sat down in front of Sherlock and sighed as she looked down into her drink for comfort.
John doesn’t say anything until the poor frightened waiter stops talking, just stares at him evenly. To be honest John can’t really see what Sherlock saw in him. He’s rather short, like John, and yes, probably well built under that uniform, but his face isn’t particularly attractive. He looks like an ordinary bloke, his sandy blonde hair is cut short but in no particular style. “No.” John finally says, “I came to apologize. I was… bit not nice.”
John couldn't suppress the smile the silly comment brought to his lips. He sighed, “Fine, be a twat. All I'm saying is that this isn't just rubbish, these are the things that Harry believes make-up a life together.”
John finds himself entering the clinic early. He knows he’s not scheduled to come in just yet, but fuck if he knows what else to do. The other doctors are at least relieved to see him and no one questions him as he enters his office to begin his work day.
Sherlock is finally broken out of his reverie when Rosie awakens with a soft cry. She calls out for John at first, then seems to recognize she’s in Sherlock’s home.
“Of course, how silly of me to think so. The perfect doctor Watson having his wicked way with perfectly willing bridesmaids...”
Sherlock nods, “Yes, and I’m starting to think they’re right – no one has seen or heard from the man going on two years now. Even Mycroft is stumped.”
John though. He didn't answer his mother though, instead looking at Harry anxiously through the crack in the door.
John shook himself, “Right! Sorry, Mary this is my sister Harriet, Harry this is my Mary– no! I didn't mean it like that I–”
John grins, “That was a good day,” he sighs, eyes crinkling in mirth. He really had missed Sherlock.
“I’m not letting you anywhere near me, my hair or my outfit,” Lestrade tells him, “besides nothing your skinny arse owns would fit me.”
“Came to get a drink with my brother,” Harriet answered, but took Mary's arm and followed her to the bar, “Johnny,” She called for him to follow.
Sherlock glares at the tiny screen, huffs, considers firing off a message, then stomps to his room with his violin.
“Dadah!” Rosie whispers, holding onto the wall near the loo for leverage, “come!” She beckons (although it sounds more like “Tum!”) in the most adorably annoyed tone.
The man doesn’t move to put the garments on, opting instead to move forward, placing his free hand gently on Sherlock’s cheek and smirking. He looks at Sherlock from under his lashes through warm hazel eyes and gestures down towards Sherlock’s own swollen cock, “And how are you going to hide
“I don’t believe you have a heart,” Molly answers, and before he can cut her off with another one of his so-called-witticisms she tells him, “His name is Doctor John Watson.”
“Hello everyone.” John started, “In case you haven't already read this, I'll let you know that I have been to my fair share of weddings.”
. So, affair, unhappy, with Carter. But now there's her Mobile... or lack thereof. There's a cable for charging on but no phone? She had a lover but she doesn't have her phone on her? Why? There's a chance she's left it in her room, but then, there's a chance she didn't and the killer has it. But with the phone lines down, we've no way of calling it to see.” he finished.
Instead of the camera crew, he’s expecting at their home, however, he finds Molly Hooper, along with Rosie Watson seated in his living room. His heart nearly melts in joy as the little piece of John looks up and grins widely when she sees him. “Sherrock!” She squeals and runs/waddles to him, hugging his legs when she reaches him. (Irene winces in the corner of the room she’s sitting in reading a newspaper, and covers an ear).
John had smiled as Sherlock had left that night. He knew as he walked away that Sherlock would be true to his word, and there was an honour in that which John appreciated. Finally, he looked down and picked up the mobile phone, thoughtfully.
Anyway hope you enjoyed this. Don’t get used to the frequent updates. I’m known for my long hiatuses when life decides to kick me in the gut. I’ll do my best but I make no promises. Ttyl!
“No, John, don't apologize for that.” Mary said then, walking over to him with a coat in her arms, “In fact, you've done me a favour. It isn't your fault I almost stupidly decided to marry someone I barely knew. What was I even thinking? Right? I must have seemed terribly mad.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said walking up towards a car, John following close behind as the rain began to finally calm down.
Mary looked pleasantly stunned by that, “Really? Oh John, I'd no clue! I always assumed you were gay, what with your completely platonic friendship with Irene. I just assumed you were, you know,” she whispered, “in the closet.”
Irene stopped swirling in the chair and looked at him, raising an eyebrow, “Twice.” She declared, “Tell me that cute little crush is the reason you work yourself to the bone, because it's a little disturbing.”
like the linens. I think we need to rent new ones because they simply do not go with the colour scheme I picked out....”
Victoria stands to greet her with a hug while Henry, having heard Irene’s comotion, turns expectantly towards where Sherlock and Molly stand. Sure enough, the man seems pleased when he sees Sherlock and Molly begin to walk towards him. He turns away from his friends to come over and greet them. Well, to greet Molly, but he politely greets Sherlock as well when he arrives, putting his arms around both of them, saying,“Welcome, welcome, do come in,”
“What? I'm sorry Harry, it's just, he told me his name was William Scott and I'm just, I'm a little bit shocked, is all.”
Mary continued to look at him in the eyes, “Well- I-I... I just meant...” She stopped, searching him with a look, “I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?”
Sherlock grins again, “Later, John,” and taking Rosie’s little hand he instructs, “Watson, wave goodbye to your father.”
surprised Irene. The boy hadn’t pestered Sherlock once. Instead, he’d sat by Irene, which she’d found odd because she was sure the boy hated her and saw her as competition for Sherlock’s affection. He’d smiled at her and had engaged her in an amicable conversation. Irene is shrewd, however, and she had soon figured out why the boy was bothering her instead of Sherlock.
“Holy shit,” John’s girlfriend comments, “if they didn’t literally call him by his name or label it on the screen I almost wouldn’t believe it’s him.”
John feels his face heat up with embarrassment. Sherlock meant... so all this time? And John had thought...? Well, shit! He’d really fucked this up hadn’t he? And Sherlock is just looking at him, and he still looks sad, for some reason. Why is he sad? John loves him back! He has to know that... doesn’t he? But... he doesn’t does he? He’d just said that he can’t tell, with John. And that makes up John’s mind. If it isn’t obvious that John feels the same way for Sherlock, he’ll have to make it obvious, won’t he?
John shuts off the telly and lies back on the hotel bed. He sighs and rubs a hand over his face, suddenly feeling very tired. He picks his phone back up and scrolls through the few contacts on it. Somehow, he finds himself tapping on Sherlock’s name.
“Yes, John, great show of power there. You really showed him who the boss is.” Irene followed John towards his office.
“Do I have a problem with my b- er - lover adoring my daughter? No.” John bungles the sentence a little almost referring to Sherlock as his ‘boyfriend’. ‘
And that's how John found himself running around the pub interviewing people and writing notes for Sherlock Holmes as the people in the pub got progressively more and more pissed. Sherlock had gone upstairs to search for clues as John made most of the rounds doing interviews. John had spotted him come back a few minutes ago though, and saw him interviewing a man by the bar. The man didn't really seem too forthcoming. There was something about him that was vaguely familiar. John frowned. How had this day gone from planning Harry's wedding to illegally crime-solving with Sherlock Holmes, the bloody commitments columnist? He was starting to feel very paranoid.
He was doing his best to entertain himself by deducing as much as he could about the guests and bridesmaids when a slight movement from the groomsmen's side distracted him. He quickly roved his eyes over to the men to see what he could deduce about them. The first person he noticed was the woman in a suit with her hair up in a very chic looking style, scowling at someone, and the immediate second thing he noticed was the person she was scowling at, which was (surprisingly not the bride or the groom) the Best Man, –short, well-built, similar stature to the groom, military, blond and... bouncing up and down on his tows and anxiously (and mostly conspicuously) checking his watch...? Sherlock frowned a little at that. Had no one else noticed this? Really? It's not like the man was being subtle? He flicked his gaze to the guests... nope, all still staring at the bride and groom (
William stared at him for a few seconds, waiting for him to break. John said nothing and looked to the side. William relaxed his expression then, “Hmm. Not bad.” He stated, game apparently over as he took some chips from John's plate. “Hey may I have your drink?” William asked, already reaching for it.
Another note: this could have easily worked the other way around as well, with John being a wedding blog writer and Sherlock being an obsessive and amazing wedding wedding planner by deducing the couple's dream weddings or whatever... Consulting wedding planner! Dammit! Buuuuuut uhhhhh fuck it, this one works fine for now. Maybe I'll re-write it the other way after I finish this one. Anyways, enough rambling.
John looks at Sherlock sadly, “Don’t you?” He asks from where he sits. For once, the look on John’s face is open. It’s open and clear and Sherlock thinks – or he hopes that he’s reading it correctly. “John, you know I don’t.” Sherlock repeats, gently.
John gives Sherlock a look that indicates a slight bit of entertainment, “You know you’ll have to learn her name eventually.” He comments before taking a bite of his food.
John watches with barely disguised fury as Sherlock places a hand at the small of the man’s back and ushers him over to the bar. Once they get there Sherlock speaks first to a barista standing behind a counter and orders, presumably, the beverages he is clearly using as a pretext to talk to this “Josh” fellow. John seethes as predictably, Sherlock turns to Josh and whispers to him urgently. Josh looks like a deer in headlights as he nods along until finally they both laugh nervously. Sherlock says something else to him and then Josh hands Sherlock his notepad and a pen – and Sherlock smiles and says something else before he very quickly scribbles something onto the little book. John can’t see what Sherlock has written, but his deductive skills have increased exponentially since returning to more regular adventures with Holmes and John just knew that what Sherlock was writing down was a bloody phone number. Josh pats Sherlock on the back and scuttles away to the back, hopefully to do his goddamn job.
I might merge this and Chapter 11 together. And I might merge chapter 11 and chapter 10 together too... so they might become chapter 10 and that would be the end... But for now... Chapter 12 is the last one. Or I might merge chapter 10 & 11 into one chapter and the beginning of this with chapter with that one, making this Chapter 11 and the very last one. we'll see.
that his fat head will just have to wait. I've been rather busy, as he very well knows, attempting to solve the mystery and get the scoop on the most recent suicide, since he finally decided to listen to me after I told him for the millionth time that Anderson is an idiot and proved he was getting it all wrong. Besides...” He added, noticeably nervous, “...it's not finished and definitely not up to par with my standards yet.”
“Yeah... yeah but she er... she has flaws.” John cringed even as he said the words, “She does... she iiiis flawed...”
“Yes, well, I hope you don’t mind if I leave the dancefloor for a bit, Dorian,” Sherlock says loudly, “I’m afraid the good Doctor has two left feet and I could really use another drink.”
Sherlock’s shy smile turns into a full-blown grin and he stands up to pick up Irene and twirl her round in a circle before putting her down and kissing her cheek.
John pants breathlessly and his eyes cloud over at the thought. “Oh, god, yes.” He replies and begins to remove his shirt.
Sherlock made to turn to answer him when something caught his eye. He'd spotted the small hall closet filled to bursting with what looked like... “Wait... what are those...?” He asked suddenly, his eyes lighting up.
John stammered, “N-no. No! I – I don't know why I'm arguing this with a perfect stranger but yes, marriage like everything good and important isn't easy. Cynicism on the other hand, always is.”
“If I wanted anonymous sex with strange gay men I'd join grindr.” Sherlock deadpanned. “Besides, it's not going to matter much longer anyway. You're looking at my ticket out of taffeta hell!” Sherlock held up the little black diary with clear and obvious excitement.
Archie and Mary made their way into the church through the front doors. Harriet stood on one side handing out the Wedding Programs while a girl dressed identically like her stood on the other side, probably doing the same thing.
John smiles at her and adjusts her in his arms so that he can carry her in one arm and bring the tray over in the other. “Yep. Now come quietly - we’re going to bring him some food.”
Sherlock is still leaning back but now his arm has left his eyes and there's a look of defeat in his eyes as he stares at the ceiling. “You’re thinking too loudly. Stop it,” He says, sounding tired.
He tells John about the case excitedly over text. John replies immediately “Well, then, what are we waiting for?” Sherlock hadn’t asked John to come, thinking he might be reluctant to leave Rosie, but at the receipt of this text he has no other choice but than to invite him along. The case takes them out of town and it is many days before they solve it. They leave Rosie with Mrs. Hudson while they work on it. When it finally ends Sherlock is exhausted and a little frustrated. He didn’t think he’d mind bringing John. He’d hoped it would feel a little like the good old days, when it was just the two of them against the rest of the world. Unfortunately that had been exactly what it had felt like and it had unpredictably been more of a problem than a pleasure. Spending so much time with John when he can’t run off to let off some steam had made him a little irritable. The urge to touch him had become so strong and he now feels wound up with energy despite the exhausting case. It’s entirely annoying that his body chooses to keep betraying him like this. When they finally return to 221B it is late afternoon on a Friday. Sherlock gladly bids John and Rosie goodbye, waving them off with a promise to rest and to see them again soon. Not five minutes after they’ve left Sherlock has used the phone app he’d been using to find the men he’s been to spending time with in order to see if he can find some company for tonight.
Mary finally pulled away looking at him with a confused expression, one he was sure he was returning.
They settled at their mother's kitchen table as she served them some dainty sandwiches and tea. “Tuck in dears, tuck in,” she encouraged sitting down and taking two cubes of sugar for tea. “So, Harriet, how long are you back in London for love?” She asked.
He questions himself as soon as he sends it. Why had he assumed that Sherlock had meant dinner just between the two of them?
“Hmm,” Sherlock agrees, and hesitating slightly, asks, “... John? ... When you finish... perhaps a shower and then breakfast...?”
“No, Irene demanded it,” Sherlock answers, “I did consider asking my sister but she hasn’t been very stable lately. Keeps going on about how Mycroft let ‘Prince Charming’ maim her canary or… something. Mummy thinks She’s having mixed memories of things she’s done and a children’s cartoon we used to watch involving a princess who sang to animals and was rescued by a prince.”
HAPPENED MYCROFT?” He shouted as he slammed the door against the wall, “You said you were going to hold it! You
Sherlock's eyes filled with tears at the thought of leaving the commitments column now as he remembered some of John's first few words to him when he'd found out William Scott was actually Sherlock Holmes,
Sherlock and Irene drop to the floor of the now-empty studio panting and stinking of sweat. The other competitors had each trickled out pair by pair earlier as the filming had stopped. Eventually, it had just been the two of them left but Sherlock had kept them on a strict schedule of fifteen-minute breaks and then lifting getting back up to dance again. As he lies on the ground now next to an oddly quiet Irene he’s starting to feel regret for pushing her and himself to such an extreme, especially when they had both begun the day exhausted and hungover.
Sherlock grinned, “Yes exciting isn't it? Quaint little town, rain-storm, mystery foreign woman in your town, a secret affair, murder, and then two mysterious, but extremely handsome detectives from the Yard show up in your village and begin an investigation. It's all very film noir.”
The crowd and a couple of the judges explode into cheers. Finally, Irene and Sherlock break pose and walk over to the judges’ table.
John doesn’t know what he may have done to annoy Sherlock this time, but he doesn’t feel right leaving things like this. It bothers him, for some reason - the thought that Sherlock might be annoyed with him. Even worse is the thought that he might be relieved not to have to spend time with John. The thought worries him because... well what if Sherlock has decided that he’s still mad at John for... - and John realizes with horror that... well, maybe that’s just it, isn’t it? Maybe Sherlock hasn’t entirely forgiven John for all the pain he’s put him through. Sherlock went to hell and back to restore their friendship after Mary but... maybe John hasn’t done enough to repair it himself. He’s never been particularly good at communication. Sherlock has to know that doesn’t he? That he’s sorry? After all, John had told Sherlock, that day when they were trapped with a bomb in the secret underground tunnel. He’d told Sherlock “I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.” Sherlock had to know how awful he felt for the way he’d hurt him... but then... maybe he didn’t, and maybe that’s why he seemed so angry. He sighs, putting and arm behind his head as he stares sleeplessly up at the ceiling. He should really just talk to Sherlock. Maybe he’ll go tomorrow before work... maybe apologize properly, or something? He can go see him with the excuse of using Mrs. Hudson to watch over Rosie again tomorrow. After all, he still hasn’t told the nanny that he’s back yet, and Mrs. Hudson never seems to mind watching Rosie - she even often complains that John has bothered getting her nanny at all. He makes up his mind then. He’ll go see Sherlock tomorrow morning, an hour before he has to start work. Hopefully he’ll be up by then so they can talk. If anything, John will find out why Sherlock seemed so distant, and if it wasn’t John that had annoyed him, maybe there’s something John can do to help.
“I waited. I waited a long time for... but when y- when we met I... things happened. The universe got in the way and then nothing happened between us. And now I... Eurus suggested that perhaps... ‘scratching the itch,’ to be delicate, might be a helpful course of action. That perhaps if I had -and when I say
John stares with a raised eyebrow, wondering at whatever the hell it is Irene is doing but doesn’t comment on it. Instead he concentrates back on the conversation. “Do you think Dorian could be the blackmailer then? I mean, if they were lovers then he’d be the one looking for him wouldn’t he?”
“That's my girl,” John smiled, and took the hat. He quickly removed the tule and pink flower and rearranged it to look like a boutonniere. He then ripped off one of the pins from the hat and tied it to the back of his little make-shift boutonniere and tapped Len on the arm.
“Don't you think it's just a whole lot of ritual for something that let's face it, is basically an excuse to give a job to the family idiot? Not to mention the unlikely chance that the couples actually stay together forever instead of the more likely divorce or in some more interesting cases, the adultery or murder that inevitably tears them apart?” Sherlock prodded.
“As you all know,” Sherlock announced, “My partner Wohn Jatson – sorry no... that's wrong... Wat Johnson– no, no!
He’d had sex, but that sort of carnal pleasure could never make him play a song like this. No, this song was more than that. This song was Love, with a capital L, and Eurus didn’t know why the capitalization of the word was important, or indeed why it felt so accurate that it was, but she could almost feel it, just by listening to the sound of it. She could almost taste it on her tongue and feel it on her skin and it – It was beautiful.
John ran his fingers on the scraps of fabric of the little table. The suit had been ruined beyond repair. He picked up a piece of what looked like the sleeves and felt his eyes sting in pain while Harry turned and chattered away with the seamstresses.
The words seem to hit John and for a moment he looks angry. He surprises Sherlock when after a calming breath he tells him: “I don’t mind that Irene texts you, Sherlock. I don’t mind that at all. I told you. I just want you to be happy.” He licks his lips attempting to pick his words carefully, “But it’s different with Molly because you obviously don’t feel anything for her.”
“Irene is here because of a case,” Sherlock starts,  “There’s this man — he’s threatening her girlfriend and some of her friends. The man is looking for someone named Hallward, and he thinks Irene can get to him somehow. Irene tried but since it’s Kate’s life on the line she told me she’d prefer my help. To tell the truth, we’ve been working on this for ages but the two of us are almost stuck.” He takes a bite of his food and waits until John has fed Rosie to continue.
The girl smiled at them, “Well, ya done brilliantly, you two. And hey, thanks for the drinks, mate.” She said, tapping Sherlock's end of the table and leaving as Sherlock said, “Yup no problem.”
“Good, um that’s good, yeah it’s about, oh, three minutes, maybe?” John speaks as he tries to look out to the street to assure himself of his location.
Sherlock was ecstatic, he'd finally had a chance to talk to John. He was amused at the man's embarrassment as they sat in the cab together. Sherlock smiled, not able to hold himself back as he turned to John and said, “Nice abs by the way.”
John smiles as he feels his pounding heart calming down in his chest. “You’re too good at that.” He murmurs.
John sighed once he was outside and took in a huge gulp of air, doing his best to calm down. He felt rather than heard as someone followed him out and looked at him. John swung round slowly to look at them.
The week after that: Mary Morstan not taking patients for the past half hour due to phone call with... Watson, H. (John takes all her patients that morning. Accidentally makes a kid cry.)
“And today,” John was said, a false smile still plastered on his face, “Harriet and Mary still share the same values.” A photograph of Mary and Redbeard playing and a photograph of Harry messily devouring some ribs.
“Where are we going?” John shouts as the blaring music surrounds them and the crowd seems to grow thicker in front of them.
“We'll just have to go have a talk with her, I suppose.” Dimock said, “And we should check Jenny's room. See if she left anything.”
Mary's smile was slightly less entertained at that one, even Irene frowned at the photos even as some people in the room continued sniggering.
But he’s actually like really fucking sad about it and he’s like: why am I sad? (Spoiler alert [for John]: it’s cuz ya love him, ya dumb fuck)”
for me blinded you. That you can’t always tell what I’m thinking because you’re afraid it’s wishful thinking on your part!” He teases.
John nodded in agreement, “Maybe, but I think you should just admit that you're actually really sweet, and that this whole cynical thing is just and act so that you seem 'wounded', and 'mysterious' and 'attractive',” He said, keeping his eyes on the wall of alcohol before him, apparently not having realized what he'd just said.
“Thank you.” Sherlock said in his most civil voice when John opened the door. Sherlock waited. John stared at him expectantly. “May I come in?” Sherlock asked.
PS. I have a list of songs that I'm plotting for buuuut I actually am having a hard time picking the tango song - I've narrowed down my choices to a string quartet version of "Back to Black" by Amy Winehouse, and a string quartet version of "Señorita" by Shawn Mendez and Camilla Cabello. I like the lyrics of both because they kind of go with the story. Buuut I'm still hemming and hawing over it.
John has texted Mrs. Hudson early on this morning, asking her for permission to bring Rosie over. She’s already answered with a very enthusiastic “Yes,” so John is basically at 221 Baker Street at a quarter past eight in the morning. He doesn’t have to be at work until ten so this gives him plenty of time to speak with Sherlock. John’s hands feel incredibly steady and he feels a rush of adrenaline much like how he feels when he’s about to rush headlong into danger. Mrs. Hudson gets the door, a happy smile on her face as she takes the still sleeping Rosie into 221A with her. “Oh, she’s such a love.” She coos. “I’ll put her straight to sleep right next to me by the couch.”
“Oh!” Dorian says, turning to her, his eyes suddenly sparkling, “Would you be interested in coming along, dear Iris?” He asks Irene, though his eyes betray him as they trail over to Sherlock.
“It’s good to see you, Henry, and congratulations on your… ? ” Sherlock greets in return, allowing the sentence to drift as he really has no idea what the hell the guy is celebrating.
He feels Sherlock’s breath puff against his ear even as their bodies begin to pull apart from the embrace, “Are you joking? I’m in agony. There are so many of them,” he practically shouts into John’s ear, gesturing at the crowd despite the fact that his face is still close to John’s own in order to be heard over the blaring music.
“Me? Excuse me, what about you? You ran off into the night with a serial killer. You were about to take a fucking poisoned pill.”
“Anaphylactic shock?” Sherlock asks Molly of the body as she tries to recover from what she’s just said and attempts to ignore Iris’ mischievous expression at her response.
Sherlock boops her nose, “Your grammar skills are appalling. I shall have to have words with your father.”
John thinks as he finally starts to try to move a little differently, trying not to feel self-conscious, and then his sister's voice returns in his head, saying, ‘
“Thrilling that you know that,” Lestrade comments, teasing him, “It’s called hyperbole, Sherlock — I’m
Sherlock subtly rolled his eyes and sat back. John tried pressing on the gas. The wheels spun in the mud but the car didn't budge. It was stuck. They were stuck in the middle of nowhere... in the fucking rain... with each other. John wondered how long it would be before Sherlock pissed him off again and John snapped. If he killed him now and no one was around to hear, was is still murder? Yes, definitely... so, best calm down and try to find a way out.
Sherlock is like: this isn’t what you think. I’m sleeping with him because I like him. (Or something equally as suggestive of a relationship)
my boyfriend!” Sherlock calls after him, which only makes Greg laugh and wave at them without turning around.
“Just don't listen to him. Besides we all know who the bigger man is, between the two of you, if you know what I mean.” Harry winked.
Sherlock closed his eyes, not able to believe it. “Alright, what else have you got? Show me some more.” Sherlock demanded, his lips curving up as he flicked his hand out in the direction of the closet.
“Nope, that’s fine. Three minutes is perfectly fine. I’ll see you soon John.” Sherlock says, hoping his voice doesn’t betray his sudden panic.
John smirks, “It’s breakfast food, yeah, but it’s dinner time. And it’s not my fault all you have is eggs, bread and bacon.”
Angelo nods his acknowledgment, but first opens the bottle of wine and pours each of the men a glass. He then punctures the straw in the juice box and passes it to Rosie, who makes grabby hands at it and says “Thank you!” While greedily taking a large sip of the juice through the straw as soon as she gets it. Angelo ruffles her hair in fondness.
of it! He attended two on Saturday alone! But this won't just be about him. It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding industry has transformed something which should really not be regarded so highly in the first place to some corporate revenue stream poorly disguised as a sham fantasy..." Sherlock stopped, realizing how cynical that sounded and amended, "You know... in a fun... 'upbeat', 'cheerful,'”(Sherlock shuddered at the word,) “kind of way.” He leaned against Anthea's desk and implored his brother, “Look Mycroft, I'm dying of boredom back there in commitments. You know what happens when I get bored. I swear to you if I have to write another sentence about baby's breath I will shoot myself and you'll be to blame for all this. Mummy won't be at all pleased with you about that, nor will Mrs. Hudson when she spies the amount of blood that will smatter her walls after I blow my brains out. This is a
Josh’s smile grows into something more reassuring and he says, “Nah, little lover’s spat, that’s all.”
Harry smiled and took a sip of her juice. "Thanks John." She said, then sat herself down on the carpet to have the rest of her juice. John smiled back and walked over to a long mirror situated a couple of steps away. He was staring at his smart-looking suit and fiddling with the tie when he heard a loud yell in a rough male voice shouting somewhere behind him.
John really can’t tell if he’s being serious, “... Sherlo- really?! Greg Lestrade??” He asks, and he almost laughs at Sherlock’s expression as he bodily turns towards John in shock at his question. “Lestra-!” Sherlock exclaims, “Wait -
Sighing, Sherlock returns to his meal but begins to push the food around on his plate, rather than choosing to eat it. John takes the opportunity to continue to feed Rosie and waits patiently until Sherlock starts again. Sherlock’s eyes are on the table as he speaks, seemingly not able to meet John’s gaze for some reason, “I was called in and here we are, six weeks into a celebrity dance contest with the stress of people filming us and following us around during the week. We have to find all these ‘little cases’ as you call them - barely threes let alone fours - to distract the camera people and on top of that we have to keep ourselves in the contest until we figure out anything we can about the man Irene is supposed to find because finding him may lead us to who is threatening Irene and her people. Or, if worst comes to worst, we have a bargaining chip to keep Kate safe. In any case, the two of us have been trying, very unsuccessfully not to get distracted, but with everything seeming to happen at once… we’re a bit… well overwhelmed if I’m honest.”
After walking in silence with nothing but the raging storm around them for about an hour and a half they arrived at a little pub on the edge of the small village soaked to the bone. John found the phone on a wall to the left. He found immediately that it wasn't working. He turned to Sherlock with an expression that clearly read, 'Nope, we're fucked.;
Dorian flicks a shy glance at Sherlock and nods, agreeing, “Oh, and too fast – she’ll slip if he keeps leading her too quickly.”
Sherlock, however is predictably looking at the dead body Molly has just stitched up and not paying them any attention.
“Oh, yes you can, a good writer can.” Sherlock said motioning for the bartender to pour them another shot.
Sherlock awakens with the second-worst hangover of his life. He feels around for his phone until he remembers, Irene still has it. He sighs and lets his head fall back down on his pillows. He should get up. He should really get up. He doesn’t want to get up. He continues to lie in bed with an arm tossed over his eyes as Irene walks into the room, happily greeting him by placing something on the bedside table then proceeding to bounce onto the bed, saying, “RISE AND SHINE SWEETHEART!”
John realizes that he’s been silent for far too long and Sherlock looks like he’s about to run. John can’t let that happen - he won’t let that happen. In an instant, John grabs hold of Sherlock’s shirt and shoulder, flips himself over the other man and pushes Sherlock down onto the couch. He looks into Sherlock’s eyes, and they’re a mix of confused and terrified and that just won’t do. John gives himself a determined inward nod and just goes for it - his lips meet Sherlock’s in a desperate kiss and John is relieved when he finally feels Sherlock relax and whine into his mouth.
John rolls his eyes at that comment and mutters, amused, “Yeah I bet it was hard for you to hold back on that one, wasn’t it, Holmes? Bloody show-off.”
John finally cracks and starts giggling, “Sorry! Sorry! It’s just that, well he’s the only half-way decent straight bloke that you know, isn’t he? At least, as far as I know...” he pauses then because Sherlock has a strange expression on his face as he simply stares at John unblinkingly, “What?! Why are you looking at me like that?”
“So it is,” John smiles tenderly at her and sits on the couch to watch with her. Rosie sits perfectly still in her playpen, mesmerized by the narrator speaking to the big fat onscreen dog on a rocking horse. John’s mind begins to wander as he sits, barely paying any mind to what’s happening.
Sherlock pouts slightly, but complies, pulling back and off of John in one last long motion. He kisses the head of John’s cock once more but then crawls back up over John’s body and lays on him. He has half his face pressed against John’s chest and he brings a hand up to trace a pattern on his pectorals.
Sherlock looks at John again now and says, “a few weeks go, Irene and I wanted to perform a… not so legal test at the lab… we thought we had a link to the man threatening Irene - we were wrong and that’s a long story —but the point is that we snuck into Bart’s. Of course, there was a problem. Molly was in. I knew she wouldn’t let me use the equipment unless I explained myself so…”
ps. The title means "Where are you? Come back" I had a hard time picking a title for this one. I almost named it clusterfuck.
“Sorry John! She exhales - Rosie’s just in my bedroom sleeping. I’ll go fetch her. Meantime, won’t you come in?” Molly gestures at the hall.
Mary smiled and turned to look at John who was having a very hard time hiding the surprise on his face as Harry made a grab for the tux instead of the dress. Harry turned to John then, “Oh, Johnny you don't mind do you?” She asked.
“His eyes are flickering. Is he waking up?” This sounded more like Mycroft's voice. Sherlock felt himself grimace. Of course Mycroft would be here to ruin his fantasies of John. God he must be really high.
John arrives at the nightclub in a cab as Sherlock had suggested. He figured it was probably best not to show up in his car anywhere near the celebrity club and risk not being let in by a bunch of snobs, even if Sherlock had promised to come and get him. He takes a deep breath and hopes that the outfit he’s chosen is good enough. He’d decided that since Sherlock hadn’t specified about the club’s dress code that he would go with something simple. He wore a light smoked salmon coloured top with a dark navy jacket and burgundy trousers that stopped just above his ankles, along with chestnut coloured loafers and a matching belt. He’d forgone wearing a tie, thinking it was probably best that he looked laid back. He’d also run just a bit of product into his hair again, though he hadn’t been able to shave his stubble because his shaving kit had been in the master bathroom. He did regret not bringing a coat though, as the night air was somewhat cold.
Sherlock considers both options with a thoughtful look, “I don’t know how much of a trollop do you want to look like?” He grins.
The sides of the pews were decorated in lovely white ribbons and pretty pink roses to match the flower arrangements that had been spread around the church for this special day. It was classically romantic, with the smell of roses and candle wax perforating throughout. John thought it was perfectly lovely.
Eurus looks at him with pity then and says, “Oh, Sherlock. Always so sentimental.” She picks up her violin, “let me play you a song.” She holds her breath, looks Sherlock dead in the eyes and plays the first of his songs he’d ever played for her - the one he’d written those years ago during Christmas, when John had thought that Sherlock wrote it because he was in love with Irene. The song he’d written when John had said, ‘I’d say he was heartbroken, but then, it’s Sherlock, he does all that anyway,’ correctly deducing Sherlock’s state of mind, but incorrectly deducing for whom his heart was yearning for.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed, “Fine...” He admitted. John waited in anticipation, “... When the bride walks in and she makes her big superfluous entrance... I like to glance back at the poor bastard waiting at the altar, because even though I believe he's an idiot for willingly entering into a useless commitment during a huge idiotic ritual, they... well they always look incredibly... happy... and for some reason, I...” Sherlock stopped.
you thought I was attractive.” Sherlock smirked, saying it a little loudly as the bartender brought them their drinks.
Sherlock hesitated, “... freak.” He said, speaking softly, then, more cheerily “But come on, John! We've a murder to solve.”
“Oh.” John answered, then smiled weakly, “Well... I've been better. I've been worse, mind you, but... I'm just going to try and get through it.”
Dimock nodded, “That sounds like a good plan. Come on Carter, let's get down go see if Fred's here yet.”
. His throat feels incredibly dry and he licks his lips subconsciously as he recalls the way Sherlock’s muscles had rippled in the light of the dance club while he moved. The way he’d had so much control over his body, and the way even his sweat-covered hair had seemed to dance along to the music with the rest of him as he tossed his head back in ecstasy — all of it was just...
She’d been bugging him on and off ever since and finally he’d cracked. At first he’d wondered why she was so adamant, but then, one evening after a particularly long case, Sherlock had found himself in John’s home as they both made sure to relieve the poor nanny of her duties. They’d checked on the sleeping baby and had then left to sit in the living room and have a few drinks and watch telly while still occasionally giggling about the crime scene they had left every time they caught a glimpse of each other’s eyes. Sherlock had felt his throat suddenly restrict with longing and Eurus’ words and song had come to mind. ‘Fine,’ he’d told mind-palace-Eurus, ‘I’ll go have sex as soon as I’m able, but just so you know, you are simultaneously a genius and the absolute worst.’ Mind-palace-Eurus had simply laughed. He was sure real-Eurus would do the same.
John looked at her incredulously, “Irene, you've always been the one to tell me I need to stop being so polite and stand up for myself.”
Sherlock raises a brow, “I wouldn’t call it a verified fact,” Sherlock starts, but at John’s skeptical look adds, “— BUT you could perhaps persuade me to say that there is a compellable argument in the merit of using the word in cases such as these.”
Josh finally looks over to John, as if noticing him for the first time and laughs nervously (and whether that’s because John is shooting daggers at him or because he feels guilty for not noticing him sooner, John isn’t sure) saying, “Oh, my, yes of course. So nice to meet you, Sir, I’m an… acquaintance of Sherl-lock’s,” he fumbles over Sherlock’s name, his eyes shifting to Sherlock for guidance, as if he were about to call him ‘Sherls’ again, and that just makes John want to punch him more.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment as he kept driving. At first John wasn't sure he'd heard him, but then Sherlock finally yelled back, “She was so happy on her wedding day, John. Not a single word I said in that article was wrong. It had all been so perfect... I admit at first I didn't know it was her, and that I'd be doing this were it Jennifer Wilson or not, but now I know it's her I simply must find out what happened... John I... this is what I did, before... before everything. It's what I
“Oh yes, sure let me just write you in, except, oh wait – YOU ALREADY DID, EVERY SATURDAY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR!”
For now, I ask you to enjoy the updates, again, while you can. Hopefully I can finish this before school starts.
Sherlock whines as John begins to interchange his swirling tongue with a finger, opening him wider. Sherlock feels his legs trembling as John works him open. He brings his free hand up over his eyes and pants, thinking to himself, ‘
“God, Harriet, you don't care.” John said facing her as he spoke, and pointed at her “You don't give a shit about anyone but yourself, do you? I have made excuses for you ever since father died when you were little but enough is enough.” He finished angrily and started storming out.
“Yes, darling, you were amazing- absolutely fantastic!” John says then, looking to Sherlock, he suddenly has an over-powering urge to stay with him longer, “We should celebrate. Dinner?” John asks.
Sherlock takes the opportunity to pretend he’s enjoying a moment to relax and texts John to let him know he’s at the club.
Molly snorts, “I’m sure you would,” she answers just as she notices Sherlock walking back onto the dancefloor with his hand raised in the air, carrying some kind of cocktail while his other hand tugs John Watson into the throng of people surrounding them.
She also snoops every chance she gets. She reads through countless work-related emails from people begging him to solve their cases. She delights in solving some of them herself and replying to the emails with what she considers to be appropriately surly Sherlockian answers. One day he walks by her as she blatantly types into his phone a response to a woman who was whining about an obviously cheating husband. He smirks and comments over her shoulder, “Just wait till you get to the one about the lingerie.” Irene immediately abandons her surly email to search for it. She isn’t disappointed.
does. Your gross exaggeration of that fact is not only incorrect but incredibly sexist, and quite frankly I am appalled if not offended on your sex's behalf." (Molly smacked him playfully at that as Sherlock smirked and dodged the hit), "Second, you overestimate how far our readership actually reaches. We're the London journal, Molly.
John’s stomach feels like it drops at Sherlock’s reaction, because Sherlock – bold, abrasive, ‘romantic-entanglements-might-be-fulfilling-for-
John walked into his office at the clinic two days later and saw a pile of sticky notes littering his desk. “Sherlock, Sherlock,
“It's no problem, besides,” John winked, trying to lighten the mood “I've more experience eating than Harry, so you're in good hands.”
John's face fell even more than he had already felt it falling, “Ugh, God, What?” He asked as he looked up into the sky and did his best to pull back his tears. He would not cry in front of Sherlock fucking Holmes. He looked at him with frustration, “Why are you here?”
John is almost amused at Sherlock’s stuttering. The man is so rarely speechless. The only other time he’d been like that had been when John had asked him to be his best man, except now, of course, Sherlock has a sort of combined pleased-confused-scared expression on his face that John can’t quite figure out.
“I came back from Afghanistan feeling like utter crap,” He began, “I was shot in the shoulder just above my arm, as you can see. Scar's still there,” he gestured with one hand at the healed-over bullet wound, “I had an intermittent tremor in my left hand, making it impossible for me to ever perform surgery again. I fell into a sort of depression. I was useless, no good to anyone... then I met an old friend, Mike, at a park in England. He invited me as his plus one to some mutual classmate's wedding. Shit happened and I ended up helping out with it somehow. It was good though. It felt good to be needed for a moment but... that's all it was. A moment, until I met Mary. She was a bridesmaid at the party. She was so smart, so beautiful, so charming and so perfect.” John sighed, “I think I felt I loved her instantly. So, naturally, when she asked me to work at the clinic with her, I said 'yes'. And she made me feel useful again. She gave me a job helping people and she allowed me to assist her as much as she needed, knowing that I needed this. She encouraged me to follow through with helping friends during weddings, also knowing how much I enjoyed it. She helped me get back up on my feet after I had plunged myself into a deep and horrible darkness. She... she saved me,” He finished, “I'd have done anything for her. Anything.”
John dashed out of the cab (now changed into a very dapper and simple white Achkan with gold trim) into the indian theme decorated wedding venue. Knowing Mike, he'd be freaking out about the wedding and John had to be there to talk him round. He only hoped he wasn't too late.
“Love is patient, love is kind, love means murdering your wife when you've lost your mind.” Sherlock drawled.
Sally shrugs, but smirks, “Probably. D’you think he helps him rehearse?” Her smirk becomes a bit more suggestive, the implication clear in her voice.
Ps. I’m planning a short epilogue with Eurus, btw. Hopefully it gets done, but if it doesn’t, enjoy this as your ending chapter. The smut and copious kisses are my gift to you. Thank you for your patience, love and support of this short story.
Sherlock didn't seem to hear John, or notice his irritation as he continued on his spiel, “Of course you can't tell him because you're
John nods, “Ah yes, of course. You’re an… actor, right?” John says, snapping his fingers as if trying to remember the detail, even though he knows Dorian is a musician.
Mary stood from her seat instantly, “That's great. Really, great, Harriet.” She walked away without another word.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “You told me he seemed to spend more time with her than anyone. Just because it's
Ironic how I named it "Now Kiss" But I don't mention them kissing in the very very end. I couldn't find a way to end it with the kiss and it all sounded cheesy. I decided to end it with an almost direct quote from the film so that it would end the same way I started it. Completely unoriginally. :P And they kissed after the love confession sooo... technically you have your kiss.
“Aww, Sherlock, but we’re so obsessed with your tragic love story!” Claudia pouts and whines falsely.
They spend the next few minutes of the meal in relative silence. Sherlock spends them feeding Rosie and himself and speaking to her quietly as he eats. He tells her about the temperature at which the eggs they’re eating turn from viscous liquid into the gelatinous solid they have become now and about the fats in the bacon melting away, also with added heat, to create this salty treat. John spends those minutes sitting at the edge of the bed, watching them with a soft pleasure while taking a short video as well as snapping a few photos to keep. They are so beautiful together.
She’d danced happily the whole time he played and when he’d finished she’d played a song for him in return. “I love you.” It said. “I love you so much I can’t stand it.” The song was so beautiful it had almost made him weep. It was sad, and confused and so full of a longing for forgiveness and affection but wild and destructive at the same time. Eurus felt so strongly that she didn’t know what to do with herself. It was heartbreaking. Sherlock understood all too well. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” He’d promised, encouraged to come see her again by her song.
Sherlock turns his attention back to Rosie for a second to feed her, smiling softly. “I’m very sure, John. Enjoy your risotto, please.”
Sherlock leans back in his seat again with an eye-roll, “How many times?” He mutters, then coming forward again hisses, “I told you the texts between her and I have never meant anything- at least not in the way you think.” He rubs a hand tiredly over his face and continues, “She’s a lesbian, John, and I’m pretty sure you know that since she
John tries to backtrack, “No, I mean, I know he can be a dick, but what I mean is, he’s a dick to everyone, not just you-”
“Oh… er…” Sherlock looks to John, blushing brightly and at the very clearly angry expression on John’s face becomes puzzled, which makes him fumble for words some more, “I’m just having breakfast with my er…” and he wants to say partner or boyfriend, but the way John is looking at him, he isn’t sure he should, so he just lets the sentence hang.
Sherlock and John looked at each other with raised eyebrows. Sherlock shrugged and they turned to watch as a young man walked over to the hysterical woman and helped her up. “Wanda, hey, calm down. Talk to me, what happened, who's dead?” He asked.
John was still looking when Sherlock turned around, staring at the ground, “Ah... I forgot.” He pulled a small smart-phone out of his pocket. “I got this for you. It's...” Sherlock licked his lips, “It's a gift, so you don't have to carry around that insane journal from nineteen-eighty-seven with you anymore. It'll take care of... all of your appointments and the other things you might need to do...” John rolled his eyes, in annoyance as Sherlock finally looked up at him, saying, “It's... perfect for starting your life over again.” He held the phone out towards John, smiling weakly.
became partner to a world-famous detective, didn’t you? People really are quite versatile aren’t they?”
“Okay, have fun!” Harry shouted, and when Mary was out of earshot she asked, “What is she talking about? What finger work?”
“Yes,” John answers, “but one of her friends has a thing with her kids on Thursday — Wait, hang on,” he begins, suddenly realizing something “—how do you remember that but not...?
Uh - sweats profusely - I might have to change this into an official "cross over" fic because Dorian Gray, Henry, Algy, Ceci and the rest of the Wilde gang have all become official not-in-the background characters. You don't need to have read any of their stories for the next few chapters to make sense, though so don't worry. Um but if you've never read Dorian Gray... I will be spoiling one thing for you – though I have changed many details of his story to fit mine. And it's probably better you guys don't get emotionally attached to any of them because at least one or more of them is going to ... not live till the end. Probably. I want to kill one or two. I already killed Basil and he didn't even get any lines (he's also my favorite ;-;) so... *shrugs*
Sherlock shrugs, “Honestly I was thinking you could help me play along with a little ruse – it’ll probably work best if he thinks I’m drunk. I should get more alcohol before we go get him.”
John huffs, “You know if that if we try to stop him he’ll come back with a random freshly-killed lobster or something, don’t you?”
The two lay there, panting, their hearts slowly coming down from the adrenaline of the moment. Neither of them has the strength to even move. "That- that- was..." John breathes.
gay. It isn’t a shock. John sort of assumed Sherlock didn’t necessarily care about labels like that (or gender, really) but he never wanted to assume that he had a preference. So,  he’s gay, then. He’s gay and he has fallen in love with a straight bloke. And he’d waited for him but nothing had ever happened between them because this guy, whoever he was, would see Sherlock’s gender as a barrier... John feels a lump in his throat for Sherlock’s sake. It’s a sad situation, but probably not an uncommon one. His heart aches for him. It must be very difficult for Sherlock, to feel like that and not be able to have what he wants. But then John wonders at who it could be. Who in their right mind could be friends with Sherlock and not think he was a great man? Who is it that Sherlock had waiting for all that time? Who is it that Sherlock is actively trying to forget by...?
John tries not to be rude and politely shakes the kid’s hand when he pulls away to offer it. The young man grins and shifts to the side looking between him and Sherlock - “Wow! The famous detective and Doctor Watson! You’ll have to excuse me being star-struck!” He laughs, eyes glittering, and John hates the fact that the little bastard seems so nice.
