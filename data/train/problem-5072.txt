Tony: I thought someone might tell you, that we had a fling that one time. Or you might see the gossip somewhere, they tend to dig the dirt up in situations of this type. So I thought you should probably hear it from me.
The medic had been rummaging around in her satchel, but now she looked up. "Sense," she muttered. "From a... you're a pilot, right? Sense from a
he corrected himself. He also hadn't wanted to look for Steve because he hadn't wanted anything to do with him. Remembering the past was okay, he'd told himself. Both the good and the bad. You couldn't unhappen it. And Tony had evidently cared, more so than he'd liked to admit back then, or otherwise he wouldn't still feel so raw at every thought, every memory (he wouldn't be having these swarming feelings now, either). But actively looking for the man, checking up on him –that would have been too much. He'd had to draw a line somewhere because otherwise he'd have gone crazy.
Tony talked right over him. "...about us, don't be. We don't have to... We can just be friends. Two friends who've fucked – sorry, I know you don't care for that sort of language – but we can just. Resume our previous..."
Natasha inclined her head for a moment, raising an eyebrow, as if debating this with herself. "Perhaps. But would he still take part if someone else was the leader?"
Once they are a bit further down the corridor, they pause. Steve is in front of him. His hair is sweaty, the shape of his shoulders so close and familiar. Tony knows Steve's cheeks are probably still burning, his eyes still bright, and yet, once dressed, he suddenly seems unapproachable again. Which is – well, its ridiculous, probably.
"I think we're past that phase," he adds then, and that's another truth. "I think we've moved past friendship into a whole new territory."
"I never even stopped to think, Tony," he said, addressing the other man even though he felt like he was telling this to himself. It only now hit him how little control he'd had over his actions. That was sobering.
He jumped out of bed, to the background noise of angry, sleepy mutters of his dorm mates. There was nowhere to pace, here. If he hadn't been at war with the tech, he might have gone down to the landing bay to fiddle around with something. It always helped settle his nerves.
Had the gravity been stronger, Louis would have been crushed by the contents of a storage room that good spilled into the corridor. As it was, he just looked dazed. It seemed he got hit in the head. There was a faint trickle of blood on his temple, down his cheek, but at the first glance he didn't seem to have any serious injuries.
Tony: I just got a call. It happened. He seems... more placid than Brucey tended to be in his day. Just sits there. He's not talking. They don't know if he can turn back into Ross or not, or what his triggers are or anything. But he doesn't seem to be an immediate threat.
The other techs didn't take the news as well as Darryl, though. One woman buried her mask-covered face into her hands. One man – Steve recognized him as Dale – covered his mouth with both his hands trying – unsuccessfully – to mute a loud whimper that escaped from his lips.
Tony: Because, see, I had fucked up dreams long before any of this particular brand of shit hit the fan. You've been dying in mine ever since 2014. I think.
He and Steve decided to tell their friends together. But now, as Steve gets back from the bathroom, he spots Tony, and Tony spots him, and they are in each others arms before they can remember what they agreed. Tony feels instantly invigorated, and the feeling is at the same time like coming home after a long day and having the first sip of coffee in the morning.
Tony feels like a puppy on display in a pet shop window. Not that he's not used to it, but this is not the time to put on a brilliant smile and start oozing confidence, which is his usual shtick.
With, it seems, a new determination, he takes a deep breath. "I would like to be the one tied up. That's what's, ah, interesting to me." His eyes wander towards the floggers for a moment, and it's all Tony can do  not to push him against the wall and just take him there and then, rules be damned.
He sighed. Took a deep breath. Remembered what they were to each other, out there in real life, outside of this corridor and this weird little conversation that seemed to contain so much more than what was being said.
he'd thought, too tired to work up a strength for flipping a bird in the general direction of Cap's office. After that he crashed and slept like he hadn't slept in ages.
I shrugged. "Look, Tony," I said. "I wish I knew what to tell you. I was offered a chance and I jumped on it. I didn't ask too many questions. I should have, I suppose." I shrugged. "Maybe I'm of no consequence any more. Maybe I'm done. Maybe I can't change anything significant any longer..."
He took a deep breath. "Steve," he started again, with some apparent hesitation. Still, there was more than a hint of warmth in his voice. I looked up, met his eyes. His use of my first name nestled inside my chest, precious, even though I couldn't tell him something like that. "I
"No," Tony cuts him off again. He lets Steve rub his head against the handle for a few moments, then it's away from his reach once again.
. I did wish for a bit of quiet, in the past, but what I'd had in mind wasn't the kind of quiet I would enjoy
in the classroom. Usually it was several someones – a few new cadets, sometimes an older pilot helping them out with an assignment. There wasn't much time for either teaching or learning, so any help was appreciated and all kinds of group projects allowed. More often than not, Cap was there in the classroom, even when his teaching hours were over.
Steve’s words had been growing more and more passionate, and Tony couldn’t deny it felt good, hearing them, nestled like he was in Steve’s arms. It was like a wet dream.
"Slower," Tony tells him, and he doesn't even mean it as an order, exactly, but Steve's eyes snap to his own, his breath hitches, and Tony can see him get hard under his tight uniform.
Fury was frowning at Steve slightly as if he'd forgotten Steve was there. And Steve wasn't sure why he'd even said anything. Maybe he just wanted Tony to look at him for a moment. He wasn't a part of this conversation. How could he be? He was just a small town sheriff. When the civil war (the one after which Tony ended up melting down his guns) ended, Steve had still been too young. A space war he couldn't even begin to imagine. For him, a battle was what happened today; a town as a battlefield; two or three casualties. He didn't deal in wars and armies and legions of the dead.
"Thick and sturdy," Tony added, because, as they were bringing him in, he'd looked. "As in, cold war thick. Judging by the design of the building, I'd guess we're somewhere in Eastern Europe."
Curiosity won. "Did he come to you when I refused his application?" he asked. He wasn't even pissed. In the situation they were in, you couldn't really be choosy; as Fury said, you were stuck with the men you had. Still:
shower. This time he'd crash into bed right after and hopefully get a few hours of sleep before his shift started again. He and Hope hadn't repaired the damage for real. They had at best patched it up; it would hold for now, but for two people to do the job of five or six or ten, and in such a short time too – that would be impossible. Still, since the acute crisis was averted, Darryl had taken a team of competent, uninjured and fresh people and began the proper works on the damage. Some parts would need to be changed, some could be repaired, but it wasn't undoable. Everything would most probably turn out all right – right up to the next disaster.
The steps stopped abruptly. Then, from the other side: "What? What did you say?" Suddenly decisive, the steps moved closer. The voice itself was muffled by the wall, unrecognizable, but something about the inflection, the... No, impossible. He was just imagining things now. Oh, goody. This was the next stage of insanity, then. He'd been wondering when it would set in. Maybe there wasn't anyone on the other side of the wall at all. Maybe they put something in his food.
, but Steve didn't exactly stop to listen. His insides were so hot the booze felt like a trickle of cool spring water. It quenched the anger somehow, and what resulted from it was a perfect, gleaming silvery blade, cool like glass and much, much harder, where his heart used to be.
Steve thought of asking. It sounded like something someone would ask in that situation, but Steve was not that someone. With certain people, conversations like this one flowed effortlessly. With Tony... Steve was too self-conscious, and he didn't think it had anything to do with Tony being Howard's son.
It was the apologies he hated, dreaded. If only he could skip that part, possibly sit through a yelling, and then go get to scrubbing toilets or whatever. He took a deep breath. Knocked and stepped in. It was 7 a. m. sharp.
Sharon wasn't much of a chatterbox, in general. She mostly managed to convey what she meant with a glance, a smirk. She now swept the room filled with – what was it, probably hundreds – of people with her gaze and directed an amused, questioning look at Tony, as if to say:
"Yeah?" Tony's voice was still hoarse from laughing, but something in Steve's newly serious tone made him pay acute attention.
On the other side, Steve seemed to jump into his practical mode at once. "Can you stand back? I'm going to try and kick my way through."
Tony gave me a triumphant look. "See, even you aren't immune to assumptions. No, actually, she invited him on a date. Or, to be precise, she told him a time and place and to be there. When I teased her later, she said that was what you did with friends. One date, precisely. A fair chance."
exact point in time onwards," he interrupted. "Yeah, I know, I'm figuring it out as I go, I just..." He rubbed his forehead, glistening with sweat.
Despite himself, Tony felt a small smile tug at the corners of his mouth. He tried to keep it out of his voice. "I thought I'd at least retain some dignity and wait until you're asleep before I crawled under the blankets."
Tony’s quiet admission seemed to give Steve the courage to say the words that he had been holding in. "You share them, don't you? The dreams. I thought I sensed you there."
The realization hits him, right about then, and it warms him through, and he can't help but be a little smug about it. "You're worried about me, Romanoff," he says triumphantly.
"We won the war," I said. I could still hear tears in my own voice, but I don't think anyone else could. "We lost..."
"Don't know I'd dare get pissed," Bucky threw back, and that was basically all it was about. Bucky was like a one-man bomb disposal squad, always alert, always on the ready. Only the bomb he was looking for was himself. Even after they'd removed the Hydra conditioning, this had stayed.
Natasha found him like that. She was a ghost of a hand on his shoulder, a strangely sharp hiss in his ear. "Got an eyeful?" He had enough presence of mind not to jump. He just turned towards her with what he imagined to be a small self-deprecating smile and shrugged.
Tony swallows, reaches out tentatively. Touches Steve on the shoulder, pets him gently down the arm. "Hey, big guy."
Tony stuffed his hands into the pocket of his jeans in a most defiantly nonthreatening gesture he could think of. "Arrest you?" he said, noticing his teeth were beginning to chatter. Which wasn't really surprising, seeing he was standing outside in a sweater only. He hadn't noticed the cold creeping into his limbs, but now it was there and it was making itself felt. A snowflake drifted downward; another followed suit, and another. Oh, capital. His cheeks were ice. "I'm a consultant, Steve. The worst I can do to you is offer some unsolicited expert advice. Want some?" He shivered, tried to hide it. "I just wanted to be honest with you, that's all. I'm not going to rat you out."
Saying sorry is like lead around his neck, but saying goodbye seems undoable. They've had too many goodbyes, between them. They've reached the upper limit of goodbyes for life, and now they'll have to endure each other's presence for ever and ever.
He was all the way across the room, then; he didn't even know how that happened. They weren't touching, not yet, but they were standing solidly in each other's personal space, and the not-touching thing was more like having your favorite ice cream right in front of you. You could dig in right now, but you want to savor it for a moment longer, to finally taste the longing, because earlier it was too painful and you kept it at bay, but now that you're just seconds away from fulfillment, you can allow yourself to experience your feelings to the fullest.
"By the way," Tony said. "You don't have to tell me the story. I mean, I'm curious, even though by now I can guess what happened. I even had a speech ready – a very good one, about how you didn't have to be the resident hero 24/7, and how getting into the ice, with your PTSD – don't fight me on this – was immensely stupid. But, you know what, I'll give you a break."
"I know who you are," Steve interrupted before Tony could finish, then stopped in surprise. "That's what I was going to..."
He stopped listening because there was Steve, standing like a boulder near the exit, like a warning sign, like a beacon. The waves of leaving guests were washing against him and around him, but he just stood there, unseeing. And Tony didn't look directly at him, he couldn't, he couldn't, because all he wanted was to be there with him, and also to shake him and yell, "Why the hell couldn't you have just loved me?". That would go awesomely, yep. And in the end Steve looked so lonely that Tony almost went and talked to him, about nothing at all, just babbling to drown out the sadness. But he steeled his heart and looked away and hugged Rhodey and hugged Carol and laughed and joked as loud as he could.
"It's me, buddy," he said as clearly and soothingly as he could. "You fell through the ice on the lake. I found you and brought you back to the cottage. Didn't seem like such a good idea to try and get you to a hospital in this weather..."
, Tony thought, startling awake, wiping too much sweat from his face. Feverish? He should probably check it out. He stuck this onto the bottom of his mental to-do list, to forget about it forever, in all likelihood.
Steve extends a finger and traces a line in the air half an inch away from Tony's cheek. "So. Apparently, the conditions require bondage, right? I, ah..." Steve hesitates. "Would you like to tie me up­?," he asks softly, then.
He grunted in response and pushed harder, straining his back muscles. The weight of the viper was crushing him. Under the helmet, itchy streamlets of sweat were coursing down his temples. And then Darryl was pulling the man out.
"So," I said, deciding to go back to what we'd been talking about. "I actually only saw her twice – once when we went to see Tony about time-travel, and then at the... funeral." A part of me was disbelieving all this, because here I was, talking to Tony about his own funeral, more or less. "Morgan's got Pepper and Happy and Rhodey and Peter." All more adequate choices than me. "And I..." I was too broken hearted to pretend I had a life I still wanted to live in that time. I wouldn't have been much use to anyone.
"Shit, Steve, you okay?" Tony grabs him and pulls him up, props him up, gazes into his face. Steve wants to stay like that. Another eternal moment, but this one of his own choosing...
I stared straight ahead, resting my chin on my hand, not looking at him. "Why are you asking me that?" His question was perfectly normal, everything considered, but I didn't know how to answer. I wasn't sure if this was me, throwing myself at his feet and crying 'save me', or was it the other way around.
There had been a tension in the lines of his face – there almost always is, with Tony – but now a part of it started bleeding away, slowly. It was a most beautiful sight.
They hug, and they hold each other, and it takes a long, long time to let go of Natasha, because Natasha also seems reluctant to let go of him.
The woman seemed awfully cool and blasé, despite the way the media treated Tony and his friends now. Hosting these events and dealing with royalty on regular basis would do that to you, he supposed. Besides, there had to be hundreds of superheroes, state officials and military brass from all over the world here; and working with superheroes, at least, was like herding cats. The woman needed to get them
"Don't apologize," Peter said, typically misreading his intention. Then he peered into Tony's face, frowning a bit. "Wanna share that crap with a friend, man?"
In any case, we took what felt like a vacation. A time for ourselves – for the first time ever, it felt like. I think Tony was giving me room to grieve. Me, I was giving him the time to adjust. It worked for both of us, I suppose. We went for long walks, and if the mornings were nice we went jogging together. We watched a lot of movies, ordered a lot of takeout, and, more than anything else, we talked. Never before had we taken the time to really talk to each other. It seemed the topics would never run out. Our past, our childhoods; parents, teachers, first crushes. Heartbreak. Loss. Pets.
Natasha could sympathize. Steve and – somewhat surprisingly – Tony had turned out to be the glue of their family. Steve had given them a home, food to eat, a place to be themselves freely, without the restraints of society. But Tony had
Tony: Maybe in time we'll even be able to be friends again for real. The yelling isn't helping, but maybe we gotta go through that phase. In any case, yeah, man was I happy to just hear her voice.
Tony: That one was in order to piss off some jerk who stood there ranting at some poor woman, sounding exactly like the postmodern generator, saying absolutely nothing
And yes, harder and harder now. Tony is really massaging it, and Steve's insides are on fire, and all he can do is suck in one breath after another and want, want, want.
Tony: Also, I'm really sorry for being an asshole to you on Monday. AGAIN. AND for not talking to you.
Steve hated the fact that Tony drank so much, but after a day like this, who wouldn't need a drink or two? Everything in moderation, like his mom used to say. He was nursing his whiskey as leaden tiredness slowly crawled along his limbs, conquering new territory without much resistance. They'd bought a bottle and were now seated at one of the tables. He was watching Tony's face, alive, animated, aglow with curiosity as he tried to question the newcomer, Fury, who was in turn questioning him.
He hears shifting, and splashing, and the rail shakes for a second, and then Tony opens his eyes and Steve is on Tony's side of it. He's not touching Tony, but he's looking at him – Tony can't read that look, but just looking into Steve's eyes makes his heart jump into his throat. He wishes he were better at reading Steve. The water from the umbrella is dripping directly onto Steve's head, but Steve seems not to notice.
Later that day, Natasha came back from wherever she'd been and coolly informed them that, for the next day's prank, the techs planned to spill grease along Tony and the gang's usual path.
"Herbed cream cheese omelet." Tony slid a perfectly folded omelet onto Steve’s plate, and another one onto his own. He could tell Steve was surprised that Tony could make something other than grilled cheese sandwiches.
"I think I'm all right," Louis was saying. He rubbed his temple, glanced at his hand; he frowned when he saw blood, then wiped it off on his cargo pants, absent-mindedly. "Where is everyone? What happened?"
"Nothing wrong with the cabin," he said. The attempt at a cutting tone was spoiled by another sneeze. The hankie was embroidered silk, he'd found it tucked into the pocket of the bathrobe. That was what mom did. Always put clean handkerchiefs into the pockets of their clothes.
"The last time I saw the shield, Morgan was putting her Darth Vader plushy to sleep in it," he deadpanned.
And then Tony goes on playing with his body. He pulls the handle out and shows Steve how wet and glistening it is. He lifts Steve's cock with it, bending to take a good look. Prods at his balls gently. Pulls them up. And then the handle finds its way to his perineum, twisting, massaging lightly. It isn't a sharp, shooting thrill, more like a slow buildup of pleasure, caresses awakening his nerve endings, but as soon as Steve starts rocking into it, the massage stops.
"Please," he begged the mess hall attendant that worked nights. She knew him, and he knew her. This wasn't the first time he was here, and in the meantime, this has become their private little dance.
either. Steve had no idea what it was supposed to mean. Still, he was sorely tempted to just ask Stark to finish the lecture instead. Of course, it wouldn't do to put one of the cadets on the spot like that. Or to elevate him above the others.
The last time Tony saw Steve – alive, thankfully – was back when the sheriff sent him to wake up Bruce in case any of Fisk's asshole associates ended up needing medical help. After Steve was done with them. Yep. That was Steve for you. A bit later, as Tony tinkered with the intricate yet unweildy device in his workshop, he realized one thing – although, coming to think of it, he surely knew it all along: Steve wasn't going to leave Timely. No matter what Tony did, no mater what they were or weren't to each other (and despite the fact Tony sometimes thought he saw something more there – they weren't anything really; Tony wasn't even sure they were friends), no matter all that, Steve wasn't going to be convinced to leave.
still grieve. It's..." I did agree, and I was about to say something in that vein, but he looked at me sharply. "
And before Steve could digest the flood of words properly, Tony was already turning away, somewhat clumsy on his crutches, and hurrying off. Steve caught up to him in two strides, so that they walked side by side. "I can see a bit better now," he said quietly, because he needed a moment to figure out what to do, what to say, and because he thought Tony would want to hear this.
good). But now Tony felt them twitch for a moment, as if Steve was going to bunch the fabric of Tony’s shirt, clutch it in his fists. He flattened his hands then, but they didn’t feel so relaxed any longer.
Tony: The government has a full-sized hulk all their own now, if they want him. Together with a number of smaller experimental ones. Which... oh joy.
"It went that bad, huh,“ muttered Rhodey, casting a glance over Tony's shoulder, then locking back onto Tony's gaze.
"That... wasn't me, exactly," I said, and I'm afraid I sounded more distant than I meant to. I had no idea what happened here. The disbelief in Tony's voice when he said
"I..." Tony began again, his words becoming as hesitant as Steve's had been. "I've come to realize something. Between the moment you broke into that cell and now. I... I love you. Too." He sounded unusually calm. "I think I have loved you... for a long time as well. I don't think I saw it, back then. Not in that way. But, if I hadn't loved you, it wouldn't have hurt as much. All that happened, I mean. So, there you go," he finished on an almost defiant note. "I love you too. What do we do with this mess now?"
Then he found himself pressed to the big chest, wrapped in gentle and a little desperate arms, and he let himself bury his head into Steve's shoulder for a moment and just held onto him, just breathed in the warmth. And this moment of contact seemed to break the final seal, and his own mind was suddenly tightly enveloped in the spacious, abundant affection that was all Steve; slowly bubbling joy finally dared rise it's head and peer out from the snow, blinked twice and said:
, for a moment he would glimpse emotions that weren't his, a sadness of the wrong brand, the memories of himself seen through a different pair of eyes.
It’s just, the piste is way worse than I remembered it. Dammit, I just wanted to take you somewhere where you’d actually have fun, that’s all. No sinister motives, Cap.”
, something in Tony thinks for a sec. But then the window shatters, and it's obviously a sniper, and as sweet as all this is supposed to be, Tony doesn't want Steve taking a bullet for him, and
Steve shook his head. It took Tony a moment to remember what he was replying to. No more hot chocolate, then. “We should probably go,” the man said, and Tony could do nothing as he watched him draw back into his shell again, like he’d been doing the whole time. Try, reach out, get disappointed, retreat. As if they were looking for each other in a fog, extending their hands and missing by a few inches, ever missing. Tony seemed to say the wrong thing, always; he skated around the
"I think I glimpsed some kind of explosive security contraption connected to the door while they were dragging me in."
Steve shrugged. "Nothing. I was passing by the lake. I saw..." He trailed off. Despite the gale, he'd heard it first: the cracking of the ice, the yelp, the splash. It had cut right through him like a shard of ice that slid into his heart and started turning him into a glacier. For a moment he hadn't been sure if it had been himself that had fallen in, gone under. There was darkness only. But then he forced himself to come back from that, and at first the whiteness blinded him (as if he'd been expecting some other kind of landscape), but then he saw it – the canine head above the water, the frantic paddling in a circle, bound to fail even before it started properly. And he didn't stop to think. He just acted.
Tony: Do you absolutely need me here for your inventory needs or can you perhaps make the list on your own? Because, contrary to the popular belief, I'm a pretty busy person.
The frog in my throat was an unexpected addition, a neutral observer. "I do," I managed, even though I suspect I sounded a little squeaky there for a moment. The ring slipped onto my finger as if it had always been there.
"Do you guys want to play cards in the kitchen?" someone called out. Tony squeezed Steve's hand and, drunken with possibilities, Steve squeezed back.
"Is it too much if I ask for your number?" Tony said against his own better judgment, pasting a showy grin on his face as a form of preemptive self defense. At the same time, his own inner voice was yelling:
He squished the thought inside him. Mercilessly wrung its throat; he was going crazy, apparently starved for human company and human touch, because otherwise he wouldn't be reacting like this. This was
Tony shrugged. "All the little clues. Even if I didn't suspect anything, that indentation in the car door would have been a dead giveaway. Besides, I knew that they found you and that you went missing. I wasn't
gotta check the gravs and the side engines, see where's the problem." This, with more than a hint of strained patience. "There might be a chain reaction. We don't know if the other engineers are in a position to fix it or not. There's no time to...!" Tony was arguing in his best, reasonable voice, because he had a distinct feeling he was about to be sent back to his room without dinner. With both Steve and Thor staring down at him, he was suddenly feeling outnumbered. He felt a bout of inappropriate laughter, a sibling to panic, rise in his chest, but somehow he swallowed it down.
Silence reigned supreme between them; Tony didn't know how to read it. He didn't know anything any more.
Mutely, I shook my head. The jealousy I felt was momentous and sharp, and directed solely at my alter ego. He got to have what I'd wanted so badly and what I could never have had. But that feeling was quickly trumped by a deep sense of inadequacy. Inadequacy to  replace this timeline's version of myself. Tony kept insisting we were the same person, his Steve and I, more or less, but now it was clear we weren't. This place's Steve must have had something I don't. "We were...
Steve tumbled from the board into the water, and Tony splashed some into his face by way of punishment, and in seconds it turned into a full-fledged splashing war. The surfboard drifted beside them, forgotten. They were just far enough from the shore that Steve couldn’t touch the bottom with his feet. And Steve didn’t put two and two together, not in time, or he’d forgotten for a second, but a second was enough; and, laughing ever so hard, he’d dunked Tony’s head under the surface.
We did get married properly about two months later. Still, this was the anniversary we celebrated afterwards.
"Open them!", Tony snaps, sharply, and Steve complies with a gasp. He can feel Tony's palm on top of his stomach, pushing him down, holding him immobile. He can feel the tip of his cock, only millimeters away from Tony's gauntlet. Steve imagines how cold it would be if he could touch it with his cock, imagines how the metal would be too slick for much friction, and the thought itself is already excruciating. He doesn't try, he just lets himself crave for it a little longer
. "Whatever you think you know, forget it. Whatever you were in your previous lives – is irrelevant. You think you know something about flying? I need you to bury that notion. You were picked because I think you're able to learn. That's all. You are new cadets. You've no idea how to fly a viper. You've no idea how to fly
news." The genuine elation in his voice reached inside Steve's chest and squeezed. Tony was happy for him, just like he'd been happy when Steve first saw light, just like he'd been so angry on Steve's behalf, back in the cell. This could be enough, he told himself, we could have this, there's nothing wrong with this.
"Thor can be pretty... congenial, yes," he said, and no use, he still sounded like a schoolteacher. He closed his eyes for a second and sighed.
for an agency of that ilk, I know way more about the workings of this than anyone out there should be comfortable with. Whoever bothered to sift through the data Nat and Steve released a few years back, could have seen plenty of this there. Plenty of proof. We can all politely pretend it's not so, you go ahead, but that's just not true.
It's a voice I haven't heard in a very, very long time. Suddenly, I realize I hadn't considered all the implications of alternative timelines, no matter that I've lived in one and then another and should be experienced at this.
"I've given like a million popular lectures on the stuff, 'course I know how to dumb it down," Stark said flippantly and immediately spoiled the good impression that was beginning to elbow its way into Steve's mind.
"Smoke," he said at the same time Steve said: "Something's burning." And then, sharply: "Stark, I'll go first, you keep behind me at all times."
He knows he should tell Tony what he feels. It will probably deepen the rift between them, but Steve is done with secrets. And maybe, just maybe, it would mean something to Tony. Steve is not blind. He can see how carefully Tony is protecting Steve's flank, he can hear the worry in Tony's voice as he asks:
, with no way to tell them apart. Fresh air stifled him. Hilly horizon made him claustrophobic. He'd left his soul somewhere among the Art Deco skyscrapers and that was that. In the country, Steve felt like an alien, but there wasn't a place Steve
"Cadet," Cap began, rather softly, but his voice seemed to possess a certain sharp quality that cut through the surrounding noise. "You're not military, yet, and you're new. So, I'm going to be mild. This is your first demerit. You will report to my office first thing tomorrow, for your disciplinary measures."
, skin on skin. But somehow, the flirtatious note from minutes ago had disappeared. It was pure comfort, offered and accepted.
Tony: Steve, what the hell am I going to do with a red hulk and an army of traumatized or criminal-minded hulklings if it turns out I'm the one to have to deal with them?
, and sing along, and it seemed his foot never stopped tapping to the rhythm. His musical tastes swerved wildly between cool and utterly ridiculous; Tony kind of enjoyed that too. And the man
He was looking at me with a hint of glee in his eyes, waiting to see what I would say next. And I was sure about one thing: Anywhere, in any universe, Tony loved his friends. He wouldn't be looking forward to telling me the story unless it ended well.
Reed couldn't resist a good puzzle, though. Tony watched him as he thumbed through the pages, his face changing from a frown into an expression of, at first, interest, and then quiet fascination. "This", he said, tapping his forefinger on the tablet hard and repeatedly (which made Tony wince internally), "this is very interesting."
Judging by Steve's expression, he didn't find it funny in the least. By the way his eyes darted to Tony's face, and then behind him, at the people standing around, he was very much aware they weren't alone. And probably felt very humiliated. And:
"It wasn't like that," Steve said, shaking his head with some vehemence. This just rooted Tony firmer in the belief that it had been
Tony: Because I just dreamed that you're dead, you died, and I can't take this, Steve, I can't, so just tell me you're there, you're okay. Jesus. Send a dick pic or something, whatever.
"Never better, thanks for asking," Tony said, shivering, his head pounding worse than ever. Wasn't cold air supposed to make hangovers better? By freezing your whole face off, he suspected. "What are you doing out there?" In this weather, he didn't add.
), he convinced himself most of it had been in his head. The almost shy words, the sudden smile. Tony had seen what he'd wanted to. Steve was obviously making an effort to push past the awkwardness and be nice, that was all. He was the commanding officer here, it was his place to set this right. Pretend as if nothing had happened. Tony decided that the decent thing to do would be to ease up on him. Ease up with expressionless looks and curt answers. In the end, they were forced to be here, indefinitely, together. They should aim for civility.
Tony echoed in his head. Steve was obviously getting loopy again. While he didn't think a cold shock could permanently damage one's brain on a purely physical level, he didn't like what the repeated trauma – probably the biggest trauma of his fairly traumatic life – was doing to Steve. One moment he was talking to Tony, completely focused, the next he was spouting random words; could he be hallucinating? Was all of this too serious for Tony to handle, after all? He wished Bruce was here.
Tony also splashed his face with warmed up water, and all in all, he felt super-productive; he hadn’t sneezed once since he’d got up.
Chief petty officer Darryl Jacobson in here is Darryl from the short Thor clips, btw. This kind of has Thor/Darryl for funnies, but it's such a minor thing I'm not even sure I should tag it.
Tony: So you thought you'd try, and when I didn't answer, you could say you tried and that'd be that. Right?
Tony: He's all right. I'm not risking telling you anything else, because safety, not that I know much, but he's fine as long as he stays away.
Tony: I'm not sure. What I know – I intercepted some of their communications, see, so I reconstructed this part, but I suspect they mostly discussed it in person. In any case, I know they thought Pep and I weren't talking. I mean, until very recently we weren't either. But their info was that we weren't in contact, and that she wasn't a part of the SI any longer (which is, obviously, a known fact). So I suspect they either wanted to really pump her for any info about you and the guys in case she happened to know anything from before, like safe houses and such, or anything at all compromising about me besides from what's common knowledge.
"Steve," he managed, and it was the only thing he could think of, since 'hey' was already used up. It seemed enough. Steve's face broke into a smile that could light up worlds, as if Tony had said something both clever and funny and tender. Tony suddenly realized something: it doesn't matter, it isn't really important what we say; with the two of us, it's either perfect understanding or total misunderstanding.
Belligerent and dismissive. Not the best tone to take with your superior, he thought belatedly, but he was in a hurry. Tony had been at the head of his own big company for too long. If something needed doing urgently, he either delegated or went and did it. His crisis mode wasn't overly pleasant, true, but he wasn't used to being relegated to a courier boy when he could actually be of use. He closed his eyes for a moment, made an abortive pacifying gesture and prepared to try to reason with Cap. Because he
. It seemed to Tony that Steve (the Dream Steve? the Real Steve?) must have drawn it a thousand times. Lines: straight. Angles: sharp. Shading: unmistakably Steve's.
Had he been cured from the thing, he wouldn't have ended up nearly so hurt and enraged. How dare Steve do that? How dare he... crush Tony's idealized image of him and prove to be
First, Tony raises hell about the boarding passes and the fact that he and Steve are not seated together, due to some late rearrangement.
Tony didn't know if Steve had pulled him towards him or if he himself had leaned forward, but the next thing he knew, Steve's lips were on his, hot and sweet, and it was as if something warm and fresh coursed through his whole body, thawing, cleansing. He was still holding both of Steve's hands in his. Now Steve shifted the grip, interlaced their fingers. He pulled Tony closer, and Tony let himself be enticed for a moment longer, and another moment after that, letting his body mold itself against Steve's. And then, with a final, regretful pressing of lips against lips, he pulled back. It required a greatest effort of will. "Not a good idea," he whispered, but still he couldn't make himself let go of Steve's hands. Gently, Steve pulled Tony toward him again, more signaling than actually trying to move him. Tony's heart didn't need much convincing. He melted against Steve again, aware, savoring every second. "Okay," he whispered, "just one more time." And then they kissed again, longer this time, bolder.
He's only half aware that he's pleading. "...please, Tony, my cock, I'm almost...there, hit me there, give me, I need to feel something, please, please..."
And this is how it ends, Tony thinks. In a few hours, Steve leaves for the West Coast. As the leaders of two Avenger groups, they will have to work together; who knows, maybe their little night together and this subsequent talk will help keep their professional relationship on a decent level. Maybe they needed to vent all that UST. Maybe they needed to air out some of their issues too. But now Steve will leave, and Tony will stay, and the world will be grayer for it, just like the skies, and Tony's life will lose yet another bit of warmth and color and...
"Maybe we could have all that again," he said gently. "All the Avengers, back together. I mean, who knows, now. We could try."
weren't enough. If he could find a tiny black hole to crawl into right now, Tony would. Just stop feeling things.
This was all shades and colors of not-good-at-all. Especially the thuds. The flooring between the decks was so thick and well insulated that normally you couldn't hear anything from the deck above/below you. The thuds meant something bad. Something bad and big and hard, like a piece of engine, like a huge crate, like a small flyer craft. Falling. Bouncing around.
"Stark, what are you doing?" Carol's voice, but Tony couldn't afford to turn his head, because he could feel the moment come together, he could feel the finger of fate extend itself and
At 2 the cable died, the way it usually did when the weather got on the shitty side; the internet went soon after, and with it his cell signal, of course.
Steve shrugged. "What I said," he finished lamely. He also noticed Tony wasn't saying anything to that, wasn't agreeing. But maybe this was perfect for him – one night together, and then he could get away, free. No strings attached, tying him to the ground. Steve didn't have it in him to resent Tony for it. He simply felt more lonely than ever, but perhaps that was just as well. He'd better get used to it.
And then: “Steve, I really love you.” It escaped from his lips like a convict; and it wasn’t the first time he’d said it, but it was the first time he’d said it
," he keeps whispering, wanting, needing to feel the whisk and sting of the tails against his sensitive flash, right there.
But if I ever let it actually come to that, I thought, I was going to come undone. Sometimes it seemed I only held myself together by avoiding comfort, avoiding other people's compassion. I could only take it in small installments. It would start melting the grit that held me together, and if that happened I was going to fall apart. I couldn't do that to Tony.
And it wasn't a full-scale answer, but it was infinitely more than Steve could have hoped for. It wasn't just an olive branch. It was a goddamn tree trunk. "Dinner sounds lovely," he said, suddenly able to smile a full smile again. "How can I help?"
Tony froze for a heartbeat, then frowned; then he went on energetically opening the cans and cracker boxes.
"I'm gonna be all right," Steve said quickly. And even thought his eyelids were droopy and he seemed to barely be following Tony's words, he was himself enough to claim Tony needn't worry about him.
you got it under control,” he said, and shook his head, and there was laughter and quiver in his voice. Tony almost thought he heard an underlayer of tears too, but he must have imagined it. “Tony, I was
Rhodey's eyes seemed to have wondered off, back to Carol. He made a visible effort to re-focus, but evidently missed the point completely. "Good for you," he told Tony with an encouraging nod.
Tony: I would have appreciated the info about the gov involvement, though. It would have fitted nicely with my collection of dirt I've been collecting on Ross Mór and the minions, which now I feel bad about not telling you about, but there you go, I guess we're even.
. Steve had longed for his voice, but now it sounded somehow distant, as if he was drawing away from the whole situation.
"Wanna do it now?" I asked lightly. He stared. The excitement that was burning low in my stomach warped my perception.
He spotted Sharon in the crowd, and all of a sudden talking to her sounded like the best of all possible ideas that floated around the universe, yet unclaimed.
he thought at Rhodey helplessly. You never could manage a conversation longer than three sentences tops.
And Steve replied: "At least we're in it together. Well, kind of," he amended. And, at that moment, it really felt like they had known each other for way longer than they had. Tony's hand was resting on the table. Atop it, Steve's hand lay, not moving, not demanding anything, just there. It really didn't feel like flirting any more. It felt closer than that, more real.
Peter's eyebrows slowly rose, higher and higher, as if something suddenly dawned on him. "Cap? Really?"
Tony: The fact that you fucked up doesn't mean you OWE it to me to be a pushover whenever I feel like pushing, for fuck's sake.
"That was even better now, wasn't it?" Tony asks, voice mechanical but soft. And Steve knows it even before Tony says it: "You can have the whole package again," Tony pronounces, and lifts his right gauntlet, slick with lube and glistening. He's showing Steve his first three fingers, holding his little one down with his thumb.
Steve matched him glare for glare as he went by, but apparently decided he'd deal with Tony's insubordination later. "Let's go," he cut off sharply and took off, taking the lead in two easy strides. Tony hurried after him, half seething and half wondering how in the name of hell this escalated so quickly. It was all particularly depressing because he
But then, two or three running steps, and a great, resounding crash. Perceptible vibrations in the wall itself. What sounded like a pained grunt. That wasn't right, but it felt hella
Yet, other times, when he tried to sum up their relationship, he got a different result. He, himself, was guilty of always standing too close to Tony, leaning on the bar right next to him as he delivered a lecture on the evils of drink (he meant it, too), invading his personal space; and Tony never moved away, never withdrew. He invaded Steve's space right back. Elbows on the bar, unabashedly touching, feet under the table; sometimes, Steve suspected, Tony pretended he was far drunker than he was, so that Steve would have to help him home; sometimes Tony made a ruckus on purpose (Steve suspected) in front of the Sheriff's office so that Steve would have to come out and take him into custody for the night. Steve was happy to – and then they would talk and talk, and suddenly Tony would seem far less rowdy than five minutes before. And there was that one time, when Tony genuinely was black-out drunk, and Steve had to put him to bed, and Tony held Steve's hand so hard and just wouldn't let go, and so Steve sat with him until Tony fell asleep, still holding his hand. The next day, neither mentioned it. Neither of them
Forgetting their squabbling, both Tony and Steve hurried to lift the rubble off. The job was painstakingly slow. Tony's heart was vaguely audible in his ears, like a background beat from far away.
Now, this was a big old ruse and it could have easily failed to have the desired effect; anywhere else, it would have. Tony didn't worry, though. None of these people have ever seen a spaceship, not even Fisk. How would they know if it had guns or not. Because firefly class ships were simple freighters, as dangerous as an old, docile ploughing mare.
Tony downed his, not that he needed the reassurance, and immediately got a refill. A few minutes passed in noncommittal chatting and the usual semi-rude remarks.
He's cutting perfectly even pieces of cheese on the cutting board when abruptly he says: "I never forgave him, you know."
I did try to stick around for a time. I even came to see Morgan whenever I could. It was otherworldly, walking through the house in which I'd lived for 15 years with Tony, and still it belonged to someone else here, it was suffused with somebody else's presence. Pepper tolerated me for a time, but one day she cornered me.
(All of this had actually happened – given, it was in the simulator, so no real damage done, but Steve quietly dreaded the day he'd have to let the new cadets into real flyers.) Still, it never happened with Tony – Tony steered like a dream, he made the craft move as if it was a literal bird, and he its brain. Under his fingers, the controls weren't controls, but neural impulses. And Steve very badly needed to stop waxing poetic about the man, or this ridiculous crush would soon turn into something even worse. Steve had to stomp it out with all the resolution he could muster.
While Hill questioned him sharply, tersely over the phone – and as he answered even more curtly,  he found his eyes drawn towards Tony again. He was now finished with his physical checkup. Steve fought to keep the smile out of his voice as he watched the techs surrounding him and Hope, clapping them on the back, seemingly asking them a million questions. Steve couldn't hear them over the din, but he could see Tony's grin, could see him drink it all in – the attention, the praise. Like a proud cat basking in sunlight. Steve knew this wasn't the end of it, he knew Hill would summon him to her office for a detailed report when things settled down. And then there will probably be a less formal talk with Commander Fury, too, and the old man would offer him a drink and tell him how they needed him, how he shouldn't run into danger head-first like that because he was indispensable to
Tony tried a few stretches himself, the ones that didn't strain on his foot. The silence swelled like dough; if it grew any bigger, it would probably set some kind of a world record.
As it turned out, Fury also wasn't opposed to taking onboard a good hand with blades. Tony insisted Fury was picky, but it seemed to Steve he would take anyone who wanted to leave. He even invited Bruce along, saying he could use a new doctor. He either lost people at an incredible rate and needed to compensate (which Tony insisted was
“Is it like... an instantaneous onset of panic?” Steve’s own reactions were slow brewing, more of a woodworm, staying on the inside, where no one could see it, where no one would
"Tony, could I talk to you?" Steve seemed subdued, very collected, his voice soft. Tony could almost believe the humiliation from ten minutes ago never even happened. But it did, it
Tony. Tony was so competent – he'd basically saved the day. And he was coming over, right towards Steve, checking up on him, fussing over him. Wrapping him in blankets. Dressing his injuries. Good gods.
He put both of his hands on Steve's shoulders and gently tried to push him back down to the couch. Failed, of course "You shouldn't be moving around yet," he said. And, "Hi. It's me, Tony. You fell through the ice while you were crossing my lake – which, by the way, I want to know why, but that's for later. You're safe now. You..."
"And he loved them," he interrupted. "I'm sure of it. And he also loved you. You can't tell me otherwise. He was Tony. Whatever else is or isn't true about a universe, it's true that Tony loves his Steve, in whatever manner."
"The grav strips gave out, we think," Hope said briskly. "The flyers crashed down, we all crashed down. The fires started. I'm with the fire control team – we can handle it, probably, and in any case there are no more fire extinguishers that are not in use. Darryl's over there, supervising the urgent rescue operations. The maintenance people that were working on the vipers are trapped under the flyers, we think. They need to be got out of here before they suffocate. That team over there could use some help. Are you alone? Does this mean the corridor is cleared? The access was really tricky from this side, we didn't have time to get on that, we..." She took a deep breath, seemed to check herself. "We need to get someone to the side engines. We couldn't get to them from this side, and we had to suppress the fires to some extent before we could get more people on that task."
Steve pushed his goggles up onto his forehead and gave him a sheepish look, for some reason. “Italy.”
He felt stirring against him, and then a gentle hand touched him on the elbow and patted him awkwardly a few times. It was like an anchor, a line pulling him slowly back out of the waves of hysteria. He could feel his stomach calm down bit by bit, and it was like something had finally stopped tickling the insides of his brain – all of this gently guided by the rhythmic patting of that warm hand on his elbow. "Aw, god," Tony said finally, when he thought he might sound like himself again. "That was embarrassing. I think I haven't laughed since..." He stopped.
"Oh, I don't know, Drew," Tony replied. "I don't think that, even in the broadest possible sense of the word, what we are wearing can be called
Steve leaned over and planted a slow, soft, immensely tender kiss upon Tony’s forehead. It lasted a lifetime. “Me too,” he said, as if the kiss hadn’t spoken clearly enough (you don’t kiss people on the forehead that way unless you love them, Tony mused). “And oh, I missed you so much, I missed you so
"I second that," Clint piped in as he jumped lightly into the saddle. Now all they had to do was fight their way back through the enemy lines and rejoin their small army. "You would not believe the amount of moping we all had to deal wi-hey!"
He stood like that for a time. There were some people addressing him, but he responded automatically. In all probability everyone could see he wasn't exactly there, but he didn't care about
That night, Steve really wanted to stop feeling things. Tony Stark was brilliant and that made Steve want to go hurl himself into a white giant. For the first time in his military career, he actually had to review the fraternization rules.
"I... miss not being on my own," Tony said after a minute's thought,  "which is, as you can imagine, not the great romantic statement one's partner longs to hear." He sighed, seemed to shake something off. "I don't really want to talk about my divorce." Okay, well, that was that, then. "Take some soup, Steve. Hell, take
Steve chuckled. "Yeah, I'm not a fan of the whole thing either, but it seems mostly harmless so far." Then: "I heard the old pilots are joining in too, though?"
When Steve first moved into the Tower, he was surprised to find out Tony tended to fuss over people. To bring them smoothies. Check if they had everything they needed. Cover them if they fell asleep on the couch. Steve was even more surprised – and embarrassed – to admit that he actually liked it, deep down. At first he thought he just missed someone taking care of him. Later, with something akin to alarm, he realized he actually, apparently wanted to be fussed over by
And now this bullshit. He didn’t mean it, not like that, not like what Steve heard. And anything Tony could say now would make things worse, it would ring untrue, like an excuse, like a poor way out, like a
Other cupboards are no better. His face blooming red, Steve is staring at a collection of floggers and crops with what looks like utter fascination. He's clutching at the chest strap of his uniform with one hand. If Tony didn't know better, he'd almost think the blond man was turned on.
"But I told you," Steve was saying to the medic. There was a hoarseness to his voice that worried Tony. "Your colleague said I was fine. Looked me over. Did the oxymetry already, too. I'm
busy packing, bustling about, muttering about how the electricity needed sorting out and this was no way to have a vacation. Somehow, he didn’t sound too serious.
Thanos stabs Tony with a piece of Tony's own armor while Steve is right there, fighting next to him, with Thor on his other side. For a moment the time stops, freezes. That moment is eternally long in Steve's mind, stretched to infinity; it's like he's forever falling into a black hole. In his mind, burned forever, that instant that Tony gets what
"Yeah, of course," he says, rolling his eyes. Here comes the obligatory shovel talk in some form. "Shoot. If I hurt Steve, you will – what?"
Tony was silent for a long time – so long, in fact, that I thought he wasn't going to answer me at all. That was fine. I knew I was prying.
"Yeah," Steve agreed. "Pretty much." Darryl nodded. Steve nodded back. The silence stretched. Every pause was just a tad longer than necessary. Uncomfortable, Steve wondered if he should just get up and leave. Still, the conversation seemed to be going on despite both their wills, so he decided it would be rude to smile and nod and get lost. "So he didn't cause you any trouble?" he asked because he now felt somehow obliged to keep going.
I turned away, again, to beat it, to disappear, to pretend I'd never been there in tine first place.
Tony ran out of the damned coat room, tucking his shirt in, desperately straightening his suit as he walked. Relief was mixing with disappointment that Steve hadn't ran after him. He allowed himself a long litany of
The red bed cover, the toy train, a pair of pint-sized skis (his heart practically stopped at the sight of the skis). It felt too intimate, even being in here. It felt like a violation. Stepping into a life that wasn't his, seeing something he wasn't supposed to be privy to. And yet, Tony had told him to come here, and given him this room to stay in, and Steve remembered the softness in his eyes when he looked around the sitting room and touched upon the topic of his parents during that one short moment when it had seemed something between him and Steve was thawing.
, Tony kept telling himself afterwards. Obviously, this was an absurd notion, since, during those days, they practically didn't have enough time to breathe and eat and sleep.
As soon as the frantic repairs could wait a moment, he tried tuning in to other channels. But, instead of Darryl or someone else, he, against all expectation, found Thor. Thor was on the other side of the deck, apparently, and by normal parameters too far for the crappy comms to reach, but somehow it worked.
He was being an idiot. And Natasha is Steve's. She's his special friend, his adopted sibling, his anima. Tony is happy they have each other, he is. It would be petty to be jealous of that; but then again, he's not exactly a stranger to pettiness. Maybe he can make a piece with all this  in time, or maybe he can shorten the process by cutting his own head off. That should solve the problem.
Tony: Anyway, have you considered how your hiding your state from everyone around you constitutes as lies? It's gonna come back and bite you in the ass at some point. It always escalates. How can you not know these things?
Tony deflated a little bit, as if this had, in fact, been criticism. "Okay," he said, turning his back to Steve, needing a moment, leaning both his hands against the counter. "But I can't stand the idea of..." He trailed of, but Steve recognized that tone of voice and heard the silent 'losing you' nevertheless; there was that idea again.
Last time he'd been alone with Tony, there was a roof in Berlin, and jam donuts, and Thor's mead too. Steve'd needed alcohol that
He shot a look at Tony, as if expecting a laugh. Tony's eyebrow shot up. "Feel free to refresh my memory, Pete.“
"I panicked," Tony cuts him off. "It was too... It hurts too much, and that was... last night was supposed to be good-bye, and it got out of hand, so I panicked and I lied. By omission or something, I mean, but still. Panicked; lied."
It sends a sudden thrill through Tony, and there would be nothing wrong with it, only, a) he's not going there with Steve, honestly, it would be a stupid thing to do on top of everything, and b) it's not
He may have set The Game in motion, yes, but without two players it wouldn't have been a game. Rogers had been responsive. Rogers had not only
He looked away. "Thank you for telling me," he said, aware he probably sounded a tad broken. Hated himself for it, because, despite all the newfound honesty, something in him protested – he couldn't let Steve know how
“Because I didn’t know what comes next,” he hurried to get it out while the magic still worked, before he changed his mind. “It wasn’t about forgiveness any more, once we... well, once we sorta-talked about it. I simply didn’t know where to go from there. How do I proceed? How do we do this?” Tony heard his own words become more heated as they approached the core of the problem.
Thank god Steve hadn't followed him. Tony couldn't deal with him and his pity. He practically ran into the ballroom, zeroed in on Rhodey and Carol and streaked through the few couples that still braved the dance floor – dancing in the face of the night's ending, in the face of the cleaning personnel that was already navigating the margins of the room.
Tony, still in his suit, grabbed him before he fell to the floor. "Friday," he snapped, snatching up Steve's bare hand – he'd lost his glove in the water. "Life functions!"
But Bruce said new timelines came into being all the time. What did it matter? Every major decision, every significant point in time, created a divergence. In one timeline a war started, perhaps; in a parallel one, it didn't. Things like that. Even personal decisions can have a diverging effect. Not what you had for breakfast, I suppose, but something that created ripples in your personal universe.
And Tony knew the game, knew the voice, and as a couple walking by stopped to listen in, his automatic response was: "No luck there, Dingo. Besides, wombats are cute, have you even seen a wombat?"
something that you maybe, just maybe could have. "I'm thinking we should discuss it in person? Come on, what do you say? If I send a super-secret jet for you, would you be willing to come crash at Casa de Stark? I'd come pick you up myself, but Friday disapproves of me flying
The crash that shook the faux cockpit was well simulated. They were hit by enemy fire. Right in the tail. It seemed to Tony he never welcomed anything so much in his life.
. Move along, citizen, nothing to see here. And on the surface, that was that; just two guys that weren't particularly close, and even found each other irritating most of the time. It looked like that to Steve sometimes, too.
"What, like go to Vegas?" he said skeptically. "Also," he added with a tiny drop of acid in his voice, "I thought you didn't believe in institutions."
She was wielding a fire extinguisher, spraying the chemical in the direction of the flight controller's cabin. It didn't seem that much at risk, but it made sense, of course. The equipment in there would be irreplaceable, and without it, the viper crafts would hardly be functional at all.
,” Steve said stubbornly and shuddered again, so fiercely that the whole sofa shook with him. “It’s just a tiny postponed reaction. No reason to worry. Really.”
"No one looks twice at couples." Steve tries to look unapologetic, but kind of fails. "I learned that trick from Nat," he adds, a slight flush blooming in his cheeks.
to know what exactly was wrong with Steve. Because he was used to Steve getting up and shaking it off and never, ever admitting he even felt tired. If he ended up in hospital, soon enough he'd tear the IV out of his hand and walk out, no matter what anyone had to say about it. He was a bull-headed idiot. Frustrating as it was, Tony'd always somehow liked that about him. He sighed. "I want to fix everything. That's all."
Steve studied his face furtively as Tony talked about how Steve could take the small bedroom to the left. He looked tired, and it wasn't just the sickness. That tiredness seemed to be chronically etched into Tony's features; the fact hurt Steve almost physically. He felt it resonate in his own muscles. God, Steve had
This was when Steve kissed him. He didn’t mean to. Well, he did, but maybe not just then. Maybe he just wanted to lean his forehead against Tony’s and stay like that. But then his lips were on Tony’s, all salty and soft; Steve would have been content just to leave them there, just to go on feeling Tony’s lips with his own for all eternity. And there was a trickle of doubt, of fear: what if he’d been wrong all along, what if Tony didn’t want this, what if... But Tony opened his mouth, and their tongues met, and Steve could feel hot happiness and doubt course through him like a cocktail. His eyes were closed, but suddenly he felt an arm around his neck, pulling him closer, firmly, demandingly. Then another one, sneaking around his waist; and then he was on top of Tony, feeling his almost naked body under his own, pressing against it, insistent, wanting to touch everything, feel every inch of skin.
Still, Tony was always there, somehow , whenever Steve looked up. Steve had a hard time not staring at him. What he'd found interesting at first was his, well, arrogance. The way he moved as if he owned the battleship and everyone around was an employee. And Steve
"I... a bit," Steve said. "But, ah, I didn't exactly stop fighting, you know. Never mind that I... Just street level stuff. A bit. I've been calling myself Nomad. You'll probably say it's melodramatic as hell." He sighed. "I couldn't..."
In the end he evidently thought it a good idea to go with, "You did very well today, Stark." Maybe because it sounded stiff, a bit too rehearsed, or maybe because he was apparently back to being 'Stark', Tony felt his lips tighten. He didn't need praise from Steve. No, bullshit. He
"Uh-huh," she said. "Although I could probably talk to you about both Jessicas or Daisy or Cage if you wanted."
Tony seemed tired already, though, and Steve wasn't sure it was such a great idea for him to drive. Not in the dark and the cold, at this time of night.
"Okay, let's try to find out when the divergence was," I said slowly. "You went to space after Thanos. We lost. You came back, with Carol and Nebula. Right?"
So, Rogers was probably trying to be fair now too, but – Tony guessed – Fury's intervention on his behalf wasn't exactly helping. At best, Captain may be trying not to form opinions preemptively, and failing.
Tony held Steve’s gaze. The man’s lips stayed parted for a moment, and then eventually formed a tiny word. “Oh.” said Steve. And then he said, “Well...” and then he said, “I certainly...”
Not that he should be dishing out advice, but... "I pretty much just blurted it out. It blurted itself out. I don't know."
Tony: I'm still reeling with a ton of different shit coursing through my brain, and half of it I didn't even know was there.
"Steve, oh my god," Tony breaths. And then, in a firmer voice. "All right. But look down. I want you to watch."
So, he was going to give Tony an opportunity to open up if he wanted to, and if not, Steve wasn't going to pressure him.
Tony: I know, but we'll raise hell over it, don't you worry! I can't send her the lawyers, I have to stay out of this for the time being, at least nominally. BUT it's all right, she knew what she was getting into.
"I think I've just witnessed a new phenomenon", Reed had said. "When you plug yourself into the gate, you will most probably see
"Now it's not fun any more," Tony grumbled. "Oh, all right, just go ahead then. Not as if you can do anything about it. No, wait, I want to sit down first."
"And you could have loved it in different circumstances, too" Tony went on, full of defiance and unsure at what the defiance was directed. At the years of sweeping all this under the rug, he supposed. "You could feel the potential, you could imagine how great the holidays could be, if only
"Where's Darryl? Have you found him? Where's Cap? Stark, you okay?" Thor had asked urgently before they lost the signal. Well, at least he had his priorities straight, eh? A moment later, Tony had the channel working again.
The aftermath was a bit of a haze, but the sight of Tony arriving in his oil-smeared suit definitely brightened Steve's day. Tony's hair was in total disarray when he pulled his helmet off. He drew Steve's gaze like a magnet and Steve couldn't stop himself from smiling.
He let me slip the ring onto his finger, but he barely waited for me to be done. He grabbed the other one and let his eyebrows dance at me for a moment. "Steve, " he said. "Do you take me as your husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, blah blah, I don't really remember this part, in sickness and in health, until death do us part?"
Tony glanced towards Steve, still behind his barrel, and Steve was still holding his gun at the ready, intent on something, aiming. Alive, so perfectly alive. Everything else lost importance in comparison to that. Tony laughed out, waved his hand recklessly. "Relax," he  almost sang. "These are
. I'm leaving the planet first thing tomorrow, who can I tell?" He grinned. "Except half the galaxy, of course."
That was where the rest of Tony's ammo went, all based on the assumption that the goons would rather shoot at the lock than try to kick down the door at the other end of the corridor.
Coming here, staying, getting to know Tony again. Living an uncomplicated life, if there is such a thing. And then I immediately felt guilty, because next to me I could feel him sinking.
During winter holidays, snow is generally a desirable, festive thing; white Christmas and all that. Tony wasn't a big fan, hadn't been ever since his joints started creaking, but Morgan was going to love it. Tony took out the sled and dusted it. Since it was still early in the morning, he went into his shed to work on a project, to kill time; when he emerged – or tried to emerge – a few hours later, he had to kick the door three times before it opened. Everything was blindingly
He stepped back, and Steve picked up his skis and stepped in. Shook the snow from his hair like a big dog, took off his goggles, hanged them on the coat rack. Closed the door behind him.
The breath Steve took was audible. "There are... fraternization rules," he said. It was almost a whisper. "You're my cadet. I'm your captain. It's not done."
. I continue. I exist. It's been months, and perhaps the pain has dulled a bit, but it's still there, an edge keen enough to stab me from the inside whenever I sit still for too long.
Tony: Me, when I sense it coming, there's a part of me that's... okay, broken in a landslide, to borrow your metaphor. And then there's another part of me that just rolls its eyes and goes like 'oh, this again'. And I just kind of stand aside and know what's happening and watch. And it hurts, but at least I'm used to it. I've been there before.
