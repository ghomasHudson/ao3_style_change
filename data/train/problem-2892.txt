“Sinclair usually invites one kind of supernatural creature per day to see is collection. He always makes a visit tour himself so that he can cast a spell that makes the cell soundproof while he gloats about his prize. Nobody can hear you if you speak or insult the visitor. The spell lasts only a few hours, it starts when he arrives in the area and stops when all the visitors are gone.”
“You’re right.” the guy began calmly, “I didn’t introduce myself and that’s a mistake. My name is Cuthbert Sinclair. I like to say that I’m a respectable and recognized collector. I especially love occult and supernatural items. You, my friend, are my new masterpiece, the pièce de résistance of my new exhibition.”
He can smell a delicious smell in the room. His eyes focus on the table to find a gorgeous plate full of pancakes, bacon, and eggs with a big black cup of coffee beside it.
“Thank you, Dean. I’m just going to need some time to make sure that the plan is perfect, but I think we could try it during this afternoon tour. It’s the perfect time because it’s the vampire day of visit and they used to make quite a racket when they arrived in the lycanthrope area which his just after us.”
The next chapter is already halfway written and since it's one that I wanted to write since the beginning of this story it should be done for next weekend! (But as always I don't want to promise anything)
“I’m not "intimidating him", Metatron began mocking the other’s monotone voice, “I’m just telling him that he should expect some less joyous time in his near future”
Dean was back in the middle of his cell after his little bathroom break. One thing was sure, that weird let-me-take-you-to-the bathroom spell was really creepy.
“COME BACK HERE! YOU ASSHOLE!” Dean shouted. That was followed by the great Winchester-insult-dictionary. Of course, ugly-suit never looked back, so Dean stopped after a few minutes.
“Yeah, you right” Sam agrees making Dean chuckle happily while taking his fork. Sam just grab the lemon-meringue pie in his hand before proceeding to smash it in his brother’s face while laughing.
The human look too and effectively, the Teddy guard seemed to have a liking for snacks. The thing was full of chips, Jerky, and even M&Ms. And that’s was only what’s on top of the mountain inside that bag.
When he was happily munching, he raised his head and looked around in the room to see that the debris of his chairs have been removed and replaced. On the new chair the hunter found his flannel shirt neatly fold.
“Stay right where you are human. Enjoy your dinner.” That last sentence was said like he physically pained her. She probably meant something like ‘Hope you’re gonna choke’
We? Who the hell are we? Dean just stares at his phone, still processing what just happened during this phone call.
With that word of wisdom, the angel just walked away and went through the hallway assuming that Dean will follow him. And he was right.
The young man hoped the infirmary will be empty. But since life isn’t that easy, it wasn’t. Well, at least the two beds on the side were empty.
Now the small music was back and the door behind him was opening. The young man didn’t feel the weird pull that usually took control of his leg. That was the proof he needed!
He sounded really bothered by the noise for someone who probably was a prisoner just like Dean. Looking to his left, where he thought the sound came, he was able to see a little vent trap on the wall. Now that he knew where to look, he could see the same vent trap on the opposite wall.
Right. Being thrown out of bed when you’re sleeping peacefully to hear Sinclair's voice first thing in the morning is not a good way to wake up. Dean was not happy, and he needed coffee.
“Pam and Ash stayed up there too to help design the new heaven. They hated the old one so much.” Bobby continues.
“I have no idea… She just sounded so weird and she didn’t even know who Stevie was. She said she’s coming here and apparently she’s not alone.”
But Dean was still a little scared to anger the wingman, so he held his sassy come back. He went to work on the second door with Castiel starring at the back of his head. He could feel his breath in the back of his neck.
“My friendly fairies, I invited you because your people always were the most encouraging during the darkest time of my fine establishment. You helped me a lot in the past to assemble my collection. For me it was the most logical thing that you were going to be the very firsts to be introduced to my most precious specimen: The Archangel Michael’s sword!”
Dean understood the angel plan and slowly starting to comply, taking the attire from the angel and put them on the shelf at his side but not without a little comment :
Castiel stood tall and Dean could see that he was slightly smaller than him. But the guy was so intimidating with his huge wings, it felt like he was a giant.
They separate a little, but the exhaustion of the day just hit Dean full force and make him yawn. Today was just an emotionally difficult day, having part of their made-up family back and now having his angel in his arms again.
Soon enough after they closed the door behind them and he heard it lock, Dean found that he could stand up again.
Dean continue to read his book, which is more interesting that he first though. He never heard that werewolves had secondary gender before, after all he didn’t really care about stuff like that when he was disseminating a dangerous pack.
Dean slowly came out of hiding and advanced in the room. He passed behind the folding screen. Wasn’t that screen black two seconds ago? The first thing he noticed was that the room looked arranged just like his.
“Yes, Dean?” The response came clearly and shortly after the question, like if the guy was just standing near the wall since Dean left before.
He just stood there, hoping that they will get bored and move already. The fairies were talking among them in a language that Dean couldn’t understand. There were studying him a little too much for his liking, so he decided to take a book in the shelf and sit in the most opposite corner. He just wanted to bury himself and focus on anything else that wasn’t the tooth fairy special army. It was a book about the diversity among werewolves and other were-creatures, some books like he used to read while staying at Bobby’s. The perfect distraction! He took that book because that was the first one he caught, not because he founded that topic particularly fascinating, but reading about werewolves isn’t the funniest of activities, so he really whished that his public would get bored.
"My name is Naomi. And I am an angel. I am the one who got Castiel out of Purgatory when you failed miserably. Do you think that vampire scum knew how to get out of Purgatory on his own? Of course not! We implanted the pair of your images in his mind to find you. Don't blame him, he doesn't remember a thing. Besides that, Castiel is now carrying an abomination and he needs to be monitored by Heaven. I will take him when he reaches his eighth month. Do not doubt that Dean Winchester." Naomi said, glowering for a moment, then a flutter of wings and she was gone. Dean shook his head and squinted his eyes. For some reason, he couldn't remember what had just happened. He thought there was someone here, but obviously there was no one.
"Well, Marion, I am looking for the baby shower aisle. My...wife is having a shower for our babies, and well, she is sick right now, so my brother and I are here to shop." Dean said politely. She blushed, at both of them.
"Our baby is not a physical manifestation. It is attached to my Grace and is as immune to human weapons as I am. The baby is safe." Castiel assured Dean. Dean almost fell over in complete relief, but then straightened again.
"Guys! He's waking up! Turn down the lights. I'm going to go get him." Dean hissed, causing Sam and Charlie to frantically finish up. Dean sighed at them, then went back to his and Cas' room. He walked in and saw Cas lying on his back with his hands folded over his abdomen, looking at the ceiling.
"Thanks Sammy. Thanks both of you for coming to get me and killing Naomi." Dean said, much to the confusion of Sam, and Cas.
"She really got him, didn't she? Just hope that she doesn't show up. That is all I have to say. And before you ask why I helped you, it's because I hate that angel bitch." Crowley said, then he disappeared. Cas had wide eyes and could barely move. Dean could feel sickly yellow fear and horrible confusion streaming through Castiel's mind.
TMI. But seriously, this is great! When can I come over?" She bubbled into the phone. Sam arranged for Charlie to visit the next day. Sam told Dean that Charlie was coming and he immediately perked up. The kid was like the little sister he never had. Well, unless you count the occasional appearance of 'Samantha', the chick flick Sam.
"You were Charlie's hand maiden? Isn't that a position for a woman?" Castiel asked. Sam and Charlie laughed loudly, while Dean's neck colored a deep red with blush.
"H-How could you have known? I went off on my own." Cas mumbled, blaming himself for what had happened. If he had just gone with Dean, or been smarter about it...maybe it would not have happened.
"The neph-the baby will gestate for approximately nine to ten months, a little bit over human gestation time. When it is time, the child will detach itself from my Grace and become a sentient being. Unfortunately, it will be very painful for me. The angel equivalent of labor pains." Castiel explained. "In that time, I will still be able to use a majority of my 'mojo' such as flying and smiting, so we may resume hunting. But I believe it would be best to stop those activities after the sixth month."
"Yeah, better than White Castle?" He joked as Castiel nodded furiously. After the burger, Castiel was back in the pantry, scouring the shelves for more food. "Don't we have anything more? I have always wanted to try an Oreo. I have heard that they are 'milk's favorite cookie'. Though it confuses me on how an inanimate object can have a favorite anything." Castiel muttered as he sat back down to a laughing Dean.
"Okay. What's up with you and Cas?" Sam asked, raising an eyebrow. Dean sighed and put his head in his hands.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak in holy matrimony." Dean chuckled in his head at the name. Cas had insisted on using it to honor Jimmy, who was now in Heaven according to Cas. It wasn't like he was going to have it for very long, but the marriage license needed a last name. "Dean Winchester, do you take Castiel Novak, as your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?"
"Everything is wrapped, and I am definitely NOT bringing those in here. He can go out to see them." Charlie huffed. She put her hands on her hips and looked around. "Impressive boys. Good job." Dean nearly thanked her, but he felt a stirring in the bond, which meant Castiel was waking up.
"Yeah, sounds perfect. I'm gonna chill in my room and get finished packing." Dean said, leaving the room before Castiel could thank him. Castiel shrugged and decided he could do it later.
"This extremely bad, Sam. If Dean has been gone for only ten days on earth, then that means it is the equivalent of ten months in Heaven. Who knows what has happened to him in that time?" Castiel cried at Sam once he found out where Dean was being held. Sam felt his throat constrict in fear for his brother. Dean was all too familiar with torture, but that did not make it any easier to think about.
"I may be with child, Crowley, but that does not mean that I will not smite you here and now." He fumed, exuding Heavenly power as his eyes glowed white. Crowley raised his hands in defense.
"OMG. You are going to be a Dad! And I can't believe you FORGOT to tell me! And-OO! Oreos!" Charlie gushed as she grabbed a cookie from the container and shoved it into her mouth. Dean rolled his eyes and ushered her inside.
It would take a long time for him to heal from this, but with Dean's tender gestures and his understanding for what had happened...Cas knew he could do it.
"Hey, bub. Find your own room." Noah snapped, making sure whoever was at the door couldn't see Cas' face.
"Dean has never, ever called me baby. I have always been his 'babe' and him my beloved. Tell me what you are before I smite you!" Castiel yelled with Heavenly power. The glass of water on the table nearby shattered into a million pieces, as well as the lightbulb in the lamp as Castiel's real voice threatened to burst through. Not-Dean whimpered and covered his face.
"I need all of my Grace, and there is a small portion in you. So, if I am to figure out if something is inhabiting my body, I will need your portion of Grace as well." Castiel explained. Dean inhaled sharply and subconsciously put a hand over the scar on his arm from Castiel when he raised him from Hell. Castiel laughed, the sound almost desperate for something to break the tension.
“Wow, that impressive man! You need to teach me how to do that!” Dean said with a little bit of wonder.
"Dean, you silenced the bond? Why did you do that? Is something wrong, beloved?" Castiel asked. The fake Dean shook his head.
"You've seen every thing in my head, and you still ask me things? You must be stupid or something." Dean spat back. Naomi slapped him across the face, filling his mouth with blood. "I think you forgot, Naomi. I was tortured in Hell for thirty years before I gave in. A few months of drilling won't get me."
"Uh, yeah. We are." Dean said, taking the keys and looking at them. "Thanks." He waved as he headed down the hall where she directed. Dean looked at the doors and the numbers on each of them until he found 204.
"Oh, oh my. I am so...so sorry! I...I don't know what just happened Charlie. Please forgive me!" Cas blubbered, tears pricking at his eyes. Charlie furrowed her brow, then began laughing hysterically.
"You better. Because so help me Father I will smite you if you didn't." He threatened, sending a playful anger through the bond. Dean responded with a faked disappointment.
Dean put another chaste kiss on Castiel's lips then went to get the Sasquatch from wherever he was in the bunker.
" Dean looked at the camera with disbelief. "Seriously?! What the fuck is this?! Are you trying to make me the bad guy here? Because I so do not appreciate that!" Dean stared rapturously at the screen as he scrolled down even further. "
Dean got up and went to the pantry to get the Oreos. On the way, he heard the buzzer for the door. The cookies in hand, he answered the door to find Charlie. She wore a Lord of the Rings shirt with her bright hair spilling down the front. She lit up when she saw Dean and squealed. She crushed him in a hug, smiling incredibly wide.
Castiel emptied his bladder, then returned to his barstool, where his drink was waiting for him still. He took a long swing from it, and he immediately felt happier than he did before, which Noah must have seen, because he put his large hand on Castiel's knee.
"I swear, when I get out of this, you are going to wish you were in Hell to get away from me, you bitch!" Dean spat, tears rolling down his face in anger and sadness. Before she could say some smart ass comment, Sam burst through the doors and took in the scene.
"Dude, can I just call you Samantha for the test of your life? Because, damn." Dean joked. But inside, he was completely grateful for everything, because he was extremely nervous. It was, without a doubt, the second most important thing that was ever going to happen to him, Sam's birth being the only thing above it. Dean wanted everything to be perfect.
"But I love Cas. And its for a celebration! He likes cake, and its his party. So we are getting cake. Got it?" Dean commanded. Sam put his hands up in mock surrender, but grinned widely as Dean went to the confection counter. Sam went off into the store to get something, he wouldn't say what though. Dean searched through the In the glass case was a perfect cake, swirls of blue and pink on it and it said
"Dean" kiss "wake" kiss "up." Cas pleaded. Dean peeled his eyes open with extreme difficulty and looked at his lovely blue eyed angel. He tried to talk, but his throat betrayed him and closed with relief of seeing him. Dean pawed lightly at the bond, attempting to open it, but failing. Castiel touched the connection and it instantly flared open in a wonderful display of scarlet, sapphire, emerald, and magenta. Only Dean and Cas could see it, but it was an intimate feeling. They regained each other's mind, and Dean wasted no time in reclaiming the angel for himself.
"I guess...I'll see you guys all later. Please make sure Benny is sufficiently miserable, and if you are in the jury for John Winchester's trial, vote guilty. Alright, I'm Castiel, and have an intriguing day."
"No, sugar, you shoot it all at once. You don't sip it." He grinned, and the smile seemed somewhat inviting, so Castiel swallowed the entire glass in one go, like he remembered doing years ago with Ellen Harvelle. The liquid burned his throat, but something about it was just...satisfying.
"Don't be scared, Cas. I've got you. Whatever this is, we can handle it. Right?" Dean asked as he pulled him into a hug. Cas nodded into his chest, fighting stinging tears.
"Its gonna be okay, Cas. We are going to find Dean and then you and him are going to have a pair of kids that are gong to drive me nuts, got it?" Sam scolded, smiling softly. Cas nodded his head and wiped away the tears. He grasped Sam's shoulder and stood up straight.
The hunter got up and took Castiel's hands and led him to his room. Together, they laid on the mattress with Castiel in Dean's arms, as they found themselves most of the time. He laid on his chest, fingers entwined on one hand while Dean played with Castiel's hair and Castiel traced the planes of Dean's muscular chest. They were blissfully unaware of the surrounding world in that room, they only felt each other. That was, until Castiel felt another movement in his abdomen.
"Damn. Now I can't ditch you. Oh well." He shrugged and shoved Castiel lightly. Cas laughed and pushed Dean back, forgetting momentarily that he was, in fact an angel with far more strength, and making Dean fall over. The playful mood vanished as Castiel rushed over to help him up.
"Um, actually...both. We're having twins." Dean said, picking up a few rolls of powder blue and pale pink streamers and putting them in the basket.
"I actually thought we were going to find out instead of a 'yes'. Screw him, come on babe, let's finish our already great day." Dean asked, and Cas nodded. The rest of the evening went off without a hitch, Mrs. Team ad Kevin left shortly after Crowley did though, very paranoid that he would come back. Garth stayed until Sam and Charlie had to usher him out so that Dean and Cas could have some 'alone time'. Before Sam left, though, he walked over to his brother and pulled him into a hug.
"Dean, technically have no gender. I only reside in this Vessel as a male, and now that Jimmy Novak has passed on to Heaven, the body is mine." Castiel explained. "Which means, as an angel, I can bear children, though I never thought it possible."
Sam got dressed in his black suit with a lighter green shirt than Dean, and a deep burgundy tie, then he ushered Dean hastily to the pulpit where the pastor stood, beaming at him. In the seats was Kevin besides his mom and Garth sitting next to Jody on the other side. Charlie and Cas were no where to be seen, which worried him a little bit, but he knew that they were waiting behind the door. Even though the bond was cut off, Dean could still feel the excitement buzzing through. It made him smile that Castel was just as excited as him. Sam ran quickly around the benches of the church to into the foyer of the chapel with Charlie and Cas, leaving Dean alone at the alter. A bead of sweat dripped down Dean's face as he pulled at his collar. Then, the doors at the back opened and Charlie and Sam came walking through, arm in arm.
"Cas, a baby shower is...well its a party that celebrates you being pregnant." Sam explained. Cas nodded with understanding.
Castiel decided that his favorite month of his pregnancy so far has been the seventh month. The constant hunger for strange things had finally gone, along with the tiredness that seemed to come with everything he did at first. The only downside was the fact that his abdomen kept growing, which Dean thought was cute, so Castiel guessed it couldn't be all that bad. Dean though, was curious as to the reasoning behind many of the cravings he got once Cas had enough sense to answer without a hasty "because I want it Dean." Cas couldn't really explain it, but he did end up finding on or two things that he kept eating.
can hide. So why on Earth would I keep a secret from you like that?" Dean said, taking Cas' head in his hands. He put his forehead to Cas' and smiled. "I love you." And just like that, the bond burst open with forgiveness and love streaming into Dean's mind. He sighed in relief, his mind feeling so pleasurably full compared to the emptiness it was in the hour before.
"Wait!" Dean yelled after him, Crowley's lip twitched into a smile as he turned back to face him. Cas furrowed his brow and looked at Dean, confusion prodding Dean's mind.
"I feel so hurt. That you two would go and get Cassie here knocked up and not tell me! Dean, I thought we had a better relationship than that." He said, putting on a mask of feinted horror. Dean paled when he heard what he had said.
Castiel looked at the man who had hit on him with a poisoned glance and left the bar. Cas walked down the streets in the darkness, not afraid, because he had fought nearly anything that he would possibly face in the night. When he was heading down an alley, Castiel heard footsteps from behind him. Someone was following hi with staggered steps, bumping into things occasionally. Cas turned to see what it was, hoping he wouldn't have to fight anyone or thing while he was so pregnant. Instead of a monster, he found the man from the bar. The drunk smiled lopsidedly and sauntered up to Castiel.
"I just want to make sure the fans are okay. I've already sold some tickets. Would they refund it?" Dean asked in concern, and Castiel shook his head sadly.
"Dean! What happened?! Is everyone okay?" Sam asked, bursting into the room with a panicked look. Dean stood up and put his hands up.
"How much has he been sleeping?" Sam asked once he was out of the room. Dean shrugged and laughed a little.
"Hell yeah you aren't most angels. You just so happen to be mine." He grinned, stretching his freckles widely, leaning forward to press a kiss to Castiel's forehead. Castiel sighed in contentment and closed his eyes and somehow, fell asleep in the embrace of his hunter.
It started one day when the trio were in the Men of Letters bunker watching television. Castiel had become very attached to many of the shows, such as Sherlock, or other cop shows. He was lying against Dean on the couch, while Sam was in the library trying to figure out something about their latest hunt. Castiel suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, one that prodded him to fly to the restroom immediately in order to throw up the contents of his stomach, which was mostly bile. From outside, Castiel heard Dean pounding on the door, asking what was wrong.
The couple walked out of the store hand in hand to the Impala. After putting away the groceries in the trunk, a voice came from behind the pair that made them both freeze in fear and anger.
not a morning person..." He taunted playfully. Cas came in the room with a bowl and a spoon sticking out of his mouth.
"Well, lets make a compromise. Not black, but not blue or pink either. How about...red? Or maybe like a light green? Something that isn't for specific genders." Sam suggested, and Dean perked up.
They got to the hotel, yes hotel, not a motel, Sam and Dean had a separate room from Cas and Charlie, who was going to be staying with Castiel, as well as getting him ready for the next day. Dean and Sam decided to have a small Bachelor's party between the two of them. Beers, burgers and pie were brought to the room as they enjoyed their night, until a knock came at their door. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and went to answer it.
"You could wear a paper bag and look wonderful, babe." Dean said, enjoying the smile on Cas' face before it could vanish.
"You have hurt me. You have nearly killed me, and that was before you even set foot in this room. You took me from my mate, brother, and children, and now, you will die. I am the mate of Castiel, angel of Thursday, and you took me...wrong move, bitch!" Dean shouted with multiple voices, his own being drowned out by several others that shook the room with power. An archangel sword unsheathed itself in his hand, and he grabbed Naomi's shoulder and plunged the blade through her chest. She gasped in pain and fell to the ground. Her wings burned to the floor quickly as she died, putting a smug smile on Dean's face. Dean turned to face Sam and Cas again, smiling with no humor. "You see, to forget that this body was meant to be the Vessel of Michael himself, a bit of Grace from you, Castiel, has done nothing to harm this body. Thank you Castiel for access to your Grace. It will now return it." Dean exhaled and the white faded from his eyes. The returned green irises were still bloodshot as they fluttered closed and Dean fell to the floor. Hard.
"God, Cas, you're such a white girl. All you're missing is some Uggs and leggings." Dean laughed, holding his stomach as a photoshopped image of Castiel popped up on the screen. The image was of the disgruntled Castiel with a latte in his hand, and badly photoshopped leggings on his bottom half, as well as a pair of tan Uggs.
"I just said I was worried, because the last time I was this happy, Naomi took me and tortured me for a little less than a year." Dean spat at Sam.
"I am still a celestial being Sam, though my stomach has become the size of a celestial body. I can hear you." Castiel yelled from the kitchen. Dean laughed, both at the annoyance tinting his mind and at the flustered face of Sam.
"Why can't I feel you?" Dean asked, his mind feeling empty. His chest began to tighten as he started to hyperventilate. Castiel looked briefly into his own mind and smiled lightly.
"Hi guys!" Charlie said. She squeezed Dean in an embrace, then did the same to Sam. Charlie crossed her arms and looked at Dean. "Why didn't you tell me you were having twins? That is something the god-queen needs to know!" She cried. Dean and Sam shushed her.
"I am not going to tell you how I know, because then you would probably kill me, so I'll just tell you."
"Just so you know, that picture was all Dean's idea, not mine." Castiel huffed, crossing his arms and looking slightly like he was pouting.
"No way. I gotta help you. Is there anything I can do? Get you a towel? Or something to drink to get the taste out of your mouth?" Dean asked, rubbing circles on Castiel's back. Castiel just nodded. Dean understood and he got up and left to the kitchen to get him some water. When he went back to the bathroom, there was no one there. Instead, he found the angel on the couch where he was before. Dean furrowed his brow.
It took far too long for the two of them to finally realize what they felt for each other, but they finally did realize this. A hunter and his angel. Or an angel and his hunter. However you looked at it, they belonged to one another. It was always the two of them.
"Dean, Dean listen to me you need to get grounded." Castiel insisted. "You're in a bathroom right now, you're safe, and you're not going to be hurt." Castiel said firmly. "I want you to breath with me, five seconds in, hold for eight, five seconds out." Castiel inhaled deeply, insisting that Dean do it with him. Dean was still breathing rapidly, but he tried to match his short, choppy breaths with Castiel's deeper ones. After a minute or so, Dean's breathing had slowed down and his heart had ceased racing. Dean looked up into Castiel's cerulean eyes and gave a short nod to show that he was okay now. He stood from the toilet and noticed that Castiel had broken the door down to get in to him.
With that, Castiel just picked up the teddy guard. And he didn’t even flinch while doing that even if the guy probably weighed more than 220 pounds. Again, that super impressive so, note to Dean: don’t anger the angel who could clearly break you in half.
While holding his razor blade tightly in his right hand, he slowly opened the door to take a pick in what was behind it. Castiel said that the commotion that he will create between the vampire and the werewolf will probably occupy most of the guards around here. Even if the guy seemed to know his stuff, Dean couldn’t be too careful.
“You have access to all the things that I hoped you could use. I’m going to write the plan that I imagine but the important part will be the timing.”
“WHAT? What girlfriend? What are you talking about? You know what, I’m just in front of your big scary bunker, I don’t even know how I came here!” Charlie starting to sound freaking out more and more, it’s so different from her composed self Dean knew in apocalypse world. “Please Dean, just told me you still leave there?”
From what he was currently seeing, they did a wonderful job. After all, with the spell he was using on them to make them obey his wishes it was the only thing they could do.
“So what’s the plan?” Dean relied on the other since his first plan worked great. Dean had an idea, but it sounded just crazy in his mind.
Twenty minutes later there a knock at the door and Miracle is happily barking next to Dean to tell him to go who’s there already. With his new companion in tow, Dean took the stairs and open the door.
“Let me look.” Those questions where weird but his friend was motivated to find a book so Dean couldn’t just go ‘bye! Goodnight!’ when his friend sounded like that.
“What? Of course, I have to pee.” The ‘Duh’ at the end of the sentence was left unsaid but you still could hear it pretty clearly in the intonation. “Why did you sound like that was a big surprise for you? Did you hurt your head?”
Dean is a simple man, a few seconds later he was sitting and enjoying that fantastic breakfast. It tasted even better than it smells!
I'm sorry if a mistake escaped my editing. I’m really doing my best, but I still need English lessons.
“I’m working on it.” Dean himself wasn’t convinced about what he was saying.  “But just so you know, you’re not invited to my prison break.”
And even if he’s 40 years, Dean is physically still strong and tough, so he went to do some tests at Lebanon’s fire station. He just got the news that he is now a proud fireman who’s starting his training next week.
The face the guy made look like the one of a three-years-old telling his mommy with great disappointment that he couldn’t lace his shoes. This guy with these huge scary wings shouldn’t be cute like that.
Dean heard when the kid hit the glass before, so maybe his neighbor will hear if he hit the wall. That was just a theory, but he didn’t have anything to lose if he tried.
“No, I know. I’m done and I’m going to retire and probably just manage the phone and help hunters in need of lore. I actually already found a job in Lebanon and I start training next week.”
They’re so much more than Dean wants to say but he never was great at expressing his feelings. Emotional constipation aside, he doesn’t even know what he could say. It’s the first time he says that he misses him. Not that he doesn’t miss him since that day, but he just couldn’t say it, afraid to hurt Cas if he could hear him in the Empty. Poor angel was in super hell, he really doesn’t need to hear this kind of thing. But today, he just came out. Seeing a part of his family coming back but not he just made his absence even more notifiable.
Of course, Dean did not listen and try to grab one on his way but just end burning himself. “HOT Bread!”
He was going to turn around and look at the different book in the shelf when he heard footsteps echoing on the pavement. He quickly jumped into bed to pretend that he was asleep to try to spy who that was.
I hope to not let you wait so much before the next update but i don't know how irl life will impact my writing time in the next weeks. I'll try to write more but if you want a sign of life from me you can find me on twitter @Mikey-Ran !
Dean was sure that the guy was just going to storm in the room like he owned the place, so he started to walk just to meet a wall of feathers.
Castiel pushed Dean aside and took a few steps back to close the door a little to be able to talk to the young man. He started his quick monsterology lesson while whispering.
Wide eyes, Dean looks to Charlie inside his arms wearing a grey t-shirt and pink flannels. He pushes her a little and try to look at her in the eyes.
That was the first thing that Dean felt. Then he had that weird feeling, like if all his limbs just wanted to stay asleep, and he didn’t have the force to open his eyes. He didn’t fight it because sleeping seems like an excellent idea right now. He just tried to stir a little but quickly fell back to unconsciousness.
Dean tried to look serious even if he felt like “impostor” was stamped in his forehead in big red letters. That feeling didn’t go away when Castiel stopped next to the white doors that Dean didn’t see because of the big black wings in front of his face.
“Dude you can’t be serious.” Dean was becoming slightly annoyed. “This guy is just crazy, there no such thing as angels. And even if they were, they wouldn’t give a crap about me. I mean come on, if they have, I should have had a guardian angel or something to protect my mom when I was a kid. She was killed by a demon, that’s a pretty great proof for me that angels are not real ‘cause I’m sure that demon and angel are liked opposite.”
Castiel is probably one of the best hunters he will have the chance to meet! He can’t wait to get out of here and maybe Bobby and Castiel could met too! If they share their pieces of knowledge, no monsters would be able to keep secrets from hunters!
Castiel was stuck here since longer than him so he probably already tried a lot of other plans. The guy with all his knowledge was probably a hunter with a big book collection like Bobby. At least he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
He just needs to find a way to tell his brother that he completely retires from the hunter-on-the-road life. He doesn’t know how this conversation is going to end but hopefully, Sam will understand.
Dean is in front of his computer looking for info about the Empty when he hears his brother coming back with the little click-clack of Miracle’s paws. Deans know that Castiel wouldn’t want him to try a rescue mission, but Dean can not just continue his life without trying to get him back. How could he go live his own life after what Cas told him? At least Dean needs to know if Cas can hear the prayers is doing every night so far. For now, it’s just mundane things about what happened in the day, like Dean was just praying his diary to him. Dean wishes he could tell him the four-letter word but what the point if they can’t at least hug. And if Cas can indeed hear everything he said, that would just hurt him so much.
“Sleep now, Dean. I’ll watch over you.” Dean falls asleep to the sensation of Castiel kissing his forehead.
He did what he had to do in less than that time when the voice spoke again to told him that if he needed an extra 5 minutes, he could find a button next to the toilet seat. Dean took his time finding it, knowing that it could be useful sometime soon.
“I slept like a baby, man. And I did what you ask yesterday. I can give you my notebook through the vent.”
Dean doesn’t have time to think about that because he’s suddenly walking towards the door and quickly found himself in his room/cell again. He can only be glad that he doesn’t really need the 30 minutes for his shower because having to come back naked and full of soap isn’t something he wanted to experience.
"Yeah, no kidding." Charlie agreed. Sam sighed and got up from the couch where they had basically lived on for the past ten days.
"Do...do you not remember? I could feel this...horrible red hot anger seething through the bond while I was getting ready, then, it was just gone." Castiel explained. Dean was surprised. He thought he should remember getting mad like that, but for some reason, there was nothing that he remembered like that.
"Yes. I believe so. It will be hard in my current state, but it will not harm the babies. Once we reach Heaven, I will be at a higher strength, so that may help as well." Cas said. He unsheathed his angel blade and nodded towards the door. "Go get the angel sword you have, we are going to need it."
"Oh Cas...I had no idea." Dean whispered, his eyes wide at Cas' story. He had just seen the aftermath of the evening, but he knew nothing of beforehand. Gentle hands came to cup Cas' face, then wiped away his tears. Cas leaned forward and pressed his ear to Dean's chest, listening to the uneven heart beat of the man.
Dean had donned Cas in some of his clothes, old and worn, but still comfortable enough, as well as attractive. They made Cas feel a little bit better, but nothing had healed his broken heart since the angels fell. Smiles from Dean, a new book, Sam's uncontrolled laughter, killing Metatron...nothing made Castiel feel like the angel he used to be. Dean constantly told him that he used to be a dick, and that him as a human was far better, but shockingly, that did nothing for his near non-existent self esteem.
"I'm really sorry, Cas. But this ghost we were hunting ended up being something completely different than we thought. We're going to be gone for probably another day, okay?" Dean explained, sadness in his voice from being so far away from his husband. Cas sighed and agreed.
"I said it once, and I will say it until you get it through your thick, human skull. Good things do happen." He growled, anger seeping through the bond to tint Dean's mind with anger.
All the anger Dean felt immediately evaporated and was replaced by apology and horrible pain for Dean's mate.
Dean hummed along to the tune as he made himself some toast and poured a glass of OJ. He sat down with his peanut butter toast and juice and nibbled on it, grabbing his itinerary to read over. He didn't like having plans for events like this, since they always changed in the moment, but they were essential to the way some people worked. People like Cas, he was beginning to realize. Castiel couldn't go a day without knowing exactly what was happening at ever single hour of the day. Dean didn't mind most of the time. Dean looked down at the itinerary and noticed that he would be doing a panel with Castiel tomorrow morning, then a meet and greet on Sunday. That's not too bad, though he did notice that there was no signing.
"That is nice. I am glad that he had you when he truly needed someone. You are a good big brother. I wish I could say the same. I haven't been there for most of my family recently, especially since I started YouTube. They all think that it's weird, and after my last video that revealed my true sexuality...well, they haven't been overly supportive. I wish I could have a brother like you." Castiel looked over at Dean, and there was something in his eyes that just wasn't there before. He blinked slowly, and he took in all of Dean, his kind smile, his spattering of freckles, the way the lights in the room shone on Dean's tan skin, and he just beamed brightly, happier than he had been for a long time.
"Be patient, Dean. You are my present. I get to unwrap you however I want. Also, if I want to leave the bow on my present, that's my choice." Cas smiled mischievously. Dean finally got it, and widened his eyes and looked into the blue orbs that he loved.
"I...I don't know what you are talking about. Cas is a guy, he can't get pregnant!" Dean shouted, noticing that no one was around to hear him. Crowley chuckled and shook his head.
"Shh...don't worry baby, I'll take good care of you." Noah whispered into his ear, before dull teeth started to nibble on the lobe, then Noah pulled away just enough for Cas to open his mouth to respond. Instead of words, a garbled sentence came out.
and they mentioned it." Cas explained. Dean nearly choked on air. Sam stared at Dean with a gaping mouth.
Dean had lost count of the days since he last saw Castiel. With his head so pitifully empty of the bond that he once held so closely to his heart, Dean was broken. Naomi knew this. Once a day, she would come into his cell and drill into his mind to find information. Information about Castiel, the babies, Sam, his family; anything she could get. By the end, Dean was screaming in pain and nearly dead. Then, Naomi would heal him and put him back in the prison. This went on for ten months, and everyday, Dean prayed for his angel to come for him, but he never did.
"I need your silver knife." He asked much to Sam's surprise. Sam took it out from his belt and handed it over. Castiel grabbed Not-Dean's arm and cut across it hastily. The wound blistered and burned as he screamed in pain. Sam jumped back in shock.
On cue, Dean’s face popped up from the side of the screen, and he waved at the camera. “Hi everyone! I know, I know, dream come true, right? I have fulfilled your dreams and fanstasies just by being here, huh?” Dean said cheekily, winking at the screen.
"Don't say its your fault, babe. Its his fault for being a douche and a predator. I'm just happy you and the kids are okay. Speaking of which..." Dean threw aside the comforter and lifted Castiel's shirt to show his stomach to the cool air. "We are very excited for you two. I love you Mary Elizabeth Winchester." He kissed one side of Cas' belly. "I love you Bobby John Winchester." He kissed the other side. He smiled and kissed Cas again on the lips. "I love you Castiel Winchester." Cas smiled contently and let waves of happiness wash through both their minds, tinting the bond a glowing orange. Cas pulled his shirt back down and laid on Dean's broad chest.
"You said so yourself, he's out of town. Nothing to stop you pretty boy." He suggested, trying to wink at him. Castiel looked down the bar for June and waved her down.
"Mother angels, or in my case, father angels, can determine the share and pattern of the child's wings before they are born by looking into the Grace of the child. I figured that even with our case, I would be able to get enough information from Mary Jo and Bobby's half-Graces to construct accurate representations of their wings." Castiel murmured into Dean's ear.
“I don’t want to say I knew it, but henny…” Jonathan tutted and shook his head. “Looks like we just gotta show Dean how fun the rainbow is, huh? And I am thinking that we might need to make this a double episode,” he said. “Because Cas is… well, he is a lot. I just want to get my hands in that hair of his and just go crazy!” Jonathan enthused.
"Cas, what happened? Are you okay now?" Dean said as he sat beside Castiel, allowing him to snuggle into his side again, much like an oversized cat would.
"I didn't know that things could be lighter than other drinks. I would very much enjoy to start out with something like this." Cas decided, and the man ordered another shot for Cas, and Cas went to sip it, but the man laughed and shook his head.
"Dude, that would be perfect! Throw a surprise party for him!" Sam said once he was sure Castiel was out of earshot. He still whispered though, not wanting him to eavesdrop.
"Cas! What was that?" Sam asked once Castiel had steadied himself. "I am unsure. But I felt a pain in my stomach and it caused me to temporarily lose my balance. Apologies." Castiel murmured before shuffling to the kitchen. He arrived to the smell of bacon and grilling patties. The stove was full of pans; one for the hamburger meat, one for bacon, one for the toasting buns and one grilling onions. Dean barely acknowledged Castiel, but shortly after he arrived, Dean placed a plate with a nearly perfect burger in front of him. Dean sat across from Castiel, looking smug and completely proud of the food, especially when Castiel moaned in pleasure after only one bite.
That took Dean by surprise. He stopped and turned to face Castiel completely. He was standing in the aisle with a stupid grin plastered across his face. He was looking down at his stomach and Dean could feel something like a big, warm happy haze settle over his mind. The bond glowed with a bright orange joy and it made Dean smile and go over to Cas.
. Dean prodded at it mentally until it opened again, once more flooding Dean's mind with Castiel's thoughts and feelings. One of the foremost emotions was adoration.
Dean clutched his chest and stared at the door of the stall, his eyes wide as he felt the walls of the stall closing in on him. He pressed his hands against the walls of the stall, his chest rising and falling rapidly with the frantic pounding of his heart. His vision blurred and the floor tilted as he struggled to stay seated on the toilet. His vision went from blurred to black spots dancing in his eyes from the lack of oxygen, his mouth opening and closing like a fish on dry land. Dean couldn't breath, and he couldn't even think enough to think of what he needed to do!
"You and Sam have been so good to me during my pregnancy, it is only right I return the favor in some way, so I made dinner." Castiel declared as Sam came into the kitchen. The Sasquatch grinned and sat at the table eagerly.
"Ah yes, Mr. Winchester. You two will be in room 204. Just go up the hall there and to the right." She directed, handing them two keys. "The WiFi password will be in your room. Are you two here for the convention? I've had lots of people in for that." She smiled.
The only advantage of having a singular mind again was being able to try and figure out what was happening to Dean, but Cas started to have doubts. About the babies, their marriage, and even their bond itself. One day, Castiel decided to confront Dean.
"Indeed. But it i starting to get late. Charlie, are you planning on staying for dinner?" Cas asked. She nodded and went to her backpack that she had discarded when she walked in. She rummaged in it for a second before pulling out a DVD set of
"Thank you, Dean. And I am here for you as well. If you ever need anything, I am just a message away." He smiled, his blue eyes twinkling. "So, next question? Date of birth...I think I remember hearing that it was January...uh, not the 21st...oh! The 24th!" Castiel decided, and Dean made a face.
"Well, I do not think either way. I just want our child to be healthy." Cas stated. The brothers nodded in agreement as they made their way out of the warehouse.
"He...he told Sam to say hi to me." Castiel said, his stubbly cheeks turning a bit pink, but barely enough to see. "I know he's been in such a horrible relationship, and how he's going through such shit...but I just want to be able to be there for him." He admitted. "I think I'm going to fly out to Kansas to see him. I really hope he's not in a hospital like those people said." Castiel raised his hand to his lips to chew on the nail nervously, then he batted it away, stopping himself from biting the nail.
He woke up again later without knowing how much time has passed. His head was still hurting him but now he could at least feel is limbs. He tried to move his hands to his face, trying to block the small light that was bothering him even with his eyes closed. When he moves his right hand, it felt heavy, and he heard a weird metallic sound when he bumped a wooden surface before he even remarked that there was something attached to his wrist.
"She better be good to you. Because if she hurts you, she'll have to deal with Sam and I. No one hurts our little sister." Dean said with assurance. Charlie laughed and shoved him lightly. "What's her name?"
Cas winked and led Dean to their room where they spent the entire night and next day. The argument was left undecided because they were far too caught up in euphoria to even remember the date, let alone an argument.
"Okay Cas. We agreed. No hunting or mojo once we got to month six. That means no flying to the kitchen when you get midnight munchies, no poofing yourself to the bathroom anymore, capishe?" Dean said to the frowning angel. Castiel nodded and looked down at the floor.
“Well, uh, we met almost ten years ago now. I was in a really rough spot in my life. After the fact… I sort of refer to it as Hell because of how bad it was. I was in with bad people, and I did bad things for a long time. But then… I met Cas. He sort of pulled me out of the whole mess.” Dean explained the best he could. It wasn’t a lie, but it also wasn’t the full truth. “We didn’t get along at first but… after a year of knowing each other, Cas gave up a lot to help me and Sam. Ever since then, we’ve been friends.”
"You're right. Now, I am freaking exhausted. I haven't slept right in over ten months. My bed missed me." Dean grinned. Cas smiled mischievously.
"Made some breakfast before I left." He shrugged, then pulled out his phone to read the text. "Wait what? They cut our signing?" Castiel grabbed the itinerary and read it over. "They cut... your signing. Mine is still there." Castiel noticed with a deep frown. "That's not right. We were supposed to have all our events together, and they can't just take that away from you!"
"Hey, hot stuff. I told you I was gonna regret it if I didn't bring you home." He said, getting uncomfortably close. Cas stepped away and sneered at him.
"I do not wish to speak with someone so inebriated. You may say something you will regret later." Cas suggested with a scowl. The man laughed and leaned forward.
. Tan had had a suspicion they had a closet case on their hands and now it seemed confirmed. Together, they flocked Castiel, hugging him, shaking his hand, and cooing over him. Tan thought to himself that Cas’ wardrobe could use a makeover too, but at least he wore that suit well. The blue tie really brought out his eyes.
"Where did you hear about it?" Sam asked him, curious. Castiel shrugged and finished off his cereal.
was rolling its beginning credits and Dean was walking over to the couch with a large bowl of popcorn.
“That’s very noble of you.” Jonathan enthused, over Sam most of all, smiling at him dreamily. “If you would like, we can post about your charity? Maybe on Insta or Twitter?” Jonathan asked. Sam momentarily freaked out internally, then shook his head.
Castiel just sat there, his mouth slightly open as he felt a wet tongue press over his sensitive veins, and Cas whined, shaking his head and shutting his eyes. The feeling of the itchy stubble that Noah possessed was not enjoyable, and neither were the lips that were slowly working their way to Cas' lips.
"Of course not honey. Besides, you're not exactly my type. I'm lesbian, so no worries. The name is June, by the way." June held out her hand for him to shake. He took it, relieved she would not try anything.
"As if you really wouldn't go. This is only your second event. You went to PAX East, but you didn't go to West." Castiel teased. "But I'm glad you got that back. We have a few hours until the plane takes off, so how does leaving at 2 sound?" Castiel offered, and Dean looked at his watch. It was almost eleven and their plane left at 4:45. That sounded about right.
Cas listened idly to the chatter of the other two men in front of him as they spoke of various monsters a hunt could be if they ended up going to Minnesota for it. As of that moment, they decided it could be a rougarou, a ghoul, or a Leviathan, which made Castiel's nose crinkle.
"Is...I mean...would you know if he...um..."Sam trailed off, not wanting to finish his sentence. Cas widened his eyes in fear and disbelief.
"Do you have the rings?" Sam nodded and pulled out the pair of rings. Dean's ring was black tungsten with a silver band through the middle, engraved with the Enochian symbol for Castiel, and Cas' ring was the opposite, a silver band with a black strip in the middle, with Dean's name in Enochian. "I believe the grooms have written their own vows. Dean?" The minister gestured. Dean pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and opened it.
"So, I think we are up against a woman in white, because a-Cas? Dean? Are you guys okay?" Sam asked, putting down the book and jogging over to the pair.
"Is it a good thing or a bad thing? That he's been sleeping I mean. I know that he is kinda human cause of the babies, but is he suppose to sleep and eat so much?" Sam inquired, honestly curious and concerned.
"My name is Castiel. My husband is out of town and I was kind of sad. He usually comes to bars when he feels similarly, so I tried it. It s not working like I thought it would." Cas admitted, taking a sip of the beer. It was cold, but bitter. Cas had only had beer one other time, and that had been solely out of nervousness. He decided it didn't taste too bad, so he took another swig.
"I dunno Sammy. I just feel like something is finally going right for us." Dean said. And while he meant it, he sincerely hoped it would last.
"Yeah, it's okay. The dickhead that hurt you is gone, Cas. I promise. I cleaned you up last night, but nothing else happened." Dean swore, and he turned the shower off, but instead of pulling Cas out of the bathtub, he climbed in with him, moving Castiel's ratty black hair out of his eyes. "Are you okay? What even happened?"
A picture of the burly man from Dean's last video appeared on the side of the screen with Benny's address and phone number.
"She said she was going to need all of three hours to get here, so pretty much anytime would be good."
"Can I have another?" Castiel asked, grabbing the second shot and downing that one too. The burn of the harsh liquor was welcome, as he had been finding out much he really deserved some pain like that. And when it came in something like a liquid that hurt, but not enough to make him stop, he welcomed it.
"Get out of here." Sam growled gripping the door in preparation to close it. Crowley sighed and shook his head.
"Yes, I capishe." He grumbled. Dean smiled and added a little bit through the bond, because Sam would kill him otherwise.
"And then...there's John Winchester." Castiel practically roared, standing up and making his chair fall over. "Dean's father is the one who hit him!! You guys all saw his face, right?! John did that! How could anyone hit their own child like that??? What would make someone stoop down to the level of hitting someone more than half their age?!?!" Castiel shouted, throwing his arms up, then he kicked his couch behind him, taking his anger out on the furniture. He kicked it, threw the pillows, pounded on the cushions, and he finally fell down onto it. After he fell, the camera did a quick jumpcut to later on, where Castiel was back in his normal chair, an ice pack on his foot from kicking the couch.
"I made this for you guys, you know, since you don't like cake, Dean. So, this is my present. Congratulations." Garth went and hugged Dean tightly. Then he let him go and pulled Castiel into an embrace. Then, Kevin gasped, and Mrs. Tran grabbed a flask of holy water from her belt. Crowley stood in the middle of the room, his regular black suit with a red shirt was exchanged for a grey one and a blue shirt. He was smiling, though not happily, just...smiling.
"OMG! Thank you! i am going to be a god mother! Ew, that sounds weird. How about...god-queen! Because I
"Just so you aren't bored with the details, let's skim over it. I'll read some aloud." He cleared his throat, and began to read. "
"Yeah. I'm a little nervous, but I'm more excited." He assured him. He then yawned and laid back in the bed again. "I'm gonna try to get to sleep. Got a big day." He smiled, rolling over so his back was to Castiel. "Night."
Sam shrugged and he turned and walked away, and Dean turned back to the screen. "Don't mind him, he's just being a little shit. Alright, where was I?" He scanned the page, then he nodded. "There.
"Okay...I-I...well, Dean and I forgot to announce this on my last video that I posted with him, but he was the winner of the Newly Friends Game, and he will hopefully be receiving the bragging rights whenever...whenever I see him again." Castiel said the last part very quietly.
Queen of Moondoor, so I am officially this little one's god-queen!" Charlie declared, patting Castiel's stomach tenderly. Dean scoffed.
Sam grinned and nodded. “Yeah, I know. But they’re really sweet guys and they just want to help Dean build his confidence.”
"Hey, Cas? Why do you call Dean 'beloved'? Is there any rhyme or reason to it?" Sam questioned, honestly curious about the answer. Cas' cheeks tinted a light red and he looked at Dean.
"She. Ate. My. Oreo." Cas fumed, his eyes blazing in their azure way. He wasn't quite furious yet, but Dean could tell he was on his way. Charlie widened her eyes and raised her hands in defense.
"Ooh, that's a good song, but not my favorite. It's a tie between Zepplin's "Ramble On" and "Traveling Riverside Blues". Either one would have worked." Dean shrugged.
"I've mentioned the number in my videos before, Dean. It is not something random that there is no possible way of knowing it. Yours, however, was a bit ridiculous. There are so many songs to choose from. There is no possible way to know which is your favorite." Castiel said logically, which made Dean huff.
"DAMMIT." Dean cursed, putting down his bags with a heavy sigh. "C'mon! Can't we go one day without problems!?" Dean gave an exasperated sigh and sank down into an office chair. Castiel looked at the bed, and he too sighed.
"You got it, babe." He planted a small kiss on the top of his head as he got up, then went to the kitchen. Castiel laid down on the couch and sighed. He felt his eyes flutter and he dozed into unconsciousness for the second time that day, despite Sam's protests. Castiel woke up to the smell of fresh burgers and smiled. He swung his legs around to the floor and got up fluidly, as he normally did. However, a sharp tug in his abdomen sent him to the floor. Sam, who had been in a chair nearby, rushed to the angel's side and helped him up.
The screen went black for a long time, about twenty seconds, before it flickered to life again. But instead of Dean's face, it was Sam's concerned face.
"Cas..that sounds so nice. Like a girl's name." Noah pointed out, and Castiel just shrugged. He wasn't a fan of the way humans always gendered names and various duties, but now that he was human, he had to accept that he was part of that.
"I have to go real quick and serve some of these guys, but I'll be right back, honey." June smiled and walked away, leaving Cas to his drink. He was able to take another sip before a hand landed on his shoulder and pulled him around to face someone. The hand belonged to a man, who was probably 45 years old, with dark, oily hair and dark eyes. The gaze he had set on Cas was predatory and hazy all at once, and he was smiling with damaged teeth. He smelled heavily of alcohol, especially when he exhaled in shock of seeing Cas' face.
Cas winked and sent incredibly suggestive thoughts towards a punishment. Dean laughed out loud to try and hide his slight embarrassment. Sam just glared at him.
"Oh, Dean. I missed you so much. I am sorry about the bar incident. It was my fa-" Cas tried to explain before Dean silenced him with a passionate kiss.
"Obviously, you normally miss everything. It worked. And now, Cas, lets find out what you have inside you." Dean said, getting serious once again. Castiel nodded and closed his eyes for about a minute. Then, he furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head. Suddenly, his eyes flew open.
"I-I wan' ta...g-go home." Castiel sobbed, full tears coming down his face as the man pressed inside of him painfully, but his thick tongue and numb body would not respond to his mind's screams of pain. It wasn't until the thick length was fully seated inside of him that the door opened, making Cas open his tear soaked eyes, somewhat blinded by the brighter light from the hallway.
"Well...that was certainly more than I bargained for. I didn't think I would get so into it. As it appears, I'm already almost ten minutes into this video, and I've only read one fanfiction. So, I guess I'll have to make this a series, huh? Maybe you can go nag Cas about this stuff and try to get him to do it." Dean snickered, and he closed the small window, so it was now only him in the video. "Okay, I'm out of here. I'll see you all later, and remember, never be afraid to reach out to me if any of you need some help with anything. I'll try my best to talk to every single one of you." Dean smiled widely. "Bye!" He waved, and the screen went dark.
“Well, I could look out for the wing, but I’m needed near the werewolves’ zone. Apparently, there was a fight with vampires or something.” Dean explained, trying to sound like his ass was needed elsewhere very soon. 'Cause he looked so professional in his guard uniform after all.
Dean started removing his shirt but noticed that the angel was staring at him like he was fascinating.
“I already deactivate Sinclair’s control over them before you arrived. We don’t have any minute to lose, we need to get out of here. I’ll explain everything I know later when we will not be in danger of the guards coming here.”
When the girl put the tray on his table, they both turn toward him. Dean winked at them trying his best, but he didn’t receive the attention he deserved.
The young man tried to take a few hesitant steps and cross the door. He didn’t have any difficulty to move so he continued in direction of the door at the end of the hallway with his razor blade as his only weapon.
The angel question was met only by silence… Dean was sure he already heard his father talk about that but like one time maybe? Skinwalkers were rare and Dean never saw one until today apparently, so he wasn’t really informed on what they were. He knew his father wrote stuff about them in his journal, but he didn’t bother to read about them since he never cross paths with one. Actually, his father wrote a lot of stuff Dean didn’t bother to read and he had the feeling that he would start to regret his laziness soon enough. But come on, it wasn’t totally his fault since the young man was hunting solo with a father AWOL and a brother at Stanford. It was just safer to hunt your regular Casper when you didn’t have a partner to watch your back.
“Yeah, I’m thinking about them too.” Dean doesn’t say that it’s the only thing he think about since they’re finally free, trying to be happy for Cas. “You know that pain not going to go away. Right? But if we don’t keep living, then all that sacrifice is gonna be for nothing. So quit being a friggin’ Eeyore, huh? Come on! Get into this.” Dean takes his first sweet delicate pie in his hand like he’s holding something precious because it is.
Dean was just starring at the wings so Cas resume talking like everything was totally normal “Dean, I need you to unlock the padlock of the chain. We need to go before Sinclair understands our diversion.”
Well, as expected that didn’t do anything except a very loud “bong” noise and what felt like a huge bruise in his shoulder.
Dean pounced on the coffee. It’s heavenly, just like he deserved after this morning from hell. When he felt a little more human, he started to dig on his pancakes. They’re delicious and Dean’s moaning like a pornstar without a care in the world.
When he was done writing everything, he secured his notebook in his pocket to have it the next time he can talk with his neighbor. For now, there still no weird spell to bring him back in the other room and he doesn’t know how much time he still has. The young hunter started to look around just to be sure that he didn’t miss an exit way the first time he got here. He also tried to see if he could plan his evasion behind the toilet, Michael Scofield’s style. He knocked on the wall behind it to hear if it’s sound weak or if there something behind it. Unfortunately, TV shows aren’t great teachers and he had no idea if the noise mean that he could go and dig it or not.
“Humm” Dean brains blank because they didn’t really talk about the cover story of why Dean needed to bring this angel prisoner in here. And what kind of injuries, an angel could even have?
“Is that all you hear from my plan?” The angel sighed like Dean was the biggest burden of his existence. “I need you to do your job seriously Dean. We will not get very far if Sinclair’s men discovered the deception as soon as we get through the door.”
“I forgot that you need to eat regularly as well. I think they gave you breakfast instead of lunch this morning because you slept a lot. Your body needed to rest after the spell Sinclair used on you to bring you here.”
Dean continued his perfect and complete inventory with the toothbrush, the dental floss, and the shampoo because he had no idea if Castiel started a plan. For all he knew everything could be useful.
This weird cabin was missing a wall. All he could see from his bed was a few feet of grass before a weird pavement with some decorative cobblestones. The small light illuminating the room was in fact just the sunset light.
Sam acknowledges what Dean said and goes to his room brushing his hair probably. Dean does not really care; he just wants to see what’s wrong with Charlie.
Dean was currently looking at a very disturbing anatomy diagram. He was looking at a dude with the regular dude parts but there was also a uterus on the picture. It was just so weird and unexpected that he didn’t know if he was in denial, very interest in the functioning in a scientific level or scared that he could have already killed a pregnant dude on a hunt. Maybe he killed a baby without knowing it. But if he killed a pregnant werewolf lost in a killing rage and couldn’t be reasoned, does that make him a bad person?
On his tiptoe, Dean reached for the trap to slide the book in it and he felt Castiel pull it to his side.
The other was like a crazy genius that couldn’t stop his rambling. It was very weird coming from that usually stoic guy. He didn’t seem to acknowledge Dean at all.
Of course, I hope you guys like it and understand it, but college is stressful enough that I don't have to stress about what I do with my spare time.
That night, Dean makes everyone his special burger and they just share a meal with some of these special people who they consider family.

He saw while seating up that, at least, he was still alone in the room. He slowly stood with his stomach grumbling. He remembers his last meal, a takeout burger somewhere on the road just before stopping for the night in a motel in a town in Kansas after he left Bobby’s place. How many times has passed since then? If he asked his stomach, he felt like a week, but he couldn’t have stayed unconscious an all week, could he?
For a train and supposedly really good hunter that was probably the stupidest decision that he ever had.

At the end of the hallway, Dean found himself in front in a normal-looking white door but with the same weird sigil drawn on it. He tried to open it but it didn’t move. The young man thought that finally, real life and real problems were back when he saw a button on the wall looking like a switch. He pressed it and heard a little click. He tried the door again and Bingo! It was open! Apparently, Castiel was known to be the regular Micheal Scofield around here but the door wasn’t even secure on that side.
“I’m glad to hear that you’re enjoying your meal. Did you sleep well? Are you well-rested?” It’s funny for Dean to hear that kind of question being directed to him because he was the one asking them to his little brother before going to school a couple of years ago.
“No.” Well at least that response didn’t give Dean any fake hope. “If I had, I wouldn’t be here genius. So now, you can stop banging the wall!”
The collector slowly stood and made his exit from the room still watching the young man. It was time to tell his assistant to bring him in his new quarter.
But here, he didn’t have anything to do when he was still trapped in his cell. It’s seemed like his body knew that and was just happy to be able to finally be sleeping.
