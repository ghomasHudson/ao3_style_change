They are not young, though, and the this rug does little to cushion the hard floor. Sherlock shifts on his knees, only slightly, but with his movement John quivers into awareness and time resumes.
to him, he was going to take this time and fill his lungs with Sherlock while he could. But his breaths soon became gasps, became great, gulping mouthfuls that he could neither still nor steady.
What followed was...furtive. And raw. Harsh, in the dust and sand. There was nothing soft, that night in the desert. Nevertheless, James was tender, during and also afterwards, tucking John back into his clothes, folding his fatigues back into place, making him tidy. James valued neatness. And gentleness, it seemed. He kissed John once more, before stepping away.
Sherlock knows. The penance he has set himself has been…harrowing. Perhaps John’s confession might seem to signal an end to it, but as usual – perhaps that is the only way for them? – they are getting tangled in anger and misunderstanding.
and his tongue was still hissing the sibilant when John’s tongue glided in beside it. They’d kissed and kissed, John’s arms reaching up under Sherlock’s shoulder blades and crushing their bodies together as lips slid and tongues darted and sparred.
. And all at once John was tired of fighting this. Without opening his eyes or raising his head, he answered honestly. “Yeah.”
. “Sherlock!” he gasped, and again, “Sherlock!” because it was the only word he could say without betraying himself completely.
John considers. On her belly, she feels safe, but she won’t be able to see, and Sherlock could only really reach her back, unless she rises to all fours, and oh
“I want you to stay. I want this, and more of this, and everything else you want to give me. I know—you said—you didn’t want to tell me, but I want…” Sherlock pressed his lips together, then plunged onward. “I love you too, and I want you to say it again. Sometime. I want you to
Sherlock’s right hand becomes more insistent now, the pads of three fingers slipping and circling over the furrows of skin at John’s opening. Tickling and twisting, swirling and slithering, letting the movement both soothe and sensitise. He keeps up his glides and wriggles until he feels John draw and release a deep, deep breath, and his shoulders relax. His body rests a little more heavily on Sherlock’s arm.
“I like it too. And that look you’re giving me back? I like that, too. For every value of me. I could...I could smile at that look...forever.”
It was everything he wanted. He is too angry to say so. Also, whereas once he would have taken this gift any way it was offered, he does not want it like this. So John is right, in a way. Sherlock does not want this. Not this version, at least.
Without transition Sherlock is angry. It is sudden and unexpected and consuming. That John should make this offer out of rage, through clenched teeth, in response to nonsense uttered by some idiot in the pub, some idiot who
. No one knew how it worked; you just stayed out of that not-quite-real space where fic took place, and it happened...someplace else. Mycroft once let slip that it happened, instead, to another version of you, one that was willing, but that made no sense and John was happier letting it be. “You can just...stay out of it.” That much at least he understood.
Instead he watches John’s neat fingers tug at the laces and pull at the heels, watches him slip his socks down his ankles, watches him turn them right side out and tuck them away, one into each shoe, and make them tidy on the floor.
“John.” Her awareness snapped back in time to meet Sherlock’s eyes; they were wide and dark and earnest, there between her knees. “I’ve got you. Please.
Sherlock straightened, then, and brought John up and away from the door at his back, and now there was room for them to wrap their arms around each other and
Was that what this is all about, finishing this? John came here to convey his final message and then leave? For good this time? Even more completely than when he got married?
“But I do know, John.” Sherlock adds another finger, letting the opening stretch wider than must be quite comfortable for John. (John will want a penance.) “You’re trying to tell me you know I’m a man, a man who takes you up his arse, and you don’t believe anything you’ve been told about men who do that, even if you can’t help thinking about it all when you
Another grind of his hips. “No more fingers. I want your cock.” And then, as John’s eyes went dark and intent, he raised his head. Spoke distinctly. “John. Now.
Much, much later, worn out and sated and drifting lazily to sleep on Sherlock's chest, John had a hazy thought that made him startle himself awake with a laugh.
John is not the only one who can hide his reactions, however. Sherlock’s expression as he looks away is carefully neutral. He—fully clothed still—leads the way down the stairs. The thud of his shoes contrast on each step with the fall of John’s bare feet.
, but John’s head dropped low and his shoulders bowed and he came, hard, over Sherlock’s hand, the sheets, and his own downy belly.
He was deployed the following week. Harry didn’t find out until just before he came limping home, leaving him with no place to stay and a phone that nobody wanted anymore.
“Well, cheers, Sherlock. Luckily for me, there are a few folks out there with a better imagination than you. And better taste. I get porny one-shotted all the time.”
In that moment of stillness, everything is possible. John could shout, or flee, or—as with any divine vision too holy to be real—vanish altogether. (Sherlock does not believe in divinity or holiness, but he wishes distantly that he’d washed his hands and feet.)
“Still not finished. I do want to be brilliant, I do, I don’t just want to conduct light for you, but I want to be my own kind of brilliant, capable and practical.
Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off of John for an instant, but John moved faster than his eye could follow. The next instant, the gun was on the ground once again and the murderer was up against the wall with John’s forearm pressed against his throat.
“That's not—” Sherlock stopped, then took another shaky breath and said, softly, “I've just, just learned not to hope for it.”
He spoke slowly. “I need to be clear. You were terrified of this, Sherlock—no, you were. And now...you changed your mind, you said. Which you’ve never done before. And frankly, that’s bloody fantastic. If I’d known what it would do to you, I would have slammed some arsehole’s head on a wall a long time ago.” The questioning in his eyes belied the tough talk.
“Because they’re precisely the sorts of louts who would deny it to their last breath if anyone commented, and likely land a punch on anyone who was admitting it too freely, despite their seeking every possible pretense to touch their fellows in as intimate a manner as possible.”
It was too much. That look, from those eyes. John would be utterly undone. He closed his eyes. “Know what.”
Sherlock blinks, and stares, and blinks, and stares. John has let her bind her wrists and has rutted herself to orgasm on her hand, on her arm, and this when she hardly ever lets anyone
He used to think she was so cheeky and charming. He forced a smile. “Of course, of course your belly isn’t gigantic. I thought you were joking. And you do look beautiful. Healthy.”
(Sherlock had told her, once, laughingly, that it reminded her of the movement of the metal claw inside the machine at the supermarket that reaches down to grasp a toy, and John had been distracted by the image of her own hand on the joystick, guiding the claw down to scrape lightly up the sides of Sherlock’s breast.)
” Ah, here was John again, the John he knew in bed. “You can beg all you want but I’m driving here. We need—”
“I thought I did. I had him all figured out. Clever. Too clever by half. A little damaged, a little distrustful, but romantic. I thought. With a weakness for a happy ending. And kind—or maybe compassionate. Towards others like himself, at least. But looking back, I can’t quite see what evidence I had. I reasoned without having all the facts.”
Bit by bit John becomes aware of another problem, too, as he rolls his body over Sherlock’s and reaches around him. He hooks a leg over Sherlock’s hips from behind, wraps an arm around his shoulders, and in the next instant he’s faced with a vision of the two boys in the park, and their radiant faces.
“Yes. I thought you’d be angry. Or maybe...scathing.  I definitely didn’t expect…” His eyes flick to Sherlock’s, his meaning clear.
, does that make sense? And maybe the only real part of me I have left. So, no. Not terrible.” He meets Sherlock’s eyes now, unflinching. “I love you, and I’m sorry for, for a lot of things. Really, um. Really sorry.” He winces, gives a wry, mirthless laugh. “But not for that. It’s not terrible, and I don’t have to be angry to say it.” He blinks, and Sherlock thinks he has run himself out at last, but then he says, “There. And here, again: I love you. I am in love with you.”
Half a grin and half a nod from John, and they were kissing again, and this time it was not Sherlock pushing and John yielding, but both of them reaching, grasping. At last, at
. “God, Sherlock, I hope so.” They stare at each other. Those are tears glittering on John’s lashes. “I hope so. Is it?”
WIth his mouth over hers she couldn’t talk, thank god, and the only sound she made against his lips was one of mild surprise tinged with amusement.
“You took off your shoes in order to give me a gift you knew I wouldn’t want.” That is as close as he will get to actually asking for an explanation.
John feels her eyes fill and doesn’t dare open them. She smiles a little, though, and says, “We agreed...no more keeping secrets.”
push Sherlock away, make him leave, so instead he stood there, and accepted his kisses and the caresses of his hands, caring, cradling, until he felt so...so precious that he forgot to hate himself.
For a long moment it was only gasping and shuddering and the pounding of his own heart in his ears before he registered the low, soothing voice crooning—
John rested his hands on the waistband of his jeans, his fingers curled around the button. He met Sherlock’s eye and licked his lips, then flicked open the fastening and slid down the zip.
John returned her mouth to Sherlock’s, and kissed, and kissed, and kissed. She kept the kisses gentle – lips, but not too hard, sucks, but not too deep, tongue, but only brushing,
Mockery, at least deliberate mockery, meant to hurt, was not Sherlock’s style at all. His wreckage was usually unintentional.
“I, um.” John is speaking now, if only barely. “I. It’s not, it's not. Well. Inconvenient? I mean, yes, it is, but that’s not – ” A huff of breath.
For a confused moment he tensed, scrambled, an apology leaping to his lips, but Sherlock’s hands gripped his arse and drew him all the way up and his muddled
John’s body is straight, military straight, his spine drawn up, everything tight and closed off and defiant…except his eyes. His eyes have gone peculiarly...deep.
Thank you, friends, for staying with this odd little fic for all this time. You've been marvellous company.
but has no idea if John believes him, and no more breath to ask. There is something else, too, an odd feeling swirling around his chest and behind his eyes, one he has no name for, but which is preventing him from saying any more. (On the whole, he feels, that is for the best.)
“Oh! That’s a humpback, I’m sure of it! Look, John, over there!” Sarah, flushed and joyful, grasped his arm and pointed, pulling him to the rail. They had to stand close together in the crowd, but John certainly didn’t mind.
John could feel her own arousal beginning to swell, her own nipples tingling in sympathy, the wetness starting to work through her own vulva. She knew if she touched herself her clitoris would be swollen –
Sherlock pressed his lips together. Still confused and a little lost. “John, I don’t know what you’re trying to do…”
And then John’s train of thought was abruptly derailed as Sherlock’s tongue came out for a long, slow swipe, all through the folds of her vulva and up to the tip of her clitoris.
There had never been anyone else in his life like this. There’d been sex, of course; it hadn’t been terrible, good enough to make it worth taking advantage of some of the opportunities afforded by good hair, a deep voice, and a piercing gaze, but nothing like this.
Sherlock is silent. They walk on, leaving the disorderly youths behind them. “Anyway, kids’ attitudes have changed a lot since we were that age. Some of them don’t deny it. And a lot of the others don’t feel the need to hit them. Their friends might just be glad for them.”
Sherlock has no words for how John’s eyes look. Lost, or oddly full. His fathomless eyes atop his rigid stance give him a look of resolve and infinite sadness that is wholly unbearable.
“You like that, do you? You’re so bloody sexy. I could play with you like this all night. I’m incredibly turned on, just so you know.”
, John thought unkindly. But when Sherlock needed help, John helped him. He cleared his throat. “Me,” he said.
They were kissing in bed. John had requested that Sherlock ask, and Sherlock had, and they were kissing, a delicious slide of mouths and a warm press of bodies. It wasn’t frantic, it wasn’t fraught, it was just
It is not Sherlock’s hand that touches her, it is Sherlock’s cheek, coming in close to John’s face and brushing along her jaw, as her nose burrows into John’s long hair, and her mouth comes to rest by John’s ear. Sweet and intimate.
, opening himself up for John was appealing; indeed, there was nothing he would want more. The more he thought about it, the more appealing it became. Sherlock was not shy about his body. He wasn’t afraid of being seen.
A rustle of fabric and a shift of the air warned John that Sherlock was moving, and he opened his eyes in alarm, in time to see Sherlock stepping right into his space, still with the same look of deep compassion. John felt his eyes go wide, felt the panic begin to bubble in his gut, and wondered frantically why he was still standing there instead of backing away, instead of fleeing altogether.
And exactly like a wolf being dominated (he assumed—he had deleted a lot about wolves), Sherlock had gone pliant under John’s hand, only turning to stare at him; at a loss, but making no attempt to free himself.
Whatever Sherlock wanted, so that when Sherlock took his hands from John’s face and ran them over John’s hips, lightly, and up his sides, passing over his ribs, John obligingly leaned back to give him room, and when Sherlock’s thumbs stroked, glancingly, over his nipples through his shirt, he let his eyes fall closed and his breath flow out of him, and melted into Sherlock’s touch.
John, of course, showed no reaction at all, and the next moment released the man into the hands of the NSY officers who began to fill the alleyway. There would be questions to answer eventually, but no one—after a look at John—seemed inclined to ask them now.
John drags Sherlock bodily up the stairs, past the sitting room door and up to the next landing. John’s room. John’s
they are all exactly what Sherlock thinks of in relation to John, but he has never before been able to get the words out, and now, with John’s slick heat stretched tight around him, open and trusting, they flow like a river.
(though he does wonder about that last one). From what he can tell, they’re enjoying the sunshine with a good, rowdy rough-and-tumble, and he can’t see what’s got Sherlock’s goat.
They had separate rooms, but Sarah was getting friendlier during the day, and the goodnight kiss of the first night had become goodnight snogging by the third. On the bed.
Sherlock decides, and heaves himself out of his chair. One little goodnight kiss is not going to frighten John away. He probably won’t even wake up.
No sense denying it. “Yeah. You could say that.” John forced a smile, but even he could feel how pained it was. “But you didn't even think of it.”
She trembled on the brink, unwilling to back away, afraid to tip over. John had reached this point before, but only rarely. Always before, she’d backed off before it hit. Always, she’d turned the tables and made her partner tremble and howl in her stead. She
furious, and his anger made him spit venom. When the man had targeted Sherlock with his seething spitefulness, John had loosened a few of his teeth for him.
. Lov—fine. He’d gone so long without touching anyone, that was all. It was a lot to take in. But he knew what to do, and how to do it, and when he slid an arm up behind her and pulled her body close, he did feel a spark ignite, and his body began to respond. Thank goodness.
With every stroke of Sherlock’s long fingers, John’s breathing settled, until the desperate gasps gave way to shattered panting, and finally to long, slow, quavering breaths. She came back to herself enough to focus on Sherlock’s words:  “You did it, you incredible woman, you did it.”
There should be earthquakes and cataclysms, but no. They can touch. This ground is no longer forbidden.
“I mean it’s not about power or—or role play. Okay? It doesn’t mean any of that. It’s just bodies. And what feels good.”
?”) Had been disappointed but not surprised when she had joined the ranks of the women who had too much self-respect to stay with John Watson for long. (“You’re just...married to your work,” one of them said, kindly. “Go back to all your soldier boys,” said another, less kindly.)
Sherlock: looking hungry, one beat, two beats, breathing the air that John was panting out, looking at John’s wide eyes that hid nothing, John was sure, none of his  breathlessness or shining need. John looked back, having given over all control, his mouth wet and wanting, waiting to be claimed.
“Nothing.” Swiftly, eyes closed. Expressionless. Then he opens his eyes again and looks Sherlock straight in the eye. “Absolutely fucking nothing.”
“You don’t need this one for anything, do you?” His voice was flat, impassive. Cold, a seasoned killer. No interest in drama, only in cool efficiency. No, Sherlock realized, with something like dread, this one would not stop to talk.
with her tongue and going rigid with her own climax, and John’s cries came wild and loud and high, for several long seconds - ringing and triumphant, and she usually so silent - a howl that crumbled into ragged, gasping breaths,
On a particularly deep thrust, Sherlock gags, choking and sputtering, and his eyes tear up. John tries to pull back, to pull away, but Sherlock’s hands tighten on his arse and pull him back in tight, despite his raw throat and his streaming eyes.
Coming up behind Sherlock and wrapping her arms around her waist, naked, her own irrelevant breasts pressed firmly to Sherlock’s back. The palm of her right hand sliding over Sherlock’s ribs, crossing the smooth plane of her belly before moving upwards to cup her breast—only one breast, in
How was it possible that he hadn’t heard John come in? He barely avoided guiltily slamming his laptop shut, which would have been a giveaway even to John. His hands did twitch on the keyboard, though.
John’s beautiful body. John’s dear, beautiful body. He smiled, in spite of his tension. “Extraordinary, isn’t it?”
He froze where he sat, but there was no earthly force that could have torn his face from the haven of Sherlock’s neck, because if he was going to be dislodged in a moment, to be patiently
It had happened so many times now, he ought to have stopped reacting. He kept his voice neutral when he said, instead, “What is it?”
Then a long lick from between the inner lips to the very tip, long and wide, firm (not ticklish), and another, and another, Sherlock’s hips rising with every pass, so that when John made her lips more solid now and closed them around Sherlock’s clit and
of her, made John suddenly, almost painfully aware of her own state of arousal. Her nipples were tingling, her breasts were flushed and full, and her pelvic muscle was twitching and fluttering.
The implications of what John has said hover between them, settling over the lead weight of his bitter and resentful declaration of love. Sherlock once again finds himself speechless, looking inward for some part of this that makes sense, that fits. He does not mark the passage of time.
“It was understandable. You were expressing a sentiment that you find inconvenient and distasteful. Are you supposed to sound happy about it?”
They hadn’t discussed this. But in the stuttering, strobing landscape of his mind, Sherlock supposed it ought not to come as a surprise to find John’s fingers circling his arsehole, since surely two men having sex might be almost
So it was that he and Clara were drinking together, but the rest was a little...blurry. It was just him and Clara and at some stage they’d started...this. Whatever
John did, John let him. He let his hips be stilled, he let his desire build, he let Sherlock touch his cock and kiss his chest and suck his collarbone. He let his whole body go lax and pliant under Sherlock’s hands, so that when Sherlock unbuckled his belt and undid his zip and reverently laid open the plackets of his trousers, he gave himself over completely to the sensations.
Only then did John push his slick cock back between Sherlock’s lips and thrust and thrust—hard, too, no more holding back, hard and rough—into the back of Sherlock’s throat until he came with a rasping growl.
The desire in John’s eyes was the only difference. Everything else, Sherlock has seen and pictured a thousand times. It was only this look that was new.
Only a moment, though, because everything he wanted was set before him, for him to touch and taste and have, and looking—though wonderful—was nowhere near enough.
John’s opportunities for grave risk-taking would soon be at an end. He seized this one while he could. “If you want, sir…”
John was smiling; his mocking tone had no bite to it. He looked from the screen to Sherlock’s blazing face and spoke casually. “So this
Sherlock felt his own smile settle on his face. He didn’t bother to ask John how he knew. John was a genius too, after all.
John was not out to these people and no one was speaking up (although no one looked particularly happy with this line of discourse either) so Sherlock just sat, and listened, and thought he might understand a little better why John has been so hesitant to bottom during sex. If this was the sort of talk he found unremarkable.
She was  intoxicating like this. It didn’t happen often. Sherlock was nothing if not confident in bed. Pushy. Imperious.  John loved it. She loved having a partner who could meet her  blow for metaphorical blow, who would not wither under John’s own forcefulness, but push back and allow their pleasure and desire to spiral ever higher. She did not have to hold back with Sherlock.
. Taking Sherlock’s flesh in great, grasping fistfuls. Sherlock’s mouth opened wide under the onslaught, and her body flexed and arched into John’s gluttonous touch, and if someone tried to consume John like that, she would flee never to return, but Sherlock offered herself freely, to be devoured.
“Yeah, I do.” John sniffed, still smiling. “And it has fuck all to do with my arse, which I know, because I’m a fucking soldier.” Sherlock was already shrugging into his coat by this time, and wasn’t expecting John’s parting words: “I’m done. I’m taking my boyfriend home. If I’m lucky he’ll fuck me.” With that, John calmly knocked back the last of his drink, nodded coldly to the other men at the table, and guided Sherlock towards the door. He did not look back. He did not hurry.
“Fine. Fine. Seems it’s all fine. Back to normal, having adventures, being a dad occasionally...It’s a jolly old life indeed. Apparently.”
Now he looks at John’s bare feet and can’t think of a theory that can match them. There is no possible explanation that does not veer wildly into the realm of the impossible. Sherlock cannot even identify those, merely blinks, and blinks again, and thinks of high roofs and empty vaults.
Just like that, John is no longer in control. He wants to keep his hips still, to be gentle, to be courteous, but Sherlock has the globes of his arse grasped firmly in his two hands, and he is using his grip to pull John’s hips forward, making him thrust.
He held Sherlock’s eyes for a long, long moment, his fingers still working, but slowly. “Tell me what changed.” It was not a request. Hand on his cock, eyes on his face. It was
“Sir?” John kept his eyes on the desert sky, didn’t look back to see the tall figure framed in the doorway.
John gave Sherlock the space of a few panting breaths to recover, lying beside her and kissing her mouth, her cheek, her eyelids. She knew she would run out of time to play with Sherlock’s breasts, that oversensitivity would set in after a while, but she thought that if she did not overdo it, she might have at least until Sherlock’s next orgasm.
The tip of Sherlock’s finger comes to rest right at the center of John’s hole. “I’m not a soldier, John. I’m not.” He presses, ever so slightly. “But I know what a man is.”
of all people, of the two of them, who had the sense to find a beautiful, intelligent woman and settle down? Harry, he reflected, was one lucky—oh. Except that her beautiful wife had cheated on her just before her wedding.
“You and Sherlock were so close. You’re still mourning. That’s all right. We don’t have to do this yet. Maybe you just aren’t ready.”
over Sherlock, covered him, surrounded him, enfolding his entire body on the outside while thrusting deep inside it.
“Oh.” John was capable, very occasionally, of incredible flashes of insight, as well as a certain amount of mind reading. His face grew serious. “Listen, Sherlock, we are what we are. That’s not going to change. There’s a lot of talk about the ramifications of taking particular positions during penetrative sex, but it’s all meaningless.”
Sherlock does, unbuttoning her blouse, unzipping her skirt, and laying her clothes neatly over the chair before unhooking her bra and stepping out of her knickers. She climbs onto the bed and settles on her left side, resting her right arm on the rise of her hip. Not touching.
Sherlock, though, had looked away from John’s face and was apparently riveted by the sight of John’s hands unbuckling his belt and releasing the button of his flies. His own hands had stilled, he’d only got as far as unhooking the fastening of his trousers, and he watched, avidly, while John’s hands worked at his jeans.
They sit there, stuck. Both with their bared soles on the rough surface of the carpet, and neither with anything to say. Sherlock feels he should speak, should say something. As if, as if it’s his turn. John has already said so much. But if he thought that uncovering his feet would unstopper his words, it seems he was mistaken.
“No, no, don’t, don’t go. Please, John. You just, um, you just got here.” Sherlock huffed a little laugh, but his voice was pleading.
When John finally drew his fingers away from Sherlock’s ready opening and stood before him, Sherlock could barely drag his eyes open, and he gazed at John with heavy lids.
John. The real John, sitting in his armchair, completely unaware, and only slightly concerned. While the very angle of his legs as he sits and reads confirms every deduction Sherlock has ever made about …
John began this night in control, drawing and driving Sherlock's body, Sherlock's pleasure. Now, though, Sherlock has driven John to be more vulnerable than she's ever let herself be with a lover. But this is Sherlock, so it's...safe.
this, suddenly. It is not just wanting. His hand on John’s face clenches, slides, pressing and gripping, down his neck and into the collar of his shirt. He needs to gather all of John in to himself. To claim this intimacy that should always have been theirs.
Sherlock is slow to move, languorously flexing fingers and shoulders. He allows John to lift his shoulders and help him slide back up onto the bed. Slowly the red from the pooling blood fades, though his cheeks are still flushed and his lips are still wet and swollen as they curl into a satisfied smile.
But Sherlock’s tremors were turning to shudders now. Her little words were becoming louder, more desperate.
John’s thrusts were firm, but never too deep for Sherlock to handle, and when they sped up and their rhythm hitched, Sherlock wondered if he’d get away with—
Sherlock would like to stay where he is, sitting on his heels at John’s feet, leaning on his hands, breathing, breathing, breathing, forever. John is frozen, has not moved, has not reacted to Sherlock’s—admittedly extraordinary—gesture, and so Sherlock feels able to simply inhabit the moment for as long as he can.
It took John several moments—turning to Sherlock, grasping his arms, running his hands down the sides of his body— to register the wide eyes, the fixed stare, the heaving breath. The lack of a response when he peered up at him.
But they have. He knows. John loves him, of course, but other people do not do things with the wildness that Sherlock does. Other people – even John – don’t feel things that way. He has learned, his lessons have been comprehensive on this point, how to hold himself apart. How to stave off rejection by not offering.
John had noticed, had known all along. Of course he had. Sherlock almost shrugged, though, at how calm he felt, after how frightened he’d been. “Yes, like that.”
So that when John was poised above him with a flushed and leaky cock hovering within breathing distance of his eager mouth, Sherlock had already gasped out,
John, overwhelmed with terrible hope, squeezed his eyes shut. “Be sure,” he pleads. “Be sure you want this. I can't—”
It was frightening. He’d read enough by now to know that it needn’t be painful, for all that John’s penis was...above average. It was not the pain that worried him.
the climax vibrating out from the epicenter, radiating into Sherlock’s thighs and belly into a blossoming climax of head thrown back and thighs pressed ever wider; then one that followed swiftly, almost of its own accord, with little more encouragement from John, thrumming itself out of a slick, full clit and a body straining against its own bounds to open
, because right now every time we’re together all I want is to fill my hands with you, gather up your breasts. I want to, to kiss and taste, to drink in your smell, god. Like you have with me, and bury my face in you, wet and warm, and lick paths up your body, and touch, and if you don’t want me to, that’s, that’s...not exactly fine but I can, I can, but I need you to tell me
When Sherlock shifted his angle, John’s exclamations and gained force and lost coherence. He arched and thrust, moaned and writhed, and filled the air with wave after wave of blasphemy and profanity, which Sherlock knew by now was a Very Good Sign.
there was Sherlock’s hot, wet clitoris, full and waiting. John swallowed a moan as she felt it twitch under her touch.
“I—oh. Well, good.” Sherlock gave him a smile, brittle but genuine. “But we could move, if you want, to the sofa or the, or the bedroom..? Whatever you want.”
that’s right. Now the whole hand again.” And she was once again resting in Sherlock’s palm, rocking and thrusting to meet her firm strokes.
No one can bypass Sherlock’s defenses like John can. The flatness of his tone pierces all of his cold armour and sinks deep into his heart. His lips twitch – where is his control? He has one last salvo. If this doesn’t work, he is lost.
John could not stop thinking the word, it swirled in her head, it danced around Sherlock’s body. Sometimes John imagined the way Sherlock must see crime scenes and suspects and strangers and John herself, the observations and deductions scrolling past her eyes as she took in every detail at a glance. But Sherlock was a genius; John was content to be just herself, no incisive observations or devastating conclusions, just the one word,
Burying his nose in John’s hair, he wraps his left arm more firmly around John’s chest, deepening his thrusts at the same time. He reaches around with his right arm as well, so that the whole weight of his torso lies across John’s broad back, and John is supporting them both with his knees and his grip on the headboard.
A final one, back to kisses and sips, wet passes of wide lips, warm nuzzles and hot breaths, John’s face burrowing deep, two fingers curling, seeking, until Sherlock’s whole body was flung wide and smeared flush with the mattress.
And about as far opposite as it was possible to get from what John actually deserved. He jerked back. “No, I—Sherlock, you can’t, you can’t mean, you can’t…”
It’s not all right. But I’m going to make it right.” John punctuated his words with slow, sensual kisses, and the smallest circling of the pad of his finger around Sherlock’s stretched opening.“And that means I’m not going to do it fast, and I’m not going to do it hard.” He spoke low, with quiet vehemence. “I’m not going to
“Sherlock, get the gun and call Lestrade.” John’s voice was cold, calm. Sherlock forced himself to move, pocketing the gun, removing his gloves and flicking off a text. He could already hear the sirens approaching.
John’s fingers did not press, but only ran up and down the slit, back and forth. John was careful to apply no extra pressure as she did so, but somehow, with each pass, Sherlock’s labia parted slightly. First, the brush of hair, second, the silk of skin, the hint of heat, third, the slightest lick of wetness, until finally, fourth, parting and
Afterwards, John collapsed onto Sherlock’s shoulder and took long, panting, heaving breaths for much longer than it should have taken for his heart rate to stop racing.
At last, he moves. There is nothing for it. If John will stay seated, staring at Sherlock’s chair, then Sherlock must sit there, and see if it helps. If John has something he wants to say, he wants to say it to Sherlock
He let Sherlock kiss him however he wanted to, resting his arms on Sherlock’s shoulders and allowing him full access, letting him turn his head and tilt his jaw and kiss and kiss and kiss. Whatever Sherlock wanted.
on Sherlock’s, his tongue was made to slide across his lips and into his mouth and his hands to run along the whole length of his spine, to trace the muscles of his shoulders and to curl under the round weight of his buttocks, and when Sherlock’s hands travelled in their turn, and caressed his sides, that was only as it should be, and when they pressed their bodies together so that each could feel the hard evidence of the other’s desire, that too was only...right.
. Vulnerable. Offered willingly, now. Where his confession was defiant and reluctant and resentful, this is unforced. Eager.
Sherlock knows about ruin, knows that its effects can happen in waves upon waves, long after the cataclysm appears to be over. Knows the futility of expecting to step away from it with no more harm done than a little dust on one's clothes. Knows himself that when he tried to ignore the devastation he was stepping out of, it only served to spread the destruction outward from wherever he stood, continually. Perpetually. He can see the rippled aftershocks of his own ruin still settling in front of him, his dust and ashes mingled with John’s.
Sherlock’s lips close around the very base of John’s prick, and if he was wild before, he’s desperate now. He sucks and swallows, making frenzied, half-choked,
sound. Her hips began to rock on their own, in small, thrusting motions, meeting John’s finger each time it came to the apex of its pathway.
, their desires. Their fantasies. We’re them. Oh, god. It makes so much sense. That’s it. That’s the answer.”
There is a pause, a silence that drags on between them while they glare at one another. John has said he is in love with Sherlock and their shared rage looks set to burn Baker Street to the ground.
down into the kiss. Sherlock’s mouth fell open, and the melting continued, the contours of John’s lips and tongue becoming soft, liquid almost, flowing into the warmth of their kiss. Liquid, too, was the deep sound that issued from Sherlock’s throat and into John’s mouth, meeting John’s own deep moan, a confluence.
He was pleased, also, to find that some skills and knowledge, long disused, still had not deserted him. He knew that if he kissed Sarah’s neck and she arched into his touch, he could draw a hand up her side, and cup her breast. He did so, and she arched some more, and made a little noise.
pressing her lips in deep, allowing herself a single broad swipe of her tongue, mouth open, lips grasping.
They're still women. They're still having sex. You're still reading, so clearly you don't object to either of those facts.
“Indeed. You're right, I should have predicted all that. From the turn-ups on your jeans, perhaps? Though I do think that if it would have changed so much, you might have considered just, oh, I don't know.
Sherlock complied eagerly, pulling back her arm to draw her fingertips over and around John’s clit, letting the small, swollen mound slip and roll between them. She turned her hand over and grasp John’s sensitive nub lightly,
Sherlock is on the floor before he can think, has dropped his head, has folded at the knees. His hands reach out, reach down. They pause a little—
And it was too late, too late to back away, to slow down, to tuck the feelings back behind the wanting and the wanting behind whatever control he could muster because he could muster no control at all, with Sherlock’s fingers spread, grasping, across his arse, with Sherlock’s cock hot and hard against his own, with Sherlock’s mouth opening and his tongue questing, there was no control, there was no stopping.
The fury in John’s voice followed him as he skidded across the pavement, but he would deal with that later. He could hear the sounds of running footsteps receding. Running men can’t shoot straight, the gunman was occupied, so Sherlock tore down the street and around the corner—
“Logical. They wrote that for you too. You know when logic isn’t doing the job but you cling to it anyway.”
Sherlock pulls away, with difficulty. He cannot go far, though, cannot tear himself further away than to rest his head on John’s. There is one more thing he needs to know.
- so with his last shred of coherency, he reaches down and takes Sherlock’s slippery prick in his hand - it’s an awkward angle but he twists his wrist and gets his fingers wrapped around the underside and it doesn't matter at all because Sherlock practically levitates the moment John touches him and three strokes later he’s coming wildly and sucking hard and watching him John is seized by his own orgasm, locked knees shaking as he comes and comes and comes.
Posted the day before the airing of The Final Problem and the subsequent deaths of most of the fandom. If you wish to bring me back to life, comments work on fic writers in much the same way that clapping works on fairies.
“Don’t what? Don’t like girls?” Clara laughed, not very gently. “You’ve got an eye for the lads, Johnny, which you think is a big secret, but I think I still have a thing or two you might enjoy.” And she took his hand and pressed it to her breast, licking back into his mouth at the same time.
.  There were too many traps here, too many ways he could go wrong. Lately he’d been feeling like every step he took was a misstep, and this after having been so careful for so long.
For four seconds, five, he stared at Sherlock with his eyes wide and his jaw slack. Then the air surged back into his lungs. “I love you. I love you. I love you. I, I did want to say it. I always wanted to say it. I would have chosen a better moment, that’s all. I love you.”
“What.” If John looked up, he would reveal everything. Instead, he revealed everything by not looking up.
, but that’s how she feels: boneless and soft, petted and spoiled. She laughs a little at herself, for feeling like this, for
(And Sherlock would shrink a little when he did, was already shriveling at the thought. It hurt, that John would stop, and the ache that he felt was not between his legs.)
from Sherlock’s touch that that’s what she was doing...but even then she only smiled sheepishly and made the excuse that she was pre-menstrual and her breasts were sensitive, and Sherlock was relaxed enough not to question it, even though John had had her period the week before.
He is relieved when John quietly gets up and goes to bed. He’s not sure how long he could have held back, in spite of everything.
The receding stress makes him snippy. “Of course that’s what this is. We’re sitting, we’re talking. What else would it be?”
“I want you to go to the window very, very quietly, and tell me if the woman with the feather in her hat is still outside the flat across the street.”
Sherlock met John’s invasion with eager acquiescence, opening far wider than was comfortable—or possibly even attractive— in his eagerness to admit him, to surrender his whole mouth to John, to whatever John might wish to do with it.
storm away, John was left at the bar wondering dispassionately if this time he’d finally burned that bridge.
“Innocent?” Here John does raise his head. Because he knows what Sherlock means, and he’s clearly lost this argument, but this is one point he isn’t going to concede. “

He placed both his hands flat on the table, and smiled at the man, whose words stuttered to a halt. John said, “You are a complete and utter tosser, and you’re talking shite, and it’s fucking offensive.”
uncomfortable, and John could be distracted by the taste of a long-desired mouth or the feel of smooth skin for a while, but his cock was full and hard and he
When this real John slides his pants off, the relief is overwhelming. With the briefest glance for permission (John's wide-eyed nod) Sherlock takes John’s cock – heavy and filling and already wet, from the movement of Sherlock’s eyes over his body – in both hands. His sigh is almost a sob as he lavishes John’s prick with caresses, curling long fingers around it, filling his whole huge hand with it.
“Me too. Me too. I didn’t say. I love you, too. I know I’m blurting this and doing it all wrong, but I love you too.”
After that, it was...well. John was drunk and conflicted, and not able to do much more than try to keep up. Clara was persistent in her efforts, though, and strident in seeking her pleasure. She got herself off on John’s fingers and John’s cock while John tried valiantly to uphold his end of the proceedings.
And suddenly Sherlock cannot bear this. There are a thousand ways for this to end in disaster, even if John meant it, even if John has the first clue - unlikely - what he is actually sorry for. Sherlock cannot just sit and wait to see what John will say next, not if he wants to maintain his own...he rejects the word
Later, James came to see him in the hospital. He stood erect at John’s bedside, and spoke to him. He was...
John found his own voice with some difficulty. “I—yes, sir.” He cleared his throat and moved towards the barracks. “Good night, sir.”
And now Sherlock’s whole body began  to quiver and rock, pressing into John’s touch as it moved from side to side.  John could see the tremor in her thighs. She knew Sherlock was feeling this pleasure through her whole body, and it was
Sherlock only hums absently and says nothing, and they get to Baker Street without further discussion.
James met his eye, then looked away for a long moment. When he drew his gaze back up to John’s, his answer was written in his face. He said it anyway. “I’ll be here a long while yet, Watson.”
“Well?” Greg smiled blandly. “Happens to us all. You’ll hardly remember it tomorrow. What’s the problem?”
Sherlock was still high on her own plateau, still pliant and ready, but focused now on John. With a twist of her wrist she withdrew her hand from where it cupped John’s mound and grasped her lover’s hips instead, raising her to the bed.
and then fingers close again on her nipple and all the pleasure coalesces in her belly before flying apart in all directions, supernova.
Sherlock’s smile was small and positively radiant. “The moment you chose was perfect,” he said. And then he said, “John,” and kissed him.
Neck, shoulders, arms. Back to shoulders, down the sides of her torso, smoothing over breasts and belly, pressing sides, hips, thighs. Hands hooking under knees, drawing them up and apart, letting them fall to the sides.
After several long minutes, John blinks out of his reverie and looks at Sherlock with something like horror. Sherlock prepares himself to deal with the next wrong conclusion, then next evidence that John has not understood him at all.
Sherlock has arranged the ties ahead of time. John lies down on the bed, and allows Sherlock to grasp her arms, to bring them over her head, to tie one wrist to the other, until both are secured to the bed. The hours spent on the Internet have been fruitful, apparently, because the knots are swiftly tied, neither too tight nor too loose, and hold firm when John tests them. She’s in it now. Just as well there are ropes there to keep her from backing out.
The murderer—a talker, as Sherlock had surmised, and less intelligent than he had thought—spoke. “Pity. I had the right knife all picked out, just perfect for that flawless skin…” Taunting. “I’d have let you watch, too. He’s
He tells himself he does not think of John’s socked feet resting on the edge of his armchair, the wrinkles in them as the toes curled and wriggled beside his leg. That was an anomaly. He still does not dare even to glance at the deductions that came from John’s warm feet in socks, so close. John always wears shoes, has always worn shoes in Baker Street; not Before, but always Since. (It is just as well, since they tell him so much about what John tries to keep hidden.)
and John fell back again onto the door, unable to get a full breath or support his own weight unaided.
, but then their bodies straightened and their arms wrapped round to pull each other close, and their chests met, and their bellies, and
The orgasm that was rising within her on the heels of her last climax was not merely strong, it was massive. It would overwhelm her if she let it happen;
his old smile, and Sherlock’s mouth twitches in response, and in another moment the gravity in the room has vanished and they are laughing.
you, Sherlock. When I belted that prick – you think I couldn’t see you? You can’t hide from me, Sherlock. Not anymore. I’m not going to let you.”
And not because he’s making amends for anything, either. It’s more…willing than that. As if the trappings of home and the care of their bodies - the demands of the transport - are not, after all, a tedious chore but, perhaps, a pleasure.
or palm along the curve of his lower back, and feel just the start of where his spare lines softened, rounded. It felt as good as he always knew it would.
The man was abruptly lifted off him by a very angry John Watson, who gripped the man by both lapels and headed him in the face.
John positioned herself between Sherlock’s legs and reached both hands up to her jaw (Sherlock’s own wetness smeared on her face.
Sherlock loves John with his whole heart and his whole self. There is not a moment in the day when he does not wish to fling himself at John, to pet him or caress him, to squeeze his shoulder or snuffle through his hair. He wants it with the same abandon he felt as a child, as if years upon years worth of lessons have taught him nothing at all.
They share a small smile. This new knowledge should shake both their worlds but they find, here, that it just settles into place around them. Perhaps because it is, in the end, utterly unsurprising.
“I—” Sherlock blinked. “In fact, you said that none of it means anything at all.” He willed John to understand what he was asking.
At length, John stirs, and takes a long breath. “Sherlock,” he says. His voice is croaky. “Thank you.”
They sit for a moment, wide-eyed, staring straight in front of them, John’s head slightly lowered, Sherlock’s the barest bit raised. Sherlock hears John take a quick breath, and another, and marvels that he can hear him at all over the sound of his own pounding heart.
“John, I—” he begins, but no words come. He tries again. “That is, I—” But the words stick in his throat, struggle to remain unsaid. (Silence is a difficult habit to break, apparently.)
John looks up at Sherlock’s sound of disgust and follows his gaze across the green. Through the trees, he spots a gaggle of young men and his blogger’s mind presents him with words like
It is pleasanter, also, because Sherlock has tidied. Straightened the papers on the desk, gathered up the discarded dressing gowns from off the furniture, cleared away the half-hearted half-experiments from various surfaces, and put the coffee table back in front of the sofa.
John – given to analogy – thought of purring engines, warm and running smoothly, or old-fashioned radios whose tubes took time to thrum fully to life before the music would emerge, or campfires burned down low and hot. Sherlock’s arousal smouldered and glowed like embers. It would burn on for some time now with very little stoking.
Sherlock was letting him know what he wanted, Sherlock was letting him know what he needed from John.
John licked her lips with the tip of her tongue, and left her tongue resting there, on her lower lip, just the tip. This she drew up the centre line of Sherlock’s parted vulva, to the pulsing tip, and then again, and again. A slow kitten lick up the seam, then a firm press, tip of tongue to tip of clit.
Having made the decision—had he?—to sleep with his sister’s fiancée ahead of their wedding and his deployment, he was dimly determined to go through with it, and make a proper job of it.
The look on his face was already Sherlock laid bare; he could feel it in his slackening jaw and his wide eyes. But John was asking, and Sherlock was beyond refusing, even this.
Eventually he would have to wave John off on dates with women who were better at this sort of thing than Sherlock was, even if they could not offer him all of the
At this, though, John stilled, the hand around Sherlock’s cock just gripping steadily, the fingers up his arse no longer twisting and thrusting, just barely stroking, as John regarded him steadily. His eyes were still dark, but narrowed.
With each other, it is different. Everything is different. But one does not easily overcome a lifetime of reticence. Of isolation.
Next came John’s fingertips hovering at the waist of Sherlock’s trousers at the small of his back, where his shirt was tucked in, plucking at the fabric, but not pulling.
Souls it may have been, but with this flowering of feeling, something in John’s body was also blossoming. He barely noticed it in the din of
The tremors in her body grew stronger, progressed to deep, shuddering spasms that shook her whole frame. The pleasure radiated from deep within her belly, spreading outwards in wave after cresting wave, mounting, mounting -
He slid down the door and came to rest on his knees, taking Sherlock’s erect penis into his mouth on the way down, in one smooth motion, and felt the slide of him across his tongue with something like relief. He closed his eyes and let out a grateful breath into the warm, musky hair of Sherlock’s groin.
His doubts were both eased and increased when he became aware of Sherlock’s warm, broad hand gently stroking his back, and his soft mouth pressing kisses to his temple.
Sherlock turns, then, rolls over in his arms to face him. It dislodges his hand from Sherlock’s erection but it is worth it to see his open, shining face. “Yes, John. Yes, all of it.”
“Do kindly stop repeating everything I say. Obviously you feel it would have made some difference if I’d known – or perhaps if you’d known I didn’t know. Which one is it?" Rapid-fire talk, sarcasm sparking with every gesture, every eye roll. John has always been vulnerable to this kind of attack, and Sherlock deploys it without mercy. "Well? Something you would have done differently? Or do you think the information would have altered anything for me? I am lacking sufficient data to deduce what
Sherlock can feel John’s eyes on him, for all that he keeps his own down, looks only at his fingers as they loosen the laces of his oxfords. He uses his toes to slide them off his heels, letting them fall to the floor with a
“Sherlock? Jesus, Sherlock, what is it, are you all right? Are you hurt? Christ, Sherlock, say something.”
“Liar,” John shoots back. His emotional moment has passed and he’s all fury and righteousness again, gripping Sherlock’s wrists and dragging him towards the bed. “You were wondering if I don’t think you’re a proper man because I fuck you, because you take my cock up your arse and you love it, and you’re worried that makes me think you’re less of a man.” His legs hit the bed and he clambers onto it without looking, kneeling up, still not releasing his hold on Sherlock’s arms. “And that’s bullshit, Sherlock, it’s bullshit. You are a
him, and not say the treacherous little words that always threatened to spill out of his mouth at any time, willy nilly, even at the breakfast table?
Sherlock, often embarrassed by his noises, even the small ones, makes no attempt to stifle them today, but stretches his spine even further, inviting touch, demanding it.
(He saved up his deductions, hoarded them, adjusted them with infinite care, not allowing the whole picture to emerge until he was sure he had every detail perfect. Until he
They rock together. Sherlock rounds his spine, chasing depth, and John presses his hips back, straining closer with every heave of their bodies. If he pulls John close enough perhaps they will absorb each other, perhaps they will fuse, flesh and gristle, and finally be wholly given to one another. Surely, if they have the courage for this, that final crackling meld must be almost an afterthought.
But he could feel the corners of his mouth twisting, and refused to consider what his eyes might be betraying.
“—and you’re sorry.” Gentle again, Sherlock twists his fingers as he talks. “You’re sorry for thinking it, aren’t you John?” Twists and curls.
. They were sure it was going to happen before he actually shipped out. He couldn’t really mean it, they thought.
...until Sherlock has to be quick to keep her fingertips on neutral skin, as John sidles and wriggles and tries to get a little further under her hands, but Sherlock is always faster, stays away while John
Sherlock’s breath sped up, and he felt his eyes go wide. He had no power whatsoever to school his expression.
“John.” Sherlock places one hand on John’s shoulder, dips his head, seeking eye contact. But John closes his eyes, looks away. The glimmer on his lashes might just be the lamplight. “It’s all right.”
He sees John draw another breath to speak, and if he lets John derail him it will be too easy to stay derailed and never say these words at all, these words that
. I want to be kind to witnesses and I want to save lives, there are a bunch of things I know how to do, that not everyone knows—”
We solve crimes! You blog about it! What could there possibly be in any of that that would in any way fit that bill?”
There was no way John hadn’t felt Sherlock’s body tense. There was no way, if he looked at his face, that John could avoid seeing Sherlock’s distress. He would look, and he would see, and he would stop.
, when at last the deft hands circled and scrolled and scratched. Worth it, for certain, when those same fingers dipped below the waistband of his trousers.
When Sherlock raises his hand to John’s face, it is allowed to rest there, and his fingers to travel over the lines around John’s mouth, around his eyes. He presses John’s jaw and John’s mouth opens, and it is allowed and it is so, so...
“Yeah, I was a little distracted too.” They grinned at each other, and let another moment pass in silence.
It was some time before either of them spoke. John sat back on his heels and licked his own lips clean. He folded Sherlock's pants back up over his penis and tugged his zipper up a little way, and Sherlock lowered himself, stiffly, to the floor. They sat side by side, shoulder to shoulder, leaning on the door and staring blindly at the windows, while their breathing and heartbeats slowed and steadied.
There didn’t seem to be much else to say, and James was never one to force words when there weren’t any. In another moment, he would leave, and that would be all.
And Sherlock took his surrender with both hands curled around John's shoulders, and moved so that one thigh was pressed to John’s erection, and John moaned, John
The next moment, John had gathered both orbs of his generous buttocks into hands that ought to have been too small to hold them but
John almost looked up at the hesitation in his voice, but caught himself in time. “Dunno,” he said, and then he actually considered the question. His first reaction was
He was no larger than he’d ever been but when Sherlock took a breath there wasn’t enough air because John Watson was suddenly taking up all of the space in the room.
John did not quite shout at Sherlock, but it was a near thing. “I stop you, every time. I don’t want to stop you. I want to let you touch me, but I can’t...I can’t stop myself from stopping you. I wish I somehow wasn’t
His eyes are closed. His mouth, John notices because he suddenly finds himself staring at it, unable to look away, is open.
Sherlock is silent for a beat. Then he takes the hand John has pressed against his chest and moves it down his torso. With a gasp, John catches his intent just as he settles John’s hand down on the front of his trousers. His, um, position is quite clear.
Sherlock’s hand stayed his neck, steadfast. “I do, I do want. I want to kiss you, and I want to touch you, and I want you to stop sending me away.” He closed his eyes and let his forehead come to rest on John’s, brought his other hand up to rest just above the first, cupping the back of John’s head, cradling him like he was something of value.
“Nothing.” Suddenly, Sherlock wants his anger back. He grasps for the frayed edges of his rage but it eludes him. This is supposed to be about
John’s hands were everywhere. There was no way for Sherlock to follow the slick movements as one of John’s hands worked his straining cock and the other—how many fingers did he
. Sherlock already belonged to him in every other sense. He didn’t know about John, but for himself… “I—yes. You’ve already got everything else.”
John, who keeps himself buttoned and buckled and laced before Sherlock at all times and has done for years, is now sitting barefoot in his armchair, directly across from Sherlock.
John’s mouth has gone tight and grim, but he doesn't leave. Instead, he answers. “Yeah. It would. It would have made a bit of a difference in a few ways, yeah. I only, you know, got married. To–well. You know how well that worked out.”
Sherlock brought her other hand to John’s hip, and stroked upward, cupping John’s breast firmly and lifting from below. Her thumb and index finger encircled John’s nipple and traced, around and over.
Eventually he reached the conclusion that most kinds of touch, if bestowed by him, would be unwanted anyway.
“What did he mean? There was something. I’m missing something.” Sherlock always looked to John when he was out of his depth. He looked to him now. He waited, and when John said nothing, he asked, again, “What did he mean? John? Who did he mean?”
Fumbling, eager hands and panting, ravenous mouths. The fall of bodies, naked at last, onto the bed, the grasping of fingers.
you, and not daring to. I’ve been so afraid for so long, Sherlock. And I don’t look kindly on cowardice. So I had to ask.”
“Three repetitions? Really? This isn’t like you, Sherlock. You heard me. I. Want. You. Full stop. So you can stop pretending you were only pausing before finishing your sentence because this has been going on long enough and why should I wait for you to say it when I’ve been thinking it at full volume for ages? So if you do, in fact, want me as well, and you don’t just have some other idiotic task for me that you’re perfectly capable of doing yourself, then, I don’t know, blink twice and I’ll come over there.”
, she might die of exposure if that happens. On her side...no. Her breasts—which Sherlock thinks are
John’s right hand idly stroked the underside of Sherlock’s breast as she settled from her orgasm, staying well away from the nipple for now, and her left hand wove lightly through her pubic hair – keeping contact, but avoiding anything too intense.
After a moment, though, he realised that John had stopped, his mouth hovering mere millimetres away from his own. He met his eyes uncertainly. “John?”
It wouldn’t work, though. Not with John. His relentless demands for permission were surely something connected to the importance of consent; Sherlock had been able to figure that much out on his own. He required an explicit
But Greg, on top of not being stupid, was a detective, a competent one. While John and Sherlock resolutely avoided his eye, he was able to connect the dots. He began to smile.
“I need to see. I need to check if there’s something wrong with my perceptions, or if you really are – “ He can’t say this out loud. “If that’s just the way you are.”
, he wanted more, slid his hands around to grip Sherlock's arse and pull his body closer and his cock deeper, to lick and suck and taste, ignoring his watering eyes and the ache in his jaw, and he hadn't had anywhere near enough when the flesh between his lips swelled and stiffened even further and John found his mouth full of as much taste and heat and texture as he could want. He swallowed it down and sucked the last drops out, determined not to waste the chance to flood himself with Sherlock, Sherlock
John, with everything he’s lost, is the one who came. He brought it with him, in his two hands like a chalice, this one real thing, to offer it to Sherlock. He took down his own defenses, and waited.
“Good clean fun, you called it. And you’re right, this is quite enjoyable. I didn’t think you’d be quite this easily beaten, though.”
Sherlock.” One more long thrust, and John came, the last waves of Sherlock’s orgasm still flowing around his cock, and they kept their eyes open at the last, and gazed their fill.
And he smiled at her. Then he finally, finally silenced the voice in his head and gave Sarah two solid orgasms before she rolled off him, drowsy and sated.
It’s such fucking garbage.” John’s breath hitches, not quite a sob but close. He is glaring, looking downwards now, not meeting Sherlock’s eye.
They didn’t want him to go, his parents. They’d liked his last girlfriend, more than the rest. They’d hoped that she’d be the one who would shake him out of his crazy ideas. (“The army, John? For heaven’s sake,
James looked at him then, ready to laugh. When John only lifted his face and gazed back at him, the smile faded from his eyes.
Sherlock helped her down, in the end; Sherlock, who had carried her up to a towering, soaring orgasm, that John wasn’t even sure she could have, but she had it, she had it because Sherlock was there to carry her, to draw it out of her and then to catch her, to catch and hold her and carry her back to earth;
Heel of hand, slide of palm, dip of fingers, back and forth, back and forth. John adjusted the rock of her hips to the rhythm of Sherlock’s hand and ground down, seeking her pleasure. The smooth bedding slid against her thigh with every pass.
John’s chin tilts, tries to follow Sherlock’s mouth, but he stills when Sherlock speaks. Eyes closed, foreheads touching. “Yeah?”
When it was for sex, it was a conscious decision on his part to initiate and, in due course, to escalate, and while he took great care afterwards to provide the requisite cuddling and affirmation – and enjoyed it – it was always a relief when it was over, to know he’d conducted himself creditably.
“When I first came back, I thought...I wasn’t expecting—” He huffs a breath. “You surprised me. I wasn’t expecting your, your anger. I thought—I didn’t think. I had no idea you would be so affected.”
Her breath came out in a small gasp. If Sherlock liked the delicate, barely-there touches of tongue, John liked the firm strokes, wide and messy.
John stares at him from the doorway. He turns, looks over his shoulder, down the stairs—surely he won’t leave now? But no, he nods once and moves, step by careful step, back to his chair. Frowns.
“Mmmm.” But in spite of her languor, she could feel tiny darts of pleasure rippling through her, little silvery minnows flitting, nipple to clit. “Oh.” The little fishes leapt. “
It was all Sherlock needed. Her soft lips closed around John’s full clit, and the end of her tongue came to rest, barely, on the tip. John’s whole body snapped taut at the contact. Sherlock held her every nerve between her lips, kept them steady with the lightest touch of tongue, held them poised and trembling with anticipation.
and Sherlock’s anger has vanished, has gone, as if it never was, and the last of his walls has crumbled the the ground with hardly a sound.
. The size of it, the weight, the way it is rising under Sherlock’s hand and managing to stand straight upward despite the considerable pull of gravity on its impressive heft.
“I know, John.” Following John’s lead, Sherlock lets his frantic tone go still. “That is, I think I know.”
