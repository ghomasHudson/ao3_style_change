to go along with it!
And Cas’ personal favorite: “I've heard his eyes are black, is that true?”
Cas glares at her, crossing his arms over his chest. “I gave zero signs that I was interested in him.
,” Cas breathes, his heart dropping down into his gut. The photo has attracted lots of comments, sympathetic sentiments and offers of support, and Cas drags a hand down over his mouth. The photo had been posted recently, only a few days ago.
“We’ve been a little preoccupied,” Dean replies for all three of them. Charlie narrows her eyes, but decides not to dig any deeper. Instead, she claps her hands together once before dropping them to her hips.
. I just need you to be there to make sure I don’t run into big shit, like oh, I don’t know, a fuckin’
Keeping a close eye on the scene unfolding in front of them, Dean starts edging back toward the cornfields as Sam comes closer, herding Novak right along with him. Ketch has got Asmodeus by the collar and lands another solid punch that has Dean cringing in spite of himself as the two prisoners topple to the ground, dragging their mates awkwardly along in a tangle of limbs and chains.
Dean hates when Sam’s right.
you eat?”
Oddly enough, it actually isn’t that bad of a place to get lost for a while. He can feel the sun pleasantly warm on his back, the low hum of the folks around them at just enough of a buzz for him to take it in as background noise, but nothing more.
“Jesus, those smell good.”
--and he can’t afford to fuck up his first impression by missing it, no matter how understanding his new coach might have seemed over the phone.
“Oh. Perfect.” Cas nods to himself, then gets to his feet. “If you’ll excuse me, I have an entire wall to destroy.”
...I don’t know. I just want to make sure she’s good for you, just like you did when I first started talking to Eileen. Tell me what you like about her. Other than the fact that she can drink you under the table.”
“‘m pulling you down next to me,” Dean mumbles, leaning over and planting a kiss underneath Cas’ earlobe. He’s pretty sure it was meant to land on his cheek, but he grins and squeezes Dean’s hand in thanks.
beer, Cas, come on. You only go to your first Sox game once. Let’s go.”
“Jesus, that’s cold, guys,” Dean says, pouting.
“Same shit,” she says with a shrug, taking another sip of her drink. “Hey, what’ve you got third period, right before lunch?”
He grins. “So you
“Yeah, of course,” Sam mutters.
Cas coughs, choking on his beer, and presses a fist to his chest.
Cas picks up the pace, grinning at the anticipation and excitement on Dean’s face. Dean can tell that Cas is still focusing on him, though, and snaps his fingers. “Hey, I’m not the main attraction here--”
The man grins triumphantly, then resumes his extraction of Dean’s wallet; Dean’s hands clench into fists at his sides. The man flips open his wallet, and before grabbing the money and cards inside, he pulls out Dean’s driver’s license and studies it carefully.
would look peaceful while unconscious.
Zachariah is silent for a few seconds, considering Cas, who’s trying to make himself as small as possible in his chair. “If you don’t write this story, Novak,” he says, “then I’ll have no choice but to remove you from this staff.”
Dean wrinkles his nose as he seems to think of a new option for Castiel’s identity. “Dude, I have no idea why Sam let you in, but if you’re some kind of door-to-door salesman, we don’t need any knives or Bibles or encylc--”
do it, either.
“How’d you know?” Dean finally asks through gritted teeth, watching as Crowley digs into the bag and starts counting their money.
Dean is standing outside the dining hall, and Cas approaches him slowly. He’s listening to music, not really paying attention to anyone or anything around him, which gives Cas a chance to check out his body language, to see if he’s still pissed off. He’s not doing anything out of the ordinary, his posture still relaxed and casual, and before Cas knows it, Dean’s spotted him.
“Stop being a baby, Castiel,” Anna says. He can hear her rummaging around in the kitchen, trying to find something to make them for dinner. “You’re just exaggerating, I’m
“Take
Bobby had given them free reign of the boxes of old clothes in his bedroom to find new outfits, and Cas had taken full advantage, dressed in tan pants and a white button-up. He’d even managed to find himself a matching waistcoat, a snug piece fitting him in all the right places, with a blue tie tucked behind it. He’s got his shirtsleeves rolled up, exposing strong forearms that have Dean unconsciously wetting his lips. Combine it all with the flush in his cheeks from the hot water, the way stray curls of his damp hair stick to his forehead—

, Billie had been the one to make it clear that she didn’t want their friendships and conversations to exist only to be recorded; if they were going to make a podcast, they needed to carve out time to just talk like regular friends, too.
why I got hit by a car or ended up lost three towns over or some shit? Because I’m sure that’ll go over
Cas wonders if he should make something up. Oh, the Red
Castiel worries his bottom lip with his teeth, considering Dean’s request. He already finds it difficult
This isn’t normal. He shouldn’t have to deal with this. No one should.

that’s
“Get it, Henriksen!” Benny hollers, smacking the aluminum bench repeatedly with his open palm, leading to even more cheers from the rest of the Wildwood team.
Promised land, his ass.
“Stop being such a goddamn snake to Cas. He’s done nothing wrong.”
the fish.”
“We’re taking a bit of a different route today,” Cas says as he stretches. He hasn’t stopped thinking about the kitchen interactions between the two of them from the other day, but he tries to shove those thoughts to the back of his mind. Dean hadn’t been looking for a romantic partner; he was looking for a running partner, and that was it. No use getting worked up over something that wouldn’t happen.
Dean grins as he looks down to lace his boots. “Fuck you.”
“I said he deserved someone who would make him happy,” he says slowly, “not that she’d be the one to do it.
Dean’s finally gotten used to the feeling of shackles around his ankles.
They bank fifteen miles, and then decide to take a break before heading back. Cas finds them a spot on the grass on the banks of the Charles, and leads Dean over to it. They sit down and spend a few minutes just listening to the goings-on around them, the Harvard crew coaches yelling directions, little kids running past them, and cars honking behind. Even though they’re right on the fringes of the city, Cas feels peaceful there, letting the little bits of nature permeate the regular city living he’s become so accustomed to.
’s today. And once this whole charade is over, we’ve got three different places for each of y’all. Cots already set up and everything. Sam, I hear Kansas City is positively lovely this time of year. Novak, there’s a cot in Topeka with your name on it.” His gaze slides over to Dean, lips curling into a grin that makes Dean sick to his stomach. “And you, Dean-o,” he says quietly, tipping his cap off with a single flick of his hand, eyeing him in a way that reminds Dean too much of an animal sizing up its prey, “you’ll be coming back with me. Now, ain’t that just the best news you ever heard?”
While he appreciates that she didn’t just come out and say that
He yanks open the tent’s flap and peers outside. The lanterns have slowed down, giving Cas a chance to catch up, and he stumbles toward the scene, trying to stuff his laces into his boots as he goes.
Dean knows Cas is concerned. Hell, he knows
Dean’s not completely sure about that, but he’d be lying if he didn’t appreciate the sentiment. “Guess we’ll see.” He looks back out toward the kids, then glances at Charlie with a small grin, nudging her with his elbow. “Thanks, Red.”
He can just imagine how his friends will react upon hearing this new development, and the thought makes him want to curl up in the corner and continue his life as a hermit. Finger hovering over his phone’s screen, Cas studies the photo until the screen goes dim. By then, he’s made up his mind, taps it back to life, and swipes over to Dean’s profile.
For some reason, that question earns him a look like he’s crazy. “Correct me if I’m wrong,” Cas says slowly, “but the last time I tried that, I ended up with a black eye before making it so that you couldn’t walk without limping for a full day.”
He had been careful to position Dean as close as possible to his cane, and Dean’s fingers reach out, searching until they brush against the white cane, when they maneuver to the top and wrap themselves around its black grip. Dean lets go of the rope but doesn’t walk ahead of Castiel as they make their way up the path and to the steps. As he ascends them, Castiel thinks he can see Dean mouthing the numbers--
Dean heads toward a free space and Cas follows him, trying to jog as smoothly as he can with the shin guards strapped to his legs. There’s no way not to move awkwardly in those things, though; he’s never been bothered by it before, but he’s also never been in the presence of Dean fucking Winchester before.
Dean rolls his eyes. "And counting. It's only Thursday, dude. He's still got three more days." He glances at Cas' door, where his and Gabe's cheesy, RA-made name tags are still stuck to the door. It's October, so his and Gabe's names are scrawled inside a hastily-colored jack-o-lantern in an effort to be festive.
“Make him
Dean chuckles. “Will you accept my dick?”
“Did he try to hurt you?”
Cas looks down at his phone and back up at Dean. “Every guidebook I’ve read says never to give your phone to strangers,” he says teasingly.
!” Kevin says, smacking Ash’s hand away as he tries to drunkenly caress his hair. Cas glances over at Dean, who’s grinning around the lip of his beer bottle, taking one long swig before setting it down on the table. He catches Cas looking at him and smirks, flashing him a
Dean stiffens a little at the question; Cas can feel Dean’s fingers grip his tighter. He lets out a rough, humorless laugh and leans back so that he’s lying down on the grass, staring up at the sky. “Seeing you would be nice. The real you, because I’m sure Sammy’s descriptions don’t do you justice.”
“Do I!”
“For us?”
“Ugh, finally,” Sam says when he finally catches a glimpse of him emerging from the trees. “Was starting to think you’d gotten nabbed and hauled back to Joliet.”
Judging from his Cheshire-cat grin, Dean recognizes Cas’ look all too well. He elbows Cas in the side and says, “I’ll order for ya,” leaving him to take in the rows of cakes, cookies, and breads that all smell freshly baked, even at nine at night.
It should be an insult. It should be something that would make Cas wants to head for the bathroom and talk himself down from throwing up, insisting on a new rooming assignment, or both. But something about the way Gabe says it, Cas can tell that being a “weirdo” is a good thing.
Chuck Shurley, the show’s host since its inception nearly thirty seasons ago, is waiting for Dean in the main foyer of the building, and Dean grins at him when he enters.
Winchester rotates his jaw a little and licks his dry, chapped lips before taking in everyone gathered around him. Cas is careful to avoid eye contact, opting instead to take a sudden interest in the dirt at his feet. Despite his current ragged appearance--and his notoriety throughout the Company--Cas can’t help but acknowledge Winchester’s...

,” he breathes.
“Yeah, yeah, but this was—hey, buddy, long time no see.”
They’re heading back to the ship when Dean smacks Cas lightly on the arm. “Hey,” he says, “you got time for one more stop before we head back?”
“Gentlemen!” he says as he straightens up, acting like the four of ‘em are long-lost friends. “So good of you to join us. You’ve been a right pain in the ass to track down, I’ll be honest, but now—” he smiles and shakes his head, taking long, balanced strides up to the three of them as they line up behind the desk, “—it’s just a good old family reunion now, ain’t it?”
The dim light of Hannah’s lamp is shining through the canvas of her tent despite the late hour, and Cas wonders why he’d expect anything else. Hannah is known to keep irregular hours, and even if someone needs help during one of the rare times she’s asleep, she’s quick to wake up and offer her help.
He can feel his stomach tense up with anxiety as the beginnings of claustrophobia start to set in, and for a second, he wonders why he even does this anymore. Sure, his optimism was high when he first started entering, but with every disappointed afternoon, his positive outlook got dimmer and dimmer. The odds of him getting picked over hundreds of other people are about the same as Katniss Everdeen’s sister’s were to participate in the Hunger Games, except somehow,
a sack of money in the car. No way we’re not gonna…” He spins on his heel to continue chewing Cas out for his sudden goody-two-shoes attitude when his eyes trail down to Cas’ hands—
“All right,” Dean says, secretly relieved to have an excuse to get his ass out of the room. “There’s a beer in the fridge for you too, Cas. Don’t have too much fun without me.”
"I laugh in the face of hills." Dean runs a hand through his hair, then adds, "Let's go."
Dean stares at him, biting down hard on the inside of his cheek to stop himself from running his mouth and making this whole situation ten times worse. His lack of response seems to just goad Heyerdahl further, and Dean stumbles as the warden’s hand shoots across the table to grip him hard by the jaw. “That was a question, sweetheart.”
The music starts to play around him, a faint instrumental version of the song that’ll run until they’re both in position and ready to start. He can hear shoes click-clacking on the stone, getting louder and louder as they approach him, and swallows nervously. Maybe it’s not too late to bail. This railing isn’t too high; he could hop it and just hurl himself into the fountain until they’ve got no choice but to leave him alone to drown his sorrows. He could just—
“I mean, I wouldn’t hate it.”
Dean bounces on the balls of his feet for a few seconds, then hands Cas his cane, kneels down, and runs his hand over the asphalt. His hand goes back and forth between the painted asphalt and the regular Boston street as he swipes; Cas wonders if they feel any different.
into the goddamn
Sam’s smirk gets wider and he chuckles. “Was there someone you were thinking of going to see, Dean? Someone who...oh, I don't know, bakes cakes and has a name that rhymes with ‘Schmastiel’?”
thing Cas had expected to come out of Dean’s mouth.
“That’s not the point—”
That he gets it.
Impulsively, Castiel closes his eyes and takes a few steps forward in the shower, holding his hands out to try and find his bottle of body wash. His fingers curl around the bottle quickly, and he flicks the top open and squirts some into his open palm. The familiar mint scent fills the air around him, and he lets out a sigh of relief before opening his eyes again.
“Dean, what Dad said that day, it isn’t—”
Cas really has to work on his poker face, because it’s clear that Dean can tell he isn’t impressed. In response, Dean flashes a crooked smile at him before pointing up. “Look.”
“Hey, sorry,” he says, using his leg to bar the dog from moving forward. “Rudy,
Dean had been exactly the snarky asshole Cas had been expecting, but he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t also noticed that Dean was kind. To the host, their waitress, the girls who asked him for a picture, and, if Cas is being honest, himself.
“No, no, I didn’t mean—last night, you just seemed—”
“Right, yes, of course,” Cas finally says. “I was hoping you had some art supplies.”
Castiel wrinkles his nose and stops short, causing Dean to stumble a little. “The author?” Castiel asks hesitantly.
Dean scoffs. “What, that?” He tosses the potato again, and then a few more times for good measure. “It’s not that hard, Cas. I’m sure you can do it with your eyes closed, too.”
“Cowboy?” Cas repeats skeptically.
“Hello, Dean,” he says, eyes bright and kind and
“We were trying to think of reasons why you’d drop out of the show, and I thought that maybe you’d met someone.” Dean’s got a
“Where are we?” Cas asks, and Dean can’t help it; he laughs.
“Jesus, you’re worse than Sam.”
Cas looks down at his feet and smiles before shaking his head. “Just wondering.”
” he repeats. “It’s tradition!”
She laughs. “
propose we do about it, smartass?”
They go back and forth between talking and just focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, letting the cheers and screams soundtrack their run. Aside from a short rest where Dean needed to grab some water and wait for his lightheadedness to pass, their run has been passing with relatively no incidents, and Cas is pleasantly surprised. He hasn’t accidentally run Dean into a tree, or inadvertently caused him to trip himself up in a pothole or anything. The roads have been well taken care of; they’re smooth and flat, not a rogue mailbox or recycling bin in sight.
Dean barks out a laugh and pushes himself away from the fridge. “Sam thought it’d be funny,” he says. “Hilarious. Obviously.”
Aaaaand that's it! I really, really hope you guys enjoy this; thanks for checking it out! <3
“You a friend of Sammy’s?” Dean asks, taking a sip of his beer.
Cas jerks at that, and rolls over to face Gabe. “I...what?” he asks, trying to keep his voice as unflustered as possible.
“What now?” Novak asks.
Judging by Dean’s nervous little smile and the way his skin flushes under the freckles brushed across the bridge of his nose (which, how the hell did Cas not notice those last night?), Cas said it just fine.
For a few seconds, Dean’s too stunned to react, but he recovers fast, grabbing Cas by the shoulder and whirling him back around to face them. “What the hell are you doing?”
The sound of their shoes tapping on the concrete floors mixes with Cas’ steady breathing, and Dean tries to calm himself down. They won’t get caught, they’re covering their tracks, they just need to get their asses outside and back to the fence.
A million and a half thanks to my artist,
Cas sucks in a tight breath through his teeth, then says, “I’m fine. Move a little closer to me, there’s a cur--” He’s jerked backward a little and turns around to see Dean standing still, arms folded across his chest, staring accusingly at Cas.
Dean smirks. "Kid's in my Intro to Humanities class. Turner hates him, but he makes that fuckin' class bearable."
Finally, Balthazar emerges from the bathroom, and Cas has to physically resist the urge to roll his eyes when he notices the monocle balanced precariously in front of his brother’s right eye.
to be sorry for, Cas, trust me,” he says, running a hand through his hair. Cas makes a mental note to do the same thing next time; he wants to know what Dean’s hair feels like. “Sammy’ll be home in a few minutes, and I don’t want him walkin’ in on us.” He glances around the open garage, then adds, “Or out, whatever.”
“You should do it, Dean,” Sam says, handing the phone back over to Benny before elbowing his older brother with a grin and a waggle of his eyebrows. “No experience necessary.”
So he does.
Cas is still half-asleep as he and Dean stand in line at the edge of the Common, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet in the chilly Boston morning. The stream of shuttle buses has been pretty consistent, but he and Dean have been waiting for well over an hour, and Cas is looking forward to a break from the cold, no matter how small it might be.
Castiel pauses, then shakes his head.
Cas swallows hard, a lifetime of report card comments of him being too quiet and snide remarks for him to speak up flooding back into his head. He doesn’t like drawing attention to himself, and if anyone’s comments on his voice are to be considered, he
Cas isn’t sure how obvious he makes it, but his heart jumps up into his throat at Sam’s comment. “Your brother is a special person,” he finally says.
Dean punches the END button on his phone and sets it back on the nightstand. He studies it for a few seconds, half expecting it to buzz to life, and for Cas to be on the other end, even though he knows that’s impossible. Finally, he allows himself a tiny shrug and mutters, “Could’ve been worse,” before burrowing back under the covers.
“Welcome to this week’s episode of
“I noticed.” Dean looks at Cas’ jeans for just a bit too long before glancing up back up at him. His lips quirk up in a half smile. “Have a good night, man.” He flashes Cas a quick wink and heads for the exit, leaving Cas to stare after him.
Dean reaches forward and tucks a strand of loose hair behind Lisa's ear, offering her a small smile and hoping the camera didn’t pick up the way his hand shook. “And the more I got to know you, the more right it felt. It was like, I don’t know, like I found something I’d been looking for, something I was honestly kind of doubting even existed. You gave me that, and I can never thank you enough for it.
Dean makes a noise of affirmation and Cas sucks in a breath through his teeth when he feels Dean nip gently at his earlobe. “Make a note, Diane,” Dean breathes, not trying to hide his enjoyment when he feels Cas shudder under his hands. Cas doesn’t waste anymore time; he swings his leg over Dean’s hips and situates himself on his lap, kissing him long and hard.
“Ah, but you
“Dean.”
“Most of us rotate through it. You didn’t expect a professional photographer to be takin’ your cheesy future Christmas cards, didja?” he asks with a lopsided smile.
“Okay, okay, let’s start recording,” Hannah says, throwing on her headphones and tapping the table with her palms. “Come on, guys, while it’s all fresh in our minds.”
Which is why he’s not at all ready when he feels Cas edge closer to him and bring his mouth close to his ear. “So I guess that makes you the trash of the thing,” he says, slow and loud to make sure Dean can hear him over the cheering now that Lin’s special guest has come out to stand next to him.
The man’s voice fades away as Dean pulls Cas onto the steps of the theatre next to the other winners so far. They welcome them excitedly, and Dean notices that the first winner of the day is still hugging her boyfriend, trying to compose herself. He grins and turns to Cas, who’s staring at him like he just grew a second head.
“They chipped?” He exposes his blood-stained teeth to Castiel, who stands there uncertainly.
“I’m not--you know what,” Dean says, more to himself than to Cas, “I need you to give me like, five minutes.” He swivels around in Cas's arms and gives him a quick, distracted kiss before pulling himself out of Cas's embrace and ushering him toward the door.
When the elevator stops just one floor after his, Cas wants to be annoyed, but when the heavy doors open to reveal Dean waiting there, typing quickly on his phone, his mood immediately shifts. Dean glances up before taking a few steps forward, then quickly does a double-take and stops short.
1. I'm not blind, and I don't know anyone who is. I did a lot of research to try and make everything as realistic as possible, so any inaccuracies are totally on me. Please let me know if there's something outright wrong or offensive, though, and I'll remove or fix it right away!
Dean chuckles. “Not that.” He opens the fridge, and Cas peeks over Dean’s shoulder to look inside. The fridge is divided almost perfectly in half, one side full of healthy foods--salads, chicken, eggs, a nice variety of fruits and vegetables--while the other is full of everything else--hamburger meat, hot dogs, mozzarella cheese, bacon.
“No,” Cas says the second they’ve all entered their Google Hangout. Hannah had sent out a group message earlier in the day with the idea that they should do a minisode devoted to Cas and Dean’s date, and Cas couldn’t put the kibosh on it fast enough.
and look nice today, Dean, please?”--and glances down at the folder in front of him again.
According to Dean, Fenway Park is actually one of the smallest ballparks in the country, but to Cas, it seems huge. Dean maneuvers them through the maze of concrete floors, souvenir booths, bars, and food stands until they’re standing in front of a short hallway that’ll lead them into the park and to their seats.
“Shhh,” Dean murmurs, a perfect semblance of calm as he eases the bolt cutters more firmly against the kid’s throat. He glances down at the hunk of metal in his hands, then his eyes flick back up to the guard. “You got keys?”
game--the Red Sox are losing 7-3 by the time the seventh inning rolls around--but Cas is still having fun. Fenway’s beers are overpriced and nothing special, and Cas tries to refuse them more than once, but Dean insists that they’re all part of the experience, to go along with Fenway Franks, which, Cas has to admit, are worth the money, even if it’s just for the novelty alone.
The whole thing goes on for what seems like miles—go, then drop; go, then drop; go, then drop—until finally, Dean sees his brother stop and turn his entire body around to face back where they’d come. He’s silent for a few seconds, still as a board before throwing his arms up in the air. “Guess what, boys,” he says, smiling wide at them over his shoulder. He doesn’t wait for either of them to answer before continuing, “We’re clear!”
The man laughs, hopping over the bar and pulling Dean into a hug, laughing. He’s acting like this is some kind of long-overdue reunion, like he hasn’t seen Dean in years. “
out of it, sure, but there’s no way in hell he’s fucking
how much Ollie likes him. Like, ten minutes ago. In great detail.”
“Let’s kick it in the ass,” he murmurs.
This time, Charlie’s eyes widen, and if Cas had any doubts that he had come to the wrong comic shop, they were gone now. “Winchester?”
“Ah, shit,” he breathes. He glances at his plate, then at Cas, before dropping the fry that was in his hand and heading over to the girls. Cas watches as he rests his hands on the arms of one of the girls who’s started tearing up, rubbing them comfortingly and talking quietly to her. She looks like she’s trying to pull herself together, but is failing miserably, so Dean envelops her in a hug and almost as if by instinct, she buries her face in his shoulder.
“A little warning would’ve been nice.”
Dean purses his lips and gazes far out in the general direction of where the ship is docked. “I know the captain. I think he’ll wait for us,” he says with a wink, and motions for Cas to follow him, but Cas stops short.
Cas approaches hesitantly, trying to determine what Dean needs more of right now, comfort or space.
Cas opens his mouth to respond, but by the time he manages to get his shit together enough to figure out what to say, Dean’s sidestepped him and is heading down the hall.
Dean raises a hand—to cheer or get them off the fucking stage as cops begin to infiltrate the crowd and swarm Crowley, he's not sure—but it’s only up for a second before he feels someone tug it down and behind his back.
“We can go out for all the bacon you want on April 19,” Cas says. “Promise. Now, come on. Twenty m
The woman raises her eyebrows, giving Cas the same look Dean did back at the dorm, and Cas can feel himself start to blush again. "Is that so?"
“I'd hate to be him,” Balthazar says with a sigh. “The shit that he's got coming for him, god
“Wanna hear something funny?”
“You boys have been busy, haven’t you?” she asks, arms wrapped around Sam’s waist. Dean closes the gap between them and hugs Jessica hard, kissing the top of her head. She laughs under his embrace, patting him on the back until he lets her go.
"Stubborn," Cas interrupts, and Sam smirks.
“Benny’s a good dude,” he says. “Hope he finds someone.”
“Yes.”
,” Dean answers, waggling his eyebrows behind his glasses. “In the mood for something creepy.” Cas has only been sitting for a few seconds when Dean gets to his feet, prompting Jack to lumber to his, as well.
“You’re out late.” She keeps her eyes on her work, sorting some bandages and checking on supplies.
Ed flips her off, but Cas can tell that it’s affectionate. He wonders how often he and Harry have been coming to this store, if they know Dean. “We’re gonna go get donuts,” he says, tossing the hoodie back over the counter.
Dean watches the crinkles appear around Cas’ eyes as he smiles, and tries to ignore the way his cheeks go hot when he feels Cas reach down and entwine their fingers together. “Yes,” he says. “Let’s.”
Gabe laughs as Balthazar and Raphael start bickering all over again, which is when Cas starts to let his eyes and mind wander. He’s never been in the main tent since arriving at Station 1237, and doesn’t understand why his fellow soldiers aren’t more unsettled at being there. Of course, if Cas hadn’t known its reputation beforehand, he would’ve been relatively unfazed--the main tent is, well, just a normal tent, thick canvas walls and roof with a couple of wooden chairs and a table, as well as some candles and a few gas lanterns for nighttime use, but somehow it seems more menacing. Cas breathes slowly against the uncomfortable knot of anxiety forming in the pit of his stomach as he rubs his arms, trying to get some warmth. His pajamas are too thin for the cold, and he’s already regretting his decision of not changing first.
There’s a pause—there’s always a pause—before Dean takes a step to the side and gestures with both hands to the sweet, caring, funny, awkward, goddamn stunning form of his boyfriend—and Jesus Christ does
“Uh—”
Castiel sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose between two fingers and trying to well up the last remaining fragments of resistance he knows are hidden somewhere in his mind. “Fine,” he finally says.
“Less than fifty,” he answers, and flashes Dean a quick little smirk that sets Dean’s guts alight.
“When my folks died.” Dean’s answer is so blunt, Castiel feels like he’s been punched in the face. “Car crash,” Dean continues before Castiel can respond. “About five or so years ago, during that really shitty winter with the ice storm that knocked out the power for a week. It’s how we got the house, basically.”
ridiculously good-looking.”
“Son of a
right now, for all we know.”
Cas pauses, and, much to his surprise, realizes that he actually does.
Cas can’t figure out why, but Dean is off.
with such venom that Cas would’ve taken a step back had he been standing. “I was supposed to have people watching me, making sure I didn’t get ambushed. That obviously went great.” He looks away and takes a breath. “Your pals snuck up on me, nearly bashed my goddamn head in, dragged me to your five-star camp, and voila, here we are.”
“It wasn’t—”
When that train’d shown up, he hadn’t been able to believe their luck; in retrospect, he shouldn’t have.
Cas stares at the door for a few seconds, unsure of what to do next. The door doesn’t have a lock; he could--he
different from what you were picturing.”
He’s almost disappointed when Winchester doesn’t come up with another comeback. Despite the fact that it came paired with verbal abuse, it had been nice to hear his voice.
to when he thinks back to his acidic tones in each and every one of their conversations, the way Dean had tried to be at least half-decent, but Cas had already made up his mind, refusing to hear anything contrary to the picture of Dean he’d created in his head.
you, Dean,” Cas says, watching Dean poke a fork hesitantly at a small salad Cas had put together. An hour--and ten different failed recipe suggestions later--Cas has finally convinced Dean to try a kale salad with chicken, chopped apples, and almonds. Dean had scrutinized the dish like a suspicious toddler, his eyes narrow and distrusting, before Cas had finally convinced him to take a bite.
"Thanks," he says.
, but he keeps it to himself.
“My place, half an hour.” She hangs up, and Cas stares down at his phone. Dean had dropped out? Why would he drop out of a show that would guarantee him more of his three favorite things, sex, booze, and screen time?
Cas keeps his eyes down as they walk—if he avoids eye contact, they’ll leave him alone; it’s the same tactic he uses to avoid the people who work at mall kiosks—but of course, the split second he glances up, he just has to catch the gaze of the redheaded woman—the nametag pinned to her shirt is covered in stickers and reads “Charlie”—in front of the station they’re passing.
. “Thank you,” he manages to get out, giving Dean a closed-lipped smile before bringing his bowl to the sink. “I appreciate it.”
He shakes his head and orders another beer.
Cas’ own suit is plain black. It still smells like church—the last time he wore it was for their grandmother’s funeral three years ago. When he first pulled it out of his suitcase, Balthazar had asked him if he was paying respects to the death of his career.
He’s fucked.
Jess laughs and pockets the money, then gets to her feet and starts tugging on her boots. “It was only a matter of time,” she says, “and come on, Dean, you can’t say you’re not happy about Castiel saying yes.”
alert. At least he’s trying to work with him here.
, you’re fine. You’ve been off all week, dude, and I’m not the only one who’s noticed.”
“I brought a bunch of different kinds of healthy foods, food that’ll help give you energy and make it easier to run. I figured we could go through them and figure out what you like and don’t like, and go from there. Maybe put together some meals for the week.”
“He’s a human, Castiel, not a lab experiment. So no, you don’t need a
“Thanks, doll,” Gabe says, smiling widely as he pulls out a chair and sits down.
Cas looks up from his phone, his eyes wide. “It’s Dean. He, uh, he wants to get dinner tonight.”
Alistair bristles at the laid-back nature of Winchester’s voice, but doesn’t physically respond with another punch or a slap. “You were much easier to capture than I’d anticipated, boy.”
The door shuts behind her, and as Dean shoves his supplies into his bag, he makes a note to
Dean barks out a laugh at the suggestion. "My dad would never go for that."
. “Putting yourself out there might do you some good.”
, and it had just taken Dean until now to figure that out.
He and Dean make the turn smoothly, and Dean lets out a little yelp of excitement. “
About forty-five minutes into the episode, Cas is struck by something they’d all passed over earlier.
Anna is telling him about it. “But—”
Dean quirks an eyebrow at that. “We’re both shitty at this? Match made in heaven, then.”
Cas watches helplessly as the Colt takes on the mugger, punching and kicking and dodging. There’s a terrifying moment when he shoves the Colt backward hard, and he stumbles over Cas’ overturned box of personal belongings.
Cas looks up and his jaw nearly drops at the goddamn adonis leaning against the fence in front of him. He’s got his arms folded across his chest, legs crossed at the ankles, looking at Cas curiously. There’s so much of him to take in, but the first thing Cas is drawn to are his eyes. Cas can’t tell what color they are from the shade provided by the brim of his cap--maybe green--but they look friendly and warm. He smiles at Cas, and the skin around his eyes crinkles with the motion.
"What's your name?" Dean asks. "Sorry, I zoned out during that 'get to know your floor' icebreaker shit from the first week."
He’s been a copywriter for MedicALL since he graduated from college after spending a semester there as a marketing intern. He’d been so grateful they actually wanted to
, mind you—that we could use a little more starpower on. Mayoral race is really heating up. You boys interested in reliving your glory days?”
Cas’ breath catches in his throat. “Jesus.”
They keep a steady pace through the first few miles, letting the cheers and music spur them on whenever they started to lose some stamina. About seven miles in, Cas notices a Dairy Queen, and laughs to himself as he pictures him and Dean inhaling Reese’s peanut butter cup Blizzards.
“Why?”
Cas hesitates. “I wouldn’t say I’m a
One of Cas’ coping mechanisms for when he’s particularly stressed is reality TV. It started in college, with episodes of
“You could finish listening to it, if you want,” Cas says. “I can wait. Get things ready in the kitchen and everyt--”
Cas smiles, but Dean can tell he’s nervous; he’s glancing distractedly over Dean’s shoulder into the sea of people chatting and eating and schmoozing, waiting to hear them perform. Dean follows Cas’ gaze, then turns around and rests his hands on Cas’ shoulders. He leans in close, bringing his mouth right up to Cas’ ear.
Dean looks at him, unamused. “Listen, Cas, you can
“Come and get us, coppers!” Garth yells delightedly, and Dean’s eyes go wide.
Cas barks out a laugh. “Something from before you met me.”
“Of course.”
“I’d never be able to prove it. Hell, dunno if I’d even
“Are you with the ship?”
Cas tries to shove any thoughts of Dean Winchester to the back of his mind as he unlocks the front door of the three-decker he lives in and climbs the stairs to the third floor. He takes care to avoid the rotted-out step near the second floor landing, jams his shoulder against the door to force it open, and tosses his keys and messenger bag onto the tiny kitchen table before dropping onto the couch and turning on the TV.
Lisa smiles at him and takes his hand. “One more thing,” she says, leading him out of the studio toward a small vintage theatre a few blocks away. The marquee is framed with bright blinking bulbs and DEAN + LISA = TRUE LOVE in thick black lettering, and Lisa plants a kiss on Dean’s cheek when they enter.
Dean nods and points his socked foot toward the stove. “Under there. How many of these should I cut?”
. So he only shares this place with people he’s close to? It’s petty and stupid, but if Dean liked Cas enough to share this place, why the hell wouldn’t he share a goddamn elevator with him? Normally, you’d share an elevator with someone before you show them a secret fucking beach, but apparently nothing about Dean is normal.
As if to prove his friend’s point, the man holding Cas pulls the gun away and then smacks it hard across Cas’ face. Cas cries out in pain as the metal stings his skin, cringing when it’s placed back against his temple. He can see Dean stiffen, but he doesn’t try anything else, to Cas’ secret relief.
stranded here,” he mutters, shaking his head before stalking off, leaving Cas to trail a few feet behind him.
"That's the third time this
“Hello, Dean.” Cas jams his hands into his pockets, unsure of what to say. He doesn’t trust himself not to fuck things up again, so he stays silent.
Cas nods and clears his throat, his fingers tightening around the strap of the bag at his side. “I actually had a, um, a question for you.”
“Why lie to him?” one guy in a dark blue T-shirt asks, his deep southern drawl dripping slowly like maple syrup. He pops his bubble gum and taps the heels of his cleats against the cement dugout floor before looking lazily at Cas with a smirk. “He’ll figure it out soon enough.”
“Warn a guy, huh?” Dean huffs out, glaring at Sam before turning his attention back to the guard he’s got pinned.
Dean laughs once more. “Good to know.” He pauses, then adds, almost more to himself than Castiel, “This works. This’ll be fun. Thanks, Cas.”
The Winchesters’ street is much sleepier than Castiel remembers. Everything looks peaceful and perfect in the early morning, and Castiel feels like he’s been transported into a fairy tale as he drives down the freshly paved street, glancing every so often at the houses he passes, all wraparound porches, wicker chairs and perfectly manicured lawns.
Dean turns back around just in time to see Garth swinging the driver’s side door open and sliding out into the open air, balanced precariously on the edge of the door.
He’d thought—hoped—this feeling would go away the more time he’d spent with Cas, but it’s only getting stronger, and if Dean’s being completely honest, he has no idea what to do with that. He can spend some time figuring it out in the future, but for now, he just keeps drinking. It’s easier.
Despite their pleas, Dean stayed out of their show—”It’s your thing, Cas. I’d make it way too inside baseball”—but after Cas had caught him peeking around his book or laptop while they were watching the premiere, he’d convinced him to join them for their next watch party on Zoom.
“If I hadn’t left him,” Dean parrots, hoping to god he doesn’t sound as helpless as he feels. Judging by the look on Sam’s face, which has gone from authoritative to soft and hesitant, though, that whole effort’s been a resounding failure.
, Dean.”
Suddenly, the room erupts in a cacophony of claps and cheers and whoops as everyone in the audience gets to their feet. Dean stares out at them, the mood of the room having turned on a dime, and for a moment, he’s frozen. He glances back over his shoulder at Billie, who hasn’t missed a beat since their last duet. She nods, motioning with her head for him to hurry the hell up and start singing already.
episodes before our next recording can be considered ‘plans,’ but if they are, then, well, that.”
He changes quickly, pulls on his coat, and adds his scarf, gloves, and hat as he walks down the hall. The door to Dean’s room is open, and Dean is sprawled on his stomach on his bed, typing something furiously on his laptop. Cas knocks and Dean’s head immediately jerks up. He takes in Cas’ bundled figure and smirks.
Dean notices, and he’s about to press his brother for more information when Lisa and Ellen approach their table.
“Curb,” Castiel interrupts, “to your left.” He’d suddenly noticed that they’d swerved a little from their straightforward route, and Dean, walking on the inside of Castiel closest to the sidewalk, was about to trip over the edge of the curb. Dean stops and takes a few tentative steps to the right until Castiel gives him affirmation that he’s good, then grins to himself.
He beckons for Cas to get closer, leaning forward himself until he’s inches away from Cas’ ear. “Let’s give ‘em a show, huh?” Without waiting for a response, he brushes his lips against the bolt of Cas’ jaw before swinging himself around to Cas’ side of the table. He throws one arm across his shoulders and the other high in the air.
tonight?” he asks idly.
Novak shrugs. “If I knew, yes. We’ll find it, though.” With that, he pulls something out of his back pocket—a bandana, Dean realizes—and takes a few steps forward toward Dean, who takes just as many back.
Lisa shakes her head, leaning against Dean’s shoulder and gripping his upper arm gently. “They’re just like you,” she says, kissing his cheek. “Perfect.”
. He drops the hand onto his desk and tries to cover up the entire thing with a grin, and if Cas notices anything off, he doesn’t acknowledge it.
His friends are going to fucking kill him.
“That’s rude,” Cas breathes, reaching down to grab Dean’s hand. Dean cranes his neck to try and make contact with Cas’ lips again, and Cas moves himself up an inch or two at a time so that Dean has to sit up to actually reach him for another kiss.
He returns it without hesitation, tangling his fingers in her hair as he leans her back to deepen the kiss, and they stay that way, lost in the moment, until Jo throws a handful of peanuts their way.
They walk along in silence for a few minutes once Dean’s run out of stories, and Cas takes the time to lose himself in the ornate architecture of cathedrals, the boxy color of houses and shops, the openness of the city in general.
He’s never had a nickname before, but the more he thinks about it, the more he warms up to it. It’s such a simple word, just three little letters, but for some reason, it just works.
Castiel’s eyes go wide, and he gapes at his sister. “Excuse me?” He doesn’t know how to react to this; how can he be expected to guide someone when he can’t even guide his goddamn self? He also doesn’t run competitively, and he sure as shit doesn’t run with other people. His mind flies through every excuse in the book to try and get himself out of this, but none of them sound daunting enough to convince Anna that he’s the
“Have you never been here?” Cas asks, nudging him as they approach Ansin and start to hear the faint notes of the college radio station getting closer.
!” Balthazar yelps delightedly. “Yes!” He pumps his fist just as a lost group of guests wanders into the theatre lobby. He beams at Cas. “Proud of you, sweetie,” he says with a wink before turning to help the guests.
“I think we should try those next,” he says, finding the sweet potatoes and placing them on the countertop. “They’re very good, and a little healthier for you than regular fries. They could be a good alternative for you.”
Dean winks at him and Cas drops his head down against Dean’s shoulder. “I didn’t mention it,” he says, “because I didn’t know if you wanted it to be public knowledge. You weren’t exactly straightforward about asking me out in the first place.”
“So why’d you leave?”
Cas just fits, so effortlessly that Dean’s got half a mind that this place hadn’t even been
He likes it when it helps him to see little glimpses of beauty out in the world that usually go unseen and under-appreciated by everyone else, like the dad covered in tattoos dancing his heart out to “Let it Go” with his young daughter on the main deck.
By the time the third round comes, though, Dean’s too far gone to care. They’re celebrating.
“Jesus,” Cas breathes, shaking his head again and running a hand through his hair before picking up the pace to catch up with his brothers.
The last date had been a group one, and only three men hadn’t been invited: Dean, Alastair, and Kevin. The only date left for the week is a one-on-one, meaning that two unlucky bastards would only have a few minutes at tomorrow night’s cocktail party to try and convince Lisa they’re worth keeping around.
Dean elbows him in the side and mutters, “He said ‘welcome,’ man,” with a disappointed shake of his head.
“You seemed to be a fan of Lisa’s.”
Dean bolts awake, startled and panting and half-hard, to the sound of an owl’s screech echoing through the night. His gaze darts over to Sam and Cas, who are both still sleeping, none the wiser to Dean and his batshit crazy subconscious.
“Fuck you.”
Dean is enraptured with the way Chris pours his entire heart into the thing, like this is the last time--ha,
Charlie clicks on Dean’s FOLLOWING list, and sure enough, eleven profiles pop up. His brother, a few of his co-bachelors, a tattoo artist, a couple of chefs, and one Novakastiel.
Dean holds his hand out impatiently, and Castiel rolls his eyes. “Okay, then,” he mutters, placing the end of the rope into Dean’s waiting hand. He curls his fingers around it quickly, and Castiel does the same with his side.
“How many prisons are around here?” Dean murmurs, not taking his eyes off the working men who have become dots in the distance.
bachelor, just one of the contestants, but Cas would take what he could get at this point.
“Hmm?”
Cas was only trying to help.
come after you? Now that we’re, uh, a thing? Together.”
“No, just a question.”
it.” There’s another round of gunfire and a crash from behind them; due to what, Dean’s not sure, but he’s also got no interest in finding out.
“You got Dean to like a cat named
and leave her all the love!
The next day, Dean’s focused on two things: keeping that dream a goddamn secret, and making sure Cas knows he’s sorry. It’s tough, him admitting he was wrong, but it’s better than the alternative, and that’s what’s keeping him going as they start toward wherever Sam’s got them heading towards next.
“I’m sure you can,” he says, “but we probably have to get back to the mansion now, huh? I know the other guys are dyin’ to spend some time with you.”
"Swear to God. Look."
Dean looks up and flashes Cas a tired grin as he enters the kitchen. “Morning.”
“It’s cool. I want one, where’d you get it?”
“I haven’t heard anything from him or Sam requesting that the rest of your sessions be canceled,” Anna says simply. “Have you?”
Cas stares at him. “Seriously, Dean. I’ve got so many layers on, I’m actually a little warm.”
“Mhmm.” Castiel glances down and watches as Dean’s fingers play with the knotted rope in his hand. “I don’t even remember why running stayed in my head; I hated it when I was younger. But there were a shit-ton of things he kept begging me to try out, and that was the one that stuck--” he shrugs “--and here we are. Well, kinda.”
Cas worries his lower lip between his teeth and keeps his eyes on his computer screen, trying not to give anything away. “Thank you,” he says. “I…’m proud of it.”
“Glad you catch me at all, man.”
Sam offers him a small smile. “He’s still here.”
“A little something called ‘Nunya,’” Charlie says brightly, taking another sip. “It’s imported.”
“Well, my sympathies. And no sirs in this house,” Bobby says, shaking his head. “Cas, is it?” Without waiting for an answer, Bobby rummages around in a small closet and pulls out a threadbare towel, which he tosses over to Cas. “Shower’s down the hall, out the door on the right and into the backyard. Go and get yourself cleaned up while I catch up with these two.”
Cas gapes at her silently, unsure of how to respond, then unwraps his own burrito with a huff. “That’s not the current crisis.”
Dean’s eyes are bright with excitement, and he shrugs. “Turns out Christmas fucking sucks when you have to spend it without your best friend.”
“Clearly,” Cas murmurs, not loud enough for her to hear him. He stumbles forward as someone else slaps him between the shoulderblades, and looks over his shoulder to see one of the guys hoisting his bag with his catcher’s gear over one shoulder.
“I, Dean--” Cas stammers, trying and failing to dig his heels into the floor as Dean pushes him.
Dean reemerges from the bathroom with an empty bladder and a plan to show Cas exactly how much he likes him, how glad he’s been—since day one, if he’s being completely honest with himself—that they’d ended up stuck together. It involves more kissing than lovesick confessions—at least for now—but it’s a clear plan, and Dean’s ready.
Sam nods. “Sure was.”
It’s a ballsy move, ballsier than he’d been anticipating, but Cas is showing no signs of calling HR on his ass, so he considers it a win. He looks down at the art supplies in his arms and offers up one last smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Are you nervous?” she asks.
Cas' quote in his vows is from Jonathan Safran Foer!
Dean is silent for the next few minutes, pondering the menu before their waitress arrives to take their orders. He decides on a bacon cheeseburger—extra bacon, extra cheese, extra fries—and Cas wrinkles his nose when Dean hands the menu back to the waitress with a crooked grin.
“There are no cameras here,” he says finally. “And you’re a good guy. Knew you wouldn’t rat me out.” He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, as if he’s trying to decide if he should continue, before mumbling, “If I’d met you here, I’d take you out.” He pauses once more, then finishes with an uncertain, “Just wanted to pretend.”
The guys clap and whoop, a few of them jumping up and down to get themselves psyched.
Cas had opted not to go into detail about his interaction with Dean the other night; all his friends care about is the fact that he said yes, so that’s all he tells them. Instead of just letting him endure this humiliation in peace, though, they’ve got something else in mind.
Dean stares at Castiel and chews on his biscotti slowly before swallowing and giving the man a crooked smile. “Wanna hear a funny story?” he asks. Castiel stays silent, looking at Dean expectantly, and Dean is struck by the fact that even if the folder had been ten shades brighter, it still wouldn’t have come close to the piercing intensity of the blue in Castiel’s eyes. In fact, he’s not sure he’s ever seen
Cas had expected security as they arrived at the port, but what he hadn’t been prepared for was to feel like they were entering a military base just to get on a goddamn ship.
She glares at him, then holds the book in front of his face. “Will this be good for her?” she asks, gesturing toward a little girl next to her, presumably her daughter, who can’t be more than ten years old.
“Hello, Castiel,” she says, taking a seat in the chair next to his desk. “How are you?”
“Fuck you, Sammy,” Dean says, even as he can feel the flush creeping up his neck and across his cheeks. “Just thought I'd do you guys a favor, make it a little easier for the bride and groom, but I see how it is.”
“You’re not an asshole, Dean.” It comes out quickly, and Cas finds himself hoping that it wasn’t said too quickly.
“I know what a joke is,” Cas says, Dean’s attitude once again overshadowing his gorgeous goddamn face.
, do yourself a favor and grab a copy, if only to see how goddamn happy Dean looks with his new beau.”
Dean gives her a small smile before the camera pans down to catch the way he squeezes her hands reassuringly. “He’s in charge, far as I’m concerned.”
good with a smile on his face.
Cas barely hears those last five words through the blood pounding in his ears as his throats goes dry. “E-excuse me?”
“So, Cassie,” Balthazar says later that day at work, “haven’t heard much from you about your little running buddy.”
Once he’s finished, Dean looks up at him with a satisfied smile, and wipes his hand clean before straddling Cas and undoing the cuffs. “Good?” he asks, sliding back down onto the bed with Cas in tow.
Dean can feel Sam’s and Novak’s eyes on him as he rights himself, and he’s relieved when Sam starts walking over to their section of stone that needs splitting without comment. That reprieve is short-lived, though; he knows there’s a lecture coming when he hears Sam sigh.
Sam purses his lips, but Dean feels a tiny spark of victory alight when his brother’s got no response other than a stammered little, “I…”
Sure enough, they’re admitted onto the bus, and Cas sighs in relief at the small burst of warm air from the heater that hits his face as they enter.
Two thoughts immediately start clamoring for his attention: how unfair it is for one person to be so goddamn good-looking; and how Balthazar somehow
So why is it so hard to believe that he’d cancel his appearance on a show that’d make him no money on the off chance that Cas would agree to another date with him?
He glances down at his fingers, then back to his sister’s face. “Uh, your nose. And your cheeks.” He taps his own cheekbone, under his eye. “Right around there, I think.”
Dean opens his playbill and checks out the list of who’ll be appearing at their show, and shakes his head incredulously. He never really thought he’d have this thing in his hands, and the fact that he does makes him feel like he’s living in some alternate reality where he actually has
Cas rolls his eyes and tosses the magazine back onto the table. “You say that as if my whole life up until this point has been something other than a massive fucking disappointment to them.”
,” Dean mutters, his gaze darting between Garth and the road ahead. He slides across the seats and grabs for the wheel, jerking them back onto the road at the last second. “Uh, Garth?” he shouts over the engine. “You okay, pal?”
Despite how unbelievable it is, Cas can’t help but wonder how he didn’t figure it out sooner.
Castiel’s heart inexplicably starts beating faster at the outlandish compliment, and he smiles. “Thank you.”
“We stopped it,” he says helplessly, letting himself be dragged toward the edge of the stage. “Damn it, we stopped it.”
He rests his palm against Cas’ chest, warm and firm against his skin, and looks up at him through long eyelashes in a silent request of permission. Cas nods and focuses on Dean’s tiny little smile before it’s covered by Dean fastening the tie over his eyes. He digs his fingernails into his palms, soaking up the way Dean’s lips feel against his skin as he kisses his sternum, his collarbone, his neck.
They’re rubbing sleep out of their eyes and smacking their cheeks to try and wake themselves up when Cas sidles up next to them. The only one who seems to notice his presence is Gabe, who always seems to be awake--it’s like he’s got a direct line to all the energy in Station 1237.
Cas could eat these for the rest of his life. He’s never had a cannoli so goddamn good, and as they pass Mike’s Pastry, he’s struck with an overwhelming sense of pity for all those waiting in line for subpar cannolis. Something about Dean’s smugness, though, the way he was already absolutely sure that Cas would love them, gives him pause, and he decides to mess with him a little.
!” She kicks back in her chair, arms outstretched behind her, and wheels around in a quick circle. “
Cas opens his mouth to answer, but before he can, the man slams hard into his side, and Cas is quick to register the fact that Dean’s hand is no longer in his. He looks up quickly to see a pair of hands dragging Dean into the alley they were in the process of passing. Before he can try to grab for Dean and get them out of there, he’s shoved repeatedly until he’s in the alley, too. Once they’re in the shadows, their attackers moves fast; Cas lets out a gasp as the man slams him up against a wall, and when he tries to squirm out of his attacker’s grip, he gets an elbow to the face for his troubles. He catches a glimpse of Dean trying to smack his attacker with his cane; the man grabs hold of it and wrenches it out of Dean’s hands, sending it clattering to the pavement and out of Dean’s reach.
“What’re you doing?”
--” Dean barks out a quick cross between a laugh and a scoff “--was bad. Kid almost broke my nose with that one.”
television.”
He’s got it all planned out, but his mind goes blank when he returns to an empty table. Cas is nowhere to be seen. His beer is still sitting on the table, undisturbed, and the seed of anxiety buried deep in Dean’s chest starts to grow as his mind kicks back up again. He scans the room quickly, trying to find his messy-haired angel somewhere in the crowded din of the saloon, but there’s nothing.
A few moments of awkward silence later, Michael emerges from the back, a wide, accommodating smile plastered across his face. He claps Castiel on the shoulder and pauses on his way by and whispers, “It’s ten of three, just take off, okay?” and Castiel is taken by surprise by this small act of kindness. He nods quickly, mouths a polite
“What, there had to be a reason for it? We don’t look like guys who can keep a house clean?” he asks, mock-offended.
“On nice days, I enjoy taking my lunch outside,” Cas starts. “And when I was out there today, I noticed this—” And the world just seems to drop down to slow-motion when Cas pulls a sketchbook out of his bag.
“You know what I mean,” he says by way of apology. “I don’t...you know. You’re not…”
Dean huffs out a disbelieving laugh. “Just a little bit, yeah.” He eats a couple more fries before adding, “They good as you hoped?”
It takes a few weeks of seeing other couples out and about—and stumbling upon the now infamous issue of
“How long you been playing?” Dean tries, only to be met with the same results. He rocks awkwardly on the balls of his feet, then tries again. “Don’t talk much, I take it.”
“There’s my girl.” He gets to his feet and welcomes Lisa back with yet another a dramatic dip, one hand holding hers, the other supporting the small of her back. He glances up at Ellen, who gives him a tiny nod, then at Sam, who flashes a thumbs up, and smiles before bringing Lisa back up and pressing his lips to hers.
“Finally,” Sam says, hopping off the wooden fence he’d been perched on when he spots them. “What the hell took you...y’know what, I don’t want to know.” He rolls his eyes at Dean’s wicked grin. Sam’s taken the time alone to reacquaint himself with downtown Lawrence, and he’s got an idea of where to find Jessica. He starts leading them down another side street across from the bandstand when a voice from behind stops them in their tracks.
“Oh. Yes.” Castiel pulls the rope out of his pocket and hands one end to Dean. Dean snatches it and barely even waits for Castiel before starting out at a slow jog, setting their pace for the morning.
Dean’s eyes dart toward Cas, but Cas can tell he would’ve ignored him even if Cas had said no. “Yeah, ‘course.” He gets to his feet and wraps his arms around the girls, one of whom holds her arm out to take a selfie.
Dean points at him. “Yeah, those. You can
Dean is standing in the doorway, a cup in each hand and a bunch of blankets tucked under his arm, and suddenly Cas feels super self-conscious and exposed in his pajama pants and old T-shirt.
This doesn’t mean anything, he tells himself as he opens a new DM and types in Dean’s name, catching his lower lip between his teeth. He’s just killing time before his train arrives. That’s it.
Cas shifts uncomfortably, digging his hands deep into his pockets. “Maybe we should wait until next week,” he says. “I don’t want Sam to think we’re moving too f—”
Dean brings his hand up from Cas’ shoulder and tangles it in Cas’ hair playfully. “‘Course.”
“Yeah!” he crows, holding it up like it’s a prize sea bass, and it might as well be from how proud he is of the damn thing. Wrapping his hand around the fish, he stumbles back to the riverbank and tosses it onto the ground. He’ll need a way to carry the fish back to camp, and as he watches his catch flop around on the grass, he glances down at his shirt.
some happy-go-lucky bank robber, and some way, somehow, they’d managed to pull off all three.
Cas isn’t sure if he believes in a god, but one thing’s for sure:
“It’s nothing,” Cas insists. “He’s just—”
Could he have done something different?
folder and Cas never sees it? No, he can't risk that. A friend request, maybe? A friend request
Even though Cas usually hates when other people touch his belongings without permission, he has to admit that there’s no way he could’ve gotten everything up to his room as quickly and smoothly as the five RAs did. They drop everything off on the vacant side of room 318, make sure he’s got his ID card and room key, wish him luck, then are gone almost as fast as they appeared.
“What, no fruit basket?” Winchester says, smirking. Next to Cas, Raphael takes a step forward and smacks Winchester hard across the face. He grunts as his head snaps to the side, but he quickly rights himself, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the ground the way Cas remembers his father doing with chewing tobacco when he was young.
Things like the tiny little hole in the chainlink, the invisible lines where wardens would stop and pivot on their horses while monitoring their work outside, leaving blind spots a mile wide.
He forces Dean’s crooked grin out of his head—which isn’t
“Aw, you crying, Dean?” Sam asks, smirking. Cas is sure that he doesn’t know what the book says--they’ll have to explain it to him later--but he smiles anyway.
“Seriously?”
He hates this, hates having his back to everyone and everything. He’s vulnerable, just standing here like a goddamn lovesick moron. He bites his lower lip, watching the way his knuckles are turning whiter and whiter around the railing and cursing his past self for, well...everything.

He’s taken at least eight pictures before he realizes that he’s spacing out, and quickly takes the camera away from his eye. “I took a few,” he explains sheepishly, handing the camera back to Aiden’s dad.
Unless, apparently, he’s about to meet his boyfriend’s brother.

, is as good a time as any. He takes a breath and glances hesitantly at Dean, who chuckles as he takes a sip of his drink.
“All right, all right, all right,” Dean says, leaning hard into the comfortable buzz he’s feeling as he drops back down onto the couch with a fresh beer in hand. He grabs for the remote and is about to hit PLAY when Benny stops him, covering the remote with his hand while keeping his eyes glued to his phone.
This gets Dean to poke his head up. “We still talkin’ about the donut here?”
whoever the hell this mystery guy is. And if he doesn’t see that, fuck him. You’ll find someone who will.”
Dean huffs out a laugh. “Read ‘em to me!”
He’s trying to catch his breath, eyes squeezed shut, when he feels cold metal slide under his chin. He doesn’t want to straighten up, not yet, but he doesn't have much of a choice in the matter as Heyerdahl uses the flat of the pickaxe to lift his chin up, forcing their eyes to meet. He swallows hard at the leer on Heyerdahl’s face, wondering for a second if he’s bitten off more than he can chew.
Sam looks like he’s seconds away from smacking him. “Can you, for once in your goddamn life, stop being so stubborn?” He runs both hands through his hair, turning on his heel and keeping his back to Dean for a few seconds before turning back around. “He didn’t know. And even if he did, why the hell would he’ve stayed with us after the fact? I’m not saying it wasn’t a scare, Dean, but Jesus. Hell,
“Uh, pizza’s not here yet, Dean.”
“We’ll be careful,” Dean decides for both of them, looking over at Cas. “There isn’t a handbook for this shit, but we’ll figure it out.”
And if Dean had thought Cas’ smile was big before, well, it’s nothing compared to what he sees when he draws back from the kiss. “I could say the same.”
Sam just laughs.
And when Dean gets bored, he gets curious.
Cas hesitates. “And what’s this one question?”
Dean chuckles uneasily, not wanting to upset their host and accidentally end up on this wall himself. “They, uh…” He trails off uncertainly before finally finishing with, “Sure are something.”

With that, he reaches forward with his free hand and tugs the Colt’s hood down before bringing his hand to the Colt’s mask.
“Radio’s a man’s game.” She says it quick and sure, like it’s something she’s been forced to address for ages now, and Dean realizes guiltily that she probably has. “Might’a been. Ain’t now.” Their continued silence must be enough of an answer in itself, because she’s glaring now, arms crossed over her chest. “Do you sirs got yourselves a radio station?”
“But Cassie,” Balthazar whines, sprawling himself out across the couch and draping the back of his hand dramatically over his forehead, “if you don’t come, who’s going to bail us out of sea jail?”
Charlie raises her eyebrows, purses her lips in contemplation, then nods. “I’d watch it.”
“Will you let me finish?”
Dean glances at the rose, then back at her. “I have a pretty good idea, yeah.”
“Don’t even get me started.” She waves him off and reaches for the magazine, studying the cover for a few more seconds and tapping two fingers on the photo. “He’s just as lucky, you know,” she says. “Remember that, little brother.”
“But...why?”
A recent post catches Cas’ attention, and he taps on it. It’s a photo of Dean dressed in a simple, well-fitting suit against a white background. He’s leaning forward, one hand behind his back, the other holding a rose that he’s offering out to the viewer. One eyebrow raised, a crooked, closed-lipped smirk on his lips—he looks
"I bet he is."
What catches his eye instead of the time, though, is a notification from Instagram.
queer
Cas shrugs, looping his arms around Dean’s neck and linking his hands together there. “I just...it was all so sudden. Almost immediately after you left, someone walked over, and I felt a gun against my back. They said something about a warrant, about knowing who I was, and I wasn’t going to fight them on it. I thought that if I went without a fight, they’d leave before finding you both.”
“Why didn’t you sit with me?”
“None of his friends run,” Anna answers, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
Cas’ head spins as he tries to make sense of the words coming out of Zachariah’s mouth. He could stop all this so easily, he could change his mind and agree to write the story, he could keep his job and get a raise and make some incredible connections, and--
Screaming kids (and screaming parents), flowing booze, crowded dining rooms—it’s like an inescapable college orientation complete with icebreakers and forced laughter and awkward conversations.
“Or guy’s,” Billie points out helpfully. Cas glares at her, and she shrugs. “Hey, just being accurate, man.”
In retrospect, he should have kicked Gabriel right out of his room the second he suggested going to see a band who had the word “bordello” in their name, but like always, his brother had gotten to him.

Cas rolls his eyes. “Would you like to see it?”
is Dean ready to hear what Cas’ singing voice sounds like.
Cas grins at him. "Feeling better?"
Castiel tucks his phone between his ear and shoulder before starting to stretch, grabbing at his foot and pulling it up behind his back. “Speaking.”
Dean points at him. “Gabriel,” he says, and Cas smiles.
cold outside, is it?” he asks, getting to his feet and pulling on his own jacket, which is thin enough that Cas would still wear it with layers even on a sixty degree day.

Dean takes a deep breath when Anna’s hand ghosts around the collar of his T-shirt as she struts around him, hopping up onto the bench in one fluid motion and holding out her hands. Dean takes them—he can do this, he can
He drops his things off onto the desk, writes himself a quick reminder about the faculty budget meeting later that week, then starts dragging the eraser across the board in one huge swipe after another to prepare for his first class of the day. Just as he starts thinking about how he needs to clean these goddamn things, his nose twitches, and he buries his face in the crook of his arm just in time to muffle his sneeze.
Castiel opens his mouth to start a wave of apologies--it’s his fault, he should’ve been paying more attention, he’ll help Dean get cleaned up, it won’t happen again--but he’s cut off before he can begin by a chuckle from Dean.
The guy takes a few seconds to mentally locate Cas’ room in his head, then leads the group--Cas right in the middle of them--into Miranda Hall. Cas casts one last glance to his car, which now, with almost all its doors thrown open, as well as the trunk, looks like it’s been picked apart by vultures, before letting himself be guided inside.
There are seats right next to him, even across from him if Cas wants some personal space. But for some godforsaken reason, reheated fish is a better lunch date than him.
They head over to the dugout and gather with the rest of the team around Coach Shurley, a skinny guy with a scraggly beard and hopeful smile. He doesn't
When he sees that, Dean’s face softens and he squeezes her shoulder once more before heading back to their table. Cas stares at him, is straight gawking at this point, but he doesn’t care.
“It’s not exactly the first thing you think of.  had my fair share of wanting to see oceans and lightning storms and rainbows and shit again, but at least I
Before either of them can say anything else, the bell above the door jingles again, and Dean turns around to see Sam and Jess truding in out of the rain. Sam shakes his damp hair out of his eyes, and Dean can’t help but think of a dog shaking itself off after running around in the rain. Jess drops the hood of her jacket and gives them a warm smile and a small wave. Dean waves back before immediately digging into his little brother.
, Cas wants to add, but he just nods.
One’s good.
“Gun to the spine,” Dean murmurs, stumbling a little when Crowley jabs the gun deeper into his back as they’re forced outside and shoved into the backseat of a waiting car. “What’d I tell you.”
“Dean, sweetie,” she calls from behind him, “your partner’s just arrived, so do try and look a little more like you may be about to meet the love of your life, and just a smidge less like you’re on Death Row, hmm?”
He turns around one more time. “Don’t gotta plead your case to me.” He jerks his thumb back toward the wardens making their way through the jail, rousing any still-sleeping prisoners from sleep. “Take it up with them.” Keeping his eyes on Novak, he smacks Sam on the chest with the back of his hand. “C’mon, Sammy, let’s go.”
Hub Comics is a tiny shop nestled in the middle of Union Square, and Cas approaches the front door a little hesitantly. He’d gotten the name and location of Dean’s former comic shop from Sam, but if he’s being honest with himself, he has no idea what he’s doing. He should just turn around and head back to the bus stop before he embarrasses himself. This was just a little spark of an idea, he hasn’t even tried to figure it out further, and there’s no guarantee these people could even help him.
Dean stares at the message and grins down at the phone before unlocking it and punching in a quick,
A quick glance at Sam and Novak—both still asleep—has him rolling his eyes. The anticipation of today had been killing him, making him sleep like shit, as bad as he used to on Christmas Eve when he was a kid, so the sight of these two dumbasses sleeping like rocks next to him has him rousing them out of sleep a little harsher than necessary.
“Fucking scumbag,” Billie mutters, shaking her head.
“What’s that spiked with?” Dean asks, nodding toward the mug.
As the race starts to kick into gear, other runners begin to stream past them, which Cas is grateful for; it cuts down on the noise, even if it's just slightly, and gives him and Dean a little extra room to move around.
. His tongue bumps against Dean’s, and Cas edges himself toward Dean even more, closing the gap between them until he’s practically on Dean’s lap. Their position is awkward and uncomfortable and Cas is pretty sure he’s almost lost feeling in one of his legs, but he’d stay like this all day if it meant he got to keep kissing Dean.
Annoyed, he rubs at it with the heel of his hand. He thinks it’s nothing, really. Some kind of dream.
“Well, that’s definitely a roadblock,” Charlie says before taking a sip of her drink.
A giant group of tourists is entering the museum just as Castiel leaves, and he's silently thrilled at the fact that he doesn't have to deal with any more museum-goers until the day after tomorrow (which will undoubtedly come too soon). The museum is normally insane, especially during nice weather, but it’s seemed particularly crazy lately, and Castiel breathes in deeply through his nose to try and rid himself of the anxiety and tension that had built up during the day as he makes his way into the bright Boston sunshine.
“I, uh.” Dean takes a few more steps forward and starts rapping his knuckles absently on the top of the case, pretending to decide between a black-and-white cookie or a red velvet cupcake, but really trying to figure out the best way to tell this girl that he’s actually looking for the cute blue-eyed guy with a bad case of bedhead and rusty people skills. “I guess I’ll have--”
to, like all the other teachers at Thompson, but somehow it still feels like he’s breaking the rules as he and Charlie usher their students outside, all of ‘em like kids trying to avoid their parents as they sneak downstairs for late-night snacks during sleepovers.
staring; he shakes his head sharply and motions for Cas to follow them. “Let’s move, handsome.”
“Don’t go lookin’ a gift horse in the mouth,
Dean smiles faintly. “Ding, ding, ding.”
From what little he learned from his first encounter with the brothers, he knows for a fact that they don’t belong here, and he suddenly starts to seriously reconsider his squatting theory.
“Not too reassuring there, Doctor Quinn,” Dean snaps. “My teeth. They chipped?”
Cas sucks in a deep breath through his nose. “318.”
He still doesn’t do shorts, but the other two, apparently, are now fair game.
His phone starts buzzing on the coffee table and he glances at it, an incoming call from Charlie. He considers ignoring it, eyes darting back to Dean’s photo, but Charlie never calls if she can help it, so it must be important—or at least interesting.
Scumbag Steve in quick succession. Shit, Dean hasn’t heard of some of these in years, and he’s simultaneously impressed and terrified by how deep his kids’ online knowledge goes.
Thanks to Hannah, Cas had finished his work with a good six hours to spare, and Wednesday arrives too soon. After a less-than-ideal subway ride involving overly enthusiastic tourists, a pack of drunk college students trying to find their way to the House of Blues, and Cas tripping over his own feet in his efforts to drag his overstuffed suitcase down the street behind him, he finally arrives at Gabe’s house.
“Today’s topic,” Dean says, turning his back to the class as he writes on the chalkboard in quick, uneven strokes, “memes.”
“I know, but I—”
episodes for a reason. It hadn’t taken long for Dean to figure out Cas’ biggest turn-ons, and if Cas is being honest, he thinks he did a pretty good job keeping Dean on his toes, as well.
Castiel glares at him, and Balthazar raises his hands in mock surrender.
Cas squints to read one more sign in particular, this one scrawled out in bright red marker. Once he’s read it, his cheeks get even more flushed than they already are. “Oh.”
“I really think you--”
“You must have someone you’re yearning to return to, as well.” Cas says it like it’s the most obvious thing in the world, as if it’s plausible that Dean would really have anyone willing to stick around for him after all this time. He’s been told it enough times in his life, that he’s not much more than a pretty face; there’s no way he’d have someone stick around for years, for a pretty face they can’t even see. “Surely.”
Cas’ job, on the other hand, had remained relatively steady. His office shifted to entirely remote work, and while the change did create some added stressors, Dean had found...unique ways to ease Cas’ nerves.
The ball goes flying off Vic’s bat with a crack, and suddenly, everyone else is pressed up against the fence with Cas, watching the ball soar into the outfield.
Dean’s got his beer to his mouth and glances around it, then coughs on the sip he’s taking. “Fuck,” he mutters, abandoning the can on the coffee table before scrambling to his feet. “Fuck, fuck, fuck...”
,” he says excitedly, and Cas grins widely at him. The walk-off had been amazing, of course, but the hug?
“Blind runner coming through!”
Winchester scoffs and grins humorlessly before edging forward in the seat as much as his bonds will allow. “Fuck you--what did you
, right?” She starts typing quickly, the screen’s glow bouncing faintly off the lenses of her glasses. “They keep getting my hopes up, then breaking my heart week after week. When’s the last time a new issue came out, anyway?”
“Just out of nowhere?”
And something clicks, and Dean finally,
“Son of a
“Wanna hear something even funnier?”
Fire still makes Dean testy, especially fire around those closest to him, but he pushes past it and focuses instead on the fact that although he’d mourned the loss of that prison jumpsuit that had fit Cas so well, he can’t help but admit that this new getup is a welcome upgrade. Dean smiles in spite of himself. He rocks back and forth on his heels, hands jammed deep into his pockets, before nudging Cas with his elbow.
“But we
Cas nods uncertainly. “Oh.”
Cas pauses and looks at Dean, as if he’s trying to sniff out some kind of motive to his questioning, which just makes Dean feel worse. “No,” he finally says slowly. “No siblings presently.”
been the toughest part of the plan, though—trying to figure out the right spiel to get Novak on their team once they realized they’d have to drag him along with them—ended up proving even easier than getting Sam to come around. When they’d first sprung the idea of flying the coop, he’d just stared at them, no comment. Makes sense, when Dean thinks about it—ain’t like he’d had much of a choice, what with them being chained together and all, but Dean’d be damned if they didn’t still run it by him, courtesy’s sake and all that.
Once he’s gotten their chains off, Gabriel leads them through his place, which seems like more of a funhouse than any kind of home. The lighting’s shit, but from what Dean can see, the rooms are full of stacks upon stacks of newspapers and old, mismatched furniture that probably haven’t been moved (or cleaned) in decades. The whole place smells of mothballs and mold, and Dean has to stop himself from covering his mouth and nose with his shirt as they’re given the grand tour.

“That sounds perfect.”

Novak just glares, and if Dean were just a little bit more childish, he’d stick out his tongue.
“Gee, thanks,” he mutters, grinning at him all the same. “Relief to know I’ve got you lookin’ out for me, Vic.”
use a goddamn vacation), but something about that makes Cas pause.
listing, and Cas’ heart is in his throat as he watches Dean’s eyes for any sort of reaction as he takes in the massive archive of episodes.
When he finally does look up, it’s right at Cas, and his face softens immediately.
“Think you can stop being a good person for two minutes?” Dean mutters, grabbing the flashlight away from Sam as they head deeper into the pen. “Two minutes ain’t too much to ask, is it?”
Dean releases another few breaths, and Cas notices the smile that creeps onto his face, as well. “Fuck you, Heartbreak Hill.”
He doesn’t have to wait long before Cas gives him a small but delighted smile. “In,” he says. “One hundred percent in.”
Cas hasn’t even raised his hand to knock on Gabe’s front door when his brother whips it open. “Party’s hereeee!” he yelps in a singsong voice, grabbing Cas by the wrist and pulling him inside. Cas stumbles forward into his kitchen with its black-and-white tiles and novelty glass jars full of candy, and wonders, not for the first time, how his brother manages to pass as a functioning adult.
, Castiel, how the hell do you expect Dean to read a text? Maybe he should call—
“No.”
“Oh, it’s not?”
Dean thrashes against the grips holding him in place, eyes brimming with disgust and anger. Blood is dripping from his nose, and his jaw is already swelling and going purple from Alastair’s kick.
People are taking photos, striking poses underneath the umbrellas, and Cas takes a second to just revel in the simple joy of the place. There’s nothing for sale, nothing glamorous or extravagant, just colors and fantasy and a break from reality.
Dean doesn’t come home that night.
“What the hell—”
“We leave on Wednesday.”
“Calm down, Al,” Zachariah says, pressing a hand to his friend’s chest. “Take a breath, have a drink. You’ll have your time.”
Cas pauses and turns around, staring at his boyfriend. Dean’s sitting on the couch, and his eyes are trained on the floor.
Rain’s coming down harder now, and the metal goes slick with it under Dean’s fingers. Before he knows it, he’s almost lost his grip when he can’t afford to lose even a second. “C’mon, you son of a bitch,” he mutters under his breath. He realigns the bolt cutters and snips through two links at once to try and get his rhythm back.

“From what?”
stutter at that. “You’ve done it before? Taken the pictures?”
He wants to puke when he sees him enter the next one without hesitation.

“By who?”
this,” Dean grumbles. He lifts his head up and out of the car’s engine before slamming the hood down in frustration. They’d driven through the night, but any hopes Dean had had of them stumbling across a gas station before they’d broken down had just gone up in smoke. “No gas left, engine burnt up to all getout.”
) is somehow in even worse shape than the house. It’s a place to lay their heads though, and Dean’s learned his lesson about looking a gift horse in the mouth.
The restaurant isn’t too crowded, and the second Cas sees him, he recognizes him from TV, and he hates himself for feeling almost starstruck. Sam’s eyes brighten as Dean leads Cas toward him, and Cas has to resist the urge to wave. Dean nudges Cas as his little brother approaches, and mutters, “Be cool,” under his breath.
“Watch it!” Dean yells, pressing his hand to the top of Sam’s head and shoving him down just as a torch comes flying into the barn. It lands on a nearby hay bale, which catches almost instantly, because when can things ever go right for a goddamn Winchester?
“We can find out.”
“People will find out eventually,” Cas says, running his thumb across Dean’s knuckles. “Do you have room for me in the limelight?”
Dean places two folded twenties onto the receipt and pins them all together with his empty beer bottle. He pockets his wallet and grins humorlessly at Cas. “You get the next one.”
Dean’s more surprised than anyone to see that it’s working, this thing’s actually fucking
The fourth limo pulls up in front of the mansion, and the second the men inside get a glimpse of Lisa, they dissolve into whistles and cheers.
“Drop it, Sam,” Dean interrupts. “All’s I want is a good night’s sleep, that’s it. No interrogations. No sentimental talk. Not tonight.”
Dean groans when Cas pulls off with a wet
“Hannah?” Cas asks, ducking under the flap and into the infirmary tent.
She winks at him, then gets to her feet. “Let’s get these hooligans back together, huh?” She doesn’t wait for his response before putting two fingers to her mouth and letting out a whistle that has Dean cringing unconsciously as he packs up his bag. “Yo!” she yells across the grounds. “Two minutes, guys and dolls! That goes for you too, Picassos!”
Resident smartass, Japanese spider crab enthusiast, and, if Dean’s being honest, one of his favorite students (unless someone’s asking him if he’s got favorites; in that case, he loves all his kids equally) Krissy Chambers clears her throat and considers him. “Don’t you mean meh-mays?”
“Is there a meme for kissing?” Cas finally murmurs, his breath hot against Dean’s mouth. Dean huffs out a laugh, grinning down at Cas’ lips.
“Trust us, Cassie,” Balthazar says reassuringly, “there is.”
It’s almost sad, Dean thinks, rotating one ankle, then another, listening to the way the chains clank together in the darkness, mixing with the sounds of Sam’s snores and Novak’s steady breathing beside him. After all this time, they’ll be gone soon. They’ve become second-nature to him, so much so that it feels wonky for him to walk the few times a day he’s
Heyerdahl’s fingers dig deeper into Dean’s jaw and he bites down harder still, hard enough that he can taste the coppery tang of blood against his tongue. It doesn’t matter, though; he’ll chew through his whole damn cheek before he says a damn word to Heyerdahl.
“The inimitable Dan Westchester,” Balthazar says slyly, and Cas can tell he said it just to get a rise out of him. He’s successful in hiding his emotions this time, and Balthazar pouts a little, then prods further. “Has he...helped relieve you of stress yet?”
“Oh. Uh, I guess so. My boyfriend loves it.”
Cas smiles. “Move a little to your right,” he says. “They’re giving out high fives.”
existing
“Not my problem!”
Sam laughs, and Dean would flip him off if his hands weren’t full of cash. A damn wonderful problem to have, if you ask him. “What d’ya say, fellas?” Sam asks. “Drinks on Mr. Fitzgerald?”
“Ugh, ‘Yorktown’ is in
Dean rests his hands on Cas’ hips and kisses him. He could stay here all day, but they’ve been lollygagging long enough; it’s about time they focus on helping Sam track down Jessica. As much as he hates to do it, he pulls himself away from Cas and takes his hand as they head back to the front of the store.
“Three banks in two—” Sam’s voice trails off as the three of them stumble out of the car. Garth’s well on his way into the bank, gun held high. He also seems none the wiser that they aren’t following him, and that, well, that gives Dean an idea. He turns around to peek into the backseat and help himself to some of Garth Fitzgerald IV’s cold, hard cash.
instead, and crouches down so he’s closer to the girl’s height.
, Cas, just one
Balthazar shrugs. “Same thing.” His face goes serious and he pats Castiel on the back. “See you at work, Castiel.”
Dean takes a long breath, digging down deep in his chest for all the air hidden down there. He doesn’t have to do this; he doesn’t have to do
Cas leans in closer, breath ghosting over Dean’s lips as he presses Dean’s hands down on either side of his head. Dean cranes his neck up to meet him, and he closes his eyes at the veritable fireworks show kicking off low in his chest at Cas’ lips against his, Cas’ tongue warm in his mouth, Cas’ grip tightening on his hands, Cas’ dick pressing against him—all of it rolled into one.
He can feel Dean stiffen slightly, but he doesn’t stop walking. “About what?”
“Very.”
Cas nods, but doesn’t say much else. Dean takes the moment to admire the way his profile looks in the low light of the fire, all sharp lines and edges that’re somehow still tinged with an inherent softness. It’s nice, and Dean’s gotta fight hard not to reach out and run his hand along Cas’ jaw.
of them at some point or another, so ask him if he feels bad about throwing him under the bus), he’s the perfect choice to act as a human punching bag, and Dean gives himself a mental pat on the back for his damn-near impeccable casting.
“What’s there
Dean gets to his feet and follows, taking in Castiel’s lean body, one he knows for sure that he wouldn’t have if he worked in a place like this. “Had some of that bisc--
“Fuck it,” he sighs, then grabs his phone, digs into his messenger bag for that stupid post-it note, and drafts a new text message before he can talk himself out of it.
Bobby looks at them flatly, then, without taking his eyes off Sam and Dean, asks Cas, “You were chained to ‘em, weren’t you?”
Dean laughs, resting his free hand on his chest. “It’s a comic,” he says, “about people who can stop time when they have sex. And once time
Gabriel glances at him and winks before tossing a nip of peppermint schnapps his way.
Dean hates that, being told that he’s a good person, he says it makes him feel awkward and embarrassed, but it’s quickly become one of Cas’ favorite pastimes. The faint blush on Dean’s cheeks and the way he grins shyly as he shoves Cas’ hand away makes it worth it, and he smiles, trying to time his heartbeat with Dean’s as he rests his head back against his chest.
After what feels like an eternity, they finally reach the top of the Hill, and Cas catches a glimpse of the Prudential Center, still far away, looming over them. There’s a band playing off to the side, their enthusiastic marching band music blending in with the constant cheers and whoops and clanging of cowbells, and Cas finds his lips curling into a smile again.
“Uh, my name is Castiel Novak, I’m--”
“Fucking
“But,” Castiel continues, “from what little I know about you, I don’t think you would’ve gone for this if he had asked your permission first, so maybe that really was the best way to go about it.”
“He’s here to run with you, Dean,” Sam interrupts, and both Castiel and Dean turn toward Sam, surprised by his bluntness. Dean’s the one who speaks first.
Dean feels for them, the poor bastards. It’s only been a few days since he was last in their shoes, but it’s already something he hopes never to have to repeat. The warden’s weaving between them, high up on a horse that looks damn near ready to buck him off. As much a force of habit it is to watch the goings-on, he only decides it’s safe for a quick look once they’ve passed, with Sam doing the same.
Yeah, Dean’s partial to describing it as
Dean rolls onto his side and looks at him curiously. “What?”
He could forgive a few overly dramatic quips or scenes from Dean; this was
“This is a really good street for running,” Castiel finally says, and feels like an idiot the second the words leave his mouth.
“No, no, no,” Sam says quickly. “It’s just…”
Dean sighs and looks forlornly at his iPhone. “I was just getting to a good part.”
“You what?”
She squints at him. “I have no idea,” she says slowly. “That’s why I’m asking. When someone’s responsible for the most buzz-worthy story this dinky paper has seen in
“But...why?”
Dean likes to tell folks that he and Sam ended up here after getting caught doing something full of bravado and old-school cool, running a speakeasy or robbing a bank like in the movies. Sometimes he’d spend lunchtime waxing poetic about the wild streak in him and his brother, the car chase they got in trying to avoid the cops, the way he’d taken down four officers—four!—single handedly before he and Sam were betrayed by their partner and left to pay the price for all three of ‘em.
“Cas!”
“Say your goodbyes,” they respond in unison, raising their drinks high before taking a long sip and hitting PLAY.
“No?”
Cas’ ears perk up at the familiar title, and he grins down at the book he’s pretending to be absorbed in, which is something about a boy with antlers who really likes candy bars, apparently.
Cas opens his mouth to explain, but then just shakes his head. “The girls from Wellesley! They’re excited to see us!”
Well, that settles it. Cas could never even
“No,” Cas says, shaking his head. “I like it.” He gives Dean another smile, this one just as small but shining with a bit more confidence that makes warmth flare up in Dean’s chest. “Thank you, Dean.”
last week between Brady, Bela, and Gordon.
“Fuck you, Sammy,” Dean says, flipping off his little brother, and Sam laughs.
"Are you sitting where anyone sat? John Belushi, maybe? Dana Carvey?"
Dean’s silent at that, and Crowley smiles, a gross, slimy grimace that’s got Dean throttling him six ways from Sunday in his head. “Nothing personal, of course.”
“What were you going to do tonight,” Cas asks, trying to stuff a string of gooey melted cheese into his mouth as gracefully as he can, “if I hadn’t texted you?”
Cas scoots himself closer to Dean and uses his fingers to stretch the hat open so he can place it over Dean’s head himself. “Dean, you’re gonna get hypotherm—”
“Exactly why I’m asking.” The man drags a chair over from a nearby table and scoots between Gabe and Cas, taking care to avoid Balthazar, who’s flagged down a passing waiter for a scotch. “Now, open your calculator app, and let’s start with your birthday.”
“No!”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Heard they’ve got a pretty great hockey team.”
“All right,” Gabe says, flourishing his napkin with a flick of his wrist and laying it across his lap, “Blondie clearly wasn’t into me, so who’d you gents have to fuck to get us this kind of treatment, huh?”
The rest of the letter waxes poetic about how he’s about to become a part of Wildwood’s distinct undergraduate class, receive a top-notch education, and that they can’t wait to see how he’ll contribute to the community as a transfer student. Cas rolls his eyes at that and scans the rest of the letter until he gets to the bottom, where he sees a hastily scrawled note written next to the president’s stamped signature.
“You son of a bitch,” he mutters in disbelief, stopping in his tracks and taking in the tiny house he hadn’t seen in going on half a decade.
Cas tilts his head and looks at him, eyes narrow and curious in the dull light of the fire. He considers him for a few seconds, and Dean must’ve done a hell of a job making him feel comfortable, because he asks, “Makes what sting less?”
Everyone starts young in the Company, being unofficially trained to fight from the day they’re big enough to properly wield even the smallest of pocket knives until they turn 18 and are accepted into one of the Stations surrounding the main residential and governing area of the Company--in Cas’ family, it had been no different. When he turned four, Cas’ parents had started buying him knives with fancy embroidered handles, rifles customized just for him...all in an attempt to ignite the spark of combat they were convinced was
They’re only a few minutes into the trick when they’re interrupted by a sharp, “You harassing my customers again, Heyerdahl?”
Cas’ brows furrow together at Dean’s response.
“Hey, Scott Lang is compelling! Plus, he can lift up to 50 times his own body weight.”
“Castiel?”
“Okay,” Castiel finally says, tightening the laces one last time before straightening. “Do you want to like, touch my face or anything before we start?”
He does a lot of shit, so much that he doesn't notice that he has a missed call until later that night.
"Give me ten seconds for us to get out of here." They make their way through the minefield of cups and once things are relatively clear, Cas adds, "You're good."
Dean shakes his head again and looks down at the blanket. “I’m fine.”
“Seven,” he shouts over the crowd. “Seven steps, Dean!”
And before he even realizes it’s happening, Dean finds himself pulling Novak into a one-armed hug. It’s not much, but it’s more than he—and, judging by the way he’d gone still under Dean’s hands, Novak too—had been expecting.
Next to him, Dean looks happy. He’s laughing and joking and probably drinking a little too much, but whatever pain he’d been channeling to work on that drawing seems to be gone now. The whole team eats and laughs and shits on each other, until the end of the night, when Kevin shouts that they need to take their annual preseason photo. He herds them all into one side of their table, trying to get everyone looking in the same direction at the same time, and making sure no one looks particularly smashed.
Dean glares at him. “You think I’m an idiot? Relax. He doesn’t know a thing. None of ‘em do.” He’s about to tear into his biscuit when Sam reaches over and snatches the damn thing right out of his hands. “Hey!”
“No.”
, he thinks, sucking in a fresh breath of air through his nose before exhaling through his mouth.
, like he wishes he could just slink down out of his chair, under the table, and into a black hole of nothingness.
“I’ll still expect that section on radiation protection aprons ready for print before you go, of course.” She taps two fingers on the massive stack of proofs on Cas’ desk, and he nods quickly.
Dean had originally cooked up an elaborate story about a treasure to pitch him, full of curses, witchcraft, and family heirlooms, something to whet Novak’s appetite for adventure (everyone has one, even the brooding, silent types, right?) and get him invested. He’d been proud of the thing, too—good pace, a plot, and most important, believable as hell.
“And?”
Jo shoots him an icy look. “Enjoy,” she says, scooping up the little
“Damn it, Dean.” Sam glares at his brother, who stares back at him, daring him to say anything else. Sam turns to Castiel and sighs. “Can you give us some time alone, Castiel? Let me talk to him a little?”
,” he says faintly.
, not what product I modeled,” Cas says, slowly coming to terms with the fact that Dean thought about him outside of their conversation, even if it was just for a joke.
?” Balthazar asks in disbelief. “Cassie, that man is an adonis.”
“Sure, sure,” Hannah says distractedly. “You’re going on this date for us. Fine. We get it. But we need every detail, do you understand?”
Somehow, Dean doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that the best lighting in the entire house is in this goddamn room.
“Got Sammy a wooden dick keychain from that shop there a few weeks back. Pretty sure he’s
As Cas makes the trek back to the apartment, he’s terrified, upset, and pissed off, but not regretful. The idea of handing Dean over to the cops and his enemies on a silver platter had been out of the question the second it popped into his head, no matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise.
looking for stories to tell their kids like he’d mentioned around the fire, they won’t have to go far. They won’t need witchcraft and cursed pocket watches and blood pacts and knives with intricate protection sigils carved into the handles and whatever else Dean had cooked up in his original tale.
“What?”
The woman standing on the other side of the customer service counter stares daggers at Castiel, hands on her hips and a
Charlie’s eyes brighten. “Yeah? What’s his name?”
“Don’t get eaten,” Dean calls after him. There’s a few seconds of silence before a pinecone comes rocketing out of the darkness and smacking Dean right on the forehead before he can even think to react. “Son of a bitch,” he mutters, rubbing at the sore spot, before feeling around on the ground for the projectile and tossing it into the fire. “You’re gonna pay for that, you asshole!”
Cas can hear the grin on Dean’s lips in the next sentence. “They got yours, though.”
“Dean--”
Cas takes the freezing bag and glances over his shoulder as Dean heads back to the kitchen, then settles against the couch. He’d be lying if he said it didn’t feel better to be resting instead of running--he’s pretty sure he’d be in agony right now if they were still out there--but at the same time, he feels odd having someone take care of him like this. Odd, but also nice. Besides his family, he doesn’t remember the last time he’s had someone dote on him, but as he props his legs up on the coffee table with a small pile of pillows, rests the ice on his aching shins, and closes his eyes, he finds himself thinking that he’s glad the care is coming from Dean.
It only takes a minute or two before the chalkboard is full of the best memes the internet’s got to offer: Kermit sipping tea, bomboclaat, Grumpy Cat, Ok Boomer (“Bonus points for anyone who can put together a decent spinoff of this one,” Dean had offered quickly), Good Guy Greg
“I was supposed to have had time to set all this up,” he says absently, shoving the snowman cake aside to make more room for his parcels. He picks up a Tupperware container and examines its contents before pulling the lid off and setting it back on the table. Cas gets to his feet and walks over to him, snaking his arms around Dean’s hips and resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
“Mhmm.”
Castiel has pioneered Anna's car's CD player, replacing her classical soundtracks with his Ben Gibbard mix. The singer's soft voice has been a go-to ever since his music helped Castiel through his very first anxiety attack in college, and he couldn't think of a more appropriate time to utilize it as the car inches closer and closer to Dean Winchester's house.
He doesn’t know—where they’re headed, how much gas is left, how they made it out of that goddamn place alive—but he keeps driving long into the night.
“Sort of. My major is in biochemistry, so I’ll hopefully be doing something in the medical field after I graduate.”
Cas looks up not too long after that, brows furrowed together at the goddamn doe-eyes Dean must be making. “What?”
“Ben, this is my friend, Dean. He’s really excited to meet you.”
“Afternoon,” Sam says with a polite smile and nod, the kissass. Dean’s almost pleased by the fact that she doesn’t respond.
“Some of us are here to actually find our soulmate,” Alastair spits back, voice and eyes fire.
, so he fumbles to include some other description. “Well, he's haughty and full of himself, and he’s got an attitude.”
, after all. But the more often they came, the more trouble Cas had convincing himself that it was all an act, that the Dean he was seeing on TV was, well, a good person. Everything about him struck Cas as something fake, something he couldn’t set his hopes on.
annoyed. “The
Cas grins and sets his cup down before leaning back on his hands. “How’s that history paper you were telling me about?”
“Good,” Dean says, breathing a sigh of relief. “Then why are you sorry?”
“Hey.”
And now for general notes:
After a transfer and way too many delays than a four-stop ride should take, Dean and Cas arrive at Copley station and make their way up to the street, Cas’ fingers laced with Dean’s as he leads them toward the Marathon’s finish line.
The photo has by far the most likes of his pre-
“This is part two of said shit. Me and Anna, we, uh, we kind of…” He falters, trying to come up with the right word, then just settles on, “We broke up. Couple nights ago.”
“Dean--”
Hell, if it’d been written down on paper, Dean reckons he would’ve framed the damn thing, it was such a work of art.
“Likewise.” He grins before shaking his shaggy hair out of his eyes. “So, you guys hungry?"
on again?” he asks sweetly.
“It was essentially your idea,” he says softly. “It wouldn’t have felt right having it for sale without somehow giving you credit.”
“Even with the same outcome?”
Dean shakes his head resolutely, patting the clothes in Sam’s hands. “He’ll like this,” he says. “I know how much we have left. We can swing it.”
Cas lets Dean decide when to break the hug, and when he does, Cas feels him thump his hand against Cas’ back.
“We have a winner!” Chuck shouts, and Gordon beams, shoulders heaving. Lisa comes over and drapes her arms around his neck before giving him a congratulatory kiss.
liking
“I like it,” Cas says with finality.
“You ever had flan before? Rosa’s is the best.”
And the last thing Dean had expected was for the two of them to go from goddamn
There’s a sudden burst of excited chatter, and Cas cranes his neck to see in front of them. The blue and yellow sign for Athletes’ Village comes into view, and Cas nudges Dean gently.
Cas drops his own hands to Dean’s hips and pulls him close, closing what little space is left between them as he feels Dean’s hand fist in his hair. There’s a spark of electricity wherever Dean goes, a low heat building in Cas’ gut at every touch. He catches Dean’s bottom lip with his teeth and smiles when he hears Dean let out a surprised little yelp.
,” Billie says once Charlie’s given them the thumbs-up that she’s started recording. “There’s drama in
After a few quick adjustments—he likes to think he’s got a good jawline, but it’s not a fucking triangle—he leans back in his chair a little and takes in the drawing. His eyes dart up quickly to make sure none of his students are peeking, and then he quickly scrawls
“So, Novak,” Dean starts. He takes care to keep his tone casual as he slashes his way past overreaching branches lining the road with a thin branch he’d found about a half-mile back. “You ever gonna tell us?”
“Fuck
“Five minutes, I swear.” Once Cas is out in the hallway, Dean flashes him a crooked little grin and closes the door in his face.
“Don’t make me regret this, punks,” he calls as his kids disperse across the grounds, some hunkering down under the trees, others making a beeline for the bleachers by the track a few hundred feet away.
Cas looks up, a little confused. "Me, too?"
Dean furrows his brow, turning his head toward him. “What happened with what?”
“You want one of these?” he asks suddenly, holding the bottle up so Cas can see.
“Honest?” Charlie pauses from filling out her gradebook and leans forward, the pen now between her teeth as she rests her chin in her hands. Dean rolls his eyes, trying to make sure she doesn’t notice the grin that he’s trying to hide.
Dean’s hand never leaves Cas’ for the rest of the walk.
Suddenly, an arm drapes across his shoulders and Cas stumbles as Dean pulls him close, singing loudly next to his ear. His voice is off-key, but something about it makes Cas think that, without the yelling and alcohol, Dean would actually be a good singer. Dean doesn’t seem to care, though; he flashes Cas a crooked grin and raises his beer before launching into the song’s chorus.
Dean points little finger guns at Sam--
Alastair leans heavily on Zachariah before wiping blood from his own mouth with the back of his hand. He stares at Dean and mouths something that the editors have to blur his mouth out for, but makes Dean struggle even harder.
