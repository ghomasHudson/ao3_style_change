Charlie was still staring at him in horror.  “Dean Winchester,” she said.  “You are not seriously telling me that you didn’t know.”
Cas put Willow down.  She started chewing on his thumb.  “Were we still fighting?” Cas said mildly.  The late spring day made Cas’s eyes look so blue.
Dean looked at the ground, the fight going out of him.  The adrenaline had faded.  He was exhausted, and Cas knew that this conversation wasn’t helping.  Dean would probably need a few hours under medical observation after this.  But nothing was going to stop the words spilling from Cas’s lips.
Dean had dreamed of being in Cas’s bed, of mornings he could wake up and see Cas from this angle. He’d dreamed of moments exactly like this, with Cas’s hand on his back and his breath on Dean’s hair, and Dean wanted to savor it before dawn broke, but he couldn’t because -
They slid into the front seat. “Then I’ll tell the realtor to look for some properties near you,” Cas said, knowing full well it wouldn’t appease Dean but still wanting to see his reaction.
Castiel Novak, Dean’s best friend, sighed to Dean’s right.  When Cas sighed, it was always a full-body movement that heralded some sort of rebuke.  Dean was in too good a mood to let that bother him either.
Dean straightened up, his decision made. “Alright, movie night’s canceled,” he proclaimed. He patted his pocket for his phone and wallet, then picked up his keys on the table. “Let’s go for a drive.”
Sam came into view, looking at his phone. “Hey, Cas,” he said, barely looking up from the screen. Cas had the distinct impression he was trying to give Dean some privacy. “Ready, Dean?”
If Cas was saying what Dean thought he was saying, apologies were unnecessary.  Dean tried to say this, but the words caught in his throat, blocked by the lump that had formed.  He did what he could: he reached up, grasped Cas’s upper arm and squeezed.  Dean’s grip was so tight he was sure he was leaving marks, but Cas needed to know that he wasn’t alone in this.
Jack made the cutest ring bearer. Cas was a groomsman, but he’d asked to escort Jack up the aisle, and Sam and Eileen had loved the idea. Dean had loved the idea too, mostly because he knew he wouldn’t have been able to stomach the sight of Cas walking down the aisle in his smartly-tailored suit, arm-in-arm with Eileen’s cousin Sara. In the moment, however, Dean loved the idea simply because Cas was incandescent, smiling widely down at Jack, holding Jack’s hand as the toddler took his too-big, unsteady steps down the garden path.
Dean’s mischievous grin grew a little bashful. He smiled at Cas’s chin. “That’ll work,” he said. Then he grew quiet. Thoughtful. He blinked once, then twice. “I love you too, Cas,” he murmured. His tone was solemn. “Thank you for waiting for me.”
Dean closed his eyes.  His hands were fists at his sides.  “With the way this conversation’s going, I’d be glad with whatever ‘sense of the word’ you want, dude.”
Cas hadn’t known anything besides how much he’d loved Dean. “I didn’t,” he said. “But I loved you. You made me happy. I wanted to make you happy however I could. And that meant waiting.”
“They do come with instructions, Dean; you probably threw them out.” Cas took the bottle and corkscrew from Dean and nudged him away. “Go get the glasses.”
Cas smiled. Sam and Eileen were having a small wedding, so the groom’s party really only consisted of Dean and Cas. They’d had an impromptu bachelor party at their local haunt, and Sam had roped Dean into a drinking game. “Was the drinking game worth it?” Cas asked.
He knows he’ll wake up and this dream, if he remembers it at all, will be disjointed and blurry at best, so he concentrates on capturing as much of it as possible: the warmth and weight of Cas’s leg against his own, the affection twisting Cas’s mouth, the hair that probably hasn’t been touched since Cas got out of bed this morning.
He moves toward the doorway, brushing past Dean, but Dean stops him with a hand to the arm.  “Hold on a minute,” Dean says.
“Novak, if you really believed they were… doin’ the do on the side… you would have said something earlier.  You’re too good of an agent to let that slide.”
“Every single time,” Dean says. Cas’s eyes are barely open so he can’t see Dean’s expression, but he can hear the traces of affection in his voice. “Go faster next time.”
Cas stopped him with a hand to his elbow. “I’ll be here, then.” Dean’s skin was freezing; Cas gripped a little tighter.
three people he’d misjudged, three people whose lives could have been forever changed for the worse if their own smarts hadn’t saved them.
“For fuck’s sake,” Cas mumbled.  “Charlie, we’ll wait for you to get in your car and then I’m taking this idiot home.”
as in Aaron and Dean taking one car when they really should have been taking two separate cars this whole time.
“Up to you, man,” Dean said - the first words he’d said in an hour. “I can turn back or keep driving. I’m happy with either.”
“I have a home here,” Cas said.  He wasn’t looking Dean in the eye.  He kept rearranging the stacks of paper.  “I missed it.”
“You guys bein’ told to evacuate or - or what?” Dean asked over the phone, failing to disguise the tension in his voice.
Cas opens his mouth but he can’t find anything to say.  He had known this moment would come eventually, his eyes having been glued to the TV now for weeks, but here in the moment he can’t quite comprehend it.
“Dean.  Why am I not surprised?”  Amara’s voice was glacial.  “To think we were getting along so well.”
His bedroom is not an escape.  Sam’s call went to voicemail and Dean can’t be bothered to return it.  He sits instead on his bed and stares at his hands, stunned.
A few minutes later, Dean opened the doors and greeted the customers who were waiting outside. There were fewer people coming in, now that the initial excitement around opening had died, but those who did come in were buying larger orders, assured of the quality from their first visit.
Cas being with Daphne would be a problem with Dean.  Dean would spend every day wondering when Daphne would have to leave again, when Cas would fall apart again.  He might never be able to trust Daphne, and
Dean laughs. “Dude, just say you don’t want to kiss me - it’s fine - “ He falters when Cas steps closer, his bravado shuttering.
“I’m hanging up,” Dean said. “And when I hang up, you’re going to get up and get some food. You’re going to take a picture of it and send it to me.”
Dean pressed his cold nose to Cas’s cheek again.  “You should probably join me for bedrest,” he said, his voice a rich murmur.
Cas lingered by the Impala’s trunk and smiled softly at Dean as he approached. “I’m feeling much better than before, Dean. Thank you.”
The indignity of Charlie getting laid while Dean definitely wasn’t, was lessened by the fact that in all honesty, she deserved it.
Dean hopes his fans won’t give him too much shit for what he does next: he pulls Cas in for a rough hug as Cas walks to the touchline to be subbed.  He doesn’t look Cas in the eye, and shoves him away before either of them do something stupid like cry.
As soon as Cas walked into Dean’s apartment, he spotted evidence of a night gone wrong: a scarf and coat in a wrinkled heap in front of the door, an unlaced boot a few feet away, and its pair following an invisible trail to the bathroom. Cas followed the trail, picking up the items as he went, and took a peek in case Dean had made himself cozy on the bathroom floor after heaving his guts out.
“Hey, Dean!” Sam said.  He was holding an exhausted pit bull puppy in his arms.  He made room for Dean right next to him.  “We were about to call you over.”
“I see,” Cas said quietly.  A twinge of pain made him wince.  Then he remembered that he hadn’t heard the most important part of the story, the reason he had a hole in his shoulder in the first place: “So how did you finally figure it out?”
And Cas wasn’t going to ask him to. He and Dean had been dancing around the truth for a while, and the truth was that neither of them had given up on the possibility of a happy ending, though they had both agreed to walk away.
He met up with Charlie a few days later at a local Applebee’s.  Despite heavily hinting to her that she’d be meeting one of his “good friends,” she was dressed in her usual jeans, sneakers, and nerdy T-Shirt.  This particular one read, “What Would Buffy Do?” and had a picture of Sarah Michelle Gellar with her hair in a ponytail.
But Cas continued.  There was a note of amusement in his voice.  “And I think we have an abundance of evidence that suggests that you are definitely
“If you say so,” Cas said, sipping politely at his own drink.  His attention was now on Sam and Eileen, still swaying on the dance floor while other couples began to join them.  Eileen was stifling laughter in Sam’s lapel.  Cas was smiling at them, though he was trying to hide it, but Dean saw through the act anyhow.  The infamous grump Castiel Novak showing his sentimental side - who knew?
figuratively. I think I’m entitled to a little frustration.” He stomped off, probably to sulk on the couch.
Joy suffuses Dean’s veins.  He’s grinning by the time he’s at Cas’s elbow, staring down at a stack of pancakes with a distinct layer of char.  “They’re perfect,” he says, not exactly lying.
“What did she want from you?” Cas asked, breathless, still terrified for Dean even though he was right there in front of him, done with his life away from Cas.
Dean kisses him. It’s just a touch of his lips against Cas’s, small enough to argue that it was barely anything at all, but Cas knows it for what it is: a question he has to answer.
“You know he can’t hear you, right?” Cas said. He felt the heat in his ears as Dean joined him at the door.
that Dean latches on to.  He touches Cas’s shoulder, then drags his hand down Cas’s back, which is covered in Dean’s shirt even though Cas’s own closet was literally ten feet away.  “I’ll teach you,” he says.
“He - he misunderstood a few things about the situation.”  He couldn’t tell her the whole truth.  It may have made him a coward, but he wasn’t going to tell her exactly what Aaron had misunderstood, wasn’t going to tell her that Aaron’s feelings were for
but he was also a little offended. Dean had spent the hours before dinner pacing back and forth in his living room, frantically messaging Sam and then Charlie and even his mom for encouragement, and Cas couldn’t even spare a moment to even
kissing, but Dean, hearing the soft noise of pleasure at the back of Cas’s throat, was eager to get to a point where it was commonplace.  Daily.  Hourly.  Honestly, if they never ever stopped, Dean wouldn’t complain.
Dean motioned to the dance floor in front of them.  “See that?  That’s my brother and his gorgeous new wife.”
The numbers on the invoices were indeed big, frightfully so, but Cas refused to feed Dean’s fears. “The best we can do right now is to make sure the opening’s successful. No use worrying about what’s already done. Let’s direct our attention to preparations instead.”
Cas blinked at the ceiling, helpless and immobile. His chin brushed against Dean’s hair. He could smell Dean’s shampoo and the faint scent of sweat underneath. He clenched and unclenched his hands from where they were held captive at his sides.
Cas put out a hand and placed it on Dean’s forehead, gratified when Dean’s eyes fluttered closed. “Again, you’re hallucinating. Go to sleep.”
Dean was taken aback.  His ears were hot, his eyes damp in mortification.  He tried to respond, but what could he say?  Dean had no defense.
“They think Cas quit his job to help his fiancé Dean realize his dream of opening a bakery.” Claire let the story sink in before adding smugly, “And yet they still come back.”
Cas’s breath against Dean’s collarbone was scorching, and on the next breath, he said, “Yes.  But I want you to touch me too.”
Cas gripped his gun a little more tightly.  He didn’t move, knowing he was listening to the orders of a felon rather than to the director of the FBI and wondering why it didn’t feel more wrong.
Cas took a shaky breath. He cradled Dean’s face. “My love,” he murmured, eyes warm though they were still brimming with tears. “Love of my life.”
“Lunch,” Dean confirmed. He started the car, and sent Cas smiles at every stop for the rest of the drive.
Dean was already settling in with a contented sigh. Cas hated to let him fall asleep in the clothes he’d been wearing, but Dean’s eyes were already fluttering closed. He settled for pulling off Dean’s boots.
“I don’t know if I have time to take a break,” Dean muttered. He looked at the clock on the wall. “I still need to start on the croissants.”
Charlie sounded pleased but embarrassed when she said, “Just a friend for now. I dunno if it’s actually gonna go anywhere.  We’re kind of in the weird is-this-a-date-or-just-two-friends-hanging-out kinda phase.”
Cas got to his feet, heart thundering. He didn’t let go of Dean’s hand. His other hand came up to brace Dean’s elbow. “I don’t want you to have the guest room.” It was absolutely the wrong thing to say, but it was the first thing to come out of his mouth and he couldn’t take it back. He wanted to laugh and cry and scream at the same time.
As he opened the door, he looked back at Cas, in case it would be the last time. Dean committed it to memory: Cas wearing his white button-down, rumpled from his seat belt; tie undone; eyebrows furrowed as he watched his best friend abandon him to the silence of a liar’s apartment.
“One of the reasons?” Dean repeated.  “Is there another secret that I should know about him?”  Dean was being sarcastic, but when Sam hesitated, Dean felt at a loss.  “Shit, Sammy.  What am I missing?”
They finished their burgers and sipped at their sodas. It was when Dean was returning from the trash can that he saw the wistful look on Cas’s face as he listened to the yells and laughter of the kids. He smacked Cas on the arm. “You good?”
“Sounds perfect,” Cas said, for lack of anything else to say, hoping his reticence would kill the conversation because he knew exactly where it was going.
Another stone dropped in Cas’s gut. “Is that so?” he said, a little faintly. “That’s very kind of him.”
Dean’s soft, relieved laugh came out of the blue, but it was more than welcome because Cas was on the verge of crying from the hopes that Dean understood.
“I couldn’t do it,” Cas whispered.  “I meant to.  That’s why I left - to try to get over you and move on with Daphne.  But I couldn’t do it.”
“Yeah, let me just go get the champagne glasses I store here at work,” Dean deadpanned. “Bud, we’re drinking this out of mugs like the heathens we are.”
He might as well have gotten down on one knee. Biting his tongue, Dean returned to the kitchen and resisted the urge to knock himself out with his cast-iron pan.
After the final whistle, Dean jogs to Cas, whose hands are clutching at his hair in disbelief.  Dean puts his hands around Cas’s face, forcing Cas to look at him.  “You okay?”
The ambivalent mask failed, so Cas covered his eyes with a palm. “Dean, if you tell me you have a family hidden somewhere, I swear to god - “
Dean stopped and looked down at his arms.  Three six-packs weren’t heavy.  But he looked up at Cas and saw sincerity in the downturn of his best friend’s mouth.  “Yeah, sure,” he said, and let Cas take one.  “Thanks.”
Cas told himself it was that small sacrifice of Dean’s that made him say, “Sure, if you don’t mind.”
“No,” Cas said, and Dean felt the vice grip around his heart loosen.  “But I want to know.  If it does happen - “
“Honestly? Kinda,” Dean admitted. The smile lines around his eyes deepened. “Wanted you to come in the next day and shove me against a door.”
Sam sighed, and it reminded Dean so much of Cas that his heart started to ache a little bit.  “Alright,” Sam said, “Tell me everything.”
Dean shook his head.  The laughter was very quickly turning into something else entirely - something more wild, something more bitter, something more sad.  “Charlie, I - I think -”
Cas pressed his palms into his eyes and swallowed thickly. “You’ve been lying to me,” he said. His voice shook, but it was fierce. Angry.
Cas started to walk away from the group.  Dean trailed after him.  They wound along the path, dodging bikers and joggers and couples with their fingers intertwined.
Dean had downed half his glass.  He wiped his mouth with his sleeve and made a face.  “That cannot be good for you.”  At Cas’s look, he rolled his eyes.  “Alright, already, I’m sitting down.”  He took the two glasses and set them at Cas’s small dining table.  Then he sat down and stared at the plates.  “Where’d you get these plates, dude?”
The next time Dean saw Cas was a week later, only a few days before Christmas. He knocked on Dean’s door and smiled wanly when Dean let him in.
As soon as Sam was out of sight, Cas covered his eyes with his palm. Panic made him suddenly restless, but he willed himself to sit still.
Instead he grinned and started pulling out of the parking space. “Honestly I don’t get out very often either. The Roadhouse is the only place I know for sure that has burgers worthy of an - well, let’s just say they’re really good burgers.”
Claire barely paid him any attention. She continued scrolling through her phone. “Dean, I’m 18. Also you’re not my guardian.”
Blindly, Cas reached for Dean’s left hand, still a fist by Dean’s hip.  When he found it, he wordlessly guided it to the elastic of his borrowed pajama bottoms.
Cas sent him a picture of a sandwich five minutes later. It was a sad sandwich, but it was a sandwich nonetheless, so Dean just sent a thumbs-up and got back to his own work. For the rest of the week, Cas sent Dean pictures of his food, and Dean did the same for Cas.
“Yeah,” Sam said, “Uh, party’s this Friday. I’ll send you the address. We’d really like it if you stopped by.”
“What’s real?”  Dean leaned down.  He waited for Cas to look at him, then he kissed him.  He would never get tired of it.  “Babe,” he said, indulgent in the afterglow.  “You know me.  You know I’d never make a decision like this without knowing it’s what I wanted.”
Cas didn’t know how long he spent trying to kiss away Dean’s self-doubt. He did know that by the time he got himself to stop touching Dean, the champagne bottle was sitting in a pool of condensation.
Later on, in the parking lot, with Jack asleep in his car seat and buckled safely in the back seat of the Impala, Cas turned to Dean, who had his arm around Cas’s waist.
Dean had already started shedding his apron. “We can close the shop for a few hours,” he’d said, then on his way to hang up his apron, he’d stopped by Cas’s table to kiss him senseless.
Cas stopped him with a hand to the elbow. “I’m volunteering, Dean,” he explained. The concept that he needed to be paid to spend time with his best friend, to help his best friend, to be there for his best friend at a momentous occasion in his life, was absurd. “Supporting my local businesses, as they say.”
That was a strange way of putting it.  “...yeah.  Uh, anyway, you think Charlie needs a drink?  Maybe you should get her one.”
“Well,” Dean said, making up his mind, “Gotta bite the bullet sometime, right?”  And he marched right up to the crowd.
The cooler was right behind Dean, so it’s not like it was much trouble, but Dean was too preoccupied with his thoughts to care.
“Does that mean this is the end of Dean Winchester, the lifelong bachelor?” Cas said, a dry smile making Dean’s knees weak.
Dean’s fingers were still barely grazing Cas’s cheek, like he was scared the bubble of truth they’d made would burst. “And you want - “
Dean met Cas’s gaze, frowning, eyes tired. After a while he gave in. “Fine,” he said. He reached for the plastic wrap. “Two hours.”
Cas closes his eyes and grits his teeth.  He’s probably thinking about the goal Dean had scored just 10 minutes before the final whistle, and how he’d been unable to prevent it.  “I will be.”
As soon as he said it, Cas regretted it, but Bobby just stared at him, unimpressed.  “Seriously?  Years of FBI training, and that’s what you conclude?”
He was still watching when Cas paused at the threshold and looked over his shoulder, eyes careful. “Are you joining me?”
Dean didn’t say anything. He just watched helpelessly as Cas hung up the last ornament in his hand and started toward his bedroom.
It suddenly made sense to Cas why the director so often summoned Dean to her office and why Dean was so willing to go.  Cas waited for a denial but did not get one.  “Right,” he said, once the concept sunk in.  He felt sick.  He looked away, searching for a folder on his desk - any folder - that would give him a reason to leave his desk, leave this office, maybe even leave this whole goddamn forsaken world.
“Are you feeling well?” Cas asked, after he’d set a cornish hen in the middle of the dining table and seated himself. He peered at Dean’s face. “I can’t promise the food is fantastic, but it’s at the very least edible.”
“Sammy picked it out,” Dean said. Revealing that tidbit wasn’t in the plan, but apparently he was on a mission to ruin Christmas in as few words as possible.
Despite himself, Cas envisioned Dean at the barbeque - apron and all - and his stomach flipped. “Is he a good cook?” he found himself asking. His voice sounded like it was coming from a million miles away.
“Took a Lyft,” Cas said, taking the bottle. He didn’t usually drink, but Dean smelled of smoke and cologne and Cas needed something to kill his nerves.
Cas’s smile was sad, so sad.  “Thank you,” he said.  He looked down at his shoes.  Brown.  Sensible.  Just like Daphne’s.  “I missed you.”  Cas’s voice was quiet.
Dean placed them on the countertop. One was from Dean’s trip to Vegas two years ago, and the other was from a Biggerson’s that went out of business last year. Cas poured a hefty helping of champagne into each one. The fizz was loud, even against the backdrop of the bakery’s running fridge.
Dean took a moment to let that sink in.  Then he laughed.  “Cas,” he said, putting his mug down and putting his hand on Cas’s shoulder.  “
The temperature dropped on New Year’s Eve.  In the evening, Cas wrapped himself up in blankets and brought the bottle of scotch whiskey with him to the couch (his bed seemed larger - not to mention colder - than usual lately.)  He brought his phone with him and set it next to him in case Dean called.  He hadn’t heard from Dean since two days before, when Dean had grumbled about Mary’s long to-do list for him and Sam.  “It’s five years’ worth of repairs, and she wants it done in two weeks, Cas,” he’d sighed, right before bed.  “I was supposed to be on vacation.”
“Jesus,” Dean whispered, drawing back.  His eyes were shining, his cheeks were flushed.  “Why didn’t we do this sooner?”  His hands were brands against Cas’s ribs.
Dean opened his eyes and sent her a fierce look.  “My shitty friendship skills are not your fault, Charlie.”
Cas laughed.  “It literally just happened ten minutes ago,” Cas said.  “I barely believe it myself.”
The fierceness in his voice left Cas at a loss, floundering in the sincerity. He couldn’t think of anything else to do other than to do the safe thing and agree, two or three beats too late: “Okay.”
Cas’s soft breath at seeing Dean’s bare torso bolstered Dean’s ego, but still, he felt a flush rise up his neck.  He let Cas look his fill, mostly because he didn’t trust himself to touch Cas and stop.  He dug his fingers into the sheets and didn’t let go.
was the typical choice for an occasion like this, but Cas hadn’t spoken a kind word to Dean in almost 3 years.  Could he start now?
Dean was beaming. He was absolutely radiant. Cas couldn’t believe that his words had made him so happy. Dean was taking in Cas’s face, every detail; Cas would have felt self-conscious but Dean’s expression was so hopeful, more hopeful than Cas had ever seen him in their years-long friendship.
that was a problem for Dean.  But he knew the answer Cas wanted to hear.  But he’d never been able to lie to Cas, not with any success.  “I don’t know,” he finally admitted.  Then, truthfully, he said, “But I’ll try to be okay with it.  If it happens.”
He dreams for a day he and Cas share a kitchen that belongs to both of them, in a house that they paid for, not as roommates but as something infinitely more lasting.  He dreams for breakfast and lunch and every casual touch in between.  He even dreams for more clogged sinks and creaky cabinets, if only because Cas wanting it fixed would mean he wants to stick around.
Dean looked down at the stretched neckline. He cleared his throat. “You planning on making a habit of that?”
“Dumbass still has a Christmas tree up,” Dean said, leaning heavily into Cas as he gestured with an unsteady hand toward the Christmas tree in the corner. “You see this shit, Cas? It’s fuckin’ February.”
Sam was the first to see him from amid a circle of about 8 people. He excused himself and rushed over, pumping Cas’s hand once before putting a hand on his shoulder and guiding him toward the food. “Glad you could make it, man. Grab some food and then join us, alright?”
Cas was shaking. Fumbling a little bit, frantic, he guided one of Dean’s hands up to his face. Dean’s hands were rough against Cas’s cheek, but it was that roughness - evidence of hard work and love and effort - that Cas had fallen in love with in the first place. He turned to kiss Dean’s palm despite the terror he felt that he might be misunderstanding. Against Dean’s skin, he said, “I get it,” and hoped he wasn’t lying.
Cas looked up at the ceiling. His eyes were as shiny as glass. “I understand that. But I still feel like a fool, Dean.”
Cas’s fingers itched to touch Dean’s face.  He curled them into his palms.  “We closed ten cases with what you learned.”
Cas put a hand over his eyes again and took a deep breath. The thought of seeing Dean again, the thought of being in his space again, the thought that Dean
Daphne ushered Gilda forward, and Gilda extended a long, graceful hand toward Dean.  Dean took it.  She really was a beautiful woman.  “Nice to meet you,” Dean said, and it was a genuine statement.
Leaving the sight of Dean in his bed was difficult, but Cas managed it somehow. He started coffee and then breakfast, and by the time he’d begun frying the eggs, he’d almost forgotten how much he’d yearned to kiss Dean awake, to wrap himself up in the covers with Dean so they’d be pressed together for the rest of the morning -
After, they slept.  Then Cas woke Dean up in the middle of the night and told him, in very direct terms, that Dean needed to call in tomorrow because Cas had some very specific plans.  Most of the plans involved staying in bed and decidedly
“You may remember that I am not exactly a fan of your plan, so forgive me if I wasn’t as enthused as you might have preferred.”
Dean’s answer was slow to come, but the stubborn set of his jaw and the furrow of his brow told Cas that Dean wasn’t going to let this go easily. Eventually, Dean said in a slow, measured tone: “I’m telling you that one day I might find that I value a person’s company over what they can give me in bed.”
Finally Sam cleared his throat. “D- Uh, Dean wants to see you there. Just… y’know, just so you know.”
Dean couldn’t stop the oath that fell from his lips.  “Yeah,” he said, unable to stop himself from sounding desperate.  “How?  How do you want me to touch you?”
Eileen texted later that week that she and Sam were having a small barbeque with their friends and family at their new place.  She invited Dean and told him that Cas had already told her he would be there, then followed up that text with a kissy face and the words
The preparation of breakfast takes either five seconds or five minutes.  Dean’s head is still fuzzy, and it seems like between one blink and the next he’s finished folding Cas’s omelette and toasting Cas’s bread.
“Coming right up,” Dean said, already on the way to the stove. His heart was full, simply because Cas had something he wanted and it was something Dean could provide.
Cas finally looks up at him.  “You changed my life, Dean,” he says, as if messages like that are meant to be dropped over a plate of eggs and ketchup.
Cas shook his head, but the smile burst through anyway.  He quickened his pace and knocked on Sam’s door before Dean could rub it in.  By the time Dean caught up to him, Sam was opening the door, Eileen poking her head under his arm in curiosity.
Cas took his time setting the dish down.  “Well, I assume I’ll be living past just this one Christmas and that I’ll be using them next year.”
“Dean?” It was beginning to sink in, and Dean could see it. Cas’s eyes were wide and wary. “What’s going on?”
but it sounded hollow.  There was no way Cas had missed Dean as much as Dean had missed Cas.  “Not as much as I missed you, dude.”
Charlie put a hand on his back.  “Does it make you feel better that I’m not actually attracted to you, though?”
The booth was not conducive for socializing - not the kind of socializing Dean wanted, anyway, because while Sam would have been glad to talk Dean’s ear off about his practice, Dean was determined to get Gilda alone (or as far away from Cas as possible, because there was something that rubbed him the wrong way about chatting a girl up with Cas
Cas let the moment sink in.  When he squeezed Dean’s hand and felt Dean squeeze in return, he couldn’t resist a smile.  He dared to move closer, and when Dean didn’t move away, Cas licked his lips.
“Maybe he’s loosened up,” Aaron said noncommittally.  “Anyhow, Charlie, uh, tell me about yourself.”
Cas reached forward and took the other hand, trembling on her lap.  “Mary,” he said gravely.  He took a deep breath.
Mary tried to catch her breath.  Her smile was wobbly.  “I knew it would happen,” she said shakily.  She reached for Dean, and Dean, relieved, let her fall forward and embrace him.  “I’m so happy for you,” she said, sniffling.
Cas tried to shrug in nonchalance, though he was distracted by Dean’s lips, mere inches away.  “Merry Christmas.”
Charlie gave a small shrug.  “Gilda’s been saying that Daphne’s parents might be convinced to move back here.  It might actually work out.”
Sam ran a hand over his mouth like he was trying to stop himself from saying anything else, but Sam was nothing if not nosy. “We both know never’s not an option. It’s gotta be now, Dean. Or if not now, then soon. You’re already playing house with Cas. Plus there’s a kid involved now - a kid who absolutely adores you - so I hate to say it, but if things have to go south, it has to happen before Jack’s any older.”
Cas stares at the back of Dean’s head, trying to figure out the reason behind his behavior.  Then it hits him.  “But before that you have three weeks stuck in your apartment.”
Cas moved near him.  His arm brushed Dean’s as he started straightening the papers.  “The three weeks away were productive,” he said.
When Cas removed his hands, his eyes were tired but they were at least dry. He caught sight of the paper. “What is this?” he asked, picking it up. He read the title page:
Dean was tired and buzzed from two thumbs of whiskey. “It was pretty good,” he said, staring at the opposite end of the couch where Cas’s near-constant present had made an indent in the cushion.
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose, trying for irritated but in reality wanting to sink through the floor, maybe fold into himself into such tiny pieces he can float down into the drain with the water leaking from the faucet.  “If denying it were a plausible option, trust me, I’d take it.  But it’s obvious, isn’t it?  All I
There was silence from behind Cas, during which Dean probably gave himself a good sniff. “Shower’s probably a good idea,” he eventually mumbled.
Dean sighed.  “I took the pie out of Mom’s oven and then I remembered - it reminded me of you.  And I just - I said bye to Mom and took off.”
A few moments later, though, a minute furrow appeared between Cas’s brow, one that grew until it was apparent that whatever he was thinking was going to cause Dean no small amount of pain.  Cas licked his lips, nervous, then let out what Dean assumed to be a steadying sigh.
Dean was already composing one in his head about the warm expanse of Cas’s skin, the warmth in his eyes. “I think I can manage that.”
“Self-awareness, Dean!” Cas interrupted.  His cheeks were pink, and he pressed his lips together after his outburst.  More controlled, he added, “You’ve analyzed everybody else’s lives down to the molecule when you should have been taking a look at yourself and the thoughtless way you act.  The way your thoughtlessness affects other people.  You decided what was best for Charlie without her knowledge, thinking you knew better, but your arrogance kept you from seeing any other possibility besides the one you deemed suitable.  And you were breaking her heart the whole time.”
he found that his imagination had gotten all the more torturous.  If he’d gone with Dean, it would have been so easy to find a quiet corner and talk, to soak up the atmosphere, to laugh softly at drunk relatives and brush elbows and -
Something about the look she gave him made Cas feel weirdly protective.  He shoved the feeling to the side and buried it deep.  “He’s… doing what’s been asked of him.”
After cleaning up the kitchen, Cas went to check on his patient and found Dean under the covers. He still looked exhausted, but he seemed at least a little less in pain. His eyes were closed, and the blanket was pulled up to his chest.
“Cas, I have to tell you something.” He said it before he could change his mind, because if he didn’t say it now, it would never be said.
The accusation that this was somehow Dean’s fault made irritation flare up in Dean.  “The hell you saying?”
was for her to leave him again.  He’d been acting so stonily toward her not in expectation of her leaving, but to
“Earlier I said marriage wasn’t in the cards for me,” Cas explained, smiling widely, apparently pleased that he was making Dean cry so much. “I don’t want you to misunderstand - it’s in the cards if it’s you.”
Cas took the drawing from Dean’s fingers.  “Inspiration isn’t practical,” he said gently.  “I’ll tell you about the story one day.”  He tucked the drawing away and picked up his mug.  He leaned his hip on the table and looked at Dean.  He seemed to be
Charlie’s devastated face told him she already knew.  “Oh, my poor bisexual boy,” she crooned.  “I am so sorry.”
By the end of the day Cas had had enough of the tension - in a short while he’d be at home alone with his thoughts, and he didn’t need another thing weighing on his shoulders. He knocked on Sam’s open door as Sam was packing up.
Dean stared at him, eyebrows knitting together. Then he shook his head. “I’m dead on my feet and this conversation’s goin’ over my head. Can we talk tomorrow? I’m gonna head out.”
Cas wants the sounds even closer. He wants Dean’s footsteps in his bedroom, Dean’s murmur from the pillow next to his, Dean’s music from the nightstand while he gets ready for bed. He wants the noises of a lifetime of routine, the noise of a life with Dean in it.
Sam threw his head back in laughter while Dean rolled his eyes. Eventually he handed over the bowl of brocolli to Cas with a sarcastic, “Here,
As he stares, he hears a familiar sound.  Somewhere in the apartment, somewhere in their tiny little kitchen, there is the sound of cooking.  Someone is cooking.  No one but Dean ever cooks in this apartment.
But Cas had already pulled out two bottles from the fridge and was nudging one at Dean’s elbow. “I’ve always wanted to know what we could accomplish drunk.”
“He wanted to do the job right.  He figured we needed a way to bait her, but we needed to do it securely.  …That’s when I came in”
Sam sighed heavily, but he shut up.  He followed Dean into the kitchen.  Right before Dean opened the back door, however, Sam made a tentative noise.  “Before you open that door - “ he started, but Dean was already holding up a hand.
Dean’s eyes were already closed, but there was a quirk of contentment in his lips when he flung an arm over Cas’s stomach and let his head fall onto Cas’s shoulder.
Cas begins to dice the onion. He’s never been great with a knife but this time, with Dean’s eyes on the back of his neck, he’s somehow even worse. It takes forever, and by the time forever has passed, Cas’s eyes are irritated from slicing the onion.  Dean snorts at him when Cas turns around, eyes squinted, to wash his hands and rinse out his eyes.
Dean waved away Cas’s concern. “Don’t worry ‘bout it,” he said. Truthfully, he’d purposely dodged the question, but apparently making friends meant getting to know each other. “I’m a - an editor. I freelance, mostly.”
Gilda seemed unaffected.  “I hope you’re enjoying the nice weather, though,” she said, responding to his smile with one of her own.
Dean smiled. They were sitting so close he barely had to pull Cas forward before their lips met in a hesitant kiss.
Cas breathed in slowly, held the breath, then let it out.  He was not going to let Dean see any moment of weakness.  When the group arrived at his desk, he stood up and acknowledged the director first and nobody second.  “Director.”
“It was a nice dream,” Dean had said, a little wistfully. Then he had looked at Cas like he did whenever Cas brought him coffee in bed: lovesick, indulgent, grateful.
Claire hadn’t been able to get a flight in time for the opening, but she’d helped by taking over the social media accounts from Cas, who admittedly had had trouble keeping up with concepts like “the algorithm” and “engagement.” Many customers who came in on the first day were there thanks to her.
Cas sighed again, like kissing Dean was a chore.  By the time he leaned in, however, his hand was in Dean's and he was suppressing a smile.
Dean bit down on a scowl.  It was true, but it didn’t make the sentiment any less real.  “More than enough time to know I don’t want to spend the rest of my life without you.”
He let the conversation lapse into silence as he cast his mind for a way to soothe his wounded pride.  Eventually he called for another flute of champagne, and when the waiter brought it to him, Cas’s face pinched, but he didn’t say a word.  Dean counted that as a win.
They returned to the reception a few minutes later. Eileen, upon seeing Cas’s glossy eyes and pink nose, instinctively grabbed a butter knife to throw at Dean’s throat, but Sam tugged her arm down and pointed at Dean and Cas’s joined hands.
Dean dropped the ornament in his hand in his shock. It bounced once and rolled underneath the tree.  He didn’t bother picking it up because Cas was already walking into the bedroom. In a daze, heart in his throat, Dean followed.
Around them, other agents were processing the scene.  Dean doubtless needed to offer a statement, but nobody was approaching just yet.
As Dean pulled out into traffic, he tried to puzzle out what bothered him about Aaron’s answer.  It was phrased strangely, somehow, like Aaron had run the sentences through a series of languages on Google Translate and then turned it back into English.  The reply had made perfect sense, but something about it wasn’t quite right.
Dean shook his head and sniffed, laughed through the tears when Cas’s mouth opened again to speak.  “Stop,” Dean said.  “You’re repeating yourself.”
Cas remembered, alright. He shook his head, bemused. “I don’t recall you doing anything you need to apologize for.”
As he walked to the elevator, he tried to calm his suspicions: it was most likely the director, after all.  There was no solid evidence that indicated that it might be anybody but her.  Still, Cas wanted to make sure.  He hadn’t gotten this far in his career ignoring his intuition.
“What is it?” he asked, nervously uncapping and capping the pen in his hand. It was the end of the day, and he could feel his lower back protesting from being seated all day; he just wanted to go home and soak in a warm bath.
He didn’t know what this meant, but he was willing to bet that very few people would leave their families on a whim just to see their best friend 1500 miles away.  He’d never let himself believe that Dean might return his feelings - not because there weren’t signs, but because it was simply too good to be true.  To love Dean and to be loved back by Dean?  Cas’s life couldn’t possibly be so good.
They didn’t talk much, but Cas was comfortable. He liked this: sitting by Dean in a moment of peace and contentment. If he let himself, he could picture it for himself for a long while to come.
Dean nearly dropped his phone. “Hey,” he said, a little too loudly and a little too quickly. “You - you saw my note.”
Cas’s mouth lifted at the corner, but Dean knew it was just for show. “I don’t think marriage is in the cards for me, Dean,” Cas admitted.
Dean wasn’t able to formulate a quick enough response to that, but a sticker on the car he assumed was hers gave him a smooth segue.  “I like Hermione too.”
Cas has spent the last 45 minutes watching Dean’s hands under the guise of health and hygiene.  “I’m getting used to it,” he says.
Cas stared at the hand in Dean’s shirt for a long moment.  Dean didn’t know whether he wanted Cas to move away or to lean in more, but he knew that if Cas didn’t make a move in either direction soon, Dean would combust.  He was about to say so, had opened his mouth to say so, but then Cas was taking a steadying breath and tugging the shirt up, eventually getting Dean to lift his arms so he could remove the shirt entirely.
Dean looked down at his hands.  One was in his lap and the other was feeling the fabric of the hospital sheets underneath his fingers.  Doubtless he was thinking of the things he’d done while he was away.  “I don’t know if it’s even possible to be like we were before,” he finally said.  He looked at Cas then, very seriously.  “And… we really don’t
They went into the house and started getting ready for bed.  Dean handed Cas a toothbrush still in its packaging, and later, when Cas had finished brushing his teeth, Dean stood and stared helplessly at the toothbrush leaning against his in the little mug by the tap, wondering if he’d ever get used to the sight.
Cas was smiling when he answered. “It’s fine, Dean. The wind’s only slightly worse than a regular storm.”
“Jackass,” Dean said, though the twitch of his mouth gave his affection away.  “What if I died tonight and you never wished me a Merry Christmas?”
Bobby was the only one who didn’t shed a tear at Dean and Cas’s news.  He called both of them idjits for waiting so long and shook Cas’s hand, but besides that, he had nothing else to say, though Dean caught him looking their way more than once with shiny eyes, so he supposed it was something.
Cas looked at his door, still closed to his colleagues. Outside, to the left, somewhere down the hall in Sam’s office, was Dean, probably sitting on the corner of Sam’s desk. Waiting. Waiting for Cas to persuade Sam to take a break but maybe also waiting for Cas himself. Just Cas. Cas and all his complexities and cat emojis and conflicted feelings.
“You don’t have to believe me,” Cas said dismissively.  He checked his phone.  “Bobby’s coming by to babysit you.”
Cas was realizing all at once that all of his stifled daydreams need not be stifled any longer. They didn’t even need to be daydreams any longer, either. He kissed Dean again, just because he could. Then he smiled at Dean’s smile and took Dean’s hand, leading him in his bunny slippers to the bed. “You need to sleep.”
Gilda reached across Aaron to touch Dean on the arm.  “Dean,” she said, “Thank you for the drink.  I’ll see you both later.”
Picking Cas up from the airport was an ordeal, mostly because the relief at seeing Cas in his passenger seat made Dean a little lightheaded in the middle of airport traffic.
Dean took a long, long draft of his beer as he watched Daphne reacquaint herself with the people she’d almost called family two years ago.  “I dunno, mom,” he said.  “I just hope he knows what he’s doing.”
They stared at each other from across the shopfront for a few long seconds. Not for the first time that day, Cas marveled at the beauty of Dean Winchester, even sweat-stained and tired, even standing there dumbfounded and looking like an idiot.
Dean kissed him softly, just once, in reply.  He was tired, and Cas’s shoulder still twinged.  There were nights that it seemed they couldn’t ever get close enough, but on this night they slept.
“But at the same time you challenge me,” Cas continues, still chewing, “in the best ways possible.  It wouldn’t be a particularly healthy relationship if we didn’t make each other better, after all.”
II. 	Director Singer had retired two months prior to Dean’s return, and Special Agent Amara Shurley had been promoted to his former position.  Six months on, Cas acceded that she was capable and would very likely come into her own given enough time.  That didn’t mean, of course, that Cas knew or understood why she insisted on
Cas didn’t bother to hide his amusement. He put the bottle on the counter and picked up another filled with amber liquid. “So I guess I won’t offend you when I bring this out later instead.”
He takes the spatula from Cas’s loose grip.  “They’re perfect,” he said again, “but they’re not edible.”  An itch takes residence in his throat.  He coughs.
“He’ll come around,” the realtor said when she caught Cas watching him. “I’m glad he at least walked in the door.”
He spent the rest of the ride wondering how to bring up his suspicions without offending Aaron.  By the time he pulled up in front of Aaron’s apartment, however, mortification had sealed his lips shut.
Dean touched his forehead to Cas’s, so happy he could barely get any words out. “Cas, you know it’s a yes.”
Cas kept going, a snowball gaining momentum, cold and dangerous.  The words were ice on the tip of his tongue.  “You’ve probably wondered why I haven’t asked why you did what you did.”
Dean never gives that question any attention in real life.  There’s too much mess in that world, too many questions already, and no room for one as big as
Cas was breathing slowly and heavily on Dean’s neck.  When Dean started stroking, he heard Cas’s voice wrecked, destroyed: “love you, love you” and Dean turned his face into Cas’s hair and whispered it back, ignoring the way his voice cracked, concentrating instead on the twist of his wrist, the way Cas’s breath quickened when Dean swiped at the precome at the head of his dick, the way Cas’s hips started jerking forward.
X. 	Director Shurley started receiving flowers on a frequent basis.  Cas didn’t believe they were from Dean, but after the 5th time in a month, Cas really needed to know.  Cas ignored Bobby’s voice in his head calling him an idiot as he intercepted one of the orders before it was delivered to her.  He plucked the card out to read it.
It was when they were on the front steps and Dean was lifting his hand to knock that Claire’s hand shot out to grab his wrist.
Charlie already had a beer open.  She tilted her head at him.  “I couldn’t stay mad at you,” she said.  She walked off to her couch, clearly expecting Dean to follow.  “Especially since you had no idea why.”  The look she sent over her shoulder was sly.  It made Dean feel a little better, if more than a little confused.
Cas puts the spices down and stares at them, hands on hips.  He must looked stumped because Dean clears his throat and says, “Onion.”
And if Cas were being honest with himself, the thought of being rejected by Dean - beautiful, charismatic, kind Dean - that was a little tough to swallow.
The image of Cas holding up a bottle of Dean’s favorite brand of whiskey was going to be branded into Dean’s brain through to the new year. Dean gulped.
It’s difficult, because Dean’s head has started to throb despite his best efforts.  He wants to go back to sleep, but ironically that would mean waking up.
The loss is a difficult one to take; it means that Cas and his team are now on the bottom half of the league table, a position they haven’t been in for well over a decade.
And beyond Dean’s worry about Cas was his worry for Charlie.  He still didn’t quite understand where he had gone wrong.  Could it be true that Charlie had feelings for Dean?  It didn’t feel remotely possible, but when Dean dialed Charlie’s number, it went straight to voicemail, and it was obvious that Charlie didn’t want to speak with him.
Cas had some time ago left Dean to his drinking and gone to speak to Eileen’s parents, and he had been conveniently replaced by Dean’s mom.  He nudged her.  “Who’s that?” he asked.
They ended up in the backyard, sitting on the grass, throwing a too-big tennis ball for Willow the puppy and watching her stumble after it.  The fences needed some new paint, Dean noted, but the yard was tended and Eileen had even started planting some flowers.  Another wave of affection for his family hit him.  He started laughing.
Cas didn’t say anything. When Dean returned, holding a stack of paper from his desk drawer, Cas still had a hand over his face.
Gilda smiled at him and reached up to touch his hair gently.  There was movement behind her - someone was getting up from the blanket - but Dean was too surprised by the feeling of Gilda’s hand near his ear that all he could do was gape.  Then Gilda said, very kindly, so softly no one else could hear, “Sorry, but no.”
Dean’s tirade faltered. His throat bobbed. There was a faint sheen of sweat on his brow from the heat of the ovens. “What?”
“Shit,” Dean said, recalling the rest of the night.  His migraine throbbed when he laughed bitterly at himself.
There was no misunderstanding what Dean meant. Despite the numbing cold, Cas’s cheeks tingled. His stomach flipped. He reached for words - any words - because now Dean was waiting on a response, and Cas was
Eventually Dean took Cas’s advice and took a serving of the cough syrup.  It took care of the cough, knocked him out within a few minutes, and apparently had enough kick still left in it in the morning to convince Dean that he’d woken up into a dream.
Dean smiled, if only because Cas was beginning to sound like himself again.  “You think I like when you’re moping around?”
For the first time since the conversation started, Dean felt a smile tug at his lips.  Gilda would be perfect for cheering Charlie up.  “Sweetheart, that’s a great choice.  Let me get you her number.”
“We were planning on going out for lunch,” Sam called over his shoulder.  He was walking to the kitchen.  “You’re welcome to join us.”
Dean swiped at his eyes stubbornly. “Cas, I meant it when I said I’d do anything for that kid. If he ever loses you, he’s going to have me. Don’t even think about apologizing for that.”
Charlie had been pulling her arm back for another hit, but she stopped.  “True,” she conceded.  “But come on.  I wasn’t hiding it from you!”
Dean’s soft sigh made Cas look up. Dean had put down the lemon bar and was staring down at the shortbread dough in front of him, looking lost. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “I’m going overboard. And I’m exhausted.”
Cas didn’t say he preferred it too, that he’d much rather spend his days within arm’s reach of Dean instead of in front of a computer screen, thinking about Dean. He figured it had to be pretty obvious anyhow. “Didn’t you promise me alcohol?”
He pressed a hand over his eyes when Dean sent a smiley face back. Through Cas’s panic he tried to remind himself that this date wasn’t the end of the world, and it probably wasn’t even the end of their friendship. Maybe the date would go poorly and Dean would decide on his own that they wouldn’t work romantically. Sometimes dates just didn’t work, after all - that was the whole point of dates, wasn’t it? Dates weren’t always the first step to a long-term relationship. Sometimes they were blips in a lifetime of blips - some good and some bad, some memorable and some forgettable. To a man like Dean especially, a date might just be what he did on a regular Saturday night to kill his boredom. There was no reason to panic.
Dean looked away, into a corner.  His eyes were glossy.  “Yeah, well, you were too busy being shot.”
Dinner was… easy. Being with Dean was easy. Easy enough that Cas forgot that he was supposed to be making it difficult. Instead he found himself leaning forward to hear Dean’s stories, smiling when he smiled, and laughing when he laughed. Dean was magnetic, and he was in a good mood. He seemed to want to know about Cas and his life and his family, and he eagerly expounded when Cas asked questions right back.
“That’s a good book,” he said, nodding to the hardcover in the man’s hand. “You ever read anything else by Campbell?”
lying,” Cas accuses.  He looks at Dean with narrowed eyes, but the effect is lessened by the way his gaze slips down to Dean’s lips.
She handed Cas a thick stack of folders.  “We’ve reopened a few cold cases based off of the leads he’s given us.  Work him over.  Use him where you need to.  If he’s uncooperative, he knows where he’ll be spending the next few decades.”
For days, Cas successfully avoided Dean.  Dean had been moved into his new safehouse, so Cas didn’t need to worry about being cornered at home, but avoiding Dean at the office was never going to work forever.  Eventually the director asked what progress had been made on the next case and Cas had no answer for her, so he finally settled down at his desk, where Dean had been solving and resolving a Rubik’s cube for hours.
There was another round of laughter in the background.  “I miss you,” Cas said, tilting his head back onto the arm of his couch and staring the ceiling fan, immobile.  “I didn’t think I’d miss you so much.”
Dean handed him a napkin, waved off Cas’s thanks, then scratched his neck. “When I gave the key to you I kind of figured you’d use it for…” He made a vague gesture, but let his sentence trail off.
It felt like an olive branch.  An apology that Cas couldn’t give with Mary and Daphne in the same room.  Dean took it all the same.  Maybe one day they’d be friends again.  The way they had been before Charlie, before Aaron, before Daphne came back.  He could only hope so.
“I’ve known you were it for me since I let you drive Baby three years ago. If that’s even remotely true for you too, then just think about it, alright? You don’t have to answer right now. But I wanted you to know.” Between them, Dean tangled his fingers with Cas’s and squeezed. “I love you and I’m proposing. It’s there if you want it.”
Dean sat up.  He touched Cas’s face, looked down to where the flush was almost down to Cas’s navel.  He was in love with Cas.  And he was going to marry Cas, if Cas said yes.  “Cas, will you marry me?”
Cas settled against the arm of the sofa and smiled. “You know I never regret spending time with you.”
Dean left the remote where it was and sat up straighter on the couch, nestling the phone more securely against his ear.  “Dude, you’re freaking me out here,” he said.
“I mean.  I just want to clear the air.  You weren’t answering your phone.  I - I said something stupid and it was...dumb.”
“Brought you Christmas gifts,” Cas said, pulling things from his coat pockets. “Antacids and painkillers. I’ll make you some toast to go with it.”
It meant to hear Cas out when he needed to lighten his load, and to hope that the relief Cas would find in telling his secret would bind Dean’s heart tightly enough it would stop bleeding before Cas noticed.
XIII. 	Cas’s ride was late.  After he’d blacked out in the director’s office, he’d been taken to the hospital to get patched up: painkillers, bullet removal, stitches, dressing, and a sling.  That had taken an hour.  After, he’d tried and failed to take a nap and instead wheedled a meal out of a passing nurse.  Still the department vehicle hadn’t arrived to take him back to the office despite Cas’s repeat phone calls.
Dean started walking Claire through the basics of the register. He was only about halfway through when she interrupted him, looking between Dean and Cas with amusement.
Cas could feel Sam watching him but he pretended to be heavily invested in the conversation his co-workers were having, though for the life of him he couldn’t remember the topic.
Dean didn’t make a move to serve himself a slice of pie.  He was staring instead at Cas.  “That line went around the block, dude.”
Cas was silent for a beat, then another. Eventually he said, “I don’t know where you keep the honey,” which was answer enough.
There was a smile in the man’s voice. “It did. I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed it. You have good taste.”
“Anyway,” Dean said, after clearing his throat.  He looked around quasi-casually.  “I should probably go.”
“I know,” Dean says. He closes the fridge and then pops the top off of his beer to take a long swig. When he’s done, he just looks at Cas and blinks.
did pretty well.”  Cas dared to reach up and touch Dean’s cheek, rewarded when Dean’s face flushed a little pinker.
Dean had already seen that Cas and Daphne hadn’t arrived yet.  Good.  “Yeah,” Dean mumbled.  “You want a beer?”
Cas’s voice was rough when he answered, but just the fact that he answered warmed Dean’s heart.  “Hey,” Dean said.
Dean was frowning at Cas’s discomfort.  He made a movement to touch Cas on the arm, but he pulled his hand back.  He looked away, embarrassed.  “Apparently betraying the country is the family business,” he explained.  “I couldn’t figure out how, or even if, she was communicating with her contacts.  Then the flowers from her brother started coming, but of course no one ever let the neighborhood felon near them.”
“I didn’t think it’d be about me,” Cas corrected. He smiled. “But yes, I didn’t think it’d be good.” He paused. A furrow appeared between his brow. “I also didn’t think you’d secretly be a popular published sci-fi author.”
Her perfume was floral - but it was deep and slightly herbal, without the cloying sweetness of most, and it made Dean a little groggy.  He could feel eyes on him and bitterly, without knowing why, he wished it was Cas watching him.  He leaned in to Gilda.  “Have a lot on my mind,” he said, and he threw in a small quirk of his mouth for good measure.
“My head’s killing me,” Dean groaned, pulling the blankets over his head. “Make sure Sam chooses a good picture of me for my funeral.”
But Dean just winks and points up toward the ceiling where the mistletoe mocks Cas and his hopeless attraction to his best friend.  “Pucker up, buddy,” Dean says, just to hammer it home.
Dean nudged him with an elbow, grinning when he saw a hint of a smile at the corner of Cas’s mouth.  “Oh, I dunno,” he said.  “What was it you said last night?  You’d give up everything for me?  You don’t have the words to tell me how much you love me?”
“Let me say this, Cas,” he said earnestly. He scrubbed at his nose. “I mean, when you met me I was just a dumbass mechanic who’d just gotten his GED. You were,” he motioned to Cas in his button-down and business pants. “
Dean’s foot shifted. Cas knew this because it made Dean’s leg knock against his. “Be like what?” Dean asked. He seemed soft, softer even than when he’d asked Cas out, though Cas assumed it was probably because they’d both been drinking.
Dean’s jaw was still slack, his brow slightly furrowed. Cas saw the conflict on his face and took a deep breath. “I mean this as a date,” Cas added. “Just to clarify.”
Dean took a deep breath. The pungent scent of alcohol and sweat filled his nostrils, but underneath he also smelled Cas’s detergent, sweet and clean. He took another deep breath.
“I was convinced by then that I’d never be with you,” Cas explained.  “You were flirting with Gilda, and you’d… never shown me any interest.”
Cas was on the other line, as they had planned.  “It’s an emergency,” Cas said blandly.  “Oh, no.  Whatever will we do?  Willow has gotten out of the house.  She has gone missing.  Oh, no.”
A few hours later, Dean found his car keys and donned his coat - thick, dark blue, a gift from Sam and Eileen that Cas always silently thanked them for because Dean looked so good in blue and Dean always seemed more confident in it.
Dean’s only insistence regarding decor was that they hang up pictures of his family. “Ain’t Winchester Bakery without these people,” he’d said, handing Cas a box of framed photos.
Dean couldn’t figure out why Cas was acting so strangely, but he decided not to ask. He walked to the fridge and drew out two beers. “Looks like we have something to celebrate tonight, then,” he said, as he popped them open. He handed one to Cas. “What’s your next move?”
Cas lifted his eyes to the playground again. “No doubt at least a few of these children believe in Santa.” He sucked some stray ketchup off his thumb, and Dean had to look away.
Mary furrowed her brow.  “I don’t think I was listening very much when we were introduced.  It started with a G, I think.  Glinda?  Gladys?  Why?” Mary said, sending a cheeky smile her son’s way.  “She’s cute, isn’t she?”
And those three people didn’t even include Dean himself, the person who, arguably, Dean had misjudged the most.  It was, after all, his lack of self-awareness that had started this whole situation.  It had led him into the dangerous quagmire of making himself to be Charlie’s mentor when, in fact, she had not needed one, and when, in fact, he was probably the last person she would have needed if she had.  That, in turn, had led Dean into calling Aaron and then eventually disappointing somebody who had only ever tried to be what Dean wanted.
Dean’s mask slipped a little.  His throat bobbed.  “You know,” he said quietly, “I’m so happy I think I might actually be hallucinating.”
“This place is way too big and way too far,” Dean cut in, almost like if he spoke fast enough Cas’s answer wouldn’t count. He fished his keys out of his pocket.
“Half past 10, relax.”  Dean’s voice was lower than usual, a little slower and a little rougher.  And he still hadn’t let go of Cas’s hand, instead letting their linked hands sink to the space between their thighs.  “I’ve been up for a while, had some coffee.  Thanks, by the way.”
Cas knew he’d need to be patient. Luckily he had practice. Luckily he had Dean. “I’d have missed out on this, then,” he said, running a hand over Dean’s back. “Not sure I’d give this up for anything.”
Dean’s smile was pleased. “That’s a ginger ale for me then,” he said, clapping Cas on the shoulder before leaving to get one from the cooler. His hand lingered a second longer than it had reason to.
When he spoke again, his voice was shaky. “This - all of this - when you left you said you had something to tell me, but you told me nothing.
He picked up the menu in front of him.  It was sticky.  Dean winced both at the stickiness and at the contents of the menu; what was wrong with a plain whiskey, and why did people insist on sticking herbs in everything?
Dean knows it’s a dream almost as soon as he opens his eyes.  The ceiling spins above him, and everything around him - his sheets, his pillow, the clothes on his body - are so heavy he feels like he’s moving through sand.
“Do you want to keep touching me?” Dean asked, and hearing the words said out loud made them sound even dirtier than he intended.
Cas was cold and confused, and growing colder and more confused by the second. Brow furrowed, he said, stiltedly, “I’m glad you didn’t.”
Claire was still glaring at them on the front step of the house. She hadn’t released Dean’s wrist yet. “What the fuck is in the house, then?” she demanded.
Dean conceded Cas’s point with a tilt of his head after spending a few seconds contemplating it. He continued to take tentative sips of his sports drink. Cas retrieved the other slice of toast from the bedroom and when he made it back across the football-field-length, forced the plate into Dean’s hands. He watched as Dean ate it, his hand hovering at Dean’s back, but not quite touching. Only after he’d eaten did Cas send him back to his bedroom.
Dean decided to help her out a little.  “If you’re free after this, do you wanna grab a drink?”  Once the words were out, he was struck by how much he
Cas closed his eyes.  He felt his face heat.  He couldn’t find anything to say in reply.  “I - I don’t have anything prepared.”
Cas was raising his gun before he knew it and taking aim at the middle of Dean Winchester’s forehead.  “Hands up.”  His voice was remarkably steady.
Down the hallway, they heard the elevator doors start to slide open.  Cas was momentarily distracted, and Dean took advantage: he yanked Cas into the office by his sleeve, closed the door, and turned off the light.  Cas’s heart was a jackhammer in his chest: whoever they were hiding from definitely would have either heard the door close or seen the light.  Either way, Cas was trapped, hiding behind a desk with a felon in the office of the director of the FBI, and Cas wasn’t actively trying to apprehend or disarm the felon.  He would either be fired or dead by the end of the night, and he didn’t know which one he preferred.
“Bad,” Dean admitted. He struggled to swallow his toast, wincing when he finally managed it. “My stomach’s worse though.” He touched a hand to his abdomen, bare under the blanket that was draped across his shoulders.
Cas still had difficulty hearing about Dean’s time away.  He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate on Dean’s lips against his collarbone.
In the kitchen, Dean found Sam and Eileen crouched around the tiniest version of a pit bull that Dean had ever seen.  It was sitting down and licking Sam’s hand, but then it saw Dean and jumped up to its four legs and started howling.  It was the tiniest, cutest howl in the whole goddamn world, and Dean couldn’t help snorting in derision.  “Do they put up stuffed animals for adoption now?”
“So what?” Dean mumbled. “It’s cold. Get in the damn bed.” He tugged on Cas’s wrist and only let go when Cas sighed in concession and moved toward the other side of the bed.
Dean took a swallow of coffee.  It scalded his throat, but he managed to ask, “Yeah?  Why’d you come back then?”
and that he’d been applying an embarrassingly heteronormative worldview to them despite his being quite comfortably bisexual himself.  It was embarrassing and jarring and sad and pitiful, and it underscored just how poor he was at the thing he’d believed himself to be so good at:
When he came back to the dining table with his treasure in his hands, Dean’s eyes widened.  “No shit,” he said.
Dean had barely spared a thought for anything else besides Cas for the past few hours.  He blinked.  “Oh.”
15 minutes later, Cas was unlocking the front door of the bakery with the key Dean had given him. (“What, was I going to give it to Claire?” Dean had asked. “She’d record a Tiktok in the kitchen and set it on fire somehow.”) The kitchen lights were on, so Cas followed the light.
Cas never understood why Dean always sought his approval, but Cas was always glad to give it. It was easy when everything Dean did made Cas want to compose wedding vows.
The words soothed a little of the hurt, but that’s all Cas would allow himself to take from Dean. “I appreciate the sentiment, Dean. But I’m not going to ask you to find out.”
“I thought I’d go insane if I spent much longer never having kissed you,” Dean continued.  His genial tone had faded into something more sincere.  Dean touched Cas’s face, but Cas kept his eyes closed tight.  “If I hadn’t caught her that night,” Dean said, “I don’t know how I - how could I have lived any longer without this?”
It occurred to Dean all at once that he’d fucked up more than he thought he had. Dean had fucked up bad.
A silence descended.  Willow gave up on wrestling the ball back to Dean and eventually made her way to the shade under his legs.  She was panting in the late spring warmth.  Dean admired the roundness of her stomach, and when she caught him looking at her she stood up and barked.  Her tail began to wag.
Dean promised he would and bid her goodbye.  He hadn’t planned on doing much tonight - maybe catch up on the scores and hit the sack early - but after his conversation with his mom, he was sure he’d be too restless to do either of those.
“Are you feeling okay?” Cas asks.  There’s a slight tremor in his voice.  His eyes dance between Dean’s, but then they dip to Dean’s lips, and suddenly Dean knows: this is it, this is the one place, one time, one universe, one dream in which he can get it right.
“Happy New Year, Sam.”  With a sad little jolt, Cas realized he missed Sam too.  He wasn’t as close to him as he was to Dean, but Sam had always been kind and warm and welcoming.  “I hope you’re all doing well.”
This had not been what Dean was expecting. Tentatively, he touched Cas’s face, just a brush of fingers against Cas’s cheek, not bothering to hide his amazement when Cas smiled at him.
“I’m freezing my balls off is what I’m doing right now,” Dean said, laughing nervously.  “Can I - I mean, I know you weren’t expecting company, but - uh, listen, I kinda forgot my apartment keys in Lawrence… and my phone… and my clothes… and pretty much everything else.  So unless you’re turning me away, you’re kinda stuck with me.”
“Right,” Claire said skeptically. “You’re just bringing me to a stranger’s house on the outskirts of town.”
It wasn’t that he wasn’t flattered by Dean’s attention - on the contrary, underneath the layers of panic, Cas could recognize the beginnings of something a little like giddiness, albeit complicated by Cas’s relationship with dating and sex. He wasn’t normally interested in either, which usually suited him just fine; it was when he
Dean was looking around. “Install a TV above it, some couches around it - I might take you up on that offer.”
Dean stepped away from the hug and shoved Cas toward the direction of his car. “Good night, jackass.”
The closer Dean got to the redhead the slower he felt he was moving.  How much had he drank?  Jesus.
Dean should have been happy to hear this.  But he only closed his eyes and muttered a numb, “Thanks.”  His cheeks were red in mortification; his throat bobbed painfully.
The floor was swimming in front of him and he knew he’d have one hell of a headache tomorrow, but none of that mattered because at this moment, he had a mission - and hell if he wasn’t going to complete it.
The bookstore was busy for a Tuesday morning, but Dean, recently released from a large responsibility, was happy to wait in line and browse the knick-knacks by the register.
Silence. Cas’s brow furrowed. Then his eyes were open and narrowed at Dean. His hair was already hopelessly mussed. “What do I think of
Dean spent most of his time commiserating with Eileen about how difficult it was to live with Sam while Sam sat and looked injured.  However, while it was great to catch up after a few weeks away, it was sometimes difficult for Dean to concentrate on the conversation when he saw out of the corner of his eye how close Cas and Daphne were standing.
Aaron cleared his throat.  He seemed a little disgruntled, but that wasn’t Dean’s problem.  “We should all go out sometime,” Aaron said, looking around at the circle.  He was smiling, but it seemed a little hard around the edges.  “Get to know each other.  I’d love to get to know Dean’s family a little bit more.”
Dean put a hand on Jack’s back. “Sure, bud,” he said. “You can tell him what you want for Christmas.”
“Why, thanks for the congratulations, Dean; it’s not like this is the first time I’ve heard from you since getting married.”
Dean leaned his forearms along the top of the car door, bringing his face within 12 inches to Cas’s. “Look,” Dean murmured, holding Cas’s gaze. “This is how I see it: you still don’t want to sleep with me, and I’m still okay with that. The only thing that’s changed is now you actually want to go on a second date with me, and I’m not gonna pass that up.”
Dean’s glare could have cut through glass, but Cas parried it away with a roll of his eyes. Into the phone, he said, “He’s not happy that I’m discussing this with you.”
Cas would have been content to stay like that for two hours, but Dean drew back after a long minute. His eyes were fond when he looked at Cas. One hand lingered on Cas’s ribs.
Dean’s hand had landed tentatively on Cas’s ribs, the touch so soft it almost tickled. The other hand was still on Cas’s face, a warm cradle. “What the hell is happening?” Dean breathed, his gaze dancing over Cas’s face as if he’d find an answer there.
Dean looked at him. He looked dangerous despite the doe eyes he was flashing. It made Cas’s heart thump a little harder. “You’re gonna have to try a little harder to get my socks off, Cas.”
“Kind of slow on the uptake,” Cas said. His nose was still pink. “Maybe I should be in charge of Jack’s studies.”
Dean blinked against the sudden stinging of his eyes. His throat caught. He cleared it. “You had to outdo me, didn’t you?”
Toward the end of the night, as Sam and Eileen were saying goodbye to the guests who came to wish them well one last time, and Dean’s alcohol-fueled heartburn was starting up, a guest caught his eye.  She was a petite redhead, dwarfed by Sam, and she was patting away tears as she hugged Eileen next to the tulip display.
Dean’s relief was short-lived, because none of what Cas said solved the Daphne problem.  But Dean couldn’t say her name, so he nodded instead, then looked away.  He met Charlie’s eye.  She gave him a sympathetic smile.  He wasn’t able to even think about how to respond to the sadness in her face before Cas had his hand on Dean’s arm.
Cas turned away, determined not to be caught looking at Dean’s butt after that comment.  “I made lasagna.”
Or would that be too much?  Maybe Dean hadn’t called because he was feeling cramped.  Maybe he needed space from Cas?  The thought had Cas cringing away from his phone.
“No,” Cas said immediately.  “No.”  He’d looked forward to this dinner since Dean had accepted the invitation, and he wasn’t going to let the opportunity slip away.  “I have pie.”
Dean stared at him.  Cas could see his chest rising and falling.  After the third time, Dean murmured, “Not everything, Cas.”
“No one’s used ‘chillax’ in a decade, Dean,” Claire said, watching the scenery go past. “Also we’re late to your appointment. If there ever was an appointment.”
amazing. I still can’t believe you even give me the time of day, dude, much less everything else you’ve given me.”
Dean has to consciously close his mouth.  His throat is itchy.  He swallows painfully.  “What do you - “
He stared unseeing at the television, where the program leading up to the ball drop was in full swing.  Couples waved at the camera. Cas imagined the look of disgust on Dean’s face at the thought of all the glitter.  His heart ached.
He dressed in the clothes Cas left outside. They were Cas’s clothes, clothes Dean had seen him wear a hundred times in their years-long friendship, and putting it on, feeling the cotton against his skin, was more intimate than he knew what to do with. Guiltily, he relished it, and when he walked back into Cas’s bedroom wearing Cas’s clothes, his face flushed when Cas turned over in bed to look.
tells me nothing.” When he looked up and met Dean’s gaze, his eyes were shining with frustrated tears. “I sat here for an hour and a half trying to piece together a story that made sense, but nothing made sense. And you weren’t here to - you weren’t here.“
“Just text him or something,” Sam said. He did a cursory glance over his desk and then patted his pocket for his phone. “I’m sure he’d be glad to hear from you.” He walked out from behind his desk and patted Cas on the shoulder as he walked past. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Dean chuckled imagining the look on Aaron’s face.  “Y’know, you could have told him where it was actually from.”
Dean saved him from starting the conversation.  “Sammy wants to talk to me,” he said.  The next four words were pulled out of somewhere painful: “Can I call him?”
“No, I’m not,” Cas said stubbornly, though his nose was red and Dean’s thumbs were diverting his tears.  “And even if I were, look who’s talking.”
“Buying a house ‘for the future’ is indication enough, dude,” Dean said, but he was smiling, his forehead against Cas’s. The hand on Cas’s ribs was expansive and comforting. “By the way, I’ll take you up on that offer.”
“It’s a vacation if I’m spending it with the people I care about,” Cas corrected. “And luckily for you, you count.”
Cas covered his face with both of his hands.  “What possessed you to leave?” he asked.  He felt warm.  He felt frustrated.  He felt confused.  But mostly he couldn’t bear to look at Dean with the amount of gratitude welling up in his chest.
Waking up in Dean’s bed was disorienting. The mattress was firmer than Cas’s, and the pillow lumpier. The blanket over his torso was also softer than he was used to, and he indulged in the luxuriousness for a few seconds. Noises from outside the bedroom told Cas that Dean had left him alone in bed, and though it had just been a nap that just so happened to take place in the same bed, Cas couldn’t help but feel a little abandoned.
Dean, however, seemed to know exactly what to say: “Can I see you again?” He said this quietly, hopefully. He was looking straight at Cas, too, with his palms flat against his thighs.
Cas was quiet, and Dean suddenly remembered the conversation he’d had with Cas only a few short weeks ago, after they’d made up.
A silence descended. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was heavy and thick, and the longer it went on, the more Cas’s face revealed that something else was bothering him.
Cas took Dean’s hand and tugged him down onto the couch where Dean immediately boxed Cas in with his arms, eliciting laughter from both of them. The light from the fire made Dean’s eyes shine even brighter.
“I learned about him when I was in middle school,” Dean admitted. “The first time I stayed at one school for more than a few months. Pretty sure by then I was too old to believe.”
Claire visited again in December, not to work but to spend time with Kaia. Still, Dean dangled the promise of a paycheck in front of her until she agreed to help out for a few hours on the weekends.
Dean’s eyes snapped open.  “No,” he said, trying to straighten.  Then he sighed.  “Would you absolutely hate me if I said yes?”
“Though,” Cas added, clearing his throat, “it should be said that being able to see you in an apron is very much appreciated.”
All Dean could do was watch Cas walk away.  Dean’s vision blurred the farther Cas got, and it was only halfway to his own car that he realized he had hot tears on his cheeks.
“The redhead?” Mary said, yawning.  “I think it might be one of Eileen’s old classmates.  Why do you ask?”
Cas turned his head upward to the sun, closing his eyes against its glare.  This time, when he sighed, it was happy.  “I’m very happy for him,” he said.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said again.  He was staring straight at the road.  His knuckles were pale against the steering wheel.
look away despite impending doom is… profound. You should try your hand at poetry, Dean. You have good instincts.”
He watched Cas carefully in the moments that followed. Blue eyes wide and apprehensive, posture straight, lips parted. Dean loved him so much it hurt, but that only made Dean’s lie all the more painful.
“Okay,” Dean said, settling on his couch and groping for the TV remote.  “You, uh - wanna tell me why you’re so quiet?”
But there was none of that here, in this hospital room.  Cas was here to get patched up; maybe so too could Dean.  Cas opened his eyes to find Dean’s sad gaze.  “You did what you were ordered to do.  So did I.  I forgive you for all of it.”
“So,” Dean said eventually, peeling off the label of a Gatorade bottle while Cas mopped up the remaining egg yolk with his toast. “Finally used your key.” A frown at the edge of his mouth spoke of his lingering hangover.
Dean’s dizzy with Cas’s touch.  He touches Cas’s face because he can’t stand not touching him.  “You started it,” he says, all he can think of to say.
Dean shrugged him off.  Nothing Cas said mattered.  In fact, it mattered so little that Dean was going to prove him wrong.  Somehow.
When he was distracted by the opening theme song - he always sang along despite his insistence he didn’t know the words - Cas reached out silently with his beer bottle and touched the cold glass to Dean’s cheek.
Cas spent two hours pacing a hole in his rug before he decided he needed to direct his energy toward something productive.  It was 8pm, but he grabbed his work things and drove to the office.
“For just because,” Dean mumbled. He wasn’t looking at Cas. “I mean, you’re here half the time anyway.”
Dean had settled on an old western, but he wasn’t paying the television any attention.  He was looking at Cas instead with a downward tilt to his lips.  “I just - I felt bad for leaving you alone on Christmas, Cas.  I shouldn’t have left.”
When Dean wakes up, it’s to a cold bed.  Next to him is the usual sight: white pillows against white sheets and nothing else.
The breath left Dean’s lungs when the implication began to sink in.  Dean’s mouth went slack as he sucked in a startled breath.  “Sorry?”
passed by the place dozens of times but had never paid it much attention, mostly because the crowd that seemed to gravitate toward the glass double-doors was made up of college kids and twenty-somethings, and while Dean liked to think he wasn’t
Dean was leaning against his counter. He looked down at his socks. Embarrassment stopped up his vocal cords.
The drive to Cas’s apartment was not tense, but it grew more uncomfortable the longer the silence went. They hadn’t spoken much on the way to the Roadhouse, but the silence had been warm then, anticipatory. This silence was colder, like being frozen out. Cas supposed he should be happy, or at the very least satisfied, with this turn of events. At the beginning of the night, he’d wanted Dean to see who he was, and now Dean had seen it. At the beginning of the night all he’d wanted was a way out, and now he had it.
Dean didn’t answer. Cas turned away. For many long minutes after and until he fell asleep, he could hear Dean’s breaths in the winter quiet.
Cas gave him a sheepish smile, embarrassed at the reaction that no other adult man would have had to such a weak innuendo. “I’m a little tired,” he offered.
Dean closed his eyes and let his head loll back against the ugly wallpaper of the hotel.  He was in pain but Cas knew him enough to know that he wasn’t going to ask for help.  “I know,” Dean breathed.
Dean took a deep breath.  “If it’s about sex, Cas, I - I don’t care.  It’s not a big deal.”  The night before, Dean had thought about it - had weighed the possibility of never having sex again against the possibility of not being with Cas - and it didn’t take long to decide which Dean couldn’t live without.  “I’ll keep my hands to myself.”
“If you say so,” Dean says, in the tone he’s reserved for when he doesn’t want to bother with Cas’s attitude.  He presses a buzzer.  A few seconds later, they’re being ushered up a set of stairs by a sweet old lady with curlers in her hair who coos over them and chatters about the possibility of having another wonderful tenant.  She opens up the apartment and lingers at the door while Dean and Cas wander.
When Eileen drew back, she smiled at both of them.  “Sam, do that later,” she said, turning to her husband.
“Sap,” Dean accused, but his cheeks were wonderfully pink.  “Anyway, I should still call and wish them a happy new year.”
Dean set a mug in front of Cas and poured him some coffee. “You spent half your day cleaning up after me; I think you’re entitled to a meal.” He turned back to the stove. “I know it’s past noon but I figured you’d appreciate breakfast since you missed it. Eggs in five.”
Dean wants to say, but even here in his own head, that truth is too much to give away.  “Just your attention.”
“A better response would have been ‘We’re not kidnapping you, Claire,’” Claire pointed out, “y’know—instead of debating the definition of kidnapping.”
Dean grinned at the grill. “Can’t say that’s not true.” He looked at Cas’s plate and raised his eyebrows. “I better see you coming for seconds.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said again, ducking his head.  “I didn’t mean to...I dunno.  Make you feel like I didn’t get you.”
“The hell?  Sammy, I am up to here with all these goddamn secrets.  What the hell do you know that I don’t?”
A month after Winchester Bakery’s opening, Dean sent a message to the group chat. It was a photo of a number - considerably large - in Dean’s handwriting, underlined twice.
“I think I can manage that,” Dean said, his voice pitched a little lower. His smile was amused, but not unkind or predatory in the least, and that made Cas breathe a little easier.
Dean had already come to terms with his feelings for his best friend.  That had been the easy part.  The next part - accepting that Cas might very well come back hand-in-hand with Daphne - had been heart-wrenching.  It had taken quite a few beers to even begin wrapping his head around it, and even more to admit that Cas’s happiness was more important to him than his own.  But he’d done it.  And he was ready to see his best friend and accept whatever choice Cas had made.  But Cas, apparently, was not ready to see Dean.
of a tree - “It’s our first Christmas in the apartment; we have to go big” - and though Dean had felt like a monster when he strapped it to the roof of the Impala, the way Cas had looked, so incandescently happy in his coat and his gloves and hat, made it all worth it. He was amazed Cas didn’t notice how often he kept sneaking looks at him as he drove home.
But as they approached the corner of the parking garage that Dean had chosen, Cas prepared himself.  If he had to take a shot, he would take it, and any lingering feelings be damned; he needed to do his job.  Grief (for the Dean that stopped existing two years ago) would follow later, and so Cas would deal with it later.
was playing on the TV.  “You should come get it.”  All Cas wanted was Dean next to him, and it didn’t seem fair that he wasn’t.
Cas’s sigh greeted Dean.  It was long and heavy and regretful.  “Hello, Dean,” he said quietly.  He was beautiful.
Dean took a deep breath, letting the cold air steady his nerves, though his heart was ready to jump out of his throat. “He said he thinks you have feelings for me.”
He found a blanket in his bedroom drawer.  It was his softest and warmest, and Dean deserved the best.  Cas draped it over him.
Dean kept his hands close to his chest, but selfishly, guiltily, he let his forehead bump against Cas’s chest. Every breath he took was a lungful of sweet detergent and the smell of Cas.
At this, Dean laughed, and it was genuine.  “No shit.  Congratulations, bro.”  Dean wasn’t a particular fan of animals, but he knew Sam had always dreamed of a white picket fence and 2.5 kids and a dog running around in the backyard.  Dean’s little brother was halfway there.
Dean was trying to bite down on a grin but not quite managing it. “To buy my best friend a beer while I can still afford it.”
When they return to Cas’s apartment, Dean throws his keys onto the table near the door and then takes off his shoes. His jacket goes on top of Cas’s on the door hook. He takes off his disposable mask and holds out a hand silently for Cas’s. When he gets it, he throws both into the trash and washes his hands.
Sam raised his eyebrows at Dean, unconvinced. “So when? When he gives Jack up? You and I both know that’s never happening.”
In front of him, Dean’s laptop went to sleep, tired of waiting. The room was dark now, but Dean felt lit up from the inside. “How do you mean?”
Usually Dean was on board with a beer or two, but in this situation? With Cas in a navy blue sweater that brought out his eyes and the smell of Christmas in the air? “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Cas.”
“Thank you,” Cas said. There were tears on his cheeks too. “That makes me feel less scared of the future.”
Dean yelped immediately, clapping a hand against his cheek. He scowled at Cas. “You’re lucky the show’s on, or you’d regret that.”
But upon seeing Dean for the first time in two years, Cas had to admit that no amount of time or training could have prepared him for this moment: the reunion between Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester, the partnership that should have been, but never was.
They took sips.  Cas put his glass down and was suddenly reminded that he and his best friend were very much alone in his apartment, about to celebrate the coming of Christmas together, and if things went according to plan, by the time Dean left, he’d be leaving as something rather more than just Cas’s best friend.
Cas has the furrow between his brow that says he hasn’t had his coffee yet.  “You don’t have to lie to me just because we slept together,” he grumbles.
Dean put a hand to his forehead in disbelief. “Was I dreaming, or did we not spent the whole of yesterday together? I’m
“We can’t all have sophisticated tastes like you,” Cas said, smiling. He usually tried to keep his affection for Dean under wraps, but Cas was too tired, too happy to be in Dean’s space again.
Dean swallows audibly.  His eyes dip down to Cas’s lips again and this time Cas can’t ignore it, just like he can’t ignore the way Dean hasn’t moved out of Cas’s grip, the way Dean’s hands are iron on his waist. Dean apparently is of the same mind because this time they meet in the middle, and this time, the kiss is anything but short or sweet or innocent.
Then there are fingertips on Dean’s sternum: light and unassuming, but Dean feels them like a two-ton weight.
“My brother got a dog,” Dean explained.  “Look, uh, can I catch up with you guys later?  Maybe?  I don’t know how long this will take.  But take your time, alright?  I’m sure you guys can find something in common.”  He waved distractedly at them, then looked at his phone in concern for good measure.  “I hope she’s all right,” he mumbled, then, frowning, said, “I’ll see you guys later.”
Dean remembered the way Cas’s voice had faltered earlier before Dean had kissed him.  He made another promise to himself: to never let Cas go one second in doubt of Dean’s feelings.  He smiled and hid his face in Cas’s neck.  Cas smelled like salt - sweat, tears - and his citrus shampoo.  “We can tell them together,” he said against Cas’s collarbone.
Cas gripped the curtain. Outside, over Dean’s shoulder, he could see his car parked by the curb. Behind it, Dean’s Impala shone even in the winter gloom. It was not uncommon to see the two cars together. Cas marveled that Dean wanted to see it happen more often than it already did.
Dean’s other hand lifted to the side of Cas’s neck. His thumb grazed Cas’s lips. His eyes, when they met Cas’s, were tender.
Cas watched Dean’s face carefully. “Of course,” he said softly, scared that any other words might shatter the dream he’d walked into.
When Cas stopped shaking and finally let their hands fall away from his dick, Dean turned his face into Cas’s temple.  “You good?” he whispered.
“No,” Dean interrupted, startling Cas. Dean looked Cas in the eye and begged him to understand. “Cas, I get it. I do. And me too, alright? Me too. But you need to know something before - before.”
Something about those words makes Dean’s stomach flip.  “Not hungry,” he says belatedly.  He taps his coffee mug to distract himself from the warmth climbing up his neck.
Cas had a pleasant buzz in his fingertips and his cheeks, mostly thanks to the two beers he’d enjoyed but also probably because this was the first time he’d ever been alone with Dean. Cas knew there was no way this could end in the way he wanted it to, but he resolved that, at least for this half-hour ride to his apartment, he would pretend it could. There was very little occasion for indulgence of this kind in Cas’s life, and he would take it where he could, as long as he didn’t let himself get too wrapped up in it.
Sam was holding his phone up to his ear, but when he saw Cas, he placed a hand over the mouthpiece.  “Hey, Cas, Merry Christmas!”
This newfound bravery carries Dean back out into the hallway.  Still, it is a fragile bravery, and it makes him pause outside of his door and put a steadying hand on the wall.  It makes him waver.  It makes him weak.  But Dean pushes on.  His feet are still bare.  The tile is freezing.
Dean watched Cas’s face for a long time.  Cas watched right back.  It seemed like the first time he had
Dean thought.  He forced himself to look away, back to Willow, who was nipping at his chin playfully.  He saw his mom watching him.  He ignored it in favor of scratching Willow under the chin.
The TV says the state will reopen in phases beginning in a week.  The chyron across the screen confirms what Cas thinks he’s hearing, but it’s difficult to believe after so long in one place.  Cas tries to catch Dean’s eye, but is unsurprised not to succeed. In recent days Dean is either staring into Cas’s soul or looking away completely and it’s more often the latter than the former.
“There’s a lot of goddamn crying for what’s supposed to be good news,” Dean grumbled into Sam’s shoulder.
They stopped a few minutes later in a part of the park that no one else had occupied.  It was probably because of the bushes and brambles that had started to overtake it.  Dean looked around and scratched at a spot on his arm that had suddenly started to itch.  “Dude,” he said.  “We couldn’t talk 300 feet that way?” he said, jerking his head to where an elderly couple were sitting on a bench reading a newspaper together.
“Not to you.  Because you care about him no matter what.  But it’s a big deal to him, Dean, and you shouldn’t treat it like a joke.”
He felt exposed and raw and mortified, knowing that Cas was right at that moment reading the contents of his soul, a poetry book that amounted to a 25-page love letter, and he hated that he had done it to himself.
Cas was about to reply, but Dean was hooking an arm around Cas’s neck and leading them down the block before Cas could manage it.
“Is that Aaron?” Cas asked hoarsely.  Dean had told him about the plan, and while Cas hadn’t outright vetoed it, he definitely hadn’t been happy about it.
Dean bristled a little bit.  “Can you not say it like that?  I got my badge back and everything, buddy.”
“Who says we can’t still get along?”  Dean walked out from behind the desk.  There was a swagger in his walk.  Even in the tension of the moment, Cas was impressed with Dean’s smoothness.
A few days after, as Dean was sitting in his quiet living room staring at his phone trying to decide if he should call Charlie or not, her contact information lit up the display.
He’d done a good job of tuning out the conversation the group was having, but now that he was tuned back in, he heard Daphne give a soft laugh at something Sam said, then Cas’s soft murmur.  Dean couldn’t make out what Cas had said - it must have been meant for Daphne alone, then, which meant Cas had leaned in and -
Cas helped him unstick the plastic wrap. Together they fit it over the dough. When they were finished, Cas touched Dean’s arm and met his eyes.
Dean was beginning to get the picture, but it was still difficult to grasp.  “It was a joke.  People say it all the time.”
Dean sniffed. He straightened Cas’s tie. “But hey, no takebacks, alright? Even if you go and get yourself hitched, I’m not giving Jack up.”
Dean looks at Cas.  He looks at the stack of burned pancakes next to the stove, then at the sink faucet that he’ll need to repair.  He returns his gaze to Cas and says, with complete certainty, “Yeah.”
But Mary was determined not to answer.  “So I’ll see you next week Saturday, right?  We’ll make it a potluck, maybe grill some hot dogs.”
Cas was the one to lean in the rest of the way, an apology written in the furrow between his brows.  His lips were warm, flushed from the tears, and Dean wanted to sink into the gentle way Cas handled him.
The wistfulness had vanished from Cas’s face. He was smiling. “Agreed. I’ll let you handle the Santa situation.”
“A plan,” Cas repeated numbly. He tried to understand what Dean was getting at, tried to think of some other ‘plan’ that Dean might have thought of that wasn’t what Cas was hoping for, but he drew a blank.
The words stun Dean, and for a moment his brain goes offline.  Why is he in the kitchen?  Why is Cas looking at him like that?  What is with the beating of his heart?  Didn’t he fix that goddamn sink last week?
Eventually Dean turned to face Cas. His tone was casual but Cas heard hesitation in each syllable. “Sammy and I never had a fireplace growing up. It was always tiny apartments with heating that never worked half the time. It’s why I’m so damn proud of him, y’know? Got the whole picket fence scene over there with Eileen.”
Cas had said, and Dean could only conclude that he meant he refused to take part in Dean’s life.  Was that it, then?  What that the end of their friendship?  Would Cas never hug Mary again?  Would he never meet Dean’s future niece or nephew?  He couldn’t wrap his head around the concept of a life without Cas, not after 16 years, couldn’t quite comprehend the possibility of it.  But what else could he conclude?  Cas had walked away, presumably back to Daphne, presumably forward into a new life where he moved to be with Daphne and her parents and left Dean and his family behind.
Setting up a gay man and a lesbian woman together?  Not seeing that the gay man had the hots for Dean himself?  “I
“C’mon, man,” Dean mumbled, “You know we’re not big on Christmas.”  His voice was heavy and slow with the after-dinner fog he’d eaten himself into.  “Probably just gonna grab some dinner or something.  Ugh.  Still gotta get him a present, though.”
She sighed, once she looked at the card.  “Yes.  I wish he wouldn’t send so many at once.  It’s more attention than I like.  And there’s only so much room in here.”  She looked sidelong at Cas.  “How is our… consultant?”
of Cas’s hair. “Just fixin’ it,” he says, but despite that, he leaves his hand there, right there, right where he’s wanted it to be for ages - just resting on the side of Cas’s face, brushing Cas’s right ear, barely even in his hair anymore, but steady, steady.
Cas’s palms stroked Dean’s back. “Can I entice you back to bed for a nap then?” he murmured into Dean’s hair.
He was chewing solemnly on some antacids, his expression grim. “Are we getting old, Cas? I could have sworn I could hold my alcohol better than that.”
Cas looked at Dean’s face - at the arch of his brow and the faded freckles across his nose.  And he thought about saying it.  Cas had thought about saying it for months now.  But he looked down at his shoes and smiled instead.  “I’d regret not asking you for your apple pie recipe.”
Dean turned away and left, throat tight, knowing that soon, too soon, Cas would turn back to the papers in his hand and flip to the second page in the stack, where he would see the dedication:
“That’s why I was upset at the park.  You didn’t know.  She didn’t really know.  We had a nice, long…
For a moment, Cas felt as if he were 19 again and standing in his college apartment - the one he’d only been able to afford because Dean had split the rent with him.  They’d argued only occasionally then - about dishes and the thermostat and dates and who finished the last of the milk - but lately arguing seemed to be the only way they could communicate.
“That was nearly two hours,” Cas said, after a heavy pause. His throat bobbed when Dean looked at him. “You said one.”
Dean sighed.  He looked helpless and tired, so tired.  “Cas, I dunno where to start.  I really don’t.  I’m happy just to be in the same room with you without having to lie.”
Cas took in a shuddering breath.  His eyes were damp too, but he didn’t tear them away from Dean’s.  “Your attempts at helping your friends have been well-intentioned.  You have always been kind, and I can’t fault you for that.  But your actions have also been steeped in arrogance, and it’s blinded you.  It’s kept you from seeing so much.”  Finally he tore his eyes away to stare down at the ground.  “You’ve been indulged for too long, Dean.  I refuse to take part.”
“Just sayin’, man,” Dean said, “I don’t want you to think I’m stopping you from… doin’ your thing.” His grin was weak.
episode that had just aired, then the second time to say, “I never got your thoughts on Campbell’s poetry.”
But Charlie interrupted.  She seemed a little confused.  “Have you not seen each other in a while?” she asked.  “I thought that you were - uh, good friends.”
Dean was satisfied that she was showing some interest.  “He’s pretty cute,” he said, though Aaron wasn’t really his type.  Only a few people could pull of the scruff, and Aaron was not really one of them.  “Scruffy,” he said, watching her reaction.
Cas had been elated, overjoyed, to feel Dean’s lips against his, Dean’s hand warm on his jaw - but Dean had ended it far too soon, pulling away with an anguished breath.
A silence fell. For a long time neither of them moved, but as long as Cas wasn’t moving away, Dean would take it. He’d take this stillness forever if it meant never truly losing Cas.
It had been Dean’s behavior, because when was the source of Cas’s stress not Dean?  Dean had been distracted as they worked, not in any large way, but in a way that Cas had learned to notice as a young man because it usually meant there’d been an argument beween Dean and his father.  In the past Cas had been able to draw out what was bothering Dean with a six-pack of Dean’s favorite beer and a few movies on his couch, but that wouldn’t work now, not when there was Dean’s criminal record in the way.
“I don’t know,” Cas admitted.  “She wouldn’t talk to me about it.  But you should have seen her face, Dean.  She was devastated seeing you flirting with Gilda.”
Dean shrugged. His gaze—wide, green, a little scared—met Cas’s eyes and begged. “What if I just want you?”
Dean’s heart was full to bursting. He swallowed down a sudden urge to cry. “That’s great news, man,” he said, pulling Cas into a rough hug. “Congratulations!”
In the background of the call, Cas heard raucous laughter.  He became very suddenly melancholy.  He bit down on a sigh.  Dean’s voice was closer now, like he was cupping his hand against his mouth.  “You - uh.  You been drinking, bud?”
It didn’t seem to be enough, however, because Dean was already tossing the towel onto a countertop and turning away, jaw tight. “I’m going back to bed,” he said, abruptly short. “My head’s killing me.”
He looks like he’s headed toward the fridge when he notices Cas watching him from his spot by the door.
Dean detangled his hand from Cas’ and stood up, but not before touching two fingers to Cas’s cheek.  “Be right back,” he said, then grinned before walking away.
A long, awkward silence followed. Neither moved. Cas’s coffee mug was warm only because of his hands, still gripping the ceramic so tightly he could imagine it cracking.
Sam was frowning at him.  “Charlie just got up and left suddenly.  She looked upset.  Cas went after her.”
This was more painful than Cas had ever imagined, but saying yes would make the pain even more acute in the future, because there was just no future for them. “I like you too,” Cas said, because Dean deserved that truth at least, “But I don’t think it will work.”
To his embarrassment, Cas found himself fighting back sudden frustrated tears.  He brought up the issue of immediate importance first: “I assume the director was taken into custody for something I don’t understand yet.”
Luckily, Aaron decided to break the silence, though perhaps not in the way Dean wanted him to.  “So, Dean, what have you been up to lately?”
“But you were!” Dean said.  Then, “...Weren’t you?”  He felt a little hysterical.  “I was setting you up with Aaron and you
“I didn’t get you a present,” Dean blurted out. Not surprisingly, saying it out loud didn’t make him feel any better.
“Don’t act like you didn’t know this already,” Sam said, though his tone was gentle. “I’m just saying out loud what you don’t want to admit.”
It had been a sweet proposal, if a little silly: Sam had gone to the bathroom, and in his absence Dean had taken to staring open-mouthed at Cas’s profile. It was then that he’d asked, in all his drunken courage,
As Dean slept, Cas kept watch. He pulled a chair from the kitchen and set it next to the bed. Eventually he picked up a book, but rather than read, he found himself more often than not simply watching the rise and fall of Dean’s chest under the blanket, relieved that Dean had come over for the new year because otherwise Dean would be suffering alone in his apartment half an hour away.
Benny sighs.  “I don’t know, Dean.  They just want to know their captain’s being honest with them.  Sleeping with the opposition is pretty shady, alright?”
It took a few seconds for Dean to react. Worry and hope crossed his face, and it was only after a deep, shaky breath that Dean’s free hand came up tentatively. He touched two fingers to Cas’s cheek, his expression wondrous when Cas didn’t flinch away. “You’re serious.”
“Oh, no, I am,” the man corrected. He was wearing a trench coat that was too big in the shoulders. “I’m not much of a sci-fi fan, however. The world-building is always so tedious to read.”
Dean swung his face toward Cas, making Cas nearly lose balance again. The smell of vodka met Cas’s nose. “Who called you a dumbass?”
That drew a laugh out of Cas. “Not a chance,” he said, voice thick. But he was leaning in with his blue eyes and looking at Dean like he hung the moon.
“Alright, alright, you can stop starin’,” Dean grumbled, ducking his head. His hands were latched onto Cas’s sides, thumbs rubbing circles on his ribcage.
when he confronted his father years ago: full of fear, full of the knowledge that a part of his life was about to end but ready for another part to begin regardless.
Aaron nodded.  He seemed pleased.  “I’ve gotta say, it’s great to meet another one of Dean’s friends.  I only ever met Cas, and he was - Dean, I hope you don’t take offense, but he’s not the easiest to talk to.  Do you - do you two still hang out?”  The last few words were tentative.
Cas cornered him at the reception, where Dean was lurking at the edges of the dance floor. “Can we talk?” he said, leaning in to be heard over the music.
Cas dug around in a drawer and put another bottle in front of Dean. “Am I your pharmacist on top of your chef now?”
“Yeah,” Sam said, sounding wistful.  “Gonna stop by the shelter tomorrow.  Hopefully by the end of the week we’ll be able to take one home.  You and Cas should stop by for dinner.  Maybe we’ll have a little barbeque or something.”
The days leading up to the bakery’s opening were a flurry of buying, baking, and frustration. Dean’s recipes had to be tweaked for the new equipment, and it required a lot of testing. Cas, newly freed from his responsibilities at work, became the tester by default.
Jack was five years old and came home from kindergarten with a coloring sheet of Santa. Cas looked at Dean, mouth thin. “I’m tagging you in,” he said, then left the room.
Cas looked unsure. “Job search, I suppose. I might explore a different field, something more suited to my tastes.”
He sighed.  Despite being thoroughly humiliated by his piss-poor people-reading skills, Dean actually felt relieved.  He’d fucked things up with Aaron, sure, and that would bother him for a while yet, but Charlie and Gilda?  That had worked out, even though, Dean had to admit, it had been no thanks to him.  Still, it was nice to be able to lay his head back and not worry about Charlie or Aaron or Gilda.
The implications were obvious, and Cas was sure his cheeks turned bright pink, but luckily Sam was too busy staring awkwardly at the side wall to notice. “I see,” Cas said, just to fill the silence.
“An unauthorized field trip?” Claire asked dryly. “You could be charged with kidnapping. You know Jody’s a sheriff, right?”
Dean saw where this was going. He ducked his head again and, though he knew he’d regret it, begged shamelessly for Cas’s words: “Yeah? Then what is it?”
“My answer’s the same,” Cas said, tugging Dean’s hands away from his face, revealing ruddy cheeks and wary green eyes.
Dean stared at him.  Then he looked back down at his empty plate.  “Didn’t you say you were going to serve me?”
Cas was opening the door and leaving his office before he fully realized what he was doing, which said enough about his feelings and his decision. The carpeted floor of the hallway muffled his footsteps but didn’t muffle the frantic hummingbird beating of his heart. By the time he knocked on Sam’s open door, he was almost convinced the whole office could hear it.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at her.  Her ears were still pink, but she was at least still talking to him.  “I’m just glad I didn’t have to break your heart,” he admitted.  He motioned to her, and she came to him easily, fitting into his arms with a happy sigh.
Eventually Cas pushed his beer to the side with determination. He pushed his palms flat against the table like he was willing them to stay still. “Also…” he said. He raised his eyes to Dean. There was pink in his cheeks even though he hadn’t touched a drop of beer. “I was hoping to spend more time with you.”
The stillness that followed between them was absolute, though the world around them kept moving. Their fridge kicked on. The dishwasher ran. Next door, the first few measures of Taylor Swift’s “Christmas Tree Farm” could be heard amid a bout of muffled laughter. Still, neither Dean nor Cas moved.
Dean laughed.  He planted himself on Cas’s thighs and leaned over the love of his life.  “And if I called your bluff?”
The next day was Sunday.  After a restless night in bed, Dean needed nothing more than to get out of the house.  He called his mom and let her know he’d be joining her for lunch.  He was looking forward to a long conversation, alone with his mom in her dining room, but he was surprised when he parked in her driveway that there was another car parked out front as well.  It was unfamiliar.
Cas had been too touched to reply at the time, so he kept chopping. He’d blamed his teary eyes on the onions.
Charlie’s face was bright red.  She pulled her legs up onto the couch and hugged them to her chest.  “I thought you were introducing me to your boyfriend,” she said a little defensively.  “You never
“A - a rather large one,” Cas replied, but his voice was unsteady in his surprise.  “That’s… quite a mistake.”
The week passed by quickly.  Dean’s restoration shop maintained a constant flow of customers, and on Wednesday he even had to ask (beg) Bobby to come in to help ease the strain on his mechanics, despite having also donned his old pair of coveralls for a shift.  The work felt good for him, and it succeeded in distracting him from the utter bullshit it was that Cas was actually considering a return to Daphne.
Dean stopped pacing.  He looked at Cas with eyes that bordered on panicked and took a deep breath.  “That’s - that’s a word.”
Cas wiped his mouth.  “Yes, thank you,” he said, a complete lie.  At Dean’s slight frown, Cas just raised his wine glass.  “To Christmas?”
Sam had returned to his work, staring very intently at his monitor. He made a big show of putting his earbuds back into his ears and hitting the space bar to unpause his music.
Dean bit back a smart remark.  He dragged his palms down his denim-clad thighs and tried not to clench them into fists.  “Yeah,” he said, “Yeah, all the time.”
than I imagined.”  He kissed Cas on the jaw.  “I just needed a second,” he murmured into Cas’s ear.  “We’re good.”
Dean ran a hand over his chin. Underneath his hand he let out a small rueful laugh. “In other words, ‘It’s not you, it’s me.’”
Cas’s stomach was a mess of knots. He had imagined himself in Dean’s bed more times than he’d care to admit, had thought once or twice that there was a chance of it actually happening one day, but he’d never thought that it would be quite so soon.
“When things calm down,” Dean murmured, voice hushed velvet, “we need to talk.” There were spots of pink high in his cheeks.
“Threw me off,” he complains at the end of the day, sprawled across the couch with an arm over his eyes.  “Accidentally left my meeting when I wanted to mute myself.”
Mary sighed and Dean ducked down to let her kiss him on the forehead.  “Honey, you need to take care of yourself.”
When he straightened, Sam dumped Willow into his arms.  “Uncle Dean missed you,” Sam said, clapping Dean on the back.  “Will you hold her?  Gotta go help Eileen with the food.”  Without waiting for an answer, Sam skipped off to where Eileen was approaching with a dish in her hands.
Dean heard Sam’s voice from the kitchen.  “Hey, Dean, come in!  Sorry, we’re trying to calm Willow down!”
After that, it was easy enough to fall into a routine. Their schedules allowed them to make time for each other easily, so before Dean knew it, only a few months after meeting Cas in that bookstore, they were seeing each other at least once a week - sometimes for lunch, sometimes for dinner, and sometimes just because.
Cas spared Dean a tired look. He didn’t bother answering. The cork popped out of the bottle with a little bit of a pull. “Mugs,” he ordered.
They made it to the toilet just in time. Cas looked away politely while Dean heaved over the bowl, but he kept a palm moving in comforting circles on Dean’s back. It helped, and eventually Dean unloaded a night’s worth of drinking into Cas’s toilet.
Dean shook his head at himself.  He looked at Cas, pouring creamer into his coffee.  Dean steadied his heart on that image because it reminded him of what he stood to lose.  Then he took a deep breath and tried not to let his voice shake when he said, “I’m sorry.”
Another sigh.  “Dean, remember that night like - ten years ago?  Cas told us he needed to talk to us and then he -”
Dean sent, and though he immediately regretted it after he sent it, there was a vicious part of him that wanted Cas to know that Dean was upset.
Dean was on the couch, too busy admiring the way the lights looked on Cas’s face to care about the lights on the tree. “Both,” he said.
XV. 	Retirement suited Bobby.  When it finally came, a few years down the road, neither Dean nor Cas heard a peep out of him for a few months.  When he finally did come around to visit them, they found he’d grown a little rounder and a little redder and a lot more ready to laugh.  It wasn’t laughter he responded with, however, when they asked him to be a groomsman at their wedding; it was with a red nose and a sniffle and a mumble that sort of sounded like, “Of course, you idiots.”
The image lent him the courage to say what he’d been trying to say for the past three days. “You know the guest room is as good as yours, right? You can do what you like with it.”
Cas unbuckled his seat belt.  “Consider it an invitation, then,” he said, and he sounded almost like himself.
Dean pulled one of his knees up and wrapped his arms around it. He gave up his attempts at a smile for a long, deep sigh. “It’s not goodbye, dude,” he said, in a tone that implied that it was
Dean tore his eyes away from his best friend’s arms and looked back at the ceiling again.  He didn’t want to sit up.  He felt a confrontation coming and he wanted to stay cool.  “People who need help don’t ask for help, dude.  Take you, for example.”
Claire made a gagging noise behind a hand. “Seriously, I’m going to tell Jody you’re exposing me to inappropriate behavior.”
“Eager to ditch your best friend, huh?” Dean asked, trying not to sound wounded.  Judging by Cas’s frown, he’d failed.
Cas’s eyes were damp.  But they were sincere and wide, and so, so blue, and they stared straight into Dean’s soul for long moments.  When he finally spoke, his voice was low.  “Dean,” he said, “you’ve always been dear to me.”
Dean was still staring Cas down. He was holding the bowl of brocolli close to his chest. “Sammy, tell Cas what a pain it is to maintain a house.”
She was.  She was tall with big eyes and curls in the brown hair she kept swept back from her face.  There was something otherworldly about her, something that reminded Dean of Cas.  She made eye contact with him as he was watching her, and the smile that spread across her face was friendly and sincere.  He’d half been expecting something predatory to come across her face, but her face remained open and happy.
He approached the door.  Should he knock?  Or should he try the door and risk the director’s wrath if it opened and she was there?  He was in the middle of reaching for the doorknob when it opened.
It must have worked because when Dean drew back, his eyes were misty and his smile was back. “I never let myself think I could have this,” he said.
“You spend the whole night ignoring me, you don’t say bye, you don’t text to say you got home safely, then you call me at - 2:09am?  Really, Dean?”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Listen, Aaron, I was just wondering - I’ve got this friend, and she’s kind of - she’s a good gal, and I wanted her to meet some of my friends, just to - y’know.  Expand her circle.  I immediately thought of you, of course, because you’re so - so worldly and - and
The next day Cas lets Dean take clippers to his hair. It’s gotten out of hand, he says, but mostly he wants to feel Dean’s hands again.  Dean turns on the clippers and Cas watches him in the mirror.
“Shouldn’t have brought the pie then,” Cas said, smiling.  He put his first forkful into his mouth, watching Dean all the while.
She smiled.  “I’m not sure,” she said.  “My parents’ health improved, so I’m taking a bit of ‘me time’ while I can.  I’m staying with my friend Gilda for the time being.  We just learned she lives just down the street from Sam.”
Dean’s heart had sunk with every new word that came out of Charlie’s mouth.  Cas had been staying with Sam, and Sam hadn’t said a word?  And Cas was still visiting Daphne?  One of the few ideas that had comforted Dean about this trip of Cas’s was that he was supposed to be
Cas’s ears burned in shame.  Dean’s conditional release from a hefty prison sentence dictated that any calls he made were to be supervised by an agent.  This condition wouldn’t have mattered if the call were on any other day and from some random old friend… but it was Dean’s birthday, and it was Sam.  Dean deserved the privacy that Cas couldn’t give, especially because Cas knew that Sam was having trouble accepting Dean’s situation.  Things between the brothers had been tense since Dean’s disappearance and subsequent capture, and despite Dean asking Sam if they could see each other, Sam had flatly refused, citing the need for more time to come to terms with Dean’s status as a felon.
Dean closed his eyes.  “Yeah, uh.  Look, Charlie, I’m sorry.  It’s - it’s not gonna work out with Aaron.”
Dean barely felt the pain past the difficulty he had processing her words.  “You’re...gay.”  He brought his hand up to his arm as an afterthought.  “You’re gay?”
“To be fair, I like you in anything,” Cas said, and though he’d bared his soul to Dean already, he found himself blushing.
“You haven’t even looked at me since Amara partnered us up.”  It was only the slightest bit accusatory.  Mostly he sounded curious.
Dean did not doubt that she meant it, because that was the kind of person she was.  “Hey, Daphne,” he said.  “You uh - you in town long?”
the elevator doors sliding open to reveal Dean Winchester wearing jeans, a green tee-shirt, his favorite leather jacket, and a smirk.  There were no handcuffs in sight, though Director A. Shurley walked slightly behind him with three junior agents.  They were headed directly toward Cas.
It shouldn’t have hurt so much.  It meant that Dean had known and hadn’t found Cas’s love worth staying for.  “Oh, ‘
“The puppy’s sick.  Eileen had some bad takeout and Willow must have gotten into it from the trash.  Just got back from the vet and they’re gonna keep her overnight just to watch her.”
Cas made the mistake of looking at Dean then, just for a moment - just in time to see a peculiar expression cross Dean’s face at the mention of the director.  Cas stopped typing to stare at Dean in dawning shock.
“I hated my dad,” he had eventually explained a few months later to Cas. “But he was my dad. And I didn’t know that I could be relieved he was dead and still grieve at the same time. So I just kept my mouth shut and didn’t think about it. Took me forever to even start feeling better.”
“I didn’t technically ask you,” Dean said, grinning.  “I said I’d propose, but I didn’t actually propose.”
They sit near the window to eat for the most part.  They chat about the pains of working from home, all while watching the eerily empty streets outside and carefully avoiding the topic that dominates the news.
“I find that difficult to believe,” Gilda said.  She kept smiling like she knew the secrets of the universe.  “You seem to be a very kind person.”
Dean swayed a little more, causing Cas to bump painfully into a table with a muttered expletive. Pulling Dean tighter to his side, Cas replied, “First of all, I’m the dumbass you’re talking about because this is my apartment. Second of all, it’s still January.”
A look at his desktop monitor told Cas he’d spent his whole morning on his computer. “Is it nearly lunchtime already?”
Dean’s smile felt like concrete: cold and immovable.  “Shop’s been getting busy and all; not much sleep.”
Blood rushed in Dean’s ears when the words registered. He and Cas already spent every spare moment together, so it was humanly impossible for Cas to spend any more time with Dean - but Dean knew exactly what Cas meant anyhow. It wasn’t a difficult concept to grasp, after all, that just as Dean had been falling in love, so too had Cas been.
Cas looked up from his phone, seeming to come out of a trance. He looked around at the other restaurant patrons as he straightened in his seat. “Sorry,” he said. “I was just reading something rather engrossing.”
“You’re always in charge of the food and the booze,” Cas said, smacking Dean’s remote control against the palm of his hand and frowning when it still didn’t work.
All of a sudden it occurred to Cas that he was talking to Dean.  Not Dean the felon, not Dean the traitor to the country, not Dean who was
“I’m home,” Dean tried feebly.  When Cas didn’t respond, he groaned.  “I’m sorry, alright?  I don’t know how to act around Daphne!”
Dean didn’t react for a few seconds. He went still, almost eerily so, as he stared at the volume dial.
Cas’s eyes flicker between Dean’s.  He watches carefully for a few moments, and then, so deep and low it’s agonizing, he asks, “What are you waiting for?”  His gaze dips down once more to Dean’s mouth and stays there for a long, tense moment.  He looks up at Dean, then: kind but just a little bit cheeky.  “I don’t think you’re dreaming this time either.”
Cas held up a hand. “I understand,” he said, smiling politely. “Certain… subgenres... are unfortunately stigmatized. We can change the topic. What are your feelings about poetry?”
“You’re the agent and I’m the felon?  Yeah, I know - you’ve only mentioned it twice today and three times every day since I’ve come back.”
“Of course.” Cas pulled his phone away from his ear and did what Sam asked, holding the phone between him and Dean.
“You’d be asleep in your own sweat and vomit it I hadn’t come,” Cas pointed out. He had his fingers curled into his palms and hoped Dean wouldn’t call him out on the obvious tension in his posture. What was it about Dean cast in winter light that made Cas want to burst into flames? Into poetry?
Dean snorted.  Took Cas’s hand himself and pressed it to his mouth.  “I’m the disappointment between the two of us,” he said.  “Or have you missed out on the last few months?”
Cas rolled his eyes but turned to face Dean anyway. “You haven’t had enough water,” he said. For some reason he gently touched the corner of Dean’s left eye. Then he stepped away, smiling. “Keep the bed warm.”
They stood by Dean’s car in an awkward silence for a few moments. The snow around them was light, but it fell steadily, pushed sideways by a light breeze and leaving icy flakes resting on Dean’s coat.  Cas could see some of it slowly melting in Dean’s hair.  The reminder of its transience made him think about Dean, about their friendship, about how the Dean currently standing in front of him would not be the same Dean standing in front of him in two minutes.
“Don’t do it just because you’re lonely, Cas,” Dean said.  He sounded like he was begging, and he supposed he was.  “That’s - that won’t end well for anybody.  Not for you, not for her, not for me.”
Dean was trying to hide a grin. He looked at Cas appraisingly, eyes sparkling. “Y’know, we never had our honeymoon.”
“Things didn’t work out with your brother.” Cas knew himself well enough to know that he had to say it without preamble; he couldn’t, however, bring himself to say Dean’s name.
The arrangements were simple enough: the bureau upgraded Cas’s alarm system and set up security cameras around the perimeter of the house in exchange for housing Dean; Dean was to remain in the house until it was time to go to work; every workday he and Cas were escorted from the door to a waiting car, which would also escort them back to Cas’s house at the end of the day.  Dean stayed in the guest bedroom and made no noise.  Cas cooked.  Dean ate.  They said nothing to each other.
Dean drove for half an hour, then half an hour more. He’d turned down the music five minutes into the drive in respect to Cas’s mood. Eventually, though, after an hour in near-silence, Cas reached forward and turned up the dial, signaling that he was ready to return to Dean. Some vaguely familiar pop song filled the silence.
“What makes you think I’d say yes, anyway?” Cas said, as they walked up Sam’s driveway.  Cas had been angry with Dean throughout the car ride, mostly for making him cry again.
Dean flipped one of the patties on the grill that Cas was pretty sure didn’t need to be flipped. “Thanks for coming,” Dean said, “Sammy’s a sucker for entertaining; you’ve probably made his month.”
“He pretended to retire and orchestrated her promotion with the president’s help.  We figured she’d get sloppy in a position of power.  Then I let myself get caught.  Striking a deal to work with the FBI at that point was easy; she didn’t want me in prison any more than I wanted to be in prison.”
A nervous lump rose in Cas’s throat belatedly. He’d known he was asexual for a number of years at this point, but he’d never felt the desire to share, nor had he ever felt such a desperate need to be forgiven for something he couldn’t help. “I do like you,” Cas explained. “But I’m asexual.”
Cas was pink-cheeked from champagne, his hair was a mess, and Dean was so in love with him it hurt. “What do you need?” he asked, because concentrating on what Cas needed kept Dean from focusing on what Dean wanted.
Dean’s exhaustion was evident by the way he poured himself into the embrace. His breaths were long and deep, heavy with tension. Under Cas’s hands, Dean’s back rose and fell in waves, and Cas was happy to be his anchor.
Dean didn’t want to go that far.  He merely smiled in response.  He sat down and was immediately surprised when Aaron moved to sit next to him in the booth rather than next to Charlie.
Dean closed his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.  He tried to keep his voice steady and detached.  “Dunno.  Went on a trip.  Don’t even know where he is.”
Half-asleep and half-hidden under his blanket, however, he was much more eloquent: “Tell the creep he can fuck off and let us sleep.”
“I’m not friendly.”  It was the first thing Dean thought of to say to stop Aaron from going any further.
Dean let out a triumphant laugh and jabbed a finger in her direction. “Knew you were too smart for Sammy.”
Dean closed his eyes and stifled a pained, lovesick sigh. He cast his mind back to the poem. “I mean - the line about ‘eyes like the sky’ or something. That was - that was cool.”
Cas hadn’t removed his hands from his face; his reply was muffled.  “I don’t know how you’re going to react.”
Cas ignored him.  Dean threw himself onto Cas’s couch - a hand-me-down and probably filthy - and stared up at the ceiling.
Lying there, his mind raced.  Despite the dark and the steady hum of Charlie’s fridge, he couldn’t stop thinking.  Charlie had been right - he was overwhelmed.  Overwhelmed with the things that he should have known, one of those particular things being the knowledge that all of his friends were apparently
A long moment of silence stretches between them.  Finally, Cas says dryly, “You thought you were dreaming.”  He sounds almost irritated.
Dean hadn’t let himself imagine what it would be like to kiss Cas, had decided almost as soon as he realized he had feelings for Cas that there was no future for them anyhow, so he’d locked up whatever thoughts he may have once had about Cas’s lips and shoved them into the attic of his brain.  Because of this, the hesitation he showed before kissing Cas was genuine. He’d kissed a lot of people, but this was Cas, the person he’d called family since he was 17 years old and angry at the world, and no kiss could ever communicate the depth of gratitude Dean had for him.
Dean’s expression was blank, carefully composed. Cas watched his fingers curl back into his palms. “Okay,” Dean said slowly, “I thought we had a good time.” He placed his hands on the steering wheel and stared at the center console. “But fair enough. I’m not going to ask why.”
“You know you don’t have to be here,” Dean said eventually. He was leaning against the kitchen counter. The meters between them felt like the length of a football field.
Cas has moved toward him.  The few feet between the table and the sink have shrunk beneath Cas’s steps forward.  His cheeks are flushed, and his mouth is parted.  It might be the most beautiful Cas has ever been.
About a week later, Dean received a call from an unfamiliar phone number. He had just gotten home from the store and was about to settle in at his laptop to work. “Yeah,” he said, once he answered the call. He started inputting his laptop password one letter at a time with his free hand.
Dean smiled, huffing a laugh into the air between their chests and licking his lips at the sight of Cas’s dick disappearing and reappearing between their joined hands.  His own erection was impatient in his shorts, but the desire to get off was nothing compared to the desire to let Cas spill all over their hands for the first time.  He pressed a kiss to Cas’s sweaty temple and studied the bow of Cas’s back, the muscles that tightened every time he shoved his hips forward.  He couldn’t see Cas’s face, but he could imagine it just fine: a mess of pleasure and frustration in every clench of his jaw, every lick of his lips, every furrow of his brow.  The sounds Cas was making against Dean’s neck were obscene - quiet grunts and swallows between breaths that shook that sent shivers down Dean’s spine.
The apartment is silent save for the whir of the fridge and the swing of the ceiling fan. If Cas listened really closely he might be able to hear the murmur of conversation from his neighbors, but right now he’s focused in on Dean, who’s living and breathing in front of him, a testament to the wonders of the universe.
Dean leans in and meets the press of Cas’s lips with his.  The first touch is tentative, but instantly Dean is warmed from the inside out. Every slow press and pull, every new bit of heat, every delighted laugh Cas makes between kisses makes Dean’s stomach flip.  It soothes the tension in Dean, unknotting the fear and mortification of a rejection that was never a rejection, in a dream that was never a dream.
“Too late. I have two weeks starting next Thursday.” It gave him two days to help Dean before the opening on Saturday.
Willow licked Dean’s chin.  “Your mommy’s keeping your daddy busy, isn’t she?” he asked her.  His nose wrinkled.  “No time to give you a bath, I’m guessing.”
When Charlie called, Dean had already chugged half of his drink in a preemptive maneuver to make the coming conversation a little easier.
Cas smiled at the road. “I think I’ve spent enough time feeling sorry for myself. Let’s go back, Dean.”
Cas smiled, his eyes drifting closed. “I don’t doubt it,” he said. It was the confidence in his answer that fueled Dean’s reply.
Cas looked at Dean from across the apartment. There was dawning glee in his eyes as he realized his power. “
But what was really plaguing Dean’s consciousness and keeping him from sleep was the fact that his lack of self-awareness had kept him from realizing the
With nothing else to stall the moment, Cas finally looked at Dean.  Despite the time that had passed, Dean looked exactly like the Dean of two years ago: the same one for whom Cas had bought Christmas presents, the same one who kept Cas company on his birthday, the same one who had been there for Cas for all of the important and unimportant days.  No one looking at Deam would have been able to tell that he had spent the last two years committing felonies left and right, on the run from the bureau that had been poised to employ him had he just stayed true.  It discomfited Cas, because standing in front of him was the Dean of his young adulthood, the Dean of the past two years, and the Dean of right now - all in one.  He wasn’t sure he could separate them.
Dean glared at Cas over the phone between them. He was sitting up in Cas’s bed, leaning against the headboard, even though Cas had repeatedly asked Dean to lie down and try to get some sleep. Eventually Cas had abandoned his attempts at getting Dean to comply and got Sam on the phone.
“That’s not - “ Cas was sure there was a speech somewhere in his head, but he cut himself off to step closer, close enough to see Dean’s pupils dilate, figuring maybe that closeness was what would get through to Dean - and it worked, because Dean’s expression changed instantly from exasperation to surprise, then dawning realization.
Dean gave Cas a reproachful look, but at least his hands were moving toward the pie.  “If you say so.”  He cut out a slice and placed it on Cas’s plate, rolling his eyes at Cas’s indignation.  “Stop it, you big baby,” Dean said.  “I’ll live if I don’t get the first slice of pie.”
The significance of the moment fell like a boulder in Cas’s stomach. For years, he’d wondered if there were something more to Dean’s feelings for him - if the lingering touches and looks and laughter were consequences of those feelings - but Cas had always been careful never to push, because nothing was worth losing Dean as a friend, especially not the barest, most remote possibility that Dean wanted Cas back in that way.
It took a few moments for Cas’s words to sink in. Dean’s ears heated at the conclusion Cas had reached, but he’d been given an opportunity to move past the question for the foreseeable future and he was going to take it, assumptions be damned.
There was a knock on Cas’s open door.  Cas, sitting in a gown in the hospital bed, looked up.  Special Agent Dean Winchester hovered at the threshold, unsure.  He was holding a bag in his hands.
It’s not fun, being the only player in the league out of the closet.  His teammates don’t treat him any differently, but Dean sometimes feels like he’s slowly being frozen out.
Dean felt the flutter of Cas’s eyelashes against his neck. “I love you,” Cas said. “Can’t remember a time I haven’t.”
Dean came to him about a half hour later with two beers in his hand. Sam edged away so that Dean could get between him and Cas. Cas was not ignorant of the elbow nudge that Sam gave to Dean.
“I’m sorry this hasn’t been particularly festive,” Cas said. Up close, his lips shone from the whiskey. “Christmas dinner without the Christmas.”
“Surprise,” Dean said grudgingly, as a chorus of excited shouts emerged from the house. Inside, Kaia had gathered a few of Claire’s friends and put up decorations. “Don’t trash our house, please.”
This year, however, there was something about the way the Christmas lights played across Dean’s face as he drove that made Cas a little nostalgic for the Christmases he never had.
She stared at him with a contemplative smile on her face for a long beat, then she was nodding, and Dean was trailing after her toward the bar.  He could feel eyes on the back of his head.  Cas?  Sam?  Charlie?  Everyone?  Who knew?  But Dean was going to try his damnedest to get something out of this night, especially if Cas -
Eventually Cas starts joining him for breakfast, but Dean is still without fail the one standing at the stove every morning with a spatula in his hand.
Cas grit his teeth against Dean’s weight as he guided him to bed. Meanwhile, Dean was critiquing his surroundings.
“Morning, Cas,” Dean says out loud.  His voice has the same dulled quality.  “Morning, Cas,” he repeats a little louder, massaging his ear.
“You were the bait,” Cas said, suddenly understanding, suddenly terrified for the Dean of three years ago.  “He asked you to become - you were a traitor to the FBI, just like she was.”
Cas had hoped it would allay whatever worries Dean had, but Dean just put his beer down on the floor next to the rug and scrubbed both hands down his face. He looked exhausted when he turned his face to meet Cas’s gaze. “Cas, you bought this house for your future, right? So save it for - you know. That.”
Cas shook himself out of his reverie a few seconds later, giving Dean a close-lipped smile. “I know you’re not a big poetry fan, but you should read it.”
Cas didn’t let himself dwell on Dean’s tone because he couldn’t afford to. The truth was on the tip of his tongue, and he was going to get it out, shaky voice and aching heart be damned, because if Dean wanted to leave Cas’s life, let it be because of the truth: “My apple pie life is the one where I can sit in front of a fireplace with you, Dean. Just you. That someone I want to grow old with? That’s you.”
“What?” Cas said, scowling a little.  “I didn’t know you had feelings for me until yesterday.  How am I supposed to know what’s - ”
Aaron opened his mouth.  Closed it.  Opened it again.   “I don’t understand,” he said, laughing a little bit.  Disbelieving.  “You - you messaged me and introduced me to your friends - “
His eyes snapped open and met Dean’s amused ones.  “Do you normally try to attack your guests after they’ve fallen asleep?” Dean asked.  Cas’s hand had made contact with Dean’s chest, and Dean had caught Cas’s hand and hadn’t let go.
“So I can do what I want,” Dean said easily, sitting down and pulling his chair in.  Once again, he laid his leg against Cas’s.  He took a bite of pie and winked at Cas.
active online life, several video game tournament trophies on her walls, and two cats named Xena and Gabrielle.  She seemed content with her life.  But Dean couldn’t help but think she seemed a little lost at times.  A little lonely.
