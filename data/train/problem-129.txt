Before Sherlock can reply, the sound of Rosie stirring drifts into the hall. John’s on his feet instantly. Sherlock gets up as well and turns to go downstairs, not wanting to intrude. Before he get far, John grabs the edge of his sleeve and motions for Sherlock to follow him into the room.
“Hold up,” says John. “Whoever it is has access to his office, why bother breaking in here? Wouldn’t there be plenty of items they could use from there?”
John gulps. “When I was hurt, in hospital. You took me there?”
John frowns and looks at her sternly, and she grows more serious.
Victor, although he joins John for meals, seems to be keeping a polite distance. John’s not sure if it’s because he doesn’t want to disturb him or if spending time with John is too painful a reminder of Sherlock. Or perhaps John still presents too much of a temptation in his grief.
Sherlock glances at John. “Neither. I felt like dancing. I haven’t done it in a long time. You were the only person there who was not completely odious to me. It made sense at the time. Did I embarrass you?”
Moriarty shrugged, and did not move away. “What can I say, no one’s perfect. And since we are the only two of a kind in the world, what you do
John nods, a little uncertainly.
John shifts down, still stroking him slowly, until he is lined up with Sherlock and can wrap his hand around both of them as if they were one flesh. Sherlock gasps at the feeling of John on him, against him, practically part of him. He lets their legs tangle together as John keeps a steadily tempo, somehow knowing just the right amount of pressure, letting speed and strength build slowly. Sherlock holds them together with one arm circling under John’s neck and the other on the small of his back, and John inches even closer until their hips are almost fused and Sherlock is amazed John can find room to maneuver between them at all.
“Oh, I just informed my brother that Sir Robert over there has been funnelling Ministry of Defence funding not to the domestic anti-terrorism project he’s been appointed to supervise but to a rather lavish vacation home in southern Spain. And a rather young Spanish gentleman who attends him there.”
The twenty-first day was clear and crisp, and unseasonably cold. It was intolerably bright and sunny, especially for such a chilly summer’s day. John hadn’t brought a jacket and the wind bit at him, but he didn’t shiver. He was lost in his thoughts and it took him a few moments to notice a female figure standing in the trees just beyond the grave.
your plaything. And if you keep using it like it is, you can’t always expect to like the results.”
“You have started it. So have I. Just because we haven’t gotten up doesn’t mean the day hasn’t begun.”
“I know how we encountered her,” John says through clenched teeth, wondering if he’s actually going to be able to do this.
you,” John corrects, trying avoid inflating Sherlock’s ego any further.
He indulges his theatrical side in revealing his return to his other friends and derives some satisfaction from their reactions. Although admittedly, given Mrs. Hudson’s age and health, he probably should have chosen a more subtle entrance back into Baker Street. Still, no harm done.
John doesn't move. IT'S AT HOME. I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE LEAVING IT IN THE HOSPITAL, IT'S LOCKED UP AT HOME AND I WAS GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO MYCROFT.
Mycroft lets him be for a moment while he grapples with this new understanding and then says, with surprising gentleness, "Sherlock, we have to go. If you are going to get out of this city undetected, we can't wait any longer."
“If that’s your way of saying thank you for saving your life again, you’re welcome,” John says dryly, unable to avoid a small smile at Sherlock’s predictable myopia. “Now can we please get dinner? You may not need food when you’re working but I can’t live on biscuits and adrenaline.”
The others in the lorry are moving now, and he’s about to be well and truly overwhelmed.
"You're massaging my earlobes with your thumb and forefinger." Sherlock just manages to keep his voice steady. There appear to be nerves that run directly from his ears to his groin and they are firing on all cylinders.
But, Sherlock now realised, he wouldn’t have been able to resist leaving something behind. A hint, a last gloating message. Something Sherlock could use to find him, intentionally or not. That was his weakness – he couldn’t resist boasting, toying with people, with Sherlock particularly. He wanted Sherlock to
“Trust fund?” John supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Sherlock never seemed to be wanting for cash, despite mostly not getting paid for his work, and it was no secret that the Holmes family was well off.
“Yes,” agrees Sherlock, as if he does not, in fact, find that reassuring at all.
Mycroft chuckles. “Oh, the charges would have been cleared whether our friend wanted them to be or not. No, I showed him what Sherlock could do for him. It didn’t take much nudging. He was eager to make a name for himself. I only asked that he keep Sherlock…busy. And out of trouble as far as he was capable. The arrangement worked better than I had hoped. Lestrade had real need of Sherlock, and Sherlock listened to him more than to me, because Lestrade had something he actually wanted.”
John pulls at his still-ringing ear. “I’m sure you find having a good think to be endlessly entertaining, but if all I’m allowed to do is sit there as you imitate a statue, I might as well get some rest while you’re at it. Now, did you figure anything out?”
Victor’s grief he can accept. John's not sure he can believe any grief could be as great as his, but it's of the same quality and sincerity, and John is grateful for it.
As a lover, Sherlock is magnificent, creative, and surprisingly talkative. John is more the quiet type, though hardly passive, but he enjoys Sherlock's stream of consciousness, his unpredictability, when it is on display. Often he takes the scientific approach, such as laying John out in front of the fire, licking a patch of skin and then blowing on it, observing the minute movements of the hairs, the time it takes to pucker into gooseflesh, and comparing the rates on different parts of John, providing a never-ceasing narrative about nerves, follicles, and temperature differentials as he ravishes John from head to toe. Or informing John that he is going to count every freckle on his body and that John is not permitted to move until he is finished.
John holsters his weapon, and tries to slow his heartbeat and get his breath back. “And for you?”
“Will you tell me what it is?”
his girlfriend – she had been too smart for that. She understood, better than he had at the time, the nature of his relationship with Sherlock and had known better than to put herself in the middle of it. Still, she cared about him, and accepted Sherlock as part of his life, as the most important part, in a way no other girl had. And Sherlock, while jealous of the time he spent with her, had not hated her the way he had loathed the other women John had gone out with, never tried to actively get rid of her.
“I don’t want to. I don’t want to tame you or cage you. I want you wild and free and impossible like you are. But just because I accept, hell, love the danger doesn’t mean I’m okay with things bordering on self-abuse and suicide for no real reason. I just want us to stick to necessary danger. It’s not like we’ve a shortage of it.”
“I’ve an idea about that,” Victor says after a moment’s thought. “But you probably won’t like it.”
"I would have done anything you asked of me, you know," John continues, no longer yelling and his voice low and unsteady in a way that is physically painful to hear. "If you'd asked me to wait for you, I'd have waited until hell froze over. If you'd asked me to follow you I'd have given up everything and plunged after you into the unknown, for as long as it took. If you'd asked me to die for you I would have stood there and let the sniper take his best shot at me. But you asked me to let you go. And I did."
“Why not?” demands Sherlock, but without conviction.
“Alright, I won’t.” Sherlock stands and hustles him to the door. “I took your case. The wife you love so much killed her mother and tried to blame it on you. Now you’re free to go stuff your drongo, or whatever unholy idiom you ridiculous people use, to your heart’s content.” He slams the door in the face of the useless Aussie and throws himself back into his chair, hard enough to make the metal whine in protest.
“John’s all right?” Sherlock demands.
"I'm the surgeon, remember? You first." And with one jerky, impossibly fast movement John leaps wide-eyed towards him and grabs the back of his neck with one hand, driving the long, fearsome needle upwards, deep into Sherlock's foramen magnum with the other. Sherlock's world shatters with pain and then, blessedly, melts into darkness.
"No, you wouldn't have. They're active mainly on the Continent, based out of Belgium. Racketeering, smuggling, general thievery, that sort of thing. Very large ring, been around for ages, but never a major player. They don't like messy business, so they've stayed out of the spy game, as well as the sex and drugs trade. It's been a successful strategy - they make money but never get in too much trouble or threaten anyone extraordinarily dangerous. To my knowledge, this is the first action they've taken on British soil."
“And mine.”
They stop on a little patio at the end of the conservatory, under an arch covered in twining vines that bear fragrant white flowers. She's a good five inches taller than he is, and isn't much younger, but when the soft light catches her just right she looks like a girl. He reaches up and brushes a strand of hair off her face.
"I won't miss," and there's a glint in John's eye and a brief stabilizing of his right hand that says no, he won't miss. "And I won't let them get you."
When he got home, the lights were all off and the house was filled with the sound of a violin concerto. For a moment, he was encouraged. At least Sherlock was feeling well enough to play again – some progress. But then he realised what he was hearing was a recording. His heart leapt to his throat. Something was wrong. The first floor was empty. He rushed upstairs. No one in the bathroom. The door to his room was ajar – he’d left it closed, as he always did, in a vain attempt to prevent Sherlock from going through his things.
The clerk nods sympathetically. “It’s hard to maintain a lifestyle change without support of your loved ones.”
He begins to feel ashamed, dirty, but John forces Sherlock’s attention back to him before the emotion can penetrate. “Now,” he says, and rolls onto his back, pulling Sherlock down to him. Sherlock obliges, still trembling with his own release, wrapping his mouth around John and tasting his own semen on John’s head. John is so close, skirting the edge, and after only a few long licks, the barest amount of pressure, John is arching up, shaking, spilling himself into Sherlock and then trickling hot and pungent down the back of his mouth. Sherlock swallows, eliciting as much gratification from the taste, the sensation of John giving him everything, as he had from his own pleasure.
why he invited you here, isn’t it? One day you will have to tell me about your childhood…it must have been so carefree.”
John gasps and goes to touch his face but Sherlock shrugs him off, harshly. “I’m uninterested in your pity, John. And none of this is relevant to the problem you seemed to have been having yesterday.”
“No, nothing. But it has to be them… I know they don’t take betrayal lightly. I don’t think they want me back. I think they want me dead!”
He has a fine view too when, later in the afternoon, Victor strides purposefully into the garden clutching a glass of cold ginger beer like a shield. He offers to it Justin, who is still working on the rose trellis and sweating from the sun and the labour. Like watching a silent movie, Sherlock sees Victor's trembling hand brush Justin's as he hands him the drink, so brief it might have been an accident, and Justin look surprised, then thoughtful, then pleased. He motions for Victor to come sit in the shade with him.
-me-just-leave-all-my-love-to-John!’ ” Sherlock looks entirely pleased with himself.
"So, that means for me, now..."
John released him, none to gently. “I had no intention of murdering you, that would be far too quick.”
“Did you ever see that boy again? From the party?”
“Quite right.” Sherlock smiled. “Well, that’s it for today. What say we go for Sunday lunch? I’m famished! And then – we have rather a backlog of applications for casework, if I’m not mistaken.”
Sherlock awoke slowly, to darkness. He was stationary now. The last few times he had woken there had been motion – a train, a ship, then a truck of some kind. Each time he’d only had a few moments to gauge his whereabouts before being drugged again. He had no idea how much time had passed, but knew it must have been days at least. He knew they had been heading north, and must be quite a ways away from Croatia now, possibly in Scandinavia?
“He always does,” John sighs. “Why is he always so –”
you anything John. I didn’t want you here. It’s too dangerous.”
He tries to think of something, anything else but his mind keeps looping itself, refusing to move away from the questions in a straight line, and nothing will alter its course. Well, one thing would. But he’s kept his promise and hasn’t touched a thing since the conclusion of the Culverton Smith case, and with Rosie in the house now there’s definitely a zero-tolerance policy in effect. He doesn’t have a stash left in any case, even if he were inclined to risk blowing up what’s left of his relationship for a few hours of quieter thoughts.
Mycroft shakes his head. “No, nothing like what I am sure you are imagining. But it’s not good for him when you’re gone.”
John shakes his head, violently. IT WASN'T OKAY. I'M GLAD IT CAME OUT RIGHT, THAT YOU'RE DOING BETTER AND NOT. NOT LIKE YOU WERE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT I DID WAS RIGHT. I DIDN'T ASK, I JUST TOOK.
Sherlock lifted his head and looked John directly in his eyes, stormy blue and hard like flint right now. “I thought of you everyday, John. I swear.”
“The police are on their way but might be an hour. You didn’t call them earlier?”
Sherlock finally pays attention. He blinks rapidly for a moment. “What are you… concerned…about?”
“It’s not her virtue I’m worried about,” John snarls.
“That you’ll be gone. That you will be gone forever and I will have to keep on without you.”
The phone was empty except for his own mobile number in the contacts. There were signs of a number of deleted outgoing text messages, probably automated and triggered by certain activities, but no way to quickly retrieve them. And there was one incoming text message, sent less than an hour ago. Two lines of text from a blocked number. The first read “
John nods, a little relieved. So far no one else believed in Sherlock as he did, without reservation or uncertainty. He sits beside Victor, gingerly, still not feeling as if he’s really in his body.
Sherlock furrows his brow for moment and then brightens, grabbing John’s hand and half dragging him downstairs.
“Drug addled?” Sherlock snaps.
Greg nods his acceptance reluctantly.  "What will you do?"
Sherlock
Reversing the route that mere hours ago had left him feeling as lost as a man in a jungle is now so simple as to require almost no thought at all. He rides the Tube the requisite five stops, hops off, enters Bart's, and hits the elevator button for the roof without even having to consider a single step of it. It's a luxury, he knows now.
“Maybe I’m just pleased with
Together they searched the house for any paperwork Moran had left behind. Sherlock took his laptop and financial records. “This won’t have any information about Moriarty’s people that I don’t already have, but I’ll have Moran bankrupted before he can get out of the country.”
“It’s not your fault, you know.”
"Yes."
“In addition, there is this – I didn’t think it too relevant since I was planning on killing you anyway, but it seems I may need an extra inducement, both for you and Dr. Watson, if he’s as stubborn as you are.” He held up a mobile. Sherlock’s mobile, which he had left on the roof before he jumped. It had been supposed to reach Lestrade, his recorded conversation with Moriarty the only solid proof he had to clear his name when this was all over. Lestrade would have known what to do with it, kept it safe. Moran’s people must have gotten to it before anyone else could, probably when they went searching Moriarty’s body for the smartphone Sherlock had nicked.
“I know,” Sherlock says miserably.
“I don’t care about safe, I don’t care about pain, I just want you, nothing but you, John, please…”
He had been washed and shaved, and was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt which appeared to be his own, possibly salvaged from his luggage. He refused to dwell on who had done the washing and the dressing and concentrated on absorbing as much detailed about his surroundings as possible. The owner of the house was certainly not interested in restraint – he was clearly vested in shoving a message of dominance down his guests’ throats. That squared with Sherlock’s profile of Moran.
“Sir Trevor is paying the fees,” Justin adds.
John tells him in his ear. The speed with which Sherlock manages to get them out of the building and procure them a taxi is nothing short of miraculous.
John looks at him in utter surprise. “Go on…” he says slowly.
this tea? It tastes like a cow regurgitated a sugar factory.”
someone….why someone like little old me! We’d make a great team, don’t you think? Well, in a sense we already do…We have such a long and
"You look lonely, like you could use a woman, eh?"
“Kebab,” John says firmly, not wanting to find out if the burly thief’s affection for Sherlock extends to nocturnal takeaway orders.
“Oh. Well, then whose house are we in?”
“You don’t have to say anything,” John said quickly, hoping to still forestall it. “It’s fine.”
“Not on my own. You?”
“I’ll be back within the week. In accordance with our agreement.”
After the horrible incident in the abattoir, in which Sherlock comes closer than he knows to dying and John kills a man with more raw brutality than he has ever before displayed, things have no hope of staying the same. As Sherlock whispers to him deliriously about beauty and starlight and the suns that live in John’s chest, and John cannot stop himself from kissing the top of Sherlock’s head as he holds him to try and warm his hypothermic body, John knows they will not be able to resist each other much longer. It both delights and terrifies him.
John went upstairs. “Well, you could have handled that better,” he told himself as he changed. But at least he seemed to have averted the worst of the damage. He always forgot how sensitive Sherlock could be. He was so arrogant so much of the time, when you hit a nerve it was unexpected and shocking how easy he was to hurt. And when he was hurt, he could give it right back tenfold.
“Sherlock, please tell me you didn’t just do a fucking speedball! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is? Any at all? Of course you do, you’re a genius, you know exactly how stupid and insane that is. Were you actually trying to kill yourself?”
John hangs his head, avoiding Sherlock’s eyes. “There were other ways, there had to have been. What I did… that can’t have been the only solution.”
John closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose. So here it was. He knew, in some way, that this conversation was inevitable, but he had hoped that it would never happen, that they could go on as they were, not discussing it and not admitting that there was anything to discuss. But Sherlock had clearly been worrying lately, and John knew he would not drop a subject until it was resolved to his satisfaction.
“The boy, he died first. His eyes were open and flies came and laid on them. His tongue lolled out, it was almost black with thirst and swollen. I asked later if they’d taken him to his mother at least, and the sergeant laughed and said he was with her, alright.” John swallows. “Then it was my turn, I could feel it starting at my feet, going up my knees, to my intestines and kidneys and liver, all shutting down, one by one. I felt dizzy and then it was dark. It was nice. It was cool. I was alone. I was so glad.”
Sherlock keeps his body a respectable distance from John’s, but sweeps him along smoothly, telegraphing every step. He’s right, it really is simple when your partner knows what he’s doing. And Sherlock definitely knows what he’s doing. He dances with an easy, careless grace, like he’s been doing this his whole life. All John has to do is follow. That’s all John ever has to do, really.
John flushes at the memory of his response, how he’d felt the warmth spreading in his loins and how his heart had skipped a beat at the sight of her. He had hoped the drugging would have made Sherlock forget.
“I’ve got a sore bum that could argue with you.”
want to be found. He wasn’t taking any risks that Sherlock would be unable to solve the puzzle. The numbers merely corresponded to the alphabet on a phone keypad. He deduced the most likely letters to be used in combination with each other. Leaving off the leading null, it left him with:
“Shut up.”
specifically if John would like him to play for him is when he knows he’s done something wrong he should apologise for, but won’t, or when John is ill or injured.
John grins to himself. “I would think that should be obvious by now, but yes. Tattoo your name on my heart, I’m all yours.” Sherlock perks up noticeably and John amends, “
He shakes off the memories and climbs the carved stone stairs. The Victor who greets John in the cavernous hall is subdued, shaking his hand solemnly and offering a weak but genuine smile.
again. If you can’t handle that, then I don’t know if I can do this.”
“He doesn’t trust me.”
, as the saying goes. You?”
And Sherlock feels John’s fury and John’s terror and John’s devotion in every movement, he feels the abandon, that John is giving Sherlock everything, every bit of him, even now, even when John could easily lose it all, lose Sherlock and everything he’s given Sherlock, still he gives more. John is claiming him this way, John is trying to hold on to him, trying to keep him here the only way he knows how. John won’t let the void have him, he won’t let anyone have him, not even his own fickle mind.
“Sherlock! Sherlock slow down. What did you find out?”
Before Sherlock quite knows what he is doing, he is leaning forward, pressing his lips to John’s with too much pressure, hard and unpractised, and made awkward by a complete lack of response from John. He breaks it off, still tasting salt and whiskey, and draws back, not sure where to look.
The feeling of being inside Sherlock, though no less profound, was at least slightly more familiar territory for John and he luxuriated in Sherlock’s bony hips bucking against him, and the sound of his deep voice first begging, then ordering him to move, thrust harder, deeper, faster against him, growing hoarse with desire as they both drew near again and plunged over the edge together, at last collapsing on the bed, John still inside Sherlock, showering his back and sharp shoulder blades with kisses as they slowly came down.
John continues, careful but resolute. "I've built a new life, Sherlock. It took a long time and it's not what I hoped for once. It came from the worst pain I've ever known. But it is a life. I have a home of my own now, and a practice. And Mary. I need to keep those things.
John approaches warily, unable to convince the taxi to wait or even drive to the end of the lane. As he draws nearer, he spies a few signs of recent habitation and wonders what kind of person could live like this without even attempting upkeep to the place.
One night, several months after Sherlock’s death, the doorbell rang. The doorbell never rang anymore. John was taken aback to find Sarah standing on the stoop. He hadn’t seen her in a half a year, had heard she was abroad doing Doctors Without Borders or some other such thing. He had felt guilty about how things had ended between them and decided it was best for them both to just let her fade out of his life.
“It’s forgotten,” Victor assures him, but his face is pained.
“I punched him in the stomach,” John said, a little smugly. Sherlock gave that little private smile he had when he was very pleased about something, and John filled him in on the events since he had left London. Sherlock seemed very nearly impressed with John’s accomplishments and listened with remarkably few interruptions.
The crackle between them is palpable as they banter over her case, sexual and intellectual energy so thick in the air that John can't help but burst out in jealousy. They both look at him like they'd forgotten he was there and then continue as if he isn't. He's not sure who he's more angry at right now, but stays because there's no way in hell he's leaving them alone like this.
“No, really, if it weren’t obvious enough from the fact that she was willing to run down to the hospital after midnight just to do a favour for you, I know what you smell like when you’ve been around a woman you’ve shagged.”
“Like,” replies Sherlock grimly, “the fact that Mrs. Hudson thinks our flat would be the perfect location in which to host a Christmas party.”
… 0.618034…”
at that part.”
“My brother himself is bad enough, even if he’s genuinely concerned with my health. But I don’t trust his resources, and I don’t trust him to be able to resist using them. And that could be disastrous.”
“I thought you were
“I was afraid if he had you, they might accidentally get you killed.”
He remembers Hanna alluding to Moriarty in passing, but in the same shadowy way pretty much everyone else seemed to. This is getting him nowhere.
Sherlock shrugs him off and knocks the glass to the floor. “I don’t need your help, I’m not a child!”
“And you’re sure it will wash out?”
On the train, John does something he's been avoiding for nearly a month now. He thinks about Sherlock.
“In the mood to what? Get your sight back? Now, work you stubborn arse.”
John reads his mind, or at least his sudden tension, and announces, "I don't know about you but I think a shower is definitely called for." He scrambles to his feet. "Coming?"
She moved in front of him and carefully entered a long string of letters and numbers, shielding her fingers from his view. Then she motioned for him to do the same.
Sherlock explains as briefly and simply as he can, about Moriarty, the contract on John and the others, the plan he hatched with Molly and Mycroft to escape, why it was vital John know nothing of it.
“Oh, you definitely do.”
“Yes.”
“Of course not.” Sherlock seems surprised he would ask.
He's ashamed of how relieved he is when John returns.
“Well, you deduced wrong. Berk!”
“Better?” John asks finally, twisting to look up at him.
so much.”
Sherlock tries to hide his thoughts, his near frenzy but he knows he must be betraying his reactions to John however hard he tries to keep them under control. John’s fingers feel worried and he’s talking about open cases now, trying to get Sherlock to work, to deduce, to be himself. But it’s not going to help this time, because he’s not himself any longer. How can he possibly be Sherlock Holmes like this? How could he ever be again?
“That’s a first,” John mumbles, narrowing his eyes at Sherlock. Nevertheless he forces a smile and a friendly nod at the fussy woman. “What kind of paperwork is this that requires a registrar, anyway?”
“Same as you, I’d imagine. I heard the news. I couldn’t believe it, so I had to come and see for myself. It’s quite dangerous for me to be here, as you may have guessed. My circumstances have been…much reduced…but I still have some resources, it just took a little time to get myself here safely.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he said, sincerely. “I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Sherlock had suspected as much, at least that some kind of scan would have to happen. He didn't know of any diseases of the eye that would cause instant blindness like that, although he'd rather been hoping John did. "You do it."
“Then what
It starts with a dance. It ends with blood. There is not so much distance between the two as one might think. Most things worth doing ultimately require either blood or tears and this one will extract both. But that is not for a long time yet.  This is just the beginning, and right now there is only dancing.
Suddenly a flash of lightening illuminates the sky above them, deafening thunder sounding at the same instant, near enough to physically feel it. The murderer is taken by surprise and stumbles for a moment, just long enough for John to use the light to aim and fire. He doesn’t startle - he’s quite used to loud bangs and flashes of light very close to him.
In a flash, Sherlock has John backed unresisting to the cold tile of the wall and John is pressing up into him with equal intensity, hips jutting into Sherlock's thighs and stomach warm and soft against Sherlock's pelvis. John rises on his toes to reach Sherlock's mouth with his own, his hands sketching the lines of Sherlock's body as if to remind himself, and then running them underneath Sherlock's greatcoat, clutching at the small of his back, his shoulders. John lets out something between a sob and a moan, barely audible, and allows Sherlock to work a knee between his thighs.
“I’ll take those,” John said, keeping the barrel of his gun nestled in the back of Moran’s skull as he relieved him of his weapons. “And that,” he added, taking Sherlock’s mobile out of his hand.
“Papa?”
"I have an active imagination."
"You would have," Sherlock insists. "I know it."
“Why do you borrow mine?”
John nods. "Yes, of course. Sorry, I'll just be..."
“John,” Sherlock cries as his climax builds almost against his will, hoping to be heard. “John.”
going to happen to him."
John creeps up to the side of the lorry. The driver is on the phone now.
John raises his eyebrows. “Well, what then? Do you want me to leave now, get out of his life? Because that’s really none of your damn business. Come to think of it, none of this is.”
"Yes, really." He's dead serious. "I didn't say he was nice or kind or even always good. He can be cruel and selfish and cold. He's got a side to him that could go to the bad in an instant, and a wicked drug habit. He is often hurtful and completely unaware of and uninterested in the needs or feelings or even the existence of others."
"You said to stay out of the Yard," John points out.
“I’m yours, too. I’ll try to remember that. I can’t promise about the danger because I don’t… I don’t always realise what I’m doing, what it looks like to other people. But I’ll try. And you can keep me as long as you like.”
“Thank you,” Victor says, warmly. “Really. And you should take your own advice.”
on you. I have called in elite trained, MI-6 forces, in numbers ten times what you could possibly have guarding this building. They have been alerted to all the places you could possibly have hidden snipers in and around the theatre, and those men are probably already dead.”
what it is you've gotten yourself into..."
Sherlock groans. “God save us both if I ever become that snobby or you that flamboyant.”
Sherlock makes a noise of frustration. “But we are the same. And yet not. Or at least… she’s who I might have been. If I’d been born different, if I’d been female. She’s just as clever. It’s merely a different kind. I’m clever about facts, she’s clever about people. She can read a person, a social situation the way I read a crime scene. She’s like an alternate history to myself. All the skills I lack, she possesses.”
Sherlock shakes his head, uncomprehending. "Please, let me try..."
“Of course you have, everyone’s seen it before,” Sherlock snaps. “It’s a golden spiral, a spiral that gets further from its origin by a factor of 1.618034 for each quarter turn it makes. Or, since he started at the outside, one that decreases in distance from the origin by a factor of 0.618034 for every quarter turn. We’re looking for some kind of mathematician!”
Mary gives him a queer look. “Don’t you? You planned our wedding, you became protective of me once you knew John loved me, you've endured the place of a friend when you wanted so much more. That’s what it is. Doing what is in the best interest of someone, despite personal risk or cost, even if it jeopardises your relationship with them or they are unaware of what you‘re doing or why.”
“Stop apologising,” Sherlock snaps at him. “It doesn’t help.”
“I told you,” Sherlock mumbles, “nothing is going to happen until at least February. Well, I say nothing… We needn’t concern ourselves at present.”
He follows John docilely out of the hospital and on to the street, that thought choking out all other thoughts now. It’s busy and it takes a little while to get a taxi. The street is strange and daunting in this state, just walking, even with John’s aid, seems as treacherous as crossing the Himalayas on foot with a murderous horde at his heels.
. The streets here were brick or cobble, hard to follow, and constantly changing names, with buildings from the 1600’s and on built nearly on top of each other. It didn’t help that he didn’t read Croatian. But eventually he managed to locate the right street and follow it to a small but brightly painted tobacconist’s shop in a busy little neighborhood, far away from where tourists normally strayed.
His lips slam into John’s bruisingly as he pulls John tight to him with a long arm around his waist.
Aside from that moment of discomfort, the rest of the celebration goes smashingly. It’s rare he’s able to nab a killer and save the victim as well. Though of course John gets credit for the actual lifesaving portion. He’s pleased with how his composition for the Watsons’ first dance had turned out and the guests are suitably admiring of his skill. He’s even managed to charm Janine by, largely, being himself. Albeit a slightly more attentive and extroverted version. Her company is surprisingly tolerable, though he has other reasons to want to be in her good graces.
“Great, thank you for keeping count, I hadn’t noticed,” John said sourly.
They reach the door of John’s room and John leans against the frame.
“Oh, thank God,” he says, sinking to the ground against a nearby tree, his body having finally caught up with what’s happened to him now that the adrenaline is used up, swelling pinching nerves along his spine. No amount of willpower will make his legs carry him further.
“Only officially,” she shrugged. “In fact, I’m officially dead twice, so I suppose they cancel each other out.”
The question answers itself. There, in Sherlock's bed - their bed - lies the Woman. She has showered in their shower, is wearing Sherlock's clothes, and sleeping between their sheets. She looks small and fragile and John kind of wants to strangle her for it.
Sherlock makes a soft sound into John’s hair, and they wait in silence for the police, soaked, freezing, bleeding, together.
not-that
“Sure,” she says, and opens her mouth like she’s going to say something else, probably about when Sherlock might be round again, but thinks better of it.
John sighs. He does and he doesn't. He can't stand to look at Sherlock, but the thought of him disappearing again fills him with dread. "You know, if we hadn't been... before…if you hadn't given me so much happiness, shown me how good life could be together, if we had stayed just flatmates, just friends, I could have forgiven you."
“I’m not the one mixed up in anything. It’s better if you don’t know, believe me. I swear I will explain to you at some point, but for now the less I say the better. Now, can you print that whole file for me? I need to be going.”
“Enjoy yourself. I’m tired of standing here. I’m going to go meet some people.”
Sherlock shakes his head and pulls away. “I’m being very selfish now, John. More selfish than I think I have ever been. I thought of how hard it would be to be alone for so long, how you might move on and forget me, find a woman, get married, by the time I got back. I thought if I was gone too long you might not forgive me. And I decided that mattered more to me than your safety. You should hate me for this.”
He had a single email waiting. The address was blocked and there was no subject. He clicked on it.
“You haven’t eaten in days, you barely speak, you won’t take cases, and you drove off my last date so viciously I’ll be surprised if it doesn’t end up in the papers. You grumble when I go out but refuse to acknowledge me when I’m here, other than to silently stalk me through the halls of the flat! You haven’t got a pound to lose, either. If you don’t start taking care of yourself I’m going to have do something about it. Don’t think I’m joking.”
Sherlock in turn puts his mouth to the ugly, intricate scar that mars both the front and back of John’s left shoulder and sets himself to tracing each and every white line of it, starting at the outside and working clockwise towards the centre. It’s as is if he wants to lick the poison out of it, or maybe just learn it by heart. John understands that this is the most tender thing Sherlock can think to do to him, and lets himself be taken by the soft and pleasing sensation of Sherlock’s tongue  wandering over his bare skin.
It’s a moment of surprising vulnerability from her, and for just a second he wavers. She looks as sad and forlorn as he’s felt. He opens his mouth to say something to her, though he doesn’t know what yet, but is cut off by the garish sound of a text received that means Sherlock has followed him and heard every word they’ve just said.
“Stay here tonight?” John asks.
From his restrained agitation it seems he can’t quite believe his luck in capturing Sherlock, likely assuming him to be some kind of spy for their competition, and from the set of his jaw he’s going to get everything out of Sherlock that he can. He’ll kill if he has to, but is not over eager to execute a prisoner. Not a complete imbecile and won’t act rashly unless provoked to it. Good, Sherlock might be able to work with him.
“You see my point then. And since then, he’s opted to live on his own in the city.”
“Pretentious wanker. I mean…this. The relaxing, the not worrying about cases. I’ve seen you take your pistol to the drywall over an afternoon of boredom and shoot up enough cocaine to make an elephant attempt bobsledding after a couple of days without work. It’s fantastic, don’t get me wrong, I definitely encourage this behaviour as much and as often as you like… I’m just surprised you aren’t driving yourself insane yet.”
“Yes, there must be some meaning in it for the murderer. This stinks of a serial killer.”
, Sherlock. If there’s one thing a man should be able to trust, it’s that his friends aren’t attempting to poison his beverages. Or locking him up and running experiments on him when he’s unwittingly high out of his mind.”
“Don’t be lewd. I just had a lot on my mind.”
“Tell me what you’re thinking about.”
John is ruthlessly seeking and destroying all of the knots Sherlock hadn't known were there, and it hurts, but in the best of ways. Sherlock leans into the pain as they dissolve under John's onslaught.
“Are you insane?”
“Hmph. Well, I’ve only come to tell you that there’s a gentleman downstairs who says he has an urgent matter for you. Thank heaven I didn’t bring him straight up! He seems quite worked up… what should I say to him?”
When he's done Victor looks stunned and pale. He makes a little motion like he wants to reach out to Sherlock but aborts it.
John's hand nearly slips and he spins to face her.
“Okay?” Sherlock says incredulously. He reaches out and grabs John, spinning him around. “John, it’s…” He’s grasping for words.
He turns abruptly on his heel, heading for his bedroom.
“Not a one. He’s never lived with anyone before, besides family as a child.”
Sherlock had taken to shadowing him as well. Despite completely ignoring John, he also managed to never be more than a few feet away from him. It was maddening. He paced the upstairs hall every night. All night.
John makes a stuttering intake of breath. "Sherlock..." he rasps. "Move."
“I was testing me, too,” John pointed out. “I didn’t know if I could do this with you. I’m straight, remember?”
It's surprising how exhausting thinking like this is, though. It requires all of his focus to interpret what's going on around him, and most of his energy. Eventually it will become second nature but now it's all consuming, leaving no room for anything else. He's almost relieved when they get on the crowded, standing-room only tube carriage. The press of people is unsettling, but at least he's stationary and so are they, so it's easier to deduce individuals, and almost relaxing after trying to keep himself oriented on the street.
John can tell Sherlock admires this criminal mastermind, whoever it is. “He’s brilliant, John!” Sherlock exclaims more than once. “Framing someone is hardly new, but this is a whole other level. He must be trying to knock out all his enemies two by two.”
When they arrive home, John collapses on the couch. “So. While we’re on to big life changes and both sober, shall we talk about the other thing now?”
“Yes.” John had not gone anywhere without it since Sherlock had died.
“You like watching
“Don’t think I haven’t tried. Unfortunately, some memories are rather stubborn. The last time I was on a dance floor…” he trails off, shaking his head. “It doesn’t matter.”
With an aggrieved sigh Sherlock rolls over and props himself up on his elbow. “Mrs. Hudson can pick up what we need – she always does her shopping on Thursdays. Lestrade can sod off. And if you don’t need to go out, there’s no reason for you to get dressed.”
“Molly?” he asks uncertainly.
“When exactly do you think you’ll be finished being furious at me so we can talk about the case?”
Quickly than a flash Sherlock is on him, has Moriarty's lapels fisted in large hands and his feet nearly off the ground. "Why?" he growls, shaking the smaller man.
He speaks as if this all had happened to someone else, a stranger, his white knuckles gripping the glass the only outward sign of how hard it is to get out. He relays what Hanna had told him as factually as possible and when he's finished Greg sinks back in his chair, pale.
John follows the progress of his hands with his mouth, starting at Sherlock’s bellybutton and kissing downward along the faint trail of dark hair below it, giving each place due attention as it becomes available. At last he reaches the border of a deep and fragrant forest, and he immerses himself in it, pulling the fabric at last over the swollenness of Sherlock’s cock and off him completely.
John feels that pit of discomfort forming in his gut again. “What do you need to know?”
John draws his husband to him, encircling Sherlock’s waist with his arms and feeling the still-lithe body quiver ever so slightly, even now, from the memory. “Shh, I know. Me too. But that was a long time ago and we’ve had so many good years since then.”
John’s stomach drops and his breathing quickens as Sherlock leans over him and puts his mouth to John’s ear and growls in his most predatory voice, “You’re mine John Watson. Don’t forget it. You’re mine and I’m going to have you right now.”
The continued silence from John is frustratingly eloquent and Sherlock turns his attention to his present situation with difficulty. Getting out of the city will be easy enough, but as for what happens after that he’s mildly surprised to realize that he has no idea. And there's something he has to deal with first.
“John…” he starts, quietly.
“Oh yes, definitely poison,” she says, pulling the sheet off the body. “Too bad, she was so pretty.”
Moran’s expression had not changed, but rather stayed frozen in a mask of genial interest, with hate slowly crystalising behind his brown eyes. “Go on,” he said dangerously.
“It means accepting that I care about you at least as much as you do me, that it hurts me to see you hurt. And that your death would be the end of me, too. It means valuing your safety as much you value mine, not doing things that purposely harm your body or your mind if there is another way. It means not keeping important things to yourself until they end up hurting us both. It means weighing more than just odds when you weigh the risks of something.”
“No, Sherlock, not now,” John manages with difficulty. “People will hear!”
"So, what you're saying is getting physical with someone you
“A drug-induced coma is not the same as a good night’s sleep!”
John agrees that they should definitely retest everything after this new development but points out a flaw in his plan.
“Great. Maybe you can work on that while I’m away. In Dublin. For
John takes a moment to compose himself, then kneels beside his friend, putting a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock will not look at him. “I can’t,” he says. “I’m sorry, but this…this is wrong.” He permits himself the momentary indulgence of stroking Sherlock’s curls, now slicked to his head with sweat. “Please, just let me help you now. Please, Sherlock.” He is almost begging but he doesn’t care.
“Hmm?”
Even the revelation of Sherlock’s slightly obscene personalised text sound isn’t enough to ruin his growing good humour. In the light of day it all just seems like a juvenile joke, a pitiful grab for attention from an inconsequential person.
In the meantime, however, Sherlock seems perfectly happy to engage in old-fashioned cuddling, even pressing himself into John’s side and throwing an arm carelessly across his chest. “
“But… You’re alive, John…” Sherlock informs him, struggling. “You survived, clearly…”
The same pattern continued for the next three days. Moran would have Sherlock brought to him. They would talk, Moran trying to act like a reasonable, magnanimous criminal mastermind at the start. Sherlock would enrage him by reading him like a book, reciting everything shameful and hidden fact that he could deduce about the other man – from childhood fears to sexual preferences – and Moran would drop the pretense and try to extract the information from Sherlock by force.
“Remember when we danced together?”
John squints at the plastic-wrapped contents. “Paper. It just looks like paper. Some kind of newsprint, maybe?”
"I can’t do this any more,” he says, his voice quavering a bit.
“A legal matter,” John repeats, keeping his voice neutral.
The doctor frowned and looked at John for confirmation. “Fine by me,” he managed.
John sighs tiredly. “Yes, it did.”
“It was stupid, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was trying to... I don't know. It came out all wrong.”
John is in the room, typing on his laptop, and is probably distracted enough that Sherlock can risk moving. He gets up slowly and, being careful to limp a little, makes his way through what he hopes is the obstacle-free path to the bathroom. He reaches it without incident and splashes some cold water on his face. Now he has a dilemma.
John makes his way back to Corvin Castle the same way he came, brushing dully past Victor's concerned inquiries as he goes straight to his room. He sinks into a restless sleep of jumbled, half-formed nightmares. The next morning, unable to avoid it, he recounts what he's learned to Victor in as little detail as possible.
Either way, while John enjoys Victor’s company it is a relief not to be expected to uphold the normal duties of a guest or carry on extended conversation most of the time. He finds that, even if his investigation leads nowhere, he’s glad that he came. Still, after three days of idleness he’s more than ready when Victor finds him in the library to tell him he’s tracked down the disposition records of Friesland Petrol’s fleet.
Sherlock shows John the photographs from the night before. “Any idea what made those?” The victim is a woman, middle aged, with nothing peculiar about her. “She was found in a warehouse in Barbican, hanging upside down by her feet, but she was clearly strangled with some force.”
“No.” John is firm. “I understand why you have to focus now. I can accept it. But in the long run I think you need this and I think you want this, and if I’m wrong then look in my eyes and tell me, tell me you never want to be with me again and I will shut up and never say another word about it. I will be your friend and I will work your cases and I will bail you out of jail, but I will never try to kiss you or seduce you or convince you that we should be more than that. But only if you tell me that you really, truly, don’t want this ever again.”
It takes a few seconds but he eventually notices John is no longer following him or calling to him. He spins on his heel and stalks back towards him.
Unsurprisingly, she’s come around the back of the lorry to look for her companion. When she doesn’t see him, she doesn’t call out or climb in to investigate. She looks around alertly and then reaches for her phone. Before she can dial, John uses the split second of inattention to leap from his hiding spot the lorry and tackle her. She goes down hard, struggling against him with fairly impressive force, but he’s got her arms behind her back and a hand clapped over her mouth.
John shook his head. “I really can’t, Greg.”
“Why… why would you think that?” Sherlock manages in a voice that approaches, but doesn’t quite reach, normal.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, knowing anything he says would make his distress more obvious.
“I wanted you, John. I wanted you so badly it wasn’t enough to be in control, I wanted to be out of control, I wanted to have you in every way it was possible to have a person, and for you to have me.” Sherlock’s eyes were shining, as if he desperately wanted John to understand something but couldn’t quite say what he meant.
“Well, yes, obviously, but why up here?”
HANG ON PHONE John taps into his hand and fishes his mobile out of his pocket. Sherlock can’t make out what he's saying but he turns animated and his brightness increases and changes colours, going from yellow to red to a low burnt orange.
He is far from fine but he’ll be damned if he’s going to let Sherlock continue after that maniac alone. He manages to scramble to his feet and retrieve his gun, forcing himself to take slow, normal steps and using all his willpower to keep the pain at bay.
On his way out he dares to ask to Sherlock about the song, about what he’s thinking, about anything at all. Sherlock shows the first flash of life he’s had in days, and of course it’s about her. He’s still trying to work out how to get into that damnable phone of hers. As it if still matters. As if it’s just a case and not a way to digitally resurrect her on some level.
John appears to accept that. “Anything else? Anything biological or chemical either of us has been exposed to? I mean, you did point out you have enemies… could this be intentional…?”
And then two nights ago he had got the message from his brother that Moriarty was being released. He had not told John. He knew it was only a matter of time before Moriarty came after him, and when he did at least one of them would not come out of the situation alive. He could only hope to ensure that Moriarty was the one who didn’t, but realised it might well require his own life to do so. The thought of his own death had never frightened him – it was a curiosity, more than anything. But now he found himself strangely fearful of what was to come. There were so many ways he could lose, now.
“How was the crime scene?” John asks when he hears the door, a bit stiffly as he is still stinging from Sherlock’s brusque refusal of his company to it.
The words are a slap and, Sherlock distantly realises, a deserved one.
“A bad one – he was dishonorably discharged for war crimes, including grave robbing and shooting civilian children. Hmm, somehow he escaped any prison sentence for that little piece of work. Daddy must have sorted it for him. Nothing else on him for awhile, then he reappears in Africa a few years later as a safari guide and big game hunter.  Got a bit of a reputation there for trouble with the natives, rumors about suspicious deaths among his men and hunting on private land. Busted in Botswana for poaching and smuggling of endangered species – manages to weasel out of incarceration yet again, but loses most of his money to fines and lawsuits and makes a hasty exit from the whole continent.”
“It’s okay,” he whispers. “It’s okay. You’ll get him and everything will be fine. We won’t let him take this away from us. Not for good.”
Sherlock scowls at John and sighs, but finally says. “Apologies, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Well, she’s not dead, is she?” John retorts, sharper than he means to. He sighs, and sits up, taking Sherlock’s hand. “Sorry. I just feel foolish now. I’m not angry, not really. I’m glad she didn’t die, she didn’t deserve that ending. I just want to understand. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
As they chase down the lead, sneak into the Tube, and nearly blow up themselves and Parliament, all he can think about it how completely and totally right everything feels again. Even when Sherlock pulls the second worst prank in history on him, convincing him they're both about to die in an explosion just so he'll spill his guts and say Sherlock is forgiven, John doesn't even have it in him to be really angry.
“That’s entirely different,” Sherlock cuts in smoothly. “The physical act enhances the existing bond of affection. But you of all people know that isn’t always, or even often, the case. Don’t change the subject.”
This time John smiles into his friend’s chest. “Nothing quite so dramatic. I left  my life in an Italian restaurant to run after a madman who thought he was a detective.”
did! Christ, you're so bloody arrogant, you think things will be exactly how you want just because you're a genius, and you've figured it all out. You decided for both of us, you didn’t give me a choice. That’s not how you act when you care about someone, you don’t just decide the entire course of their life based on what you want! I would have been
“I take it my point has been made. The data stick is a gift from John Watson. He has no idea of course,” Mycroft forestalls Sherlock’s rush of questions. “He’s picked up some bad habits from you, went a bit rogue and got luckier with intel than I dare say he knows. It came to me circuitously and I believe it will be of great interest to you.”
“This phone was in my house and I didn’t put it there, and I don’t think any of my friends did either, so yes I am very worried about it!” It wasn’t like Molly to be so firm, she must be quite upset. “It was him, wasn’t? Jim? Moriarty? He did this. What does it mean?”
“All right,” Sherlock said peevishly, grabbing it from his hand and tossing it away. “What is it?”
“Everything I know, not everything I suspect. All things in their time. But one thing is for sure, whoever is doing this is intimately familiar with the Society for Ginger Advancement and desperately wants Bryant – and us – to think they’re the ones responsible. Two levels of set-ups. Brilliant.”
Two shots from the other man answered him and he swerved and drew his own weapon in response. The other man had the advantage of knowing the city, but John could see immediately he wasn’t used to chases on foot. He was slowing. John silently blessed Sherlock for keeping him in shape on that count.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything and appears basically frozen to the spot.
Sherlock laughed, a genuine laugh this time. “So you’re jealous! That is a petty emotion. Kind of…common.” He took a step toward Moriarty.
“Not bad, Mr. Holmes. You are as good as they say. Now, what to do with you? I’m not to kill you, which is fine by me. So much work to cover that sort of thing up. You’re going to have to come with me though. There are people who want to meet you.”
“Sherlock,” John puts a hand uncertainly on his friend’s shoulder. “There’s something you aren’t telling me. Something’s going to happen, isn’t it?”
“Do you mean me?”
Sherlock finally turns around and spies John at the top of the stair.
He glances up at John and the doctor’s eyes are closed, lips parted, in complete surrender to Sherlock but not passive, still moving into him, hips undulating and stomach tightened. Sherlock licks around his root, applying firm but gentle pressure with his lips and feels John begin to pulse beneath him, stiffening even more, his breathing jagged and fast now. Sherlock takes more of John in, wanting to consume him, ready to feel John come inside of him, to taste his release and feel it roll down his throat, but suddenly John stops, pulls himself back from the very edge and slips out of him, pulling Sherlock back up to his face.
John’s heart was pounding. It was working, but this was the critical point. It would be far too easy to give himself away now, and while Mr. Božić was old, John knew another solider when he saw one, and he was quite fit for his age. “Who gave you those orders?”
Sherlock manages to tear his eyes away from John’s bared torso. “Listening,” he says, less than convincingly.
Both men’s heads snap instantly in the direction of Sherlock’s mobile on the bedside table, then back to each other where they find themselves frozen in a suddenly awkward tableau.
When they reach the street, the taller man leans down and purrs in John’s ear, “After we wrap this up, I plan to finish what I started.” John manages to keep his knees from going weak, but it’s a close thing.
real, it reverberates through him, a note coursing along a too-tight violin string, growing stronger and purer as it goes and at last settling in the pit of his stomach and sending shockwaves out into his extremities.
John was pleased at how well this approach worked. Over the next few days he simply acted as if they were, and had been for sometime, in a mutually acknowledged relationship, albeit a very chaste one. As if it was the most natural thing in the world that he would touch Sherlock lightly as he went past, run his fingers through his hair, kiss him briefly on the lips when he went off to work a shift. As if they had always thrown their laundry in together, held hands while watching telly, or argued over the remote (previously, John had always let Sherlock have it if he wanted, but that was stopping right now).
She looks him over appraisingly. He knows that look. It's the "you don't seem like much but you have guts" look.
“That’s where you’re wrong – I care for no one, but I’m
He stops himself, looking shocked at whatever was on its way out of his mouth. But Sherlock can read it in his stance.
“What is it? German? It’s not Bulgarian.”
“So what do I do?” Bryant asks, recalling both their attentions suddenly. “Can I go to the police now? Or maybe my bosses?”
“I know.”
John laughs bitterly. “Because she’s all you can think about. Because she died and you took it harder than I’ve ever seen you take anything, and now she’s alive and you’re basking in it.”
Mycroft got him on his way to work, which means he doesn’t want Sherlock to know he is meeting with John. That’s never a good sign. In addition, instead of having John brought to his London office, he’s had the driver take him to a country house quite a few miles away. John briefly wonders if he’s about to be murdered.
John stops himself from laughing and says solemnly. “Definitely.”
John slaps a finger across his mouth. “I just meant that we’d better get started.”
“I should go tune my violin for the dance,” Sherlock says, not sure how to end a baffling conversation like this.
“I don’t--” Sherlock begins but Victor is already walking away.
She looks mildly surprised. "I thought you were a crime fighter, Doctor. I thought you solved the cases and brought the bad guys in to face judgement."
he was better than him. That was how he could be beaten.
Victor accepts this without further comment and Sherlock changes the subject, overloaded on emotional introspection for the time being.
“It seems that my brother… that he was not so dead as he seemed after his fall off of the roof of St. Bart’s.” Mycroft said the words hurriedly, almost wincing.
“I never do.” John swore there was a hint of a smile on Sherlock’s face, but it faded quickly. They drank the tea without milk and without speaking, and sat motionless for minutes after they finished, too tired to go to bed. Finally John roused himself to go upstairs. Sherlock seemed lost in his own thoughts, but there was nothing unusual about that. John patted Sherlock’s shoulder stoutly on his way past.
John decides Sherlock is suffering enough for one evening. “All right, but we are talking about this later.”
But the rain is coming down harder now, and the puddle that was the last of his friend is all but gone. Slowly, the cold water on his face brings him back to his senses, enough to think.
After Sherlock had eaten and taken the pills offered, John felt like he could go out. He still didn’t like to leave with Sherlock in this state, but he needed a break. Mrs. Hudson was home, and he’d scoured the flat for alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs, although he’d left a couple nicotine patches in easy-to-find locations. Anything that would calm Sherlock down at this point, he thought. He headed to Sarah’s. He had nowhere else to go.
“I’m here, aren’t I?” Sherlock says testily.
“I see,” Sherlock says quietly, at last, and John can tell from the tightening of fingers on his shoulder, almost painful, that Sherlock does. At least as much as anyone can.
"What are they?"
Lestrade winces but is otherwise stoic as he motions John into his office. He sits behind the desk and opens his mouth as if he’s going to try again, but then thinks better of it. He clears his throat and gets to business.
There are some things John Watson doesn’t love. He hates the way Sherlock can, in less than a minute, go from sweetly affectionate to using everything he’s learned about John, even the most intimate knowledge, to eviscerate him verbally. He hates the way Sherlock expects, demands, instant forgiveness for even the most cutting cruelty, or sometimes doesn’t even realise he needs any at all. And he really hates the way Sherlock can disappear for hours or days without notice, making him ache with worry that his friend has discovered a new and interesting way to get himself killed.
"How exactly do you expect me to distract her?" John demands.
Sherlock makes a frustrated sound and pushes up against John, but John takes his shoulders and presses him back down to the sofa, hard enough to leave a mark, refusing to give him any satisfaction until he listens.
Feeling John's readiness, he withdraws his fingers, steadying himself on the ground, and pushes into John. He sinks in slowly, deeply, John's body welcoming him. John's legs tighten behind his neck, shifting and letting him in that tiny bit more, fitting to him perfectly. Sherlock stills, relishing the moment of intimacy, of wholeness.
“John?”
“Lay off,” John snaps. “I’m just saying, she’s dangerous and she knows me. I’d like to have some idea of when to expect her to try to kill me.”
John's breath catches in a combination of relief and shock. He swallows and Sherlock can hear him open his mouth with what are surely a dozen questions and exclamations, but he bites his tongue.
A pause. “No.”
“I’m fine John, everything is fine,” Sherlock responds hazily, completely blissed out.
“Hmm? Oh, just something I’ve been working on. Now, are you talking or are you leaving?”
He waited for the incoming dart with equanimity and was not disappointed.
Mary laughs. "If there's one thing I know about John Watson it's that, whether he wants to admit to it or not, he needs danger. He can't live without it, and in its absence he will either find it or make it. I'd prefer he do so in the company of someone smart enough to get him out of it."
He doesn’t respond, but blinks in confusion.
Sherlock’s eyes blow wide and he opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. John gives him the closest thing to a smile he’s seen since he returned and shakes his head, craning his neck up so he can take Sherlock’s mouth again, saving him the words.
sorry! John, dear, I think we’d better go, I’ve had a bit of an accident.”
He closes his eyes and tries to let his brain disassociate from the moment, to scan over all the information without actively thinking as Sherlock had tried to teach him to do.
“Keeping an eye on them and tending to the captives we rescued. Four warehouse workers, a vice president, and the CEO. I rather think he’s about to get a promotion. He held up surprisingly well, considering.”
The Detective Inspector sighs heavily. “You better be right about this.”
“Because that’s what normal people have!” John yells, exasperated. “Christ, you’re selfish.”
Sherlock doesn’t bother to protest, letting John lead him to the kerb as he attempts to calm his heart, and wipe the phlegm and saliva off his skin. When they get home he goes straight into the shower, hoping to wash away the unpleasant sensation as well as the terror that had been clutching at him in the street.
She smiled enigmatically. “I figure you need someone to take care of you once in a while.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together and nodded reluctantly, still clearly put out but no longer acting in that stiff, cruel, protective manner he had when he was humiliated.
“Well, I’m the only one who can know that,” Sherlock says, his voice low and hoarse now, as if he can barely summon the effort to speak. “So you will just have to believe me. It’s over. Forget it.”
In the taxi, Sherlock turns his head to the window and scans his eyes back and forth, unseeing. John assumes he is thinking of how now to trap their aerially gifted larcenist and lets him be. When they arrive home, John helps him up the stairs and to his chair. He examines Sherlock and pronounces it just a mild sprain, based mostly on Sherlock's faked reactions to his manipulations. He wraps it efficiently and orders him to keep it up with an ice pack on it for the rest of the day.
“It was really very elegant. He set up a series of orders, meant to last well beyond his own death, ensuring that unless Sherlock Holmes confessed to fakery and died by his own hand, you would die instead. Well, not just you – your landlady and police friend too – but let’s be honest. Who else would have mattered enough?”
John throws on his dressing gown and heads for the shower, expecting to see Sherlock perched on some piece of furniture, deep in thought. But the rest of the flat is dark and quiet. He calls Sherlock’s name out of habit, but can tell from the stillness the man is gone. He grabs his mobile.
“Countess? Well, might have done, you never know.” Sherlock gives him a look that says that he most certainly does know, and John ignores him. “And why do you suddenly look so pleased with yourself?”
"You die."
phone which has enough proof on it to clear your name entirely! I say we drop one with Europol, one with Lestrade, and go back to Baker Street and do nothing but sleep and watch telly for a week!”
Just then the knife slips in Sherlock’s hands, slicing a long, shallow cut from his index finger to his wrist.
John sighed. “Me neither,” he admitted, sinking down on the sofa.
Lestrade glowers at him furiously for a moment, then snatches the data stick from Sherlock’s hand. “Go on with you, then,” he snaps. “Give your statements and then get out of here.”
“You tried to hide it from me. You didn’t want me to know. Something is about to happen, isn’t it? Something really bad, something with Moriarty. That’s why you’re doing this. Because of him, because of last time when he—” John breaks off, unable to say it, to bring back to life that horrible night at the pool where they nearly lost each other.
“Call Lestrade. Hopefully the police can find the child before the killer does, because once he has her he could take her anywhere. There’s no pattern to the location of where the bodies are found. Why is there no pattern? A mind like this needs patterns, order, rhythms!”
“Oh. That…thing. Actually, I’d really rather not. I still consider myself married to my work. I don’t want more than that.”
She seethes quietly and with grace.
"Yes, I think so," Sherlock agrees. "Having everyone together will be pleasant."
“Don’t ever do that again,” John says.
“Why?”
to choose to love them, even if you hate them in the moment. The decision and the feeling can be the same. That was a conversation for another day, though.
John tosses a coin all the way to the front of the compartment and holds his breath. Luck is with him, and with a grunt the guard heaves himself up and inside.
"The mercury," Sherlock says slowly, the word feeling alien and thick on his tongue. "It's in the adjuvant but not the Hound drug. It reacts with the... the... things.. organophosphates... in the drug and precipitates out to create a... coating. What's it called? Conductive film, a build-up on the myelin sheaths that impairs or disables their ability to function. It makes the effect of the drug unpredictable... and lasting. Everything goes..."
I’M SO SORRY. SO SORRY. WE’LL FIX THIS. I PROMISE.
“Given his behaviour lately, I’m surprised he’s even noticed.”
It is a brief, minuscule lifting of the burden to have someone to share this with. John has been carrying not just his own grief at losing Sherlock, losing everything he'd built his life around, but also the grief of a city that does not yet know what it’s lost. All of London is mocking and denigrating Sherlock Holmes, and John carries that pain too, and the pain that will be when they discover they need him and find he’s gone, destroyed by the city he loved and the people he saved.
“How thoughtful of you to make an effort.”
John feels hope tentatively take root in his chest. “Well, it did seem that way. And there is something between you. You can’t deny it. Maybe if you could tell me…”
“That’s rough, mate. Didja really not ask him in advance?”
Sherlock thinks for a moment that he needn’t go through with it – with Moriarty gone and Mycroft’s men capturing the assassins as they speak surely he and his brother are clever enough to extricate him and John from what remains of the trap. It was worth the risk, surely. He can’t bear the ache in John’s voice as it is.
“Got it,” he tells John abruptly. He can imagine the faintly puzzled look John must be giving him now, unaware of how clearly Sherlock can visualize the string of chemicals he’s just read off.
John pushes him away playfully. “Well, if you’re so eager then better get on your knees, Mr. Holmes.”
," he shouts, trying to disentangle himself from the bedding.
John takes Sherlock’s scarred and bony hands and puts them to his lips, knowing instantly where the other man has gone, remembering those painful years when they had hurt each other so deeply in turn. “So was mine.”
”. The first part was an address, he had picked up that much. The last word looked familiar, but he couldn’t place it. He flipped open his laptop and typed it into Google Translate. “Top floor”, of course! He had seen the same word on his room key when he checked in.
John clears his throat. “Sherlock…”
“It matters to me,” John tells him quietly. “What happened?”
Sherlock moves on to John’s face. “Eyes. Blue. Dark blue, often mistaken for brown but in reality closer to slate. Though they change colour in the light and with your mood. How can eyes change colour? Skin, clear but weathered.” He runs fingers over John’s face, lightly caressing all his features. “Fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. Lips…soft… full…” He traces John’s jaw line. “Dimples, slight, only when you smile very widely. Chin, small but strong. Ears stick out…” he licks along the edge of both. “Beard, two days growth, coarse like thick grained sandpaper, slightly reddish…” He rubs his own smooth cheek against John’s experimentally.
“Means?” Sherlock snorts. “It doesn’t
“Did you get dinner?” Sherlock’s question reaches John’s ears before he’s fully gotten inside the door.
“You came up here for a reason other to complain about my absence?” John hints.
“Sherlock,” he says urgently to his friend.
he wanted them to be a family, hadn’t he?
“Aside from your recreational use of street drugs? No. I was keeping an eye on your pulse. You know, to make sure you didn’t die. As for the trousers, you would know better than me. You were wearing them when I got home.”
He’s trying to protect Sherlock, John can see.  Despite Sherlock’s frequent aspersions on the DI’s intelligence, he’s a smart man and moreover he knows Sherlock too well, knows it wasn't a suicide. John spreads his hands helplessly.
He runs to Sherlock, thinking if he can get there fast enough it won’t be true. A bicyclist comes out of nowhere, knocking him down with enough force to slam his head on the pavement and make him lose consciousness, just for a second. It doesn’t matter. He scrambles to his feet, stumbling almost blindly through the crowd that has inexplicably materialised around Sherlock and pushes through. “Let me through. He’s my friend,” he cries, as if the assertion could bring him back.
"Dropped off? Why?"
“Of course not, just…it’s who I am…”
Sherlock’s voice is plaintive in a way John rarely hears and, not without trepidation, John melts. He nods and he can feel the relief pouring off Sherlock as he gathers John in his arms, nuzzling his face into John’s hair. “Mine,” Sherlock whispers almost uncertainly.
texts, once again interjecting herself into their lives at the worst possible moment. It wouldn’t be so bad if she hadn’t apparently broken into their flat and left a present for Sherlock, if John hadn’t decided to make an issue of it right then, if Sherlock hadn’t completely refused to discuss it with him. But mostly it wouldn’t be so bad if it all didn’t mean that she was dead.
“That one’s redundant. And I believe I warned you at the outset, John. Besides I think I should be congratulated for making a rather large exception for your offspring.”
“Sherlock, I swear to God…” John exclaims angrily, but Sherlock waves dismissively at him after glancing briefly at the message.
“Oh yes, a man smart enough to plot a complicated murder and fake a different height couldn’t remember to clean the mud off his boots beforehand or wear gloves in his victim’s house. Not a chance this clot managed to pull it off.”
John instantly puts a hand on Sherlock's back. "Of course," he says, but in the voice he uses to keep others from noticing that he's afraid.
“Pacing. Helps me think.”
“Sherlock, what happened? Why did you do this?”
“Splitting headache, dry mouth, patchy memory, nausea,” Sherlock says dismissively. “I prefer you to sleep downstairs.”
“Home?” asks John. Hanna is long gone, Sally is using her gentlest manner to collect a statement from a very shaken-up Bryant, and they’ve both told the police everything they know, thrice. It’s nearly dawn and John can hardly remember being so tired.
He gets to his feet, hoping the hospital smock hasn’t revealed too much in the process. He's casual about nudity in general, but here he already feels too exposed, and he tends to modesty in front of Molly, if only for her own sake.
John’s reaction encourages him and he says bravely, “No. No condom. Please? I don’t want something between us.”
“John, I can’t… you know I can’t….” Sherlock breathes at last, with difficultly.
“Not…really, mate. You want to pay me money to not give you drugs? I have to say, that’s a new one on me.”
But now he spends time with Eurus, seeing to her well-being despite her imprisonment, advocating for her even though she can’t or won’t acknowledge him. She does seem to understand he’s there at least. He plays the violin for her and eventually she does respond. It’s the only means they have to communicate and her only comfort. If she can even experience comfort. John is clearly sceptical and a little afraid of this development given what she has put them through, but says nothing, not wanting to discourage this light-years leap forward in Sherlock’s emotional growth.
“I prefer to think of it as directing my thoughts elsewhere. It wasn’t like I had much of a chance to do anything about it had I wanted to. And as I said, I had plenty of other interests that seemed more important than all the mooning about and pawing at each other my peers were doing. There was one time, as a teenager, I wanted briefly to… but it doesn’t matter.”
. Breathtakingly ordinary. Not worthy of someone like you at all.”
John gave him a peculiar look. “Yes, I told you.” He coughed again, and looked embarrassed. “Look, Sherlock…I don’t remember much after I ran off after that suspect, but they told me what…what you did for me. I…I don’t know how to thank you. That was…um…good.”
"I can't read the sheet music."
At last he says slowly. “I don’t want it to be. So what I'm asking you, however unfairly, is if you and I can walk out of this tunnel and be what we were at the beginning. Partners, friends, colleagues. But that's all. If you can be genuinely happy for me and let the past lie. It's the only way. It might be cruel of me to even ask and if it's too much, then we can part ways. But I'd rather have something than nothing, even if it can't be everything. Can you do that for me, Sherlock?"
“Where are we going, if not to Mycroft. This is his car, isn’t it?”
"Sherlock! Of course not."
He takes a step back, opening what might as well be chasm between them.
He feels his own arousal surge as John shifts again.
When they are finished, shuddering sharply only seconds apart despite Sherlock not laying a finger on John to bring him off, Sherlock rolls John on top of him and they lay there, chests together, breathing in sync. Sherlock seems to like having John on him like this, likes to feel the weight and heat and solidness of him to assure himself it’s real.
While not exactly prepared for the tranquiliser dart that hit him in the back of the neck, he could not honestly claim to be surprised by it either.
Sherlock grinned at him, turned up his collar, and was gone. John considered following him, but decided it would be a futile effort. Clearly Sherlock had a mission in mind. What had he shouted upon waking? John had been half asleep, but assumed it must have something to do with Moriarty. He only hoped Sherlock wasn’t going to do anything too foolish.
Then John makes a sound that is halfway between a whimper and a moan into the soft skin of Sherlock’s throat and it is so
“Well, we didn’t hold on to Ms. Mihov long after your case. Powers higher than mine intervened for her release. But we were watching her. Closely. And around the time all the information on Jim Moriarty disappeared, she did too. This file –” he nudges a worn manila folder on his desk toward John. “—is every record we have left of her.”
John leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. Finally he says, “I suppose you’re going to make me say it, aren’t you? All right then. I have no intention of leaving Sherlock’s side unless he decides he wants me to. Happy?”
The next morning he went straight to the address he had looked up on the way to Zagreb. It was in an older part of the city, away from the glittering skyscrapers and fashionable shopping concourses of the
“Fine, fine,” said John. “And the paperwork?”
Sherlock gripped John’s shoulders. “This is the only way. You have to know that. I promise, I will stay in touch, I will let you know if I’m in trouble. I need to know you’re safe, and that there’s someone back home who will come for me, no matter what. You won’t be able to help me if you’re in trouble with me. It won’t be like last time, because I’m alive and you know it.”
“I… I don’t know,” John says, treading on eggshells to not betray his own unsettlement. He finds refuge in the clinical. “These sorts of disorders, synaesthesia, it can be progressive. It shouldn’t be surprising that you’ve developed additional symptoms.”
“I…thought it easiest, for you. I didn’t want you to have to go through that twice. It was for your own good.”
"Are you going to sleep?"
Sherlock's all focus, leaning forward, so ready to absorb every detail of the room and people in it to spin into a serviceable cover that, perhaps predictably, he entirely neglects what's happening the bar area he's just passed through. He has only the barest of prickles at the back of his neck and a small flare of John Watson's indignation behind his corneas to warn him before a field hockey stick connects sharply with his midsection.
“No, I know we’re on the track, if only I could see, I could work it out, I know it!” Sherlock slams his hand down on the bench in frustration. “It must have to do with how I metabolised it.”
They both resume ignoring him.
John gives her a wolfish smile. "Go right ahead. I'm going out."
John glances to see if anyone is watching. He traces a finger affectionately along the line of Sherlock’s lapel, and steps just a little closer to him. “Just don’t get in the middle of any wars or accuse any world leaders of treason, okay?”
“What’s going on?” he demanded again, still not loosening his grip on the Holmes brother.
“Not good, Sherlock!” John exclaims. “Bloody hell.”
"I just came up here to tell you've got a phone call, is all. You really ought to replace your mobile."
“No, it’s not,” John admits. They lock eyes for a long second and then Sherlock pounces, straddling his lap and kissing him forcefully and deeply, like he is trying to possess John with his mouth. John gives as good as he gets, and the kiss lasts at least a full minute – long enough for John to contemplate any number of filthy things he could do to his detective, right here in this chair – before Sherlock breaks it off and jumps to his feet abruptly.
“John, come down here for a moment, would you?” Sherlock calls up the stairs, perhaps a bit louder than necessary.
“I do think you shouldn’t be quite so quick to resort to implications regarding my sexual proclivities, Sherlock, given what I know of you,” Mycroft replies mildly. “But I shall give it a pass under the circumstances. You know where to reach me should you require diversion.”
As he watches, first one fully loaded pallet and then another are wheeled out of the warehouse and into the truck.
Sherlock managed to catch his breath and grinned. “Because, Sebastian – he’s
John’s gut twists with guilt. He’d forgotten, in all the commotion, what he’d said, what Sherlock would have heard him say.
“Exactly. And yet his phone and watch were recent. He can afford new clothes, but he’s not comfortable with getting rid of something that has any wear left in it at all. Poor man’s habit. Last?”
It’s then that John notices Sherlock’s computer is open. A few minutes scan of his internet history gets the most recent address Sherlock looked up, just under an hour ago. It’s just outside town, a large estate in an unfamiliar neighbourhood.
At last he settles in a chair by the fire with a treatise on the synthesis of novel toxins that he’s been meaning to read and forces himself to focus on it. John is gone longer than he anticipates, and he wonders if he’ll even be back that night. The mean time for him to be out after an episode like this is 3.5 hours, and sometimes he’ll spend the night away, but Sherlock doesn’t know of any current lady friends who might take pity on him. If he’s desperate enough to bunk with Stamford, then it’s serious indeed.
The flight to Helsinki was long, but the one from Helsinki to Ivalo was even longer, on a tiny 12-seat plane that was inadequately heated. John put on nearly every item of warm weather gear he owned at once, and huddled in his window seat, faintly nauseous. He was not prone to motion sickness in the slightest, but the stomach churning drops and turns of Scandinavian winter flying were something new to him entirely.
Sherlock nods, his hands still up to ward off the needle.
Sherlock nods curtly, respecting John’s logic, but John can feel him still rolling the information John’s just given him around in his brain, like rocks in a tumbler that won’t stop until all the rough edges are gone, until the ideas are smooth and shiny and fit in his mind perfectly.
John ignores him. "You come back after all this time, giddy, proud of yourself like it was all a great lark. Was it all a game to you? Just one long, convoluted practical joke? Is that what I was?"
That is the closest thing to romance John is likely to get, and he treasures the strangeness of it. And then Sherlock begins to move and all thoughts are seared from John’s head. It’s over far too soon and yet they seem to exist timelessly in those few moments.
John nods. “How are you feeling?”
“John!” Mycroft boomed. “He did it for you! Now will you be quiet for one second and listen to what I have to say?”
He jokes with John again. They take cases. They eat together, drink together, watch telly together – everything as usual. Except. Except there is a space between them now that wasn’t there before. Sherlock has stopped shutting the door to his room, but issues no invitation, initiates no physical contact or affection, and responds coolly to any attempt on John’s part to do so himself. John continues to sleep upstairs and Sherlock doesn’t seek him out.
He's sprawled on his back on the wood floor of the bedroom-cum-lab, and he turns his head painfully to see John beside him, a few feet away. John is face down, unconscious but breathing deeply, pulsing with a soft anaemic glow around his prone form. There is a three inch needle sticking out of the back of his head and an accompanying dried trickle of blood down his neck that makes Sherlock shudder involuntarily and reach behind his head to feel the deep bruise in the same spot..
John shrugged. “Maybe it doesn’t mean anything,” he said, lamely.
“Who murders a 94 year old?” John asks. “And what was she doing in Greenwich?”
“Oh, I see what this is all about.” Sherlock says maliciously. “You just need a shag! Well, you can do that any time. This is more important.”
The fourth time was slow and languid, almost lazy, under the sheets and face to face, and only because despite their exhaustion they simply could not keep their hands off one another. At last they were completely spent, and John could feel the needs of sleep, shower, and food fighting for dominance within him. He knew sleep would win if he didn’t make a move to get up right then. Sherlock was done in too – despite his usually meticulous attention to his person he had made no move to clean up and had instead curled himself around John and was nuzzling the back of his neck sleepily.
John grins, and spears a piece of meat with his fork. “Sex, Sherlock. The meal and the case are both top notch, you have me there, but if either one is better than sex you have definitely been doing it wrong.”
John’s not surprised by this infatuation, but it does trouble him, as does Sherlock’s increasing level of frustration. He’s always moody, particularly when working, but he’s been growing more and more randomly destructive and morose lately, usually a sign of boredom in him. Sherlock’s dangerous when he’s bored, but he can’t possibly be bored now.
“Just the three guards at the door,” Sherlock replies, in a bored tone. “Child’s play. Never saw us coming.”
In the glass, John can see Sherlock’s eyes darting back and forth at an almost inhuman rate, the way they do when he doesn’t understand something about another person, like he’s scanning all available data for a solution.
“My wits are always keen,” Sherlock said. He put his hand suddenly to his forehead and inhaled sharply.
John takes his advice with bad grace, hunkering down in his sodden clothes and trying with every fibre of his being not to vomit.
John guides Sherlock’s hand to the top button of his shirt and Sherlock obediently begins to undo it, sliding it off of John’s shoulders and dragging his fingernails sharply down John’s back as he does so. John closes his eyes and arches against Sherlock’s hands, rubbing himself on Sherlock’s hardness and groaning deeply.
Sherlock had been gone more than eight hours without a word. Nothing from Mycroft either. John was beginning to feel as jumpy as Sherlock often did. He dared not go out in case Sherlock came back, couldn’t sleep in case there was a message or a call, and Sarah…well, he’d best leave that alone, at least for a little while. He had occupied himself with cleaning, reading the Sunday paper, and terrible telly for most of the day but he was running out of distractions.
"I never meant to--" Sherlock starts, but John stops him with a look. "Do you want me go away and never trouble you again, then?"
John tucked them away in his bag carefully. “You promise, not a word to anyone?”
Mycroft had the good grace to look ashamed of himself.
When someone finally entered his cell, Sherlock was sitting perched on the metal platform that was intended to serve as a bunk, his legs drawn up to his chest and his hands steepled under his nose. His eyes were closed.
She spreads her hands in surrender and sits down on the bunk, allowing him to bind her wrists as casually as if he were gifting her with a bracelet. Her hair is shorter than when he’d seen her last, and a dark brown colour. He can detect a faint eastern European accent in her speech now as well.
“Don’t,” John interrupts. “Don’t think about it. Turn off your brain.” It is almost an order and Sherlock is shocked into silence. John takes Sherlock’s hands and places them firmly around his own waist, then reaches up to wrap his around Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock rubs his hands together, half anticipation, half cold. “Now. Do you remember that case a few months back, with the tropical birds and the classical musician?”
“Let’s be
"It's done." Sherlock says, not at all sure that it is. But it had better be because even the memory of the knowledge is fading, he wouldn't know mercury from what's-it-called if they both him in the face. "Now, to test it."
Moriarty smoothed his uniform and followed him. “Your heart lies in two places, just two little
John jumps at his voice. WHAT? DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT!
“Sherlock, are you all right?” John asks when they break apart, running his hand through Sherlock’s black curls.
"You like Mary!"
"One day," John agrees, hollowly.
Sherlock uses one hand to keep John down on the bed (an unnecessary precaution) while tearing at John’s belt and the fastenings of John’s jeans with the other, until he manages to loosen them enough to yank them down over John’s resurging erection. Sherlock kneels behind him and places both hands firmly on his bared arse. John’s heart skips a beat as he feels himself being spread apart and trembles expectantly as Sherlock’s hot breath draws nearer.
“Likewise,” she says. “Now, let’s get this over with.”
“But, I—”
talk,” he said, half joking.
“What? No, not at all. The wounds clearly match the weapon, there are defensive wounds on his hands…”
, John chides.
This got an annoyed scowl out of Sherlock, but at least he finally focused on John, and put the violin down.
“You were right, John!” Victor agrees.  “The company’s a shell. I don’t know what for, but I’m fairly certain it’s not hauling timber to Greenland or any of the other things its charter claims.”
“Thirty-five minutes, he’s getting slow,” Sherlock mutters, annoyed, throwing cash down on the table on their way out.
“Oh, and Sherlock?”
"John," Sherlock says in what he hopes is a calming tone, for both their sakes. "What are you doing?"
A man in his fifties lies dead on the floor, his brains blown against the wall, presumably by the gun that has fallen next to him. A little girl is against the opposite wall, strangled, but with clear hand marks around her throat instead of the now-familiar diamond pattern of the other victims. She is flecked with her killer’s blood.
