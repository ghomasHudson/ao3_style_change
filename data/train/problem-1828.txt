John wasn’t sure if he was going to be able to hold of his impending climax for as long as it might take to get Sherlock settled.
As I stand up from his lap, his eyes flicker down to my groin. I follow his gaze, and see a still present tent in my trousers.
Hope you enjoyed. I apologise to those who like Sally and Phillip, but I needed bullies, and they were there.
“Yes, it’s very- ah! Very good!” Sherlock yelped as John pulled out only to push three fingers inside.
In hindsight, pleasuring himself with a vibrating plug and handcuffing himself to the bed was not a very good idea. The buzzing sensation was spreading through his body, tickling every nerve, his cock hard and leaking between his legs. As he sat there, he thought of john, blond hair slightly damp with sweat, beads of perspiration dotting his forehead, his cotton grey vest sticking to his chest, his camouflage jacket tied round his waist, matching trousers slung low on his hips-
“Oh.” Is all I manage to stammer out, my cheeks flaring a colour I can only imagine matches that of John’s underwear.
He let out a low whine when he felt the tails lightly graze the skin between his shoulder blades. He shivered as John dragged the cat down his back, already so sensitive from the ice cubes, his nerves tingling, his cock throbbing painfully where it stood unattended between his legs.
Sherlock giggled as he pressed his lips to johns. John gripped Sherlock by the waist, pulling the slight teen flush against him. He slipped his tongue past Sherlock’s lips, emitting a small moan from him. He rolled their tongues together, enjoying the unique blend of ginger, mint, and coffee.
Thank you so much for reading... I can’t believe I went on with this for such a Bally long time. Hope you enjoyed!
No, Eurus is not going to be important. I’ll kill her off, or something like that. I just thought it was a good song to have.
John started with slow, shallow thrusts, allowing Sherlock’s body to adjust to his length. Said boy had his palms against the door, nails raking the surface. John gradually picked up the pace.
John turned back, but the mysterious boy had disappeared. He shuddered, and ran off in search of a bus stop.
He managed to pull johns shirt over his head, musing his hair so it was spiked up at all angles. Sherlock licked his lips as he stared up at John. John reconnected their lips, kissing Sherlock fiercely.
“Because I’ve been bad... I deserve to be hurt... bruised... let everyone know that I’m a naughty slut that needs to be put in his place...”
Sherlock was sat on her front lawn supervising Lucy. Supervising may have been a loose term. She was reading a book while Lucy played with a doll. She flinched when she felt a droplet of rain fall on her nose. She turned her face towards the sky. A few more droplets fell. She scooped Lucy up in the blanket, and carried her indoors.
“Oh fu- Agh! Mmmmmnnnnggghh!” Sherlock howled low in his throat as he arched his back, pressing his ass into John’s pelvis.
“Besides, it’s slightly less depressing to sit in a hotel crying over my sorrows than it is to stay here. It is.” Molly quipped when Irene opened her mouth to say otherwise.
Sherlock gasped out a strangled moan as John sucked at her pulse point and leant her backwards on the bed. He pulled his briefs off before leaning in, pressing their lips back together, and trapping her between his arms that were situated either side of her head. He was settled between her legs, leaning on her pubic bone, her skirt hiked all the way up her hips. He moved one hand down her side, then up her thighs. She hummed happily in to his mouth, lifting her pelvis slightly to grind against his.
His request snaps me from my daze, reminding me that I’m just standing there, blinking like a complete twat.
John shuffled forwards then, and dropped his head on to Sherlock’s shoulder. She nuzzled him affectionately, and wrapped her arms around him. John pulled back after a moment, but only to pull Sherlock on to the sofa with him.
I don’t have a chance to knock, Sherlock already opening the door to allow me inside, a look of what can only be trepidation spread across his angular yet juvenile face.
I turn to see Moriarty stood at the end of the row of bookcase. He winks at me. I decide to follow Dr Hooper’s advice, and not engage.
John flipped Sherlock backwards, and quickly pulled Sherlock’s trousers down. His jaw dropped. Just as Sherlock said, there was more. Matching panties with garters and attached stockings.
“Is He you’re boyfriend?” Rosie asked, not unkindly. She would settle for friends, and wouldn’t intervene.
John stayed silent for a moment. Sherlock wondered whether he’d just screwed up his chances of having a somewhat decent lab partner.
Sherlock beamed up at him before John crashed their lips back together. Sherlock’s mouth was warm, and wet, his tongue soft like velvet, and tasting ever so slightly of mint and ginger. Sherlock’s unique taste. John lifted him off the counter, and carried him across the room to Sherlock’s bedroom. Even though it was only a short distance, it still took a lot of coordination and balance, and they ended up falling against the wall in a heap of laughter.
Unfortunately, I feel my legs start to cramp, so I’m forced to take them down from his shoulders, and instead wrap them around his waist.
Sherlock quickened his pace, swirling his tongue, swallowing around the head, lightly grazing  the skin with his teeth.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, and let a breathy ‘yes’ fall from her lips. John joined their lips in a passionate kiss as he brought his hands to the apex of her thigh. He thrust his tongue in to her mouth as he gingerly stroked a finger along her dripping lower lips.
Shit, I’m doing something wrong. Haven’t seen him in days... miss him... people hug when they see someone they’ve been missing.
“I am too. Ok, if you’re sure, then it’s alright with me.” John grinned, leaning in to brush a curl out of Sherlock’s face.
John wanted nothing more than to buck his hips, and ram his cock down Sherlock’s throat as he looked at the blue eyed beauty before him. He’d forced himself to open his eyes, not wanting to miss the sight of Sherlock’s lips around his cock. He never wanted to forget that.
John could tell she was deducing every single one of them as she stood there, her eyes flickering around.
Sherlock pulled her lips in to a crooked grin. John smiled when she pressed a kiss to his temple, and turned his head so she could kiss his lips.
She stared down at the letter before her. She hadn’t even noticed she’d been crying until one of her tears landed on the paper clutched in her hands. She slowly slid out of bed, her legs wobbling under her weight, and walked over to her dresser. She searched around for her writing set, and upon finding what she required, sat down to write to john.
“Wear the purple dress you got From Mrs Hudson for Christmas!” Her mother called down the hall. She put on said dress, and tried to run a comb through her hair. After a battle with her ebony locks, she went downstairs to find Mrs Hudson.
“I really can’t believe he did this... Lestrade interviewed him a little while ago. He can’t believe he did it either.”
Sherlock chuckled and shook his head at the cheesy line. He settled back with his book, and simply enjoyed johns company.
Both boys did as instructed, then sat down next to one another at the table. They ate their food while exchanging standard conversation, with a few odd questions, such as how many minutes do you reckon it would take for an eyeball to explode in a microwave. Mrs Hudson told Sherlock that was not appropriate for the dinner table, which left him sulking for a good few minutes. She later added it wasn’t appropriate to ask anyone no matter their location. John didn’t help by answering, guessing around 2 minutes. Sherlock then presented his findings, as it turned out the question was not hypothetical. Sherlock kept squirming in his chair, which meant his knees kept knocking against the table, making the plates jump. John realised that Sherlock was definitely unintentionally funny, but it made him laugh regardless. John went home later his mind and heart both consumed by the curly haired boy.
“I’m so fucking stupid. So fucking... stupid... I... I can’t... I’m... I just... if I hadn’t... what if...”
Sherlock’s body slumped forwards, his dark locks hanging over his eyes as he tried to steady his breath.
I march the few steps between us, and slam him up against the wall. He lets out a small gasp against my lips, but quickly reciprocates the kiss.
Sherlock clenched around Johns stiff shaft, milking him of his release as he finished himself, semen spilling down his thighs. John dropped his head to rest between Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he came down from his high.
“I just need to get something from the kitchen. I want you to start stretching yourself, but don’t you dare cum.”
He was warm and hard, throbbing and pulsing. He switched between staring up at the ceiling and squeezing his eyes shut as she began to move her wrist.
The train pulled in to the station right on time, much to Sherlock’s disappointment. She wasn’t ready to say goodbye to him. Not again. She could only hope he wouldn’t try and throw himself on to the tracks like she did. She brushed off the thought and simply tightened her grip on her suitcase.
“Yes please.” She nodded with a smile, shuffling about in her chair to get more comfortable, an impossible task she realised as she sat with her legs sprawled.
Another finger, and Sherlock was thrashing about, moaning John’s name. One more, and he was on the verge of tears, desperate for release. John was rock hard, his cock throbbing between his legs.
He seems intrigued as he crosses his legs in a manner that makes him resemble a small child, eager to learn.
Both sisters turned to look at John. His gaze was fixed on the small baby who was kicking and screaming in her pram.
“You are gonna have to do something about that skirt.” John murmured, looking down at the garment, white streaks staining it.
Throughout the lecture, a few people stared at Sherlock, but the only comments were positive ones. Sherlock practically skipped back to the flat, dragging John along with him.
“Well, you said to ask questions, swap stories, and find out what we have in common. I have microwaved a banana, and I wanted to see if you had too. All three in one go.” He explains proudly.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand before pulling away, and walking down to the stairs. He waved, and blew Sherlock a kiss before jogging down them.
Normally, this was an announcement that sparked joy, but this time it was one that only brought dread.
Sherlock furrowed his brows as he watched John dig around in his bedside table. When he sat back up, he was holding a small, hot pink object. It only took Sherlock a moment to realise what the object was. A plug.
“Sherlock!” John howled as fire pooled in his abdomen, and he dissolved in pleasure, shooting his load.
There’s a few other people dotted about the room attending to various tasks, watching television, having a chat.
John explained all of this without eye contact, luckily for Sherlock, as the tears forming in her eyes went unseen.
Mycroft worried her lip between her teeth. It was what they had all suspected, and hearing the doctor say it only confirmed it. Footsteps running up at the stairs drew Mycroft’s attention. Mrs Holmes and Mrs Watson practically fell through the door. The sudden outburst made Sherlock jump, her eyes falling on the pair.
“13 months. Well, 11 now. Maybe less with good behaviour, but I think we can both agree that isn’t going to happen.”
I’m always pleased to get out of the dorms and go to work, but today I practically sprint in to the garden.
She gave an exasperated sigh when the teen entered the kitchen by jumping on to the coffee table. She gave them both a cup of tea, but Sherlock was too busy circling articles in another newspaper which he must have found in the other room, and kept his head bent in concentration.
Sherlock blinked his cat eyes a few times, trying desperately not to let the iridescent beads of moisture fall from them, despite how keen they were to escape.
The next day, everyone was hung over. They could only be great full they had no classes. Sherlock was curled up under a sheet, clad in one of John’s jumpers, coffee in one hand, bottle of water and a paracetamol in the other.
My eyes drift down his torso, following the trail of hair that starts at his navel and disappears under his waistband.
I feel her watching me for a moment before she lets out a sigh and jumps down from the table she was perched on.
“Darling, of course. You love who you love. I don’t care who it is, as long as they’re good for you, and they make you happy.”
“Why do you care? I contradict you all the time, I make you look like a complete idiot in front of everyone else, and I’m just a...”
“Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?” Mrs Holmes asked as she sat on the sofa end closest to Sherlock.
She then recalled the details of her biscuit burning experiment. As expected John had some interesting opinions, and laughed at the retelling of the doily burning incident.
“I assume Sherlock has informed you of the rules. No male visitors, I’m afraid. There will be plenty of opportunity for me to spend time with her then. You take her dear.”
On a chemical level, I defiantly felt a raise of endorphins, and something else raise in the biological department...
Sherlock threw his head back as a strangled moan escaped him, exposing his pale throat. John pressed his lips to the soft skin, emitting whines of pleasure from Sherlock, making him thrash and buck. John gently bit down, hard enough to hurt, but not enough to do any damage.
Honestly, I am amazed that no one has picked up on this; I suppose it just shows you how self absorbed people are.
John felt his already hard cock getting harder as his brain conjured up images of the gorgeous brunette to go along with the erotic noises he was providing. John had a very real idea of what the events looked like, and had no problem coming up with his own fantasies.
No one warns you what can happen if you’ve never given in to certain impulses before, then all of a sudden...
Sherlock walked down the hall, and knocked on Mycroft’s door. The older teenager opened the door, an irritated expression on his face.
You don’t think about it when you actually kiss someone, because all you can think about is how wonderful the other person’s lips feel on yours.
“Brother mine, to what do I owe this pleasant call?” Mycroft’s mellifluous voice, licks over the phone, dripping with sarcasm.
He grinned to himself as he got up to fetch them. Sherlock felt the mattress shift, and heard John moving away. He knew he hadn’t left the room, as Sherlock had made it clear he didn’t want John to leave the room when he was bound. He felt the mattress dip under johns weight a few seconds later.
John smiled from behind Harriet before turning his attention to Sherlock who was sat between her mother’s legs on the floor. He waved at her, which made Sherlock grin, and hide her face behind her mothers leg. Lillie came back into the room a few minutes later with a tray with five plates, and three cups of tea. After they’d finished their tea, Anne and Sherlock said their goodbyes, and went home, where Sherlock played her promised game of chess which Mrs Hudson.
“Well, you’re getting out soon... now see... I simply cannot have that. What am I supposed to do without my... plaything?”
Sherlock eventually managed to get his body to follow his head, turning completely in Johns arms, and capturing his face in his hands. When their lips connected, it was hot, and passionate. John could feel that Sherlock was also getting turned on, his erection pressing in to his hip. They were flushed together, breathing each other’s air when they pulled away from the kiss. John was pressed up against the wall, holding Sherlock to him by his hips.
Sherlock felt truly safe, and loved. He trusted John, he trusted he wouldn’t hurt him, and he trusted himself not to screw this up.
So many nights I’ve had to use my disappointment of a hand with a squirt of lotion, comparing it to Sherlock’s warm depths.
The blanket I had placed around him is twisted between his legs, which kick about, desperate to kick off something I’m sure is more dangerous than the blanket. His head rolls about as his eyes twitch, and small sobs wrack his body.
I feel my previously dormant cock start to stir between my legs, awoken by not only that thought, but also the sensuous feeling of johns lips on my skin.
He leant in and reconnected their lips before she could answer. He ran his fingers down her abdomen, and began to trace patterns on her pubic bone.
“There’s some in the bathroom. Mrs Hudson always has some on hand in case I get sunburnt. It happens more often than I’d like to admit.”
Sherlock smiled to himself. When they got to Sherlock's house, he gave John the keys, his hand eye coordination a little impaired.
John felt himself pulsing in his boxers at Sherlock’s words, beads of moisture collecting at the tip.
“God... John...” Sherlock gasped, reaching down to curl Johns soft hair in to his hands. John moved back up Sherlock’s body, and brushed their lips together.
It seems like he needed to hear it too as he pauses, and stares at me in astonishment before pressing our foreheads together.
Johns cock was hot, and pulsing inside Sherlock’s mouth, pre cum tricking on to his tongue in a steady stream.
A doctor appeared down the corridor, a clipboard in hand, marching towards them. Late thirties, young children, ex smoker.
Merry Christmas. I shan’t say happy new year, as I believe it shall be anything but. I will however, wish you a better new year.
Hearing him say this lights some sort of fire within me, a fire that grows to an intense, burning inferno that powers me to continue. I jerk my wrist faster and faster till it’s aching, twinging, but all of that is overlooked by the most wondrous, salacious noises that fall from John’s lips.
“Oh, Good. You know, you’re welcome to stay as long as you’d like, John. You can maybe nip home for some clothes after school.”
"Jillian was a good teacher according to the papers, in fact she was an excellent teacher, highly sort after. She was meant to be transferring. In a video clip on the news, she is sat sporting a very vivid shade of orange lipstick.”
“Of course. I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable.” John said with a squeeze to Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock was sat in the courtyard waiting for John. John wasn’t exactly the most punctual person on Earth, but he wasn’t very later either. Sherlock felt his heart beat increase upon spotting the blond a few yards away.
Comment if you’d like a one shot of mycroft and this ‘girl’, because obviously I should have four stories on the go 😆.
That was the final straw. His eyes rolled in to the back of his head, all his muscles tensing as he reached his orgasm.
“Light?” John asked as he presented Sherlock with a cat-of-nine-tails. The ‘cat’ was a multi tailed whip that John used to both tease and torture Sherlock.
Sherlock was pleased with this reaction, and took it as his cue to continue. He opened his mouth, and enveloped his lips around the mushroom head.
John smirked to himself before pulling Sherlock down to him, and connecting their lips in a passionate kiss.
The second I open the wooden impediment, John is pushing me back against the wall and assaulting my lips with avid, concupiscent passion.
“If you ever want to be let out of these...” John drawled, a hand coming up to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. “I suggest you do as I say.”
“Yes. And I’ll ask you questions, because really... I don’t know very much about you. And I can’t tell with a look.”
It’s always been rushed, it’s always been quiet, secret moments hidden away in cupboards, in the bubble, pressed against the wall, on desks, under tables, but now, now we’re here.
Sherlock reached out to touch his hand, and gently squeezed one of his fingers before taking both of their tea cups back through to the kitchen.
I continue to work him on my fingers for a little bit longer, drawing low moans and whines from his beautiful parted lips.
I didn’t manage to silence him when he came, a loud groan ripping through his body, startling us both as he finished all over my clothed thigh.
“No you’re not. Look,” He starts, and pulls me in to his lap. “I’m only going out with Rosie as a formality. She’s just a friend. Why would I want her when I have you.”
I begin rocking my hips and grinding down on him, my mouth agape as he hits spots inside of me I didn’t even know I had.
Sherlock looked up from the pile of clothes strewn about her room and over at Mycroft who was leant against the doorframe.
That’s what she told herself as she scrabbled to her knees, curse words uttering from her lips as she scrambled to her feet, a sweat breaking out on her forehead.
John loitered for a moment longer, wondering why his dad was here, before deciding to brush it off and sat down on the sofa.
“Frustrated might be a better word to describe this.” He chuckles lightheartedly, leaning towards me and allowing his head to rest on my shoulder.
“I also lost another tooth.” Sherlock said, indicating with her tongue the space where one of her canines had fallen out.
This a short chapter, but I hope you enjoy! Thank you so much for the lovely comments, they make me happy :)
“Sherlock Holmes. He’s a freak. He knows way more than he should. He doesn’t even need to be in this school. He could go to one of those schools for gifted kids, but he likes to freak out the kids here. Likes to think he’s better than them.”
“Well, That wasn’t exactly words, but...” John chuckled. He reached down to grasp Sherlock’s hand, and squeezed it affectionately.
He missed her so much. He hadn’t seen her in over three years, and it was killing him. He lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling as he waited for sleep to come. He was on duty tonight, and he needed rest. He was just drifting off when Thompson came back in.
“Sherlock, are you going to open this door?” John asked on the off chance Sherlock was just messing with him.
He lets out a low groan of pleasure as I climb off his lap and settle in between his legs, slowly unzipping his trousers.
I don’t think he has any idea about the affect he has on me, and how arduous a task it is to avoid ejaculating in my briefs again.
He saluted the tall man before casting a glance to the young boy before him. He had a mop of brown hair, and bright green eyes. He had to be at least 16, but he didn’t look any older than 12.
Sherlock woke the next morning aching all over. His hips were sore, and his arms were twinging. He looked over beside him, his eyes falling on an empty space.
He watched as John took out the blindfold. John carefully tied it around Sherlock’s head, making sure he couldn’t see anything. John was always so gentle with him. That was of course until his soul purpose was to be harsh.
He bent forwards, and rolled up his pyjama trousers, revealing a strip of bandages tied round his leg. Sherlock slowly unwrapped them, all the while keeping her eyes focused on Johns face. He wasn’t looking at her, instead he was staring off in to space. She paused when she saw the small patch of bloodied gauze. What was underneath was the reason John had come home. She tentatively peeled it back. Just under johns knee cap was a patch of red skin, and there, in the middle, was a bullet wound. Sherlock normally didn’t have a problem with blood, and injuries, and yet found herself frozen to the spot. But it wasn’t the wound itself, it was everything it represented. Something so small had done so much damage, and regardless of its size, John had been shot. For the past three years, he was in a place in which he could be shot; killed. Sherlock tried not to allow her face to show how she was feeling. She chewed her lip between her teeth, and gently dabbed a washing cloth
I reach down between us and begin fiddling with the cool metal of his belt buckle. He lifts his hips to allow me to slide his trousers down along with his underwear, and suddenly, it all becomes very real.
“Fine, keep at it. If you fall through the floor and end up in downstair’s living room, I’m not helping you explain. ‘I’m a dickhead’ that’s all you’re gonna have to say.”
Sherlock felt pleasure course through him at John’s praise, his cock pulsing in his jeans. He hadn’t paid much attention to his own arousal, too focused on pleasing John. Apparently, John hadn’t missed a beat, and after pulling his pants back up, began sliding his hands up Sherlock’s thighs. John attached their lips in a heated kiss, thrusting his tongue in and out of Sherlock’s mouth. The brunette allowed John to roll him backwards into the pillows, and cover his lithe body with his muscular one. That’s when they heard the door open.
“Come on John... take those fingers out and give it to me good and proper.” He moans breathlessly as he squirms around a recently added third finger.
His mother’s face contorted to show concern, fear even. John couldn’t blame her. Last time they had a conversation like this, it was about Harriet’s drinking, and the time before that it was about his father leaving. He supposed that compared to all that, having a boyfriend was not a big deal.
The officers grin disappeared at Sherlock's words, and was replaced by a look of shock. John, never having heard Sherlock's theory stood and watched in awe.
Three weeks and six days till I’m out, and I can leave this hell hole, I can live with John, I can sleep in his arms.
Sherlock’s heart was pounding so hard and fast under johns cheek where his head was resting on her clavicle.
“It’s the little pleasures, I suppose.” Mike murmurs as he shovels a spoon full of vanilla ice cream in to his mouth. The strawberry flavour tastes like medicine, and the chocolate flavour is an unsettling grey colour. Vanilla, although not very exciting, is by far the safest option.
John momentarily opened his eyes to nod his head, then released his hand. Sherlock continued his movements, base to tip, and up again. He increased the speed, which appeared to have a very positive effect on John.
“Who’s this, darling?” She asked, gesturing to Sherlock, who was sat on the sofa, trying to take up as little space as possible.
John’s are soft on mine, a contrast to the traces of stubble on his jaw that rub against my cheek. He brings up both hands to cup my face, effectively forcing me to kneel up and turn towards him.
Sherlock had abandoned her heels somewhere in a corner, her curls, now shoulder length, were half tied up in a bun, half hanging over her eyes, and she had been sipping at a glass of Buck’s Fizz in whilst she aimed about four inches away from the board.
Sherlock slurred some explanation as to how she knew all this, but John wasn’t sure he would have even understood her if they were both sober. Regardless of what she’d been drinking, the girl spoke faster than a bullet train. The pair spewed nonsense to each other till they were gasping for breath from giggling.
I squeeze my legs together even tighter, and desperately try and pay attention to wiggins, and... whatever it was he was telling me about...
School was mediocre. Sherlock had been waiting for john at lunch time, turning down an invitation from Molly to sit with her and her friends. Molly, he could tolerate. It was her friends he couldn’t stand. Nearly all their stories started with ‘so me and and my boyfriend.’
“What about that one? Purple is your colour Sherlock.” Molly said, holding out a purple crop top with little white flowers.
“Yes definitely.” Sherlock said quickly, then grabbed John by the hand, and dragged him into the hall.
“Yeah, I know. You wouldn’t believe how many remotes it’s eaten.” John chuckled, running his hand through his blond tresses.
John pressed a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s lips then went to pull out, but he felt his stomach fall through the floor when he caught sight of a red liquid.
“Small marks... some discolouration. Not too worried, but I do need to carry out an internal examination.”
“I’m here... I’m here...” I murmur softly as I kiss him. “It’s perfectly normal to feel a little emotional.”
John remained on the bed to catch his breath, his vision still fuzzy. He’d sat up by the time Sherlock came back.
“I wish nobody had to take me, as I wish I wasn’t going-“ Sherlock cut herself off when she saw her mother looking disapprovingly at her. “Yes, John I’d appreciate that greatly. Thank you.”
“Oh fu...” Sherlock panted, subconsciously beginning to rock his hips forwards to meet johns fingers.
She knew this was Mycroft’s way of checking she was ok, and keeping on top of things. Mycroft didn’t ask anymore questions, and stayed quite for a moment, just looking down at her shoes.
He chuckled as he took a sip of said tea. Sherlock felt sadness ebbing at her as she watched him. He could sit here with her, laugh and joke, and everything was fine. Then he’d fall asleep, and down in to the hollow pit of nightmares from which he couldn’t escape. She wished she could help more. She couldn’t wake him up when he was dreaming in case he went in to shock. All she could do was listen to him scream and cry, waiting for him to wake up. She could reassure him when he woke up, hold his hand, kiss his cheeks, tell him he was safe.
I swallow, and take the book. He nods, and turns to walk away. He has a slight limp as he marches back to the bubble. This observation just adds confirmation to my earlier deduction. I wobble back in to my cube, ever so slightly light headed, and beating myself up for being so blunt with him. Why am I such an asshole?
Sherlock giggled, and pressed their lips together more forcefully. John leant back against the side of the bath, pulling Sherlock with him. The brunette sprawled out on his chest, gripping his waist with his legs as he gently rolled his hips. John moaned softly as Sherlock ran his tongue along his lips, asking for entrance. The blond happily obliged, his moans getting louder as Sherlock sucked on his tongue, a favoured move of his. John pulled the brunette closer by his hips, and began forcefully thrusting his tongue in to his mouth. Sherlock let out a low groan, enjoying the feeling of John’s hardening length pressing into his abdomen. He brought his hands up to run his fingers through johns soft blond hair. He gasped into johns mouth when he felt the blond pinch his backside. John didn’t even want to think about the amount of water that had sloshed over the sides and in to the floor from all their movement.
John had seen Anderson and Donovan follow Sherlock out of the school gates, and gone after them. He'd lost them after getting distracted by a phone call from his mum. He came across one of those streets that are deserted other than the sheds that backed onto them. In the distance, he spotted the pair stood over something on the floor. His blood ran cold when it dawned on him that the something was in fact someone, and someone was Sherlock. He hadn't even realised what he was doing until he felt a sharp pain in his knuckles, and Anderson exclaiming, holding his bloody nose.
Sherlock giggled a little at John’s blatant response. His giggles turned to soft moans as John dragged his lips down his pale torso, all the way to his pubic bone.
I don’t understand why people cry at weddings. I don’t understand why people laugh when they’re nervous. I don’t understand when people are mad at me. But what confuses me most is how emotions make people do things, manipulating them like puppets.
Even though the question was vague, and not nearly as crude as it could have been, John still felt his cheeks flushing.
“Well, I would have done something about that if we hadn’t been interrupted.” He says with a quick swipe of his tongue to his lower lip.
“John, I think that would be best.” Sherlock interjected before John could open his mouth, then gently placed his hands on his shoulders, and ushered the broad teen out of the room.
P.S. I can do a flash back chapter where John and Sherlock have a discussion about their kinks, safety words, all that.
“I’m fine thank you, Mrs Watson.” Sherlock said, her peripheral vision still picking up on John’s manner.
John darted his tongue out to lick his bottom lip. Although he was still fully dressed, Sherlock already felt naked under John’s hungry gaze. He could swear John wasn’t blinking anymore as he stood there by the door.
He wrapped his arm around Sherlock, and hugged him closer. They lay there, just basking in the after glow, wrapped in each other’s arms as they listened to Lana Del Ray on a loop, the tin of pineapples on the counter completely forgotten.
I crawl up to kiss him, and I am positively surprised when he grabs my face in both hands and kisses me with a fierce passion.
“Did you not see my status update on Facebook?” He chides softly as he runs his pale, spider like fingers over my bedspread. “I guess not.”
Sherlock slowly rose to his feet with a supportive arm from from John, who wrapped him in a blanket, and lead him in to the bathroom.
I notice the other inmates tense at my sides, a sheen of excitement sweeping the group as a potential standoff presents itself.
Sherlock peered over in to the bag at the purchased garments. There was a gag, a bottle of lube, he was already wearing the kitten ears, and then there was a lime green vibrator.
“No, I borrowed them. I fully intend to give them back, believe me. The little one is a mean drunk. Kept biting me.”
He whipped his head around to see Sherlock amongst the sea of people. His family took a step back as the brunette hurtled towards him.
John sat himself down next to Sherlock, and peered over at the newspaper. The page was about the murder of a teacher, and Sherlock was staring intently at the picture.
and sweat nauseating. Dead soldiers littered the floor, limp, like rag dolls left out in the cold, their blood staining the crisp snow beneath Johns shoes. He pulled his jacket tighter, hugging it to his shivering form. He forced his legs to keep moving, keep walking, closer to the army base. He knew he couldn’t sit down, he knew he wouldn’t get up again. So on he went, trudging through the bloody snow, stepping over the bodies of his fallen comrades. There were Germans too. These were the men he’d played football with on that first Christmas when they’d stopped fighting for one day. Like small children, fighting over a toy. Except they weren’t children, they were men, and they were fighting for their country. He paused when his eyes fell on a familiar mop of brown hair. Thompson. His bright green eyes were still open, still glistening. John felt his heart rench as he looked down at the boy. He looked even younger in death. Despite his better judgment, John got down on his knees.
By the time I add the second finger, he’s scraping at my back with blunt nails, tugging at my hair, groaning profanities.
The second they were through the door, John was attacking Sherlock’s lips with his own. He kissed him forcefully, desperately, and with passion, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. He bit at his lips, gently clacked their teeth together and massaged his tongue over Sherlock’s. Sherlock was moaning without shame, no care to how loud he was. Items of clothing dotted the floor in a trail to their bedroom door. Sherlock was only in his briefs when John pinned him to the door with his hips, holding his lanky arms up above his head.
Sherlock furrowed her brows. She knew better than to turn around again as it would be blatantly obvious. Sherlock was no stranger to unwanted attention, and saw this situation as no different to the others.
John was still asleep when she entered the living room, but he woke when she riffled through her back.
Her voice was a breathless expression of demure as she searched John’s eyes, waiting for his answer.
The boys chatted for a few minutes about homework, up coming tests, and the very interesting gossip that Mycroft had been spotted talking to a girl. To one, not at one. At one would be nothing new. They’d been spotted by James Davidson, a boy in their year, chatting away in a corner. The girl even had her hand on mycroft’s arm apparently. John had seen it on the schools football group chat, and reported back to Sherlock.
“John I need you to fuck me! Fuck me with your big cock!” Sherlock howled, never breaking eye contact with John.
When Sherlock awoke the next morning, she was in her parlour. There was also an ache in her back. That was when she remembered who her mattress was. John was sound asleep beneath her, snoring softly. After glancing at the clock, which read 05:30, she lay her head back down on his chest, and drifted off.
Sherlock and John looked from each other to Irene and back again. They were amazed at how well she was behaving. Sherlock grinned to himself at the reminder that this by no means meant he had to behave. He toed off one of his shoes, and discretely began rubbing his foot up and down johns ankle. He didn’t seem to mind, and affectionately bumped his knee against Sherlock’s.
“Oh fuck... we have to...” Sherlock gestured blindly to the door behind him, steering John to the wall by his shoulders. “Jump up.” The blond panted, staring at Sherlock with intense desire.
Sherlock took a deep breath. She put her knitting down, and followed Mrs Hudson in to the kitchen, where a mushroom and chicken pie sat on the table.
“Medical student, you paint and play rugby in your spare time, you’re a long way from home, second child.” Sherlock said in one breath, his eyes roaming john from head to toe.
Sherlock’s eyes are clenched shut as his whole body shakes. His limbs are trembling and his head is thrown forward, quiet whines escaping him. I nearly failed to notice Sherlock’s situation in the thralls of my post orgasmic bliss, but the unmistakable, wet patch that spreads to the front of his trousers is a give away.
The six inebriated teens all laughed, those in heels in danger of falling over. They made their way over to a table, and collapsed down in the seats. They realised that they were only five by this point, having lost Irene in the sea of people.
“Once.” Sherlock said, refusing to make eye contact. “While fantasying about you.” He added quietly.
John furrowed his brows. It was in that moment that he realised how alien the concept of having friends was to Sherlock. He’d never had anyone in his life who valued his opinions. John felt sadness creeping up on him as he looked at the younger teen.
John was almost directly above him now, providing him with a better angle. He locked his elbows in place before dropping his hips again.
“John!” Sherlock squealed excitedly, grabbing at the air in front of him from where he lay on his back on the floor. John walked across the floor, and helped his boyfriend to his feet.
Sherlock’s mellifluous voice went straight to johns cock which was already rock hard, and straining against his boxers. He smirked to himself, then leant in towards Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock let out a somewhat desperate whimper and threw his head back. When John pulled Sherlock’s trousers and underwear down, he was rock hard and weeping. John felt a bolt of arousal go through him as he allowed his eyes to run over Sherlock. The younger boy had his eyes shut, teeth clenched, his chest rising rapidly and his cock throbbing between his legs.
I don’t know what twisted issues I have swimming about in my head, but that has my arousal spiking, and my cock throbbing.
She was tall for a girl, but the slender teen towered over her. He towered over a lot of the children in his class, lucky as otherwise he would have been the subject for much more bullying than he already was. Many children felt too intimidated to go with in a five yard radius of him. Molly sure didn’t feel the same. Sherlock was sure she’d climb into his lap given half a chance. Probably a quarter of a chance he rethought as he caught her staring at him, her tongue just about ready to fall out of her mouth.
I slump down in the chair, and take to the cross word. No one is doing anything of importance from what I can see, just getting ready for visitation. I look up every now and then to keep an eye on things, but nothing catches my attention. A few hours later, I get up to stretch my legs, and take a walk around the dorm. Everything seems in order, so I go to head back to the bubble when I see a book lying on the floor.
John slid his other hand round Sherlock’s front, and situated it between his legs, just under where Sherlock’s testicles sat in the panties. Sherlock groaned quietly, and chewed his lip between his teeth.
“This is by far the best dessert I’ve ever had.” John chuckled as he moved his hands down to spread Sherlock’s legs wide.
They would have stayed there just basking in the after glow if John hadn’t felt Sherlock dozing off.
Mr Watson came through the door a few moments later. He said a brief hello to Sherlock, then turned his attention to his son. With the help of his father, John managed to limp over to the other sofa. While she watched him moving, Sherlock noticed something odd about johns injury, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.
“I’ve always been able to keep myself separate from my emotions... but now... now, look at me... shaking... with fear.”
He noted the faint words in pen on johns cheek where he’d fallen asleep on his notes, and the sleepy dust in the corners of his eye.
He grins before pressing a chaste kiss to my cheek. I try and catch his lips, but he pushes me back with a hand to the chest.
I’m so wet and hard for him right now, my briefs both soaking wet and threatening to rip as John continues to tease me.
The young girl had come down with the flu, so hadn’t seen the new arrival until just now, and was very over excited.
While I retract my nails from his skin, I keep my grip on his shoulders steady as I try and even out my breathing.
John shuddered and bit his lip. He cleared his thoughts after a moment, and turned his attention back to the beautiful girl beneath him, her dark hair spread about the covers, her cheeks flushed, lips bruised and full.
Carnal lust had his nerves tingling, and every brush of john’s fingers had him reeling. John briefly broke the kiss to pull off his own shirt.
“Why do you need an excuse.” Sherlock shrugged, used to just casually strolling in to places half an hour late without so much as a ‘sorry.’
She gripped Johns shoulders, and lifted her hips up to allow him to reach round under her. John could have sworn that in addition to the corset, her clothes were designed to be as difficult as possible to take off.
I look in to his steely eyes, and find the next words just tumbling from my mouth before I really think about it.
“Yes.” She said, turning to meet his gaze. “It’s not easy. Apart from you, nobody ever understood me.”
John kept his lips on Sherlock’s as he laced his fingers through the waistband of Sherlock’s cotton briefs, only pulling away briefly to admire his raging hard-on.
I don’t say anything and continue to force myself to eat. The guards switch posts before I have a chance to go back to... observing... him. After lunch, I quickly go back to my bunk. I read for a little, a simple pass time to stop me from going mad. Mike comes back shortly after and submerges himself in a radio show. I look up at the clock. Work duty. I put on my jacket, and hightail it outside. I don’t mind working in the garden. Horticulture is something that has always peaked my interest. Of course I’d much rather something more interesting than squash, but what are you going to do? I sign out a rake, and get to turning the soil. It’s not exactly very mentally stimulating, but physical exertion is the only option I have right now. God, prison is dull.
“Of course! Oh, I’m sorry dear that you’re fighting with your mother, but I’m glad to have you here.”
My fantasy is short lived as I remember he’d have to put down the address when he leaves and he’d get checked up on. They can hardly see he’s living with me.
John reattached his lips to Sherlock’s ear, mouthing at the shell, tracing the sensitive area with his tongue. Sherlock rolled his neck into johns touch, small sighs escaping him. John’s hands travelled up Sherlock’s torso, every nerve tingling.
John immediately pulled Sherlock in to his arms and held him close to his chest, kissing his cheeks and whispering words of love in his ear.
“Don’t think she saw through our ‘video game’ cover though, do you?” Sherlock teased after a moment.
“Like you’re better than me! That I’m some stupid little girl, who doesn’t understand the consequences of what she’s doing. It’s bad enough when Mum does it, but it’s just patronising when you do it.”
“I’m a doctor. I can go where I please without question. Maybe I came to talk to someone. No one needs to know I wasn’t.”
“Celebrating in style?” He asks, referring to the half smoked cigar in John’s hand, end still alight.
"Yes, I really enjoyed it. Right up until the moth to mouth on those creepy dolls... if you'd been much worse, I may have had to do that to you." John joked, but instantly paused as he realised the meaning of his words. He sat back again, and ran his eyes over Sherlock. He was regarding him with the same heated stare.
When we pull away this time, it only lasts a second or two before his hands are on my face, pulling me back to him.
I grin and turn on my heel. I look back at him one last time and see him mouth the words ‘love you’.
They had both been given very basic sex education their biology class, but that started with a talk on what periods were, and ended with being told not to have sex. Sherlock had overheard gossip in school, and looked in to the medical side of things from a scientific interest. John on the other hand had practically been strong armed in to listening to locker room talk, or trench talk...
He was perfectly able to come up with a more sophisticated prank, but one of the same nature as John’s was definitely more appealing to him.
“The pair were both seen in the video. The man was the deputy head, and he had offered Jillian a promotion. She declined it, unknowingly to him because of the new job offer. Because of the... unprofessional nature of their relationship, he found out that she was leaving, and just like that, what started as a domestic fight ended with him whacking her over the head with a lamp. Dead.”
“Umm... no-“ I cut myself off when I feel his lips decent to the sensitive buds, which immediately perk up under his tongue.
If he didn’t sound so desperate, and look to be in agony, John probably would have enjoyed seeing his boyfriend cuffed to the bed frame.
Her bleeding, lower lip trembled as she rolled her head in the pillow, her sweaty curls sticking to her head.
“He’s in SHU, I’d imagine. They’ll take guard testimonies, then they’ll decide what to do about him.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what was falling from his mouth by this point. He just knew that he needed John to fuck him, and what he said to get him to just that didn’t matter. Another finger had his toes curl. He cried out at the loss of contact when John pulled fingers out. He turned his head to see what John was doing, and caught sight of him lubing up his thick, lengthy cock. It was flushed with blood, stiff and pulsing. Sherlock felt his mouth watering and his own cock throb.
I quickly grab for the nearest receptacle and hand it to him. He immediately hurls up the contents of his stomach.
Sherlock let out a sudden squeak when she felt Johns thumb rubbing the bundle of nerves between her legs.
Wrapped in johns arms, john’s face nuzzled in the crook of his neck, his body spooned around him, Sherlock couldn’t have felt safer. He could feel Johns heart beating against his back, his warm breath against the nape of his neck.
John, slumped on the floor, chest heaving, heart pounding, was cursing himself for letting the little tease get to him.
“And you’ll only tire me more once you’re here.” She sighed as she lent back in the chair. “But... you’re all worth it in the end.”
“Because I’m really annoying, and I’ve either worked with them before, or they’ve heard horror stories, and refuse to work with me. So, if you hear of anyone who’s interested...”
John wondered what would happen if he spread his fingers in a scissoring manor. Sherlock whined, and bolted upright, his eyes still scrunched shut.
Christmas Day arrived just as it did every year, but the blanket of snow brought frostbite, the smell of turkey replaced with gunpowder, and the Christmas carols were sung with horse voices, barely holding on.
That’s the first time he’s said my name. I can’t help but notice a certain warmth in my cheeks as I watch him walk away.
Sherlock walked over to where John was standing, and pressed his ear to the wall. Two voices. One was Mycroft, and the was indeed a girl.
I look over to Mike, who’s sound asleep. The depth of his sleeping is much alike to a log, so I don’t face any chance of waking him, but I reach into my locker for a sock to silence myself anyway. Actually, better take two. Don’t really want to make a mess.
All this sneaking around is like every teenage chick flick ever written, but I won’t deny that it’s also really fucking hot.
In my dismay, I fail to notice the transaction going on between Moriarty and Sherlock on the walk back.
John dug his nails in to Sherlock’s sides, making him whine loudly. He picked up his pace, pounding his cock in to sherlocks soft body as hard as he could.
John returned to the living room with coffee for both of them, and sat down next to Sherlock who curled up against his shoulder. Johns phone buzzed on the table, Molly’s ID appearing on the screen.
Sherlock trembled when John pulled his skirt up, revealing his bare ass. The smack on his exposed skin had him cry out, his hips jolting forwards. There was an angry red mark already forming on Sherlock’s formally creamy skin. John was using all his self control not to lean down and bite Sherlock on the ass, as pleasurable as that would be.
John’s eyes went wide as the brunette slid off his lap, and slipped back out of the living room, swaying his hips as he went.
“Yes. I actually prefer to use it in place of my first name. William is so mundane... as is Scott...”
“I can read the lies in your voice, your lack of a nutritious diet in your complexion, and your sexual endeavours in your walk... right down to the very position... can’t say I’m surprised.” He mutters the last bit in to his styrofoam cup, a faint smile tugging at his lips.
After a few more minutes of cuddling, they both came to the conclusion that they were in great need of showers, so decided to shower at each of their houses, then meet up again at midday for a movie.
John chewed the inside of his cheek, his eyes drifting up. He looked back at Sherlock who was staring at him intently.
I most certainly haven’t, and I remind him of this by opening my eyes before swallowing around the head of his cock.
“John and his mother have got into a fight, and I thought he could stay the night.” Sherlock drawled, tilting his head to look at his mother.
Mycroft chuckled, but cut himself off when his mother turned to glare at him. She was the only person Mycroft listened to.
The start of the year was a few hours away. The Watsons and the Holmes, among with a few friends, had decided to have a dinner party. The youngest two attendants had no idea the start of the year would not be the same as the end. Mycroft and Harriet were swapping university stories, and John and Sherlock were up in the latter’s room discussing their plans and goals for the New Years.
Sherlock rolled his neck from side to side, moans of pleasure escaping him. There was still a weird sensation of being ‘invaded’ but the buzz shooting up his spine was enjoyable to say the least. He began bucking his hips up in time with John’s thrusts, arching off the pillow.
Which is true, but I chose being a correctional officer for a reason. I need something invigorating. Something exciting.
He hasn’t so much as initiated a kiss since he got here, so it takes me a minute to gather my thoughts.
“Fuuuuck...” I groan as I bury myself to a hilt with a firm thrust. “Oh you’re so tight... fucking hell.”
I myself am getting off purely on the bliss he is evidently experiencing, the only thing holding me back is the unnatural feeling of being invaded.
“John.” He curtly nodded his head, then sauntered back down the hall, and disappeared up the stairs.
John slid his underwear back down, then took Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s heart hammered violently when John placed both their hands in his cock. It was warm, and stiff, and throbbed under Sherlock’s touch. He heard John moan softly, and his eyelashes fluttered.
Sherlock screwed up her eyebrows, and walked down a few more steps in hope of hearing a little more.
During the first half an hour, he’d had an entire conversation with a pot plant, which to be honest, probably paid about as much attention to his opinions on zinc batteries as his friends would. Another fifteen minutes went by, and the girls learnt that Sherlock could do the splits after dancing on a table to Cyndi Lauper.
With his new found courage, he reached for johns hand, and brought it down to the waistband of his underwear.
They walked quickly down to johns house, laughing and joking as they went, affectionately bumping each other’s shoulders. John caught himself staring at Sherlock as they approached his house. He wasn’t sure how it had taken him so long to realise, but he had fallen in love with him.
Sherlock sat with her while she ate, although most of it ended up going around her mouth rather than in it. She turned to look at Sherlock with a broad, chocolate covered grin. Sherlock felt her heart rench as she looked at the happy child. Oblivious. She’d give anything to be that shielded from the world once more. She hadn’t heard from John in four months. If she was oblivious, she wouldn’t have jumped to all the tragic conclusions on what had happened to him.
John smacked him without abandon, the little whimpers and moans from Sherlock sending waves of pleasure along his length.
He pulled them off, and threw them into a corner before sitting back on his heels, his dripping erection standing stiff between his legs. John walked round to the other side of the bed, and went through the chest of draws. Sherlock inhaled audibly when he saw the red, satin blindfold in johns hand.
She hadn’t eaten since yesterday, so her stomach was empty, leaving nothing but acid to lick up her throat.
I took a chance. I took a chance, and I think it went well. I keep an eye out for him throughout the day as I move from post to post. The amount of times I spot him, I wonder if he’s looking for me as well. After catching his eye in a crowded room for about the forth time, I finally see him on his own, in the garden, watering some marrows. He goes inside after a moment, and attempts to lift a bag of soil, but he seems to be struggling. I check to make sure there is another CO around to watch the other inmates before walking over to him.
Sherlock went rigid all of a sudden as he felt a buzzing sensation spread through his body. It was weird, different, stimulating. It was only for a second but it was enough to have him reach out to grip the counter top.
She looked at him with her crystal blue eyes. Although they were the same colour as Sherlock’s, hers were warm, and full of curiosity. Mycroft’s were cold, and piercing. Like a reptile’s.
“Sherlock.” His mother warned curtly, although it was clear she was holding back laughter at the expression.
Sherlock explained where he’d been, but left out the part where he’d given a speech on the wonder that his John Watson.
Sherlock felt a pressure building, blood roaring in his ears. Before he could process what was happening, the cord in his abdomen snapped, and his vision went white as he finished all over himself. John couldn’t help but marvel at how beautiful Sherlock was in this moment. So beautiful, and all his. He snapped back to reality when he heard Sherlock clear his throat.
John tilted his head to the side, and leant in towards Sherlock. “I don’t see why this should be an exception.”
I can’t help but falter for a moment before pulling my shirt over my head by the hem, keeping the sleeves over my arms.
12 and a half hellish months. For good behaviour and wrongful punishment, you get 2 weeks lobbed off your sentence.
People push their friends out of the way of bullets and take them instead. Why? Because they love them?
I look down at the red and purple mark just over from my left hipbone and feel a similar colour spread on to my cheeks.
I reach out for the table in front of me, and bear down on it so hard I can feel my nails making indentations in the repurposed wooden surface.
“We all know inmates try and get in the way when someone’s date is coming up. Maybe that’s what’s going on here.”
“I know he does! He gets letters from some posh bird all the time.” Brenton called from where he was perched on a table. “She’s got some fancy sounding name. Like she’s a fairy tale character, or something.”
Sherlock’s hips bucked up, his knuckles turned white, and his eyes flew open as he reached his high.
He grips my shoulders, and I grab him by the thighs, making him jump up so his long legs are wrapped around my waist.
John raised his eyebrows, searching for confirmation. Sherlock offered him a nod in return, and reached forward to grab at his shoulders, careful to avoid the bite mark.
Sherlock flailed about, the pressure building in his abdomen becoming too much for him. He could tell John was close too, his movements becoming erratic and sloppy.
He’s pressing his lips up against mine and his hands are tightly gripping my shoulders. It’s one of those kisses where even though it’s sweet and innocent, it’s full of passion. It’s the way every kiss is with that one person...
“You’ve met him, how many friends do you imagine he has? I’m probably the closest thing he has to a friend.”
I want to scold myself as I know the pout on my face is visible when he pulls away and answers the call.
He was so close, a few more seconds and he’d be a goner. He forced himself to open his eyes, desperate to see what John was doing. John had his head thrown forwards, eyes clenched shut, wrist frantically pumping up and down his leaking shaft.
“Basically, we stand here and tell them they can’t take food out of here, and to keep the noise down. It’s normally quite calm.”
“An enemy.” The boy smirked, leaning his weight on his umbrella. “If you asked him, he’d probably say his arch enemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
John increased his pace, hips crashing together, tongues fighting, wet slapping sounds echoing, loud moans filling the room.
I don’t tell him with sentences, but I’m certain he knows this by my moans and the claw marks I am almost certainly leaving on his shoulders.
He hit replay, and grinned to himself when he saw Sherlock lightly bobbing his head in time to the beat.
“Just be grateful there’s only one of her. Not only did I have to deal with you fighting with me, but fighting with this one as well.” Their mother chided, gently running her hand over her youngest daughter’s hand.
“War will never leave him.” Mrs Holmes said thoughtfully after a moment. “But as long as you don’t either, he’ll be fine.”
Mycroft knew Sherlock started the scarf a few months back, but she kept getting distracted, ever the procrastinator.
I want my mouth on him, I want to run my tongue over his tip, I want to swallow every drop of his release.
She looked up at him with her baby blues, then down at the biscuit, and back again a few times before taking it from him.
After a power nap, it’s back in the car, and back to work. I get posted to the cafeteria just as lunch starts. The boy walks in with a group of other inmates and sits down in a table corner. He is really very attractive. I have identified as bisexual since I was 17, but I’ve never met a man in person who’s taken my fancy; not till now at least. That very person is sat no more than twenty yards away from me... and staring right at me. Normally when I catch him, he looks away, but this time, he doesn’t. Instead, he chews his bottom lip, rather coyly if I might say.
He’s completely sated, eyes closed, chest heaving, his fingers digging in to the sides of the chair.
She sat there in tears as John recounted his story of capture and torture to her. When he stopped answering her letters, she’d assumed the worst. She hadn’t been far off. The pair sat for a hours, swapping stories. Sherlock told John about the brief month she’d belonged to the girl guides. She’d been praised for her abilities to remember long messages, and pass them on, but she’d been dismissed after telling one of the scouts he was a simpering idiot, who made the dog who tagged along by his heels look like a genius, on the grounds that it was ‘unladylike’. He laughed as she recounted the time Mycroft got arrested. She’d joined the sufferagets, and had been carted off by a police officer after thumping him with her umbrella. That was also, no doubt, ‘unladylike’.
His shoulders move back a little when I press the stethoscope to his chest. He’s toned, but not exactly muscular, with long arms and legs, giving him an overall, wiry figure.
“Fuck, you’re so gorgeous.” He groans as he stares down at my hole, his eyes glazed over in what I think might just be awe.
He moved his lips down to Sherlock’s neck, and began sucking hard at his pulse point. Sherlock moaned loudly, and threw his head back in pleasure. His moans only got louder as John began to role his hips forward. John brought his lips back up to Sherlock’s, plunging his tongue in to the other boy’s mouth. It was hot, wet, and passionate, tongues dancing, fighting, tasting each other, exploring every inch. John was now forcefully bucking his hips against Sherlock’s, making the door clatter loudly each time John forced his body up against it.
“Use protection!” John shouted as they walked passed Mycroft’s room. The pair chuckled as they ran down the stairs, and out the door.
Sherlock glanced between the dress and her sister’s face, clearly surprised. Mycroft rolled her eyes, and held the dress out to the younger girl.
He wasn’t sure where he was supposed to look, whether to close his eyes, whether to look at the ceiling. His heart was pounding, threatening to break his ribs, his lungs were desperately scrambling for oxygen, his brain short circuiting.
Moriarty is clearly very touchy about his height, because the next thing he does, is punch me in the throat. I fall back against the bookcase, coughing and spluttering. I barely have a chance to evaluate how stupid i’m being before his hands are around my throat. It does make sense that being a smart arse is what’s getting me beaten up, but I know this is about something else... there’s no denying that. But I can’t focus on that right now, because I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. Moriarty has such a tight hold on my neck that my airways are almost completely constricted. I feel like I’m screaming, but I can’t tell. I try to push him off, but my flailing arms are of little use. I feel my eyes watering and threatening to close. I can’t... I can’t-
My day pretty much sucks, except for one inmate getting stuck in between the vending machines after diving in for a packet of jammy dodgers.
“Why don’t you tell me what they are...” Sherlock breathed, running his long fingers down John’s back. “And I just might let you do them.”
“Mr Holmes, you’re under arrest. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.”
He picked up a giggling Sherlock, and carried him bridle style up the short flight of stairs to their bedroom, ignoring the weird sensation of Sherlock’s tongue in his ear.
“Can you make sure dad isn’t in our house when we get back?” He asked as they walked down to the bus stop.
My breath hitches audibly as the feel of John’s large, calloused hand on my cock translates from nervous impulses, to the most sensual perceptions I have ever felt.
I dig my nails in to my knees as I sit still, a coping mechanism I have adopted in an arduous attempt at controlling the animalistic impulses to jump out from under the table and punch her in the face.
“Oh my god, oh my god. My Sherlock, my god... I...” his words broke apart as he sobbed in to her hair.
“Mrs Watson, I think your son is a brilliant young man. He’s a wonderful friend, and one of the kindest people I know. Don’t worry about him.” Sherlock said softly, taking a seat down beside her. He was surprising himself at the words escaping his mouth, but they were certainly genuine.
With Sherlock actually beginning to enjoy himself, John felt as though he could finally allow himself to enjoy it too. He knew that once he did that though, it wouldn’t last very long, the vice like grip Sherlock’s body had on him being the most intense, euphoric sensation he’d ever felt.
His vision went white as he shot off in to Sherlock’s mouth, his lower abdominal muscles tensing, earth shattering pleasure filling him. He was unable to form any words when Sherlock finally pulled back, completely stunned. Sherlock sat there panting as his adrenaline high came to an end. He noticed how uncomfortable he was in that moment. His underwear was soaked, and some of his release was beginning to trickle down his leg.
Sherlock smiled internally, and kept working his head up and down. John was so close already. The sight before him was sinful. Sherlock, blindfolded, tied up, and with his perfect, plump lips wrapped round his penis. Sherlock knew exactly how to please John. He moaned, and swallowed round johns dick, making the athlete cry out, and grip the back of his head. He came hard down Sherlock’s throat, strands of creamy fluid filling his mouth. The brunette gagged, but managed to swallow after a moment.
With that thought in mind, I make a grab for his hand and guide it up towards the slackened elastic waistband that is doing its best to hold my trousers up.
“Regardless of whether I was going out or not, neither is an excuse for you to invite a girl over to have intercourse with.” Sherlock protested as his brother tried to push him out of the way.
There was more she wanted to say, but she could tell john knew every word without her speaking them. He could see it in her eyes, in her coquettish smile.
“No... I didn’t have time to find a shirt this morning... I was a little... occupied.” John panted against Sherlock’s skin.
I feel myself getting hot under the collar again, so I excuse myself from breakfast early, feigning the need to stretch my legs.
Not much happens throughout the day, a few scuffles, name calling, etc. Hopefully something more entertaining comes along.
She pushed her chair back, scratching against the floor. Once inside her room, she slammed the door shut, and fell back against it, slowly sliding down to the floor. Tears fell like a river from her eyes, sobs racking her body.
The three of them walked back slowly, Sherlock and John hand in hand, and Rosie trailing along behind them.
Sherlock did as he was told, and lay down on the pillows. They’d found out very early on in their relationship that Sherlock had a thing for authority, and if John asked him to do something using a lower register, he would do it, no hesitation. John clambered back on to the bed, and settled in between Sherlock’s long, sock covered legs. Sherlock trembled when John stared down at him with a predatory gaze. John felt his cock throb as he looked at Sherlock. He looked like absolute sin. His hair was a mess, eyes dark with lust, a flush that started at his neck, and continued down his body, and porcelain skin covered with obscenely red and purple bruises and bite marks.
Sherlock dropped his head forwards as his cock spurted sticky fluid down the wall. He could still feel Johns thick cock pulsing inside him as they both came down from their high.
“Sugar's good for the brain, you know,” John commented idly. “How many more of those can you smoke before you collapse or something?”
'Move,' came Sherlock's grunt. So John carefully pulled out and then pressed in again, slowly and steadily, holding himself tightly at the hilt.
John sat up straighter and rubbed his face, trying to chase away the sleep clinging to his limbs. Sherlock didn't move as John stretched and looked around for his phone, before remembering it had been ruined by the storm. At least it had stopped raining.
Sherlock jumped out of the bed and moved to stand in front of John. His height made it so easy to gently cup John's chin and nudge his gaze upwards.
He always looks so studious when he does this, like it’s a complicated question on an exam, or a rubick’s cube.
John carried them through into the living room, and gently settled Sherlock on the sofa. He always dozed off straight after sex.
Sherlock still hadn't come downstairs, and Mycroft and Mrs Holmes had begun to get extremely worried. Mrs Homes had telephoned Doctor, who was currently in their parlour.
Sherlock had been prepared for another day of being ignored, that’s pretty much how every other day of his life had gone, but John ran up to greet him at the gates.
That was a mistake, because he wakes up, but he doesn’t make a fuss. Instead, he sits up just a little and wraps his arms around my neck.
Soon, she was leant back against the table with John knelt in between her legs, assaulting her kiss bruised lips, hands in her hair, on her face, her waist.
“You’re gonna need to take your pants off then.” John chuckled as he trailed his fingers down Sherlock’s body.
Donovan and Anderson made their first good decision all day. They ran away. John ran back to Sherlock's limp form, and dropped to his knees. He checked for his pulse, then to see if he was breathing. He carefully pulled Sherlock's head into his lap.
Sherlock was eventually swayed, and after dressing in pyjama shorts, followed John out in to the living room.
I do my best as he presses the cold metal of the stethoscope to my chest. I can smell his rich aftershave, along with the soft note of lingering toothpaste and his shampoo. Eucalyptus, I think.
When John went on to pull down his own underwear, Sherlock stopped his hands, and took to the task himself. He flashed John a coy, coquettish smile as he pulled the red boxers down his legs.
The pair returned to the house after finishing their tea, Sherlock’s wobbly legs struggling to keep her up.
The expression Mycroft pulled next was one that appeared almost hopeful. Sherlock couldn’t quite put her finger on it. She didn’t pay any mind to it, and went back to watching Lucy. Mycroft left shortly after Lucy woke up to feed her. She also took the gooseberries with her to give to her mother.
“John’s over the moon. One of the officers gave him a cigar to celebrate with.” She announced as she walked towards her mother.
Thank you very much for the gift. Your mother brought it over this morning. I love it. I shall never take it off. Sorry to hear about your bunk mate. Although I don’t have to worry about snoring, Mycroft’s new baby wakes me up in the middle of the night with her crying. We’re off to the post office now to have her photos done. I’ll send you one with my next letter. Wishing you the best.
Hearing him say that sends shivers down my spine as a warm, fuzzy feeling spreads through the rest of my body.
“It’ll be even hotter when I don’t have these on.” She said as she guided his hand back to the waistband of her underwear.
“I love hearing you beg.” John rumbled, Sherlock’s pleads sending waves of pleasure down to his cock.
Sherlock smiled, and nodded his head. John gave him one more kiss before jumping off the bed to rummage through Sherlock’s draws. He climbed back on to the bed with the bottle, then beckoned Sherlock to move closer to him.
I gesture to the door. He slips through with a grin on his face, and I follow close behind. I allow my eyes to drop down, scanning his form.
When John pulled away, he grabbed Sherlock under the ass, then got him to jump up, and wrap his long legs round his waist. He pushed himself between Sherlock’s legs, using his body to hold the brunette in place. He grabbed Sherlock’s arms, and pinned them above his head.
John brought his hands down to her knees, then slid them up her legs, hiking her skirt up in the process.
“I’m going to get you back for that by the way.” John chuckled mirthlessly as Sherlock stripped him of his shirt.
“I’m gonna fuck your pretty little ass so hard that you won’t be able to sit for a week.” John growled in his ear.
I feel John reach an arm up, and begin to play with my hair, gently tugging at the roots as he combs his fingers through my tresses.
“Anne, these are my children, John, and Harriet. Children, this is Mrs Holmes, and Sherlock. They live next door.”
Of course it’s true, but even if it wasn’t, I would have confessed as such just to see the smile that appears on his face.
John furrowed his brows, but he didn’t question it further. Besides, he was a little distracted by Sherlock’s attire. Tight fitting white t-shirt, cute little shorts, sexy long legs, white sneakers... John felt his cock stirring in his boxers. He snapped his eyes back up to Sherlock’s face.
Mrs Holmes appeared in the door way, eyes wide at the sight of her two teenage sons having the first physical fight they’d had since Sherlock was six years old, which ended in him being shoved in to a chest of draws after he’d whacked Mycroft with a wooden sword. Mycroft was now sprawled over the table, newspaper discarded on the floor, and sherlock, also on the floor, was covered in jam.
“I- ahem- I... like you a lot, and I just panicked. I’ve never liked a boy before, and then...” He kept his gaze fixed on Sherlock this time.
“I didn’t want to help. Feels like we’re just packing you up. Don’t really want to speed that process along.” John stated sadly. “If you wanted to go, I’d keep this to myself, but...”
Sherlock smiled softly at her, and went out to the hall. The postman was outside when she opened the door. In his hands, he carried a stack of parcels, and letters.
John walked over to the kitchen, and put the radio on while he delved around in the fridge. Sherlock cocked his head when he heard Lana Del Ray’s ‘ride’ start to play. He still remembered the first time he heard it.
“I love having you like this.” I rumble as I trace a finger down his spine, making him shiver. “My good boy.”
Rosie was the first to leave, then Irene with a cheerful departure that included a secret bet with John over whether or not she could seduce someone faster than he and Sherlock could get through dinner. In Irene’s own words, they were a ‘proper couple who did boring stuff like eat’.
“John? What is it? What’s wrong?” She asked, eyes searching his. He wasn’t looking at her though. His eyes were wide, and looking straight ahead of him.
Sherlock flashed John a grin, then got up and strode over to the door. The blond tagged along behind and followed him into the kitchen where Mrs Holmes was sat reading a book.
“Oh, shhh... shhhh... it’s ok...” She sobbed, rocking the baby in an attempt to sooth her. “Please don’t cry.”
Sherlock squeaked when John pinned him down to the mattress with his hips, attacking his lips with a fiery passion.
They walked side by side, playfully bumping each other with their shoulders. Sherlock felt all the sadness and frustration he’d felt that morning melt away. He couldn’t blame John for fucking up. They were both young, and of course they would make mistakes.
“Fuck...” He murmurs quietly, a grin playing at his lips. “You’re going to be the death of me, you are.”
Sherlock could hardly wait for school to be over. He ran over to John at the end of the day, practically clattering in to him.
“Your cock! Please, John... ah!” Sherlock yelped when he felt one of john’s fingers probing at his entrance. “Fill me- fuck me with your... ah... huge cock.”
The blond groaned in to Sherlock’s mouth, his pelvis tilting forwards to pin the slighter teen to the counter with his hips. Sherlock moved his hands up to run them through johns hair, tugging softly at the roots.
I move my hands from his shoulders round to the front of his chest. I grab a fistful of his blue shirt, and pull him closer to me. A low groan vibrates through his body.
For the first time in weeks, Sherlock wasn’t woken by the screams of her baby. It was still screaming, but it was her mother... and rather than screams of hunger, they were the jovial kind.
“Letter for you darling.” Her mother said enthusiastically, practically thrusting the letter out to her. They all found themselves staring at her as she took it with a shaky hand. She sliced it open with an overgrown nail, and took out the carefully folded paper. She instantly recognised the hand writing as John’s.
Sherlock let out a loud whine as he took more of Johns shaft. He liked fucking in this position. From this angle, John could hit all those sweet spots inside him. Sherlock began slowly rocking his hips, emitting groans from both of them.
He looks hesitant for a moment, then he leans down to kiss me, partly to distract me as he pushes his hips forwards again.
I state to Adler that I’m going to check on the toiletry supplies, and allow myself to follow Sherlock.
Sherlock left for her room, and wrote out her letter, all the while contemplating her sister’s odd behaviour.
Yes, I am fully aware that signing up wasn’t compulsory until 1916, but John has to go unwillingly in 1914 for my story to work! Did I change history for a story plot? Yes, yes I did.
“Sometimes I think I have you figured out... then you say stuff like that and I’m right back to square one.” He pants before smashing our lips together again.
It’s a tedious day at work, and it only gets better when I get asked to cover a shift after Adler calls in sick, meaning Sherlock will get in before me, and might start learning the banjo.
“Oh shit. Well, this is what you get for what happened last year.” John said as he bent his head to take a closer look.
Sherlock turned to face him again. He was regarding Sherlock with kind eyes, his expression somewhat comforting.
Their walk was over too fast for Sherlock. To be fair, eternity would have been the only span of time she would have been happy with.
The boys finished off lunch, then went back upstairs to watch more videos. They got quite loud with their laughter, which resulted in Mycroft, who’s room was next door, banging on the wall for them to shut up. On one occasion, he’d come into the room, and ordered them to ‘cease the ruckus’, or he’d tell on them to their mother. This resulted in Sherlock giving him the finger, and the older teen slamming the door in despair, muttering to himself about how younger brothers were surly minions of Satan himself. This of course only made the boys laugh more. It seemed sherlock’s favourite thing to do, bedsides freaking people out with his deductions, was pissing of his brother. The older boy had eventually given up, and gone to the library to escape the shrill giggles of john and Sherlock. At 16:00, John had to go home to get ready for football. It was fair to say John was off his game, his mind completely occupied by thoughts of the dark haired boy, with his mystical eyes, sharp cheekbones, and why he made John feel all giddy.
“Fuck, what the hell is she doing back?” John groaned. He sat back up, and ran a hand through his hair.
He stretched his arms up to stretch out his muscles, making sure to groan loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
It was true, Sherlock didn’t want the jam. But it was no longer a container of preserved fruits. It was now a means with which to torture his brother.
I open my mouth to say something, but nothing comes out. This has never happened to me before, lord knows I always have something to say, and yet here I am, speechless. He’s running his eyes over me when I manage to collect my brain cells, his lip drawn between his teeth in a crooked grin.
Drip. Drip. Drip. Rain stormed down outside, teaming and torrenting. Sherlock had stopped crying days ago. She’d run out of tears. That first night, she stayed slumped against her door all night, eventually drifting off into a fitful sleep. She left her room on occasion to eat and drink, but she didn’t say a word to anyone. The whole world was passing by, people talking, going to work, just going about their lives, and it didn’t mean a thing to her. The only thing that mattered was John. She remembered the last letter she sent to him.
“Young lady? Are you to be travelling with the party?” A blonde woman in a skirt suit asked. She was surrounded by a group of girls and an assortment of parents, friends and siblings.
It’s not that I don’t want this, it’s just that it will be weird and uncomfortable to have johns fingers inside of me.
How would he tell him? How would he confess his love? John shook his head as he walked side by side with the younger boy on the way back. He knew he’d end up saying something stupid, he knew he would. He wouldn’t say anything for now. He’d keep his mouth shut, and come up with a solid plan.
Sherlock paused for a moment, wondering why johns facial expression implied that his request was not a reasonable one.
We haven’t had a moment alone since I came back. Well, not one that didn’t comprise of me crying and throwing up in to a bucket.
As the autumn breeze swept through the garden, Sherlock leant back against johns side for warmth, and thanked all the deities she didn’t believe in for the life she’d made for herself.
John wasn’t convinced, the dread that he was going to hurt her both restraining him and helping to keep him grounded.
John paused before leaving the room as the fact that Sherlock still had a plug inside him came to mind. John grinned to himself as he switched it on again.
Sherlock, like with every aspect of relevance, had studied up on what to expect. Over the last few days, he’d even been regulating when he ate on the days he went to see John, just in case events were to present themselves.
I don’t say anything in case the tears that are welling behind my eyes break through my walls, and come flooding out.
“Her water broke and the contractions got worse. My mother is telephoning the doctor from my fathers study.”
The seconds they waited while the phone rang went by tantalisingly slow. But then, someone answered. The Field Marshal. He listened patiently to Mrs Watson, then went off in search of John.
He thought he’d pass out as the intense euphoric feeling spread through out his body. John was now squirting chocolate sauce along his hipbones. It was too much, too much teasing, too much pleasure, too much-
Sherlock tilted his head again, kinda like a puppy, and batted his long eye lashes at John, clearly trying to figure out what John meant by that.
John paused for a moment. The brilliant boy before him had such doubt about himself that he wasn’t sure any of this had really happened.
“Of course. I was testing the burning rates of different biscuits to record their fat content. I’d like to hear his thoughts.”
“Please what, darling?” He applied a generous amount of lube to his fingers. “What is it that you want?” He cooed, placing his lips on Sherlock’s ear, tugging and biting at the lobe.
He wasn’t angry with her because of the secret, he was angry at himself for the secret even existing in the first place.
We are to have a good close here. For once, the fires were not started by me. Mother got carried away with the brandy, and the Christmas pudding got out of hand. Your parents and sister are here too. Your mother is rather tipsy, and is singing Christmas carols very out of tune. Our fathers seem to be enjoying the duty of ‘home guard’. I dare say it is not nearly as strenuous as your endeavours. We’re all thinking of you. I miss you.
Normally he’d scold Sherlock for being demanding, but he was so desperate, so horny, he couldn’t hold off any longer. If Sherlock was ready, there was nothing stopping him. He picked up his pace, thrusting deeper and harder in to Sherlock’s channel.
She paused after a moment, and brought her hands up to his shoulders. She broke away from the kiss to bring her lips down to his neck, sucking sharply on the skin.
“If one was to tear a hole in a net, there would be fewer holes. Im sure the same principle applies to tea strainers.” She stated, not really aiming this fact at John.
“Yes, I would have preferred a dog to a sister. Or a cat. Or a goldfish.” Mycroft grumbled, narrowing her eyes at the younger child.
It’s not long before John is stationed back in the guard bubble, but this time he has the shift between 05:00 and 13:00.
I nod, then practically scuttle back to the dorm. I get dressed in my cube, preserving my modesty as best I can by awkwardly holding my towel as I hop in to my pants.
I can feel how much my cock is leaking as beads of fluid trickle down my shaft and on to my stomach.
He could feel the subtle vibrations in his body, but obviously not us much as John who’s eyes had rolled in to the back of his head as a low moan escaped him.
John nodded but didn’t say anything. It seemed that the initial ‘excitement’ of coming home had warn off, and the realisation of what had happened to him was hitting him full force. She cleared her thoughts, and peeled back the patch on johns shoulder to reveal a substantial flesh wound that she guessed was about two weeks old. John winced, and she apologised. That pattern repeated as she finished dressing the wound. When she was done, she moved on to a few other nicks and cuts.
John threw his head forward as his cock spasmed, streams of hot, white fluid shooting from the end, on to the bed sheets and Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock grinned as he watched John orgasm in front of him. He’d done that. He’d been the cause of it. He’d made John feel so good.
“Right, you two are going to need to keep on either side of me. Any funny business, and you’re both getting shots. Have I made myself clear?”
She shuffled about beneath him and gripped his shoulders tightly as he started to move his hips in a steady rhythm.
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock has very little opinion when it came to those questions, but he was more than happy to listen to me when I voiced mine.
Sherlock turned around at that, a smirk playing at his lips. He continued to sway his hips while he ran his hands down his sides.
She didn’t realise she’d been crying until she pulled back and saw that John’s shirt collar was wet.
“Right, I’ll volunteer you, and when you kick up a fuss, I’ll be a bit more firm.” He says, putting an unmissable stress on the word firm.
I remain in the room for a moment whilst I calm myself down, adjust my shirt so the hickeys are covered, then leave down the hall in the opposite direction to John.
“Are you sure the others aren’t going to walk in- mmm!” Sherlock trailed off when he felt John run his finger over his slit, his fingers digging in to the work surface.
“I’ve had seven orgasms in the past two hours. I’m so- uncomfortable- mmmnngghh!” He sobbed. “And in a decent amount of paaaainnnn- ah!”
Sherlock looked eyes with John, blue orbs wide. John darted his tongue out to lick his lips, then grinned.
Just because Sherlock isn’t attune to human nature, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to play hard to get.
The blond raised his head at then mention of his name, and smiled weakly at Sherlock. When Sherlock looked back at Mrs Watson, she had snapped out of her daze, and was looking at both of her children.
Instead she crossed the room, and flung her arms around his neck, holding him so tightly that maybe... just maybe... she wouldn’t have to let go.
“Eat what you can dear. Your mother is staying next door for dinner, and your sister took the baby out, but I’ll come and sit with you.”
"Under my plate. See, I've finished. You on the other hand haven't moved in about ten minutes." John quipped, gesturing to Sherlock's plate, waffles untouched.
John was always calm, even when they argued, but the hysterical tone of his voice made Sherlock look up. John's eyes were wild and his hand was beginning to shake.
'Tell me, did you plan this from the beginning? Did you get us kicked out of the hotel on purpose, just so you could play campers?'
“That's bullshit. You obviously cared about him,” John went on. “Enough to not tell me about him, at least. Why didn't you?”
He could distantly feel Sherlock letting out a measured breath as he pushed in, but everything was secondary to that impossible heat, tight and pulsating all around him as Sherlock willed himself to relax. He gripped Sherlock's hips tightly and pressed on, stopping when he felt like he could come at any moment. When the roar in his ears subsided, John heard Sherlock's sharp panting.
Sherlock, for his part, was following John for once in his life, occasionally uttering some sort of accusation.
Sherlock broke their kiss for air and John let out a small chuckle. His anger had dissolved into that kiss, transfigured into hot desire. The detective smiled, kissing John's nose, his brow, the shell of his ear, then moving lower down his jaw and neck, pausing to nibble at his pulse point. John closed his eyes, exposing more of himself for Sherlock's agile mouth.
After a few hours spent on Tumblr he felt he understood what was happening with their public lives a bit better. He certainly got why Sherlock was so obsessed with it all, it was obvious that many people put a lot of time and effort into
He typed something in the search bar and the page was instantly filled with pictures of them. Some he recognized from the papers, others he was sure had been taken without their permission. Others he knew for a fact could not have been real.
'The soles of quality high heels are better than those of certain brands of trainers, including yours,' Sherlock deadpanned.
“Start slow, it's been a while,” Sherlock instructed, and John was glad to have the feedback. His voice was low and rough and John's neglected cock twitched at the sound of it. John circled Sherlock's entrance with his index finger before slowly pushing in. He felt the muscle give and, at Sherlock's sigh, he started moving in and out.
He pulled the blue dressing gown around him and walked over the coffee table to open the door. He was almost vibrating with excitement.
'You know, this is sort of brilliant, actually,' John said when they stopped to drink from a gill. 'This whole being lost thing, it's pretty fun.'
Sherlock smiled and got up, closed the distance between him and John with two long strides, and held out his hand.
'Oh, so we were safe all along, but not really, is that it?' It was John's turn to cross his arms, looking frighteningly like Mrs. Hudson whenever he shot the wall.
John opened the tent and stood glaring at the shivering man. He looked even more soaked than before, and oddly fragile. Something in John broke a little at the sight.
Sherlock maneuvered them back to the bed, all the while nibbling at John's lips. He seemed physically unable to separate his mouth from a piece of John, not even long enough to remove their shirts.
John shook his head and sat heavily on the edge of his bed. He'd got used to Sherlock springing deductions on him, but that didn't ease the sting of it when they hit this close to home. “She had a breakdown at Christmas,” John began, “but we kept hoping she would get better. We took her to rehab yesterday, and I couldn't bear to say at home one more day and watch mum-” John choked on his words and his throat constricted painfully.
'I always put it somewhere I can reach quickly,' John said, a little out of breath, and Sherlock felt a wave of pride for his soldier.
Sherlock said nothing, but smiled warmly, one of his genuine smiles which made John's heart swell. He wished he'd brought a camera.
“I sometimes have nightmares,” John offered. At Sherlock's questioning brow, he added, “Since we're gonna be living together, I thought, you know, we should know the worst about each-other."
Sherlock looked at the offered hand curiously, but hesitated to take it. Instead, he cocked his head to the side and tried to deduce what this strange woman wanted from him. Oddly, it didn't seem to make her uncomfortable like it did most people, quite the contrary. She held herself still with barely-contained delight and smiled openly.
It's been three years since Sherlock jumped from the roof of St. Bart's. Three years since the world's greatest fraud took a cowardly leap instead of facing up to the consequences of his lies. Three years since the papers had been filled with stories on Sherlock Holmes, the psychopath, the mass-murderer who set up crime scenes only to have the pleasure of taking them apart in front of the authorities.
“You were right,” John began, clearing his throat and still addressing Sherlock's lips. “You were right about me not knowing, but once I looked, I saw. No, I observed! You wouldn't tell me about you being gay, or about Victor, not because you thought I would judge you. Or that wasn't the only reason. The truth is, Sherlock, that all this time, ever since I came to live here, you've been staring at me all the time.
'What did you just say?!' John had to strain his neck to glare at Sherlock, but it didn't make him any less menacing. 'You are not blaming this on me, you git! If you were able to act like a normal person once in a while, my life would be so much easier!'
Sherlock could feel his own orgasm building up rapidly, John's sharp thrusts proving to be surprisingly accurate. As John tweaked one of his nipples, he sneaked a hand between them to fist at his neglected erection and clenched his muscles around John. The other man gave a surprised shout and his thrusts became more erratic as Sherlock got closer and closer to the edge.
She turned to John, who nodded numbly. He recalled an argument about tobacco ash and deerstalkers and smiled fondly at the memory.
John realised he'd actually said that out loud when Sherlock's head raised suddenly and his mouth fell open in a perfect heart shape. John couldn't look away, wouldn't look away from the dusty pink lips, and wow, when had he become such a girl? He didn't care, really, because Sherlock's tongue peaked out to wet his lips and he was gone.
Slowly, Sherlock started to meet his thrusts, rolling his hips and seeking that sizzling pleasure that John's fingers had given him. Chuckling softly. John smoothed his hand down Sherlock's spine, from his shoulder blades to the hollow above his tailbone. Then, bracing his good arm next to Sherlock's head, John bent down to trace his tongue up, over every vertebrae, stopping to nibble just below the hairline. John felt Sherlock's shiver rock through both of them and his hips snapped forward sharper than he'd intended.
Licking his lips, John brushes the backs of his fingers down the cotton-covered length. He turns his hand, strokes with just the tips of his thumb and first two fingers. Sherlock feels the dual sensation of friction from the fabric and the slick slide of his foreskin underneath. It's maddening.
John reached down between them, fingers skidding over sweat-damp skin. Sherlock sucked in a breath, tensed his stomach in anticipation. With a smile, John let his fingers dance along the edge of Sherlock’s pubic hair—teasing at the trimmed bush. He slipped his hand down the crease of pelvis and thigh and squeezed the tendon. Then trailed back up to the divot of his navel, just above the wet tip of Sherlock’s hard prick.
“I didn't have that much patience at fourteen.” John’s fingers had turned purposeful, slipping buttons open down the front of Sherlock’s shirt.
His eyes drift down to watch the steady rocking of our bodies. He sucks his luscious bottom lip between his teeth and begins to huff short breaths from his nose.
John was every bit as beautiful as Sherlock had imagined: sitting up against the headboard, flushed cock in hand, eyes ember-bright with want. His face and chest were flushed, his nipples peaked into rosy buds. He shifted, widened his legs and tilted his cock forward in offering.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock sighed. He stretched out luxuriously, body rolling and shifting, and clenched around the fat tip.
The femoral vein sat slightly too far back and a bit too deep—the position would be awkward. The great saphenous vein, though. That snaking blue ribbon was perfect.
“Touch me.” John pleaded. “I know. I know it's wrong of me to ask. But I. . . I need it. Oh, Christ.
Sherlock smirked and brought his hand down to his prick. He curled his fingers around the flushed shaft and gave himself a firm squeeze. Focusing the camera, he made sure the picture caught the glint of precome welling at his slit.
.” John groaned. His cock flexed and the rod slipped in another fraction of an inch. “Oh! Christing fuck!”
“I told you I had a surprise ready.” Lips brushed across Sherlock’s shoulder blade. “Now stand right here and close your eyes.”
John glanced at him, harrumphed, and looked back out the window. Sherlock scooted closer, pressed himself against John's side. He dropped his head to John’s shoulder and slipped his hand over John’s thigh. He squeezed, released. Squeezed, released.
“Let me help you clean that up.” Sherlock swiped a bit up and offered it to John, rubbing it across his bottom lip until he sucked the finger into his mouth.
He presses his hips down and the silky hot slide of his cock against mine is electrifying. I groan, a deep and needy sound, and wrap my arms around him. God it feels so good to be under him like this, while he ruts against me, and pants into my ear. He’s always enthusiastic about sex, but never so aggressive. I could get used to this.
Sherlock swallowed against a sudden thickness in his throat. His pulse tripped and quickened. "John, I–"
He went to the bedroom, dropping his dressing gown, pajama bottoms, and t-shirt along the way—a suggestive trail of breadcrumbs for John to follow upon his return. From the bedside table he’d pulled out a large, flat, velvet box—the sort that might hold a bejeweled necklace. But instead of diamonds or pearls or rubies, it contained a headband. It was black satin, smooth and lustrous, and perched at the top were two soft, pointed ears.
There must be something in my tone that conveys my sheer desperation, because he doesn't hesitant to withdraw his fingers and move around the mattress. He settles back and looks up at me with a kind of curious expectancy.
The wet staccato of John’s strokes was torturous, bringing visions of small, capable hands wrapped around a ruddy, wet glans. The glide of pinked foreskin over a fat, flaring crown. Sherlock could only whimper.
So I slip the head of his cock between my lips and slide down. I take my time, slowly bobbing, letting the tight seal of my lips ride back and forth over the flaring crown. Then a little more and a little more. His fingers are loosely tunneled into my curls, not demanding even as they twitch and tug. I look up at him, at the camera, with half his cock down my throat, and I plead—a plaintiff keen high in my chest.
There’s a coil of pleasure wrapping tight around the root of my cock, pulsing liquid heat and pleasure through my core. Filling me. Filling me.
. His fingers dug into the flesh of Sherlock's arse, pulled him down roughly even as his hips kicked up harder.
John, still kneading on the lino next to the body, shot Lestrade a glare that screamed ‘the fuck, mate?’.
John stares at me for a moment, as if considering whether or not he wants to go through with this, then his left hand slides off the table. He places it on the top of his thigh, takes a breath, and drifts it until his palm is settled in the cradle of his lap.
He doesn’t hesitate this time, instead running his hand slowly over the shaft. A more defined bulge is starting to form behind the slick, silver fabric and he lengthens his strokes.
He shifts down, mouthing just under my jaw. His teeth scrape along my throat and I gasp, turn my head, whisper, “God yes.”
His hands come up to my hips, his palms smoothing over my arse as I rock him in and out of my body. He starts to move, catching my rhythm and spiking up in time. The tempo quickly gets away from us. Faster and faster still, until our kisses turn into the blur of mouths and exchange of panting breaths.
But even the frantic, lust-addled press of their mouths was not enough to distract John Watson once he’d set his mind to something, and Sherlock quickly felt the questing tip of two slicked fingers. He moaned into John’s mouth, a low rumble of
“Good boy,” John murmured. He ran his hand, a slick, tight circle, along Sherlock’s length. “Now. Fuck my fist.”
“Good kitties don't touch themselves.” He’d said as he peeled off Sherlock’s clothes and gave his half-hard prick a stroke. “Show me you can be a good kitty and I’ll pet you.”
John shuddered, his eyes fluttering closed. He brought the hand under his head down to encircle Sherlock’s wrist and pull him back. “Jesus.” He was breathless. Delectable. “I thought you said you weren't going to enthrall me.”
Sherlock spun out of the room, coattails billowing behind him, John and Lestrade close on his heels.
Sherlock nods, unable to form even the simplest words at the moment. Maybe he pulls back, maybe John pushes him. Either way, they tumble onto the bed, with John on top.
He rubs his thumb and index finger just behind the head and I can see the outline of the flaring crest perfectly. Absolutely delectable. I wish is could slide under his table and swallow him down. But that may be just a tad too conspicuous.
“It’s obvious. The location of the body, the bruising. She did her best to hide the evidence, but in her duress she failed to do up his flies properly and completely missed the open bottle of lubricant just behind the door. Embarrassment may explain tidying up, but not lying to the police. She knew it needed to look like a murder to ensure she could collect the life insurance. With a baby on the way and a fair amount of debt from recent remodeling, she’ll certainly be needing that money.”
Under his trousers, Sherlock was wearing cotton briefs, where a small damp patch was forming over the crotch.
For someone with, from what I’ve gathered, no experience, he’s not too bad in the kissing department.
Sherlock looked over to the cup beside her. It was the third she’d drunk that day. She looked back to Mrs Hudson with puppy dog eyes.
John held Sherlock by the waist as he slowly dismounted him. Sherlock fell back down within seconds, completely exhausted.
Sherlock giggled, and nestled his head in johns chest. Most of his semen had gone on the sheets, his thighs, or johns hand.
I keep kissing him as I move my hand up his thigh, and gingerly allow my fingers to touch his length. His breath hitches and his body twitches underneath me.
I can’t stop myself from desperately rutting against him, so instead I turn the tables on him, and move my hands down to unbuckle his trousers.
“Are you ok?” John asked after a moment, the sudden reminder that Sherlock was in pain for the majority of the encounter.
Whenever I caught his eye, his cheeks would flush, and he’d offer me a coquettish smile before ducking his head.
When they got home, John went straight to the fridge, and Sherlock went into their room. He decided to curl up with a book as he waited for John to return. He read for a little while before he heard footsteps and the door close.
John couldn’t help it as his hips began bucking up to meet Sherlock’s, thrusting his clothed cock between Sherlock’s thighs.
I try and keep the hope out of my voice, not only so they don’t get suspicious, but so as not to make myself any promises.
He shoved a fist in to his mouth to silence himself as he reached his climax, the fact that the floor would need therapy and a good once over with a mop completely forgotten as waves of pleasure hit him. Sherlock on the other hand let out a loud, lust filled cry as he came.
Before I would falter, but now I find myself reaching down between us to rub my hand over his bulge.
“I just meant that you’re not going to ditch me for some girl. Or boy. I don’t really have any other friends.”
Sherlock looked down at John, who had curled in on himself, his normal broad shoulders slouched, making him appear smaller than he was.
“My apologies.” John chuckled. “My love, would you do me the honour of accompanying me to the pictures this fine evening?”
They settled on watching rupauls drag race, although Sherlock had little opinion on the choice of show.
“I like this skirt. Makes you look very sexy.”  He cooed, sliding his hand up Sherlock’s thigh. He was surprised when his hand came into contact with bare skin.
“He doesn’t know I’m his mother. I’m just his feeding station.” Sherlock retaliated, cocking her head in a challenging manner.
John followed mike over to grab a drink when he caught a glimpse of something dark out of the corner of his eye.
“Yes, well I bought it before I got pregnant, then it didn’t fit me, and now everything I wear gets spit up on it, so...”
I wait in bed, still wearing my shoes so that I can sneak away as soon as I’m sure everyone is asleep.
Sherlock dunked his head under the water for a moment, his dark locks pooling at the top of the surface like a cloud of smoke. When he came back up, his fringe was dropping over his eyes. He huffed at the offending prices of hair, but to now avail.
When I pull out, what looks like a river of cum spills out of him and trickles on to the cushions. I quickly check him for bleeding. His rim is smarting and looks very sore, but he’s not bleeding.
Sherlock wasn’t sure how long she’d been screaming. She wasn’t sure she was still screaming. She couldn’t hear her own voice anymore.
“Sherlock, I’m not a sailor-“ John exclaimed as he tried to stop Sherlock from kicking him. “I am your loving boyfriend who doesn’t want you to get into bed with your shoes on.”
He’s been quiet for a while. I would have almost forgotten that he was here if it wasn’t for the gentle grazing of his calloused fingertips across my knuckles.
At 13, Sherlock was allowed out and about on her own for a short time, and longer if John went with her. John was nearly an adult, and had been allowed to take her down into London to the natural history museum for her birthday. John had never seen her so happy, running from display cabinets, dragging him along to look with her. The events of New Years had been dusted under the rug, and neither of them ever mentioned it. It was probably for the best.
There was a swing set at the end of the garden, a sword, a model train, and two pairs of wellington boots outside the shed.
John didn’t answer due to the last mouthful of muffin, so he gave her the finger instead. He put on his shoes, grabbed his phone, and hurried out the door before Harriet could ask anymore questions.
I’m soft and gentle with him, carefully stretching him, showering him with kisses when I push inside him, telling how much I love him as I thrust in to him.
“Hello, I’m Anne Holmes, I live next door. I thought I’d come by to welcome the Watsons to the neighbourhood.”
“Oh, it’s the old break room. We stopped using it after the heating in there went bust, it was cheeper to convert the printing room than fix it. You know this place; cut all the corners!”
He groans out my name as he shoots his load all over his stomach, coating his creamy white flesh in his release.
Sherlock followed her finger as she pointed over to the blond who was currently running to the other side of the pitch, and scoring the winning touchdown.
Sherlock didn't hear the rest of what she said. He stayed in trance through out school, only leaving it to shout at the English substitute teacher, and make her cry. His head was still in the clouds on the way home.
We all nod, and march off to our assigned posts. ‘The bubble’ is a room with a glass window from where a CO watches the inmates in their dorm. From what Rosie has said, it’s a lot of sitting down, but it’s up to you to stop any confrontation, and if anything happens, you are responsible, and only you. Before we all go our separate ways, Rosie hands me an energy bar and a crossword.
Sherlock squealed when John suddenly  pulled him up, and carried him in to the bedroom. He lay him on the bed, and practically pounced on the lanky teen. They joined their lips in a passionate, sticky kiss; teeth knocking together, tongues fighting for dominance.
I take fast showers, and I’ve learnt to like oatmeal. Killing a man isn’t exactly the next step. No, I believe that’s developing an obsession for reality television.
Two hours later, Sherlock had been dressed in nine different outfits, and had three different make up looks put on him. He now stood before the mirror in a high waisted, maroon skirt, a cream jumper, and thigh high socks matched with his converse. The make up was minimal, some neutral eyeshadows with a hint of gold eyeliner in his waterline, and a tinted lipgloss.
Sherlock gathered his things, then grabbed Johns hand, and the pair left their flat. Sherlock was a little nervous. Although he’d never cared what people thought of him, he didn’t enjoy getting bullied. It hadn’t happened so much here, but he guessed that was partly because he was always with John. John was a rugby player who, despite also being a medical student, was still somewhat of a bad boy. If anyone ever said anything to them while out about them holding hands or something, John would make them sorry they existed. He squeezed Johns hand as they walked, a squeeze john happily returned.
I mean of course I would do that, but then I would have to worry about favouritism... wait, why is she doing it?
Three hours later, the final class before break, and Sherlock was sat on the floor of the sports hall, waiting for the game of dodge ball from which he’d been eliminated to finish. He hated being in here. Everyone was an absolute meat head. They were always meatheads, but the locker room atmosphere made it worse. The P.E. teacher also added to his hatred. He was the epitome of creepy, the typical cliche of P.E. teachers, where you’re not sure if they want to eat you or fuck you. Sherlock knew exactly what this teacher wanted to do to him, and it terrified him.
He bobbed his head, and went off in search of the curly haired terror. He paused to look over the crowd of mourners.
He buried his face in her neck, and let the tears flow freely. Sherlock put her hand on the back of his neck, and the other on his shoulder.
Whilst she was flustered by the screaming baby, sherlock was able to remove the top of her night dress and managed to get the small infant to latch on and begin to nurse.
John laughed, which in turn made sherlock laugh. Sherlock never made anyone laugh, besides Molly, and that didn’t count. People laughed at him, but never with him. John was well and truly impressed by the taller boy, but made sure not to show this on his face. The ‘incredible’ he’d blurted out earlier clearly a fail. Sherlock was chuffed to have astounded the new kid. He enjoyed the look of amazement on his face. Their teacher walked into the room a few moments later. He was a tall chap in his mid 20s. He was a nice guy, with endless patience for Sherlock’s bullshit. He knew the teen thought he was more clever than he was, and took any opportunity to prove it. More children pulled into the class room, a few girls all casting a glance to John, then giggling to each other. Sherlock was used to these sorts of glances. Many girls, not just Molly, were nursing a crush on him. Molly was just the only one who actually talked to him instead of just gawking at him from afar. Sherlock felt something a normal person would call jealousy. But Sherlock didn’t get jealous. Mr Lestrade taut them about the reactivity series, and had them do some experiments with sulphuric acid. John attempted to make small talk with Sherlock, which the later did his best to engage in. Class finally ended, the bell sounded, and all the students filtered out, except John and Sherlock. They walked together out to the school gates, then went their separate ways. John was stopped by a few other kids wanting to investigate the new boy, and a few who remembered him from before. He went to leave when a dark haired girl went up to him.
“Ugh. Babe, take the flavour out of my mouth.” He chuckled, pulling an also gagging Sherlock to him by his shirt.
He bucks his hips again, and this time it’s not terrible. It’s not painful, more uncomfortable, like a pressure low in my abdomen and at the base of my spine.
“Fine, but if you break your promise, I’ll be very disappointed.” Sherlock mumbled, trying to push her curly, black mane behind her ears.
John chuckled despite himself, and held Sherlock tighter. He lay like that, just stroking Sherlock’s hair as he finished his milk, his arm going numb by the time Sherlock finally fell asleep.
“I have read this nine times since I was imprisoned, please take it and pray that I never have to lay eyes upon it again.”
Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head, occasionally swiping across the slit. Sherlock swallowed around him, making him yelp. Sherlock gasped through his mouthful when he felt johns hand at the back of his head. He looked up, and saw John’s eyes squeezed shut in pleasure. He loved pleasuring John, listening to him moan, watching him cum. Sherlock did his best not to gag when John’s hips bucked forwards, ramming his cock down his throat.
"I've wanted to hit you for so long. For all the times you've made me feel stupid!" Anderson yelled.
As much as I want to leave him relaxed and docile, I only have half an hour before my shift starts, and the last thing I want to do is leave him to wake up alone.
“Yes. I do wish she’d shut up sometimes though. Talks about nothing all the time.” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes.
Mrs Watson knocked on the door after a moment drawing their attention. In her arms, she carried bed linens.
“Sherlock, I was thinking of taking Lucy down to the post office to have her photos done so I can send them to Greg. Would you like to post a thank you letter to John?” Mycorft asked as she made her way over to Sherlock.
“Can I take your trousers off?” He asks after a moment, already slipping his hand down between my trousers and briefs.
Thank you so much for the comments and suggestions! Hope you enjoy this, smut in the next chapter... and their ‘first time’ at some point... 😆
The Hokey Cokey came on, and the couples all joined into a circle. Mrs Holmes had sat out to watch her children, and was surprised to find that she’d never seen either of her daughters look so happy. After a short break, the music picked up again, but a slow song this time.
He’s in his bunk, book on the pillow, his long fingers splayed out over the pages, the digits on his other hand fisted in his dark hair.
He sent a text to Sherlock asking to meet him tomorrow before school, to which the brunette replied eagerly. Maybe seeing Sherlock would take his mind off things, even if he didn’t want to discuss those things. John flopped down on his bed, face first in an attempt of being as despondent as possible.
John was used to getting changed in front of other boys as he was on the football team, but this was Sherlock. It was different. He pulled off his own shirt somewhat tentatively, his well toned torso now in plain view. Sherlock watched John out of the corner of his eye as he slipped into the white sleep shirt. He was gorgeous underneath his shirt, just as Sherlock had imagined. He pushed the dream out of his head, and changed into his pyjama bottoms. He was completely unaware that johns eyes were glued to his lanky form. John had to be a bit more tactful when changing, and turned away from Sherlock as he slid off his trousers, and pulled on the loaned pyjama bottoms. They were too long, like the shirt, and hung off his limbs like clothes on a washing line.
John mouthed at the bud, hard under his touch. He trailed kisses all the way down Sherlock’s lean torso, pausing to bite and suck along the way.
If I’m misreading this, and she is just interested in being friends, then I go and say something stupid, I’ll come off as the biggest jerk who thinks every woman wants to sleep with him.
Sherlock groggily opened his eyes. John was leant against the door frame smirking at him, towel around his waist, his skin wet and glistening.
The blue eyed boy looked down at his companion, eyebrows raised. John still wanted to hang out with him.
Although our moments have gradually been increasing in their magnitude, they have yet to return to the extremity of that moment in the guard bubble, lack of opportunity and all that.
Once my eyes have fully adjusted, I realise that Moriarty is now pinned to the bookcase, and the person pinning him is John.
Sherlock felt his mouth watering when John returned. John squirted some whipped cream on to a strawberry, then held it out for Sherlock. The brunette made sure to hold eye contact with John as he darted his tongue out to lick the cream off the top before taking the whole fruit in to his mouth. John groaned low in his throat as Sherlock licked his fingers. He had cream at the corners of his mouth that were just too tempting. He captured Sherlock’s jaw in his hand, and tilted his head up.
Sherlock jumped up from the bed to get dressed, settling on a pair of jeans and one of Johns hoodies. John slipped the remote in to his pocket, and the pair excited the room.
It’s hot and passionate as he darts his tongue in to my mouth and slips his fingers in to the waistband of my underwear.
Short chapter, but I have a saucy chapter planned. Comment if you’d like me to publish it tonight :)
He put the remainder of the cube that was in his hand back in the tray, and set them down on the bedside table.
It was a dreary Sunday. The sun was blocked by the clouds, and there was a chill in the air. Sherlock had chosen to stay indoors, and was sat in the parlour knitting a scarf to send to John.
Although Sherlock was shy, and bashful, he spoke his mind, and asked for what he wanted. Said boy was staring up at John with wide eyes, lips parted, and chest heaving.
Dr Hooper turns her head over her shoulder to indicate to a young man with a black eye, holding an ice pack to the wound.
He was rock hard, but his own needs had been pushed right to the bottom of his priorities, mush more enthused about Sherlock’s pleasure.
John came home that afternoon. Sherlock spotted him out the window, and after waiting the two hours her mother instructed be left for them to settle down, she ran out to knock for him. She hadn’t gone through the hole in the fence for a good few months, and hadn’t taken into account her new shape. Then young girl found herself struggling to slip through, the new additions to her chest getting in the way. It had always been a small gap, and John had failed to fit through for years, but it was still a great surprise to Sherlock. In her distress, she’d managed to catch her blouse on a bramble behind her, and was now well and truly stuck. John had spotted the struggling preteen, and run out to help her.
John was trying his best to focus on her, but it felt so, so good that her voice was more like an echo in the background.
John did his best to maintain his composure, but the eager teen to his left was making it very difficult indeed.
When he pulls back to look me in the eye, his are predatory, lit with a fire I’m afraid will burn me alive if I’m not careful.
Sherlock blushed and nodded his head. It hadn’t been an easy road for John and Sherlock. For starters, Sherlock had no idea John was coming on to him.
She excepted johns hand, and allowed him to lead her over to the dance floor. The pianist began to play.
He deposited the gag in the basket along with strawberry lube. That was Sherlock’s favourite. Said boy had currently wandered off, and was seemingly transfixed by a display of animal ears.
Sherlock couldn’t help but marvel at John’s poker face. His face was relaxed, and his body was completely still.
Sherlock’s giggle turned in to a soft moan as John came to stand behind him, pressing up against him.
I manage to get through the mundanity that is lunch, desperate to keep the ever persistent grin off my face.
“It’s alright. I’m fully aware of the rage I cause in others.” He chides himself lightheartedly, but there’s some sadness in it too.
“Oh that’s not cliche at all.” She mumbled as she indignantly shoved a whole teacake in to her mouth.
Sherlock couldn’t help his eyes from closing as a noise between a sob and a moan wracked his body. John pulled back to allow sherlock to rearrange himself, watching intently as the brunette coyly turned around, sure to wiggle his ass as he did. John licked his lips and lightly smacked Sherlock across his ass.
Sherlock brought his hands down to the knot that was keeping his towel seated on his hips. He slowly undid it, and let the damp, white garment drop to the floor. John raised his eyebrows at the sight before him. Sherlock’s cock was completely bare, not a dark curl in sight.
John pulled his fingers out and fumbled for a moment as he tried to position himself. Sherlock shifted up, giving John room to take himself in hand—to rub the tip of his cock indecently from taint to tailbone before finding the readied divot of Sherlock's entrance.
Sherlock pulled off groaning, “John.” His thirst may have been satiated, but a different hunger grew. “John, I—”
“Sher—” John moaned, high and needy. “Touch me. Stroke me—Ahh. Light and fast. Keep. Oh, God. Keep fucking me.”
“Sherlock. . .” he whines. It’s an exquisite sound, pure and fine and unwittingly revealing—like dust on a mantle. It tells me everything I want to know.
His eyes are also different. Still a kaleidoscope of blues, but darker, deeper. They move with intent from Sherlock's face, down his body, and back up. And as cliché as it sounds, Sherlock swears he can feel it—like a warm caress against his bare skin.
“Common enough.” John said with a chuckle. A flush tinted his cheeks and the tips of his ears. “I used an aubergine once on a bet.”
“You can and you will, provided you want to me to suck you off. You do want that, don’t you, John? To pump a hot load straight down my throat?”
Knowing that he'd been caught out should have been embarrassing in the extreme. But. It wasn't. To know that there was a voyeur, however unintentional, to this facet of his life was actually. . . a bit titillating. He'd been on display, vulnerable to anybody observant enough to notice. Perhaps it wasn't the humiliation itself, but the threat of it that Sherlock found so intriguing.
“Oh God, baby,” John says, breath hot against the nape of my neck. His hand slips over my hip, up the swell of my belly and cups gently around my breast. “Christ your tits are huge.”
Suddenly he pulls away, bows back until he’s a beautiful curve from the point of his chin, down his elegant throat, to his flushed chest and taut stomach. He thrusts once—twice—then reaches down to grab the base of his cock. I look down to see his prick is a glistening scarlet, throbbing in his grip. There’s a single milky thread slowly unspooling from the slit and I watch as it stretches down between our bodies, until it snaps and lands in a thick drop on my cock.
At John’s desperate keening, Sherlock changes tack. His strokes turn into a flurry, focused in the tip. The crown catches in his tight fist on each upstroke and punches a breathy
of Sherlock’s thrusting cock and the jubilant jingle of his bell collar, John showered Sherlock with all manner of
When the tension ebs from Sherlock's body, John takes his que to continue. He moves his hand to the edge of Sherlock's jeans, slips his finger under the denim and runs it toward the button. “Okay?”
I have a fleeting thought of dexterity. Of clever fingers running up and down a fingerboard, coaxing beautiful music from the strings of a violin. Those same fingers are coaxing quite a different sound from me now.
John giggled, a bit manic. “So good. Fuck. So sensitive. It's this pressure, like when you come so hard you nearly pass out.”
Moans rumbled through Sherlock, growing louder, higher. He bucked into John’s fist in quick jabs, chasing his climax. John could feel the flutter of Sherlock’s hole around his tongue.
“I made it a wager. If I couldn’t do it, I'd never say another word out of turn, and if I could, I wouldn't have to go to class save for exams.”
Sherlock counted the steady heartbeats—two, three, four—as John stared at him, expression inscrutable. Sherlock found himself inexplicably worried, afraid that John would say no, or worse, take offense and leave. If he’d had a pulse, he was sure it'd be racing.
He guides me up and down the length of his cock, gently demanding, and I pull pleasure from him—draw out the bitter nectar of his bliss—with every tongue-curling suck. His hips twitch, his breath rasps out. He’s close.
Awe-struck. It’s the only way to describe him. His eyes are wide—pupils like an ink spill—and the rosy stain on his cheeks is pure arousal. His mouth gapes around shallow pants, and the tweak of his brow telegraphs a pleasure that flirts with the boundary of ‘too much’.
John doesn't hesitate. He lowers his head, dropping quick kisses over Sherlock’s chest before closing his lips around Sherlock's other nipple, already peaked in anticipation. He's gentle at first, suckling and flicking his tongue. Then his fingers give a sharp twist and his teeth bite down and Sherlock is howling. He bucks up, finds John’s hard thigh and begins to rut against it.
“You’re beautiful, Sherlock. Christ, you’re perfect. God, I love you so much.” John babbled, breathless. “I wanna be inside you. Can I? Can I just…”
In one smooth motion, Sherlock slid the crochet hook out of John’s slit and replaced it with his own pointed, probing tongue. He only had a second to spare a thought for the bitter taste of lube before warm, salty come flooded his mouth.
John looked back up, a proud smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, and didn’t say a word as he began to work at Sherlock’s flies. Sherlock joined him, making quick work of his shirt buttons. They left the clothes in a pile on the landing, to be tended to along with the other soiled laundry that the evening would undoubtedly produce.
“Oh,” Sherlock sighed. His cock throbbed in his briefs and he felt dizzy with lust. It wasn't just the sexual nature of the act. It was the trust and vulnerability.
He bites his lip, but doesn't quite manage to hide a smug little smile. Oh. . . This is going to be delicious, making him squirm.
But John didn’t stop there, he continued up, running his tongue over Sherlock’s hole—pressing against the resistant rim and slowly coaxing him open. Filthy sucking kisses had Sherlock moaning into his pillow, arching higher and seeking more.
John runs the pads of his fingers over the exposed length, pinches at the head, and swipes his finger and thumb across the slit. With the camera zoomed in, I can see the clear strand of precome stretch and snap as he tests the tensile strength.
He closes his hand around my hard shaft, leans down again, and runs the flat of his tongue over my other, untouched, breast. My body responds eagerly, a pearly drop welling up from my nipple. He flicks a few more times and I gasp as the milk begins to flow.
Slowly, John pulled away. He brought his hand to rest on Sherlock’s thigh and let his cock slip from his mouth as if it were a fragile thing—spun glass rather than steel.
“You could just get a haircut,” Lestrade said, teasing but not unkind. And just like that, it was dropped.
Pressure and pleasure are building, radiating, warning me in lapping waves that I don’t have long. “Getting close,” I growl.
“But you have the patience now. Oh—” Sherlock sucked in a breath as John’s hand slipped under fabric, fingers unerringly seeking out the hard bud that had been teased into exquisite sensitivity.
Sherlock’s voice rang out—a cry and a shout, a curse and a prayer—as he painted thick stripes of come over John's neck and chest. Five, six, seven streaks of milky white anointed him and John never once flinched. Instead he ran his fingers through the mess, smeared it into his skin.
I rear back, raising myself up and holding myself there, letting him do a bit of the work. I can’t hold back my moans. Little
“Most. . .?” Sherlock prompted when it was clear Lestrade’s sentence had derailed. “Is it not enough that I solve all your cases? Do I need to complete your sentences as well?”
John’s mouth slips from Sherlock’s, trails down his jaw and settles against the juncture of neck and shoulder. Sherlock moans, a needy, breathy sound. The press of teeth and pull of suction almost distract him from the sensation of John's hand sliding up his side and coming to rest on his pectoral. John cups him, squeezes like he might touch a woman, but Sherlock can't spare a thought to be indignant. Not when John's fingers strafe over his nipple—when he takes thumb and forefinger and pinches.
I have to take a moment to gather my wits—his talented fingers shattered them into roughly a million pieces and sent them flying to the four corners of the universe. But once I'm more or less in control, I sit up and throw a leg over his. His hands skim up the tops of my thighs, ruffling the fair hair, and sending shivery sparks of excitement through me. I flash him a smile, bright and cheeky, and lean over to the bedside table.
With one last savoring pull, Sherlock let him go. He licked his lips, imagining he could taste John's bliss.
“What?” I turn off the tap and set down the mug I'd been rinsing. When I turn toward the sitting room, I find Sherlock folded up in his chair, nose buried in a magazine. “What're you reading?”
John stood, tried to redirect. “I think you're right. Could definitely be poison. He's got punctures on his hand, could be injection sites.”
“Wait.” John was breathless as he tugged at Sherlock’s curls. “You can do that again once we’ve got this thing in.”
“You know,” Sherlock says, shifting the conversation to slightly less incriminating topics. “I passed my Year Eleven chemistry course without ever attending class.”
“I can't believe you're here,” John says on an exhale. He pushes himself off the door, takes a step towards Sherlock.
Nipple tight and erection now straining in his pants, Sherlock fought to keep his voice even. “Is it common practice to attempt intercourse with produce?”
It's not a question, but there is clear hesitation. His eyes skim me from the silvering tips of my hair to the wool-socked feet I've got crossed at the ankle. He looks as if he's doing some serious mental gymnastics.
The petting had started off innocent, with John's small, warm hand running up and down his side, his hip, his thigh. His fingers had played in the patch of hair on Sherlock’s chest, followed the line that ran down from his navel, and tickled at the trimmed thatch over his pubic bone. Not overtly sexual. Just a gentle petting.
He looks straight at me—into me—and brings his fingers up, licks delicately at the tips. I can hear the sibilant static of his hum, then he’s reaching back under the table. Stroking finger and thumb over the crown, he squeezes out a fresh drizzle. He coats his first two fingers this time and slips them past his lips. Sucking up to the fist knuckle.
Sherlock stops packing up his books. There's hesitation in John's voice, a hint of anxiety. It makes his own pulse quicken in response. “Yes?”
By the time John relents, Sherlock has gone half feral with lust. The touches turn soft and soothing and Sherlock settles back against the mattress, panting. John's making tiny hushing sounds against his chest and his hand is running up and down the curve of his waist.
He huffs a laugh and I look up to see him shaking his head, fond amusement gleaming in his eyes. But he doesn’t protest. He slips his hand back and grips the base of his cock firmly. A little shake of his wrist and the length of his erection moves up and down. The distended fabric shifts, the sheen and shadow undulating around the contour of his prick.
“No sign of forced entry,” Lestrade continued. “But that doesn't look like a natural death. We’re thinking poison.”
Compelled by something he couldn't explain, Sherlock placed a gentle kiss to the skin. Marking it with reverence.
His smile isn’t the thousand-watt grin Sherlock is accustomed to—the one he's used to seeing when he first sits down for a tutoring session. This smile is slow and knowing. It makes Sherlock’s stomach flip.
The sounds of the cafe fade away—no more barking orders or screeching chairs, no more chatter or clatter. Everything vanishes except John.
John scoops his fingers under what are surely come-heavy bollocks, and closes his hand. He pulls, releases, pulls again. His left hand has moved to the head, kneading. I zoom in, and
“You know what? Nevermind.” I walk out of the kitchen, make my way to my chair. “But to answer your question, no.”
He clenched and released his arsehole in a bid to draw John's attention, and rumbled deep in his chest when those three slick fingers plunged deep. The tingling returned twice as strong and Sherlock could feel himself leaking steadily. Everything from the tip of his cock, to his hanging bollocks, to his stretched rim, radiated warmth and pleasure. It pulsed deep and spread like hundreds of fingers stroking him. It was nearly unbearable and he sobbed out cries of pure bliss as the sensation built and built and—
John held himself just behind the crown of his cock and pressed in—dipped the very tip into the divot of Sherlock’s hole. It sucked at him, pulled him in another fraction of an inch, and John shuddered. He pulled back, rubbed around the pucker, and teased in again. He held there, pumping his tight fist along his shaft and letting the movement of his hand urge his cock to slide in… in…
A mixture of arousal and shame bloomed in Sherlock's gut. His cock gave an eager twitch. "I. . . Oh, Christ, John. . ."
Picking my phone up from off the table, I open the camera and zoom in until the table legs are just framing John’s bare knees. Silver gym shorts stretch above the curve of his quads, and gape open under his hamstrings, giving just a hint of creamy inner thigh.
After a bit of rustling and the tell-tale sound of water being poured, John followed Sherlock into the sitting room. He crossed the room, empty handed, and sat down next to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s heart began to race—adrenaline pumping through his veins, blood rushing to his cock. He looked at John with a hint of challenge and traced the tip of his tongue over his top lip. The answering flare of heat in John’s eye could melt glaciers. He pursed his lips and the message to Sherlock was clear:
With the flip of a switch low light diffused through the room, like a warm summer evening, tinting the world gold. “Sorry about that,” Sherlock said, closing the door and turning to his meal. “My brother has a condition that makes him an insufferable prat.”
I know sounding isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed writing this so I hope y'all give it a shot!
After what was surely not much more than an hour, but felt to Sherlock decidedly more like a decade of cascading euphoria, John slipped his fingers out. He stroked his clean hand down Sherlock’s back and reached with the other between Sherlock’s legs. John tugged at his heavy bollocks and tutted at the low fricative—the beginning of a not very kitty-like
John smiles and Sherlock can feel the curve of lips against his too hot, too tight skin. “Is that a yes?”
Pleas note: while sounding can be a very enjoyable experience, it must be practiced with care. There are lots of resources out there if you're interested, so do a little research before diving in. On that note, don't be like John—there are surgical steel sounds and plugs available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. You needn't resort to household objects. Please, be nice to your urethras folks.
Mycroft dabbed a spot of crimson from the corner of his mouth with a black cloth napkin. Never white—
Sherlock cried out, his hole clenching around John’s tongue. He came hot and hard over John’s hand, pulsing out thick ribbons until he shuddered with over sensitivity. The tension leached from his body, leaving him slumped over, arse up and face nestled in his pillow.
“No, no, no,” John said, pressing his palm against Sherlock’s jaw. “It’s fine.” He smoothed his thumb over the blade of Sherlock’s cheekbone. “More than fine.”
Sherlock has a predilection for bottoming. But that isn't all it takes to be a bona fide power bottom, as John demonstrates.
I lower myself down, elbows on either side of his head, and kiss him. Long and languorous, like the liquid undulation of my body. The glide of our tongues never gets old, but that hungry nip to my bottom lip is new. He licks into my mouth and I suck on his tongue, tasting something dark and sweet—a fresh bloom of lust.
Sherlock kissed at his throat, pulled at his hips, rocked up into his belly. He was insatiable and John couldn’t blame him—it’d been over a month since they’d last been anything resembling intimate. They’d been too busy dashing all over London on two back-to-back cases—tracking down a gang of art theives before apprehending a mistress-cum-murderer.
“No.” Sherlock moved his hand, trailed his fingers up John’s blushing chest. “No. Of course not. But it isn't a binary system. There’s all manner of possibilities. Tell me, what is it about being with a man that you enjoy most?” Sherlock skimmed John's throat, jaw, lips. “The scent? The hard angles? The feel of a hard cock between your lips? Or pounding in your arse?”
Sherlock raised himself up, caging John’s head between his hands and swinging a leg over his hips. He was the quintessential cat with a mouse. Mycroft would be absolutely repulsed. Sherlock couldn't be happier.
Sherlock hums in agreement. “I guess he didn't appreciate my correction. Or when I questioned how he managed to tie his shoes in the morning. So he tried to embarrass me. He asked if I was so smart, why don't I just recite the Periodic Table.”
“Yes, John.” With his right hand Sherlock worked the rod in and out, and with his left he used just the tip of finger and thumb to quickly slide John’s foreskin back and forth over the generous flare of his glans.
“Sherlock.” It’s barely a breath. I lift myself up on my elbows and turn to look over my shoulder. “Sherlock, wait.”
He sags back, panting, and rubs his hands over my rotund belly. The baby is kicking, no doubt in response to my elevated heart rate and the flood of orgasm induced endorphins. He presses his hand down and grins fondly.
Sherlock stirred and raised himself up on his elbows. Hands rested on his waist, thighs bracketed his hips, and underneath him, John smiled fondly. Realization dawned, followed immediately by mortification. Had he really just ejaculated in his trousers and then collapsed in an ungainly heap on top of his dinner? He looked down in increasing horror.
“Why should it be?” Sherlock leaned in closer and laid his hand high on John’s thigh. “You of all people know I like to experiment.”
“I'm not.” Sherlock whispered, mouth against John’s ear. “This is all you. Neurochemicals and hormones. Want and desire. Need. You need this, John.”
He nibbled, felt the play of texture—supple and wrinkled and malleable—against his lips. Then against his tongue as he began to lap, slow and savoring. Wet open-mouthed kisses followed, trailing up once again from hanging curve to musky-sweet perineum.
Sherlock spun on his heel and began his search—behind the aquarium and under the table—jingling all the while. Ignoring John’s protestations, he climbed over a chair. Indelicate in the display of his arse, he bent over the back and reached down.
Sherlock swallows. “Hello, John.” He cringes inwardly at the formality in his tone. Relax. “Have you been here long?”
“Oh God, John!” Sherlock digs his nails into John’s back, claws along his spine. Whether in retribution or encouragement is unclear. Either. Both.
Alone in the foyer, brain having finally resurfaced, Sherlock had looked back at the bulletin and pulled a tab off the freshly tacked flyer for one John Watson, chemistry tutor.
“Now stop.” John reinforced the command with a firm squeeze. It took no small amount of effort, but Sherlock managed to stem the flow to a trickle, then—with a whine of displeasure—he stopped entirely.
John’s heart hammered now, heavy beats against Sherlock’s palm. “It’s not—I've never. . . I'm not gay.”
John licked his lips, the first sign of nervousness he’d displayed all night. “Where would you prefer to feed?”
He wraps his fingers around my wrists and holds me in place, an anchor as I slowly raise myself up. I look him in the eyes—watch him watch me—as that thick, satin-over-steel shaft slides out. And,
I stop and lean against the worktop for a moment, trying to parse his mood. Teasing? Provoking? Curious? He’s certainly doing his best to appear disinterested, despite instigating the conversation.
“None.” Sherlock answers, then pauses to consider. “I have started two chemical fires, and there was one incident with a Bunsen burner that could have gotten a little explosive. . .”
Sherlock did as he was told, lubing the hook from the round end all the way to the wide grip. Once the rod was dripping with thick, clear lubricant, he squirted a dollop on his finger and looked to John for guidance. With one hand, John held himself steady, and with the other he circled the head with thumb and forefinger. He pulled back firmly and Sherlock watched as the lips of John’s slit parted, revealing pink, tender flesh.
Gorgeous eyes, irises laced with slate and flecked with cobalt. Mile-long lashes that shone golden in the light pouring in from the glass double-doors. In his periphery, Sherlock had noted hair the color of clover honey, skin glowing with a healthy tan, and thin lips curled into a friendly smile.
I’m instantly reminded of how much larger he is than me. It’s easy to forget—when he’s titling his hips up into the air and begging for my cock; when I’m holding him by the waist and pounding into him, listening to him breathlessly keen my name. But with him hovering above me—broad shoulders and strong chest and darkly gleaming eyes—it’s suddenly, blindingly obvious.
Sherlock sniffed. “You also don't seem to mind going to your knees in the foyer. Or when I pull you off in the occasional supply closet.”
John’s hand lingered on Sherlock’s inseam as he pulled away. “Why don't you go upstairs and put on the kettle.”
He twists and tugs and I slam down, taking his cock down to the root. I lift up, keening at the magnificent slide, then down again, impaling myself. Over and over, recklessly hard and fast.
John sank his clean hand into Sherlock’s curls, raking through them like the soft cotton coat of a smokey Persian. His other hand he extricated from between them, and wiped off on the soiled sheets.
His tongue follows the glistening path of milk up to its source and laps at the slow but steady flow. With his free hand he squeezes my breast, rhythmic and massaging—encouraging more. His tongue flicks and circles and a tingling sensation begins to pulse and spread.
He considered his options: apply acid to the chicken gizzards in the freezer (in the name of science, of course); check his email (for a case or for an opportunity to issue scathing replies, both equally possible); or have a wank (immediately gratifying, but a bit self-defeating once John returned). There was nothing for it, he'd just have to convince John to get home faster.
Sherlock gave Lestrade his third most withering expression. “It doesn't change the fact that this body has no defensive wounds, or that all the previous victims were working class and this man was obviously in a high-stress management role with aspirations of climbing the corporate ladder.”
Finally spent, John fell back on his heels. His hands drifted to Sherlock’s hips, his forehead dropped to the plush curve of Sherlock’s arse. He panted against come-stained skin and tried to calm his racing heart.
Just as we turn the corner toward the back exit, I notice a woman's eyes go wide. She does a double take as we pass and then turns to whisper excitedly to her friend. As we round the corner I cast a glance over my shoulder, and sure enough they’re peering over, trying to catch one more look. I give them a wink instead.
“Mike’s out, but I don't know when he's planning on coming back,” John explains as he pulls Sherlock into his room. “We won't be interrupted in here.”
“All right.” Sherlock sat back on his heels and held up the crochet hook, holding like an orchestral conductor would hold a wand. “Now what?”
As much as I love to surprise him, I don't want him blowing a fuse. “Not with you,” I clarify, “but we've only been at it for a couple months, we've got plenty to try yet.”
Sherlock frowned. Slowly, with dawning horror, he reached up and skimmed his fingers over the soft satin band. He felt the tickle of fur and clenched his jaw. Doing his best not to blush, Sherlock yanked the headband off and stuffed it in his coat pocket.
The strange discoloration of the corpse and dried pool of vomit staining the threadbare carpet certainly didn't suggest anything as simple as a heart attack.
Like a whisper in the dark, Sherlock slipped down John's body—spread his knees apart and settled between them. He ran his hands up John's trembling legs, caressing pale, smooth inner thighs. Sherlock's thumb swept across the tender skin over and over, until John was flexing and straining under his touch.
Sherlock hadn't even realized he'd closed his eyes until he dazedly blinked them open, let his bliss-addled gaze drift down. Soft candlelight glistened in the droplets clinging to John's stomach, trailing down the inclined plane of his torso, and pooling at the hollow of his throat.
John massaged him, hummed at the eager twitch of Sherlock's prick. "I want to feel you get wet. Just a bit. Just enough to soak through."
There’s a low simmer of desire in my belly, slowly radiating outward. It makes me drive my hips back a bit harder and arch my chest into his touch. I'm not hard yet, but my cock is awake and interested.
I can hear the blast of the steamer as John’s fingers twitch against flimsy fabric of his shorts, the tittering of laughter as he shifts and spreads his legs further apart.
An accident turns into an experiment that leaves John more irritated than aroused. Now Sherlock has to prove he can be a good kitty.
When he hears the rasp of the zip, Sherlock sighs in relief. He's beyond aching—so hard and on edge, it's a bit of a surprise that he doesn't come in his pants when John reaches into the open vee and palms him.
Sherlock ground down, swiveling his hips to stir up the most sensation he could. John was right there.
He brought his finger to the opening, covering it in slick. He worked it in and around until John gave a shaky nod. “That should be good.”
Tugging down John’s pants revealed an uncut, throbbing cock—flushed and weeping at the tip. Below the thick shaft, John’s full, round bollocks looked fit to burst.
!" John pulled him roughly down, buried himself to the root. Sherlock could feel John's thick cock surging inside him, filling him up.
John tilted up, brushing his lips over Sherlock’s ear. “I would take a five millimeter hex key, and stick it. . .” He stopped, a shaky breath tickling against sensitive skin. “I’d stick it down my cock. Fuck myself with it, then plug it up and toss off.”
I think he may be pouting, that he may be about to call this whole thing off, when he spreads his legs wide. And,
John’s hand squeezed—gentle encouragement—and Sherlock’s breath trembled through a sharp inhale. He let his eyes flutter closed on John’s intent indigo gaze. He was so full, his body clenched so tight against the incessant need to
My mouth skims over the cutting edge of his cheekbone and he tips his head back, meeting me halfway. I close my lips over his, and my tongue teases at the seam of his mouth, poised to slip inside the second he opens up. The temperature in our immediate proximity cranks from simmering to scorching as my tongue slides against his. Our breaths rasp out, lust-drenched and ragged, as his fingers clench and his hips kick up harder. I pull away before we completely lose control and look directly into his eyes—wild verdigris swamped by ink black.
He reached between Sherlock’s legs and palmed his bollocks. They too felt heavier—heftier—than normal. They were already snug up against Sherlock’s body, ready to burst.
Trying to still John once more, Sherlock pressed down on his hip. He could feel the heat of John’s prick, so close to his hand, and sucked harder. The urge to touch, to curl his fingers around that hard length and stroke, nearly overwhelmed him.
“Fuck!” John’s cock slipped from Sherlock’s hole. His hand flew, pumping and squeezing and twisting at the head. “Yes, Sherlock. Fuck, I’m gonna come. You want me to come in your arse? Or all over it?”
John hesitates at the exit, looking over his shoulder to make sure nobody is watching, then leans against the push bar. We spill out onto the pavement behind the cafe and I look up and down the alley for an adequate spot to get on my knees. There’s an alcove a few yards away and I push him towards it.
He picks up the rhythm easily, stroking in counter to my desperate rolling and rocking. And it’s wonderful. It sends pulses of pleasure through my core. The stretch has me feeling weightless and the pressure against my prostate is like an imploding star—heavy, white hot, and consuming.
“You know,” I say as he's running his fingers through my curls, smoothing out any tangles. “I won't be able to breastfeed if I've had any alcohol. I believe the colloquialism is ’pump and dump’.”
John blinked his eyes open and looked dazedly down at Sherlock. “Give me a minute. I just. . .” he sighed, almost a whine. “I need a minute.”
Settling down on his lap is like claiming a throne. A fresh drizzle of precome slides from my prick at the thought. This is my rightful place. He is my dominion.
The sun is just dipping below the skyline, the air crisp but not uncomfortably cold, as Sherlock walks through the door of Low Key Bar. With its blacked out windows and garish neon sign, he had expected to be assaulted by obnoxious music and the smell of cheap booze. He’s pleasantly surprised.
After the wind down—the twelve hours of sleep, two servings of panang curry, and a thorough dicking down by one, John Watson—Sherlock retreated to the catacombs of his mind palace. Processing the case was hardly a task. No. There was something else that required examination.
He chuckles in a way that suggests he thinks I’m joking. He stops when I don’t join him. “Wait. What are you thinking about?”
Sherlock looked up, startled. He recovered with a flurry of blinks, recalling where he was: a modest first-floor flat in Hammersmith, not the sitting room of 221B with curtains drawn and plastic lining the floor; and with whom: a tired DI counting down the minutes to a cold pint, not a retired army doctor with hungry eyes and tented trousers. He cleared his throat. "No need to sound so surprised. I always give you a statement."
John beams at him, tugs at an errant curl, and sets about getting them cleaned up. Once Sherlock had been satisfactorily wiped down and they’re both tucked back into their jeans, they settle back on the bed. John has nestled against Sherlock’s side and tossed an arm over his naked belly.
Sherlock ducked his head, looked at John from under his lashes. “I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.”
Sherlock squints down at the reaction mechanism he's written out, presses his lips together in a show of concentration. Of course he knows where he went wrong. Just like he knew the error he’d fabricated in last week's S1 reaction and the nomenclature mistakes he’d made the week before. But it would make for a rather boring tutoring session if he got everything right all the time.
So much warm skin, flushed and glowing. Hard muscle and tight nipples. Golden hair trailing down from the divot of a navel. The steady thrum of blood called to Sherlock, and soon that slow simmer of desire under his skin turned into a blaze, a conflagration he had to fight to control.
“A crochet hook,” John confirmed. “I’d say five or so millimeters in diameter. Six inches long, though we won't be needing all of that.”
I gasp as hot spit lands squarely on my anus. That was. . . unexpected. But in no way unappreciated.
Saliva trickles down my chin as John grunts, short and staccato, “Yeah. . . Fuck. Sher. . . Gonna. Gonna—ahhh. . .”
I ease my way down, rocking forward and back. The heat makes me sigh, the pressure gives that breath the tiniest bit of voice—a mewl of contentment caught in the back of my throat.
“What do I do when you come? Leave it in or pull it out?” Sherlock gripped him a fraction tighter, careful not to pinch.
“So you’ve never been awake.” Sherlock would typically detest stating the obvious, but this development warranted clarification.
Underneath me, Sherlock is rolling his hips lazily. His eyes are closed and his cheeks are painted a lovely shade of pink, and if those weren’t good enough clues, the subtle pulsing of his cock tells me all I need to know.
The cab rounded the corner to Baker Street and Sherlock's bladder pulsed, a delicious reminder of what was about to come. He savored these last few minutes—didn't rush as he paid the cabbie, took unhurried strides across the threshold and up the stairs. The urgency was there, but he denied it.
“I think,” Sherlock says, after a contented stretch of silence. “If we’re to continue this, there is something I should tell you.”
. And I want it all recorded. I want to play it back again and again and remember the time we fucking lost ourselves in a filthy alley behind our second favorite cafe.
John pulls back a half step, looking even more confused, and that is absolutely unacceptable. Sherlock reaches for him, slips his hands just under his ears to curve around the back of his head, and lowers his mouth.
The tips of Sherlock's fingers tucked under the hem of John’s pants, tickling at the crease of pelvis and leg. So hot. Blood pulsing. The craving damn near impossible to ignore. John whimpered and it rang in Sherlock’s ear like a siren song. He was drawn in, drawn down.
. These fucking Omega thoughts—so cloyingly sentimental. It must be the hormones. But as much as I’d love to, I can’t deny the appeal.
I lean back, plant my hands on Sherlock’s thighs for balance, and thrust into his hand. The angle has his cockhead glancing against my prostate with every undulation and a dense pit of pleasure has formed behind my balls. The stimulation that flares up with each pass of his hand along my cock is suddenly too much—too sharp, too bright. I sob for him to let go and he does, moving both his hands to my hips, pushing and pulling me. He kicking his hips up again, following along with the rhythm I’ve set.
John’s cock. Christ. It’s magnificent. It sways, heavy and thick, away from John’s pelvis. The tip, still sheathed, is positively drizzling precome.
John sat, spread his legs wide, and leaned back. He took his prick in hand, giving it slow stokes—squeezing at the tip—until the slit glistened with precome. Apparently satisfied, he grabbed at the base and tilted it toward Sherlock, looking for all the world like a man accustomed to being serviced thusly.
I'm writhing with the need for everything all at once. I want John to suck harder. I want his fat Alpha cock in my arse. I want his hand on my weeping prick. I want him to hold me and stoke me and lick me everywhere.
When Sherlock can once again open his eyes again, he sees John straddling his hips, one hand shoved down the front of his open jeans. He looks a bit lost—a bit wild—as he strokes himself. Sherlock leans up, reaches out, and demands, “Come here.”
Sherlock sat back, quiet and contemplative as he retreated into his mind palace. He sorted through years of conversations and observations: John’s browser history and his stash of masturbatory aides under the bed; a parade of sexually satisfied, if not boring, lovers; embarrassing anecdotes told over several rounds on John's 38th birthday; and most recently, late night whispers as fingertips explored skin. But he could find nothing to answer the question in his head.
