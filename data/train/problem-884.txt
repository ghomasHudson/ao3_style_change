John laughed; a sound tinged with outright joy as he leapt away from the downed detective and slowly stripped off his own checked shirt. It was soaking now, practically dripping with Omega sweat, and he lobbed it at the ground towards Sherlock’s knees.
John took in the man at work, and (tired of waiting for an invitation) sat down stiffly in the chair across from him. The Omega wondered if this was what Sherlock’s life was like all the time…mysteries, murders, experiments, and the like. He wondered if the man ever became lonely, although you wouldn’t be able to tell just by looking. The apex Alpha succeeded at keeping himself duly occupied whenever he was in John’s presence, moving and running about, pacing and talking a mile a minute. Still, John wondered if there wasn’t anyone special in his life.
The nurse grunted and swayed back dangerously before righting herself and gripping him at the wrists once more. Behind her, the door flew open and three burly aids appeared at his bedside. One was successful in securing his kicking feet, while one replaced the harried nurse. The last one brandished a syringe of a colourless liquid and hastily administered it into Sherlock’s intravenous line, flushing a few times for good measure.
Marcus didn’t go down all at once. He took the first shot full in the chest, staggering ever so slightly, but continued in his rampage towards John’s attackers. It wasn’t until the third and fourth bullet struck home that he fell. He fell in one thundering crash, displacing large puddles of water as he landed, on his back, his face turned towards John.
IMA: You are.
POLICE: Moving along, I just wanted to clarify that the date is December 8, 2014 and by my watch, the time is 1438. This interview is being conducted in New Scotland Yard in Interrogation Room 11. You have allowed REDACTED  to sit in on this interview, yeah, and you will concede any requests at having a solicitor present, am I correct?
The very thought would have probably left a lesser man a little frightened, but John had more than enough experience with these supposed governmental types. In fact, he was a bit intrigued, if not also a bit put out. He was trying to save his younger brother’s life for God’s sake; he certainly didn’t need the powers that be breathing down the back of his proverbial neck.
John couldn't exactly agree. While he did manage to successfully implant the device into the younger Holmes, the original procedure had gone horribly awry; and even though there’d been no way of knowing Sherlock would reject the initial Guide donor tissue, John couldn't help but feel the majority of the blame weighing heavily on his shoulders.
” John repeated, left fist clenching at his side.
His John Watson laid in a pool of his own blood and fluids on the cool tile floor, keening and gasping for breath.
OTHER: How, precisely, is this done?
“Hey Watson!” The hard blow of a rugby ball glanced across his back, causing him to stumble and drop his tattered book bag. Gathering himself together, John looked behind his shoulder, taking in the familiar and angular face of Edward Hutchison, two years older, Formed Alpha and great big bloody brute. Wonderful.
they thinking?
“No,” John clenched his jaw, the muscles aching from the strain over the past 24 hours. “I’ll stay here tonight, this is where I belong.” He nodded with finality.
"Lovely," John offered, bringing a plate of fresh fruits and fragrant cheeses back from the kitchen. He smiled at Sherlock, genuine, sincere, and so full of outright adoration he had to turn his gaze away. The fruit and cheese platter was an offering from Mrs. Hudson to repay Sherlock after playing a beautiful rendition of Good King Wenceslas, one of the voted favourites. Well, Sherlock would play that and a hundred more carols if it garnered a smile like that from John Watson.
“Don’t – don’t rip the buttons off that one…I quite like that one.” He managed to stutter, before setting himself back on task, which was no easy feat.
He froze, stopped short, every muscle in his body locking in place. The taller man helped the downed goon get to his feet with a grunt, and John was rewarded with a cruel punch to the gut.
Sherlock turned around, twirling in absolute circles, confused and completely blind.
It wasn’t unusual for an Omega to project strong emotions, fear or happiness, but he’d never heard or read of an Omega’s pheromones subconsciously affecting a group of people to
“You’re
Jeremy stopped his no doubt caffeine fuelled work pace as he spotted John, a friendly smile lighting up his spotted face.
Stapleton herself was as unremarkable as her dull office, her dishwater blonde hair hung in perfectly straight hanks down to her upright shoulders. Her complexion begged for sun, while her watery eyes and reddened nose indicated she was fighting a head cold of some sort (could be seasonal allergies, with the time of year and relative flora, judging from the lack of recent rain and stiff westerly wind, could be pollen, but also most likely a head cold from the greenish tinge to the mucus collecting on the ratty tissue, off-brand, over used – )
. After all, John was a medical doctor - he knew how to sprain people.
“Marcus,” he hobbled towards the large man, “you’ve been gone forever, you great big beast. If I’d known it was going to take all day for you to gather our things, I would have had Sarah help you.”
John woke abruptly, body flushed and shaking; sheets and bed damp with perspiration.
The detective turned away from the back of the couch to regard his Omega, face drawn and unsure. “Yes?”
he knew all those things about John, but it didn’t matter insomuch as they were completely true. He spared a glance over to Sarah and Marcus, neither of whom gave any indication of hearing any of the exchange between Sherlock and John. Wordlessly, they stared at him as they sat on the gravel and waited. John pocketed the new mobile in the same pocket at the pamphlet, and made his way over his friends, his aching hip reminding him it was late and he had had a very long day.
No one gave the limping Omega a second glance as he searched the list of suites next to the busy lift bank. It was strange; he couldn’t locate the actual suite number on the directory. All the business and offices seemed to be allocated according to floor number, and there were many on the eighth floor, just no suite marked 895. He frowned, sniffing once and squaring his shoulders. Well, that wasn’t suspicious at all, was it?
He then used a small one millilitre dropper to slowly settle one perfectly spherical droplet of each of the new solutions onto two separate slides. The Alpha studied each slide one its own, intensely muttering under his breath, before wrenching his hands through his hair and abruptly ripping the slides out from underneath the microscope clips and unceremoniously tossing each piece of thin glass away from him. John watched as they skittered across the table, the slip covers managing to keep the small amounts of liquid adhered to the glass.
“What the bloody hell are you playing at Barrymore? We had a deal!”
Hopefully it was unguarded, and if he ran full force right now, he might be able to make it out onto the street where he had a much better chance of hiding and getting away. Well, that was it, it was the only plan he had, and he better make it good.
His thoughts were never far from his Omega, and Sherlock fancied he could scent him even through the heavy northern pine doors of the church. John’s pheromones carried a complicated mixture of hope and sorrow, these days, but today, today it was rife with grief and regret.
“The victims of the study were all killed elsewhere and then dumped at, as of yet, unrelated areas. Some of the wounds vary, but hint to a kind of escalation,” he swivelled in his chair and rifled through the first of the files, pulling out a large glossy photo of one of the first victims associated with the latent Omega murders, “here, this young man Scott Andrews…he met his final end through potassium injection – by the way thank you for that Molly, excellent work there – and it was only after his death that he had a vaginal hysterectomy. The next man here,” another photo flopped on top of the next, “the same. Although this time there are also incisions near both of his kidneys, leading to removal of his adrenal glands; and so on and so forth. Each new murder built on the one previously until we have Jimmy Price. He had a full abdominal hysterectomy, removal of his adrenal glands, various lymph nodes, and excessive damage to his pituitary gland.”
“Oh well,” she chimed, tying the tourniquet and administering a few well-place slaps to the underside of his arm, “that’s common enough. Bit of aches and pains, slight fever, yes?”
No, they would need something that stimulated either the genitals or the pleasure centre of the brain directly. There’d be no use in trying another peripheral implant as the cauda equina was by far the most successful nerve bundle used during all trials.
It was only a moment, a moment’s distraction, to unhook a small metal tine from a hole in a leather strap, but really, that was all it he needed.
was already responsible for the deaths of a dozen men, the thought that she was free…that she could possibly do this to another latent Omega. Panic rose in his chest, searing hot panic. The flat flooded with Omega pheromones, dampened from injury but oily, frightened and thick.
Mycroft had been meticulously editing a few important government missives from the comfort of his sedan, when he’d seen one John Watson hobble painfully out of the Hospital and make for the nearest tube station. The look on his thin, harried face was indescribable.
Sherlock whipped is head round sharply, piercing Mycroft with a frosty gaze that promised the man if this conversation continued much further, he would not like the outcome. “It was

What a time for something like this. In all the ways in his life his body had betrayed him; he never thought now would be the time it would decide to add another hash-mark onto its growing list. He’d never had this problem before, this strange kind of – of incontinence, so to speak.
“What?” Irene moved behind Sebastian, her breath warm against the back of his shoulder, “what is it?”
, so lovely you decided to show. I thought maybe you had abandoned our little meeting in favor of a coup in Kazakhstan, or some such nonsense.” Sherlock’s deep voice virtually dripped with disdain as he regarded the other man. It appeared there was no love lost there.
“Wait a minute? Experimenting? Who said anything about experimenting? I thought we were just investigating murders? You said yourself the drugs were only placebos. Oh and by the way…” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the blister pack of capsules identical to the one’s Jimmy had not so long ago. “Here’s this, not much to bring back, for my troubles.” He dropped the pack unceremoniously on the table where Molly picked it up with a delicate hand. Sherlock returned to his microscope, twirling and fiddling with the knobs with practised ease.
“You’re scent has changed John. It’s muted now, of course, but irresistible and even more
“Good evening, Highlands Centre, which extension please?”
Sherlock turned, smoothing his hands down the lapels of his sixth best suit, readying himself for the common barrage of questions he’d been subjected to since beginning his treatment at the cottage.
to have misheard. John had done a fair job of trying to forget this man over the last couple days, and having the Alpha practically thrust himself upon him whilst speaking words of atonement was a little more than he could bear. His stomach twisted violently.
“John, I –”
“And you agreed?”
Finally, the Apple logo disappeared and the screen came to life. It was a far cry from the old Vodafone he used before he went into the RAMC, that model was as simple as it could get. It had a small drab colored screen with buttons, and that was really all John had needed.
A newly formed Omega he may be, and in heat, but that in no way made him stupid, or weak. Ms. Irene Adler was about to learn that, the hard way.
happened after that video feed went blank.
At first he hadn’t been sure…even when her face had been turned towards the camera he still wasn’t one hundred percent positive, but in his gut he knew it to be true - and with that dawning realization, came another, even more unsettling conclusion…
“You know what my Da says about your kind?” Ed’s lips turned up into a disarmingly innocent smile, and in another lifetime, John might have thought him handsome. “He says all you really need is a good mounting, and you know, one good bite on that pretty little neck, and BAM” his large hands clapped against the side of the rugby ball for emphasis, “there you have it, just like jump starting a car.”
John was loathe to exit the shower. The too hot, stinging droplets felt heavenly on his reddened skin, and he could almost feel the unexpected excitement and drama of the last day swirl its way down the drain.
“This one right here…?”

“A bit not good, yeah.”
The woman who’d addressed him offered a closed mouthed smile, stretching her full lips, cautious in manner and closed in her body language. The smile held neither mirth nor genuine pleasure, but what it did convey was a certain kind of curiosity of which Sherlock was very familiar. She was rather tall, well-built, and held herself in a defensive stance that made Sherlock think twice about blowing her off completely. She looked him up and down, apparently unimpressed, and tucked a lock of tightly curled hair behind one ear.
“I haven’t written up the full report yet, but I wanted to tell you first.” She blushed prettily, though it was wholly lost on the consulting detective, “This is an inguinal lymph node, one of many I gathered from the body, and all you really need do is just look at it to realize it’s not normal. The tissue is granulomatous, undifferentiated, and it’s quite larger than it should be.”
Brandy and Julia had come through with the cleaning equipment for their broken down, abandoned little bungalow. After a few days, it was almost presentable, and if one didn’t inhale too deeply, one could completely overlook the musty smell of bird’s droppings completely. Still, it was a place to work. Their little group had managed to rummage a bit and procure a few bits of furniture that wasn’t destroyed, waterlogged, or otherwise completely useless. It wasn’t much, just a folding table, a couple of stools and a very dented and chipped filing cabinet. John had made do with less once, in his RAMC days.
“I’m not wearing a bloody
“Uh no…I-I thought there was a shortage…” John blanched only slightly (he noted with a hint of pride) as she inserted the needle and filled tube after tube with gentle, smooth motions. She really was very good; John hoped she was only an innocent employee and not involved in the deaths of the young men.
“I…I just wanted to tell you that, well, Sherlock and I –” his throat closed involuntarily, thickening with emotion and the fresh, searing pain of rejection, “well we’ve had a disagreement. I – I don’t think I can work with him anymore but, I still want to help. I mean, that is, I will continue with the original plan with you…but I don’t – I won’t work with Sherlock anymore.”
“You really mean it then?”
Sherlock stood shoulder to shoulder with Lestrade and another young officer from the met, Officer Murray (just call me Bill, please), a small but powerful Beta that Mycroft had personally recommended for the raid. The very atmosphere was tense and quiet, the silence only broken at odd intervals by the irregular static of a handheld two-way radio. Unmarked police vehicles lined the streets, as inconspicuous as possible, and groups of men had gradually been gathering and taking their places for the raid that was soon to come. Sherlock felt very nearly like this was the calm before the storm, the quick, rapid flash of pure light before the thunder and rain came barrelling down.
Julia spun away from her perch at the window. “That is
“Which is?” He looked from Molly to Sherlock, who sighed and moved away from the eyepieces.
I constantly stress over my writing style and I have finally figured it out: Simple past narration with perfect and progressive elements. Thank you Purdue!!!!
Well, as promised, here is the next installment! Please keep in mind that these chappies are not beta'd or brit-picked, but I honestly do try. I am shamefully American (Texan, even), but I try to give my stories a British flair.

John shot a glance at Sherlock; spoon raised halfway towards his mouth, which had fallen open with appropriate surprise.
This vengeful thought was a balm to the small Omega, folded in on the cot as he was, trying to gather his purpose and find himself in his surroundings. In the background he realized, it was quiet. There was no beeping, no high-pitched continuous tone or any machine-like sounding noises at all. He was unhooked, as it were, free of the monitors that were previously attached, and for that he was immensely grateful. The last few moments of emotional upheaval would have certainly shown in his respiration and heart rate, alerting anyone who was watching that not only was he awake, but quite upset as well.
“But there is a chance it might, and that would change your life completely…as it did mine.”
It didn’t matter, none of it mattered.
Mrs. Hudson took off like a rocket, vacating her place at the bed to shoot towards the door and the fancy light switch only recently upgraded. Underneath the main button for the lights was a small and prominently displayed blue button demonstrably labelled ‘emergency.’
“And how would
She scowled and slammed the wooden drawer (now positively brimming with perfectly matched socks) closed in a move that rattled the large and precariously perched mirror affixed to the adjoining wall in the hopes that the noise would startle the young man awake. It did no such thing.
From the very bottom of his vision, he could see it – wrinkled, damp and bloody, it looked to be some kind of packing, and when he pulled it out completely, it uncurled from its forced compression like a viper free from its nest. He grimaced, gasping in air once more and trying to breathe again through his nose…nothing.
You want me to purposefully put myself out there to be possibly
John left his cup of tea sitting alone on the desk in front of him, almost as if he’d forgotten it was still there, and the languid, vaporous steam that rose from the liquid filled the space between them. He pursed his lips, the dull angles of his cheekbones becoming more pronounced and belying the boyish roundness of his face. After a good bout of silence, he finally lifted the cup to his lips and took a deep, measuring draw.
Drowsiness washed over him, and he kept his eyes on the nurse, noting her round face, the three moles dancing beneath her lower lip. Dancing. Yes, there were dancing to a jaunty tune as she spoke, and he finally focused on them, arms and legs going slack.
did you realise?”
With a shrug of his shoulders, the left moving up noticeably less that the right, he pushed his despondent ruminations aside and swiftly divested himself of his clothing. This would be the worst of it, and while John had the emotional strength enough to look upon the reflection of his own haggard face, he didn’t know if he could manage to take in the damaged, mangled form of his body.  Still, gathering the misplaced courage embedded in the long line of Watsons (alcoholics, gamblers, and the like), he raised his eyes once again to take in the now wasted form of his once fit and tanned figure.
John figured it was probably about time for him to jump in. “Ladies…what the
He shoved his hands back in his pockets and stomped back to his car, a tiny thing he inherited from Harry, turned the key and choked back hot angry tears as the engine roared to life. It became clear to John, right then and there, that he needed to do
He stretched his neck, lifting his chin in an unconscious manner, feeling all of the heat and pounding heartbeats leave his chest and settle far, far lower. If this went on much longer, he really would be in trouble. He couldn't control his bodily reaction, not when he was flush chest to chest with the man he dreamt about, thought about, wanted to be with and see every day for the rest of his life.
John Watson had survived the transformation and exceeded all of her expectations. Now all that was left was to feed him up a bit, and convince him that it was her (and her alone) that had granted him this new life, and as such, he owed her. She didn’t think it would be too much trouble; the man had been so alone for so long, so…unloved, he’d probably snatch up any scraps of affection she was willing to throw his way.
There was something he remembered, stuffed deep in the back of one of the older folders, research about the orbitofrontal cortex.
Murray swallowed, gulping down a heady rush of adrenaline, “Ay, ay, Captain.”
; oh please
The order was given, and two broad-chested Alphas gripping a small but dense battering ram came forward. With a coordinated countdown, they swung the Enforcer, slamming it into the seam of the doors. The steel tube trembled, almost as much as the run down doors quivered against the impact. One of the men holding the ram grunted, flexing a heavily gloved hand against the vibrations.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock whispered into his hair.
..uh…” was the only response the Omega gave, his modest cock reddening even further, glistening with tacky, pearlescent fluid.
” Sherlock’s voice was smooth and deep, a viscous liquid that roiled around his primitive brain in currents that whispered of lust, longing, and millennia of sexual acquiescence. John’s own bodily response could not be diminished, regardless of how confused and wonderfully frightened he felt in this moment; and underneath that one simple word, a rumbling murmur (almost like a purr), vibrated from the Alpha’s chest.
, that’s what was happening now.
The reluctant patient shrugged his bony shoulders; an action so blasé even John questioned why the boy bothered to seek his help at all.
The sensation was unbearable, insufferable.
John took the offered paper with a forced smile and stuffed it unceremoniously into his left pyjama bottom pocket, not even bothering to give either of the Alphas the satisfaction of looking at it in front of them.

out of here, then find Sherlock.
“Because,” and here she paused, Dr. Frankland had previously called her dramatic, and most of the time he was quite right, “I know what he likes.”
“I wasn’t
Did he really have to
“I want you here on the base, in the mobile hospital, where it’s safer for you.”
Sherlock forcefully slid each slide into their requisite plastic slots; some of them cracked, splintered, or broke apart altogether (he didn’t seem to notice). His viridian eyes were vacuous and distant, his mouth viciously tight. What was he doing?
“No, John,” Molly interjected, her face gone quite pale and serious, “what we’re saying is each and every one of these cells is pumping out immense quantities of this hormone, more than any human could possibly need. We don’t know what caused the cancer initially but if someone wanted to almost…manufacture this hormone, well, they’d have the perfect system right here.”
He felt chilled suddenly; his threadbare hospital gown was as helpful as tissue paper when it came to retaining body warmth. A low level of arousal pricked his skin…a live undercurrent of preparedness that rolled low in his gut since he’d stepped in the building earlier today.
John coughed, clearing his throat, though it didn’t seem to do him much good. His heart had plummeted and was now beating somewhere in the vicinity of his large bowel.
IMA: Yes, I remember you. How is your REDACTED??
“She killed herself when she was eighteen…pills.”
“Am I not?”
Behind John’s flushed and overwhelmed face, the monitor’s beeping began to increase in tandem with the blond’s rising heart rate. Dully, in the back of his mind, John reckoned he heard a stifled conversation between two people outside his door:  one probably a concerned nurse, the other Sherlock’s ‘guard.’ It didn’t last long before there was silence once more.
The study appears more and more nefarious, Mycroft is Mycroft, Molly is lovely, and Sherlock has emotions.
“Do you want to see all your work gone to waste?” Moran interrupted, stepping into her personal space, “or do you want your John Watson?”
in the alleyway was really all about? Do you think he will appreciate your little
John preferred to think of it as a doorway to another world, a place bright and fair, full of pirates, rugby, and sponge cake as far as the eye could see. He didn’t tell this to his gran, though.
Jim Moriarty, you say?
He wondered, briefly, if he deserved it.
John, the only thing the British Government excels at is sticking its fat nose into my cases with alarming expediency.” Sherlock huffed, pulling another slide under the metal tines of the microscope. Molly snorted inelegantly next to him, and then covered her mouth as if she realized she should probably behave herself in front of Sherlock’s very powerful older brother.
Suddenly, John remembered his earlier conversation with Julia and Brandy (good god, that was only this morning!? this really was the longest day ever). He remembered the expression on Brandy’s face as she recounted her conversation with the apex Alpha. She said, quite frankly, that it was hard to control herself around him; that she felt overwhelmed and railroaded the entire time. John wondered if Sherlock himself even realized what kind of power he wielded purely from the combination of amino acids and ester bonds that made up his genetic structure. Oh who was John kidding, of course he did.
He swore he thought he saw Marcus smile, even a little, before his body let go completely, eyelids half-closed against the storm.
I am always looking for new people to lament the hiatus and Johnlock hell.

“Thank you, yes, a cuppa and bit of sleep sounds wonderful right about now.”
OTHER: Have you had dealings with them?
besides painfully aroused and desperate.  John didn’t usually do things like this, or even
He wiped his sleeve across his head, aware that he was sweating, though the bleak December air chilled his skin. He must look a mess, but he found he didn’t really care. This wasn’t the first time he was forced to interact with the public while looking ragged and destitute, or worse.
When he finally began his journey up the inordinately wide steps, the elaborately carved double doors swished open, sending a rush of sickly rose-scented air into his face, ruffling his messy curls and drawing a sneer of immediate disgust. A woman, short, with fire red hair (processed in a colour that Sherlock only assumed did not exist in nature but only in hair dye) rushed forward quickly, extending a hand and waving Johnson behind her and towards the front desk.
“Not technically minded are we?” A smile lit upon the apex Alpha’s lips, as if this were all some amusing joke at John’s expense, “Well fear not good doctor, I’m sure I can find the manual back at my flat, if you are amenable.”
, he couldn’t
“I almost don’t care,” the Omega stretched and raised his hands to grasp the man’s head behind his shoulders, running his fingers through his short, spiky strands, “that was amazing. Jesus.”
. He was compromised, didn’t she
So the decision was made, quite early and quickly during his service, that the company needed to be taught a thing or two concerning John Watson.
“No, just Mycroft, if you please – no need to invoke an ages old deity for my sake,” his smile was false, patently false, and not unlike a tiger showing his most valuable asset, his teeth.
on the right side of clean, more or less). He tried not to let it get to him, but there was only so much staring he could take before he averted his eyes and found the carpeted floor immensely interesting. If Sherlock noticed his shame, he said nothing, lost in his own mind as he was.
The moment hung in the air, no one moved. Behind John, Gloria scratched at her sheet, recording the code as effortlessly as sending a Snapchat.
Sherlock pivoted, moving the weight of his body to his right foot, insinuating a knee between John's own. His nose began to move, travelling upward, catching softly on the short, auburn hairs of the Omega's beard (he hadn’t shaved it off yet, and thought only a perfunctory shower for his upcoming meeting would do for now). A shiver made its way down John's arm and legs, ending centrally, a bright, tingling ball of sensation focussed around his groin. This, he could no longer ignore.
I had to cut this chapter in two. It was getting pretty long for an update for me, so I apologize for that as well. I hope to have Chapter 20 up very soon to make up for the wait on this one. BUT THINGS ARE HAPPENING!!! WOOHOO!
stay.
“Did I ever tell you about my daughter, Emily?”
“Let me guess, the more activated genes, the less likely it is to find a suitable Guide donor.”
“Just calm down and go to sleep. It’s alright.” Warm hands continued to pet at the sides of his face. Somehow, it was comforting, and though he would never admit this to anyone (anyone, ever), he let himself relax against her touch.

The Beta placed a thick, lubricated finger to John’s opening, pushing in lightly with a purposeful rocking motion that John knew for certain was
He'd done enough talking about it with his therapist when he returned to London, and fat lot of good that did. John had found more answers and more resolution living underneath that stinking and mildewed bridge than he'd ever found sitting in that bizarrely modern chair in Ella's office.
It held an astonishing array of bottles, canisters, test tubes, beakers, flasks, and pretty much any kind of container one could use for experiments in a lab. The cupboards had seen better days, and John was loathe to open them, assuming he would probably not find food, but something else altogether distressing harboured inside. He managed to keep his hands to himself, as even though he was invited, it wasn’t his place to go digging into others peoples’ personal spaces. It didn’t really surprise the older blond that he could count mad scientist among the list of Sherlock’s many talents; which also currently included detective, invader of personal space, runway model, and all around disgustingly attractive prat.
The voice in his mind was similar to his gran’s, though the accent was all wrong. Still, it was delicate and sweet, weaving through his dreams and pulling his consciousness pleasantly away from the nostalgic depths of his deep and drug-induced slumber.
Each word accompanied a puff of warm, tangy air against his skin, the vibrations tickling his neck as Sherlock made his way to the other side, never stopping in his verbal and physical adulation.
The apex Alpha pressed against John’s wound, causing the Omega to grunt in extra distress.
Sherlock snorted, turning a wrinkled page and moving on to the amenities listed in smart bullet points on the left margin. Oh, how very nice, an indoor heated pool. Lovely. He made a mental note (an oversized post-it firmly adhered to the entrance of his mind palace) to drown himself at the first opportunity.
Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, and Lestrade all suddenly felt like the third, fourth, and fifth wheel in this little gathering, and eventually moved along. Lestrade and Mycroft paired up, exiting out of the door and talking lowly about the case and the repercussions of Irene Adler’s escape. Mrs. Hudson twittered nervously about the entrance to 221A, bemoaningthe fact that she’d already left her best tea serving tray upstairs, and as such was not directly able to make them fresh tea, as the newly properly reunited couple deserved. She vanished into her own apartment, promising tea in a bit, should they wish to wait.
Mrs. Hudson’s warbling, high-pitched voice emanated from the ground floor, gushing and lamenting over the state of poor John Watson. The Omega, his voice a perfect, sweet tenor, answered with mild amusement and many reassurances. A third voice, gruff and loud, soon joined the conversation.
She blinked once and appeared to come back to herself for a moment. A blotchy red flush creeped its way up the sides of her neck, around the rims of her ears, to settle its way onto the apples of her cheeks. When she spoke again, her tone was quite sharp, flustered.
Mycroft. John is home.”
“I mean it Sherlock, you mess this up and it’s back to housebreaking and poor old ladies with stolen purses, yeah?”
Sherlock continued to stare intently at the Omega, his bright tourmaline eyes boring into John’s own, so much so that the he had to look away, his complexion flushed under such overt scrutiny.
“Hmm…895?” Her brow wrinkled attractively, warm brown eyes becoming quite focussed in concentration. She tapped a well-manicured finger to her chin, until she brightened and awarded John with a brilliant smile, “Oh, I remember! We just recently had a medical group switch suites, water damage and flooding you know, some malfunction of the sprinkler system apparently. In any case, we didn’t have any more suites available so we had to re-locate them to one of our larger conference area. It’s just down the way over here,” she shrugged once, a slight look of irritation coming over her perfectly made up face, “I guess they decided to name it Suite 895; would have been nice if they’d decided to tell
“But you already said he was –  insane? A madman? Was this really so surprising?”
Jimmy passed over the blister pack and John popped one of the pills out onto his palm. It was a capsule, clear on one side and opaque orange on the other. Inside he could see tiny little pink spheres (of course it would be
All three men were looking down the street, eyes fixed on something, or someone, else.

made from such an apparatus would be questionable at best. If he was more of a science-minded man he might consider taking a small sample and forwarding it to Sherlock – he might do, actually, if the young man continued on with his (relatively) good behaviour.
John’s head swam with the intense pleasure of it all.

He began to pace in front of his desk now, a slow, meandering affair that suited the pensive expression on his face.
“Well, I think you are a perfect candidate for the study, John.” The woman stated with finality. She lifted herself up from the couch, smoothing her snug white dress to her svelte form. John wondered what kind of imaginary wrinkles she was seeing, as that garment fit her like a glove. Like a very expensive glove that left little to the imagination.
Hello again everyone! So lovely to see you! Heads up, there is smut in this chapter. Smutty smut smut! I am proud of it! After all, this story
Mycroft’s spit-shined shoes clicked noisily on the tiled floor. He looked pensive, and more than a little ill-at-ease as he slid his expensive leather laptop case on an empty metal table adjacent to Sherlock’s ad hoc workstation.
“It’s me, John.”
I love you all!
He wanted someone to explain to him why there was gauze packing in his face, why his head felt so stuffed full that every time he swallowed it throbbed and created a vacuum in his head, and why the procedure involved his face at all when it was supposed to be an implant in his
“Sherlock?” She answered, cupping her mobile closely while pulling at her handbag.
“Yeah, actually,” he inhaled, just a rush of air to artfully cover his lie, “actually, that bit’s going pretty good.”
The silence was deafening, and John’s entire field of vision tilted as he gripped the leathered back of his office chair, fingers diggings furrows into the headrest.
“John,

(for John told him he was dead), could have insinuated himself so neatly into his mind. Perhaps he wasn’t an outside influence after all, and what did that mean?
The chauffeur, who simply went by the name of ‘Johnson,’ tapped briskly on the glass partition, alerting Sherlock to their change in direction and imminent arrival at the Cottage. Sherlock was pleased when he found he’d be travelling with the serious and quiet man, rather than with Anthea (may a plague of carpal tunnel descend upon
The feel of the Alpha’s tongue, slick and seeking, sent shockwaves directly to his neglected prick, which twitched in earnest but couldn’t quite follow through.
“I don’t deny it.” Sherlock spoke at least, his voice rumbling and undulating through the charged air between them. “It was a test, which you passed. Yet another reason why you are fit to be

, his country for some peace - his life for a good night’s rest and one damn day away from the Holmes’.
He remembered the first time he met her, how untouchable she looked dressed all in white and surrounded by expensive things. He remembered her scent: chocolate, vanilla, patchouli…it was quite distinctive. It was just as singular now, but about more intense, a
“Hell
A scratch of nails sounded against the wood, high-pitched and raspy against the painted surface.
The room was cluttered, but clean in a way that suggested everything was placed just so for an exact reason. Some of the shelves were quite dusty, but this Sherlock did not mind, as dust often spoke in elegant ways that people did not.
I owe you.
Now, John had Marcus…and to a lesser degree he had Brandy and Julia, Raz, and all the other unfortunates that floated under his wing, haunting that hollow space beneath his heart.
“Um, yes, well…do you have Hob Nobs?” He looked up at her expectantly, allowing a flicker of hope to gleam in his multi-coloured eyes (women seemed to like that).
accompanied the statement, the sound of the tip of an umbrella thrust down upon the floor to gain attention and interrupt clandestine activities.
“Yes, you and your Detective did your homework,” she flashed a toothy smile, predatory, when John opened his eyes and whipped his head towards her with a wince, “yes, of course I knew about him. One doesn’t make their fortune in London, or misbehaving as I do without rubbing elbows with Sherlock Holmes.”
,” he cried, unconsciously clenching his left fist into his blanket and breathing in through his nose to a count of five, then out to a count of the same.
John hobbled along, though relatively unfamiliar with Westminster as a whole, one did not become homeless and not becoming passingly familiar with London itself. He was unaware however, that he had acquired a very discreet and noiseless shadow.  Sherlock stayed far behind the limping form, his coat collar pulled up and blue scarf wrapped artfully around his long, pale neck. If John hadn’t been so pre-occupied with the events of the day, he might have noticed he had a tail, but Sherlock knew from experience that John was not nearly as observant of his surroundings as he should be.
She grasped the sheaf of paper with the faded receipts, some of them dated as old as several months ago, and some of them as recent as a few days.

. But of course, if you really look at the dumping grounds, you’d realize there is a significant lack of blood. I noticed this right away, of course, but it wasn’t until the death of the man before Jimmy Price that I started to notice a real pattern to the deaths. So, none of them were killed there, obvious. I am certain if we find out
, that he’d failed his Sentinel…
She rolled the tubes back and forth in the air, gently, letting the blood mix with the khaki coloured gel already present in the cylindrical containers. It appeared she was thinking, maybe lost in her own thoughts, or maybe trying to puzzle out how to respond to John’s query.
“Yes. You are a very confident man, Dr. Watson. You had the
“Dr. Wilkes, we’ve a few more applicants lined up outside and I thought I’d help move things along. I figured I can finish up with Mr. Watson while you start on the next?” She held a weathered clipboard close to her body, the metal clip at the top barely keeping the multitude of papers adequately clamped.
He felt very sorry for her, just as he (sometimes) felt very sorry for himself.

have had once, as a child at least), now they appeared dulled; occluded with hardship and worry. While John had long ago resigned himself to no longer think of his person as an object of desire, sexual or emotional, he broke his own heart, staring at his reflection in the rectangular mirror. Who on Earth could, or would, want him now?
Deductions and forensics are difficult, so just suspend disbelief and bear with me here. I really am trying! Please let me know of any typos, continuity errors, or brit-picking issues.
…and all around him the shells rained down like terrifying, hellish Armageddon.
. John, sensing his Alpha’s feral and urgent need for his submission complied, lifting his hips and letting his denims, along with his pants, be torn free from his hips and thrown, almost viciously, across the room to land on the far edge of the couch.
…and it was Sherlock’s fault. It was
That was only a few days ago, and a long stretch of countless hours spent harassing the Met and feverishly checking every CCTV camera for clandestine glimpses of his brother. When he’d found him this time, huddled and lifeless near a rusted skip by the dirty, sandy banks of the Thames, it had almost been too late.
The men shared yet another loaded glance, this time the other one moved his hand in front of his blazer to gently pull back the fabric and reveal a Taser strapped to a loop on his belt.
“I dunno, a few weeks, mebbe a monf or so.” His accent was thick and indicative of some of the rougher, more dangerous area of London.  This unfortunate was not one of John’s usual cronies and he didn’t make his shelter underneath the bridge. He must have been referred by someone who knew John only as the Good Doctor, helper of those who couldn’t help themselves.
If John expected sympathy, perhaps a kind word or a meaningful turn of phrase, he was disappointed (unsurprisingly) when Mycroft only continued to sit in his chair, straight backed and edged in ice.
“You’re familiar with Shopley’s Sentinel/Guide gene mapping grid, right?”
, he relaxed.
“And that is what continues for the next one hour and thirty-five minutes.” He folded his laptop shut with a loud crack.
“Mr. Holmes? Sherlock Holmes?”
His smile quickly fell, however, as his eyes alighted upon an imposing middle-aged Alpha male, and not the object of his burgeoning desire.  The man took John in in one long uncomfortably assessing glare, moving his eyes up and down in an exaggerated motion. He looked disgustingly unimpressed.
“I’m Mrs. Whitney, but please call me Kate,” she continued with an airy laugh, surreptitiously wiping her hand on her smart pumpkin-coloured dress pants. “I’m in charge of new admissions and senior director of our substance abuse program –”

Mycroft sighed, eyes bulging and lips pressing together in a frog-like frown. “I daresay he will probably not notice, since he’ll still be in a great deal of pain and –”
That John could feel all these things about seducing a complete stranger, a boy really, was entirely worrisome. It was probable that the Alpha was only here on orders and truly didn’t mean him any harm (though honestly the Nuremburg defence was really no defence at all), and that was the only thing that prevented the erstwhile soldier from planting a bullet directly into the Alpha’s frontal lobe.
"You are most certainly not
He just hoped he wasn’t already too late.
Mycroft’s face settled into an impassive expression teetering on complete boredom, this, among all things, indicated that John was correct. The wire was no longer an option, not this time anyway.
Huzzah! An update! THE PLOT THICKENS!!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
A bellowing roar of fear and distress split the air as Marcus, cutting quite the intimidating figure, leapt towards the three men still standing. He held his hands out in front of him, fingers contracted in a claw-like threat. It was obvious that he was out for blood, and they’d be lucky if he stopped there.
“It’s been less than forty-five minutes Sherlock.” The blond adopted a tone of voice used to placate angry adults or mollify small children.
“I…I’m not sure there are words…”
He managed to keep it together, taking another few backwards steps towards the hulking glass entranceway of the business centre.
He felt as if he’d been here before, stuck behind the same glass, watching as his younger brother, a gifted Sentinel (the most powerful in a century, or so the instructors at the Tower had said), struggled to pull each and every breath into his oft-abused lungs. He hadn’t needed a ventilator…this time.
He fled the room in such a hurry that even the young woman clicked her teeth. She made an unhappy noise as he shut the door, a rush of stale air blowing back to ruffle John’s fringe. A hint of vaguely floral essence wafted towards John and he took in the other woman fully; she seemed to be a Beta as well.
“And?”
“I have been cruel and secretive to you, I know, I apologize in every way a person can apologize. I will apologize every day for the rest of my life if it means I can have you. If
Irene’s eyes unfocussed once again as she sniffled into her tissue, looking past John as if seeing right through him. Her perfectly formed lips trembled in agony, a fresh bout of tears threatening to ruin what was left of her makeup.
“H as in…?”
“Oh my God,” she breathed, “we…have a result. A suspect, Sherlock!
John blinked and managed to look quite hurt at Sherlock’s last reply. Sherlock himself only expelled a gusty cloud of breath into the chilly air.
When John was but a lad, he used to spend every other summer with his paternal grandmother in Scotland. She was his favourite grandparent by far (which wasn’t really saying much, considering his mother’s parents had passed away before he was born); and had such a voice, like the whispering sound of heather swaying gently on the northern moors.
Then there was John Watson.
And he did go; sleep’s tenacious fingers entwined in Sherlock’s own, locked, gripped and pulled him down into the depths of his mind.
“Alright, alright, enough with it,” Lestrade waved his hands, ushering Sherlock over and away from the other two, “it might be from our killer, but is also might

“Why don’t you try telling him that then, John? What do you think would have happened had I not stopped him?”
, and completely out of touch with current English modernity. He followed behind Mrs Whitney, having already deduced everything of import about the woman(divorced, son also an addict, her job a pathetic attempt to heal others when really she wanted to heal her son), and he was only too glad to leave the overly scented and busy lobby behind. For a retreat that touted the best possible solution for un-bonded Sentinels, their decorative choices were decidedly an attack on the senses. Really, what

Sherlock held his brother to his word.
John smiled, still braced against the entrance. “I didn’t think you would be so dense Sherlock,” he gasped at another strong wood splintering
. John might need to rethink not taking this man up on his lewd and inappropriate fantasy.
“My-Mycro –”
He found he still couldn't meet Sherlock's eyes. Instead, he rested his gaze on the journal before him, hoping against hope they wouldn't have to
Sherlock rushed to John’s side immediately, nosing at his neck and putting both of his hot-warm hands on John’s face. The sensation grounded the Omega as he forced his emotions under control.
Mycroft deigned to return the offered hand, though he did not rise from his seat. Barrymore shifted behind his desk, nervous and hyper alert, clearing his throat as the Dr. Watson sat down and made himself more comfortable.
Irene opened her mouth as if to give an answer, something argumentative to be sure, but then closed it abruptly and left the small room, waves off discontent positively rolling off her person.
"Really? I've worn it on at least three occasions since we've met. The first being my meeting with you in your "office" so to speak, the second being –"
“Alright, fine,” Sherlock deflated slightly, looking fairly childish and caught out, “I am biased.”
Now they sat at the cluttered green kitchen table, staring intensely at each other, neither one wanting to be the first to delve deeper into what just happened and the events of the previous night. Sherlock, besides his swollen cheekbone and irreparably wrinkled dress shirt, appeared stoic and stone-faced. John himself sat with arms crossed and face set with a perma-scowl that might take weeks to resolve.
The other man twisted his head once; a firm shake side to side. He pinched his lips shut, cutting off the blood flow to his lips and making them blanch into one long, thin, white line.
His thigh ached, competing with his shoulder and hip for attention. He didn’t allow himself to linger on his wounds for long; that was too much for him to handle right now. He hadn’t made any significant long-term plans (except to be with Sherlock, of course), only forcing himself to concentrate on getting better and increasing healing and range of movement, and possibly getting rid of the
He didn’t have long to wait.
“But how are we to
John then stretched his slight frame, letting the slightly moistened seat of his pants flex and strain against his buttocks in a subtle but impactful invitation.
Meanwhile, Sherlock pulled out his mobile and rapidly punched in a series of numbers against the touchscreen. When the mobile silently began to ring, and when a familiar voice answered, he plastered a forced smile across his handsome face and spoke with insincere goodwill:
, a syringe or - or morphine. Possibly he had a narcotic even stronger (hydromorphone); something other than the mess of tourniquets, tape and gauze he'd thought would be more useful. If Patterson made it out of here alive, he'd probably lose his legs.
“Yes, well I’ve read the statistics though. There’s no guarantee it’ll work.” The Omega responded, keeping direct eye contact with the woman.
“No. I can hear what you’re thinking it’s so loud, and I’m telling you right now, stop it.”
The woman settled back into the couch as he spoke, leaning one slender arm on the sumptuously padded curve of the raised right end. He thought it odd that she took no notes, just observed him fiercely; much like a naturalist observes a fascinating specimen in the wild.
John looked up abruptly, fancy mobile forgotten in his lap, and laid eyes once more on Sherlock Holmes. He tried to ignore the lurch in his stomach, the flutter of his heart, and the instant beads of sweat that erupted upon his brow. Sherlock cut such a dramatic figure in the doorway, the dim sunlight outlining his person in hazy amber relief; it would be hard not to romanticize his sudden entrance into John’s bungalow, what with his coat and his collar and his
John rocked back and forth, back into himself, and then forward into the void.
, like the sweetest honey.
I love you all! I would never have even gotten this far without all the comments, kudos', and bookmarks. You are angels, wee lil' angels!
It didn’t occur to John to speak just then, only he held Sherlock’s gaze with his own depthless navy blue eyes.
“Alright, you great big ruddy German Shepherd let’s go.” With a playful swat, John gently pushed the man’s head away from the hollow of his neck and limped towards the scarred wooden door.
“Ah, Grant! Excellent!”
It was a miserable two days, before the Omega’s next requisite appointment with the study. John, wracked with fever and night sweats, barely ate and only managed a minimal amount of fluids. He sent Marcus to the chemist with what little money they had, prompting him to buy paracetamol and whatever else the chemist recommended for Flu. When the man returned, John gratefully dry swallowed a few pills, eager for relief, and the chance to feel like a human being, if only just.
He wheezed and grimaced, forcing himself through the pain and fire in his belly, only just managing to stay upright. It was only when John no longer felt the threat of the gun to the back of his head that he realized they were no longer alone.
, for once. His life with Marcus, before Sherlock, had been so hard, and so draining, it was nearly impossible not to continue on as that strong latent Omega still stuck under the bridges with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He could take anything, he could take care of anyone, but in the end he’d failed to save the one man who meant more to him than any other at that time.
“Say it again, Sherlock, it’s lovely.”
“Indeed,” but there was more to that one word than simple agreeance, there was an undercurrent of suspicion John couldn’t easily ignore.
“Don’t be absurd John, I would never
Lestrade and the others fell into hushed whispers and short, angry looks rife with impatience and disbelief. It seemed Donovan and Anderson were arguing a point with their DI, and losing.
“…I know what you’re doing John – what you’re trying to prove. I can see it every time you answer the call. Stop trying to prove yourself to them and start trying-”
“I’ll be late for my appointment. Excuse me.” He simply could not do this right now, and he didn’t raise his eyes to meet the taller man’s gaze.
The Omega returned his laugh and smiled softly.  After a long moment, he sighed. “I need to think about this Sherlock. I mean, what exactly are you asking of me?”
“Jimmy, that’s your name right?” The boy wobbled a bit on his stool in displeased surprise. He had made it quite clear he preferred to remain anonymous during this consultation. That was all well and good (John thought with an inward roll of his eyes), but perhaps he shouldn’t have shown John the blister pack with his name clearly printed along a sticker on the back.
He took a deep breath and got a grip on his considerably running rampant emotions.
“I go with
is taking so long Mycroft? If it was some kind of warehouse full of pies and cherry tarts, we wouldn’t be sat around here twiddling our thumbs! Oh no, you’d be in as soon as you could manage!” Sherlock twirled away from Mycroft’s Partner’s desk, woollen blazer stretching dangerously tight to his lean form.
Sherlock scoffed as he walked, “I don’t have a Guide.”
But the people, all of the
London was just so damn expensive, and even though his depressingly beige little bedsit was subsidized by his pension, it wasn’t a home. With every passing day he watched his bank account dwindle. Of course, there were the monthly stipends. A little ‘Hey thanks for letting us ruin your life, here’s a few pounds,’ thrown his way. But it was like tossing stones and sand into a river, watching it catch the current and float momentarily before disappearing into its watery blue depths. His expenses and debts soon became too much to bear, and with his parents gone and Harry god knows where, he had no one to ask for help. Not that he would.
Well, she could clearly see that this one was also a bit rude as well. Oh, she did always get the good ones, didn’t she?
“Of course, just…lean on me.”
“You’ve called me here to tell me I will be receiving the treatment as soon as possible, if not for my own safety but for your reputation as well. Surely it doesn’t look well on an expensive retreat such as this to have its newest guest zone within an hour of arriving. What
“So what happened to Irene then?” He questioned, pulling the folder to his lap and opening it up, loose sheets of paper falling with gravity onto his thighs.
“What the
“A colleague?!” The woman, Sally, scoffed incredulously, “…how do
“Well, vaguely. I mean, it’s not something I come across quite often as a GP.” John did not like where this combination was going
“What did you say to Marcus that night that he attacked me?”
He minimized the app, opened his texts, and snorted into the empty, dim room. Of course it would be Sherlock, demanding his time regardless of whether or not the Omega was actually available. He read carefully through each line and was about to text his own, plodding, reply (keyboards weren’t really his thing), when Dr. Adler appeared once more.
“What do you want?”
She trailed off at that, looking at Sherlock with wide eyes.
They’d left John in the church, and though Sherlock would have preferred to do anything
needed to keep track of his daily amount); hoping against hope that it would at least keep his symptoms controlled enough to make it through the appointment without too many questions. He wasn’t sure what was going to happen today (if anything), and while he had support in the way of Mycroft’s ubiquitous governmental omnipotence, it still felt suspiciously like he was walking to his own doom.
Anderson shot a sharp, questioning glance to Lestrade, who answered with one of his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
The emphasis on the word ‘lick’ left John with a more than vivid understanding of Wilkes’ thought process. The itchy, hot flush in his abdomen abruptly ceased, leaving his skin cold and pale.
As if that wasn’t enough, Sherlock continued with his tirade, unable to view his words as anything but truthful…and uncaring that these words, even if they were the truth, could hurt just as much as a sniper bullet in enemy territory.
Sherlock had finally arrived, and God knows what he’d think when he saw John standing in the middle of the living room trembling  like some kind of willing sacrifice to the six foot tall god of logic and sex.
“I…I’ve…” John tried to stand but for some reason his legs simply would not work (useless things), what good were they if not for walking John about when his brain so commanded it?
happened, Sherlock
Exactly in that order.
The buzz in his brain was never-ending, a cottony miasma he couldn’t quite force his way through. He remembered flashes of lights, vague, blurry shapes, and a voice.  There was only one voice, a soft, warm tone that spoke only to him in kind words of reassurance and stability.
Brandy wiped at her face messily, smearing black eyeliner in one long streak from her right eye to ear.  Julia smiled, and wiped at it affectionately.  “I still love you, you know. You just make
Good. Now you know why you decided to be who you are, and you can’t let some pretty-eyed Alpha ruin the equilibrium you cried and fought so hard for.
“No!” He shouted, though it was garbled and slurred. “G-get it out! I want –
, do you mean making a mockery of modern investigation, or were you and your team just being blissfully witless, as
Each data set presented itself in complete and savage clarity - Brandy and Julia, sombre and despondent, clutching each other with wan faces - Detective Lestrade, tired and overworked, as only a Detective Inspector of the Metropolitan Police force could – Sally Donovan and her erstwhile lover, the weaselly Anderson, spoke lowly while she desperately tried to wrangle the gathering crowds and onlookers.
!” She shouted, her shoulders collapsed and face a watery grimace. Julia took a half-step forward, possibly rethinking this entire encounter, but John beat her to it.
“Molly’s already working on the dental records; she will find Marcus’ family.”
, Sherlock please. Just do it. We’ve waited so long…I want it,
“We can – or I can – deduce from John’s own actions that he found himself alone, in a place that not many people were privy too. Perhaps there was a situation, something unexpected, and he chose to take advantage. You can tell by the multitude of photos, practically dozens, that he was taking as many as he could without any regard as to what information they contained – my clever, clever John.”
She rolled a chair up to his stretcher, its wheels making low noises on the ground, then sat down gracefully with a whisper of clean white linen against the elegant crossing of her legs.  With this movement came a wave of scent so powerful, it was all John could do not to retch with the mere strength of it.
John shook his head clear for a moment, the cooling night air helped immensely. It was a long way to the bridge, and he had no money for a cab. In fact, he remembered quite clearly, his last few notes had found their way into Marcus’ hands for lunch. John hoped that even though he had had nothing to eat this evening, Marcus wouldn’t make himself go without. He feared the simple man would; it would be his way, without John there to prompt him.
Sally Donovan never did take Sherlock up on his offer. Nor did she apologize for dumping the dubious curry the Cottage offered as “food" onto his lap. She took one long look at Sherlock after his cryptic statements and made a face one could call murderous and left in a huff of wounded pride.
It was too, too much. Nauseating.
John’s movement caught Sherlock’s eye, as he had immediately returned his attention back to the microscope after the Omega’s last comment, and he raised his head up sharply. A fleeting look of concern lit upon his face, but it was gone almost as soon as it began. The Alpha straightened and cleared his throat, obviously wanting John’s attention.
. “At least…at least come back to Baker Street with me. It’s warm, and I have a spare bedroom you-”
“Well…we’re not really at your flat of course, this is just your Mind Palace. But, I do live here now.”
“You’re not here.” He wasn’t, not really. Sherlock had spent many hours fortifying his palace against outside intruders, and he found it slightly disturbing what it meant that this man, this
“I’m sorry we were unable to find you before…before all this. Marcus never talked much about his family.”
"Stop, don't ruin it, love." He whispered, catching the taller man in an impromptu kiss, sucking his plump lower lip between his own. Sherlock's eyelids fluttered, caught off-guard as he was to his own Omega's forwardness. John's honey and caramel scent whispered its way past his brain to his groin, then to his knees, loosening each joint as if Sherlock would fall down in front of this man in supplication.
Now, this

The Omega wasn’t sure how much more of this he could take.
Both, probably.
"Doc…I – I mean Captain John, I mean Watson…I – I –" The man sputtered, saliva and dirt mixing into muddy globules below his face.
“It’s not about sex, Irene,” he spat, disgusted, “why do you always think it’s about
Together, they could rule the world, the perfect pair that they were.
As they neared John’s sleeping spot, both Omegas could hear the low, rippling rumble of Sherlock’s decadent voice as it bounced along the stone surfaces. The space underneath the arches gave sounds an otherworldly, echoing quality that sent shivers down the good doctor’s spine. John pictured Sherlock in his mind’s eyes for a moment and sighed inwardly. It just wasn’t fair that someone looked and sounded like that. What was an ordinary person supposed to do? How could they compete when someone had thousands of years of genetics and breeding on their side? They couldn’t, that’s how.
“I’m sorry…you just scared me is all. I am scared for John. Who knows where we would be right now if we never met him?”
…” A whisper, almost heartbroken, upset, and the Omega only had one second to move away –
He closed his eyes, breath stuttering from his mouth in short gasps of disbelief and revelation. He no longer felt afraid; he couldn’t feel anything else but the searing touch of the man in front of him. The man whose hands now fluttered slowly away from his neck and bicep, down the vertical plane of his torso, to settle in a propriety grip at his flank. They were only an inch or so above the fleecy edge of the towel, and for one brief moment, John thought he might actually rip the thin barrier away from his hips. He flushed at the thought, ruddy stains of vascularization making his face burn and his nipples stiffen in unconscious response. In the back of his mind (and to his eternal mortification), he felt his cock stir, the heretofore only teasing, tingling sensations coalescing into turgid, hot, hard flesh.
