“I think he’s being deliberately obtuse,” Mary says with a little shrug. “I think the alternative would unbalance his whole world.”
“I didn’t offer it,” Sherlock says, “You don’t need forgiveness, John. I manipulated the situation and deliberately provoked you into beating me so that I could get put into that hospital- why should you apologize for doing exactly what you were meant to do?” John scowls at him, arms folded across his chest, but is silent. “You didn’t do anything that I didn’t deserve.”
Sherlock hates that John sees exactly what he was doing but fails to understand why. He could keep it up only so long before the plates would wobble, but until then, Sherlock insists it’s fun.
Violet listened, from the pace of his footfalls he was striding quickly, so he might not be lying.
He starts and aborts no fewer than seven texts before settling on;
Sherlock wasn’t sleeping when he heard the knock on the door and he decidedly did not fall off the sofa in his frantic attempt to deduce his late night visitor. It was raining so the knocking was urgent. Not a client though, didn’t ring the bell, suggesting that it was someone who knew Sherlock would be awake but Mrs. Hudson would be sleeping. Then above the rain he heard the plaintive wail of a young child. The pieces slotted neatly into place as Sherlock whispered “Oh!”
Mary hugged him around his shoulders from behind and rested her head on his.
John scowled. He hated this feeling, like he’s the only one waiting for the penny to drop. Sherlock and Mary both did this to him. They loved to lord it over him that he was of average intelligence. He found it especially irksome that Mary had swooped in and immediately assumed she knew Sherlock better than he- especially when she had intentionally put a bullet in his chest, just months ago. And now to sit smugly across from him, adorable and soft in her robe with her morning hair, and assume she would know what was best for Sherlock.
“Sherlock!”
Sherlock gratefully pulled the pack of cigarettes that were weighing heavily from his pocket. He slid one out of the pack and gently pinched it between his lips while he fumbled for his matchbook.
“No, of course not, but it would be nice.”
“In America wasn't it? Chicago?”
“No?”
“Come on, Sherlock,” John said, “You can tell if it’s going to be a disaster just by a glance. I could use your help.”
Without discussing it, the two began to walk, as they had several times in his youth, no particular destination in mind, just strolling along the hedgerows toward the village. He marked familiar milestones as they passed, glancing furtively at his father, who strolled with his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes fixed somewhere vaguely up ahead.
“He was so angry,” Sherlock says, wishing desperately for a cigarette, “I doubt he’ll ever fully forgive me.”
“Yes. I know.” She muttered, silver spoon chiming quietly against the porcelain.
She moved off toward the bedroom, leaving John even more perplexed. He pushed his food around his plate with his fork, no longer hungry.
“It’s closer to your clinic,” Sherlock states, and John opens his mouth to protest, but Sherlock presses on, “Mrs. Hudson can watch Watson while you’re at work so you’d be saving money. No more experiments in the kitchen,” he blurts. John looks sad. This is a bad sign the only thing worse than being on the receiving end of John’s fury was being pitied by him. Sherlock fumbles for words, trying valiantly to appeal to John’s logic. “I know you’ve got Rosie to worry about now.”
“He has!” Sherlock’s voice alarmingly close to a wail, “He has John!”
John laughs despite himself, “Oh God, I’ve broken you.”
“What I mean Sherlock, is that if I move back in, this is it for me. I won’t leave again. Rosie deserves a family- one she can count on to be there.  You’ve confided a great trust in me today, and I wish I could give you more to go on, but I mean. It’s a process right? … So- ya. This, “he gestures between them, “Whatever it turns out to be, is it . . . if you’re ok with that.”
As the two exits the bedroom, Rosie toddles quickly toward Sherlock and John does his best to ignore Mrs. Hudson’s knowing and satisfied smile. Sherlock hefts the chubby toddler up into his arms and she presses a sticky kiss to his cheek.  John can’t help but to beam at the pair as he imagines the future, ripe with possibility.
“Somewhere else? What?! You want me to jump off the car?! … It always amazes me how you can be an even bigger dick-head every time. Seems almost effortless. Don’t you dare call me the next time you have nightmares.” – and he opened the door and jumped.
And it was all too much, he kissed and swallowed; swore his tongue had life on its own and was never more eager to trace every single inch of Sherlock’s face; the feeling was mutual, Sherlock cupped John’s cheeks, pulling his short hair as best as he could; shifting forward so their cocks could be closer. He took both of them in one hand and began moving. They took a few seconds to get in perfect synchrony between their rubbing and Greg’s still deep thrusts.
John and Greg looked at him in disbelief.
“Yes, love … it’s working.” – and closed his eyes.
“We can always take a nap or….”
“I’ve … been told”.
“Meaning?"
“I’m ok. I’m just tired…”
The memory of a nearly broken arm from underestimating John Watson's complexion sometimes still haunted him.
“Sherlock, please tell me you picked something nice for her… please, you have tons of coats; give her one of the good ones for the charity” – said Watson annoyed, he already knew the answer that was coming.
Mycroft spoke through gritted teeth.
Sherlock grunted as his eyes rolled back for a split second. He was getting used to the incremental pain sensation and made a mental list of new and more savage ways to take revenge when it was Lestrade’s turn. His thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of steps rapidly approaching behind him and putting the same leather belt who had just hit him, in his mouth parting his lips aggressively prohibiting him from speaking. Lestrade secured it with more violence than needed. Sherlock could feel how the DI trapped a bit of his hair just for the sake of punishing him a little more.
Both kept
His words were muffled by the expertise of someone who enjoys the lack of shame, in one long move, Greg sucked Sherlock. The delicate and thin member quickly found its way down his throat to the bottom, leaving a salty trail on Greg's tongue. It wasn't that long; it left enough room to stick his tongue out each time his lips returned to the base of the penis. His saliva slowly began to trickle into the crevice between Sherlock's legs, a slow promise of what would come if he managed not to come in the next ten seconds.
“Then go speak out loud somewhere else!” – shouted at John.
– there it was.
– and held him by the hair with both hands, knowing how his Adam’s apple bounced every time he swallowed at John’s touch. Pulling with one hand and caressing his forehead with the other –
With what little grace and dignity he had left after his pants decided it was time to quit formalities, Mycroft rummaged among art-supplies. A leather-covered sketchbook, several charcoal pencils and a Meisterstück Mont-Blanc served him as a shield. A thin layer of sweat hurdled his increasingly tensing body, while he rolled up his sleeves.
pleaded Sherlock.
The session could have declared its conclusion, at least called off for the day. Everything has a limit, even outbursts of repressed unbridled lust.
” – he was interrupted by an unexpected spit landing right on his left cheek.
“Ok, this is getting annoying Sherlock … repeat after me … MY-CROFT” – said out loud as he stood up from his desk. Books spread all over. He stood at the door frame looking for the little kid that called him incessantly all day long.
Naked, he felt John carefully lift him on his chest so he could have better access to the nape of his long neck, nuzzling and inhaling.
Mycroft started to undress himself.
- rarely, Sherlock Holmes felt as guilty as when he put John in uncomfortable situations due to his recklessness.
“Were you naked?”
than the service personnel, whom by the way, I'm almost certain were forbidden to speak to us more than strictly necessary” Sherlock’s voice dropped a tone, “apparently, silence was the best motivator for the development of our greater intellect and concentration.”
They could have sworn that a heavenly choir sang in unison, giving them a standing ovation for such a wonderful performance in the name of art … of course.
“You burned it.” Greg interrupted.
John shifted to Sherlock's other leg, bringing it up to his shoulder, engulfing his shaft in one quick movement, making Sherlock's head fall back and abandon the almost burnt cigarette.
- and immersed himself in Lestrade’s crotch, undoing his trousers and pulling down his pants; it was already leaking.
He tilted his neck a bit leaving space for Sherlock to manoeuvre. Sherlock tickled with the tip of his nose and then his tongue, all the way up John’s shoulder to the beginning of his hairline, making a small pause to nibble his earlobe.
He kissed Sherlock.
“And I didn’t ask what you need; I asked if you WANT something.”
” – he laughed and sipped his coffee.
“Then stop pestering me and keep looking, pompous git!”
“Great, but you're not getting the fancy green bottled one.”
"Then move aside."
“I’m sorry; we don’t care, he doesn’t care, it’s nobody’s business but Mycroft, the part where we need your help ‘cause Sherlock burned down a 90-year-old man’s house is unfortunately true. We need you to finish a painting, you’ll only have a month, this poor guy took about three years, but now it’s reduced to a pile of ashes. Can you do it?”
“Is that code for public displays of "affection" in a shitty petrol station bathroom?”
They looked perplexed in all directions; Mycroft had not painted one but 17 pieces!
"Oh my…"
He approached his briefcase and pulled out a pair of black leather gloves, he adjusted them while smiling at the sole image of what was coming. He also gave one pair to John and another to Lestrade.
"Don’t do that mind palace shit right now; I need you to walk unsuspiciously fast.”
Mr Saunders, a painter in his mid-80's, laid restless in the stretcher; waving his burned hands, yelling and whining incomprehensible statements on Sherlock, Lestrade and John's direction. The paramedics' futile struggles to calm him only made him angrier. Each sob was a statement on how his case was solved but his life ruined.
"If anyone gives a shit on what I think and how I feel, I just wanna say that as long as no-one tickles me, I'm in."
“… sparkling water?”
“Yes, very much, wouldn't happen to have a spare coat, would you?”
Sherlock's eyes blazed open, panting with his swollen cock throbbing. His head still rested on John's wounded shoulder.
"Shhh! Shut up! Don’t talk; you'll ruin the mood.”
Mycroft stopped scribbling, astonished. When did the three most scattered and seemingly self-sacrificing dramatic people in the world had turned into degenerate Neanderthals fucking on his expensive sheets? It was not a complaint, just a modest observation.
“No.”
Sherlock held on John’s arm holding his neck, while John’s other hand ventured into Sherlocks mouth to lubricate itself.
Yes, the Holmes definitely were mind-readers.
"No, I do remember you, my sweet cherub." a sudden feeling of nostalgia filling him, "We'll start with you."
His long fingers reached up Sherlock's neck, sliding up along the crests in his skull, digging thumbs on his soft temple. Holding fiercely and massaging at the same time. A silent battle of shallow breaths and narrow stares.
“This’ll take just a second, do you want anything?”
John seemed exhausted; content but tired.
– and gently brushed his cheek while kissing him softly. Sherlock’s breathing was coming back to normal, tired but pleased.
Sherlock laughed as well, tangled in a mess of feels and wrinkled clothes.
They decided to take a cab to Baker Street for the sake of their safety and to pick up a few things John still hadn’t retrieved. As they got to the flat, a very drunk Sherlock Holmes tried miserably to hit the key in the lock, until a very exasperated John snatched it and opened it himself.
“Oh, yeah! Besides, I’ve always wanted to fuck next to a dying stoned bum.”
John came from the back emptying a wine bottle down his glass, blushing fiercely.
His thoughts were interrupted by a voice calling him from what seemed like miles away as he was pulled back in the direction of his house.
John stood up suddenly, anger filling his features, and threw a long-forgotten cup of tea at the wall. Leaving a trail of broken porcelain as it fell to the ground.
"Bigger than the
"Stop", ordered Mycroft.
– he could’ve going on and on with the list, but a very unamused Sherlock just pushed the door and it opened.
instructed, and Greg and Mycroft obeyed. He was using his “doctor voice”.
Sherlock's body gave its last spams as he fell limp onto his back, arching involuntarily at the leverage provided by John's still tied hands.
“Are you starting to become an art admirer?”
chance arose, it would be unwise not to exploit the benefits."
"No. I don't enjoy altruism and a month is such a short time to complete an acceptable piece."
“Did that happen to you?” – Sherlock interrupted him.
- sighed John.
“Mycroft would disagree with such a bold statement”.
“Now that I think about it… I could be a great prostitute.”
Silence elongated for a minute longer, but their gaze never fell Realising that his efforts to continue the sensual vibe would be futile, he returned to his position next to John, face-up facing the ceiling ... indeed, it was a very interesting damp stain.
“I’m sorry?”
“I made hot chocolate” – Sherlock was carrying two steamy cups awfully decorated with whipped cream and a strange smiley face made with tiny marshmallows – “Mrs. Hudson gave me the recipe”.
– Sherlock whispered.
Lestrade's face was steel focused on the two men above him when a small transparent bottle landed just next to his hand. He popped the lid and spread a fair amount in his hand, began teasing Sherlock.
“I said no.”
– both shouted as Sherlock pulled out a knife stabbed himself in the chest right in front of their shocked gazes.
"Meaning I won't lick dripping ice-cream from inside anyone's…"
” – Sherlock grabbed him by the wrist, kissing his shoulder.
– Lestrade scolded them.
Greg finally slipped out and watched with tremendous pleasure as John leaned back to fuck fiercely as he stroked Sherlock's cock.
"Fine!" sulked Sherlock, "I would've gone for sex-dungeon, but the alternative is quite picturesque."
Sherlocks shouts were echoed by the sound of him pissing.
As he got up and walked to the drawer, his mind kept repeating ...
He rolled over and pushed Sherlock down to the carpet again, pulling off his trousers and parting up his legs, leaning to lick the wet fabric over Sherlock’s prick. His legs muscles were contracting at Johns touch. John tucked Sherlock’s pants down, and gently sucked one of his testicles, swinging it all around his mouth as Sherlock arched his back against the floor, squirming. John let it go and held Sherlock’s hips firmly to prevent him from thrusting against him.
And with a final smile he reached down to help Sherlock produce those 500mg of well needed protein.
“But… what happened when…?”
“John don’t resist it … I’m going to hug you until all your broken parts stick back together. You will never feel alone again as long as I’m here.”
Two bay windows, framed by terracotta walls, reflecting the sun-fall as specks of dust woke up to welcome them into the enclosure; on the walls, several racks filled with blank canvases as if asleep under the effects of paint thinner. The wooden floor creaked as they explored every corner of a part of Mycroft that until that moment, all were oblivious of (kind of).
If I say
A symphony of crashing glass, banging tables and shouts could be heard from the street were Lestrade’s constable kept waiting for them, only 3 minutes had passed … they still got time. He nervously tried to light a cigarette but rectified after deciding that it would be a long night, in which it would be prudent not to be under the influence of more stimulants. He pulled out a pack of gum from his other pocket and waited.
closed his eyes for a moment while they shared a chaste kiss.
“Sherlock, I love you … so, so much … can’t you tell?” – said a he rested his head above Sherlock’s curls.
They remained laying on the hardwood floor, panting, naked, soaked in the afterglow of what they can proudly catalogue as mind-blowing intercourse. No, that’s such a dull way to call the utter nerve-wracking fuck both have accomplished.
I forgot for a second about the damn painting...
- - -
He pulled Sherlock to a sitting position stripping him from the remaining of his clothes with timed precision. Instinctively, Sherlock wrapped his ankles around John's waist, using both hands to leverage and offer himself to be (
After being completely sure that he could not have prepared the man in front of him better, Greg slowly got up, gently stroking John’s thighs, lining up and inserting himself just a few inches, horribly slow, before beginning to fuck him brutally. Each thrust was faster and deeper than the last. Greg made sure to raise the angle a little higher with each lunge, knowing he was hitting just the right spot to break John.
Mycroft instructed. Sherlock started to undress himself; pulling off his scarf and coat, then took off one shoe at a time. He looked annoyed but expectant, it wasn’t supposed to be his turn this time, he already had planned all he wanted to do to John. He even made a checklist. With bullet points.
“Home.”
John was still holding Sherlock by the shirt, pinning him down. His lips went fiercely toward the curve of his neck as his hands unbuttoned the excited man's shirt beneath him, exposing a perfect silky white torso. John would lie if he said he hadn't dreamt of doing this on repeated occasions. He instinctively rubbed himself against Sherlock's rising erection, pulsing uncomfortably below him, not daring to retrieve his lips from the spot where he was nibbling at that precise moment; not able as well to trace a long lick up to Sherlock's earlobe. He tasted sinfully sweet.
Yes, life had been extremely generous with him asking only as payment, a youth dedicated to sports where the use of extremely tiny shorts was practically mandatory.
“As in someone’s trying to get revenge and murder us behind an alley,
John came in hard waves over Sherlock’s hand, cuddling himself on Sherlock’s arms as he smiled in content. Sherlock lifted his slick hand staring at John’s spill covering it. He spread it all over like moisturising lotion and licked his thumb to taste more of John.
– shrugged Sherlock.
- and closed his eyes for a second before looking back straight to John’s eyes.
– Sherlock spoke, clearly realizing why John was spending so much time cataloguing the scent –
Mycroft endured the pain of Sherlocks clutch, rocking him trying to ease away the pain. Once again, he was twelve and Sherlock five, crying over how his knee hurt because he fell riding his bike, only this time Mycroft couldn’t do anything to stop the pain.
“Sorry?”
“I’d love to do that, but we rented the car with your credit card. I’ll be accused of murder if I leave you here, idiot… c’mon” – Sherlock stood up; started to walk back to the car.
Mycroft slowly placed the mobile on the table and laced his fingers. It was done, although he would lend himself to this ridiculous request, he wasn’t going to fall prey to negotiation with terrorists. His demands would be heard.
– responded Sherlock, receiving the cup, blowing into it to cool it a bit and take a sip.
, mouthed Greg, still smiling.
“Oh! … no, and that quite a good story actually-” his mouth opened and closed while sorting his options,
“Fun for who? Is it strategizing?”
"Ah, fuck…"
As for Mycroft, if it only had been any other person, such question would’ve brought him out of his depths, but since it was the well-known insufferable human he was raised with, it was nothing more than a regular oddity.
– said still kissing his neck – thinking out loud
– said a still giggling Mycroft while pulling up the car window.
– Mycroft soft spoke reaching a hand out to Sherlock.
When John’s knees hit the floor, he tried to distract himself, remembering that if all went well, maybe then he and Sherlock could have dinner and fuck in the men's room again.
It was nowhere to be found.
, quite the opposite of the lifeblood of the job he loved so much.
Lestrade decided it was a wise time to approach and sat next to Mycroft on the floor.
“Which of the 6 bedrooms?” Sherlock was not willing to waste time.
dripping coke on the marble.”
Only one safe place in that cold, sad house served to take refugee; his own mind… and probably the kitchen, mostly his mind while standing next to the sink pouring scotch. Maybe it was one of those days when it was absolutely admissible to become monstrously pedestrian and drink straight from the bottle.
"What do you mean?"
After several passcode words and security verifications were given, a baffled Anthea assured him she would do her best to keep everything in order and being instantly promoted to James-Bond level PA. Only after Mycroft assured her over twenty times, he was not being kidnapped, nor it was a trick, the call ended.
said a panting Greg.
He smiled.
"You all right?" came John's whisper.
snorted Greg.
“Just go and let me die already” – Watson was laying back on the pavement; only had a minor scratch on the hand.
He was still breathing hard, but that last sentence made him look straight into the eyes of his partner, there was a special touch of tenderness in Sherlock Holmes apologizing. It might not be much for other people, but the way his chest felt warm made up for any misunderstanding.
"Not yet."
His considerations were interrupted at the sight of the perfect curve Greg's glutes formed as he undressed, immutable to everyone's piercing looks.
“I never considered the idea of "going for a walk" was really a perfect opportunity to practice theft.”
What someone would typically expect from an older brother is that he would dedicate himself in life and soul to protecting his siblings, especially someone like Sherlock; fortunately, Mycroft boasted of being a terrible older brother in Sherlock's own words. Greg had no trouble reading between the lines the nod he received.
“I know,” Sherlock muttered. He couldn’t bear to look at his brother now. Emotions were never Sherlock’s strong suit and now, feeling things perhaps more acutely than he ever had in his life, they threatened to overtake him. The fact that his nosy older brother could still read him so acutely was infuriating. He hadn’t felt this raw and exposed since the wedding. He’d left early, completely forgetting his violin behind and retreated to Baker Street, knowing that he’d have at least a few blissfully silent hours to ruminate on things before Mrs. Hudson would stumble in, only to find Mycroft sitting in John’s chair reading a book. All it took was one look from Mycroft for Sherlock to feel about eight years old again.  They hadn’t spoken, but they rarely ever did on “danger nights” as Mycroft so dramatically liked to call them. They sat, Sherlock poured them a drink, and they spent the rest of the evening in silence. At some point, Sherlock must have dozed off, because in the morning Mycroft was gone but his Stradivarius was on the kitchen table.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mary says with a twinkle in her eye, “I know you wouldn’t. That’s not why we’re here.”
“Sherlock,” John gently prompted, his voice sounded a million miles away, “Come back to me.”
“You didn’t answer your mobile, the first time. You always answer your mobile.”
Siger Holmes glanced at his son knowingly, but remained silent.
John cannot help the irrational swelling of pride that he, of all people, would spark an interest to the great, impenetrable fortress that was Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock distained sentiment and all things associated with distracting sentiment. To have fallen victim to it himself, well, John can now see why it would put Sherlock into a dither make him not himself.
She smiles and it’s bright and humor crinkles the corners of her eyes.
Sherlock’s expression is naked apprehension and it’s like punch to John’s solar plexus.
John, who had, for good reason, tried valiantly to forget the incident, suddenly heard Moriarty’s lilting voice turn cold as he threatened to burn the heart out of him.
“I didn’t press charges.”
Mycroft then changed the subject to Father’s health, their local parish fundraiser, and their upcoming trip to the Netherlands. Violet appreciated his efforts at small talk, but knew he was anxious to be back to work, so she let him go with an air kiss and cheerful goodbye.
Sherlock clears his throat, “Good.”
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John seethed fiercely, taking Sherlock’s face in his small hands and forcing the detective to meet his gaze, “He has not defeated you-"
Seconds slogged by like minutes as Sherlock desperately tried to piece together the fragments of his thoughts. He felt reality slipping under him like shifting sand. On the one hand he knew he should say something quickly, put John’s mind at ease, but he did not know how to form words any more.
It was a dreary sort of afternoon, which suited Sherlock fine. The cloud’s oppressive darkness matched his mood, and an easterly wind came biting. He crammed his hands down deep into the pockets of his Bellstaff coat and frowned at the rolling green hills. A few feet away, frowning in much the same manner, his father stood, observing the sheep in the neighbor’s pasture.
In the end, Sherlock did not go to Florida, he endured the miserable week of detoxing in a super-secret facility somewhere just outside of London, thanks to Mycroft. Ridiculous, if you asked Sherlock, that a facility should cost so much more but the hospital gowns were no less irksome, the food no less bland, and the staff no less ignorant than the local A&E would have provided.  The shaking and sweating had finally abated, but he felt weak and miserable, unable to focus and unable to face John again after that embarrassing display of… emotions. Mycroft had encouraged Sherlock to stay for the full ninety days, but Sherlock was convinced that once the drugs left his system he’d be fine. He did not have a drug addiction. It was much worse than that, but unfortunately his problem was not so easily remedied by a 12 step program.
“But why would he need armor to face me?” John asked, “It’s me.”
“Did I get it wrong?” John asked quietly.
“Right. Ya,” John nodded, “well thank God for her, huh?”
John gently rubs Sherlock’s back in what he hopes is a comforting way. Sherlock sniffs and raises his head.
“Moriarty knew,” Sherlock said.
Mary hands Rosie over to Mrs. Hudson after the christening and crosses the room to where Sherlock is furtively texting away.  Molly and Greg are chatting with John as Mary sidles up beside the detective.
Sherlock pointedly looks away and Molly withdraws her hand. She knows he empathizes, and it is enough.
“You’re resigned,” Molly says with a shake of her head, “There is a difference.”
His mobile buzzed in his pocket and he reached in; it was a text from John.
Sherlock looks wrecked, John thinks guiltily as he watches his friend’s eyebrows lift in concern. Over the last few years he’s become quite adept at deductions himself. The shadows under Sherlock’s eyes indicate that he hasn’t slept much, as per usual. But, his hair is sticking out at all angles. He’s been thrusting his hands into it again, which he only does when he’s very agitated. He can’t keep still, even sitting and waiting for John to speak, his hands are fluttering, pulling at a fraying thread on his robe, Sherlock is buzzing with nervous energy,  but not like he’s been using again, thank God. John thinks Mycroft has secretly bugged the flat again. He shouldn’t have left this conversation so long. He should know by now that Sherlock Holmes left to his own devices for too long makes the man crazy.
Mary clasps her hands together and gazes down at the vivid green of the grass.
Sherlock scoffs and turns away to look at the church as some of the guest begin leaving down the other walkway toward the street where the cars are parked. Molly in her swing dress, adorned with roses in honour of her god-daughter, pauses to greet an older couple that Sherlock doesn’t recognize.
“Sherlock,” John cuts in with a warning tone.
“Extremely.”
“Rosie is with Mrs. Hudson.”
Tomorrow.
The admission leaves Sherlock bereft, even though it doesn’t surprise him, and even though he should be used to watching John leave the flat, it still stings. John belongs in 221B- from the moment John surprised Sherlock by actually showing up to look at the place, Sherlock knew it.
Instead of leaving a message she called back.
“You’re terrified,” Sherlock said plainly, hardly taking a moment to breathe before launching into his deductions. “Could be because this is the first date you’ve attempted since Mary died, more likely because the stakes are higher than you’re used to. You’ve been to the gym three times this week and after work today, which explains why you were so late coming home. You changed your clothes there, obviously you’re eager to go- don’t let me keep you.”
Sherlock clicks back on line with a startled little gasp.
“Get to work,” Mycroft said, “Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Sherlock.”
“Gregory Lestrade, and yes, though not as many cases as he’d like. He can be recalcitrant.”
“What do you mean?” John demanded, a little more forcefully than he had intended. Mary tapped away with her thumb on her screen for a few more minutes before looking across the breakfast table with a quirk of her eyebrow.
“I didn’t mean…”
“I will,” He tells Molly. “Thank you.”
“And you know all about rehab, do you?” John scoffed and was met with a pointed look from Mary which seemed to remind him that there were volumes he didn’t know about her, and probably never would. He cleared his throat uncomfortably and took a bite of toast.
“He hasn’t left the flat, hasn’t changed out of his pajamas, and he’s diving me mad with his violin. The same tune over and over. The neighbors are complaining.”
“What?”
He shuffled quickly inside, fat raindrops sliding down the back of his neck into his shirt collar. The car was instantly warm and steamy. John closed his eyes as Rosie began to settle again, curiously surveying her new surroundings.
John watched Sherlock rattle off deductions with an expression teetering on the edge of amusement.
“In your room in a fold away cot.” He replied, and then added, “Mrs. Hudson…”
“I’m happy for you.” Sherlock says with a smile, Molly demurs and smiles happily.  “You don’t have to be worried for me, Molly. I’m fine,” She looks skeptical, raising one eyebrow. Damn, she knows him too well. “Really, I am content.”
Molly’s arm slipped from its place around his shoulders and she withdrew a pace.
“That is, if the offer still stands.”
“I’ve seen this before,” she says.
“People call you a freak and a psychopath, but you’re not. You never were. But all along, right beside you was the real monster.”
The gravel path crunched rhythmically under their feet as their steps fell into synch. Sherlock was content to listen to their footfalls, punctuated occasionally by the call of a thrush in the hawthorns or the scampering of the voles in the long grass at the side of the path.
“But you’ve got me,” John said, as though it were a perfectly reasonable argument, “remember? The two of us against the rest of the world, right?” The hurt in Sherlock’s eyes made John’s stomach feel hollow and cold. Sherlock didn’t believe him.
“Oh Sherlock,” she muttered to herself, shaking her head. Her youngest son was the source of constant worry. Still, eviction was hardly the worst thing he had faced this year. “It wasn’t the … narcotics again, was it?”
“Sherlock,” Siger said as they pushed open the gate, “We do enjoy our time with you. Your mother-“ he paused, thoughtfully, “Well, she doesn’t say, but she misses you. I know you’re busy in London with the work and your friends…”
“I meant it, you know,” Molly interrupts him, putting her hand over his on the table. “I do love you. I do, Sherlock. It’s a funny thing, that love can take so many forms. Even though I knew it was hopeless, there is a part of me that will never be completely past you.”
“He misses you.”
“Of course it does, John.” Sherlock says, looking a little bewildered.  “Of course. This is your home for as long as you want it.”
“I’m sick with it, Sherlock,” he confesses hoarsely, eyes on the peeling ceiling, “That I’m capable of inflicting that kind of pain on the person I… on my best friend. Sherlock, I can’t risk it happening again. You understand?” John swallows and takes a deep, steadying breath.
“Take your time,” John said and took another sip of tea. Sherlock couldn’t look at him directly, but noticed how his leg began to bounce and how John’s hand uncurled and curled into a fist.
“I’ve made you uncomfortable.”
“Well, then I won’t keep you long,” Violent trilled, ignoring his surly “hurumph” sound. “You on a case, then?”
“I was having a shit day,” she answers with a wry smirk.  “Weren’t we all?” Her attempt at levity falls flat and she pushes on. “Greg and I… I mean it was good- we had an amazing few weeks and then suddenly he started acting weird. He distanced himself, I guess. He said you deduced that he was seeing someone but said it wouldn’t last. Said I wasn’t the one. It rattled him. He thinks you’re infallible.”
Sherlock glanced at Mary, and it was like a silent conversation because Mary nodded knowingly and backed out of the small bathroom to give them a moment of privacy.
“Well, you know what they say, ‘Living with someone you love can be lonelier than living entirely alone, if the one that you love doesn’t love you.’ So in a way it’s actually a good thing that John turned me down because even though I’d never do anything to try to change him or ask more of him than he’s able to give… eventually he’ll begin dating again and… Watson needs a mother…and I can’t do it again. No, I mean I will- I will do anything he needs me to, but maybe it’ll be easier if I’ve got a place to retreat to.”
Sherlock reached to flush the toilet with a shaking hand. John handed him the water and watched as Sherlock sipped carefully. Florida. Where he had met Mrs. Hudson all those years ago- of course, John realized belatedly, he was in rehab. Mycroft’s doing, probably. Cut him off from all familiar ties an ocean away.
Sherlock felt ill, John was in love- again. He had hoped he hadn’t been right about that. How many times could Sherlock survive this?
She watches his Adam’s apple bob in his throat as his eyes raze over her face, deductions flying a mile per minute. It’s the same expression a small child might have if caught with his hand in a cookie jar. She takes his hand and leads him outside; barely catching a glimpse of John’s confused expression on the way out of the church.
Molly ambles down the stairs and Sherlock watches out the window as Lestrade greets her with a swift kiss.
“What exactly do you suggest?” He asks.
“Sorry,” he muttered, almost inaudibly.
“I will.”
“Come on sweetheart,” John muttered laying her on the sofa and kneeling beside her. She immediately began to twist over onto her belly and try to escape, but practiced hands quickly shucked her damp clothing, and spoiled nappy and had her in a fresh diaper that smelled of baby powder and into a soft pink sleeper with an elephant on it. It was a bit too long in the arms and legs but Rosie was quite comfortable. John on the other hand…
“You know, I was just thinking, maybe you could go in on a flat-share. It would be nice to have someone to help with the rent wouldn’t it?”
“John-”
“Yoohoo!” Mrs Hudson trills from the sitting room, and they can hear Rosie babbling sweetly.
Sherlock knew his aunt, a cousin and his grandparents were buried there. He remembered their funerals in obscure details the way children do; they had served carrot cake afterward, or he had skinned his knee prior to the service and was miserable about it the entire time, or Mycroft had explained to him that Heaven was a myth and a lie people used to comfort the living. He was 7 at the time. A little behind his grandparents markers was a small white monument for his infant sister who died before Sherlock was even a thought in his parent’s hearts. His eldest brother was not there, though, and he wondered as he watched his father's faded blue eyes scanning the yard over the stone fence, what he thought about that. They didn’t talk about things like that. Even after he died, when Sherlock would ask about him the room would suddenly feel like all the air got sucked out – and fire can’t survive in a vacuum, so it would suddenly grow very cold.  Sherlock couldn’t understand it then any more than he could now.
“I’ve got a new flat lined up.”
“I can’t keep my finger on the pulse of London from inside here, Mycroft.” Sherlock sniped. He plucked his mobile phone off the tray, the screen black and power off, he wasn’t quite ready to face the messages that surely waited for him. The thought that perhaps no messages would be waiting for him however, was even worse. Best to leave it off then. He slipped it into his pocket.
“I see.” He didn’t.
“He’s been busy,” Sherlock excuses, and begins poking at the food in front of him.
“I’ll be right over,” John says, “Would you mind watching Rosie so I can have a word with him?”
“I can’t stay here,” Sherlock confessed. “He’s already done it- killed me- and it’s only a matter of time until I finish the job.”
“Greg’s asked you to move in.” Sherlock announces, and realizes belatedly that it’s the first words he’s spoken aloud today. It’s obvious now, the brunette hair on his sleeve and the vague smell of formaldehyde.
“Of course, John.” Sherlock said as he scooped the little girl up.
Mycroft inhaled deeply on the other end of the phone and held it for a count.
“Oh.” Sherlock answered, feeling like he’d had the wind knocked out of him, even though he had been expecting it. It stung a little that John didn’t trust him watching Rosie, he had done it before- and had hoped that if he’d be left home without John at least he’d have his other favorite Watson with him to keep him company. “I have nothing on, I could have watched her.”
“Supper’s probably on,” he said as they rounded the bend back toward the cottage.
“He loves me,” Mary says almost regretfully, and Sherlock looks at her in bewilderment, “I think things would be easier if he didn’t.  John is a man of principle, Sherlock. He made a promise and I won’t pretend that I’d be standing here today if he hadn’t.”
“But you’ve missed something.” John adds.
“I should be going,” John admits, “I need to pick Rosie up at the nursery.”
“Ta,” He said, clearing his throat, and blinking away the vapor of impending tears. He took the strap of the bag, shoulders it, and then reaches for Rosie, who nestles deeper again Sherlock and babbles in protest and John extracts her and carries her to the sofa while Sherlock returned to the kitchen.
“There is no debt!” Sherlock raises his voice to match John’s.
Sherlock looks down, his smile cautiously fading.
What had started with Sherlock’s demanding text for milk  somehow turns into a weekly visit, and then biweekly. Always, the question of John’s moving back hangs unanswered in the air.  Sherlock seems pleased by their visits and Rosie is a welcome distraction with her cherubic laughter and occasional tantrum there is never time to delve too deeply into the murky uncharted waters of their tentatively revived friendship.
There on the doorstep of 221B stood a very wet and exhausted John Watson, looking strikingly similar to a drowned cat, and resting on his right hip was a very wet and very angry eighteen month old Rosamund Mary.
“I don’t know - asexual?”
“Watson,” Sherlock mutters.
“But a phone call would do, every now and then,” his father continued undeterred.
Sherlock looks ashamed and his hand goes to the pocket that the cellphone is in. He retrieves it and turns it off.
“You weren’t to know,” Molly shakes her head, and her smile is a bit tight, “but we ended up having a huge row and he accused me of not being – of not being over you. I guess I couldn’t deny it as concretely he would have liked and he said we should cool it, take a break…”
“I miss the ways things were.”
Sherlock’s brows knit and his eyes grow sad, but he nods.
As obligatory visits go, this was no more painful than usual. At least there was a companionable silence. He could always count on his father to give him the silence and space he so badly craved. Mummy, on the other hand, was constantly nattering on, effectively smothering his train of thought like a well-placed pillow, not letting up until his brain was nothing more than radio static and her grating, chipper voice. No, his father wasn’t a particularly deep pond, but still very placid.
“Well what?” Sherlock grouched.
“I can defend myself,” Sherlock drawls.
Silence.
“I’m sure Mycroft will know before I do.”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“He doesn’t want your money, mummy, you know that. No, I don’t think you have to worry about Sherlock. He visited Martha Hudson yesterday afternoon- you remember her case?”
They move to their chairs and Sherlock carefully pours the tea. He is not a religious man, but this is an act of reverence. He hands John the cup, careful to avoid touching his hand.They sit and quietly sip and for the first time since John arrived, Sherlock begin to feel the tension easing. So they didn’t do small talk. Maybe they didn’t need to. Maybe they could have this, cups of tea by the fireplace and occasional spatial proximity and it would be enough. It was enough. It was more than enough, Sherlock reasoned, it had to be
“John!”
Sherlock crosses to him, stepping over the detritus of home improvement, and takes the rolls from him.
Sherlock smiled, and looked into the empty fireplace, the smile not quite reaching his eyes. Mrs. Hudson, John thought incredulously. Perhaps he could write this off as one of those times when Sherlock had an uncanny knack of being able to predict things, like the time he had known two weeks ahead of time which therapist he would choose. Bone-deep John knew that wasn’t case. He knew two things with absolute certainty- the first was that Sherlock Holmes was the most amazing man he would ever meet, and second, John Watson absolutely did not deserve his friendship. Not after everything.
Violet sighed. Parenting was supposed to be easier once they left the nest.
Sherlock inhales deeply and watches the people exit the church.
“Life partners?” Sherlock questions.
“Has been on a cruise for two weeks,” Molly answers, and begins to fix a plate of left-overs after carefully sniffing them to make sure they haven’t gone off.
Sherlock smiled, his face felt like cracking plaster.
Violet noticed he had stopped walking. At least, resigned to finish the conversation.
“Ah,” John’s witty retort.
“I- erm.” John floundered, “I hadn’t actually planned on coming here. I was walking to get her tired out, but it started to rain. I fell asleep in the cab… I must have told him your address by mistake.”
“But… what about Irene Adler?” John asks, and remembering Sherlock’s previous reaction to her name being brought up instantly regrets the inquiry. He’d almost rather not know.
“Do you think this wise, Brother dear?” Mycroft drawled as Sherlock buckled his watch. No sooner had Sherlock signed his release paperwork than he had appeared like a phantom, all disapproval.
“I’m sorry,” John sighed, kneading his brow. “I just turn up here in the middle of the night. I don’t even have nappies for Rose. I should probably just go back home.”
“You had been crying,” Sherlock says, brows drawing together. He had noticed it, but at the time he hadn’t given himself the time to deduce it. He had thought her life was at stake.
“And I don’t have a key… anymore.”
“Good night, John.”
“I know what I am,” John says, “I know what I did to you, and I will live with that for the rest of my life.  I can tell you I am sorry for it- because I am, but I can’t promise you it will never happen again. It should have never happened in the first place.”
“This frenetic energy; throwing yourself into your work to avoid something that scares you. Only this time there are no serviettes to fold.”
“Shall we?” He asks.
“No, I honestly can’t, Mary.” John snapped, “Why would talking to his best friend drive him to a relapse?”
“I … I never managed to apologize properly to you for…” Thinking about his long list of offenses makes him feel vaguely I'll. John’s eyes close, “for so many things.”
“You didn’t!” Violet accused, and was met with a telling silence. “You know he doesn’t like you interfering. Honestly Mycroft, you’ll drive the wedge between you even further!  You’ve recovered this information with subterfuge and all your little cameras haven’t you?”
“No.” Sherlock answers, and doesn’t feel much like elaborating, and the awkward silence resumes. Why were the two of them so bad at this? Sherlock abhors small talk, he’d rather have a fork in his eye than stand here dithering.
When John walked in there was no mistaking it- it was indeed a date night.  His shirt was new. That was distressing.
“He needs help, John.” Mary said quietly.
“You’re not gay.”
“Where to?” The cabbie asked over the relentless drumming of rain and the squeak of wipers. Warm at last and so tired John leaned his head against the back of the seat.
“Not ill, no. Not yet, anyway.” John admitted, his hair plastered to his brow.
“I know he is difficult, but he’s your brother. I hate to see you two at odds.”
Sherlock shrugged flippantly and pushed past Mycroft toward the exit. Of course he knew what Mycroft was referring to. He hadn’t stopped referring to his…Achilles heel since it became painfully obvious to every villain in Europe and tabloid alike… there was only one person who seemed stubbornly to ignore it, and well, thank God for that. The only thing that would hurt worse than his ignorance would be outright rejection, but even then, Sherlock wondered if some finality may be preferable.
“It’s not like it was before,” she reasons with him when she visits that evening, inspecting the kitchen for evidence of his eating habits, “I mean, living alone, it’s hard to go back to.”
Molly sighs and pulls out the kitchen chair to sit in. She doesn’t want to tell Sherlock why she had been crying, but his expression is earnest and he looks younger somehow, a rare display of his vast vulnerability. He needs to understand.
“No,” Mycroft assured, “As far as I can tell he has been clean since his release. No, I am afraid he was behind on rent, and when the landlord came to inquire, found his living area … hazardous.”
“She knows what I like,” Sherlock says simply and looks at John under his eyelashes, a blush creeping onto those impossible cheekbones.
“He was right, all along. Despite everything- every domino I’ve toppled, it still comes around to the fact that he knew how to defeat me. It was inevitable.”
They chuckled.
Sherlock hadn’t spoken a single word as he left the flat when Mycroft had come to collect him. He hadn’t even glanced at John or Mary, only murmured a few words to Mrs. Hudson at the bottom of the stairs and allowed her to gently squeeze his arm as he left out the door. John and Mary watched solemnly as he ducked into the waiting car and it pulled away. John had received word from Mycroft when Sherlock had been admitted, but hadn’t received any further information, and the not-knowing was making his skin itch.
Sherlock goes to bed but cannot sleep, instead he contemplates all the many wonderful facets of the two letter word that has all his hopes hinged upon it.
Their trek paused briefly as they passed the cemetery near the parish church, and Siger Holmes craned his neck a bit to look into yard where tombstones  lined like crooked teeth, some leaning so badly they looked like they would topple. The newer graves lay further back where the polished stones gleamed and the plush green grass was cut short.
“I had better get to bed,” John said, “I don’t know how long she’ll give me… I have to take it when I can you know.”
Sherlock has trouble spinning plates and Mary addresses the Elephant in the Room.
“Mary, you should know that I would never…”
“He’s been evicted.” Mycroft replied.
He hopes that the imperious summon will mask the terrible panic that is currently welling up in his chest. Instantly his mind palace offers him an array of senarios to explain why John hadn’t responded immediately the worst of these see John seated across a table with some simpering woman on a date, even though Sherlock knows that this is highly unlikely, given that Mrs. Hudson isn’t minding Watson tonight and that John has been reluctant as of yet to dive back into the dating arena.
“Why?”
They regarded one another for a long moment, Rosie sucking noisily on her fingers. John’s expression was conflicted, flashing between embarrassment and cautious optimism. John Watson wasn’t supposed to look unsure. Sherlock found it hateful.
“I won’t tell your mother,” his father finally said.
“I am demisexual, John. Though I see where that could be confusing, since I assumed the same for most of life.” Sherlock says, lowering his knees finally and regaining a portion of himself.
They are locked in a staring match now, and John can barely breathe. The lines around Sherlock’s eyes soften ever so slightly, instantly making him look younger, more vulnerable. Sherlock is an expert in Baritsu, he has seen him bring a man twice his size down, and yet he has never once raised a hand to defend himself against John. Not when he came back from the dead, not in the morgue.  John feels the question rise up in his throat unbidden and when it escapes his lips it is nothing more than a raspy whisper.
“Shit!” He cursed, trying to shield his daughter with his coat, but it proved difficult so he ducked into the nearest bus shelter and tried to soothe her.
“You're wrong!” Sherlock exclaimed, effectively silencing John, who was dismayed to see tears on his friend’s cheeks. “You heard him say it too, John,” Sherlock argued, his eyes still closed, “at the pool.”
Several hours later, after Sherlock had miraculously convinced Lady Smallwood and friends to let Moriarty make the first move,  John was seated on the edge of the green bathtub in 221B while Sherlock violently emptied his stomach into the toilet. Mary stood watching, uninvited, from the doorway with a glass of water at the ready.
In actuality, he hadn’t noticed her absence at all. Sherlock chews his bottom lip as he parses out how he had let that detail slip. It seemed only yesterday when she was nattering at him about something or another, important phone numbers or some such.
“You should have! I wish to God there was a balance I could pay on this debt.”
John stops by after work before picking Rosie up from the nursery. He still hasn’t had a new key made and so is at the mercy of Mrs. Hudson who says Sherlock isn’t home.
He halts, suddenly, jarring Mary’s arm in the process. He stands so still that it seems as though he sprouted there like one of the austere trees in the church yard.
Rosie had slid on her belly off of the sofa and was toddling across the room toward Sherlock.
“What’s to be done?”
“Look, Sherlock, I don’t care what we call it, I just want to come home – to stay.”
“No,” Mary finally answered, placing a hand on the mound of her belly.
John took a breath and held it for a beat before shaking his head and sighing.
“I don’t want to keep hurting you,” a whisper is all John can manage.
John and Rosie had been living back at 221B for several months, happily it seemed. They had fallen back into an easy routine as though setting the needle back on the record, as though the last several years had never happened. But of course Sherlock had to expect that John would start dating again. A year had passed since Mary’s death – they had marked the occasion by resolutely not talking about it. But when Sherlock had ventured out in the afternoon to visit her resting place, there were lilies, so he knew John had been there earlier. How often had John lamented Rosie’s lack of a mother? The thought of sabotaging John’s dates, as he had years ago, was out of the question. Not if it meant that Rosie got what she needed.
“Oh my god,” John breathes though the abating laughter, “What are we doing?”
Sherlock snaps out of his reverie.
Molly bites her bottom lip as she thinks about it.
Concerned eyes, almost a watery gray in the kitchen light, look up at her.
Mycroft sighed and leaned heavily on his umbrella.
“Thank you.”
“Hm?” His father replied.  Sherlock couldn’t be sure if he was asking for clarification or agreeing with him. It was quite likely both.
“It never stopped you before,” John pressed with a small laugh and followed Sherlock at a distance. He leaned against the wall and watched Sherlock busy himself making a cup of tea.
“Doubtful.”
Sherlock doesn’t even look up.
The sun is bright and warm on their shoulders as the walk through the grass, still slick with dew.
“Florida,” Sherlock’s voice, a mere croak, broke the strained silence.
Sherlock’s groan echoed in the porcelain bowl. His overdose had come crashing down on him hard, and although he hadn’t taken as much as John had feared, John had made sure he hadn’t let Sherlock get another step inside his mind palace since disembarking the small plane.
“Look, Sherlock-”
Sherlock looks around 221B and sees that it isn’t exactly the same. Things are slightly off, even the smile on the wall is slightly askew. It’s ok though, Sherlock decides. When something is broken it can never go back exactly the same way.
“Molly insisted,” John replied. The two flat mates regarded each other for a moment before John shrugged, “Well?”
“The other one.”
“Now, John,” said wickedly, "if you please…”
Mycroft had always seen him as a beauty deity, but as his hand fought to keep the pace of his thoughts and heartbeat, he remembered all those moments where he prayed for time to stop between them, moments where they held each other, dreaming of being eternal. He truly loved the insufferable fucker, Mycroft realized.
Sherlock's face reflected the momentary horror and involvement of those words and his vivid imagination. How grotesque it must be for the common siblings to learn that your brother finally had the life he deserved and was deprived of for so long.
rather than
They kissed until their lips were swollen. Sherlock removed his trousers and began to impale himself incessantly using John’s palpitating manhood. With one hand, he held firmly by John’s neck and with the other, his long and graceful fingers slicked up John’s entrance, he still had them slightly lubricated with John’s come, but nevertheless, he licked them, letting his two fingers make their way up to John’s prostate, making him grunt at the unison of Sherlock’s own moans.
The door opened. A super confused Mycroft entered with his hand stuck in an ice bucket, balancing several bottles of water, a mission that failed the moment he realized how his personal movement-reference flesh mannequins dared not waiting for him to continue with recreational activities.
“So, the thing you said at dinner…” John kept kissing.
“No, the fun one.”
“At some point, I'm gonna run out of saliva, you prick.”
Sherlock turned to face the other side, shame threatening to show on his face –
Sherlock gripped the backrest firmly, panting without taking his gaze away from Mycroft. Oh, the way his mouth formed a perfect oval, and his eyes began to close away from reality, plunging into bliss. There wasn't enough time, words and materials in the world to capture something like that, something so ethereal and a tiny bit sexy. This is what Goya must have felt throughout his dark period.
John began sucking, shallow cheeks getting sore interlacing with perfect tongue twirls.
– he purred.
“Are you two flirting!?” Greg’s appetite decided to leave the table. Unfortunately, a rising hard-on took its place.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s thigh, breathing heavily, they sure needed a moment to recompose themselves, but there seemed it wasn’t time for that:
“No, just … y’know, interesting.”
“THAT’S EXACTLY MY POINT!” – and ran away to hide in John’s room.
“Hmmm, interesting; cheekbones then. Now Mycroft, let’s move to more compelling matters; we require your skills.”
Sherlock’s eyes looked dark. He wasn’t ever amused about receiving orders from Mycroft, but for now he had won this match.
. Dead, slimy and not at all well preserved (
“We’ll have about 45 minutes before Lestrade convince Mycroft to stop being a ridiculous berk and comes back.”
Both not even trying to hide their moans and groans anymore; this queued Greg to let himself go painting and kissing John’s back. Sherlock felt how his hand was covered in something hot sliding between his fingers while John writhed from overstimulation. He was still holding him while he came. With a last tug on his hair and John gasping, he also resigned himself to ruining the sheets under them.
The fireplace was burning, and the cold winter night wind lashed the night. A huge leather sofa was placed in front of the fire and John Watson idly wrote notes in a journal.
“It’s fucking marble, Mycroft. You almost left me one-eyed for something that is impossible to get stained so I’m asking you again … are you ok?”
“You know neither of us attended art school, right? I went straight to the army and Greg straight to the force, so the only posh bastard that could have said skills is you, do you know how even to hold a brush? Have you ever painted anything?”
“I wasn’t aware that among our five-thousand books library, there could’ve been somewhere some chivalry manual I never found that says you can
“There’s nothing wrong with what we are doing. It is not illegal, and if it makes you feel better, the only person who has committed a “crime” today is me with this shitty packet of gummies. For the record, these costing more than 30 cents is the real crime.”
in about two months.
He started, never looking away from Sherlock.
“Hold yourself… from me, here”, and Sherlock pulled him a bit as he wrapped John's arms around his waist, letting the man's brain reboot enough to remember how to give a waist-hug. Sweat dripped down Sherlock's back, the scent of hours and hours of mingled fluids and his all so very arousing cologne still present in little notes every time he moved; it felt almost as intoxicating as being held down.
It was not the only time it’d happened, not even the second or third one.
His knees hit the ground, and it was like watching specks of dust surrender to the wind and gravity. Sherlock didn't stop his eyelids from dropping.
“Hmmm … everything? I been considering redecorating”
Mycroft tried his best to hide the fact that Lestrade's cock had been in his mouth (and arse, sofa, bed, kitchen counter, bath, against the shower wall, stairs, laundry room and the pantry) two days prior, poor housekeeper, the things she had to clean for a few couple thousand pounds a week; discretion and cleaning abilities paid well among posh bastards.
“Neither will I, I'll certainly be waiting to mention it at the right time” – Sherlock smiled – “Good night, John” – and headed to the living room.
– John rolled his eyes in exasperation –
That's what the game would be about; with a small grin, Greg wished John all the luck in the world in his quest for self-control and turned around.
"Great" Sherlock cleared his throat, "We have a deal. We'll be your models."
"Oh! Mycroft's been sculpting a replica of your cock for the past two months, he can't get it right because he can't do it by memory, that's one of the few disadvantages of so many years sticking to facts and harsh reality, you forget to let your imagination fly away … that's why he needs models, he doesn't have the muscle memory for … the touch; he even had clay poisoning from trying to deepthroat it while still fresh and failing miserably … which could only be entirely possible if he already had said ginormous dick in his mouth prior to it, so stop being hypocritical and prude."
“You know … I don’t like not knowing” – John didn’t seem to have the intention to get up.
John held his head between his hands and kiss down Sherlock’s pain away, preventing him to keep up with the speech but letting him get his much sought-after release.
“We had thousands of books and a family dinner every couple weeks, for our parents, that was enough human interaction. So, we never saw anything wrong with just keeping each other company.”
John's smirk was visible even with half of Sherlock's prick invading his mouth, "… how? erotic and divine?"
But he was interrupted by a ferocious kiss, that would surely make his lip swell in a few hours.
He turned for a second to look at John’s eyes, quickly analysing his expression.
“Where does it hurt, dear?”
It was 3:55 am; they were in the middle of nowhere. Freezing cold. They made each other’s company in silence. Sherlock stared absently at the small waves the breeze was forming on his coffee’s surface; he was sitting in his signature pose, grabbing himself by the knees as much as his great height allowed. Being side by side with John gave him an unsettling sense of comfort. He sank deeper in his coat protecting his face from the wind. Their silence was only broken by the distant sound of passing cars, the chirping sound of the gas station light flicking, John’s careful chew and Sherlock’s occasional sips.
"Oh, goodie ..."
Both started jiggling at the stupidity of the whole situation. Mycroft didn’t recall the last time he had laughed so much; his eyes were teary, and he had to cough back a few more giggles before being able to breath. Their amusement was interrupted by the car pulling over at the Yard, and the driver opening Lestrade’s door.
– Mycroft sat back next to Greg; trying to ease the wrinkles in his suit –
He took him in his mouth in one long swallow, hollowing his cheeks and rapidly pulling out. Sherlock cried at the loss of warmth around his cock, but John didn’t seem to care about this a bit. He sucked again and pulled off. Sherlock threw his arms and covered his eyes, whispering a soft “fuck” as he tried to calm down, understanding that John was doing it on purpose. He would not comply to such poor and dull vengeance. How dare he. He didn’t need to come … not yet.
“His bed became my favourite spot in the world.” A sad smile drew upon his features.
– said a grinning Lestrade as a black car parked just next to them and he opened the door for Mycroft –

"Come, come…" dictate while lowering himself to said sex-leather-
"My hands are cold."
“Mycroft, where do you put the packaging tape?”
John stood up and went to look around the warehouse to find a pack of braided general use rope. People use this stuff for climbing mountains (ok, maybe not), or maybe to hang clothes; but no, he was going to use it for much more weird “experiments”. God help him, why did he always ended up doing what Sherlock asked?!
Probably because it helps avoid the insisting gaze of his partner silently asking him to pull himself together. Clock’s ticking and Sherlock Holmes’ is not well known for his patience.
The recall of previous encounters made John twice as cautious with Sherlock; he took an extra couple of minutes to secure his waist to the chair, leaving him in a fully vulnerable and exposed position. Sherlock growled as both men worked in silence while Lestrade paced around the room. Greg approached an anxious Sherlock Holmes, who couldn’t help being hard and leaking already.
– said a surprised Greg.
"Meaning you don't want to be fed…?"
Sherlock was beaming.
John could see ecstasy and bewilderment mingling across the man's features between his hands.
Sherlock passed one arm around John’s waist and the other grabbed his hair possessively, nuzzling at his neck without breaking the embrace, sniffing every single part of the crook of John’s neck.
” – John bit a donut before passing half of it to his partner.
of entwined legs and leaking cavities.
Shivers started to rove down his spine, not ever knowing that the soft spots of his legs could feel so arousing. He realised it was not his anatomy and perfect genes doing the work. John's tender care and sweetness, always gentle and caring. Soft on the inside but ready to slash your throat without blinking, if the situation required it.
– Sherlock shouted, all his limbs shaking and twitching, banging his own trying to scold John for his outrageous instructions.
If his Neanderthals were already willing to continue inserting all their digits in every possible hole they had at hand, for at least one night, Mycroft thought he could allow himself and his fantasies to serve a better purpose… anyway, his whole life had been based on the sole and absolute guilt for being also an irrational pervert.
”- His laugh started to fade as he felt John’s feral gaze.
Greg dropped to the floor and began to unbutton Mycroft’s trousers, feeling how his cock bobbled out of the wool encasement already leaking obscenely.
John was surely ready, like so fucking ready, to just thrust himself up Sherlock's prostate until he was begging him to please stop scrambling his intestines.
John flushed, unable to blink or say anything more understandabe than a soft whimper equivalent to a -
Sherlock seemed eager not to let a single opportunity go amiss as he took John's cock tightly and began to caress him while savagely introducing his tongue into his mouth, spilling all over their necks, entwining in the, probably, best and filthiest kiss he could remember.
“Shouldn’t you be teasing teens instead of seducing older men like me?”
“How else would I get reliable results if I didn’t eliminate the clothing variable?”
– he asked.
plan?”
Now Sherlock had an open-mouthed Mycroft at his mercy, "Oh! I think I wasn't supposed to say that … woopsy."
- a hand grabbed him by the neck while pulling down his pants.
Sherlock was on the verge of coming, his release was distracted by the sound of his own body being smashed against the dinning table.
"How…?!" John began.
With a swift motion, he put the pen down, groped Greg's hips and promptly put both –
“The master bedroom.”
But John Watson was nothing if not a gentleman and had a sudden rush of responsibility and clearness within him that made his reptilian brain stop from raw-fuck the gorgeous specimen now nesting in his arms.
"Who's mood?"
“You look particularly miserable today. Have I done something to wrong you? I’ll skip the small talk part and jump right to the “it’s your fault” segment; what did I do this time? tell me”.
