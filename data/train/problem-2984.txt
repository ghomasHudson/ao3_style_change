“We’re missing the buttons. While they’re not actually buttons, they’re usually rocks or pieces of charcoal.” Positioning them, Dean takes a step back from the snowmen, crossing his arms over his chest with a proud smile. “Considering this is my first time making a snowman in I don’t know how many years and the first time you’ve ever made one, I think we did pretty good- What are you doing?” He raises an eyebrow at Castiel, who’s starting to unwrap his scarf from around his neck.
“Yes.” Gadreel’s voice quavers as he responds. “They didn’t always look like that.”
Blushing brightly, Dean rubs the back of his neck and invites them in. He leads them quietly back to the library, practically keeping a hand over Claire's mouth the entire time. Before closing the door to the library, Dean shouts to Sam to not bother him or come to the library anymore. Sam shouts back that that’s fine. When Dean turns back to Jody and Claire he’s surprised to see Jody setting gifts down.
“Are you busy right now?” Dean asks, getting worried.
The sound of a door opening makes Claire pull away from the phone, cutting off her sentence. After a moment, Claire’s voice comes back through the phone. “Jody’s back. Want me to put her on?”
“Archangel, remember Sam,” Gabriel grins as he breaks a small piece of the brownie off, popping it into his mouth. “It’s not going to burn me.”
Squeezing Castiel’s shoulder, Sam hands Lucky back to Castiel. “Well she’s got you now.”
“Coal.” Dean grins up at Sam as he places his larger gifts on the skirt before moving to the stockings, where a third had been hung up, a squirrel holding a bell printed on it, and has already been filled. “Is that mine?”
Cas looks up at Dean, nodding, “Yes, I heard candy canes are an important part of Christmas. Sam also told me that you liked them.”
“Monday. After we killed the vampire nest, I found her in the barn. I couldn't leave her behind so I took her.” Castiel shrugs. “I looked for her mother but when I had located her, she was already dead.”
“Yeah. Don’t like them?” Dean worries as he takes a sip of his own drink.
Claire mutters something that sounds suspiciously like “you owe me” before she gets up to go to her stocking, shouting her thanks when she begins pulling out the sweets that Dean that put.
Pulling his jacket off, Castiel shrugs. “I have not had hot chocolate before. Is it a drink?”
Walking across the bedroom, Lucifer pulls open the drawer, glaring down at the pile of feathers. Yanking one out, he turns his glare to Dean. “They’re old and ugly. You should’ve thrown them away.”
Eggs, milk, flour, baking soda, chocolate chips, sugar, orange, ginger, marshmallow, peanut butter, candy canes, caramel, whipped cream.
Dean turns to Sam for help but Sam only holds his hands up. “Hey I don’t mind having a cat around the Bunker. And don’t worry, I promise he won’t get into your stuff or scratch up your car.”
“We’re here- Claire don’t you break that,” Jody says and Dean can faintly hear Claire say that she won’t. “Can you come let us in?”
Sam sighs softly, his hand not moving from Gadreel’s shoulder. “I know.” Why does he sound sad? Gadreel slowly looks up at Sam’s face, surprised to see sadness in his eyes. “Your wings are a part of you, yes but the state of them doesn’t reflect who you are Gadreel.”
Dean spends the night decorating the library, stringing up white lights, tinsels and garland on every bookshelf, the edge of each table and over the back of every chair present. He also scatters a few candy canes on the tables, resting a few on the sleeves, between the books. Taping two individual stockings, the first depicting a moose wearing a Santa hat, which makes Dean laugh almost as hard as it did when he first saw it at the store, and the second with an angel above a farm by a star which just makes him smile to himself again.
Dean finds the first feather in the bathroom, under the sink beside the trash bin. It’s a dull white but Dean can tell it was once brighter. He knows it’s not Castiel which only leaves Lucifer. Dean doesn’t throw it away. He goes to put it in the trash bin but then something in him makes him pull his arm back. The feather is soft but there’s a weight to it that seems to make Dean’s chest tighten. Instead, Dean places it in the drawer of his bedside table. When he sees Lucifer in the kitchen, he doesn’t mention it.
With a raised eyebrow, Dean asks, “So I guess we can’t go get him?”
“First of all, any cookie can be had for Christmas. Ginger, sugar, chocolate chip, peanut butter whatever. Second of all, why do you need to know? You don’t bake.” Claire states matter-of-factly, however, a grin is apparent in her voice. “Unless of course, you’re trying to impress someone in which case just buy them from a bakery and say you made them. He won’t know-”
Dean says he’s on his way to the door before hanging up. He’s careful to make sure that he doesn't alert Sam on his way down, as he unlocks and opens the door, he met with an armful of Claire throwing herself into a hug. As they pull away, she grins smugly at him and comments, “Nice snowmen.” while pointing at the small family of snowmen.
And then he fell and his wings burnt away.
Grabbing a beer and a box of pizza, he sits at the table and props his feet onto the surface of the table while taking his phone out. Its rings twice before it’s picked up and he’s greeted with an exasperated voice.
He knows Claire is right; that he has feelings for Cas and that probably everyone can tell, except the angel himself. He’s faced down vampires, demons, werewolves, ghosts, wendigos, any monster or creature you can imagine, hell he has faced Lucifer himself, but telling the one he likes that he likes them just absolutely terrifies Dean.
“We usually don’t,” Dean replies, trying to not to sound too angry. “But I thought that perhaps this year, with the three of us finally being together without any threats, maybe we could start celebrating again. And you’ve never had a Christmas before.”
“He’s out on a hunt, didn’t need me or Cas so we stayed behind.”
Cas nods and carefully begins hanging up the ornaments alongside Dean. By the time they’ve finished, the bags are empty of decorations and the tree looks like something out of a magazine. White lights and sparkling golden ribbons with silver and golden ornaments. Dean, proud of the work he and as did, claps the angel on his back with a grin. “Not bad for your first time.”
He starts to put a few of the stocking stuffings he bought because changing his mind and deciding to keep them in his bag until Christmas Eve. Moving onto the baubles he has, he balances precariously on a chair and table to string them up from the ceiling. By the time he’s finished decorating the library, there’s tinsel, glitter and pieces of garland in his hair and he can feel them falling into his eyes. Taking a step back to overlook the decor, he turns the overhead lights off and plugs in the Christmas lights to check that they work. They all turn on, embracing the library with a warm white glow while twinkling along to the beat of Christmas classics. Smiling to himself, Dean turns the lights off and flicks the main ones back on.
He stands in front of the bathroom mirror, his wings stretching painfully behind him. He knows Dean constantly carries an angel blade on him, ever since Castiel brought him back to the Bunker from Heaven. He contemplates asking for it and cutting the rest of his wings away. Then his eyes settle on his stomach.
Cas doesn’t ask any more questions as he gives Dean the lights, instead, he just stands by a table and watches Dean wrap the lights around the tree. He does look around the room, however, his eyes resting on the stockings. Crossing the room to get a closer look at them, he gently takes hold of the angel one with a frown.
Lucifer shrugs, muttering something about the threat still being on the table before he grabs a glass from a drink that’s a dark shade of purple off a nearby table. Dean winces at the reek of alcohol he gets from it before snatching it from Lucifer’s hand and setting it back on the table only for Lucifer to grab it back and down it in one go, smirking at Dean.
Feeling his face burn up, Dean stammers, “What are you talking about?”
Rubbing a hand over his face, he hears Cas call out his name. Closing his laptop, he sets it to the side and climbs out of bed. Heading to the library, he finds Cas searching through one of the shelves, turning when he senses Dean. “Do you know where the novel I was reading last week is, the one about penguins?”
Cas only nods without a word before taking a seat at one of the tables with an open notebook. Gathering the now empty plastic bags and boxes in his arms, Dean goes to the kitchen. Emptying the plastics into the garbage, he knows Sam will get upset at him for later but he just loses the door and tells himself he’ll deal with that when it comes too.
He stops back by his room to grab a wreath to hang on his door before grabbing the bag of food he bought and another wreath along with the library decorations. Hanging this one on the kitchen’s door, he closed it behind him, setting the bag of food on the counter.
“What do you want me to do?”
Sam turns back to Castiel, holding his hands out for the kitten which Castiel carefully hands him. The kitten lets out a small mewl and buts her head against Sam’s chest before trying to claw its way up his shirt. Sam lets out a small laugh, enjoying both the way the kitten seems to like him and the smile that plays on Castiel’s face.
Laughing, Dean tugs his own hat off of his head and holds it out to Castiel. “Put that on top will you?” Castiel nods, accepting the hat which he slowly places on the top of the snowman. Dean watches with a smile as Castiel wraps the scarf around the snowman. Feeling a small shiver go down his back, Dean rubs his upper arms before calling out to Castiel. “I think it’s done now Cas. Come on let’s go back inside, I’m start to freeze.”
There’s a small gasp behind him that has Gadreel folding his wings to his back and spinning around. Sam is standing just outside the bathroom, his eyes focused on the space where Gadreel’s wings were just on display.
As Dean begins handing out the hot chocolates, he also points to the container of cookies, giving Jody thanks for them again. Picking up the gift he dropped, Sam quickly tears off the paper, smiling happily at what there’s in his hands. A leather bound journal with the word ‘Sam’ written on the spine. Claire looks up at Dean and says that there’s one for him as well.
“Are you not supposed to add a hat and scarf to the snowman?” Castiel looks over at Dean, halting in the process of pulling his scarf off. “Am I doing this wrong?”
Not answering Dean’s question, Lucifer instead grabs himself a second drink and says, “You know, I think I’m starting to enjoy this party.”
Dean nods, setting his slice of pizza back in the box.  “That’s actually kind of a nice story. But anyway, I got an idea, wanna built one? A snowman I mean. I can teach you how to build it. It’s actually a lot of fun.” Shrugging, Castiel accepts Dean’s offer, not seeing the fault in doing so. “Great. We’ll need a carrot. And warmer clothes. Give me a moment and we’ll go find those clothes.” Shoving the box back into the fridge, he searches through the storage compartments for a bag of carrots.
Dean whirls around in shock, his heart jumping in his chest. Castiel is standing in the doorframe, his arms crossed over his chest. “What do you mean he’s not back? Did he manage to find a hook-up at the bar?” Dean smiles cheekily as he opens the fridge to grab the leftover pizza box. “Want some?” Dean holds out a slice to Castiel.
“Um Dean.” He tugs on the sleeve of Dean’s jacket, his brows furrowing. Dean looks over, a laugh escaping his mouth. A small squirrel is perched on the lower branch, nibbling on the carrot below him. Reaching forward, Dean gently scares the squirrel away, still laughing. Grabbing the carrot, Castiel mutters a thanks.
Rolling his eyes, Sam pours two extra mugs and sets them onto tray along with the other three. Stepping forward, Dean takes the tray and gives Sam a small nudge towards the door.
Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean shrugs. “Yeah, if that’s alright. Just until the morning.”
Blinking, Gadreel shrugs. “How can I help you Sam?”
As they make their way through the party, they pass by the man in the devil costume. Lucifer claps him on the shoulder and offers him a forced smile. “Wonderful costume.”
On his way outside, he quickly stops by the library where Castiel is doing his own research. “I’m going out now Cas, Dean’s in his room but I wouldn’t bother him. I told him that you were staying here but he seemed pretty busy and stressed so I don’t think he’ll be bothering you.”
Dean looks over his shoulder at the angel and the snowman, a laugh escaping his mouth as he sees the squirrel from before settled on one of the twigs, reaching up to grab the carrot nose. “I’ll try to grab them before the nightfall. Or if Sam manages to get back home tonight, he’ll bring them in.”
“Oh, that was just a joke you know,” Dean mumbles awkwardly, worried that Cas will take offence. “I can get you a new one if you would like.”
“I told you, I don’t know.” Dean repeats. “I was going to when I found the first one but it just didn’t feel right and I ended up keeping it. Does it bother you?”
“Dean? What are you doing?” Stumbling backwards off the chair, he lands on his back, the star bouncing off his stomach and onto the floor as the chair falls onto him. Cas quickly pulls the chair off of him and grabs the star from the floor, holding it out to Dean as the hunter stands to his feet, rubbing the back of his head. “What is this?”
“We’re not planning anything special. If you guys are coming down that’s more than fine. I’m sure Sam will be happy to see you guys.”
He once had beautiful wings. As the guardian of the Garden, his wings were one of the most beautiful angels.
It takes them a few minutes to lift the third and final ball onto the other two, without any patches of snow falling out. Taking a step back, Dean crosses his arms over his chest while Castiel turns away to grab the carrot again, a small gasp escaping his mouth.
Looking over at Dean, Cas replies, “Of course Dean. This was a very thoughtful gift on your behalf. We haven’t seen Claire in a while.”
“Yeah. Hot chocolate is pretty good and it’ll definitely warm us up. I think there should be some marshmallows in the kitchen. So do you want one?” Dean deposits Castiel’s jacket on top of his, telling him not to worry about them, before grabbing the sleeve of Castiel’s shirt to pull him down the hall towards the kitchen. “If you add whiskey to the drink, there’s an even bigger kick to your system.”
“Mistletoe,” Is the first thing she says when she picks up. “It would not only be funny if the two of you were caught under it but it would also give you a chance to tell him how you feel about him.”
They get through with making the cake batter with surprisingly little fuss. Gabriel follows Sam’s direction, measuring, adding and mixing ingredients as Sam’s asks. After emptying the batter into the cake pans, Sam holds out the batter-covered spoon with a grin at Gabriel and an offer to lick the spoon.
“Sam has not yet returned.”
“They are sticky and do not have much of a taste. But I don’t not like them, they are fine.” Castiel gives Dean a smile over the top of his mug which Dean eagerly returns, his eyes wrinkling at the corner as he smiles. A gentle sigh slips from Castiel mugs as he lowers the mug from his mouth. “You were right, hot chocolate does warm one up. I believe I am able to feel my fingers again.”
Castiel continues frowning, watching Dean closely. “Did you ever make snowmen with Sam?” He asks curiously.
Cas looks over at Dean with a confused look on his face. “Is something wrong Dean? Did I bother you?”
Dean looks over at Cas and is worried when he sees the angel looking worried. “Are you alright?”
When Jody doesn’t reply, he asks again. “We were actually planning to go and surprise you guys.” She finally confesses after a few moments. “We were going to surprise you tomorrow morning. I was actually planning on leaving in a few hours and spending the night at a hotel but if you three are planning on something…” She trails off.
Dean keeps walking by as Lucifer responds in a quiet tone until he hears a sudden yelp and whirling around he’s surprised to see the man covering his mouth with a hand, a look of pure terror in his eyes.
After dinner, Dean retreats to his room, telling Cas and Sam that he’s working on a secret. He spends the rest of the night wrapping up the gifts and dividing them into four separate bags based off who’s getting them. He ends falling asleep, exhausted from the day’s event, face first in a sweater he got for Claire.
“You and Sam,” Dean says, not necessarily a lie. “So not peeking.”
“That is diff -”
“Who are the gifts for?’ Cas asks.
“I am feeling warmer.” Castiel smiles at Dean as he lifts the mug back to his lips. “So you method of further my warming has seemed to work.”
“Dean?”
“I’m fine. Have you warmed up enough or are you still cold? Cause I know other ways to help warm you up.” Dean wave Castiel’s concerns off with a weak attempt a comforting smile. Castiel shrugs, closing his hands around his mug. Before he realizes it, Dean’s taking a deep breath and is leaning across the table to press his lips to Castiel’s. A gasp slips from Castiel’s mouth as Dean cradles the back of his neck, his hand pressing to Castiel’s still cold skin. Pulling back, Dean looks away from the angel, turning his gaze to the table surface. “Shit, I’m sorry.”
“What did you do?”
“If you’re just going to eat my hard work without helping, I’m kicking you out.”
“How am I supposed to place these?”
Dean’s head flies up, eyes wide with confusion. “What? What worked?”
Dean is lying on his bed, feet up with a beer and watching TV, as Lucifer enters. His face suddenly feels hot as he shrugs; he hadn’t realized Lucifer knew what he was doing. Sitting up, Dean shrugs. “I don’t know. I can throw them away if it bothers you.”
“Can I join you?” Dean is surprised by the question and judging by the look on Lucifer’s face, he’s surprised by his own question.
Finishing his beer, he dials a second number. “Hey Jody,” Dean says when the call is picked up.
As Dean replies that maybe it’d be better to have breakfast after they open gifts, Sam nods in agreement, saying that he’ll make some hot chocolate for the gift opening however before he leaves the library. Dean finishes putting his gifts down, including those for Jody and Claire, and filling Cas and Sam’s stockings while also adding two extra ones. Setting a couple of candles on the table closest to the tree, he carefully lights them and taking a step back, Dean smiles at the homely sight that’s in front of him before his phone buzzes in his pocket. Picking up the call, he hears Jody sing “Merry Christmas” into his ear.
Rubbing his eyes with a yawn, Dean trudges barefoot out of his room before stretching his arms above his head. Frowning, he pauses just in front of the kitchen. The lack of noise in the bunker worries him and he calls out for his brother. When no reply meets him, he calls out again. “Hey Sammy-boy. You here?” He enter the kitchen, running a hand through his hair. “Sam!”
“What are you doing?” Sam repeats, still grinning.
“That’s really sweet Dean, but being sweet to us isn’t going to make me forget that there’s no mistletoe on any doorways.” Claire begins with a grin before reaching into her bag and pulling out a large plastic bag full of mistletoe. “So when can I hang it up?”
Jody and Sam suddenly appear very interest in the bowl of candy canes while Dean looks over at Cas who’s standing a few feet away from the table, tightly holding onto his gift. “Unless that wasn’t enjoyable for you Dean in which-”
Sam nods, agreeing as he pulls out his wallet and hands Dean his card. “Make sure to grab a bed, some toys and food, and a litterbox.” Dean leaves grumbling about the kitten but his voice is light.
The tree’s taller than Dean and getting it up without having tumbled to the floor proves to be bigger of a challenge than Dean would have thought. Twice, it almost fell onto a table until he managed to get it into the stand. Smoothing the skirt out, He grabs a chair, pulling it up to the tree.
He repeats his actions in Sam’s room only changing his white lights to some multiple coloured changing ones while also sprinkling some white and gold glitter over the bed and carpet to be a bit of dick. He also hangs up a small wreath on the outside of the door before placing a small snowman figurine on his bedside table and tossing a pillow with a pair of skates on them onto his bed.
“He’s dressed as you; or at least what humans think Satan looks like.” The appalled look on Lucifer’s face only makes him laugh harder, clutching his chest. “Yup, that’s the stereotypical Satan costume. Looks like he’s a fan of you.”
“Snow-angels were started by you guys? That childish game?” Dean questions with a raised eyebrow.
Holding the large star, he leans up on his feet in an attempt to place it on to the top branch. He’s about to get it on when Cas’ voice startles him out of focus.
“Probably just an apple pie and a cherry pie.” Sam shrugs as he grabs the ingredients for the cream cheese icing, looking over the other items in the fridge. “Maybe a blackberry one as well.”
Castiel nods again, “Some children in a nearby village saw us and joined in. One of my sister fell into the snow and her wings created an imprint on the snow below her.”
Before Dean can think up a response, Claire is jumping out with a shout of Merry Christmas. Startled, Sam dropped the package before he bursts out laughing and lunges across the room, pulling her into a tight hug. Jody emerges from between the bookshelves a few moments later and joins in the hug.
“What can I help you with, Dean?” Bobby asks, sounding out of breath as a gun goes off.
Opening the door, Dean stomps his way inside, toeing his snow covered boots off and kicks them off to the side while Castiel enters more quietly. Dropping his jacket and gloves on the bench by the wall, Dean feels another shiver run through him as goosebumps break over his skin. “Want a hot chocolate?” Dean asks Castiel.
“When did you get her?” Sam asks in confusion, trying to recall when Castiel could’ve picked up a kitten.
“Fine, I’ll tell him tonight.”
“Dude relax. It’s a joke.” Dean takes a step back, sensing that Lucifer is not finding it funny. Lucifer’s shoulders drop as Dean rests a hand between his shoulder blades. “It’s the same way humans all think angels look like people just with halos and white wings. I mean you’ve seen the angels people put on the top of their Christmas trees. Come on, I don’t see any signs of the witch in here. Let’s move outside.”
Lucifer offers Dean a soft smile and a shrug as he continues walking to the back door. “Nothing. I simply showed him what a more accurate depiction of his costume would be. Or at least the truest form I could show him without burning his eyes out of their sockets.”
“Aren’t you supposed to kiss when you get caught under mistletoe together?” Claire asks loudly before hiding her smile behind her mug of chocolate as Jody rolls her eyes. Sam nods, agree just as loudly with her.
“No. When I was a few millenniums old, one of my older brother took me down to Earth along with a few of our other siblings and we had a snowball fight but we didn’t make any snowmen.” Castiel pauses for a moment, recalling that peculiar memory, a brief and rare smile flickers on his lips. “I believe that was the day the so-called snow-angel activity was created.”
“It’s morning and I needed to find another book. So is it that the Christmas tree?” Cas points to the tree behind him. When Dean nods, climbing back onto the tree, he asks, “I thought you and Sam don’t celebrate Christmas?”
“It’s cold.” Castiel frowns as he watches Dean rolls the second ball of snow around in the snow surrounding the two of them.
Laughing, Sam nods. “Yeah, you both got me.”
“Shut up.” Dean finally manages to say, making Claire laugh.
“A little bit but it’s nothing I can’t handle. What do you need?” Dean rambles on about needing advice on how to celebrate Christmas with an angel when it's their first and what sort of things he should do which only makes Bobby groan. “Bake some damn cookies, Decorate a Christmas tree. Hang mistletoe. I don’t know Dean. Your father was never one to celebrate it with you guys and as you got older it stopped being important for you.”
The rest of the day goes by without any incidents, Cas stays in the library while Dean remains in his bedroom, looking up different Christmas traditions on his laptop. Around midday, he receives a notification of an email from Jody. Reading the email he texts Sam, asking for him to pick up some small gifts that Dean says he forgot to mail out to Jody and some extra candles as he’s been unable to find the other ones. Sam texts back saying he’s already heading back and will stop the store before leaving town. He sends a second text asking about the decorations and Cas that ends with a winky face. Rolling his eyes, Dean doesn't reply and instead open a new window to find some Christmas movies. While writing down a list of movies, Dean still feels like he’s not doing enough for Cas’ first Christmas and decides to give Claire another call.
“I only learned yesterday,” Dean admits, before setting his hot chocolate down and getting up to grab another gift.
Shaking his head, Sam gives Gadreel a sad smile. “No, they don’t. Demon blood was a part of me for so long but does it define who I am now?”
Dean feels his heart flutter in his chest at the sight of Castiel’s cheeks flushing red and the tips of his ears turning pink. Taking a large gulp of his drink, he feels the whiskey burn the back of his throat but only chokes it down as he find himself unable to look away from Castiel; feeling a blush spread across his own cheeks.
Castiel shakes his head but moves further into the kitchen. “He got snowed in. When the storm first picked up, he was just leaving the witness’ house and decided to stay at a diner to wait until it slowed down but when it didn’t he went to a nearby hotel for the night. Unfortunately, the storm got worst throughout the night and the town is currently closed from the excessive amount of fallen snow.”
Suddenly feeling braver, Dean grins and leads back in his chair while returning to his own drink. “I did. You know I got another way for you to continue warming up; and it’s by far more efficient than a simple kiss. Want me to demonstrate?” He playfully wiggles his eyebrows at the angel.
“They’re a reflection of my past, Sam,” Gadreel says, surprised at the pain he hears in his voice. “They do reflect who I am.”
It continues like that. Dean finds feathers littered around the Bunker. Most he discovers in the library but a few in the garage and the kitchen. He keeps finding himself collecting them, unable to find it in him to throw them away. There’s a good dozen in his drawer when Lucifer questions him about it.
“Please, you enjoy havin - what is that supposed to be!?” Lucifer’s voice sounds horrified and it has Dean panicking for a moment before he sees what has grabbed Lucifer’s attention and then he’s laughing so hard he’s crying. There’s a boy standing by the beer pong table, dressed in a red suit with horns and a tail and a large red pitchfork in hand.
He looks up at his name, surprised to see Cas in front of him. “What are you doing here? I thought Sam said you were going with him.”
Setting the decorations for the tree by the tree itself, Dean starts with decorating his room. Taping a string of lights around his ceiling, he also hangs a couple of snowflake baubles from the ceiling before wrapping some tinsel around his desk and shelf. Gathering the decorations for Sam’s room, he quietly leaves his room hoping not to grab Cas’ attention.
“If Cas is with you just ask what he wants to do.” The sound of a crash and yelling in the background makes Bobby curse. “Listen, kid, anything you do will be enough for Cas. Don’t worry.” He says before hanging up.
Licking his lips, Castiel hums gently. “I believe that worked.”
“I think I’ll just take the hot chocolate as simple as you can make it.” Castiel mumbles quietly, struggling to keep up with Dean’s large strides.
“You just said yourself that it’s Cas’ first Christmas, he probably doesn't have any expectations. Why aren’t you asking Sam these questions?”
“Of course that’s the one you want.” Sam rolls his eyes but there’s humour in his voice. “Maybe next time. I don’t know any recipes for that one. You want to help with the pies or do you want to take the brownies and run off?”
Dean pauses in his movements, “Yeah. When Sam was still a child I tried to make at least one every winter that passed, if we were somewhere where there was snow. When he were teenagers it turned into snowball fights. Then he left to Stanford and you know the rest.” Dean shrugs without looking at Castiel. A moment of silence passes between them before Dean’s continuing with the building of the snowman.
“Because you insisted on coming along with me because you said if you had to help Sam decorate the bunker or listen to ‘This is Halloween’ one for time, you were going to kill him.”
Grabbing the back from her, Dean rolls her eyes as she jumps back from him, laughing, “Fine, you can hang it up later. Stay here just for a few more minutes, Sam’s making hot chocolate and Cas is somewhere. Okay.”
“Why do I have to wear this?” Lucifer sounds disgusted as he plucks at a loose thread on his firefighter costume.
“It’s the middle of winter.” Dean smiles at the angel with a roll of his eyes. “Winter is usually known for being cold Castiel. And a blizzard did just pass by us.” Dean grabs a handful of snow, tossing it into the air above them. Laughing quietly as it falls backs down, snowflakes dusting their hair, Dean turns back to the snowball.
“We’re not keeping it, Cas,” Dean says the moment he sees the little black bundle in Castiel’s hands. “Give it here. I’m going to grab us some dinner so I’ll drop it off at the animal shelter before picking up the food.”
“What did you name her?” Sam asks, returning Castiel’s smile as he strokes a finger over the kitten’s head. Castiel shrugs, confessing he hasn’t named the kitten yet. “Black cats are usually considered bad luck and most people don’t like them. What about Lucky?”
Before Lucifer can say anything else, Dean shuffles over. “Yeah sure, I’m choosing the movie though. And you’re doing the food runs to the kitchen.”
“Anyway, see how one is larger than other?” Dean asks with a look over at Castiel while carefully leaning against the largest snowball, wiping his forehead with the back of a gloved hand. Castiel nods silently, the carrot held tightly in his closed hand. “I’ll need your help now. Stacking them when they’re this large is kind of difficult on your own. Just put the carrot down somewhere in the snow and come over here.”
When they get back inside, Cas goes off to his room saying that he needs to change while Dean goes to his room to do the same. He tosses the bags into his room until tomorrow and dropping onto his bed in a pair of clean sweatpants and sweater, Dean begins working on his Christmas cards. He works on them until Sam shouts that he’s made dinner. A quick chicken and pasta dinner with some apple pie that Dean swears is the best he’s ever had.
Thanking Castiel, Sam heads on out to the car with a smile to himself and as he hits the main road, Sam can’t help but laugh at his brother.
“From Claire?” Sam looks up at Dean, his frown turning into a smile. “They sent us gifts, why didn’t you tell me?”
“You’re not denying it though, are you?” Claire comments, still laughing. “Listen when we get there the day after tomorrow and there’s not any mistletoe up, I’ll put it up myself. I got Jody to buy some today in fact.”
“I believe she’s correct Dean. It is Christmas tradition to kiss who you are under the plant with and the two of u are under one.” Cas innocently looks back over at Dean.
At the mention of mistletoe, Dean blushes brightly and stammers that he already put a tree up and he was planning to bake cookies but every family does that and he wanted to do something different and bigger.
“So you’re celebrating for me?” Cas tilts his head to the side watching as Dean manages to get the star onto the tree. Dean nods without looking over at Cas, instead, he only asks for the lights that are inside the blue bag.
It takes a moment before Gadreel is slowly hugging Sam back, pressing against the hunter’s chest. “Thank you, Sam.” He whispers as Sam steps back. “I don’t know if I deserve your kindness after all I did but thank you.”
Castiel follows Dean back to the bunker’s door, reaching up to rub his neck. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have given the snowman the scarf.” Castiel remarks.
“Hey Sam, think you get five mugs instead of three?” Dean looks over at Sam, keeping his hand on Cas’ shoulder. When Sam raises an eyebrow at him, he only asks again. “Just do it, Sam. For me? And thanks for the candy canes, Cas” He adds as he pops into his mouth.
“What happened?” Gadreel can’t tell what he feels in Sam’s voice but he’s sure there is disgust in it. He doesn’t respond, unable to meet his eyes, he looks to the right of Sam. “Hey, Gadreel?”
On his way back to his room to grab the tree and its decorations, Dean pauses by the kitchen. Pressing his ear against the closed door, he can hear Castiel mumbling something to himself. Sighing in relief, he quietly enters his room and grabs what he needs. Making his way back to the library, he tries to stay as quiet as possible, pausing every few steps to make sure the rustling of tree’s branches against the floor or the ornaments knocking against each other in the bags doesn’t arouse Cas’ attention.
Cas follows him to the tree and is picking up a gift that has 'Dean' written on the wrapping paper when Claire shouts out Dean’s name. The both of them straighten up, each holding a gift for the other person and look at her. She pointing at something over their heads with a large smile on her face. Instantly, Dean knows what’s up. Taking a deep breath, he glances above their heads where on the Christmas tree a bundle of mistletoe is resting on branches.
“Wonderful.”
His decidedly human therapist laughed. “Oh, no, no. I’m friends with two of your brothers, a demon, and I’ve met your mother. The latter is
“Using them once a week is different and you know that,” Sam pointed out, and Castiel grumbled irritably. “I’m just—worried. About you. Since—”
Cas’s hand was in his hair, carding his fingers through it like he so often did now, and Dean felt him kiss the top of his head. Seeing opportunity, Dean pulled back, and before nerves could get the better of him he frowned and said, “You missed.”
“Since
“I would
Things you
He started drumming his fingers on the glass of water again, taking a tentative sip just so he wouldn’t have to talk. “I believe it would be called ‘panic,’” he finally said, still looking at the glass instead of Linda. She stayed quiet, encouraging him to continue, which he did so begrudgingly. “Irregular breath patterns, tinnitus, blurry vision.” He cut himself off before he could say more, hating the way the memory leaped to the forefront of his mind with vivid willingness. “I’m sure this is not unusual for you to hear, Doctor, or Sam would not have steered me in your direction.”
“I am not above purposefully knocking over your milkshake, you know,” Dean warned, with just enough joking in his tone that Castiel was pretty sure he didn’t mean it.
Castiel argued.
“Truthfully, I’m not sure. Had all gone according to plan, I likely would have departed a day or so ago, but my life quite often doesn’t.”
The woman spotted him first.
“Oh.” Castiel nodded sagely. “That makes sense. Thank you, Sam.”
“He’s not agreeing with you, because if
the coffee was a feat in and of itself.
“Ah...you see. About that.”
“I’m an angel. I don’t have anxiety.”
“Are you alright?” she asked quietly, and Lucifer just patted her worried hands with a small, reassuring smile.
“I love you,” Dean said suddenly, opening his eyes so he could watch Cas as he said it. “I love you so much, Cas.”
“If you hate fruit so much, I’ll just throw out the apple pie I made then, too.”
That gave him pause. He hadn’t really considered the latter, but now he figured that it might actually be a bit more useful than the former, considering his current situation. “Well, both, I suppose. They don’t seem to be going away anytime soon, so I admit that it would be worthwhile to make sense of them.” And then, more to himself than to Linda, he added, “I could control them then, at the very least.”
Linda's confusion dissipated, replaced with another one of her warm smiles. “Chloe.”
“You know I hate surprises,” he warned jokingly. Cas rolled his eyes and brushed past him wordlessly, sitting down on the edge of the mattress and patting the spot next to him. Dean took it, a small, bemused smile playing at his lips as Cas gingerly set the gift in his hands.
“You live a relatively ‘normal’ life yourself, don’t you? I mean, I’m assuming you aren’t
“Relax, Castiel,” Linda attempted to soothe, eyeing the new weapon in his hand. “You aren’t the first celestial being I’ve met, and, with the way things are going, I can assume you won’t be the last.” She smiled. “I am still very much human and very much a therapist, to answer your next two pressing questions.”
Cas’s return from the Empty had been messy, ultimately ending with his grace in a bottle and the rest of him decidedly human, but for the most part he remained his weird little self. He wore his grace around on a cord like a dog tag, and so long as he had coffee, bagels, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches he seemed largely fine with his new mortality, which was something Dean was still struggling to wrap his head around. Technically, they had only needed to remove his grace to get him
“I don’t—Cas I
Lucifer asked, earlier amusement replaced by a voice as sharp and dangerous as a scythe.
“It was actually quite illuminating,” Castiel replied, sinking into the edge of Dean’s bed. “Thank you, for the recommendation.”
“You alright Cas?” he asked, the rest of his body stepping through the door frame. Shock stretched his features when he saw Castiel’s face, and Castiel made an attempt at shooing him away but then suddenly he was falling forward and Dean was gripping his shoulders to keep him from hitting the floor. “Woah, easy, easy.” Dean guided him to sit down before pulling his hands back, still knelt next to him but not touching. “You havin’ another freak-out? Where have you been? You look like—ha, you look like hell.”
to go except for his own want to avoid. That was a fine enough reason in his eyes, certainly, but he knew Linda wouldn’t be all that pleased and he was starting to chase after her approval like a lost puppy.
Castiel chewed the inside of his cheek, trying to figure out how to phrase what he really wanted to ask without sounding intrusive. “Does he genuinely care about her?”
“Oh. Hello, Dean.”
“Lucifer, enough,” Castiel heard Detective say, but he didn’t want it to stop. This was
“He really shouldn’t be—” he started, but Sam interrupted him.
“And you look like a religious zealot,” Lucifer retorted, setting the three glasses on the counter. “We’ve both changed.”
“You too, Linda,” he replied easily, bowing his head on the way out. It felt weird to call her by her first name, like they were old friends when in actuality they had just met, so he resolved to simply call her “Doctor” in the future. Not so formal that conversation would be stilted, but formal enough to where he could keep his boundaries.
Dean blushed furiously into Cas’s jacket, about to tell him off for being so sappy when Cas suddenly asked, “Did you actually wish for anything, or were you just entertaining Jack?”
“Surely that’s not
Castiel rolled his eyes. Of course this was Lucifer’s fault. “Then, as I’m sure you know, Aziraphale had that sword with him. As it turns out, he wasn’t very good at wielding it.”
“Uh… the one called Angel Cookies? I don’t think so. Istill need time to.. you know… recover,” grimaced Sam as his mind reminded him of the
“Uh, yeah, I did,” replied the hunter, “A long time ago, but wait, is… Dean the millionaire or the one who is… bought?”
He shook his head, trying to erase the image from his mind. He’d rather not imagine this. Really not.
Dean’s face was a mix of so many intense emotions, it was impossible for the younger Winchester to guess what he was thinking. Shock was obvious, but there was something else for sure.
“Well, he doesn’t bring people usually,” retorted the taller man.
Castiel spent several days following his visit to Lucifer sore and irritable, limiting his time at the bunker to avoid questions and keep his bitter mood from ruining what sliver of peace the Winchesters were experiencing while they waited for their next case to drop. Granted, that only served to make him
“And fries,” Sam added helpfully, shoving one such ketchup-drenched potato stick into his mouth. It was a miracle he hadn’t gotten any on the hotel sheets. Castiel smiled slightly, and Dean relented, seeming to have decided that whatever Operation Cheer Up The Broken Angel he had been executing was accomplished. Cas smiled even more at that thought, and he relaxed enough to return to eating his cheeseburger. This one was underwhelming taste-wise, but he didn’t dare say it, shoulder still warm from where Dean had brushed against it. When had he started doing that? He could seldom recall a time where he and Dean—he and
“Castiel—”
“They would cause it just to have something to do. All of this to say: when your siblings have spent the last decade of your life actively working against you, not even counting all the times before that you can’t remember, finding even

been trying to get her on a tangent that was not about him. And then she laughed a bit, shaking her head. “Sorry. It still gets me sometimes. The whole...everything. Anyway, back to you—people with anxiety often have difficulty developing a strong sense of self because they spend so much of their time trying to conform to what they think other people want.”
“I’m still allowed to ask
“It’s what we do,” he answered instead.
“Not to worry,” Castiel interjected, stopping what was almost certainly going to be a lewd joke about “doing stuff.” “I promise I have no interest in your latest female conquest.”
two of them,” Castiel muttered back, not liking the look Lucifer was giving him.
Dean ignored him and pushed the remains of his milkshake over to Cas.
Sam grinned. “‘Course, man. I’m glad it helped. You gonna go again?”
Castiel tilted his head, giving a slightly stupefied laugh. “Go ahead.”
“You bled,” Castiel pointed out lamely. He wiped his own face clean of the stuff with the afghan hanging over the back of Lucifer’s couch, enjoying the way it made his brother scowl, before joining them at the bar.
“Bad example. If your therapist gave you ‘homework,’ that just means it’s something she wants you to do between now and the next time you see her.”
He had been a soldier of Heaven, for Christ’s sake! So what if—
A few moments later, the door clicked and unclicked again, and shortly thereafter Dean appeared where Castiel had been standing a couple minutes prior. Castiel noted the relief he felt upon seeing him, and additionally noted that actually paying attention to how he felt wasn’t as “insurmountable” as he had initially thought. He thumbed the journal where it sat in his pocket.
To his surprise, Lucifer let him go, standing up with nothing more than a hard glare in his direction.
Well, damn.
Also not the smartest because the motion caused him a twinge of pain, and he poked his collarbone experimentally. He gave a shaky sigh of relief when he found it in a better state than a few minutes ago; he was still healing, albeit glacially, and that was enough of a small comfort for him to compose himself.
Castiel started shaking his head before she could even finish. “At the very least Lucifer would understand what I’ve done, or express a simple indifference. Amenadiel—the eldest, Father’s greatest warrior—would never extend such forgiveness.”
“Happy birthday, Dean,” he said, faux-scowl replaced by a genuine smile as he lit the candle. “Here’s to another forty-two years of you being insufferable.”
“It’s the principle of the thing, Dean.”
Dean thought fondly, and he shifted so his arms were wrapped around Cas’s waist in a loose hug as he pressed into his angel’s shoulder again. “Happy birthday, honeybee.”
Castiel ignored the question, and her enthusiasm. “When you say you are ‘friends’ with two of my brothers,” he began, voice lower than his usual, already gravelly tone, “to which ones are you referring?”
(and probably definitely
Cleaning up their case in Los Angeles proved much less difficult the second go around, despite Castiel acting jumpy and on-edge the entire time. The creature had moved locations—it wasn’t stupid, after all—but the very sight of it had thrust him back to where they had first encountered it, and it was all he could do to just stand there trying not to flip his shit while the Winchester brothers did the brunt of the work. Whether it was to save his pride or just avoid a difficult conversation, Castiel wasn’t sure, but neither of them had brought up his uselessness as they had packed their things to head back to Kansas. The topic had gone untouched the whole ride home, too, and they still hadn’t brought it up in their days since returning to the bunker. Castiel didn’t know if he was grateful for it, or frustrated that they wouldn’t just communicate with him; maybe it was a little bit of both.
“I’m not saying you do—” though her expression seemed partial to the idea that he did—“I’m simply providing a human example of your dilemma, so you don’t feel as isolated. You are
Shoving aside any fraternal sentiments (those times in Heaven were long over, after all, and reminiscing was a waste of time), Castiel turned his attention towards the left half of the penthouse, declining to explore Lucifer’s bedroom for fear that he might find more condom wrappers. He took a delicate seat on the tawny leather couch, finding it to be surprisingly comfortable.
He took all of this back moments later when the silence was broken by a twig snapping under a foot that was not theirs, causing them all to stop with hands hovering by weapons. Maybe walking in an eerie quiet hadn’t been so bad after all.
Without warning, Castiel lunged at Lucifer, tackling him to the ground and slamming his fist into his face with an angry growl. He grunted as a shot went off and a bullet bounced off his shoulder, eyes flicking back towards the woman for just a moment before returning to Lucifer. He tried to punch him in the jaw but Lucifer dodged it easily, looking towards his companion with an apologetic smile.
“I think—yes,” he replied, his own voice slightly watery, unsure of whether or not he was misreading what was happening. The hardness in Dean’s face crumbled, replaced by a small, happy upturn of his lips.
“I guess I did say that, didn’t I?”
“You are correct,” Castiel agreed, uncertainty hedging its way into his voice, “but I don’t understand half of what I
“What is it exactly that you do, Castiel?” Linda was giving him a funny look again, as if she was trying to piece together something entirely separate from the surface-level topic of their conversation.
“Oh, the distance isn’t a problem,” Castiel clarified.
“You must be here for Dr. Martin. Castiel, yes?”
“Nothing,” Castiel answered flatly. And then, with a humorless chuckle, “A small miracle, maybe.”
“Wait for more cases, mostly,” Castiel said carefully. “I used to poke around and do other things for Heaven, but they...well, you know all about that. Not a whole lot of orders from there come through to me these days.”
“I would like to unpack this ‘insurmountability’ in a moment, but...” She narrowed her eyes, giving him a bemused expression. “Kansas?”
In the months since Cas’s return, Dean had yet to return the three words that had saved his life, and he knew it was unfair of him but he had been terrified that if he admitted his feelings aloud everything would slip between his fingers again, the final cruel joke by a malevolent god that had realized the only way to break him was to give him hope that it might really all be over before crushing it beneath his boot.
“I know,” Linda said gently. “And certainly, that transition must not have been easy. Better understanding yourself—this new, human ve—”
“That...sums it up quite well, actually.” Castiel was becoming almost unnerved by the emotional aptitude of this therapist. Though, that was what they were paid to be, wasn’t it?
So was their waitress, apparently.
He returned to the bunker and almost immediately passed out from the exhaustion of his trip, rubbing his hand over his face and instantly regretting it as his new bruises pulsed. That wasn’t even to mention his sore, burning back muscles, which were rapidly taking first place for “which part of Castiel hurts the most;” the trip to Linda’s office and back was exhausting enough on ruined wings, nevermind the several added detours to hunt down his hedonistic brother. He must have groaned audibly, because a few moments later Dean was poking his head into the room, looking mildly concerned.
“Why aren’t you in Hell?” Castiel answered in a tone just as low, straining against his brother’s grip. “Where you
“It’s disruptive.”
“I have something that might help.” Linda set down the clipboard and pen and went around to her desk, rummaging through a couple of drawers before returning to her seat and handing Castiel a small notebook.
“At least he isn’t openly flirting with her, Dean. We have
Chest heaving, he dispatched what he had figured out was the fourth and whirled around when he heard what sounded like a fifth, knife coming up instinctively to attack. He halted suddenly, blade resting inches from the throat of what was decidedly not a vampire.
Sorry this took so long to get out! As you can probably guess, I could not keep up after school started, haha. Updates are definitely going to be more haphazard until I finish the semester (and beyond, if my workplace opens up again), but unless something changes I'm still in it for the long haul :,)

Linda nodded, and Castiel sat back, wringing his hands. “Ha. Of course.
is why I don’t tell anyone,” Castiel finally snorted, moving to push himself up and away from the bar. “Especially not you.”
“Yes,
Castiel tightened his grip on the glass and suddenly it shattered, causing him to jump a little in surprise.
Thankfully, he could hear the rock music echoing down the hall as he approached the garage, meaning that he had almost certainly found Dean. Knowing that his friend likely wouldn’t hear him over the roar of electric guitar, he walked with heavy feet in hopes that he would feel him coming instead. Evidently, it worked: Dean looked up, hair damp with sweat and what looked like oil, and Castiel allowed himself a small smile at the grease smeared across his nose. He walked towards him, and Dean reached over to turn the radio down.
who are drawing these emotions forward, considering they aren’t particularly emotionally apt themselves.”
This and other things he was working on repressing when he found himself at his now-weekly therapy appointment.
“Apologies,” Cas said. “You’ll have to let me try again.”
Fun fact for you, stressful (?) fact for me, this chapter does not exist in my outline, which is part of why it took so fucking long to get through (that, and I rewrote the diner scene at least three separate times). The concept came to me in a dream—the “concept” being “give Dean an opportunity to make a joke about washing Cas’s tie again”—and I woke up and was like “ok sounds good” and decided to shoehorn it in and deal with the aftermath later; that’s mostly a joke. I figured what comes in later chapters needed more set-up, and I also wanted an excuse to be bit self-indulgent, lmao.
“I don’t—” And then he caught himself, because he had been getting good at that. “Novak. Castiel Novak.”
Castiel had spent the rest of the way to Petoskey folding and unfolding the cardboard car they had decided to keep to try and keep his mind occupied (this particular car had happened to win the lottery because it was the least-greasy of the three, and despite Sam’s vehement protests that it was still disgusting Castiel had sided with Dean, again, and now Team Free Will had a fourth member). When they had finally made it to their campsite, that action had turned into erecting the tents, which had taken far more brainpower and he had gotten wrong several times on purpose before finally finishing just as the sun had started to go down. Sam and Dean had spent that time gathering information on their case, and with that, they had settled into a small routine: during the day, one of them would stay at the campsite while the other two did research for their case, attempting to pinpoint where, exactly, people were being found after these “bobcat” attacks, and at night Castiel would sit outside and guard them while they slept. Dean had insisted several times that that was not necessary, and he could sit in his tent if he wanted, but Castiel had argued that looking at the stars was a fine way to spend the time they were asleep. Plus, he had had his car to keep him company.
“Not to me. Like you said—you are going through a lot at the moment. I just want to help you through.” He looked up and found her eyes to be profoundly sad, as if she had come to some heartbreaking realization while he had been preoccupied with his palms. “Do Dean and Sam make you feel as though this is disruptive?”
if it meant that.”
“You haven’t even opened it yet,” Cas argued, still holding his gaze. Dean looked down at the box in his hands, speechless. Now that he knew what to look for, he could see the faintest outline of blue peeking through the opening he had made by anxiously thumbing at the lid. He folded the top of the box back, swallowing thickly. Settled atop the neatly-coiled cord it was tied to, and pulsing softly with otherworldly blue flame, was the small glass vial that had hung around Cas’s neck ever since he had come back from the Empty.
“I don’t know,” hesitated Sam, “it’s not the same for everyone, but basically it’s acting or saying stuff that would make the other person know that you… love them.”
“No, I’m not,” groaned Sam, taking Dean’s beer and drinking a sip as he ignored the frown of his brows.
This couldn’t be happening. This just wasn’t possible. Sam was stuck in some kind of bad dream. How was he supposed to explain to an angel why some actions he did could’ve another meaning?
“History stuff, about… the Second World War,” replied Sam slowly.
“She was a very beautiful person, not just outside but her… just her…” wondered Sam out loud, “She was funny and clever, and she kept on stealing my t-shirts and then pretending they were hers. She loved to bake, she used to bake cookies every weekend.”
“Uh… I… I don’t know man,” hesitated Sam now facing Castiel, “I guess people… interpret your relationship however they want, and maybe you did say some stuff in the past that could make people think that you… really appreciate Dean.”
At some point, he walked back to his room, where he finally looked at the time. It was two in the morning. Damn. He always tried to go to sleep early so he could go on a run in the morning but he couldn’t move his eyes from the story. He had studied the Second World War at school but this was way different, it was a perspective he had never even imagined. He had to admit it was well documented and very well detailed.
“Oh I bet they are,” she chuckled before adding, “tell your brother that I’m gonna give him some reading recommendations.”
It was seven in the morning when Sam woke up. As he entered the kitchen, he immediately noticed his brother missing. After all these years, Dean always did his best to wake up early, or at least that’s what he said each time he would be up because of a bad dream.
Stepping closer to Dean, Castiel started, “Dean, if I believe what Sam told me earlier, it appears that some of our behaviour, what we say or do, can be very common in friendship but can as well be interpreted as couple material.”
“Well, I am aware of how most animals court each other,” started the angel, “ but humans remain something very different since it always involves feelings, which, as you know, I am new to. Therefore, I suppose I cannot do anything but hope that Dean returns my sentiments.”
He remembered this was a fanfiction on his brother and his friend but even he had to admit that as he read it, the characters started to… have a life of their own, and he didn’t associate them with the people he shared the bunker with. He didn’t move from his seat, unable to form any thoughts that wouldn’t be linked to the story he just finished.
“And what is that?” exclaimed Dean.
The angel in front of him slowly nodded as he considered what Sam had just said.
When he got into his room, he put the plate on his desk and opened his laptop, finally answering his friend.
“Well, I don’t know, first you tell me that Dean does dig Elvis, then you talk about Cas wondering whether his and Dean’s behaviour is the one of a couple, and now they go out together to have pizza when we both know how much food means to your brother?” stated Charlie without even breathing, “I mean, sorry for saying but are we actually sure that the stories can’t become real?”
His eyes finally closed, allowing himself some rest. He had a dreamless night and it probably was better this way so he wouldn’t have to deal with the possibility of
Even though Charlie didn’t really live with the hunters, she still decided a long time ago that she would have her own room that no one but her was allowed to use.
“This part was… surprisingly fine to read. I mean… it was good to see that in a certain way she was remembered,” he said, smiling softly.
He had been shocked to see how good the story was written, and the few parts he was mentioned in did feel quite strange, even more so when he read about Jess. Jess and him.
, here there was no slow-burn and the characters were attracted to each other immediately.
“I’m not sure but it was something like… fags?” resumed Cas, “I am not sure of the meaning but I suppose it was an insult. That led to us being kicked out, and the other man as well.”
Charlie’s mouth agape, she turned to Sam and the hunter smiled excitedly, delighted to see his brother facing his emotions for once in his life.
“Yeah, of course I am,” affirmed Dean while staring at the floor.
“Yeah um, I just… need to…” tried Sam, his eyes going back and forth between his brother and his laptop. “I just wanna finish reading first. You know, get it over with.”
The three friends were done with dinner in an hour, and Sam was cleaning the dishes while his brother prepared the popcorn and Castiel waited in the Dean-cave. The younger brother couldn’t help but send short glances at his phone as if he was drawn to it. After all, Charlie had sent him a new link and… this was weird. The whole situation was… weird.
“It was accidental,” intervened the angel, “I used Sam’s computer and the page was still on, I just wanted to know why people would think that and if you and I could be a good couple.”
“Feeling better Sammy?” he asked.
“Hmm, hmm,” hummed Castiel mindlessly without even trying to move.
Neither Sam nor Charlie dared to move, too scared to be the one who will be the victim of Dean’s anger.
“Yeah, don’t worry,” replied the younger man, “And it’s Sam,” he added, taking the seat next to Dean.
“Yes,” replied Castiel at the same time.
“Charlie I swear if you-“
There was something odd in this situation, how easily Dean was going back to his stuff and how long Cas’ wondering gaze lingered on Dean. But after all, Sam had been the one to bring up Cas’ behaviour with Dean to him, so he could only blame himself for all of the possible awkward moments.
Out of nowhere, Sam’s phone rang and as he checked, the name CHARLIE appeared on his screen. Glaring at his brother, he answered the call.
“Dean,” tried Sam, smiling awkwardly as he closed the laptop, “it’s uh… nothing… we… it’s not important,” he added, pleading Charlie with his eyes to help him.
“Reading sad stories about characters sharing our names?” proposed the angel smiling softly.
“Uh,” tried Castiel as he joined Dean, “Is this the fanfiction that made you feel down lately?” he asked, looking at Sam.
The thought of informing his brother came to his mind, but he quickly forgot about it, not ready to face once again a Dean pissed off about ‘douchebags-that-can’t-live-their-own-life’. He closed his laptop, finally deciding to ignore the information as he went to the kitchen, trying to find something to eat.
“Reading?” repeated Dean narrowing his eyes and walking into the room. “In your whole life, you never ever stayed in bed this late. You’re sure you’re not sick or something?”
Sam clenched his jaw, he should have known that sooner or later this question would come, and even if time had passed and he was okay now, he still felt guilty and sad when the conversation turned to Jess.
“I’m fine, thanks Charlie,” mumbled Sam, ignoring the questioning look on Dean’s face. “So… what’s up?”
His surprise grew even wider when Dean asked, “What are you reading anyway?”
“Deaaan,” exclaimed Charlie standing up to greet her friend, “How are you?”
Lifting his eyes and noticing his brother and the angel arguing about some movie, Sam took his plate and stood up.
“Okay,” sighed Dean, “Let’s go to the Dean cave, I’m pretty sure I still have popcorn there.”
“Great, so just so you know, the pain will disappear at some point, then, also to let you know that I’ll be in town tomorrow, maybe tonight if I drive fast, so I’ll definitely pass by!!” she said, her voice getting higher with excitement.
“Yeah, actually, he met her once only, but he said he liked her. Of course, if he had tasted the pie she made, we would’ve fought each other to keep her.”
In a second, Dean’s lips were on Cas’, softly pushing against them, as he raised his hand to put it on the angel’s cheek.
“Thank Dad for that,” Lucifer replied, giving a small smile. The smile dropped as Castiel threw himself at him again, giving an animalistic snarl as he threw his fist towards Lucifer’s face. Lucifer caught it, shoving his arm down and swinging at Castiel’s head. Castiel ducked and punched him in the gut, causing him to exhale sharply in response and kick him back. Castiel crashed into the back of the couch, using it to hold himself upright as he got his legs beneath himself again. Lucifer didn’t move as Castiel reoriented himself, only springing to action when he started throwing punches again. He blocked each one with ease before grabbing Castiel by the wrists, spinning him around and shoving him into the wall.
it was. The towering liquor bar certainly wasn’t doing his first impression any favors, and neither was the discarded condom wrapper left haphazardly by the piano. Still, Castiel couldn’t help how his lips quirked fondly at the sight of the well-polished keys—Lucifer had always had a deep affinity for music, leading the choirs up in Heaven and humming to himself while he was working or walking about the Silver City. Always humming.
“I do,” she replied. “A little boy. He’s quite the handful, but at least he doesn’t fly.” Her grin turned cheeky and she laughed, like there was a deeper joke that Castiel wasn’t getting, before she started giving him that weird look again. It was different this time, like she had solved the puzzle instead of being in the process of piecing it together. “Anyway, enough of me. Did you happen to use that notebook I gave you?”
His therapist smiled at him warmly, as if pleased by this minute progression forward. “You said that these feelings you’re having are new to you. What makes you think, then, that they’re permanent?”
He stopped, surprised by the lump that appeared in his throat and the nerves that numbed his fingers. Swallowing, he forced a wry smile.
“What small miracle would you suggest first?”
“That does sound like her,” Castiel replied, allowing the vivid imagery to play out in his mind in hopes that it would squash whatever yearning he had momentarily experienced for a hug or a pat on the cheek from the Goddess of all Bitchiness. “My apologies you had to endure her wrath. Our mother has never been particularly fond of humanity—I presume she’s been returned to Hell?”
Dean bumped his shoulder and he snapped out of it, realizing that his friends were starting on their second helpings while Castiel hadn’t even made it more than two bites into his first. “You think too much,” Dean said plainly, eyeing Castiel’s hands. He followed his gaze downward, finding that his fingers were white-knuckling his greasy dinner, and he bit back a bitter laugh. Yeah, he did. He thought way too damn much. “Case later,” Dean continued, knowing now that he had Cas’s attention, “Burgers now.”
Sorry for dropping this much heavy shit a mere three chapters in, I was just feelin real dysphoric and anxious this week and that’s how I dealt with it. I promise some of Cas’s therapy sessions will be good for laugh, and the rest of this act should be a bit lighter :,) also, thanks to
normal about any of this!” he cried out, and he put his head in his hands. He could tell she was trying to be reassuring, she really was, but he felt like he was constantly on the edge of crying over nothing and blubbering about what were objectively nothing more than
“Mom was here?” he still pressed, voice soft and admittedly more tender than he would have liked, because he
Cas smiled a little bit into the sink.
“My ‘homework,’” Castiel said, nodding. He pulled it from the pocket of his trench coat, thumbing the pages again. It had become a habit for him in the week since he had received it, and the bottom corner had started curling up towards his touch. “It was quite helpful.”
matter, Castiel,” Linda replied gently. He moved to argue but she held up a hand, stilling him. “I cannot pretend to know what you have done. Even if you told me in excruciating detail, my humanity would likely prevent me from understanding. But whatever it was—you are allowed to grieve the losses that came with it.
