"I thought Nick was going to explode when you went calculated all that stuff in your head," Barnes stated. "It was unbelievable so see her calculate every person's in that buildings totals in her head."
Toni was definitely reading a tone with him now, but she was aware that it could all be in her head. "You just have to hope that you didn't let anyone else touch my stuff as then I might have to explode, JARVIS. I know Clint has been eyeing my Private selection of alcohol," she said as she stepped into the elevator. She didn't have any time to waste. She had to get her reactor checked out.
She tried not to laugh when he smell checked himself. "I don't smell too bad." He leaned closer. "Now what does it do?"
She could hear the worry in his voice, but that wasn't enough for her. "You should've alerted me." Lately, she had been feeling left out, an outsider to Toni's new world, and she felt like the current events had sealed it.
When the town car arrived at the Tower, Pepper didn't waste a second before she dashed in. Her heels clicked loudly against the floor as she rushed through the lobby. The first place Pepper headed was the labs, knowing that it would be the first place that Toni would be. However, just like searching for something and not finding it, Toni wasn't in the first place she looked, and Pepper's irritation was growing.
Toni's eye twitched as the screen flicked on. "JARVIS," she called. "I have to update your security that was way too easy for Fury."
"Why am I here, Salty?" she asked. He was fishing for something and she didn't want anything to do with it. "What do you want from me?" She was never the one to beat around the bush.
"Toni," he said sternly. "You need to worry about your health. You can't do this to yourself. You need to sleep."
"I love you two," he says as they make it to their room. Seeing them smile makes him the happiness guy ever, and who the hell cares if he is missing Movie night for another week. Heck, if he really cares, the three of them can watch a movie from their bed. He has all that he needs with these two, and he has all the excitement that he can ever want staring back at him. "I love you," he repeats, unable to stop himself from repeating those words over and over again, even when he can't even think.
"So why did you bring your very attractive grandson then?" Toni asked. Yes, Trip was attractive; however, Toni was anything but attracted to him. She had no desire whatsoever to do anything with that Shield Agent, even if she acted like she did. This was just a game to Toni, so she could hide her feelings. It was one of the many masks that she worn to protect herself. She didn't know what she would without her masks. "Just to tease me?" She would need to make another mask to hide her guilt.
"Let me go!" Harley cried as he kicked his legs. Being held by Savin, Harley looked small and weak, compared to the glowing man—yes, Toni was still trying to get used to it.
"No, Boss. Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes had retired to their shared quarters shortly before the movie started. The Sergeant was extremely distraught and distressed about something."
"It's one thing to be introduced to her, but you can't just walk up to her. Steve, you can't. You have to wait until she comes back from the past and you can't tell anyone. I need you to promise me this." He took a deep breath. "I know it'll be hard for you, knowing how much you care for her, but you can't. If your paths meet, then so be it, but you can't go to her. Promise me this."
she do? She couldn't work at Stark with her Father, thought it would be funny to see mini her when she was born.
Even if made her skin craw and her short of breath, Toni wondered for a second if the water would feel differently if she just jumped in clothes and all? She was already shivering, already freezing. Already panicking. She was already at the brink, where there was no turning back. No saving herself. Against her better judgement, she wondered if she would sink to the bottom, weighed down in wet clothes. She wondered how long it would take her to die like this. How long would it take for the water to enter into her lungs? How painful would it be?
"And I will handle, Fury," Clint said, taking a step forward. There was a look in his eyes that even Steve would be weary of; it screamed fight. It screamed that he was ready to ride into battle and win, and only a fool would doubt him. "You stay here and take care of Stark, Rogers. Nat and I will take care of Fury."
Toni was on a military base somewhere in the middle of some country, and she had no idea where, not that she really cared. All she wanted was to go home where she wouldn't be feeling this way. She had gone through her whole life without feeling like this, and she hated that she was feeling it now. It was more than just losing a friend. Losing Bucky was something more than just… just like whatever she had felt with Rogers. Each of those kisses were something more than a kiss, and she knew it, but she didn't want to know that.
Peggy glanced back at Howard before following Toni out of the room. It was clear that she wasn't going to take a 'no' for an answer. "Why don't you want Howard to wake up? What aren't you telling me?"
she wasn't sure what she was looking for, she eyed each person walking by, making sure they were real. She wasn't sure what qualifications she was using to verify them as 'real,' but she stared at each of them for a good few seconds before moving on. She wasn't why she had such a bad feeling in her gut, but there had to be something, as this feeling in her gut couldn't be wrong. She wasn't crazy, damn it.
Toni let out a sigh as she patted Steve on the upper arm. "It's fine, Cap," she replied. She took a step away from him and toward Hill and Fury. "These two aren't anything I can't handle."
"Did anyone else miss me?" Toni asked, ignoring her beating heart. Her chest felt constricted, and her reactor felt heavier than usual. "Wait, what am I saying? Of course, they missed me."
The Archer pops a few popcorns into his mouth as he watches Tony get comfortable between Rhodes and Romanoff. "What? You're going to be main show tonight," he says with a smile. There's a smirk on his face. A fucken smirk.
Toni was finding it difficult to read to the Sassy Agent, who seemed to be holding herself together in the misty of everything. The genius from future hadn't even stepped a foot in this camp before, and yet, she could see the memories of this camp. She could see Rogers as he tried to keep up with the rest of the men. She could see the other soldiers being cruel to Rogers as he struggled. She could see it all in her mind, and she was barely keeping it in, but yet, Peggy seemed unfazed by their surroundings. It was impressive.
What Peggy did next completely surprised everyone including Toni who never expected that behavior from Peggy. She picked up a gun and shot at Rogers, who quickly held up the shield to protect himself. The bullets dinged as they hit the floor. "What the holy shit fuck, Sassy?" Toni stated in shock. Did Peggy just shot at her boy toy?
"Sometimes, the best weapons weren't created to be weapons." He turned to the door. "Let's go find Doctor Erskine and Mr. Stark, and I want to speak with both of them."
Steve's jaw was firm in place, and it took everything he had not to hold her tighter. It took everything he had not to run away with her, keeping her hidden—but safe from everything. "Yes," he finally said after a few long seconds.
"Well, I think that was meant for you." Banner said, pointing to Toni. "Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news."
"Um," she muttered, trying to sound innocent. She doubted he would like either nickname; Shrimp really wasn't anything to be proud of. And Captain Asshole wasn't exactly nice. "You don't need to know." She put on a smile and skipped away.
Steve gave her a look, as he tied the pull straps on the shorts. "I don't need to see anyone else to know that. I don't need anyone else to know how I feel. I don't
On the other hand, Salty seemed to trust her a little more, allowing her to work alone, and he also learned that it was a mistake to leave her in the room with her father. The last time that she was, she threw a wrench at his head. Howard had dodged and laughed it off, but the Colonel, annoyed that neither of them would tell him why she threw it, thought it would be best to separate them for a bit. Peggy, though silent, did not approve, which Toni could see as plain as day.
"Come to momma," she uttered, trying one more time to make herself longer. "Yes!" she shouted, forgetting about Rollins for a second. All he did was groan. "Fucker." She was just too excited to worry about him, as she was able to get her finger on the case and wiggle it to her. It took her a few seconds, but she was able to get it close enough to pick it up. Her joy, however, was shot lived as someone grabbed her from behind and threw her out of the car. It was like her foot was never trapped as she was removed from the car with ease. She would've marked that as a good thing if it wasn't for the fact that she was thrown to the ground like a sack of potatoes. God, did that hurt? If she wasn't bruised already, she would be back and bruise all over.
"Not for me?" he asked with a smile. His teeth were showing this time. "I'm not like Phillips… or Steve. I would like to think I'm different."
Steve was going crazy in this tower, while everyone else was doing something to save Toni. It made the whole situation worse as he could do nothing. How could he say he loved her, while he was doing nothing? It made his whole body ache, thinking about how much he failed her, and it only made him angrier.
"None that I'll say in public," she winked, "but the name is Toni…Sark." She stumbled over the last name. She had a few bedroom nicknames, but they did not need to know them.
The second item was a letter, a lengthy letter. Like the photo, it was faded along the folds and edges, but unlike the photos, the letter didn't have the same level of wear and tear. It looked younger than the photo, a clear sign that photo was taken years before the letter was written. However, the edges had little rips and folds to them. There were a few faded spots, but being faded in only a few spots, the letter wasn't impossible to read.
"If I was lying, I would come up with a better lie. No one in their right mind would believe a time traveling story."
With her, Bucky had been that friend, who made her laugh and supported her through everything. Even if she didn't want Barnes there, he was there at her side, and now he wasn't. In his place was some pain that Toni had never felt before. She had lost people, but this loss struck her hard and she didn't know how to deal. Coulson's death was different. She could handle that. "Why?" she asked, trying to hold back her anger.
She knew he was correct but she wasn't going to let him be right. "I can handle it," she stated. With a deep breath, she said, "in the future, there are women in the military and they are serving in the field."
"Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, and so do you." Natasha pushed off the wall, as she pocketed the flash drive.
Toni wondered for a second if they would've yet her go if she was male, but that didn't matter. She didn't have time to think about shit like that, when she had to get home. "What do you think?" she asked.
Trying to get a better look, she pushed herself up through the pain. There were a few odd tanks that looked out of place, but it was the men, who caught her attention. There were so many of them and each looked like they had been through hell; however, they probably looked better than she did, which wasn't fair. "Goddamn it," she cursed. She fell back again; she tried another but the same thing.
Toni had no interest in going back, even with the dropping temperature. She didn't care that her body was about to drop, and she even wished for it. Her nightmare—No Nightmares. Too many to count. She wasn't sure she wanted to count, but the number didn't matter, as the Nightmares—No matter the number- were still fresh in her head, and no matter what she did, she couldn't rid herself of
Steve wanted to say, 'there are times,' but Rumlow appeared out of nowhere, bring in Shield agents behind him, and that stopped the Captain in his tracks.
battle with Skully as Zola had given them what they needed to finish off Schmidt for good. "You should stay behind and rest," Peggy replied, stepping to Toni's side.
Steve hated when she played this game, but if he wanted to get to through to her, he would have to play. Without saying a word, he sat on the ground and scooted close to her. He could feel her itching to get away, but he wrapped an arm around her, pulling her into his chest. He could feel her struggle in his arms, but he didn't let her go, not this time. Instead, he tucked her head under his chin and place a kiss to her head. His fingers danced along her skin, as he tried to comfort her. He wanted her to know he wasn't giving up.
Steve closed his eyes. Bruce was correct; she was hard to read, even if he could tell when she was nervous or scared (though she would never admit she was). If he had to guess using all of those insults, she wouldn't return this feelings; however, with Toni, logic meant nothing. With her, insults were a sign of affection.
She leaned her head back to look up at the Captain. He was cold to the touch, but he had a smile on his face as he offered the Candy Cane to her. "Where did you go?" she asked, noticing his coat. "You're cold."
"You have to be ready for anything," she said as she tried to kick him. As he caught her leg, she tried to mask what she was feeling. She couldn't believe that he was getting to her.
"Tell me it's gone," Toni said into his chest. "Tell me it's destroyed." She needed it to be destroyed- needed it gone.
Again, the stupid expression on Maya's face made Toni want to punch her light out, but struggle as she might, the genius could do nothing against her restraints, which cut into her flesh.
It wasn't my idea." she said, her tone not exactly friendly but not completely nasty—which felt off putting with her smile.
"Potts is planning to take Stark back to Malibu with her," Natasha revealed, when Steve didn't make a move.
JARVIS turned off the music completely and turned on the speaker, so Toni could speak with them. She wasn't going to let them in, even if she wanted the food Pepper had.
"Fine is not an appropriate term to use when defining your current state," she says. "With your IQ, I have expected a-"
Before he could finish his sentence, Toni snapped and slugged him in the face. Not expecting that, the private fell back. "Do I punch like a man too?" she retorted, as she tried not to wink in pain. His face was boney and it hurt. "Is that why you want me? Because you're really a woman and someone needs to wear the pants."
Toni saw Bruce down the hall, staring at something in his hand, but with her rapidly beating heart, the first thing that popped into her mind was bolting without not saying a word. She couldn't deal with being around people, and that conversion with Rogers made it all worse. She couldn't stand to be here anymore, and without a second thought, Toni made her way toward the garage.
"A challenge you will lose," he said, wondering if he would regret that. Toni had done some scary things in battle, almost giving him heart attacks. He could imagine the old man jokes if anyone knew.
There were a few glances toward the person calling, but they all turned away once they realized he wasn't talking to them. Maybe, he's really calling to me? She turned and her mouth almost dropped. It was Rogers, but it wasn't Rogers, well the Rogers she knew at least. There in front of her was a small man (if she could call him that), and one word came to mind when she saw him: shrimp. She was sure that he was the smallest man on the planet…Okay, being overly dramatic, and it made her wonder how the hell he became Captain America.
That hit him harder than he expected. He knew her for the one liners, but to hear it from her now just reminded him that she wasn't the Toni he knew. It also stung to hear her say those insults to him, but it was his issue, which he would have to deal with. He knew it would be difficult the first time they met again, but he didn't think it would be so soon. He had no idea that Fury was bringing in Toni, and he wondered if Fury did this on purpose.
"Well, when you make your own dinosaurs, you can make them look any way you want, Tones," the Colonel says, softly.
Then a light bulb went off in her head as she felt something in her boot. The knife, she thought as she reached down to her boot. She bent her knee, trying to get her boot closer. She wiggled her fingers trying to work the knife closer. Toni did a side glance to the remaining hydra soldier who had completely smashed the device. He turned to the Female Commander waiting for a command. "Bitch," she curse, as her vision started blacken.
"Again, look at me," she replied, as sweat poured down her face. Even with the ice cold snow, she felt like she was on fire, and she didn't know if it was because her nerves or what. It could also be the cold, which she was banking on. She was a baby when it came to the cold.
Listening to his heartbeat, she knew he wanted to talk without him having to say it. She could hear the hesitation in his chest. However, she didn't know if it was something that she could talk about. One, she didn't know what was wrong with her, even though she knew that there was definitely something wrong. Two, she didn't know how to talk about it—whatever it was. She may be a genius, but she didn't know how to say it. How to form the word. Three, emotions were the enemies, and admitting them made you weak. Toni knew this belief was foolish and she shouldn't feel this way, but it was in grain in her.
"A hero, like you? You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle," Toni snapped, getting into Steve's face even if she was a foot or two shorter than he.
Killian smiled as he turned from Toni and headed to the door. When he stepped pass Steve, he paused for a second and straightened out his suit jacket. He looked over at Steve and smiled. "Congratulations are in order, Captain Rogers, and don't worry I won't touch your
Rolling to her side, she extended her arms to 85-degree angle, putting the tips of her metal covered fingers into the water. The water sprayed up like a continuous water gun, which spewed the suit with massive amount of water. It was soaked in the matter of seconds, almost like she did a cannon ball in the water. The suit was almost hidden behind the man-made waves leaving only the path in front of her free. This just drove her forward into the open water.
Pinning her arms against his chest, he trapped her in his arms. "Why don't you go with your SHEILD buddies? You don't want them to leave without you," she said, staring up into his eyes. "I wouldn't mind that."
Still fighting her sore muscles, it hurt every time she struggled with the chains, and her wounds had reopened in her efforts. "Bastard," she cursed as nothing worked. Only, the chair bobbled in her feeble attempts. "Fuck," she yelled as she couldn't even tip the chair over. She didn't even know why she tried, because she was wasting her much needed energy. She could already feel herself drift and that wasn't good.
. At first, Toni had gone down to her lab to work on one of the many suits that she was been creating, but she couldn't focus. Not Tonight. Their last fight had replayed in her head, and she was too guilty to design. Too guilty to lie which number she was currently, so she left a few seconds later.
In a haze, Toni found herself sitting in a backseat of a Sudan staring out at the busy streets of New York City. She had just awaken from another bad dream, which was the norm for her. "Peachy," she replied, as she slowly pushed herself off the door. She felt like an old lady as her bones cracked.
"What the hell?" she whispered as she had to jump over Rogers' body. "Idiot." She said, kneeing down. "That mustn't be comfortable." Hesitating for a second, she brushed the hair out of Rogers' eyes. "You're too cute for your own good," she admitted. She would never say that to his face as she would never hear the end of it. As she stood up, she looked over Rogers, who looked smaller than normal. He didn't take up much room on the floor.
When Natasha hacked her way into the Stark's mainframe—something Toni was going to flip over, not that it could really be called Hacking…as she used Steve's code…he didn't know how to use it—and found the message from Toni, Steve felt like could breathe again. He had been able to think again. He was able to live again, as the very thought of living in this world without Toni scared him. Now, that may sound extreme—with the very idea scaring even him-, but she was the only person left from his past. She was the last person to see the
"What unit are you with?" Steve asked, reaching out his hand for Toni to take. Without saying a word, Toni took it.
At first, Toni just stared off as she was in total disbelief, not believing that he had said that to her. Did he really say that to her? Did he really make a joke? Was the world coming to an end? There was no way this was her Captain America. He didn't joke.
"It is not looking well, Boss," the AI replies. "Whenever the team prepares to attack, the droids morph, changing their makeup and making their attacks ineffective."
"Well, I hadn't taken a shower in a while as I was rotting in a cell," she explained with a smile. A second later, she felt her stomach rumble in hunger again.
When she got to the restroom, she turned on the water and ran the water over her wrist. It stung on contact. After a little work, she was able to get the caked on blood off, but the cuts were visible. "Hopefully, no one notices," she prayed. She didn't want the questions that would come along with it. "At least it isn't as bad as my face," she smiled. Though her hair had hid most of the injury, there was a bit that was still showing. "At least the bruises are gone." She didn't have to hide them with make-up that she hated.
Howard let out a sighing chuckle. "You're stubborn." He rested his hand on her knee again and kept his eyes trained on her face. "If you wish," he said.
Though she wasn't a girly girl in any shape or form, she still tried to keep herself looking hot. She smiled, because even with a cast, she still looked good. The cast could not hide the fact that there was no fat on her body, but it couldn't hide the scars eithers. A one long one down her left side could be seen. Shaking her head, she turned back to the bed and picked up the dress she was going to wear. She set it on the ground and stepped into it. She was able to put it all the way up and slip her arms into it, but she couldn't zip it. She needed both arms for that. "I guess I could ask Barnes to zip it for me," she said as she looked in the mirror.
"You love it!" Clint said, turning to the television. There was some news program on in the background, playing softly.
Toni closed her eyes and laughed. "Trust me, you won't miss this spunky mess." She tried to push him off, but Barnes wouldn't let her go and just held her tighter. "And you can let go now."
Watching Steve and Peggy, it was heartwarming; though bittersweet at the same time. Peggy didn't last long before she flashed back twenty years. It was a stab to the gut, and Toni could see Steve's face fall at the change. Spending time with Peggy felt good as that woman could lift any heart, but it felt amazing in her good moments. Her bad moments felt like someone was stepping on her heart with cleats. It was a nightmare that wasn't going to get any better.
Steve's eyes fell as he stepped toward her and wrapped his arms around her. He held her tight, not letting her go. "Talk to me, Toni."
"I can see how uncomfortable you are, and I've noticed how jittery you get when you go out by yourself."
As he entered the room he had been staying in, he wondered maybe if he was the crazy one. Even though everyone was worried about Toni, he was the only one who was having trouble sleeping. Maybe, the lack of sleep was getting to him and he was overthinking this. Maybe, he wasn't thinking logically. Maybe, help from Loki was the only way. If so, why was he making such a big fuss? Shouldn't they try everything regardless of if they liked it or not?
Romanoff snorted at that one, but she didn't say anything. The same couldn't be said of Toni, not that she had ever shut her mouth. "I could get more ladies than you any day, Barton," she replied, giving him the biggest grin that she could muster.
Toni glanced to Steve for help, and their eyes met, but Steve didn't make any movement. He just smiled at her like the traitor that he was. If they're dating, then it was requirement for him to come to her aid whenever she needed it, and she needed it now. "I t-think I'll be the f-first one to die from hugs," she said. Her voice muffled in Pepper's chest.
"You don't even know who she is?... She doesn't know who she is," Bucky commented. "She could be some murderer or at least dangerous. I know she's gorgeous, but that doesn't mean this is smart."
Rhodes let out a harsh sigh. "It's the matter of when it suits you," he replied, harder then he intended. He forced himself to take another deep breath.
Toni didn't know if she ever wanted to go back to the Tower with one of the reasons being Steve. She didn't think that she could face him, after everything that she had said. She was beyond cruel to that man, who had been nothing but kind to her. She cut him down at the knees, knowing exactly what to say. She didn't mean any of it; in fact, it was the opposite, even if she refused to admit it to anyone. She knew why she did it, as she would be saving Steve the heartache. Even if she was able to get over her own guilt, she wasn't relationship material at all, even if her father thought she was. With that regard, he was wrong. Dead wrong.
look good in a mini skirt. Trust me on that. And my bed side matter is horrible—like atrocious. No one in their right mind would want me as their nurse. I'll totally make it worst."
She knew he was lying, because she had seen it in his face and had heard it in his voice; however, she wasn't going to call him on it.
"Is that what happened to the thing in your chest?" he asked. His eyes dropped to her chest where the covered rector was located. His eyes hovered.
"Being handcuffed doesn't seem fitting either," she asked, raking her brain for an answer. "So why am I in military custody?"
Annoying her hatred at being called Sark, Toni snorted, because she knew the bad guy handbook. She knew he was lying; no matter what she said or what happened, she wouldn't be safe. He would kill her after he was done with her.
Steve laughed. "Someone like her isn't capable of murder. When is the last time you heard of a dame killing someone? They don't have a mean bone in their body." He turned his attention to a photo of his mother on his nightstand.
Hello, I am sorry that this took so long for me to post this. I was waiting for my Beta, but she has a life...well more importantly she has finals, which are more important this. So this is unbeta. Be warned. My grammar is not the best; however, I want to get this out since it took me so long to update.
As the words started to sink in, Toni started to shake in anger as she got to her feet. "Despite what everyone thinks, I am not a child, and I can make my own decisions. You are not my mother. You work for me, Pepper. Not the other way around."
"Phillips? He said you would call him by that stupid nickname. I'll tell him you are up. Just relax," the nurse ordered, getting impatient with her.
Clint let out a heavy sign. "It looks like something already has," he replied, ignoring the deadly glare the Captain was sending toward his way. "Cap, don't look at me like that." He paused for a second before turning away. "Toni always gets herself into deep shit, but she always lands on her feet, and this time won't be any different."
It was already dark out, like it always was when she got off work. She hated that. Right now, she really missed Happy as he would never allow her to walk alone in the dark. At first, she loathed how protective he was, but now, she missed it. She also missed her Iron Man Suit. O' God, she missed the suit, as she didn't remember how she lasted without it.
Howard let out a sigh. "Hey," he replied, as he stepped to them. "I am not impossible. I just know what I want."
Tony shakes his head as he orders FRIDAY to stop the playback. He doesn't want to think how nice it feels to have someone take care of him. He doesn't want to think about the warm feeling in his chest, because this can never happen. "I don't want that to happen again, FRIDAY," he orders.
I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors…Can we just…just let me…" she said, finding it hard to find her breath. Though she was completely naked, it felt like something was sitting on her chest, applying extreme amount of pressure. "Just let me catch my breath, okay?" Tears were running down her cheeks. "Please, don't go, alright? Please." She was in full panic mood.
He looked at her. "My mother had always taught me to be respectful to ladies, and you make that difficult." He placed the thick folder he was carrying on the table. "Did your mother ever teach you manners?"
Before he could reach and pull her into his arms, Toni stepped out of his reach, though regretting it a second later. She could see the hurt look in his eyes as his hand hovered near her, and it only made her feel worse. "Sorry."
The name snapped his focus back to the woman in front him, and he found herself staring at her with large eyes. She was still shaking, but her fear was replaced hope and…desperation. She was inching forward, trying to get a look at his face for some reason. As no long one had ever had so much interest in him, he wasn't sure what she was looking at or what she wanted, but she was staring at him with such an intent look. It was different than how his handlers looked at him; it was nicer, and he liked it. He could stare into her eyes for hours.
It irked her to hear him say that. Was that why he didn't love her? Was that why she couldn't make him proud? Was it because he wanted a son? A son to carry on his legacy? Was this why he and Rogers got along? Did he consider the Captain a better legacy than she? "You better watch your mouth," she hissed.
Toni leaned back in the passenger seat, feeling the warmth from Steve's hand on her knee. She wasn't sure when Steve had placed her hand on her knee, but she enjoyed the feeling. "What, from the 1940's?" she asked.
Toni gave him a look as she stepped away from the door. "You're just trying to keep me busy." She knew what he was doing and she didn't care for it. She wasn't a child who needed to be watched.
He took a look the Doctor, who had not looked back. Banner's eyes were focused on the failed object in front of him. "How's that going?" Steve asked, not wanting to admit the truth. He usually didn't do stupid shit as he left the stupid shit to the other avengers.
Trip laughed. "I don't know about that, but I'm a Shield Agent. Agent Antoine Triplett at your service."
Toni looked between the two, glaring. "I don't like shoes. Can't feel my toes," she replied, wiggling her cold toes. She glanced down at her filthy sockets, which were forming holes.
Toni nodded and let him go. Barnes was still giving her a weird look, but she waved them off. "Go! Have fun. I'll be fine!" she yelled. She waited until they disappeared from her sight before she started back to the apartment for her supplies.
When Toni left the lab, she couldn't feel the fingers on either hands. That Hydra core seemed to have the power she needed, but it kept sending a nonstop flow throughout the device. She hadn't figured out how to limit the power of the core so it would only spit out power when she wanted. It also kept dimming the lights, which annoyed everyone in the lab including her father who eventually kicked her out. She couldn't believe it at first, but he told her that she had played with it enough. She figured it had to do with her numb fingers as he had seen it shock her a few times.
"Fuck," she muttered as the hallway was shadowed in red lights. "Calm down," she told herself. She fought the urge to run, because they would surely notice her running down the hallway. She was dressed as a nurse, someone who was supposed to be here. If she ran around without a head, they would know she wasn't a nurse and she was the escaped prisoner. "Calm down."
"For that question," she replied as she stepped toward her device, which was sitting on a metal case. Wires traveled down the side of the case and away from the device. The dirt drawn circle had been washed away, leaving a muddy mess in its place.
Fury glanced at Toni, eyeing her for a few seconds, before he typed something on his phone and showed it to Steve. Toni could barely see the text from this angle, but she could read it: 'ears everywhere.' A loud chortle almost escaped her lips, having to use everything she had to keep it down. It didn't surprise Toni in the least, as it was SHIELD. Plus, it would align with what Sharon had told her. Fury liked to know what his pets were up to at all times.
, and as she thought about it, it made sense. Total sense. "No," she yelled at herself. Toni didn't have time for this, as she had to deal with the insane Aldrich, whose dream would mean the end of them. He didn't care about human life. He didn't care about anything besides himself.
She glanced toward Toni again before looking away quickly. "You were almost assaulted. It's no laughing matter, Sark."
Something in her mind snapped as Toni realized who she was talking to. He wasn't her friend; he was friends with Colonel Salty, who wanted her secrets. "Nice try, but I won't tell you anything," she responded, knowing it was already too late. She stated too much.
There was something in his tone. "We can fix that," he replied as he spun her to look into her eyes. Placing a gentle hand on her chin, he tilted her face up and claimed her lips with his. He pulled her tight against him as he sucked on her bottom lip. Toni could feel a groan form her in throat as his worked hands up and under her shirt, caressing her back.
it. He hated that he had to pick. How could he chose between the woman he loved and saving people—his purpose? Both way, he would lose a part of himself, and he didn't know how to live without either. He was a soldier, and saving people was what he did, what he lived for. He had been a soldier for so long that he didn't know how to live a normal life. How to live without war. He didn't know who he would be if he wasn't Captain America, but at the same time, he didn't know how to live without Toni.
Natasha was in a momentary trance as if it was still her serious and upright fiancé who sat next to her bed at every post-war meeting. I don't think brainwashing could turn a person from a technological idiot to a technological genius, wondering how he got interested in this, Natasha tried to talk about the science that she was familiar with in layman's terms, except for one thing, she had left back doors in all the programs she could access, and by the time she could bring Steve home, she could easily destroy most of Hydra's electronics.
He remembered the technical advisor who had just left Hydra seemed to have something to tell him when he had met the new agent at S.H.I.E.L.D. during the day. He remembered the way he had pinched the tips of the girl's nipples to painful proportions on one side and fingered them quickly in her wet mouth after he had sighed into her belly when he had found out she was pregnant and thought she didn't want to love the child. He remembered, that shield ......
Steve was a little surprised that Toni trusted him so much. It was like being in a sci-fi movie, so he sat down in the workshop, took out the pen and paper he had with him and began to draw. The armour and workroom furnishings were easy, but he didn't know where to start when he wanted to draw Toni at work here. Rubbing his forehead, he realised that it was time to go and meet Toni for dinner.
Bruce's research had been slowed by this and he had worriedly asked Natasha if something was wrong, but Iron Woman had simply replied while Steve was out that everything was fine, not wanting to add to the good Doctor's worries that he couldn't solve.
Phanie froze, "I am indeed new ......" Those brown eyes seemed to have a magic that made her forget to question his words for a moment. The man took advantage of her daze, a dodge around the blade to seize her sword, and put the sword back into its scabbard before handing it to her, "I recently went on a trip with the Prince, no wonder you new here do not know me. I see that Jar ...... my father does like you, and this one was given to him by me ...... my Prince last year."
The girl clearly didn't want to answer that question, she rolled her eyes and lunged up to muzzle the man's question with her rosy lips. She kept nibbling on Steve's bottom lip and the corners of his mouth, on the rare occasion that even Captain America felt like he was running out of lung capacity.
"Just a few touches in front of your admirer, and that's how wet it is? What a fuck." He said and then deliberately fiddled with the two red nipples and let out a low laugh. The girl he loved was holding his head at the moment, just wearing the expression of a mother looking at a pampered child, and asked with a soft smile, "Did you hear all that? So you're jealous?"
"Well," Steve said, half-truthfully, knowing he couldn't hide it from Tony, "because I have to sleep in the guest room without my Omega's comfort."
In the afternoon Toni took her new boyfriend - who she mentally reminded herself was a fake - back to Malibu's villa. "Can you swim? It's a waste not to go down to the sea on a nice day like this."
Natasha struggled to get up but was still in Steve's grip and her eyes widened as she questioned, "What are you doing?" "Don't move, baby, let me try if you taste good." The man still leaned down over her breasts in their linked position to suck on the milk that hung from her body, while his thrusts did not lessen.
Steve touched the cut on his face as if to hide his secrets, "I went on a volunteer rescue this afternoon, I saw someone trapped in the rubble over there so I went to help out, I just accidentally scraped a few places."
Five seconds passed and she still hadn't remembered what she was going to say, but she burst out laughing. A "Cut!" came from the distance and Steve held her arm with smiling eyes, "Was I really that funny when I confessed my love ......?"
Satisfied that his only beloved little girl was looking up at him with a look of expectant relief, Steve grabbed Natasha's chin and kissed her tenderly on the lips for a moment, "No more being mad at me, my little genius Toni is so smart, your work is guaranteed to be too busy for her to hook up with me and give you a hard time ever again. I know my little girl is tired, we'll rest soon, be good." The man kissed her forehead and slowed his pace beneath him, releasing himself completely inside her.
Tony gave him a smile and turned to leave the kitchen. And Steve stood there, thinking back to the morning before he woke up and saw the light of Tony's reactor on his chest go out once more.
Natasha felt that today Steve seemed a bit of a maniac, sucking on her tongue as if he wanted to swallow her whole. Before she knew why, her wrists felt cold and she was handcuffed to the bed in a sideways position.
After a crazy night of fighting, Tony, who had only wanted to kiss and cuddle with his boyfriend before going back to his room, accidentally fell asleep and woke up at dawn. With his scrapped armour still lying in the workroom, he had to sneak back to his room in the morning light with his shirt, not expecting to run into Bruce, who had risen early to meditate.
The little moustached man wandered sleepily out of his room in search of coffee just as Captain America returned from S.H.I.E.L.D. Before he could enter the room, a kiss landed on his lips.
Captain America wasn't going to waste any opportunity, for this last one, and he wanted to find another way. "Tony, you can't just give up and leave me like this, did it never occur to you that you didn't have to hold on to this determination of certain death? Even if the fated one was really you, didn't it ever occur to you to use your great ingenuity to cheat fate? Tony, I know your expressions too well, you clearly had your mind set on certain death long ago. Not once in the past thousand chances have I been able to stop you ...... from making that move, I've watched your reactor go out time and time again, but don't you want to live and watch Morgan grow up with me? This last chance, I just want to ask you not to give up on yourself, not to give up hope. We will win, but I really don't know how I will get through the rest of my life if I lose you. I'm asking you to give yourself a chance to live, just take pity on me and don't be so cruel to me, Tony."
The man buried his face in the girl's chest, his voice muffled, "So which day did we get married? I can't even remember our anniversary right now." He felt the girl's hand, which was rubbing his short hair, stop for a moment, "Actually, we haven't gone and gotten married yet."
"My friend Bruce says captain and Iron man have broken up and moved on to Tony Stark. Are you aware of this, Ironman, and why is Captain America in two relationships?"
Natasha felt a little aggrieved at this point; Steve had been the one who was at a loss for words when it came to her tricks, and she had tried to persuade him to fulfill some of her dirty fantasies and have sex tirelessly around the building with the disgusted but blessing looks of her best mates. But never like this. Perhaps Steve had indeed fallen in love with her again in a fit of amnesia, but she saw little tenderness or affection in his eyes, as if she were just a large toy for him. The more she thought about it the sadder the girl could not help but get red-eyed and tried to twist around to look at the man behind her, "Stop for a second, please, my knees hurt."
Wong didn't bother to be polite with him and cut to the chase, "You know Steven has ......", he didn't say the words 'turned into ash', "but before that he left a message using the Sanctuary's unique contact ways, telling I'll give it to you when the time comes." Without pausing for a moment after the words were spoken he raised his hand and opened a circle of light and left.
Toni was breathing too hard to keep up with him, so she moved her lips to the back of his neck and hugged him tightly. And Steve secretly found that even without this damned piece of the deal, he didn't want to turn her down at all. "When you said coffee, I was wondering if I'd really come for coffee." He hugged her back tightly, praying that he could give her a little more security and the feeling of being loved that she wanted.
He pushed in slowly, not forgetting to admonish, "Make sure you tell me where you're not feeling well, okay?" The girl didn't take kindly to this as she patted her belly, "Wake up baby, say hello to daddy, come on." Steve laughed and shook his head, "You!" And without further words, he just moved himself gently.
The girl repeated "Steve" with affection, but never opened her eyes. The man thought she was going to say "Captain" and was slightly surprised, but seemed so taken with her voice that he didn't bother forcing her to open her eyes. "I like it when you call me by my first name, and you won't have to call me Captain anymore." Steve satisfied himself by running his eyes around her face twice and leaning down to bury his face in her long brown hair and sniff it before whispering in her ear, "I'll fuck you until you can't look at anyone else through me or think about anyone else anymore, and you'll only have me in your eyes and heart."
"I'm not messing around," the girl had tugged down his trousers as she spoke, "Bruce said it's fine at this point as long as you do it gently, oh ... although he's stressed over and over that he's not that kind of doctor."
The man's smile widened, "Am I supposed to know you? I think this is the second time we've met? If you count the time I just gave you back your phone."
With that Steve ploughed on again, this time abandoning the need to torture Natasha with speed and instead committing to changing the angle of each thrust until the girl could no longer control the overflowing moans, which greatly pleased him but also reinforced his desire to ravage her even more.
The day he went for the serum injection, a patch of skin on his wrist started to glow and Howard later told him that it was a sign that his soul mate's name had appeared. The name hadn't quite appeared yet and he just held his wrist and watched as Howard said to Peggy, "Peg, look at him, the serum injection will indicate his soul mate, maybe him becoming a super soldier is a sign of leaving you."
"Coffee ...... You said you invited me over for coffee." The short sentence shattered into several pieces between the two inseparable lips.
Steven seemed to know he would ask this question, the voice he had left behind in advance answered it at exactly that moment, "I saw countless possibilities on Titan, but the only one that completely wiped out Thanos was this one, I couldn't help it even though I couldn't bear it. Perhaps time and future is not to be disturbed, but among the countless possibilities, I have found one that might work. Those hours you spent with the Tesseract seem to have changed the way the Infinity Stones treat you; they don't exclude you from seeing these futures, but you can't tell anyone about them in reality. You can even relive the process over and over again in your dreams until the day it actually arrives. If you can find a way to save him before then, it will become real. The only problem is that I'm not sure the solution really exists."
That's right. They were both heroes and needed no more words, and Steve understood perfectly about Tony's heart, and as he said, if the fated one had been him, he would have gone to his death without hesitation. But it was Tony, the one person he would rather take on himself than lose.
Then she survived and Yinsen had stayed there forever. She promised Yinsen she wouldn't waste her life, so she started to get really busy and never tried to find that name again.
He stood at the bar, his quadruple hearing allowing him to catch Pepper talking to Toni from afar, "Are you really serious about that little actor? The twitter and today's party, you know there's been a lot of press cameras on you two today."
"There seems to be one right here." Grant stretched his hands in the direction of the phone booths, "They converted all these phone booths into time machines a few years ago, you pick up the receiver and you can talk to yourself at any time."
Steve swayed and grabbed the edge of a table, looking at the room with unseeing eyes. He might've even noticed the armor already, but he just couldn't focus his gaze on it for a while.
"The pretty girl is called Janet van Dyne, and you're on private property, so get the hell out of here," said Janet.
Instead of saying anything, Tony pinched his own shoulder, and Steve winced from the feeling. He'd never felt another person so close, literally in his own skin. That seemed far more intimate than everything Gail ever let him do.
There could be a reasonable explanation, of course, the distance, for example, or maybe, Tony was blocking him somehow, but Steve still felt a wave of irrational panic overwhelm him.
"The soldiers voluntarily locked themselves up in the same building with Doctor Richards?" Tony hummed. "The world will remember their sacrifice. If death from 'brain overload from too much useless information' wasn't a diagnosis before, it's about to become one."
"Hulk will play hide-and-seek with the metal bug," Steve turned to look at Hulk, and the beast gave him a satisfied grin. "Hulk will hide it far away. It talks too much."
"Why do you need this?" Steve was starting to get angry, and the attempts to fight that feeling just made him even more so. "Are you curious? Bored?"
Precisely an hour later Steve put the Beretta covered in wrapping paper into his backpack, closed the storage room and the cash register, fixed his hair in front of a mirror and went outside, not forgetting to turn around the 'open' sign. Solomon laughed at Steve's diligence sometimes, but he couldn't behave any other way, and he got used to friendly jabs at his character during the war. Steve was consistent and scrupulous, especially when he was stressed, and he was stressed all the time.
"So, she didn't order you to hurt Barrayaran children?" asked Natasha, more as a formality, than actually considering the Cetagandans still guilty.
"Go ahead, then. Your territory – your rules." The Cetagandan spread his hands. "If you think that all the people present should hear the answer."
"A little bastard that’s going to lose his ears tonight!" Ben grumbled. "He's Sue's brother. Just a gift of a person."
He didn't know how to approach him, and what touches would cause even more pain. One thing he had to do was take away the helmet and check the breath, but, as Steve touched the body of the armor with the tips of his fingers, doing it manually seemed impossible.
"How would I know? I've received an order, I quote 'to wake me up in the middle of the night and drag me by my ears from anything'."
"That was an accident." Tony looked at the staircase and waved his hand. "Hey, Steve, did you see? She's alive!"
Steve almost sighed internally. Yes, that was what Stark discovered, and he had a perfectly acceptable legend for this occasion that he didn't hesitate in repeating, with appropriate stumbles and long pauses in right places.
"I think, the first time I was stunned by people who used to steal invitations addressed to Captain Rogers," said the ba. "They'd have to have been coming after me to be able to accomplish that, right? So, straying away from the normal sequence of events, I had a chance to meet them. It's a pity it was dark and I couldn't see anyone."
"I hate circumstances ruining my plans," Tony winced. "But you still clearly need clothes and some money, right?"
"One day I'll finish it," he continued. He was watching Steve with badly hidden animosity, but his gaze grew warmer when it landed on Janet. "You came for the information, right? There's not much I can tell. But still, listen."
Without his habitual suits Tony looked younger, even though Steve vaguely remembered him being five or so years older than Steve himself. It suddenly occurred to him that he didn't know anything about his companion, other than bits and pieces of information that internet provided him with, and the few words that Tony said himself.
"Hey, Steve, had these boring people showed you the world yet? Properly?" Stark continued, ignoring Ben's grimace. "Surely, not."
Steve, without saying a word, let him go and left the room. Stark's retort left him without a will to live, let alone a will to keep proving his Empire was right in not letting a sickly asthmatic into the army, that that was on its own caring about him – in a common for Barrayar harsh and stern way. He wanted to crawl somewhere and sit in silence, since there was no gym with weight machines in his reach.
"We're like in a spy novel," she said. "Other times I wouldn't mind, but today... Steve, what's happening?"
He was going to answer, but coughed again, unable to suppress another spasm. He wanted to put his hand on his chest and almost punched himself in the face; Tony caught his wrist at the last moment.
The station had a small supermarket with a bored young guy managing the counter. He visibly cheered up, noticing Steve.
The door was open. Steve froze, all possible scenarios turning around in his head: Sue and him were the only ones with keys, but she and her brother followed Reed into space. Perhaps, they were back, or the flight got cancelled, or Reed needed something from the house. It was equally likely, however, that somebody broke in. The lock looked untouched, but it didn't lessen Steve’s suspicions. He slowly opened the door, walked in and raised his eyebrows in surprise. There was a distinct smell of coffee coming from the kitchen, and the TV was turned on. Steve thought that even the craziest burglars in the world wouldn't be this cheeky.
"I'm almost fifty," answered Stark, sounding somewhat surprised. "I've been a separate being for a long time, not really connected to my mother by anything other than the name and our heritage. I can't be her anchor."
"Just one last time," Hank whined, pleading. He looked over Janet's shoulder. "Tony, do you know that if you splash the particles on your clothes, it shrinks with your body?"
"My father has been short. Something during the construction process went wrong, or maybe, the height was sacrificed for more important things," Stark shrugged.
Steve nodded and tried to move away slightly, while still being close enough to keep warming Stark up. His cock was behaving far more than friendly, but even if Stark noticed anything, he didn't comment. He did get noticeably warmer and his feet, pressed to Steve's, stopped resembling icicles. He also wasn't breathing as hard, and, for some reason, Steve thought the smell of his perfume grew stronger.
"You're like a living history textbook that doesn't have dementia," that words sounded almost like an insult, but Tony probably didn't mean it that way. "You had friends, acquaintances, your own life. Reed said you had officer's stripes on your uniform."
"Take this," said Jarvis, who appeared beside him quietly with a book in his hand. "I think you'll like it."
It was probably Steve’s cue to say something soothing, something expected, like 'it's not your fault' or 'you didn't mean for this to happen', but he didn’t. It was, after all, Reed's fault that he, Steve Rogers, Iron Man, was stuck in the 21st century, in a world that was completely alien to him.
Then again, Steve didn't really know enough about cars to judge, since he liked them much less than motorcycles.
"You're the first," he said. "And Pepper, of course, but Pepper doesn't count, she practically lives at work. Well, I hope it doesn't count, otherwise I don't have a chance."
"You know, all this makes my head spin," confessed Tony, who already climbed the habitual for Cetagandans huge bed and wrapped around Steve in the most pleasing way. "It all started as just a favor to my mother, and now..."
"You're even more paranoid, than me," said Bruce. Steve smiled and sat down again, turning his chair, so he could press his elbows to its back.
The girl seemed surprised, her big brown eyes filled with innocence while Steve's fluids were all over her face and sideburns, and he loved the feeling of tainting the girl's innocence, smiling and teasing, "I wanted to do that the first time I saw you in this bed, and you look beautiful like this, even more beautiful than I imagined, Toni, I'd like to spend the rest of my life inside your hot, soft body and never come out."
As her pregnancy approached three months, the man's daily thoughts that he would be able to continue enjoying the girl in a few days would always strangle him, making Natasha feel like a piece of cake being watched and not knowing when she would be eaten up.
The man ignored the girl's cries of pain at first, just pulling himself halfway in and halfway out and then quickly into the deepest part of the warm tunnel, until he heard the girl's moans with a hint of petulance in them, and then slowed down a little, nibbling and sucking on her tongue, deploying both her upper and lower mouths at the same time, while saying vaguely, "Just bear with it a little bit, you'll feel great soon. "
Pepper had just managed to say, "Are you out of your mind?" when the redhead, Agent Natasha, knocked on the door of the Iron Woman's room with a serious expression, "There's a video I think you need to see, everyone's here."
The Stark's birthday party was always more of a big business dinner with a lot of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Steve was held tightly by Toni the whole time and he saw Natasha and Clint and was secretly glad that no one but Nick Fury knew who he really was.
"Do you have anything that is not useless?" Natasha's best response to kindness was to put up spikes to drive away anyone who offered it.
There are not many people in the station late at night, and as Natasha walked quickly through the station, there were few passengers like her who were in a hurry to catch the last train. There were only several homeless people and street artists who wanted to stay in the warmth of the station for a while to protect themselves from the cold, lying or sitting against the walls of the aisles.
As he passed Toni's workshop, he paused in the doorway for a while, and through the glass he seemed to be able to think of how Toni used to create the inventions that were ahead of their time here. It wasn't until Jarvis spoke up and reminded him, "Mr. Evans, madam has opened up access to the workshop for you, would you like to take a look inside?"
Another time was in the laboratory where she worked during the day. She was busy adding bugs to the Hydra program when she was unexpectedly wrapped in a warm embrace and turned around to find that her Hydra colleagues had somehow been thrown out of the room. During this time the girl remembered to tell Steve to lock the door, and Steve just laughed and increased the speed and intensity, saying that he had hung his tie on the door handle before he came in, and telling her to scream louder so that no one would dare come in. For a while, this made her not dare to look at the table for days.
"Tony," Fanny spoke tentatively, continuing after receiving an encouraging look, "and what did you call me here for today?"
Bruce soon finishes his anti-brainwashing and tells Natasha, who has been waiting anxiously, that Steve just needs to sleep for a few days and will be fully recovered, and she has finally let go and passed out.
Once upon a time it seemed he had also felt a girl's hand with an engagement ring, and several memory fragments screamed in the recesses of his mind, giving him an unbearable headache. So the big guy slid uncontrollably out of the girl's mouth and hit her face again, and the girl seemed oblivious to it, just looking anxiously at Steve holding his head feeling the pain and calling out Steve's name urgently.
At that moment someone came up fast from behind and grabbed her, before she subconsciously swung she heard the blonde man's voice from earlier, "Honey, I'm sorry I'm late." Then he kept his grip on her and didn't let her go until the men's voices were barely audible.
Steve's agency team took Toni's advice early on and they abandoned their original fancy style. Steve's clean, fresh and sunny look, combined with his kind presence at events and his ability to compliment Toni when answering any questions about her from journalists, has helped Steve's popularity to grow.
"......yeah I remember," Tony vaguely answered, "isn't it just to discuss going to find the missing General? The old man has made it clear in his secret letter, so what's the point of tossing me up so early in the morning?" Feeling a hand on the corner of his quilt, he closed his eyes and haphazardly grabbed it with a firm grip, "Good Phanie, let me sleep a little longer."
"Really? That's all you have to say? Then I'll come too." Natasha dialled randomly again, "Hey Toni, it's you tomorrow, your most important task today is to never argue with Pepper, never talk back to her, or you'll end up in a situation where you have no money, no phone, nothing. If you do, you'll also meet one less nosy man." She said and raised an eyebrow.
The man seemed to freeze for a moment and muttered something like, "Who am I? It's been a long time since I've been asked that question and I don't even know how to answer." A pair of honey-coloured eyes blinked a few times quickly displaying a smiling face, "I'm the son of the old butler Jarvis, you're new here and haven't seen me before?"
No wonder Toni said their pictures were all stupid, Steve commented that he looked like a puppy. He then quickly scanned through the rest of the texts, except for Fury's emotional outbursts like "What the hell is going on with you and that Stark?" "Don't you want your secret identity anymore?" "Did you know that this photo has been the number one trending topic on Twitter?" Nothing more important than that.
Steve paced over and sat on the couch and enveloped him in his arms, "So you waited all night for me, too?"
She looked up, the person sitting in the main seat was the young butler who had brought her to a beautiful dream yesterday. How ...... how is he so bold, how dare he sit in the prince's seat? The old butler saw her dazed and quickly reminded, "Phanie, meet our Prince?"
Toni instead let go and waved her hands in the wind, "You know I'm either in one of those fancy cars or flying around in my armour every day, cars are boring, armour is more exciting than cars but I'm flying around every day to fight, I've never sat in the back seat waiting for someone to take me home."
Natasha seemed to freeze the moment Steve leaned in for a kiss. "Why are your eyes open? Scared?" When he finished, Steve seemed a little stunned, as if he had heard that phrase somewhere. Natasha was also a little dazed, and that was exactly what she had said to him with when she had first kissed him.
There seems to be nothing suspicious about the explanation, but Captain America's instincts tell him that something is not quite right. If you don't believe him, Natasha will explain it to you. The crowd had no choice but to reply to his suspicions like this.
Steve was pleased that he didn't see that look of disappointment on Toni's face again. Then he spent all the rest of the day denouncing himself for thinking ill of his old friend's daughter.
Natasha had put little Peter to bed and returned to her room, wondering in her mind, the old capsicle had mysteriously told her to go straight to the bedroom, it didn't make sense for him to be away himself when she returned.
"Good, ok," Steve reached out to wipe away her tears for her too, then swept her into his arms, "then we'll go and get married tomorrow, okay? If I still have the honour, give me a chance to look after you and our child forever."
"I'll go pay for gas," he nodded and yanked the keys out of ignition. If Bruce didn't like his behavior, he didn't let it show. "Do you need anything?"
"Well, we can always drag you to Pym as a last resort," said Tony. "He'll bite my head off, but he'd be excited, I think. Janet, though, will just bite my head off. But if my plan worked, and my plans always work, it'll be alright. Try to pack the armor into a case."
The world was drifting away from him, like it does when you press your eyelids down too hard. Steve carefully got up, grabbing the arm of the chair to steady himself, and looked around.
Now, he was talking too fast again, like he often did, his words getting meshed together, and just listening to Tony, alive and well, made it impossible for Steve not to smile. His facial muscles hurt, but he didn't care. He was listening to Tony’s voice, not really hearing a word he said, focusing on his pulse.
"She's a miracle," said Tony. "Especially when she's not angry and the business is going as it should. You'll become her favorite fast, too." He hummed. "Maybe, your evil plan is to take my place? You're already Iron Man, and if you charm Pepper, you'll have my company, too, in no time. Jarvis's already head over heels for you, and Happy will follow Pepper anywhere. You’re already half-way to having my throne!"
Steve didn't find it funny. He kept watching Bruce intensely for the signs of a new episode. There weren't any. Steve also didn't see any signs that Bruce was lying, and he didn't really have a reason to.
"Maybe it wasn't worth it after all," he said with shaking voice. "It must feel different for you, from the inside."
"I guess so," Stark nodded and moved closer to the wall, the clothes and blankets he was packed into making a rustling noise. "I occupied your cabin, but I've no strength left to get to another. Even less so to repair the broken doors in my own."
Next to the itching came a different strange feeling, like a hundred tiny hammers hitting his skin. Steve shuddered and automatically tried to straighten up when he felt something touch his neck and glide down.
"Except for Jackson's Whole, of course," chirped one of the Embassy's officers, clearly considering it safe to speak about. "People say what they do there is genuinely miraculous."
"What about you?" asked Steve. "I don't know, how it works in your Empire, but here people generally care for their children. And you said it yourself, that she wanted you to resemble your father more than you resembled her."
"I don't need you to comfort me, Steve. Nor to cheer me up. There are only two possible outcomes: either I do this right and we can knock ourselves out playing with the armor, or I fuck it up and I'll have your death on my conscience." He breathed out, loudly. "I hate fucking up."
"I'll call Tony," said Steve suddenly, surprising himself. "Let's just get out of here." The idea was unexpected, but it made sense: Tony clearly had connections, and he was Hank and Janet's friend, he at least deserved to know.
Steve expected Tony to start talking about the armor again, but he was silent, squinting at the sun.
A map showed on the screen with a red glowing dot in the middle of it. Steve studied it – the dot was a few miles away from the site of the car accident, in some research center. Maybe, he was getting paranoid after all.
"I can imagine," Steve nodded. "So, if not to Eta Ceta, where can we go? Of course, the smartest choice would be to stay here, so we could contact Barrayar instantly, but..."
He didn't have time to say goodbye or ask, if Bruce wanted him to pass something to Betty, and it was weighing on his conscience, like any incomplete mission.
"True," Stark nodded. "The manner of the crime in question is also highly unpredictable. I think, one historically famous child that suffered from a teratogenic poisoning but compensated the disadvantages of that quite well later was enough for my compatriots to ever try anything like that again."
"Sta... Tony!" Steve breathed out and tried to keep from moving. Who know what the Cetagandan could've meant by this, and he did have long nails.
"Sam Wilson," he introduced himself. "We didn't want for it to go this way. Her reaction was unexpected."
"Calm down, I got you," he said. "So, how is it? Nothing like the forties, right? Tomorrow, we can shoot Frisbees from the roof. Or fly around the suburbs, you've no idea how much the elderly like UFOs."
Steve wasn’t as surprised as he probably should’ve been at seeing a jungle in the middle of New York. He was really lucky, in a way, that he got introduced to geniuses and their weirdness very slowly, like one would train a wild animal. First moving through time and space, then Hulk, then living with the armor, and now – a huge terrace on an inconspicuous grey building that looked like a picture taken in the middle of Amazon forest, just miniaturized. He briefly wondered what the city's administration thought about it.
Once he started to believe this new world was real, the third feeling came along: uselessness. Steve was alien here, as the reactor was alien to his body, but as with the reactor, he had hoped that a long, arduous process of acclimating would somehow make him feel whole again.
"Ghem-lord Stark appreciates certain level of comfort," the ba shrugged. "This ship is equipped with state of the art system of water and air circulation."
Steve tried to find suitable words to describe the situation and couldn't, so he mumbled something about cultural differences and that it's not a done thing on Barrayar, lying with someone and hugging them like that, if they're not your spouse or a lover.
Vorromanof snorted, showing how little she cared about a suspected spy's makeup, and how little her gender had anything to do with her duties. It wasn't quite clear how she managed to fit all that into a little sound, but everybody present got the message.
"This isn't even my birthday," he snorted. "Will I always have to break my bones to get access to your body?"
The ba shrugged. Sometimes it was very pleased with its status – having to process large amounts of information was one thing, having to think for itself however...
Steve didn't immediately realize he was talking about the link going both ways, and when he did, the knowledge of his own selfishness burned him. The fact that he could disregard privacy and personal space that he never really had didn't mean Tony had to make a similar sacrifice. He had a life, bright and busy, based on what got published in tabloids, Tony didn't need a burden in the form of a guy from the forties.
Before Loki could get up, the lasers aimed at him again and it wasn't until Loki phased out of his armour and raised his hands that the armor removed her helmet. Iron Woman's long brown hair flew wildly in the wind, as warm and flamboyant as she herself.
Steve reached for the crystal ball the Wong had left on his desk and the gruesome scene of the battle came to him, he saw him fighting Thanos with Tony and Thor, saw himself picking up Thor's hammer, saw Danvers thrown out by the power of the stone, saw ......Tony snapped then his reactor went off.
It was only when she got the "signal lost" result that Iron Woman really started to panic. "Maybe the locator on his uniform was accidentally damaged and he just happened to get lost, don't worry mate, he'll come back to the building and find us." With Clint's reassuring words, Natasha made her way back to the building with the rest of the team.
Steve stopped after a few strokes, which was a little surprising to the girl, but was it possible that her baby's father was really merciful for her today and wanted to make it quick? Before a thought could be finalised, the man grabbed her by the waist and quickly rolled her over. The sex organ buried inside her ground through all her sensitive spots, the contraction of her inner causing him to grow bigger.
As long as the two are in the same room, there is always a place where the girl is occupied by Steve. The man still loved to use her mouth and her breast, but nowadays he rarely cum out on those places. He always thrusts hard until he feels he's almost done, then pours his cum into the pussy without wasting a drop.
The man kissed her eyes, "Why are you crying, tell me what it is you're hiding from me?" When she wouldn't talk, Steve had to change his tactics, he stopped taking care of the deepest part of her body every time and just rubbed shallowly at the entrance.
Without a past, without a purpose, Phanie took up residence in the Prince's house with this name that she didn't even know if it was hers. The old butler gave her a place to stay at first because she was pitiful, but to his surprise, Phanie was so strong and gentle and patient that she began to help out everywhere after she recovered from her injuries, doing both menial and small jobs beautifully. The old butler was delighted and began to wonder about Fanny, who did not look like a young lady from a large family or an ordinary person. After observing her for a few more days, the old butler was able to confirm that she had no suspicious movements, and then he gradually put his mind at ease.
"The risk is still too great, and the Red Skull has left a message in the video that he has linked his life to the switch of the self-destruct program, and if the program does not detect his vitals every twelve hours, the self-destruct program will be activated instantly." The female agent grabbed Thor's hand to try and calm him down.
There was only one final question, "Will you patronize again?" The two tacitly left this blank together.
"Because I've heard Miss Stark is hard to get along with?" Steve bellyached, that wasn't exactly what he'd heard, after all, there was never a time when Iron Woman and Captain America didn't quarrel.
Steve squeezed his shoulders and kissed him. Now, in the slowly brightening light of the morning, without the adrenalin and anger making them speed things up, the kiss was different – slow and careful. Steve wasn't actually sure, what either of them were doing right until this moment – everything looked different in daylight.
"Because we're not used to dealing with maniacs who would hurt children!" cried Steve, his eyes burning. "As you aren't, I hope. No matter what's going on, on Barrayar nobody would think of doing anything like that..." Then, Steve fell silent for a moment. "Alright, Miles Vorkosigan is an example of the opposite. But that was a tragic accident, not a malicious intent against the child."
"Ghem-lord Stark invites people he considers interesting practically every evening, to join him for dinner, tea or admiring constellations," the ba said, without any second thought, making Clint laugh quietly and Natasha to snort again. "Ladies, as a rule."
"I want nothing from you but information," Steve confirmed. "And I won't disturb you anymore after I get it."
The workshop was also underground, and in the workshop there was the armor. Steve almost couldn't hear its call – either Tony fixed it somehow or just kept it turned off – but the thought still made Steve shiver. He excused himself to Jarvis and disappeared into his room instead.
There was a bang from below them, so loud it made the floor vibrate. Steve looked at the floor, and only then remembered he didn't have the armor on anymore, it was still in the corridor.
Steve had an unpleasant persistent feeling that a whole eternity passed, and not just four days. He spent an hour under the shower, washing off the grime and dirt, then carefully wrapped his clothes in adhesive tape and put it in the garbage. Now that adrenalin left his bloodstream, he felt extremely tired – he didn't just fall asleep, but almost lost his consciousness the moment his head hit the pillow.
"You're going to be his favorite. I'm already jealous. And no, I've no idea where Jarvis keeps it, but logic suggests milk is probably in the fridge."
"Really?" Tony feigned surprise. "I think we will. You won't be able to resist the temptation of connecting to the armor."
"Bruce," Steve touched his shoulder again, and this time the man only winced. "I'm not leaving. What is it? Do you need medication? Do you have it?"
The lab reminded Steve of quite a few unpleasant things in his past, and he touched his chest. He could feel the reactor even through the hoodie: the cloth slid on the surface of it and chilled his fingertips. He got used to living with the thing, but didn't quite learn to trust it - sometimes he felt, as if he was drowning, choking, unable to fill his lungs with air. Steve had to remind himself how to breathe and to push away the stupid thoughts.
Hank said nothing for almost a minute, and then he slowly dragged his hand through his hair and sighed.
Ben mumbled something under his breath. Steve turned back to the window, but couldn't focus on the streets passing by: in the dark glass he could see the reflections of the chair's chromed side, part of its wheel and Tony's profile.
"Why couldn't Jarvis be her eyes and ears? That seems more appropriate, considering how loyal they are to their mistresses..."
Sometimes Steve found himself stupidly jealous of Solomon. The man was the freest person Steve ever met. He owned an art store, knowing nothing at all about art, painted gauche pictures that he gifted his friends, called himself an anarchist that didn't give a crap about anything, didn't eat meat and donated to an orphanage. He was also chatty, had a dog without a name, liked to read poetry aloud, and he hired Steve without even asking to see his ID.
"That's hard to argue with," Stark was walking around the room, like the interrogation was over and he was a full participant of the discussion. "But I remembered your legendary Count for a reason. Somebody decided to repeat his history, only with a less positive ending."
Steve kept thinking about his relationship with the armor while making Tony his coffee. He came to conclusion that it would never compare to a relationship with a real person. It was easy to love a thing that did everything you told it to, much harder to love someone who constantly contradicted you.
"Endorphins," Tony hummed. "I'm surprised at how collected you are, Steve. I was smiling like an idiot for two days after I tested the bots the first time."
"Then, it's even more interesting," Tony gave him a smile that was positively predatory. "It's not Abraham, although the adaptation makes quite a lot of sense. It's Aram Durona, from Jackson's Whole Durona group. He disappeared long time ago."
"This was the first time I could hold him back," he sighed and reached for the bottle of water. Steve belatedly remembered to hand him the bag with food.
"What did he do?" he asked, instead of greeting Clint who emerged from the shadows next to an inconspicuous door.
"I'd like, if at all possible, for Miss van Dyne to stay with you. Well, you know, in such a shocked state a person can do anything... And give me your phone number."
"A cop I knew gave me this little thing," Solomon, an old mixed-race man, an owner of the store Steve was working in, explained, as he appeared at the door. "He was working under cover. Got shot."
The people in black suits left. The only reminder of what just happened was an ambulance parked next to the building and empty corridors.
"As soon as I'm done here, darling," he said. "Are you going?" he continued, addressing Steve. "Our medics finished with Maya Hansen and learned where she wanted to go. If we hurry, we'll get the whole circus together."
Looking serious really didn't suit Tony. Steve felt irrationally anxious, looking at him, but he wasn't afraid. He was even glad, deep in his heart. Maybe, the war made an adrenalin maniac out of him after all.
The alarm woke Steve up at seven. He had breakfast in a diner adjusted to the hotel. A bored waitress there told Steve how to reach the address he had written down.
"'Cause it's Hank," Janet explained. She was still smiling, but her smile wasn’t as wide as before. "That's his way of communicating with the world. He just needs to be jealous of someone. I'm sure he'll drag you into it as well."
The Howling Commandos were an interesting group to say the least, and that was putting it mildly. She thought the Avengers were a crazy group, but these people were something else, and she had to say she was okay with that. "Four of a kind," she stated as she laid down her hand.
"Yes, they are." Came a respond from the door, startling the two. Both Clint and Toni quickly turned to the doorway to see had joined them. "Steve's not backing down, so I came to check on you," answered Bruce, who looked just as tired as they did.
The Genius' mind spun as she thought about what Barnes had said. Considering how she disappeared on Rogers, would he even care if something happened to her? Surely, after she disappeared without a word, he would have pushed her out of his mind. She knew she would have if someone did that to her. "I don't think Rogers would care." Something inside of her didn't like that thought.
The colonel had left a few hours ago and Toni hadn't seen anyone since, which pissed her off even more. Her back was starting hurt from the hard metal death trap, and she needed more pain medication. The pain had come back full force, and she was ready to snap. Plus, it was freezing in this room.
Pepper had left soon after she had come up from the lab, and it was clear that Toni had pissed her off as she had stormed out of the Tower without a word. Steve had come up from lab a few minutes later and headed directly to the couch in front of the fire pit. He didn't say much, a clear sign that Toni had pissed him off too which was hard to do.
Steve, with sketchbook open to a blank page, was seated outside a small café in Manhattan. Not a second passed without a person walking past him, and it was about every five seconds that a woman walked by him smiling. Even in old, bland, out of fashion clothes, Steve was still attractive young man, who stood out in a crowd. Though he wasn't an expert in women in any sense, he knew he was attractive and he could get any woman he wanted… well besides the one he wanted.
"You called me here, so you can talk about my rel- friendship with Barnes?" she asked, refusing to say the word relationship. They did
"Don't let it get to you head," he said as he moved the tray closer to her. "It won't happen again."
Howard still had not handed over the hydra core, but he told her that he would as soon as got back from wherever he went. He left to do something though he wouldn't tell her what, but he did say he would be back soon. It was annoying, but if Toni waited this long, she could wait a little bit longer.
"I don't need a babysitter," she protested. She was referring to both Peggy and Howard. "And don't you think that could mess up the whole timeline?" she whispered. "Is this about not trusting me?" There was also the fact that she couldn't stand to be in the same room of her father; however, she wondered if the world could take so much genius in the same room. She couldn't deny the intelligence of her father.
Toni couldn't lie to Rhodey, not that he would believe her in the first place. "Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?" she replied with a weak smile. It wasn't like she didn't want to sleep; she just couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw nothing but blood and destruction.
Toni flinched, forgetting that Wilson was even there. She didn't even know why she flinched like that, when he wasn't anything to worry about. Though, tell that to her heart. Why was she so jumpy? "Oh, you're still here."
"I can't get drunk anyways," Steve countered as he threw the empty bottom into the wastebasket. He picked up another bottle and took off the cap.
His eyes softened. "Yes, Tones. I do," he said, no guilt or shame in his voice. "Is that so hard to understand? You're important to me, and I would and will do anything for you. I thought Steve would do the same, but I guess I'm wrong. He isn't here." There was a bitterness in his voice when he said Steve's name. "How can he just leave you like this? What the hell is wrong with him?"
She studied the man next to him, and though this was all guess work, Toni could tell he had some kind of training. He looked like he could take on half of her highly paid, private security at the same time. He wasn't as big as half of her team, but he was built. She could see his well-defined biceps a mile away, and she had no doubt he had the abs to match as well. His dark skin flattered the tones of his muscles, and there was no denying he was an attractive man.
Steve stared down at the half emptied bottle. To learn that Toni was captured tested him. Not only did it scare him, it angered him. How could she go with the 107 into the battlefield? How could she be that stupid? She must've known that she would be captured? Or did she do it knowing that he would save her? Did she have that much faith in him? Whatever the case, he didn't want to feel like that again, though it couldn't compare to how he felt when he saw her falling from the sky. "I don't know. Maybe, she was looking for a way back."
him. No, it wasn't the first time she had heard those words, but those proposals weren't real. Maybe, they were in some sense, but they were just jokes—sex crave proposals clouded by hormones. They were nothing, and Toni could laugh it off while leaving the man in the dust without any regrets. Those guys (and the random girl) were nothing. Steve was
Giving the three of them a look, the young man nodded. "Yes, Sir," he replied. "I'll be outside, getting the car ready to leave."
"I-" A cheer down the bar caught her attention, and she turned to the table that the cheer came from before rotating back to Barnes. At the table was Rogers, who she would only consider an ass always trying to tell her what to do. He would probably yell at her for drinking. "Don't knock my smile."
Unable to keep back anymore, he stepped forward, wanting to look into her hazel eyes. He wanted to see her fear. He wanted to see why she was so scared. He wanted to understand why this lake had scared her so much that. Or was it something else? He wanted to know what had drawn her out at this time of night. Did she have flashes like he did? Did she have things in her head like he did? Was her mind clouded to? Was she hearing things?
She repeated to herself, hoping to talk some sense into herself. This was all just a game to mess with her head, and she wasn't going to play this game.
The Colonel, as well, was interested in that, because he couldn't think of anything reason why someone would want a glowing object in his or her chest. What could that device possible do that would make it worth putting it in her body? As it was placed near her heart, it had to have been dangerous to intergrade it into her body. He guessed it had to do what that reactor did.
He was breaking her and he didn't know it. She had promised not to leave him, even though she had to. She had to promise as she could see how broken he was and she didn't want to break him even more by say no. "Steve."
"Wasn't a request," Rumlow stated, still wearing a smile. "Rollins, here, will take you here to headquarters to see Pierce, while I collect Rogers. We may even let you fix up that suit of yours in one of labs."
"Nothing," she hoarsely answered back. As she didn't hear anything else from the guard, Toni turned back to the shadows that Loki had been standing in, but he was no longer there, leaving her alone again. Though she would never admit it, she was sad that he was gone, solely for the fact that she had been alone in this cell for far too long. She was forgetting what it was like to have a conversion with someone.
…with Toni. His brain supplied the name, even if it felt foreign to him, and every time he thought about her, a strange feeling tingled in his heart. It almost over took him; in the beginning, the feeling scared him and he wanted to destroy it. However, after seeing her and unable to stop the tingles, it morphed into something more. These feelings were completely mind blowing, mind altering, and it took everything in him not to turn around and run. But when he allowed himself to these things, he learned he enjoyed them.
She took a deep breath before she spoke, "My father wouldn't let me blame myself either, even though he knew his death was coming." The Letter was shaking in her hands.
However, he had gone too far with the woman in front of him and he knew it. She was boiling. He had hit and nerve and he knew it, but there was nothing he could do. He had shot himself in the foot, and the only thing he could do was continue the fight as she wasn't going to let it drop; however, it made him sick to his stomach. It was dawning on him that he was ruining his chance with Toni.
"Why did you miss the first?" asked Steve. The armor was scanning his surroundings, looking for the attacker.
Tony's eyebrows went up in a very telling way, and he put the paper away. There was a small black device on the table that Steve completely forgot about. If Reed had a reason to call, he called the landline, so Steve didn't really have a need for a mobile.
They stopped next to steel doors of the elevator that Tony brought them to. The guard was punching some numbers into the panel and arguing with someone on the radio. Steve leaned on the wall and looked around.
Steve pulled the door, but Banner quickly crossed the distance between them and slammed it. He didn't explain, why, but Steve didn't really need him to.
"I've only one sleeping bag," he said, somewhat guiltily. "But there are some blankets and warm clothes."
"Alright," he said. "I need to explain our course of action, I guess. We're going to get to the nearest gas station, get some food and water, then we'll get the rest of the metal out of my hand, and, since you insist on it so much, I'll allow you to make a splint. Then we'll get on a train and go back to New York. You'll work in your shop again, and I'll rebuild the armor, so it doesn't crush me next time. Deal?"
The pack of dispatches landed in the terminal shortly after. Steve quickly looked through the addresses and could only scratch his head. It seemed, the Colonel was determined to keep him as far away from home as possible: the letters were bound for Illyrica, Escobar, Eta Kita, even Athos.
Steve noticed people calling him only when Tony patted his shoulder. Steve flinched and looked at him, feeling lost.
"And that's where the cryochamber comes in, and decades of waiting till medicine catches up enough so they could heal you," Tony nodded in understanding. "Well, I'm glad it did. And that the people looking after the chamber were, as you say, burdened by morals. They could decide it wasn't worth it, after all."
Judging by Happy's unperturbed face and Jarvis calmly passing by – without the vase this time – these rows happened quite often. Then again, Pepper and Tony didn't look like they were really mad at each other – Tony was smiling slightly, and Pepper looked like she was only trying to seem angry. It was very much resembling of a family fight, and Steve suddenly felt awkward, like he was peeping through a door. His own family gatherings ended at fifteen, when mom's health got worse.
In addition to that, he learned about personalizing ancestors' spirits, constant readiness for death, presence of the divine forces and many other things that left him slightly concerned. Why did the Emperor of Cetaganda send a spy in elder colors, if those themselves show that ghem-lord Stark is much more important and valuable in the homeland?
"So was I," Tony threw a side-glance at him and nodded at a small metal case. "Try mine. I think, the reactor shouldn't cause any problems, the armor uses it as a repulsor weapon and a source of energy."
"I tested it on myself," said Bruce. "Not intentionally, mind, it just happened, but that was the most important mistake in my life."
"We'll go through the ventilation shaft." Hank rubbed his chin and frowned. "It'll be faster, and my insects will check the upper floors, too."
The corridor was empty: the guards ran away, only leaving broken guns behind them. Steve carefully looked around, but, noticing no threat, led Tony forward. They needed to leave the building, find Hank and Janet, and then sort things out with Barton. Then, Steve thought, everything would be finally alright.
"I'll teach you," Steve paused. "As for why... it'd work better if you took up eastern martial arts, but that requires time, and you don't have a lot of it. Nothing calms a person down as the knowledge they can protect themselves. Maybe, Hulk won't need to take over your body, if Bruce is save."
It was probably useless and doomed to fail, like trying to take a bone from a rabid dog, but Steve had to do something. Some minutes later, Hulk finally surrendered.
At night, Steve sat on his bad and looked at the clock. It was old, with a big white face, slightly glowing in the dark. Next to most of Reed's tech it seemed unnecessary and even inappropriate, but Steve liked it, maybe because its loud ticking broke up the thick silence of the room.
Steve thought, distractedly, that talking to Tony required so much patience it would be enough to lock Hulk in Doctor Banner's body forever.
Steve couldn't see Ben's face, but the man visibly tensed. He swore under his breath and then turned around.
"I get it," Tony nodded, "I'm not either. Besides, if I understood what you were saying correctly, it wasn’t Barrayarans who figured out how to bring any genetic material to perfection. That's already good. If father published his research back on the home planet, he would be either rewarded again or... executed. I don't know. I think, he didn't either, and that's why he preferred working outside the borders of the Empire. As for his partner..." Stark opened a photo on his comm. "I know it's not him, but does he look any similar?"
The chair was fairly comfortable, but he couldn't relax because of all the light and monitors surrounding him, the purpose of which Steve couldn’t and didn’t understand.
"There're no painkillers, Rogers," he cut off. "I'm sorry I'm not screaming my lungs out from all the pain, but that's just how I am, blame my late mother for spending too much time in the lab while pregnant."
Steve drew back curtains, opened the window and looked outside – an old habit of his making him survey the place he was going to spend the night in, even if nothing was really threatening him in this lifetime. The old paranoia kept him vigilant, and it did save his life a couple of times.
"Well, at least you warned us," Nat gave him a wry smile. "Good luck. I hope, the ghem-lord won't drive you crazy. I would absolutely lose my mind, if I had to share a small space with someone who looks like a demon from a play."
"Ramps," Tony said again. "Don't forget about them, Richards. And try to change the satellite's configuration for reception."
"I'll finish the thought." Tony twitched his fingers again, and the screen turned off. "I control the armor with nanobots. They're in my blood, and they're in the armor. I'm a genius in nanotech, actually, but you can’t learn that from Wikipedia. I edited the article." He shook his head. "Alright. That's enough. Sleep."
Steve thought about it for a bit. The last Consul was old by Barrayaran standards, though still quite in the active age for a Cetagandan. He was from an unremarkable ghem-clan and was all just... average. A true spy: of average height, average built, with classical, but ordinary face, even his ghem face paint – light-green and light-blue – didn't leave a trace in your memory.
Hearing her words, Steve imagined going through endless lab corridors, but that wasn't what Janet had in mind.
"The truth is," Bruce continued, "I was the giant green monster. God," he laughed harshly. "Never said that out loud. It's so funny."
Steve took the bandages from the bag, rolled them out and pressed to Tony's hand, to the place he just pulled a piece of metal from. Tony's fingers started twitching: his tendons have probably healed.
He opened the door and practically threw himself outside, stumbled, almost fell down, made a couple of unsure steps, and stumbled again, finally disappearing from Steve's view.
It was the first time Steve saw him. It was the first time Steve saw anything like that – a huge monster, gigantic and powerful, half a human and half a beast that had nothing of Bruce's broken vulnerability in him. He was frightening. He was so frightening, that Steve felt his throat constrict, and he saw a lot of terrifying things during his lifetime.
"About the war. About its absence. About the bombing of Dresden," he answered, putting it on a small table, bowed to Steve and left.
He raised his hand and put it into the light, to see if he could notice anything different, but everything seemed the same, no tiny robots, nothing. Nothing monstrous. Tony hummed.
In the evening, he left the mansion and walked to the art shop. It was a long walk, but Steve was in no hurry.
"You give it orders from the outside of it, but you don't have... a reactor," Steve said in an unsure voice. "A control center."
"I don't think I know how to hate at all," said Bruce, almost inaudibly. "Or just generally feel strong emotions."
"Five? Or so?" Janet paused, and Steve heard a clinking noise – she was steering her tea. "Steve, what's going on?"
On Illyrica, they lingered. Steve quickly delivered his encoded message to the Barrayaran Embassy, of course, but Tony got stuck in the local tech park, curiously named Monocrystalline Valley. He spent three days there and came back happy and pensive.
Steve took the gun, because, as he tried to explain to himself, he was a responsible person. Who knew what else Solomon would decide to do with it? He could give it to a child, for all Steve knew.
Steve stepped through the hole in the wall and surveyed the damage. The dust was obscuring his vision but it was quickly coming down. The corridor was empty, but the life he felt was somewhere close and Steve kept going towards it. He noticed a few people in white coats, then people with weapons, and he shot a few small missiles to the guns in their hands. The guards, because that's probably who they were, were thrown back. Steve checked their life signs out of habit (they were fine), and moved forward. It's like he was pulled towards one of the rooms, and when he got to it, he couldn't make himself open the door for the first few seconds, his hand frozen against the doorknob. If not for the armor, it'd probably be shaking, but the stabilizers adjusted to the tremor.
Peter didn't answer but he didn't need to because Wade knew he got the message and would act accordingly. Instead he choose to write his Dad, warning him of Steve.
“Don’t say it”, Bucky put his hand in front of me, as if this could stop me from saying anything, “If I hear you saying, that you behaved like an asshole, one more time, I am going to punch you in the face.”
"Its because I know you would never do that and just like to be a disgusting to rile me up."  Wade smiled.
So it’s been a long time since I last updated and I am really sorry. But I’ve got some comments that I still should go on writing this story and I am so happy that I’ve got this much loyal readers. So I am going to finish this story.
“What? I just don’t like broccoli man, I really don’t like it,” he answered to Peppers critical expression.
Peter didn't know what to do! He just didn't know! So he tried to talk to his Papa, maybe he could save something, but he didn't even knew what.
I walked a little bit over ten minutes through the city, until I saw his house at the end of the road.
As it turned out both Steve and Tony weren't impressed by Mrs. Rogers plan, but as they listened they realized it might be the only option left to really reach the goal they all had in mind. Tony being freed from his father grasp and in Tonys case no one being harmed because of his father.
I watched Pepper try to pull off Tony’s hood, but he just slapped her away and then turned towards me and our eyes locked.
Because Tony didn‘t want to bother both of them, after he heard their little... uhm sexy times? He decided to let them be, and threw himself into his work, completely forgetting the time. The next time he looked at the clock he blenched.
So when I could finally go home, I was suspicious but also happy to get away from all this mess, that school was the cause of.
"Dad!" Tony heard Peter scream. "Dad. Why don't you save me! It hurts!" And he would just stand there, watching Peter turning to ash in front of him and he couldn't do nothing but watch.
Mrs. Rogers sighed. "It would not be the first time the police becoming corrupt or even being forced to let a case fall because of a very powerful and influent person who forces himself on them."
It’s his kind of protection, I think, it’s the only thing he really has and fuck… I am so totally in love with him.
Besides… he somehow looked cute like this, hair still tousled from bed, but his eyes were already sparkling with excitement, his sweatshirt hanging from his lean but muscular form and his tanned skin glowing in the morning sun that was shining through the window.
When we arrived in the living room, Steve and I sat down on the coach and a few minutes later Mrs. Rogers came back in, with a tray in her one hand, and phase ten in the other one.
In the end, they tested it in the garden. Dad nearly flew into the bushes and Peter fell off of it into the pool. When they both had made sure the hoverboard was safe, they painted it in Peter’s favorite colors, red and blue and because it was already nine pm when they both finished and it actually was too late for Peter to meet Wade at the skaterpark now, but Peter’s puppy dog eyes were just too cute to ignore, Tony and Peter made the agreement that Tony would accompany them.
Fury glared at him as if he tried to set him on fire, but Tony just grinned wider and raised his eyebrows in challenge.
“Bye Peter, don’t do something stupid”, his Dad answered, starting the motor again and then he drove down the street, quickly disappearing from Peter’s sight.
Steve forced himself to look everyone in the eyes, just for a second, just to show them how serious he was.
“I’m going to check on Tony and explain him a little bit of your situation. You coming with me Rhodes?”, Pepper announced.
“Well, we weren’t really nice to him and we actually didn’t even have a reason to be so mean to him. Pepper just made us realize that we might have misjudged him and we want to make it right.”
Wade still laughing loudly in the entrance of the kitchen, holding his stomach, turned back to the hallway and yelled in Peters direction: "Oh my God. Peter you told me your Dad was cool but I wouldn't have thought that he could be this funny."
Pepper apologized for her outburst the next break, but when I asked her where Tony was, she shut down completely.
Tony had cried this night. Peter knew it because as he had to pack his things to leave the next morning the eyes of his Dad were red and puffy. He had bags under his eyes and he looked defeated. Not like the Tony Stark everyone knew anymore. Steve had cried too but he at least looked determined.
“SHUT UP!” Steve screamed. “I don’t want to hear one more excuse Tony, not one more. I am done! I am done with you, I am done with everything. I am leaving and I am taking Peter with me.”
He huffed as he flew through the skyscrapers of New York occasionally hitting some Doombots with his Repulsor beams.
Warnings: Mentions of self harm, alcoholism, graphic description of child abuse! So a lot of Tony angst. Anyone who can't read this, please don't, I don't want to trigger anything!
For a moment I just wandered down the hall, not sure what I actually wanted to do, when I remembered I had to go to my next class.
I wanted to walk past them and escape home, where hopefully I can hide in my workshop until Monday, but Mrs. Rogers grabbed me, before I could and smiled warmly at me.
Peter didn’t realize his eyes falling shut again, until some time later he woke up with a start, as his Dad’s words were finally registered by his still-hazy-from-sleep-brain.
"Yeah, true. Still a good movie", Steve yawned and rubbed his face into the soft pillow. It was cute.
“You made him angry”, Peter grinned satisfied as Ajax turned around towards Wade and in the same moment Wade’s fist connected with his face, making him tumble backwards into Angel and Norman.
Wade stood up quickly, making his stool crash loudly. The whole cafeteria went silent. Peter clenched his fists in suppressed rage.
“I will meet Sam and Nat later, we are going to train for the mission next week, you?” Bucky answered, drinking some of his coffee.
After I made myself ready, I went down into the kitchen, for Mrs. Rogers always made sure that her boys had eaten something before starting the day.
School as always was boring as fuck. Nothing happened not even the group of dumbasses that usually tormented Wade and Peter during break did anything today. It was just trying survive the seemingly endless hours of boredom and lectures.
There was a short pause before Peter heard his Dad whisper: “Okay, try to sleep” kissing his head one more time, before they both fell to sleep.
“That is the problem, Wade”, Peter mumbled. “They both still love each other, I know that and I know that Papa knows he still loves Dad and Dad knows he still loves Papa, but they don’t know they love each other.”
Peter nodded. “You are right. Uhm… do you want to come to me after school, maybe we could tell Dad and … you know, I really don’t want to do that alone.”
Peter moaned when Wades erection pressed onto his own and then slowly Wades lips left Peters, following the line of his jaw and down his neck.
Well, anyways I hope you like this chapter. It's still the beginning and therefore it happens not so much but I am planning Tony angst for the next chapters so be aware! ;D
The rest of the way Peter spent his time watching the buildings flow by and Tony indeed occasionally giving Peter a worried glance but otherwise staying silent, concentrating on driving them home safe.
I rolled my eyes at them and was about to turn back to Bruce, who was still busy drooling over Betty, when I saw Tony Stark strolling into the cafeteria.
I didn’t want to annoy them. I would spoil the party anyways with my awkwardness. They would talk about school problems and football, of failed relationships and the new movies the wanted to watch or something like that, maybe even about how annoying their parents are. I really didn’t want to talk about that.
I was on my feet in seconds, Steve’s image vanished out of my thoughts, only coldness and darkness settled in my mind.
Then Peter took his stuff and followed his Dad to the mansion living there for this week and the next with his Papa.
“It was just a dream”, Steve whispered to reassure himself. “Tony is not dead because of you, Steve, it was just a dream, Bucky is sleeping peacefully next to you, it was just a dream.”
The school bell rang and Peter and Wade made their way to their classes as Wade finally answered: “I don’t know if this is such a good idea Peter, maybe we should firstly tell them that we are together.”
"Stop talking now Peter!" Steve warned. "I don't want to hear anything from you. I will talk to your father."
They rubbed themselves against each other, moaning and kissing. Peter’s hand slipped under Wade’s shirt stroking over his scars and muscled chest while Wade wandered down with his head, pulling Peter’s shirt up and giving small kisses to his strong, muscled stomach.
“ ‘Course, here”, I shoved my notebook and a pencil towards him and he took what he needed gratefully.
Ugh. Humans were so confusing. Why can’t everything be like numbers. Numbers were simple and logic. They didn’t joke or got offended or stupid stuff like that.
“Spiderman and Deadpool, that’s what we are going to talk about today. Mr. Stark, why aren’t you reading the documents you where given”, Fury started and then glared at Tony with his one eye.
“Mr. Fury, sir, I see your problem in there but until now, Spiderman and Deadpool didn’t show any signs in being a threat, they fight villains and make the job of the police more simple, that is all. I have the feeling they are avoiding us more than not.” Steve budged in.
My heart hammered in my chest, my lungs felt too small and I only heard the rush of blood in my ears, when my father said: “If you are not back in my house the next morning, boy. I will make your life to hell and make you wish you were never born!”
My head nearly dropped off my hand, that currently was the only thing holding it up, at the sudden bang of the door.
“What’s up Tones?”, Rhodey smiled at him and the others greeted him as well. Pepper hugged him and sat down on his other side.
"I assure you Mr. Wilson as much as I like the both of you, there is no need for me to participate in deeper intimacy with you" Mr. Forge turned around and left.
A few minutes later, Thor, followed by Jane strode in, bellowing loudly : “Hello my beloved friends. I am deeply sorry, that my Lady Jane and I attend to this meeting at such a late time, but I promised her a date on our anniversary day!”
"Maybe there is", Mrs. Rogers chimed in. Her eyes were red. It broke her heart to see her son this desperate and to not be able to do something for Tony.
I still sat behind the bed on the floor and Steve stood at the doorway, the reason I still couldn’t see him.
“You know what, it’s okay Tony. Just make sure that Peter goes earlier to bed okay?” Steve gave in and then had to swallow hardly again as Tony threw him his brilliant smile and nodded contently.
I watched him, while I searched an empty chair and sat down, but he was too occupied in whatever the hell he was doing, that he didn’t notice.
"Totally worth it" Peter grinned as he jumped from the sink and knelt down in front of Wade, pulling down his boxers to free Wades hard cock from its cage.  Wade moaned and held onto Peter as Peter started to suck on Wades cock with eager anticipation.
“I know I behaved like an asshole and I am sorry, but Tony, I like you as soon as I realized what an idiot I was, I tried to be better and…and I really like you Tony!” He apologized.
“I would love to-“ Wade began as the door burst open and an old woman with white curly hair and dark sunglasses stood in the doorway.
“Clint, go back to the living room, bring Pepper, but no one else and then wait there, I will be right back”, Rhodey ordered.
The rest of the day went along as uneventful as the morning. I blushed furiously when Steve wanted me to sit on his lap when we were eating in the cafeteria, while the others laughed loudly. It was not something I was used to, being shown affection, but it was awesome. I loved it. The others laughed not about me, but with me and I just enjoyed everyone’s company it was good, life was good.
Well, the Tony I heard of at least because actually I never really talked to him and therefore shouldn’t judge him, though I just couldn’t help but feel incredibly annoyed by him.
I poked him in the side and wiggled my eyebrows at him, which caused him to blush an even deeper shade of red, if that was possible.
“Now my friend Steven, I hope you managed further steps in your relationship with Tony”, he smiled widely.
“So, do you want to finish your hoverboard today?” Dad asked Peter when they finally sat in the car, driving towards his school.
Peter quickly went upstairs to throw his schoolback in his room and then met his Dad in the kitchen again.
We broke apart and I had to swallow thickly at my thoughts. Why did my father have to ruin everything good in my life, even if he is not here?
Peter and Wade got detention for two weeks because they convinced Mrs. Finch that they didn’t start the fight and that Ajax, Norman and Angel attacked first. What wasn’t entirely true but who cares.
“What is it Steve? You called me three times today, if this is another call about how your friends annoy you with their assumptions that you are I  love with Tony Stark, what you totally are by the way, I am going to force you to massage my feet this evening”, My mom warned me and I needed to close my eyes and take a deep breath before I could say: “Mom, its Tony. He is here and he needs help and Mrs. Rhodes told me I should call you.”
I didn't knew if Steve did this on purpose but we just said, Captain America and Iron Man have the same personality as we both and then he said, he would ship them, like, what the fuck even? It was probably nothing Tony, don't interpret so much into it, it will just get your stupid hopes up and we all know that is bad. Steve probably didn't even recognize it.
"I am okay, don't fuss so much, everything is cool and smooth as I am", I smirked and Pepper rolled fondly with her eyes as Clint said: "Yep, definitely okay."
Wade laughed. “Sure thing asshat, I actually thought it already was clear that I would meet you after school.”
They went through the hallway and the stairways up to Steve's room. Since I had some nightmares in the beginning, Steve insisted that I would sleep in his room. Of course I argued against it and denied that I didn't have nightmares and I could take care of my own, thank you very much. But Mrs. Rogers found that a good idea too and no one argues with Mrs. Rogers.
Only when Tony was sure that Steve really fell asleep he got up again and changed into his normal clothes.
Steve thought about that a moment, while he ate another pancake. After he swallowed it down with some coffee he answered: “Yeah, the seem young, but I think this is the problem. When we don’t do something about them they could get out of control, they both need training and people that have their backs. I want them on the team, but Fury says, that we should see them as threats beforehand because we don’t know if they are sent to get information from us, gain our trust or if they really are just two kids trying to play heroes.”
"Peter. You know, Steve and I have nothing against you being gay. You know that don't you?", Tony tried to calm Peter.
Shortly after eight we left the house and made our way towards Shield High. Steve was a fast walker so I skated beside him on my long board to catch up with him.
His one eye was black, his lip split. He didn’t have any shoes on, was soaked through and looked barely conscious.
Wade kissed Peter furiously as his hand travelled down Peter’s body and then slipped in his boxers to grasp his cock. Peter bucked his hips and moaned loudly.
“Who?” He raised his eyebrow in question, if he actually would have one and hugged Peter tightly to his broad chest.
I nodded. "Okay. Can I... can I sleep with you... In your bed I mean?" With hopeful eyes I looked up at Steve who smiled a sad, small smile and then nodded.
Tony kissed Steve. Their lips meeting with a force of desire and love and fear and pain that both of them had to catch their breath when they pulled apart.
At least then it wouldn’t be so painful as if he does it, when I got attached to him… more attached to him.
Peter looked over to Wade again, with a silent plea to help, but Wade couldn't do anything either, so he just answered truthfully.
“I know Tony, but I also know that you work all the time and I know that Peter stays up longer than he should during school, when he is with you. It’s not your fault, it’s just how it is okay and you know, children, teenager whatever, they get more aggressive when they didn’t sleep enough. How long did he stay awake yesterday?” Steve asked in the end.
