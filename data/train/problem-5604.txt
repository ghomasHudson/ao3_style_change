At the thought, he can’t help but huff a laugh. According to his Catholic upbringing, bad men who lied and sinned went to Hell and were punished, while good men who didn’t do either went to Heaven and got to be with their loved ones again. But men who enjoyed the company of other men, automatically sinned and went to Hell no matter what they did to redeem themselves.
The path following the front felt like an endless road of destruction, made up of shattered town after shattered town--the smoking bones of people’s lives. They were often the first to come upon the wreckage, and that meant that sometimes the task of burying the dead was left to Steve and his team. That was probably the hardest thing to do. Gabe was the better speaker out of all of them; his father had been a preacher, and no one was more capable of delivering a eulogy or prayer than Gabe. Once the graves had been dug, and the remains buried, Gabe would say a few words, and they would move on to the next broken town on their road of ruin.
He’d brushed his lips against her pale cheek, but before he could pull completely away, Ana’s hand snapped up and gripped his chin tightly; revealing a surprising amount of strength for the older woman. He’d been taken aback by the spark of ferocity in her green eyes despite the situation, and he couldn’t tear his gaze away from hers. And in that moment, it was like a day hadn’t gone by.
Long before he had been put onto the battlefield, and met others like himself, Steve thought he was the only one without a Mark.
“She kinda reminds me of Granny McDonald and your Ma that way,” Bucky drawled on, leaning back onto his elbows and stretching out his legs as though he didn’t have a care in the world.
His parents make interested noises. Anthony hears his mother say “Oh really?” in a tone that’s...happy.
The doctor looked interested in what Anthony had to say. He leaned forward, his hands crossed over his desk as he stared down at him. “You
“Nah, you would’a tried a long time ago if that were the case,” Bucky grinned. Steve let out a laugh.
“I didn’t overdose on purpose!” Tony shouts, hands coming up defensively. “Give me a little more credit than
Bucky nodded. “Damn right,” he’d said as he stared up at the swirling black sky. The sound of Steve’s whittling filled the silence.
“We know that, dear,” his momma says, turning to look down at him. Her golden hair shines bright in the sunlight, making her look like an angel.
A gentle hand rests on his shoulder. Steve’s eyes flick up from the ground. His best friend gives him a small humorless smile, solemnity in his blue eyes.
“I love you,” she admits softly. She sounds so small and so very far away to him. “I don’t need a Mark to tell me so.”
Howard cries, waving his arms. Some of his drink splashes on the carpet, but he doesn’t notice in his incredulity. “He’s a
He pouts as he’s asked a gazillion and one questions, Momma and Ana and Jarvis at his sides. Ana asks if Anthony’s okay to eat birthday cake, but the doctors inform her that
Anthony can’t help the satisfaction he feels, but it’s brushed away quickly. Anthony has a message to give to Howard. “He said ‘not to fondue around’,” he repeats, scrunching his nose in concentration to remember Steve's exact words.
never told him that story, and I know you haven’t either. You haven't spoken to Dugan, or Morita, or anyone in
“Hi,” says Anthony, his voice sounding raspy to his ears as he rubs his eyes tiredly. Beside him, Jarvis stirs awake first. When he catches sight of Anthony’s open brown eyes, he perks up immediately and gently touches Ana’s shoulder. He leans forward, his usually tidy clothes looking rumbled.
Steve reaches into his pocket, releasing the controls for a moment to pull out his compass. He opens it and sets it on one of the many meters of the plane’s dashboard. Peggy’s dark eyes and knowing smirk look back at him, and somehow it’s easier. They fall quiet for a few moments; Steve admiring the view of the sky as he allows Peggy the time to collect herself. The plane glides lazily despite the speed, and he watches as the wings’ tips cut through the puffy clouds.
“Anthony,” Cap speaks softly, but in a voice that reminds Anthony of Aunt Pegs’ Serious Conversation Voice. “I’m gonna ask a favor from you.”
“Oh.” He coughed again, falling into another fit. Once he fell silent, his patient mother continued.
Anthony has to put a hand up to block the light and squints against it, distracting him from his mission with Cap to defeat Hydra Nazi bastards in the Z Dimension. He opens his mouth to complain, but the light’s gone again, leaving behind a dark spot wherever Anthony looks.
Through the charred wreckage, Steve slowly steps in the bare patches that are bereft of any pieces of crushed plaster, blackened brick, or splintered wood. He carefully lifts a fallen piece of wood out of his path, and it’s only when he has it in his hands that he catches the flash of a knob in the middle. He realizes the burnt, broken wood is actually a door. He can’t do anything except shove it aside; the blackened ash staining his red gloves as he pulls away.
“Howard,” Aunt Peggy says in her Very Serious Conversation Voice. “You remember. I know you do. Tony
“Why are you out of bed?” Jarvis whispers, holding out his hand. Anthony takes it, and follows as he leads him back to his bedroom.
And every time Steve thinks back on that conversation, he loves her fiercely for it. Every time he thinks about it, he sighs in relief. Because that small act of kindness made Steve realize the possibility that he could fall in love with Agent Carter. He probably would feel the same way even if she
“Did you respect him?” She stares at him head-on, her eyes challenging. He doesn’t deign that with a response.
He remembers that night he recruited the Commandos vividly: the haze of cigarette smoke thick in the air, bodies so close to each other it generates a heat, the smell of beer and ale and gin, the frivolity in the music. The atmosphere was warm and golden from the lamplight.
Ever since that first visit to their church in Brooklyn, Steve drew everything he saw inside there, trying hard to recreate what he had seen in those windows. When he felt good enough to go out, he would escape to the church and fill scraps of paper with studies of the saints and the rafters. Even when he wasn’t feeling his best, he and Bucky would still sneak off so Steve could sketch the inside, sometimes staying so late into the night that Steve couldn’t see the Virgin’s delicate features anymore.
“Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person,” she says, playing along. As she talks, she pulls a chair like his off the dusty ground and huffs with the effort. She sets it right at the table before sitting beside him. “He thought that could be one of the side effects.”
Steve and Bucky pass two soldiers from the regiment they’d accompanied. It isn’t long before they’ve caught up with more of the soldiers, and the various members of the Howling Commandos.
Except now, since the serum, Steve doesn’t need as much sleep anymore. He can get away with two or three hours for a few days before his body feels the deep effects of fatigue. Besides it hasn’t been easier to sleep given his current surroundings, where he’s constantly on guard, whether it’s dodging bullets, infiltrating Hydra bases, avoiding bombs, or fighting in the trenches. But every once in awhile, he’s able to catch snatches of sleep when he or another Commando can liberate a truck or car.
He does the one thing he can think of: he radios in. He panics for a minute, thinking that the radio is broken and that he really would be alone in this moment, where companionship matters most. Thankfully, it still works, and he manages to get the frequency right, calling out to his team for help. Relief floods him when he recognizes the voice on the other line as Morita answering his call.
He briefly glances up at Obie, who’s standing off to the side in his dark suit, with his thin salty hair unruly and trimmed beard. His father’s old business partner is big and broad-shouldered, his arms crossed over his chest and somehow taking up more room than should be possible considering the penthouse-size equivalent of a hospital room they’re in.
“Momma,” Anthony says with a gusty sigh at the sight of his mother. She gives him a bright smile in return, her lilypad green eyes warm; Howard gives the approximation of a smile, his eyes hard in comparison.
Bucky hadn’t liked the concept of soulmates to begin with; he never understood why the Mark taken so seriously in the first place, or why it should dictate a person’s happiness. In a way, Peggy shares the same sentiment. It’s as she’d said: Marks aren’t like fairy godmothers, they can’t be relied on to solve anything.
“Sweetheart,” Aunt Peggy says, her golden brown eyes staring at Anthony with a fierce determination, and her hands tight on his small shoulders. “I give you my word, once we take you to the doctor and make absolutely
He can’t help but wonder what this dusty pane of glass had once been: the Virgin Mary, Jesus, a Saint, or some religious figure Steve had never heard of? Regardless of who it might have been, seeing the shattered remnants at his feet steals Steve’s breath away, leaving him acutely aware of the sharp pain in his chest.
is. He protests half-heartedly as Aunt Pegs takes his hand and leads him down the corridor to his bedroom, Howard trailing behind them. Anthony grumbles the entire time Aunt Pegs helps him get ready for bed.
Every time he closes his eyes to try and sleep, he hears the train chugging on the tracks, he can feel the wind rushing past his face, and the sound of Bucky’s scream bouncing back at him off the Alps. Steve, for the life of him, never wants to see a train again as long as he lives. Just the thought of it leaves him feeling cold and brittle inside. He’s tired--exhausted, really, and wants nothing more than to mourn in peace and be left alone.
The irony, of course, of having a revelation about what a soulmate means, is having said revelation at the moment of one’s inescapable death. Despite the situation, it makes Steve laugh: the timing could have been much better.
Steve searches through the glasses that are behind the bar. It’s the same story as his search for the liquor: crushed glass, shattered glass and only a few cracked. He finds one small glass that’s whole. It’s dusty as all hell, so he spits into it and cleans the inside with a handkerchief from his pocket. He sets the bottle and glass onto the bar.
“Steve,” Anthony answers calmly, his fingers gripping the blanket of his bed, eyes staring at Aunt Peggy, confused as to why they’re acting weird. “Captain America told me.”
He sniffles once before speaking. “Doctor Erskine said that the serum wouldn’t just affect my muscles,” he says, and his voice sounds rough and hoarse even to his own ears. “It would affect my cells, create a protective system of regeneration and healing.” He sounds like he’s reciting a fact to her: detached and lifeless, as though the information doesn’t hold any value to him.
“Joanna travelled the country, sharing her visions with others, revealing spots on all who gathered to hear her and explained what they meant. She said that God had given everyone a Mark and that was what the spot on their wrists were. But it was a special mark--a mark that we could use to find our soulmate--”
at his best friend. His shoulders are slumped low, umber brow pinched together, and his dark eyes disbelieving and sad; like all the fight’s gone out of him and he’s just a puppet with his strings cut.
“ ‘Some people won’t have a chance to meet their soulmate in this lifetime,’ Joanna had said. ‘And when that happens, God puts them in a special place for us until we die. Once we die, we go to the happiest place we’ve ever been in our lives, and there they’ll be: waiting for us.’ Because of her visions, they called her Joanna of the Mark. And when she died, she became--”
Bucky had smiled and he was radiant with it. He shrugged. “Nah,” he said, as though it were nothing, and that was the best part about it all for Steve: that Bucky didn’t treat him any different. They stayed the same. “Sorry, Punk, but you’re stuck with me.”
Tears spring up in Tony’s eyes, and he can feel the scabbed over wounds of grief break open until it becomes a yawning abyss in his chest. He squeezes his eyes shut, his hands coming up to clench the shirt on his friend’s back between his fingers.
“I’m calling an ambulance,” Jarvis says decisively, laying a reassuring hand on Aunt Peggy’s shoulder before heading for the nearest telephone on a table by the door.
“It’s okay, Peggy!” Steve quickly says, and it’s laughable. But he’s glad he’s spending his last moments reassuring her. “I’m glad. I really am.” He releases a soft breath. “I’m glad you’re not my soulmate.”
To his surprise, Thor was sitting at the counter with Bruce and Natasha with a loaded plate of food in front of him.
Clint let out an amused chuckle, “He’ll come running back to you sooner or later. You always were the one he was closest to.”
Once that week was over, Pepper came, stepping out of the elevator like a furious lion, and went to the lab. Steve wasn’t sure what happened but he remembered hearing shouts as he sat on the communal floor’s couch, and things being slammed, and then Pepper was dragging a haggard-looking Tony up and pushed him into a seat in the kitchen. Food was shoved in his mouth and Steve heard her mumble, “I still care for you, Tony, just not like that,” before she kissed his cheek and left.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hands and practically sprinted to their destination, a laughable situation since three of Tony’s steps equaled one of Steve’s.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh as he got closer to get a better look. “It looks great, Tony. The colors are spot on,” Steve said and gently ruffled Tony’s hair. “Dinner is almost ready. Let’s go wash your hands and face.”
It took Tony ten minutes to transition from sobbing to occasional sniffles and even then Steve was reluctant to release him from his arms. It was only when Tony spoke did Steve loosen his hug.
, although Steve felt more sad than mad. He wanted to make the best of Tony’s deaging by giving him a fun childhood and look at where they were now.
“Now that I think about it, no, not really. He did have a nightmare a couple of days ago but it was a memory I think.” Steve’s eyes widened in worry and looked to Bruce, “Is that a bad sign?”
“Yeah! I want a car collection!” At that the group began laughing—Tony’s wish for a car collection certainly became a reality, if his garages had anything to say about it. But after the whole disassembled toasters and laptops situation, Steve was just glad Tony hadn’t wished for a laser or some type of power tool.
Steve had to crouch down to see what Tony was pointing at, and quickly saw a silk black bow tie with an embroidered red design. True to his words, the red lines shared similarities with the circuit boards Steve always saw scattered at Tony’s table.
Finally landing on the tree right at the outskirt of the playground, Steve could see Tony in the sandbox, making a robot very similar to Dum-E by using his toy rake as Dum-E’s prongs. Clint and Natasha were surrounding him, bodies in defensive positions as the assessed their surroundings.
“That they are,” Steve playfully flicked the fluffy bauble hanging on Tony’s hat, receiving a light swat from Tony and an annoyed whine that only made Steve smile.
Removing the lid, Tony reached inside the box, hesitated and then proceeded to hold up a sheer, lacy black underwear.
“C-coffee?” Steve didn’t know what to do. He began looking everywhere but at the man in front of him, as if looking for an exit. To his relief, he found it when he saw Nat, Clint, and Bruce checking out their items. “I’m so sorry, but I don’t have any time. I have to go.” He took hold of Tony’s hand, “It was nice meeting you though,” and would have jogged over to his team if it weren’t for Tony.
“I’m close, baby. Gonna fill you up, alright?” Tony gave a single nod and hugged Steve closer to him, nuzzling his face in Steve’s neck again.
Steve was eagerly waiting on the communal floor, staying just in case Dum-E decided to ‘help’ around, and eyed the flashing numbers that showed the elevator was coming down. He had told Jarvis to get Bruce and Tony down for the surprise and was happy to know that Tony was as excited as he hoped he would be.
“Captain America! Leader of the Avengers!” Clint said in a dramatically deep voice through the stereo. A giggle sounded to his left followed immediately by a shush. “We have a very tiny person in our possession and will only release him if you do as we say!”
“Of course I won’t. I’m going to be in my room and you’ll be jumping on my stomach first thing in the morning,” Steve said and tweaked Tony’s nose. He slid into the bed next to Tony, who eagerly climbed on top of Steve until he was resting comfortably against his chest, “I’ll stay until you fall asleep, okay?”
“You know it’s five in the morning, right?” Steve asked Tony, his voice and expression amused when the little brunette began climbing up his leg.
“I asked Jarvis to alert me when you guys woke up.” Bruce sat down on the nearby chair and Steve sat down on the sofa with Tony in his lap. “Did he eat yet?”
There, Steve was able to make out Clint and a suspicious looking load being carried on his back. He was walking, a little too calmly in Steve’s opinion. Taking the chance, Steve began jumping from branch to branch, landing on each one with barely a rustle.
Tony barely noticed he had his back against the mattress, much too distracted by Steve’s tongue in his mouth, until Steve moved and began kissing down his neck.
Steve—who grew up with his mom, who felt his mother’s love every time she worked late into the night—will never know the grief Tony, a mere four year old, is feeling.
Tony leaned his head back until it rested on the edge of the pool. “I think I’m getting hotter, Cap. Mind helping a guy out?” Tony smirked. He rested one hand on the wall underneath him and the other on Steve’s shoulder.
Suddenly, they felt a rumble and a large burst of lightening struck what felt like inches away from Steve.
“You little brat!” Clint was about to turn around if it weren’t for Natasha’s hand smacking the back of his head.
“But Dum-E is there! I wanna play with him!” Tony pouted and crossed his arms. His little legs began stomping on the carpet and a high pitched noise between a whine and a cry formed.
Getting into the elevator, Steve pressed the button to his floor and bounced Tony gently as a way to keep him awake.
—the coldest area in the whole building—which meant the rest of the building was probably at least five degrees hotter, which also meant that no one was crazy enough to even
Steve should have seen it coming. Of course Jarvis would trigger Tony’s memory—he was his best friend growing up and his father figure after his parents’ death—maybe even before their death. Tony’s eyes became blank again, and Steve watched in frustration when he could do nothing but wait. Bruce came over and observed Tony, making sure he wasn’t showing any signs of distress as he experienced an episode.
“I see Mjolnir fascinates you even at this age.” Thor grinned, placing Mjolnir on the ground so Tony could sate his curiosity.
Nodding his head, Tony brought his robot around and placed it on the floor. The robot, although tiny, was impressively detailed. In fact, it looked a lot like a certain robot in the lab.
Steve turned around, a dejected look on his face, which he quickly wiped away when Fury raised an eyebrow at him.
He spent the next few minutes studying Tony, from his plump pink cheeks, to the small fist clutching at Steve’s index finger—memorizing this moment—because in six hours, this Tony wouldn’t exist anymore.
“Here,” Natasha suddenly said, crouching down to Tony’s height. She wrapped a band around Tony’s wrist and pressed a button, causing a blue, holographic disc to form. “Hold it like this, and toss it,” she said and demonstrated, grabbing the small disc and flinging it like a frisbee to the shooting range. Clint expertly shot an arrow at it, causing the disc to disappear with a little pop.
They were currently in Steve’s room, Tony finally in a diaper and pajamas and no longer covered in slime.
As quiet as possible with his large frame, Steve slowly made his way over and concentrated on the footsteps the entire time. Within a few minutes, Steve could make out Natasha’s red hair between the tightly packed trees and their hanging branches. Quickly, since he knew she could slip between his grasps if given a head start, he emerged from the trees and immediately ducked to dodge her high kick. A session of hand to hand combat later, he finally had her arms behind her back and her body flat on the ground.
Clint quickly handed Steve the toy, his eyebrows furrowing and lips down turning when Tony was still burrowed in Steve’s chest.
“You really do have the most perfect ass,” Steve said entranced as he squeezed said ass between his hands, bringing them together and spreading them out again, forcing the two strings to rub against Tony’s sensitive hole and exposing it to the air over and over.
“Speaking of potion,” Thor reached into his pocket and pulled out the familiar vial, “Fresh batch brewed just this morning.” Thor placed the vial on the counter and the purple liquid emitted a subtitle glow as it sloshed around in its container.
“I’m gonna let Tony hang out with Natasha for a bit. He should interact with more people than just me.” Steve gave a nod of thanks when he was handed a warm cup of hot chocolate.
“The strain on him to physically change from a one year old to a man in his forties is dangerous. By having him age in intervals, there is less chance of potential side effects.”
Tony was fighting the last of the purple slime ball looking monsters that decided to invade New York. His faceplate was long gone, crushed and lost in the five hour battle, and one of his jet thrusters was clogged by slime. He couldn’t respond—his faceplate was gone, therefore the speaker was gone also—but gave a final blast with his repulsor as an answer.
In a few thrusts, Steve slammed his cock as far as it could go and held Tony in that position as he pumped Tony full of his cum.
The team immediately helped lower the suit onto the gravel, being careful of not moving the heavy armor around too much incase they injured what—or whom—they thought was in there.
“I’ll make Tony’s milk. Quite surprising that he hasn’t cried for food yet.” Bruce gave a fond smile at Tony before going to boil some water.
Tony and Pepper dated. Everyone knew that. Then one day they just broke up and Steve remembered that week very clearly. Tony was in his lab more often than not, with the exception of maybe a shower. Steve wasn’t sure if he consumed anything besides coffee and a few granola bars, because when he took down a plate of sandwiches and placed them outside of the locked door, he saw the same plate, sandwiches untouched, in the kitchen later that day.
They were all sitting at the dining table, eating as they listened to Fury’s story of what happened while they were gone.
Tony was about to flip them the finger when he suddenly felt his body tingling and widened his eyes, “Uh oh.”
“No one would be able to take Steve away from you even if they tried.” Natasha nudged his chin up, “Right, Steve?”
I hope this chapter felt lighthearted :) And yes, I realize I have been gone for much longer than I wanted. On the positive side, I am now the owner of a very expensive piece of paper that’s probably going to be in my closet for the rest of my life (no joke, it’s a degree but who cares about that part. Get scholarships, people.)
Tony woke Steve up when light had yet to peek between the curtains, with the toddler siting on his stomach and kneading his face until he jerked awake.
Steve sped to the bathroom, spotting the new additions of bath products and a basket full of soft towels and diapers on the counter. He really had to thank Pepper tomorrow.
Steve pulled the panties up higher, causing Tony’s cock to flatten against his pelvis. Feeling his arms about to buckle, Tony let himself be pushed into the mattress, shoulders flattened as his hands clenched at the pillows next to his head. He spread his legs wider, moaning loudly when Steve slipped in deeper. He felt so
“Jarvis, start a bath for us, please. Not too hot.” Steve asked the AI as he gently laid Tony down next to the basket and stripped him of his makeshift diaper. “You’re such a good boy,” Steve praised when he noticed the lack of a mess in the towel and Tony flashed a toothy smile in return.
That’s probably why he felt weird around her. She hurt Tony once and he didn’t want to see that happen again.
Steve slid his finger in and out, each time inserting it deeper and massaging little circles along the smooth walls.
“It appears that the aliens you fought have returned. They seem to be concentrated within Central Park but are steadily progressing outwards. Director Fury requires all available Avengers to the scene.”
An unstoppable laugh coming from the boy in front of him had Steve stop what he was doing and look down into Tony’s face. His cheeks were red and his face was slightly damp from the melted snow. What had Steve’s heart bursting with joy was the ear-to-ear grin Tony was sporting. What other choice did Steve have but to laugh as well?
When Tony first asked if he could take apart Steve’s alarm clock, Steve didn’t even hesitate to agree, after all, an alarm clock was easily replaceable and Tony was looking so nervous staring up at him with those deer-like eyes and the clock held between his hands. The shock on his face his face when Steve said “Ok” was incredible, eyes opened wider than they’ve ever been, eyebrows raised up to his hairline, and his jaw almost to the floor.
A distraction. That means Nat was close and had just been given enough time to find a safer spot. But who would Tony be with? Natasha, who moved swift and silent and could camouflage herself to near obscurity? Or Clint, who was capable of finding the most creative places to hide and would probably sense him coming a mile away?
Tony’s hair was damp from sweat and his face was red as he took in deep stuttering breaths. Steve looked at him solemnly, wondering what he saw in his nightmare. Sighing, he placed the blanket carefully over Tony and sat at the edge of the bed. He then let one hand rest on Tony’s head and idly stroked his hair.
“You must participate in a game! Catch the child within the hour and we shall eat all of our vegetables!”
Steve placed the plate and yogurt down onto the dining table and took the vial out of Thor’s hand, holding it up to his face to examine the content. “What is it?”
“Why are you just standing there? Tony disappeared!” Clint exclaimed. Steve immediately hushed him and the surrounding members.
“You,” Steve said softly, “Have no idea, do you.” He reached out a large hand, resting it against Tony’s cheek before sliding his thumb across Tony’s bottom lip.
Both Natasha’s and Clint’s amused faces fell—the two meat lovers had a notorious dislike for ‘meat substitutes.’
“You shouldn’t worry, Steve. Although sometimes painful, they’re not causing any damage to him,” Bruce reassured him.
“Let go! Let go! Let go!” The sound of a kick and a grunt came from the emergency stairwell right before the door was pushed open and a little boy came running out.
The sudden stop of Tony’s laugh and his dropped smile would have been comical if it didn’t result in a disaster.
Bruce shook his head, “Not much, I’m afraid. It’s probably going to happen again… and more often as he ages.”
“Nat said I was really good! I want to skate with you now.” Tony said as he tugged Steve’s hand to lead him toward the rink.
Giving Tony a bath wasn’t bad at all, quite the opposite, really. Tony was calm and obedient, silently playing with the rubber duck that was tossed in earlier as Steve sat behind him and carefully washed the suds from his head and body.
“I’m glad to hear that. I’m Aiden, and you are?” The man stuck his hand out with a grin and Steve automatically went for the handshake.
As Tony aged he became much more curious, to say the least. It wasn’t a bad thing, just a little terrifying, Steve thought fondly. And it seemed like the alarm clock was just the catalyst, since Tony didn’t stop there.
Tony looked down at his blanket, contemplating for a moment, before returning his gaze back to Steve. “It was dark and smelly. And my face was really wet. Someone kept yelling, but I didn’t know what they were saying...”
“Maybe I should hold off on that A/C repair?” Tony said jokingly, his fingers playing with the back of Steve’s damp hair.
Sure enough, Clint had both of his arms and Bruce’s full of appliances and gadgets. “You know, you’re supposed to buy gifts for
Or when they were sparring down at the gym and somehow ended up with Steve pinning Tony down, both sweaty from their workout and heaving heavily. Their eyes met and Steve could see Tony’s eyes dilate, could see Tony look down at his lips and lift his head slightly from the mat, their faces inches from each other when Tony suddenly froze and urgently scrambled out from under Steve’s weight.
Natasha and Clint, having returned from their mission for Shield, were making dinner for the team—a recipe inspired by their recent trip to Germany. The sounds of cracks, pounds, and metal against metal made it sound like a small war was happening in the kitchen.
“Let’s make breakfast, Steve!” Tony said before sliding off the bed and running out the bedroom door. Steve could only stare blankly at the indent in the sheets where Tony disappeared from, his mind still not fully awake, before kicking the blanket off his legs and heading out as well.
Bruce was nearby, glancing back and forth between Clint and a few vibrant purple pajama sets. Whichever he chose, Steve was sure Clint would love it.
Ah, yes. Tony loved blueberries, and Steve remembered him making blueberry pancakes every weekend he was free. But… “How do you know how to make pancakes?”
“Can Dum-E come to dinner with us?” Tony asked as Steve wiped off the ink from Tony’s face with a warm washcloth.
Tony moaned, his voice breaking off when Steve gave a particularly wonderful suction. Tony hurriedly let go of Steve’s arm and stuck his hand down the water between them, searching for Steve’s cock.
Steve gripped Tony’s hips and lifted him up an inch before dragging him down. The water around them rippled and splashed against their body.
“Of course you can have ice cream. You just have to eat all of your vegetables as well, alright?” Steve settled Tony up on the back of his neck, chubby legs on each shoulder, as he gripped each foot to make sure Tony was extra secure.
Steve reached the still standing armor first, an anxious expression on him that quickly transformed to confusion when he heard a whimper from within the armor.
He felt the world turn and his breath leave him as his body was yanked down and forced to do a roll. He immediately recognized Natasha’s favorite way of taking someone down—legs wrapped around the neck as she used her momentum to drag the person to the ground.
Tony as a toddler was much more open to affection than when he was an adult, Steve lamented mentally as he stared into those big dear-like eyes. While Tony was friendly to everyone, willing to give a helping hand when unasked, when they try to help Tony, however, said man would shield himself from them, preventing himself from forming a relationship that could be described as more than just “Team Members.”
Shuffling up onto his hands and knees, Tony could hear the moment Steve saw what the underwear was truly hiding. Or in this case,
“Tony!” Steve cried out. “Tony!” He checked the living room, under the couches, even—terrified of what he might find—out of the windows. He could hear the rest of the team searching for Tony, just as frantic as he was, but he couldn’t register the noise.
Anything with wiring, Tony would strip them down—laptops, toasters, remotes, even Steve’s communication ear piece—breaking them down to their basic components, study them, and rebuild them back all over again. It reminded Steve so much of Tony as an adult when he saw those dexterous hands moving like lightning—trying to keep up with the pace his thoughts were going—that it made his heart pang a little within his chest.
Steve lightly tapped the top of Tony’s head, getting him to look up at him, “Did you finish your medicine?”
“Of course it is. I saw him chowing down on milk and cookies ten minutes ago,” Clint said, causing Natasha to roll her eyes.
“Perfect. Your ass bouncing every time I fuck you, your hole stretching around me, like you don’t want my cock to leave,” Steve growled out, hands kneading Tony’s ass. “Love this view, you’re so beautiful.”
Tony felt the bed move, accommodating Steve’s weight as he climbed onto it while their tongues mingled without a break. Hands ran down his sides and up his back before reaching down and grabbing his ass.
“Heya, kiddo. Whatcha got there?” Steve asked when he noticed Tony holding something behind his back.
“Because you’re getting bigger, so you need your own room.” Steve took the empty cup after Tony finished and placed it on the nightstand next to the mini Dum-E. He then pulled up the blanket and tucked Tony in alongside his Captain America plushie.
“That’s ok. I’ll help you!” Tony grinned up at Steve as they walked to the rink. Steve grinned back and tightened his grip of Tony’s hand.
“Afternoon, Captain.” Thor greeted. His eyes lit up when he saw the plate of fruits and walked closer to Steve, a hand already reaching out to grab a piece.
“Fuck.” The curse surprised Tony. Steve rarely cussed, only saying those words when he was deeply affected.
Instead of returning his mouth to Tony’s body, Steve remained on his knees, staring at Tony’s crotch.
Steve was nearly there, just thirty feet left. Oh look, Tony was already greeting him with a victory smile.
Tony avoided his eyes, choosing instead to look at his hands, but still nodded, “Okay.” Bruce let out an almost inaudible sigh and patted Tony’s head softly before heading to the kitchen.
“Pardon me,” the man laughed, “I just saw you staring at the ties and thought it might be for a husband, seeing that you had a child with you.”
Steve blinked at her, feeling like a deer caught in the headlights, “Oh, alright. Thanks for stopping by.”
“Hey, you alright?” Tony didn’t look like he was in pain, and he also didn’t look like he was having a memory relapse, so Steve lightly shook the foot hanging at his waist.
“Oh, sure,” Steve said and handed over the camera. Bruce looked at the various buttons a bit confused but once Steve explained which button did what, Bruce got the hang of it.
Steve maneuvered Tony until he was lying in the center of the king-sized between two fluffy pillows, “You comfortable, buddy?” As a response, Tony’s eyes fluttered shut. Steve smiled, his eyes soft with affection, and reached a hand out to push the freshly dried hair out of Tony’s face.
Tony began moving his hips when he felt Steve’s pelvis meet his ass, desperate to grind on that cock and get it a few millimeters deeper.
Steve wiped away the remaining tears from Tony’s red cheeks with his thumb and made his way to the bedroom.
Steve, on the other hand, had his attention caught by some silk ties on display. He had already gotten gifts for everyone—everyone but Tony, that is. What do you get for a man who literally could buy anything he wanted? Maybe the ties were too selfish. Just because Steve thought Tony pulled off the business suit look better than anyone else didn’t mean Tony wanted more ties to his undoubtably large collection.
“Captain, it would be best if Shield takes him to find out a way to cure him of,” Fury gestured at the curiously blinking toddler, “… This.”
The elevator door closed shut behind the team as they arrived at the communal floor in the tower. The large area was tastefully decorated: floor-to-ceiling windows acting as walls showed off the beautiful night view of the city, the walls were painted a dark grey, contrasting against the light wooden floor, and in the center of the room was a modern fireplace. To the left of was a matching kitchen, its island counter overflowing with pastel giftwrapped boxes and bags along with containers of the team’s usual takeout.
Steve stood still and tried to focus on any unusual noise. The fake bird and children noises were a bit distracting, but with enough concentration Steve was able to make out soft footsteps, barely audible if it weren’t for his super hearing, one hundred feet to his two o’clock.
“Tony, I told you. You can’t go into the lab. It’s too dangerous,” Steve said for what felt like the millionth time. A tight frown was on his face as he attempted to deal with Tony at eight in the morning.
“O-oh, f-fuck,” Tony stuttered, fists clenching against the sheets. He opened his eyes—not even sure of when he closed them—and saw his cock, creating a large tent as it strained against the panties. The small damp spot was steadily growing larger as Steve rocked back and forth.
Steve had just finished arranging everything on a tray and was about to bring it out when Pepper stepped into the kitchen, a smile bright on her face.
“Okay,” Steve said and turned away to face her, “I’ll just get Tony washed up.” Natasha was looking at him, her eyes slightly squinted with what he could only describe as amusement. “What?” Steve asked, feeling a bit unnerved.
“Alright, kiddo. Stop what you’re doing and put your coat on,” Steve said as Tony was in the middle of prying open a phone.
“Alright. I’m going.” Steve stepped backwards a few feet, watching the door to see if Tony would unlock it. When he was met with silence, he sighed and went to clean up the mess of eggs.
Dum-E’s three-pronged head moved down until was at Tony’s eye-level, tilting left and right as if it wondered why its creator was so small.
Steve could hear the awed gasp from the boy as he took in Shield’s lab and all of their fancy and confounding equipments.
Steve walked over to the kitchen area, eying the large mess of bowls and egg shells spread across the counter and haphazardly spilling into the sink. For two spies who were all about doing things quick and clean, the place was a mess—although he had to admit there was an enticing aroma coming from the oven.
After changing into sweatpants and a t-shirt, Steve padded to his bedroom with Tony cradled in his arms. Even though he could feel Tony’s head become heavy on his shoulder, he walked around the room anyways—gently patting Tony’s back in a rhythm reminiscent of his mother’s when he was a child.
“Steve, the stove is whistling.” Steve felt a tug on his pants and looked down. He saw Tony staring up at him, his hair a mess and eyes slightly bleary from his nap.
“Steve!” He heard Tony’s voice, and just a second later, Tony squeezed himself through a couple pairs of legs before crawling out with a controller clutched between his hands while Josh had to shove himself through his coworkers to catch up with Tony.
“Mm,” Tony frowned down at his crotch, “As hot as it was earlier, I’m starting to feel really sticky and gross.”
Steve’s face was flushed a healthy pink, his biceps bulging as he lifted and slammed Tony up and down his cock in an superhuman speed—finding that this way was easier than holding Tony against the wall.
“Y-yes, sir.” The scientist then turned to Tony, “Come along Mr. Sta—I mean, Tony. Let’s get you a lab coat and some goggles.”
As he lifted up the last shirt in his luggage, he noticed a black box with a pink ribbon tied on top and furrowed his eyebrows. What? He didn’t remember—oh.
“I found a train and used the spring in the toaster. And the wires are from the laptop...” Tony excitedly said before quietly trailing off. “Are you mad?”
If he could, Steve would find those people and have them face him, because no punishment in hell could compare to his.
“Whichever way seems easier to you.” Bruce shrugged, “But probably as Tony is sleeping, since the change will take about six hours.”
Clouds immediately began gathering. Steve could feel the static in the air as flashes of lightening lit up the sky every few seconds. Thor flew up, only to fly down again, this time slamming Mjolnir to the ground. Every alien within a forty feet radius of Thor was struck by lightening, and purple slime scattered into the air.
As they sat around the dining table, plates full of beef covered in gravy, noodles, and roasted vegetable, Steve couldn’t help the warm feeling that was radiating throughout his body. Natasha and Clint were telling the group about their mission and having a silly argument—something about how Natasha wouldn’t have had to blow up a car if Clint ran faster—with Bruce injecting sarcastic and witty comments in-between. Tony was teasing Dum-E with a carrot stabbed on his fork, only to chew on it moments later when the robot reached out to get it.
“He’s right, Tony. How you managed to pack so much power in something that size is extremely impressive. Is the laser a one time use?” Bruce asked as he walked towards the hovering bee drone, curiosity clear in his expression.
“Um, Captain. There are dangerous things around and—um—well... he’s a bit,” The skittish scientist muttered, and gestured, “bouncy.”
“I’m not letting you take Tony.” In his arms was said toddler, face still sticky from the slime even though Steve cleaned him up as best as he could with a wet cloth. Tony was wrapped up in a white towel, his legs fidgeting and arms stuck out from a tiny gap.
“Well, that was fun.” Steve said, a megawatt smile on his face as he kissed the knees next to his head.
“If you wanted the pool to us again, you don’t have to do that. The guys are probably scarred for life.” Steve smirked down at him.
“Dum-E!” Steve shouted. “I need your help!” He listened carefully, and smiled when he heard the sound of motors and wheels slowly getting closer.
“Doctor Banner showed me the results of his tests, and out of all the potions on Asgard, I found this to be the most suitable cure.”
With seven minutes left, it was barely enough time to fight off both of them and get Tony as well. But Steve, being who he was, was always up for a challenge.
As they waited inside Shield’s elevator, Steve’s keen eye caught the sight of a small lump hidden by some fabric. “Tony, what’s in your pocket?”
Steve walked over to Tony, Natasha, and Clint, and was immediately attacked by the little boy trying to use him as a tree.
Tony looked up and beamed a grin at Steve before getting up. “Steve, Steve! I drew Dum-E! Look!” Tony proudly held up the sketchbook where a drawing of Dum-E was holding a ball, Steve was holding onto Tony’s hand, and Bruce was sleeping on the couch.
“I t-thought…” Tony mumbled something, and even with Steve’s enhanced hearing he couldn’t make it out.
“Oh, Tony. I’m sorry,” Steve said and wiped his tears again. He waited until Tony’s sobbing died down before catching his eyes, “I would never leave you. I had to go to work.”
“Clint, do you think it’s safe to be showing Tony that?” Steve asked exasperatedly. Everyone, minus Bruce, was currently in the gym. Heroes had to keep their bodies in tip top conditions after all, and Steve hadn’t had much time to work off his excess energy since Tony’s deaging.
Tony’s eyes dilated as Steve began kissing down his torso, following each kiss with a little lick. When he reached the edge of the panties, Steve looked up and winked.
A tiny bee-like drone was zipping back and forth from one side of a ‘stage’ to the other. What looked like a pen in the hands of a scientist shot out a quick burst of laser, instantly melting a six-inch hole in a sheet of steel twenty feet in front of it. Monitors with displays of complicated graphs and numbers were placed all over the room, each one continually changing as more information was added and taken away.
“Oh, okay then.” Tony blinked and made a face that screamed ‘how strange’, but dismissed the suspicion and became excited at the idea of ice skating. “Let’s go! Let’s go!”
“Just go fight those damn things before I have to stay here any longer,” Fury said as he walked over to the couch, sat down, and grabbed a folded up newspaper.
Tony made a whining noise when his legs kept slipping off of Steve’s shin and raised his arms out to Steve, “Steeb! Steeb!”
Steve pulled Tony into his arms, wrapped him tight within them like a security blanket, and let the little boy cry.
“My head hurts again,” Tony said, his voice raspy and weak, as he reached up to hold his fingers to his temple. Steve gently picked Tony up and walked across the room, heading towards the elevator.
“Anything for you,” Steve said, planting a kiss on one of Tony’s asscheeks, before straightening himself up on his knees.
“Thanks, Nat.” Steve sheepishly smiled at her. What idiots they were, the tower didn’t have anything fit to take care of a kid, much less a one year old.
“Understandable, considering we don’t even know where those things even came from.” Steve dejectedly nodded. “What do we do?” Steve whispered, “Tony can’t be like this forever.”
“Just a little longer,” Bruce said as he carefully removed the needle from Tony’s arm. He quickly placed gauze and a bandage over the small wound. “Done!” He yelled out in elated exasperation.
Wandering around, ten minutes had passed before Steve saw little footprints imprinted in the grass. Steve couldn’t help but smile. Clint and Nat were too well trained to be leaving marks like these, but Tony obviously wasn’t. Following the little trail, which had disappeared in front of a tree, Steve bent as low as he could before jumping up and grabbing a sturdy branch. Hauling himself up and steadying himself, Steve was able to get a wide view of the surrounding area.
Tony took longer to come back compared to before, almost unmoving for two minutes, but when he did he was all smiles.
Clint, finally having someone ‘fun’ to show off to, decided that Tony needed to see him shoot at targets.
Steve lifted Tony into his arms, “Time to get you cleaned up.” Tony whined and tugged the back of Steve’s sticky hair, “I know, buddy. I need to bathe too.”
“Would you believe me if I said I was feeling hot and wanted to get wet?” A hand slid its way up Tony’s thigh and stopped at the band of his boxers. Steve’s thumb flicked up and down, stroking skin, then fabric, then skin again.
Steve, who was holding on to Tony’s arm so Bruce could take blood, rapidly let go of the limb and lifted the red-faced toddler up, “I know. I know. I’m sorry.” He patted Tony’s back, his frown deepening when he saw how hard Tony was crying. The little body was shaking and, combined with the painful cries, caused his guilt to grow larger.
“I called Pepper and told her what happened.” Natasha said when she saw the three men’s surprised face. “She’s in Malibu right now but said she’ll come back as soon as possible.”
Tony’s toes clenched at every inch Steve’s fingers slid in. The stretch made him want to grind down on the finger, force it against the spot Steve always made sure to abuse. But it also made him want to cry out in frustration, because he knew that a finger wouldn’t be enough. Not nearly enough.
Tony wasn’t a very good liar as a child, Steve thought, as Tony shuffled his feet and shoved his hand inside his pocket. “Nothing...”
“Great timing, Thor. We need to keep the perimeter secured. There are more of these things than you think,” Steve said, putting emphasis on what ‘secured’ meant by tossing his shield through two more aliens.
“It’s uh... For you.” Bruce said when none of them responded, “It’s a vitamin to help boost your growth...” Bruce gave a subtle shrug with wide eyes when he met his teammates’ eyes.
“Do you think Tony took over r&d yet?” Clint joked, stretching his arms above his head as they walked down the hall.
“Tony?” Steve knocked on the door. His uniform was on, and the shield was against his back, but he couldn’t help but feel like he was going into battle with a heavy heart. “I have to go to work for a bit. Nick is going to take care of you while I’m gone, alright?”
“… Just admiring what a great artist you are, Tony.” Bruce said as he ruffled Tony’s hair. “Now, do you want to do anything today?”
“I know,” Steve pinched Tony’s chubby cheek and ruffled his fluffy hair. He then turned to Josh, who was looking more star struck than before, “If you need him out of your hair just call me and I’ll come.”
He predicted a slime splash back, he did just blast the thing, but he didn’t expect it to fucking land in his mouth. Tony reeled back with a grimace and shout. That was a weird taste that he didn’t want to experience ever again.
Thor placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder and gave it a firm grip, “I will bring the next vial in three days. Enjoy your time with him.”
“Ice skating it is. Let’s get you changed and we can go.” Steve stood up and Tony followed right along.
Tony was silent, causing Steve to turn his attention away from the pan to look at him. Tony’s head was tilted down, hiding his face in Steve’s shoulder.
Sliding one hand up from Tony’s thigh to his asscheek, Steve gave a squeeze and then slipped a finger between the cheeks.
“How’s it going in here, guys? Need any help?” Steve asked as he watched Clint push yellow dough through a colander and into a pot of boiling broth.
The group walked off to the side and watched as Tony sat in Santa’s lap, whispered in the jolly man’s ear, and looked back over to them.
After being fed lunch and bathed, Tony was taking a nap in Steve’s bed. It was only noon and Steve was sitting on his couch, keeping one ear open incase Tony woke up while reading the newspaper—although the reading part was more like staring at the black fonts while his mind was occupied.
“I got you apple juice and a pb&j,” Steve said with a smile and sat down next to Tony. “How was talking with Pepper?”
Clint walked in at that moment, coming to a stop when he saw them. He looked down at Tony asleep against Steve, and then at their faces. “Uhh, what just happened?”
“Yeah, little man! I’ve never seen anything so tiny with lasers before,” Clint said eagerly, and Steve couldn’t help but be grateful when the smile came back on Tony’s face.
Throughout the afternoon, Tony played with Dum-E and Steve. Bruce, who was content with lounging on the couch and watching, fell asleep after watching Tony play fetch for twenty minutes. The tricks Tony got the robot to do was quite impressive, as if Dum-E had been built to be more entertaining than useful. When Steve remembered that Tony built the robot in his father’s workshop as a teenager, he couldn’t help but think that there might be more truth to that thought than he hoped.
“It’s wonderful! I love it!” Steve was slightly knocked off balance by Tony’s hug but quickly redeemed himself. Steve smiled and hugged Tony back.
“Yes! I did!” Thor exclaimed and marched across the room, stopping once he was a foot away from Clint and crouched down, tilting his body to the side so he could see the little boy and his wide, curious eyes, “I must say, you are quite adorable as a child.”
“I’m all ready for you,” Tony said, clenching around the thumb’s tip. “You always said my ass was perfect for panties, now you don’t even have to take them off to fuck me.”
“Tony? Tony, what happened?” Steve got off the couch and kneeled in front of Tony, trying to peer up at the face hidden beneath dark hair. Steve reached a hand out to cupped Tony’s cheek and immediately felt hot tears against his palm.
Steve frowned. He couldn’t just leave Tony alone, but those aliens were attacking civilians, “Who’s the closest person around that’s not an Avenger?”
“Shield wanted to keep him for observation.” Steve could see the frowns they each had between their brows tightened. “But I said no. We’re going to be taking care of him.” The tension immediately flew from their faces.
The elevator slid open, “What’s with the crying? I could hear it all the way downstairs.” Clint and Natasha walked into the living room, both with concerned looks on their faces. They looked like they just hopped out of bed, in a rush to hurry to Tony.
Breakfast was at the communal floor today since the only things in Steve’s refrigerator were orange juice and an egg.
Outside, in all of his wet, muscled glory, was the one and only Steve Rogers swimming freestyle in the pool. Tony could see his back and arm muscles rippling with each stroke, and his eyes darkened while his curiosity faded.
Steve grinned and held out his hand, pulling his team mate up when it was accepted. “That, you did.”
The city was looking gross. Well, this part of it was anyways. It looked like Godzilla caught a cold and used the streets and buildings as his tissue. Everything was gooey and oozing and the Avengers were probably going to go through three bottles of shampoo each just to get this stuff out of their hair.
Tony’s hips were still jerking, trying to find release from the cock still inside him. Steve pulled out, much to Tony’s protest. He carried Tony to the more shallow part of the pool until he could lift Tony out of the water and lay the upper half of his body on the wet pool deck. Steve kneeled in the water with Tony’s legs around his shoulders.
In his mind Steve could see Tony before his surgery—the one that removed the arc reactor from his chest—and imagined the horror he must have felt when he woke up and realized a foreign object was inserted inside his body, exposed where anyone could reach in and yank it. Fear. Confusion. Anger. He could imagine the panicking breaths that assaulted him, worsening when he could feel his skin and muscles contract against the thing that was keeping him alive. The wires hanging from his chest like visible nerves.
Tony couldn’t do anything but moan and twitch and dig his fingers into Steve’s upper back, knowing that the red marks he leaves would fade in the following hours. He squeezed his eyes shut and buried his face deep in Steve’s nape.
In his mind, Steve promised himself that he would fulfill every childhood wish Tony ever had, and if it started with Father Christmas himself, then so be it.
“No worries,” Aiden said, “I’m sorry if I’m being bold, but would you like to grab some coffee one day?” Aiden gave a smile, this time small and—to Steve’s surprise—flirty.
Steve put the kettle on the stove to boil while he rummaged around for the container of tea he got for rare occasions like this. Finding it, he prepared two cups before leaning against the counter and waited for the water to boil.
Steve’s eyes snapped opened. He looked around the room alert and confused before focusing on the source of the voice. Tony was in the outfit Steve dressed him in yesterday night, no longer drowning in the fabric but filling it out perfectly. He sat on the bed grinning, his black hair poking out in ten different directions, and the epitome of a cheerful four year old.
Finally, one of the boxes split apart and the Avengers’ Plush Toys rained on the floor like an answer to their prayers.
A shocked gasp left Tony and his eyes widened, “A robot!” He quickly left Steve and ran to Dum-E, which had begun chirping as it met its creator.
Steve knew all of this, and that was why he hoped that when Tony aged back, which would be soon, Tony would see that the Avengers wanted him around as much as he wanted them.
’ went through his mind. He had only tried it once, the day it arrived, and felt so embarrassed he hid it deep within his luggage since that was one of the few things they didn’t share.
Steve lifted the tray and walked to the living room. He saw Tony sitting on the couch and placed the tray on the coffee table.
Hello, my dear readers! Sorry I haven't updated in weeks, let's just say I've spent more time in the library these past two weeks than I have in the past four years of college combined.
Tony’s eyebrows lifted a bit in surprise as he used the bottom of his old band t-shirt to wipe the sweat off his face. “Already? Where is everyone?”
“Fine! I agree!” Steve shouted and immediately turned his attention to the left where he previously heard Tony giggle.
Tony let out happy giggles and reached an arm out to grab Clint’s twitching nose. The sound of his laughter rang throughout the fifty-sixth floor and all four of them were enamored by the cute toothy grin.
“No, it’s actually able to recharge with...” Steve didn’t hear the rest of Tony’s sentence as the Avengers went to examine the drone while he went to the skittish scientist.
“Aw, okay,” Tony pouted and placed the sketchbook down on the coffee table. He then grabbed Steve’s hand and led him to the bathroom.
Tony immediately knew what to do. With a giant grin, he tossed the ball away from him, “Fetch, Dum-E!”
“I arrived just a moment ago. I thought why not enjoy a day with my friends,” Thor said before clapping a large hand on Bruce’s shoulder, making him choke on his coffee.
For their third wedding anniversary, Tony had the fabulous idea of Steve and him on a wonderful little island, surrounded by crystal clear blue ocean, gentle waves, kind and peaceful people who had no idea who Steve and Tony were, and a generous amount of delicious food.
Josh stared for a moment before eagerly grabbing Steve’s hand, jostling the arm up and down in an eager shake, “A-anytime, Captain!”
He lifted the blanket and slid in to the right side of the bed, careful to not jostle Tony. Tomorrow, they’ll figure how to get Tony back to normal. But for now, sleep.
The toddler’s sobbing slowed down to a sniffle as he was cradled in Captain America’s arms. His scrunched up face relaxed and his eyes opened, revealing large brown eyes framed by wet eyelashes.
While hiding the box kept it out of sight, its presence was always in the back of Tony’s head. Tony and Steve had spent the first three days swimming, tanning, eating, and exploring. They found a waterfall, swam with turtles, went zip lining, and even did a couple’s bungee jump because Steve gave him puppy eyes. He enjoyed it though, mostly because of Steve’s muscular arms wrapping tight around him and nowhere felt as safe as within Captain America’s arms. Every once in a while, when Steve would say something that Tony would call cheesy but not so secretly loved, or when Steve would give him that look before kissing him, Tony had the urge to do something
Tony tossed the empty bottle, letting it bounce off the couch and fall to the rug, and crawled onto Steve’s lap. His forehead leaned against Steve’s chest and eyelashes fluttered as he struggled to stay awake.
“Well, Raven is in custody, so there aren’t any urgent matters to attend to, besides ordering better food. And new furniture for the living room.”Coulson responded.  At that, Tony made a hacking sound, and Coulson’s face flashed with a brief grimace before settling back into unsettling neutrality. “Sorry, Tony. I was busy when he woke up, and I didn’t get to him before he got to the couch. It’s only cosmetic, no walls or windows or doors-”
“My implants. Son of a bitch, he fried my implants.” Clint sat up and thumped the side of his head with his back foot. Steve frowned curiously.
“Anyways. Peter, let’s recap what we’ve already been over. You might want to take a seat, by the way.” Peter did, and Coulson folded his hands neatly in front of him, probably to watch the kid get increasingly uncomfortable the longer they sat and looked at each other. “So you know that these cats used to be human. And you know Tony-” Coulson bopped Tony on the head, then proceeded to do so to the other cats as he went down the line, “-and this is Bruce, Natasha, Clint, and Thor. The other cat that left is Steve.”
“Well, you’re not wrong. The main point of the mission is to train this guy.” He directed his laser-pointer to Tony, who leaned back a little in surprise.
“We were just heading down to interrogate Loki, if you wanted to come.” Peter asked, a little shy as he hid behind the phone, with Coulson still on the line.
.” Tony said, growing desperate and starting to fear the worst. What if Peter had been hurt? What if he was lying in a ditch, or worse? What if he’d been killed?
“It’s just a regular collar. What’s so special about it?” He poked it, and nothing spectacular happened. Thor just chuckled and gestured for Tony to lower his head.
“Fury is on the line, Cap.” She handed it over and Steve left the room to talk while Bruce and Clint tried to get Tony up onto his feet.
“You’re in New York, Tones, you’re at the mansion. Do you remember? It’s November and you’re safe, you’re alright, Steve is the one who’s got you. Remember Steve?” Rhodey said, gentler this time. Tony drew in another shaky breath and tried to think. Afghanistan… was a while ago. He came back and had cheeseburgers, and sat on the floor while he had his press conference.
They all sat down in their usual spots and the meeting went relatively smooth, minus the occasional bark from Tony that they had to try and interpret as best they could. They all walked away slightly irritated as per the usual.
Tony’s throat tight and he sent up a silent thank you when JARVIS jumped in to answer so that he wouldn’t have to.
Tony finally reached a wall and he wanted to scream again, wanted to tear it down and just run, run-
“Look at me! Pet me, please!” Steve called, backing up a bit and sitting down while May bent and petted the top of his head. Tony snickered to himself and started typing while she cooed at Steve and asked him a few questions in baby-talk.
It was about as boring as Tony had expected. He couldn’t add any input besides nodding his head or shaking it, and he couldn’t even explain to them what had actually happened.
Tony hopped off the bed, peeking his head into the hallway to make sure Peter was still busy before he leapt up onto the desk. The laptop had been left open, thank God. He went to move the cursor and grunted in frustration when the trackpad barely registered his paw. This would take a while, and he didn’t have much time. He dragged the cursor down to the Skype icon, and started the painstaking process of typing in Pepper’s screen name. He found it at the same time as the faucet turned off, and he pecked out a message as fast as he could.
“Cap, this is bad. He could be anywhere! He could be hurt, or lost, or lying broken in a ditch where no one will find him until it’s too late and he’s-”
“See? There. No harm, no foul.” The kid practically hopped to his desk, plopping down in the chair and lifting the screen to his laptop. “Let’s see…” He swiveled and scooted forwards in his chair, rolling Tony onto his back. The cat barely had time to register what had happened before he was released and the kid went back to his computer. “Okay, male… what breed are you?” He looked over at Tony for a few seconds before he minimized Photoshop and pulled up a chrome window, oblivious to the cat’s mortification. This guy just casually checked out my junk. Tony felt a little insulted, and very violated. He gave his chest fur a few quick licks and perched himself on the highest mound of blanket.
“Bring water?” Steve guessed, repeating the scoop-and-dip motions. They were separate signs, the scoop meaning ‘bring’ and the head-dip to indicate a drink. In the case of them being cats, it was water by default.
“Back away from the door, Sir.” She shouted, backing up a few steps. The beam was propped high up on the door and her foot connected next to the handle with no problem, busting the door in and off the hinges. Five pairs of eyes blinked at them and Tony went in, sniffing all of them for blood. They all seemed alright, two men and three kids that had been trapped in their apartment before they could evacuate.
Tony started to fake-gag, and Steve gave him a hearty thump on the back, smirking all cheeky-like when Tony gave him a half-hearted glare.
At first they had been irritated, but Tony’d thought it settled down and they got over it. Turns out that the old Stark-charm hadn’t won them over.
“You’re sure that you can’t speak to dogs? What the hell does he want?” Steve asked, subtly shuffling his feet and setting his jaw. The Jaw was never a good sign.
“Can we trust you?” Thor asked, crossing his arms and staring Tony down. It was uncomfortable, but Tony’s conscience was clear. He nodded vigorously and spun around again, trying to convey the urgency of the situation.
Steve stood and stared at the bag for a few moments before he went at it again, twice as violent as before.
They all pushed up as hard as they could, collectively wheezing with effort while Thor gently pulled May clear by the back of her shirt. He yowled to tell them they were safe, and the group crawled back out, Steve with his shoulder propping it up until the last cat was clear.
“Actually, I do need your help.” Loki’s face was amused, and Tony could swear the demi-god was fighting back a grin. And what the hell could Tony do for
I'M SO SORRY, GUYS! After this story and onwards, I'm going to finish my work before I start posting, so that I can update consistently and without such big gaps. Because I SUCK at writing, and I can't force myself to do it. So I'm sorry again for the big gap, and I promise I'm slowly but surely getting through this. The chapters are all going to be different lengths, and I'll try to make the next one much longer.
After a week or two of normal life, however, there was a small hiccup in the routine. Tony awoke on a thursday night- or was it early morning?- to see Natasha sitting at the table, nursing a cup of coffee. She wasn’t normally up so late- at least not in the commons area. Her crutches leaned against the table next to her.
Tony was still exhausted when he got off the quinjet and shuffled his way to Fury’s office, half-heartedly scratching at the door in lieu of knocking.
The front door didn’t budge when Tony reached it, but he wasn’t surprised. He started to bark instead, hopping up on his hind legs to get JARVIS’s attention.
“France, as it turns out, is just as weird as Italy.” He said, laying down with contentment as Clint rubbed his belly.
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I swear to you that I didn’t know, I would never have made you do that. I’m sorry.” Steve dropped his hands into his lap and he looked so sad. Instead of his usual kicked-puppy look, he had an expression akin to someone who had done the kicking on accident and consequently regretted their existence. Tony hated seeing that look on his face.
“Tony, I don’t think this is a good idea.” Natasha spoke up, lifting her chin when he spun and glowered. “There’s nothing we can do.”
“Uh, hel- hi. He’s yours? The Avengers have a dog? Is this top secret?” Spider-Man peered around Thor’s back, and Natasha chuckled.
Tony thrashed against the person holding him in the water and he tried to scream but it was a more abrasive noise than he’d intended and he startled himself, whipping his head back when he got water up his nose from the struggling and he was scared-
“Get your ass back to the jet, they’ve got what they need.” He said shortly, and Tony didn’t look forward to getting his behind chewed out by an angry Rumlow.
allowed on the tables. Please keep them under control or we’ll have to ask you to leave.” Coulson assured him that there wouldn’t be any trouble, and then gave each cat a small reprimanding tap on the nose with his finger.
“Hey, Brucie-bear. How ya’ been?” Tony said tiredly, letting himself be examined and rolled over until Bruce found where he was bleeding.
TW for being afraid of the dark. Just in case? Tony's PTSD is kinda triggered by the dark, which happens a couple times this chapter, so tread lightly if you are also triggered by that. Ciao!
“Everything is good. Coyote is green, open the doors.” He called, and the quinjet doors dropped with a soft hiss.
Tony was simmering in frustration. He tried sprinting for a block or two but nothing helped; maybe he could find a way to burn energy on his way to the mansion. Maybe Tony could work on his agility? He had to get used to his new body, in case worst came to worst.
a dog right now, Banner. Could you go clean up the kitchen? Clint will get the foyer, while Natasha and I get this room…” His voice faded out as Natasha continued down the hall, going into Tony’s room and opening the bathroom door.
“Hello, dog.” Thor bent down, setting his hammer on the sidewalk as he brought himself down to eye-level. Tony was suddenly hit with a wave of respect; Thor was the most kind-hearted and courteous out of them all, so much so that he was treating a dog just like he would a human, and Tony was so grateful for it that he wanted to cry.
, just because he wanted to stay on the couch?” Pepper’s face was flushed angrily, and Tony’s nerves shot up at the confrontation.
Tony stepped out of the shower feeling a bit better, and got dressed in a band t-shirt and jeans, planning on getting out of the house to clear his head. Dummy
She obviously cared more about killing Loki than fending off Tony, and made to finish the trickster off before he could scramble up and leap back into the fray. He did just that, once again flipping them and sending her skidding across the room. Tony crouched over Loki and hissed in defiance.
“Well, it’s pretty easy to give a dog medicine. Just tuck it into a piece of food, like a small bite of hot dog or other meat. They can hardly ever tell that it’s in there, and if he can, try different foods until it works.” Hannah said, handing Steve the pills and giving Tony one final scratch behind the ears. “I own a clinic down in Manhattan, so here’s my card if you need to contact me for anything.” Hannah said, handing Steve a business card before she gave them a final smile and left.
“I’m sorry we kept you inside. That was a bit thoughtless on our part.” Tony blinked at Steve and then have his tail a few happy thumps, hopefully conveying that the apology was accepted. Steve gave him a small smile and stood up, picking up Tony’s leash as he gestured for him to get up.
“Well, looks like you’ve weaseled out of it for now. Let’s go see what this alert is about.” Bruce leads Tony to the living room where they switch on the TV to a local news channel.
After a minute or so, Tony finally located the source of his wakefulness- someone was moving around near the front door. The feet were landing too heavily to be Natasha’s, but were too quiet to be Bruce or Steve. Thor’s snoring could be heard faintly from down the hall and he would likely end up waking the entire mansion if he got up at this hour. That left Clint.
Tony thought. Sure, being weirded out by spiders was relatively normal. But seeing the ‘tesseract’, and feeling creeped out by the place? That’s not something easily marked off and tossed away as quirky, as irrelevant. As being spooked.
“Why is your tail twisted in such a knot? Did you think I was gonna finish him off? I was just making sure he’s still alive. I’m not going to hurt him when he’s unconscious, that just takes all the fun out of things.” Clint scoffed, gently rolling the cat over and checking to make sure he was alright. Tony felt suddenly adrift, not sure what to do. Of course Clint wouldn’t do that.
Tony snarled, body tensed to leap. It wasn’t rational, or even remotely smart, but he was so incredibly
“What do you take me for, Phil? Have you gotten into Stark’s scotch?” He sounded pissed. Steve meowed, and patted at Phil’s leg with his claws sheathed. Phil sat down on the ground and let Steve clamber up into his lap, without even batting an eye as the soldier meowed into the phone. Fury spluttered and they could hear the scraping of chair legs against the ground. “Coulson, what the hell-” He started, but Steve meowed again. There was an agitated sigh, before Fury tried again. “Which one is that?”
Tony took a step or two forward and paused again. The entire thing was giving him the heebie-jeebies; the only noise was his breathing and his nails clicking on the wood, and the tesseract was resting by itself on the end of an abandoned wall of scaffolding, in a silent church in a dead town in the hills of southern Italy. Something was wrong and Tony could feel it crawling up and down his spine like cold skeleton hands, fingers dragging through his fur and making him shiver.
Tony had made an impressive furrow in the stick by the time he heard a truck pulling into the driveway. It sounded heavy and it wheezed, so it was either a service truck or a really old pickup. And neither were allowed past the gates without Tony’s approval.
“Hi again. You just get into all sorts of trouble, huh?” Spider-Man said as he hurried back, crouching down to rub his hand across Tony’s side. “You okay bud?”
“I have a plan B.” Tony said, making eye contact with Steve. If he could raise an eyebrow, he looked like he’d have one in his hairline. As it was, his gaze said,
“It’ll be quick, I’ll just run some hot water to melt off the snow and we’ll do shampoo to get the dirt out of your fur. Fast and easy.” Steve said, turning on the tap and putting the lever on hot while Tony bit back several insults about Steve being
“We all barely recognized one another after Loki cast his spell, and there is no way for me to be certain of her without seeing her normal form. We must wait until they wake up.” Thor said, standing up and padding off after Coulson as they took Loki back to the containment floor.
of quinjet propellers nearby, the smell of gasoline and oil strong in the breeze passing by in front of the entrance to the alley.
“Look, kid, you’re welcome to have a spot on the team. We could use your... talents, per se, in this line of work. If not, though- you’re still not allowed to breathe a word to anyone of anything that happens here. Capisce?” He said, voice gruff as always, but with a lighter tone.
“Guys, I have a plan. Cap and Widow, you keep eliminating the strays. Thor, buddy, I’m gonna need your help. I’ll lure them to the water, and you deep fry them to the American standard of perfection.” Thor copied enthusiastically, flying past Tony to meet him at the bay, while Steve started to 'Hen', as they called it.
“Sure, sure. As long as you sign some kind of NDA by the time you leave, I’m happy.” Fury said, leaning comfortably back into his chair.
“Well what the fuck is his problem, then?” Clint burst out, gesturing widely with both arms. “He’s usually an ass, but he’s really outdone himself these past few days. Nothing drastic has happened, nobody has hurt him or anything. Why the hell is it our fault that he hurt Natasha?” Clint was pissed, and he strode across the kitchen to start another batch of coffee. Tony saw Pepper’s nostrils flare and he flinched, preparing himself for the shouting. Instead she smoothed a hand down his back and gave him a few reassuring murmurs.
He could still hear his comm unit, though it was set to low volume. The Avengers were trying to contain the robots but they kept coming, and with three members out, it was taking a huge toll. Thank God they still had the Hulk.
“Jesus, he’s being difficult today.” Bruce muttered, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. Steve felt a small pang of sympathy for him.
Tony was forced to sit and watch on a screen as the battle went on, listening to the comms and unable to do anything himself. It was torture.
As he was talking to himself, Tony noticed that the robot against the wall was being cut free by three others.
“So if you turn out to be not-evil, what then? Stark can’t talk to dogs either. And you can’t stay, since he already made a no-animals rule.” Clint started to pick at his fingernails and Tony heaved a sigh.
She made it to him in a few seconds and slammed into his side hard enough to make Tony’s claws grate across the ground with a fork-meet-plate type of sound. He whipped them around to put himself between her and Loki as he clawed at her face, moving to dodge a swipe that never actually made contact thanks to a giant rushing wall of solid orange fur. Tony fell back on his side at the sudden loss of contact, watching in confused bewilderment as Steve and Thor proceeded to subdue her in record time.
“Alright, Coyote, you’re being deployed as soon as it’s dark out. Make sure to memorize that map while we wait.” Natasha said, unstrapping herself to work on setting up the comm connections. They were coming up on their target; the quinjet would be set down a mile or so out, just in case there was anyone was lurking around in the vicinity of the town. Tony was headed to the church- it was so dilapidated and battered that there wasn’t even a roof, so he would have to be careful navigating his way through. It was mostly one big chapel so as long as he steered clear of debris he would likely be alright.
Tony crouched there, frozen, for god knows how long, until he managed to shake himself out of it and retreat at a run back the way he came, trying to remember which turns he had taken when he couldn’t see his footprints from earlier.
“As much as I loved the hospitality, I really couldn’t stay. Armies to gather, worlds to conquer, that sort of thing.” Loki finally dropped his hand and sat up straight, staring at Tony right in the eye. “I also have a few enemies to vanquish. This is the part where you come in.”
“Now that introductions are over-” Steve said, while turning to look at Coulson,”- what’s the plan?” Coulson took his phone away from his ear and pressed a few buttons before sliding it across the counter for Steve to type in a blank message. He did, and Coulson sat down across from them as he did a few more things on his secondary phone.
Natasha dumped Tony in the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. Tony heard the lock click and he wanted to scream, wanted to run, wanted to tear something apart. Instead he crawled back into the cabinet and and stared at nothing while he floated in the vacuum of space.
Tony had no idea how long he long he laid there in the sink cabinet, where he’d wedged himself in the corner on top of the pile of clean towels. He shook like a leaf and watched himself take the nuke into space again, and again, and again. It was torture. At one point he’d just shut his eyes and let it happen; it must be some kind of karma. There was a reason he was being put through hell again and again, and he just had to face it.
“Sorry, Tony. You won’t go to medical as a human, but as a dog, I can actually make you go. So just let her make sure you’re healthy and we can leave.” Steve whispered, and Tony’s blood started to boil.
“This is my PSA, and I just want to grab a quick burger. I won’t be long.” Peter gave the guy the saddest eyes Tony had ever seen, and he got waved in.
“We’re just about done here. Do you have Tony?” The comms crackled to life, Steve’s voice echoing throughout the cockpit where the off-duty Avengers sat.
“Well, I, uh, can I have some time to think about it? Joining the team, I mean? I can keep quiet about, uh, whatever happens here.” He assured, head moving minutely between Fury and Tony as if gauging their reactions. He’d definitely caught on to the fact that Tony had human-like intelligence, at the least.
“Tony, wait up!” Peter called, and Tony turned to see him jogging out of the restaurant with a box of take-out. He caught up to them, panting, as if he’d run much farther than a few yards down the street. “So, where are we going, again? Some tower?” Coulson looked over his shoulder, then pointed at the peak of Avengers Tower, which was just slightly visible from where they were.
“She is Loki’s… mate. I would refer to her as his ‘wife’, but that term does not quite fit the relationship they have.” The Avengers all looked at each other in alarm. Loki had a
“Tony Stark is okay, kid. Extenuating circumstances have kept him out of the country, with family. It’s a private situation.” Natasha covered smoothly, and the other members of the team subtly relaxed.
“Before I attempted to rouse you, I searched the roof myself. There was no sign of Anthony anywhere, nor his metal suit. He must have been thrown far afield by the blast.” Steve felt his heart jump into his throat. He was about to panic again, but just then a frightened yowl sounded from one of the other cats.
“I know, I promise I’m not keeping him. In fact, we were just out putting up fliers to see if anyone recognized him. I’ll pay for his room and board until we find his owners, please, you won’t even know he’s here.” Peter sucked in a breath while his Aunt sighed out, rubbing her face in a way that suggested she wasn’t surprised.
Tony sat and seethed, watching the TV as the quinjet left the mansion and shot across the city towards uptown.
“Are you sure you want to go back in? It doesn’t look very stable. There’s nothing even here.” Clint objected even as he followed behind. Tony picked his way over to the heap of scaffolding and started to sniff around the whole area; another thing that had spooked him about the place. The only smell was crumbling brick and sharp dust, nothing alive and nothing green. Vegetation had only grown up the outside walls; grass was short and washed out while weeds were only as tall as his ankles. After thirty years of abandonment Tony would have thought that things would have been a little more overgrown.
“Remembering what? He literally blanked out in the middle of the kitchen.” Steve whispered, making sure that Tony wouldn’t be able to hear the distress in his voice.
Leaving Clint behind, Steve began climbing up a tree again, hoping to use height to make his search easier. Focusing his hearing again, ignoring Clint’s footsteps as he went away, Steve noticed the sound of... sand? Definitely sand, and the sound of two pairs of footsteps, one lighter and quicker paced and one with a longer stride. Sand was at the playground, the exact opposite direction Steve headed to when he found Clint.
Steve didn’t bother finding Natasha—she hadn’t had Tony and he didn’t hear Clint around. Back to the search it was.
“Tony! Wait!” Steve said, quickly coming around the counter, but it was too late as the last drop of the potion disappeared.
Everything looked so normal, Steve almost couldn’t believe that the man who created all of this was currently a child eating a sandwich upstairs.
Steve glanced at the elevator, surprised that she was visiting at this hour, “Let her in, Jarvis.” Steve placed his newspaper to the side as the elevator door opened and Pepper walked in.
Tony gave a subtle nod, still not lifting his head up. “I know he’s not real... but I want a picture.”
“Nope. I have a meeting and you said you didn’t want a babysitter so you’re coming with me to Shield.” Steve held out Tony’s coat and hat, “You can do it after we come back.”
Tony could feel the slight breeze drifting between the long curtains and hear the crashing of waves just outside their bungalow. It was nighttime, and Tony knew his husband was out on their porch, leaning against the pillows out there with a sketchbook against his lap. They’ve been out there often enough that Tony could imagine how Steve looked, handsome face made sharp and angular like a Greek statue from the lights emitted by the tiki torches.
Steve jogged over to them, a tiny bit of urgency in his steps. Tony, seeing him come, was about to stand up and run over to him with a happy wave of his toy shovel, only to stay put when Clint gently reminded him of their game.
Tony’s eyes were dazed and glassy, narrow slits framed by eyelashes clumped from tears of pleasure. He was moaning low and seemingly never-ending—his voice husky and uneven. The neck next to his face was littered in red love bites, as was the shoulder he was resting his head on. The back he was gripping onto had red lines running up and down, left to right.
As Steve began to remove his clothes, he couldn’t help but wonder if Tony recognized the Jarvis’s voice. He did create him after all.
“So, you like it?” Tony asked, lips practically kissing Steve’s thumb. That gaze was a much better reaction than anything he could have hoped for.
Steve shook his head, “Just lunch, but that was hours ago,” and sat Tony down on the couch when Bruce gestured with to it.
“Hey, at least we’re halfway there. Just a few more potions,” Nat said and Bruce nodded in agreement.
Steve placed his hands on the back of Tony’s thighs, giving them a squeeze before having them wrap around his hips. Tony let out a small groan when he felt Steve’s cock brush against the bottom of his ass. Steve chuckled.
Another explosion made the ground roll, and Tony’s priorities re-aligned to the possibility of the mansion being hit.
As the day wore on, Tony got more and more anxious. Had Pepper seen his message? What if it was sorted as spam, and none of them were actually looking for him? By mid-afternoon he was pacing and lashing his tail, while Peter absentmindedly clicked away on his laptop. It got to the point where Tony was getting a bruise on his tail where it kept hitting things, and Peter was getting annoyed by the constant
Loki, again. Tony flailed and tried to get to his feet, but he was dizzy, and his legs didn’t want to work right. Something was wrong.
“She’s alive, thank God. Let’s get her out.” Tony called, squeezing himself underneath the board and gently pushing on it with his back. Peter’s aunt groaned in pain when it shifted, and he paused to call out to the group, who all besides Thor were wedging themselves underneath it around May.
Tony’s legs were still wobbly and weak from all the exertion and smoke he’d breathed in, but he limped a few shaky laps around the exam table. Hannah jotted down some notes on her clipboard and then set it down with a hum.
that. Thor, how does that collar work?” Steve asked, leaning forward to get a better look at it. Thor chuckled and settled himself down in a chair that creaked ominously but held.
“All I really need you to do is hang out and keep me updated. I have a lot going on, and a lot to work out because of this mess. I also don’t think SHIELD has a single agent who could keep track of them all for more than five non-consecutive minutes. Plus, Tony already likes you, so you won’t get nearly as much crap as an actual agent would.”
They eventually threw away their trash and walked back to the mansion, Steve sitting at the kitchen table waiting for the coffee to brew while Tony laid down on the tile floor to cool himself off.
Steve smiled and plugged the drain to let the tub fill, reaching into the linen closet to retrieve the grooming supplies and a towel.
He inwardly cursed the reflex and heaved a sigh, turning to face the other way before he flopped down and stared at the wall.
“Vitals appear stable and non-threatening. I’m glad you’re alright, Sir.” JARVIS’s voice always helped to reassure Tony, and he sighed, letting his shoulders slump a little inside the suit.
“What gives?” Steve shouted, tail lashing in anger for a moment before it smacked Tony in the face. “Sorry.”
noise. Finally, Peter shut his laptop lid with slightly more force than was necessary, and rubbed his face.
A few of the commands Tony had entered before they climbed in were for the flight, planning a route straight to Queens, using autopilot. The entire ride was incredibly uncomfortable- the turbulence and shifting positions made them all push against one another and argue, Thor growling as Tony’s foot smacked into his face, and Steve yelping when Bruce stepped on his tail.
“Tony?” Clint called, his feet padding down the hallway until he could poke his head into the room. “Fury just called. It’s another mission, the debrief is tomorrow morning, on the helicarrier. Is that alright?” He asked, and Tony knew the gentle tone was due to the fiasco earlier in the day. A flare of embarrassment heated the back of his neck, but he forced himself to ignore it.
Tony wanted to go faster, but the other agent seemed to be conserving her energy, which was a smart idea. He was just so anxious and he wanted to be there, to make sure Natasha got out alright. He hated feeling helpless.
Pepper heaved a sigh, picking him up and putting him back on the floor. “Go do something constructive, waiting around and worrying yourselves isn’t going to do any good.” She finished, herding them all back to the elevator and sending them down to the communal floor.
“He’s okay. A little bruised, and hit his head again, but nothing some sleep and a Tylenol won’t fix.” Bruce assured.
“We’ll be back around eight to get you out.” Steve called, the team’s chatter cutting off as he pulled the door shut.
“This is Captain Rogers, sir.” The rest of the cats formed a semicircle in front of the two, neatly wrapping their tails around their paws. Phil gave a small smile at them while Fury absorbed the information.
“Alright, Agent is en route and very angry. He should be here to yell at us in a few minutes.” Tony said, lifting his head into the air and drawing in a huge breath through his nose. “I have no idea how we’re going to find Peter, but he’s gotta be around here somewhere.” He called, trotting back towards the house they had pulled May from.
The camera was shaking rather ridiculously as the reporter and cameraman fled the street they had been standing on, and when it turned back all the Avengers let out sounds of shocked dismay- there was a field of craters in the road ahead of the news crew, and a few of the houses behind the reporter were on fire.
Coulson shot Peter a glare as he sat down. Steve and Bruce jumped up into his lap and were just about to climb onto the table, when the waiter passed by and waved his hands at them.
Tony’s eyes opened, and he laid there for a few moments, wondering what had woken him. The clock on the microwave read
“He was acting a bit strange the other day. He gave me the weirdest look when I brought down lunch, like I had gone nuts.” Steve said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Thank you so much for sticking around <3 please feel free to kudos, and any comments can literally make my day! Hope you're liking it :)
being an asshole, and that he was still an asset, he could do that. If he did what they wanted he could still be an Avenger.
“Peter! He lives in Queens, this must have been why he left so quickly- what an idiot, he went straight home to check on his aunt, we have to do something, he’s going to get in the way and get himself killed-” Tony rambled, leaping off the couch and running back into the kitchen, the rest of the group hot on his heels.
“That was exciting.” Natasha rasped, and Tony whipped around to see her laying in the other bed. They must have brought her in while he was asleep. Tony’s tail wagged a bit and he didn’t really mind the affectionate display; he was just glad that she was alright.
He veered to the side when he heard someone running towards him and he noticed that it was cold- it was bright and cold and he had no idea why, but it was miles better than the water so he kept running, his feet going numb until he hit a patch of slippery rock and he went down, sliding a few feet before he stopped.
Clint walked back and forth between the kitchen and the bedrooms for nearly an hour while Tony subtly spied on him. The archer didn’t seem to care; he actually looked a bit tense. His eyebrows were drawn and he kept spinning an arrow between his fingers. Tony was just about to get up and investigate when he smelled fresh cookies.
Tony thought, occasionally glancing at himself as he passed shop windows. He was a darker brown with a black saddle pattern, like the standard German Shepherd. How the hell was he going to convince his team that he was the real Tony? Clint was the only one that seemed to even like dogs.
“I think Steve is onto something.” Maria called. They looked over to see her holding out her phone, and it was pinging softly. “I’ve got a reactor signature right next to you guys.” Steve stuck his head behind the dumpster, and was almost surprised when he hooked a paw into the helmet and yanked it out. He’d been hoping for Tony himself.
Tony wasn’t sure when he’d fallen asleep, but he woke up on his own, the couch cold where Pepper had been sitting. He didn’t blame her for leaving; she had so much to do now that Tony was out for the count. He felt better after her visit and felt his mood slightly lifted.
Tony couldn’t have been looking through the code for long before Bruce entered the lab, a mug of coffee in one hand and a food bowl in the other.
Someone gave him a bruising slap on the back and Tony coughed, throwing up the rest of the water he hadn’t already. This time the burning started to fade and he could actually get in a real breath. Tony gasped and his chest heaved while the world came back into focus.
“Yea, I don’t find myself over this way as often anymore. I was going by today, though, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to say hi.”
“I for-rgot you were in here.” Clint said, his voice absolutely wrecked, hoarse and cracking on ‘forgot’. Tony felt a spike of both alarm and concern, poking his head around the corner. Clint was sitting with his back against the island cupboards and his knees drawn up to his chest. The cookie dough from the sheet was scattered across the floor and Clint kept his head buried in his arms, tremors snaking up and down his back and likely worsened from how rigid his muscles were.
Tony swooped in low, doing loops and getting as close as he could to get the bugs’ attention. They crawled over each other in a mass of squirming green towards Tony and he stayed just close enough to keep their focus, but stayed back far enough to not become lunch.
Sure, Loki was a bad guy- he caused the deaths of millions. He probably deserved everything he got. So why was Tony feeling guilty about watching him get ripped apart?
“This must be where he landed. You can see the ruts in the pavement.” Coulson ran his fingers over a gouge, checking out everything in the alley while Maria packed the suit into two duffel bags that they had brought. A few backup agents reported to them a few minutes after they were done, and they took it with them to bring back to the tower where JARVIS could analyze it and get readings about the spell. Meanwhile, the team tried to pick up his scent again- though it wasn’t much use. New York was huge, smelly, and loud- they would need to wait until they found another energy reading, or had an amazing stroke of luck before they could track down their team-mate.
you can do in that form to stop me.” Even Loki’s voice sounded like Tony’s, though he talked just a tad bit different. Not that any of the Avengers would ever be able to tell.
Hey, little edit; I totally forgot to put in the Russian translations, I apologize! So here they are:
the guy was. He looked like he wasn’t even in college yet! What business does he have, getting involved in the most dangerous lifestyle around? There were plenty of enhanced individuals that didn’t go into hero work! If his collar hadn’t been taken, that kid would be getting an earful of Tony’s opinion on how he spent his free time.
“Tony! You’re going to get snow everywhere!” Steve called, running after him with a faint groan of exasperation. Tony knew he was being difficult, but he refused to be bathed. How humiliating!
Dead quiet. No clunking or clicking or chugging; nothing that would suggest a machine. Tony peeked over the edge of the ladder and almost didn’t believe what met his eyes.
“Well you can’t open doors as a dog. What if the door gets shut while you’re in your room? It’s easier for you to be living in the main communal areas, where there aren’t so many ways to get stuck.” He made it sound sensical, but Tony was still pissed about it when they got back to the mansion.
“Feel free to rough him up a bit, so he doesn’t forget our terms. Make sure not to wake anyone else.” Loki hissed to his men, and Tony bit down on his tongue as a few feet kicked him sharply in the ribs and back. When Loki returned to the room, he waved them off towards the front door. With a glint of silver he crouched above Tony once more and sliced his cheek, then through the leather of his collar, departing with it in hand. Almost instantly he felt blood welling up and dripping warmly through his fur. Tony just breathed, in and out, careful not to make a peep despite the burning ache in his cheek and throat.
When they arrived at the building a few hours later, Fury led them straight to the hanger and without much preamble shooed them on a quinjet and on their way to Italy. The three of them plus four other agents made for a full ride, yet nobody talked anything but shop. The agent seated next to Tony was the only one to actually cover some protocols and gave him a crash-course in SHIELD etiquette.
The ride back felt long, but when Tony finally saw the mansion come into view he let himself relax. His spirits lifted as they touched down and he padded across the yard, excited to be greeted by Natasha at the sunroom door.
“He called me after you fell asleep, talking a mile a minute about how you ‘nearly died’. I asked a nurse when I came by today and she said it was just a bit of fluid. That does not count as nearly dying, Clint.” Steve directed the last sentence at Clint, who stuck his tongue out without glancing up from their game.
Steve gently tilted Tony’s head up again, “I will never leave you, Tony. Do you understand? Sometimes I might have to go away for a bit to save people, but I will always come back for you.”
“Well, aren’t you two adorable.” Steve and Tony turned around, seeing Natasha in her workout clothes. She must have just come back from her run, since her skin was slightly
“You go first! I’ll be right there!” Steve yelled back. The smile on his face slipped a smidge when he saw Tony slip a little getting on the ice, but Tony’s giggle as Natasha slowly pulled him across the ice quickly put it back.
“Hah, except crazy old me.” Tony muttered to himself. He walked through the automatic doors and up the stairs until he was in the kitchen on the first floor. Like Jarvis said, the place was completely empty. The only movements he saw were from the trees outside through the large windows and glass doors.
Clint yawned out a thanks as he flopped next to Natasha, groaning when she smacked the back of his head with her magazine. He then turned on the tv, where a commercial advertising a sale was playing, jolly music and all.
Tony smiled, exhausted, and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling him down until they were touching from head to toe. “Maybe once or twice,” Tony said.
“Yep,” Steve grinned proudly, as if feeding Tony was an accomplishment. “He finished his bottle about ten minutes ago. I didn’t realize he was such an early riser though.”
“T-Tony?” Steve said as he walked to the large gathering, the door flipping close behind the Avengers. He tried to look above the crowd to spot a small brunette child but the scientists were waving their hands everywhere, making things difficult to see.
Natasha and Clint were leaning against Bruce, who looked like he was struggling under their combined weight and wincing from their sticky hair. Thor was practically bouncing in place, the adrenaline from a successful day still coursing through him. Steve, however, was staring silently as the numbers in the elevator as It went up.
The descent was quick, and the doors slid open to reveal a large high-tech lab. As an engineering genius with a budget that allowed him to create practically anything he wanted, the lab was no doubt incredible: steel walls, an area full of monitors, and dozens of Iron Man suits stood in glass displays at the perimeter.
Steve couldn’t stop at just one photo—Tony looked too happy and Steve wanted to engrave this moment into something physical. By the end of their impromptu photo shoot, Steve had thirty wonderful photos.
It was past noon now and Steve was hoping that with a nap and some food, Tony would no longer be upset. Although progress was good, there were so many of these purple creatures it felt like they only knocked back a little more than half. The Hulk was happily stomping on them, like a puppy jumping in puddles, but Natasha and Clint were starting to slow down. Steve, himself, was feeling alright for now, but he knew that in six hours he would slow down too. Making it back by nighttime now seemed more hopeful than not.
Unlike the communal floor below, Steve’s floor didn’t have a fancy fireplace in the center of the room. Instead, he had white couches on a plush, cream rug, contrasting against the birch flooring. Books and paintings lined the white walls and gave wonderful pops of colors, especially during the day when the floor-to-ceiling windows allowed sunlight to stream in.
Steve was moving so fast, in and out of Tony’s body like a jackhammer, hard enough that Tony felt like every breath was forced out of his lungs, like he had to struggle to keep breathing. He rubbed his face into his pillow, as if he could push back the intense pleasure just a little—have this last a little longer.
“Be quiet. I think I heard something.” Steve carefully approached the scuffed up armor and lowered his body until the side of his head was placed next to the suit’s abdomen.
“He’s taking a nap right now. He should be up soon though.” Pepper nodded her head, and held her purse closer to her side. Steve and Pepper were never around each other without Tony there, and he could feel the awkward tension surrounding them. “Please sit down. I’ll go make us some tea.”
“You’re doing a wonderful job caring for him. Thank you,” Pepper said before walking to the elevator.
Now, Steve was relaxed against the white sofa, a soft smile on his face, as he watched Tony waddle between him and the toys spread out on the cream rug. Calling Tony energetic, especially after having woken up and being fed, was an understatement.
“Well, I do. So hands off my breadsticks,” Natasha grumbled in reply. She flicked a clump of goopy hair out of her face.
“Okay,” Tony mumbled. His eyes were already beginning to close, being lulled to sleep by Steve gently patting his back.
Steve let out a fond sigh, “I’ll bring the car around then. C’mon, Tony. You look like you’re about to fall asleep on your feet.” Steve grabbed the rest of the ice cream cup out of Tony’s hand and crouched down. Immediately, Tony climbed onto his back and wrapped his arm around Steve’s neck.
“I found this on the table. Look what I drew!” Tony cheerfully handed Steve the tablet. Steve looked down and saw that the sketching app he sometimes used was open. His heart instantly melted when he saw what Tony drew: a colorful picture of the Avengers standing next to each other, with Steve in his Captain America uniform carrying a small child that he knew to be Tony.
Steve looked down at toddler playing with his uniform. Tony was making little cooing noises as his tiny hands nudged at the star stretched across Steve’s chest. Even as an infant, Tony was so curious. If Shield took Tony, they would probably keep him in a blank room. Observe him through one way glass. The only time he’ll get any human contact is when they come to poke and prod him and take blood from those fragile arms. Tony would just be another strange phenomenon to them.
“… I can’t say, Steve.” Bruce stared at Tony from his seat, a sad downturn on his lips, “But he may not.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded and hurriedly pressed a button. The robot began moving, shooting forward on its wheels like something kicked it before stopping for a second and repeating. It didn’t stop until it hit the leg of the couch and turned back around.
Bruce shrugged when he noticed a few looks. “Perks of having seven PhDs,” he said before gently pushing the doors.
Tony looked up at Steve. Large brown eyes looked even bigger from this angle, and a pout completed the sad puppy look, “Does that mean I don’t get ice cream?”
Tony then climbed out of the blankets and slipped under Steve’s arms, maneuvering himself until he could lean forward to hug Steve. Steve hugged him back tightly, as if he could make up for all those months Tony felt helpless and scared.
Maria went to the next slide, showing the volunteers, this time looking like they were in their twenties, behind prison bars. “Although there seems to be no side effects, the volunteers were arrested because they helped gather ‘ingredients’ in exchange for continued dosages.”
When he was positioned near Clint, Steve jumped off and landed on the grass with a soft thump. Clint quickly slid off his load and swung it at Steve, who jumped and narrowly missed having his legs tied by the bag’s straps.
When Tony was completely in the water, Steve pushed him up against the wall of the pool, the lengths of their bodies pressed tightly together.
“S-steve?” Tony said to the man just outside, “Could you come in here?” Hearing Steve’s shuffling, Tony began pushing himself up the bed until he was in the middle. He didn’t know where to put his limbs. Should he cross his legs? Not with this thing on. Lie on his side? On his back?
