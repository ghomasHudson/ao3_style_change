“Jesus, fuck! How did you do that!” Tony massages his chest, looking at Steve, expecting to see him doing the same – but Steve’s face is expressionless.
The place Steve had chosen for them to stay surprises him – thus far, they had both chosen rather reserved locations. The only requirement had been a bedroom and a door that locks. This house looks vaguely similar to the Malibu mansion – definitely not as sprawling – but the house clings to the cliff-edge, and when Tony opens the door of his car, he can hear the ocean crashing against the rock below.
“Well…” Steve kisses the curve of his shoulder gently and Tony sighs against the pillow, his fisted hands slowly releasing the sheets that his blunt nails had been tearing small holes into. “Do you want me to…?”
“Yep,” Tony says, walking forward, hearing Steve inhale sharply. He walks all the way down the thin beaten path to the edge of the cliff, whistling as he stares down at the base. “No wonder it took us hours, Steve, this shit is tall. Where’s Nebula’s sister?”
“I’m not Captain America. I’m Tony Stark. In the future, the world will rally at the battle cry of Captain America. They won’t do that for Tony Stark. It’s simple, I die, you get the Stone. You go back home, you all use the Infinity Stones to get everyone back – life moves on. You have to trust me, this is the only way.”
“Tony…”
“Who?” Steve carefully advances forward, his hand still on Tony’s arm, keeping him a few paces behind him.
that I have a lot on my plate.”
there wouldn’t be as much work for me to do. But you all are enjoying playing hooky, aren’t you?”
“Sorry, Mr. Stark – we weren’t even on the bridge yet, and I saw it. I had to come help.”
Tony leans forward, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple, his brown eyes dark. The coarse hair of his goatee burns against the shell of Steve’s ear, and his lips are soft against blushing skin.  “Make me.”
Steve shakes his head slowly.
“I’ll follow you,” Tony snaps over his shoulder, already walking towards the escalators that will lead him to the car rental section of the airport. “You just wait on your death-machine, and I’ll follow you. You don’t even wear a fucking helmet.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve murmurs, his voice soft – he had said the same thing in Tony’s ear, after… “I’ll see you there.”
“Hello?” Steve barely manages to say as his hips rock upward, Tony has a talented mouth, maddeningly so.
Steve sighs, passing the razor over the back of his head one more time, wanting to make sure it’s even. He had cut the hair on the sides shorter than the hair on the top of Tony’s head, which he was proud of – usually when he cut his own hair, he buzzed it all down to the same length for simplicity’s sake.
Pepper nods, taking the flowers from him to place them in a waiting vase on the table next to Tony’s bed. Her eyes are red from crying.
“You’re crazy. You’d kill me. I’m not stupid, Steve, and this -,” he waves his glove over his face, “This is a priceless face. You’d be in debt for the rest of your life, with the amount of bills you’d get from my plastic surgeon.”
Eventually, the vibration ceases, and Tony takes a deep breath.
Tony laughs, humorless. He slides the ring onto his left ring finger, holding it up against the light of the bedside lamp, examining it. It fits perfectly.
Tony scowls and looks back at the engine block, “No.”
“No, you moron. I sold it because I didn’t need it anymore. Pep found her own apartment in the city – we split the cash fifty-fifty, she helped me build it, so.” Tony shrugs. “I’ve got the compound now. The compound…” Tony frowns, picking up his fresh cappuccino. “I’d like to sell it, too. We need to downsize. With only three active Avengers…”
“You kidding? Me, subterfuge? Totally not my scene. Romanoff and Barton, though? They’re probably having a ball. I bet they’ve strung 2012 Tony up in a sex dungeon somewhere. Might as well, I don’t know how they’ve resisted this long.”
Sam offers to take all the Stones back to their rightful place, and Steve is finally out of the med bay for that meeting. His chest and abdomen still ache, and the mottled burns look terrible – but it’s all okay, because he’s going to see Tony again. Very soon.
Steve does know that. The past three visits to Paris, he had listened as Tony had curled against his side and recounted his worries about Peter Parker. Something was going on with the boy, something that Tony couldn’t quite figure out – and then Tony had been saddled with a Senate hearing, which Steve had watched the entirety of from his bed in Wakanda.
“Missed me, or missed…?”
Tony tenses in his arms, pushing himself up off of Steve slightly. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Now?”
“I’m here, Steve.” He reaches up to probe at the side of his head, now crusty with blood, but no longer actively bleeding.
“I’m not drunk,” he insists, pulling away from Steve and leading the way out of the restaurant. “Maybe a little tipsy – but not drunk, and I plan on walking it off.”
Two words, that’s all Steve thought Tony was worth – but perhaps he’s being uncharitable. He knew, of course, about Steve and Peggy’s relationship. His Aunt Peggy always softened when she mentioned Captain America, there was always a slight curve of her lips upwards when she said his name. Steve. So softly, reverently almost – like they had shared something secret. The same sort of secret thing Tony had shared with Steve less than 48 hours ago.
“Yes,” Tony says finally, sounding relieved. “God, yes.”
– being murdered.
Driving on the opposite side of the road is quite the learning curve, Tony realizes, as he almost dies twice on his long drive up from Edinburgh to Inverness. At Inverness, he stops at a café to get a coffee, hoping that the caffeine will jolt his brain into working properly. It must not be working properly because here he is, driving to the cottage that Steve wants to meet at – a cottage that is secluded, it had taken Tony two minutes of rapid clicking the arrow down the road to find the next dwelling on Google Maps, at least five miles away
“You’re bleeding,” he repeats robotically, grabbing the bottle of rubbing alcohol from the table. Quickly, his hand is cupped over Steve’s eye, guarding it as he rips the cap off of the bottle with his teeth, dumping a generous amount on Steve’s cut.
“My palate isn’t that underdeveloped,” Steve complains, though he takes the fork Tony’s offering him anyways.
“I heard you the first time,” Tony says dryly, “Do I have time to freshen up?”
Tony stands in front of the sink, leaning forward over the edge of it to inspect himself in the mirror. He runs his fingers through his hair slowly, pushing strands of it away from his forehead. His hand drops away from the top of his head, fingertips brushing over the dark bags under his eyes, the wrinkles that crinkle the corners of them. At some point, he had aged.
“What’s the matter with me? With me?!”
“I was sorry to have missed it.”
“Yeah, that one. He worked for HYDRA, apparently – was an assassin for them. Did a damn good job, too, assassinating my parents. Brainwashed, Steve said – not aware of what he was doing. But Steve knew. This whole time, Steve knew that my parents were killed. And he knew who did it, and he knew that Barnes was alive.”
“I’m not wearing these things,” Tony mutters, leaning back against Steve again as he wraps his arms around him.
“Have you ever cut hair?” Tony reaches up with his left hand to rub at the shaven side of his head, fingers rising and falling with the bumps of his sutures, the metal plate just under his skin.
“Cap,” Sam frowns, and Natasha is frowning at him too.
Tony’s back rests against the cool, smooth wall. He wants to ruck up his sweater and press his bare skin to it in an effort to cool himself down – but he thinks that will just rile the two of them up more. He can’t afford to make another mistake.
“You want to go into the aquarium?” Steve jerks his thumb over his shoulder, children squealing in delight as they run ahead of their parents into the building.
“He has to do it,” Bucky speaks up at his right. “It’s just putting the Stones back, right? He’s strong enough for that. And he can take his time.”
“But I didn’t. And I tore the team apart. And I hurt you. I’ll regret that to the day I die. I was selfish. I asked too much, and I took too much. What do you want me to do, Tony?” Steve looks over his shoulder at him, the question sincere. “Do you want me to turn myself in? I will.”
Steve’s white mouth guard, now pink with blood and spit, flies out of his mouth and lands on the mat. He shoves Tony away with all of his strength, sending the other man flying into the ropes on the other side of the ring.
“Hey, Tony, could you give me a hand?”
“Are you gonna throw a punch, Tony, or just dance around?”
“God, Tony,” Steve snarls, “Just when I think you see things the right way -.”
Pepper manages a smile, gently carding her fingers through Tony’s hair, a long curl straightening between her fingers as she pulls her hand away. “You know it, Tony. I’ll call you tonight, okay?”
“Steve, you need rest,” her voice lowers, an effort to be soothing – but Steve isn’t the Hulk, and he needs to see Tony.
“Mr. Stark?”
Weeks pass. Tony heals, and slowly starts to spend more time out of the bedroom. Steve had peered in it once when Tony was in the bathroom, expecting to see a new Iron Man suit already standing at attention. All he saw was a neatly made bed and a notebook on the nightstand beside it.
Tony watches him as he drags a chair over towards where he’s sitting, and Tony’s expression is inscrutable. Sometimes, Steve finds cracks in the façade – sometimes. Like when he’s drinking a bottle of beer, and Tony’s eyes fixate on his lips as he takes a sip. Or when someone says something funny, and Tony turns to Steve with a grin, his eyes bright with mirth. Steve had never thought twice about those little cracks, those little tells – but now he’s thinking over every time Tony’s gaze had lingered on him.
“Tony,” Steve shifts down so that he’s not looming over the other man, gently stroking the curve of Tony’s jaw with his free hand. “You said it was at your hotel.”
? But that would be cruel, and Tony is already cringing away, as if Steve’s rejection will feel like a physical blow. “Course you can, Tony. I won’t even complain if you snore.”
There’s a sharp pain in his chest, just under his sternum, and Tony’s hand clenches into a fist on his knee. Peggy Carter, the woman who always slipped him a chocolate bar when his mother wasn’t looking, is dead – and he is unable to attend her funeral, because he is sat at this goddamn table in Vienna, supporting a set of laws that he’s both proud of and ashamed of.
“You cook?” Steve grimaces as Tony walks in front of him, the back of his neck painfully red.
“Yes,” Tony says, shrugging out of Rhodey’s grip – he has to pack. The address Steve’s neat script had written out seems to be residential. He’ll scrutinize it on the flight there. “But I’ll try not to break my previous record of incredible stupidity.”
By the time Tony wakes up, he’s got quite the tan – and a bit of a sunburn on the back of his neck. He yawns, blinking his eyes open behind the sunglasses, and frowns when he sees Steve.
“Yes,” Tony says shortly, still blushing. He smiles, a hesitant smile – but a real one. “More than alright. Thank you.”
“Have you ever actually been on a vacation?” Tony brings Steve’s hand up to his mouth, so that he can tear the tape with his teeth. He grabs his right hand, holding his breath without even realizing it, his fingertips gently brushing over the calluses on Steve’s palm before getting to work.
Steve breathes in deeply, the hair of Tony’s goatee scratching against taut muscle as Tony kisses and licks his way intently across his chest, and then down his abdomen. Tony’s tongue trails over one well defined abdominal muscle, closing his eyes, his hands grabbing at Steve’s thighs to splay them.
Their table is cleared in front of them, Tony’s glass of wine is refilled, and he reaches up to undo his tie. Steve’s blue eyes narrow, and his hand falls away from his neck, tie remaining tight.
Sam looks at Steve uncertainly, like he doesn’t trust Tony to play nice. The bruised bite twinges.
“You did. Can’t remember when. You were just talking, and talking.” Steve picks up Tony’s empty paper coffee cup and rolls it between his palms. “I love it when you do that.”
Natasha Romanoff stands in the doorway to his room, a plastic key disappearing from her hand as Tony walks towards her with his mouth agape.
Steve winces and then reaches up to rub at the swelling skin on the right side of his face, no doubt sore from Tony’s punch.
“I can’t believe you betray the Yankees like that,” Tony shakes his head, pulling Steve’s comforter up over his shoulders.
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve says breathlessly, relaxing under Tony as he makes himself comfortable on top of Steve. “I was just going to the bathroom.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“When did you get here?” Tony’s voice is sharp as he follows Steve up to the door, his hands deep in his pockets. One tap of a finger to the screen of the smart-watch on his wrist, and he would have a gauntlet – with enough power to blast Steve’s head off.
Steve pauses, setting the sketchbook down on his lap. “Weren’t you in the desert, though?”
Tony doesn’t push him onto the bed, which surprises Steve – their time apart usually leads to undeniable desire that results in them tangled up together in the sheets before they can think of doing anything else. Instead, he silently takes Steve’s hand, and leads him out of the room.
Tony’s grip on his wrist tightens, and Steve grimaces.
“And…” The figure continues, “Steven, son of Sarah. Well, Captain Rogers, I must say this is unexpected…”
Tony pulls his suitcase behind him as he walks over to Steve, and he tenses immediately as Steve wraps him in a tight hug.
But Steve had kissed him back.
“I’ve got it, thanks,” Tony sneers. “I can take care of myself, if it’s not obvious.”
“God damn it,” he says softly.
He straddles the motorcycle, reaching up to brush a droplet of Tony’s blood off of the shimmering silver of the handlebar.
“Shut up,” Steve says, his voice tight.
“Ah…” Tony takes a large gulp of coffee. “Yeah, he said no. Did you hear about what happened with Toomes?”
Tony is still asleep, his mouth slightly agape, and Steve looks away after the briefest glance at Tony’s face – his eyes are blackened, and there’s a nasty bruise creeping down from the gauze on the side of his head.
“Bastard.”
“Fine, I’ll keep the ring. I’ll just pretend that it’s a birthday present.”
“It’s okay, Pepper.” Tony grabs at the sheets, struggling to pull himself upright. “He needs to hear it from me, fine. He won’t like what I have to say – but Captain America wants a debrief. Has to have it now, right Steve? Always asking for too much.”
“You and I both know that whatever orders HYDRA gave, they would have specified the need for no witnesses. I’m telling you, Tony – I swear to you, he wasn’t there. Bucky wasn’t there. His body was there, yes – but his mind? We’re just beginning to get him back. I can… I can arrange for you to speak with a spokesperson from Wakanda, they can talk you through what they’ve found while…”
Now it’s Tony turn to ogle Steve shamelessly as he swallows the oyster, and there’s color high in his cheeks, a slight smile on his face. He’s had a lot of time to think about this – them – since he abandoned Steve at the cottage.
“Tony…” Bruce Banner blanches at the sight of him as they step into the compound. “Hang on, you need to go to the med bay.”
“No one is listening to us, Steve,” Tony snorts, nudging his silverware in an attempt to keep his hands occupied. “If we were speaking French, that would be another story – but I picked this place because I knew we wouldn’t be… Recognized, or interrupted. Anyways, Ross won’t be making another appearance, at least, not without my invitation. He caught me off guard, otherwise I wouldn’t have been so easy to strangle.”
Steve is wearing a scarf –
“Tony?” Unlike the call in the hospital, Steve’s voice is crisp, deep, and Tony hates the rush of desire that moves through his body all the way down to his toes. At least there’s fear, there, too – and out of the corner of his eye he can see Steve’s hand clenched into a fist.
“Well,” Tony pauses, thinking it over. “I’m not Captain America.”
Tony hangs up, feeling like he’s going to be sick. He leans over the side of the bed and vomits, dimly aware of the fact that he’s ruined Pepper’s shoes and that there’s blood in his vomit.
That thought makes him grin.
“Poignant,” Tony nods, and apparently Red Skull isn’t a fan of sarcasm, because red lips are drawn back into a grimace.
“You’re here, with me,” Steve supplies, his lips pressing against Tony’s, Tony’s hands slipping from his hair to wrap around him fully. “Here with me,” he repeats, feeling Tony tense as Steve’s hand moves between his thighs.
We can’t even – legally – get married while that’s happening.” Tony holds up a second finger, ticking each reason off as he goes. “Secondly, I think you’re mistaking distance for deeper feelings.”
Steve sighs, running a hand over his face, fingers scratching at his beard. He’s not tired, but he doubts he’ll see Tony for at least twelve hours. Inwardly, as he makes his way to the bedroom beside Tony’s, he hopes the man will stay for more than one night. He hopes his admission will be enough. If he can’t get Tony’s forgiveness, at least he will be able to get Tony’s acceptance – and maybe that will be enough for them.
Steve nods.
Steve’s whole body warms –
Tony squeezes his hand, turning his head to look at him slowly. “I — Guess I should’ve stuck around longer, then… Uh, listen, Steve.” Tony’s palm is sweaty against his, and Steve can feel his pulse thrumming in his wrist. “I don’t exactly have a place… I was wondering, when I got out, if…”
“Schmidt.”
“I love you,” Steve argues. Tony gives him the wounded look he’s taken to making in response to Steve saying that.
“It’s a glowing rock,” Tony corrects, reaching over and shoving it into Steve’s pocket. Steve grumbles, brushing him aside with his shoulder, but he doesn’t bother removing it. “You’ve got more pocket space,” Tony nudges him playfully, “I’ve got too many samples.”
Pepper takes all of this information in stride, though what Tony says next makes her blink.
Tony holds his hand up, finally moving it away from the light in his chest, and Steve relaxes imperceptibly.
Steve laughs and shakes his head, “Not clinically, no, but I’m pretty terrible. I’ll spare you.”
When Steve wakes the following morning, squinting against the bright sunlight filtering through the curtains, he expects to hear the apartment’s fire alarms ringing shrilly. Something must be on fire, because the bed is burning up – Steve must be holding a furnace in his arms, the heat of it is incredible. He lifts his head sleepily from the pillow, looking down at Tony where he’s curled up with his back against Steve’s chest. The tan skin of his neck is flushed pink, and Steve leans forward, watching the blush as it spreads over his chest. Tony is breathing shallowly, his eyes screwed tightly shut, and Steve notices sweat beaded on the other man’s forehead.
“Every day. You saw me almost every day for over a year – you had every opportunity to tell me about Barnes and my parents. Why didn’t you?”
Peter’s arms wrap around him, and he groans as he heaves Tony into an upright position, gasping as a rush of blood flows out over the ruined undersuit.
“I made sure the pants were tight on purpose,” Tony admits, his arm wrapping around Steve’s waist. “I know how to accentuate my assets, as it were.”
“My reactor – key is in…” Tony turns his head slowly to the other side, there’s a plastic bag containing the clothes he had been brought to the hospital in. “Pocket.”
“Bit early for that.” Tony peers into the package, he sees some square object at the base of it, and a handwritten letter.
“No,” Steve says suddenly. “No, we all need to talk.”
“108th and Madison,” he grinds out, his voice hoarse. “Christ, Steve, I don’t have any more coins – had to crawl on the ground to get here, God – are you coming? I need you to come Steve, I need you -.”
It takes two passes of 108th and Madison before Steve finally catches sight of him – or someone that could be him. A body is sprawled out facedown in the beginning of an alleyway, a socked foot visible in the dim circle of light from the streetlight above it. Steve runs over to the shadowed form, hoodie slung over his shoulder.
Steve holds the scissors above Tony’s head, his hair slipping between the teeth of the comb that Steve runs through it. Tony holds his breath as the scissors snick through his hair.
Steve leaves Tony where he’s sat on the toilet, pressing the button of the clippers off and on idly, the machine vibrating in his hand. He takes two minutes to wash the kitchen scissors with soap and hot water, scrubbing almost as intensely as Tony had done with the dishes.
“I’m hanging up,” Tony says dully, pulling the phone away from his ear.
Steve trails behind them, Tony can hear the man’s heavy footsteps.
“It’s okay, Tony, you fall asleep. I’ll be here. Sun’s coming up, anyways.”
Steve’s hand wraps around him and Tony’s hips buck at the touch. Half a dozen quick, tight strokes of his hand, and one well-timed twist of his wrist and Tony shudders apart in his arms, gasping his name breathlessly.
“Expensive stuff, Tony.” Steve’s lips press against his skin, his beard a newfound sensation that makes Tony shudder involuntarily. Tony’s free hand grasps at the edge of the counter for support. “You’re exhausted,” he murmurs, nosing the brown curls at the nape of his neck. “Did you drive here straight from the airport?”
Steve seems completely oblivious, occasionally pointing out some aspect of a nearby building that catches his artistic eye.
“Bastards took my wallet – took everything. They recognized me, Steve, I couldn’t think of any number to call. Just yours.” Tony’s voice wavers, and Steve trips as he puts on his sweatpants – Tony is crying.
“Let’s get you inside, sweetheart,” Pepper murmurs, her tears dripping off of Quill’s red jacket. Tony had become increasingly cold on the Benatar, as his body had withered away, leaving him as skin and bones. He swims in the jacket even now, and he’s shivering – though he’s not sure if it’s from the cold or from the adrenaline.
“Your stomach was rumbling while you slept,” Tony mutters, turning to the door. “I’m going to go and get us some breakfast. You just stay there and relax,” he looks over his shoulder at him, gaze lingering on Steve until his cheeks flush pink. “You’re cute when you blush,” are Tony’s parting words, said with a cheeky grin.
) cell phone up to his ear.
Peter swallows, nods, and then points over the edge of the platform they’re standing on. “But – What about the wizard?”
Steve is pulling him back to the bed, and Tony goes willingly.
“Tony,” Steve hisses, grabbing the other man roughly by the upper arm. Tony physically recoils from his touch, and Steve drops his hand away, blue eyes guilty. “C’mon, Tony,” he pleads. “We’re in the middle of the airport. Can’t this wait until we get… Get to where we’re staying?”
“We have to stick together, Tony,” Steve’s hand is on his foot, his touch gentle through the blanket that covers Tony’s body. “As a team – if we stick together, we’ll be able to think of something. We always have.”
But Tony wants Steve’s arms around him again, wants Steve to cover his body in adoring kisses – wants to feel the rush that comes when Steve thrusts into him with a groan of his name –
Gently, his fingers curl under Tony’s now smooth jaw, tipping his head away from his abdomen. Tony’s proximity to him had been distracting, and arousing. His breath had been hot, Steve’s skin had heated in response to it ghosting through his shirt.
“No wonder that you’re not getting any, then, looks uncomfortable as hell.” Steve scoots over on the bed, his arms wrapping around Tony’s waist, pulling the other man close to him.
“There’s not much to it,” Tony says between gritted teeth, sweat burning in his eyes, “I just picture your face on the bag and pummel the shit out of it.”
Steve glances down at himself and grimaces, his hands moving to his pockets as he stands at the foot of Tony’s bed.
“What?” Tony asks distractedly as his fingers fumble with the buttons of Steve’s shirt. His rough hands brush over Steve’s bare chest, and he hears Tony exhale slightly.
“Thanos is dead.”
Now it is Tony’s turn to catch Steve off guard, and he watches as the other man’s expression turns guarded, muscles shifting below his beard as he grits his teeth.
“Stop.” Steve reaches out and grabs him by the upper arm, squeezing painfully. “Stop, Tony, there’s someone up there.”
Steve nods slowly, and Tony can feel his tears hot against his own skin.
Tony closes his eyes, resting back against Steve, bending his legs so Steve’s can fit behind his. Steve is wearing sweatpants and a shirt, thank God, or Tony would explode. One large hand rests over his reactor protectively, and Steve’s breath stirs the graying hair above his ear.
Steve reaches up with his injured finger and runs it over the stiffened fabric – they had offered him a scrub shirt, he recalls, but he had shaken his head numbly and sat down.
“We can talk about that afterwards,” Tony mutters, opening the door to the small room with glass walls in the center of the control room. “I just need Steve for this one,” he says to Sam, putting out his hand to stop the other man from following after him. “You can talk to Nat about getting your stuff back.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony decides, opening the door. “I think I’m just having an existential crisis due to my continuing age.”
Steve moves to pull his hand away, but before he can, Tony’s grabbed it – his fingers lace between Steve’s easily, and he hears Tony sigh.
Once Tony has finished eating, he gathers the plates and moves to the sink. He takes his time washing them, scrubbing intently, brown eyes focused. Eventually, Steve moves to his side, pulling Tony’s red hands out from under the scalding water.
It’s something so simple, and intimate – and dangerous. Whenever someone looks at Steve for a moment too long as they walk down the narrow streets, Tony gets anxious, imagining a SWAT team armed to the teeth riddling Steve’s body with bullets.
“Christ,” Tony mutters, keeping his eyes closed. “Just – go back to sleep, Steve.”
“You might wanna take your shirt off, unless you wanna get hair everywhere.” Steve is knelt down in front of his bathroom cabinet, digging through medical and cleaning supplies on the hunt for the razor.
Tony is awake, and his head turns slowly towards the foot of the bed where Steve stands. He’s not as small and gaunt as when he had returned from Titan, Steve can see strength in the muscles of his arms as he shifts on the bed – but he looks exhausted. Steve rubs his foot gently through the blanket, hand trailing up Tony’s leg as he moves to stand directly beside him. He pulls his hand away at Tony’s hip, recalling his internal injuries. A thick white liquid drips slowly in Tony’s IV, and Steve hopes Tony doesn’t feel any pain.
“God damn it,” he mutters as the phone vibrates again, more insistently, if that’s possible. He lowers his hand away from his head, his burned right hand plunging into his pocket to get the phone. He nearly drops it, his entire body shuddering – adrenaline coursing through him, adrenaline and fear.
“Yeah, we did,” Tony snaps, glaring at Steve so hotly that Steve can feel his anger burning through the dark lenses of his sunglasses. “Silly old me, must have slipped my mind. You know what? I think I’m too busy to meet with you today. Way too busy. Maybe if I had the rest of my
“You’ll need stitches,” an EMT tells him hurriedly, before moving on to the next victim.
“We have to get them back, Steve.” Tony steps in closer to him, wrapping an arm around his waist. “I have to – Peter needs to come back. He needs to live. I can’t keep living when he’s not, it’s not fair. And if it takes me dying for you to bring him back, bring everybody back...” Tony shrugs, “My life’s not worth that much. It almost feels like a good deal, like I’m ripping off fate.”
“You’re not gonna tell me where, are you?” Rhodey sounds resigned, not even disappointed. “Are you doing something stupid?”
Steve tries a different tact. “What if I tried to kill Rhodey?”
“I was selfish.” Steve says, lifting the lid of the piano and picking a key at random. Tony winces at the window despite himself, how could Steve choose something so atonal at random? “You’re right. I ask too much. I can’t go back in time and fix things. I wish I could.  Because you were right about the Accords, too.”
The delete button is pressed savagely, over and over, the cursor blinking gently – patiently, waiting for Tony to type out a proper response. He clicks the lock button, sliding the phone back into his pocket, returning his attention to the document in front of him.
“Why’d you call, Steve?”
“Well…” Steve picks up another croissant, his appetite is rejuvenated. “When would we be able to meet next?”
“I’ve had five years to think. Whenever you made those withdrawals from the bank, I always went to look for you. Always.”
“I don’t think you do, Steve. You love this,” he gestures between them, continuing to pace at the foot of the bed. “And yeah, the sex is phenomenal. And we talk, and that’s good. And we kiss – probably a bit too much, considering what we’re both really here for. And you know, maybe in another reality, if you weren’t so stubborn – yeah, maybe we would,
“You’re okay, Tony,” Steve says quietly in his ear, Tony is shaking. “I’ve got you.”
Tony’s jaw clicks as his teeth clench together, and he reaches up to knuckle at his forehead, knowing that the headache he’ll have after this will be incapacitating. Steve is right, though – Tony wouldn’t do that. And if Ross and a bunch of Marines barged through the front door of the compound right now, Tony would use his last moments of freedom to wipe the phone clean.
“Alright, I see —“ Tony squints harder, “A guy in a cloak. Voldemort? Do you think?”
And there Steve is now, tall, strapping, beautiful – and oh so conspicuous.
Another gulp of vodka down, and now he stands in front of the fireplace, Steve’s dog tags clenched in his fist.
, Paris. Les Bougresses, on rue de Jarente. We have a reservation for 7.”
“Do I need to book a hotel room for myself tonight?”
Steve swallows, and he almost snaps at Tony, almost tells him how unfair it is to mention Peggy to him while they’re both naked in bed. It’s like a betrayal of her memory, but he knows that Tony won’t see it that way – because Tony had told him time and time again how happy Peggy had been while married to Daniel Sousa.
“We could spar,” Steve gestures over to the boxing ring a few paces away – Tony imagines Steve building it by himself, in the hopes that someone would one day step into the ring with him. He glances at Steve’s biceps, calculating the amount of pressure he could issue with each punch.
Tony’s eyes widen, and he draws his hand away from Pepper’s lips, shifting on the bed. “No I don’t,” he snaps, “I don’t.”
“I guess I could. But where would that leave the world? We’re already without Captain America – should I deprive the good people Iron Man, too?” He grins at Steve, that cocksure smile that infuriates him and attracts him all the same.
Tony is joking, but there’s a solemnity in his expression – Steve wants to kiss him again, but slowly, and murmur into his skin that he’s in it for the long haul.
He drags his suitcase up the driveway furiously, muffling a curse when he runs over his own foot in his haste.
“C’mon, let’s get dinner. They invented pesto here, you know.” Tony gives him a cheery grin, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s. “They invented pesto, and this is where the Black Death entered Europe. Fitting, no?”
“Had to wash out the gel,” Tony says as he slings Steve’s towel over his shoulders, the soft fabric brushing over the reactor where it glows on his chest. “Wanted to give you every opportunity to not fuck this up.”
“No, I don’t think I can – but…” Tony smiles at him ruefully, pointing his fork at Steve, squash dangling off the tine. “I’m here, aren’t I? Damned either way.”
“Not joining you til you’re naked,” Steve argues from the bed, rolling onto his back, his hands behind his head.
“Like I said, I won’t complain,” Steve takes his hands again as they circle around a pond. “Hey, look,” he points up in a tree and Tony follows his finger. There’s a flash of red amidst the verdant green.
Sokovia. Ultron. His mistakes. And now, the Avengers are paying for them – though no one seems to realize the severity of the Sokovia Accords. Nobody but Tony.
“Barnes?”
The surgeon clears his throat, “Uh – Captain Rogers, sir?”
“Not bad, Rogers,” he says to his reflection.
“How did you – where were you -?”
“I need to hear it from him.”
Tony shakes his head, nanites forming into a pair of sunglasses that he puts over his face. “Nope. I’m gonna tan – and nap. You can eat though, Cap, by all means.”
Steve follows him, slower this time, more space between them.
“You idiot,” Tony seethes, shaking Steve by the front of his shirt. “You absolute – you could have been caught! And then what was I supposed to do!?”
He starts to pace, his hands behind his back, wondering what Steve would think if he just bolted. Even if Steve pulled his punches, it would sure as shit still hurt, right? Was Steve even capable of holding back? Tony really doesn’t want to have his head busted open, but it might actually help alleviate his headache – and just because Steve was holding back didn’t mean that Tony had to. Maybe he could beat some sense into him.
Steve pulls his brown leather jacket tighter around his shoulders, thankful for the inner wool lining – as the sun began to set, a chill had turned the breeze biting. He hadn’t spoken to Tony since Scotland – though he had picked up the flip phone time and time again, just wanting to hear the other man’s voice. But there had been an underlying message for him when Tony had told him when and where they were meeting, and the message was to not contact Tony again. They hadn’t discussed rules for – well, whatever this is – but Steve has a feeling that rules are coming.
Tony stares at his back, wondering if there’s any ulterior motive in Steve’s suggestion. Likely not, he decides, pulling his shirt up over his head and sitting on the closed lid of the toilet.
“I have a flight,” Tony repeats halfheartedly, allowing Steve to pull him down on top of him as he kisses him slowly.
Steve’s voice is distant, like he’s shouting into one tin can, his voice carried along the string to the other. “Tony, are you there?”
Tony’s fist lands firmly on the right side of Steve’s face, knuckles a fiery blip of pain, but he feels triumphant satisfaction as Steve’s head whips to the side. Tony’s left hand rises to land another blow, but Steve catches it, his grip tight.
“I’m just entertaining myself, Steve – enjoying the holiday, you know.” Tony’s not sure why he’s not being honest with Steve, why he doesn’t just come out and say that he’s considering blasting his own head off because he’s so
“You’re okay,” Steve bends his head and kisses over the back of Tony’s hand where it rests against the bed, avoiding the IV and the bruised flesh around it. “You need to rest Tony.”
“Unless you call a couple decades in the ice a vacation, no.” Steve stares at Tony while he’s got his head bent down, focused on wrapping Steve’s hand. His hair is damp from sweat, curling gently, and that’s new – Steve has only ever really seen Tony impeccably dressed and groomed or bloody and bruised in the middle of a mission.
“Tony?” Steve’s hands reach up to brush over the other man’s back, his touch hesitant.
“Why don’t you talk to Nebula?” Pepper snaps, her delicate hands (
“You’re alright,” Steve repeats, sitting down in the chair next to Tony’s bed, trying to calm the other man. He watches Tony’s hand as it raises, resting against the reactor through the thin fabric over his chest. “I promised you I’d get it for you. I – got the other stuff, too.” A few articles of clothing, nothing more – the hotel room had been rather desolate compared to Tony’s usual opulence – or, previous opulence. The man on the hospital bed is not the same man Steve had known five years ago.
His morning and afternoon were spent at the gym, punching the punching bag until his arms trembled and his world swam in and out of focus. This was torture, he knew that, because he could feel Steve’s lips against the back of his neck every time his gloved fist struck the bag. Then the burn in his chest would come back, the phantom pain of having his arc reactor shattered into pieces, the burn of betrayal – and the realization that he was weak, that he had set it all aside for a night with the man who had lied to him and nearly killed him.
Tony’s eyes close at the kiss, and his fingers fall away from Steve’s sleeve. Steve gently pulls away, expecting to see unfocused brown eyes staring up at him in hatred – but Tony has fallen asleep.
“Tony,” Steve looks at him, taking inventory. His brown eyes are hidden behind dark sunglasses, and his goatee is impeccable, but he’s swaying with the light breeze from the air conditioner – dead on his feet. “You look -.”
“Fuck!” He lunges forward, head striking the side of the fireplace, vision swimming – but he has the necklace in his hands. His fingers are burning, he realizes, looking at them as they redden in the flames. Slowly, he pulls his hand away, and the pain begins. Some of the metal beads of the necklace are burned into the palm of his hand, and he grimaces as pieces of his skin are torn away when he yanks the necklace free. Idly, he reaches up to the side of his head where it had struck the fireplace, feeling warm blood through his hair.
“Tony,” Steve snaps, “You can’t make this choice because of — of hero worship, or — or a lack of self esteem, or…”
“I threw it into the toilet just now,” Steve says around his own, his mouth now startlingly white, even whiter than his perfect teeth.
Tony’s voice is flat, emotionless. “November 10
Steve gets to work on the dishes, looking up from the pan he’s scrubbing when he hears slow and hesitant notes coming from the piano. He arches up on his tip toes, craning his head around the wall, and catches sight of the back of Tony’s head – he’s sat at the piano, his hands hovering over the keys, seemingly conflicted.
“You didn’t have a choice.”
“Don’t make me repeat myself,” Tony’s words turn sharp, “Get out of here! Go!”
“Tony,” Steve hesitantly touches his chest – the arc reactor isn’t there. “Tony, did they – take -?”
i swear to god this started as a one shot but at this point it is writing itself!!! help!!! i have no idea where this is going so come along for the ride i guess. also, tony, that was inappropriate to say in an office setting!!!
out of this. You’re here, and there’s nothing I can do about it – but you are not going to get involved. I’m going to – you’re going to stay safe, and then I’m going to take you back to Aunt May, and she’s going to ground the shit out of you.”
“I couldn’t stay,” Tony sets the cup down. “Well, I guess that much is obvious, since you all woke up and I was gone. I just knew I had to disappear – I couldn’t… I was so mad at you, Steve.”
“Okay, okay. I’ll go get the reactor, I promise. Right after I leave here.” The last time he had held Tony’s reactor in his hands, Tony had thrust it there – and told Steve to hide.
“Hey, Tony,” he keeps his voice soft, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder. One side of his head is wrapped in fresh white gauze, and Tony’s eyes move sluggishly to look at him. There’s an intensity there that Steve wasn’t anticipating, Tony had just been beaten half to death and gone through a challenging surgery, but his grip on Steve’s wrist is strong enough that Steve winces.
“You’ll have to hold it,” Tony mumbles, kissing him in the darkness. “I thought you were running out on me.”
, he had gasped at Steve, the blood not yet at the back of his throat, not yet choking him.
She leans forward, recognizing that Tony is about to throw himself out of the bed, his eyes lighting up with a fury that really shouldn’t be possible given the amount of painkillers he’s on. Her hands press against his shoulders, holding him down, and he’s sobbing – Pepper looks over her shoulder, wishing she had someone here to help her. But Rhodey is in New York, recovering from his own hospital stay, trying out his new cybernetic braces. Happy is holding down the fort for Stark Industries, a terrifying thought. Steve Rogers is, well – he had been the one to cause this carnage.
Steve’s hand clenches into a fist. “Then why did you come?”
In his pocket, the flip phone vibrates.
“Hear that, Tony?” Steve looks into Tony’s eyes, though the intensity has faded to a hazy sort of inattention. “Pepper will be here.” Steve glances down as Tony’s fingers play with the sleeve of his jacket, tugging at the fabric.
Tony will say softly after he’s caught his breath, his hand brushing over the broad expanse of Steve’s chest, pausing over the metal of the dog tags and the ring. Slender fingers will trail over his scarred skin, and Steve will imagine a tingle as Tony’s fingers brush over his paralyzed arm.
He tries to laugh, but Peter Parker is at his side in an instant, and for the love he bears the boy (as much as he tries to deny it) he does his best to keep his grip on reality.
“Good,” Tony says quietly. “Good. Hope he stays frozen forever."
“I’m not marrying you.”
Steve smiles slightly, warm relief spreading over him. It had been a gamble, to accuse Tony of having feelings for him when they weren’t lying naked in bed together – to force Tony to recognize the true reason behind these clandestine meetings.
Something in his voice must give him away, because there’s rustling, the click of a bedside lamp being turned on. Steve’s voice is no longer sleepy, it’s deep, laced with concern.
Vision begins plating a second platter with fruit.  He swiftly slices pieces of watermelon under Tony’s watchful gaze as he gnaws on the celery stick.  Bruce, Tony can see out of the corner of his eye, is carefully following him.  When the room passes in silence for a minute, Bruce finally says, “Tony what is going on?”
Natasha and Clint work in tandem, and Peter had fallen in with them, swinging in and out off speeders before taking them down and tossing them into a larger incoming force.  Natasha’s taken care of a couple close calls with the younger of the three, but he’s gaining confidence and has saved Clint a few times.
“Men do many things that make no sense when they are backed into a corner,” T’Challa replies.
It's nice to have something stay the same.
“Oh wait, I guess you decided to use your Captain America overrides in a non mission capacity. Guess I need to fix those protocols,” Tony continues, stepping around the glass, finding a path that takes him closer and closer to Steve.
Instead, he smiles, a small and barely anything really for the video call, "of course."
He turns to his father, scotch refreshed and contemplating this scribbles with a notes with a smirk of satisfaction.  “Dad?”
I’m coming.
Tony heads their way.  “How did our boy do?” Rhodey asks when Tony gets close.  Bruce is watching him closely.  Vision is scanning the building, probably downloading the footage to review himself.
Tony nearly laughs, “Of course Agent Agent survived.  I’ve got a damn time traveling gem in my head. What else would make sense?”  But instead of laughing, he opens the briefcase and sees the five and a half other stones nestled in it.
Eventually she steps back and stares at the floating diagrams, sees how it’s all connected.
They eat  spaghetti and meatballs, and Spiderman tells stories from SI that has everyone eyeing Tony, but not actually saying anything to either of them. Tony drops stories from his college years, pulling out the most embarrassing but children appropriate ones that has Rhodey yelling corrections over him.  Vision works with FRIDAY to bring up evidence of the misdeeds, and Bruce softly distracts them with stories of his work in the middle east.  Tales of small children, sick mothers, helping birth babies.  His eyes are soft, and Spidey’s lenses adjust quietly, enough that Tony knows he’s recording all of this for later.
Tony curses lowly, feeling the yanking begin and finishing writing out.  “God I do not miss chalk. Do you not have whiteboards yet old man? If not, why haven’t you created them yet?  You can build a bomb but a little post it and some markers are beyond your genius, because of course you can’t think past what will make you a buck.  Ugh, it’s a family company. You better care about our legacy as a family and what it means to protect others blah bah.”
“Of course,” Tony nods.
Tony can feel Steve smile into his shoulder as he varies the pressure. He shudders at the move, fingernails digging into the Steve’s skin as he shifts and pushes up. Steve pulls his head back, catching Tony’s eyes as Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist. Steve groans this time as he adjusts and gets a better grip to hold Tony up. Tony can feel Steve even through the denim.
Tony tightens his grip on the screw driver.  At that close of a range, the lightweight body armor would not have been enough to absorb the shock of an armor piercing round, and if Tony knew those guns the Iranians were holding, they were Hammer Industries guns that were usually loaded with armor piercing rounds.  “FRIDAY, alert Red Wing to advise Falcon to take a safer distance,” Tony voices, barely above a whisper.
Howard had whispered things to her, and Tony still, even with the stone, doesn’t know what he said, but it was probably something said in the same tone as Sharon speaks to him now.  She tries to not sob his name as they both shake “Hey kid,” he says, and if feels like it has been carved out of him, keeping his voice this steady even as he feels like he has nothing left to give in him.  He’s running on fumes. “I’m still here kid. I’m not leaving you alone. Not yet.”
“Sir?” He pauses before taking stock of Tony’s rock t-shirt and jeans.  “Who?” He trails off before looking for a weapon. Then he realizes how close Tony is to Ana and crosses the yard, trying to put her behind him and away from Tony.
Tony lobs his pen at Spidey’s back.  It arches while Spidey continues talking. “Mr. Stark build the suit so there are minuscule gaps between the plating that allows my natural spider-ness to still work.”
, he had wanted to say, but there was no space for words, not after the video. Not after he had held his tongue for so long on so many things.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
she had smiled enough to light up her eyes and laughed, kissing them both. They all ignored the wax melting into her cake as the candles burned down to nubs as she whispered, fierce,
Tony walks around the car and gets in the passenger seat.  Rhodey takes driver, while Bruce and Vision split the back.  “I’m having further testing go through the Maria Stark foundation.  I think Pepper said something around the next few years needing testing before we start selling anything.”
It degrades from there, Clint trying to figure out the number and the missions.  She doesn't give a firm answer to anything, but Steve catches the look Tony throws at her before he disappears to do
Howard thinks for a moment, taking another sip as his eyes go distant before sharpening back on Tony.  “Good ideas, not great at execution. He usually needs some refinement, but Jack doesn’t like him. Thinks he’s selling secrets, but he needs proof.”
"I'm good being Tony Stark and not his driver," he replies.  She doesn't laugh.
“You never took away my protocols from FRIDAY,” she murmurs as the kid takes a seat.
Steve thinks about saying something like,
“Fry, looks like we need to put out a statement.  Transcribe what I say and send it to legal for their blessing.”
"Pepper," he retorts, matching her tone.
He’s older than her in this moment, he realizes, and that’s something.
Steve stands there, paint brush in his hand.  The old ones, wooden with bristles that are fraying from age and use.  Tony has to wonder if today’s world even uses them. If this is just Steve clinging to a semblance of the past, like he used to back in the day with the old Brooklyn apartment.
From 54985-466-8653
Steve hides his surprise by downing his whiskey.  It burns and he feels a faint fuzziness at the edges of his brain for a few moments before it fades.  “Just the beer Scott smuggled in and has Bucky addicted to.”
“There’s no good way,” he whispers as Steve’s fingers trail down his nose until he stops right before his fingers brush Tony’s lips.
He hides all the evidence with the baking soda poured into the ferric chloride.  It foams as he dumps the glass of water dumped into the ferric chloride and then carefully trots to the garage where the trash bags sit, waiting to be taken to the curb later that evening.  Tony unties the knot and slips the jar, used baggie and tongs in.  He trots back into the house, towel under his arm, glass and board clutched tightly in his hands.  Jarvis watches him as he places the glass carefully in the dishwasher and towel in the box.
Tony shrugs. "Long time ago. Can't miss someone too much after 20 years."
Tony stumbles upstairs, one day after the first Avengers team up, but before Hydra was everywhere, and Steve had been glued to the TV, watching some entertainment news on Neal Patrick Harris and his family.  Tony got some food and a drink before he realized Steve hadn’t moved the entire time he’s been banging around in the kitchen.
“Any bad guy?” Tony trails off.  “No, aliens!” He grins and looks to his mother who has frozen.  Jarvis’ eyes nervously dart from him to her, and Tony’s brow furrows.  “Wouldn’t it be cool to meet an alien Mama? What if they are green? Or orange?  Or purple?”
Pot. Kettle.
Tony slips his hands into his pockets and one shoulder shrugs.  “I don’t think we’re good around each other,” he replies. He’s honest because what else is there now?  He has bandages on his wrists that prove he shouldn’t be anything but. “We weren’t before, and now, I don’t know.  I can’t look at you without feeling like I’m a failure.”
Steve wonders if Tony can tell his heart is racing.
He sees himself across the bed from Steve and the steady peace that he has.
Straightening, Tony queries, “How did you know?”
You don’t get that right any more.
It’s him and Ultron, but it’s too early for that.  So it’s Erskine and the super soldier formula.
Tony calls the suit to him merging on his body in a familiar hum. Natasha adjusts the Bites on her wrist. Clint throws a few more arrows in his quiver. Bruce is standing around in his purple pants, breathing in slowly. "Come brothers and sister in arms!" Thor crows. "Let's defeat the giant white blobs."
It's been a year and three months when Natasha calls him into the conference room.
“I thought you got that fixed,” Spidey replies curiously as he straightens.  The suit is still intact. Tony hums as he circles Spidey.
Tony exhales sharply, wetly.
Perez turns to him as the kids make it down the stage. Peter hovers behind Rihan in case she needs help.  She doesn’t.  “You’re the good thing Tony.  You’ve been a good thing to all of us.”
Tony sniffs and opens his eyes to the doorway to his parents room when he was younger before they decided to keep separate rooms when he was a teenager.
“An experiment,” Tony declares.  His new favorite codeword has his mother grinning.  She loves his experiments.  He comes and explains them all to her, and Dad watches a smile at the edge of his lips, and Tony always thinks,
Tony tosses him a tired grin. "Oh I think I like Cap more." Cap's face falls, and Tony redirects, "But I can call you Steve. I think. It may take me a while to get use to remembering you are a mere mortal and not someone Dad used to ramble about."
Tony almost asks
She’s had an issue since the RAFT
Spidey perks up.  “Yeah actually.  It’s really fascinating under a microscope.  But any dead skin cells don’t have hairs on them, so I’m not sure if they connect at a sub-dermal layer or deeper.”  He curls up his finger and the paper drops lazily from the ceiling to the floor.
She shrugs.  “I am approaching a normalcy where I am used to murder attempts on my life and my brother’s increasing annoyance about my protection.  I’m trying to fix all the broken people that keep finding me, and I would still rather be at Disneyland or trying to date.”
But his foil isn't Tony.  It's Barnes.
Tony huffs a laugh while Bruce comes to a halt beside him.  “If you really want to be a martyr, then 1188 can be on your conscious.  I’ll take 1186,”
“Hello T’Challa,” he says when he can finally focus on the man beside him’s face.  “I didn’t think a quick temporary truce between men in battle was what would allow me to ask you of a favor or five.”
“Is there anything you can do?” Steve asks, relentless.  “I know there are procedures -”
They both grin when there is a chirp from a fire alarm, agreement from the AI.
Tony leaves his hand on the door handle when he speak.  He doesn’t turn around.  He simply says “okay” before leaving the room.
Because even if Tony had loved him once, he hasn't loved him for a long, long time.
Bruce lets it go.  “What are you looking into these days?”
The words tumble out of Steve's mouth.  Talking about the old days, when he was younger and smarter and so tiny.  How every winter he just felt so cold, like he couldn't get warm as his heart sluggishly pumped.
He decides that if people don't like there being programming that leans pretty closely to AI level stuff, there has been that idea around the robot butlers that the A&D kids keep pitching around. It's on the idea wall in New York somewhere. Tony can get access to the designs on the server.
“The current Department of Labor head is a former board member of Hammer Technologies, who has a political adviser who used to council former HYDRA political plants like Senator Stern.” She pauses, and takes a breath. “Tony was blackmailed into supporting the Accords.”
Steve looks down at the rag in his hand as he laughs a little. "I have to forgive myself first."
Rhodey picks up where he left off, and when Tony glances over at him a few minutes later, there is still a big grin on his face.  “You suck,” Tony pouts.
"I come up with the best solutions when I am close to the situation," he replies. "That's what Obie always said."
(“I used to cook for Wanda,” he had said, softly.  The metal planes of his face so reminiscent of his when Pepper has said, “Tony, I
Bruce nodded absently, turning the idea over in head own brain slowly, mulling on the idea too.  "You were too," Vision added.
The thing about circuit boards is that they are
Tony just seems beaten down.
From:
“What do you mean ‘you don’t want to know’?  You only say that sort of shit when you are hiding that you’re dying or something,” Rhodey retorts before taking to the air near him.
It's been years since he’s looked at photos of the man.  Is careful not to, actually.
“Have a deep breath for the cameras,” the doctor repeats.
You chose your side Widow.  Leave me to pick up the pieces of mine.
“Okay,” his younger self gives.  “Okay.”
He’s adrift. “They died in a car crash,” he repeats the old story he’s told himself too many times. “Dad was drunk. They hit a pothole. He over-corrected and took them into a tree. Dad always hated seat belts, so it’s not a surprise he was thrown from the car. Mom.” Tony can’t. He leaves the thought there.  He shrugs when he focuses back in on Steve. “That’s why I have a driver.”
” keeps him sober.
She throws her stylus behind her without looking, and hears him yelp as he ducks. She smiles for a moment, satisfied before turning around, an ounce of tension leaving her shoulder before she remembers it all, and hunches again.
He continues in more detail than Steve needs, but it keeps other words at bay.  Things he can't say.  Things he won't say.
“That wasn’t the only plan,” Bruce spots.
He leans down and grabs Tony’s hand before pulling him up with little effort.
Tony shakes his head immediately.  “You need to stay out of this. It works out right now, and I need you to not mess it up.”
When Tony looks up the trackers it blinks slowly in Steve's room. Tony goes into the room, after knocking for five minutes, and the tracker sits on the nightstand with a note.
“Hush, this is important. I need to check on the kids.”
Tony shakes his head.  “No, he’s not. He’s pretty fucked in the head and experimented on, but he’s alive.  What did you always say, you were ‘searching for leads on Hydra cells’? I think? And you found him.”
Tony pulls him in close, tears in his eyes and trying to hide it.  “I can’t lose you kid,” he says, lowly. “There are a lot of things I can take, but losing you isn’t one.”
And Steve, Steve grins. “Yeah, you did.”
Wanda lingers in the back, her gaze steady when Tony meets hers.  There is no red in her eyes or wisping around her fingers when he checks.  She inclines her head to show she sees his check.  Clint stands at her shoulder, bow no-where in sight.  Lang is a bit off to their right.  Sam stands tall to the right of Steve, arms crossed and carefully watching the proceedings before him.  Steve watches Tony with careful eyes.  He looks worn, Tony notes before he closes his eyes briefly.
He grins, sharp and with bitter edges.  “Useless Starks are only useful in one way - dead.”  His vision is going dark, and this is familiar. Tony closes his eyes and hope it’s quick, faster than it was before as the chill soaked into his bones and his breathing slowed until he couldn’t any more.
“Hug! Hug! Hug! Oh shit,” Peter shouts.  It goes muffled on his end, and Tony zeroes in on his direction and sees the eyes of the suit go red before the spider arms come out, stabbing each of the enemies. He lets out a breathe he knows he was holding in.  Friday swings the scene back to the others, and Tony notices Bruce is being overrun, so he motions to Vision to take that.
Wanda needs help.  She loses situational awareness when she focuses solely on control.
“The United States ambassador, supported by General Ross.” T’Challa pushes off the wall and takes a few steps closer to her. Natasha can’t read his expression, but that's nothing new to her. “It was thought about, for a while, but then suddenly senators who mentioned it favorably decided to vote against the motion.” His tone shifts, turning musing. “I remember seeing Tony Stark in Germany a lot that month as I shadowed my father.”
- before letting it all out in a rush. "There was a video of December 16th 1991."
“But you knew that,” the other says, stepping back.  “You could feel it it.”
“Hey,” Tony grins easily. He’s been faking it since he was four, his Dad at his side as he smiles with the circuit board for the first of many newspaper clippings.
Steve nods, words caught in his throat, and watches as Tony walks away.
He opens his eyes, colors brighter and glowing he can tell.  The entire field has stopped moving, and Thanos is snapping his fingers.  The gems embedded in his hand dim with every failed snap.
There are tears slipping down his younger version's cheeks, silent sobs racking his body. Tony has to take a moment to realize where he is, when he is. He knows the second he sees a vivid Ana Jarvis running around a corner, bright red hair, lime green dress circling around her, and how her expression just drops when she sees the younger version of him, probably all of 6 years old, in the corner of the room.
One year later, they are both back there, and Tony is the one tracing the names on two separate, but touching, tombstones.)
“You okay kid?” He asks, idly, like he isn’t looking for something.
"You look as beautiful as ever, and you know I'm always better at showing up on time if we do video calls," he returns, and she's glowing as she laughs at him.  They may be marching off to war, but she's happy.  A weight lifted off her shoulders, and it hurts, just a little, to know that is what he had become to her in the later days hurts, but in a distant sort of way.
Falcon gets an unlucky hit in the temple, and Cap roars even though there is no sound as Falcon goes down under two or three soldiers pulling at him.  But there are some explosions, and Black Widow slides into view, sleek and deadly as she takes out the nearest group with her bites.
You okay?
Tony's mouth twists and he watches the compound as the car drives away, wondering
“Stop it Fry,” he barks.  The simulation stops, the false sunlight dims, and it’s just the lab again,  Tony can see his hand outstretched, ready to reach out and shake him, turning him around,
Not any more.
"Correct Master Tony," Jarvis beams. "We are still friends occupying the same space or not. She is a person I care about greatly even when she isn't present in the moment."
It can, and they both know it, but Steve doesn't say anything, just nods before picking up some paints to mix them. Tony steps back to his desk and gets to work, chattering away with FRIDAY.
Tony’s throat catches as he watches himself, 23 and running too fast, trying to get as far away from everything.  He watches Ana watch him run.  He watches her struggle, pain in every line of her face as she is unable to chase after him, before Jarvis looks back at her.  She summons a smile for him, asking for a story of Tony’s shenanigans.
"Are you," Steve pauses for a moment.  "Would it help if you were seen out and about with Captain America?  If there were pictures to kick up some good press?"
“We’re still working through some issues,” she says.  “There are some energy issues at this point, and we need to figure out charging the new source.  But this model is molded to my body type.  It’s not cheap, so Peter and I are looking into a way to be able to span a recipient's leg and 3D print the exoskeleton to cheapen the initial cost of the unit.”
“Maybe,” Tony replies.  “But I’ll take you down with me.”  The power of the stones dim for a moment, and he twists and turns his chest to Thanos.  “FRIDAY!” He yells as she blasts the other being.
Bruce is smiling in the corner of his mouth.  It’s another the old joke, brought on by a discussion way too late at night about scenarios and code words and how they should handle from of the craziest scenarios.  After aliens invading Manhattan, anything is possible, right?
“Tony,” Bruce says softly.  His entire frame is hunches, and he’s clutching the chair like it’s the only thing hold him up.  “Not okay Tony.”
Hopefully the next chapter will be up in less than four week.  But lol, I wouldn’t trust me either.
He’s not joking, Tony knows by the set of his mouth, and decides not to ask any questions.  “I’m glad you showed up.” He points out a finger and a comm unit creates itself out of nanobots.  “Take this comm so you can keep in touch with the other. Anything not Chitauri or the big purple thing is a good guy.”
Tony quirks his lips.  “Have JARVIS get me if you ever want to talk,” he says.
Tony rubs his right temple.  “Mute the TV and put him on.  It’s a him right?”
“I’m not asking you to,” Tony retorts.  “I’m just putting my cards on the table.”
He looks to her and she says, "I'm so sorry but we have to go Tony."
“Not on purpose,” Steve assures, thumb moving on his cheek. Tony continues to avoid catching his eyes. “Tony?”
It says something, he knows, how comfortable he is with Steve now.  He pushes the thought away, and keeps his gaze on Steve.
He can’t look at Steve, not with all this swirling around in him. Tony knows this part of himself too well. The vindictive angry side that is dark and broken and what led him to burn his captors alive in Afghanistan. He can’t. Not Steve. He
If Tony focuses, he can hear what sounds like himself singing, but in a choir of voices that all sound similar to him.  He has to close his eyes and be still. But he can hear it. It feels like something he has remembered and forgotten a few times.  He takes in a breath and thinks on that and realizes, it’s more than a few.
When they show Clint, he’s on a rooftop taking down men in black harassing South Sudanese women and children as they try to flee.  He ducks when they start trying to shoot him, but he makes short work of the twenty or so men before leaping from the roof with the use of a grappling hook arrow.
Tony laughs. “FRIDAY would rat me out immediately.”
BUT 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!
But then again, Steve’s name at the wrong moment had made her go silent and stare out the window for hours in the 90’s, so Peggy isn’t one to let go of grief easily. Sometimes, Tony wonders if he inherited that trait from her, or it was something he compounded with Howard’s propensity for dwelling.  Or maybe a little of both.
Tony shakes his head.  “It was me.”
“Proximity alarm.  Spidey sense is only for life threatening danger.” The kid answers before he dodges a third stab with a jump to the ceiling.  “
It's not something he is willing to risk.)
He blinks until he clears the tears from his vision, still moving, and looks up to Steve to see Steve half smiling, sweat at his brow. It’s the look Steve has after a good fight with the team. It’s the loop he always has when he meets Tony’s eyes across a room, over a file, across the dinner table surrounded by the team.
“Ant-Man has been spotted taking down another bomber,” the anchor says. A kid is furiously clicking on the trigger, but the bomb is disconnected, and Tony is reminded of the suit when it fritzed in Germany.  Lang gets back to normal size behind the kid, and puts him on a hold until the kid passes out.  He takes the vest off before laying the kid on the ground.  He looks around for a moment before spotting a light post and handcuffing the kid to it.
Tony stares at him for a long moment and Steve has to keep from fidgeting under the incredulous gaze.
Tony meets his father’s gaze before looking away, leaving the topic there.  “What about the arc reactor?”
“Or make them the X-men’s problem, but then again Xavier would have to be willing to fit the bill when his kids destroy something.  I’d rather it be you, you are better about causing as little property damage as you can.”
“Tony,” Steve says, tentative like he is scared to startle him.  Tony can see him in the reflection of the glass, reaching but not touching.
He turns back to Peter and the quickly shortening distance between them and the border and the tenseness growing under his arm.
Vision’s magenta face looks amused in his carefully neutral expression.  “FRIDAY and I were taking bets on who would win.”
So Tony picks up the candy dish some ex assistant gave him and throws that against the wall. It shatters, raining down and clinking quietly, like rain, and Tony likes the sound. There is a queer amount of pleasure in him at the frenzied emotion. He pulls at a pillow, and pulls and pulls until the seams tear under his fingers, stuffing oozing out.
He opens his eyes against the window, the blank white stares back at him. "I lost it a little."
"What?" Tony says.
Still has. For different reasons though.
Tony plays it up, slumps and calls out, "But I thought you loved being flown around!" even though they both know she had hated it.  He whirls to Steve and says, "You like it when you fly with me, right Steve?"
“I won’t see you,” he replies, voice barely above a whisper.
The Iron Spider Suit has been a take on his suit armor.  Lightweight, but strong enough to take a hit.  It doesn’t compress down into a watch or even a cool backpack, but they had been on a time crunch.  It’s still better to hide than a mask in a backpack and a suit under a hoodie.  There are a few access ports in case they need to get into the suit if it’s on the fritz.
“I’m not her,” she replies softly, half curled around the desk and leaning hard.  Her gun is beside her, her hair is pulled back and her lips are red. Peggy stares at him like he isn’t real, like he may save the world or destroy it and she doesn’t know what to do with him.
"Clint," he hears himself say lowly, the beginnings of an apology on his tongue.
“Thanks,” Tony intones sarcastical as he flattens the suit back up.  “I can feel your love from right here, staring at the open whale mouth.”
He spends more time at the compound, after. Natasha narrows her eyes at him on day three but never says anything.  He keeps strange hours in the lab.  Maybe avoiding people, maybe avoiding himself.  The line is hard to determine these days.
Something seizes in him at the image.
Tony loosens his grip on the edge of the couch and takes in some much needed air.  He can see the others do similar things from the corner of his eyes.
“You can close your eyes now,” Daniel murmurs.  “Rest now Tony.”
“Just try it,” Tony replies as he holds out his board.  “I just need the holes, the soldering for the wires to put the battery and the light in.”
The Hulk answers in his usual low growl, “A lot.”
“Bruce,” Tony begs.  “Bruce I need your help with this.  I can’t -” He bites back a sob.  “I can’t, I can’t.  I
Steve sighs, lowly, before calling out, "I really don't want to fight you" as he puts his hands up.  Tony snorts on the line, and the corner of Steve's mouth kicks up, just barely, but Tony's got the cameras trained on him from multiple angles, tracking any motion in the room and altering him to it in bright orange circles, so of course he catches it.
Steve tilts his head and looks askew to him.  “Not exactly what you’re talking about,” Tony adds.  “But when people don’t see you or know you.  It’s hard.”
Same here.
She smiles back. “Burn baby burn.”
"We worked to separate you from the Avengers, from Ironman, after that first lawsuit. Remember?"
“You were wished for,” she would say.  “Dreamed about.  Longed for.”
They don't talk about it.  They never talk about it.  Steve burns with wanting to know, but he doesn't ask.  Remembers the pale shade of Tony's face and shoves the words back down.
"It still means something," Steve says, voice low. "To me at least."
The stone in his head is warm, soft, like it’s trying to say
The less said about the week after, the better.
Tony lets Pepper pull him out of the room, before hissing, "What did you say to him?"
Steve pauses, “When did..” He waves at Tony’s side.  “Happen?”
"I need more time," Steve utters, like it has to be drug out of him. "I don't know-"
When Steve comes into the infirmary, Tony’s sitting in an old worn Metallica tshirt and jeans as Shuri pokes and prods him.  On his right side is a gleaming metal arm, not unfamiliar from Bucky’s, and Steve’s mouth goes dry.  If Shuri pokes the arm enough with the instrument in her hand, the top layer melts away and the wires inside are left exposed.
"You sure you don't want to come with?" Steve asks, leaning against another treadmill as he has watched FRIDAY and Tony banter back and forth about sass levels and being sent off to be the test project for the incoming interns for the next summer.
“Where are the cameras?” he asks after three more prompted “deep breath”’s.
BUT. They are some of the best people, beings, whatever, in the world.
"I love your steady, quieter love,” Tony whispers, like it’s a secret.  “I know things are hard and I can be...a lot on a good day, so thanks for sticking around.
Tony doesn't care about any of that. He drops the parts in his hands, and hugs her tight and close. Breathes in and clutches her. She holds on just as tight.
He swallows down the wave of grief he feels, because Peggy is dead - has been dead, even though he was talking to her moments before her.  And his grief won’t do anything except cloud his vision and every version of Peggy he knows would be angry he let sentiment overtake him when he had the world on the line.
Tony tilts his head and smiles at Steve, even though it feels like he’s empty inside.  Nothing else left to give. “I just thought you should know. I thought you should know it’s not something you should worry about.  I’m not going to cling to you because you are the only thing I have left in the world that I know, because I realize I don’t really know you anymore, and it’s not really good for either of us that I stay here.”
whenever he tried to visit.
Tony doesn’t feel the tug just yet, and doesn’t want to leave, but it’s the 60’s, before he’s born and he can’t start this all running just yet.  And the fear they look at him with is eating him up, and he doesn’t know if he can bear it, this being the last time he sees them. Jarvis trying to protect his wife from him. Ana staring at him like a stranger.  “No, I’ll leave. One second, I’m sorry. I just wanted to see-”
It hangs for a moment, and Tony’s eyes are dark and searching. Steve takes in a deep breath and reminds himself to be honest because Tony deserves that.
Which one?
“Not really, “ Tony admits.  “Your arch nemesis has the president's ear and has played his cards right that the UN adores him for catering to their whims.  He had had his claws into the Accords from the beginning, and with it gaining power along side him, I thought that I had enough time to expose his doucheyer sides and get him removed and our own guy leading the charge.”  He pauses before pushing off the wall.  “I thought I had more time.”
Pepper comes into the lab that Steve has taken over for the last eight months with his painting. Natasha pushed and he finally gave in. It's been a year since the snap, and Steve still hopes, somewhere, that Tony will come in one day with the solution.
Tony clocks the five original heat signatures moving back towards the building.  Steve's picked up shield and working on knocking out the two guys left.  Tony just says, "five incoming" as Steve takes down the last guy before the door busts open with the five come running into the room.
Then the barrier comes down.
“Okay,” he states. Steve’s mouth opens and closes a few times. “You’re worrying me Steve. What’s going on?”
on that roof.  She reaches out and then hesitates before dropping her hand.
"How do you maintain a friendship?" he asks. "Is there daily maintenance and certain standards to make sure everything is working as it should."
“You know I like Sue and the kids and would help you.  But you need the rest of them working with you,” Tony tilts his chin to the rest of the superheroes around the room.  “And me here? Isn’t helping that. They can forgive you if they think it’s my fault. They can’t forgive me. I’m distracting them from getting stuff done.”
Okay now you’re just being too nice.  Are you dying?
Tony smiles to himself. "Hey babe," he retorts.
When Tony was small, and Howard was out in the Arctic searching with Maria at his side, he would follow Jarvis around during his tasks.  The wrangling of the pat of flamingos that had taken over the pool area in Beverly Hills.
“About the search?” Tony queries as he shuts down the compound schematics floating behind him. He still hasn’t told Steve. Maybe he won’t ever share this secret with him one on one. Something in his chest shifts at the thought, and Tony can barely breathe for a moment. “J told me you and the flying ace were in Russia last. You find any clues?”
“Taking your not so subtle hint,” Tony replies.
He had said coolly, and Tony had had to hide his flinch over the video call.
Kid you’ve worked on improving the SI prototype for the past 2 months.  I’ve seen your crazy hours, including those weekend ones you think SI doesn’t know about,
But some days, Tony's heart stutters, and it's harder to get up out of a chair, and he can feel the well worn tiredness of knowing his body has betrayed him one, twice, many times before.
“It looks like social media is calling this quintet the Secret Avengers,” the anchor announces.  “One has to wonder what Tony Stark and his Mighty Avengers are thinking right now.”
"I'll watch out for him," Steve reassures her. He is wearing tactical gear, shield on his back with a fine array of nanobots across the top to make it invisible. Still, it's a familiar and comfortable weight.
He looks up and both are watching him. "I've been thinking about a change in scenery," Tony says. Rhodey quirks an eyebrow. Vision is expressionless, as he is most days now. "How do you feel about going back to the Tower?"
It’s obsolete in this future.  Just like him.
“Avengers,” Cap says, hoarse. “Assemble.”
"We all probably have a few," Natasha states, clear, and they all turn to her.
Tony grows and crashes upon familiar emotions and Tony is just overwhelmed by the constant thrum of emotion.
They fall,
“Yeah,” Tony breathes.  “I know what you mean.”
A door creaks open, and Tony turns around.  It’s Steve, smaller, almost painfully smaller and thin.  He looks like he is about to break. “Oh,” tiny Steve says, and this, this is what make Tony nearly smile.  There he is. “Are you Mr. Stark?”
He laughs, sharp and broken and so so tired.  “I don’t know if I can do it without you.” He has to pause to let the paper stop shaking even though he knows the words by heart.  “I certainly won’t do it as well,” he admits, quietly.
Well, he winces around the aftertaste of puke in his mouth, more like days
“Don’t even act like you don’t have 500 versions of this arm on your tablet.  And just because I’m interested in figuring out the intricacies of vibranium, doesn’t mean I’m doing ‘needless’ experiments.”
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve breathes against the side of his head, his hands grasping at Tony tightly, holding him on the ground.
“I do know how to use Google, Tony,” Steve replies sharply, “But I don’t need it to know that you’re drunk right now. Drunk and probably doing something dangerous. Where are you?”
“It’s not,” Steve swallows. “I didn’t know, Tony."
“Say that again.”
“Tony, you’ve thrown my angle off,” Steve says in exasperation, reaching down to nudge Tony’s head away.
Tony rests his forearm against the counter and buries his face against it with a melodramatic groan. “I should have gone to the hairdressers.”
“Ugh,” Tony sighs as he sits up properly, stretching his arms over his head. “The stuff you say is sickeningly sappy sometimes, Steve. Like… I’m literally nauseous.”
“Tony – Are you – Hey, Tony – What are you doing right now, sweetheart?”
People come to visit them, and once Steve hears how hard and deep Tony laughs when Rhodey stops by and cracks a joke, he makes plans to have someone visit them weekly. Tony and Natasha in particular seem to have productive discussions, though Tony is reserved after she leaves, far away. He’s grieving, Natasha had told Steve quietly in the kitchen. He’s worried that you’ll ask him to leave – that had been a new revelation, one Steve didn’t understand.
He opens his eyes, looking into Steve’s – Steve, whose hand is unzipping his jeans. Steve, who had left him in the cold to die.
He had dressed up for this, had a new suit fitted for this very occasion. The Bvlgari watch on his wrist is the icing on the cake, he had dressed to the nines and Steve is wearing jeans and a brown leather jacket. A leather jacket that is stretched tightly across his broad shoulders, keeping him warm.
“We’re talking now,” Tony says, shouldering the phone against his ear as his hands move to rip the package to shreds. A small square of paper flutters to the floor, and Tony seizes it.
Steve crosses his own arms over his chest, his jaw set. “Come on, Tony, I’m serious. Can’t we just… put a pin in it? Just for right now – I came to check on you, you said you had a headache.”
Steve straddles the seat and catches Tony staring at him, watching the other man blush and look away.
Steve shifts forward slowly, closing the distance between them, centimeter by centimeter. He expects Tony to bolt again, as his lips brush against his, barely more than a touch. Tony doesn’t bolt, but he does pull away. Steve glances down for a moment, wondering if that’s a bulge in Tony’s shorts or just wishful thinking and the way the fabric is bunched up from how he’s sitting.
Tony tenses when Steve’s hand passes over the back of his neck, squirming slightly as Steve rubs a cold, slimy substance into his skin.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve presses a soft kiss just below his ear, and Tony feels the hair on the nape of his neck stiffen – amongst other things. “Night, Tony.”
“A little worse for wear. I wish he’d told me. And I’m worried that he did, and I don’t think I was listening to him.” Tony shakes his head. “Just goes to show that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”
Steve nods, reaching down to unzip his jeans, rolling them down his thighs slowly. Tony glances down at his hands, and then back up at his face, his expression one of furious delight.
The Jaguar’s engine revs wildly, Tony throwing the gearshift into reverse and backing out without even checking that the way is clear. Steve stands at the foot of the drive, watching Tony speed off, wondering where they go from here.
Steve thinks of the helmet he had slung over the handlebars for Tony and feels sick. This isn’t how this is supposed to go at all.
Sweat trickles down the back of his neck, and Bruce Banner looks at him like he’s not speaking English.
“I trust your taste, Tony,” Steve says as he lifts up the glass, breathing in before taking a sip. Tony’s eyes darken slightly as he watches Steve’s throat bob, his fingers digging into the meat of his thigh.
Steve doesn’t get up from his chair, instead, he watches Tony as he tans. The sunlight catches the beads of water on his chest, and Steve’s eyes follow them as they trail down Tony’s abdomen, glinting in the curls of dark hair that spread down below his navel, and are eventually absorbed by the fabric of his Speedo. He watches Tony even after he’s fallen asleep, mouth slightly agape as he snores. Tony is a restless sleeper and he tosses and turns on the chair almost violently – Steve reaches out and rests his hand against Tony’s shoulder, making sure he doesn’t fall off the chair. Tony grumbles in his sleep, leaning in to Steve’s touch, but Steve pulls his hand away.
Tony has not spent a Christmas truly alone since the year his parents had died. After that, he would spend Christmas with Rhodey’s family – and after he had hired Pepper, she would usually find herself in his Malibu mansion, making sure that he didn’t choke on his own vomit as he drank himself to oblivion. And when he and Pepper were together… She had allowed Tony to sink himself into the holiday completely, stringing up bright lights and dragging a massive Christmas tree through the foyer. And yes, she had requested that he limit his singing of Christmas carols to the waking hours, but she had smiled all the same – and sang along, sometimes.
“Christ, it isn’t? I always wanted to be the one to take Captain America’s virginity.”
“Dead,” Red Skull says, at his side in an instant, and Tony windmills his arms to keep himself from falling over the edge in shock.
His fingertip presses into Steve’s chest, the fabric of his sweater soft. Tony’s finger brushes down slowly, watching Steve’s skin flush pink, his eyes on Tony’s lips.
“How’s Nat? She dropped off the radar – I figured she’s with you.” He asks, to distract himself from these thoughts, picking up another oyster. If he keeps thinking like this, he’ll walk out of the restaurant, nausea twisting his insides as he recalls the grainy security camera footage of his mother –
No one seems particularly convinced, but the discussion ceases. Steve will step out into the woods tomorrow, onto the platform that Bruce and Scott have built, and he will return the Stones to their rightful locations. That’s not all, though, he has Tony’s spare Pym particle. He had tucked it into Steve’s pocket alongside the soil samples Bruce is occasionally working on. All he needs is one, anyways – there’s no use coming back here, not when he can see Tony. See him alive. Spare him.
His eyes are focused on Tony’s hand, the pad of his thumb brushing over one bruised knuckle, hearing Tony inhale sharply.
“Uh…”
Red Skull watches this impassively. “You haven’t asked me how to get the Stone.”
“Yes, I do have time to freshen up. Tell Ross I’ll be there right on time.”
“Kid dressed up in a onesie, shooting webs from his wrists. Kinda hard to forget.”
The curved blade made out of his own suit plunges deeper, Thanos looking at him almost in pity as the end of the blade punches out of his back. Tony’s feet slip out from under him, but there’s a large hand in his hair, combing through dark curls, and really –
Tony’s feet fumble as Steve pushes his backwards, the back of his thighs hitting the edge of the mattress, tumbling down onto unmade sheets.
“You fell.” Natasha repeats tonelessly. “We’re going to be late.”
“I hate children,” he had snapped at Steve months ago, mostly a lie – but now, as he stares at Peter Parker, he thinks that he may have been spilling an inner truth without even realizing it.
“Hot damn, Tony, what did you do to it?”
“I can take care of myself,” Tony repeats, his voice lowering, words laced with rage. “I don’t need Captain America telling me that it’s nap-time, believe me.” He steps into the huge sitting room, eyes passing over the grand piano, briefly taking in the scene of the ocean through the expansive walls of glass at the back of the room – this is eerily similar to Malibu.
“Sorry,” his hand returns to the small of Tony’s back. “Been wanting to do that all night.”
For a few moments, his gaze fixates on the ocean, and he tries to time his breathing with the crash of the waves.
Tony frowns at the blinking exclamation point at the top of the screen, squinting at it. He thinks it’s an exclamation point, anyways, hard to tell with the complete lack of clarity the screen has –
“Shit!” Steve almost falls off the bed as he lunges across it, pulling open the drawer of the nightstand with such force that it falls off the rails, contents spilling out on the floor. He grabs the phone from where it sits on top of his sketchbook, flipping it so hard that he’s worried that he’s snapped it in two.
“Can you blame me?” Steve sits up, the sheets pooling around his waist. He moves over to Tony, pressing his lips over the bite mark. Tony leans back against him, sighing as Steve’s hand brushes over his chest, moving through the small patch of hair to the rough, risen skin of his arc reactor scar.
There’s a shift in Steve’s expression, a quick flash of betrayed rage, like both Peggy and Bucky Barnes were off limits to Tony.
“You want me to pity him?” Tony shakes his head, still looking out at the waves. “You want me to pity him, and you want me to forgive you. It’s too much. You ask too much.”
“It’s gonna be okay, okay? Just help me –…” Tony grits his teeth together, aching body crying out as he struggles to sit upright. “Help me sit up, and then… I’ll fill it with nanites. I’ll be good as new, I promise.”
He laughs, though he shouldn’t, and there’s no humor in it. Lately, he’s been self-medicating in an attempt to stop the nightmares. Steve would murmur his name in his ear while he slept, his lips would burn against his throat, and then he would slam the shield into Tony’s chest over and over again until he woke up shaking and sweating – tears burning in his eyes. No amount of scotch seemed to do the trick, nor vodka.
He sets Tony’s hand down, lifting up the other. “Rookie mistake. You’re lucky you didn’t break your fingers. They’re just gonna hurt like hell for the next couple of days.”
“Ugh, you charlatan,” Tony mutters, knocking Steve’s hand aside. He picks up the lemon wedge, squeezing an ample amount of juice over the oyster before picking it up and handing it to him. “Swallow – you’re good at that.”
“I made a lot of anonymous donations – to orphanages for children who lost their parents when… I think that was my… I mean, I don’t exactly have a favorite thing about… But, if I had to pick – I made some kids’ lives better. At least I could do that.” Tony’s lips curve upwards, but he’s not smiling. Steve forces himself to unclasp his hands, reaching out to run his fingers over Tony’s forearm.
) clench into tight fists.
Tony grimaces, “Yeah. I sold it. Strapped for cash.”
“Tony…” Steve’s fingers brush over the sharp edge of his cheekbone, and Tony wants to fold into the touch – wants to fall on his knees and let Steve catch him.
“ – Like shit.” Steve takes his suitcase from him, walking with him through the airport – it’s not as busy as it could be, given the holiday, but he knows he shouldn’t have hugged Tony. It was an instinct, to prove that the man was truly there – not on the roof of the Avengers compound, contemplating jumping off of it.
“I deserve that,” Steve says, his thumb idly rubbing over the back of Tony’s knuckles. “I do. More than that, Tony. But please, come inside if you’re going to kick my ass. It’s cold out.”
“I don’t want you to turn yourself in,” Tony continues, pushing his suitcase over to one of the many bedrooms. He peers inside, judging the size of the bed – it will do. “Because then I would worry about you.”
“Tony, we lost.”
Tony’s hands curl into fists at his sides, looking down at where Stephen Strange is currently being tortured.
“I have to take this,” Steve says breathlessly, apologetically, running his fingers through Tony’s damp hair. “Sorry.”
“Don’t want to be wasteful,” he says through a mouthful of cake, Steve watching his tongue dart out and swipe chocolate icing off of his bottom lip. Tony’s leg brushes against his under the table, the slightest amount of pressure, and Steve can feel the heat of his skin through the fabric of Tony’s trousers and his own jeans. He eats his dessert faster.
“Don’t mention her!” Tony’s face contorts with rage, Steve has never seen him this livid in his life – though he can tell that Tony is suffering from a terrible hangover, and he wishes the other man had taken his advice and gone to bed. “She was an innocent. She had nothing to do with my father’s work. You’re telling me Barnes was given an order to kill them both? He killed her first, and he made my dad watch!”
“Christ, Tony, what’s the matter with you?!”
“I dyed it,” Steve admits with a grimace, looking up as a waiter appears at his side with a bottle of wine.
“It’s not as good as when my mom makes it,” Tony sighs, rubbing a hand over his forehead. He reaches behind to the back of his neck and prods his sunburn, a hiss of air escaping between his gritted teeth.
“Jesus, not again,” Steve groans when he wakes to an empty bed.
Steve shakes his head, “Aren’t they an -?”
Tony scowls, putting the vial back into his pocket. “I’m not entirely excited to reach the top of the ominous misty mountain, Steve. Did Nebula even say what’s up there?”
None of them are fatal. The one that could possibly invoke the most damage, a broken neck or a broken back – he’d have to get exactly right. He’s drunk enough that he doesn’t trust himself to pirouette through the air as required.
Pepper had quietly extended an invitation to him as well, but he was, in truth, terrified of Richard Potts. Pepper’s father had never particularly cared for him, and while their break-up had been mostly amiable, he knew that it had not improved his standing in her father’s eyes. So, he had declined that, too.
“Really?”
Dr. Rodriguez shrugs, “Hard to say. At least a week, at my best guess.” He checks his watch, “Alright – if you’re gonna see him tonight, we’d better make it quick.” He gets to his feet and walks to the door, looking over his shoulder at Steve expectantly when he doesn’t rise from the seat. “Captain Rogers?”
Tony’s eyes light up, and he gives Steve a bright smile. “Peter – you remember him?”
The flip phone vibrates violently in Tony’s hand, and the missed call screen is wiped away as Steve’s name lights up the screen. Incoming call, Steve, 2:30 PM.
Tony’s breathing grows harsh, and there’s rustling on the other end, like he’s trying to twist out of the phone booth to see anything he can tell Steve.
He’s technically homeless now – each week he’s in a new hotel, getting a very in depth tour of what lower Manhattan had to offer. The tower – Stark Tower, Avengers Tower, whatever you wanted to call it – is off limits. Not that he’s angry about that, though his brown eyes are dark as his fists fly. No, Pepper needed a place to live – and they were broken up, weren’t they, so he couldn’t exactly sleep in the bedroom next to theirs – hers. Maybe he can spend the night here – Tony laughs breathlessly, bitterly. Even here, at the Avengers compound, he’s an outsider. Just the purveyor of goods and services, the guy who stopped by to upgrade everyone’s tech – or the guy who stopped by to issue a warning.
“Yeah, oh,” Tony’s voice is tenuous, sounding on the brink of hysteria or frantic, breathless laughter.
Steve admires Tony’s profile as he cooks, the way his jaw sets, the curve of his nose. He moves with a quiet confidence through the kitchen, never second guessing himself as he tosses ingredients onto the pan. He idly wonders how many relationships Tony has been in during which he’s allowed himself to cook for his significant other. Pepper, for sure – and now Steve. Soon, Tony is humming under his breath, a slight smile on his face as everything seems to be coming together. Steve has seen this expression before, but only when Tony was working on a suit – always working.
His thumbs move under the table, typing out a text message to Steve.
They exchange a flurry of blows, Steve landing punch after punch to his ribs, his abdomen – Tony feels as though he’ll be a mosaic of bruises tomorrow. If Steve wasn’t holding back, he’d probably just be a slurry of lacerated organs – so at least there’s that. Tony, to his credit, gets in a few blows that seem to rattle Steve, because the supersoldier’s next right hook sends Tony sprawling face first onto the mat.
Tony slips under the ropes of the ring, dancing around the mat, trying to work out some of his anxious energy.
Steve laughs, tipping his head back against the pillow, but his laugh turns into a choked groan as Tony drags his fingers over him slowly.
“C’mon, Steve,” Tony groans, reaching down to pull off his socks. “I told you that you had to pick the next place. Why do I have to do all the work?”
Tony laughs, shaking his head. “Are you asking me if I want to die? Nope,” Tony pops the p obnoxiously. “I don’t care how safe you say these things are, I’m not doing it.”
“She has a way of doing a lot of things – stabbing people in the back, for one, she’s great at that.”
Steve pulls his hand away from Tony’s rapidly warming skin. “I have… kitchen scissors.”
“Marry me,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s ear, the other man crying out beneath him as he comes. Steve follows not long after him, closing his eyes and allowing himself to get lost in the pleasure that washes over him – frantic, hot, and perfect.
Steve has the pen in his hand, though his fingers had avoided contact with Tony’s.
Tony shrugs, looking out the window, “I didn’t have a choice. I have to be in Brussels tonight. An EU benefit, and then I have to speak. Dance for our dinner – win a few hearts. Anything I can do to keep the heat off of you guys, and off of – the Avengers. Don’t get it twisted, Steve, this was just sex.” He looks over at Steve and frowns. “That was harsh, I guess. But honest. You don’t have to go right away, though – the apartment – I… Bought it.”
Steve picks up his keys, climbing off the step – his knees ache, and he must be imagining it – surely the serum would prevent degenerative joint pain. “Sure. Wanna come?”
The last time he had been in a hospital in Berlin, there had been a new piece of machinery in his chest.
them?
“Look. I know five years is a long time, and just because I’ve managed to – you know…” He can’t bring himself to say ‘forgive you’, but Steve fills in the blank for him. “Doesn’t mean that you’ve not… uh… moved on.”
“I – a motorcycle, I don’t remember the -.”
Steve reaches out without thinking, his fingers brushing over the shaven side of Tony’s head, Tony’s eyes close at the touch. This is the first time Steve has touched him since the hospital – mostly due to Tony’s self imposed incarceration in the second bedroom.
He waits for hours in a tiny waiting room, flipping through an ancient, stained magazine. Tony is featured in it – and Steve catches himself glancing down at the picture of him from time to time as he waits. Tony, ever so suave, leaning up against the door to his office at Stark Industries with his arms crossed over his chest. The light of the reactor is just visible through his fitted suit, and he’s got a smirk on his face. Steve’s fingers trail over the image gently, remembering how the bones of Tony’s skull had shifted pliantly at his touch. A baseball bat. He closes the magazine fast enough that he gives himself a paper cut, and the sting makes his eyes water. That, and the way Tony had slumped over the handlebars like a corpse, his blood soaking through Steve’s shirt.
Steve follows Tony to the kitchen, taking a seat at the counter as Tony starts to rustle through the fridge. He pulls out the scallops and shrimp Steve had bought that morning, eager for fresh seafood caught less than a mile from their door.
“I thought that you had come to terms how they died, Tony – I didn’t want… To upset you more, to… I thought it was a kindness, I really did. I didn’t want to hurt you.”
Tony thinks as he and the three other superheroes (
name.
Hope blooms in his chest, and Tony wants to rip it out like a weed – wants to tear it to shreds with his fingers.
that Tony will be wearing a tailored suit. Just the thought of Tony in a suit makes his mouth dry, his heartbeat picking up in his chest. So many buttons for Steve to undo…
“No,” Tony says with a slight snarl, tugging Steve by the hair away from his neck, hard enough that Steve’s hand grabs at his side. His lips press to Steve’s with ferocious intensity, with enough strength that one of Steve’s teeth catches his lip and cuts it, his own blood reddening Steve Rogers’ mouth. Years of wanting with one kiss, Tony’s hands greedily grab at any part of Steve he can reach – his hair, his jaw, his shoulders. The chair squeaks as Tony straddles Steve’s lap, pulling him closer to him.
Tony is an addict, though, to many things. Alcohol, chiefly. In the 90s, a smattering of drugs. Now, he wants to hear Steve say his name – needs to hear Steve say his name.
UN officials start getting up from the table, Tony still lost in thought, trying to figure out exactly how Wanda would be able to sleep with Vision – could Vision fabricate external genitalia?
“You didn’t need to come help, I had it under control. You listen to me, Peter – are you listening?”
“I want.” Tony steps into Steve’s space, crowding him. His hands reach up, cupping Steve’s face as he leans up on his tiptoes (
He rests his head against the edge of the shield, the metal cool – he should be cold, he realizes, droplets of his blood dripping out of the corner of his mouth and sliding down the curve of metal. He should be cold, because it is snowing, and he’s in a metal suit, and he’s dying.
Tony’s eyes widen, and he reaches up to take off his sunglasses, turning to look at Steve in utter disbelief.
“Absolutely not wearing them,” Tony repeats, but he doesn’t move to pull them up over his head as Steve had feared.
“It’s creepy. Do you blink?”
Tony’s apartment will be messy, covered in circuitry and twisted pieces of metal, so much that it will be hard to see the floor. Dum-E will whir from where he’s placed in the corner of the living room. Tony will hop and skip over things, the path hardwired in his brain. He’ll put away his few groceries and get a glass of water for the two of them, and he’ll direct Steve over to the couch. He’ll shove what might be a Playboy magazine off of the couch quickly before Steve can sit, expression mortified. Steve will sit down next to him, and he will tell Tony everything.
“That’s it,” Tony says soothingly. “You’re okay. I promise.” He kisses Steve on the lips, which are terribly dry, and Steve’s tears are salty and hot against his tongue. Steve’s hands tremble at his sides, and Tony knows he wants to reach out and pull him back to safety – and if he doesn’t act quickly, Steve will do just that.
Steve nods.
“Captain Rogers?” The door to the waiting room opens, and there’s a young doctor standing in the doorway – Steve sees a hint of Tony’s natural confidence in him.
Maybe Tony will wear the ring that’s now resting against Steve’s chest, the world around him disappearing in a flash of light. Maybe he won’t, and that’s fine. But this time, Steve will find Tony, do right by him, and love him – if Tony lets him. He wishes he had done that from the start, but Steve has a second chance. He’ll see Tony again – very soon.
“I’m not,” Tony says quickly, keeping his voice low. “I’m definitely not, are you kidding? But my mom was. She used to come to this cathedral to pray whenever we were in Genoa. So, when I’m in town, I stop by – and I…” He frowns, and Steve loves him so much that he feels as though he might burst. “I’ll just be a minute.”
Tony’s heart is pounding, faster than it should be, much faster than it should be.
He traces over the indents, barely there, and recalls the warmth of Steve’s tongue as he had soothed the bite slowly. Tony’s hand brushes down the front of his chest, fingers rising and falling over the bumps of his ribs, wincing at the slight pressure against dark purple bruises. Steve had not provided any comfort for those, no, he had swung at Tony’s body with such force that this morning he had almost cried taking his first deep breath.
“Anthony is correct,” Red Skull sounds a little gleeful –
Tony pulls his hands away from Steve’s chest, staring up at him, trying to comprehend. “You – You risked yourself, for… ?”
“I’ll be looking out for my trophy in the mail.” Tony mumbles under his breath as he walks back over to where Steve is sitting, the other man tossing the ice pack between his hands. “Let me take care of your cut, first,” he says as he sits down.
Tony knuckles his forehead forcefully, pressing them hard against the skin. This is the nightmare that had plagued him since 2012 – the threat that he will be unable to stop. He needs Steve here, at his side, or they will both fail.
The vitals monitor starts to ring warningly, and Steve looks at him with such desperation – like Tony is taking what hope he had left and crushing it beneath his foot.
Usually, he would shy away from something so bold out in public, but tonight, he leans against Steve’s side. He’s waited too long to play coy, and should someone want to take their picture, they would have to use a flash. Then, he would sic Steve on them and have him beat them senseless. A foolproof plan.
Steve runs to him as he staggers down the steps of the Benatar, taking Tony’s right arm as Nebula holds firmly onto his left.
“My reactor,” Tony says hoarsely, his voice barely more than a rasp. “Steve – you need – I need… My reactor.”
The waiter is at Tony’s side in a moment, and Steve watches in quiet admiration as Tony converses in rapid-fire French. There are a few things about Tony that he’s jealous of: his confidence, his intellect, but most of all – his ability to pick up languages like he had been born knowing them. A glass of still water appears at Steve’s elbow, and he frowns.
“I don’t, but I’m still offended.” Tony has his hands clasped together, resting over his chest, and the comforter is thick enough that the light of his reactor is completely obscured. Steve has not seen him without it since he returned it to Tony in the hospital. Tony is tense, it radiates off of him, and Steve reaches out to poke Tony in the forearm. “Ow.”
“I saw the look on your face with the last swallow,” Tony leans forward in his seat, a plate placed in front of them, oysters glistening. “It’s a great vintage – but I drink wine firstly to get drunk, secondly for the taste. Since you aren’t going to get drunk, I won’t make you suffer. You ever have oysters before?”
“But I do,” Tony sighs. “I do — Unless we’re denying our shared history?”
“Sure, Tony,” Steve looks over at him, blue eyes earnest.
“I have nothing to say to you – well, actually, I guess I do. Fuck you, Rogers. Do you know how much more difficult you’ve made my life? Why couldn’t you just leave them there? Ross thinks I had a hand in it – and maybe I did, because I’m talking to you now, aren’t I? I should give him this phone. Let them find you and throw you in a prison for life.”
“You’ll hear me fall if I’m not,” Rhodey replies with a wry grin, waving his hand. “Go on, go on. Give a shout if it’s something poisonous.”
Tony raises his hand, waving slightly, and Steve grins when he sees him. He regards the supersoldier over the edge of his wine glass, wondering why the hell he had a duffel bag with him.
Tony smiles tiredly, reaching up to brush away her tears. “Keeping my business afloat, Potts?”
He gets in the car, and keeps driving, leaning forward over the wheel to see the road better – his jetlag is catching up with him, and the fog rolling in over the heather is fitting but annoying in his quest to make it to the cottage in one piece.
“Why’d you come back to New York?” Steve asks quietly, the dark hair on Tony’s arm soft against his fingertips – there’s not much left of him that hasn’t been hardened by years of solitude.
“Your teeth are chattering, Tony,” Steve sounds relieved. “You should go inside. Anyways, we’d race in and out of the apartment – the snowman would melt a little more every time we went inside. Snow never stuck around for long in my neighborhood – and eventually, some punk would kick my snowman over, but we’d always make another.”
“She’s – okay,” Steve says cautiously, suddenly feeling like he’s walking on a tightrope – a very thin tightrope that sways hundreds of feet over the ground. “She… Misses home. We talk about you, sometimes.”
“I can tidy this up, sure. After breakfast?”
Tony pauses, digging the nail of his index finger into the muscle just above Steve’s ribs. “No. No, he’s not contacted me since. He’s got god-only-knows how many people out there, looking for you.”
“Uh, no, actually.” Steve shifts the newspaper between his hands, looking back at the print while Tony gets comfortable next to him. “Just reading up on the Series.”
Steve is in London, and Tony is in Vienna. Tony had read the text three times under the table while a UN official droned on, reading page 276 of the Sokovia Accords verbatim.
“A cardinal,” Tony says quietly. “Wonder who it is?”
All Steve can think about is Tony sprawled out on the sidewalk, bleeding, without shoes on. They stole his shoes – Steve can’t fathom it.
Tony winces, “Do you remember the last thing you used them for?”
“Well, I’m glad you minded your business and didn’t go nosing through my files. My Social Security number is in there, you could have committed all sorts of identity theft.” Tony shoves a piece of toast into his mouth, taps his reactor, and returns to the water.
– being a super hero – that will be the hardest thing for him to come to terms with. But then… Tony will lean forward on the couch, and press his lips gently to the scar his gloved fist had left just at the edge Steve’s eyebrow, tracing the risen line down to his cheek. It’s faded with age – but Tony had been right – butterfly bandages were not as good as stitches.
Tonight, Steve can’t sleep – which is truthfully no different from any other night. He had attended a grief meeting in the early evening, and had taken the long way back to the brownstone apartment he had bought for himself shortly after Tony had disappeared from the Avengers compound. It had been an exhausting day – leading these meetings always left him feeling empty and cold, and when he came home, the apartment was empty and cold, too.
Tony shakes his head slowly, a stray tear trickling down the side of his face, cutting a clear path through the blood. “No, no… It’s in my hotel room. Didn’t bring it out with me. Christ, Steve, they had a bat.” Tony laughs, spraying Steve’s hands with a light dusting of blood. “A baseball bat. Can you believe that?”
There are tears in Peter’s eyes.
“There is no later!” The ice pack falls from Tony’s hands as he reaches out and grabs Steve by the shoulders, his expression one of wild intensity. “Do I have to punch it into you? Is that the only way you understand?” He shakes Steve’s shoulders weakly, suddenly realizing how close he is to Steve’s face. He can feel the heat radiating off of his skin. “There is no later.”
“On a walk,” Tony says with a guarded smile. “I don’t know where. It’s beautiful out, it’s my birthday, and I want to walk.”
“You don’t owe me anything, Tony.”
They stagger into the apartment together, Tony’s legs slipping from Steve’s waist, feet dragging against the floor as he’s barreled forward. Steve has him out of his jacket, and then his trousers, and Tony doesn’t know how the hell he’s undressing him so fast. Steve’s hands slip over the front of his briefs, the same shade of blue as Steve’s eyes (Tony had made that choice rather intentionally) and he gives a pleased hum.
He looks up at the entryway to Les Bougresses, blue eyes scanning over the gold cursive letters painted over the black background of the sign. He had expected something upscale, some restaurant where he would feel out of place while Tony would be completely in his element. He had been wrong – and he can picture Tony’s vindicated smile now, as he lingers in front of the restaurant. He peers in through the window, trying to make out Tony inside, the watch on his wrist ticking away. 6:50 – earlier than Tony had said – but Steve wanted to make a good impression. He feels like an idiot – while the restaurant is not as high end as he thought it would be, he still feels underdressed. Beneath his brown leather jacket he wears a plain white t-shirt, which he had tucked into his jeans. His duffel bag is slung over his shoulder still, he hadn’t bothered getting a hotel room just yet – he had so much that he wanted to do in Paris, after all, and if everything went south at this dinner Steve knew that he wouldn’t want to spend another minute in this city. He looks to the right of the restaurant, but the café next door is closed – wildly, he wonders where the nearest public restroom is. He could dive into one, change into something more appropriate – he
He has no idea how Steve is climbing the stairs, carrying him, and kissing him so hard that his toes curl in his shoes – all at once. They really should be tumbling down the stairs, and it’ll be a coin toss as to who breaks their neck. Steve swallows his moans, pressing Tony up against the doorway, the decorative metal numbers of 302 digging between his shoulder blades. Steve’s left hand leaves his skin, keys jingling, and he thrusts it into the lock while Tony gasps against his neck, thankful for a moment to catch his breath.
“Absolutely not,” Tony says quietly, leaning into Steve’s touch slightly. His fingers curl around the edge of the counter as Steve’s fingers card through the long strands of hair on the top of his head that he’s barely held back with some ancient looking gel he found in the bathroom.
“I don’t hate you,” Tony says breathlessly against his lips, “God, I really don’t. Don’t ever do that again.”
Some Hamilton thing, Tony remembers wildly – Peter had not shut up about the musical for weeks, even after Tony had given him tickets to go see it with Aunt May. He had buzzed in Tony’s ear for hours, excitedly detailing his upcoming school fieldtrip to where Hamilton had been shot.
“Made it run smoother,” Tony says, fidgeting hands shoved into his pockets. “Not bad, huh?”
Tony shrugs, setting his spoon into his now empty cup. “I booked us a hotel room for tonight. I don’t have to leave until tomorrow evening, so…” Tony shrugs again. “I’m sure we’ll find something to do.”
Tony jumps, wrench clattering across the sidewalk, and he shades his eyes as he looks up at Steve. “Oh, Christ, I thought you were sleeping.”
“Okay,” Steve murmurs, his lips brushing over the nape of Tony’s neck, wishing he could see the other man’s face. He presses against Tony again, and grins when the other man grinds back against him. Steve’s fingers brush across his chest, over the cold glass front of the reactor, dancing across a hardened nipple. Tony takes another shallow breath.
